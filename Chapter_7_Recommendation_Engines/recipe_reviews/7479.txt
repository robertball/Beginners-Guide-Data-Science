I've baked this cake at least a dozen times & always get rave reviews.  The cake is very moist with great flavor.  It tastes even better the next day! I use Baker's Joy spray to prep Bundt (non-stick or regular) & NEVER have problems with cake breaking up when inverted. I usually cool the cake 40-45 min. at most.  Sometimes butter/shortening & flour combo used to prep pans can be a problem when the cake cools completely.  This "paste" is almost like a glue when it completely cools. For round cake pans, you can heat pan bottom for 5-10 seconds on stove eye (electic or gas) & it will release when the butter or shortening melts slightly. This is difficult for Bundt pans.  I'm huge fan of Baker's Joy spray-it always works! Also, the chopstick idea is awesome. After the cake has cooled for 5 min, I poke 30-35 holes in the cake all the way to the bottom of the Bundt pan with the smaller, tapered end of the chopstick.  Then I spoon or pour on the butter sauce (I make 1 1/2 times the sauce recipe).  Adding 1/2 to 1 tsp cinnamon is a great variation. Also, I recommend creaming the butter & sugar for 5 min then creaming another 5 min after adding eggs/vanilla.  Then I alternate dry ingredients with buttermilk.  The cake rises like a charm (you can use a 12 cup Bundt pan). What a cake!!!

I have been making this cake for 20+ years. It was originally in the Pillsbury Bake off contest in 1963 by Nell Lewis (I'm looking at the book now) The recipe is exact except that it gives the option of Rum Extract, and says to just combine all cake ingredients together, no doing dry ingredients first, or anything like that. 
Today I used 1 cup splenda and 1 cup sugar to see if taste was affected at all, and no one can tell the difference. In the past I have added almond extract to both sauce and cake, as well as peppermint and orange flavors to change it up. All yummy. It does say to use a long tined fork to pierce cake several times, I use kebab skewers and try to widen it a little. I also let it go down the sides so that there are streaks of sauce 3/4 down the cake, just take your time and do it slowly.
Finally it says to let stand 5-10 minutes or until absorbed and then invert onto plate.

Wonderful and easy cake.  I creamed the butter and sugar first, don't like 
buttermilk, so added plain milk, beat in eggs one at a time, then added other 
dry ingredients.  Sprayed a non-stick bundt pan with PAM - no sticking problems. 
Next time I'll poke holes in the cake with the handle of a wooden spoon 
because the butter sauce really didn't soak into the cake much.  Will double 
sauce so I can glaze top of cake too. Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to butter 
sauce.

Ok, time to hear from your fav. Culinary/Pastry Chef.  Very good product. I made dozens of Kentucky Butter cakes before, and this recipe is pretty standard.  Word to the wise, do not overmix, or overbake, test cake for doneness right around the 50 minute interval.  Instead of water try using 3 tbls. of a fine brandy or bourbon when making the sauce.  I let the sugar in my sauce melt with the brandy to the point where it is just about a syrup, but with a few crystals remaining, then I add the other ingredients, this when poured over the "tooth pick pricked" cake gives it a bit of a crunch, which complements the cakes texture nicely.

This cake was super easy.  I didn't care for it at first, so I sliced it up after a day or two and froze it.  I liked it better the second time around...I think that the longer it sat, the moister it became.  FYI, if you don't have buttermilk on hand, just use 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar then fill up the rest of the cup with milk and let it set for a bit and that will substitute the buttermilk.

I have been making this cake for years, I am in the process of finding the original recipe because I think my instructions for mixing is different than this recipe. More information to follow, however I do know that the sauce originally was rum flavoring, and you took a meat fork, the one with the long tines, and poke while it is in the pan, right out of the oven about 50 times around the cake, as far down as you can go with the fork. Then pour the hot rum sauce over the cake and leave it over night.  Then pour it out onto a plate.  Must be covered at all times.  This is a wonderful cake.

Yummy!! This was a very easy recipe to make for a first time cake baker. I used a straw to poke holes almost all the way to the bottom of the cake and used a turkey baster to get the butter sauce into the holes. I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter and the butter sauce. I used powdered sugar for the sauce so it would be smooth.

This cake was DELICIOUS!  I made it for my mom's b-day and it got rave reviews from everyone!  So easy to make & a huge hit with my family!  I added a 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans to the mix & made no baking adjustments.  I also got away with using "light" butter for the sauce & saved half the sauce until serving time. I reheated the remaining sauce w/ some finely chopped pecans & drizzled it over the cake on the serving dish as a glaze.  My stepfather told me I can throw out my other recipes & that this is the only cake I have to bring to family functions anymore!

OH MY!  I made this cake less then 24 hours ago and it is almost gone!  I bake a lot.  Everyday.  This cake is the best, most moist and delicious.

I'm on my way to make another one.  This time I will make small slices in the cake instead of poking holes.  The sauce wanted to run to the center of the bundt pan.  I think slicing it will let the sauce seep in better.

I cannot thank you enough for this recipe!!!!

Well, I wish I could give this more stars!!!! I am literally in tears right now,the cake is still warm and my family is bursting with compliments!!! The reason for the tears?? Well about 4 months ago I moved half way around the world to Egypt from the US, since moving and having to use different ingredients, my baking and cooking in general has suffered to say it nicely!! It honestly depressed me to the point that I had just about given up. Well, one more look on the internet and I came across this recipe by chance. Alhumdulillah!!!!! My husband is now expecting me to use this cake recipe and make some of my pine-apple upside down cakes, something that they don't have here!! I think that this will be a wonderful surprise for my inlaws, even the expensive cakes here are dry and really just decorative, so mine should be a hit....And I owe it all to you!!! I can not thank you enough for this one, I even had to come back, join here and let you know!!!!!

I make cakes daily for a business and found this recipe.  I made my test cake and poured it into two 8" round pans and baked them off.  Once cooled i frosted them both after doing the butter sauce between the layers with Buttercream frosting.  Everyone who tasted this thought it was amazing.  Definately a keeper!  This has made it into my Cake selection I offer to my customers because of this.  Thank you Suzanne!  :)

I use Bakers Joy and have never had it stick. I've never used the cinnamon but have increased the vanilla to 1 Tbsp. I sometimes use a pastry brush to add the syrup after poking the holes.  This seems to give the sauce more of a chance to sink in.  My family and friends have always loved it this way.

O.k here is the skinny on this wonderful cake. One of the best glazed cake ever. I made it a butter rum cake by adding 3 teaspoons of rum plus the vanilla to the cake.  I added 1 tablespoon of rum to the glaze after I removed it from the stove. I also made a final glaze to go on top of the cake. I made the same glaze on the recipe but I mixed in 3 to 5 tablespoons of powder sugar and rum to taste to the glaze after I removed it from the stove.

The name of this recipe tells no lies.  It is so buttery and moist and rich.  I can't believe it's so decadent!  I almost did the same as another reviewer by doubling the sauce but I like to stick to the recipe for my first try.  If you are considering doing the same take into account that the sauce isn't a glaze, it's very thin and is absorbed right into the poke holes.  So every slice has streaks of the sweet sauce that has soaked in.  Just a thought since I didn't anticipate that.  I'll make this time and time again, thanks!

I can't say enough . . . it was awesome.  I almost didn't glaze it because I thought it would make the cake soggy --it doesn't at all.  In fact the second day it gives the crust a little crunch to it while the inside remains buttery and moist.  A real winner --don't hesitate to try it.

This recipe was FABULOUS!!  I just bought the fleur-de-lis bundt pan from William-Sonoma and made this cake. The cake looked absolutely amazing!!! It also turned out wonderfully!! YUM! I did follow someone's suggestion to add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the glaze. It gave it a really nice taste. The cake was gone in a matter of a few minutes and people were fighting for the last piece! I think the next time I make it (which will be this weekend!!) I will poke bigger holes in the bottom of the cake to let more of the glaze fall through. My friends told me that their favorite part was how the glaze trickled through the cake. I can't wait to make it again!!!

I made exactly as stated except I creamed together the butter and sugar in the beginning.  Then, I added the eggs and flavoring.  Then, alternated the dry ingredients and buttermilk.  Do not let the batter fool you.  Mine looked like a pound cake batter.  I do have a suggestion though...if you are making this for family or where presentation does not matter, I would bake this in a 9x13.  The "goo" that you put in top will soak in better and not leave a huge mess.  I baked mine in a bundt pan and I used a skewer to poke holes (and I poked ALOT of holes).  I didn't think a skewer was large enough.  Some have said they double the glaze recipe...I do not think that is necessary.  This cake with the glaze is VERY sweet.  I think it you doubled it, you wouldn't be able to eat it.  Overall very good but very sweet.

This is basically a poundcake with a buttery glaze.  I used cake flour & it made my cake have a much lighter & finer crumb than if I had used all purpose.  I also sifted all of my dry ingredients before putting them in the mixing bowl (but I didn't sift the sugrar). I think sifting really helps create a soft & fluffy texture.  I think it could use a little bigger splash of vanilla or maybe even a vanilla bean but otherwise, this is a great and simple recipe.  I DID follow the odd instructions that tell you to place all the dry ingredients in a bowl and THEN add the buttermilk, butter, eggs & vanilla.  That is a really strange process for a cake but ya know, it worked well.  I don't think it would have worked well if my butter had not been super soft so make sure your butter is very soft.  I put my butter in the microwave on defrost.   I made my cake in mini bundt pans. They turned out so cute and moist and make a perfect individual dessert.  The glaze is buttery and delicious but I'm sure this cake would be great with a berry sauce on top.  So for a really basic, easy, delicious pound cake - this is a great recipe to try.  Make sure to keep your oven on the low temp suggested in the recipe - 325 degrees.

My husband who only likes cinnamon coffee cakes, LOVES this cake he had 3 pieces and told me I need to make it again, My 8 yr old loved it also that is when I know the recipe is a keeper.  TIP:Use a chopstick to evenly prick holes in cake, then you are sure that each slice has the yummy sauce in it :)

UPDATE:  I made this for my son's birthday and used buttercream icing to make it look pretty.  It was a hit!  I'll be doing anohter cake for my MIL tmrw but just plain and with the butter sauce. OH WOW!!!! Baked it yesterday for hubby (in conjuction with Father's Day here in Malaysia).  It was absolutely yummy!!! Even the butter sauce..though i should have made extra and poked bigger holes so that the sauce can seep in.

I baked in a normal square pan as I didn't have a bundt pan on hand..did the same amount of batter, temp and time.  absolutely heaven! Will definitely make this again for my son's birthday next month.

This is fabulous!  Very rich and moist and also very easy to make!  I didn't have any buttermilk so I used an old trick to make some by putting 1 tbsp. lemon juice in a measuring cup and filling with milk to the 1 cup mark and letting it set for a few minutes and viola! Buttermilk.  Most of my family didn't think it needed any frosting or icing but there are a few who always think a cake needs frosting so next time I will dust with powdered sugar or drizzle some glaze on, but I thought it was great!  I got many rave reviews from Sunday Dinner regulars!!

Oh My God!  This cake was incredible.  The only thing that I would do different is poke bigger holes, using the handle of a mixing spoon and make a second batch of sauce and pour it all over the top of the cake after removing it from the pan. Yum.....

This recipe is going in my personal file, it is THAT good. I did not have buttermilk on hand so I used 1 cup of sour cream instead. Batter was a little on the thick side (probably b/c I did not use buttermilk), so I poured in about 1/4 of milk to thin it out some. I also used cake flour instead of AP flour for a lighter texture - no problems there. Instead of using a bundt pan, I used 2 9" pans, no problem with overflow, but the cakes were done in 45 minutes. I used the thick end of a chopstick and poked holes all over before spooning the sauce over the cake. The sauce dried like the glaze on a Krispy Kreme donut. Extremely addictive, thank goodness this cake is for someone else.

This is the best cake I've ever made. I did alter the recipe a little: substitute 3 cups of cake flour (instead of the AP flour), add 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract to the batter and butter sauce (instead of 2 teaspoons), add 1 tablespoon of rum extract to the batter and butter sauce. This makes the cake taste buttery and like rum. Yummy! Make sure to poke holes in the cake (while still in the bundt pan) while it's still warm. Pour the butter sauce over the holes and it'll seep right into the cake. Let the cake cool in the pan to prevent it from sticking.

This cake is absolutely delicious! I was skeptical that it would be bland but it is heavenly. Even my kids who usually will only eat cake if it is chocolate or with lots of icing loved this. Easy to make and turns out great! The only change I made was to poke holes with a skewer, pour 1/2 the butter sauce over top - remove it from the pan and then pour the rest over the other side. Moist and delicious.

I added a tsp. almond extract and a tsp. lemon extract to the batter. I also baked it a dark non-stick bundt pan with Baker's Joy and it slid right out. Then, after it cooled I glazed it with equal parts powdered sugar and milk with another tsp. of almond extract and topped it all off with slivered almonds. So much better than the stuff at the grocery store  bakeries! And it made my house smell divine. I will make this again and again. I might try adding poppy seeds and making them into over-sized muffins next time.

This cake is absolutely amazing. Even my husband loved it and he's really not that big on sweets. I followed another review that said to cream the butter and sugar for 5 minutes, add the eggs and vanilla and cream the mixture for another 5 minutes before slowly adding the rest of the ingredients, alternating between the remaining dry ingredients and the buttermilk. The recipe was more than we needed so I halved the recipe and used a regular cake pan. It was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to have a reason to make it again!

I made this exactly as recipe indicates with the exception that I did not use the glaze.  I used it as the cake part of Boston Creame Pie. It was wonderful.  My only suggestion is that it was much better the next day when it had time to rest and soak in all flavor.  The next day the full flavor and moistness came through.  This is an excellent recipe!  I will keep this forever!

Great recipe,  I made this twice and the second time, with a few modifications, it turned out awesome!  I added 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract to the batter.  I greased the pan but I liberally sprinked the pan with sugar before pouring the cake in.  I poured half the batter into the pan and then I sprinkled chopped pecans and brown sugar in the middle and then poured the remainder of the cake in the batter in the pan.  Once everything was in the pan, I sprinkled liberally with sugar again.  This makes for a great crunchy bottom and sweet tasting outside.  This is such a treat.

OMG!!!  I love baking, but this cake takes the cake!  The person who compared this to a twinkie was out of their mind.  For the person who found this sinful, try using the following alternatives:  substitute 1.5c Splenda for the sugar, and use I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.  I used these and used 1/2c ICBINB, 3T water, 1tsp vanilla, 3/4c Splenda, and 3T lemon juice for the sauce (it turned out ok with all the extra).  Since I found that folks were having trouble getting the sauce to soak in, I turned my oven up to 400, let the sauce soak as best it could, then popped the cake back in the oven for another 6min.  All I have to say is that I have never had such a simple homemade cake taste like some sinfully rich dessert that I could dress up or down.  I'm going to try this next time with rum flavoring...YUMMY!

Good cake. My friends loved it, I thought it was a little dry.  I doctored it just a bit.  Instead of 3 tablespoons of water in the sauce, I used 2 of water and one of rum.  I used a skewer to make the holes, next time I would use something wider since the sauce didn't penetrate well (I think if it did it wouldn't have been a little dry).  Also, I made a chocolate glaze to drizzle over the top (mix 3 tablespoons cocoa, 2 tablespoons melted butter, 1 cup powder sugar and 2-3 tablespoons of hot water...put in ziploc and cut the corner & use as piping bag to drizzle over cake - gave it a fancier look).

Excellent recipe although I had to bake it an additional 8-10 minutes to get a clean toothpick.  The glaze melted into the cake perfectly and made for a very moist, buttery flavored cake.  Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was a hit at our BBQ.  
Thanks!!

This is a very rich cake, but so so good.  I didn't have a bundt pan so I used a 9 by 13 cake pan and I was very pleased with the end results.  I think I can cut back on that butter sauce a bit when I make this for my family (I did love it but I try to cut back on the butter where i can), but I will be taking the suggestion of other reviewers and trying it with rum extract.  Thanks for this recipe, its a keeper for sure!

Although this cake was good(what cake isn't), it didn't live up to high ratings in my opinion...mine stuck in the bundt pan, and I sprayed it thoroughly. As another reviewer said, "Just a cake, nothing special"   If I were to make it again, I'd double the sauce for sure....if I were to make it again....

Just what I was looking for.  These bake up quickly in cupcake molds.  They had a perfect round top.  I made 24 and left no batter out.  The cake is super moist and has just the right amount of sweetness to it.

If you let this cake cool properly it will come out with just the application of a thorough coating of non-stick spray, no flour.  I have used a non-stick and regular pan with the same results. 30-40 minutes cooling time.

I don't feel you need to poke holes in the cake, I have used a bundt pan and angel food cake pan, and if you start coating the cake bottom well (with glaze) when it is is hot, and later when you release it from the pan...if you have patience it does soak in.  

Alterations:  Unless you just like it super sweet, I found that the 'glaze' amount was sufficient.

Use vanilla sugar or paste for a vanilla bean speckled cake.

I prefered the cracked, rounded 'top' of the cake than the molded bundt 'bottom' of the cake, that is why I switched to an angel food cake pan. To each his own.

I have increased the buttermilk to a half cup more at least a couple of times now because I felt the batter was to thick, more like dough.  But in any case I have enjoyed the enriched taste of the buttermilk and have experienced a moist cake with good 'crumb'.

Truly the 'glaze' is thinned down by Kentucky Bourbon or Whiskey to coat the cake (the thinning also soaks in better, no holes) and secondly, Rum is the preferred alternative.

I gave it five stars because without tweaking it to fill my own desires it is still an excellent cake, and because it can be easily altered for personal preference.

Great Recipe!  Will post a picture soon.

Ok....as cake this was just 'eh-oh'.  But, a day later done up as French Toast? It ROCKED!  I whipped up some milk, eggs, vanilla and a bit of cinnamon, sliced up the cake, briefly coated each side in the milk/egg mixture and browned both sides in butter like you would french toast.  Served it with Creme Fraiche and sprinkled with powdered sugar and I couldn't make it fast enough.  I'll make it again...but only to use as french toast !

I made this for my husband's birthday cake and (thank goodness) he loved it!  He is very picky -- he said this is the kind of cake you get up in the middle of the night to have some more. I also really liked it.  This is the third recipe for Kentucky Butter cake I've tried and my favorite.  I will keep this recipe.  It was surprisingly light, I expected it to be more dense.  I may add an extra 1/4 cup buttermilk next time because I like our cakes very moist.

I agree with all the other reviews.  This cake was great!  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used nonfat milk, and it came out fine. I used a well greased and floured bunt pan and had no trouble with the cake sticking.  I waited the five minutes recommended before poking the cake with the chopstick and then spooned the glaze (with cinnamon) over the cake.  I waited another 10 minutes and then turned the pan over and the cake popped right out.  It smelled so good that we couldn't wait for the cake to cool, so we ate it while it was still warm.  It was delicious!!!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I have had this recipe saved for a long while, but only just got around to trying it out, today.  I have to say it was really good.  Definitely something I'll be making again.

I did substitute yogurt for the buttermilk, as I had no buttermilk.  It worked just fine, and still tasted delicious.

I made this last night for a small group meeting, and it was the star of the evening.  Everyone loved it--eating seconds and taking pieces home.  It is very rich and moist.  An excellent cake!

I made this (without the topping) as the cake part of a Boston Cream Pie. I was worried about the recipe because of the very strange method (mix all dry ingredients and then add wet??) and the incorrect chemistry - buttermilk requires baking soda to rise properly, there shouldn't be any baking powder in this recipe. But the reviews were all very good so I used the normal cake method (cream butter and sugar, add eggs, add buttermilk, add dry) and tried it. The flavour is excellent, but the cake was a bit on the dry side. I made 3 9-inch rounds.

This cake was moist and delicious.  My husband says this is "THE cake".  No other cake should be made besides this one EVER!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!  I will be doubling the sauce next time though, it was delicious!

Good recipe, the result is similar to pound cake.  It is very dense, buttery, and mellow flavor.  I made Ruby-Red Strawberry Sauce (from this site) to eat my cake with.

Very good cake!  Hubby gave it a 9.5 out of 10, and he is a tough rater.  I did mess up one thing though... recipe says to grease and flour the bundt pan..well I have just gotten a new "nonstick" pan that said "do not use non-stick sprays on this"...so I didnt even think that I should still use actual grease,  So..... it came out... bit tore up, not too bad, but still tasted GREAT!

I got this recipe out of the Allrecipes cookbook and had to try it.  I thought this was a very rich, but very good cake.  I did make a couple of changes.  Since my family loves lemon, I used fresh lemon juice in  place of the water in the sauce.  I also used only 1 tsp. of vanilla flavoring and for the other tsp. I substituted that with lemon flavoring.  This cake reminded me of a pound cake with a different texture.  Definitely a keeper.   Next time I plan to add a tsp. of lemon flavoring in the cake.  This is also one of the easiest cakes to make.  If you love butter, you will love this cake.

Wonderful cake. Not a soul I served it to didn't like this cake! Didn't change a thing! Best of all, I liked the simplicity of the taste...I didn't feel like a heffer after eating a piece (like you do sometimes after eating rich chocolate cakes or cheesecakes.) Thanks!

very good! the one thing i would point out is that the butter be softened prior to mixing. i also creamed the sugar/butter/eggs together prior to adding the buttermilk and other dry ingrediants as suggested from an earlier review. i increased the sauce about 50% and added 1 tspn cinnamon. i also used two 8 inch cake pans, but i'm going to get a bundt pan before i make this again. USE Bakers Joy - it wont stick to the pan even after completely cooled.

I've never had a "butter cake" before but this was mouth-watering goodness, esspecially considering that it appears to look so plain.  (goes to show not everything is what it appears to be) I don't have a bundt pan (on my xmas list...hint hint)so I used a 9x13 cake pan, which required less cooking time. I too poked moderate size "holes" in the cake and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the butter sauce that goes over all.  Didn't find the need to double the sauce...the amt the recipe required was good for us!! We all loved it! Thanks Suzanne for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This cake is incredible! Everyone that tried it went back for seconds! I have made it about 4 times now, and it every time it was all gone by the next day! I like the taste even more after the cake has been in the fridge for a couple of hours! I don't have a bundt pan, so I used two 8" cake pans instead. And it turned out excellent! I doubled the butter sauce, and I also added a little cinnamon as some other reviewers suggested and it made the cake even better!

Great recipe base however, I would adjust a few ingredients,  I would add more water to the syrup used because it did not absorb at all,  also make sure the loaf is about 80% cooled so the syrup gets absorbed instead of just sitting on top and turning to sludge.  I would also make this as in a square or rectangular pan so that there is more top and less cake for the syrup to penetrate.  I also reduced the sugar by 1/3 otherwise it would have been overly sweet.

AMAZING!!! My family loved this cake. I made it for Thanksgiving today. At the advice of some of the other reviewers, I creamed the butter and sugar together. Then, I added the salt, baking powder, baking soda and vanilla extract. Then I added 3 of the eggs...one at a time. Then I added the flour. Then I added the 4th egg. The buttermilk was the last ingredient I added. This made the mixing process so much easier. I actually mixed it by hand because I didn't feel like pulling out my electric mixer. I used a large meat fork to poke holes throughout the cake, then poured the butter sauce over it. Again I say...AMAZING!!! My husband has requested that I make this again at Christmas and add pecans to the batter.

Great cake overall, lousy directions.  Make it the same way you would any other cake:  mix all dry ingredients together and set aside.  Cream butter and sugar together, add eggs and vanilla, mix thoroughly.  Alternate adding dry ingredients with wet, starting and finishing with dry.  I didn't wait til it cooled to cut into it as we had it with ice cream but if you want a perfectly presented cake, definitely wait before unmolding.   Great taste and easy if you make it the traditional way.

Cannot figure out the rave reviews for this one.  Cake was moist, but flavor was nothing special. The sugar sauce had an odd flavor.  Cake did stick terribly to the pan, too!  Next time, I'll make a regular pound cake.

ADD A BIT (PROB ABOUT A 1/2-1 TSP) BANANA LIQOUR TO BUTTER SAUCE and a 1/2 tsp cinnamon...delicious...another tip: flour the bundt pan VERY well or it will stick. Also, watch the cake not the clock...time varies a lot on this one. Do not overbake!

simple and good tasting, but nothing special. The syrup was too much, I will probably cut it in half next time. It is difficult to uniformly distribute the syrup to all the cake, so some points may become more wet than other places, and actually I liked the parts with less or no syrup more. I used both knife (suggested by another reviewer) and toothpaste to create a lot of holes everywhere, but still didn't get the result that I was expecting.

I made this cake today and it is WONDERFUL. The smell alone is mouth watering. Instead of all purpose flour I used cake flour, put in 1 Tablespoon of vanilla extract (got that from another viewer), and added a 1/3 cup more of white sugar. For the glaze a used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as requested from another viewer, (thanks for that tip!) This cake is so good and moist, also a keeper!!!!!!

This cake is wonderful. It's moist and buttery. I think it would be very good at any time of day. I made it exactly as directed. I did not have any trouble getting it out of the pan. It had a lovely light brown crust.  It was delicious! I would be proud to serve it to company for any occasion. Thanks, Ms. Stull.  Your recipe is excellent.  I also appreciate the comments of many other reviewers.  Excellent suggestions.

I made this cake for a family get together. First time I try a recipe, I follow instructions then the next time I will tweak if necessary.  It was a very easy and quick recipe to put together. I liked the taste and texture but my husband did not. He prefers a dryer cake and I like the moist cakes.  This is a very moist cake.  I did do a double recipe of the glaze and used about 1 and 1/2 recipes to glaze the cake.  I would do the cake again when I need a cake in a hurry  since it is so easy.  I would recommend it but would not say it was my favorite cake.

I have been looking for this recipe for several years.  My ex's Grandmother used to make this and it was absolutely melt in your mouth wonderful!  The only thing I do different is double the butter sauce and pour over the top.  Thank you for the recipe!

A great cake! It's simplistic yet delicious. The texture and moistness improves the next day so I always make it the night before. I pour 1 tablespoon of vinegar into a one-cup measure and fill the rest with milk in place of the buttermilk.

Absolutely delicious, and so easy to make.  Just make sure your butter is nice a soft so it mixes easily with the other ingredients. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Any one can make this cake!

I've made this twice in a week and a half. The first time I made it in the mini porcelain baking pans and included it in my gifts to friends & neighbors. I was unsure how it would be as far as sticking to the pans and if the recipients would be able to get it out. I ended up making a parchment liner going up the short sides and along the bottom. With each one I gave away, I forewarned them to run a knife along the edge to loosen and they all popped right out. Very rich, buttery, terrific cake. I can only imagine what it will taste like with strawberries in the spring time. The next one I made I did do in a bundt pan and after letting it rest and cool for a bit had it while still slightly warm with coffee for a mid-morning breakfast. Just a wonderful recipe that will be in my regular rotation from now on. I've recommended this recipe a lot in the last few weeks and will continue to do so.

This was so easy to make. I had all the ingredients on hand, except for the buttermilk, i used plain milk instead. It worked out great. i think i might make a little extra sauce next time. Tastes great the next day also. i just put a piece in the microwave for 30 seconds.

Makes a great cake, I have used it several times, in fact it is one of my husbands favorites. The only thing I do is to put the mark of a bourbon vanilla pod into the batter instead of vanilla extract as I do not have extract available to buy where I live. Thanks for sharing!

This cake is so good that I made two one after the other. It is delicious even after a few days.  I used Splenda for the cake but used the sugar called for by the recipe for the butter sauce.  Thanks a lot for sharing such a great recipe !

We LOVE this cake!  It's texture is like angel food cake, but then the taste is like pound cake.  We found it to be sweet enough without the glaze, but I think we will put it on next time for extra richness.

Awesome cake.  I changed the directions, I creamed the butter and sugar together and then added the eggs, vanilla, and a teaspoon of orange zest.  Then I mixed the dry ingredients together.  I alternated the dry ingredients with the buttermilk.  I doubled the sauce recipe, and poured 3/4 of it as directed, and spooned the final 1/4 over the top once I took it out of the pan.  It turned out perfectly.

Being from the south, pound cakes were and still are a staple among recipes passed down to family cooks. This one fits that description very nicely, indeed. The cake has a tender texture and is moist even without the butter and sugar mixture. I've done it both ways and no one in my family will turn it down, either way! It's the perfect answer when a friend comes over for a cup of coffee and an afternoon chat! Just make sure you have copies of the cake recipe. They will, no doubt, ask for it!  Many thanks for an excellent recipe.

This cake is ok by itself but the butter sauce is a MUST!  I used a silicone bundt pan and sprayed it with cooking spray.  It came out beautifully after cooling for about 20 minutes.

So decadent, so rich, so delicious.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used one Tbs. of vinegar + regular milk to = one cup.  Also, be sure you let the cake cool completely in the bundt pan.  I was a bit too anxious to try this and it split in two pieces when I flipped it out.  But who cares, it was just for hubby and I!  Get a cold glass of milk for this one. Insanely good!

Very good.  I creamed the sugar and butter like another reader suggested and that worked out beautifully.  However, I think the cook time should be reduced.  I cooked it for 60 min. and the outside was overcooked and tough.  The cake had a wonderful flavor though!  I'll make it again, except, I'll reduce the cooking time.

I do not care for the dryness of a pound cake and this takes care of that problem. It is my husbands absolute favorite and many people have told me its the best cake they have ever eaten. It seems to improve the longer the cake sits as the butter sauce absorbs throughout the cake. Will keep at least 7 days and can easily be frozen. Thanks for a great recipe.

Boy does this bring back memories of my favorite aunt who is since deceased. She was an awesome baker, and always had yummy cakes. She called hers kentucky butter-rum cake. I made this and only change was adding rum extract to the sauce. This cake just gets better the longer it sits. Thanks Susanne !

Tastes like a twinkie! Are you joking??? How can you compare this slice of heaven to one of those bright yellow chemical puffs? This cake was awesome. Some people just don't know a good thing when they see it (or in this case, taste it).

What an incredible recipe. My cake fell a little but with it's taste who cares? I added four tablespoons of dark cocoa to mine. Simply too delicious. Hubby and five year old son said this is the best I've made so far. I used a wooden spoon to make the holes in the cake. I was able to get the sauce virtually everywhere in the cake.

This cake was a little thicker then I would have liked.  It had a good taste.  I followed the recipe exact but still found it a little thick.

The men in my family loved the cake.  Personally, I was disappointed.  I agree with one reviewer that likened the texture to sweet bisquick.  I get more enjoyment from a good pound cake recipe.

This was terribly rich but we enjoyed it. Some people might not enjoy the richness, though. It's close to being over the top on richness. You will only want a small piece of it.

This cake is absolutely fabulous!  I made it for the second time and added about 1/4 cup more buttermilk which I think made it even better.  I also increased the butter sauce recipe by adding an additional 1/4 cup of sugar and used 1 stick of margarine instead of 1/3 cup.  I will make this again and again!  Thank you for a great recipe!!!

This was a really good cake.  Next time I think I will make two batches of butter sauce...the 2nd I will cook after the cake is cool, letting it boil, and drizzle over the top of the cake.  A dollop of whip cream, and a dash of cinnamon on top is good also.

This cake is really good.  I was worried about it sticking in the pan like a few reviews stated, so I ran a thin wooden skewer around the edge and center of the pan before turning the cake over and it came out of the pan with no problem at all.  I also used a chop stick to poke the holes for the sauce like someone suggested and it was the right amount of sauce through the cake.

This is a great cake. Since I don't have a bundt pan, I used two 9x5x3 inch loaf pans, and they turned out really good! They even freeze well, too! My whole family loves it!

I used artificial sweetner instead of sugar as my Wife is diabetic.  Other than that, I followed most of the directions to the letter.
The one place I strayed was where it said to cool completely before turning it out of the pan.  Yeah, like that's going to happen.  It's still warm and half of it is eaten already.  I may have to make this again tomorrow.  Great crust and great recipe.

We have a child in my home with an allergy to eggs, and not many "eggless" cakes work out as planned. Because of this, I tend to experiment with conventional recipes to see how they'll turn out without the eggs.

Yesterday I made two of these cakes at once - one with eggs and one with Ener-G Egg Replacer. I added cinnamon, cardamom and nutmeg in the batter and the glaze for each cake. Both cakes turned out okay. I filled the bundt pan with the eggless version halfway, and it rose all the way to the top. The eggless cake was as moist as the eggy one.

Without the added spices, I'm not certain if I would have enjoyed the flavor as much, as it seems like the majority of the flavor comes from the glaze. Still, I'm happy with how the cake behaved in the oven, and find it's a good basic recipe that can be easily adapted. 

In any case, I am very pleased to have found this recipe.

I was confused about the directions at first.  When listing ingredients, you should list them vertically in the order that you use them.  This recipe lists the ingredients horizontally, thus combining the sauce and cake recipes together.  Paula Dean has a similar recipe that is fabulous.  Her technique works well with this type of inverted cake.  When the cake come out if the oven, use a fork to poke holes in the top.  Pour sauce over the cake and let it sit for 30 min.  Then invert the cake onto a cake plate.  Don't shake the cake out of the pan.  As it cools, it will loosen itself and fall onto the cake pan intact.  Ends up perfect every time.

My husband and I both loved this cake, although we sprayed the pan and it still did not come out of the bunt pan correctly.  It tasted amazing through.  I think I'll take it out of the pan right away next time and glaze it from the top instead of the bottom.

I made this cake recently and it was a definite hit! Thanks to the many helpful reviews, I made some minor but very helpful modifications to the recipe. I creamed the butter & sugar first and then mixed in the remaining wet ingredients. Then I slowly added in the remaining dry ingredients (pre-mixed). After baking, I let the cake cool for 15min before poking lots of holes with the fat end of a chopstick almost all the way through the cake. Then I slowly poured the butter sauce into the holes. I let that sit for another 15min and then served the cake. The cake was still warm at that point which made it go really well with ice cream. I did feel that the parts of the cake without sauce was a bit on the dry side, more noticeable once it cooled. If you store it in the fridge and eat it the next day, that seems to solve that problem ... but then the warm cake is always better, I think. I also added a tablespoon of bourbon to my butter sauce which gave it a nice extra boost to the flavour. I didn't have any problems with the cake sticking in my bundt pan. I greased and floured the pan (Nordic, non stick, original design) and the cake fell right out! This is a keeper recipe for sure.

This cake was absolutely fantastic! It was one of the easiest cakes I ever made yet the flavor and texture was outstanding. I followed the recipe to the tee. My personal suggestion is to make the cake the day before. The flavor seemed to develop even more the day after I baked it. I would also make an extra recipe of the butter sauce and use it in and on top of the cake.

Nice yellow butter cake.  made pretty much according to the recipe, used a chopstick to poke holes in cake just after it came out of the oven and doused with sauce, which was promptly soaked up.  Had no problem getting it out of greased/floured pan, after cooling in the pan for about an hour.

My infamous sweet tooth has been satisfied !
One of the most decadent cakes I've ever had the pleasure to bake & eat. Rich, sweet and oh so good.
I did followed the other reviewers suggestion & added cinnamon & a dash of nutmeg to both the batter & sauce. A bigtime keeper. Thanks for sharing

Made this recipe as cupcakes.  They came out absolutely perfect!  I could not ask for a better recipe!  I whipped the heck of it using my kitchenaid mixer.  Great recipe!

This is a fabulous cake.  I've made it several times, and each time I was asked for the recipe.  I use a chopstick to poke many holes before pouring in the butter sauce.  Once word of advice - DON'T skip the butter sauce - it makes the cake.  Without it, you will have an ordinary yellow cake that is actually a little on the dry side.  I increase the sauce recipe to 1 1/2 times what the recipe calls for.  Yum!!

This was my first time making this, but I was confident enough from the reviews, that these are headed out for teacher's Christmas gifts. I'll be attaching the recipe with the cake. 
My Changes:
I used individual bundt cake and cupcake forms, and baked approximately 30-35 minutes.
I also used a combination of 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda for the sugar in the cake, and 1 cup of egg beaters for the 4 eggs. Next time I will substitute something healthier for half the butter.

They turned out beautifully and yummy. You won't be disappointed. Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too?

I was very excited about this cake but concerned when my batter was thick almost like bread dough and was browning after 45 minutes bake time. I ended up making extra sauce since I couldn't tell if it was moist enough while still in pan. Made it Sat afternoon for a Sunday lunch and it just didn't turn out as I expected.... I will probably make my own changes to make this one better next time.

I have been making this cake for several years now, and it's ALWAYS a hit.  So moist, buttery and rich!  I have my guests waiting by the oven door when I make this.  We love it!  My family has renamed it the "butt" cake, since it goes straight to your hips :-).  Since they request it all the time, it must be worth it!

great basic butter cake recipe!  i actually experimented and made two cakes - one with 3 cups flour and the other with only two.  i liked it with less flour as it was denser and very moist.  as my family doesn't like super sweet cake (except for me), i only used 1 1/2 cups sugar for the cake and 1/2 cup sugar  for the sauce.  i also added a few tablespoons of cheap brandy and cooked the alcohol out of the sauce.  to decorate the cake, i made fresh whipped cream with no added sugar as my frosting, garnished with berries.   the cake was a lovely mother's day treat - thank you so much!

This sounds delicous..Can this be made into a sheet cake? I have been asked to make a 2 layer cake for a child's communion, and need a good vanilla or butter cake recipe. Any suggestions?

This is the second time I am making this recipe.  The first time I made it with the butter icing.  Today I  omitted the icing and added one cup of coconut to the batter.   Both times the cake came out moist and delicious.   This is an easy, quick cake to make.

This cake was so rich.  I really did not get a chance to really taste it but I am surely going to make it again.  I took it to agathering but I had some trouble getting it out of the pan ( a little impatient) so the presentation was not very good.  I will make this again.

I loved this cake! It turned out very moist, especially where the butter sauce had soaked in. I'm glad my brother took it back to school with him because I couldn't stay away from it. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautiful!

I was SO excited to try this cake, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. I made the recipe as written. The butter sauce only soaked in about halfway, and that added moisture and flavor but made it a bit greasy. The cake was decent, but not what I would consider a 5-star recipe. Basically, it's a pound cake. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream on the side, and the ice cream was what stood out. I would use potentially serve this with strawberries and cream in the future.

Yummy!!! It's a very dense and rich cake.  I didn't add the sauce but next time I bake this cake, I will definitely do it.  It freezes very well, just wrap tightly in plastic and then again in a plastic bag.  When I was  ready to frost the cake, I defrosted it in the fridge.

This cake is absolutely fabulous. i made it tonight and my dad says its a keeper. mum said it was wicked and asked me to cut up some immediately for her to take to office in the morning. I followed the recipe to scratch but made 2 alterations. i cut the sugar down to just 1 cup/200g because i was afraid it would be too sweet. it turned out great, also i cut 50g of sugar out of the butter sauce.  additionally i added 1.5 tablespoons of lemon juice to give it that extra zing. the cake is absolutely gorgeous and so easy to make. enjoy :)

I didn't love this cake. My husband however, thought it was great.  The batter ended up looking like pancake batter and while it baked beautifully, it just tasted so so.  The butters sauce was OK but as it settled, the cake just started looking like it was streaked with grease.  I won't be making this again...

Wonderful cake recipe.  I wanted to make a coffee cake recipe that called for a box of yellow cake mix (which I didn't have) so I used this recipe in its place and the coffee cake turned out great.

The only difference is I've used milk instead of buttermilk, simply because I have all the other ingredients in my pantry, but never have buttermilk.  It's great the first day, and just keeps getting better!!  This is my new favorite easiest cake ever.

I did not put the butter sauce on it/in it... I opted to use it for strawberry shortcake instead.  I cut fresh berries and sprinkled w/ sugar to make a syrup & had it over the cake... I think it was delicious texture.  I even think this cake would withstand a milky syrup like w/ tres leches cake.

This is a lovely cake.  I messed up the icing forgetting the liquid, but it was still excellent.  We ate it with cool whip, blueberries, and strawberries.  It makes a pretty, golden cake.

This cake is super delicious!!!! I ended up using 2 cups white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour because I ran out of the white flour and the cake still came out great.  I was concerned because the batter was kind of thick but it all worked out in the oven.  There is a lot of sugar in this recipe, but the cake is not too sweet at all.  It is just perfect.  I used a kabob skewer to poke the holes in the cake and let all the buttery sweet sauce seep deep inside. I think the sauce is what puts it over the top-DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. I think I am going to get another piece right now. Yummy in the tummy :)

Snaps for Suzanne! This was wonderful.  My daughter is not a fan of chocolate cake so I baked this and it rocks. I didn't have buttermilk so I just used regular milk, it didn't matter. I took the advice of others and made more sauce, 1 1/2 times the recipe which is 1 cup + 2 T sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup + 1 1/2 t water and 1 T vanilla. I used my big pasta fork to make holes. Next time I will find something thicker because the sauce didn't go all the way down and I let it sit in the pan for more than 90 min. Any way you slice it's a very good cake and a keeper!!!

This was incredible, I did end up cooking it for 1 hour 10 minutes. Made it a day in advance, and then made another buttermilk glaze and poured on top. fantastic.

Very Yummy!  I used this recipe to make a pineapple upside down cake and it turned out wonderful.  I baked it in a cast iron skillet, which is how my family has always baked them.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe.

This cake is INCREDIBLE!!  Very buttery and moist.  I used two round pans instead of a Bundt pan and cooked for about 45 minutes.

This cake was absolutely delicious! I loved the glaze and think the next time I make it I will take the suggestion of another reviewer and will add an extra half cup of buttermilk. I cannot wait to make this again!!!

I love this cake. I think for the cake size..just a pan used for angel food cake..there was too much of the butter mixture, but it is very good. I made some yummy cream chease frosting and let it sit overnight. It's not soggy anymore from the butter but I still think..personally..theres too much butter mix. I'm going to try it in a 9x13 pan and use it for my son's 4th birthday. It's fantastic! It's very delicious without the butter mix if you want to skip that step. All in all it's absolutely delicious!

This is a really good, dense cake. I went by the recipe exactly, but after tasting it I decided it definitely needed more glaze, so I made another batch and put it all over the top, then it was perfect!

This cake is fantastic!! OMG!! For those that think that they should double the sauce...don't! It's quite a bit of as is. The only thing that I did different was the mixing method. I creamed the butter and sugar and added the flour alternatively with the buttermilk. And I poured most of the sauce on top of the cake as directed but I reserved some and poured it on to the inverted cake after it came out of the pan. I used the ingredients as written and it was so good! I try hard not to eat all the baked goods that I prepare but I couldn't help picking at this! A definite keeper for me!!!!

I used this recipe to make a cake for my sister's birthday.  I replaced the butter sauce with chocolate frosting and baked the cake in two 9-inch pans at 350 degrees F for about 30 minutes.  The cake turned out moist, buttery, and delicious.  I'll be using this recipe again!

Wow - good stuff!  Followed tyronebcookin's Suggestion of adding another 1/2 cup of buttermilk - Good call.  Also added in some cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the batter, and tsp of Rum Extract to both the glaze & batter.  The extract really gave it an excellent boost.  (Just used my metal meat thermometer to poke holes, and plenty of them)  Glaze, as written, is plenty.  Finished it off with a light dusting of powdered sugar.

Very rarely do I bake anything let alone get asked for recipes, except this Easter when I brought this cake to a friend's place. I did make a few slight changes. I don't have buttermilk or vanilla extract so I used 1/4 c flavored creamer and 3/4 c milk. I also substituted the vanillla for the creamer in the glaze. As suggested, I used a chopstick to make the holes, then I used a funnel in the holes to make sure the yumminess got down the holes. After I flipped it over I sifted powdered sugar then chocolate powder on top.  Nevermind the rave reviews, I can't remember the last time I had three pieces of cake in one sitting.

My mom has been making this cake for years.  It is so delicious.  You do need to poke holes in the cake so that the butter sauce can penetrate all the way through.  We use a bamboo skewer or chop stick to poke the holes.

Made this the other night to take to a friends house for dinner, I really liked it, although it is a very rich cake. I followed the recipe exactly, took a little longer than it said. Was wondering if anyone else made this and used a frosting? Since it is so rich I just sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar to make it look nice. My husband and friends also chose to put a glob of whipped cream on. Will probably make again but maybe next time I will sprinkle some ground cinnamon in the batter, I think the cinnamon flavor would be a nice variation to spice it up a bit, although it is very good following the recipe as listed. Will definately add to my collection.

made this cake yesterday and it is very good and very moist. very important to let the cake cool completely before turning it out of the pan so the butter sauce has time to set and better the next day after flavors have time to mature.

This cake was dense and delicious! I didn't have any vanilla on hand, so I substituted in 2 tsp freshly brewed espresso. Also, rather than use the butter sauce, I used a coffee frosting (the easy powdered sugar + milk + some other flavorful liquid + butter type recipe). I think I gained 10 lbs from all the fat but it was worth it!

This is not a dieter's delight but for those that aren't dieting, it is wonderful!  We like bundt cakes so this was yet another kind to make - the butter & sauce makes it yummy.  Mine also did not take the full 60 minutes to bake so I'd watch it.

Terrific! I cooked the cake in a spilt pan rather than a Bundt pan. It turned great. (Hint but a cookie sheet underneath because some of the butter will drip). While it was cooking, I sliced two bananas and then mixed the bananas with a container of cool whip. I let the cake sit for about 10 minutes then served it warm. The cool whip just melts right in and the banana gives it the perfect accent. Have with coffee and enjoy!

Good cake, the sauce was yummy, but I also had trouble getting it to 'soak' into the holes.  I ended up taking it out of the pan (was afraid it would cement itself in and I wouldn't be able to remove it)and drizzled most of the sauce over it that way, it made it kind of 'crunchy' on the outside, in a very good way.  I didn't even use all of the sauce, I was afraid that the cake would get soggy.  Turned out very well, but I'm not sure when I'll make it again, due to the diet UN-friendliness.  Also, I will agree with previous reviews that it isn't the prettiest cake I've ever seen.

I used pam spray and the cake came  right out of the pan. I made the recipe according to the directions and it came out nice. I wish the directions were better when it came to poking holes in the cake, i started with tooth pick and moved to a chop stick to get the sauce to soak and not pool. Also, you need to heat sauce slow (on medium to low) and be patient, to really get the sugar to dissolve...then it will not be grainy when cooled. It is a butter cake, plain and simple, but who says plain and simple isn't yummy?

This is a keeper! Very moist, great texture. My hubby and kids gave it two thumbs up. I am going to use this recipe as a base for a bundt coffee cake and see how it turns out. I did use the handle of a wooden spoon to poke about 6 or 7 holes in the cake and I used a knife around the edges of the pan to allow the butter sauce to soak in. It is so exciting when a recipe turns out so well. Thankyou so much!

This turns out nicely although I felt like I was gaining weight just putting it together!  That's a whole lot of butter (2 sticks in the mix and 1/3 cup over the top).  I served it with fresh raspberries and whipped cream.  Everyone liked it.  I'm just not sure for myself if it is worth the fat grams.

Delicious cake!  Will definitely make again.  Next time, though, I will glaze it differently.  The bottom of the cake ended up sticking to the plate because of the glaze, while the top had no glaze.  A very minor problem!

Great recipe and my family loves it. My best critic is my husband and my youngest daughter and  I know for a fact if I have a winner if my critics can't get enough of it. Just make sure to test cake right after the 50 minute interval. Like what another reviewer said, Do not overmix or over bake. Thanks Suzanne for the great recipe!!!

Loved it! Instead of white sugar for the sauce, I used light brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon. Served cake with fresh raspberries in a reduced Chambord liqueur syrup and a sprig of mint for garnish. Guests were much impressed.

My Only Regret is that I can't give it 10 stars?

This recipe is Fabulous.  The cake is moist and oh so buttery!  Of course, I made two changes.  I added a scant 1/3 cup of very finely chopped walnuts, which made the cake texture nice.  And I added Almond extract to the batter and to the butter glaze with the vanilla.  I know I'll be making this again and again.

Finally, a great recipe that I found online that tastes great.  It also doubles well and tastes even better w/a bit of lemon zest added to the batter.

Very good! It definitely needs more butter sauce drizzled through and over the cake.  It's yummy though!  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the sauce.  I used Pam spray and my cake came out of the pan beautifully.  Definitely a hit!!

Delicious cake!!! My family really enjoyed it. The sauce adds a terrific crunchy texture to the bottom. My daughter said it was the best cake she ever had! My mother-in-law remarked on the old-fashioned goodness that she remembers from her childhood. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved this cake!  However, I will not make this cake again in a regular bundt pan, because my cake stuck to the pan and fell apart and I heavily buttered and floured the pan.  I would recommend using only non-stick.  My husband wasn't too upset, he ran to the pantry and came back with fork and plate in hand.  Excellent recipe, I can't wait to make it again.

GREAT CAKE!  My husband couldn't wait to eat it for desert.  So we ended up eating it as a snack in the afternoon.  I didn't have any problem with it sticking to the pan like others did.  It came right out. I did use a chopstick to poke hole in the cake.  It turned out great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

While this was a nice coffee cake it was not the gooey moist cake I expected. It also was impossible to remove from my bundt pan after letting it completely cool as directed. If I make it again I will put it in my angelfood pan and line the bottom with parchment for easy removal.

***** 5 Stars!  I've made this recipe twice in the last week, it's VERY good.  I let the cake cool for about 5 minutes before poking numerous holes with a skewer or chop stick.  I highly suggest adding cinamon to the sauce.  There are many other ways you can vary this recipe.  I added 1/2 cup cocoa to make a choloate version.  I also drizzled powdered sugar icing over the cooled cake.  You can fold in fresh/frozen blueberries.  You can add a liquer to the powdered sugar icing and/or sauce.  You can use any flavoring (lemon, strawberry, etc.) to the cake and/or sauce in place of vanilla.  ENJOY!

YUM!  I had an extra pint of cream in the fridge
so I substituted it for the 1 cup/ea milk and 
butter.  Also, brushed the inside of the bundt pan
with shortening and sprinkled unsweetened coconut
all over the inside of the pan, then a couple
of tablespoons of chopped pecans in the bottom of 
the ring and stuck to the original butter sauce, 
no cinnamon.

This is a fast and fabulous dessert.  Mixes in one bowl!  Could vary this by adding 1 tsp cinnamon to batter and 1 tsp cinnamon to syrup, very much like another cinnamon recipe on this site.  But this recipe mixes in just one step.  That is something I really like. You could also add 1/4 to 1/3 cup cocoa powder to the cake to make a chocolate version.  This is a real keeper1

I just made this tonight for my husband since he hates frosting. We absolutely loved this cake! 
1) I greased the 10 inch bundt pan with butter, shook enough flour to coat the greased pan and set it to the side
2) In a smaller mixing bowl, combined all of the dry ingredients, EXCLUDING the 2 cups of sugar, added a teaspoon of cinnamon.
3) I then preheated the oven at 325 degrees.
4) In a larger mixing bowl, I mixed the 2 cups of white sugar with the 2 sticks of slightly melted soft butter, then added the 4 eggs with 1 tablespoon of vanilla to blend in. Shortly afterward, I stirred in 1 cup of buttermilk.  I finished by incorporating the dry ingredient mixture just enough into the batter.
5) I then evenly poured the cake batter into the Bundt pan and put it in the oven for 50 minutes.
6) While the cake was baking, I pulled out a small sauce pan and started making the sauce. Altogether, I melted 5 tablespoons of butter, 3/4 cups of powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons of coconut rum, 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.
7) I checked the cake by poking it through with a paring knife to ensure it was done baking. (I could have used another utensil, the knife was just on hand) It came out clean so I took out the cake.
8) Then I used the back of a skinny sauce utensil to poke a bunch of holes into the cake. I then poured the sauce onto the cake, covering the holes I just made.
9) I let it sit for 30 minutes and then gently flipped the Bundt pan to invert the cake onto a st

Everyone loved this cake! I made it with 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon almond extract in both the cake recipe and the sauce recipe and taking the advise of several reviewers, I doubled the sauce. I turned the cake out of my bundt pan while still quite warm and it worked perfectly. This cake is even better the next day cold and believe it or not, it's wonderful right out of the freezer! I can't wait to make it again!

I converted this to Gluten Free by just adding a teaspoon and a half of xanthum gum to my gluten-free flour of equal amounts to the recipe and it was a hit.  Non-gluten-free eaters loved the cake!  They did know and couldn't tell it was GF.  Thank you!

This is a delicious cake. It gets 5 stars on taste and ease. I've brought it to many homes and often get a, "Did you make this?" I work at a school and it's a hit with the staff for a Monday morning treat. Next time I will add cinnamon to the sugar infusion mixture.

Made this for my birthday, and my boyfriend (who doesn't really like cake) had three big pieces and finished it off!
It holds great in the fridge and reheats amazingly.
I expected it to be really rich and decadent, but it was actually pretty light. 
Because it's a really dense cake, I would recommend creaming the butter and sugar first.

Very delicious.I didn't have buttermilk so I just mixed 2 cubes of butter with warm 2% milk  and added 1/2 cup less sugar to the batter and creamed all the wet ingredients first. Also instead of a bunt mold I used a loaf pan (which makes 2 loaves).  It tastes like pound cake, which I've never made before but if I ever do want to make a pound cake this will be my go-for recipe.  My parents really liked the recipe too. (: (P.s add cinnamon to the butter sauce)

This cake left me speechless! I've been doing allrecipes for over a decade and I don't know that I've ever come across a recipe where I didn't feel the need to change something.  It's so easy it will come out perfect even if you've never baked before.  I left mine in the oven for 70 minutes but I have an electric oven and it just seems to need longer for baking so just know your oven. I also only used half the glaze. It's so sweet. I used lots of butter to grease the pan. I think that might be responsible for the perfectly brown color of the cake. I'm telling you this cake couldn't have been more perfect.

Instead of a bundt or round cake pans I opted for loaf pans and it made two. I also added 2 tsp of butter extract to batter and frosting for extra buttery-goodness. This is almost a pound cake and so moist. I am "definitely " making this over and over for many years to come. This was easy to whip up and have ready for any family gathering or in my case, hubby had a sweet-tooth attack last night so I got up at 1 am and by 8 am it was ready for a tall glass of cold milk and hubby' s sweet-tooth. Definitely give this recipe two thumbs up and will be sharing this with anyone willing to give it a go. Thank you to whoever posted this wonderful recipe,  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
Hugs from Texas

**Important:::: you need fairly big holes- you don't want the sauce to soak in, you want it to POUR in. The complaints about it being like cornbread tell me the sauce did not get into the cake the right way.***Very good; moist and rich. Be sure you ONLY use butter- no substitutions. I used half salted, half unsalted. Remember you can pour a tablespoon of cider vinegar in your measuring cup, the add milk to make the cup to sub for buttermilk.  Used my cheese thermometer to poke the holes. If you have a choice of Bundt sizes ( I have several), use a larger pan, it will make the glazing step easier. I used the small pan for a taller cake and cake was higher than the side of the pan, glazing took a while!

This cake was amazing!  I had rave reviews from my guests.  So...she who never likes it when folks change a recipe and then review it, did exactly that.
The OCD in me would not allow me to "not" cream the butter and sugar 1st.  So that's what I did.  
And just to add a little extra flavor I put 1 tsp. of rum in the batter of the cake - and in the butter sauce I replaced two of the tbsp. of water with rum. I followed the advice of another user and used a pastry brush to put on the butter sauce to it would soak in a little better.   It was very, very moist and delicious with just a bit of crunch!

I did not like this cake at all! the majority of the cake stuck to the pan and was a crumbled mess. What I did taste of it reminded me of cornbread and not cake which was not what i expected. I will not be making this recipe again.

Wonderful!  I've made this about 4 times since I found the recipe a couple of weeks ago. Haven't change a thing except to make a little extra sauce with it today.

To sweet, needs a different flavoring.  With Lemon flavoring it was much better.

I would never have believed that dumping all the ingredients in one bowl and beating for three minutes would produce an edible pound cake. Well, I made this cake yesterday exactly as the recipe called for, and now I'm a believer! Turned out perfectly...so moist and delicious. LOVE it!

This cake is absolutely delicious!!!  I used the Butter Sauce just as the recipe is written for the mini bundt cakes (like bigger muffins). The last half of the cake batter was baked in a small bundt pan.  I added fresh lemon juice to the remaining Butter Sauce and the family flipped over that one.  They loved the regular Butter Sauce but chose the lemon flavored as their favorite.  At any rate, I'm very grateful for this recipe ... it's wonderful!!!  Thank you, Suzanne!

Simple but elegant. Moist, buttery and sweet. Made miniature bundt cakes. Topped them with sifted powdered sugar, but you could use custard, berries or cream for alternative toppings. Very good recipe. I'd make it again and again.

This is pretty close to a typical pound cake recipe except that it is much lighter, less dense than pound cakes.  Its tenderness is between a pound cake and a birthday-type cake.  I really like it.

Made cake exactly as recipe calls, except used almond extract instead of vanilla.  The cake was done in 45 minutes, much longer than the indicated 60 minutes, and I realized that I baked it at 350 instead of 325. Needless to say, it was more than golden brown so the cake was probably dryer than it should be, based on everyone's comments that it is so moist.  So I'm going to try it again but bake it at the correct temp next time.

The flavor of the cake is excellent.  I worried about the butter sauce making the cake too sweet but added it anyway. The next day, the cake was perfectly sweet!  The parts if the cake with butter sauce are a nice surprise to the rest of the cake.  I don't think it would be a good idea to saturate too much of the cake with butter sauce because this contrast is nice. 

I didn't have any problems taking the cake out of the pan despite using a pan that is NOT nonstick.  I sprayed it with Pam and made sure there were no puddles of oil.  Then I floured it well.  While the cake was cooling, I took a butter knife and worked it around the sides and middle of the pan to loosen the cake from the pan.  With a bit of wobbling, the cake popped right out.

Definitely a keeper!!

I made this cake and it's great. I did make a change however in the butter sauce, instead of water I used a good bourbon. It does not overpower the cake's flavor, it enhances it. This would be perfect for Derby Day dessert.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday one year and he LOVED it! Now I have to make it every year! I was trying to find a similar recipe to a berry cake we had at Bravo! one time, and this hit the spot! It is perfectly dense, moist and not too sweet. I buy a frozen berry mix, add a little sugar, warm it up in the microwave and serve it over this cake with vanilla ice cream - it's to die for!

I've made this cake 3 times in the past 3 weeks to rave reviews every time. Friends and family have asked for the recipe, and my husband says I should make one every week from now on. :O) The cake is moist, delicious, and very easy to make with only basic ingredients. Butter cake is wonderful because it has a perfect flavor on its own, but also will hold a variety of other flavor mix-ins or toppings (strawberries, cream, pecans, orange, etc., the sky is the limit). My favorite so far is to add fresh strawberries and whipped cream on top. When making this cake, I do use the traditional steps of first creaming butter and sugar together, then adding eggs, then alternately adding dry ingredients and buttermilk, and finishing with vanilla. I get perfect results and just can't bring myself to do it any other way. If you are looking for a tried-and-true perfect butter cake, just stop here and start making this one!!

I was looking for a late night snack as I was feeling slightly peckish. This is the best cake I have had in a long while. Unfortunately I did not have a couple of the ingredients available when I made it so I substituted the following: 

- Maple Syrup instead of Vanilla at "double quantity" (4 Teaspoons),
- Skim Milk instead of Buttermilk (I do not care for Buttermilk),
- 1 Cup of Brown and White Sugar instead of all White,
- Did not use the "Butter Sauce" (Cake was moist enough without it),
- Sprinkled some Brown Sugar on the Top (Mostly Aesthetic Detail),

Fantastic choice, cake came out great was gone by the next day.

I used 1 pint of heavy cream to make fresh butter and used it all in this cake. The vanilla was doubled and I cut back to 3 eggs. I did not make the sauce. Heavenly taste. Gone in one night.

I made this cake (from a recipe on Big Oven that was exactly the same) and it is great.  It has great color and a lot of butter flavor.  I've made it five times in the last 3 weeks.  The recipe from the other site suggests rum flavor or vanilla extract.  I plan to try that for a change of pace.

This cake is amazing.  It is moist, easy, beautiful, and tasty.  I don't know about you, but those are my criteria.  I baked it in a Bundt pan and it came out wonderfully.  It rose very nicely and cooked to a nice golden brown.  My family ate it in 3 days (a record!) and I'm going to try it as cupcakes today.  This one goes in the permanent family recipe folder.  This is my new 'go to' yellow cake.

I mad a few little changes added cinnamon to the sauce, and used a little whole wheat flour with the white. Made into cupcakes and stuck them allover with a skewer and poured the sauce over and in the holes. My husband devoured these, thank you for the awesome recipe.

Absolutely delicious!! Didn't change a thing in the recipe ingredients, only change I made was to throw all ingredients at 
once in my kitchen aid mixer and mixed for the 3 minutes as suggested in the directions. Baked beautifully, oh and I did use pam spray for baking, worked perfectly. Thanks for this wonderful recipe, will be making this a lot. Can't wait to try it with some other flavor extracts as some other viewers have mentioned!!

This recipe is perfection. I served it at my restaurant and it was a hit! The only thing i did different was I used milk instead of buttermilk (didnt have any any on hand) and added 1 Tbsp of Apple Cider Vinegar to make a sweet buttermilk. Very Very Tasty!

Fantastic cake!! this is great for those who are not huge chocolate fans and for those who just love cake =) I made the recipe as listed and it came out dashingly. it was moist and I swear it tasted even better after a few days. although it is yummy w/o topping I will sometimes use a simple brown strudel topping to "dress" it up a bit. A must try for the novice OR experienced baker. ***Side Note***. If you're using a bundt pan for best results prepare it properly via butter spray with the flour already in it  then use a pastry brush to spread it in the Pan envenly to avoid "puddles"  of spray and soggy spots on your cake.  HAppy baking

Tried this quick and easy recipe. However, will use 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of l teaspoon. I could taste the salt.  Otherwise it was a very good cake as far as the texture the quickness of prepartion.

My whole family and even the neighbor kids loved this cake!! The only thing I will do differently next time is check the cake at 45 mins. Sixty minutes was too long in my oven. The cake was crumbly, but otherwise this recipe is a keeper!

I received a new bundt cake pan for Christmas this year so I was searching for a new recipe to try. I picked this one based on previous reviews and made it for myself, it was amazing! This cake is very moist and the butter sauce was great soaked into it. I will definitely make this again, my boyfriend and kids just loved it!!!

This is a delicious, moist and not too sweet recipe. It paired nicely with a Moscato wine I had.  I added cinnamon to the butter sauce as suggested by another reviewer and it was great.  The cinnamon added a little depth to the recipe.  I plan on doubling the butter sauce next time so the entire cake can absorb it better.

This butter cake was a hit at my husband's work. Instead of using a bundt pan, I used mini loaf pans because I wanted everyone to have their own little cake. After greasing a flouring the pans, I also used a cinnamon sugar mix and drizzled it into the pans. I found that the drizzle gave the cake a hint of sweetness. I read that some people had a problem with the cake being a little dry and I found that my cake stayed super moist and might be from using the mini loaf pans. I followed one of the reviewers suggestion and added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the icing/syrup and it definitely made a difference. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

ron liked it. i felt it needed strawberries with juice to moisten it. good flavor but when the sauce hardened, it was glued to the bottom of the cakeplate. maybe flip the cake then pour sauce over so it's on the top

ABSOLUTELY delish!!!!!!! I sorta messed up the prep directions.. cause i creamed the sugar and butter for like 7 mins.. and then realised that those weren't the instructions.. So then i sorta just added everything else.. and last the eggs one at a time beating btwn each addition. The cake was lovely. I also did reduce the sugar for my family's own tastes.. and added just a tiny dash of cinnamon.. as per my D.I.L's request. It was light, with a nice soft, fine crumb.. will def make again!

This is EXCELLENT!  Buttery, moist, sweet, rich and fattening, but excellent!  Made exactly as written.  I had no trouble getting it out of the pan so not sure why others did.  Definitely something I wouldn't make on a regular basis, but delicious just the same!

Delicious, moist -- best made with buttermilk but vinegar/milk substitute suggested elsewhere works well enough. I always replace the water in the butter sauce with Irish whiskey. Rum or bourbon would also be good here. I've also sometimes replaced half of the white sugar with light brown sugar, and that's good, too!

OMG I love this recipe.. its one of those -don't even think about the calories and enjoy- cakes!  I've also 1/2 the recipe and made in a bread pan and served like a pound cake.  One tip.. let the cake air dry for a while so the syrup gets a slight crust to it.. adds a nice texture like a glazed donut.. so yummy!

I've made this cake for over 35 years, since my Mom gave me a cookbook with the recipe in it. My grown kid's have passed on the recipe to their families. It will stay moist for a week, if you are lucky enough to keep it that long.  Never happenend at my house:) I gave it 4 stars, because the original sauce recipe calls for 2 tsps of Rum Flavoring.  The vanilla is optional. Also, I have made it substituting half the liquid with 1/2cup sour cream and 1/2 cup milk.

YUM! Being someone that loves to bake I reverted to the old fashioned baking trends and creamed my butter and sugar.  I then added one egg at a time blending after each.  I combined all the dry ingredients and added it to the batter alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.  I have to say this cake isn’t much to look at but the taste and moistness make up for that.  Next time I might try using a tube pan as the top before inverting this cake had a beautiful golden butter split. Not sure how I’m going to do the glaze but I hate to lose the beautiful top, I’ll let you know what I come up with. Again YUM!!!

Not as moist as most Butter Cake recipes.  Easy to make, however.

I made this cake for the first time and brought it to work. (I know... very risky, lol)   Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe! Its my new favorite! It turned out so light and moist. Some bundt cakes are just too heavy and dense but not this one!  I did do so a couple of things differently, however. Here they are: 1) It didn't specify but I was sure to use unsalted butter.  2) all I had left was cake and pastry so I used 3 cups of it instead of all purpose. This may have accounted for its wonderful texture. 3) I wanted a lemon poppy seed cake so I simply added 2 tablespoons of lemon zest, and 4 tablespoons of poppy seeds.  4) I totally omitted the butter sauce, It was not at all necessary.  It was awesome with a cup of tea! Next time I might try using orange zest and see how that turns out :)

Excellent! Very moist. The directions were easy especially for a novice baker. Key point: make sure you blend the dry ingredients extremely well separate from the wet ingredients or you may have a few bitter bites in the cake. It also always room for adding extra things like chocolate chips or berries and it doesn't alter the batter   All in all very good recipe.

GREAT!  Really good, I made it exactly as the recipe called and it came out perfectly.  This is delicious, moist, you'll love this if you like sweet cakes with more of a vanilla, plain flavor.  This would be great with strawberries and whipped cream.

Perfect, perfect recipe!  We've been trying to find a moist and delicious cake recipe for ages!  This one is a keeper!  We halved the recipe (because we kept making horrible cakes and didn't want to waste any more ingredients) and put it in a square Pyrex pan to bake instead of a bunt pan.  Watched it in the oven.  Had to give it an extra few minutes I believe.  It came out absolutely perfect!!  My oldest wants it for his birthday cake already!  And that's not until March!   Next time I'm going to try it without the butter sauce and with a butter cream frosting instead and see how it goes.  From the looks of it it'll be just as moist and as wonderful as the original.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Delish!!! Wonderful flavor and moist. No more box cakes for me. Only changes I made was I used 1 tablespoon vanilla and 1 tsp butter extract. This cake does tend to stick to the pan but using Baker's Joy the second time worked perfect. Cake fell right out of the pan. Will absolutely be making this again and again. Thanks!

Made this to take to a dinner party.  WOW!  This was a hit.  Melt in your mouth, rich buttery flavor.  The only downside to this cake is it disappears too fast!

Excellent recipe! Even though I did have to reduce the butter, since I was using a toffee topping. I'm not that experienced when it comes to baking, so, please, how DO you measure butter? Do you melt it, or just wait till it's softer?   Thanks for the great recipe! :)

This is an awesome basic recipe.  I almost didnt make the butter sauce but in the end I am glad I did.  Maybe next time add some chocolate chips or a caramel sauce .. regardless.. it is a great starting point!

I've made this cake twice now. My family absolutely LOVES it! It's very rich but still moist. Even without the butter sauce. I'll try to make photo's next time.

Great cake.  I've been making it for a couple years now and eveyone loves it.  I use a 16oz container of sour cream instead of buttermilk.  I also added a package of vanilla pudding mix.  In my gas oven, I cook it for exactly 1 hr & 10 min.  It's perfectly cooked each time.  Let the cake completely cool before taking it out the pan or it will stick because of the butter sauce.

Love this cake, unfortunately, my husband didn't like it very much, and he is the big cake eater in the family. Next time I make this, it will be for a rather large gathering.  Thank you for sharing.  Delicious!

This was a good cake if you like a slight cornbread flavor. My husband has a real sweet tooth but this was not a winner for him.  Two of my 4 kids liked it.  The other 2 didn't like it due to the cornbread flavor. The parts drenched in butter were great but the rest was a little too much like cornbread for my taste.

The cake its just ok, I Had to make three times before i could get it just right! or at least to my satisfaction. I added one more egg, a whole tablespoon of vanilla extract, zest of an orange. I reduced the buttermilk to a 1/2 C + 1/4 C Orange Juice and 1/4 C Milk. I melted the butter and added it last.

This may be the best yellow cake I've ever made. Very nice, classic crumb and incredible buttery moistness that the sauce imparts made this a huge hit at my last gathering. You MUST give this one a try!

This is so good!  My husband said its not worth the calories to him, but it definitely is to me...I'm about to sneak back for a second helping :) The glaze is the best part. Probably wouldn't double it, though.  Thanks for the great recipe, Suzanne!

Just put all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well.  I used the large end of a wooden skewer and made the holes bigger by agitating the skewer after it is inserted.  I put about 40 holes, doubled the sauce, and added cinnamon to it.  This cake is the bomb!  And it's easy.  Make. This. Cake!

If you like moist, dense cake this is for you. Very easy to make and looks good on display. I think the poking of the holes is the tricky part and when I make this cake again I will use a bambo skewer and make a bunch of little holes instead of using the handle of the wooden spoon which makes for bigger holes that the sauce pools up in.  Another reviewer suggested saving a little sauce for glazing the top once it's upright.  Great idea--it made it nice and shiny.  This cake was GONE by the end of the evening!

Love this recipe. I make it in a 13x9 pan and love it. As soon as it comes out of the oven I fork the top of the cake and pour on the hot butter sauce. Everyone raves about it each time I bake it. Definitely a winner, especially for potlucks and church fellowships!

I've been reading this recipe for the past two weeks. I finally decided to give it a go at it. WOW! This is my first boxless cake and it came out perfect!!  It is sooooo pretty. I doubled the butter sauce.  Also, I add'd some sour cream. Not sure how much. The taste, MMMMM good. My Mom is working on her 2nd piece. I'm going to add some pictures. This is must try. Even for 1st timers such as myself.

This had amazing flavor!  It was beautiful, and very tender.  Almost TOO tender...it began to crumble a bit as we sliced it.  Really good with the butter glaze, though I might try a citrus version next time.    I was thinking, would an extra egg help it hold together a bit better?

What a delicious cake.  It is a very light, tender cake with a rich buttery flavor.  I ended up having to make two of these because the first one fell apart.  I used a "rose" shaped bundt pan, and I think it was just too tender for that type of pan.  When I baked it in a traditional bundt pan, it came out perfectly.  I think I might try to double the glaze next time.

We loved this cake! Followed the recipe, except sprayed pan well with Bakers Joy spray and let it cool 45 minutes in pan. It came out perfect. Would not change a thing.

Good recipe!  My changes: replaced 1/2 c. all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour for added healthiness (couldn’t taste the difference); used 1 T. cider vinegar plus enough milk to equal one cup in place of buttermilk; added almond extract and extra vanilla extract to the batter; for butter sauce, replaced water with Kentucky bourbon and added a splash of almond extract.  Per others’ reviews, I doubled the sauce, but as I ended up only using around half of it anyway, I really don’t think it needs to be doubled—my cake still came out very moist.  In my attempt to reduce this recipe’s calories, I replaced some (no more than 1/3) of the butter in both the batter and the sauce with margarine, and it tasted fine.

I made this cake twice in one night. The first time it came out dry, even after cooking it for only 40 minutes. I thought, well, I have a convection oven, perhaps its my doing as convections cook faster and I frequently lower the recommended cooking temp by about 25 degrees and reduce the time by at least five minutes when baking. I also didn't care for the butter sauce, as it seemed too grainy for me, although I cooked it on low and stirred and stirred, as I didn't want it to boil, just too grainy. I should have used my fine baker's sugar or just go with 10X sugar. Well, it turns out, my cake failure was due because I can't read (joke). For some reason, I only put in half the butter. So, after laughing at myself, I baked the cake again. I watched the cake like a hawk, and after about 30/35 minutes, the cake was of course still not quite done. After 40 minutes, it was completely done. I did bake at 325 in a cast aluminum bundt pan. Perhaps waiting for the cake to cool (10 minutes before taking it out) it "cooked" more causing some dryness. I know heavy bundt pans hold heat, so again, perhaps my fault again. I did use a different sauce on the second cake from Cook's Illustrated, a lemon sauce that I enjoyed much better. I will try this cake again and make baking adjustments accordingly.

This is my first taste of a butter cake so I'm not sure what it's supposed to be. As a stand-alone cake, it's not overly flavorful but that must be what "butter cake" is, according to the other reviews. It would be delish w/fruit & whipped cream-can definately see that combo for this cake! The texture is great & it's a pretty cake but leaves a greasy coating in your mouth. The butter sauce, in my opinion, is pretty tasteless-maybe confectioners sugar would be a better choice??

UPDATE:  I made this cake last night for a work Christmas party.  I used 2 % milk and it was just as good.  Everyone had a slice of cake and I got rave reviews.  Thank you
-----------------------------------------------
Made this cake exactly as written and it was the bomb!  Everyone loved it.  I baked the cake for 50 minutes and it was very moist.  Will make again.  THANK YOU

This cake was really good, my mom really loved it and it was easy to make. The only thing I will do different next time is poke bigger holes because the butter sauce didn't really soak into the cake. I will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe!

This was a very moist and rich cake. I followed the recipe for the most part...I used regular milk instead of buttermilk. I also used Country Crock Light butter since the recipe does call for quite a bit of butter. I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the sauce recipe and used half of it for a topping. I also used a microwaveable bowl with a pouring spout to heat up the sauce ingredients. It was a lot less clean up than using a saucepan. Yummy! Will fix again!

Delish!!  My family usually doesn't like cakes without some kind of frosting, but this was a big hit in our house!!  It was very easy to make.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan and poked holes in it after it came out of the oven.  After allowing it to cool just a bit, I poured the butter sauce over the whole top of the cake.  It soaked right in, making a cake that was super moist, buttery, just wonderful! It came easily out of the pan at serving time, too. This is now one of my very favorite, most-requested cakes.  Thank you for a perfect recipe!

Very moist and not too buttery.  My husband made this (which means it was very easy to make!) and he reserved a small amount of the butter sauce to pour over the cake after he took it out of the pan.  It was delicious!

Not overly impressive. The cake was good and moist, but the butter sauce was very grainy because of the sugar.I think next time I will reduce the amount of sugar in the sauce, and try using powdered sugar instead, that will make it smoother. also, it is not a stand alone cake, it truly needs some glaze drizzled on top, or perhaps a dusting of powdered sugar??

This cake is a cross between a pound cake and a butter cake.  Plan to make this cake a day in advance because it  tastes better and more moist the 2nd day and the 3rd day.  I really love it.

WOW! Cutting into this cake is like cutting into butter, or like my mom said, like cutting into ice cream! So moist and smooth. I thought it was a bit too sweet, but no one else seemed to mind. I made it as a base for butterscotch apple upside down cake. I baked the whole thing in a large ovenproof sauce pan. Oh myyy it is the perfect base cake for that!! I tried it with Suzannes butter cake(from this site), as good as it was, it couldnt even compare to this one!! I made the cake exactly as written except for the apple part, and choice of bakeware. Thanks so much for this recipe, it is exactly what I've been looking for for so long!

It's good, but not the best. I have made much better cakes on this website. Honestly, it is thick kind of like a poundcake but without the flavor of a poundcake. Also, it was a little dry.

This is been my family's birthday cake for over 40 years.  We do separate the wet and dry ingredients when we mix it and we beat it for several minutes after each egg, otherwise it doesn't turn out right.

This was a good cake, but the glaze was a too sweet. I think that next time I would just put a chocolate glaze on top because the actual cake had nice texture and taste. I did not make any changes. Note that I never seem to have buttermilk on hand, so I just added 1 Tablespoon of white vinegar to 1 cup of milk.

Made this cake today.And as I always do,followed the recipe as written.Had no problem with it sticking to pan (and used only Pam cooking spray).This is a BUTTER cake,or in other words,a down home missing your mama or grandma's cooking type of cake.If you want gourmet,then you are looking at the wrong recipe!It's a delicious and moist cake(even without the butter sauce).Would'nt change a thing!!!

I tried this recipe and got rave reviews!  It was super yummy and moist and delicious!  I made this cake for my dad's birthday, he says that box cakes are a waste of time and wanted something homemade.  He said that you can never go wrong with a bundt cake.  He wanted a chocolate bundt cake so I found this recipe and kicked it up a notch!  Just add 3/4 cup cocoa powder to the flour, then I added about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter. Baked it as required and then I made a chocolate glaze to go on top.  You will love this version it is really good with a scoop of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream on top!  Yummy!

Ok this was sooo yummy! The only changes I made were that I ran out of sugar and had to use 1/4 brown sugar, which was pretty good. I did follow other reviewers advice and cream the butter and sugar, then add the eggs and vanilla, then I just dumped in the rest. I think the butter sauce recipe is enough as is, doubled would be too much. I know I'll be making this again, I loved it!

This cake was scrumptious!!  I made it for Mother's Day along with some homemade vanilla ice cream and it was the best! (I also doubled the butter sauce like others recommended.)  The only other thing I would do different is that I would invert the pan while it was still a little warm - not completely cold.  I had a hard time removing it from my faceted bundt pan and had to reheat it a little in the oven to loosen the butter sauce.  Other than that, perfect!  Will definitely make again and again.

This has been my daughter's favorite cake for the past 4 years... I always have to make it for her birthday!  I add cinnamon to both the cake and glaze, make certain not to overcook it, and always serve with either fresh ripe strawberries (sliced in a bowl with sugar to make juicy) or a frozen berry mixture with sugar in the winter months.  Dollop whipped cream and a mint sprig and it's beautiful!

Great cake!  I thought that it was a little too dry and crumbly without the glaze.  You have to make sure that the glaze is well distributed or else (like most cakes with a sauce)!  I liked the flavor and richness, but no one else seemed to enjoy and the usual "this tastes really good" was missing after eveyone had a piece.  So although I like the flavor of this cake, I think I am going to have to bump it down to four stars because it did not seem to hold together very well and was not received well by others.  I made this cake in a round casserole-type and a square dish as I didn't have a bundt pan.

This was my first cake baking adventure! It came out great and people were really surprised that it was my first cake. :) I used two 9-inch pans instead of the single bunt. I iced with some store bought icing since I thought the actual cake was enough novelty for one day. Um... five stars 'cause even a beginner with no electric mixer (wooden spoon, anyone?) and a bit of patience can have success!

This cake is awesome!! It's the butter sauce drizzled over it that really makes it.  One time I doubled the sauce...it was to die for!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  Definitely cool completely in the pan.  Great served with homemade whipped cream!

WOW exceptional cake.
I did as another reviewer said and made 1 1/2 times the syrup mixture. Also creamed butter and sugar mixed well for 5 minutes then added I egg at a time.Hubby raved over it and thats saying a lot. I may double the syrup next time. Everyone wanted the recipe.
Thanks for a great cake

This is so good I have made it twice ths week!  And there are only two of us in the house!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I added blueberries and had to use almond flavoring in the butter sauce because I ran out of vanilla.  It still turned out great!  I will make this many times - it is a great recipe.

This was a very good cake, but not the best.  It was fairly quick and easy to make.  I wanted to make my mom a traditional-looking birthday cake, so I used two square cake pans instead of the bundt pan, which worked out great to my surprise.  I also topped it with a butter cream frosting instead of the butter sauce.

this cake was very good however the sauce did not pour thru cake easily and became crunchy. I did pook holes but I guess the needed to be extra large holes. Will try again.

I LOVED this recipe. Its a very simple cake, but it has an amazing buttery flavor. I added some rum to the butter sauce and also poured some of it on top of the cake once I had taken it out of the Bundt pan. It looked and tasted great.

This cake is fabulous - and great to make when you don't have a lot of "fancy" ingredients in the house and people are on thier way. It always goes over great! I usually add some cinnamon sugar on top - and then streak it with hot fudge sauce.

I followed the directions to the letter but the cake fell during the last 10 minutes of baking by the time it cooled it was dry and crumbly. The sauce did not soak in far enough to moisten the cake. However,I did like the buttery taste. I may try again after a bit of fine tuning.

Very good, as written. I needed something to use up the rest of a box of cake flour and this worked. I did increase the amounts of vanilla, I also used extra butter flavoring and a shot of whiskey in the butter sauce instead of water....YUMMY, definitely a keeper and everyone thinks so.

Awesome! I have a Rum Cake recipe that is very similar.  In that recipe you sprinkle chopped pecans in the pan before you pour the batter in.  I am going to do that the next time as it does give the cake a finished look and it tastes good too. Also for hole making, a kebob skewer works great, the wooden spoon handle tends to tear up the cake.

This recipe was very easy to make and everyone in my family loved it. I used the end of a wooden spoon to make about 7 holes in the cake to pour in the butter sauce.  Next time I will probably make 10 or 12 holes.  I also poured the sauce around the edges of the cake while it was still in the pan.  Someone mentioned that the cake was better the next day, and I agree with that.  I personally thought it was a little (just a little) dry, but no one else in the family thought so.

This cake was fabulously rich.  The family  
liked it very much.  Mine took 75 minutes to bake though.  It could have been that I used a silicon bundt pan.  I don't know but it was worth the wait.

This recipe was very tasty. Everyone in my house raved that it was great. It was gone in two days! I did make a slight change: I didn't have any baking soda,( which there is not a substitute for so I omitted the baking soda but instead used 3c. 6T. of cake flour. The cake came out just fine.

This recipe was easy to follow and produced a fairly good cake. It was more of a pound cake to me not as moist and gooey as other Butter Cakes that I have tasted. (I did make one error, I used bleached flour rather than the unbleached that the recipe asked for.) I plan to make it again with the unbleached flour.

This was OUTSTANDING!  I made a rare (but smart) move and didn't change a thing.  Exactly what I was looking for and even better than I expected, which is saying a lot because I'm kind of picky.  Would be great with strawberries and whipped cream...can't wait til summer to find out!

Over a 4-week period, I baked 4 cakes and brought them to church for coffee hour. At the end of the 4 weeks, I asked everyone to vote on which one they liked best. This one won, hands down!! It is surprisingly "light" in texture for a cake so rich! I always get requests for this recipe whenever I make it.

the cake itself is good, kind of like a sugarcookie, but with the butter sauce it tasted like a sweet pancake while still warm.. I didn't like it... still I made real whipped cream and sliced strawberries to top it off... I wont make it again though.. something just isn't right, if you want a great homemade cake try "Aunt Johnnie's Pound Cake" no matter who I make that for it dissapears within 2 days.. this cake was around for an entire week

I can't rate this as I only made the cake, not the sauce.  I only wanted a cake recipe and frosted it with sour cream frosting.  It's a very dense cake with not a lot of flavor.  I'll eat it, but won't make it again.

Fabulous!! It’s not very often you find a recipe that you make all the time & this is defiantly one of them. Everyone loves it!  Great texture, flavor, super moist & above all easy!!! Thanks for the great recipe!! It’s perfect just the way it is but once in a while I’ll add a coffee cake filling (brown sugar, cinnamon, nuts & butter) to the center & baked an extra 5min.

O my Goodness!! I would not change a thing! This was so yummy. Like a really great, buttery pound cake. It was good hot, right after the hot butter sauce was poured on and even lastd a few days in our house covered on a cake plate with a glass lid and was juts as good from first bite to last. I will be making this cake all the time! (well it is high in claories so maybe not all the time as it is so good I just have to eat it, but, a lot!:)  )

This cake was disappointing.  In a good homemade cake, you should be able to taste the ingredients, and no one ingredient should be so overpowering that the delicacy of the cake is lost.  In this recipe all you taste is sugar and butter. It doesn't taste *bad*, but to spend the time to make a homemade cake and then not have it be something special is a huge disappointment.  This cake would be good for kids and people without discerning taste.  But gourmet it isn't. It tastes not unlike a boxed cake with butter/sugar poured on top.

Fantastic!  After reading other reviews I was concerned that I may have problems getting the cake out of the pan, but I cooled it for about an hour before trying and it popped out perfectly.  I used the recipe quantity of butter sauce, which I found was enough.  1 hour cooking time was also perfect and cake was not dry.  I cooked this for my husband and some friends to have after dinner and everyone loved it.  I probably won't make it too often though due to the high fat content, but still great for an occasional indulgence.

I used a 9x13 baking dish and it turned out wonderfully! I baked it for about 40 minutes. In order to cover the holes, I spread a strussel (spelling?) crumble on top. To make the strussel, I food processed butter, sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Just adjust the strussel ingredients to your specific flavor preferences. Very Delicious!!! Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  Everytime I make it someone asks me for the recipe.  From experience I have found to slowly pour the syrup into the holes.  Otherwise a lot runs off to the side.  That is the best part of this cake.  You don't want to lose any of it.

Instead of the Vanilla Extract try adding Imitation Vanilla Butter & Nut Flavor by McCormick.  This gives it an extra little twist to the flavoring. This can be hard to find, but well worth the effort!!

Old fashioned goodness,the house smelled so wonderful while this was baking and the family loved it. I did mix the ingre. in a more traditional manner as another reviewer suggested and I added sweet sherry to the mix as well as substituted it for the water in the glaze---delicious! Only thing I would do different next time is double the glaze recipe and perhaps use kentucky bourbon in place of the sherry as it is a kentucky cake.Thanks for a great new family tradition dessert.

Fabulous! My husband is not a cake eater and he had three slices. My kids loved it. I did listen to the other advice and added some cinnamon to the sauce. I also made 1 1/2 times the sauce and it was perfect. By the way I as someone else mentioned always use bakers joy, it is wonderful, and my baked items never ever stick. I live in Toronto and it is not available here so I bring in 20 cans at a time. This cake is wonderful I will definately be making it again.

This was too dense for me.  My husband thought it was better chilled.  I won't be making it again.

I can't say enough about this cake. It's fabulous! My husband thinks the sauce would be better with rum, and I agree.

My cake didn't exactly come out "moist and buttery." It came out more hard and dry, like a biscuit.  I baked it in a cake pan and also in a mini muffin tray and I spooned the sauce over the muffins. Although the results weren't as I imagined, they were still yummy.  But this recipe sure does require a lot of sugar!

This cake was very moist and tender. I loved the butter sauce and so did my family - they finished the cake so quickly.  I did not have a bundt pan so I used cake tins and it worked just fine.  Next time I may add a little lemon juice to the sauce for some extra flavor.

Really easy to make with a wonderful moist, buttery taste.  Note:  Let the cake cool COMPLETELY before releasing from pan.  Mine was still a little bit warm and it broke apart in two messy pieces.  Of course, no one cared and ate it just the same.  Thanks for a great recipe, Suzanne!

Super moist and delicious. I took the advice of others here and doubled the sauce and poured it over the top of the cake, too, but I thought that made it too sugary. It gave the cake a grainy appearance which I tried to overcome with a sprinkling of toasted almonds. It wasn't so pretty. Next time, I'll stick to the original recipe. The cake itself was really a hit.

I was searching for my 'first' poundcake to make, ever, when I came across this one.  It turned out SO tasty, and my family all loved it.  I didn't have butter, but used butter flavored shortening, and it still was great.  My only change will be to use half the sauce on the bottom, then after it is cooled, I will re-heat and pour sauce over the top, too. Thank you, from a Kentucky Resident!

Thank you Suzanne for graciously sharing this fabulous cake recipe. Making it was so easy, baking it was incredible, my house smelled amazing (if I ever sell my house I will have this cake in the oven during open houses, lol). I loved the idea of poking holes in the cake to add the butter sauce (which is also incredible). My husband and kids LOVED it, in fact they even helped me get it together for the oven. I highly recommend trying this cake if you are looking for a simple, easy, rich, delicious cake to bake!

Yum, yum, yum.  I'm making this cake for the second time in about 2 weeks.  I made it for a special occasion and served it with scoops of vanilla ice cream.  I think the next time, though, I'll try adding a little cinnamon, as others have suggested.  It's awesome anyway you do it, though, I'm sure.

In the short period of time since I printed out this recipe I have used it over a dozen times!!!  It is the perfect all around cake.  Kids love it, people who are not usually cake eaters love it because it is not too sweet.  Thank you for this treasure added to my most love recipe file.

I've tried to make this twice, and my mom tried to make it once, and every time the cake falls (in a bundt pan). We are wondering if it's the altitude tho we are only at about 2,000 ft. We made pudding cake out of it. That was good but would like to try it not-fallen!

All I needed to make this recipe was a large mixing bowl and an electric mixer!
It is one of the easiest and the yummiest cake to bake.  I didn't have buttermilk and 
substitute with sour cream and worked just great!  Next time, I am planning to skip 
butter sauce and add green tea powder to make Japanese green tea cake.

This cake is so delicious, that everyone who has tasted it wants the receipe.  So far one of my co-workers to whom I gave the receipe has brought in two cakes to the office and it goes really quickly.  It is fast to make and a GREAT HIT.  Thanks very much.

I added a little Kentucky bourbon into the sauce you pour over the cake.  Replaced 2 T of water with it.  So good!

This is a super simple, super moist, buttery delicious cake.  It is  perfect any time of the day. I doubled the amount of glaze, and in my opinion, it was just right.  Got rave reviews.

this is my go-to. 

Add a shot and a half of bourbon to the heated sugar/butter pour over mixture, trust me.

I love the simplicity of this recipe - I made it exactly as written, including the mixing instructions.  I was definitely skeptical not first creaming the butter and sugar but it turned out wonderfully and the prep was quick.  The flavor of this cake is just incredible - moist and buttery in the most perfect way.  I will definitely make this again and look forward to experiment using other reviewers’ suggestions.

This cake is just right. Not sweet. Pair it with an ice cold glass of milk ! I love that the outside of the cake gets a little crispy after baking. Great recipe!

Started baking about a year ago.  This was one of the first recipes I tired.  After baking all kinds of cakes and cookies I get more requests for the Crazy Butter Cake then I do for anything else I've made.  Last week I made it for some workman as a thank you.  One of the guys asked for the recipe, he doesn't like cake, but he ate two pieces of this cake.  It's a crowd pleasure and a fan favorite.

Incredibly moist and delicious and super easy to make. I added cinnamon to the glaze and used the end of a wooden spoon to poke holes . I would probably chose something a little smaller next time.

The Kentucky Butter cake turned out just as most reviewers described.  It was a lovely and delicious birthday cake for a 12 year old young man.  I  was happy to be able to make it for him and watch him enjoy it.  He didn't eat much of his birthday dinner but he sure gobbled the birthday cake and ice cream.

Added 1 teaspoon lemon extract

Next time:
I will time it better so the sauce is a bit warmer when I pour it on the cake. 

I may add almond extract in place of lemon. (or orange)

I use it as a base for my Rum Cake Experiments with only middling success (the fault of the recipe change, not the cake!)

Excellent flavor, great density, easy to make.  Looking forward to more fun with rum and this Kentucky Butter Cake!

I was very underwhelmed by this cake after reading all the positive reviews. It's not a bad cake, just not the fabulous cake I was expecting. It is more of a pound cake with the butter sauce added to it to moisten it up. I think it would be a good vehicle for strawberries or another topping and whipped cream, but the flavor is very blah on it's own. I even waited until the next day since many reviews say the flavor improves with time. Still disappointing. If I make it again, I will definitely follow reviewers' suggestions to double the sauce. Maybe the extra butter and vanilla will help.

This was delicious and easy to make. I didn't change the ingredients, but changed the order of mixing. I prepared the dry ingredients and set aside (not including sugar). Then I creamed the butter and sugar for 5 min, then added the eggs and beat for another 3 minutes. I added the dry ingredients last. I did not make extra butter sauce and do not feel like it needs it, but if you like a little extra, you could make 1.5 times the sauce and use the extra when you serve it. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Tasted AMAZING! I made this for the birthday monthly at the job. Eveyone loved it. The only change that I made was to switch out the vanilla extract in the cake and water in the butter sauce for Grand Marnier. Everyone was in a much better mood after tasting. THANK YOU!

I did not find any of the problems the "least liked" bakers did, it was moist, mildly flavorful,  not salty or like cornbread at all.  I greased and floured the pan and it only stuck to a very small patch.  I did not wait until it was completely cool to get it out of the pan.  We loved this cake!

I use this recipe for the cake portion of my rum cake so that I don’t have to use cake mix or pudding. For the rum sauce use 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 water, 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup rum.

The only change I made was to add 3 teaspoons of rum to the cake batter and 1 tablespoon of rum to the sauce after removing the saucepan off the stove. Like the other reviewer said, mix the batter only for 3 mins medium speed. My cake was done after 50 mins. Let the cake cool off for 5 mins before pouring half of the sauce. Let the cake cool for 40 more mins, remove from the pan and pour the remaining half to the top of cake. I did not need to double the sauce as there was enough amount and it would have been too sweet if I double the recipe of the sauce.

It was more cake like then dense, heavy pound cake. The cream cheese pound cake recipe is tastier (don't worry it doesn't taste like cream cheese).  The bread tasted doughier than I like.

I had to make no changes at all to the recipe. Just simply follow it, it worked out great. The only thing is to take into consideration the type of pan that is being used, since it took my cake 50 minutes to be complete.

I used two 9 inch round pans instead of the bundt cake pan. Was done in 45 minutes instead of an hour and came out perfect! Poor half the butter sauce on first layer and 2nd half on top layer.

Yes I would make it again. I looked at a lot of the reviews to get suggestions. I made it with chopped pecans and brown sugar streusel in the middle of the cake and also put some on top of the cake before I put it in the oven, which gave it a really good flavor and a crispy top  I decided to put 3 TBSP of Butterscotch Schnapps and l TBSP of Vanilla in the cake instead of just the vanilla. When I made the glaze I also used 3 TBSP Butterscotch Schnapps and 1 TBSP of Vanilla. Turned out great and since everyone said it is better the next day, I am looking forward to eating a slice tomorrow. I also used Pam with Flour spray and had no problems whatsoever of getting the cake released from the pan. I only let it set for about 10 minutes before I removed it to a cake plate.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe because it is perfect the way it is. My friends and family request it all the time and my mom would have it intravenously 24/7 if that was possible. I absolutely love this cake and I've made it at least 20 times within the last five years.

Made this cake and followed the recipe...what a disappointment...stuck to the pan and what did come out was dry, even after putting on the sauce.  Would NOT make this again.  Waste of time and ingredients.

I’ve made this cake several times for family and friends. It is often requested. I like to change it up and add a different glaze and different flavors every now and then. I make the glaze and sometimes make it a buttermilk glaze just add buttermilk. Glaze with peach and Bourbon just add  1 tbsp peach preserves 2-3 tbsp bourbon and add 1 tsp almond extract to both glaze and cake. Different every time and great whether unadulterated or not. This cake can serve as a base to anything or keep as is which is a super easy cake. Happy baking!!

Amazing. I just need to figure out how to get the sauce to infiltrate the cake better. I thought my holes were big enough but it seems not.  i may inject the sauce next time using a syringe.

It's a good cake, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't have that "wow" factor like so many people were commenting about.   I followed the directions and used 2 cake pans, rather than the bundt cake pan.   I didn't have any sticking problems and I had used Pam cooking spray.  I iced it with a homemade Vanilla Bean Frosting.  Overall, it was good, but not exactly what I was hoping for.

This is our family's new favorite bundt cake! The vanilla flavor is so beautiful and the glaze makes the cake so flavorful and moist. We usually cook the bundt cake for 55 minutes and for anyone making this recipe for the first time, I recommend greasing the pan with shortening and then flouring it. We have made it 3 times and we love it every single time!

I used 1 cup cake flour and 1 1/2 times as much butter sauce. Be careful. You may not be able to wail until it cools off. I Did not have enough patience to melt and cool the butter for the batter. I creamed the sugar w /the butter and went on from there as usual.  

I will make this again!

Easy, rich, and delicious! I made three (3!) in one weekend and received overwhelming expressions of gratitude! Requests for the "family recipe" *wink* were copious. The cake was flavorful and satisfying, pairing perfectly with hot coffee and other brunch offerings. If you put in the effort to get the  sauce fully deep down into the holes, it makes  of the difference. Thank you!

I made this with a few changes. I added an additional whole egg.  I did not use buttermilk, but whole milk.  I added lemon and made the glaze also with lemon.  I baked in a bundt pan.  And last but not least I lightly dusted with just a tad of powdered sugar once flipped onto cake dish.  My husband doesn’t care for cakes with heavy frosting so this recipe was extra appealing. 
My family thought it was wonderful and we will definitely be using this versatile recipe again. 
Thanks so much to the original submitter.

Delicious cake it is dense. I made 2 layers and added an extra egg, used cake flour and replaced the milk with buttermilk. This was for my butter cake loving daughter's birthday. Definitely a keeper. I topped with chocolate fudge frosting

Pretty simple and very tasty.  Kids also loved it and I can't let them serve themselves (because their pieces are gigantic).  Will definitely make again.

This cake is delicious! I followed the recipe as written and cooked it for 55 minutes. I used the end of a wooden spoon to poke the holes before pouring the sauce. I will definitely make this again!

This cake is very good! but the topping is really sweet....some said to add double the topping....really?! and I added walnuts as per other reviews, but really, I think less is more with this one. I will keep it simple. No Walnuts! no extra topping. The cake itself is very good! and buttery. I don't have a Bunt Pan, so I just used a small glass pan and it baked up beautifully. I will definitely make this again! but note to self. NO WALNUTS AND NO EXTRA SAUCE! YUCK. WAY TOO SWEET!!!!

I have never made a successful cake before this one. After it cooled, I cut and froze slices. I had with coffee. It's not a cake I'll make often for obvious reasons. It would be terrific with  strawberries.

So my husband had tried our first butter cake at Maggiano's, and we fell in love.  I went looking for a recipe and came across this one.  It looked and sounded doable.  I decided to use it for our Christmas dinner desert.  Wow, it turned out so well.  My husband now wants it to be his birthday cake.  I used the one recommendation of substituting brandy for water in the butter sauce... EXCELLENT advice.  It smelled wonderful and added something to the taste.  As for issues with cake breaking... None!  I let the cake cool in the pan for about thirty minutes and inverted it, placing the cake  on the dish.  I used a baking spray with flour so not a problem.  I read all the comments about tasting better after 1 day, so I made the cake 1 day before eating.  Before eating I placed the cake in the oven that was warmed up (not on) after cooking dinner.  So we had warm cake with vanilla ice cream... Simply delicious!  Great recipe! Easy to follow and excellent taste!  Highly recommend this recipe for a simple yet elegant cake.

Delicious.  We don't have a bundt pan and the cake is very dense so it didn't fully set in the middle but that is to be expected.  Other than that, it was perfect.

I've made this cake a few times.  It's delicious, and always a hit.  However, I can't seem to ever get it out of the pan.  I'm sure it's something I'm doing.. But the cake is wonderful, even if I have to break it up to get it out.

My only modification - I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract.

I enjoyed this cake a lot.  My husband thinks it needs icing, rather than the syrup soak.  I might try icing with part of the syrup next time.  My one disappointment was after letting it cool completely in the pan, it was near impossible to get out of the pan.  I used Pam, but should have greased it with shortening.  Heavily.

The almond makes the cake taste like a giant spritz cookie!

I needed a recipe for M&M's Rainbow Piñata cake that I saw on YouTube. So, I doubled this recipe and substituted with evaporated milk , and frosted with butter cream. I baked two 9" cake pans, and one 9" plain bundt cake pan: total of 3 three layers. The bundt cake pan was necessary for the cavity needed to place M&M's in the center of cake after baking. I am using this recipe again in its original format. I found this recipe very easy and the results were delicious! Great presentation! My son who turned 9 loved his birthday cake! I posted a picture of M&M’s Rainbow Piñata Cake.

This cake tastes similar to a twinkie. Very good and hard to  resist. My cake did fall apart when I turned it upside-down to get it out of the pan. I combined the dry ingredients together and added to the wet. When mixed together, the dough was similar to cookie dough, so I  had to scoop it into the pan. Better than expected. Edit 5/20/18: Since this cake is incredibly sweet, I wanted to see how it tasted with less sugar. I baked a half recipe with 3/4 cup of sugar. For the butter glaze, I didn't use any sugar. I poured the half recipe into a loaf pan and still baked for an hour. It turned out good.

I'm probably the least gifted baker a family of great cooks. However, I resisted the temptation to modify the recipe as written because that's the suggestion professional cooks have given me. Now I was very much tempted by the ratio of sugar to flour which according to my family members should be equal. The butter content in this recipe is half of what we normally have used as well but I've never baked a cake with buttermilk so I kept to the recipe.

I made these and I would again. The only thing I would do different is add 1\4 cup less. Sugar. They are super sweet with a whole cup of sugar. I also added a tad more vanilla because I used imitation vanilla. I baked mine for the full 25 minutes and the texture was perfect. All in all fabulous.

I took the suggestions of others and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the butter mixture and used a chopstick to poke holes. Overall I thought this cake was okay, a bit on the dry side but my boyfriend loved it.

This cake was a colossal disappointment.

 I made it for the first time (big mistake) for a church bake sale and I certainly won't be able to take it. I cooked it exactly except halved the recipe and cooked it in a small loaf pan. It failed to come out of the well greased pan despite being cooled. When I used a knife to coax it the entire thing split in half, and then continued to crumble out of the top so it looked entirely unpresentable despite the split. Maybe you can just blame the problems on the wrong pan? Unfortunately not.  When cut into it the "sauce" had only gone into about 3/4" of the cake, and was greasy and just...wet? Looked gross and didn't  taste great. The rest of it was edible and tasted like a fluffy cake which is why I didn't give just one star. 

Overall: this cake is a hot mess and Kentucky should be ashamed of itself!

This cake is delicious.  When you make the butter sauce to pour over the cake, you think it will be too much, but it isn't.  I would recommend using a skewer to poke holes, rather than just a toothpick so that it can go down in the cake a bit more.  It is so yummy and doesn't need a thing added to it.  It would be good served with sliced strawberries though!

So amazing! Instead of making one bundt  cake, I made 24 mini bundt cakes. And used several different flavorings inside, and frostings/glazes for the outside.

The directions are not very thorough.  I melted the butter.  Used room temperature eggs.   Mixed all wet ingredients in a bowl with a whisk.  Mixed all dry ingredients in a separate bowl with a whisk.  Then added the dry to the wet first folding it in with a wooden spoon then mixed it with an electric mixer for about a minute and a half (just until smooth).  First 20 minutes I baked it at 350 then turned it down to 325 for another 45 minutes Then turned the oven off and let it sit for five more minutes before removing from the oven.  Everyone's oven is different so you will need to make sure it gets cooked through.  Use a wood skewer (not a toothpick) to check for doneness.  Poke the cake.  If it comes out clean it's done.  Use the skewer to make the holes in the cake for the sauce.  I doubled the vanilla in my sauce.  That is the only tweek I made to the recipe.  I made this for my son's B-Day.  It's rich, buttery and moist . Everyone loves it.  2 in my family say it's the best thing they have ever eaten!  Perfect with coffee or milk.  Thank you!

This cake is rich, delicious, and fairly easy to make. I followed LUEWANA's tip on the brandy instead of water for the glaze, using E&J XO (extra smooth). This gave the glaze an amazing flavor that helped it to pop against the overall buttery taste of the cake. Sprinkled with some powdered sugar, sliced thin (again, it is VERY rich), served with a small scoop of Talenti Vanilla Bean gelato, and a small snifter of the E&J brandy used in the glaze. This was a major hit, and a couple people asked for the recipe to be forwarded to them. I will definitely be making this cake again in the future.

The first time I made this in a bundt pan it was perfect and delicious.  I made it again yesterday using a 9x13 and it turned out a little dry and mealy, like cornbread as other reviewers stated.  I will stick to using the bundt pan.  This recipe is fantastic and worth the calories!

My boyfriend and I agree that this is the best cake we have ever had! But, a cautionary note, this recipe makes a HUGE cake. The size is more appropriate for a birthday or some other special event (not for just 2 people), since it can easily feed a dozen people. I did not have a bundt pan, so I used a regular 9x13 inch pyrex dish instead. This cake was so massive that it grew well above the height of my pyrex dish. The glaze, after it cools in the fridge, reminds me of Tim Hortons glaze that is used for the honey dip timbits. This is super rich and delicious, but that's okay with me as I have a sweet tooth. It pairs perfectly with coffee on a late Saturday morning and it was awesome having a slice every day after dinner for a week straight!  A definite MUST try (but cut the recipe in half)!!

I made this cake exactly as the directions say and it is delicious and easy.  I have the ingredients on hand almost all the time.  Took my second cake to Bible study class to share and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  My only problem is getting it perfectly out of the cake pan.  (I may need to let it cool completely but both times, I couldn't wait.  I just ate what was left in the pan and served an imperfect looking cake anyway...no one cared.)  I DID grease and flour the pan well.  Love this cake!

The cake had good flavor, but the sauce needed to be thinned down some. The next time I will add a bit more buttermilk to the sauce and see what happens.

The cake was moist and great tasting.  Only thing is make the topping, let it cool down, and make sure the holes are big enough to hold the topping.

I made it for a church event.  It was delicious.  It had a moist yet tender crumb.  I did make an icing using powdered sugar and milk, it just looked unfinished without it.  It is definitely going into my recipe file.

Absolutely delicious!  This cake has a fantastic flavor.  The only thing I changed was use milk not buttermilk; I did not have any.   It did take longer than 60 minutes - I think my pan is a little smaller so the cake was thicker.  This is definitely something I will make again!

I made this easy to make, delicious cake for my partner's birthday. He absolutely loved it and said it was one of the best cakes he's had! Needless to say, this was an instant hit.  I made a strawberry vanilla compote as a topping for individual slices since it's berry season. Magnificent recipe-thanks for sharing!

I accidentally only used one stick of butter, but it was just the slightest bit dry. The butter sauce was good, but not quite what I was hoping for. I was expecting something a little more spectacular. Overall, it was a good recipe!

This was good, but I found it too buttery.  I realize that's in the title, so I guess this just isn't my thing.  I didn't think it needed the additional sauce.  It was a moist, tasty cake before the addition of liquid.  I think this is a great base recipe and I'm working to tweak it to my taste.  My very first impression was that the flavor was like cornbread.

Very addictive cake!!! For a easy clean up, make sure you use parchment paper in your bundt pan - it just made it easier for me.  Made it about 3 times and each time, the cake didn't last a full day!  Taste great with vanilla ice cream :)

Followed the recipe exactly (always do the first time). OK cake nothing special, regular pound cake is better I think. The texture was the best part, but you really have to be careful to get every last surface of the cake covered by the sauce or you have a really so-so cake
Better the 2nd day. I am now freezing it to see if it is better after defrosting.

Many Ky restaurants make  butter cake as a sheet cake...not as a bundt...and they use buttercream icing on top.  I decided to use this recipe to do just that, and it was wonderful.  The big difference in this recipe and the genuine article from Ky is the addition of bourbon (or bourbon flavoring).  This recipe is spot on with that addition.  I used bourbon in the sauce to make the difference.

My go to 'basic' vanilla cupcake recipe. I make these into cupcakes. Baked a 350 for around 20 min watching them towards the end of timing. I then poked holes in the cupcakes and put the sauce on with a pastry brush. I brushed them every two hours for the day , wrapped them and let them sit on the counter. My house is pretty cold , aorund 62 typically so I am not sure how room temp would affect them. I topped it with a whipped cream frosting. So amazing. Basic, but stands out from the rest. its more than just your average vanilla cupcake. Gotta use the sauce!

I made the recipe as stated but did not have unbleached flour so used all purpose flour. As recommended by others I made larger poke holes with the end of a thin wooden spoon. Everyone loved the cake. I also made Strawberry Rhubarb Sauce recipe from this site and used it as a topping. Very good together. I sprayed my Bundt pan with Pam let the cake cool for about an hour. I put a plate over Bundt  pan and gently turned it over, no problem with the cake sticking or breaking. This recipe is a keeper.

I love this cake. I have to force myself not to eat it. I followed the instructions exactly except I added almond extract to the sauce because the person who I baked it for loved almond extract. I found that the cake turned out perfectly and better than expected. Next time I will follow the suggestions of reviewers by  making double the amount of sauce because it  was delicious and I want it everywhere next time. As long as you put in the correct amount of sugar in the cake it shouldn't make it too sweet.

I listened to the reviews and waited a day before trying this. It was well worth the wait! This is so moist and flavorful. I can't wait to serve it to guests. I followed the recipe exactly, except for time. Mine was done at 50 minutes. Definitely keeping this recipe close!

This has become my favorite cake of all time. I always make extra sauce. When I take the cake out of the pan, I pour more of the sauce on the outside. I personally think the cake taste better the day after it's made. I love the rich, buttery flavor.

I gave it a three out of five stars because the recipe itself is scrumptious, however, while turning cooled cake onto serving plate It completely crumbled apart when removing from bundt pan, even though I oiled and floured it ahead of time.

 Note to self, next time use my springform pan instead!

Loved this recipe, it was a delicious dessert and I would definitely make it again. I've only made it once following the exact instructions and I would suggest poking much deeper holes in the cake before pouring the sauce over it because the top ended up a little dry but besides that it was wonderful.

My mom has been making Kentucky Butter cake for years, so I finally made it with this recipe. It was just like my mom's!  ...Rich and buttery just the way I remembered it as a kid. I used butter to grease my bundt pan rather than oil for even more of a buttery taste. Also, I eliminated the salt from the cake batter and added 1 t. of salt to the sauce instead. It was a wonderful contrast to the sweetness of the sugar. Lastly, I saved about 1/3 of the sauce and added it to the top of the cake once I flipped it out of my bundt pan.  ...Best pound cake ever! This recipe is a definite keeper.

This cake is really outstanding. It baked up perfectly and is not too sweet ( something I sometimes find with recipes from the US South compared to my far North Canadian palate :) it released beautifully, I've added a pic.

Just a note to other bakers who may share my frustrations with bundt pans that start sticking and ripping on the third or subsequent bake. I purchased a le creuset bundt pan this past week- they have a new baking line that is guaranteed for life. I paid a little more; $40, but it releases even w/o greasing and flouring. The design is nice, too. It's a kugelhopf (German crown).

Absolutely delicious!!  Made as written except added a few Tablespoons of bourbon to replace the water in the glaze.  Used a chopstick to poke holes in the cake for the glaze.  My husband loved it so it will definitely be a keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Delicious, moist and buttery and very easy. I'm not a buttermilk fan but great in baking! As with many things, it does get better the second day. It's sooo good warm right out of the pan though. I can never wait for it to cool. ??

This is the best butter cake I've ever made and tasted! I followed the recipe exactly and added about a half cup of sour cream to the cake batter. oh.my.gosh! The sour cream makes it ooey gooey moist. It is delicious!...definitely a family favorite! I bake it for about 55 minutes instead of an hour for my oven. I get so many compliments on this cake. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I like butter cake a little sweeter, but I'm wondering if I made it wrong. Has anyone noticed that the ingredient list says 1/3 cup butter into the cake mix, but the recipe instructions say 1 cup? I wasn't sure which measurement to follow, so, based on other butter cake recipes I've made, I added 1 cup. Just tasted the cake and, while it's good, other butter cakes I've had (like at restaurants) have been sweeter. Which measurement of butter should I follow for the cake mix? Your responses are sincerely appreciated.  Butter cake is one of my favorites, so I want to get this right. Thanks!

I really enjoyed this cake... in fact the entire family did! It was gone the same night!  I didn't have buttermilk so I did the milk (skim milk) and the apple cider vinegar trick and all I can say was that it's a true winner. My new go to cake recipe, hands down.

Delicious,  I agree with using more syrup.  Maybe 1.5 times.  But that's just being greedy.  It's great just like the recipe is written.

I have a really good buttermilk bundt cake recipe but thought I'd try a new one.  I am really unhappy with it.  It taste like a store bought cake.  It should be heavy like a pound cake but it is  not.  The  butter sauce went to sugar, so I added a little white Karol syrup.  Just o.k.  won't do it again.

This cake is amazing!  Buttery and moist and I would definitely make it again.  The sauce is so yummy on this cake and I think next time I will poke the cake with larger holes to allow it to soak deeper into the cake.  Definitely a keeper!!

I doubled the butter sauce part of the recipe. The part that you pour over the top. 
Also used a large chop stick to make the holes in the top go deeper so the sauce could get way down into cake. Everyone loved it.....

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it was delicious.  It had a rich flavor to it that wasn't overwhelming and it held the moistness well (some cakes dry out quickly but this wasn't one of them!).  Will definitely make again.

I love making this cake for work. Last time I added an extra 1/3 C of buttermilk and it made it super extra moist.
I also add rum to the topping mixture and put a cinnamon whipped cream on top. It's to die for.

It was an easy cake to make. I followed the directions explicitly and measured very accurately.  The taste was somewhat  uneventful and the glaze (?) turned to pure sugar after it cooled.  I did have a family member who loved it, because it reminded her of a cake donut.  I probably won't make it again.  However, if I should, I think I would use both vanilla and lemon extract and make the glaze using powdered sugar.

Like other reviewers suggested, I made it a day ahead. Most butter cakes are better after they age a bit. I added 1/3 c of Jack Daniel's to the glaze and substituted brown sugar for the white sugar. All anyone could say was "YUMMMMM"
Very good recipe! Thank you!!!

This cake is moist, light, and DELICIOUS! I followed the directions but used turbinado sugar in place of white sugar because that's all I had. I also creamed the butter, vanilla, eggs, and buttermilk and added the flour mixture a little at a time. I also used turbinado sugar in the glaze, but subbed 2 of the 3 tablespoons of water for buttermilk. Next time I'll do all three tbsp buttermilk, omit the water and double the amount of glaze. It gave the glaze a creamy, fresh richness reminiscent of a buttermilk caramel. Divine!! Definitely going into my trusty recipe file because this recipe is a keeper!! 
I used shortening and flour on my bundt pan, and it inverted beautifully.

Love the fact that this recipe is so simple that it's a throw it all in, mix it and  watch the magic take place in the oven. I'm not a baker by any means when it comes to cake but this is the most amazing looking, full of taste pound cake I have ever made! Thank you Allrecipes !

We tried it without the sauce and just powdered sugar, it makes it way too dry - still a good cake but the sauce added is very important if you want some moisture and a little more flavor.

This is sooo delish!!! I made it over 7 times using from non bleached apf, to cake flour. The best texture and most moist in my opinion is the bleached apf. I also added a tablespoon of rum to the cake and glaze. Chopped pecans in bunt before pouring the batter. I call it my butter pecan cake!

Wanted to make for lunch box, so I skipped the sauce.and the cake turned out to be buttery enough. However without the sauce, the cake was still too sweet for this Singapore American family. I will reduce the sugar by half the next time I make it.

So so good! This was easy to make and so tasty! It would be great with a berry compote and vanilla ice cream if served warm.  That being said - be sure to grease up that bundt pan really well and cool COMPLETELY. COMPLETELY! If it's the slightest bit warm, it will likely stick to the pan and break

I have been making this cake for over 30 years.  This is my family's all time favorite cake. 

When my dad was still living,  occasionally I would use rum extract instead of vanilla,  to make it a rum cake,  he loved it. I always use butter, never margarine,  it makes a big difference in the texture.  I personally don't use low fat buttermilk,  but either works. 

This is my go to cake recipe for all family functions.

Amazing cake recipe. I used regular bleached flour because I didn't have unbleached. I baked it for 65 minutes and it was perfect. I used a wooden skewer but next time I will try something a bit wider since most of the sauce ended up at the bottom of the cake once inverted-which was still wonderful! Next time I will also make more sauce and use chopped pecans in the cake and maybe also some in the extra sauce poured over the top of the inverted cake. (Couldn't hurt!) I Sprinkled with powdered sugar on top-delish!

Followed directions exactly and it turned out great. Very easy to make and absolutely delicious. Moist with just the right amount of density and the glaze adds a nice sweet crunch. Will make this again. And again.

I made it exactly as it was written except I added about 3 tsp of white rum to the sauce. It was delicious. I served it as a dessert at a luncheon I hosted. Everyone loved it. I also poured a glaze of 1/2 c powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and about 2 tsp cold milk and 2 tsp white rum over the top once the cake was cool. I will definitely make this again.

I made it exactly as directed.  It was a very dense coffee cake like dessert.  It was good, but not great, and a little bland.  If I made it again I would use some cinnamon and more sugar.

OMG! I'm not supposed to be baking because our Son is getting married in August and hubby wants to lose  a few more pounds even though I think he looks great! Well he's away and I just saw this and since I had all the ingredients I had to do it. 
I used almond extract in the sauce and used the handle of a wooden spoon to make the holes. Wow is all I can say , so moist so delicious!!! I'm always looking for a good pound cake recipe and now I have found it Thank you Thank you Thank you!

It came out great. I followed the suggestion of one of the other bakers,  to cream the butter and sugar for 5 minutes and then, do the same with the eggs and vanilla. If you find that review, follow it. The advice was excellent. I was very proud of how beautiful and delicious the cake was. All gone in one day!

I made this for a friend's birthday, following the recipe to a T.  I was a bit disappointed given all the great reviews.  It's an "okay" cake but nothing to rave about.  I made it the day before serving as suggested and admittedly it was even better on the third day.   I have a much better pound cake recipe in my personal recipe file and will stick to that.

What a great recipe! The only thing I omitted (because I didn't have any on hand) was the lemon zest. I also subbed the raspberries for blueberries. SO good!

This review is for all you cannabis lovers. I made this recipe substituting the  cream with cannamilk.  I chose to use cannamilk just because it's quicker to make then cannabutter and I can use it in most baking recipes that require milk or water but cannabutter would work just as well. To add more thc I substituted 1 egg for about 1/2 cup milk added a little more until I got the correct consistency; doing this made it need to cook about 15 min longer then the recipe called for. I love the recipe it's nice and sweet but not so sweet that I can still taste the cannabis.

Darn good cake, until you try to get it out of the Bundt pan. I used shortening as a release agent and coated it with flour, but to no avail. I was fine until I poured the icing on! I would "suggest", taking it out of the pan after its cooked, and putting it on your serving tray. Then pouring the "icing" on. At least thats what I will be doing next time. All in all, its a very moist cake, with wonderful comfort home baked goodness!

This cake is so delicious! It is one of my favorite cake recipes. I only have a nine inch Bundt pan, so I use that to make the cake and also make ten or so cupcakes along with it, which I bake for about twenty or thirty minutes. Other than that I don't change anything. It is very moist and the butter sauce is really tasty. It is a little time-consuming to make so many holes in the cake, but it's worth it.

Delicious, dense and mouth-watering! Followed everything as listed, but ran out of vanilla extract so I substituted with almond extract. Smelled delicious while baking and afterward! My family really liked it. Served with a heaping spoonful of cool whip and a cup of coffee. Excellent!

Not going to be the last time I will make this cake. So easy and so good. I didn't double the sauce, I found it enough as my bundt pan maybe a little smaller than some.

I made this cake for Easter and it was a HIT! Everyone loved it. It was moist and buttery! I also made more sauce and slightly glazed the top of it as well. DELISH! I'm actually making it again today.

This cake is super delicious and well loved by all who tasted it. My husband kept sneaking slices, he said the butter sauce made it addictive.

I made the cake exactly as written but here are a few tips:

1. Be sure to seriously butter/grease your bundt pan AND flour it. Bundt cakes are tricky to get out of the pan.

2. Before you try to remove the cake from the pan, run a thin knife or spatula around the cake twice.

3. Best made at least one day ahead! It really stays moist.

It was so delicious. I served this with lemon curd and homemade strawberry ice cream.

Holly cow this cake is fantastic! I've never been a fan of cake without frosting, but this cake is soooo good even without the glaze (although the glaze is great too). This is, hands down, my new favorite cake.  It has a great buttery flavor.

Great recipe!  I love this cake, it was super easy and taste great. I was wondering how to time the recipe if I were making mini bundts, I want to make them for a up coming baby shower as favors. Any input would be helpful.

My husband loves it, I've made it twice now and the second time I added a raspberry purée to the sauce. Delicious! I also cream the butter and sugar first.

I've made this cake once before for my husbands city Council meeting. It was his turn again this week to bring a refreshment. So he told me that one of the ladies specifically asked for me to make this cake again for the next meeting. It was such a big hit last time. It really is a delicious cake. Hoping for leftovers tonight. It's very easy to make and is a crowdpleaser.

Living in KY, I HAD to try this! It did not disappoint. I actually made it in a loaf pan (1/2 recipe) to give to a neighbor, but made myself a muffin size cake to taste... and it was yummy! To me, it tasted like a glazed donut, only more cake-like & better! The glaze just topped it off.

I made this for a friend for her birthday.  She asked for something a little less sweet, so I cut the sugar in the cake by 1/2 c and in the syrup by 1/4 c. 

I baked it in four 6" round pans the day before so the syrup could really soak in, and assembled the layers with a custard filling.

It turned out great - dense and very moist - and was a huge hit with everyone :)

Not a bad cake, maybe my family is just not a bunt cake type of family. We threw the last quarter out since no one was eating it.

It was a little heavy but not all cakes need to be light and fluffy.  It was moist, and the syrup added a wonderful flavor.  I only had enough butter for the cake and had to use light butter for the syrup. I added butter flavoring to the syrup just in case the light butter wasn't enough.  It was wonderful.

This cake is easy to make. It's decadent to the point of being too  sweet. Hubby says it needs a bit of citrus in the batter to add dimension and cut the sweetness.

One of my favorite cake recipes by far. One tip would be to add the eggs one at a time alternating with the buttermilk to keep the cake from becoming tough and crumbly.  Also did a variation with this that was a hit!

Excellent cake!! Everyone loves it.  I use cake flour instead of AP and double the butter sauce, using some to glaze the top as well.  I also make this in the standard way by creaming butter  and sugar, adding eggs and vanilla, and then alternating the dry ingredients with the buttermilk.  You should not beat the cake longer than needed once flour is added.   Thanks for the recipe!  Its a keeper!

This cake was moist and didn't taste like the heavy butter as I thought. I think adding the syrup is a nice touch however it seems a bit too sugary for my taste. I made a square cake with half sugar coating and half chocolate buttercream. Everyone loved it.

Cake batter by itself was good, as far as butter cakes go. I baked it in a bundt pan; then poked all the holes and added the glaze. But we found the glaze made the cake much too sweet. If I made it again, I would bake it in a tube pan instead of a bundt pan. And for the glaze, I would add in the juice of a lemon or orange and its zest and reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup.

The cake was excellent.  I took it to a picnic and because it was so overwhelmingly sweet, I cut in very small pieces.  Everyone loved it and one gentleman renamed it 'Dense Cake'.   But I found for myself, that just a half of one small piece, was more than enough!  And I really was afraid that I was going to have trouble getting the cake out of the pan, but when it was cooled, it slid right out and was perfect!

I made this cake as a base for a Lamington cake, baked it in a 9 by13 pan and used milk/vinegar instead of buttermilk. The cake itself was super sweet and the butter sauce added a glaze to it so it kind of tasted like a glazed donut. If you like REALLY sweet, this is the cake for you!

I made this recipe according to the directions and it was terrible... Yes it was easy to make but it was like eating corn bread.  I would not recommend making this cake.

This recipe is awesome just as it is. I baked exactly as stated and it was amazing. Just made it a second time and added 1 tsp cinnamon to the glaze and it became the most heavenly coffee cake imaginable. I imagine you could do the same with rum extract, orange, amarettio or many other flavored. What a Great recipe!

Extremely moist & delicious. Everyone loves it. Buttermilk is a definite. More holes the better for butter sauce to immerse within the cake. Sprinkle with powder sugar just before serving.

Crowd pleaser!!  I've made this recipe a half dozen times and no one has turned away disappointed.  A friend had a 3rd helping last night!!  Seems like it flavors through even a bit more on day 2 (if there's any left), so we make it a day ahead of when we're taking dessert somewhere.  I make it in a 9x13 pan (vs. a round Bundt)... no problems.  You will love this cake.

WOW!!  What a great cake.  It does remind me of a pound cake, but I love pound cake, and it doesn't state that it ISN'T a pound cake.  So, whether it is or isn't, it is still delicious!!  Followed directions exactly and had no problems with sticking in pan or with it rising.  THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL CAKE!

I am not a baker and this turned out awesome. So moist and yummy. I used a straw to poke all of the holes in the cake but my sauce had cooled and thickened by the time I went to  pour it on. The sauce didn't really soak in very far but I am sure next time if the sauce if hotter I will have better luck.

So moist!  I did not have buttermilk so I substituted unsweetened vanilla almond milk. Could not have been better.  This is a keeper.

This cake somehow manages to be rich and mild at the same time. It's delightful on its own, but also would be mighty tasty with some sliced strawberries or perhaps some blueberry syrup drizzled on top.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS CAKE!! MY FAMILY DOES TOO! I MADE IT FOR CHRISTMAS. I FOLLOWED IT AS INSTRUCTED. IT CAME OUT LOVELY. IT'S VERY MOIST & BUTTERY. I POKED SEVERAL HOLES IN IT WITH A TOOTHPICK, THEN DRIZZLED THE GLAZE ON. I LET THE CAKE SIT FOR 10 MINUTES. I DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM GETTING IT OUT OF THE PAN BECAUSE I GENEROUSLY SPRAYED IT WITH BAKER'S JOY IT WAS A SIGHT TO BEHOLD!!! *GOLDEN BROWN DELICIOUSNESS :) I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN. THANKS!!.

Recently making this cake and I used almond extract instead of vanilla and I also used half butter and half blue bonnet in the cake. I also used the milk and vinegar method instead of buttermilk because I was craving a good cake but didn't feel like leaving the house. As for the sauce, I used brown sugar instead and added cinnamon and I am so anxious to see how this turns out!! It's smelling good :D

This was really good.  I do have to admit I made a minor change.  First, I did like some others, I creamed the butter and sugar first before adding the other ingredients.  And instead of vanilla in the batter, I used 1.5 tsp almond extract, but used the vanilla in the sauce.  And I only made half the sauce, which was perfect.  However, I think next time I will make the full recipe of sauce, and once I turn the cake over, will pour some on the other side.  My sauce didn't soak thru, so only the "bottom" had the sauce.

Just made this tonight and it's absolutely delicious!  I would suggest creaming the butter and sugar, then adding the other wet ingredients and the dry ingredients last. It's very easy to make.

This cake was delicious to say the least! So moist and buttery! I didn't even put all of the butter sauce inside, it might have been too sweet for my liking. Instead I drizzled a good amount on top and still had tons left. Great recipe!

Everybody I know loves this cake.  People have even offered to pay me to make it.  In fact, the only thing people seem to want me to make is this cake even though I'm quite good at baking other things.  I'm getting awfully tired of baking Kentucky Butter Cake and yet...I can't stop eating it.  It's so buttery and moist and soft!

I make it exactly as written and bake in a clay bundt pan, although mine usually takes about an hour and twenty minutes to bake.  I left it in for an hour and a half this morning and the outside edges were pretty dark but didn't taste burned.

This cake was incredible. I followed the directions exactly but I did poke the cake with a skewer and pour the butter sauce into the cake. I turned it onto a cake dish and frosted with a chocolate sauce made from sweetened condensed milk (1 can) and 3/4 cup cocoa. I was very good.

I made this pretty much as stated, I just added a little more baking soda and baking powder. This was very good and the whole family liked it alot. Next time I think I will poor some of the butter sauce in the holes and make a donut type white glaze to drizzle over the top.

This cake is amazing - in fact it was so good I have had to make it twice in a week because it was gone so fast. My brother said it reminded him of really good pancakes, so the I topped the second one with a maple glaze. Easy to make, worth the effort!

Pretty good.  Made for a family dinner and got several nice comments.  I thought there wasn't much falvor but really moist and dense.  I will probably make again.

I loved this cake.  I did it in several pastel colors in a bundt pan for Easter and then the icing in another color.  I would use a wide stick ( I used a corn dog skewer) to make a ton of holes.  Looked festive and was a hit!

The sauce makes a sweet glaze, keeping the cake moist. It has a lovely buttery flavor that is sweet but not overdone. The batter is very thick and I was worried it wouldn't come out right, but it looked and tasted wonderful!!

Wonderful Easy Recipe. Looks Picture Perfect. As Others Reviewed I Used Bakers Joy Spray To Prime My Bundt Pan, And I Had No Problems, Just Popped Right Out. And I Also Used 3 Tablespoons Of Caption Morgan Rum, Instead Of 3 Tablespoons Of Water. Thank You For From Florida!!

I made this recipe and it was wonderful! My family ate it almost as soon as it came out of the oven.  I made a double batch of the sauce because one wasn't enough.  I poked holes in the cake so it would seep in.  I also made a streusel mix with walnuts and put it in the bottom of the pan.  This cake will long be a new family favorite!

Everyone loved this cake! I exchanged the vanilla for rum and coconut extract. (1 tsp each). The buttery sauce was yummy too! I will look for a better way to get the sauce to sink in though. It might work better if you slice it- then pour on the sauce. Still wonderful regardless!

This cake was great.  Not good for you...but good tasting!  I ran out of vanilla extract for the butter sauce, so I used 2 tsp. of maple syrup.  I think that may be even better than using the vanilla extract.

This one's a keeper!  I'm going to try browning the butter in the glaze next time.  I've made this a few times as written and it always turns out moist and buttery. This bakes up perfectly in 2 6-cup bundt pans, about 40 min.  My only mistake I made one time was to make 1 1/2 X the glaze recipe which made the cake a little too soggy.  Didn't help that I also drizzled the top of the cake with even more powder sugar glaze.  Facepalm.  That made it a too sweet + too soggy.

Update: Serving the cake chilled cures the sogginess!  I prefer cakes room temperature so next time I'll just follow the recipe as written.

This cake was just OK.  I liked it but wish I would have made double or triple the glaze to follow the instructions AND to add some once it's out on display.  The way it is now, not worth the calories!

Used powdered buttermilk and turned out great.  Also added the cinnamon to the sauce.  Would have been good plain too.  Very moist.  Grease pan really well.

I just cut into this cake, which is still warm and has not quite absorbed all of the sauce I poured over it.  It's very good, and will probably get better as it sits.  The only thing I did was to cut back on the sugar by about 1/3c.  It's still plenty sweet.  I will probably cut a full 1/2c next time I make this.  I can tell that the sauce is going to give the cake a delicious crunchy crust on the outside, while the middle remains soft and moist.  I think it would be great with a bit of lemon juice and dried orange peel added to the batter, as well.

This was good, but I should have doubled the glaze--it ended up being somewhat dry in some places, but where the glaze settled, it was gooey and yummy.

Ok, the only way this cake is going to be tasty to a baker is if you use a high grade butter like Plugra and REAL vanilla, not imitation. Otherwise it's not flavorful and just plain "sweet bread". Is it necessary to go through this much work to taste. . .sugar. I'm not saying this was hard to make, but for the taste, it was too much work. I was not impressed with this cake. I tasted the batter to get an idea of how it would come out, and added a little more vanilla (real vanilla). The butter sauce makes it difficult to improve the cake if you don't like it, as it would be too sweet to add frosting after the sugary butter sauce. I must admit it tasted better the next day, but still not good enough for me to make again. It gave me the feeling of "dang, I just had unnecessary calories and fat" and I don't count calories!! It just made me wish I had something else for dessert.  My family says they like it, but 4 days later and there's still some left - and it was only a half a cake!  I gave away 1/2 the first day. I don't think I'll be making this cake again - surely not as written, if I do it would be with a number of changes.   By the way, as for the sauce soaking through, I use a cake tester to make the holes and if I find the sauce is still sitting on cake, I poke more holes AFTER I've poured the sauce and let the sauce sink in. Make sure to poke the hole all the way through, not a shallow poke.  Thanks Suzanne for the recipe, I wish I could have given it a rave review. :-(

This was so simple quick and easy.  I decided to double the butter sauce since so many mentioned it and used a chop stick for making the holes to drench.  The cake was delicious, moist and a hit with everyone. I'm making it again and adding some sour cream as I think it would add a nice extra touch of moisture.  Also want to try different flavors in the butter sauce.  Will do again and again.

I'm not much of a baker and this still came out outrageous.  I followed the instructions as written.  Everyone in my house loved it (and they are all picky).  Seemed to easy to be good...but it was!

This cake is excellent.  The mixing method is unconventional- no creaming, etc.  Weirdly, it comes out beautifully!  It is not tough and releases from the 10 c bundt pan perfectly.  I ran out of white sugar and used confectioner's in the glaze.  I poured it over the top of the cake and it made a delicious buttery glaze.  This is a wonderful recipe and if you want a true butter cake, make this one.

Great!!!!  EVERYONE in the Family Loved it... I always ask after trying a new Recipe if it's a keeper or not the vote was Unanimous....IT'S A KEEPER.. Only thing I changed is I did not have buttermilk so I did 1/2 cup sour cream 1/2 cup 2% milk.. Thanks so much I can see making this for many years to come.

I made this cake yesterday and there is only a few pieces left.  I did not have any buttermilk, but used 2% with a few drops of apple cider vinegar.  I made it in a 9X13 pan and poked holes in it while it was still warm.  I poured a double batch of the sauce in the holes within 5 minutes of it coming out of the oven.  I couldn't resist trying it while it was still warm and I enjoyed it very much.  The texture of the cake was very different after it cooled.  I think it tastes like a really sweet cake donut.  My fiance, 7 year old daughter, and 89 & 87 year old grandparents all thought it was a hit as well.  My birthday is tomorrow and I am thinking of making another one for the occasion.  Thanks for sharing!!  5 Stars . . .

Delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe states. So moist and the texture of the cake is wonderful. The sauce has great flavor and is just enough to enhance the cake. I made sure that it was totally cool before turning it onto a plate and had no problems sticking. I used a bundt pan and cooking spray and for my oven I baked it at between 300 and 325 for 50 minutes and it was done perfectly.Thank you for a great recipe and I will definately make this again!

Thank God I found this recipe again, I had the original cookbook with this in it and lost it and it really is the best most delicious cake ever. I moved away from my hometown 11 years ago and whenever I come back all my friends still remember and ask me to make this.

Delicious!  Had to use a springform pan because I didn't have a bundt cake pan.  Also didn't have buttermilk so I used milk with a few drops of applecidar vinegar.    It was so moist and delicious.  My picky husband even said it was good, so I know I will be making this again soon!  Thanks for the recipe Suzanne!

This cake was very easy to make, and tasted good.  I followed another suggestion and made extra butter sauce.  It's a nice cake to serve with berries or some thing else, but it's a little plain by itself.

This cake was good but not as great as it sounded from all the reviews. The frosting is a hassle since it really needs to be drenched in it. I would say this cake is like a buttermilk donut. I used a mini bundt pan and it cooked in about 45 min.

EXCELLENT CAKE!! And SO EASY! I followed the recipe exactly except that I had to do my standard buttermilk substitute: put 1 T vinegar in bottom of measuring cup, fill cup rest of the way with milk, let sit for 5 minutes. Other reviewers have used regular milk, so I may try that too.  I am not normally a fan of cake, and especially frosting, but decided to try this since it was different and didn't need to be frosted. WOW! The batter tastes like sugar cookies to me. Everyone loved this. My honey took some to work for breakfast and the kids all took it in their lunches.   I think I will try different flavors with the sauce just for variation, definitely orange and maybe lemon. I did not double the sauce and I think doubling would make the cake too soggy.  Very thankful that I found this recipe. Will be making it over and over for years to come. THANK YOU for posting!!

I like this alot!  The sauce compliments the crispy outer crust type stuff very nicely!  Only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is because it was not as dense or moist as I picture a bundt.

Good cake, rich, dense, moist - lots of butter!  Followed the suggestions and made lots of holes - used the thick end of chopsticks.  Also made 1 1/2 times the sauce...yum

I followed all of the directions including mixing all the ingredients at once, except that I doubled the sauce recipe as others suggested. My husband could not stand waiting for it to cool and insisted I turn the cake out warm. It was fine-- a couple little chunks left in the pan. We both made the mistake of taking huge pieces, and after about 2 full minutes of gorging, we both had to stop. It is really, really good, but really really dense, sweet, and filling. I'll make this one again, maybe as a birthday cake, or potluck dessert, because it will go a long way.

The flavor was DELICIOUS -- buttery sweet and rich, with the outside surface golden and crispy. BUT, the only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars was because it refused to slip out of the bundt pan!  I had noticed other reviewers with this problem so I took special care to oil and flour thoroughly, and I let it cool to room temp before even attempting to remove the cake....but to no avail. I'm not sure what I could've done differently for an easier removal...? If anyone has tips, I'm all ears!

Divine is the only word that I have for this cake  I make this recipe holiday!!! The only this I noticed is that you have to frost the cake in the pan before you take it out.  I tried it the way the directions said and then I tried by taking the cake out of the pan and then frosting it and the glaze stuck.

The cake came out perfect and I had no trouble at all taking it out of the pan.  The sauce however is a different story.  I turned hard and crunchy and just sat on top of the cake.  I didn't soak through at all.  Just glad I made it a few days before I had planned to serve it.  I definitely will not be serving this one!

Mmm... delicious! I substituted oil for butter and regular milk for buttermilk to make cupcakes, and it turned out great. The icing came out more like a nice vanilla glaze.

This is the best cake I've ever made!  It's relatively easy and although quite gluttonous, worth every single calorie!  I did have a moment of panic when I added the buttermilk and it started curdling the mixture, but I just pressed on and added the dry ingredients and it smoothed out very nicely.  The end result reminds me of a buttermilk bar doughnut, which are my favorite variety, so I absolutely loved it.  I served it with cherries and vanilla ice cream and it made a perfect adult birthday cake...I will make this cake many times in the future!

Excellent cake! Didn't have a bundt pan so I adjusted the recipe to 3/4, used a normal loaf pan and the cake turned out beautifully golden and deeelicious. This is my husband's new favourite butter cake. A real keeper!

Pretty average & tasted like flour. I'm an avid baker & I won't be making this again. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I did enjoy the sugar topping :) it was crunchy and delicious. I added cinnamon to the batter & had i not- I'm sure it would have tasted worse. Not good at all.

This cake was good but I didn't think it was anything too special. I used a kabob skewer to poke the holes and I'm thinking it would've been better if I had made bigger holes for the sauce to seep into. It was a quick and easy recipe. My nine year old daughter made w/ a little supervision from me. I think the cake would've been better w/ a chocolate glaze on top of it.

This is my go-to cake! I have made it countless times and each time get rave reviews. Even without the butter sauce, it is a great cake that can be used as a base for any dessert. Serve with whipped cream and fruit, custard, chocolate fudge sauce, icecream with the works, maserated berries... or eaten just like that. The possibilities are endless. Thanks for sharing!

The sauce was good, but the cake itself was a little bland I thought.  I finally made a second batch of sauce, sliced the cake and poured the sauce over the slices.  Once they were good and soaked, it was much better, but It was too much work for a just okay cake.

Thsi was awesome! I made exactly as is, except used the 1 tbsp vingear to milk trick to make the buttermilk. My oven cooks hot so I did overcook it a touch but the inside still is a perfect texture. Used it for strawberry shortcake and was perfect. Used the chopsticks to poke holes into the cake. Wasn't wet or greasy at all.

Delicious!  Everyone in the house gave it a 5 star rating.  I was a bit too excited to try it and popped it out of the pan before it was completely cool.  It ended up splitting into a big mess!  I'll have more patience next time. :)

Wow, this was an incredible cake for as simple as it may sound. Super easy to make and like others have said, one of the tricks is to make sure you cool the cake completely before removing it from the bundt pan (also, a little Baker's Joy helps do the trick too!).  I followed some suggestions and added about a 1/2 cup more buttermilk to the batter to help thin it out, used a wooden chopstick for the holes and poured most of the butter sauce into the cake.  I took it to a work function and everybody LOVED it!  Thanks so much for sharing this terrific recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years after I found it in a Pillsbury Bake-Off cookbook from 1969.  I did the same as other reviewers and creamed the eggs and sugar well then alternately added wet and dry ingredients together.  For the glaze, I've not only used vanilla extract, but for a taste change, I've used 1 T. of either Amaretto or Frangelico liqueurs with great success.

I baked this cake in two layer pans and did not use the glaze/frosting.  Instead I frosted it with buttercream frosting.  Be careful not to overcook.  I made it twice, and the first time it was a bit dry, but that was my mistake for overcooking.  Second time it was excellent and moist.  Great butter cake - we had to make it twice because everyone loved it so much.

GREAT CAKE!!!  Followed the recipe exactly and it works great adding all the wet to all the dry, I didn't even soften the butter first.  Made sure the butter sauce went down the sides of the pan and it is a moist yummy delight!! A keeper in the recipe box.

I made this cake for a baby shower cake.  I doubled the recipe and added 1 additional serving of the butter sauce (to make it moister).  

I was concerned I might not be able to decorate it.  But I cooled it overnight and it worked out great.  I was able to fully decorate the cake and everyone commented on how moist it was.

I making it again today for my first bundt cake.

This was a great-flavored cake.  Make sure you use a good quality vanilla extract, because that is the dominant flavor, especially with the butter sauce.  Very moist cake.  Took this to a family function and received many compliments.

Everyone loved this but me. I didn't especially like the butter sauce, and though I poked both large and small holes throughout the bottom of the cake, I wasn't pleased with the way it dispersed itself.

Apparently it was only me, though! Because everyone else had seconds.

I served it with an apple compote.

THIS RECIPIE WAS VERY GOOD. BUT INSTEAD OF SUGAR I USED SPLENDA BECAUSE OF THIS I ADDED ALITTE MORE BUTTERMILK SINCE SPLENDA SOMETIMES MAKES CAKES DRY.

The butter sauce made this cake way too sweet, and gave it a wet consistency throughout the bottom half of the cake. The cake without the sauce seeped into it was good. Might try without the sauce, but will  probably look for another yellow cake recipe.

I have made this cake several times. Always turns out great. Only changes I make is to prepare my pan with bakers spray and I double the sauce. I make a lot of cakes and this is my mothers favorite.

To DIE for!!!
I bake a lot, and this is one of the best cakes I've come across as far as taste and texture are concerned.
I did cut back on the sugar a bit (about 1/3 to 1/2 cup) since there was going to be more in the sauce, but that's just personal taste.
I also did the traditional method of creaming the butter and sugar, adding the eggs, then alternating the dry and wet ingredients, but I'd be curious to try the method suggested next time.
At any rate, it was delicious and travelled well to a friend's cottage.
Everyone had seconds!
Thanks for sharing Suzanne!

absorbed the butter sauce tasted very yummy, but looked undercooked and had that texture.  It was probably something I did.  I followed the advice of others and added a bit of cinnamon to the sauce--yumm.  And next time I will also follow the advice of making a slightly larger batch of sauce and drizzling it on top.  Oh, and one piece of advice I didn't follow the first time I made this cake was to let it cool completely in the pan.  Big mistake!  I was too impatient and ended  up with half a cake in the pan and half the cake on the platter.  The second time around I let it cool and it only had minor stickage problems.  Will make again.

Such an excellent cake! It was moist, fluffy and delicious! The only change I made was to add 3/4 c. toasted pecans chopped really tiny to the batter and some rum extract to both the cake and glaze.   I made it about 4 hours ago and it's already gone! Mine also popped right out of the pan about 10 min after I finished glazing the bottom.  I poured a small amount of the glaze on top too!

Delicious and easy to make.  I followed the directions exactly except for adding an extra egg only because the eggs I had were a bit small. I had alot of left over batter because I used a 9 in. bunt pan instead of a 10 in., then I didn't want to fill the pan to high, thinking it might spill over, but that wouldn't have been the case.  This cake doesn't rise a whole lot, it's very rich, sort of like a buttery pound cake. Still, the cake itself was great, moist and rich. We ate it with ice cream, it was incredible. Next time I'll serve it with sliced strawberries and whip cream like other reviewers have, and also double the delicious buttery sause.  Excellent cake, 5 stars, and I'd definately make again!!! Almost forgot, I just sprayed the pan with non-stick cooking spray, and that worked fine.

this cake was just great! I doubled the butter sauce and it was perfect and used a 8.5" springform cake pan. It was very dense and yummy! I topped it with freshly whipped cream and fresh in season fruits! Will make again!.. and again and again!

Great yellow cake recipe.  I served this with cherry pie filling and cool whip, it was wonderful.  Word of caution though, it's so moist you should probably refrigerate it.  We live in a humid area, but mine molded on me.

What a delicious, moist cake! Everyone loved it. I made it over Memorial Day weekend and its almost gone! I took another reviewer's tip and creamed the butter and the sugar first, then added the eggs and milk; then added the dry ingredients. I served it with strawberries. Mmmm! Thanks for sharing Suzanne!

I LOVED THE CAKE. WHEN I MADE THE BUTTER SAUCE TO POUR OVER THE CAKE I USED A LITTLE MORE SUGAR THAN IT  CALLED FOR WHICH CAUSED THE BUTTER SAUCE TO BE TOO THICK. THE CAKE STILL TASTED GOOD, JUST DIDNT LOOK AS PRETTY AS IT SHOULD HAVE.

I did an advanced search looking for a cake recipe that did not have milk... this one sounded good. But then I noticed it has buttermilk... so I used the recipe anyways, but used 1 cup of a strong brewed coffee beverage in place of the buttermilk. Ohh and did it smell good! I also used margarine in place of butter and oil in place of shortening... so my cake was more like a margarine cake... it was so moist and delicious and everyone liked it a lot - especially my friend who cannot eat milk products - yay!

My boyfriend likes bundt cakes and things that are very plain, so this recipe fit the bill.  This cake is pretty good if you like cake that tastes like butter and not much else.  It's moist and good with cold milk.

This was a pretty good cake with a nice texture, but I found it a little dry and a little plain. I made it in 2 layers and did not make the sauce but frosted it with a buttercream icing.

I love this recipe, but it is definitely not for dieters. For those who think the cake is not moist and delicious, make sure you are following step 4 and pricking holes in the bottom of the cake and pouring the butter sauce in them. I made this mistake the first time I tried this cake.

My daughter and I made this one together (she's 13). It is a pretty good cake. It's better the next day though. Not as moist as I would have thought considering we poured the sauce over it like we did but still good. I just finished the last of it off for breakfast :D

This is an easy cake to make, mine only took about 40 min to bake not the whole hour.My sauce did not soak all the through. I am the blame for that( did not read all the reviews so I was unaware that I should make it a day ahead) My mother,aunt,children all loved this cake.Will make again.

This cake is very plain and has a somewhat course texture.  It is great for this type of cake. I sprayed Bak-Klene on my bundt pan and the cake fell right out after cooling for sometime. The color was even and golden brown. I sliced the cake and layed it on a platter to take to a meeting. It was gone quickly. I think this cake would work well for strawberry shortcake.  It might be good even without the sauce. The sauce only soaked into about a third of the cake. But, the cake has great flavor and texture. Definitely one I'll try again.

Oh my goodness.  This cake is awesome, and so easy.  It is the first time I used my silicon Bundt pan, and I had no problems removing the cooled cake.  This recipe is going to find a home in my recipe box.  Outstanding!!  Next time I will try the rum/whiskey in the sauce as suggested.

Very good, very moist.  I made this for my boyfriends superbowl party and it was a hit. Everyone suggested vanilla ice cream on the side.  This will certainly be my next birthday cake!

This was easy to make and I had the ingredients on hand which was wonderful.  I followed another reader's suggestion and added pecans to the bottom of the pan and it turned out great.  I sprayed the pan with Pam and it came right out without sticking.  Great recipe.

This was ok; nothing spectacular.  I didn't notice where the sauce added anything to the cake, or maybe I didn't make deep enough holes in the bottom of the cake for the sauce to go all the way through the cake.  I might make it again.

With all the other reviews, I'm not sure if I'm adding anything...this is my husband's favorite cake. I turn it into a lemonm opund cake by adding the grated zest of two lemons and substituting lemon juice for the water in the glaze. Yum. When I am glazing, I use a table knife to gently pry the cake from the side of the pan and alow the glaze to run down the side. And my new Nordicware Gothic bundt cake pan works better than any other I've used. Glaze distributed evenly all over the cake.

i made this cake last weekend and it was stellar: moist, flavorful, smooth and rich.  of course i screwed up the butter sauce application by being greedy and poking holes with skewers; it made the icing pool.  next time, i'm going to glaze it in the pan by scoring the top, applying the sauce, letting it run down, and then waiting awhile before depanning (word?).  recipe itself is swell.

This cake is so moist and delicious.  I would make it more but never have buttermilk handy unless I make a note to buy it.  I made the "mistake" of taking the cake out of the pan and then poking holes on the top and pouring on the wonderful butter syrup.  It turned out fine but I will try to remember to put it on before I take it out and see if more gets absorbed into the cake.

This recipe is quite delicious.  You have to be careful not to pour too much of the butter sauce over it, or it tends to get soggy.

I think this cake is absolutely one of the best alternative cakes to the pound cake.  My family loves it.  I have made it about 4 times and have tried the cinnamon and brown sugar combination (hated it), I think it took away from the simple flavor of the butter and sugar.  However, I think the other suggestions of using other flavors such as lemon, rum, brandy, or bourbon will definitely enhance this cakes flavor even more.  Thanks Suzanne, you've done a great public service.  Esbell

I was not too terribly thrilled with this recipe.  It was moist and fairly simple to make and the butter sauce was really good, but it seemed like something was missing...I think I will try it again and make variations as some of the other reviewers did...

Decadent beyond words. VERY
buttery. Don't  portion
out too big a serving, or
people will be on a sugar high.
Literally, not for the faint at
heart... Kudos to Kentucky!

Used 10 spring pan and cooked an extra 3-5 mins.  Use 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tbls bourbon for the glaze..now its a Kentucky Bourbon Butter Cake.

The cake recipe is the same as an basic english Tea Cake..Use springform pan. Cut it into two layers, use fresh fruit preserves and glaze (with or without bourbon,rum, or brandy....

This isn't mom's recipe. Needs lemon in glaze. Maybe try some substitutes, and changes. Maybe try upping glaze amounts by half, reserving that new 1/2 to pour over unmolded cake.

My guests loved this cake....It tastes like a sweet bisquit.  This recipe is perfect for a get together, but I would suggest not making it right before the engangement because it takes a little longer to make your first time then specified.  Well worth the time though...

Very good, mine turned out a little dry.  I also was not that impressed with the presentation.  Very easy though - thanks for the recipe.

This cake smelled so good, I couldn't wait until it cooled to try it! Unfortunately, it fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan. It tasted wonderful, even in pieces. Next time I will follow directions more carefully!

What a great recipe!  This cake was delicious, despite the fact that I cooked it a little too long (I never listen to directions!)  I will probably make this again.

OMG!  All I can say is that I was reading the reviews while waiting for the cake to cool, and because everyone raves about it I went to have a piece...this is just so darn good.  Yum, yum, yum!

Excellent recipe, I served it with a dollop of whipped cream, everyone loved it. I think next time I will double the syrup though, it was a buttery and delicious cake.

My favorite kitchen activity is baking and I must say this is one of the easiest recipes that I have made. It smells wonderful when baking and when almost cool I turned the bundt cake onto a platter and it was beautiful. I think I would also save half of the butter icing and add coconut and pecans the next time as someone else suggested

This cake is great! I read in one of the reviews that it stuck to the greased and floured pan. You need to make sure you allow the cake to completely cool before removing. I will use this recipe again and again. Thank you for posting it Suzanne.

The cake was good BUT it stuck to the bundt pan (it was greased and floured).  After offering everyone a bowl of cake chunks, we all did agree that it WAS a good cake.  I would suggest adding the cinnamon to the cake and sauce, it gave it a more interesting flavor.  Next time I will try making it in a angel food pan with parchment paper like someone else suggested.

WOW!  This cake is awsome!  This is the second cake that I baked from scratch, and I can't believe I actually made it.  I tried another cake recipe the night before, but it was not very impressive at all, so I decided to try one with better reviews.  This cake came out PERFECT - no problems at all.  I will definitely be making this one again - real soon1

WOW!!!  My little 4 year old helped me make this and entered it in the fair.  He won a Reserved Sweepstakes ribbon on it!!!   He loved poking the holes in the bottom before I poured on the hot butter sauce.  Very tasty!  This cake is very moist and just wonderful.  Everyone that has tasted it has fallen in love with it.  Thanks Suzanne!

Delicious cake, very easy.  I sifted the flour anyway.  How do you get the sauce to spread to the entire cake?  My sauce settled on the top.

If you are looking for a sure winner everytime
  dessert, this is it! Ive made this 3 times
  in 2 weeks, and it disappears in a matter of a
  day or two. It comes out perfect everytime.
  And I have not had one person yet, who does
  not just love it. Thanks so much for sharing
  this one. It is definitely a keeper!!

This is a very good cake; however, I think the Buttery Cinnamon Cake (on allrecipe) is better.  They are very similar.  I made them back to back to compare.  I think the addition of cinnamon adds a lot and I didn't even think I liked cinnamon.

This is one of the best pound cake
recipes that I have ever made and
tasted. My husband loves poundcake
and this one was gobbled up faster
than any other.
Delicious, moist, wonderful. 
Thank You so very much for sharing
this great recipe.

This cake was so incredibly good and light.  I used "i can't believe it's not butter light" and it still tasted fantastic-while saving 1/2 the fat in the butter.  Kind of reminded me of a poppy seed cake.
