I noticed that people are having trouble making the breading stay on, I made these again just 2 nights ago and they turned out perfect as always.  You need to use really fine grated parmesan, it has to be powdery and what I do is I really press the breading onto them. The breading shouldn't fall off and you need quite a bit of butter because the breading absorbs most of the butter and when you turn the scallops over the pan will get too dry if there's not enough butter.

This was quick and delicious. We used italian bread crumbs and egg to make it stick better instead of cream and crackers.

I also added some Old Bay, but instead of light cream, I let them soak in plain milk for about 2-3 minutes, and the crust stayed on completely.  I also finished them with a dried little dill weed. FANTASTIC, I too will make these often.

This was a tasty and really easy way to make scallops.  I did put the scallops in an egg wash before I breaded them.  I had hoped that the breading would stick better than being put directly on the scallops.  It didn't help enough.  Half of the breading came off in the pan.  Also use less butter than the recipe calls for or it will be a little greasy.  I will make these again but I will try something else to keep the breading on it better.  Also try to get scallops that are very close in size otherwise some will be perfect and others overcooked.

These were fantastic!!  I crushed the cracker crumbs to dust and I also greated my parm cheese to dust and pressed it into my scallops and my first batch I noticed the coating fell off a little so I just cooked the 2nd a little longer to a toast brown colour and the coating stayed on.  Will make these weekly!

I tried the breading but used flour first, then egg and then dipped in breading, coating did not stay on the scallops. I think the flavor is good but this mixture just doesn't grab ahold of scallops.

Quick and Easy!  This is the first time I attempted to make scallops at home and they were delicious!  I had a little trouble with the breading not completely sticking to the scallops but all-in-all...would recommend to others. Thanks for the tip about the Old Bay...it was a good addition.  Will make again for sure!

The use of the light cream in lieu of something like egg/egg whites made it so the breading didn't stick as well and half of the scallops were missing the coating after cooking/flipping.  In addition, a touch of salt and pepper goes a long way to finishing and rounding the flavor of this dish - that said, when I added the salt/pepper (and a small drizzle of lemon over each scallop), they tasted superb.  Follow my lead and this 3-star recipe can become a 5 star.

I think most of the problem with the breading not sticking to the scallops is that you need to make sure the scallop is dry. Pat with a paper towel to dry off then coat in flour seasoned with salt and pepper then coat with above ingredients. Turns out great.

My family really liked this recipe but I could not get the batter to stick to the scallops.  I mixed one egg and some of the cream together thinking that the little bit of egg would help do the trick but it did not help.

Quick, easy and DELICIOUS.  I was looking for a different way to cook my scallops...somewhere between deep fried and baked and this was perfect.  I used Panko bread crumbs and Parm cheese and put in a blender so they would be super fine.  I still had a problem with the coating staying attached.  I didn't try using eqq since I wanted a non-egg taste.  I am making them again and will try the Old Bay and the next time the dill.
This will now be my "go-to" scallop recipe

I thought this was a great way to prepare scallops. I like some heat, and I loved the suggestion of using old bay. I also did not have light cream, or any cream so I used the egg wash (no flour) I added old bay about a tsp, and about a tsp of black pepper. I used the pressing technique, but there is fine line as the scallops will break if you press to hard. Either way, the texture of the scallops, and just the right heat in the batter, and the flavor, I will make again, for company. It will impress!!

Wow! These are amazing. I used fat free sour cream instead of the cream and packaged breadcrumbs and had no trouble with coating sticking. It  also cut down on the fat and calories. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I used Ritz cracker crumbs mixed with the parmesan cheese and it turned out great.  No problem with the breading staying on.  Instead of breading the scallops one-by-one, I put them all in the zip lock back with the breading and made sure to coat them all and then press the breading into them within the bag.  Made them with rice pilaf and asparagus.  I'll definitely make this again.

Loved the flavor that came through in this recipe. Followed exactly and took other reviewers suggestion to pat dry, and still lost over half of the delicious breading :(    I will Definitely try again and hope to preserve the crunch because what I did have on them was an incredible pairing to the sweetness of the scallops themselves.

It was great! Used eggs, bread crumbs and grated Parmesan. I added Italian seasoning and cilantro to the egg mixture. Then I added butter, white wine and minced garlic to the pan before I fried the scallops up! Soooo scrumptious!

Simple & Tasty!!! These scallops are really simple to prepare & not too difficult to cook. The only hard part is flipping them over halfway thru the cooking time.

I used the milk, added the seafood seasoning and used Italian bread crumbs, as some reviewers suggested. Not a problem having the coating staying on the fish. I did "push" it on as suggested. I think the trick of cooking scallops is only turning them once, more than that the breaking doesn't stick.

This was a wonderful recipe!  But like a lot of reviewers, I changed up some ingredients.
I used Panko crumbs instead of crackers and used the egg wash instead of milk.  The butter was too rich, so I split it half and half with EVOO.  The result was super delicious!

The taste is out of this world but I have problem with the breading as well. Mine turned out looking so bad with scallops and pieces of breading all over the place. Squeeze some lemon juice it taste heavenly. I also added old bay and ground pepper.
