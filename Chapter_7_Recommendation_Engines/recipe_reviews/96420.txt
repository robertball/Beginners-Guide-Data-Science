I have been wanting to try this recipe for a while now, so today I went to my favorite pretzel shop with this recipe in mind...I can not believe I waited so long to try this...I was NOT disappointed! This was excellent! The only change I made was to use chive and onion cream cheese, as that was all that I had. YUM! YUM! YUM! A definate keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

mmmmm!  I was looking for a crab pretzel recipe & found this one.  I used pretzels from the philly pretzel factory.  Could only find 6 oz can of crabmeat so I used 2 6oz cans.  Added some old bay.  Baked them in the oven for 15 mins....they were a little hard, so next time I'll probably heat up the crab mixture in the oven first & then put it on top of the pretzels with the cheese & only do 5 mins in the oven.....other then that....fantastic!!!

My son saw the recent cover of "Baltimore" magazine, and started drooling over the crab pretzel pictured...hence my search through trusty Allrecipes for something similar.  This was delicious exactly as is.  Having said that, I am looking forward to varying this recipe as well (no horseradish, add Old Bay?)  I may even try making homemade pretzels (I used frozen soft pretzels...) Thanks for the inspiration and for making my son smile!!
