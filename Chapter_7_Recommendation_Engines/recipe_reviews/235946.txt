There is no need to make this recipe so complicated.  If you add just a small amount of extra flour, the dough holds together enough to shape without having to wait for it to chill.  It does not affect the taste or texture at all.  Also, I didn't use baking sheets.  I rolled them into balls, dipped in sugar, and put in mini muffin tins with cupcake liners.  Then, you don't have to worry about cracking or spreading.  I baked in a pre-heated oven for 6 minutes, removed, added the kisses, and baked for an additional 3 minutes.  No need to rotate the pans.  There is just no need to keep opening the oven. Keep it closed and let them bake.   I shaved three minutes off the time as written.  Perfection and much easier than the way it's written!

Caliboo - I like your tip on using mini muffin tins :)  In my oven, i need to rotate pans since i bake 4 dozen cookies on 2 large cookie sheets per bake cycle. Each baker knows their oven (or should!) and will decide whether rotating is needed or not, but I get a more consistent color/even bake when rotating. Adding flour will affect the texture and flavor. Flour stiffens the dough, which may help hold the form of the cookie/prevent spread, but makes it more dry and crumbly when baked. Chilling instead will preserve shape without impairing flavor or texture. 

The the couple folks with negative reviews stating they were dry/crumbly, all i can say is you did it wrong somehow. You skipped an ingredient or changed the batch yield perhaps, but as i previously commented, i forgot the milk once and knew immediately it was a MAJOR problem. the dough was crumbly before baking without milk, but even adding it after dough was mixed still saved the batch. 

Regarding batch yield. Allrecipes changed my title from which had said DOUBLE BATCH. They left my ingredient list as written, but the yield shown on the published version is 4 doz, which is incorrect. This recipe yeilds about 8-10 doz, depending how small you roll the balls. (I aim for no bigger than 1.25" diameter cookies when baked, or about 2+ tsp of dough)

I agree with the original poster. You must chill the dough. Simply adding more flour alters the overall taste. I've tried making them both ways, and the chilled dough is by far the best.  Please follow the directions and use shortening. I used Crisco Butter Flavored Shortening and the cookies were fantastic. I've used butter in the past when I didn't have shortening on hand, and the cookies aren't as fluffy. Also, for those who say you don't need to bake the Hershey Kiss - you're missing out on what makes this cookie great!  If you don't bake the Kiss, it's a hard piece of chocolate in a soft cookie. Baking the Kiss changes the density. It sits back up, but loses the harsh firmness and melts in your mouth. Yes, if you let the cookies cool you can stack the baked Kisses. :)

Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was exactly the kind of blossom/kiss cookie recipe I was looking for.  Soft, chewy, full.  I've had others that are more along the lines of a traditional peanut butter cookie on the bottom, crunchier texture, flat, greasy tasting... Not this one.  I prefer when the cookie holds it's  shape and comes out thicker and soft, and this recipe fit the bill. Made them yesterday with my 4 year old son and we had a blast doing it together.  Ate one his morning and they are yummy!  The baking times were spot on for me.  The only issue I had was that my kisses seem to want to pop off the cookie... But really, who cares?!

These are more my husband's favorite. He loves them though. Though mysteriously the kisses sometimes just disappear off a few cookies. My son (with a chocolatey mouth) can't figure it out either.

This recipe is great! I didn't refrigerate the dough I just went on to the next step and they turned out just fine. I also didn't put the chocolate on then put them back in the oven. The cookies will be plenty hot enough after they are completely cooked to make the kiss nice and gooey.

Best blossoms ever!  I chose this recipe because of the amount of peanut butter.  It was more than the other recipes I found.    If I'm going thru the trouble of making this type cookie I want it to taste like it!  

I had to substitute the peanut butter for almond butter (because I have two children with peanut allergies) and I used a 1/2 cup of butter instead a full cup of shortening - but everything else was the same.  My DH ate half a sheet which is saying something.  He is very lean and fit and has amazing self control when it comes to eating.  He made a point to tell me to remember this recipe because it's one of the best cookies he's ever had.

Best peanut butter blossoms I ever made - this is the recipe you want - followed instructions exactly as written and baked as written. Let my dough sit overnight in frig. I did not need two bags of kisses, made 77 cookies -  I rolled in a sparkling courser sugar - make cookies look pretty - cooled as suggested and froze with wax paper between layers of cookies - in plastic container - still taste as fresh as day I baked them. Thank you Ramsey for this cookie recipe - a keeper.

Soft texture and delicious flavor.  I followed the recipe as written and was very pleased with the results.   The advice about cooking time at the bottom of the recipe was very helpful.  I will be baking this version again and again.

I have never made PB Blossoms but have a customer who loves them.  These are great. My daughter, sil, and 21 yo gdaughter were here and ate them right out of the oven. BIG HIT! Mine are a little bigger than the recipe says but baked good in 9-10 min. I like that they are soft.  Family took 1/2 the left overs.  Will take some to my customer for her review..I know they will be a big hit

I have made several recipes of this cookie. This recipe has been the nicest one I have made yet. I have a few left and they are almost at 10 days old and still soft and moist.   Be sure to remove when cookies are set  and  not cracked.

This recipe helped to create such delicious cookies.  I lost the  recipe that I used last year and thankfully found this one.  The finished product from this recipe tastes far better than the one from last year.  This is now in my favorites so I can't lose it!!

Best cookies ever! I made them for Christmas and they were a hit. I did have to bake them a few minutes longer than suggested. I do have a convection oven so maybe the lower temperature was why I had to bake them longer. I like adding the kisses before they are done baking and baking them for 2 more minutes. This allowed the kisses to stick to the cookie and not fall off. They came out perfect!

Don't change anything! These are the best peanut-butter blossoms I've made, and I've been through a few recipes now. Everyone who tries them agrees. This is the recipe you've been looking for!


Edit: For those at high altitude (5000+ feet), at around 5300 feet, I cook them at 11 minutes first, then 3 minutes after the kisses are added and they come out perfect.

I loved this recipe. The cookies were light and not too sweet. I believe it was because of the shortening instead using butter. I made them a little larger than normal and baked them 11 min then added the choc kiss for 2 more min. Great recipe !

yummy cookies,  just as I remember them. I did chill the dough but only because I ran out of time to make these on the day allotted. Made them 2 days later and they were great! I made the cookies a bit larger than called for and baked for 10 minutes before popping in a kiss. I then baked them for about 4 more minutes. After letting the cure for about 3 hours, the cookies are not raw at all. I would say they are more soft and chewy. : )

I read a few of the  reviews before deciding to try this recipe. One poster suggested changes to the  ingredient measurements and baking times. Then I saw the original posters reply. For this reason I decided to make the recipe as is. Only two things I changed. 1. I completely forgot to put vanilla extract in the dough.  cookies were delicious in spite of that.  2.  I made the dough before I began cooking dinner, then put the dough in the fridge. We made them after dinner, so it was  in the fridge for about 2 1/2 hours before baking. These cookies are phenomenal! They hold together well but are still soft and chewy, and the kisses themselves are just the right amount of soft for  biting into.   Thank you so much for a great recipe!

I used butter instead of shortening and made them bigger so I cooked them a little longer. They are delicious and just as you said, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. Thanks!

I will share the tip from another Peanut Butter Blossom recipe on All Recipes: sub 1/2 the white sugar with confectioners sugar. It really does help stiffen the dough, without adding extra flour, and it improves the texture as well as cuts down on spreading. (Though you can also use butter flavor Crisco in the recipe and that helps with that too.) I didn't have any Kisses to use, but have made it before and never added to oven after doing so. Still, will try that next time. Very dependable recipe.

I made this recipe exactly  to perfection and my cookies just turned out  "Awesome!"  My wife loved them very much and it made enough to fill one Christmas popcorn  tin.  I even made some without the Hershey Kiss in the middle and used the fork criss-cross motion on them.  I would definitely make them  all over again with the same recipe . As Tony the tiger says, "Therrrrrrrre Great!"

Wonderful recipe. Much more peanut butter than others I have made. I use insulated cookie sheets which require a longer cooking time. I was lazy and did not roll them in the sugar. They looked really nice with the striped kisses.

The only change I made (I'm not sure this counts as a change to the recipe) is that I put the chocolates on the cookies after they were done baking.  I'm glad I did because I think the chocolates would have completely melted had I stuck them in the oven for three minutes.   Thank you for the recipe!  It was my first time making these cookies and they came out super yummy! I'm looking forward to making them again soon : )

After reading other reviews, I added another cup of flour instead of chilling the dough for an hour. They turned out beautifully.

I made these just as the recipe directed without any revision on ingredients  and was very pleased. The only thing I did change was that I didn't rotate the cookies in the oven after the first batch.  It didn't seem to make any difference either way.  Very tasty and I will make these again.

Idk if it is because I used just unsalted butter or what. The eggs and butter we're room temp. And dough was still WET. When I put it in fridge for hour it felt runny I had to add about 1-1/2 cup more flour. I don't think I'll be making these anytime soon I'll stick to the recipe on food Network or in my cookbooks. Did try the herdhey kiss in last 2 min. That worked.

I followed directions exactly, refrigerated dough overnight, and used a small scoop. Recipe made 90 cookies, 30 of which I left plain with no kisses (fork criss cross). Baked 6 min, rotated and baked 3 more mins then 2 min with kisses. Plain cookies 6 min, rotate and 5 more. Perfect!

I followed recipe exactly as written, but I baked at 375 (out of tollhouse cookie habit) for 9-10 minutes. I put the kiss on immediately after taking out of oven--I did not put them back in oven. I've had some disasters with Hershey Kiss Chocolate Pretzels so I didn't want to risk it. :) I had chilled dough for about an hour. Perfect. Love that they have a lot of pb!

These taste amazing! The only thing I changed was the timing. I put them in for 5 minutes, put the kisses on and back in for 4 more. When I did it the original way the bottoms burned, but that could be an oven issue. This way, cookies were super fluffy and not burned. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe to the 'T' and although they look really nice, I found the inside of the cookies were still somewhat raw. I have a temperature gauge in my oven, so that's not the problem; I let them bake 9 minutes before putting on the kisses and back in the oven for another two minutes. They'll get eaten though!

These have exceptional flavor! I disagree with the review about not cooling the dough.  Its necessary so you don't over bake, it makes the center chewy and the outer crunch.  The only changes I made were to add 1/4 cup of flour to make the dough hold better and I didn't put them back into the oven when the kisses were placed.  The heat from the cookie was enough.  I'll use this recipe again.

These are seriously delicious - I could eat a half-dozen with a cup of coffee without blinking! Just don't overbake.

I substituted salted butter for the shortening, and did not chill the dough prior to molding (or add any extra flour - no need, rolled out just fine). I also just added the chocolate when they came out of the oven. 

These have a nice peanut butter flavor, and worked well for both the peanut butter blossoms (I used mini Reese's cups) and as classic peanut butter cookies (with a forked #). They don't brown much - any longer than 9 minutes in the oven and they became too crumbly and dry.

Needs more sugar and peanut butter...my one daughter wanted a few cookies without the kisses and those tasted weird like something was missing.  Next time I'm adding a little more pb and a little more brown sugar perhaps

Another classic we make every year for our Christmas baking. My daughter and I followed the recipe except we used an assortment of Hershey Kisses. I prefer the plain chocolate, but she likes all the different kinds of kisses we use.

These were a hit! I made one change: I used half shortening, half butter, because I really prefer the flavor of butter. I refrigerated the dough for a couple hours and it was easy to work.  I did give them a couple minutes in the oven after topping with chocolate kisses. I think they taste better and hold together better that way. Great recipe!

These were good, just not sweet enough, but the kiss helped. Easy to make. Only thing I changed is I added a few more minutes in the oven, so they were more golden.

Made for the first time this Christmas.  Delicious!  Much better flavor and texture than the recipe on the back of the kisses bag!  Strong peanut butter taste, which I love. Moist and light and not too dense - just perfect.  Definitely chill the dough - you won't need as much flour, so texture is much better.  The only change I made was not putting them back in the oven after inserting kisses, because I didn't actually read that part until I went to write this review.  Seems unnecessary, but I might try it next time just to see.

The cookies were a bit too crunchy for my liking.

I used colored sugar since it's Christmas. The cookies are light and soft and I have to say I like the little "crack" around the edges. I will make them again.

This is the same recipie that is on the back of the kisses package. The only difference is the recipie as written (48) is double the measurements on package. However, both say they yield approx 4 dozen. *shrug

I made this exactly as written. The only thing I did differently was I did not my rotate the pans at 3minutes because my oven heats pretty evenly. The cookies looked great and the taste was ok, but something was missing. I thought they tasted very one note. I'm not sure if they needed more salt or perhaps a pinch of cinnamon but they had a very boring taste. I'll be sending them to work with my husband. He works with a bunch of guys that will eat anything. I will keep searching for the perfect peanut butter blossom recipe.

They were bad! Not nearly sweet enough. I think the recipe calls for too much flower.

Very good.  I cut recipe in half, making just over 3 dozen cookies.  The recipe doesn't list yield, but seemed like it called for a lot of kisses.  They were exactly as promised, soft yet firm enough for holding up the kisses.  I did turn the pan halfway through baking but didn't  bother putting the kisses on early and returning to oven.  Instead I just added kisses after 12 mins total, then left cookies on pan on top of the oven until chocolate was just getting shiny then removed to cool on rack.

These are so delicious, I've had some that are so dry and crumbly and these are just perfect. I cooked the cookies first and then added the kisses as I did not want them to melt (I decorated the kisses as Christmas Trees with some green icing and sprinkles) I will definitely use this recipe again and again

Awesome! I made the gluten free version of this recipe because my husband can't have gluten. It turned out great! I substituted gluten free Pamela's baking mix and almond flour for the regular flour and added a little xanthan gum for the right texture.

Very good cookie, a family favorite at the holidays. Cookie is not the chewy base but a tasty cookie.

Great recipe.  Have husband's grandmother's recipe and it never worked out so tried this one and they were perfect - nice and fluffy (use to always end up flat).  Wonder if it's because I kept the dough chilled?
