I made this for a party.  Used chicken and no rice.  It was a big hit. Planning on making it again.

This turned out really good. I did make a couple of changes. Hubs is picky when it comes to tomatoes so I blended the can instead of leaving them in dice. My other change was with the rice. I didn't realize the only brown rice I had was minute rice and we know that wouldn't have stood up to the total cook time. I made it after the pork was done and mixed it in that way. I made burritos out of the filling and they were a huge hit.
