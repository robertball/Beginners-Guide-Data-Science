Very nice soup.  Personally, I agree that this recipe is too spicy for my taste.  Next time, I'll take the author's advice, and cut back on the amount of green curry paste.  A previous reviewer's suggestion for adding a 1/2 cup of rice is also a good idea.

I wish to comment on some of the other reviews posted here:  It's absurd to rate a recipe you haven't made.  When you radically change the recipe before making it, well...you haven't exactly made the recipe, have you?  Very minor modifications are one thing.  Cutting the broth in half, so it isn't a SOUP, or replacing a carrot for onions and bell peppers are not minor modifications.  Reviewers on this site constantly take liberty with recipes (which is great, I do too), but then rate the recipe they radically change. It's a disservice to the recipe author.

This was soooo good. We made it with half the chicken broth also because I thought it would get too watery. I thought we had carrots but I was wrong. So I cut half a yellow onion into strips and sauteed that instead with the garlic. It was just like the curry you get at a thai restaurant. We had this over rice. I also looked at my jar of curry paste which recommended adding 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Next time I'll probably add the carrots and maybe green peppers. It was so good. We'll definitely be making this again.

I doubled the recipe but did 2 full carrots and used red curry paste instead. I did one can of lite coconut milk and one can of regular and I used 1/2 cup of pre-made lime juice instead. I thought this was good but I think it needs less chicken broth (like 3 cups for 4 servings) to make it thicker like similar soups I've had and it would probably benefit from some rice (especially basmati rice) and maybe some ground peanuts. Overall good (and smells REALLY good) but needs some tweaking.

I must have gotten the mildest jar of curry in the batch. I purchased a 4 oz bottle of Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste and following directions added 2 T. (I had doubled soup recipe because it sounded delish and got good reviews and I was really hungry!) Then I added another T. Then another! It didn't take long before I had emptied the jar into the soup and was barely aware of any spices. So either everyone in the world than me is a weenie or I got a particularly mild bottle. As for the soup spicy or not it was delicious. However I review it delicately because as someone pointed out if you change the recipe radically then you really can't comment on the original recipe. I forgot to pick up green onions so I ended up using a roughly chopped white onion. And then I had some red and green peppers leftover in the fridge and knowing how pretty that would look I roughly chopped the peppers and threw them in. (It did look pretty: the red and green of the peppers and the ornage of the carrots against the pale chartreuse of the soup.) Then because I was still looking for bite I started sprinkling in caynee but I stopped rpetty quickly because it was changing the oclor of the soup. I will state that the soup was good and then adding the fresh squeeze leime juice made it go: "POW!" Totally took it up 4 star. Bon apetit!

We loved this with a few additions. Doubled the recipe but did not double the coconut milk. Added extra garlic and yellow onion to start. Added red curry paste and curry powder to intensify flavor. Also at the end I tossed in drained can of chopped tomatos fresh spinach and fresh cilantro. Also used thighs not breasts. Served over a small mound of rice. PERFECT!!!!!!! Could not stop eating it!

Yum yum yummy! This soup was so good there wasn't even a drop left in the pot when we were done. The only ingredient that I added was 1/2 cup of cooked basmati rice that I had leftover in my refrigerator. My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe.

This soup was ok...but not memorable. The spiciness/pungency of the curry paste you use must vary significantly because 1 tbs did not make mine very flavorful or at all spicy. We were dumping red pepper and soy sauce in our bowls to give it more flavor. I used Thai Kitchen brand which i've enjoyed for other recipes...but if I make this again i'll have to add more than called for even though other reviewers said theirs turned out too spicy. You really have to season to taste with this one. I also added some celery yellow onion and red bell pepper which was nice. I'll also add less stock so its thicker if there is a next time.

This was very tasty with half of the chicken stock and slightly less than the recommended green curry paste. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was because I used a can of whole coconut milk and that made the dish VERY heavy. Be aware that this may be easier to digest with light coconut milk but perhaps not as tasty. Very yummy otherwise!

I made this recipe exactly as was instructed. It had very little flavor weird consistancy and was not in the least bit spicy. The only flavor I could get from the soup was butter it tasted like chicken in liquid butter sauce and I could not eat it. The other people who ate dinner with me that night ate the food but it's not something I would ever make again it was flavorless...except that butter taste...

This soup could not be easier and really hit the spot on a cold gray night. I adjusted the seasoning after the first tasting--a tablespoon more green curry and a tablespoon of brown sugar.

Wow this was pretty spicy! Not quite as sweet as your typical thai green curry but okay. I added green bell peppers too which made it nice.

I agree with Sola's modifications. It tastes very nice and is very spicy. Next time I try this out I will cut the amount of chicken in half to give my wallet more mileage and add potatoes maybe broccoli and perhaps chopped onion. Also I'll probably use less chicken broth than Sola used half what the original recipe called for to make it thicker and serve with an equal portion of rice.

This is a fantastic recipe. I made this for my family today for supper. A few hours after eating my husband asked for more. The soup is gone. I usually have leftovers which sit in my refrigerator for a few days but this soup only lasted for a few hours. I only made a few changes. I didn't have onions so I added an extra clove of garlic. I also added cilantro just because it adds to the appearance and flavor and used vegetable broth because I didn't have chicken broth. I also used leftover cubed chicken from the other day. I will definitely make this soup again. This has to be my favorite soup I've ever made. Thank you for such a great recipe.

We only had light coconut milk and we used less of the green curry paste so it wouldn't be too spicy for kids. i wouldn't make this again.

I started out doubling this recipe but as I progressed I began to realize that this was going to be way too thin for my liking. I ended up using 1/2 the stock and 1/4 of the coconut milk and still ended up putting a big pile of rice in the bowl before serving. Also I did not find this particularly spicy but that may be the curry paste's fault. Otherwise the flavor is excellent.

Great! I cooked up the chicken breast and shredded it instead of cubing but that's more of a cosmetic change. Also shredded the carrot instead of dicing (apparently I just don't like cubes). Spice was perfect exactly the heat I'd expect from a thai curry soup. Served over rice. Will make again!

I chose this recipe because it didn't require a ton of ingredients and my husband loves curry. The first time I made it I left out the carrots because he hates them. He thought it was good except that he did not think it was spicy enough. The next time I made it I changed it up a bit and he was much happier with it. I used red curry instead of green and doubled the amount to 2 T. Again I left out the carrots. To give it some substance I also added stir-fry rice noodles. Sometimes I use green onions (if I have them) and sometimes I don't. We like it either way. I've made this recipe numerous times and plan to continue making it.

Excellent!!! Added sweet potatoes, carrots and celery and used Better Then. Broth for more chicken flavor. Light yet satisfying and leftovers heated up nicely! This will be one of my faves for a lunch group and for cold winter nights!!!

I made this tonight as I had been craving a creamy curry soup. I used red curry paste instead of the green and added some Maifun Rice sticks. It was delicious. I highly recommend it.

so yummy. I made this for our "soup-er" bowl contest and won. I did add a Thai Red Curry Rub/Seasoning and I think that is what really made this recipe. Delicious and easy.
