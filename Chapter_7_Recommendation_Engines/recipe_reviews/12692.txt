In a hurry last night looking for something easy for my husbands birthday, I quickly found this, and made it before he got home.  I didn't even realize until this morning that it was a recipe from Corwynn!  I should have known.  So far all of her recipes that I've tried have been easy and delicious.  And this one was no different.  So smooth, creamy, rich...and easy!  Thanks Corwynn!

The filling was quite creamy and tasty but the crust did not cook all the way on the bottom.
