I will definitely make it again. My husband has developed a red meat allergy and he loved it!  Thanks Brian!

Very easy and tasty. Nice change from standard red sauce and would work with any kind of sausage.

This recipe was fantastic.  I use pork sausage instead of chicken sausage because thatâ€™s what I had on hand. And I had everything else on hand. I look forward to making this in the future.
