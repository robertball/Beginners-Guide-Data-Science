I used cubed steak rather then veal. I also used a electric skillet so I could  control the temp better. I set it to 350 and didn't put the steaks in till it was at that temp. I cooked them about 10 mins on each side. I didn't have any problems with the coating falling off.
Served with mashed potatoes and a veg...

This is not traditional southern chicken fried steak--it's more like wiener schnizel and would be good with fresh lemon juice squeezed on after cooking.  Traditional chicken fried steak uses top round or bottom round steak, sometimes cube steaks, and is always served with cream gravy, mashed potatoes or rice, and turnip greens (I prefer fresh spinach cooked).  Some people used a combination of beef broth and milk in the cream gravy, but the traditional cream gravy uses only milk and is well peppered and salted.

I've tried several Chicken Fried Steak recipes and this is a good one! Don't forget to double dip in your eggs and flour. I added some garlic powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the flour for a little pow. Mashed potatos and gravy are a must with this (and corn for us). Tonight I used a can of cream of mushroom soup for my quickie gravy. Cooked in one of my trusty cast iron skillets made this a lip smacker with no leftovers. Thank you!

Virginia, this is a wonderful recipe for sure. My daughter, her boyfriend and his parents were headed back from Six Flags last night and while on the phone I asked my daughter what "Arnie" wanted for dinner Sunday night. He proclaimed "Chicken Fried Steak"! I've made it before, but wanted to find a different recipe and I'm so glad I did. It was a huge hit, for he's the pickiest twenty year old I've ever met. In my flour mixture I used garlic and onion powders, paprika, salt and pepper and a bit of cayenne. If it wasn't for the fact that he also requested fetticini alfredo (low fat dinner right?) I would have used some of the drippings to make a gravy. After coating the cube steaks I used for this dish, I let it sit for about ten minutes and had no problem with the breading falling off while frying. Thanks again Virginia for a great recipe!!

This was good. My husband loved it. I used cubed steaks instead and added a lil onion powder and garlic powder to the flour. I made sure my oil was hot before placing steak into it that way the coating stays put and doesn't come off. I'll be making this again in the future.

Made this tonight for dinner, and my husband LOVED it!  I also made poor man's gravy and mashed potatoes to go with the steak.  Nice comfort food for the winter months!

One correction... I am from Texas home of the chicken fried steak! Chicken fried steak is tenderized flank steak or strip steak cooked like fried chicken. You make chicken fried veal.

This was a good base-recipe, but it wouldn't have come out half so well if I hadn't made it with a lot of changes.  I scaled the recipe down to two servings and mixed 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, a teaspoon of onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a dash each of paprika and cayenne pepper into the flour before breading.  Instead of frying in oil, I liberally coated the pan with olive oil cooking spray, and I used steak instead of veal.  I cooked each steak for four minutes on each side, and that was perfect.  My husband was *thrilled.*  The only problem was that I forgot that I wouldn't be able to make gravy without the oil, and the steaks would have been best with a gravy of some sort.

I don't know if you can say that I actually made this recipe or not. I used the idea of it though. Read a lot of other reviews on adding ingredients for flavor and wasn't going to take the chance of my first attempt at chicken fried steak to not have flavor. I added paprika, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and seasoning salt along with the salt and pepper that was mentioned. I fried mine in my electric skillet with "EVOO" at 375. Fried to a golden brown. Yum The family loved it and that says a lot for my picky 7 year old, he said it was "Awesome".

I really love simple recipes like this. I especially like the flour/egg/flour prep too. I always use thin-sliced chicken breasts and add extra seasonings to the flour. Quick, easy, and total comfort food. Round out this recipe with some mashed potatoes, country gravy and corn, and you've got a very satisfying meal.

I used chuck steak for this recipe.  I also added garlic, oninon, paprika and cayenne.  I still had no flavor to it.  I had to drown it in country gravy.

I thought this turned out very yummy. One major tip - pound the crud out of the meat and get it as thin as you can. Otherwise you keep cooking it to get the meat done and burn the coating in the meantime. One reviewer said this was more like schnitzel, actually it is more like schnitzel only because you are pan frying it. If you want the traditional style chick fried steak you gotta deep fry it.

I would not normally make this, but my husband loves chicken fried steak and asked me to make it. The recipe was easy to follow and the meat came out nicely. My 5 year old ate it and my husband seemed pretty pleased, although "it's still not like mom's"  grrrrrr....

I've tried to make Chicken Fried Steak a couple times before from different recipes and they have always turned out very poorly.  But this one was GREAT!  The only thing I changed was the kind of meat and the temperature setting, due to the type of meat.  I used T-bone steak and medium heat setting, and it turned out so tender and delicious!  My picky 3 year old son loved it so much he asked for seconds.  And it was so tender that he was able to chew it with no problem.  And the fact that this recipe was so easy was even better, THANKS!

Very good recipe. I used another reviewers idea of using an electric skillet set at 350. Fried for 10 minutes on each side and turned out great. I thought the color was very nice. I served this with homemade mashed potatos, packaged country gravy, and steamed veggies. Thanks so much!
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I used cube steak instead of veal.

I am giving this 4 stars because I followed the changes of some other reviewers. But it turned out great so bump it up to a 5 with changes. I added the garlic and onion powder plus a dash of cayenne pepper. Used tenderized cube steak. Double dipped in the egg and flour mixture. Used a McCormick's country gravy just to save some time(daughter likes to make that). It went over great with everyone.

I kinda used part of this recipe for reference and part of Emeril Lagasse's Country Fried Steak with white gravy.  I was actually surprised no gravy recipe was added to this when the picture clearly has gravy in it.  I also used chicken breast and made it chicken fried chicken because I had no steak.  Just pounded it thin.  Turned out fabulous.  Gravy is to die for that I made.  Used about 1/4 cup of the drippings from the chicken I fried and added flour to it.  Brought to a small boil and added milk a little at a time mixing with a whisk vigorously.  About 3 cups of milk.  Just stir til it thickens.  Viola.  Gave it 3 stars because it just wasn't complete and had gravy on it and no recipe.  Had to find that on my own.  Also, add plenty of salt and pepper to season it.  Just taste if before you add more salt.  :)

Okay.  This recipe is excellent for method, but vague for flavor.  I used peanut oil in a chicken fryer and made up a batch of gravy with the pan scrapings.  As for the seasonings, I used equal amounts of ground oregano, ground thyme, ground marjoram, cayenne, paprika, chili powder, white pepper, black pepper and sage (about 1/4tsp each for the 2 cups of flour).  Instead of veal, I used minute steaks.  Minute steaks required about 4 minutes per side.  Enjoy!

This was good, but not as good as others I have tried.  I used beef cube steak rather than veal, but that is just my personal taste preference.

I threw in a little cornmeal into the flour and fancy schmany garlic and italian herbs and it just kind of felt...blah still. I made up my own gravy to top it off, but the whole thing just needed something else. It wasn't terrible, but it just needed a little something more.

I'd never had chicken fried steak before, so maybe I don't know what's what, but I wasn't too impressed. It was ok, but didn't live up to the hype.

This is SO good! I used beef cubed steak in lieu of veal and added garlic powder and paprika. What a great recipe! I made gravy, too, and it was perfect with buttery mashed potatoes.

Great tasting recipe!  Too bad it doesn't look the same.  I made this with cubed beef steaks and my own blend of seasonings including garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  I made a cream gravy on the side.  My husband and I both enjoyed this dish, but my only complaint would be that it didn't brown beautifully at all.  It was a ruddy instead of golden brown.  Could it be the egg?

This isn’t chicken fried steak it’s a veal cutlet. Steak is beef.

This was pretty good.  It was the first time I made Chicken Fried Steak and this recipe was pretty easy to make.  I used cube steak instead of veal and I put garlic powder, salt and pepper, and paprika in the flour  I double dipped my steaks and let them sit for about 10 minutes before I fried them.  I didn't have any trouble with the breading falling off.  I did have to use 4 eggs instead of 2.  I made mashed potatoes and cream gravy to go with  them.   I will make this again, but probably not until it is a lot cooler coutside.

I used cube steak rather than the veal cutlets and 10 minutes per side of fry time was too much. The steaks came out over cooked and the breading was starting to burn a bit. I also used two cups of flour and two eggs, per the recipe but I ended up with way too much flour left over and not enough egg. I'll have to play with the recipe a bit to more to get it right.

We enjoyed this recipe. We used buffalo minute steaks which had great flavor but are a little more chewy than beef. Overall a great dinner.

This was good but I am having such a problem keeping the breading on the steak.  It keeps falling off.  I have two different ways of breading the steak and it didn't work.  I found third method which hopefully will work.

Great recipe. I used the thin sliced chicken breast, added my own seasoning to the flour and fried in a fry daddy as I don't have a cast iron skillet yet. For gravy I used southeastern mills mix and garlic mashed potatoes.

I also used cube steak and loved this simple, delicious recipe. I didn't have herb seasoning, only salt & pepper but trust me, it won't matter. I'm looking forward to making it again and experimenting with herb seasoning and maybe even cayenne to give it a cajun kick!

This really didn't do it for me. I didn't really like the taste of breading on cube steak. In my opinion it's a lot better browned and simmered in gravy for a few hours.

Very good although I had to add extra "EVOO" and the timing was much less than 10 minutes a side on medium high heat.

I LIKED THIS RECIPE VERY MUCH. IT DIDN'T LEAVE THE MEAT ALL DRIED OUT OR TOUGH LIKE SOME OTHER RECIPES AND METHODS OF COOKING STEAK.
