This is one of my favorite quick salad recipes. I do cut the sugar back by half and I like to use white wine vinegar. This is also good with half mayonnaise/half sour cream. The longer this sits, the better it gets.

I'VE TRIED VARIOUS VERSIONS AND ONE DELETED THE SUGAR AND ADDED RAISINS AND SHREDDED CARROTS. TASTED YUMMY. THIS ONE IS GREAT WITH LESS SUGAR. I LIKE IT COLD BEFORE SERVING. WARM, NOT SO GREAT.

I love this recipe! I add 3/4 cup of Craisins. Folks always ask me to bring this to family and friend gatherings.

Love this salad!  I take a shortcut and use real bacon bits instead of frying the bacon, and add craisins and sunflower seeds.  Delish!

I cut back on the raisins and add small red grapes cut in half, and also a handful of chopped salted peanuts. I also use sour cream instead of mayo, and I always up the bacon because who doesn't like bacon?

This was just ok for us.  Being one of the first reviewers, I tried to follow the recipe to a "T", but had to make some adjustments to make it work.  The amount of dressing wasn't enough, so I need to make about 1/2 more.  I also prefer this w/much less sugar and more vinegar.  It's a very basic broccoli salad and easy to adjust to your personal tastes, but as written it's a bit dry and sweet for me.  THANKS, 1940's girl!

this is a nice recipe but a tad too sweet.  next time I will add less sugar, like 1 TBSP, I increased the vinegar to a TBSP instead of a tsp and used white balsalmic instead of the white distilled and used half light mayo and half light sour cream.....
