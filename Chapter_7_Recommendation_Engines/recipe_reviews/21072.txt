This is very similar to a recipe my sister in law makes for family get-togethers. It's always one of the most popular appetizers served. Her variation is that the cream cheese is incorporated into the mixture. It's easy to transport the chilled mixture and easy to unmold just before serving.  Goes great with buttery, round crackers or any other crisp cracker.

This was very good, but unless you like the taste of thyme, I would reduce the amount in the recipe by one half. The flavor was just too strong for my liking.
