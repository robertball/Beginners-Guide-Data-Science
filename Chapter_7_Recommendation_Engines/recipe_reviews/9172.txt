This was so good and so easy to make.  I made a few changes to mine though.  I used coctail peanuts (2 cups instead of 1) and added 1 tbs of butter to the mixture when I added the peanuts.  When I added the baking soda, I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  After it was cooled I covered the top (before breaking it) with a baking chocolate/peanut butter mixture.

Very good brittle.  I used plantars dry roasted lightly salted peanuts and it turned out fine.  I will pour it onto lightly greased foil next time as the foil stuck to the back of some pieces.  I didn't use a thermometer but instead followed the directions for the (dripping off the spoon and leaving hairs behind) It worked great.

I keep trying different peanut brittle recipes and I am always disappointed.  But this is the recipe I have been searching for.  It's the best peanut brittle I have ever had.  My husband just ate the whole batch.

I burned the first time? Waited too long. It kept cooking a little longer even after removing from the heat. Second time worked very well. It's light in a texture. I will add more nuts in next time...maybe half a cup or more. I also added 1 tsp salt to it too. Definitely make this again.

OMG!!!!  I have never made Peanut Brittle before and will not look for a different recipe.  The only thing I did different is add vanilla. I just feel every desert needs vanilla extract.  This was simple and delicous.  Gone as fast as I could break it up and I didn't even know they liked peanut brittle.

I made this for my gifts for all my friends and family for Christmas.  It was a huge HIT!  I also used almonds and pecans.  My tips:  add a dash of cinnamon when you add the baking soda.  STIR those nuts while they are comming up to temp.  It will take about 15 minutes.  Don't try to put the temp to high!  Sugar will be everywhere!  Spread FAST!  The brittle is easier to eat thin!  I made at least 10 batches.  I burnt the first 3!  Stir those nuts and use keep a constant eye on that temp.  Remember 15-20 minutes of stirring!

This recipe represented several firsts for me: my first candy of any kind (and my first time using a candy thermometer), and the first time I'd ever cooked with corn syrup.
I made it exactly as written, and it turned out fine, though I was a little nervous since candy-making seemed a bit mysterious and tricky before. It was very easy to make.
One note: my light corn syrup bottle said it was made "with real vanilla" - I don't know if this is how corn syrup usually comes, or if I should have gotten plain old corn syrup. I suppose the vanilla didn't hurt the recipe.
The addition of the baking soda was a neat trick - I never would have thought it went into peanut brittle, but it worked like a charm.
Now, I thought this recipe made a decent peanut brittle, as did The Woman I Love and several friends she shared it with. It disappeared pretty quickly. But we've been spoiled by years of consuming peanut brittle made by a certain West Coast candy-shop chain, so we're only giving this a 3-star rating. I was thinking - shouldn't peanut brittle have butter in it? I think adding butter to this might make it worthy of 4 stars. Still, I might make this again, since it's so easy and it makes a good amount of brittle. Thanks for the recipe!

I am sure the ingredient mixture is good but the hardest part was figuring out how long to let it cook before it burned. After 2 batches I gave up. I think it would be better with a better temperature or time limit in the directions.

So easy and yummy!! It's amazing what the baking soda does. In fact, the first batch I made I forgot to add it and it was just terrible.  FYI, start to finish, each batch takes just about 30 minutes.

This is great peanut brittle.  On my first batch, I wasn't sure how long to cook after I added the peanuts.  I checked another recipe that I had that said to cook to 300 degrees after adding the peanuts.  This was much better.  Turned out 'brittle' not sticky.   This recipe is certainly a keeper!

This brittle is the best brittle I have ever tasted, and is just like the brittle I grew up on! I did not have raw peanuts, so I just used Planters roasted lightly salted nuts. I added a tbls of butter when I added the nuts, and then a tsp. of vanilla with the baking soda. I popped the mix in the freezer and it hardened up VERY quickly (it's very humid where I live). I will definitely be making this many more times, and using it for Christmas gifts! :-) Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My Mother,Grace, sent me this candy recipe from the trailer park collection. I was skeptical. I don't make candy. But it turned out great;and everyone wants the recipe. I cook it in an electric fry pan at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, stiring. After adding baking soda, pour out quickly on a Silipat sheet. No sticking, no buttering foil; get a sheet at the kitchen suppy store; great for baking cookies. easy!

I made this recipe for my family for Christmas, and everybody liked it. I'm a 53 year old man, and if I can get good results with this recipe, anyone can!
It is better than the store bought peanut brittle I tried.

I had to give this rating of 1 so this message would post but honestly, I rate this a big 0.  My mixture never got the hard ball stage.  It went from liquid to BURN!  Yes, I followed the recipe, yes I used the suggested temperature.  This was going to be a contribution in the Christmas cookie exchange.  Thank goodness I tried it a few days beforehand, otherwise I would have been stuck with nothing.  Very disappointing.

I just made this brittle...DELICIOUS!!!! Like another reviewer I added a little butter and vanilla. I also used walnuts (my preference) instead of peanuts. This was my first time making any type of candy and I am pleased that it was this recipe I used. YUMMY!

Excellent.  I learned the hard way that it's easier in smaller batches so don't try to double it if you're new to this type of thing.  And it would have been helpful to know it takes a good 30 minutes to make.  I too added butter & vanilla and it tasted great!  Definitely use buttered foil, I figured a buttered glass plate would do...had to have my husband chizzle it off!

Nice and easy to make. Sticky and messy as usual for candy recipes! Only draw back for me in NZ I substituted the corn syrup for golden syrup, and when combined with the baking soda it ended up tasting more like hockey pockey brittle, I was looking more for the traditional peanut toffee brittle. Great post though thanks!

I love how fast and easy this is. I don't think it tastes great though but maybe I'm just not a brittle fan because everyone else I know loves it.

Very Dissapointing recipe. I boiled the sugar, corn syrup and H20 just like the recipe called for, but i didnt have a thermomemter. I boiled it for 20 mins. I tried doing the spoon thing and my mix never got quite that thick. then after cooling, it never hardened. I added vanilla, salt and butter to this recipe but according to other readers theirs was successful. i was making it for work so i was extremely upset it didnt turn out. Will not be making this again.

This recipe is awesome! I had to hide it so I didn't eat the whole batch. We did not use a candy thermometer, I just followed the instructions and it came out great.

The best and easiest peanut brittle I have ever made.  Easy instructions, I followed it to the letter.  After 4 batches I changed the peanuts to roasted, chopped almonds. It turned out great!

I have made this twice. The first time I used canned peanuts, and added 1/2 t of vanilla before adding the baking soda. The second time I used 3/4c canned peanuts and 1/4c planters hot peanuts, and 1/2t vanilla. They both came out great. The hot nut one had just a very little kick, but you had to eat a lot to notice it. Great recipe thanks for sharing

After years of tring peanut brittle recipes, this one is great, it took 15 minutes from start to finish. You have to practice for that perfect batch not too dark and not to light. Thanks to your Aunt Joyce!

I particularly like the cooking instructions.     Taking the syrup to hard ball. Adding the nuts, and then stirring until it turns out golden brown yields a quality brittle without burning.
     I am less pleased with the recipe itself.  First there is no salt, which if the nuts are not salted will yield a one dimensional sickly sweet brittle.     Second, there is no fat.  Adding three tablespoons of butter, will cause the crystals in the candy to "crunch" rather than break into rock hard shards you can impale your gums on.  I also doubled the batch, and added fifty percent more nuts.   I like my brittle to be nuts held together with candy rather than candy, with a few nuts sprinkled in.  And yes,  I made it with almonds.    Almost any raw nut will do.

Great recipe!  I have tweaked ours by adding twice the nuts. If you can't find raw nuts, we llike making pistachio or cashew brittle by using regular roasted cashews or pistachio (twice the amount listed in the recipe.  Because they are already roasted, they do not need to cook.  I add them just before a add the soda. These are always the first things gone from the platter!  People ask for this candy!

Excellent recipe! I made this two ways. First, according to the recipe as it appears (substituting "party peanuts" for the plain spanish). The second way was according to bearkat's suggestions.  Both were delicious!  I honestly don't prefer one over the other.  Both are wonderful! I used 2 cups of peanuts in the first batch and it seemed a bit much.  In the second batch I used 1 1/2 cups and it was perfect.  I think just one cup of peanuts wouldn't quite be enough.

I had never made peanut brittle before, but I know my way around a kitchen, so that was not an obstacle for me. I don't have a candy thermometer, so the hard ball test is what worked for me. (Drop a spoonful of syrup into cold water, and it will turn hard and solid.) I did add the butter and vanilla, but I think I will omit the vanilla next time. I did end up burning it a little, but not so bad that it tastes awful. I REALLY liked the texture of this brittle, it was fluffy, not dense and it made a tactile treat for my mouth!! I will be making this again!! (Only next time, I will not burn it.)

This turned out really well. I didn't change a thing. I didn't think it was going to make as much as it did, but when spread out on the pan I found out it makes quite a bit. Was a great hit at the holidays on the confection trays.

Great addictive recipe. I appreciated the comments about how to tell it is ready without a candy thermometer. WAIT for that clear spider webs and don't just kid yourself that it's close enough. I did that on my second batch and it wasn't peanut brittle... I renamed it "peanut rip out your fillings". This recipe is great!

I have made peanut brittle for fundraisers for years, but lost my recipe.  I found this one and added a half teaspoon of salt.  It literally is very simple.  I have also made it with toasted coconut.  Its very tasty that way!

Very good and easy. I could not find raw peanuts so I used regular canned, salted, spanish peanuts and they worked fine. WARNING! This foams up a lot! Use a pan that will allow your contents to at least double without spilling over. I also sprayed the foil with cooking spray and used the spread out and break apart tecnique. Yummy Stuff. I am making more to give out for the holidays.

Excellent!  I had to make two more batches right away because my husband ate it so fast! It tastes just like in the stores...even better! I did try to double the recipe, but found that it was easier to work with the smaller batches.   It would make a great christmas gift!

SO easy! We were skeptical because the recipe is so simple (no butter, etc.), but more than  pleasantly surprised. The end result got rave reviews. 

I'll use this again and again!

Thanks for sharing!

The easiest and best recipe for peanut brittle.  My family requests that I make this for every family gathering.  You can use any nut with this recipe.  Cashews work out very well!

I like it - mine seem to have a 'lighter' texture than traditional peanut brittle, and tasted fantastic.  Used lightly salted peanuts and did add about 1/2 tsp vanilla at the same time as the nuts.  Definately easy to make and will be added to the yearly Christmas Cookie list.

The taste is fine, but I had to dump my first batch b/c I missed the water and tried to add it on the back end.  Resulted in a pretty maple colored brittle, but probably would have burned if really cooked to brittle.  Since my nuts were raw, I think the finally recipe needed more salt, but otherwise, I was pleased.  Easy, fast, no fuss.

oh my..how easy.  I made this stuff on a regular basis back in my teens...and it just seems easier than before.  I did add about a teaspoon of cinnamon for a twist.  I have yet to bit into it..but, by the looks of it, I doubt anything went wrong.  Highly recommended.

After adding the peanuts, I cooked to almost 300 degrees, pulled off the heat and  added the soda, but also I added 1/2 tsp salt, 1 Tbsp butter and a tsp vanilla. I poured on a buttered pan and as it was cooling, I scored the brittle with a rubber spatula  into 1" x 1" size pieces.

This was an easy to follow recipe that turned out AWESOME!! especially for a first timer. I did however add a couple of things when I took off of the heat I addded 2 Tablespoons of butter with the baking soda and 1/2 cup of salted cashews and spread out on unbuttered foil to break up after cooling. This is a Keeper!

The flavor was great, but it was just far too chewey for my family. It snapped apart perfectly, but the second it hit your mouth it it attached to your teeth and it wouldn't come off. I'm not sure what you could change to avoid that. It did have great flavor though!

I took one reviewers advice and added 1 tsp of vanilla after the nuts. It took approx 10 minutes of stirring at med-high temp. I used a rubber spatula and poured the finished product into two silicone cake pans sprayed with Pam. Directions were simple to follow. I accidentally burned my finger on some of the candy, be careful it hurts! Candy turned out very good.

I love peanut brittle, this was my first time making it. I read the other reviews first and added in the 1 tsp of butter and 1 tsp of vanilla. The taste is yummi. I also do not have a candy thermometer so I used the spoon method.

Wow, this turned out great! We used Planters dry roasted peanuts. We used an extra half-cup of peanuts and added 1/2 tsp of salt (at the baking soda step). Also, we bought a $5 candy thermometer to take the guesswork out of it. :) We spread the mixture on buttered tinfoil. Quick, easy, delicious!

This was a very good peanut brittle recipe! My first time making it, and I am very pleased with the results. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used more peanuts than called for - I think I used about 1 1/2 cups. However I thought it would have been best with fewer peanuts... as the recipe says. :) I suppose it's all a matter of personal preference though. Great, easy-to-follow recipe!

Great recipe...I doubled the nuts and used roasted almonds. When it is cooling I sprinkle the top with semi-sweet chocolate chips and spread them on while warm. I then sprinkle with 1/2 cup chopped roasted Almonds. Lightly push them into the warm chocolate. Tastes just like other commercially bought products.

This was really simple and it came out great on the first try! Perhaps this was an amateur candy making mistake, but DON"T use a plastic spoon to stir, use a wooden one instead. I threw out a batch of plastic strand decorated brittle. ;)

Very simple recipe. Be patient and follow the "hair method" and it will turn out perfect every time. I was always afraid to make candy but this recipe was easy. It will definitely be a regular in my holiday recipe collection!

This is a really awesome recipe. Turned out first time I made it. And I even made changes to it. I used almonds instead of peanuts (because my husband is allergic to peanuts) and added a teaspoon of vanilla. It was soooo good!!! Everyone tells me that they now prefer almonds to peanuts in the brittle. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I have nevermade peanut brittle before.  I don't own a candy thermometer. & I did this easily & in less than 1/2 an hour.  I added vanilla - just because I felt like it should have some vanilla =)  but this was great & packed well - I'll let you know how it holds up in shipping to iraq!

Wonderful!!  I have always been afraid of making candy, but this recipe was SO easy.  The trick is the hair thing.  Trying to keep the hubby out of it as we speak, but I keep hearing that foil rustling in the kitchen every time I loose sight of him! Thanks for this recipe!

Perfect! Easy, and if you follow the instructions you do not need a candy thermometer. Do not leave this unattended... it does cook quickly! I liked taking mine to the edge of burned... nice and brown.

Easy to make turned out great. I took it to my moms for x-mas and everyone loved it and couldn't believe I made it. I made a second batch but ran out of white sugar and used 1/2 brown. Bad idea it was sooooo sticky. Not good made with brown sugar but perfect if made with white!!

very good recipe. the only thing I noticed is that the recipe says it needs to be heated to hard ball consistency when it actually needs to be heated to hard crack. but it's still delicious.

First time to make peanut brittle and it turned out perfect!! I would have liked a little more information regarding  the length of time to cook the mixture after adding the peanuts and before adding the baking soda. Mine did. Not turn darker. It did however get more opaque. I rushed the second batch and it turned out darker but the taste and consistency were excellent!! Great recipe.

I am pleased with this recipe.  Directions were especially good for me since I am not an experienced candy maker.  I love the taste and texture.  The only change I made in the ingredients is I used unsalted regular peanuts.

I have made this several times and it is so easy, but it does take some watching for it to come out right. Always use a candy thermometer and don’t be tempted to rush the process. I always use nonstick foil and have never had an issue with sticking and always use a nonstick pan while making this. Be sure to stir in the baking soda until the foaming has stopped and is stirred down; if you don’t, it will not look or taste like the brittle you love. I have made this as gifts for friends and family who say, ‘I don’t need anything’ or ‘just bring yourselves’; that’s just not me and this gift is always appreciated.

This recipe scared me at first, but it was so easy to do. I made 3 batches and my family ate every last bit. The only change I made was adding a teaspoon of vanilla per one batch. It just gives extra flavor. I am definitely making this again.  Such an amazing recipe

This was really good. My taste testers would give it a 5 but I’m keeping it at 4 just because I don’t actually like peanuts. Basically it’s just sugar glass with peanuts and the baking soda to puff it up so super easy.

Easy to make and excellent! I made a double batch with peanuts then another double batch with pecans! I added the teaspoon each of butter and vanilla and also lightly covered the foil with butter. Hardened up nice and quickly.

I am not that great of a cook, but I made this and it was very good.  I cooked it until it reached 300 degrees and then added the peanuts, stirred, baking soda, poured on foil.  It wasn't as hard to make as it sounded.  I ended up making a 2nd batch because it was so good and I needed more to share.

This recipe was so easy to do especially for a first time making peanut brittle. I used dry roasted peanuts instead and add some toffee pieces in. So delicious!

Overall this recipe was very good. We doubled the liquid portion of the recipe and kept the peanut amount the same. Just personal preference.

I made this for the first time.

And it turned out amazing! All I did was a test batch and left out the peanuts. I also added in a half-teaspoon of vanilla and it tasted amazing for the test batch I made.

Tomorrow, when I get off work; I'm getting more corn syrup!

I decided to try a new recipe this year and since this one was so highly rated, I went with it.  This recipe is heavy on the baking soda which totally overpowered the flavor.  It looked and felt just right.  It was just a flavor thing.

This is a really good brittle and really easy! My first batch turned out chewy cause I didn't cook it long enough after adding the peanuts so second batch was wonderful! I ended up cooking the syrup and sugar for about 20 mins and then bout 15 mins after adding the peanuts. I used dry roasted lightly salted peanuts and turned out great and I also added 1 tsp of butter and vanilla! :) im happy with it! :)

This is the easiest recipe for peanut brittle I've ever tried.  I even substituted the peanuts for walnuts in a batch.  Plan to use this recipe from now on.

I didn't find it messy either, the hardened brittle slides right off my non stick pan...

I was kind of scared of the concept of making candy but this was easy! I was very glad for my candy thermometer to know when to put the nuts in and although it was a sticky clean up it was worth it.

Very easy - I gave up on the candy thermometer (technical difficulties) and went by the ball test and it turned out great. I used honey-roasted peanuts.  Can't really taste the honey but that's okay.

This makes a pretty brittle, but relatively flavorless. I have another recipe where you cook the peanuts in the sugar first and this gives a much richer fuller flavor to the brittle. I thought I'd try this one to see if it would speed the process up. There was little time difference, but the taste difference was huge. If you are looking for a bold peanut brittle, this is not the one.

I made this yesterday for a family member and they said it was the best brittle they've ever had! This recipe was super easy and delicious! :). Only advice is to be quick when you're done heating it to the accurate temperature because it hardens SUPER quick!

Great brittle and very easy!  I doubled the recipe and sustituted chopped macadamia nuts instead of the peanuts. Terrific! My candy thermometer was broken so I used the "hair method" described in this recipe and it worked just great! Will definitely make again, especially for the holiday gift giving! Thanks!

AWESOME flavor!  It was my first time making candy and it came out great BUT what I didn't really think about was that living here in New Orleans where it is always humid *despite it being December) the candy wouldn't 'set' so I put it in the freezer for a bit and it hardened right up!!  Everyone loves it!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Nice brittle recipe. I did heat it a little too hot, so a bit sticky, will use this recipe again.

This is a perfect brittle recipe.  I made 3 batches in under an hour.  For some kick I added 1/2 tablespoon of chili flakes to one of the batches....delicious.
