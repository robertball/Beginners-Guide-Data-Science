THESE ARE SO SOFT!! I let them cool as directed (5min on the sheet then to wire rack) I only let them sit on the wire rack about 2 - 3 minutes and then I bagged them.  I also dipped them in red and green sugar, just for holiday flare - THEY ARE TASTY TASTY TASTY!!

THESE ARE GOOD!  Don't believe any bad reviews on these cookies (they must have done something wrong)!  I used 1 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. ground cloves and rolled the balls in sugar before baking.  Baked for 11 minutes.  EXCELLENT soft molasses cookies!!

Really delicious and simple.  They've stayed nice & soft. I used my Pampered Chef small melonball tool and had these done in no time.  Made the perfect amount.

These were wonderful little cookies! I added a bit more spices as previous posters suggested and loved the flavour. 

I rolled the dough into the balls as suggested and rolled them in granulated sugar. Flattened the balls with 3 fingers on a parchment lined cookie sheet.

They turned out AMAZING and were gobbled up by everyone at the event I took them to! They will totally be made again (and again and again!)

Good recipe. Really easy to make, and 
the dough was excellent for rolling balls. I think I might add more ginger
next time, as I like a spicier cookie.

Oh, and I added nutmeg to the cookie dough.

Cookies were pretty good.  I think they could of stood more spices.  They were very soft...just how I like them.  Dough needs to be refridgerated for MORE THAN an hour.

These are the best molasses cookies ever!  Definitely a family favorite.  Very easy to make --  I did squish them down a little on the cookie sheet before cookie and sprinkled liberally with sugar.  Awesome recipe!

These cookies were so soft and moist!  They were the perfect cookie for the holidays.  Be sure not to over bake them if you want them soft.  I rolled the dough balls in white sugar before I baked them which added a little bit more sweetness to them.  They are wonderful!

Well, I will jump on the Bandwagon too and say YUMMY. I followed the directions to the T, with the exception of adding 1/4 t. of ground cloves. So nice and soft and delicious!!! This is a keeper!!!

These are now my favorite cookies.  Everyone I shared them with loved them and said they were one of the best cookies that they have ever tasted and much better than store bought cookies.  Because my spice rack was getting a little empty, I did add a bit more cinnamon and some allspice to compensate for the wee bit of ginger I had.  I also added one shake of black pepper and one drop of anise extract just to be crazy.  I made some that were bigger - I took a ball of dough the size of a big walnut, flattened it so it was about 1/2 inch think and 2 inches round, dipped one side of it into white sugar and then then baked it. These turned out about the size of store bought cookies.  I also made some smaller ones.  I took dough about the size of my thumb tip, rolled it into a ball, rolled the entire ball in sugar and then baked them.  These turn out about the size of store bought gingersnaps.  These cookies are perfect for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  And, I imagine Hannakah and Kwanza, too.  I just made these yesterday and I already have to make another batch because they are already gone.  So, they are a good "everyday" cookie as well.  Enjoy!

I made these per the recipe and they were excellent!  (and I don't usually like molasses cookies). Very soft and tasty.  Rolled in balls and then in sugar and made exactly 36 cookies.  YUM!

Easy to make, easy to roll,and turned out soft. But the smell of the molasses and/or batter reminded me of ipecac.  These cookies were also bland and not sweet.  I made these to add to treat bags, and I don't like them enough to give to others.  If I don't want to eat these why should I pawn them off to others?

I used fresh shaved ginger instead of ground (didnt have any on hand). The cookies were super moist! (in a good way) and very tangy. I'm a big fan. Will make them again!

I wanted a soft cookie and this was it.  I did add more spices and a pinch of salt (hence the four stars instead of five) but otherwise followed the recipe.  Rolling the balls in sugar was a great idea (from another reviewer).  There is no need to press the balls down as someone did; they will flatten properly on their own.  I baked for 11 minutes and they were perfect.

I took the suggestions of others and decreased the baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp, increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp of cloves. They were incredible! Unbelievably soft, moist, and chewy.

My family thinks adding  the followng makes it a 5 STAR recipe (I tried the original recipe the first time and would give it 4 stars)... add a half cup  of coarsely chopped crystallized ginger (also called ginger slices--it's the bagged sugared ginger you can find on the baking or produce aisle).  Also double the ground ginger and cinnamon  like others suggested.

These were DELICIOUS!  I added about 3 tbsp more molasses, rolled them in sugar, made them a little smaller and pressed them down a little before baking to make sure they cooked all the way through.  DELISH.  MAKE THESE, and you will be happy.

Oh sal, why oh why did you have to submit this recipe? I made 2 batches in 3 days and my husband and I ate them all. Every. Single. One.

These cook up beautifully and turn out nice and soft but not too soft. I added a little cardamom just because it tasted wonderful in recipes like this and rolled them in white sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet. I used parchment paper to line my sheet with ~ no fuss, no muss, no mess! Thank you for a wonderful cookie :)

Made exactly as directed, except for substituting sucanat for the brown sugar and using part whole wheat flour.  Oh, and I also rolled the balls of dough in granulated sugar before baking. Absolutely delicious!

These cookies are wonderful! I just made them as part of my christmas cookies and they are very popular!  I baked them with colored sugar to make them look festive, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  These will not stay soft if you put in the fridge.

these cookies were great! i doubled the sugar (just for kicks) annnnd added a twist if any of you  wanna try :)
place a can (unopened) of sweetened condensed milk (any size can) in a large pot of boiling water.
leave it there for 3 hours (let the water continuously boil) make sure to check on the pot and add water to keep the can covered if some from the pot has evaporated.  once three hours are up take out the can and let cool for apprx 1 hour.  open it up! mmm sticky toffee! I put a thick layer between two molasses cookies for a super rich, thick, and mm mm good sandwich cookie treat!

Of all the molasses cookie recipes I have tried (and I have tried MANY), this is by far the BEST!  It makes alot of cookies.  So I freeze half and thaw out to make later.  They come out just as good.  I am popping in the frozen half tonight. :)

The only thing I would say keeps these from being a five star is the mild ginger taste. It's subtle if you're looking for a punch of ginger.   That said these rock! I completely blew off the chilling of the dough, used two tablespoons to make tablespoon sized "balls," then ran water over the back of a teaspoon, gave them a donk and sprinkled raw sugar over the tops. To test fate I jammed 20 on a baking sheet at a time to speed up the process. I also threw a big bag of white chocolate chips in the batter after the flour was incorporated.  Will use less of the chips next time, a bit more spice (maybe an apple pie blend or a bit of clove).   Easy, easy and a nice addition to my Christmas baking.

I only made 2 changes to the recipe as written: Added more spices, and added a but of rum for more flavor. I read through the reviews and have to say... if you follow the directions and don't over cook the cookies (I made that mistake with one sheet...) this comes out great! I made this recipe twice so far, the first time so much of the dough went into my children's mouths that there weren't enough cookies! Both times came out wonderful. However, I used dark molasses the first batch and mild molasses the second. I happen to prefer the dark molasses version. I did change the cookie forming method however. Instead of cooling the whole batch of dough, I put it into a ziplock bag, cut the end off and "piped" the cookies onto the sheet. I then froze them for a few minutes to help keep their form, and baked them. (Much quicker then waiting for the whole bowl to cool) I also sprinkled a few with regular sugar and it added a wonderful touch. These are more of a cake like cookie, but not too much so. Cake like cookies tend to stay soft for longer though which is good for my purpose. I sent them to my deployed husband and his room mates and am awaiting the response on how they arrived!

I've been looking for a really good Molasses cookie recipe since Grandma's quit making them - 7 years. This is not a perfect match, but with a little tweaking it was. Increased molasses to a full cup and added an extra 1/2 C flour so it wasn't too runny, iced with a simple powdered sugar glaze. Perfect! Awesome! Thanks!! They were so good that a double batch didn't make it through the night-my kids inhaled them!

Great cookies!!
I like to use parchment paper when making any cookie, but especially with these cookies so they don't over cook

These are SO good.  I took the advice of others and rolled them in sugar before baking and they came out really soft on the inside with a delicious crispiness on the outside.  They go perfectly with a nice hot cup of coffee.  To the person who was put off by the smell, one of your ingredients must have been off or something, because there was nothing weird about these cookies.

Excellent cookies! I made these with a touch less molasses and an extra egg, and a little more ginger and cinnamon. They made great gingerbread men cutouts and dough was easy to roll. They taste much better a day after baking, the baking soda flavor has to take time to mellow. Good for icing because it's not too sweet a cookie.

SO delicious, easy, and pretty! After I formed the dough into balls I rolled 'em in sugar and then baked them. They turned out crunchy and sparkly outside and soft and moist inside. Mmmm...

this dough is very sticky and hard to make into balls. these cookies turned out to be more cake-like than i was expecting. the molasses flavor could have been stronger but they were nice and fluffy and very soft. if you want a subtle molasses flavor, these are the the cookies for you. this isn't a recipe i would make again but fun to try anyway.

As with most readers, I loved these! I followed the recipe just about exactly-- only adding a little extra baking soda cause I like my cookies to be less flat and more airy/cakey.   I would suggest refrigerating OVERNIGHT as it makes a huge difference in how they bake-- mine came out like happy little mounds of molasses goodness. :)  Lastly-- used the melonballer trick from another user and it was awesome. Such consistent sized cookies! Roll them in fun colored sugar FTW!

This is a very fluffy, light cookie. I made it according to recipe except I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon/ginger. (didn't have ginger). I made a tube in waxed paper, cooled for about 10 minutes and than unwrapped, cut with a butter knife. Shaped with wet fingers and they were ready to bake. So easy to make!

Describing a cookie as "soft" made me think "chewy", but these aren't chewy. Rather they're light and fluffy, and quite thick, like something midway between a cookie and cake. That makes them different from your average cookie, and that's a good thing. People will know as soon as they bite into one of these that they're not eating some generic cookie.  I used a full teaspoon of cinnamon rather than a half, but I still felt these could have used a little more spice. Maybe I'll add a little ground cloves next time. I also rolled the balls of dough in coarse sugar before baking. This adds a nice bit of crunch to the surface.  I'm a big fan of the taste of molasses, so I'm sure I'll be making these (with my small adjustments) often in the future.

this would have been a 5 if it had mentioned to roll in sugar and flatten before baking, my husband loved them, his grandmother used to make them for him and he said they taste the same...i did sub nutmeg for ginger though...1/2 tsp instead of 1, and doubled the cinnamon. Raisens were also a good addition. Yummy cookies.

This is a great recipe! My family and the people at hubby's work just loved these cookies. I did change the ground cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, added a half teaspoon of cloves, and rolled them in sugar as others  have suggested. Don't be scared off by the stickiness of the dough, it is still workable and very much worth the effort.

Very good cookie.  Add extra cinnamon to the mix.  Make sure to blend the dough very well to incorporate all the butter or the cookies will lose their shape in the oven.  Roll in sugar before baking and drizzle with melted chocolate after they are cooled for an extra special touch.

These were super soft and had good taste.  I did not refriferat the dough at all and still had an easy time rolling it into balls.  I am used to a bigger cookie though, so next time I will make them a good golf ball size.
I added raisins and a touch of ground cloves for extra flavor and texture.
Thanks for the recipe!

I was excited to try my hand at molasses cookies and after reading a lot of the reviews I gave this a shot. I followed the recipe but added 1/4 tsp of cloves and rolled them in sugar before I put them on the sheet. The smell when I finishes the dough was gross. My kids didn't even want to eat the batter. They cooked up beautifully and I thought they might yet be good. They weren't. Maybe it is the brand of molasses?  I used Brer Rabbit. I will try molasses cookies again but not this recipe.

Almost perfect.  I'd bump up the molasses to at least a cup, if not just over.  Mine also didn't spread a whole lot, so if you want a cookie that isn't a ball smush it flat when you put them on the tray..  Added a bit more ginger, maybe 3/4 tsp and about 1/3 white sugar.  
And you can't forget to roll the dough balls in sugar before baking!

I've made this several times since downloading the recipe. We really like it. The smell as it bakes is wonderful too! I've made it as is, and also used half butter and half butter flavored shortening. I've also played with the amount of spices. It's great as is, but also has wonderful possiblities. My kids love these with a big mug of spicy hot cocoa- and they are amazing dipped in homemade whipped cream. So glad I found these. Must try!

My husband loved these cookies. They were super soft and he even said this recipe was better than his mothers! After making them into walnut size balls I rolled them in sugar which added a nice touch.

These are the best molasses cookies that I have ever tried. They come out nice and soft and are very delicious. This is now added to our yearly Christmas cookie arsenal, and is easy enough to make at any other time of the year.

I would give these five stars while my husband and some of my friends give it 4. I think these were great though. I've had a major craving for some soft molasses cookies, and I finally decided to find a recipe and make some, and I was not disappointed. They were soft and scrumptious. I refrigerated them for a few hours while I was gone and I came home and they were all ready to be baked. It was nice. I rolled them in sugar also. They are the perfect little cookie.

I love how soft these cookies are!!!!  I agree that this recipe lacks taste.  I will certainly make again, but add more spices as other suggested.  Then it would be a five star cookie. VERY SOFT! PERFECTO on consistency!

These are really good! I must admit I omitted the ginger and added a little clove and nutmeg and sugared the top. I also believe I would add a little more molasses next time I make them. But I like a strong molasses flavor. It's the perfect recipe to follow and tweak to your own desires!

Great recipe!  If you crave a crispy, more dunkable cookie, let the cool and bake again at 200 degrees for about 10 minutes.

After baking these, the baking soda seemed to overpower the taste of spices and molasses. Add a bit more of the spices to the mixture and cut the baking soda down to 1 1/2 teaspoons. 
I also rolled these into balls, flattened them until they were about 1/4 of an inch thick and covered them in coarse sugar.
I could not find molasses syrup anywhere today. Living in England, there are certain things you need to learn to substitute...I substituted the syrup for molasses sugar instead. Be sure to add about a 1/4 cup of water to the mixture, or the dough/cookies will turn out very dry. 
The oven temperature conversion says that they should bake at 175C. DO NOT bake at this temperature. Put it somewhere between 150 & 160, for 5-6 minutes. Any longer and they go too crunchy/burn. 
All in all, these are a soft cookie with a bit of a crunch to them.

This is an excellent cookie that even less experienced cooks can have success with.  I like spices, so I doubled the spices in the recipe and added cloves.  I rolled the cookie in sugar before baking, too.  The cookies turned out soft and tasty, but not overly sweet.  You could eat a lot of them without feeling guilty!

Good cookie, but too sweet if you are planning to
use frosting.  Dried cranberries make a nice addition
to the dough.

This recipe was quick and easy to make!  And when I've found I've run out of time to finish the batch, I cover the rest of the uncooked batter and toss it back in the fridge to bake up the next day!

I have made these more than a dozen times and they are always a hit.  They practically disappear as I am putting them out, and when I do have some left over after making a double batch they stay soft for days until they are gone.  Sometimes I even put icing on them but to be honest they don't need it.  Perfect as is and the only reason I haven't made them in several years is that they are too good - my fiance and I eat too many and after my mom had her heart attack I didn't want to make them and then refuse to give her any.  She loves them, especially.

The only fault I can find with this recipe is not enough spice. I like them very spicy, so I'll double the spices next time and add some ground cloves. The texture is perfect! I rolled them in a mixture of maple and white sugar and pressed them down with a fork. The maple added another subtle layer of flavor. This is definitely one for the recipe box.

I was disappointed when I first took a bite of this cookies because I was looking for a chewy kind (my mistake).  Anyways, for a soft cookie, this is great and I think it tastes better the next day.  My mother in law loved it and I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

We LOVED these cookies! The only thing I did differently was, I did add more spices, quite a bit more, because we like our molasses cookies with a bite.  I add at least twice the amount of cinnamon, and doubled the ginger, and also added a teaspoon of cloves.  Very soft, spicy, and yummy!

These are THE BEST cookies we've ever made!  The perfect combination of crisp outside and moist and fluffy and soft inside. We were out (I know, right?!) of cinnamon so we substituted allspice and they were amazing.  Next time we made them, we added raisins and cinnamon chips.  Not necessary, but equally delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

Simply the very best soft molasses cookies. They are perfect, soft,chewy, moist and pretty when they are rolled in sugar before baking.They also stay moist for several days if kept in a closed jar, that's if they last that long!Excellent

Perfect! I used white wheat flour and they turned out great! they did resemble puffs more than a cookie, I think I needed less/no refrigeration with the wheat flour. My 19 month old and 3 year old wouldn't stop eating them!

These ARE super soft and tasty - they taste like gingerbread, but have a smoother texture. However, the dough was incredibly hard to work with, even after being refrdigerated. It was too sticky!

These are by far the best soft molasses cookies I have ever tasted. I even replaced half the butter with Smart Balance and they were still fantastic.  I had to add a little extra flour (maybe 1/4 cup) and baked them the full 10 minutes.  Totally satisfying in every way!

I loved these cookies. I followed some of the reviews and used 1 1/2 tsp baking soda and doubled the spices. I dipped the tops in raw sugar for a crystally sweetness. They were beautiful and yummy

I followed the suggestion of others and added extra spices and ground cloves and then rolled in sugar before baking.  They turned out super tastey and looked great!

These were pretty good.  Fairly easy to make.  However, I needed to cook for about 11 minutes and they are not crispy on the outside.  If you like a soft, more ball-shaped cookie, these are great.  I though molasses cookies would flatten more.  I rolled in red and green sugar prior to baking as another reviewer described for a more festive look.  Good molasses flavor.

This is the molasses cookie I have been looking for.  It is not cake like at all.  The key is to chill it for at least an hour like the recipe calls for.  Happy Baking!!

These cookies were good, but I felt the need to spice up the dough a bit...I added some ground ginger and cinamon and rolled the balls in coarse sugar before baking them...The sugar gave them some crunch while the cookie itself stayed pretty chewy.

Molasses cookies have always been one of my favorite parts about Christmas. They're not that hard to make, and it took me about an hour from pulling out the bowls to sliding the last of the cookies off onto the cooling rack. One recommendation I would make is to roll them in sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet for an extra bit of sweetness!

They tasted good but I only gave it 3 stars due to the fact that mine cooked in 7 minutes NOT 8-10... I would suggest maybe baking at 325-340 F instead of 350 to prevent burning...

Fantastic! Soft, moist cookies and I recommend rolling the dough balls in baker's sugar before baking.  Adds a nice sweetness that isn't overwhelming. Great recipe! Highly recommend.

These cookies are GREAT!! They stay sooo soft and the whole family loved them. The only things I altered were the brown sugar and cinnamon. I used 3/4 c. brown sugar and 1tsp. of cinnamon.

This is my first time making these cookies. Super simple to make! I always have trouble getting a cookie to stay soft, but not these! I was out of ginger so used extra cinnamon & allspice to make the difference, plus I added some fresh grated nutmeg and tiny bit of grated lemon rind, just because it was there in front of me. Oh and I was short on molassas by a quarter cup, so made up the difference with brown sugar and about 3 TBLSP of water I put in the molassas jar to get all I could. Then I rolled them in cinnamon/sugar. Not only are the cookies still soft(yeah!), they are big and super tasty. I am very confident they are even better with the correct ingredients. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It will be my go to ginger/molassas cookie in the future.

Dang. These were so hard to enjoy, however I do not think it is because of the recipe, I think that I used an incorrect type of molasses (cooking molasses), perhaps I used a type that was a little stronger because mine had an insanely strong aroma and taste of molassses which was extremely unpleasant! I had to separately bake 3 batches as I only had 1 cookie sheet. The 3rd batch I topped with some sugar, which reduced about 40% of the molasses flavour however still distinctable. And yes, i did follow the recipe, everything down to the teaspoon. Very upset my cookies turned out bad =(

This was a nightmare recipe... even when I added the amount of flour it called for the batter was sticky and too wet and after adding an additional cup of flower and chilling, I baked them and they spread out bad and even after cooking for 12-14 minutes they were wet inside and wanted to fall apart.  From now on I think I am going to stick to the recipe on the back of the molasses jar!!

This is now my families new favorite molasses cookie recipe! They are wonderful the 1st day served warm, but they have even more flavor the next day. They reminded me of the packaged Granma's molasses cookies. I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of coconut oil. I doubled the cinnamon and ginger and added 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves. I, also, used all wheat flour (I used 2 3/4 cups) instead of the white flour. I had so many people ask for the recipe!

These were super easy and turned out perfect.  The only thing I did differently was to roll each ball of dough in organic sugar before baking.  Gave them a nice texture and a little crunch.  Really delicious!!

I had a craving for these cookies, and this recipe fixed me up!  They made the house smell wonderful.  I also added a pinch of allspice to the recipe, which added a nice flavour I think.  Unfortunately, these cookies came out really flat, maybe I should have refrigerated the dough longer before baking.  The fact that the cookies are flat doesn't bother us though, the flavour is great!

I won't make them again even with the changes I made this time. They need more spice, more flour or something. I had to put the cookies together with orange frosting.

So Yummy! Just like the ones my Nana used to make. These cookies are good any time of the year. I did roll my cookies in sugar before cooking and then sprinkled sugar on top after cooking for 12 minutes. If you are looking for a good molasses cookie recipe this one is it and very simple.

Outstanding.

I added a touch allspice, too.  I also rolled them a bit in powdered sugar before baking.  

The flavor was amazing.  I will use this recipe again.

This recipe won raves from my family and friends.  They were made 4 days ago and have kept their moistness in a container. We have never tasted cookies as delicous as these are and they make up very easily.
Thankyou very much, Sara and especially for giving me a wonderful aroma in my kitchen!

Way Yummy! These tasted just like the one's you can buy at the store. I followed the recipe exactly, baked them like the recipe stated, and then after they had cooled slightly, I put a glaze on top! My kids loved them!

If you like soft molasses cookies, these are great.  Make sure you roll them in sugar before putting them on the baking sheet!  Great recipe.

I had trouble with these cookies getting flat.  I still served them to my family who liked them and called them "molasses waifers".  This was just not the cookie I was hoping for.

These cookies are very good - nice and soft.  I did some adjustments - increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp., and added 1/4 tsp. ground cloves.  I also dipped the balls into sugar before baking.

These cookies have a very strong molasses taste -- too strong in my opinion.  I also had trouble with the cookies holding their shape when they baked.

These were awesome fresh out of the oven, but the true test of a good cookie is how it tastes cold.  They were a little disappointing.  They had kind of a dry, yet chewy texture.  Didn't know you could achieve that combination.  I rolled mine in sugar and think they would have been worse if I hadn't.  I'd say they were WAY average.

these cookies are the best cookies I've ever tasted since my mom made them when I was a little kid.  My daughter loves them also and we almost could not stop eating them--- they are very easy to prepare and the house smells like Christmas when they are baking in the oven.

Very tasty, soft cookies.  Wonderful with a glass of milk or cocoa, tea or coffee.  The aroma is enticing and the cookies are equally enticing to the palate.  My kids (2 and 6) loved them.  I rolled the dough balls in sugar for a little bit of presentation and loved the flavour.  Will definitely make again and again.

I made the recipe exactly as directed, and I don't think they taste like much.  (I find it interesting that someone remarked that they don't believe any bad reviews of this recipe and then went on to describe all the changes they made!  HA HA HA.)  I would agree with putting in extra spices like a full teaspoon of cinnamon and some cloves.  I also wish I had read about rolling them in sugar before baking.  The recipe AS IS with no changes has great consistency but not enough flavor, in my opinion.

I made this cookie exactly as the recipe called for,  except added cloves. I also accidentally used cooking molasses rather than fancy molasses.  While they turned out great,  they were a little strong on the molasses taste.  They go excellent with black dark roasted coffee though!

I love this recipe, there are so many options.  You can add more or less depending on your preference.  You can add things, like raisins or dried fruit into the batter.  You can bake the cookies after chilling the dough and then freeze them IF there are any left or you make the dough and freeze it and then bake a few cookies at a time.  The cookies come out soft and flavourful however you make them.

I followed the recipe exactly except (I know, I know) for rolling each cookie in sugar before baking.

The texture and flavor were absolutely perfect. 10/10 would eat again.

Make sure to put the batter back into the fridge between batches to it remains cold!

I made two batches with this recipe. First batch was with 1/2 butter and 1/2 margerine. The second batch i used margerine only, and the cookies held a nice round form. The first batch with butter baked with a runny edge around them.

So these were okay, not the best molasses cookies I've made. I will be trying other recipes. I felt like they were a little more breadish than I like. I am more of a chewy molasses type of person. Also it was not very sweet. They were not "awful"by no means just not "awesome".

This recipe was superb! Delicious cookies! HOWEVER, due to MY ineptitude, I am taking it out of my recipe book! I had a horrible time rolling the cookie dough into balls. Wet my hands...nope. Floured my hands....nope. Sugared my hands....nope. Finally used two spoons. The cookies were great, but I couldn't make it work. My fault, I am sure....

This recipe is nothing compared to my usual molasses crinkle cookie recipe. These have way too much flour in them and for me this resulted in cookie mounds instead of a flattened cookie. Yes, some reviewers suggested pushing them down with a thumb over parchment paper but it should have been in the recipe! Also, the fact that everyone is commenting to add more spice means the recipe does not call for enough spice on its own so it is not a 5 star recipe. Sorry, but I have to give an honest review and this one is not a do-again.

The dough is really nice to work with. I use a cookie scoop and I got 41 cookies out of it. They are really puffy and soft. First batch I did for 12 minutes and they arent quite cooked in the middle for my liking. So next batch is going for about 18. I was generous with the spices and it's so delicious. Not too sweet, spices arent so strong that they overpower the molasses flavor. ***NOTE*** 15 minutes was perfect for me. My god these are amazing. Stuck some half walnuts in a few too.

Wonderful recipe, this will be a go to for molasses cookies.
I made them as recipe stated, next time I will increase the amount of ginger just because we like ginger flavor l will start by increasing with a 1/4 teas .
Enjoy, we certainly did.

I've been looking for just this recipe!  I made mine a bit bigger than a walnut shell.  This is a nice soft baked Adult (not too sweet) cookie.  I think it is important that you like the molasses you are using, take a taste from the bottle first.  I used Plantation unsulphured Black Strap.

I think I've found my grandmother's recipe with a few additions. My sisters loved them!   I increased molasses by 1/3 cup. Be sure to set butter out to soften and I did use real butter.  I increased ginger by just a little and also added a little salt and nutmeg. Refrigerate.  Don't use silpat.  Definitely let cool before and after frosting with powdered sugar, salt and little can milk mixture.  We loved my grandmother's molasses cookies and this was how I remember them.  Maybe next time I make them I'll give it five stars.  Just want to be sure.

I have been making these cookies for years and they are always a crowd pleaser. I roll the individual dough balls in turbinado sugar (sugar in the raw) before baking and it adds a wonderful sweet crunch to the outside while the inside is soft.

I've been making these cookies (to rave reviews) for a few years but right from the start, I doubled the spices used in the recipe and I rolled it in a combination of sugar, cinnamon, and ginger (depending, I might also throw in ground cloves, etc.) which I think benefited the cookies by providing a punch of flavour to counteract the sweetness of the molasses.

Best recipe I've used for Molasses Cookies.  Am making it my go to recipe.  Spicy and delicious.  I used parchment paper to make on so there was very little mess when I was finished.

These have a very soft, silky, cake-like texture, and stay moist for days! They make nice small, round, domed cookies that don't spread much. The spices are well balanced. I agree that they would benefit from a bit of a sweet punch from either rolling in sugar before baking, or a bit of a glaze afterwards. Definitely easy to put together, and definitely a keeper.

Perfect.  Almost a tiny bit crusty on the outside, and soft inside.  I used 1 tsp cinnamon, and I don't use butter, so subbed my regular soft-tub margarine (NOT the reduced-fat kind!).  I made the batter yesterday but didn't have time to finish so refrigerated it until this afternoon and even with that, and my margarine, they were still perfect.  Baked on convection bake at 335F for 16 minutes.   I rolled them in a mix of regular white sugar and coarse green sugar before baking - makes a nice sparkly Christmas presentation.   Thanks, Sal, for this delicious, easy, and forgiving recipe.  It'll definitely be a go-to cookie year round.
