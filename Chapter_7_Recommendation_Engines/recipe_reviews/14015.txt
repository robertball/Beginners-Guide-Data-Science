When baking the potatoes for these, also roast some garlic (whole cloves) w/ olive oil.  Smash several cloves of the garlic up and mix it with sour cream to serve with the skins.  Yummy!

I liked this recipe because you don't deep fry them...
I cooked my potatoes in the microwave for about 10 minutes rather than oven baking them.  Also used an Olive Oil spritzer to oil up my spuds.  After cooking them at 400 until they were crispy, I filled them w/ bacon bits & cheese & broiled until the cheese melted.

This is a wonderful blend of spices.  As others have mentioned, brushing on the oil works well.  Just sprinkle on enough spices to lightly coat the potato.  If you use the regular ten pound bagged potatoes instead of the big baking potatoes you may put on too much spice.  That's what happened to me.  Next time I'll know to use less spices sprinkled on top and to only cut the potatoes in half.  It is a good recipe and great flavor.

I made these for New Year's Eve.  Then 3 days later had some from Bennegan's.  These are MUCH better.  Thank you!  I added shredded cheese and crumbled crispy bacon.  Also added green onion and served w/ ranch dressing to dip in.

Made these last night with an Italian flare.  Cooked them first in the microwave, scooped out 3/4 of potatoes (saved that to make potato crochets), coated them with olive oil and sprinked them with grated cheese, oregano, salt and pepper.  Baked them in a 400 degrees oven for 15 to 18 minutes and put the broiler on for the last couple of minutes.  Yummy!

these were great! they reminded me a lot of one of my favourite indian appetizers - fried vegetable pakoras. i used the skin from two left over baked potatoes and used 1/2 tsp of each seasoning. i will definitely cut down on the oil content next time, and will try to brush it on instead of dipping.

This is an easy, yet amazingly tasty recipe. I made these potatoes several times, and was praised for them every single time. I also experimented with the recipe several times, once adding some cheddar cheese, and another time substituting cajun seasoning for the spices given in the recipe. Very versatile, and a definite keeper.

Loved them, my company thought I spend 
hours in the kitchen.  They were eaten in
heatbeat.  I should have doubled the recipe.
Thanks for sharing such a low fat, easy
and delicious food.

These are absolutely delicious!  Like another reviewer, I brushed the skins with the olive oil.  They're great paired with chili!

Very good basic recipe. I sprayed skins instead of dipping in oil. I also cooked at 450 until crispy and then topped with shredded cheeses, cooked bacon and broiled until bubbly. I topped with scallions when I took them out of the oven. The whole family inhaled them. I'll be making them again. LOVE that they were not fried!!

I cut this recipe by half but I made no changes to the actual recipe. These turned out SO good--we loved these! I served these with bbqgirl's Jalapeno Ranch Salad Dressing (which was a great pairing, by the way) and really just inhaled them. NO leftovers.

THESE WERE DELICIOUS! I tweeked the recipe by a few things... First I used 8 medium red potatoes instead of russet (health reasons), they were a little harder to manage because of the size but were still FANTASTIC. Also, I too sprinkled a LITTLE bit of cheddar on the tops after pulling them out of the oven. I too brushed the oil on instead of dipping the potatoes... I ended up using only half of what the recipe calls for :) My whole family wants these potatoes again!

Tasty treat.  Next time I will leave more potato on the skin.  I used the seasoning sparingly and left the skin a little bland.  Will use more next time.

These potato skins were terrific.  I took suggestions of other reviewers and brushed them with olive oil, rather than dipping them.  Also, I added a little cheddar cheese and some crumbled bacon before baking them the 2nd time. I will be making these again and again!

This version is good.. I have also tried yukon gold potatoes on my pizza brick ( yes you read correctly..pizza brick-cook alot of different stuff on it ). Yukon golds are more tender and flavorful then russets. I cut and place them on brick with nothing on them for 15 at 325, then I spray them down with an olive oil spray add salt and seasoning, pop them back in for another 15 minutes and if they arent puffy with yummy brown spots, they go back in til' they do. These are soo delicious, my husband perfers these over any other potato. hope this helped, and if you dont have a pizza brick just use a foil lined baking sheet. :)  Enjoy

These were really, really good. I made some changes, after they were cooked I turned them over and sprinkled a little Cheddar Cheese and then broiled them. There are only 3 of us(2 are men) and I used 3 potatoes and they were gone in a  flash. Thank you-yummmmmmmmmmmmmm

Very good and not fried, so hopefully that was some savings in fat and calories. Of course, I did put cheese and bacon bits (instead of the spices).... Anyway, I would definitely make again.

These came out great! I didn't use any coriander, but what I did do was mix some shredded cheddar cheese with the other spices called for, and I sprinkled this over the potatoes to bake for those last 15 minutes. Served with sour cream on top. Yum! Thanks.

These are delicious. I love the blend of spices. Very crispy and satisfying without all of the fat of deep frying. I used a lot less olive oil than called for and they still came out great.

Great! I might try different potatoes next time, or maybe baking them for less time as they fell apart and didn't make nicely shaped skins.  However, they had great flavor.  I served these with 'Slow Cooker Texas Pulled Pork' for Superbowl - and dinner was a super hit!

This was pretty good! I had mine plain and dipped in a bit of homeade salsa, and for my brothers i loaded them up with cheese and bacon and sour cream.  Really easy to make as well.

I had potato skins left over from making baked potato soup and used them for this recipe.  The spice blend was very tasty and a pleasant change from the usual potato skins.  I sprinkled on what appeared to be a reasonable amount and had LOTS left over.  The skins were nice and crunchy.  I would definitely use this recipe again to use up potato skins.

The texture and flavor was great! Next time I will sprinkle cheese on top (since it's baked, I don't think I'll feel guilty about doing that).

These were ok, but honestly I was hoping for more flavor, as we felt they were quite bland.

These were very good. I added some chives & soy bacon on top.
