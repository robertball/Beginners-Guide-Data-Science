These cookies are definitely not sweet--and that's not a bad thing in my opinion, as I do not like overly sweet anything. With that said, I felt that these could almost be bland. Their saving grace was the addition of raisins and walnuts that give you a little pop of flavor when you bite into them. If I were to make these again, I think they could really benefit from the addition of a little fat--1-2 tbsps of butter or oil would do the trick. Also, a bit more spices, maple syrup in place of honey, and maybe even some shredded coconut would add a bit more flavor. These cookies also stay EXACTLY how they go into the oven--no spreading at all. After the first batch, I pressed them flat before baking, and much prefer them that way. Overall, not bad, but I would adjust more to suit my family's tastes. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great core recipe! I didnâ€™t have honey and prefer a sweeter cookie so I added 3/4 cup brown sugar, and also increased the salt to 1 tsp. I needed a nut-free version so I added mini chocolate chips instead. I baked them for 10 minutes and they still set nicely but stayed chewy. Will be making again!

Delightful! Just what I was looking for!
Was looking for a recipe using bananas and applesauce, something other than banana nut bread. This is it! 
Will be great for breakfast with yogurt & tea, or an afternoon snack =)
I used 1/3c of frozen blueberries instead of raisins, and I had 3 ripe bananas that needed to be used.
