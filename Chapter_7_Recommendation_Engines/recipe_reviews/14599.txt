this was a great starting point for making cube steak stew. my husband absolutely hates chicken fried steak and i was looking for a nice way to fix cube steaks.  i sauteed onions, sliced portobello mushrooms, garlic, and sliced baby carrots in some butter and olive oil. i coated the cut up cube steak in whole wheat flour and sauteed until browned. i added some chicken stock, half and half and recommended seasonings. cooked until nice and thick.
i would like to add the browning sauce just for some nice color but not necessary.  we arent a fan of canned vegetables, but this recipe is definitely a keeper with some modifications. thanks for sharing!

This was easy, good and comforting, not to mention inexpensive. I used fresh potatoes and frozen peas and carrots, added about 1/2 c. of tomato paste, a little balsamic vinegar, some fresh minced garlic (which I added with the beef and onions) and a little cayenne. I also increased the liquid, about 2 c. of broth and 2 c. of water. Thank you Joyce!

I don't know if the browning sauce is the key ingredient to stew or what, but this is the first time I've made stew and had it turn out really well! I used fresh carrots and potatoes (left out the peas), garlic powder and had to add another cup of water right at the beginning. I used less salt and more bouillon cubes. We ate this over rice tonight and are looking forward to the leftovers, this made enough to feed at least 6! This recipe is a keeper :o)

My husband LOVED this stew. SO easy to make. I omitted the potatos and added mushrooms and doubled the amount of carrots and peas. I also melted a slice of swiss cheese on the top of each individual bowl. It was fabulous, he requested it again already!!

I added diced fresh carrots, and nearly tripled the water.
It was still thick and delicious.  the recipe mentions carrots in the text, but
not in the ingredient list.  It was tasty, easy, and my kids ate the vegetables.

So delicious! I used fresh and frozen veggies because I didn't have any canned~ I boiled them in vegetable broth until tender and then threw them in the skillet with the steak. I served it over barley along side kale. We ate every last drop. Dipping bread is a must! Tossing the cubed steak in flour gives it a rich gravy that we can't resist.

This had WAY too much black pepper in it for our tastes. If I want to add that much kick I would choose to do it with something other than plain black pepper. All we could taste was the pepper and we wanted to try a stew.

I bought some cube steaks with the intention of making chicken fried steak but when it came time to cook I didn't feel like going to all that work. So, I hopped on to allrecipes looking for something else to do with them and came across this recipe. Very easy and I had everything. I hate canned veggies so I used frozen. This came together really well and we enjoyed it. I probably wouldn't make this again since we prefer stew meat for our stews but it was perfect for what I was looking for at the time.

Good recipe.  Made little variation by using 2-16 oz cans of vegetable soup in lieu of the vegetable listed in the recipe.  Served this with crusty bread and a salad for dinner.  Very quick and easy dinner to prepare on a busy day.

This was a great find. I had cubed venison steaks in the freezer and didn't want the same ole thing. I did make the following changes and it came out AMAZING - I added fresh-cubed butternut squash, 2 onions, canned peas, and mushrooms instead of the potatoes and carrots. I also used stock instead of bullion. It is rich, creamy and a definite keeper of a recipe as I am sure it is just as delicious with the veggies that the original calls for.

This was good (the hubby loved it).  I added fresh carrots and potatoes, frozen peas.  At the end, I added in a can of black olives.  Instead of the browning sauce, I used Worcestershire Sauce.

This recipe was even better the next day! Thank you Joyce for submitting this fast and easy cold weather comfort food. The only things I did different was I added a can of tomato paste to it. Also, I didn't have any browning sauce but it seemed to taste fine without it. I also didn't have any premade Italian seasoning on hand so I just added Italian-type seasonings to it. This recipe was so easy to tweak and still come out really good. Thanks again.

The flavor of this was okay if you could get past the look of it.  It looked like mush, not very appealing to the eyes.

Very simple and very good. Instead of browning sauce, I used a hearty red wine. Also used fresh potatoes, frozen peas and carrots, and vegan beef flavored bouillon. I didn't use any salt, since most bouillon has a fair amount of salt already in it. My friend devoured it in seconds.

This is very quick and easy. It's too peppery for us though so next time I make it I'll use just a 1/2 tsp. I like the idea from another reviewer to substitute Worcestershire. I'll try that once I figure out the pepper.

I substituted peas instead of peas and carrots. I really liked it. The sliced potatoes in the can tasted good, much to my surprise. I would make it again.

I would probably make this again.  It was an easy way to use an inexpensive cut of meat.  It didn't "look" too great, but it tasted fine.

Pretty decent stew recipe. I came across this while looking for something to do with some cube steak I had. I added two bouillon cubes with 2 cups of water instead of just one. Used red potatoes, yellow onion, creamed corn and green beans for the vegetables. Also, I did not have browning sauce so I took another reviewer's recommendation and used Worcestershire sauce instead. Would be super good with homemade bread and butter! Maybe I'll make some for tomorrow's leftovers.

This was so easy to make and very yummy! My boyfriend really enjoyed it and requested it on the definitely make again list. I paired it with rice but next time I'll probably do bread bowls. Only thing it changed was I did not add the onion, we aren't huge fans of onions so a just used a out a tsp of onion soup mix and it was still amazing!.

We loved this recipe. However, we don't eat white potatoes so I used a can of mushrooms instead. Also, I used about a half cup ketchup to the gravy and then cooked for 25 min. The flavor was SO delicious with this little change

We liked it very much, I used Worcestershire because I didn't have browning sauce, used fresh potatoes and carrot chips, not peas. added a bay leaf too. Salt and pepper can be adjusted by taste, if you feel it gets too salty or peppery. I defiantly recommend this recipe!

So I've never made a stew before so I was looking for a good base so then my husband and mom could help me. So we used fresh potatoes, onions and carrots and diced them. We also added corn and peas and after looking at the reviews we had dedicated tomato paste and balsamic vinegar. And cooked it a lot longer because I need 8th to fall apart. But it was so good! I can't stop eating it. We also used cornstarch to thicken it. We changed a lot but it was wonderful, thanks so much for the great reviews on this and the recipe!

After cooking 25 minutes the cubed steak was still tough so I had to cook this two hours to tenderize the meat.But it was delicious. We loved it.

This is a very easy recipe and one you can easily play with to make it to your taste. Used frozen and fresh veggies instead of canned, added a can of tomato sauce to it, left the onion out (for hubby), added with the seasonings in the recipe a McCormick vegetable beef soup seasoning mix, took 3 tbsp of butter not 1/2 tbsp. frying the meat, and used double the water and bouillon and could have easily used another cup or 2. The longer it sits there the thicker it gets. Very tasty result though..Entire pot was devoured in minutes.
