The first time I thought this dish was tasty but the chicken was bland.  It needs to be marinated before cooking so that it is not bland chunks in an otherwise tasty stir fry.  The second time I made it , I loved the dish!  I will make it many more times.  I made sure to season the chicken and I cooked it first in pecan oil which I use occasionally.  I added carrots and celery to the vegetables .  Omitted the oyster sauce because I did not have any,  did not add sugar, misread the dish and threw the chicken in with the sauce, used a bit less cornstarch , added a bit of sriracha, and the dish was terrific!  Only wish I had not forgotten to buy nuts as I like cashews or peanuts on my stir fry!

I have made this twice and it is so EASY and good!  Dont understand how other thought it salty using low-sodium soy but nothing else in recipe is salty.  One key is to use the ultra thin sliced chicken that will absorb taste of sauce.  Second time I added some sliced water chestnuts and peanuts at the end for the crunch.    This recipe made perfect amount for three people.  You can also increase the snow peas or some julienne carrot sticks to bulk it up to serve four.  Don't miss this!  Yummy!

I made this and it was good,  BUT way to salty. I also omitted the suger, it doesn't need it at all. Next time I will cut back on the soy (and I used the lite) it doesn't need 1/4 cup if any with the hoison and the oyster sauce. The only thing I would also do is add more veggies. Very good, and I will make again.
