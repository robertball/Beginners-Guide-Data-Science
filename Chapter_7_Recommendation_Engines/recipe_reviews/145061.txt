Good and a nice change from traditional potato salad.  It was a bit bland, except for the blue cheese flavor, so I added some fresh Italian parsley and fresh lemon thyme and salt.  The colors were great and perfect for a 4th of July BBQ.

Presentation was great for the first few minutes but even that suffered over time. The purple potatoes turn everything purple/blue within minutes. 3 TBSP. of mayo was not even close to coating the potatoes and 2 bunches of radishes. That's okay though because the mayo didn't really yield enough flavor. This would have been far better with some type of vinegar dressing. Zesty Italian would have perfect I think. You'd still have the problem of the potatoes turning everything purple but the flavor would have been there at least. I also think one bunch of radishes would have been plenty. I made as written but would not make again as so. This recipe was fun due to the colors but it needs some tweaks. If you make as written, I highly recommend adding some fresh herbs.

This recipe is great for something new to do with potato salad.  I have used both red, petite white and the blue potatoes the recipe calls for and all taste great.  I recommend for potato salad with a twist.

I had success with this recipe but omitted the vinegar and added 1/4 cup of sour cream - Delish!
