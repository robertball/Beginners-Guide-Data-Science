Pretty good! I would add more chili powder next time (but then again, maybe my 'dash' just wasn't big enough!). Thanks :)

Yummy! I prefer to use toasted English muffins instead of hamburger buns (I think they hold up better). I also sometimes add diced fresh jalape√±o or Serrano pepper for a little more "kick".

It was simple to make but I had to compromise. I didn't want too much bread so I used white bread slices. I couldn't find the grater so I had to just place small slices of cheese. It tasted pretty great, but I would put it in the oven for 15 minutes instead.
