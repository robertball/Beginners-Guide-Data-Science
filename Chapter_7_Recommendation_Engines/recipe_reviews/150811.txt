I have been cooking cabbage like this for at least 5 years when I got it from a Southern friend of mine.  We have it almost every holiday.  I just don't add the sugar, never found it necessary.  The cabbage carmelizes itself the longer you cook it.  I always cook extra bacon because my husband and kids steal it as they walk through the kitchen.

this cabbage is awesome!!! i've always preferred cabbage that was sauted, but this is delish.  i added a little cayenne to balance the sweet from the sugar and frying it in the bacon grease just made it money!!! making this again tonight.  what a great way to eat cabbage.  kids loved it too.  thank you so much for posting such a delicious, simple recipe that i never thought of!

This is how my family has eaten cabbage for generations - LOVE IT! So simple, but so tasty! To make it more of a meal instead of a side dish, try using some cubed ham instead of the bacon, and add egg noodles. Great hearty main dish for cold winter nights!

i agree with the other review about omiting the sugar, the bacon is all you need for sweetness. This is just like my mama makes it tho, thanks for sharing.

This is a great fried cabbage recipe, but like the other reviews I omitted the sugar, and we like things spicy in our house so I added a little crushed red pepper flakes to give it more zing, that's how my momma made it.

I grew up eating a similar cabbage recipe.  Wonderful..!!  I didn't add the sugar, the cabbage is sweet enough without it.

This was my first time ever making fried cabbage so I wanted to try a really good recipe. I must say I was a little skeptical when I read this recipe, it was so easy! Well I am now a big fan of fried cabbage and will probably cook my cabbage like this from now on! The flavors just came together perfectly and it was perfectly cooked with just the right crunchiness! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was good.  The munchkins asked for seconds!  I left out the sugar and added small cubed potatoes.  Next time I will cook the potatoes before adding the cabbage.

this was the best idea ever. Our house loves bacon and I love cabbage so adding the two was so good. I made it first for St. Patrick's Day but have done it many times since. Even those few that don't eat cooked cabbage like it.

I love cabbage and was looking to try something new...this recipe fit the bill. I read the reviews and ended up omitting the sugar and adding some brown onion. It was so good! I think next time I'll try using a little less of the grease though. Thanks Kristy : )

I purchased all the ingredients to learn how to make cabbage on the stove, but found this recipe. And since we were grilling bugers I put it together and threw it on the grill. But I added potato topping to it and it was so yummy!

I recently started a HFLC diet to help control my diabetes.  Instead of sugar, I sprinkled on some liquid Stevia.  I also added a bit of diced ham.  It was terrific!  I believe leftovers would be good for lunch the next day!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

We cook this often and call it Cabbage and Scoodles. Using an  electric skillet,cut a pound of bacon in 1 inch strips, fry till crispy, add one head chopped cabbage (do not drain bacon grease), cover and cook till desired tenderness. Add desired amount of cooked rotini pasta (cork screw) and simmer for several minutes. Best when cabbage is slightly caramelized.Cabbage and Scoodles!

I make this all the time....basically like recipe, except I do not add sugar, but add a pinch of cayenne or something hot,maybe a little pepper seeds.....I fry the bacon, take out most of the grease and only add more if I think I need it.....don't need a lot.....you can omit the grease and just use olive oil or coconut oil.....that is what I do most of the time....as that grease is not all that good for you :) clog arteries......I also chopped my cabbage pretty fine and it doesn't take that long to fry it.....I like it cut , kinda like you would for cole slaw....and I add some parsley, garlic powder, onion powder or saute some onions after you cook the bacon.....eat it with a piece of cornbread and that is good southern eating......

Made recipe as is came out a little greasy.  But that was probably my fault.  Beside being greasy this was a wonderful recipe will try again. Without adding the extra oil lol.

My only addition was 1/2 large onion.  Added the sugar and this was to die for.  Me and hubby loved it.  Whatever is left is mine for work tomorrow.  Thanks for posting!

I made this, as written, tonight for dinner... so easy.  I've never made fried cabbage before.  My boyfriend and I both thought it was just Delish!  I'll be making this again.  Thank you for such a simple, tasty recipe.  A definite keeper.  =)

My husband is the designated bacon-cooker in my house.  He made the whole package so I started with double the bacon grease.  It was still good though!  We ate ALL the leftovers and now I have a new low carb recipe which I think will become a staple.  I bought another head of cabbage this week.  Oh one note, it took about 20-25 minutes to get it good and brown.  Of course that might have had something to do with the extra grease.  Regardless, I loved it!

We Southerners love our cabbage! I had to use bacon drippings only since I didn't have any bacon on hand. My family likes everything spicy, so I seasoned it up with some garlic salt, salt and pepper, and a drop or two of liquid smoke flavoring, and omitted the sugar.  YUM! 5-Star as modified.

Made this twice now.  First time, used only three strips of bacon, about 1/4 head of shredded cabbage, and a pinch of white sugar.  On medium-high heat, the bacon left some residue on my skillet, but cabbage tasted good enough for me to try the recipe again.

Second time, I used a non-stick skillet, 5 slices of bacon, about 1/3 head of chopped cabbage, and a pinch of white sugar.  After bacon cooked (it didn't stick this time), I removed about 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease, and then fried the cabbage.  Liked the recipe better the second time with more bacon.

Next time I have some extra cabbage, I'm planning on trying this recipe again.  Next time, I think I'll try using brown sugar instead of white sugar, and perhaps adding some onion and garlic.

Overall a good recipe!

I tried this receipe. I could get my husband to eat my cabbage but never say it was good. He ate this cabbage and raved about how good it was. He even ate the left over which has never happen. I did not use the oil. I used 6 pieces of bacon. I let mine cook 40 minutes. I added chicken broth to cover the bottom of the pan and stirred occasionally and kept adding the broth as it cooked out. I also added a pinch of crushed red peppers. I increased the sugar to 1 tsp. I have to say, it was so good. I shocked myself.

This was a really great recipe. Although I am from the South I didn’t know that you called it fried cabbage. Oh well. The dish was good!

Great recipe. Instead of bacon, I used four pork sausage links, which were sliced up to increase meat volume. It came out very good; although, I did cook cabbage a bit longer-prefer cabbage mostly cooked rather than mostly raw.

Excellent.   I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding the sugar as I felt the cabbage was sweet enough for my liking.  This is a keeper!

I only used 1/2 of a head of cabbage and 3 pieces of bacon and next time I will get out my larger cast iron skillet and make the entire head and use 6 pieces of bacon. My family, including our two boys ages 9 and 12, gobbled up and had thirds and asked for me to make it again. I made with pan friend pork chops and Gregg's Biscuits from this site...Yum!

Yes, I fried the cabbage with diced Smithfield ham instead of bacon and served with a sweet potato baked.
Delicious!!!!

A favorite memory of mine at G'ma's.   I leave the bacon right in pan when cooking cabbage  it's great with no sugar, or more sugar - wonderful all the way around!

This is the recipe my Mama Lizzy used minus the sugar.  It's   awesome!! Try this using the same method. Instead of cabbage, use shredded Cole Slaw mix that has the purple cabbage, regular cabbage  and the  shredded carrots.  Cook to desired tenderness. Yummy
