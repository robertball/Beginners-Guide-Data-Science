Doesn't make very much.  I'd suggest doubling the recipe.  Batter needs a little more sweetness. Next time I'll add coconut sugar, maple or stevia.

This recipe didn't make 3 serving 2 at best. I added a bit more almond milk to thin out the batter just a bit. I filled it with sliced banana Saut√©ed with smart balance and honey. Great morning starter. Next time I may try almond flour instead. I found the coconut flour a little bit gritty.

Great!! I made them thin and they were sort of falling apart when id flip them on the pan. So I made the last one thick like a pancake and it turned out awesome! Yummy with cottage cheese sprinkled with stevia and strawberries on top!

Followed the suggestion of adding coconut palm sugar to the batter. Had to use coconut oil to keep the crepe from sticking to my non stick pan. Recipe turned out well

I followed the recipe except instead of 4 egg whites, I used 2 eggs. The batter came out quite tasty. I will make it again since I have plenty of coconut flour remaining.

The coconut flour did not blend well, and in the pan it separated with lots of bubbles. Then when we tried to flip it it all fell apart.
