This is a popular drink in some areas of WI. We use celery salt instead of kosher salt or chili pepper. Also try some of the flavor vodka such as bacon flavor, Absolute Peppar, Finlandia lime vodka. serve with a kosher pickle, wedge of lemon or lime, olives, mushrooms, pickled Brussels sprouts, pinch of horseradish. there are endless possibilities!

This is a great recipe.  It was invented in Calgary, Alberta where I am from by a bartender at a downtown hotel.  The original recipe, however, used celery salt on the rim, not kosher salt and chili powder.  Still one of my all-time favorite drinks, summer or winter or any day in between!

Try adding some horseradish and celery salt instead of sea salt.

I LOVE Bloody Caesars!  Ours is vodka, clamato, worcestershire, tabasco, sal, pepper and line slice.  we coat the rim using the lime and dipping in an equal mixture of salt and celery salt and finish the whole with the celery stalk.  Don't know where it  was invented but had quite a few of them in Mexico in the early 80s and it was a regular staple so who knows?

This is an old Canadian standby known as a Bloody Caesar!  You can play with garnishes the same as Bloody Mary's.
