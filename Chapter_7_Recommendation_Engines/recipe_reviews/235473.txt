This is so good.  I used oregano instead of rosemary.  Make sure that your iron skillet is very hot when you pour the batter in.

I read that you can leave the batter to let the flour soak in more water overnight, so I tend to make the batter in the morning and leave it all day until dinnertime. I like a thin pancake so I tend to only cook half the batter at a time. I don't have a cast iron pan so I use a 9x16 glass pyrex dish instead. I heat it up in the oven (250C fan) for 20 minutes, then take out and put on the burner, heat oil, pour batter, put back in oven for 10 - 15 more minutes. Comes out perfect every time.  I also use dried rosemary and sometimes a tablespoon of chopped garlic. Stores well in the fridge for 3 days, after that, the texture becomes more chewy and not as tasty.

The step of heating the pan before adding the batter is essential for this recipe to prevent sticking and promote crispiness and an even bake. I have primarily given this recipe 5 stars for that one step, which another allrecipes.com recipe left out. My results were amazing. Crispy with just a thin soft layer in between the crispy top and crunchy bottom. Salty and bursting with fresh herbs with a slight nuttiness imparted by the hydrated chickpea flour. I actually used a third to a half a cup of fresh parsley. Don't be afraid of fresh herbs. They impart so much flavour, but it's actually difficult to add so much that the flavour is overwhelming. I also only cooked it for 15 minutes at 450C. It might depend on your oven, but I would check before 25 minutes to ensure you don't end up with a burnt end product. You can also hydrate the chickpea flour overnight for an easy breakfast the next day or while you're at work so you can have it with dinner as soon as you get home. This recipe is quite flexible.

Simple, addictive snack. I didn't have the iron skillet, so I just mixed it & threw it in the oven with a ceramic baking dish. I have a feeling it turned out the same this way.  After having this snack in Liguria, I'd have to say this isn't far off. Very cool thing with a nice, nutty taste.

I make this all the time. It is a great vegan dish! I cut the oil in half. It works  fine without letting it sit. I use mixed Italian spices and granulated onion and garlic. I put fresh chopped tomato on top.

Yummy! I used 4 T. Of oil instead of 5 and would cut that down next time. It also browned up before it was done in the middle. I covered it with tin foil half way through but would reduce heat by 25 degrees next time.

Loved it! I followed the recipe exactly, and the farinata came out amazing! Really simple to make too. The crust was my favorite part. The batter smells like the garbanzo bean, but by the time it's baked it doesn't taste like beans at all. Looking to experiment next time and trying to think what else I'll put on it. Thanks, Chef John!

Loved it! Skipped the rosemary as we were having Indian Butter Chicken over it but will absolutely try it that way next time. I think it would be delicious with some garlic and green onion as well. Just heated up a slice in the toaster oven for breakfast...just as delicious!  Chef John nails it once again.

This is a bit like 'socca' pizza.  This pizza is popular in Marseille and along the south coast of France.  It is a product of the many North African, mostly Algerian and Tunisian immigrants that have settled there.  The 'soccaries', the socca stands make this as a street food and is very popular.  The French recipe has more olive oil than this and thus it's a bit more crispy and a bit greasy but none the less tasty.  It's almost like a crepe, made with chickpea flour, olive oil, water and a pinch of salt, fried in a skillet and turned to get brown  and crispy on both sides and cut into wedges if it's thick but folded over like a crepe if thin

I first had farinata in its birthplace, Liguria, Italy (specifically, the little town of Riomaggiore in Cinque Terre) and fell in love with the tasty, umami-packed flavor. I like a lot of Chef John's recipes - this was easy to make but I would not say it was totally authentic. That said I think I like this version better, as the ones we had in Italy were flatter/thinner and had less of a delightful crust.  I feel it benefitted from a light sprinkle of additional salt and paper before eating to really bring out the chickpea flavor. Otherwise I made it exactly as directed and turned out beautifully.

So. Good. I make this recipe for friends when they come over, or if I go over to someone's house. It's always very popular and people ask for the recipe!

Sometimes I add kalamata olives sliced up to add some flavour to it, or just half an onion raw thinly sliced, tho with olives is the best!

I used my 12‚Äù cast iron skillet, so it was a little thinner, and it was really nicely crisped on the bottom.  I topped it with a scattering of caramelized onions before popping it in the oven.  When it is done, be sure to put it onto a rack, because the bottom will lose its crispness if on a plate or board for a few minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly and my first bite immediately took me back to Italy! It tasted just like the farinata we ate in Liguria. Delicious!

Delicious!  I like how versatile this recipe is.  I made it as instructed the first time.  The second time I baked it in an 8x8 greased dish in my sun oven outside, which runs about 350¬∞ degrees (we were having 105 degree weather and didn't want to use my kitchen oven).  I baked it for a longer time and it was perfect.  I seasoned it with garlic powder, rosemary, and savory.  Yum!

Perfect. Only thing I changed was added three cloves of fresh minced garlic. Love this as a Sunday evening snack with a tall mojito. Mmmmm.... thanks Chef John!

We loved it. I only rated it a 4 because with 5 Tbs of oil, it was a little bit greasy. Next time I'll try 2 Tbs in the pan and only 2 Tbs whisked into the batter..

Couldnt be easier!  Think pie chaped appie,  I served room temp.  A dusting of sumac added pizzaz and contrast. Sturdy enough to be topped like pizza.  Check after 10 minutes.

I've used chickpea flour for numerous dishes, including chickpea fries, but this is the simplest recipe I've tried.  It is really good, but be sure you are using a cast iron pan that can take the heat.  My children liked this quite a bit, as did I, but my husband didn't care for it.  I stupidly told him it was made with chickpea flour, and I think that made him prejudiced against it, as he has declared all chickpeas to be inedible. Sad, but it is his loss.

This was delicious. My first time cooking with garbanzo bean flour. I watched the video and made it just like it said, and did use the rosemary. It reminds me of making a big oven pancake. My daughter said it tasted like biscuits and gravy, my granddaughter said it tasted like bread to her. I was expecting it to taste like hummus, and maybe it did a little, but it was very smooth, not gritty at all, and was a slight earthy flavor. I will definitely make it again, and I think it is good just as the recipe reads (as does everyone else in the family)

Thanks for the recipe!  Quite tasty for something so simple.  I can see myself having this at least once a week, if not more!
