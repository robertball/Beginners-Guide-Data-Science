Loved this.  I had a wicked headcold and needed something  to feel better and nap.  This was perfect.  No real after taste at all!

This was fabulous!  I'm the first one to admit I'm not a fan of either coffee liqueur, nor peppermint, but this combo hit just perfect for me!  YUM!

Rubbed the glass rim with mint leaves and added fresh mint to serve. Really good after dinner drink!
