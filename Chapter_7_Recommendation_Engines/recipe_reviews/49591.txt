Very good and very easy. I added some Worchestershire sauce and a pkg of onion soup mix in with the tomatoes and let the pot sit on low all day. The steak was tender and the sauce was perfect with mashed potatoes. ~~~Since my previous review, I've made this steak with and without browning the meat first, and I can't tell much of a difference. Now I just add some flour into the sauce mixture for thickening purposes and it's still awesome!

I have never made swiss steak before and thought it might just be an "alright" meal. I was surprised at how easy is was. I did make some changes based on my families likes. Instead of carrots and celery (my kids wont eat it) I added  a small can of cut up mushrooms, garlic and mushroom diced tomatoes and a diced fresh tomatoe. I didn't have 10 hours so I cooked it on high for 4 hours then turned to low for 2-3 more hours. I left this and a bag of boil-in-bag rice with the sitter. When I arrived home that night there was NONE left. They said it was so good they couldn't stop eating it! When my husband arrived home he said that there was barley enough for him. I assume it was delicious (since I didn't even get any). I will definatly make this again and again.

I followed the basic ingredients and measurements for this Swiss Steak but was too lazy to sear the meat or shred the carrots.  I put the veggies in the crock pot, then the meat chunks, threw in the seasonings and flour and gave it a stir.  It turned out great!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was great.  I did add fresh mushrooms and half a green pepper.  I also just sliced baby carrots in half.  I did brown the meat and not the veggies.  Then I poured between 1/4 and 1/2 a cup of red wine in the pan to get all the flavor.  After it had cooked for several hours I checked on it and added a can of mushroom soup to thicken the sauce a bit....YUMMY!  Thanks for the recipe goodcook57.

One of the reviews left out the celery and onion.  And replaced them with mushrooms and garlic.  I used that version of the recipe and added 2 small cans of mushrooms and a teaspoon of garlic.  I also added a couple beef bouillon cubes.  Probably the only thing I would change is to add a little more garlic. 
I never expected this to be that good!

I used tomatoes with herbs. I browned the meat and sauteed the vegetables too. Next time I will throw in the vegetables raw. I slow cooked it on high for 3 hrs. The end result was terrific. My family ate it up. My husband commented that the mashed potatoes made the meal complete. Thanks for the recipe that will be used in our home for years to come.

I didn't think this would be that good, but I had everything on hand and love crockpot meals, so I gave it a whirl.  We all loved it!!  I didn't have time to do the browning so I skipped that part.  Was great without it.  I also used bison round steak, and lots of baby carrots.  Used only one can (14 oz) of petite diced tomatoes, and this was plenty.  Served with brown rice.

I had to give this recipe 5 stars. My kids, who are very fussy eaters love it and want it all of the time, which is great, it has meat, vegies, all of that healthy stuff. What more could I ask for. Not only that you can add any other vegies to it that you like. I use the tinned tomatos with the added hearbs, and sometimes I add chili powder.

Great recipe!  I can't believe how tender the meat comes out this way (I usually make a round steak recipe that my mom always made, and it's definitely not as good. . .).  I put this in the crock pot for about 4 hours on high, and it turned out great.  I made mashed potatoes to go with it, but next time I think I'll make noodles or rice so the gravy can be soaked up more.  My husband said when his mom used to make swiss steak, she'd put cheese on it, so I'll probably try that next time.  Definitely a keeper!

Do not underestimate this recipe! Sauteed 2 onions along with 3 or 4 medium-sized chunks of poblano pepper to give it some umpfh. Took out onions and peppers and put in crock pot. Dredged round steaks (not cut into small pieces) in flour and pepper to brown in onion-flavored oil. Put meat, raw carrots & celery into crock pot. Did not have tomatoes, so I used 1/2 can of medium Rotel (tomatoes and peppers) instead. (Was a bit worried about Rotel, but it worked out fabulously) No Worcestershire sauce. No brown sugar. No added salt. Did add about 1/4 packet of onion soup mix, 1 can of beef broth, 2 tablespoons of beef bullion and about 4-5 cups of water. Let it go on high for a couple of hours, then reduced to low for another 3 hours or so.  Toward the last hour I added roasted garlic cloves squeezed through garlic press and 2 or 3 T of brown gravy powder.   NOTHING is left -not even a drop - and I started out with 12 healthy portions of round steak.  Served with mashed potatoes and Mall Pretzels (on this site) made into bread sticks and spread with roasted garlic, melted butter & kosher salt. This is one of the most heavenly meals I've ever made --and I've made a lot of good meals in my lifetime.  Sorry I added so many variations but I wanted to remember for always and forever how to make this dish just exactly like I did today. Had to abandon all pre-conceived notions about Swiss Steak. This is the best round steak recipe I've ever had and by far the best crock pot recipe, too.

OK - this is soooooo good. I think you could just about use ANY cut of meat and make it good with this recipe! YUM! We bought some meat a while back and it is just too tough to cook on the grill. I tried it with this recipe and it was sooooo tender! Be sure to brown your meat first as this seals in the flavor and makes it a nice color. Also - you won't get that floating cooked blood that looks so nasty! We really liked this recipe. I added some minced garlic to this recipe as well and only used half the brown sugar. My kids have an aversion to what they call "sweet meat". We all LOVED this recipe! I've made it several times in the last few months!

I'm always looking for quick and easy recipes. This was excellent. I added a half can of water and a tablespoon of corn starch so I could have more "gravy". I browned the meat, but didn't saute' the veggies. I served mine with mashed potatoes and the wife's with brown rice. The house smelled great while it was cooking. The wife says this is a keeper... I agree. I think next time, I'll add mushrooms and maybe potatoes, or serve over egg noodles.

I was eager to try this recipe to use up a round steak I had in the freezer. It was certainly edible but "blah," and the meat stayed very tough even after 9 hours. It's too bad because I really wanted to like it!

This was very good and so easy. I didn't bother to brown the veggies or meat, I just put everything in the crock pot, so I did not use the oil or flour. I sliced the carrots instead of shredding them and I used a mixture of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce. I cooked this for about 5 - 51/2 hours on high. This was very tasty and the meat was tender. Next time I will use some chopped green pepper for added flavour. I will definitely be making this again.

This was fantastic!!  Made it just like it said and after reading the reviews I also added the green pepper, garlic and some wine. My husband couldn't wait to eat because the house smelled so wonderful all day!   This is a winner.

I have been making this for years.... only I call it STEW.......and it is always a HIT..also if you don't want to use tomatoes and veggies......use a can of cream of mushroom soup....a little liquid smoke and sliced yellow onions and garlic over the top..and I DON'T cut the meat up...(it shreds as it cooks).....also great on rice.

Was not overly impressed with this recipe. I noticed that others remarked about the sauce not thickening so I used tomato sauce instead of diced. It thickened up very nicely but had to add some broth to then thin it out a tad. I found this to be so bland and repeatedly added more seasonings to achieve some kind of flavor. I finally threw in a packet of onion soup mix and a little gravy master to kick it up a bit. The carrots made the dish sweet enough so I eliminated the brown sugar. End result was good tho and thank you Cook!

This is fantastic, but I did change a few things. I only browned the meat and did not saute the vegetables. You can use pretty much any type of tasty, lean steak/roast cut that requires braising (cooking in liquid). I just added a 3 small whole garlic cloves, about another teaspoon for worcestershire sauce, and a teaspoon of... wait for it... UNSWEETENED COCOA POWDER. YUM! It adds just a touch of depth to the dish. This comes out really thick, almost like a stew, but it's so good. Especially with some cheesy mashed potatoes. I love that this recipe uses alot of fresh ingredients, you could always substitute fresh tomatoes for the canned, but then you have to deal with the skin if you don't peel them first. So yummy! This recipe is easy to make your own by adding in your favorite spices that work with tomato-based meat dishes.

Followed other suggestions and did not brown the meat.  Threw it in crock and sprinkled w/ some Weber Steak n' Chop seasoning.  Topped w/ the tomatoes and a chopped yellow and orange bell pepper.  Whisked the 1/4c flour in w/ the juice from the 2 cans of tomatoes, worcestershire, brown sugar, and a packet of Lipton onion soup mix.  Easy and delish.  Thanks!

MMMMMMMMMMMM!!!  :)  This was such a hearty and delicious winter meal that my husband and I ate up (the kids did NOT, I hate to say...but they're picky so that is not much of a surprise!).  I followed the recipe exactly, even sauteing the veggies and browning the meat ahead of time.  I did add some garlic powder to the meat.  I cooked on low for 8 1/2 hours and the house smelled delicious!  I went back for seconds...and then thirds...as did my husband.  Served with mashed potatoes and bread and butter...SO GOOD...Will be a winter staple!!!

This is awesome and freezes well too!!!  I brown it in Pam spray, using whole wheat flour as opposed to white...just to make it a bit more healthy.  Instead of regular canned tomatoes, I use fire roasted and think those just add amazing flavor!  This is a wonderful recipe that I've shared with many...everyone who's tried it has loved it!  I usually make much more than we'll need, freeze what we won't be eating, and throw it in the crock pot frozen to thaw and use when we're ready...works every time!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Wonderful flavor!! I followed the recipe except to add a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic and I didn't have quite enough carrots. My meat was probably closer to 2 pounds, but browning the meat was key I think. It made an awesome gravy without having to do anything to it...just serve it up over mashed potatoes! We'll be doing this recipe again. Thanks!

Great little recipe.  I followed as best I could.  No celery so I used celery seed.  And I went ahead and added some green and red pepper.  I thought they looked beautiful in the mix.  I used some cubed round steak that I had previously prepared but it was pretty chewy and wasnt very tasty.  I went ahead and froze the leftovers so I could save them and then I used them for this recipe.  Night and Day difference.  I will keep this in the rotation.  Thanks!

It smelled delicious as it was cooking, and I thought it was going to be heavenly.  But it was way too sweet.  I ended up tossing the leftovers.  Bummer!

This was so good - really one of those cases where the whole is better than the sum of its parts.  The only change I made was to use about 2/3 of a bag of crinkle cut carrot 'chips' instead of the grated carrots.  We'll definitely have this again, possibly over polenta.

Sauteed everything and browned the sirloin first then combined in crock pot. Well worth the time it takes to make. Awesome flavor. I also put in bell pepper because I like it. I serve over wide egg noodles.

This recipe was amazing!! I switched it up a bit though, and loved the end result and so did hubby!  I added 1 green pepper and 1 red pepper.  I used 1 can diced tomatoes with juice and 1 can whole tomatoes in juice (and just mashed them up with a fork).  I omitted the brown sugar, and added a dash of Gravy Master.  Also I didn't saute the vegetables or brown the meat beforehand-- just didn't have the time and I thought the veggies might end up overcooked in the end.  Instead of cooking for 8-10 hours on low, I cooked for 4 hours on high and then 1.5hours on low.  The end result was amazing-- the meat was perfect and tender, and the flavors were delicious served over brown rice.  Will definitely make again-- so easy!

This was a decent base recipe.  I added in chipotle tabasco sauce and a green pepper.  I think some work still needs to be done with the sauce.  I would like to experiment with a tomato juice, tomato sauce, and/or wine combination.  In addition to that, the cooking time really needs to be adjusted.  I cooked my rendition for 7 hours and as a result, most of the vegetables lost any semblance of texture that they may have had.  I wouldn't recommend cooking this over 5 or 6 hours on the low setting.

was looking for a different recipe and thought this would be perfect so I wouldnt need to stop baking and cook dinner.  it smelled lovely as it cooked but it just didnt do it for us.  lacked taste and if I were to make it again I'd add tomato sauce and paste but then would it be swiss steak.  sorry

This was really, really nice.  I have to say, I didn't think it was going to work and had second thoughts as I put this in the slow cooker . The ingredients seemed just too weird.  But - it's really tasty and I would make again.  Goes to show - you never know unless you try :) I did add half a beef stock cube to the mix but that was the only change.  Served over mashed potatoes.

I make this all the time, the only change being to pound the steak to further tenderize it after flouring it. A bell pepper, diced and added at the beginning of cooking time, adds something as well.

Very good and very easy, but I thought the tomatoes were overpowering, so I would definitely cut back on them.  I will add green peppers next time also as some others suggested.   hHanks!

This is good! I made this exactly like the recipe says except I added some garlic and some cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce a bit. Turned out great! Even my picky one ate it without much complaining. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was very good! I used my home canned tomatoes. Delicious. I would add a little green pepper next time for added flavor, still very good and easy prep. Plus 8 hours on low is plenty! My hubby enjoyed this! Thanks for sharing!

I will try this again but without the brown sugar and use a lot more seasonings...The carrots give it all the sweetness a "swiss steak" should have.

I followed the recipe, exactly.  Browned the veggies and meat and actually measured everything for the first go.  Overall the recipe is very good.  I rated it 4 stars because I thought the brown sugar was too much and made the sauce a bit sweeter than I prefer.  We ate the beef and veggies, but discarded most of the sauce.

We've never had swiss steak before, so I'm not sure if this is how it typically tastes - but we did not care for it at all.  The recipe was simple enough and the meat did come out very tender, but the flavor just didn't seem right.  It seemed like an odd combination of ingredients as I was preparing it, but I held out hope that somehow they would all come together for a nice end result.  I was too optimistic.

I followed the recipe as printed. Steak came out fork tender and flavorful. Only change I made was, using PETITE diced tomatoes as I don't care for big chunks of tomato. This is a keeper for me...

I was really expecting this to be outstanding based on the reviews, but it was nothing exceptional.  My husband said it was "okay" and my daughter, who is not a picky eater, hated it.  It is not something I would ever make again.

Good meal.  I  just  left out the celery ( personal taste) and put in a cup of beef broth. It was suggested to me to use potatoes in the dish next time, I might try  it.

I didn't have time to let this slow cook for 8 to 10 hours so I set it on high for 3 hours and then switched it to low for 2 hours.  Thickened the juice with cornstarch and served it with soft dinner rolls. Yummy!

Added mushrooms and also put a little Hot sauce in ( I put that #%$t on everything :) ). Cut the celery in half. This will be on the menu at least once a month now. I served it over white rice.....FANTASTIC!!!!!!

Yummy!  I skipped the browning step to save time.  I left the steaks whole and they were fork tender by dinner time.  I only used 1 can of tomatoes (all I had), but that was just the right amount for us and we still had plenty of liquid.  I will make this again.

Perfect week day dinner!  I added a brown gravy packet, one packet of onion soup mix and lots of fresh mushrooms.  I used baby carrots to save some time and they work perfectly!  Also, I didn't brown the meat prior and it was amazing! Thank YOU for the great recipe!

This is very good, didn't change anything but have one question or should I say comment. I am not understanding why this is called swiss steak when this is much the same as my own recipe for beef stew. Swiss steak that I make is done with flour, without the veggies, with meat and done in a skillet on top of the stove with a thick and hearty gravy. I'm confused

I added 1 Tb of dry red wine to the recipe as well as a  1/2 ts of nutmeg. It is a very tasty change!

I added a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch to the crockpot because I like a little thicker sauce/gravy (in quick rioux form, i.e. a lil water mixed in before adding to crockpot) a tablespoon of garlic, 1 beef boulion cube and a pinch of season all salt for extra flavor.  I went with this recipe because I did NOT want to have to add any canned soups....great without it.

My mother made this all the time when we were growing up but she used to add flour, salt and pepper and with a mallet, pound the flour mixture into the meat and bake it with tomatoes, onions and green pepper.  Back then, there were no crock pots so I'm guessing that's why she pounded the meat, to tenderize it.  This is a wonderful winter meal!

Super easy and delicious....only a few tweaks next time...cut carrots not shredded, add some flour/cornstarch to the tomato mixture to thicken the gravy a bit and a bit less brown sugar....we didn't want mashed potatoes so i boiled some in water/bouillon granules mix....perfect on a fall night!

This was very flavorful. I served over homemade noodles and I loved it that way. I used my food processor to shred the carrots but didnt bother browning the meat first so I left out the oil but kept the flour in for thickening purposes. I also only used 1 can of toms since that was all I had. I will make this again exactly the same way. Perfect

Excellent dish! Comfort food at its best. I made no changes to this recipe except I did add half a diced red bell pepper and I only browned the meat halfway. Tossed it all into the slow cooker that's been sitting in my cabinet for way too long. 10 hours later, the house was smelling delicious! My doggie was enjoying those smells for sure. I whipped up some instant loaded mashed potatoes and dinner was served! Meat was perfect, tender and juicy. Everyone absolutely loved this meal! Hardly any leftovers and they were gone the next day. Thank you for this great recipe!

This was great. I followed all of the ingredients but I used about 2 pounds of top round steak and kept all the other ingredients the same. We don't like celery that much so just added 1 stalk for a bit of flavor. I seared the meat with the flour and seasonings. I then added a bit of red wine to de-glaze. I added this to the slow cooker. I also added some minced garlic and about 1.5 TBS of the dry onion package slow cooked about 4 hours high then 3 hrs low. It came out wonderful. Served with some brown rice. Yum.

I sliced (not shredded) the carrots, and I did not saute the carrots or the celery but just put them into the crock pot to cook. Instead I sauteed some fresh chopped garlic with the onion. I drained the tomatoes and mixed the tom juice with the Worcester sauce and brown sugar, then poured over as directed.

I had never eaten swiss steak before so I didn't have any expectations.  I did not sear the meat but put it in the cooker in a frozen block. The meat turned out fork tender and I think tomorrow I may make a vegetable beef soup out of the leftovers, adding some more vegetables. That's what the soupy part reminded me of, vegetable beef soup.  Nice flavor.

Great tasting, especially as leftovers the day after. I made this gluten-free by coating meat in Pamela's GF Baking Mix and serving over quinoa. Will definitely make again.

This was the best recipe ever made from All Recipes!  So delicious!  This is off-the-charts yummy.  My picky husband and my 6 year old son loved it too.  Tip:  I added the flour into a ziplock bag and shook up the meat in that instead of dirtying a bowl.  Not the greenest solution, but easier.  I added cut potatoes.  Next time is will make mashed potatoes instead.    I can't say enough about this awesome recipe.  Soooo good!

Update:  I continue to LOVE this recipe!  I simplified it even more by using stew meat that is already cut up from the supermarket.  Serving over mashed potatoes, as recipe calls for (instead of adding cut potatoes in the crock pot) is best.

I was out of celery and onion, so I used Stewed Tomatoes in place of the diced tomatoes. Came out great and a little less work.

This is just like mother use to make. I cut off as much fat as I could, added a large clove of garlic to the vegetables. I would cook it for six hours and would do an hour less next time. I also skimmed as much grease as I could from the top. Served with brown rice. Very good.

This is great. My husband especially loves it. With the leftovers I use a slotted spoon and saute some of the meat in a pan. I then top it with provolone and once melted, slide it into a toasted hoagie. Yumm.

Loved the ease and use of few ingredients.  So flavorful!  Only change I made was to use GF flour.  Froze the leftovers, defrosted, added beef broth and frozen veggies (corn & peas) and it was an excellent beef vegetable soup.  Thank you for an easy, delicious and versatile recipe.

This is a wonderful and simple slow cooker dish that makes the house smell wonderful all day long.  My kids kept asking when we were going to eat supper! :)  I made it as written and served over mashed potatoes as suggested.  I will be making this again.  It tasted as good as it smelled and my whole family enjoyed this :)

This stuff is great! I did eliminate all the precooking and added some flour during the last couple hours of cooking to thicken the sauce a bit. I only had one can of regular tomatoes, so I used that and a can of tomatoes with roasted garlic flavor. Also, I was low on time so I did 2 hours on high and then left it on low until suppertime. Served it up over mashed potatoes and my boyfriend and my 6 year old liked it :) Makes good s.o.s. as leftovers too.

I have done a similar version for years and know this is a really good recipe. I put red and green peppers and onions and throw in mushrooms at the end. Yum. I also put a dollup of sour cream on top.

Nothing special. We ate it with no complaint, but I think there was way to much sauce in proportion to the meat.

I  used stew meat, minced garlic, celery and onion....browned the meat and, after adding diced tomatoes I simmered on low heat on top of the stove for about 2-3 hours.  Served on top of buttered egg noodles.  All very simple --- all very excellent!

This was pretty decent, but seemed a little bland to me. Perhaps it needed more salt? My boyfriend said it was good and he ate it all but I didn't finish mine. Probably will make again but might jazz it up with a beef bouillon cube or two. It sure did smell good when it was cooking though!

This was simple, easy and good. I didn't brown anything(too much work on most days!) I did add red, green, yellow and orange peppers.

Excellent! This was easy to make thanks to the crock pot and the meat was so tender we could cut it with a fork. I used whole baby carrots instead of shredded and doubled the amount of meat. To increase the amount of liquid accordingly I added a can of golden mushroom soup and about 1/2 cup of water. When it was done I thickened it with a little cornstarch then served it over mashed potatoes. Yummy.

One word - AWESOME.  My diced tomatoes I had in the pantry had basil & oregano in them and instead of beef I used venison.  Otherwise, made exactly as stated.  Served over rice for hubby.  I ate with a slice of bread since I can't eat rice.  Very delish!  Will be making it again

Not that this wasn't good, because it was..I guess I am just used to making my swiss steak with stewed tomatoes and adding green pepper, garlic, onions and mushrooms into the mix. I did want to give this a try though, because of the good reviews, and as I said it was good..just to me it seemed to be lacking a little bit in the flavor department. Thank you for offering the recipe though, and I am glad I got a chance to give it a try.

I hadn't made swiss steak in years and actually couldn't remember how. This was a fantastic recipe. We ate it for two nights and I still had left over sauce so browned some chicken thighs poured the sauce over and topped it with some provolone cheese and popped it in the oven. Really really good. Thanks for a new favorite

This is the second time I've made this recipe and it turned out great again.  I didn't have celery at hand today, so I sprinkled about 3/4 tsp of celery seed over the other veggies while sauteing.  I also added a small can of beef broth before putting my enamelware roasting pot in a 350 degree oven for 3-4 hours.  I used up a large flank steak that was in the freezer.  Very nice flavor and goes well with noodles or mashed potatoes. Love these one pot meals. Thanks for a dee-lish recipe.

I used 1 can of Italian tomatoes and it gave a wonderful flavor.  The meat was so tender we could just cut it with a fork.  Definitely a keeper!

I tried this recipe last night, and though I'm not much of a beef fan, I really liked it! I followed the directions almost exactly. The only difference was that my canned diced tomatoes were pre-seasoned with oregano and garlic. The meat turned out tender, and the sauce was sweet and yummy. I think I'll use bigger pieces of carrot next time.

Someone else mentioned it was too salty so I backed out the au jus and onion soup mix a bit. I also skipped the slow cooker. It's just not necessary for hamburger meat and only had to cook it for an hour or so.

It was easy but the overall flavours were ok. I feel like the flavours lack depth. Perhaps some spices are needed?

We enjoyed this and thank you for the recipe.  I prepared in my dutch oven - took about 3 hrs for the meat to fully tenderize and I had to add a little beef broth/water as she went along - but all in all the flavor was wonderful.

I followed this recipe almost exactly and it was delicious!  The only differences: I used elk round, didn't have celery, cut sugar in half, and I added a half a tomato can of water with a little beef bullion because I wanted more sauce.  Also, I threw the veggies in raw (sliced baby carrots and sliced onions into rings), and I thought they turned out perfect. The meat was super tender...fell apart when it was forked. I served with mashed potatoes, and hubby and I scarfed it down.  My four-year-old twins weren't fans, but that is typical (they are super picky!).  I will definitely make this again in the near future.

The males in my house would eat shoe leather if it was cooked in a crock pot!! They did enjoy this version of Swiss Steak.  I DID flour and brown the meat which was cut in longer, wide strips, not "small pieces".  But I DID NOT cook the veggies before placing in the crock pot--they will become tender without going through the sauteeing process first, so save a bunch of prep time by eliminating this step.  Why would someone "shred" the carrots for this meal?  This will turn them to mush after a few hours so cut them in 2" pieces.  I only put a scant Tbsp. of brown sugar in the pot b/c I don't want it to taste sweet at all.  By all means, make the mashed potatoes to go with it!

I really liked that this recipe used a lot of vegetables.  Seeing all the colors in the pot made me feel good about the vitamins and nutrients.  The finished product was alright.  I was glad I substituted one can of diced tomatoes with green chilis or it would've been a little bland for my taste.  I wish the liquid thickened up at the end to make a more hearty gravy.  Serving over mashed potatoes is a very tasty way to present this, as well as a good way to keep the juices contained.  I think this will be 4-star after the leftovers sit in the refrigerator overnight.  We'll see!  There is a Paula Deen version the Food Network site.  I'm going to make that and compare the two.

I have longed for my mother's Swiss Steak and I have not had it since before she passed away. I gave this a shot. I did not sautee the veggies but added. It was fantastic! My sister even praised it. I see have added mushrooms which I will try next time. I had to use a little more salt to take away the sweetness of the tomatoes. Also, I purshed two very large cans of tomatoes, which was twice of what was called for. I am glad I did.

Excellant recipe Cookcooks57, will make again and again. I followed the recipe as printed. I think the meal has a better flavor when the meat is browned first. I then deglaze the pan with the juice from the diced tomatoes, then added it to the slow cooker.

I really don't see the difference between this and an average vegetable soup. I added cheese and it made it better but still not superb. The kids loved it so I will definitely make it again and try some other reviewers tips.

I went pretty much according to recipe aside from adding garlic because I love it and green pepper because I had one to use. I thought this was a great recipe and such a wonderful way to use up my veggies that needed to be used.  The flavor was great, I seasoned with salt and pepper. Also--I had bought some value pack skillet steaks that were just terrible in the skillet and grill but were PERFECT for this.  Great for that cheap cut of meat that you need to use up!

Very flavorful...We really liked this one....I used sirloin though and did not cut into pieces...I put steak in casserole dish atop the sauce....There was enough sauce to spoon over without covering completely...Baked in foil covered dish at 325 for 2 hours...Very tender and even more flavorful when we ate leftovers the following day...

I loved this easy to prepare meal.  I used the formatted recipe and added Paprika to the salt/pepper flour mixture before searing the meat.  I used top round steak cut into serving size portions.  Instead of shredding the carrots, I diced them.  Thank you COOKCOOK57 for this one is a keeper!

Awesome!  I used my little chopper to chop the celery, onion, and carrots and added just a little bit of fresh garlic.  I also used stew meat instead of round steak, as it was all I had.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours, then low for about 3 and it was perfect.  Served over mashed potatoes, it was a very healthy, hearty meal!

Very good. Everyone liked. Served with brown rice instead of mashed potatoes.  Also added 1/2 green pepper to recipe. I did not brown meat or sauté veggies. Worked great.

Oh my gosh!  My husband and I couldn't stop talking about how good this was.  I added half an envelope of Lipton Onion Soup. Also, I didn't saute the vegetables. I just put them in the crock pot.  This should be good as leftovers with pasta.

Super Delish, my whole family ate it up!  I added whole "baby" carrots a packet of onion soup mix and a cup of water.  It smelled great and tasted delish - fabulous on mashed potatoes :) Thanks for sharing, Cookcook!

My mother used to make this, only she simmered it in one of those electric frying pans, and left the steak in large pieces.  No tomatoes and celery, she used water, bay leaf, and enough flour to thicken the gravy. Carrots added towards the end.  I like best to top mashed potatoes with the gravy.  But this is a good, spicier version.

I have always made swiss steak in my pressure cooker.  I brown the meat in the pan, only add water and salt and pepper and let that baby rip.  My mother did it like this and now my son does too.  It turns out with a fabulous gravy.  Good over noodles, rice or mashed potatoes.  I have a new crock pot so maybe I'll try it this way.

Just okay. I make the recipe as is with the exception of using sucanat instead of brown sugar. The meat was very tender, but the flavor just wasn't there. I won't make this again.

This wasn't a bad recipe....it just ended up tasting like beef stew (without the seasoning) to me. The second time I tried it I used my home canned tomatoes with celery, garlic and onion.  A bit better and definately is good served over white rice.  A recipe I'll have to play with some more....

I think this is a good easy recipe for swiss steak, if you like it.  I'm not a huge fan of swiss steak anyway, but I had one in my freezer that was given to me that I had to get rid of.  I didn't bother with the browining of the meat, I just threw everything in and cooked.  I did add green pepper as others suggested.  Again if you're a swiss steak fan, this is a pretty good recipe compared to others I have tasted.

I tried this recipe last week, and all of my boys loved it. I did, too, actually.  However, I think I will do a few things differently when I make it next time. 1) I will not cut the round steak into small pieces, as my husband wanted a piece of meat on the side then the sauce/veggie combo on his potatoes and it was hard to find the meat pieces when they were cut up. 2) I do like the browning of the meat prior to going into the crock pot, but I'm thinking the veggies can go in cold...will try that next time and see how that works.  But I thought the flavors were awesome and it was just what I was wanting when I was craving "swiss steak".  YUM

Quick and easy.  Next time I'll use less of the juice of the tomatoes as it was very watery.  You can add any veggies to this and it will be good.   It needs lots of spicing up - chili powder, pepper, whatever.

I'm currently living in Switzerland and never know that this is a Swiss dish. I've been cooking the beef stew with all the same ingredients except mine doesn't have tomatoes and brown sugar.  Sometimes I add a tin of baked bean in there.  Cooking time is about 2-3 hrs (till meat is tender).  I guess my beef stew is an English one as I learned from a brit guy :)

I made this exactly as directed except I used the basil, oregano seasoned tomatoes. We all enjoyed this, and it made the house smell so good! The only thing is that the sauce was very thin, next time I will thicken it up. I served it with mashed potatoes, spooning the sauce and vegetables over.

This is the best!  I left the carrots out and used 2 TBSP of worchestershire sauce.  I also added 1 1/2 TBSP beef in a mug.  Served over buttered egg noodles made a very good combination.

This was perfect!  i did add about 2 tsp crushed garlic and in the last hour i added a can of cream of mushroom soup, a half pack of onion soup mix and about a Tbsp of cornstarch.  It seemed a bit too watery to put over mashed potatoes before those alterations.  It tasted sooooo good!  All my 3 boys loved it and actually ate the veggies in it!  Thanks for a great recipe :)

I did add a can of cream of mushroom soup with garlic to the tomato mixture and, as I hate to rate on tweaked recipes, I gave this 4 stars.  5 stars with the soup added!! I do not have a slow cooker (darn it!) so I did it in a 9 x 13 dish in the oven @ 350 F. for 2 1/2 hrs. Awesome with mashed potatoes!! Thanks for a new recipe for my rotation!!

I used one can of stewed tomatoes and cooked on low for 6 hours. Delicious with mashed potatoes.

Really good!  I took my steak out of the freezer only about 1 hour before using, which made it easier to cut into cubes.  I didn't brown the meat as mentioned by a few other reviewers and it was fine.  I used baby carrots that I sliced and added fresh sliced mushrooms.  Basically, I threw everything into the crockpot all at once and let it cook all day.  It tasted good as is, but one reviewer suggested adding a can of cream of mushroom soup and that cranked the taste way up.  I used a can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup with roasted garlic and it thickened it up and rounded out the taste.  Served it with white rice.  Easily would have been a 5 star without the modifications, but really a great recipe overall.

Thank you! This was a great recipe. I cooked deer round steak. The only change was, I added a handful of frozen pepper strips to the veggies as they sauted. To the flour I added a heaping table spoon of corn starch. ( to make it thicken as it cooked.) Served it over rice with, aspargus, and garlic bread. Very tastey!! Thanks again. Tena

Made this on a cloudy day and cooked it long and slow.  I also browned the meat and quickly sautéed the veggies.  I included potatoes which were smushed together with the yummy sauce. This is a favorite of ours for years.  This recipe is a good one.  Maggie

This Swiss steak is  wonderful. The meat was so tender and all the flavors blended together to make this great comfort food. Just throw it all in the crock pot and come home to a great smelling house.

Very tender, delicious way to use a cheaper cut of beef.  I cut it into 1/2" slices, completed the recipe except I omitted the tomatoes (a personal thing, I just don't like them in a stew), I added garlic, mushrooms, and a couple dashes of red wine.  Served it over brown rice and it was amazing!

Ok, but a little bland. Not quite what I was hoping to find. Next time I'm going to add a couple tablespoons of tomato paste to see if that helps.

This was delicious.  I omitted the celery because I didn't have it on hand, and did not saute the shredded carrots before adding them to the crock pot.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly as written.  Used fire-roasted tomatoes and one tablespoon of brown sugar.  Did not find it "blah" at all.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Meh. Neither my hubs or I were all that impressed with this. Not only was this bland, the meat had an odd (i.e. overcooked) texture. Bite-sized cuts of meat can sometimes dry out when slow cooked and that is exactly what happened here. Traditional Swiss steak is prepared using cube steaks (which essentially are round steaks that have been pounded thin / tenderized). It stews for several hours at a very low temperature (usually in an oven). If I were to ever attempt making Swiss steak again, that's how I'd prepare it. The idea of serving this over mashed potatoes was great (we did ours), but that's the only part of this meal that appealed to us. Thanks anyways, COOKCOOK57. :)

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of chopping the carrots instead of shredding them.  The meat was very tender and good, but as a whole the recipe was very bland.  I think it would be much better with some added spices.

This is one of my all time favorites. I do all the prep work the night before and put the crock in the frig. Next morning before I leave for work, I put it in the cooker and set on low. Dinner is ready when I get home. Love it!

Made this recipe just as written, with the one change of using a pressure cooker instead of a slow cooker.  Required 25 minutes under "high" pressure, then allowed it to decompress naturally.  Delicious!

I made this recipe for my family and it was a hit! I didn't add the carrots and celery because I didn't have nay on hand, also I used one can of beef broth to the mix. It was delicious and I will continue to use this recipe. We served ours over rice.

Followed the recipe almost exactly, except used diced chili tomatoes and added about a half green bell pepper. Cooked it in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high and it was wonderful! Very soft and tender, great over mashed potatoes and even the kids ate it without a fuss. This one is a keeper!

I loved this recipe.  It was so delicious and it was a great way to use up a bag of shredded carrots.

We enjoyed this, but it was a little strong on the tomatoes.  I didn't use the celery, but otherwise followed the recipe.  The meat was very tender and the sauce was a flavorful and a little sweet.  Served over mashed potatoes and it was a great weeknight meal.

A pair of cheap steaks, some leftover garden tomatoes and a Saturday afternoon - fantastic!  Our whole family including children loved this.  We did it like the picture and served it over well seasoned mashed potatoes.  The flavor was so great.  I substituted fresh tomatoes for canned but I don't think that is a significant difference. But I did do it in the oven instead.  275 - 300 degrees for 4 hours.

This was a great recipe.  I took the advice of one of the reviews and didn't brown the steak.  Instead of diced tomatoes I added Italian style stewed tomatoes; a bay leaf and 1t oregano.  Served it over noodles but next time will have mashed potatoes.  Great meal for company.

This was such a yummy hearty meal, I did make a few changes, I sliced the carrot instead of shredding and I added a pouch of onion soup mix and some green beans, corn and mushrooms to bulk it up a bit and add so extra nutrients. Will most definitely make this one again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I had to change the sauce a little because my youngest is allergic to tomatoes. So I used 1 can Crm of Mushroom soup and 1 can Beef Broth to replace the two cans of tomatoes. It was really good but needed a little something else. Just not sure what yet.

This is an okay recipe. I added 1 tsp garlic. Its a mild tasting recipe and is best served in my opinion over rice. The kids didn't like it at all, but we adults thought it okay. Don't think I will make it again, I'm interested in a bit more "oomph."

Eh. This was just okay.  It cooked on low for 12 hours and the meat was not as tender as I expected.  Also, the brown sugar just made it too sweet and didn't seem to fit with the rest of the ingredients.  Perhaps I don't know what Swiss Steak is supposed to taste like.  I wouldn't make this again.

Awesome! The only thing I did different was I had no celery so I didn't put that in and I added a little tomato paste to made the gravy thicker. It was excellent and I will make this again.

This was good if you're looking to make beef stew. I wasn't. This was not my idea of what Swiss Steak is. But if what you are craving for is a hearty beef stew, this is a good recipe to try.

I halfed this recipe.  I used venison stew meat and added mushrooms and two garlic cloves minced. Had to add more liqued from another can of diced tomatoes. (next time I will try red wine)Other then that I followed the recipe. Cooked this in a crock pot as recommended and the meat was very tender and the house smelled soooo good while this cooked. Served over egg noodles.

This was good, although I did change it up a bit because my husband is on the Adkins diet. I used stew meat (it was on sale) and did not coat in the flour, or brown beforehand. I also substituted sliced mushrooms for the carrots and added some garlic and a few other spices. My husband ate it as "soup" and enjoyed it. My son and I had it over rice and liked it that way as well. Thanks for the good base recipe!

So delicious! I have never made this before and we all loved it! The only change I made was that I added some minced garlic to the crock pot and did not cook my veggies prior, just the meat. The meat was so tender. Thank you!

I have made this twice, using the receipe as a base.  Both times I have omitted the carrots and celery -- simply because I didn't have them!  Also, I didn't see the reason for the brown sugar, so I left that out as well.  I made it over the weekend and added some chopped garlic, crimini mushrooms, steak sauce, and tomato sauce.  Delicious!

I used all of the exact ingredients, but I cooked it on the stovetop (covered), low for 3 hours. It turned out very tender and tasty. But, it was quite sweet. I served it with white rice and my husband had two helpings, so I will probably make this again, but with half the brown sugar.

This was very good for a throw it all in the pot and forget it meal, it was suprisingly good. Used one can of tomatoes, 4 med carrots in 1" chunks, 1/2 large onion, 2 large ribs of celery....bought mushrooms based on other reviews but did not add them. Just threw it all in there together (no oil and no browning). Cooked 3 hours on low, then added veggies and cooked 1 hour on high, then 2 hours low and it was done, turned to keep warm. Served with mashed potatoes and crusty rolls. Easy, affordable, and good. Thanks!

This was very good.  I didn't brown it but, probably would taste better if I did.  I only used on can of tomatoes and 1/4 cup of beef broth and there was plenty of juice.  Added some garlic too.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Definitely a keeper.

This was incredible!  Like others, I added some red wine and beef bullion cubes after the steak was browned.  Didn't add the brown sugar - but I did add fresh mushrooms.  It was so good, I'm making it for the mother-in-law tonight! :)

I made this recipe as stated and found it way too salty. I will make this again because my husband really liked it.

Lightly coated the steak with the flour mixture and I put it right into the crock pot without browning. Still turned out great. Very tender. My boys are meat eatters and they ate most of it by the time I got home from a baby shower. Next time I'm going to try the mushroom version.

Great recipe.  Not quite salty enough for me.  I added a package of onion soup mix and substituted 1/3 of the tomaotes with spicy v-8 juice.  It was wonderful.  My husband loved it.  Will make again and again.

I enjoyed this, we had it over mashed potatoes. I don't know if I'll make it again because DH didn't really enjoy it at all.  I do think the sugar needs cut in 1/2 or down to less than that, it's a little overwhelming as is.
Thanks!

I used this recipe with wild boar ham steaks, left out the flour and the brown sugar, added garlic, Splenda, and green peppers. It was great with mashed potatoes!

This is great! I served it over white rice. I put it on to cook while we worked in the yard and it was a hearty and welcomed meal at the end of the day.  I added a few tablespoon of Mustard style BBQ Sauce in with the rest of the ingredients. It's one of those meals that is great the 1st night and the leftovers are even better.  We will be having this meal again! Thank you for sharing it.

Very tasty!  I agree with one reviewer that said this was more like a beef stew.  I just put all the ingredients in the slow cooker (no pre-cooking) and cooked it for about 6 hours on high.  Perfect!  I did add some extra peppers, some mushrooms, garlic and a touch of basil, oregano and chili powder.  Delicious with mashed potatoes.  I like the suggestion of adding a can of cream of mushroom soup and may try that next time.

My husband loves this!  I used ground tomatoes instead of the diced because it's all I had on hand and it was really good.  I also chunk my carrots instead of shredding.  It's a keeper.

This was my first attempt at making swiss steak, and I think it tasted pretty good.  I added green bell pepper strips to the mix as well.  Thought it tasted good, will make again, just not an absolute favorite.  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out very tasty and tender.  I marinated my steak cubes in garlic and steak spice with a bit of olive oil over night, otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  Would make again, Thanks.

I was out of a few things, used 1/2 cup ketchup instead of worcestershire and brown sugar, only one can of tomatoes, and added 1 teaspoon "better than bouillon" beef mixed with 1/4 cup warm water. I agree that there is really no need to brown the meat or cook the veggies in this recipe, it comes out great with everything thrown in raw and saves time and mess.  Easy to add/subtract veggies to taste. Delicious!!

This was a great recipe!  The whole family loved it.  I will definitely make it again.  I used london broil cut steak and it turned out very tender.  You could use more or less of the brown sugar depending on your taste.  We used the amount called for in recipe and it was perfect for us.

Yummy, yummy, yummy.  The entire family loved it.  Even the 13 year old picky eater ate the meat while pickking through the veggies.  I left steak pieces whole and just put them on top of veggies to cook all day and they were fork-tender, falling apart by the time we were ready to eat.  I served this with mashed potatoes and crusty bread to soak up the juices.  Add a salad and you are good to go.

I made this for dinner tonight and would definitely recommend it. Easy and delicious! I did not sauté the vegetables or brown the meat. It was too early before work to do all that! It turned out great anyway. I just added the flour to the sauce mixture so it would be a bit thicker. I also added one packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix. Served with mashed potatoes. Great week night supper. ??

It came out extremely well the first time I made it. But even after 10 hours in the cooker the meat was still a tad tough. I do recommend pounding the round steak with a meat mallet first. I think I'll also toss some salt and cayenne into the slow cooker next time as well.

I would not brown the meat before placing in the slow cooker, I think that is what made the meat remain tough and chewy even after many hours on low in the slow cooker.

This recipe is delicious. I made a few changes, of course. I added Italian seasoning to the flour mixture. I increased the garlic to 8 cloves. I also increased the veggies. One friend doesn’t eat beef, so I put chicken breasts on the top. The meal wound up more like stew, but no one complained. Thanks!

I won't make this again.  It just tasted terrible. I'm not sure why---probably the combination of the swiss steak and the tomatoes. No one in my family liked it.

I make this for my dad every few months. He said it's better than his mother's… and that's a HUGE compliment! I didn't change a thing and I'm not planning to! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This recipe is a home run! I didn't brown the anything, used a chuck roast, crushed canned tomatoes and only one tablespoon of brown sugar. The last time I had swiss steak this good was when my grandmother made it; and that was a long time ago. Thanks for the recipe so easy and so good.

Used 1t. honey and 1t. molasses instead of the brown sugar.  Used no-salt tomatoes so that I could add a teaspoon of beef broth base.  Cooked it on low for 3 hours and high for an additional 3 hours.  Served it over spaetzle noodles.  Tender and so hauntingly delicious!

I made this and it was very tasty. I made it with dehydrated veggies and home canned vegetable juice. Sorry folks but I needed to start using up my canned foods and since I live in the woods, I don't run to town for every little thing. The only thing I really changed was to add an extra quart of water to rehydrate the veggies. I will be making this again.

I didn't have two cans of tomatoes, so I substituted a can of Rotel Hot Diced Tomatoes with Habañeros, 1 can of water, and 1C tomato paste. Since we like our food spicy, it was perfect!

Normally DH is not a fan of round steak.  This converted him!  So delicious.  I didn't have celery so sautéed onion, finger carrots cut in half lengthwise, garlic and mushrooms.  Dredged cut up steak in wheat flour, the salt and pepper and added garlic powder and onion powder. I'm from New Orleans so the more seasonings the better.  Didn't have diced tomatoes so used can of original Rotel. About 2 hours in to slow cooking, I added a half cup red wine.  Occasional stirs gave me an opportunity to taste - so good.   Served over brown rice.  Ended up like a stew - a very good one!!!!!  DH had two servings!

I added a little bit of garlic powder.  I think you can add almost any vegetable or seasoning.  This is the BEST Swiss steak recipe we have ever eaten.  The first time I made it, we had no meat leftover.  I have been cooking for over fifty years!

Added 1 pkg. of onion soup mix.  Used sirloin steak we got on sale.  This was good and the steak was tender.  I would not like it over mashed potatoes.  Maybe some roasted potatoes along side.

I made this today.. added 1/2 tsp of garlic and used my own green chili and tomatoes..   What a wonderful recipe!    I also didn't add carrots to the mix, instead made glaze carrots at the end.   This was a hit!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe as written and it was good. But the second time I made it I made changes based on our family preference. I added 1 package onion soup mix, 1/2 cup red wine and increased Worchestershire  sauce to 2 tablespoons. It was then perfect for my family. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was relatively easy and very tasty.  Used the base recipe and made a couple of additions.  1) added about 2 tbsp beef bouillon granules.  2) added about 2tbsp Tastefully Simple smoky paprika and garlic dip seasoning.  3) before serving dissolved about 2tbsp cornstarch in water to thicken the "gravy" up some.  Yum!  A good fall/winter dish that I will definitely make again!!!

This was really good!!! I had the butcher tenderize the round steak. I cut the carrots in large diced pieces instead of shredding. I will probably dice some green peppers next time to kind of spice it up a bit.

This is a great recipe.  I did it on high for 2 hours and then on low for another four hours or so.  I, too, thickened it with flour before serving. The sugar, I think, is just right.  You do need to add salt, though. It is a great slow cooker recipe--and there are precious few of those, in my opinion!  Thanks for this recipe.

Loved this recipe!  Served over mashed potatoes.  My husband even ate it and he is very picky.  I also skipped the skillet and placed everything in the slow cooker. Meat and flour first, then remaining ingredients, then stir.  A favorite in my house! Made it many times! AWESOME!!!!!!

Good basic dish.  Quick to prepare for crock pot and simple.  Could use a bit more seasoning.

I was excited to try this since it has such high reviews, but we didn't end up caring for this at all.  Tasted just like Mom's after-church pot roast: boring and bland.  The steak never did get that tender and I left it in the crockpot for nearly 10 hours.  I don't know if I did something wrong or if this just tasted bad to us because we don't care for pot roast!  Sorry.  Suffered through a couple of meals of it and tossed the rest. :(

Really delicious. I gave a good shake of garlic salt to the flour mixture and browned london broil in large slices. Cooked on low 8 hours like stated, meat was butter soft. Will make again for sure.

I made this as is with the exception that I did not brown the meat prior to putting it in the crockpot.  Overall this is a good recipe, put it over steamed rice and it was a hit in our house.

This was really good! I didn't flour and cook the steak before putting it in the slow-cooker. After putting in the veggies, I put the round steak on top and then put in the diced tomatoes, Worcestershire and brown sugar. Toward the end of cooking, I tempered some flour and put it in to thicken the sauce. Yummy!

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe for a family of 6.  I actually think that you could just double the meat and not the veggies.  There was a lot of extra veggies left over.  Everyone liked this and we will definitely make it again.

This was great!  It didn't taste anything like the swiss steak I'm used to, but it was still really good and worth making.  My husband requested I make it again in the future.  I added a green pepper and mushrooms because I had them on hand.  I also only put in 1 can of diced tomatoes and then cut up two Roma tomatoes (again b/c that's what I had on hand).  I didn't brown the meat ahead of time simply b/c I didn't have time and it was straight out of the freezer.  I just threw everything in the slow cooker and turned it on high for 4 1/2 hours.  I added 2 tbs of flour the last half hour to thicken it.  The brown sugar adds just the right amount of sweetness to this dish.  Very good!

I was in a hurry when I made this--so I just threw together what I had--used stew meat instead of round staak--mixed vegetables--whole onions in a jar--canned potatoes and italian style crushed tomatoes--added 2 tsp beef bouillon crystals and the worcestershire sauce--left out the sugar since some reviewers found it too sweet---if you add baby carrots to this make sure to blanch them or cut them up--they take forever to cook--it could also use some spices to give it some extra flavor. I would probably make this again

Followed the recipe exact and served over instant rice. It was GREAT! This will have to go into the rotation.

3 months later; taking out of rotation. Wife gaining too much weight!

I am only giving this 4 stars, because I liked and my husband would prefer that I don't make it again. I thought it was easy and tasty.  I used baby carrots cut in half instead of shredded carrots. Otherwise I followed the directions. This is a great meal for a busy day.  Put it on in the morning, go do what you need to, and dinner is ready when you get home.  I will be making this again.

Im a novice to cooking anykind of steak,, but I have to say that this recipe is fool proof and it was the most delicious dish I have ever made in the slow cooker! The beef was melt in your mouth scrumptious and the family couldnt get enough. They were looking for more days later!  Thanks again for this savory weeknight meal.

This is excellent - I made it just as the recipe directed except I diced the carrots and used a thick-cut round steak.  This will become my new standard Swiss Steak recipe.  Thanks!

It was an alright dish for us.  I think next time I will use Italian Stewed Tomatoes instead.

it was just okay, just seemed like a normal beef stew.  i would use green peppers in addition to the other vegetables, my own preference.

I made this today. It turned out good, but it could have been quicker and a bit better. Plus, it's missing green peppers!  Prep time was a bit looong. Also, the only reason I followed the recipe was because I already had carrots and celery and onions on hand from another recipe. Probably a good dish to make with leftover veggies.   I'd skip the sauteing of the veggies and browning the meat next time around, I don't think it makes much of a difference.    Also, I think the carrots made it a bit sweet. It was really missing green peppers!! Next time, I will leave out the carrots and celery and put in green peppers and maybe garlic. This recipe turned out just a little bit bland for me.

My husband made this on a cold, rainy fallish day. It was easy and delicious. He served it over egg noodles. Next time we would add more salt and pepper near the end of cooking and only 1 T. of brown sugar. The flavors meld overnight and this dish is better the second day.

Delicious!  As some other reviewers recommended, I did not brown the meat first, just added some flour to the pot.  I added dry onion soup mix and a beef bouillion cube.  I also used frozen diced onions and frozen green peppers to make it quick and easy!  Made it with smashed cauliflower on this site.  Yum!

Good recipe. I love swiss steak but haven't been able to find a good recipe. I cut my meat up small and it took about 6 hours on low.  I also added two packets of brown gravy mix with two cups of water to make more sauce.  Husband thought it needed more meat in bigger pieces.  Will try again with mashed potatoes or rice.

This was a winner. I added a bit of red pepper for more kick and mushrooms. This could be good with rice or mashed potatoes. The smaller the meat bites the less cooking time. approx. 4 hours on high worked fine for me.

Just had this for lunch and it turned out pretty good. I am a new cook so I noticed a few things I did wrong. I chopped my vegetables to small so it came out mushy. Next time I will not chop them up so small. I also didn't have enough meat. Next time more meat. Other than my little boo boos it turned out good. Will make it again.

I have long talked about my mom's Crock Pot Swiss Steak and wished that I had the recipe. Well, when I put all the ingredients together for this one, I felt like a little kid again at home. Of course the house smelled so good all day! At supper time we made some thick mashed potatoes and served it up. It was SO GOOD! While eating I realized what the only difference was, the carrots. But what a perfect addition. This will be a weekend staple for my family and I will make sure my daughter keeps this recipe!

I thought this was delicious, the mixture of the tomatoes with the worcestershire and brown sugar made a nice beefy gravy that had a sweetness to it, it was delicious over mashed potatoes.  My husband didn't love this recipe but he is never easy to please.

We did not like this at all. It's the first slowcooker recipe that did not turn out for me in years. The flour on the steak turned to mush in the crockpot after I browned it. I think the carrots really threw us in the sauce. Won't make again - hubby and kids said "no".

Followed recipe to a tee except, I baked mine in a 350 degree oven. Next time I'll try it with thick cubed steaks and going to add a can of stewed zucchini + beef boullion as this was a little to much tomato flavor for me   Thanks for a great recipe!  I'm making it in the oven tonight using the thick cubed steaks,  only thing I'm omitting is the brown sugar as I thought the carrot adds enough sweetness :-)   Thanks again

This was great, and easy! It tastes just like my mom's. I added a can of tomato sauce in near the end to thicken the sauce a little. I used stew meat,green peppers and mushrooms, then served it over mashed potatoes.

Great recipe. The only thing that I would really suggest is something to bring the flavor into the meant. Perhaps marinating it in a salt, sugar, garlic, wine, water, and a little fish oil brine for a day. As it is now, the seasoning in the sauce is great and the meat is tender and falling apart, however, the meat just tastes bland in contrast to the great sauce.... Flavoring it first would make the flavors blend perfectly.
But great recipe.....

This is the BEST Swiss Steak for the crockpot!  It just fell apart!  The sauce
was wonderful ( I loved dipping bread into it)!  Very flavorful.  I served with mashed potatoes and a veg, and the meal was complete.  Rave reviews from hubby and son!  This is a slow cooker keeper!  Thanks!

This was very tasty.  I would call it beef stew.  I didn't brown the meat first, and it turned out fine.  I also left out the carrot and added green pepper instead.  I also added minced garlic, 1 tsp salt 1/2 tsp pepper and only used 1 tbsp brown sugar.  It was sweet enough.  I will make this again someday.

This was good. I thought that it had good flavor but a bit mushy. My 3 boys wouldnt eat alot of it. Too many veggies I think. Maybe I would try again with less in the dish and more on the side. Thanks

Pretty good.  It was more like stew than what I thought it would be (but what do expect for meat and vegetables in a crock pot - right?) but I will make this again.
