I did make this, but had 4 Oz of cream cheese to get rid of quickly, so I added an extra yolk, a pat of unsalted butter, and a bit more milk (2%), I like it thick, you can add however much for consistency. You can taste the cream cheese, but not intensely. It is very yummy. I got a double thumbs up from The Hubs whose mother has been making hollandaise for decades.

This was easy to make and tasted good on my boiled eggs, but it does have the cream cheese flavor (which isn't common for hollandaise). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I like One-Minute Hollandaise Sauce better.

This is gross. It tastes like melted cream cheese. Avoid if you have a tongue.

I LLOOVVEE this sauce! Hence why I posted the recipe. My husband likes less lemony flavor than I, and I find using cream instead of milk tempers the tartness of the lemon juice.

Great recipe! This was so simple and tasty. I love hollandaise, but don't need the fat and calories from all the butter in a traditional recipe. I made this for eggs benedict, using reduced fat cream cheese--YUM!  I think it would also be delicious over asparagus, chicken and a myriad of other foods. Thanks, Andie!

I made this for my lactose-sensitive husband. We both loved it!  I will make it again!
