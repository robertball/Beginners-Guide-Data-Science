I am the submitter of this recipe and I want to clarify that you cover the cooling racks with parchment paper not the kabobs.  Also, feel free to add your favorite fruit.  I only had cherries available the night my granddaughter and I put this recipe together.  Thank you to all who try it and I hope you have as much fun with it as we did.  By the way, I gave her a pizza wheel to use for cutting the dough.

I followed the recipe exact only leaving off the marachino cherries only because I did not have any. I did my best to scale this down using ONE can of whomp biscuits--it was easier to scale back than I thought it would be. This recipe was simple to follow and the outcome was fantastic--my husband thought this was just as great as the kids did! NO leftovers.

My son is 4 and he not only loved helping me make these (shaking the bag and putting the pieces on the skewers) but he absolutely loved eating them! Love this twist on a classic my mother made for me.

I made these before they were 'Kitchen Approved', and MANY times since...Here's what I had to say: ABSOLUTELY GENIUS!!!!! As soon as I saw these, I just knew I had to make them immediately. I cut the recipe down to use just 1 can of bicuits (that's all I had), and I used soaked wooden skewers instead of the brownie pop sticks. I guess my biscuits were the kind that puff up, because you can't reallt see my cherry in the middle, but it makes for a nice surprise inside. :) These were not only fun to make (me and Gabe had a blast), but they were DELICIOUS! Thanks, SHORECOOK, for another winning recipe that I will be making often! :)

For Recipe Group (= This was the big hit at our potluck! I used large buttery biscuits, and Truvia  and Splenda baking mixes for the sugars. I used four biscuit quarters, alternated with three Fuji apple chunks, and bookended with the maraschino cherries, per kabob. I wanted to serve it with caramel sauce for dipping, but forgot to grab it as I was running out the door. Honestly, it did not need the sauce. Update, 7/31/14 - guess what we had for my birthday breakfast?! We used apples, again, and this time added chunks of fully cooked chicken smoked sausage - yum! Four thumbs up from manchild and fdil =D ~Edit  1/2/15~ manchild is STILL talking about these from July (= Made these during the holidays, using red and green cherries (= Friend and her family and co-workers loved them =D

These were such a delightful little treat to make with my children following our blizzard here in CT. To quote my 6 yr old daughter "They were better than fantastic!" Followed the recipe as written, (with the exception of cherries..didn't have any on hand)and they were enjoyed by all. Will definitely be making again. Thank you SHORECOOK!

Great recipe  I made these for a cookout with lots of teens and lots of other food options and these went quick !  Thanks for and easy recipe!  One thing I should note I did use parchment. I think if you try to change that part it could be a sticky mess !  Follow that part!  I used 2 biscuits/pineapple/2 biscuits/cherry/2 biscuits. When turning use the neighboring kabob to flip them

Yummy! I'm a huge fan of anything sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. I scaled it down to just one tube since I'm the only one that will eat sweets. I wish I had thought of pineapple, that would have been so good with it. Oh well, I'll save that idea for next time. I do kind of miss having the gooey caramel that you get when you make this in a pan, but this was still a tasty, easy snack. Thanks for sharing this creative, run recipe!

Normally, I do not have canned biscuits on hand so I finally remembered to buy them.  I  had fun supervising the making of these  with the GKâ€™s.  This would definitely make a good rainy day, stuck inside baking project with little ones. As a word of caution:  I am so glad that I  had lined the baking pan with parchment paper because when the kabobs  started baking the butter, sugar and cinnamon mixture ran all over the  pan but with the parchment, cleanup was a breeze.  Thanks for sharing your cute recipe idea, SHORECOOK.   This was the AR Buzz Recipe Group selection.

Great recipe ShoreCook!   Instead of the cherries, I used maple sausage.   I had fully cooked the sausage first and did the kabobs on a gas grill using a grilling mat.   That worked fantastic.   I won't lie, the whole procedure is a bit tedious and messy, but the end result is definitely worth it.   When everyone finally found their way out of the campers, they were greeted with this.   They loved it and asked me to do it again, and I will, but with help!

Recipe Group Selection:  19, July 2014 ~ What a fun way to serve Monkey Bread.  I cut the recipe down to using 1 tube of biscuits.  I had 5 full skewers filled with delicious goodness.  To make serving them easier, I pulled them off the skewers and just passed a big plate full.  I forgot to flip the skewers halfway thru, but the end results were still delicious.  Thanks SHORECOOK, for sharing your recipe.  I can see where you and your granddaughter would have fun making them.

Saturday morning breakfast couldn't have been more fun!  My 5 y/o granddaughter absolutely LOVED making these!  From cutting the biscuits with the pizza cutter, the dipping (and licking) and skewering, and last but not least - eating - these yummy little treats!  We added fresh pineapple chunks - YUM-YUM!  Thanks for the great recipe idea, SHORECOOK!!  PS - This would be a great recipe for slumber parties, girl scout troops, etc!

I made this for a work potluck and it was a big hit.  I used 2 rolls of pillsbury grands biscuits and  one roll of their cinnamon roll biscuits.  Both tasted great.  I made half the skewers with sliced apples and the other half with sliced bananas.  Both turned out great! Couldnâ€™t imagine it without the fruit. Pic is before baking...

Used 6 servings of Kentucky Biscuits to make 3 long skewers by adjusting this recipe to make 7 servings. I wasn't able to flip them halfway through because they started to tear apart. Turned out pretty good and the kidlets loved them.
