That's a lot of ingredients for a stuffed pepper.   She was worried about the amount of time to cook whole peppers.  By the looks of the ingredients, prep time and expense, I believe stuffing whole peppers wins out.  If you par-boil the peppers for 2-3 min you have cut back considerably on baking time.

I loved this dish when I made it! But you could put fewer ingredients in it so the taste is purer than you can imagine. Maybe remove the dill.

Turned out delicious. But I also used fewer ingredients. I used red & Yellow peppers. Fir the stuffing I used  Hamburger , rice, onion , garlic salt & pepper, oil packed sun dried tomatoes. I put some cut up peppers and a little olive oil in the pan. Put the stuffed peppers on top. Poured a little chicken broth around. Put tomato sauce over the peppers and Parmesan cheese. Covered with foil for the first 1/2 hour, removed foil for the second. Added mozzarella cheese on top for the last 10 min! YUM YUM YUM. We had fresh broccoli on the side.
