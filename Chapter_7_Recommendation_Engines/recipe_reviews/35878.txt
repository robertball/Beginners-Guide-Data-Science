Using some of the suggestions from other reviewers, I cubed the sweet potatoes and put them in a large ziplock plastic bag.  Then I added the olive oil, using about 4 teaspoons, and rolled the potatoes around to coat before adding the spices.  A couple of quick shakes of the bag and they were coated to perfection.  I microwaved this dish, using 1/3 of the recommended cooking time.  We loved the results!

The spice list struck us as a similar to Emeril's Essence so I'll probably fool around with that plus the brown sugar next time.

This recipe is awesome. I did not have brown sugar or onion powder, but it still came out great. I cut my sweet potatoes into thin fry shapes and tossed them in a bag with everything else. I did increase the red pepper, black pepper and salt too. I cooked them at 400 degrees on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes, stired them, another 15 minutes at 400 and then I broiled them for a few minutes to brown them slightly. After about 5 minutes of cooling time, my "non-sweet potato eating" family had already eaten a forth of them right from the cookie sheet. I served these with Mac and cheese (my families' favorite) and the sweet potatoes were gone before anyone even ate a bite of anything else!! I was informed by my 10 year old daughter that she wants me to make these for her friends at her birthday party! If that doesn't convince you to try this I do not know what will!

A great recipe- definite winner!  I was looking for a new way to include sweet potatoes in our family's diet because of how nutritious they are.  I never liked them before, but we have eaten them twice a week since I found this recipe!  I altered it a little- decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 t, added a favorite cajun spice blend, sliced the potatoes in 1/4 inch rounds and coated with olive oil cooking spray, the sprinkled w/ seasonings.  Bake @ 400 for 20-30 min.   Delicious!  Thanks for sharing this!!!

I cut these into "fries" and shook them up in a lidded bowl with the olive oil and the seasonings. I baked for about 30-35 minutes as directed and then turned on the broiler for the last 10-15 minutes of cooking to crisp them up.  They were good.

Now I know why my spicy sweet potato recipe was never published!!!  My recipe is a little simpler.  2 Tablespoons of brown sugar to 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper tossed in a bag with olive oil and cubed sweet potatoes.  Excellent variation to a recipe I thought I had created!

Sweet potatoes with a kick - yum.  Mixed some of the dry spice mixture into f/f mayo and used as a dipping sauce.  The whole family loved it.  Thanks!

These are the greatest!  I had a large sweet potato and decided to cut it in half across and then cut each half lenghtwise.  These halves I cut into 3 wedges.  After mixing seasonings I put into zip lock bag.  Each wedge was rolled all over with oil and then dropped in bag.  Even though the oven was being used at a lower temp, these baked just fine. These are great hot or warm.

If I could give this more than a 5 I would! We loved it! A great way to get in your sweet potatoes without the same boring casserole or just eating them with butter. I cut them into fry sized slices and baked them only 35 minutes. THANKS FOR THE AMAZING RECIPE!!!

I think the herbs overwhelmed the sweet potatoes... It's great if you don't want the sweet potato taste, but if you do, this isn't the sweet potato recipe you want.

Thes got gobbled up at my house! I was looking for a way to get my family to eat sweet potatoes and came across this recipe. I cubed the potatoes in small pieces, and added spices and olive oil to a gallon size bag along with poatoes and mixed well. This coated them all evenly. Spread them on a baking sheet and cooked for about 45 mins, then broiled for about 5 mins to make them crispy on the outside. To serve, I mixed some stone ground mustard with honey as a sauce and let my family pour it over their potatoes at the table. This was a winner!

Working on liking sweet potatoes and this recipe helps a lot. Good flavor. Recommend shortening baking and add on a couple of minutes under the broiler.

Definitely tasty and will be making again. I decided not to peel my potatoes and cut them into large bite size pieces after reading several reviews. I placed the potatoes into a Ziploc bag, added the olive oil to coat, then added the seasonings and shook well.  Baked until tender, then placed under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp.

I doubled the recipe and cut the potatoes into 1 1/2 inch cubes. I combined the oil and all of the spices in a large shallow metal bowl and then tossed the potatoes in to coat evenly. They went nicely with pork tenderloin and stir fried asparagus. I will definitely make again.

These were FANTASTIC!  I cubed the potatoes and also doubled the cayenne.  Next time I think I am going to add some red pepper flakes to give them a little more spice.  I made these Friday night, and again last night (Tuesday).  Super easy side dish you just stick in the oven and forget about till it's time to eat.

Got mixed reviews on this for New Year's Day Dinner.  They either loved it or hated it.  Thyme definitely stands out.

The flavor was good, i was worried that it would take away from the sweetness of the potato, but it didnt seem to. i also turned them and sprayed them with pam during cooking and it made them crispier.

Very tasty! I love sweet potatoes! I sliced these into about 1/4-inch slices. They taste more like sweet potatoe fries this way (which my husband loves!). But then the cooking time is reduced considerably (about 15 minutes - I can't remember and didn't have a timer on - just kept an eye on them in the oven).

Absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to quarter them instead of leaving them whole.  I made them with a pork tenderloin which should have been the star of the show, but these were so good, we ate more of them than the pork!  I am not typically a sweet potato lover, but I am now!

Nice mix of flavors without being overpowering. I peeled and cut the sweet potatoes into wedges (about the size in the 1st recipe picture). I tossed them in a bowl of olive oil, then in the bowl of spices before baking. Next time I will put everything in a big ziploc bag to toss them more evenly. Wedges only needed about 40 minutes in the oven to be completely cooked.

Sweet potatoes don't have to taste like dessert anymore! Good riddance marshmallows! This recipe is very good & easy. My changes: Fries cut. Canola oil. Left out pepper, garlic  & rosemary. Baked in toaster oven. Broiled at end for 5 minutes. But hey. Spice it to your liking! Love it! Keeper!

I cubed the potatoes on suggestions from other members. The pieces weren't uniform so they didn't cook well. But cooked ones tasted great and the semi-cooked ones were ok, too. I did't add sugar because I'm diabetic. This is a good recipe. Thanks to the submitter.

So so good! I wish it didn't take so long to bake. I was weirded out by the list of ingredients but it really worked well.  Complex flavors with some heat! So excited to find a way to eat sweet potatoes without butter or anything unhealthy - there's so little olive oil you can barely count it!

OM Goodness!! It is only 7:30 am and I did this recipe. This is fantabulous! I too, like other members, did the french fry style with half of the potato and the other I did in small chunks. I left off the black pepper and used ginger with the other spices....baked in 375* oven for 25 min. then 3 min on lo broil. I made a double batch of the seasoning and used the extra to make a dipping sauce. (I used Miracle Whip) but its a little overpowering....so next time I will use mayo or sour cream instead. GREAT RECIPE! thanks to the one who submitted it!!

I thought the ingredients list sounded a lot like emeril's essence to me as one reviewer said, so that is what I used and added the rosemary and brown sugar when mixing the seasoning and oil.  Also I peeled and cubes the sweet potatoes in 1 inch pieces and cooked uncovered at 400 for 30 minutes.  They were crispy and chewy!  Mmmmmmmm!  Definitly a keeper!

Not bad. Crisped them up a tiny bit under the broiler though and liked them better that way.

The sweet potatoes really came out well. My boyfriend is all about spices and flavors. He loved it! It puts off a great aroma while baking. The flavors seem sublt but put a nice kick of sweet and spicy at the same time. Will definitely eat again.

Loved them.  Baked at 400 degrees on a foil covered cookie sheet.  Cut into chunks & mixed with seasonings in a large bowl.  (Much easier)

I served these today as an alternative to the sugar-laden candied sweet potatoes we usually have, since so many of us are watching our calories. They were a big hit, very flavorful and tasty. They looked a bit dry but tasted better than they looked. Next time I might put 1/4 inch water in the bottom of the baking pan, like my mom used to do, to keep them more moist. Doubled the recipe for 3 lbs of potatoes, there was plenty (almost too much) spice mixture.

Save a step and just use pre-mixed Cajun spice blend along with the brown sugar and olive oil.  I intended to make these in halves, but in the end cut the sweet potato in cubes so it would roast faster.   I used a round cake pan as the higher sides made stirring easier.

I love sweet potatoes, but I've always had them with a lot of cinnamon and sugar. I thought I'd try something different and I wasn't disappointed. These were delicious. Instead of just cutting the potatoes in half, I cut them into smaller pieces so they'd get more flavor from the spices. It's easy when you put all the ingredients in a ziploc bag and mix it up that way.

This is a good recipe...a simple and easy way to spice up potatoes. If you try this, make sure you cook the sweet potatoes in foil...I suggest cooking them in foil till almost done, then adding the olive oil and spices (so the top gets a little crunchy). If you cook them without foil, they get too dry. 
Also, to spice these down (esp. for kids) or to get the sweet-and-spicy effect, drizzle a little honey on (instead of) or with the olive oil. (This is really good for reheating them.)

I loved this recipe, but to cut the fat to practically nothing I used 1/2 tsp of olive oil and 1 tsp of light italian dressing, I also omitted the sugar....I found they only took 35 minutes at this temp...and I left the skin on too....very yummy!!!

Very tasty and different way to enjoy sweet potatoes!  I cut them into thick "french-fry" shapes (skins on) and season & shake them in a zip-up bag w/ 1 tbsp. olive oil.  Left in the fridge while I am work & then baked (or grilled or broiled).  Love them!  Good re-heated, too!  Try these...so much better for you than regular potatoes!

I love sweet potatoes and this is a nice savory recipe for them.  Next time I will cut back on the rosemary just for personal preferences.  I am also going to try these with a cajun spice recipe from this website.

I cut the sweet potatos into wedges (left the skins on) - put the spice mixture onto a flat plate - then brushed the olive oil and dipped the non-skin sides.  I also added a lot more brown sugar and some cayenne.  Turned out nice and crispy!  A big hit with my husband and in-laws. I'm making these today for the 4th of July family BBQ, by request.

These were a little firey and barely sweet. I would have preferred more sweet though. I cut my potatoes into large chunks and baked for almost an hour. I wish the potatoes had turned out with a crispy outside. They were soft all over. I didn't turn them over during baking and should have as the bottoms got dark. I must have liked these as I ate them all. My spouse would not even try one.

very good....I peeled the sweet potato and cut it into chuncks as others suggested.  Next time I will cut back on the red pepper (maybe just use a "scant" 1/8 tsp) as it was just a tad too mspicy for me.  I loved the crispy outside and tender inside

This turned out ABSURDLY good. 

I used what I had on hand...the last of my paprika (not 1 and a half tsp), some fresh thyme and rosemary (not measure accurately), raw garlic put through a press (didn't have powder), and added extra cayenne. I stirred everything together with the olive oil to make a paste and mushed it on top of the sweet potato half.

The sweet and spicy is so delicious, I had to steal the remainder of my boyfriend's serving. EXCELLENT concept!

Excellent mixture of spices! They didn't get crisp but I cut them into thin fries and only had to bake them about 40 min. I will definitely make them again as my hubby liked them so well. I only used one large sweet potato (as it's just the two of us) but did not half the spice mixture. Next time will do more as these are healthy, tasty and pretty darn easy to make! Kudos!

These were good, not out of this world. I liked them because I like sweet potatoes. My husband usually hates them, but he genuinely liked these. I'll probably make them again. Edited to add: I made these a second time and omitted the brown sugar and added more salt. They were much better this way.

Delicious!! I did follow one of the custom variations and made steak fries, shaking the cut potato wedges in a plastic bag with first the oil and then the spice blend. Baked about 20 min. a 400 and crisped under the broiler at the last minute.  So good with our apricot glazed pork tenderloin and asparagus!

love this recipe! Very good and healthy. I used 1/2 the oil and they still came out great. Also, I bake longer to get a crispy edge.

LOVE these!  I made these as directed, except I did cube them.  This is a great, healthy way to prepare sweet potatoes.  I couldn't stop picking at them!  Thanks!

I doubled the recipe, sliced into french fry wedges, and turned on the broiler for a few minutes at the end to add a little crispiness. Next time I'll reduce the thyme a bit.  Everyone gobbled them up!

These were amazing!  Followed recipe for seasoning exactly except onion powder, which I didn't have.  I decided to peel then cube the potatoes and raise the oven temperature because I was short on time (took about 25 min on 425).  The result was so tasty.  This will be one of my go-to side dishes.

Yep, everyone's right! This is delicious. I cut the sweet potatoes into wedges, slightly larger than french fries and baked them for 25 minutes. I also sprinkled them with salt just after baking, which helped to bring out the other flavors.

These were definitely tasty, but they came out mushy and not crisp.  We enjoyed them, but they could have had a better texture.

Wonderful! Our potatoes were huge so I cut them into sixths and baked for 45 minutes. Perfect and such a different taste - Will definitely have again sometime. Thanks!

Home run!  I left out the cayenne and rosemary, because I didn't have any.  I loved it so much that next time (when I do have all the ingredients), I'll still make it exactly the same.  The key is not to over-spice.  I tried using Emeril's Essence (I love that on shrimp!) but it was overkill on the cayenne.  This mix suits me much better.  FYI, I did sprinkle them with sea salt before coating and threw in dried onion flakes, which really made it.  I've made this both with and without brown sugar and discovered I love them both equally.

This was excellent.  I've been trying to "love" sweet potatoes for a long time.  Cooked exactly as listed--all the spices were on my shelf.  Served with lean meatloaf and smashed cauliflower.

Another way to enjoy the sweet potato. Spicy and flavorful. This combination of spices is a welcome addition for a flavorful twist.

I have never liked the gooey sweetness of sweet potatoes served with marshmallows, so this spicy recipe piqued my interest. And it also satisfied. The potatoes were a nice combo of sweet and spicy, and the texture after 45 minutes was perfect. Thanks for this!

Tasty!  I did need to add salt, but the season flavors were good and spicy.  Directions were confusing, but since I already had them cubed I just changed the cooking time.

This was very good and a nice change of pace from the usual sweet potato recipe.  I too was confused by the directions v.s. ingredients so I just sliced the potatoes in half lengthwise and baked them that way.  Mother-in-law and I were the only ones who ate these but she liked it too.  I think next time I might try brushing the potatoes with an infusion of olive oil and orange juice concentrate just for some extra flavor, and put the spices on top of that.  The spices were nice and really good the next day.  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

These are soooo good!!!! Update: I have made these too many times to count now. My boyfriend always hated sweet potatoes but he always looks forward to these. I don't use the oil to save calories and fat. I use olive oil flavored spray. I also cut them into fries and don't bake them as long as the recipes says. Just check them and stir them once in awhile to see how you like them. The spice combination is out of this world. Thank You for the awesome recipe!

A keeper and a great new way to cooked sweet potatoes! I didn't change a thing to the recipe -only took the advice of one reviewer and cut the potatoes into bite size pieces and used the shake method of putting oil in a baggie first, greasing up the potatoes and adding the spices and shook some more.  I actually did that early in the day and put the baggie into the frige and it was ready to pop in the oven with the rest of my meal.  It cooked in about 40 min. since the potatoes were small.  Remember to move them around while baking - I didn't and I had to toss some since a few were charred on the bottom.

I totally cheated when making this.  I used Emeril's Essence instead of this seasoning blend, because they are so similar, and I already had the Essence on hand.  I cubed my potatoes and roasted them at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  Nice to have something a little different.  I served these with grilled pork tenderloin.

Very good recipe. I cubed the sweet potatoes.  Next time I would make a little bit more seasoning. I used a plastic bag to shake the potatoes in the seasoning.

I *LOVED* this recipe, absolutely loved it!  I diced the sweet potatoes in cubes, drizzled olive oil over the cubes and tossed around.  (I used a bit more olive oil than called for because I didn't want to potatoes to be dry) I then added the spices after tossing in the oil.  The spices go so well the the sweetness of the potato, YUMMY!!!  Thank you for the recipe!

Following other suggestions, I peeled and cubed the sweet potatoes.  I coated them in oil and the spices by shaking them up in a freezer bag.  I also doubled the brown sugar.  This recipe is great!

These were pretty good- I cooked one pan of them a little long, but the other pan came out okay and had a nice spicy punch to them. Next time I'll lessen the cooking time or cut them into bigger pieces.

Really disappointed.  We love cajun spiced food & had high hopes for this, but won't be making again.  The spices took over the taste of the sweet potato instead of complimenting it.

I liked these as little bites, they were a little spicy for the kids. And I wished they were a little crispier, but the flavor was good.

DELICIOUS!!! My husband said these were the best sweet potatoes he had ever eaten and I have to say I agree with him. They were sweet and spicy and were so flavorful!  The only thing I changed was that I cut the potatoes into chunks instead of leaving them whole. I also used a little bit more brown sugar, but I think you could just use the amount the recipe called for and they'd be equally yummy.

Yum! Yum! Yum! Followed everything exactly except I cut them into fries and they were wonderful!  Next time I am going to add a tad more cayenne because we like heat but they were so good, this is my go to recipe for sweet potato fries from now on! Thanks!.... I have recently taken to sprinkling the fries with just a tiny amount of grated Cotija cheese, it gives the fries a nice tangy contrast to their flavor.

Absolute yumminess and a very affordable side dish.  I ate them with ketchup - my family ate them plain.  My son could not stop eating them and though there was a half pan left over after meal time, they were gone before bedtime.

I cube my sweet potatoes so there is more flavor in each bite and they don't take as long to cook. I have tried every recipe out there to get my family to eat sweet potatoes and this is the only way they'll eat them. There is never any leftover, they love them.

These were very savory and went well with our grilled beef tenderloin. I cubed the potatoes and coated with seasoning in a ziplock bag. I will definitely make these again.

These were really good, I also took the idea from other members of shaking everything together in a bag and then baking the potatoes.  However, we didn't really like the rosemary and it only took about 35 minutes.  Overall, though a good recipe.

Pretty good. My sweet potatoes might have negatively affected them though as they were a little dry.  I made them into home fries.

I skipped the rosemary because I was out, and used a cajun seasoning instead of the cayenne because I'm a wimp, but these were great. I did cut them up smaller to reduce the baking time. My husband, who usually finds sweet potatoes to be too sweet, really enjoyed these as well.

Excellent! I cut the potatoes into fries per some of the other reviews, sprayed them with cooking spray, and shook them in a bag with the spices.  I used 3 potatoes and a double recipe of the spices.  I baked them in two batches at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  The heat was just right for us. I still have a gentle tingle on my tongue, but no pain.  Hubby loved them! He said, "Ummm...girl...you can cook!"

I was hoping for something better when I saw the high rating this recipe received.  I doubt I will make this again. Both my husband and I prefer sweet potatoes with marshmallows melted on top swimming in brown sugar sauce. If you are looking for something easy and spicy, this might work for you, but the flavors did not do it for us.

I guess these would be good if they weren't so spicy. My family could barely eat them and we like spicy food. I even used three potatoes and it was still too much spice. However, I did slice them and then put them in a ziploc bag with the spices and shake them up. Maybe they picked up more of the spices? I was really bummed with this recipe. I think I will try it again though.

It's more of a side dish.  It might be better if the seasoning was throughout the sweet  potato.

Like others, I left the skin on and cut the potatoes into thick fries.  The recipe deserves a high rating, but the title "Cajun" is misleading-- the potatoes are fragrant and very yummy, but they are not even as spicy as "hot fries".  I really enjoy the tastes that this recipe yields, but if you want them spicy, add ALOT of cayenne or some other Cajun spices.
This goes very well with Cajun Red Bean and Rice Soup, and it is just excellent when paired with the Stir Fried Kale recipe.

We loved these!  I cut the potatoes into wedges like other reviewers suggested, tossed in the oil then spices.  I baked them for about 50 min. and they were done.  Very tasty but not crispy like I thought they might be based on the comparison to fries in other reviews. Next time I'll probably just cut potatoes in half like the recipe says. I will make many more times and know better what to expect now.

This recipe was very good - quite a different flavor for a sweet potato.  I used Mrs. Dash extra spicy instead of making the spice mix.

I tossed in olive oil, then added the brown sugar and cajun seasoning mix.  Came out great, be careful with the spice.

Someone had reviewed that her sweet-potato-hating family couldn't tell these were sweet potatoes. . . Well, mine could. Doused with ketchup, they were eaten. I think if I made these are regular Russet potatoes, they'd have been scarfed down with relish. I think these could be reminiscent of Five Guy's cajun fries, so these could make a very good side for burgers some evening. Thanks!

Cubed these potatoes, mixed the spices ahead of time then just mixed everything together in a bowl and poured it into a baking dish.  We loved them - took about 30 minutes to cook

I followed directions for making the spice mixture, but had only one sweet potato, so I used a Yukon Gold potato too since my husband prefers white to sweet. For my taste preference, it was a little spicy. Hard to believe 1/8 tsp. cayenne could make my mouth tingle that much! Next time, I would omit the rosemary.

Made this as soon as I saw this recipe this afternoon. Did'nt have rosemary or thyme and chose not to use sugar. Everything else was done as stated in recipe. Turned out delicious. Can't wait to try again with the thyme and rosemary.

I subbed red potatoes for sweet as I didn't have any. These were fantastic and I will definitely make again! Thanks so much for sharing. UPDATE: Made this recipe again but this time with sweet potatoes... even better!

The rub was excellent and I will use it for meat and other potatoes in the future. My husband and I are not big sweet potato fans but we decided to play with some flavors to see if we liked them prepared differently - we don't. The recipe was awesome and if you do like sweet p's I would definitely recommend this recipe.

These are so good!! I did alter a few things however; i added more olive oil because it needed it & I cut the potatoes in small triangles. I also added some Penzeys Cajun seasoning. I did not add any rosemary.

A very unique twist to ordinary sweet potatoes. These were super easy to make, less calories and very good.  The spice blend was perfect. The only adjustment I made was sprinkle more brown suger on top to put the "sweet" back in sweet potato.  Yummy!!!!

This is such an easy and tasty way to eat sweet potatoes. I made it for a small dinner party and it was a big hit. I cooked them until they were just about well done (soft inside and a little crispy outside) and used a little higher potato to spice ratio, and upped the cayenne. The spicy and sweet combo is a winner!

Great recipe, I diced my sweet potato only because I wanted this to cook quicker. I eyeballed all the seasonings and it turned out great! I mixed mine with "Kielbasa and Veggies" from this site and it was really good mixed together. I would make this again, thanks.

This was very tasty!! I followed the recipe, with less cayenne because I have little kids. They even enjoyed it. I did the bag coating and I even used the cooling rack method that was mentioned in the reviews. IT WORKED! Its the first time I make sweet potatoes and nothing burnt. It was all evenly cooked...oh and I cubed it too. I will definitely make it again!

NEW FAVORITE! What a great taste explosion! Loved it. To make life easier, I usually just peel the potatoes and slice into rounds (chips) and cook that way. Less cooking time and the kids like it better. I didn't change a thing (except cooking time) and wont the next time I make these either. So great! Oh, liar, I left out the cayenne...small kids.

Made the recipe "as is" and had these along with a turkey breast and biscuits. I have to agree with many other reviewers that these are a great alternative to the standard baked sweet potato with some butter and cinnamon on it. We did cube the potato as many others suggested. These potatoes were great. Soft in teh center, just a hint of crunchy on the edges and great flavoring. We will add this to our standard array of side dishes.

Very tasty!  The spice mixture is a nice compliment to the sweetness of the sweet Potato.  I cubed mine and as suggested by other cooks, I put all ingredients into a baggie and gave it a little shake.  These do not take a whole hour to cook if you cube them, more like 40 minutes at 375.  Thanks for the recipe!

My daughter  sent me this recipe, made spices, and cut like fries then cubed, cooked 400 for 40 min, turned  out lovely, used as an appetizer with toothpicks, they stay hot for a long time and are great for same.  The lady who said they were tasteless must have used very old herbs and spices......   They were a fantastic, will definitely stay on the menu......  The party loved them......

I'm not sure why everyone was so excited about this recipe.  I love sweet potatoes and Cajun-flavors, so I thought this would be a winner, but it was a huge disappointment.  I cubed the potatoes and used the plastic-bag method everyone suggested, but while the potatoes were cooked perfectly, the flavor was so bland that my entire family asked if I'd actually seasoned them.  I suppose if you like a very subtle flavor these would be fine, but I would hardly call them Cajun-Style.  Sorry!

SOOOOOO good!  I doubled the recipe for 4 people and it came out about right.  I made as directed, aside from omitting the paprika because I had none and chose to chop the taters into cubes.  Loved the sweet & spicy combo - everyone at the table commented on how good they were.  Thanks for sharing!!  :)

These were really good!  I didn't have the herbs, so I only used the spices and brown sugar.  I cut 4 large sweet potatoes into chunks, skins on, and tossed in a zipper baggie with oil.  Then I added the spices and tossed again.  I baked them at 400 for about 40 minutes.  We loved the sweet and spicy flavors together.  My tongue doesn't like "hot" as well as my family does, but even I didn't mind the tingle!

This was delicious - very much like a sweet potato french fry but with a different flavor. Like many people, I cut it up in cubes and mixed it with the olive oil and spices. I'm sure cutting it in half would be fine but this way there's a lot more flavor mixed in and it's  not so sweet potatoey (I'm actually not a big fan). Thanks!

These are excellent!  I threw it all in a large covered tupperware bowl, added the oil and shook it up to coat, then added the seasonings and shook again, which was quick and coated them perfectly.  I do not care for herbs much, so I omitted those. Other than that the only thing I did different was cut them into strips/fries so they would cook faster, and I turned on the broiler for the last few minutes to crisp them up a bit.  The flavor was delicious!  Just watch them when broiling so they don't burn!

These were so good! I baked the sweet potato as instructed - cut in half and smothered in the spices. It turned out wonderfully, but next time I think I'll try cubing them and using a ziplock bag to distribute the seasoning over them.

I cut the potatoes into chunks, leaving the peel on, and put everything in a Ziploc bag and shook to coat the potatoes.  I baked for 35 minutes and broiled for 10-12.  Tasty!

I was looking for a good sweet potato recipe without a ton of fat and this is it! I wasn't sure about the 'cajun', but it wasn't hot/spicy at all. Followed recipe exactly; wouldn't change a thing. Husband loved it also.

Like the flavors very well except the red pepper just didn't "fit".  I'm a Cajun, but the heat just wasn't good here.  Will make again w/o the red pepper.

Yum! I make these once a week now. Hubby loves them too. I dice my sweet potatoes and throw them in a ziploc with spices and oil. I double the red pepper since we love spicy. Perfect replacement for regular potatoes and fries!

I love sweet potatoes, and don't use them nearly enough.  This is a great recipe and so simple!  I followed the directions exactly.  This mix of seasonings is perfect, a little sweet and a little spicy, without overpowering the potato.  Served these as a side dish for a Cajun Meatloaf (on allrecipes), the meal was a total hit!

Wow!!!  I followed the directions exactly and these were great!  Hubby added butter at the table and smashed his with his fork...I ate mine without the butter and we both loved them!  First class recipe!!!  I plan to make a larger batch of the spice and keep it in a jar to expedite making these in the future.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Incredibly good.  I doubled the brown sugar as I got worried about the other reviews of it being too spicy.  I also sliced/baked them for 30 minutes and they came out perfect.  I would up adding more seasoning afterwards as I liked it so much.  would be even better as baked 'sweet potato fries.' YUUUUMMM.

I am not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, however this recipe won me over!!!  I made exactly as directed, the only change was that I tossed everything in a ziplock bag and baked them a little longer.  They were crispy, flavorful, and delicious!!!!

This is a good combination of spices.  The first time I did this, I cut the potato up into small slices and baked it and ended up burning it and still somehow couldn't get it crispy. The next time around I didn't measure anything, but just sprinkled all the mentioned ingredients on top of the potato (which I cut into french fry shaped pieces) and pan fried it in oil and it was delicious!

This was pretty good. I don't know if I would make them again though. If I did I would have to tweak it a little more for my tastes. But overall it was pretty good.

Very good. I am trying to eat sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes, and this is a nice variation so it doesnt get old.

Tried this last night and it was delicious. I cut the potatoes into wedges and baked them for 40 minutes in same oven with cola onion pork chops (also on this website). A quick and tasty dinner.

I also chopped into cubes, and added the oil and spices in a bag and shook it all up.  The only thing is that I should have cooked for 40-50  min, not one hour.  Delicious though, will definately do again!

me and bf really enjoyed these.. i left out the brown sugar since sweet potatoes/yams are sweet enough for us.. i scaled this to about 6 servings (my own math) since i had a  28 oz yam.. i cubed it up and mixed everything in a ziplock bag.. baked for about 20 min's.. we both liked the bit of heat on the end.. i enjoyed them with and without ranch/blue cheese dressing.. ty for the recipe

Delicious! Followed the recipe. Cut into smaller pieces so that the bake time would be shorter. Broiled at the end and they had a delicious crunch from the brown sugar caramelizing. Cayenne pepper was a perfect kick! Next to some turkey chili, this was a perfect side dish!

Made some adjustments, I paired these as a side to go with the Autumn Ham Steak recipe on this site... I used two sweet potatoes and one yam- cut into bite sized cubes, coated with olive oil; and tossed with a tablespoon each of Cajun Seasoning, and brown sugar, and one teaspoon of Rosemary. Placed in the oven at 375, baked until tender for about twenty to thirty minutes (just check by poking with a fork until they're tender enough for your liking). Great sweet&spicy side to go with the ham steak recipe.

I've made these quite a few times since finding this delicious way of preparing sweet potatoes!  Substituted honey for the brown sugar (off sugar these days) and it was still delicious.  I usually like to play with spices but did try this one as directed.  The blend of the flavors is terrific! Fun way to serve a healthy potato!

cubed the potatoes and used 4 tsp oil (more surface on the pan) and doubled spices (again, more surface to cover).  Otherwise fixed recipe as written. Quite spicy, might tone down spices next time. Also, potatoes were cooked thoroughly at 40 minutes, but "limp" - I would suggest a minute or two under the broiler at the end of the cooking time.

An absolutely delicious and ridiculously easy recipe to prepare. I loved the blend of spices used here. I did add a ½ tsp of salt to balance the sweetness. I also cubed the sweet potato and tossed it to coat with the spices and 1 Tbs olive oil. Because of this, baking time was adjusted to 45 minutes. This is absolutely wonderful for sweet potato fans and highly nutritious as well.

Really good - do not bake with anything else if you want it crispy. if baked with a meat dish, they don't get crispy.

Loved it! Used 2 tsp. home made Cajun spice (recipe from this site, of course). And about 1 tsp. unrefined coconut sugar. Cut the potatoes into large fries, placed them in large bowl, drizzled with the olive oil, tossed, added spices, and tossed again. Then baked at 350 for about 40 min, turning a few times. We will def keep this recipe. VERY flavorful! Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent twist to your standard sweet potato recipe. Came out great even without onion powder. I followed  the advice of other reviewers and cut the potato in about 2 inch cubes, then added the cubed potato to a freezer bag with the oil. Shook it up to evenly coat and then added the seasoning. Baking time was about 30 minutes at 375

Excellent, even my two kids asked for seconds. Like other people, I added thput the sweet potato cubes into a ziploc bag, added 4 tbsp of olive oil and shook. Then I added the rub mix to the bag and shook well. That seemed to coat all the pieces nicely. Thanks for the recipe, will definitely do this one again!

These were pretty good.  Followed the recipe exactly but used fresh rosemary.  I might have to cut back on the amount of rosemary I used, but otherwise very tasty.

This was really good! A great alternative to the traditional sweet potato recipes that call for additional sweetness. A really excellent side (or main dish for those who don't eat meat). I cubed the potatoes like many others did and tossed them in a large ziploc with the seasonings. Yum!!!

These were great!  I love sweet potatoes but am not a big fan of the sugary marshmallow version so this recipe is perfect!  I made them for Thanksgiving yesterday and they were a big hit!  I cut the potatoes in bite size cubes, drizzled the cubes with the olive oil, stirred them until completly covered then added the mixed seasonings and stirred.  Baked them for about 40 minutes at 375.  Thank you for the great recipe JJOHN32!

The flavour of these were very good. I cut in four wedges instead of two so the spice mix would cover more area and so they would cook a bit faster. These were very soft so if you want a crunchy texture I would suggest cutting them into bite-sized chunks as many of the other reviewers did.

My whole family loved these.  Had a great zesty flavor but not too spicy.  After peeling the potatoes, I just cut them into 1/4 in. circles, put the oil and herbs in a ziplock and shook them all together.  I did need to add more olive oil to totally coat the potatoes.  Make sure to flip them half way thru cooking.  I will definetly make these again.

Not a huge sweet potato fan, but this was a great, healthier way to eat them rather than make the usual souffle out of sweet potatoes (kind of "undoes" the healthy intake of sweet potatoes, adding all that sugar into the souffle.) Never would have thought to pair up spicy and sweet. Very easily done, ziploc fashion, as others suggested. Diced the potatoes, shook them up with oil and sprinked the seasonings on - thanks for the submission!

I love that these are baked and taste so good.  Very easy.  I quartered the potatoes to decrease cook time to 30 min. and used a baggy to apply olive oil than seasons.

This mix really takes the sweet potato to a new level, the sweet potato goes from being a side dish to being the main attraction.  It is sensational!  I made a big batch so it is always on hand.  Many thanks to the submitter.

This was pretty good. The only thing about it is it's not that unique and didn't offer that much flavor to the overall sweet potato. I do like that it's savory and not a sweet dish. I will probably make this again in the future until I find a better savory sweet potato dish.

This recipe turned out exactly how it looks in the picture. My husband and I are trying to eat more sweet potato but wanted to find a different way to make them. We loved the way it made our kitchen smell as it baked. The only reason I gave this a 3 was because it turned out a little too soft, but I think next time I'll just cut them into smaller strips (think french fries) and also add a little seasoned salt or something, it needed a little something but we couldnt figure out what. We had these with the Jalapeno-Lime Marinated chicken also off this site and I do recommend. We dipped the wedges in a zingy Asian sweet sauce.

Awesome!! I never thought I would ever be able to choke down a sweet tator! My mom always put them in the syrupy brown sauce and I didn't like that.  This is a great low calorie and delicious way to prepare them! I am excited to integrate this nutritious addition onto my diet! I wrapped them in foil to keep them extra moist!!

I enjoyed this recipe, and my boyfriend loved it! I did find, though, that it took way over an hour to cook them through when they were in halves. Next time, I will definitely be cutting them into smaller pieces. Nice spicy twist!

I served these as a side dish at a Mardi Gras themed girls night out.  I cubed the potatoes and then sprinkled them with with the seasoning.  They turned out good, but I didn't see anyone going back for seconds.

This was a very good alternative to baked potatoes. I served this with BBQ'ed steaks and my fiance loved it! He doesn't even like sweet potatoes. / Like the others I halved them and rubbed the seasoning on the top.

This is a fun little dish.  It had plenty of kick, but that was probably because my paprika had some kick to it as well as the cayenne.

The only changes I made were using real onions and garlic, because I didn't have any powder.  Still great.

Sliced into potato wedges and bagged it as recommended in other reviews.  Probably would have preferred the slice-in-half and bake method.  I love sweet potatos and like many cajun recipes, but this one just didn't do it for me.  My search for the ultimate sweet potato recipes continues!

This works!  I just had this for lunch, but it would be a terrific side dish with chicken or turkey entrees.  The recipe calls for peeling and cubing the potatoes in the ingredients portion, but slicing lengthwise in the instructions.  I did not peel or cube, but followed the written instructions.  The only change I made was before eating, to slit it and add a pat of butter and a sprinkle of salt.  Can't wait to make this again!

Absolutely amazing! The only change I made was dicing up the sweet potato into cubes. I then drizzled the oil over the potatoes and tossed them in the spices.

Nice combination of spices and the brown sugar helps with the natural sweetness to balance the savory spices. I opted to cube and roast as a home fries kinda deal. Keeper recipe!

My college aged child is addicted to Blue Apron, instead of halfing the potatoes, I peeled and cut them into approximately 1" cubes sprinkled the seasoning, then drizzled the olive oil  & let them sit, while I prepped everything else.  Baked at 375 for 35 minutes.  Perfect and posh enough for the Blue Apron snob.

Made as written. It was pretty good. I wanted to do something different instead of just baking the potato. It also saved me lots of fat calories as there was no need to slather it with butter, honey, etc.

I've made this twice, using different cooking methods, and loved it both times. The first time I wrapped the seasoned sweet potatoes in foil and cooked the packet on the grill. The second time I sauteed them in olive oil for 10 or so minutes, then added all seasonings but brown sugar and sauteed for another 5 minutes, then added the brown sugar and sauteed for another 5 minutes. I will definitely keep making these!

These are easy to make and a wonderful combination of spices to add as a side dish to any meal. If you have someone in your family that does not eat sweet potatoes, just cut up a few red (or white) potatoes to toss in there with the sweet potatoes! Pleases everyone! :)

These are pretty tasty.  I had to omit the garlic because I live with a vampire, but I'm getting used to that *sigh.  I only gave them 4 stars because I thought it was kind of heavy on the spices.  3/4 or maybe even half would have been sufficient.  The rosemary and thyme were overpowering in my opinion.  I served these with bbq beef sandwiches.
I made these again, cutting the rosemary and thyme in half and they were much better.  I wish I had cut the cayenne, too, though.  Next time.  They are definitely worth making again.  Eventually, I'll get it right!

We can't have the brown sugar, so I mixed all the spices and added them into an olive oil and cooking sherry blend just to moisten it. The flavor is great and the sweet potato was plenty sweet enough without the brown sugar added.

Really delicious! I do wish I had read the reviews before making it because I think it would definitely have been better had I cubed the potatoes. They were good just halved as well though. However, I did have to add butter on top; they were too dry without it.

Great, I also cubed the potatoes for faster cooking but everything else was spot on.  I let them get a little extra crispy and drizzled with balsamic and it was amazing.

Maybe it depends on your expectations...  I expected some sweet and savory to come through here, but it did not.    It needed butter and salt to bring it to life, then it was okay.   Definitely shake to coat in a zip lock baggie and be sure to use non-stick spray in the pan.    Something different so it's not bad, but consider your expectations and what you are serving with this dish as you put it together.

Cut into large chunks per other's suggestions. Mixed with olive oil in a large bowl. Mixed the spices in a small bowl then tossed them with the potatoes. Turned out great!

It doesn't say to cube them in the recipie but you should before they go in the oven. For easy coating, put olive oil and spices/herbs into plastic bag along with potato cubes and shake to coat evenly. You may want to up the amount of seasonings too. Seemed a bit conservative to me.

Loved it. I cut them into cubes though and reduced baking time to about a half hour.  I had to double the spice/oil mixture as well.  Shook them up in a ziplock.

I JUST realized I didn't follow the recipe. I went by the picture (and my usual cooking method) and CUBED the potatoes, mixed it with the seasoning, and roasted until they were tender. I found I had nearly double the seasoning I would've liked, but I did enjoy the flavor. Came together quickly and was a nice not-overly spicy side dish.

This recipe was delicious.  Cubed the sweet potatoes per other reviews, cooked around 40 minutes or so and could've just eaten this for dinner.  Will definitely become a regular in our house.

These are AMAZING.  Works great with Japanese sweet potato, which has a slightly different flavor that the more orange kind of sweet potato.

a good alternative to sickly sweet sweetpotatoes.  Will make these again.  I too cut them in to cubes so they would roast faster.

I didn't have any rosemary, and these still tasted great. This is a great change from your usual sweet potato recipes that use lots of butter and sugar. This recipe has a little kick to it, giving it a unique, delicious flavor

Really good!  I think I might mash the sweet potatoes together next time, to spread the spice throughout the potato.  I didn't have any ground onion and added a little dried minced onion - it worked fine.

Love this recipe.  I like to chop the sweet potatoes up into chunks and pour the seasoning all over it and roast it that way.  This marinade is also good on other vegetables...red peppers, red onion, potatoes, asparagus, etc.  Good Stuff!

so many things you can do with the sweet potato! I love this recipe, but my son and husband won't even try it. I may try to make into fries like other reviewers. Yams and sweet potatoes are so good for you and tasty too! Thanks for another idea using sweet potatoes besides pie.

This recipe was very tasty.  I liked it a lot.  I didn't have all the individual spices on hand, but did use Tony Cachere's seasoning instead.  I like to cook up several things on Sunday to take to lunch throughout the week and this warms up great.  I will make this again.

Wasn't crazy about the rosemary in the mix. All else was good, though. I think I prefer sweet potatoes cut a little thinner to get more of a crisp to them. Will probably use spice mixture minus rosemary to fry size slices next time.

Not my favorite. The seasoning is too overpowering for my taste. I think I will go back to my baked sweet potatoes with with butter and brown sugar.
