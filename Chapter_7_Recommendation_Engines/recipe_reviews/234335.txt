This dip is really tasty. I did make a couple of changes: I felt like it needed salt and pepper, I only used 3/4 of the salsa. I added 2 small whole chopped tomatoes and went very light on the cheese. Next time I will leave the cheese out. Great for a party. Took me like 10 mins to make-easy.

This was very good! I scaled the recipe back to use just one avocado, but I did not put all of the green salsa b/c I was afraid it would be too watery, so I just kept adding it until it was the consistancy that I was looking for. This had a really nice flavor...I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good basic dip. Used a red salsa and added minced onions.  You could also add garlic and any other seasonings you like.

Way to much sour cream and a little watery. A good recipe otherwise. But definitely cut back on the sour cream and salsa.
