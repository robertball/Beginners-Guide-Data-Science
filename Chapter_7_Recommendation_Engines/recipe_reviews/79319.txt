I made this as a Thanksgiving appetizer and served it over a round of brie warmed in the oven for about 20 mins.  It was excellent.  The leftover sauce was fabulous with our turkey and great on our sandwiches the next day.  Extremely easy to make, and very good.

This is a delicious sauce.  The orange and port really bring out the fruitiness of the cranberry flavor, and the amount of sugar is just right for a tart/sweet balance.  I've tried it with both brown and white sugar -- with white sugar it is a little lighter, and you want about a tablespoon less of port (half a cup instead of 9 tablespoons).  It's tasty both ways, but a brighter color if you use white sugar and ruby port.

This was so good; I've never made cranberry sauce from scratch before... but it was so easy. I will never eat cranberry sauce out of a can again. The sauce only took about 10 minutes to thicken for me.

I reserved about 1/2 cup of the cranberries and soaked them in hot sugar water. I put them in the sauce after it was done. The red of the whole berries really popped against the dark color of the sauce. Delicious.

I'm giving this version 4 stars.  It is good but to make it better use a tawny port bringing out the flavor of the brown sugar more and give it caramel notes.  I like Cockburns' 20 Year Tawny Port.  1/2 cup is more than plenty for the port.  I also found a teaspoon of McCormick's Valencia Orange Peel did quite well instead of fresh zest.  In place of a fresh orange you can use 1/2 cup orange juice.  Also, put the ingredients other than the cranberries in the pot stir until the sugar dissolves.  After rinsing the cranberries put them in the pot over medium heat.  Stir periodically and be aware it will bubble up so a 2 3/4 quart pan worked best.  I also found it best to let all the berries pop and this can take about an hour in the uncovered pot.  This also helps burn off the alcohol but leaves the rich port flavor.  Make at least one night before you want to use it.

This sauce was amazing!   It was great to make a few days before Thanksgiving and keep in the fridge.  The flavor was robust and a wonderful gourmet substitution for canned sauce.   A must have!

This was great. I didn't think the difference between white and dk brown sugar would be that big, but that maple-y flavor of the dk brown sugar, the orange and wine make these cranberries delish!

this is excellent! the ruby port gives it a nice twist. Just the right balance of sugar to tart too. I used 1/2 cup white and 1/4 brown. left everything else as is.  I like a more solid sauce so I cooked it down and it set up beautifully. Not too solid but not runny either.  I can see where this would be divine over a round of brie for the holidays. thanks so much!

The flavor is very good.  It's just a little on the tart side for me, though.  I added a dash of vanilla but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  I used ruby port but wonder how the tawny would work since it's a bit sweeter.  I may try that next as I love the flavor of port, and homemade sauce is the way to go.

This will be a regular on our Thanksgiving table! Simple, unusual and delicious. The port wine makes it stand out! Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, and am glad I did. I had only ruby port, and it tasted and looked amazing. The sauce thickened fully during the chilling time so don’t worry if it isn’t quite the right consistency when you take it off the stovetop in the time the recipe states.

This was very good.  It had too much orange taste for me.  Everything else was just right.  Next time I will just add a little less of the orange zest and a little water instead of the orange juice for my taste. Everyone loved it! Thanks for the great recipe! :)
