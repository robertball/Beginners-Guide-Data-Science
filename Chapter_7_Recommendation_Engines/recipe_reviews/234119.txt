This was a LITTLE bland, but I added a dash of chili pepper, s&p, and a few shakes of garlic powder along with an extra half-cup of Parmesan (oh, I used Parmesan instead of Romano since there was no Romano to be found at my grocery store). Absolute perfection! I will DEFINITELY make this again. It was awesome!!

this was really good.  I was looking for a zucchini recipe to use some of the ones from my garden .  I really liked the combination of ingredients and the end result was very tasty.  I will definitely make again and again!

Made this soup exactly as written and it was DELICIOUS. I received many compliments from my family  and we all agreed it was up to the standards of a high-quality, expensive restaurant.

So delicious out of all the zucchini recipes we tried this week. This was the family favorite.  Even the kids liked it :) I added a clove of garlic next time I might add 2 but other than that recipe is perfect :)

This was wonderful!  And I don't even like zucchini.  Used the whole bag of spinach and 2 onions.  Added 1 T. garlic powder and 15 grinds of black pepper.
