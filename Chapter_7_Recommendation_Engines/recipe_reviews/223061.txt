The frozen cubes are very handy for later use.  
At first, I though the amount of oil would be excessive, but after considering there was no cheese in the recipe, it made sense.
I added plenty of salt to taste, again, to compensate for the missing cheese.
A great vegan pesto!

The roasted garlic and I used toasted peanuts made a fine touch. Blanching is good too for preserving the color.
