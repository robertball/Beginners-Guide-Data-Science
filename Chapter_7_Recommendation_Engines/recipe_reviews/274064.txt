I made it exactly like the receipt.  The spices  
were way over the top.  Too much chili powder and cumin.

The recipe was great and I'm so glad I made it. It was my first attempt at making some kind of curry. I added a bit of salt towards the end but other than that, it was perfect!

This was seriously delicious! I added a bit of salt, but otherwise made exactly as is. My whole family devoured their plates.
