This is a good base recipe, easy to work with and make the way you want. I added a can of red beans, some garlic powder, Adobo seasoning and a couple of dashes of cayenne. I also used brown rice instead of white. Very easy and inexpensive! Thanks for sharing.

My mom makes something like this as well. She started out making it in college since the base is rice so it is very cheap  and you can make a lot to keep in the fridge for the week. Try switching the veggies up (carrots, celery, and corn taste great in it!) and adding some shredded cheese (I use cheddar).

We really enjoyed this one skillet meal!  It's a great versatile recipe!  I only had 1/2 a red bell pepper, so I added chopped carrots and some frozen kernel corn to make up for it.  I added spices like cayenne pepper, oregano, & paprika for additional flavor.  I also substituted beef broth for the bouillon granules & water.  I used 1/2 cup of the beef broth to simmer with the browned beef & veggies while I cooked the rice separately in 1 1/2 cups of the beef broth, then added the rice to the skillet at the end so that I didn't end up with overcooked rice.  It worked out well!  We like to sprinkle some tobasco on top for an extra kick!

This is a great recipe that my mother used to make also.  It was one of those family favorites and a staple in our home.  The only difference was that she didn't put in the bell peppers but did add some garlic.  Also she sometimes added chopped tomatoes too.  Great recipe.

If you like a tiny bit of bite, substitute diced Andouille sausage for ground beef. It becomes a medium-mild and inexpensive "poor man's jambalaya," missing the obvious seasonings, blackened chicken and shrimp/crawdads, of course.

Great recipe!!!  What a quick, easy and budget friendly dish!  I didn't have any green or red peppers so I used a can of drained zesty jalape√±o diced tomatoes and added water to the liquid to measure just over 2 cups and didn't add any salt since my tomatoes were seasoned.  I will make with peppers this summer when I can pick them fresh out of my garden.  I am definitely adding this to my normal dinner rotation!  Thanks Ann!

This was okay, but unexciting. Paula Dean's is much better.  She uses bulk pork sausage and chicken livers with parsley and celery.  I recommend Paula's, it's much tastier.  Mmmmm . . .

For all of those of us who live in terror, wondering what to feed the next wave of marauding hordes who come to lay waste to the kitchen contents, this is a life-saving recipe. I make it in triple batches and freeze it for brown bag lunches, quick snacks or on the go dinners. I add lots of things: Diced jalapenos, spinach, peas, corn, scrambled eggs,  cilantro... whatever I have, need to use up and which I intuitively determine will taste good. The point is I gotta feed the boys and I gotta do it on a budget and I gotta do it so they're well-nourished and, many times, have to take care of it themselves. This fits the bill in all those categories. If you're going to build up the volume of the meal, be sure you adjust the seasonings, which is why I made note about the jalapenos and cilantro. I usually add more onions and some garlic and only a little bouillon, only because of the salt content. Very tasty, very easy, and freezes well.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight with excellent results.  The changes I made were to use ground turkey breast instead of beef and I also added ketchup for a finishing touch that made it a very good meal that will keep me going throughout the week

I  think that your concept, and the way you presented your recipe is fool-proof! Most of us are pretty seasoned home cooks, and know that ANY recipe can be modified, so I won't bother insulting you...because you already mentioned that iy can be changed up. My family calls any recipe like this a "goulash". (Rice goulash, potato goulash, noodle goulash) Thanks for sharing!

This was fairly quick and very very easy. Great flavor too. I used onion powder and didn't have any red pepper and only a little frozen green pepper so I added a half tsp of cajun seasoning and a pinch of cayenne instead of salt. I used ground round and didn't drain the grease as there wasn't much and added the rice in and let it cook dry for a couple of minutes before adding the water. This was really good and handy for a weeknight meal without much fuss.

A new family FAV. I made it exactly as written and it turned out great. I think maybe I could even skip the uncooked rice and just add some leftover cooked rice when its handy. Loved how quickly this served up

Leave out the green bellpeppers and use as a stuffing for bellpeppers ... yummy ... simply make ... stuff bellpeppers ... and bake with a little water/wine in the bottom of the pan ... add grated cheese on top ... or perhaps little pieces of bacon ... serve with a substantial salad ...

Really quick and good weekday meal! I added a bit of garlic to the beef before cooking and took out the red bell pepper as I didn't have any on hand. The meat mix looked a little plain so when I added in the rice I also added in a can of corn (drained) and a cal of Rotelle tomatoes for a bit of a kick...It was fantastic with a bit if ketchup on top! It even reheated well for lunch the next day! This one is a keeper!!!

Hallalujah! Somebody that knows how to make dirty rice from scratch without using a dirty rice mix!!! Thank you!  I'd add Garlic Powder and Parsley flakes to this recipe to make it a 5 star dish, though.

This was a really great recipe.  As suggested by the other reviews here which I took into consideration, this is a great little recipe to have on hand.  I am sure that the leftovers (if you're fortunate to have any) will be as tasty the next day.  One thing I did add to it was Club House "Cajun" seasoning to spice it up a bit.  I also added about 1 TBS of Worchester Sauce to the meat and used Basamati rice instead of white rice.   This is a keeper recipe for me.  Thanks.

This was a very easy, tasty last minute meal to throw together. I didn't use the peppers as I didn't have any on hand. I added a can of Rotel at the advice of others, which added a nice kick. The seasoning was very good. I added a little ketchup to my 2 year old's plate and he gobbled it up. Will def make again. Thanks!

I don't eat beef so subbed the meat with buffalo and the bouillon with chicken boullion.  I used all seasoned salt.  This meal would be better with chopped pimento olives.  Loved it!

I do something very similar, but I add some fresh herbs from my garden. Things like Thyme, Parsley and Origanum together with a little garlic.

We love this one for a quick meal on a busy night. I also love that all of the ingredients are items that I keep on hand and it's e.a.s.y on the budget. I add a couple of chopped cloves of garlic when I'm browning the hamburger. I also use 2 cups of beef broth instead of the bullion and water. For some kick I add a little cayenne pepper and about a teaspoon of cajun seasoning. Tasty!

Recently fixed the rice dish for dinner, prepared it exactly as stated in recipe. We enjoyed it and we had enough for leftovers the next night. Think it was even better the second night, spices had really had a chance to do their thing. I will use the recipe again, thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderful basic recipe! I did it pretty much exactly as stated, only added some Worcester sauce later and a bit of grated cheese and the man loved it. :) I will definitely be making this again, and also experiment with the ingredients.

This is a big hit in our house (including with our 4 and 1 year olds)!!  We substituted sausage for ground beef and thought it was delicious!

Pretty good.  The only issue I had was it was slightly bland and like another reviewer stated a little soupy.  I used instant rice which requires 1 cup of water per 1 cup of rice but  I followed the recipe for 2 cups of water.  Will definitely make again adding more spices and with less water since it was a quick and overall good meal.

I thought this was pretty god. Instead of using salt, I just used the seasoning salt in place of regular salt. I served this as a fast and easy main course.

I only rated this 3 stars out of kindness....where is the spice? and the salt level was too high. why no use low sodium beef broth instead? Next issue...where is the heat? this is a cajan recipe...no fire no sizzle, and lastly dirty rice is made with ground chicken livers, they give it a unique flavor.  On the upside this makes a pretty good one pot ground beef recipe.  Please change to low sodium granules or beef broth.

This is a great recipe, I was raised on a recipe similar to this one...Only in spanish we called it "aroz con carne", which is ground beef and rice. A few more spices, our spices, garlic powder, cumin, oregano,just enough salt and pepper to taste. instead of 2 c  water, 1 can chicken broth, and enough water just to cover the rice.bring to a boil then simmer until rice is fluffy and tendeand is not soupy. serve with a side of  refried beans, Delicious.

This was super quick and easy to make. I have 3 extremely picky children and it is rare to cook something that they ALL 3 like. They all not only cleaned their plates but two of them even requested seconds! My husband also gave it five stars. This is a new family favorite for sure!! Thanks Ann.

This was a good simple meal and I needed to use up a bunch of peppers. I used Yellow pepper along with the green and red. I Only gave it four stars becuase I made it as written and I think It would have been much better if I made the rice seperate and then added it to the cooked meat and peppers. I think it lost alot of its natural flavor and made it too soupy to do it all in one dish.

Very yummy. I used brown rice instead of white and had to add three cups of water instead of one. I cooked the rice for 10 min before adding to the meat. Then mixed with ground turkey and cooked for 30-35 min until rice was tender. I also used 1 beef cube per each cup of water added. Substituted ground turkey for beef and added one chopped chicken/bell pepper sausage link from Costco and a half cup of powdered parmesan to the ground turkey. My two year old daughter and family loved it!

Good base recipe. Made this using brown rice and homemade biscuits. I could have use a little more seasoning, but it was still good. I could see myself adding some more veggies, like corn and adding more protein like shrimp and maybe some yellow rice.

I haven't had dirty rice since I was a kid. This didn't taste exactly how I remember it, but it was  good.  Even my picky Aussie boyfriend liked it.  I'll make it for my sister next week and see what she thinks.  :-)

Good...tastes similar to the box mix.  Used beef broth instead of bouillon and did not add any additional salt.  Added a little garlic powder to liven it up a little.

This was good. I used ground turkey and added corn instead of the red bell pepper. I also cooked the rice in chicken broth and omitted the salt. Overall the dish was a fast good meal.

We loved this recipe!  My only suggestion would be to add more rice.  I'm not big on meat and adding the rice can make leftovers for one of those busy days or lunch the next day.

We loved this!  The only change I made, was that I used garlic salt instead of plain table salt because we love garlic.  I used to make Zatarains's dirty rice all the time but I never will again!  This is way better and home made!  YUM!

This was really tasty given that the only seasonings are salt and pepper! It's so very simple, incredibly easy to make, and unbelievably good. I think the next time I make it I will experiment with some Cajun seasoning but otherwise, it's perfect the way it is.

This was a quick and tasty all-in-one dish! I subbed brown rice and it tasted great. It produced several servings and I pared the dish with asparagus.

My family thought this recipe was great, only thing I did differently was I substituted 2 large carrots (shredded) for the red pepper. I only used 1 teaspoon of better than bouillon and left out the rest of the salts and I used 2 cups of beef broth and 2 cups of rice.

This was delicious but I have to say, I omitted the 1/2 tsp. of salt because I felt the bouillon and seasoning salt would be sufficient, and I'm glad I did - it would have been WAY too salty if I'd added the salt. Otherwise added my own things as others suggested - I only had 1/2 lb. of ground beef so I added pork sausage meat (took pork sausages out of their casing) to make 1 lb, then added chopped celery, carrot, dash of worcestershire - hubby and daughter loved it!

I have made a version of this for many years, but I add a can of whole tomatoes, chopped.  My boys grew up loving it, too!  One of our favorite dishes.  I also used garlic powder, and limited the salt because we were trying not to eat too much sodium.  Many great ways to fix this versatile dish!

I've made this before I went vegetarian and it was a great base recipe. You can pretty much add anything you want to it. I plan on making a chicken version (replacing beef with chicken, and beef broth with chicken broth) of this tonight for the family and vegan version for myself (just leaving out the chicken and using veggie broth and cream of celery soup).

I added celery and extra garlic and onion powder. I keep extra diced onion and bell peppers in my freezer and those worked well in this dish. I also added green onion. I made it with more rice as well...and adjusted the water accordingly. Its a lot of meat so I added 2 more cups of cooked brown rice, the 12 minute kind I buy from Sams and it is delicious!

I am leader of 4-H gourmet club in New Jersey and all the kids just loved it. The best part was it was gluten free and so everyone  was able to eat it. We followed the directions and it was a nice side dish with the gumbo.

This recipe is pretty good base recipe for Dirty Rice. At our house, we like our Dirty Rice spicy though, so I added paprika, cayenne, minced garlic, and a couple dashes of worchestershire sauce after reading the other reviews. Also, next time I make this, I'll brown the ground beef and then combine everything.

Great Mardi Gras dinner slathered in a generous seasoning of Frank's Red Hot. Used ground pork instead of beef, chicken bouillon in place of beef, and also added some smoked sausage. Will start dinner earlier next time so I can use a lot more bell pepper, but love the simplicity and relative quickness. Oh, used Emeril's Essence as seasoned salt, too. Great idea!

My husband and I didn't care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, and we both thought that it was very bland. We added Old Bay (after tasting it with just the ingredients that were called for) to make it a little more flavorful, but that didn't seem to help a lot. We won't be making this recipe again.

Very good recipe.  I knew I accomplished it when I asked my husband if looked dirty and he said "thats filthy!" :-)  I had to do a couple of substitutions like onion salt and old bay seasoning.  Because I did not measure it came out salty.  I blame that on the cook (me) not the recipe submitter.  :)  This will be made again!

This is like my favourite dish that I've made from allrecipes.com! So easy to make. My brother and dad really liked it. I thought it was very tasty. I didn't have beef bouillon granules, next time I'm sure that would add flavour. Nice to have a healthy and tasty dish!

Thank you for a wonderful and simple recipe. My husband always bought the box mix which I never really cared for. I have been saved from any more box mixes!  I made this as is the 1st time and it was great. I have another pot simmering now that I spiced up with cayenne, garlic, tomato boullion, and a can of kidney beans. I have used jasmine rice both times because that is what I have right now.  That is the true beauty of this recipe, you can easily play with it.

I didn't have any peppers left but added carrots,celery, corn and a can of diced tomatoes.  It was a little on the bland side but the fam liked it--one described it as comfort food.  I will make it again and will try to spice it up a little.  Super easy!

Delicious and Easy. Love the variety that the other commenters have suggested. It spiced up our boring usual meals.

Super simple and very tasty.  The peppers added flavor but didn't give it any kick (which is good--I usually can't eat peppers and didn't have problems at all with this dish).  There was a nice creaminess to it as well.  Rather than bouillon granules, I used 3 cubes and crumbled them a bit before adding.  This is a fast, tasty recipe I'll make again!

We just tried this tonight and even my 2 1/2 year old  who never eats rice ate it up. I'll omit the 1/2tsp salt next time as I thought it was too salty. I also used brown rice and chopped up some carrot to put in because I didn't have enough red pepper. Thanks for the recipe.

Mmmm! This recipe is now added to our permanent menu! I don't know why I haven't made it before...easy and tasty. I've recently switched to grass fed beef, so I used less meat ( @ .7 lb) and added pinto beans, a little corn and a can of Rotel. We ate this for 3 days (two dinners, one lunch) and it was great at each meal.

I didn't have red peppers.   i used only green peppers and the onion.   It was easy and this is a receipe I forgot about.  When I was a child, my mother prepared the dirty rice.  It also tastes better than the Zataran's  version in the box.  SORRY!!!:(

This was really good and really easy to make. I love the fact it is a one pot dish. It could have used just a bit more kick. I might add something for that next time.  Will probably be making this again soon.

Loved this dish! Really easy to taylor to our specific desires. I didn't have green nor red pepper, so I just added some corn and green beans, let simmer a few moments, then added about 1 cup cheddar cheese on top. Winner! So good, the KIDS asked me to make it again!

This recipe was a huge success at my house.  The hubby loved it!!  I made a few changes based on the reviews that I read:  I added a some garlic to the hambuger, replaced the peppers with a can of rotel tomatos and a can of corn, and replaced the bouillon and water with 2 cups of beef broth.  All in all, a very simple recipe that makes a satisfying meal.

So good!!:) My very first time making my own dirty rice and it is delicious thank you so much

tiny variations>
-i used basmati rice because, well, it's all I buy I love it :)
-added cayenne and did too much for my son so I added a bag of frozen corn from the microwave at the end to give it crunch and sweetness
-for the seasoned salt portion I used Tony's creole seasoning
-added a bunch of fresh minced garlic
- other than that I just worked with what I had, maybe my side notes will help someone like me who always reads tweaks n stuff in the reviews :)

other than that, you just opened my eyes to something I will make again and again for my family. It's so addictive! Thank you !!!!

Instead of cooking the rice in the mixture, I would cook it separately and add it in. The rice cooked unevenly and made this dish very starchy. At its foundation, this is a nice easy recipe, but I would just change that.

I debated between 3 and four stars. In order to cook the rice enough, the bell peppers became very slimy. The consistency was not pleasant. I also had to add three times the bouillon because it was a little bland. Almost gave it 4 stars because we did end up eating the remaining as leftovers a few days ago and that's a sign that it was at least good enough to eat again! I would definitely make a few changes next time if I do cook it again.

Yes, I added garlic and I used some other Creole spices; paprika, oregano,  cumin and a little crushed red pepper.  I also added some poblano pepper along with the bell pepper; it was delicious! Thank you for this recipe. I will definitely make it again...for all my friends.
P.S. Great short-cut using beef buillon to make the stock that the rice is cooked in!

Made the recipe slightly adjusting the spices (Mrs. Dash instead of season salt).  Turned out great, and the family likes it.  Will be putting in the dinner rotation.

This was very good, and I agree that you can pretty much add anything you want.  I added garlic and tomato and used brown rice.  It took longer to cook because of the rice however.  Very tasty!

Very good base recipe to make as is or tailor it to your taste.  Leftovers are good too.  I added a can of tomatoes and green chili's and a can of black beans for a little zip and color. My family really liked it.

I like this recipe for the base.  I did substitute the beef for ground turkey and used brown rice instead of white rice.  I also added cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper to give it a kick as it was pretty bland without it.

I used andouille sausage in place of the ground beef. It was easy and delicious and everyone loved it! Will make this a regular in our home!

Didn't have bell peppers, so it just made it with onions sauted in butter.  Added milk and cream of mushroom soup along with granulated garlic and seasoned salt.  Yum!

This was delicious and makes A LOT.
I added minced gizzards that I had booked for an hour, and cooked the rice in that stock.

Excellent recipe - I love how you drain the grease (a lot of people forget to do that) I used home-made chicken broth instead of the water/bouillon, used less salt and more spices, and added some garlic, tomatoes and beans - My boys love it too!

I really liked this recipe! It was perfect for a "beginner" like myself. My only change, was that I used half the amount of bell peppers(my peppers were massive). This is a great, easy recipe for families and hungry husbands. Thank you!

It's rare that I have every single ingredient to a recipe that allows me to follow the instructions to the letter (which is always my goal the first time I make something), but I did and therefore feel I can fairly rate this recipe as originally published. I found the results to be very bland--to the point of going back to re-read the recipe to make sure it didn't call for 1/2 tablespoons vs. teaspoons of salt, pepper & seasoned salt. Everything else about the dish worked well, and adding a teaspoon of cajun seasoning after tasting definitely helped. It's a good base recipe and I'd make it again, but with more focus on additional seasoning from the start.

Good basic recipe that can be tweaked with extra ingredients.  Perfect for a quick fix meal.  I used 1 pkg boil in the bag brown rice (just dumped the dry rice in there) and it turned out perfect.  I added a half bag of Baja style corn that had too many peppers and onions for our liking to eat plain.  It worked great in this recipe.  I also topped with 1/2 bag of shredded cheddar cheese.  I will be making again.

Good start but missing a lot.  I add ¬Ω pound of andouille Cajun sausage, 2 stalks of celery, a few dashes for Louisiana Hot Sauce, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon of dried parsley. I also saute the rice a little bit with the vegetables, before I add the liquid, to brown it a slight bit. A bay leaf is a nice addition and some thyme too, but not a must have, just adds lots of good flavor.

On the pro side, quick, easy and one skillet used.  On the con side, I should have added other ingredients (I included mushrooms) as some suggested. Will try again with either tomatoes, celery, corn, or beans.

I loved this and so did my husband who's not that into rice! I made a few modifications though, I added some chilli powder and oil and one chopped Serrano pepper to the ground beef mix when saut√©ing. I also added some spicy beef sausage cut up of course before adding rice. It made it spicy and full of flavor. LOVED it!

Pretty easy to prepare and cook, and it tastes delicious.  I accidentally added 2 TBSP's of the bouillon granules (my daughter was very demanding of my time), but I just added a little more pepper, water, and rice - to try to balance it out, and it turned out pretty good still.  I like that this is very healthy and tasty at the same time.  Thanks, Ann, for sharing.

Sooo good. Followed basic recipe idea. Also used condensed French onion soup (instead of bullion), a tablespoon or two of pickle juice, a little water and a glob of salsa for the liquid. Added diced carrots, frozen corn and frozen green beans. Used mixed rice instead of plain white. Skipped salts. Wow. Simple and delicious!

I'm finally getting around to reviewing this, but I've made it every other week for several months.  I made it as written originally, then adapted it to fit our tastes.  
The ease, adaptability, inexpensiveness, quick clean-up, and the enthusiasm my family shows for this dish are all contributing to the five star rating.
This is the kind of recipe I adore. It's great for busy families wanting fuss-free home-cooked meals. It's not trendy but it's filling and tastes great.
Thanks so much to the lovely lady (and her amazing mom) for this keeper of a recipe!

Make exact as outlined.  Used grass fed beef and basmati rice.  Added Braggs liquid aminos once it was plated.  Delicious and very easy!

Quick and easy recipe that tastes great! I did end up having to add about a cup more of water as my rice was still tough.

I took her concept and twisted it a bit,  I added orange, yellow, and red peppers, Italian hot sausage along with the ground beef, jalapeno peppers, and mushrooms.  I stir fried the rice mix all together with soy sauce and topped with scallions.  But it came out amazing.  My kids raced to the stove for seconds as did I...lol

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out kind of bland. I added some adobo, and it improved the taste. I personally didn't like it because it reminded me of mexican food and I don't like that kind of food, however my family did like it.
