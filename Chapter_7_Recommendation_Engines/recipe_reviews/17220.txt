The flavor for these burritos was excellent, however, with no sauce to go with them, they were very dry.  Next time I will use a salsa verde to lay in the bottom of the pan and on top of the burritos. Also, I used minute rice with no problem (no need to let it simmer longer with the picante sauce). Thanks!

Yeah this was a great recipe, taken practically word for word from Taste of Home - I have it in my 1997 Taste of Home yearbook.  It calls for 1/3 c scallions instead of the 1/2 cup here.  

In any event - this is a great recipe.  The prep time is a little long but I freeze leftovers individually and it's a treat to have them waiting.  The amount of chicken can be changed - it really doesn't affect the flavor.  I've added rinsed black beans to the mix as well.

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars since I think there should be some sort of sauce poured over the burritos before baking. I did not do this when making my first batch and the cheese dried out.  However, after pouring some taco sauce & sour cream over the top they were still delicious!  I only used 1/2 of the chicken/rice mix and froze the other 1/2 to use another day. This one is a keeper!

yummy and as for all those that commented about needing a sauce over-maybe you should be making enchiladas instead!! Thats not how burritos are traditionally.

NICE TWIST TO BURRITOS! We really liked these alot! Other than adding a dash of cumin while cooking the chicken (and leaving it in small cubes oppossed to shredding the chicken) - I didn't change a thing! I love being pleasantly surprised and these sure turned my head! Served with some lettuce and green bell peppers - these babies were a hit! Thanks Heidi!

This was very good.. I was searching for a recipe to utilize my leftovers from the past couple of days and this was it. I had leftover chicken, broth, and spanish rice and salsa so making this was a super quick and super easy. I didn't have green onion or garlic so I used a yellow onion and garlic powder and it still turned out really good. 

In order to make this an easily prepared meal I suggest planing a few meals where you will have all the ingredients leftover. It'll make throwing these together much easier.. I'm not sure I would have made this otherwise.

Tasty and filling but bland. It could have been the brand of picante sauce I used. Next time, I'll know to add some spices, maybe some of my homemade taco seasoning and some fresh cilantro. I think this would be an excellent base for enchiladas, just adding a good enchilada sauce in the pan and over the top and sprinkle with monterey jack? I might do that next time.

SOOOO GOOD!!!  I made my own salsa though but this woulda been good with the jarred stuff as well.  That's the only change I made.  My husband took extra leftovers to work and the guy he gave half to want's the recipe!  Anyway thanks!

This was very easy and tasty. I had in my fridge leftover turkey breast seasoned with black pepper, garlic salt and dill weed as well as cooked brown rice. So I decided to use them for this rec. I used regular onion, no garlic (had it on turkey). After I sauteed onions I added turkey breast, rice, can of pinto beans and fresh salsa (all I had),forgot olives and did not need to use chicken stock. When heated through I spooned about 1 cup of the mixture on tortillas, sprinkled with mozzarella, jalapenos for hubby and rolled up. I transfered stuffed tortillas to my pan and put swiss cheese on top. Baked for 15 min on 350F. It is just two of us and so we had just perfect size lunch. I still have some leftover turkey/rice mixture which I will use tommorow to make another buritto. This way it is fresh baked. This rec is so versatile. You can adjust it according to what you have in fridge. It is quick and delicious.

This recipe was very good.  Everyone in 
my family loved it.  It is pretty easy
to put together but a little bit of time
consuming because of cooking the rice
and having cooked chicken too.
I'm glad I found this recipe.  I'm going
to make it again when I have visitors.

This was a great recipe.  My husband went nuts.  We also made our own tortillas for it as well (even better).  Instead of chili powder I used a serrano pepper.

Husband love this, and asked for this twice in one week.

Add a can of black beans drained.  (Kuner's Jalapeno Black Beans.  I cut the cheese down, and didn't notice.  Cuts the fat .

Made a vegetarian version of this yesterday for Cinco de Mayo. I used 2 pkgs. of Quorn brand "chicken tenders" ( a vegetarian chicken substitute made mostly of mushrooms - though you'd never know. Can be found in the freezer section of health food stores or some supermarkets.) I also used fresh mushrooms, sauted with onion (not green onion as called for), red peppers, jalapeno cheddar, extra chili powder, added some cumin, cilantro, used more picante sauce than called for, and as per other reviews about dryness , used salsa verde to cover burritos. I used whole wheat tortillas. Next time I will use brown rice. Great base recipe, but needs to be "tweaked" a little. Served them with black bean and corn salad, with guacamole on the side.

When I initially read the ingredients, I thought, "OK, this sounds pretty good." But we loved these burritos! The flavor was really excellent! As suggested by other reviewers, I added some other salsa to the bottom of my pan before baking. I also added a bit more chili powder. I had some of the mixture left over and took it camping with us, where I filled the tortillas and warmed them up by using a little olive oil in a skillet and browning the burritos on both sides. They were yummy!! Next time I'm going to add a can or two of green chilies for even more "oomph." This one's a keeper!

I don't know why I've never reviewed this. We make them all the time. I like to use leftover shredded chicken from a whole chicken I put in crock pot. Before covering with cheese and sauce, I throw burritos on George Foreman grill for a crispy tortilla. Mmmm

We loved this!  I made this into smothered burritos; traditional in this area.  After rolling the burritos, I brushed them with a little olive oil to crisp them up a bit.  Baked without the cheese, then to serve, poured green chili over, topped with shredded jack cheese, sliced black olives, chopped tomatoes and lettuce plus some sour cream.  So dang good!  Thanks!

My family really loved these Burritos. I'm glad because I was worried. But fear no more. I made 2 separate recipes, 1 chicken and 1 shredded beef, and accomendating the broth for both with the each chicken and beef, then followed to a T. The recipe was thick, and that's where I worried.. But as my family stated, it was wonderful. I used Low Carb Whole Wheat Tortillas in place of regular white tortillas. But will say, that the chicken and beef mixes made way more then 10 burritos. I made 9 of each to fit in a lasagna pan to cook at once and I still had more then 1/2 of mix left over on each batch. Each batch was flavorful and tender. I'm please with the way this recipe turned out and am pleased that I was able to adapt it to shredded beef.  Thank you.

Really good!! I used minute rice instead of long grain. Boiled the chicken broth thn added the rice and let it set for 5 minutes, after that I turned the burner back on and added the salsa let the salsa juices absorb into the rice. I added cumin to the chicken as well as the chili powder, chopped the olives and added the shredded cheese. After that I just mixed everything together. After rolling up the burritos I sprayed some cooking spray ontop the tortillas so they'd harden a bit. After they turned golden brown I took the burritos out and added more salsa and cheese. Amazing!  I think next time I'll fry them to see how they turned out. Thanks for the recipe!

A plump and hearty burrito.  I wasn't real fond of these at first, but they seasoned up overnight and made a great grab 'n go lunch.  Just zapped in micro and ate like a regular sandwich.  Not messy at all!

Very yummy but next time I will add picante sauce or taco sauce on top of the burritos after putting them in the 9x13 dish. Also wanted to add that I think this would be a great make ahead dish. Assemble the burritos then refrigerate. Take out of fridge 30 mins before cooking and top w/ picante sauce & cheese.

Very tasty burritos! They taste just like the ones served in restaurants down south! I added some cumin to the mix too. I made fresh pico de gallo to go with it and I wasn't disappointed, the flavors go well together. I wouldn't add a sauce like the other reviews suggest either, because then it is an enchilada, not a burrito.

I very rarely give 5 stars for anything be it food or otherwise. However I just finished one and it is the made at home burrito that I've been looking for. Added maybe a tablespoon of chipotle pepper as I was cooking the chicken which I don't believe did anything. However what I did add that added meat (pun intended) to the burrito was two cups of black beans as well as using brown rice rather than white rice. Ended up using 1/2 cup of the mixture per burrito which was more than enough. I used three chicken breasts, sliced thin, sauteed, and then put in food processor for 2 seconds to "shred" the chicken. Think anything more would be a puree of chicken. :-(  After out of the oven, put salsa over it and a small amount of "healthy" sour cream. Life is good. Next thing to do, as others have commented, is to find a reasonable sauce recipe so I can have these wet.

If you use the hot pace picante sauce these are awesome, I don't think they would have been that good without it!! I boiled two chicken breast seasoned with salt, pepper, chicken bouillon granules and garlic and onion powder and shredded it. I sauteed a small white onion and minced garlic then added the shredded chicken and the picante sauce. I used a cup of instant white rice once that was done "cooking" I added the rest of the picante sauce and added it to the chicken mixture. I only had four whole wheat flour tortillas. The chicken rice mixture is also good with tortilla chips. I would make these again!! Thanks, but the hot picante sauce is a must, atleast if you like things spicy!!!

UPDATE: MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN CRAVING BURRITOS AND SINCE I'M ON A MISSION TO GIVE RECIPES I INITIALLY AWARDED A MEDIOCRE REVIEW A SECOND CHANCE, I DECIDED TO GIVE THESE ANOTHER WHIRL. BOY AM I GLAD I DID!!! THE KEY (AT LEAST FOR ME) WAS USING HOT PICANTE SAUCE AND MICROWAVING MY TORTILLAS UNTIL THEY WERE SOFT AND PLIABLE. NOT ONLY DID THIS ADD TREMENDOUS FLAVOR, IT KEPT MY BURRITOS MOIST DURING BAKING (WITHOUT SAUCE, BTW) AND MADE THEM MUCH EASIER TO WORK WITH (WHEN ROLLING)! THESE TWO CHANGES MADE A CONVERT OUT OF ME! :) These were alright. Although quite filling, these were BLAND. I even used Pace brand picante sauce, co-jack cheese (all I had) and a store-bought rotisserie chicken. The lack of sauce made these very dry (but sauce would make these enchiladas, not burritos...). I spread a bit of sauce on the bottom of my baking dish, but decided to forgo covering my burritos with it, thinking the cheese would keep them moist. Not so much. :( My only other changes were to omit the olives called for (my fiance and I both dislike them) and use Minute Rice, adding only 1/2 cup broth as per the package directions. I halved this for the two of us, but ended up filling only four tortillas (all I could fit in my 9 x 13-inch baking dish), saving the remaining filling for another time. CHEFCLAUDE's refried beans, tortilla chips, pico de gallo and mojitos rounded out our Mexican-themed meal. Thanks for sharing, IDIEHMARIE77. :-)

Delicious. I thought I had picante sauce, but turns out it was enchilada sauce, so I used that instead and it worked very well. Added a few more seasoning and spread some salsa verde on top of the burritos before topping with the cheese and baking. Very tasty and fillling. Thank you!

Really enjoyed it.  Only difference was instead of picante sauce, I just blended raw jalapeno with whole canned tomatoes and added that.

My husband and my son love these.  The recipe makes quite a few burritos so they get to have them for a couple of days and believe me they don't mind.  They ask me to make these at least once if not twice a month.

I sometime substitute Quinoa for the rice and it gives it a little bit of a nutty flavor.  Otherwise this recipe is really great.

These burritos were restaurant quality. I always am trying to make as good of food as we receive in american-mexican restaurants. This recipe has achieved that status. It was a lot of work to get these to the dinner table, but once we tasted them, it was worth all the time and effort. I added some more chix broth to make the chix not so dry. I will make this again.

Very delicious! Changed it up a little bit, I put the chicken breasts in a crock pot with the chicken broth and spices and let cook all day then shredded. I cooked the rice according to the directions on the box, and just added the salsa into the broth mixture. I put refried beans down first, then the shredded chicken, a little rice, sprinkled cheese and more salsa, baked in oven.

Very good - I added fresh cilantro, crushed red peppers and used mexican rice instead of  long grain rice because that is what I had on hand. I did put a little salsa on the bottom of the baking dish before adding the burritos so they wouldn't stick.  Will make again.

We enjoyed this dish. My husband is big on Mexican Food and liked this very much. I did add some cumin to the chicken mixture with the chili powder. I was concerned about the tortillas drying out, but we actually liked the crunch of the tortillas. I topped the burritos with a bit of picante sauce, chopped avocado, sour cream and chopped cilantro before serving. Will make again.

Awesome for our Cinco De Mayo Dinner! I boiled the chicken in broth,garlic and chili powder. Then drained the broth and used it to mix in rice and cook chicken. Added way more flavor!!! I added a little red taco sauce with Pace salsa to the chicken mixture and used yellow onion instead. I also layered cheese, green taco sauce and a little more cheese on the top. Add a Corona and lime...perfect = )

This was ok - not a hit with my family, but they're very "meat and potatos".  I made exactly as directed, except I added a can of rinsed black beans, but it was a little too dry for my taste.  Flavor and textures were good tho.  I probably won't make again, just because of my picky family.

Very yummy!  My only complaint was that the burritos were a little dry, as others said.  We put salsa and sour cream, as well as some shredded lettuce on top and that helped with the dryness.  In the future I may cover them with enchilada sauce before baking.  We also didn't use the olives and used green chiles instead...and used salsa instead of picante sauce.  A keeper =)

Wow!  Everyone LOVED these! I poached my chicken in chicken stock, oregano, salt and pepper, and diced the meat instead of shredding.  I also put a small amount of enchilada sauce on top of the burritos before adding the cheese.  I've never used jarred salsa in a sauce, but I was pleasantly surprised with the result.  Will definitely make again.

This was great and pretty eay to fix.  Actually had everything on hand.  Used boneless chicken thighs, to get rid of them.  Did cut the chili powder in half, we don't do well with really spicy food.  But this one is a keeper and I will make this again, especially for family get togethers.

My boys loved this recipe. I did use one cup of mozzarella and two cups cheddar. I had leftovers and froze for another night. Worked out perfect. Just warmed in the microwave rolled in shells and baked at 375 for 12minutes. Will make again.

This is great!!  I added two large green jalapenos and green peppers.  No green onions or olives.  I also put cumin on the chicken as I cooked it.  This is very filling and fed both of my boys, my husband, and myself plus leftovers.  I recommend that you try this one.

When serving this meal, I felt like I was a chef in a restaurant!  The burritos were excellent and serve many people.  Rather than 6 servings, I think the recipes serves 6 hungry people!

Turned out pretty bland and dry, but otherwise filling. Probably needs a sauce poured over burritos before baking, or to leave out baking altogether.

This is a family favorite that I make regularly. I make it exactly as written with an addition of adding a small amount of salsa on the burrito before rolling it up. The extra salsa adds the right amount of moisture.

Use Rotisserie Chicken precooked from the store. Each chicken provides approx. 4 cups of shredded chicken. I buy and use two. Recipe is great as is but I also like to use it as a base for what I have in my pantry.  It is easy to adjust based on ingredients you have or choose to use. Depending on how much chicken used , adjust spices and salsa accordingly.  Prior to baking, brush with olive oil for crispness.  My family also like to make wet burritos. I on the other hand think you should just eat an enchilada if you want wet. Pre made burrito can be made a day in advance. Pre baked burrito can be frozen and baked at a later date. Give about 1/2 hour to cook.

Very delicious. This one is a keeper for sure. 
Next time I make it I'm going to use my favorite blackened seasoning I got from a Guy Fieri recipe and use homemade salsa. Absolutely delicious recipe.  Thank you for sharing it.

These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, and the flavor of these was very good (my hubby and I didn't think they were bland, as some reviewers have mentioned). The only thing different that I did was turn them into smothered burritos. I covered them with a bit of queso and salsa before baking, and served them topped with sour cream and jalapenos. Yummy!

I made these using a rotisserie chicken.  The flavor was excellent. I served with a corn and bean salsa. We decided that I should try mixing the salsa in with the chicken and rice adding color and texture.  The second time I made it I used leftover steak cut into thin strips.  I added the corn and bean salsa and it was great.  One day I will try it with pork!  The leftovers freeze well (all made up!) and we have enjoyed just rolling the filling mixture into a burrito and giving it a quick shot in the microwave. Lots of possibilities!!!

Really good! I subbed a half-can of green chilies for the black olives because my kids would balk at  the olives. The chilies gave it a bit more zing, too. I also added a little salt at various stages as I found the chicken mixture and the rice both a little bland on their own. 

Overall I'd definitely make it again. It's a pretty easy process and everyone thought the burritos  were  tasty!

It is rather bland. The recipe makes 12  ... I think one is enough. I still had to add salt and pepper and some chipotle peppers to give it enough flavor.  Also added bell peppers and put salsa verde on the bottom of the pan and on top of the burritos.  After all those changes I liked it, but really it's not worth it.

This was the best homemade burrito I've made yet.   I used picante sauce with a medium hotness and it was perfect.  Also, when I cooked the chicken, I kept the juices to replace the broth.   Because I was lazy and didn't measure the juices, I ended up with  a runny mixture.  Not to worry...I was able to spoon out some of the delicious juice to pour over the tops of the burritos (since so many commented on how dry it was).   I didn't find them dry in the least and found them to be full of flavor .  I'll be making these often!

Great recipe! To add moisture and flavor, I use Spanish rice with canned diced tomatoes instead of plain rice. I boiled chicken breasts, but a rotisserie chicken would also be a good selection.

Delicious!  I didn't have all the necessary ingredients, so I substituted green onions for dried shallots and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and also used taco seasoning instead of chili powder.  I can only imagine it would have been that much better if I had gone by the recipe.  Helpful tip:  An easy way to prepare the chicken is to put a whole chicken in the crockpot before work.  When you get home it is already falling off the bone and easy to shred, and provides you with the broth as well. :)

We love these.  I have a small family, but I make a big batch on purpose.  I individually wrap and freeze uncooked excess burritos.  They can be baked frozen about 15-20 minutes per side to save time on busy nights.

Tasty and quick to put together. I agree with some other reviewers that the shortfall is that this is a dry burrito and I think if there is some sort of sauce or green chili to go with, it would be great. Overall very tasty filling for the burrito still.

Delicious!  Kind of a lot of work though, so better to make parts of it ahead.  I used minute rice but it didn't soak up all the broth.  Use less chicken broth or add more rice.  Can also add other veggies like pepper, corn, etc to the filling.

The chicken mixture was EXCELLENT. They didn't come out of the oven baked quite like I was thinking they would, but maybe if I had used some more cheese or some sort of sauce, they would have looked better. Still tasted amazing, though.

This was a hit at my house. I cooked 4 chicken breasts instead of 7 cups of shredded chicken. It fed 5 of us with left overs. I think I will add some salt and pepper next time to add a little more flavor.

Used medium picante sauce and left out the olives (not a fan).  This was tremendous!  I used some leftover BBQ chicken in the fridge, and it added a nice smokey flavor to the burritos.  Great dish!  We'll have this again.

This burrito is AWESOME! I substituted the chili powder with pico de gallo. I sprinkled more than enough and gave it a good kick to it.

This got better the longer the flavors had to mingle. The night I made this, I wasn't so impressed. When I made a burrito the next day it was much much better. This was quick though, and a great use of leftovers. Thanks!

I wanted to like these so much! They were just super heavy and tasted much like the spanish rice from a box with chicken thrown in. They weren't bad, I would make them again if the husband liked them, but even he thought they were a little too heavy.

Very good basic recipe.  I made it exactly as the ingredients are listed, but I didn't bake it.  I knew I would have leftovers and didn't want soggy tortillas the next day, so I just made up the burritos that I needed and popped them in the microwave for 30 seconds each to warm the tortillas.  Worked out great.

I really liked this, even without the olives and half the cheese and chicken. But next time if I reduce the chicken I will also cut the rice in half. This was good in burritos and also by itself as a seasoned rice dish.

YUM!  This recipe makes a ton so it would be great to serve for a party.  I served mine with a side of cornbread pudding and chips with salsa.

very very good. i did change the recipe a bit. added some bell peppers and used a regular onion instead of a green onion. i also took the suggestion from another reviewer and added some drained black beans. the smell was enticing and the burritos were fabulous. i made some with a sauce and one pan without a sauce, both were good and the non sauce wasn't dry; just make sure you put the cheese on top of the burrito and you're good to go!

I make these burritos a lot.  The first time I used a pre cooked seasoned chicken from the grocery store.  The burritos were good, but a little too salty.  I boil the chicken (without seasoning) and cut it up for the mixture.  These burritos are my favorite.

My new chicken burrito recipe!! I had made yellow sauce and used it instead of the picante.  And so I added one fresh, minced serrano but could have added more.  I also added extra garlic, pinto beans and bell peppers.  For the shredded chicken, I marinaded breasts in 1/4c soy sauce, 3 minced garlic cloves, 4t sugar, 1T sherry, 1t Hoisin.  After marinading, tossed the liquid and baked the chicken for 40 minutes at 350.  This made fantastic , moist chicken that I then shredded.  Amazing and worth the effort.  Makes a lot so I froze some.
