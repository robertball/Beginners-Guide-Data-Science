Halved the recipe. I didn't have horseradish mustard but I did have mustard and horseradish so for the amount called for I used half horseradish and half a combo of yellow & Dijon mustard. I forgot the pepper. It taste fine, very much like regular balsamic vinaigrette but with a little kick from the horseradish and 'body' from the mustards.

Very nice! I used white balsamic vinegar and 1/2 the horseradish mustard b/c I didn't want it to be too overpowering. Also, I added a bit of honey to add a touch of sweetness. Simple and tasty! Thanks for sharing. :)
