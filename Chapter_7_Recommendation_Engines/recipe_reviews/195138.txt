My husband who is a 5 star chef loved this dish. It is helpful to place the drippings in a small bowl for serving. It makes it look like you also made a sauce!

Wow, these were delicious. I read reviews and doubled the sauce, adding a tiny amount of red pepper flakes and about 1 tsp. of sugar-free syrup. They were so moist, tender, and flavorful. Will be making these often. Served with pierogies and mixed veggies.

This is a pretty tasty recipe.  Unfortunately, I overcooked the pork but the flavor was still there.  I plan to make again but keep in the pan less than I did this time.  The pan drippings are delicious.  I cooked with egg noodles and the pan dressing tasted really good over the noodles.  Don't drown them in the drippings though.  I took the advice to use the red pepper flakes and double the sugar and honey, both good ideas.  Will make again and hopefully not overcook the pork this time!

Quick, easy - awesome.  Keep the extra glaze it's good to stir a little on to rice.

Kudos! This recipe was awesome! I whipped this up in 2 seconds & the whole family enjoyed it. The pork chops turned out just slightly sweet & with the hint of fresh cracked pepper, it gave it a nice twist. I was reading the reviews & I might just try this glaze with chicken. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very good.  This was my first time making pork chops.  I think I over cooked them a little, but the taste was wonderful.  My son even ate them (even though he thought it was chicken...he's 3) and my husband ate 2 pork chops. Will definitely serve again!

I wasn't wild over this one. I doubled the sauce like many suggested and added some red pepper flakes. Served it over egg noodles. I felt like I was eating egg noodles with maple syrup, gross. My husband liked the sauce on the pork chops (we used boneless by the way, 14 minutes on one side, 12 on the other, perfect) but neither of us liked it on the egg noodles.

This was a family hit the first time I made it!  I followed the recipe exactly -- except I added a little bit of garlic to the mixture.  Gave it a subtle kick!  I think this sauce would go well with chicken too.

My husband loved this.  I do not eat any meat (because it does not agree with me.)  I added some dijon mustard to the glaze.  Easy and fast.  Have fun with this!!

These were heavenly! Perfectly sweetened, but not too over-the-top. I didn't quite get the coloring I was going for, but it's about how it tastes more than how it looks. Fantastic!

I really loved this recipe. I read all the reviews before cooking and made a game plan, and I tweeked it using those reviews. 1. I brwoned the chops in 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter, with some minced garlic in the pain. 2. I left the chops in the pain, poured 1/2 the sauce over (I tripled the sauce recipe added crushed red peper, like a 1/2 tsp.)then baked then 10 min. (I use thinner chops) 3. I turnered them over and poured the remaining sauce over the chops. 4. I then drizzled, lightly, a little soy sauce ovr each chop and put it back in the oven for 10 minutes, then removed and served after I let it rest for a few minutes. I served it with rice and green beans and put the extra sauce in a dish for pouring over the rice and more over my chops, I like alot of sauce! My husband loved it as did I. The crushed red pepper gave it just the right kick. The hint of soy was perfect! We will do this again!! PS we brine our chops before we cook them. That way they don't dry out. (4 cups water to  Tbls of Salt for 2 hours).

This is a big hit with my children.  These honey chops are a wonderful change from the normal baked chops.  I always spoon more of the honey glaze over the chops before I serve them.  Great recipe!

Just finished enjoying this Yummy Yummy dish. I made 3 times the brown sugar/honey mixture and added 1 heaping tablespoon dijon mustard and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Husband said 5 stars and would I make it again soon. So easy and so so good, thanks for the recipe.

Very simple and delicious recipe!  This is the second time I've made it and it turned out great each time.  I baked it for 14 minutes before turning and then 12 minutes the second time and it came out perfectly.  We've added it to our regular rotation.

I made this the other day for my friends and it came out very good. The only comment I got was that it was kinda tangy with the black pepper. My friends raved about it though and ate all 8 of them within an hour. So easy to do!

Definitely double the glaze! I only had 3 chops and the ingredients called for just barely covered those.  The chops, though seasoned before and after baking, still came out a little too dry. Next time I'll top with cheese and maybe throw in some buttered egg noodles and mixed veggies to round out the meal, then use the glaze as a sauce.

This was an awesome recipe for our family. I did double the portions, which does create more juice for the pork so that it doesn't get too dry.  My husband loves it so much that we try to make this recipe once a month!!!

The pork came out nice and juicy; the ingredients sound like an odd mix but they came out wonderful, even to someone like me who normally hates pepper!

Very very good!  I recommend to double the sauce.  I added maple syrup and, I sautéed a clove of sliced garlic after my pork was browned, and I added walnuts to the pan and tossed them with the sauce.  Excellent main course, my family loved them.  I kept the temp and 15mins on each side because I used thick boneless pork shoulder cut (Almost 1 inch thick.) A+++

These pork chops were mediocre to say the least.  I followed the recipes exactly other than doubling the "glaze" as so many reviewers suggested.  I was left feeling disappointed that I wasted thick, organic pork chops on this recipe.  I will not be making this again.

I'm only giving this a 4 because I'm just not a fan of baked pork chops. However, for a baked pork chop, this was pretty darn good. A little on the plain side. Next time I will make more glaze, but it was SO easy and yummy. Thanks!

This is a 5 star in my book because 1) I will always have the ingredients on hand (when I buy pork chops), 2) it is super simple, 3) it is quick, 4) the sauce it makes is delicious.

These pork chops were GREAT!!!! My husband loved them. We're hispanic so I added some Adobo and sazon instead of just salt and pepper. I also doubled up on the honey and brown sugar. I did use the drippings on the rice (very good). I am trying a new recipe once a week but I can't wait to do this on again. Thanks for the recipes.

Really enjoyed this simple combination of ingredients!  The honey and brown sugar produced a nice, thick sauce for the chops and, surprisingly, was not too sweet.

This was fantastic! And super easy, as I was running late with dinner. The drippings were a treat over the steamed rice I served this with, alongside sweet corn & green beans. My kids, who can be quite harsh critics, loved it.

Hubby and I thought these were good.  Kids, not so much.  They thought they were too sweet--honestly, children, I'm not sure how to please you.  I think I'll look for a glaze with a deeper sweetness if that makes sense.  Maybe a few more flavor notes like maple or cranberry, instead of just sugar and honey.  I used boneless chops and just cooked them a little shorter time.  As with any pork, don't overcook or it will be dry and tough!

This dish went very well with my famous spaghetti! However, next time I am definately purchasing better quality chops as mine were poorly cut. However, the taste was quite delicious and easy to make. Thanks again!

This was pretty good. My husband loved it which is what bumps it up to four starts for me.  I should have read the comments to know to double the honey/brown sugar glaze for more juice.  I was in a hurry and didn't do that.  We'll eat this again.

I've made this several times now and it is so yummy. Like many other reviews, I've doubled the honey/sugar.  I ran out of time last night and did it a little differently. I sprinkled salt, pepper and smoked paprika on both sides of the chops and cooked them in a skillet with a bit of canola oil on the stove (med low for about 25 minutes) vs in the oven.  When there was no pink left in them, I did the honey and sugar.  The smoked paprika added a new twist to it and it was super yum too! 
Thanks for a great recipe. :)

This was delicious, I added crushed red pepper and thyme to the pork chops when I browned them, and I added garlic 1 tbsp to the glaze - end result was absolutely phenomenal.  Even my picky eater devoured it :-)

Turned out better than I expected. I added chilly flakes as suggested and also because I like it a little spicy, not a mistake at all! I had a can of orange mandarin on hand and added to the sauce, gave it a little tangy flavor to balance the sweetness of the honey. Overall, we loved it, my husband asked for more, will certainly make it again soon.

This recipe was okay. The sauce was tasty but very thin and didn't soak into the meat very well. I also tried the red pepper flakes, as suggested, and didn't care for the added heat at all. It was just confusing with the sweetness of the pork and honey. Probably wouldn't make this again.

I did not expect this to be as good as it was. I added a little worshchestshire sauce and a few red pepper flakes.  Was very good, s&p balance out the sweetness nicely.

I used pork shoulder and cut it in strips instead of steaks so it could be served over rice. It was and really is quite amazing. I do pre-season the meat with this Bourbon and brown sugar seasoning which makes it that much better. It is a quick meal for it to be so tender. It is always a hit when I make it!!

This dish was simple enough that even I could do it well (I can't make Jell-O, so that says a lot).  To keep my mess somewhat contained, I finished the oven portion in a toaster oven, using an aluminum foil-lined pan which made clean up of the honey/sugar mixture a snap.

Wow! We really enjoyed this. I had a beautiful pork loin roast that cut into eight nice chops. I used olive oil instead of the spray. I doubled the recipe for the "glaze". To that I added 3 tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce, 1tablespoon of unsweetened butter and 2 dashes of cinnamon. After placing browned chops in my 9x13, I deflated my skillet with 3/4 cup of beef stock ( to balance out the sweet). To that I added the honey mixture and simmered for maybe 3 minutes. I poured that over my browned chops and baked for 15 minutes with a foil cover. These were great with mashed potatoes!

Love that the recipe is easy to put together - had all of the ingredients and it doesn't take too much time. However, I did find it a little too sweet.  I did make 1-1/2 times the sauce and added the red pepper flakes.

Mine came out perfect :) very moist, tasteful, the my family loved them.  My youngest child, age 4, she ate a whole pork chop and my older son, age 5 he ate a whole one too.  I will be making them again. I did add Dejohn mustard to mine and double the ingredients.

A great recipe, and one I will make again. I consciously avoid all dealings with microwaves and so just spread the brown sugar and honey separately. Otherwise, I marinated the pork in cider vinegar and garlic powder for a while beforehand, and seasoned it with cinnamon in addition to the salt and pepper before browning. Following other reviewers' suggestions of putting the drippings in a dish for dipping like an au jus was a no doubt excellent improvement as well. And might I suggest deglazing the browning pan with applesauce and bourbon?

The flavor was great, but we ended up with really dry pork chops.  This may be my fault, so I'll update the review if I have better results next time.  I used boneless pork chops and followed the suggestion of another reviewer, cooking 14 minutes on the first side and 12 on the second, but that was way too long!  I think I may try it another time with cooking 10 minutes on each side and see if we can get a juicier pork chop.

This recipe was a good one. However, for mine & my hubby's taste, it was far too sweet. If you like things sweet, it's great. Our chops stayed moist and the sauce texture was good. We doubled the recipe as well for the sauce so that made there be plenty. Overall, pretty good. Just a matter of preference on sweetness.

Delightful!  And SO easy!  Added a bit of maple syrup and hot pepper flakes when i turned the chops in the oven.  Drippings were AWESOME!  Served with fresh carrots and mashed potatoes and a good bottle of Sauv. Blanc.

Really good for a quick weekday meal.  I LOVE how the recipe didn't call for browning the chops in oil or butter.  I added garlic powder, italian seasoning and cayene to each side while it browned and doubled the sauce.  Will make again.

These turned out really well.   I used boneless pork loin chops (as that's what I had) and then substitued maple syrup for the honey.  I also added two cloves of garlic and some hot pepper flakes for extra kick.  Thanks for the inspiration -- loved it!
