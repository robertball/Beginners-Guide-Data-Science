Great Recipe!! My mom actually makes this same dish every Thanksgiving except that she puts sliced almonds on top instead of breadcrumbs. I prefer the almonds but the breadcrumbs are good as well.  If you do use almonds, make sure to cover.

Pretty good,  not bad considering it took me 5 minutes to put this together. I chose this recipe as a vegetable side dish because I was so very low on ingredients before grocery shopping day, and I was trying to use up items I had in the pantry. Only 2 changes I made was I used regular cut green beans, not the French style, and I also topped this with French fried onions, because we were out of the crackers. I baked this for 45 minutes but I did loosely cover with foil the last 20 minutes so the topping didn't get too brown. Thanks for sharing a simple yet tasty quick side :)

I was surprised at how much my family liked this dish. Usually I avoid cooking with canned soups but needed something quick to throw together. Had everything on hand...but used 2 cans of cut green beans instead of the gr. bean and corn as written. No need to put so much butter on top, I sprinkled the cracker crumbs and just dotted the top with about 2 tablespoons of butter. Great stuff!

I did not like this at all, in taste or appearance. None of the three people I served it to would eat it either, and one of them will eat just about anything. It got tossed out unfortunately. I think the problem was that with both the canned vegetables and then the soup, all that could be tasted was salt!  And, even though I chopped the onions very small, after the recommended cooking time they were still crunchy! And, the ingredients did not seem to transform themselves into anything more than they really were, vegetables mixed in sour cream and cheese.  The only thing I did different was use regular square crackers.  This recipe does have quite a few high ratings.  I am not sure what I did wrong or if it is mainly my taste buds when it comes to canned vegetables and sour cream? I really wanted to like this.

Made a few minor changes;cream of mush soup and french fried onions. I loved it and thought it was better than the classic green bean casserole.

Simple to make and absolutely delicious.  My family and friends raved about it.  Recommend serving it with simple main dishes, such as meat or roasted chicken.  It's very rich.

I wanted a different green bean casserole for Christmas and this was it! What a hit! Everyone loved it! I made a few changes as I used condensed Cream of Mushroom and Roasted Garlic soup plus I used the Southwest whole kernel corn in the can. The taste was wonderful!

I made this and took it to a dinner party tonight and, honestly, it was the hit of the evening.  There is not one thing I would change about it.  It's definitely a keeper!

Yummy, and easy and everyone loved it! I used the almonds and covered the dish to heat as suggested. I think next time I will toast the almonds first to bring up their flavor and then heat covered to prevent them from burning. This was a hit.

This has been a go-to recipe of mine for years.  It's wonderful and everyone raves about it.  I am making it for Thanksgiving right now.  The only difference is I always use white shoe-peg corn.  I think it compliments the green beans better.  Also, be sure and drain the beans and corn really well and if doubling cook for at least an hour.  You can't hardly over cook this.  If it's undercooked and watery it's not good.

Delicious and new family favorite! I did make minor adjustments.
1st- I didn't have cheedar cheese on hand i substituted mexian blend
2nd- I used 2 cans of french green beans rather than 1.
3rd- I omited onion and used cream of onion soup rather than cream of celery since this is what i had on hand.
4th- I mixed all ingred at once (minus crackers & butter) then topped with crackers & butter.

We actually cover this dish with aluminum foil and wait until the soup mixture is at a good bubble. We then remove the foil and let the crackers brown. This helps cook the onions(we use shallots)so they are not crunchy. But then we also put the soup mix on the bottom with the veggies on top. Substitute frozen(well thawed and drained)french cut green beans. And shoepeg corn if you can find it.

My Mom always made a great green bean casserole but I was unable to get the recipe before she passed away. This is very similar. I remember she used Sharp Cheddar cheese and a lot more of it because I was the designated grater. She insisted on Sharp Cheddar...she wouldn't make it with just Cheddar. There were no onions. There were 2 cans of French style green beans rather than one. I also think she used crushed Corn Flakes on top, too. I miss her green bean casserole so I am going to try this but with the changes that I definitely remember from hers. I'll do a test run before the holidays. Glad to have at least found a base recipe for this. Thanks. (Edit: She drained the vegetables and just mixed it all together. There were no layers.)

Easy Peasy. My family prefers this recipe for green bean casserole with the added corn. Makes it a bit sweeter for their taste. Reheats well and great for leftovers.

My entire family LOVES this cassole!  Using the French cut green beans makes it more interesting, due to the cut.  I usually add a little more sour cream and cheese, but only use 1/2 of the crumb mixture on the top.
