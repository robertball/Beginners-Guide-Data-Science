Words can not even describe how Delicious this burger is. We are a burger and fries loving family and finding a good mushroom and swiss burger is a task all on its own! This was perfect and the search has ended for us! The burger was juicy, the herbed mayo was a pleasant surprise. Thank you for this recipe!

I had never used Herbs de Provence in a burger or soy sauce with my mushrooms and I loved it! I used Portabella Mushrooms and didn't change anything else. Great burger and delicious buns.

Who doesn’t love bacon and cheese on a burger? While I was excited to try this recipe both my husband and I weren’t huge fans. Not real sure why other than we didn’t like the floral taste of the herbs de Provence in the mayo. Perhaps mixed a few hours or even a day ahead would have helped the flavors meld better and softened them some. I cooked the burgers in a Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven on medium grill for 5 minutes to perfection. I also spread softened butter on the buns and sprinkled with garlic powder before grilling in the CIO as well. I forgot to add the soy sauce to the mushrooms and didn’t miss it one bit. The Ball Park buns were great and this was my first time using them. A lot of buns I’ve tried tend to be a little on the sweet side and sometimes a little dry. Ball Park buns are fresh and great tasting.

My husband was seriously looking forward to this recipe and it didn't disappoint!  Instead of putting the buns in the oven, I simply brushed them with a bit of butter and toasted them on the grill.  I made the mayo sauce several hours in advance to let the flavors meld.  He cannot wait to have this again!

This burger is a step beyond the basic mushroom Swiss burger.  The mushrooms and  the herbs de Provence mayonnaise set the burger over the top.  It was super juicy and flavorful.

Yum! We enjoyed these burgers a lot. I made the mayo several hours in advance giving flavors time to develop. I couldn't grill my burgers so pan fried them. Tasty!

Everyone enjoyed the burgers.   I buttered and toasted the buns on the grill which added a nice crunch.   The Herbs de Provence  sauce added a delicious change to our usual hamburger sauces.

We really enjoyed this burger. Great flavor and very satisfying. The Ball Park buns were so fresh and premium quality, they really put these over the top.

Good burger. Always looking for a new burger recipe.  Wife and i both enjoyed this one. It came out better than most fast food mushroom burgers. Will make again but use rye buns next time.

This was fabulous! Made it to the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing. Great hit at a party and looks fancy but doesn't have the long preparation. Will definitely make again!

WOW this burger was off the charts, the mushrooms sautéed in soy sauce were fantastic!  I used the Ballpark Tailgaters Buns and grilled them for a few minutes just to get some toasted grill marks.  Fantastic recipe!

I read the reviews and made the herbed mayo ahead of time and  refrigerated  it for four hours.  It just really didn't work for me even though I thought I would enjoy it.  The Burger with Swiss, Bacon and Mushrooms was great.  I strongly suggest that if you do make this that you serve the herbed mayo on the side.

I agree with the reviewer who noted that the floral notes of the herbes de Provence was offputting.  That's most likely the lavender which is a key ingredient of a good herbes de Provence.  To my palate lavender and lemon don't play well with beef.

Excellent flavor combination. My husband doesn't care for mushrooms, but he liked this too! The buns hold up well.

I love burgers of just about any type, so, I was excited to try this recipe!  The basic burger was good and I loved the swiss on it.  I was not crazy about the mushrooms because the soy really soaked into them which left a very salty mushroom.  I think they would have been better with worcestershire sauce.   Neither my husband or I were fond of the herbed mayo.   The floral notes in herbes de provence did not work with the other flavors in the burger for our taste.    If you are a fan of herbes de Provence you would probably love it though.
