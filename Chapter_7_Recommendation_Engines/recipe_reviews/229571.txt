If you love lemon, you must try these scones.  You will love them.  They have the  perfect texture and a fabulous lemon flavor.  I’m lazy, so I used my food processor to cut the butter into the flour mixture, and then added the liquid mixture through the shoot.  Fast and easy, just be sure you don’t over process.  This is a keeper.

Yummy, I have to make at least 2 sometimes 3 batches, or else they're all gone in an hour. I follow the recipe for the scones as is except that I use whole wheat flour. I still prefer my old recipe for the lemon glaze ( 1 1/2 cup icing sugar, 2 tbsp lemon juice, and add hot water- til liquid enough to brush on.)

Used my food processor to blend in the butter as it finely blends it in. You must use COLD butter and process just until the butter is fine. I put the wet ingredients together and then poured it in the chute slowly on pulse until it started to stick together. I did add a couple more tablespoons of milk. Dump the dough out on a floured surface and mix gently with hands until it sticks together and pat into a circle about an inch thick. I cut in 12 wedges and spaced them apart on a pan sprayed with Pam. These were great. Don't skip the fresh lemon rind and fresh lemon juice. Served with fresh strawberries and black grapes. Great compliment with the lemon.

I made these as directed last night. They came out perfect! Had a hard time finding just lemon scones, then I found this gem. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Just made these, as always looking for the perfect lemon scone. These are fabulous!  The scones' density is perfect -- not too dense, not too airy -- and they were perfectly moist!  A hit with all of us from age 6 up!  Some of us would prefer even more lemon flavor, but no glaze, so next time I'll forego the glaze and add more zest and/or juice or extract to the batter.  However, it was DELISH! with the glaze we made. We did make a change to the glaze -- used just a cup or so of powdered sugar, mixed in lemon extract + lemon juice, and just a smidgen of water [no butter, no vanilla].  We like it lemony & tart!  Drizzled it over the cooled scones & our glaze hardened nicely.  It added a perfect lemony YUM to the scone! And it didn't make too much.  This is a great scone recipe!  Will try the recipe again, too, replacing all things lemon with all things orange for orange scones.  This base recipe is so great, I'm sure those will be amazing, too!

Very dry and crumbly - it was just basically barely held together crumbs.  I don't know how 12 TBSP of liquid can hold together 3 1/2 ish cups of dry ingredients, when it says mix until barely moistened, so if someone knows what I did wrong I would love try again and change my rating!

These were very good. They turned out very soft, almost cake-like. It isn't precisely what I was expecting but they are tasty!

I loved the texture and flavor; they rose nicely in the oven and were delicious warm.  Easy and fast to make; ready to eat before you know it.  I'd like a bit more intensity in the lemon flavor in the scones and frosting.

Either halve the frosting recipe or double the batch of scones! There was more than enough to slather on every bite and we still had leftover frosting.  We ran out of scones way too soon.

We can't eat a lot of real sugar. Made the scones with splenda and they came out fine.  The real sugar frosting was too sweet for us.  Next time I'll try a sweetened lemon butter with zest in it instead of frosting; or a lemon-flavored cream cheese frosting. We can use splenda since sugar isn't the main ingredient. 

All Recipes Cranberry Scones By Anne DeCosta has a great butter recipe that should adapt to lemon zest and splenda.

Even though we can't eat the sugar, as is, Angelstar's Amazing Lemon Scones recipe is 5 star.  This would be lovely for Christmas breakfast or for a ladies tea.  Then by all means make all the frosting and serve the extra "on the side."

These are delicious! I made them for my friends birthday and we could not stop eating them! I followed the directions exactly and they turned out better then expected. The were light, crumbly, and very flavorful. There was plenty pf extra glaze which i put on some extra cookies i had lying around, and it was scrumptious!

I love this recipe! I always double the amount for the scones to match the recipe for the glaze. There is no adjustments needed for this recipe! Although I do like to add blueberries to make them lemon-blueberry :)

We like these scones as is, 
but LOVE them with double the amount of lemon zest and substitute more lemon juice in place of the vinegar, I also use 1\2 whole wheat flour.

These were the best scones I have ever tried. People at work were stealing them from me right out of my lunch bag! I followed the recipe pretty closely but in addition to the lemon juice and zest I added white chocolate and wild blueberries (if you try this freeze the blueberries and then add them right at the very end, after the dough is mixed or everything will turn purple). They were soooo good- they held together well (not crumbly like some recipes I have tried) and they were not dry. They are very flavourful- I am going to add chopped up caramels and apples to my next batch... YUM!!

Had to make numerous adjustments to this recipe. I doubled it with allrecipes automatic feature, and the dough was super wet--had to add almost a cup of flour extra. The flavor is not very lemony. I made the glaze, cutting that in half, and before I added all the butter it was almost too thin--no milk was needed at all. With the icing, the flavor was more lemon, and the texture of the finished scones was very nice--not too dry.

These scones are delicious. A bright burst of lemon flavor.  I used freshly squeezed lemon juice. I used a fork to incorporate the butter...than I used my hands.  The dough, at that point, turns into a fine crumble.  Slowly adding the wet ingredients  while stirring with a spoon than using my hands to get the dough all mixed, worked best for me.  Remember, not to overwork the dough once you turn in out onto board to knead. I baked them for approx. 16mins. I also cut them in 20 pieces  They were still a nice size.  I did not add the water to the glaze. It turned out perfect.  I will be making these again.

I've had this recipe saved for quite some time. With the reviews speaking so highly of it I just had to try it out before the New Year to share with my family. So glad I did!!! Two thumbs up all around! When it comes to glaze I'm a dipper or spreader. *shrugs* Either way it's delicious and they still look great. I am sure I'll be making these again very very soon. (maybe tomorrow)

So good and so easy!   The glaze really makes these scones - don't just drizzle it, frost them with it!  I think my lemon juice might have been old, so I added about a tsp of lemon extract to the scone mixture as well as the glaze and it was perfect.  I myself am not a lemon fan but my husband is and we both enjoyed these.  A great brunch or dessert scone.

Delicious! I used some whole-wheat flour, which probably made it a bit drier. I tried it first without making the glaze, and though it had a nice lemony hint, it did need something more. I only had half a lemon to do the glaze, so I added a lot of fresh lime juice, and the glaze was so good that it was rather addictive. Will definitely make this again!

I made these a few days ago and wow! These were the best scones I’ve ever had and my first time making homemade scones! They were moist, biscuit like, with an amazing lemon flavor. The only thing i will do different the next time is to refrigerate or freeze them for a few minutes after cutting them out. My batch spread while baking and didn’t come out pretty.

I've made these several times and they are amazing!!! Super fluffy, just a real joy. I shape them into individual triangles  (like a Starbucks scone) and they turn out perfect. My only advice is to make multiple batches!

I'm at 8100 ft elevation so baking is a challenge. I followed the recipe exactly and then added 3 T. Flour and 1 t. Water for high elevation adjustments. I also added 1-1/2 t. Lavender. 
This is a fabulous scone. The right balance of moisture. Some scones can be dry and crumbly, but not this one. Will definitely make again. The lemon flavor is awesome.

I made these scones in a huge amount for a gathering.  I made the recipe into mini scones by cutting each scone in half.  People at the party told me they were the best scones they have ever had.

I have made these many times always with good results. I find the dough to be dry but add milk a little at a time until it reaches a biscuit consistency. I sometimes also add an egg yolk to the wet ingredients to help the dough hold together a little better.have added poppyseeds to the dough and have also added blueberries and orange zest rather than lemon zest because I didn’t have a lemon on hand.

These are a cake like scone. I prefer my scones to be hevier. They had a mild taste of lemon and I'd prefer a stronger lemon taste. Now they did come out moist and perfect looking. So the recipe is a good one. I'm just a picky eater and want more flavor. Yes I will make them again. I cut the frosting in half and still had too much. Will customize it  next time.

Very good, though I have had better.  I followed the directions exactly.  It took me 2 lemons to get the amount of zest needed (just FYI).  My husband loved them.  I might cut back the lemon juice in the frosting just a little next time.  Really rather easy to make.

I'm not the scone fan in the family, my husband is, but these are excellent!!! Only change I made was to use cream instead of milk because I wanted to use it up.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I brought these to a tea party and they were well received! I made them again a few days later and got the same, delicious results. The glaze is delicious - I only used about half, though. Definitely a recipe to keep, and by far the easiest, tastiest scones I have made.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't add the lemon glaze on top at the end, I used my leftover lemon curd which was the perfect accompaniment. Will definitely save this recipe and make again.

These are pretty yummy!!  Make sure you use fresh lemon juice and zest, as it really adds to the flavor.  This recipe made very large scones, so I divided the dough into 2 parts and rolled each part into a round, then cut that in half with a pizza cutter and cut each 1/2 into 4 equal wedges.  So, I was able to get 16 scones from each recipe.  Make sure you let the scones cool a little before brushing the glaze on or else it melts and runs down the side and creates a sticky mess.  I found it easier to brush the glaze on instead of drizzling it.  These were super yummy and easy to make!

Great flavor. I found it easier to knead in the bowl and then turn out to roll it because of the dryness of it. Next time I'd cut smaller scones so it makes more than 10 and I'd half the glaze recipe.

I didn't have butter so I used margarine for both the dough and glaze, but other than that I Followed the recipe step by step. They came out amazing!  The glaze itself was to die for and the scones came out really moist with a slightly crispy crust. I am definitely making these again and I'm sharing this recipe.

Tastes like cinnamon buns only lemony. Dough was too crumbly for me. Had to mash it into mounds rather than wedges. Kids loved them! My son insists it is five-stars. :-)

These were so good. I added a little bit extra lemon juice to the dough and didn't do the glaze and oh my god, they were perfect. A little dry on the outside but super moist and delicious on the inside (as a scone should be in my opinion). With a little hint of lemon. Just so good. You have to try these.

Muy Bien!!!! These scones were very moist and absolutely delicious. With all the lemon needed you would think it would overpower the scone taste, but it was a wonderful tasting dish. Very easy to make with ingredients most would have at home. I would say this deserves 10 stars! If you haven't tried them yet, do it now. They are to die for.

I am making these for a tea party and just want the scones without the glaze (I am making a blueberry compote and clotted cream to accompany them).  Luckily I made these ahead of time to try because they aren't very lemony as is.  After adding the blueberry compote, I couldn't taste the lemon at all.  I will be adding more lemon zest and exchanging more lemon juice for vinegar (saw in another post) tomorrow for the party.  I"ll let you know how it goes!

Next day:  I changed the recipe to 7 T milk, 5 T 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice and used the zest of 2 lemons and kept everything else the same.  Turned out great and I got a lot of complements!  Added the blueberry compote and clotted cream and had a tasty tea party treat!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I love lemon pastries and have been on a scone kick lately. This recipe is great but just made a few adjustments. I wanted to be able to bake them in the morning so i prepped the night before by mixing all the dry ingredients in step 2 in a medium sized bowl and mixed in the butter with my hands. I added 2/3 cup of toasted coconut. Then i covered it and stuck it in the fridge overnight. In the morning i preheated the oven to 400 degrees while i finished with the rest of the recipe. Then i divided the dough into two balls, flattened to ¾ inch rounds and cut into 8 pieces each (16 total scones). Brushed the tops with milk and baked for 30 mins (turning at halfway for more even baking). They didnt really brown on top but i knew they were done b/c how they rose and they were golden brown at the bottom edges. 

And as for the glaze i saved a small handful of the toasted coconut from the 2/3 cup and threw it into the processor for a few pulses. Then halved the powdered sugar to only one cup. Added a few drops of vanilla extract, the coconut and just added fresh squeezed lemon juice from half a lemon. I think the butter and water is unnecessary for a delicious glaze. This was the perfect amount of glaze for the 16 scones. They turned out beautifully. (See attached pic. )

Like so many other reviewers, I think this recipe is AMAZING!  I Made a1/2 batch on the glaze, & reduced the butter in it - still had plenty.  My scone dough was a bit too dry, so I added about 2 T. More milk (no big deal).  All in all, best scones recipe I've tried yet.  I think this will be my new basic recipe!  The possibilities are endless...

TOO Dry....
Only made up 1/2 the topping mix and even with that I had extra!
Maybe I was supposed to drench the scones in the topping to offset the scone dryness. ;)

Won't make again......next...

Delicious!  Melted in my mouth. I’d  recommend freezing the butter, not just cold. They spread a little.  And 1/2 the icing recipe would have been plenty.

This is a delicious recipe. It's easier to use the food processor. Just pulse til the dough lumps together. Also 9 tbsps of milk is just a half a cup so save some time by using a measuring cup instead of a tbsp. The butter amount comes out to a stick and a half.

I think I needed to bake them a little longer. Turned out to be absolutely delish. Served with Canadian bacon to balance carbs. Added lemon zest to lemon glaze for extra lemon flavor.

Yeah, these are great!!  Like a few others, mine were too dry to form into a ball, but with the addition of a couple tablespoons of cream the consistency was perfect, and they are really wonderful.  I used brown sugar just because, and two large limes because living in Guatemala we rarely see good lemons.  I will add the juice of another the next times, and there will be many next times.  I didn't add the glaze.  They are really terrific the next day because the zest oils and flavors have more time to develop.  Fresh they were crispy outside and soft inside.  This afternoon they are even better.  Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box.

Five stars for flavor but two for the dough recipe.  I have been making scones for 20 years. This dough is way to dry as the recipe is written, which is a result of the wet-to-dry ingredient ratio being off.  I had to add an additional 2T milk to get it to hold together and as a result ended up overworking the dough.  For those who describe the scones as cake-like in texture, it is because the dough is overworked, which results in a stronger gluten network (and thus cake texture instead of crumbles). I will probably not make this again, as it will take some trial and error to arrive at the right dry/wet ratio. Additionally, I thought the vanilla in the glaze competed with the lemon.  I would pick just one flavor for the glaze.

Excellent lemon flavor.  I decided to add blueberries to the recipe.  Made a more flavorful scone and moister.  It would also be nice excellent with poppyseeds in it.
  I suggest this recipe for anyone who likes blueberries and lemons.

This is a winning recipe! I did make a couple changes based on people's comments that there didn't seem to be enough liquid. I added one egg and exchanged the milk and vinegar for 10 Tbsp of buttermilk. The wet and dry seemed well balanced compared to the other scone recipes I have and like. They turned out moist and tender on the inside with a nice crispy layer outside. I used a simple glaze of  powdered sugar with just enough lemon juice to make it runny. It was nice and tartly lemon, but let the powdered sugar flavor through....I'll try the glaze in the recipe  when I make them next.

Since it was the first time using this recipe, I didn’t change anything except using almond milk instead of whole milk. I made it as a last minute treat for someone who called and said he was dropping in for coffee. Easy-peasy!

These scones are delicious!  I used buttermilk for the milk, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. However, the oven temperature and timing were all wrong for me. After the recommended 11-14 minutes at 350, the scones were still practically raw. Even after 20 minutes, they were not baked. So I upped the oven to three eighty five, and by the time the oven hit that temp, they were finally golden and perfect. My range is only a couple of years old, so I don't think my oven is slow.  I know ovens vary, but  next time I bake these, I'm going to use a hotter oven. The icing recipe makes enough icing for two or three batches but that's no problem, I just put the icing in the fridge and I'll use it for lemon cake or another batch of these yummy scones!

Very good.  Like I saw in another review, I also used my food processor, being careful not to overdo it.  Just a few pulses til it comes together.  They cooked up nicely.  Very tender.  I do think it needs more lemon flavor in the scone itself (personal preference) so I may up the lemon juice and/or zest next time.  The glaze is quite nice too although it calls for a HUGE amount.  I halved the glaze and still did not use it all.  Will definitely make again!

I made these today but with some changes.  I discovered that I had no white flour so  used 2 cups of Multigrain flour mixed with 1 cup of  Cake & Pastry flour and dusted the board with barley four.  I didn't  do the glaze and they were sweet enough without it.  They tasted very lemony....I used all lemon juice and no vinegar.  I thought they  may turn out heavy because of the multigrain flour but they were light and fluffy.... my guests asked for the recipe so I guess they were a hit!

We are addicted to these scones too. I made the recipe exactly as written. The only change I made is to use my food processor to mix all dry ingredients and very cold butter. Pulse it until it resembles course meal. I then turned this out into a bowl and added the liquid ingredients. These are so tasty. I did use 2 lemons squeezed for the juice and the zest. Fantastic

Good recipe. The scone cooked well, wasn't too dry and had a nice flavor. It wasn't lemony enough for our family and there was way too much icing. Next time I will add more lemon to both the scone and the icing and cut the icing recipe in half.

Cake like texture and very subtle lemon flavor. Next time I will substitute some lemon oil for the fat to increase the flavor. Also had to really work the dough and add additional liquid to get it to come together.  I mixed by hand

These were some amazing scones! They were quick and easy. If you like lemons, you will like these! My entire family loved them. The scone itself was not very sweet, but the icing on top was the sweet part of it. That made them so  good! I would definitely recommend these!

Very nice recipe.  Light and flaky.  I had to add two additional tablespoons of milk and ice water, I live in the San Francisco Bay area and when I try baking, I need to use the extra water as ingredients don’t bind as well here. I came from a very high elevation and dry climate  to this low and more humid one and I’ve noticed this in all my baking. Just in case you do need to add the extra water.

Pretty simple to make, figuring out the cuts is a little tricky, next time I think I’ll use a biscuit cutter, since the dough has a real biscuit consistency, but, the lemon shines through nicely, I added a teaspoon of zest to the glaze, kicked it up nicely, I recommend it.

My whole family loved this dessert. I made them in squares instead and they were so cute! Just a tip- I think they should be cooked 15 minutes rather than less because mine came out a little soft. Also for the drizzle I found I didn’t need the water as I like the drizzle thick, but whatever works with your taste! The best recipe ever!

I agree with other baker, the dough was extremely crumbly.  I added a little more milk mix with more lemon juice/vinegar.  Now I'm worried it will be tough...we'll see.

I used my food processor to cut in the butter.  I also wasn't sure which vinegar to use and ended up using white vinegar and it worked well. 

The dough ended up being really dry so I ended up adding another 3 tablespoons of cold water (one at a time) and another tablespoon of lemon juice.  This was just enough to hold the dough together and the final product was a great texture.  

If you don't want to add the lemon drizzle I would double both the lemon juice and the lemon zest because the lemon flavour is lacking otherwise.

Also, I had a really hard time making the wedges even which meant the scones didn't cook evenly.  In the future, I would just make circular scones using a cookie cutter.

These are really delicious!  Just a hint of lemon, with the zest surprising you every few bites. These really puff up and spread, and I like home-size scones, don’t need the Starbucks size. So I will make them smaller next time, and of course many more out of a batch. I don’t know why it says 10 servings. Those would be GIANT scones!  I got 20 and most were still too big. The lemon glaze is wonderful.

I wasn’t sure about the vinegar, so I used distilled white. For the glaze, I omitted the butter and cut the other ingredients in half. I also added the remaining zest since I used home grown lemons. Took a little longer to bake.   IF you are wondering absolutely calories, using 1% milk, making 10 scones, and the modified glaze... 299.3 calories each. Enjoy! These are a lovely treat!

Everyone loved them! Added dried cranberries for colour which worked out well.  Recipe calls for way more glaze than needed; they were wonderful with about 1/3 of the glaze made.

The dough is so fluffy and the flavor so good. I used half whipping cream and half milk. Used a food processor to cut in butter and also helped combine the liquid into flour mix. My only complaint is that the measurements for the icing makes much more then needed. Could probably cut that in half and still have enough.

Delicious and tender, but when I read the recipe, I could see that I would like more lemon in them.  I increased the lemon zest to 4 teaspoons in the dough, and increased the white sugar up to 1/2 cup.  It took longer than the suggested time to bake. Didn't add vanilla or water to icing, just more lemon juice and a little more lemon zest. Yum!

I didn’t have lemon zest so I used a lil cranberry juice. I also used a mix of fresh blueberries with dried cranberries. The butter/sugar/vanilla drizzle was scrumptious. Yum!

Before making this recipe I had never tried to eat nor make scones. My boyfriend told me how he was craving some crumbly scones one week, so I began to do some research on them and found this recipe. After making this recipe, my family was hooked and I had to make another batch because they got eaten up so quickly! Absolutely delicious! It’s the perfect crumbly, slightly moist scone and this recipe will definitely have to go into my personal recipe book! I recommend using buttermilk for the milk because the fat content really makes this scone nice and crumbly.

Made these today and they came out nice. Used the food processor and was careful not to overmix. I used someone else’s glaze (didn’t have butter in it) but otherwise pretty much the same. Cut into squares instead of wedges and was fine but will cut them smaller next time because they poufed in the oven. Put them in the fridge after cutting and before baking because my kitchen was hot and the butter was getting too soft and that worked well. Subtly lemon and I might go with more lemon zest or try extract next time. Think I might try orange sometime soon too. Pretty good!

Made as written, seemed really floury - need to make sure they are cooked more next time.  Also could use more lemon zest.

I made them exactly as stated in the recipe and they turned out fantastic.  Nice lemony taste, just the right sweetness and perfect texture.  There seemed to be too much glaze though.  Next time I make them I'll only make half.

I had the real scones from Angelstar herself and hers were much better than mine! Hers literally melted in my mouth!! I am not going to beat myself up though because she has made them 100x more than I have, and this was my first time making scones. I only expect they will get better with more practice, but mine still turned out great. My family loved them. I followed the recipe exactly except for lemon zest because I didn’t have any. Next time lemon zest for sure!

Unfortunately I had the same experience as another baker.  Very crumbly (falling apart as you try to eat it) and didn't taste so awesome.  Very disappointing.

Like some others I found the recipe to be quite dry and added in orange juice. The icing is delicious but makes  waaaaaay too much (and I'm an icing person). After completely covering the scones, I ate a bunch of the leftover icing and then ended up dumping the rest. Next time I will halve the icing recipe.

I've made scones many times but this is a new recipe. I used fat free half and half instead of milk. The dough seemed quite dry so after reading the other reviews I added two more tablespoons of half and half. I also added 1/2 cup of finely diced strawberries coated with flour and since I didn't have lemon juice I subbed in 1 tsp. of lemon extract. At the end of 14 minutes they didn't seem done so I baked them two more minutes. They came out heavenly - just right. Will definitely make them again! Probably my new fave scone recipe!!

Needed to add more milk as it was very crumbly. Not a lot of lemon flavor either. I wil try them again but will make some changes.

I have made a lot of scones in my life, so was surprised with all the good reviews that instructions did not work for me! It was very dry to the point of still powdery when you put it on the board to knead it. I adjusted the liquid with lemon juice and a little water to make it workable. So adding more liquid i had to add another 5 min. to the cooking time. The finished taste was good but still a little more doughy then I like my scones.

Love this recipe, and will use it as the base for other types of scones! The only change I made was to add more lemon juice to both the scone and glaze.

My friend wanted to know where I bought these lemon scones because they're so good!  It may seem like the dry dough will never come together, but it will.  Try squeezing it with your hands.  It's just the right amount of liquid.  Yumm!

I will definitely make this again. These were flakey and delicious. I did have to double the amount of milk. The amount in the recipe wasn’t enough to do more than dampen the flour mixture very slightly. I live in a cold dry climate so perhaps my flour contains less moisture than it would in a more humid environment.

Next time I’d double the lemon juice in the scones and cut the glaze recipe in half.

They're delicious! You may have to add an extra tablespoon or three of milk to get the dough to bind together. But the end result is some amazing scones!

made these the other day and they almost didn't make it to the second day! so good with butter. I didn't make the icing because I am out of confectioners sugar but just sprinkled some sugar on the top before baking. I also didn't have any lemon zest on hand because I juiced the lemons beforehand so they weren't very lemony but still very good. cut it in half and spread butter on it. Yum!

This will be my standard recipe for scones from now on.My maj group all loved them and took home an edited copy of the recipe. I used the food processor for the dry ingredients and butter as suggested by another. Instead of milk, I used 3/4 cup of cream. I needed that extra 3T of moisture. They turned out so light and flaky. A half recipe of the drizzle is plenty. I added the extra lemon zest to it.

Good lemon flavor.  Scone without the glaze is not sweet, so the glaze compliments well.

Best lemon scones ever!! I needed to add a little water to the dough so it would stick together before I rolled it out, but I'll be making these frequently! Thank you for an amazing recipe

The recipe is awesome and use it as a base recipe. I often add blueberries or other in-season fruit. I get nothing but  compliments with this recipe. Thank you.

Really disappointed. Not enough flavor. Think they could use raisins, currants or dried cranberries for more interest. Wouldn't make them again.

I love scenes. I have to say this is the best scone recipe I've tried.   I substituted 1 cup of white whole wheat flour, a little more lemon zest + lemon extract, and some blueberries. I think the vinegar is what made the difference- made them fluffier. The basic recipe can be used to make a lot of varieties. One tip- to allow the cold butter to mix in easily and quickly, freeze it then grate it with a cheese grater. It tosses in easily & quickly , & makes the crumbly butter/flour mixture without over handling.

The recipe makes delicious sugar cookies, but there was way too much butter for the amount of flour.  I added more until it was workable, but the butter still oozed out while baking.

This is an ok recipe. The flavor is fine, but I wouldn't call it exceptional. Also, the directions are a little confusing and unclear at time. They came out fine, but I'm not sure I would make them again.

First time with this recipe...in fact, first time making scones! Why did Inwait so long? Didn't have enough lemon for the glaze so I substituted blood orange zest and juice. A winning combination! I'll be making these again..and again!

They're  good but a bit crumbly. Also I would cut the glaze recipe in half, I coated mine heavily  and still have most of it left, so a big waste.  Also, I added lemon zest to the butter as I melted it to add more lemon flavor to it.

There is a restaurant in Carmel, CA famous for their scones. Those Carmel scones can't hold a candle to these. It takes a little more time than indicated to grate the lemon zest, but it's worth it. We usually make them for breakfast without the glaze (though the glaze is amazing), and we've replaced lemon zest and juice for orange zest and juice for Amazing Orange Scones, but otherwise we follow the recipe exactly. **Be sure to measure your flour by spooning it into the cup and leveling it off the top. Don't pat down the flour. Too much flour=dry crumbly scones.**

For the lightest scones, I recommend turning the moistened dough out onto the baking stone or sheet you plan to cook them on. To knead, pat the dough into a round. Fold the round in half. Turn dough 90 degrees, gather any crumbs and flatten back into a round. Repeat twice more, folding and pressing dough a total of three times.

I did make them using my food processor.  Easy.  Very easy that way.  I rate them 4 stars because they really didn't taste lemony enough and there was a  lot of glaze left over.  I know I will make these again with this basic recipe and make some variations.  Thank you for posting this recipe

I loved this recipe it was very simple and they turned out beautifully.  I did make a few changes as I read the recipe it looked a little laking in flavor intensity and I like lots of layers of flavor.  I added twice as much lemon and lemon zest in both parts of the recipe.  I also on top of the vanilla I added almond extract and 2 table spoons of lemon zest to the icing as well.  Instead of milk I used coconut milk and rather when adding water I added a teaspoon of almond liquor. Absolutely delicious with lots of zest and layers of flavor.

Very good recipe that needs no adjustments. I omitted the icing as we had homemade Meyer lemon curd to slather on instead. These will be made time and time again for sure.

I've been making scones for years. My style scone is more on the Irish soda bread side, a dryer, less sweet version that I often ice or add dried fruit or citrus. 

I tried this recipe knowing that these were supposed to be more "cake-like", but having read that the author labored until she got the recipe just right, I had to give it a try. So glad I did!!!  All I can say, is WOW. We ate them all, with one leftover, and in the morning we fought over it.

These are delectable, melt in your mouth, lemon zest-y, get out your best English tea, and sit down to enjoy PERFECT. 

Angelstar, Thank you for your hard work getting this one right.  They are the best scones on the planet.

These are excellent! So delicious and delicate and flavorful! One tip I'd add is to make sure to leave plenty of room between the scones on the cookie sheet when baking. I put mine a bit too close together and they puffed into each other so I had to cut them apart and bake again. I also baked mine for about 10 minutes longer than the recipe states. Primo!

Needed a little extra milk, it was very crumbly. I also added over a table spoon of vanilla and extra zest and extra lemon juice. BEST SCONES EVER. I've made a lot of different scones but these ones have one of the best textures. Still crumbly, but really good.

These are yummy, however, I had to tweak the recipe: 
For the scones I used 5 Tbsp lemon juice and still had to add milk to make the dough stick together.
For the icing you really do NOT need those 2 Tbsp of water. That makes it too runny, then you have to add more powdered sugar so you have way too much icing. 

Other than that, they're delicious and a big hit with family and friends!

I loved these scones.  I thought the glaze might make them a little too  sweet but they were perfect.  I did have to add a little extra butter and milk because my batter was a bit dry which is why I gave them 4 stars not 5.  The end result was definitely 5 stars with my minor changes.

Wow. These are fantastic! I skipped the glaze on half of them so they can be enjoyed with jam. I make them a bit smaller than the recipe calls for. Cutting into 10 leaves the portions huge for my purposes.

These are perfect! I was looking for a recipe that makes scones with that flaky/crispy outside, and this nailed it! I used heavy cream instead of milk because I had some I needed to use up and I added chia seeds, but otherwise followed everything to the letter. Thanks for developing this and sharing!

I used buttermilk instead of milk and blended cold butter with flour mixture as others had done on food processor. Turned out perfect.   Will make again.

Made these scones according to the recipe for the 1st time today using the food processor as suggested by another reviewer.  The processor method worked out great!  Agree that the scones could use more lemon flavor. Next time I will include some lemon extract but made up for the lack-of-lemon flavor this time by making a tart glaze with more lemon flavor by using lemon juice, lemon extract, and powdered sugar. I will be making them again!

This was my first time making scones, and they turned out magnificently! I did notice that the bake time was much longer for me. Also, you could easily cut the icing in half. It made waaay too much! These were delicious and a great addition to my morning coffee routine. They would also be excellent with my grandma's raspberry freezer jam in place of the icing! ??

My husband and I really enjoyed these scones.  I agree with others that it needed more liquid when mixing the dough.  I gradually added milk by the tsp until I felt the dough was a proper texture.  I also added 3/4 cup currants.

First scones I've ever made and wow:  this recipe is definitely a keeper.  Followed to recipe except:
--used whole wheat pastry flour
--added about 1/2 tsp of minced organic orange zest
--used 1/2 butter and 1/2 cold (solid) organic unrefined coconut oil (processed in a food processor, as suggested by another member - thank you!)
--i love lemon-poppy seed anything, so (for lack of poppy seeds) i sprinkled about 1/3 tsp. chia seeds into the batter before kneading.

Chia seeds worked great - i would add more next time.  I think I'll try adding fresh grated ginger (or chopped crystalized ginger) next time.  Maybe raspberries another time.  As has already been said, the possibilities are endless; this is a fabulous base recipe!

p.s. - I sifted confectioner's sugar over mostly-cooled scones instead of using icing, since i was giving them as a (house watcher) thank you gift to accompany the Key Lime Jelly gift i'd purchased while away -- i figured that sweet jelly was 'icing' enough.

This was my first attempt at scones of any type.  I followed the recipe except I added poppyseeds.   I was expecting a fairly dense breakfast cake but they were not dense. They had a nice, thin crispy crust and very tender inside.  In fact, they rose so much they kind of squooshed together while baking...no problem cutting them apart.  I had to bake longer because they were squooshed. Next time I'll either use a larger sheet or two of my smaller Airbakes.  I'll also halve the frosting and put as much juice and zest as I have.  They were excellent the second day.  Also used parchment.

These were easy to make and are amazing right out of the oven. I followed the directions exactly, except I made 10 instead of 8 and they were still pretty big.

First time I ever made scones and they turned out OMG good! Wanted to make these because they would be good for summertime here in Florida. Had 2 marriage proposals! One from my husband! :) Anyway, they are great! Angelstar, send us more with different fruits or fruit/nut combinations!  Awesomeness, thanks for sharing!

I have been looking for a lemon scone recipe and tried a few...with no luck.
These are by far the best I have had---made them exactly like the recipe and they are winners...actually it should be be more than 5 stars!
Thank you Angelstar for the recipe!

dumb, dumb, dumb, I had measured all the ingredients out except for the milk, frozen butter and icing sugar so that when I got home almost everything would be ready to go.  Well I forgot to add the sugar and the lemon zest to the batter -DUMB-. I tasted a crumb when I took them out of the oven and I knew right away the sugar wasn't in there.  yi, yi,yi,.... so i heaped on the icing glaze with lots of lemon juice and no water and both my husband and I thought they were still pretty good.  I did add dried cranberries and used butter milk and make in the pie shape and cut the triangles that way.  I can't wait to make them again with the sugar and lemon zest!!!!!!

Cooked these for nearly 20 minutes since they were still doughy after 14. That said, these were FANTASTIC. Loved the lemon flavor- the glaze was so tasty. Made these for Easter brunch and they were a hit! Will definitely make them again.

These are the BEST! I followed the tips of previous reviewers and cut the glaze in half. It was plenty--even for my sweet tooth. I added a tiny bit of lemon extract to the recipe and pulsed the dry ingredients in my food processor (which worked great). These scones are so light! Heavenly!

The glaze for the scones is good.  I found there was way too much glaze for my taste.  Kind of a waste because I don't know what else to use it on. My husband and family loved them.  I will probably make them again with less glaze.

Excellent recipe! They melt in your mouth when they come out of the oven..I made these twice, once with the icing and the second time we topped them with lemon curd from Trader Joe's while they were still warm. Personally I liked them better with the lemon curd, my son liked them better with the buttery, sugary topping. This recipe is a keeper! ;-)

I can definitely see why this got five stars. It's amazing and suuuuuper easy. Since I love lemon zest, I added the zest of two (limes actually, lemons are hard to come by in Guatemala). If you like to play around, I gave the second batch a tsp or so of vanilla and a few drops of almond extract. Very rich and soft!

I thought they were amazing.  Next time I will add a little more lemon zest to make the scone with a little more hint of lemon, but other than that they were the best scones I've ever had!

These are amazing! I've never made scones before but wanted to try them, and ended up not having the fruit required for other ones. So I gave these a go, and they are delicious! Super easy to put together, we will make them again and again. The only thing I would add is that the icing makes quite a bit. I will likely dunk them entirely in the mixture next time, or for a lighter, less-rich flavor, just cut the recipe for icing in half and you would have plenty to drizzle. Thanks for sharing!!

These were really delicious! I often feel like scones can be a bit flavorless and floury, but these were quite the opposite! They were very moist and had a great lemon flavor. The vanilla-lemon glaze was perfect on top as well. I will definitely be making it again.
