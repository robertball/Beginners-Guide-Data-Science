I have made this several times. The family loves it. I do cut back on the lemon juice though. I only add 1/3 cup instead of 1/2. Other than that, simply sinful.

I took the advice of a previous reviewer and only added 1/3 cup of lemon juice.   It was delicious!  It is important to let the pie set for at least 2 hours before serving it - that allows the creamy layer to set up.

Recipe is good, yet maybe too sweet for some tastes. Everyone here gobbled it up. Next time I'll try adding a little more cream cheese and a little less lemon juice to thicken it up and ease on the acid side. If you've got a sweet tooth, you'll love it.

After reading the reviews I decided to add more cream cheese lessen the lemon juice and just added heavy cream to the cream cheese batter. skipped the strawberries, cooked the strawberries and made strawberry whipped cream instead. So I had a cream cheese layer topped with s strawberry whipped cream layer. FANTASTIC!!

With a few changes, this recipe is 5+! I used a deep dish graham cracker crust. Knocked lemon juice back to 1/4 cup. Used TWO cream cheese packages (total of 16 oz). Increased vanilla to 1 TABLESPOON. Refrigerated overnight. Not the least bit runny, set up great, great flavor, cheap and easy to make, perfect for a hot summer day! And, as if it wasn't already rich enough...I served it with Peach Crisp on top of it! Any berry or fruit topping would be delicious; I will admit it's all I can do not to stick my finger in it every time I open the frig! Thanks Kimberly!

the consistency is too thin and the amount of lemon juice seemed to be too much. if i ever make again i will not put in as much lemon juice. a little extra cream cheese might help as well. i used blueberries on top instead of strawberries. i do feel this recipe has potential but, my husband was not fond of it at all.

This is a perfect recipe for two pies - simply add another package of cream cheese.  Whip 2 packages of cream cheese with the can of milk,  lemon juice and vanilla.  I get rave reviews everytime!!  Its not too sweet, not too tart - and two pies is just about enough - one would never be enough for my crowd.  It is the perfect consistency and flavor with the extra cheese.

Taste good, but the consistancy was way too thin...I added another package of cream cheese and this seemed to help.  Good flavor...atleast a good base recipe to make something quick.  Thought another way to make it better would be to fold in a container of whipped cream instead of adding another pkg of cream cheese.

So bummed that the pie was runny. I used less lemon juice than called for. The taste of the pie was awesome. I may try again.

Very Yummy!  I cut the lemon juice back and only used a 1/4 cup like other posts had said.  Perfect dessert to use with summer fresh strawberries.... or any kind of berry!

The pie tasted okay.  I used less than 1/3 cup lemon juice, but it was still too runny.  Since the taste was nothing special I probably would not make it again.

Very tasty-but what a mess.  I used much less lemon then called for.  But it was still soup! I left in the fringe all night.  I will try and adjust and try again.  Good idea, just not right though.

Great, simple recipe.  Takes no time to put together.  I poured a strawberry glaze over the strawberries which seem to hold all the ingredients together.

was pretty much sweet cream soup with strawberries. followed the recipe exactly except decreased the lemon juice and it was just slosh in a pie shell. I even had it in the fridge for longer than the 2 hours recommended.  On the upside it had a good flavor.

As a novice cook, this recipe was amazingly helpful to get out of the last minute Thanksgiving baking scrape.  I ended up making a second pie because everyone in the house ate the first pie!

Made this pie exactly as written; except, used only 1 T lemon juice.
Let it sit overnight. Not sweet enough and way too runny.

This was really yummy.  The first time I made  it I didn't use "sweetened" condensed milk .... yuck.  The second time I used the correct ingredients and the result was much better.  As others suggested I only used 1/3 cup of lemon juice.  Also I used a chocolate graham cracker crust.

I used the juice of 2 lemons, opening a can of strawberry pie filing (adding a couple of teaspoons to the pie mix to give a little pink color) mixed in some whipping topping to fluff it up.  I poured mixture in a graham cracker shell, poured 1/2 can of strawberry pie filling in the middle before putting in the refrigerator. Before eating, I sprayed whipping topping around the edges.

I'm only giving a three star rating in hopes that someone will read it and tell me what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exactly. But, it would not set. I had cheesecake soup. It tasted delicious but it was ugly.

I was looking forward to this, but it didn't turn out well. It was way too sweet and the consistency was too thin. It was not firm even after chilling for 4 hours. If I make this again,  I will omit the lemon juice and use two packages of cream cheese.

This pie is fantastic! It is sweet and the filling is a little citrusy because of the lemon juice - but still PERFECT! I'm going to freeze some strawberries so I can make this year round! The best part... it's soooo easy!

Good flavor.  But definitely too much lemon juice.  I used lime and used less.  I also added a couple of more ounces of cream cheese.  As long as it was cold it was good.

This was a big hit with my family.  I used other' suggestions and reduced the lemon juice to 1/3 of a cup.

We really enjoyed the great flavor of this pie.  Very easy to make. I will definetly make again! I did cut back on the lemon juice as suggested but my pie was still a bit soft, so next time I will add a bit more cream cheese.  Also, my strawberries were a bit tart so I cooked them briefly in Maple Syrup/Sugar & water.  I drained the strawberries and reduced the remaining juice until I had syrup.  I drizzled the syrup around each dessert plate for fun!
