This IS delicious.  Makes the best margarita my husband and I have ever had and we are margarita connoisseurs! :o)

It is work squeezing all the limes and grating them... we make a double batch though!  First sip is a doozy, then it's sooooo mellow.  We also use Corazon, Patron or Cabo Wabo tequilla.  The best tequilla makes all the difference!  Enjoy.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I won't have on the rocks any other way!  I used Cointreau instead of Grand Marnier.  I think a cup may be a little strong, though I use the quantities listed here to make just 2 drinks, not 4.

Love at first sip!  These margaritas are perfection---intensely flavored, not "icky" sweet, and very smooth.  My only change will be that after the 24 hour marination, I will strain out the lime zest.  Actually one more change---I plan on making these often, and who needs to read the word "die" every time.  From now on, these fabu maggies will be entitled "Margaritas Bev".
Much thanks for sharing

These were good but oh boy, they are STRONG! And that is after I decreased the amount of tequila a bit. They tasted great, you could smell the liquor but not really taste it. However, making the sweet and sour was kind of a pain. Next time I'll probably just make Margaritas on the rocks (also from Allrecipes). However, if you have the time and initiative, try these.

By far the best Margarita's on the rocks we've ever had!  I make the in mass (up the servings to 20) for parties.  They are so strong...more like martini's than a traditional margarita, so be sure to warn guests.  Instead of grating the lime zest, I use a potato peeler and peel it making it much easier to strain out later.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I had never had a non-blended one before and my husband said it was the best margarita he'd ever had.  I was expecting something harsh but this was smooth and actually kind of sweet.  I picked this over the others available because it wasn't blended.  I didn't have 24 hours to wait so I warmed the water, lime zest, and sugar on the stove until the sugar dissolved and added the juice off the heat.  I let it set while preparing the glasses and measuring the tequila and Triple Sec (instead of Grand Marnier as called for).  We didn't prefer the zest in our drinks so I strained it when adding it to the alcohol.  We also used sugar instead of salt on the rims.  The only thing I'm left wondering is if the recipe should be for two drinks.  We made a double batch and ended up with four small sized margaritas.  We'll definitely make these again...

I have made this recipe countless times and will never buy margarita mix again.  If you are a margarita or tequila connosieur, you will love these and not mind the extra work involved.  If you would ever consider putting beer or frozen limeade with your tequila, you will probably say these are too much trouble.  If you do decide to make this delicious concotion, try these tips:    1.  If you are in a rush, mix it in a glass bowl or cup and microwave for about 20 seconds to dissolve the sugar and bring the oil out of the zest.  If you have time to wait overnight, marinate in the fridge and shake occasionally.  Mason jars work great for this ;)    2.  Unless you like drinking greenery with your margarita, strain the zest out before mixing/serving.    3.  You can easily reduce the tequila by half and still feel good after drinking it :)    4.  You probably won't get a full four drinks out of one batch so go ahead and plan to make a double!

I'm not much of a margarita drinker, but these were oh-so-good!  I agree with other reviewers - this really made about 2 or maybe 3 drinks (if served on the rocks).  I also cut the amount of tequila in half and they're still good and strong!  Overall a great recipe and I can't wait to see what my friends think.

Love this recipe!!  I don't like the sugary mixes that are sold in stores.  Made these with Patron.  Becareful, they sneak up on you.  I also made them in a shaker instead of letting them sit over night.

Not terrific.

It seemed to pack too much of a punch.  I probably could have halved the amount of liquor and been quite happy with this recipe.  Ended up squeezing more lime juice and adding water to take the edge off of it.

I recommend a ratio of 2:1 tequila:orange liquor.  I also recommend using a 1.5 ounce jigger of tequila per serving, or 6 ounces for this recipe instead of 8 ounces.  The recipe as published is very strong and too heavy on the tequila for the amount of orange liquor.  Grand Marnier or Cointreau are excellent choices for the orange liquor.  For 4 servings, use 6 ounces of tequila and 3 ounces of Grand Marnier, Cointreau, or Triple Sec.  I like the idea in the recipe to use the lime peel.  That is an interesting twist and adds flavor.  If you don't like the peel in the drink, you could strain it out after it marinates in the fridge overnight.

A local restaurant makes the best margaritas I have ever had.  This recipe is the closest I have come to replicating them.  We use a cheaper Sauza gold tequila to keep the cost down and they still taste great.

They taste great! It did take a bit longer than I expected to make, but I had to make enough for a small party. I do agree that this recipe does not serve four - it made about 3 drinks per serving. They are sweet and yummy...with a lot of sugar. Not an everyday drink for sure. Special occasions only. I was full just from the drink without all the food being served. Thanks for posting the recipe! I will try again and see if I can use a bit less sugar next time. They really are delicious though. A big hit with our friends too.

These are awesome... Well worth the work. Way better than using frozen limeade. Used Triple Sec instead of orange liqueur. Also, a lot of people say its too strong, I thought so too when making it, but I followed the directions anyway, and somehow I don't really taste the tequila. So now I add the recommended amount plus some ;)

These are great margaritas! I love that you don't have to get any mix. These are VERY strong. I have found that it's not necessary to let the lime and sugar mixture sit overnight. I have made a batch up and drank them right away with no discernable difference. I also have found that I always need more limes than the recipe calls for, unless they are extremely juicy.

I made the drink as described but I used less than premium tequila (Jose cuervo) and I microwaved the lime/sugar/water mix to speed up the process instead of having it sit overnight. I felt the drink had a good initial taste but it burns the back of your throat and leaves a feeling of a thick aftertaste that lingers on the back of your throat making you want a drink of water to flush it through. Not sure what I am doing wrong since everybody else seems to like it.

Totally agree with must of the other comments about the strong alcohol taste and ditching the lime shavings, but this really is a fantastic drink.

This was good but it did not make enough. I doubled the recipe, but the limes we have in the store are small so I did 8 limes instead of 4. I don't know if the recipe means large limes, don't even know if they exist.

Killer! (as we say in San Diego)...  If you like some kick, try infusing the sugar/syrup mixture with a jalapeno. Remove the seeds and quarter the pepper, let it infuse overnight!

It was way too strong.  I had to add some orange juice to tone it down.  I did like the lime juice simple syrup instead of sour mix though.

Wow!  These are STRONG, but very good.  More of a sipping margarita.  I used Patron silver, and cut it down to 3/4 of a cup, instead of a full.  They were plenty strong, and we like a strong cocktail.  Very enjoyable, and will make again and again.  Perfect addition to a summer barbeque.

A lot of work for a so-so margarita. Strong, pulpy, and too limey, just not enough citrus favor for me.

Made a big batch of the mix last night for a party tomorrow. Of course I had to taste test it when I got home from work. It is the best margarita mix I've ever had. Like someone suggested, instead of zesting I used a veggie peeler and it worked great. I used a medium priced 100% agave white tequila, and a medium priced Grand M. type liquor, and made a martini. 2 oz tequila, 1 oz GM, filled shaker with ice, then added 10-12 oz of the mix and shook  it up. Made 2 servings. Will be making this often.

This is the ONLY way to make margaritas. However, if you prefer the flavor of corn syrup and food coloring tequila or lime this recipe is probably not the recipe for you. It's a tragedy that 4 of the 5 top-rated recipes on this site use frozen limeade instead of limes, and the 5th uses store-bought sour mix. This recipe does take more time, but it is WORTH it! My husband no longer even bothers ordering margaritas when we go out.
The trick is the zest - makes it so yummy! 
Tips:
* We usually need to use more limes, just make sure you have a half cup of juice. 
* If you think it's too pulpy, it's easy to strain it. We do this maybe half the time - usually if we're serving to guests. 
* We usually use Cointreau as our orange liqueur, but GrandMa works just as well.
* Letting it rest 24 hours is great, but I would just say let it sit as long as you can. Still tasty either way!

Awesome - I used three large limes and it was enough for about 2 & 1/2 drinks over ice. Used triple sec.  Add an orange slice too - perfect!!   Peel lime with a peeler so it is oh so easy to strain before serving!!   Thanks for the recipe!

These were really great. *UPDATE* I can't stand the taste of frozen limeade which is why I was looking for an authentic recipe. This provided the perfect base although they were a bit strong. I blended mine with ice which made the base stretch a bit further and also took a bit of the edge off. 
I had a mexican fiesta with some friends and we all enjoyed them! Viva la Margarita!

Not at all what I was hoping for. No way you get 4 servings out of that, not worth the 24 hour wait.

These are so good and pack a powerful punch.  I doubled the recipe, and we thought they were a little sour, so we added a can of coors light.  I know it sounds weird, but it calms the tartness.  The pulp and zest floats to the top and has kind of a weird texture so we strained them.  Like earlier reviewers, we didn't let the syrup sit for 24 hours and they still turned out great.

Great ratio of ingredients in a fresh lime juice margarita...so much better than limeade!  We used a shaker and didn't due to 24 waiting game and they had a nice smooth taste.  Also, followed the others suggestion and cut back tequila to 3/4 cup rather than 1 cup...so good!  Will do these over again for sure!

These were pretty good. Much better than Margaritas you get made with sweet and sour. I will make them again.

O.M.G.! Hands down one of the best Margaritas! Love that it does not use sour mix so it is a pure Margarita. It is strong but very enjoyable sipped over ice, you hardley notice how strong it is because it is that smooth. Salt rim is a must. Makes 2 nice sized servings. I mixed ALL the ingredients and chilled overnight then served over ice and really enjoyed this drink. No need to strain the lime zest as it adds wonderful character to this drink.

Most margarita's seem too sweet, but this one was just right.  Added a little fresh OJ to cut the lime zest just a bit.  This was also good in the blender as a frozen.

I didn't measure ammounts exactly- I think you have to go by personal taste.  The drink was very good.  I used some low cal sweetner instead of the sugar.
