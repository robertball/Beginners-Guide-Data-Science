With really old-time recipes comes the good and the bad. Homemade noodles are very very good. The bad part is, these cooks didn't know...or didn't have...the things that make a dish like this excellent. I would never make this without adding onion, celery, black pepper, and thyme...and usually carrots too. These things make the broth taste like a million bucks. So if you're putting the considerable time into making this, it's definitely worth a few more minutes to chop some veggies...and it's better for you. Oh, and for those watching their fat intake, just skim any fat off the top with a big spoon, and discard it.

Just like Chicken and Noodles should be! Easy recipe and absolutely delicious, I think some people are expecting this to be a soup recipe but this is something completely different. I always serve this over mashed potatoes and always get rave reviews. This recipe is the same one my great-grandma used and is soo comforting. Also, DO NOT put this in a crockpot when first making as the broth needs to be hot enough for the noodles to form, if not they will just turn gummy. Great recipe Clara!

You go girl!!! This is basic simple homecooking at it's best like my mother and grandmother did. The only difference is they called it Chicken and Dumplings and served it with vegetables not mashed potatos. My mother would never serve two starches at the same meal. If you want more spices then add them...I prefer just salt and pepper for this dish but everyone has different tastes. If you want it easier, then get store bought noodles, but it won't taste as good and this is worth the mess that it makes in the kitchen. After all, the kitchen is supossed to get messed up sometimes otherwise we would all be eating frozen dinners cooked in the microwave.

I needed to doctor this one up a lot.  It has no herbs, vegetables or seasonings in it other than the salt!  I was going to give it one star, but the noodles turned out very well.  I added a bay leaf and seasoning salt and pepper and minced onion in with the chicken while it cooked.  Then added some minced garlic and put the noodles in.  I tried the broth and thought it was very bland.  So I added quite a few cubes of chicken bullion, parsley and a tsp of poultry seasoning.  I also thickened it a bit with a cup of water with two tbsp of cornstarch mixed in to make it thicker.  But that was my preference.  I think this recipe has good "bones" but needs some work.

Delicious! Fresh, wholesome food. THIS is cooking. The problem is not the recipe, but the time. But, how much time is spent shopping for fresh basil, dried tomatoes, fresh rosemary and the whole kaboodle without which no recipe is complete these days? Improvise.....

Just like my grandma makes! Thank you for posting. It's perfect. Note for those who don't know, this is more like a gravy consistency (flavored mostly by pepper) and used much the same. Also great served at any potluck, Thanksgiving family buffet, or with any poultry! Pure comfort food :) I can eat it alone.

This is just like Grandma and Mom used to make.  The only thing I do differently is use low sodium chicken broth and I throw in large chunks of celery, onion and carrot, sprig of thyme and rosemary to season it up.  I strain those out later.  The hand made noodles are really what makes this special.  I have done it with store-bought but it's not the same.  These noodles are easy, even for novices. Growing up we always ate this over mashed potatoes, and that is what I still do! It's delicious comfort food at it's best.  Takes me back to childhood.  That's what this one is all about for me.  :)

The idea is great, but the recipe cries for some seasoning. Sage, thyme, rosemary, onions, garlic. Anything would turn this blah dish into something that pops.

I have never made homemade noodles before and have don't recall eating any besides store bought.  My husband said they turned out like his grandmother's.  They were easy to make, I don't think I let them dry quite long enough.  Next time I will start early in the morning.  I didn't use chicken, I used beef which I cooked in a crock pot with beef broth and a little red wine.   I cooked the noodles in a seperate pan with beef broth and than added the crock pot meat and juice.

Hey out there.  I know all of you have seen the bags of noodles in the stores. If making them seems to complicated do the buying thing.  Whats important is the chicken soup on its own.  Yes, I too added a little basil and some garlic pepper but the way its prepared makes it easy for the newest cook to fix.

This recipe is very simple and absolutely delicious! My kids and husband loved it! I would consider myself an average cook. The recipe was very easy to follow. One thing I like is cooking a whole chicken on high in a crock pot about 4-5 hours with 6 cups chicken broth. The broth comes out full of flavor. I would not change anything else about this recipe it was perfect. My husband even said the noodles I made reminded him of his moms.

Perfect just like grandma makes it. I cook my chicken in the instant pot. Makes the process much faster. I season with a lot of salt and pepper

It was so simple it was insane! I used leftover chicken parts, threw in a Bay leaf, and some chopped carrots. Dinner in about an hour. 
I've tried making noodles several times and they never worked. These were so easy it was amazing.

This is NOT a simple recipe. It messed up the whole kitchen, took most of the afternoon, the noodles were like long, thick dumplings, the soup was fatty, and frankly, I prefer Campbell's. Skip this one.
