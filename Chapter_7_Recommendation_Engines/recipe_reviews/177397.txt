Great basic recipe.  We liked the lower fat content using the evaporated milk.  Added a touch of worchester sauce and an extra can of evap milk because I had a can that was about read to expire.  Husband added a drop of hot sauce but he likes things spicer.  I will make again.

Great on a cold rainy day.  I made a few changes--just a few carrots, chicken boullion,  added a little sherry, 1 shallot for onion.  No extra salt or pepper due to salt in bullion cubes.  Came out perfect!

DELICIOUS! I like oyster stew but have always had the basic oysters, milk, butter recipe. The veggies and canned milk kick it up to great. Our butcher shop had fresh oysters on sale so I used those instead of canned. My one mistake was getting the large oysters. Small would be better for stew.

Good dish. I doubled the recipe, but instead of 16 oz of oysters, I used 8 oz of oysters and 10 oz of baby clams.

I loved this.  It's really good.  The problem I have is purchasing good quality oysters without the "bad stuff" in canned oysters.  I think I'll spend a little extra and buy fresh oysters next time.  I like oysters from Maine or from the NE of US.

delicious! i added fresh chile during the 30 minute simmer for a spicier broth and fresh oysters (drained) instead of canned. comfort food, so yummy, a family favorite!
