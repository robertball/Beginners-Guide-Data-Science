My husband loves lamb but I don’t. We love anything with red wine sauce. This was a fabulous, savory dish!! Tender, flavorful, the sauce was amazing. My husband couldn’t quit raving and asking me to make it again. Just made it today a little over a week since the first time. Scrumptious  again. This will go in our permanent file. Thanks  Allrecipes.?? (I I didn’t have tapioca starch, so I used a tablespoon of cornstarch in a quarter cup of water.)

I made a few changes - it was still fantastic.  Didn't have red wine so I used sherry, and used cornstarch as another reviewer suggested. This was so tender and fall off the bone delicious...yes, this is definitely a do-over!!

Wonderful Easter lunch for 3.   On early and ready after church.   No lemon so i used key lime juice with  garlic basil dijon. Paired with avacado deviled eggs, cruciferous slaw /poppyseed dressing and haricots vert.   PERFECT

I doubled it but did not double the thyme (it seemed too much & we don't care for it THAT much!). It was fantastic! Didn't really taste like lamb. For some in our family that was a plus.

My family absolutely loved this! Even my 8-year-old. I will definitely be making this again.
