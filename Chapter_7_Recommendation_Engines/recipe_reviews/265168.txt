5.25.18  Although we love oatmeal, honestly, we’re not huge steel cut oats fans, but I keep trying to acquire a taste for them.  Consistency was pretty thick, so I did add some vanilla almond milk and some maple syrup, and I must say I liked it MUCH better after the addition of those two ingredients.  We’re not big into sweetness these days, but I think this needed some sweetness, and the maple syrup took care of that.  I like the combo of ingredients in this recipe, they partnered well,  just didn’t care for the texture of the oats.  I plan to try this again with regular oatmeal, and if it turns out more to our satisfaction, I’ll do an update for any other folks who also may not be steel cut oats fans.  It certainly is super simple to make, and that I love. I’m the first reviewer, and I don’t want to discourage anybody from trying this.  My comments are based on our personal taste preferences.  Pamela Wurtz, thanks for sharing your recipe.

We make this recipe almost every weekend. My husband and I each have a bowl, and then there are leftovers for the week. It is an excellent recipe as written, but since we make it all the time, we have made many modifications, including adding raisins or dried cherries instead of the apples.

I really like steel cut oats and thought this was the perfect consistency. I wish I had cut my apples in a bit bigger chunks; I diced them rather small.  My problem with this recipe was the amount of salt called for. I should have known better, but I was still tired this morning, and I put in the full 1/2 tsp salt. It was too salty for me. I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar, which helped. I wouldn't add more than an 1/8 tsp of salt in the future. I added some half and half on top, which is a nice touch, and they were okay.

After reading the reviews and made these modifications...I had regular oats (not steel cut) so I set the pressure for 5 minutes but didn't wait until the pressure released naturally.  I manually released the pressure and I did not have the burned or stuck to the bottom of the pan and mentioned by Erin.  I only added the maple syrup to the recipe.  It came out well and I will make it this way again.

I made this for breakfast today and it was very tasty.  I used half cup steel cut oats & half cup old-fashioned oats.  I also added a tablespoon or so of real maple syrup.  I cooked as directed and had several options for toppings.  I have just enough left-over for my breakfast tomorrow!

Well, as son as they came to pressure I got the burn warning. Made them exactly as the recipe called for. 3 cups water, 1 cup oats, apples and seasonings. Not sure what else to try :(

So good!  No sweetener needed.  I used two apples and added about 1/4 tsp each of ginger and allspice.  Also reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp according to package instructions.  So tasty!

Delicious! I used the "delay start" function on my Instant Pot so they were hot and ready when we got up in the morning. I like my oats a little softer, so I used a little longer cooking time.

I added a little more water and some almond coconut milk before cooking.  I added raisins and maple syrup and some half & half before serving.  I cut the apples into eights lengthwise and peeled them.  I used two apples.  It is delicious.  So easy to make

I made it with Old Fashioned oats, I did NOT add any salt, I cut about 1/2 an inch apples into squares, I made it in a baking pan instead of the pressure cooker, I let it stay in the over a little longer until cooked, and I added brown sugar on top. I absolutely love this dish and I used all the measurements and ingredients that was listed and I now have breakfast for myself for the next 3-4 days. Thank you.

Just started using my Instant Pot so very early in the learning stage. After reading the other comments, decided to not add the salt and did add Maple  Syrup. I also had not tried Steel Cut Oats so I had to get use to the different consistency from regular oatmeal.  My apple pieces seemed to disappear so next time I will just use my apple cutter but up it to 2 apples.

This tasted great, but I used the same amount of liquid and oats as the recipe states, and jt burned in my instant pot. I was still able to eat it though. I’m not sure why I had that issue.
