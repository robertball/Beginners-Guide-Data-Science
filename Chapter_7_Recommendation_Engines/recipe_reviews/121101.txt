This is quick to make. As others have said there is more than enough frosting for a regular 2 tier 9"round cake. The taste is great, and no "crisco" flavor or left over texture in your mouth. Heavy cream can be substituted but all I had was 2% milk and it worked out fine. I also only had salted butter so I used that and left out the 1/8 salt. I did not have a problem with the icing separating or spreading, I am not sure why others had a problem, my house is set at 67degrees. I did add a little more vanilla to taste but otherwise left the recipe as is. I will make this again. 3 1/2 cups = 1pound of sifted powdered sugar.

I used this recipe (only the frosting directions) for a birthday cake I was making for a friend's surprise party. It had a better flavor than some of the others I had tried and this one held up very well to decorating too. I didn't have unsalted butter so I used salted and ommitted the salt in the recipe. This is a very good recipe and I will definitely be using it again. The only issue I had was when I made a batch as shown, I ended up having a lot left over. I made a 16x16 4-leaf clover cake and an 8-inch round cake, and still had 2 cups of frosting left when I was done, so this is a big batch. Keep that in mind when figuring out how much you really need. Also, I found it was best to have a room temperature of about 70 degrees. I think my house was actually colder at the time as I have a wall unit that just runs in the dining room. I would do the frosting in the kitchen then set it in the dining room for about 20 minutes and it was set pretty good.

Very easy, uncomplicated and reliable buttercream. I made half the recipe, which very generously frosted 24 cupcakes with some left over. Because I piped the frosting and wanted it stiffer, I didn't use all of the milk (I used half and half) called for - added most of it in, then adjusted until I got the consistency I wanted. You can't go wrong with this one!

I'd give this one 10 stars if I could. Here's my confession: we are big fans of Costco cakes in my family, particularly their buttercream frosting. It's not fancy, but it's darn good.  I've been looking for a "clone" recipe for years...and this is it, only better.  This recipe exceeded my expectations in every way. It's easy and inexpensive to make with ingrediants you probably have on hand. The frosting keeps wonderfully in the fridge, so make a full batch.  Word of caution: don't skimp on the powdered sugar or it will be too thin. Follow the recipe and then save it to your recipe box!

This is the best buttercream recipe I have found. I tried many recipes without shortening and could never get the right consistancy or flavor I wanted. You can not taste the shortening in this recipe at all. I used almond extract in mine as well and it was great. I made 3/4 of the recipe and still had to freeze some remaining after doing a crumb layer and decorating a heart shaped cake. It works well with detailing and writing. Will used this one from now on!

This recipe was just what I needed! It was SUPER easy to make. I, too, was shocked at how much sugar it called for but I used all of it. And I have to admit that I usually HATE making icing due to the huge mess that ensues while measuring out powdered sugar. It was great to just buy bags by the pound and pour them in as it mixed with no measuring mess. Easy to make & perfect for decorating. I had no issues with it being too soft. If any icing sits out too long, it will eventually start to get soft. I just popped it back into the fridge for a few min. as needed. Super sweet - perfect for a kid's birthday cake. I'll definitely be using this again!

This frosting is taste great. I received many compliments and requests for the recipe. I calculated the recipe for 5 servings and had enough frosting to decorate 24 cupcakes generously and had extra left.

WONDERFUL frosting!!!! I just finished making this for a birthday cake for my daughter. I did make a slight change though...it was a little too sweet for me after I added the final pound of sugar. I ended up cutting in about another 2/3 c. butter and then maybe 1/4 shortening. Next time I will add the last pound of sugar in increments and taste as I go. Once I got it just right....it was sheer heaven!!

Wow! I didn't think I'd need 3 POUNDS of confectioner's sugar, but I really did use all of it. Maybe next time find a way to incorporate cream cheese... but, this was good as is. The ideal temperature to work with it was hard to meter: too cold=too hard to spread, too warm=melty mess, just right temp=didn't stay there for more than 20 minutes. Don't know how to fix that... but, could be because my house was hot!

This is traditional buttercream frosting. You can use whipping cream or heavy cream in place of milk. If you are having problems with it separating, it is probably because it is too warm, or you use liquid food coloring instead of paste or gel. The liquid always makes it have a weird texture and is only good for coloring eggs, in my opinion. Wilton coloring pastes/gels are available in Walmart in the wedding craft area and give great results. My mother and sister were both  professional cake decorators and loved their colors for the vibrancy and lack of added texture. Keep the icing chilled when possible, and add more powdered/confectioner's sugar if it is too thin, but do it in small amounts. I hope this helps!

This review is for the frosting only - we made this for bake sale items and wanted a sturdy frosting that would stand up to a warm room and some transportation.  The frosting did just that!  While I was very happy with how it handled I would not likely make this frosting for personal use.  It was really sweet and I didnt quite like the mouth feel of the shortening that was left behind.  But personal preference aside this was a nice frosting to work with and I would use it again for bake sale items.  The cupcakes in the photo were made by my 14 yo daughter and it was her first try at piping/decorating a sale item - great recipe for holding its shape!

By FAR the best frosting recipe i have found.  Not to butter, can't really taste the shortening.  It was perfectly creamy and smooth!  And it held well in room temperature. So happy to have found this recipe!  I even halved the frosting recipe, and it frosted 24 cupcakes w/ leftover frosting.

A previous reviewer said this frosting tastes like the frosting on a Costco cake, and that's exactly right. I personally do not typically like shortening-based frosting, but was looking for a frosting that would be a little smoother and more decorator-friendly than pure butter cream frosting usually is. In an effort to minimize the shortening taste, I used 1 1/2 cups butter and only 1/2 a cup shortening, but it still tasted like and had the greasy texture of shortening. It was very nice for decorating/piping, however. So if you don't mind a grocery-store-bakery frosting flavor, this is a good recipe. I won't be using it again, though.

This was very good buttercream.  I used heavy cream instead of milk and added a bit of almond flavoring.  I piped it onto cupcakes using a 2D tip, and everyone at the Fall Festival thought they were store bought.  Will use this one again.

I made this recipe into cupcakes for a swim team banquet.  My kids' team mascot is a Manta Ray, so I made little white chocolate manta rays and pushed them into the tops of these cupcakes.  They were the first dessert gone, and the kids were fighting over the last few.  This recipe is easy and is only limited by one's creativity.

The frosting was one of the better ones I've tried.  Very easy.  I wanted mine to be stiff so I did not use all the milk the recipe called for.  Very sweet but a big hit with the kids!

Tastes good, like powdered sugar frosting, but like another reviewer said, it was either too cold to spread or too warm that it got runny. After my crumb coat, and refrigerate the cake, I took out the frosting and gave it a stir to soften it up. It gets pretty hard in the fridge. I took the cake out, began frosting it and in a matter of minutes, like 3 or 4 minutes, the frosting got a greasy sheen to it and was sliding (melting) off the cake! It was devistating. I tried to salvage it as best I could with much help from the pros but this is good for decorating only, IMHO.

Easy to make and very good.  I used salted butter and left out the 1/4 tsp of salt. I didn't feel the need to sift the sugar as others did and it turned out great.

Very good and easy to make. For me it was too sweet I made the entire recipe but used 3/4 of the sugar. It makes a lot of frosting so I recomend to make half the recipe to decorate about 50 cupcakes

I could eat this by the spoonful!  I love buttercream anyway but have never done my own.  I made it exactly following the directions (actually I think I added a little more vanilla, but I tend to just let it run over my measuring spoon when I bake anyway), but it is soooo good!

This is a great buttercream . You do not have the greasy taste that you get from using just shortening. This is easy to work with and looks and tastes great

I've been baking for years with good results, BUT this frosting is a HUGE hit.  I am always asked to bring in the cake or cupcakes for any class function because of this frosting recipe!  I've made it as written, but usually substitute butter for the shortening with even better results.

Good buttercream frosting.  I didn't find it tasted too much like shortening, as I do with many others.

ok.  so i was skepticle about using this recipe. i needed to ice over 100 cupcakes for a baby shower. And i wanted the icing to acctually taste good.  i didn't want my guests to have that greasy taste and feeling left in their mouths.  At the last minute i decided to follow this recipe.  am i glad i did. This makes a Very Good icing.  I did make a slight change. i used 35% whipping cream as my liquid.  YUMMY!. i deffinatly recomend this recipe!

Way too sugary. I split in half (FYI, I frosted one 9x13 cake and still had a TON left), so this meant 1.5 lb confectioners' sugar. From various sources, I gathered that 1 lb of powdered sugar equals 3 1/2-4 cups. Thus 1.5 lbs = 5.25-6 cups. I used only 5 cups (don't like really sweet frosting), followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was STILL super-sugary, to the point where it was actually kind of gritty. I will use less sugar or try a different recipe altogether next time.

I will have to say I was very skeptical of this recipe, since there is so much sugar in it.  Well, my reservations were diminished after I tasted it!!  I'll definitely be changing the recipe I use, to this one!! THANK YOU!!

This is awesome frosting! If you keep it thick it is super easy to work with. If you let it sit for a little while, you can actually work with it a bit like fondant! Thank you for posting this recipe!

I made this recipe to do lots of well covered cupcakes for a birthday, I easily covered 62 cupcakes with this and it was fabulous! Could have even used a little less powdered sugar, so taste as you add. Perfect form and buttery tasting, thank you!

Wow...simple, easy and delicious!  I made 1/2 a batch and that was enough for 24 cupcakes.  I added a couple of teaspoons of unsweetened cocoa to 1/2...excellent!!!  Will make all the time...no more store bought for me!

Used to frost and decorate a 9X13 cake. Used 2/3 of a recipe and there was quite a bit left over.  Easy to use and tasted good (very sweet of course). Will probably make this our go-to decorator icing.

This frosting had a great texture. We thought it was a little lacking in flavor though. I ended up adding a lot of almond extract to it. With that addition, I'd give it five stars. It makes a really huge amount of frosting. I used it to frost over two dozen cupcakes and still had a lot left over. Next time I will just cut the recipe in half, but I'll definitely use it again. It's really easy to work with.

This is the BEST frosting  recipe by far!  I did do a 1/2 T vanilla 1/2T Almond, but other than a little flavoring-I changed nothing.  I had to hold my kids back from licking the bowl!!  I highly recommend this one!  Yes, it does make a ton.  I frosted 63 cupcakes and still have enough for a 9 x 13 sheet cake.

I can't stop eating this!!! I thought it had an odd, too much butter taste after I made it last night but, when I tried it while decorating the cake today it was incredible! I used it to frost a white cake from a box mix with two 9" layers. This could have easily frosted a much bigger cake. I have 2 1/2 cups left and am trying to think of something else to bake so I can use this up. If anyone out there uses the Viva paper towel or parchment paper method to make a faux fondant, this would be a good recipe to use because it crusts soon after frosting. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I didn't use the cake recipe, but this is by far the easiest and best buttercram frosting you can find.  It holds its form but remains soft and tastes like butter.

Thank you for a great recipe!

Great icing recipe! I cut this down to 2/3rds & iced 24 cupcakes with leftovers. I read several reviews & turned my ac down to 70 degrees & had no problems with the consistency. I also used Almond milk with no problems.

Frosting Review- Use very little milk for a med/stiff consistency.  I used clear vanilla and the natural color is almost pure white, just barely tinged by the butter. The taste is far supreme to Wilton's recipe. This is my new buttercream recipe and I won't be looking for another, probably ever.

This review is just of the frosting, which is lovely.  I made 1/4 batch (I used 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar) and it was enough to frost two dozen LARGE sugar cookies.  The frosting is fluffy and light.  I like my frosting to have a little more flavor so I doubled the vanilla.  This is a keeper.

Super recipe for buttercream frosting!  Used this for my daughters birthday cake and it was a hit.  My son wants me to just make this so he can eat it out of the bowl, and he's not a big "sweet" eater! :)

This frosting is delicious. Mine sort of broke after I added food coloring ,so I think the breaking with the other people may have been their foood coloring.

Used this to make a coral reef cake.  The icing is delicious, takes food coloring well, and holds up to having lots of "things" stuck to it.  If you need it less stiff, simply adding the milk works very well.  Our daughter is gluten free so this works well for us.  Definitely a keeper for us.

This was an easy to mix recipe and the consistency was perfect.  It makes a very generous amount, so plan on leftovers...For cookies maybe!

I ended up halving this recipe for 5 servings and it GENEROUSLY frosted 24 cupcakes with about 1/4 cup leftover.  I used salted butter and omitted the salt in the recipe.  I also added a little almond extract along with the vanilla.  This frosting is definitely a keeper!! Tasted amazing!!

The batch made enough for an entire Barbie cake!  I baked part of the cake in a 2 quart pyrex bowl and then horizontally sliced it in half to create an additional layer.  Then placed those two layers on top of two eight inch round layers and I still had enough frosting leftover to pipe ribbons onto the cake!  I only used 2lbs of confectioner's sugar and it still tasted great.

Great frosting!  I am not a big fan of frosting.  I usually scrape it off when I eat cake, but this actually tastes good!  I used this frosting to decorate my son's birthday cake, was great for piping decoration.  Makes a ton so I made 2/3 of the recipe to decorate a 9 x 13 cake and still had a bunch left.

I never would have thought I could actually make a frosting that tastes this good!  I followed the recipe except that I drizzled in the milk to get the right consistency.  Other reviews said it makes a lot of frosting, but I wasn't sure what that meant.  I frosted a 9 inch layer cake lavishly, and easily have enough frosting left over for another one.  I'm freezing it.  This is a keeper!

Delicious frosting--perfectly sweet and creamy.  I halved the recipe for cupcakes, and it was plenty for my 12 regular and 6 jumbo sized cupcakes.  I put the leftovers (about a cup 1/4 of frosting) in the freezer.  Hopefully it really does freeze well.

*This reviews the frosting only*  I was looking for a buttercream icing recipe to use consistently for the cakes I make as part of my side business.  And this is it.  When it is done, it taste like the center of an oreo.  It is phenomenal.  My fiance who doesn't even like buttercream (weird I know!) loved this!  If you are looking for a buttercream to use, use this!   And, note, like everyone else says, this make s HUGE batch of icing.  I decorated an 11x15 cake with this and had just enough!  (It was 2 layers and filled with a ganache) I originally put this with a chocolate cake and let me tell you, it tasted like a soft oreo.  If you are looking for a standard recipe...use this...it's delicious.

This frosting is a dream to work with!  I've only taste tested, haven't tried the finished product yet but, it did taste really good from what I could tell.  I'll definitely know more tonight when we try the cake.  I loved that it made a lot of icing.  I added an extra 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla and I didn't use near as much sugar as called for.  I added extra shortening as needed.  The cake turned out beautiful! ***UPDATE*** I tried the frosting tonight and really loved it.  It wasn't overly sweet like most frostings and it just had a great flavor.  My son has a b-day coming up and we will definitely use this for his Spongebob cake!

Really Great. Stiff enough for roses to hold up and has a nice crust, not too soon but soon enough. I used almost all the milk (after I took some out for the roses) and had a frosting that worked for pipping and spreading. Tastes great also, not super sweet. I had enough to cover 24 cupcakes and 3 single 8" round cakes. And I have some left. This makes a lot.

Great Frosting!  Easy to make, and tastes really great!  I made a (9x12) sheet cake that I cut up and made into a Roblox character (looks like a lego guy).  I used a lot of frosting, and had a lot left over.  The cake was flat and not dimensional.  My 9 year old loved it (I just made it up, nothing fancy...but looked really cute...for a beginner).

Used the frosting on a cake and cupcakes, It took color well (liquid coloring didn't make it too thin or greasy) and was a great consistency for piping.

Excellent recipe...not very greasy at all. I used a mixture of vanilla extract and rum flavoring.  Recipe makes a ton of icing...too much for only cupcakes or icing just the outside of a cake. Theres enough to ice between several layers. Because it makes so much, I am only giving 4 stars b/c I had a lot wasted for just cupcakes...maybe I should have read the reviews first and then I would have known better!

Excellent. Great taste - not too buttery or heavy. I also did not notice the Crisco, something I would HATE to taste in a frosting. I used half the recipe to fill petit fours. This recipe served my needs perfectly. I'll definitely make it again.

This is the best homemade frosting I've ever made.  Some have mentioned a gritty consistancy.  Someone told me years ago that using only the highest grade confectioner's sugar would eliminate this.  So when buying confectioner's sugar I pass on the store brand and get the best available.  Yes, I do notice a difference.

Half a recipe makes more than enough for a 9" round layer cake.  I added more flavoring.  Make sure shortening is fresh.

This frosting is great! Perfect texture to work with for decorating and very tasty! I used salted butter and left out the salt and it's perfect. Thanks for the recipe, I'll use it again!

Yum yum yum......  This was lots of frosting.  Perfect for what I was doing.  I will always use it.  I think it would be great on sugar cookies.

Worked great for decorating, a little too sweet though to use as a filling and a frosting

One of the best frosting recipes I've made. Great for decorating. Takes color well.  This recipe makes a lot. I iced 24 cupcakes and had a lot left over.

Absolutely the best frosting I have ever made.  I didnt add the salt, since my butter was salted, but everything else followed to a tee.  It held color, and was perfectly stiff for all my decorating needs, and for once this recipe needed no doubling!  In fact I had to bake a second cake to use up the rest!  If you intend to just frost a cake with it, do thin it out a bit more using a a few tablespoons more milk!

I'm giving this 4 stars because everyone that ate it loved it.  I, however, wasn't too crazy about it.  It was just okay to me.  I have other decorating frosting recipes that I like better.

Awesome! It does make A LOT of icing! I decorated my daughter's Wizard of Oz cake and needed a lot of icing so this was perfect and we still had leftover.

I made just the frosting, and it was easy and delicious.  I added some cocoa to part of it for a chocolate buttercream and it got rave reviews.  Thanks!

I didn't make a boxed cake but this frosting is amazing!  It took about 5 minutes to throw it all together and mix it up, and it tastes SO good!  The only things I changed a few minor things, such as omitting the salt, mainly because I used regular butter...and I used 1 T vanilla extract and 1 T almond extract to give it a little more flavor.  I also used heavy whipping cream instead of milk and instead of measuring it out, I just slowly poured while I was mixing til I got the nice thick consistency I wanted!  It is perfect!!!  My place is about 73 right now because I have been baking cakes and it hasn't melted or thinned because of the temp (like I read on lots of other reviews).   Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this recipe for a birthday cake at my son's 3rd birthday party.  It got rave reviews from everyone and one little guy even told my son, "Your Mama makes good cake!"  I followed the directions and only added a little milk at a time to insure it didn't get too runny.  I'll be making it again.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe to decorate with. It's temperature picky, but that's no big deal. This makes a TON of icing, and I slowly add the powder sugar until it reaches the right consistency, I don't think I used as much sugar as was called for.

Used a different cake recipe, but chose this for the frosting. I scaled down to 2 servings, and tried doing the math from ounces to grams and ended up with something a bit off because I could not get the icing to hold a shape even chilled; kept adding powdered sugar till I sort of/kind of could work with it. Will try again some cooler day. Maybe when I have ounce measures about. It was fun. Rating 5 for flavor and because my mis-measurements should not bring it down.

PERFECT ICING!!PER CUSTOMERS, TASTE LIKE WEDDING CAKE FROSTING. FROSTING WILL BE THICK USE MILK FOR CONSISTENCY. 2/4 MAKES BASICALLY MEDIUM CONSISTENCY. USE A LITTLE LESS. DONT MAKE TO RUNNY. ADD WATER FOR ICING. ABOUT A CAP FULL.
