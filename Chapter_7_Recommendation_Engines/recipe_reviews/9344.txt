WAY too much Salt! I had to remake it using oregano and thyme, cutting the salt from 3/4 cup (!) to 2 tablespoons.

A good basic Cajun Seasoning mix.  I usually make about one third of this at a time, and then I omit 2 Tbsp. of the salt. I also kick it up a bit by adding a tsp. each of dried basil, chili powder and a pinch or two of thyme. Thanks for giving me my starting point, Debbie. We love this stuff!

This was the best.  When I bought the spices, I saved the little plastic bottles, and used as containers to put the spice I made into them. I took the labels off, and added my own. They made great gifts.  Everyone loved them!

This makes a perfect gift. Don't let the amount of salt fool you - when you cook with it, it's not that prominent. Do, however, avoid tasting it from a spoon - your tongue will feel it for hours! Thanks so much. We used it on cheezy potatoes - yummy!

I really like this seasoning on chicken and pork.  I did cut the salt about in half, but that is because I don't like things very salty.  With 1/4 cup olive oil, makes a great marinade.  It was a little spicy for my kids, but hubby & I loved it.

I made this without the salt.  It is a tasty mix but you don't need to use a lot.  If you don't intend to use it often, try making half a batch.

I used this to season my chicken last night and because I didn't want to have a little chicken with my salt, I cut back on the salt to two tablespoons. We could still taste it, so I can't even imagine using three quarters of a cup.

This was fun and easy to make - made some for myself instead of as a gift. Very tasty- so far I've used it on chicken breast and on salmon and my husband raved. Probably too spicy for children, though

This is great!  I ommit the salt and just add some to taste to whatever i'm making.  this goes really well on cut-up sweet potatoes baked until crispy.

This was a great gift, it was perfect for me to add this to my Christmas goodie gifts for people who don't really eat cookies and candy.  I made it in mason jars and attached a label.  They loved it.  I also kept some for myself, it's wonderful on everything.

OK, this is HOT!!! And I love super hot food, but man, is this HOT! Halfed it, but made as written except for I did add oregano, as a lot of cajun sesonings contain it and I like the herby flavor it adds. Used it in jambalaya- That was SO GOOD but borderline too hot... BF actually broke a sweat and had to add sour cream and drink milk to calm it down. Used it again on my Breakfast Hot Potatoes instead of my own seasoning blend, but used more sparingly now that I knew what fire power I was dealing with, they were fantastic. Then rubbed it on flank steak (again sparingly) that had soake 30m in apple cider vinegar and liquid smoke, cooked on the grill with corn and baked potato, made a salad... AWESOME dinner and I never turned the stove or oven on! Makes A LOT... we'll be using this for weeks to months... Good thing it's so yummy and versatile!  UPDATE:  Used this on my pumpkin seeds after carving this year... Oh my goodness, they are TASTY... didn't rinse just removed chunks/strings from about 3 cups seeds, tossed in 3-4 good shakes worcestershire, 1 tb melted butter, about a TB of this seasonong mix and baked spread out on a cookie sheet 50 mins 325 tossing every 10-15... SO GOOD!!!  Tastes like spicy chex mix in punkin seed form if that makes any sense...

WAY TOO SALTY!!!  The only reason it has 4.5 stars is because half the people liked it after removing most of the salt.  As the recipe is posted, it was so salty it absolutely ruined our dinner, and we tossed the rest of the seasoning.  If you want to make it with a fraction of the salt suggested in the recipe, go for it, but don't give this recipe 4 or 5 stars if you feel a key ingredient was off by about 400%

Very good seasoning. I only needed 2 teaspoons of it so I did more of a little bit of this and that with the ingredients.

This was fantastic. We had our annual Mardi Gras party last year, and I ordered small 2 oz. bottles, filled them with the mix, and small purple, gold and green ribbons around the lid.  I typed the name of the mix on a small address label and attached to the jar.  I gave them as parting gifts to our guests. If anyone has another idea for guests gifts, I would love to hear then, since the next Mardi Gras party is less than 2 months from now.

Very easy to make and great to have on hand.  Rubbed chicken with seasoning, poured EVOO over and marinated for 24 hours - the entire party raved!  Not a bite leftover (60 guests).

I quartered this recipe and it worked well for Tilapia.  I still cut way back on the salt.  You can always add more later.  I also thought it needed a little more kick.  Maybe red pepper or more cayenne.

This is a great cajun seasoning, I would give it 5 stars but I decreased the salt to half a cup and our 'Southern Pulled Pork' (from this site) was still a bit salty. The BBQ sauce balanced it a bit. But next time I will use less. I also added 1 tsp. Thyme and 1 tsp. Oregano. I love creating my own seasonings, people always ask what the flavors are. Thanks for this one, its a winner with me.

Made this for the first time today and I must say I was highly disappointed.  This recipe called for WAY too much salt for my boyfriend's and my taste, unfortunately we followed this recipe because of the reviews and didn't realize how it tasted until our shrimp had finally cooled down enough to taste.  Will use this recipe again just with not as much salt.

Never add salt to a spice mix ahead of time.  Always salt the dish just before serving.  That said, needs thyme and oregano, 1 tbs each.

I made a large amount of this to give as gifts for Christmas.  I like the flavor and it's certainly cheaper and easier than the store bought cajun seasoning.

the first time I made this is was way too hot, so next time I used half the amount of red pepper, and cheated the salt a little, too. I used this in another AR recipe, Hudson's Baked Tilapia, and it worked great!

I made this recipe for myself and didn't put it in jars to use as gifts.  It was great though!  The only thing I did differently was use black pepper in place of white.  I didn't have any white pepper and I didn't want to have to go to the store; I'll pick some up next time though that way I can properly make this recipe.  :)

Wonderful. I love that I can make our own seasoning as I didn't have any Cajun seasoning on hand. Didn't have white pepper so left it out and it was still good. We used this on Cajun Chicken from Deb K from allrecipes. This recipe is going into my recipe book!

I made a batch of this to split...half to keep and half to give as an addition to a Christmas present.  I've used it several times now and LOVE it!  Wheather cooked into a recipe or sprinkled on fresh french fries or on warmed up leftovers, it's a 5 star for sure!

I needed to replace my Cajun Seasoning so I didn't do so well with the sand art. I just mixed together. I used way less salt. Thanks for the recipe!

I halved the salt and didn't have any problem with saltiness (although I would definitely omit any additional salt when using this in a recipe) and I should have also reduced the cayenne.  In fact I just changed this rating from 3 stars to 4 because I just realized, in reducing the serving size to 2 servings, I think I inadvertently doubled the cayenne ratio.  No wonder my lips are burning! Anyway, I do think this also needed some other flavors, like oregano or thyme.

I found it a little hot but very good added 2 tbs Oregano and used 1 cup sea salt rather than regular table salt . I do not use any other salt when cooking and with this mixture when salty enough the spice was just right .

We love this spice at our house.  We've even put it on toast.  After having this, I will never buy cajun seasoning at the store again.  It's weak and flavorless compared to this stuff!

I halve the salt and use granulated garlic instead of garlic powder. Excellent on baked sweet potato "fries." The recipe as given actually yields a *lot* more than 12 servings, even with the reduced volume from halving the salt.

I changed this recipe to two servings just to try it out.  It was very good!  I cut salt in half though and used black pepper in place of the white.  Otherwise didn't change a thing.  I used the mix for a cajun fish recipe and it turned out great.  Will make again!

I made this then compared to Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning, which I use all the time-very very close!  I use Tony's all the time but I want to use only unrefined "real salt" so making my own is a great option. Thank you so much for sharing

This is wonderful staple to have in the pantry.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the amount of salt.  Even though I love salt, I think 3/4 cup is way too much.  I  only use 1/4 cup of season salt and 10 grinds of sea salt. I also add a small amount of oregano and thyme.

This was 'way too salty and too peppery, also. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added ground thyme, chili powder and extra garlic powder. That cut the ordinary-ness of the salt 'n' pepper to something special! Used it in the "Cajun Chicken Lasagna" (also found at this site), and it was delicious!

For the two of us, I had to adjust this recipe as follows.1 tsp each of the spices and 1/4 tsp of the cayenne.  Omit the salt-it's not necessary. Delicious on hamburgers!!!

This was a little too salty for my tastes.  I cut the recipe down because I only needed a small amount for the cajun chicken pasta recipe.  If there were a little less salt the mix would be perfect.

SKIP THE SALT!  It's way, way too much.  I made this without salt and season the dish itself instead. 

We use this with a saute of whatever fresh veg combo we have in the fridge, some sliced link sausage, and a little stock and heavy cream to make Cajun pasta. So good! Just salt and season with the Cajun mix to your taste.

I scaled this down to a few servings for the Cajun Chicken Pasta recipe on AR.   Wish I had made a full batch because this was a perfect seasoning for my dish!  It has quite a bit of "heat" from the cayenne, so, if you can't handle the heat I would use less cayenne.  For my family, it was just right.  I think this would be wonderful on hash browns also.   Thanks for the recipe!

We're not big on salt, so reduced that to a healthy dash.  No white pepper, so used all black.  Didn't do the jar thing, just used.  This would make an attractive gift, though.  Good seasoning mix.

OH YEA! This stuff is awesome. I am a saltaholic so i cant say that it was too salty to me. I thought it was great. And yes when you cook with it, the salt will tone down a bit. Especially if you use it to smoke with. Anytime you are smoking, you want to use excess amounts of spice b/c the smoking process will take away from the spice if you dont. I use it to smoke birds, over steaks, even on black eyed peas! haha. Awesome. Thanks.

Wonderful!  I modified the ingredients to two servings and rubbed into chiken before frying.  Chicken was delicious!  I cut back on the Cayenne just slightly to accomodate a child but even still it was a wonderful flavor.  I thought it tasted salty at first but after cooking it was just right.

I was lucky enough to find really cute jars at Pier 1 this Christmas, and made this to fill them.  I never got to try any, but got really good reviews.  One said it was too salty the others said it was just fine.  Everyone loved it though, what a great present for men who never cook but love steaks!

My husband is diabetic and he loves dessert.  I constantly have to change recipes.  So I used Stevia instead of sugar and fat free cream cheese.  Also I used sugar-free lemon flavored gelatin because we like really tart desserts.  I did not have whipping cream so I used sugar free Cool Whip.   The result was amazing and made a great sugar-free, fat free dessert.

Half cup of salt, no white pepper but kept everything else the same. Used it for a recipe and I’ll be experimenting with it...

We love this seasoning! It’s the only Cajun seasoning I use. I make up the recipe in a mason jar, and when I run out, I look up the recipe and make it again!

This recipe breaks down to 1 tablespoon of salt per serving, versus only 1 teaspoon of most of the spices per serving. Thus, if it had been named “seasoning salt,“ I might rate it higher, but I’m not going to be one of those raters who has omitted the salt and then given it 5 stars.

I always keep this mix on hand because it's so versatile...it can easily be altered to your own taste if there's too much or too little of a spice you enjoy as well.

I scaled this way down to teaspoons instead of tablespoons.  I cut the salt to 2 teaspoons and the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon for our personal tastes.  I used it on a sausage Alfredo recipe from this site and it added great flavor.

I halved this recipe just to try it out.  Half of 3/4 cup salt is 6 TBS. However, I did not use that amount of salt due to the reviews.  I thought it'd  be too  salty.  So, I used 2 TBS. instead.  It was still slightly salty  for my  taste, but nothing  too  overpowering  for use in my Cajun Alfredo I made for dinner.    It has nice heat! Hubby loved it.  Will make again probably with 1TBS.  of salt if I end up halving  the  recipe  again.  Thanks  for  sharing.

I used this in the "Spicy Sweet Potatoes" recipe (also from this site).  I used seasoned salt instead of regular, and used about a third less than the recipe calls for.  This seasoning was great with the sweet potatoes.

I made this, decreasing salt to two tablespoons.  We like hot and spicy, but this was way too hot.  Any suggestions as to how I can add something to take away the heat?  Any ideas would be appreciated.

i love cajun food! This seasoning is great, I add it to almost everything I eat now! I don't mind but it is a little salty. So when making it you can cut down the amount of salt.
