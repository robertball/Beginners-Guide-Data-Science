Yum! I pretty much followed the recipe, I had to use agave instead of honey.  Fast and easy to make. Will definitely make again though, I will probably make them smaller/bite size.  This recipe could be a base for other veggie and cheese combos which I will hopefully try in the near future.

I liked everything about this recipe except its eye appeal.  Unfortunately, the brussels sprouts filling turned brown after baking making it look like ground beef.  The most important thing is how it tastes, and it was good, but its presentation was a disappointment.  I know, I know, this is purely aesthetics, but we do eat with our eyes as well, and I would never know that this was a veggie side dish if I hadn’t made it.  Followed the recipe to the letter, except for letting it bake longer to brown the pastry crust, and it was quite easy to prepare.  The balsamic vinegar really comes through in this recipe giving the filling just a little tang, and you’ll definitely taste the feta as well, both good things.

I am not a cook but made some  adaptations that seemed to work  i used phyllo  sheets notsure if thats the same as pastry dough.   I didnt have fresh basil used dried and added  a few cloves of fresh minced garlic  i also diidnt have walnuts so i use sunflower seeds  and generic feta.   I brushed olive oil between layers and it cam eout delicious and goldennbrown on top.   Coworkers loved it and asked formthe recipe.

The filling had an unappetizing texture and a bitter taste.

I thought this had a lot of flavor, and the flavor wasn't what I was expecting.  I agree that this makes a lot, so I cut it in half for just me and my husband and we still had leftovers.  I also agree that the balsamic vinegar turns the entire filling an odd shade of brown, and makes it look like ground beef (my husband even thought there was ground beef inside).  Took close to 30 minutes for ours to get brown and puffy, but like another reviewer mentioned, it was a tad soggy in the middle (due to all the oil in the filling, no doubt).  Despite this, I still found it to be pretty yummy and I'd try it again with a few minor tweaks.

They turned out great. They were devoured. Even the teens like them. They were a lot easier to make than I anticipated.

Kenny really liked it.  Recipe makes too much. 1 square of puff pastry and 1/2 recipe is more than enough for the 2 of us.  You have to bake it more than 20 min.  Probably baked at least 40-45 min. to try and get it golden brown, and then the pastry rolled up in the middle was just soggy.

I had to make a couple of slight changes based on what I had on hand. I used dried basil instead of fresh and all walnuts since I had no almonds. I also didn't have puff pastry so I made a pastry dough from scratch. Instead of a roll I put this all in a pie pan with top and bottom crust. The texture was ok and flavor was good but it certainly didn't look appetizing. Either the balsamic colored everything brown or the Brussels turned brown with the baking. So not pretty to look at but pretty good to eat. I will make this again but maybe make a few modifications in the flavor profile to jazz it up a bit more.

I made this for an appetizer for Christmas Eve! It was so good! I used Phylo dough because I grabbed the wrong box and it didn't hold well so I ended up setting it out with crackers like a dip. Everyone loved it! I have leftover so I'm going to make bite sized cups with phylo dough  a cupcake tin.
