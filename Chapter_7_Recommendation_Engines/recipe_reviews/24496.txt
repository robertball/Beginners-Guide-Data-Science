Like many drinks made with coffee liqueur the addition of it tends to overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. The taste of chocolate gets lost in the coffee. That is the not so good part of this drink in my opinion. However if you like coffee you might find this to be quite good. The redeeming quality of this drink is the use of vodka which makes up one-third of the volume of the drink. The vodka balances out what would otherwise be quite a syrupy drink making it somewhat refreshing. Hence if you like coffee and do not want something overly sweet this might just hit the mark for you. I used a clear chocolate liqueur which gave the drink a beatiful clear brown color as you can see in my photo. Enjoy!

This drink is magnificent! I usually don't like coffee liqueur that much but this drink mixed with the chocolate liqueur is amazing. I followed the recipe pretty much as is except I doubled the vodka. Go strong or go home. Perfect for any occasion. Thanks for sharing. Now one of my new fav's.
