I fed them to my son's dog Lina, a pit bull, and my sister's dog, Dexter, a rescue. They both loved them. I would make them again!

The recipe makes a large amount of dog treats.  I don't think I cooked them enough, because the treats were still bendable after baking.  But my dog adored eating them, and I will make them again, only a half batch next time.

This was my first time making homemade dog  treats and my dog loves them. I didn’t change any ingredients  but used my food processor to chop and then mix up everything as I only have a cheap hand mixer. I do keep them in the refrigerator.

Be very careful to use only NATURAL peanut butter - a lot of the others have Xylitol which is poisonous for dogs.

I have made this recipe twice.  The first time I made no additions, but the second time I added about a half cup of oat flour.  This addition helped the treats become firmer, and I recommend the addition, especially if molds are being used.

These were very easy to make and my dogs loved them. I will say that you should keep any unused portions in the refrigerator as they will not keep more then 3 days unrefrigerated.

My dog did not like them ,wouldn’t even try them. Tried to give them to my sister’s dogs and they wouldn’t eat them either. Maybe I will have to eat them
