Couldn't be any easier!  Very rich and smooth.  I used pecans instead of walnuts since that's what I had on hand. I might try it with peanut butter next time.

My boyfriend LOVES fudge, but I always burn the sugar so this was an AWESOME alternative. I used fat-free Philly and added 1/2 c. chunky peanut butter (next time I'll add more). The recipe itself passed the test, the boyfriend thought it was awesome. It reminded me a lot of chocolate cheesecake, so I have a sneaky suspicion this would be great pressed into a pie crust...hmmm

So EASY and good!  It takes a while for this fudge to stiffen up- don't let that dishearten you.  It is yummy.  I made it for a dessert party and it was the favorite pop in your mouth treat.  I myself ate a whole second batch and couldn't stop. My dog is getting extra walks so that I can work off this fudge! (Cause you know I'm making ANOTHER batch!!)

This was perfect for my first time. I substituted 2 of the unsweetened squares with 2 white chocolate squares. Absolutely delicious

Really just a thick cream cheese frosting.  Not too fudgy.  Tastes good, but doesn't taste like fudge.

This is NOT fudge.  It's actually the first recipe with a 4+ star rating at All Recipes that I consider a major FAIL.  After I made it, I put it in a container in the fridge to use to frost a chocolate cake I'm gonna have to make now.  It's basically a chocolate cream cheese frosting if you leave out the nuts as I did.  There's nothing about it that says, "Fudge".

Easiest fudge I ever made! I substituted pepperment for the vanilla and left the nuts out. Gave it away as Holiday gifts.

5 stars on taste! 5 stars on easy to make! 1 star on fudge. It's not what I consider fudge. It tastes like a container of chocolate frosting, mixed with cream cheese and nuts. I love chocolate frosting, but it's not what I would consider fudge.

The fudge itself tastes great - I followed the recipe exactly and practically licked the bowl clean. However I think I beat it with the mixer too much because it was tough to get out of the bowl and I had to press it down with my hands and waxed paper. But it tastes SO good!!
