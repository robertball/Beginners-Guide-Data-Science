Made this for the first time last night and it was a hit at the party.  I omitted the sausage all together. Used only SPAM Lite.  Reserved pineapple juice to use equal juice and teriyaki sauce in place of oyster sauce. Reduced eggs to just 2.  Added some crushed garlic to hot oil before adding rice to fry. Did this because when reading directions it said to add garlic powder however I did not see this on the ingredients list.  Lastly, sliced pineapple chunks into thin slices. This is a great recipe.  I am surprised it has not been reviewed more.  Was asked to share the recipe.

5 STARS!  This dish was the talk of the Luau party I just attended.  People I didn't even know were pointing and saying "That's the Rice Lady".  By the end of the night I was being called the "RICE QUEEN"!  I had never made this before the day of the party.....Lucky me!  I got the sausage from a local phillipine grocery store and used 2 reg size cans of tidbit pinapple instead of one and light SPAM.  Held well in crock pot on low.  Don't skimp on regular rice definatly use the Jasmine rice!  YUMMY!!!  Must Try!

Really easy dish that is so good. I used leftover rice (i freeze white rice when i make a ton and put it in ziploc bags. just pop it in the microwave for a minute and instant rice) and used the pineapple juice from the canned pineapple to mix with soy sauce instead of hoisin (didn't have any). just really really good dish! thank you!

I used fish sauce instead of oyster sauce, 3 cloves garlic, fresh, and sliced thick ham.  I would recommend the green onions cooking - not stirred in just prior to serving.  Overall, it was very good. We're saving the leftovers and I'm thinking the flavors will blend together even more and it will be perfect tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh...and 2 cans of pineapple.  If you're using canned then go with Dole.  It really is superior.

This was fabulous.  I loved the play on sweet and salty.  Yes, I did have to make changes, but they were minor.  I left out the chinese sausage, only because i was too lazy to schlep downtown to the asian market, and I used tidbit pineapple, instead of chunk, because that's what I like.  Everything else was exactly the same.  If forced to make any changes to the original (other than the ones I already made, HA!), I would use a big can of pinapple, instead of the small...I really enjoyed coming across those little sweet pieces, and wished there were more.  Thank you so much for the recipe, I will make it often!

This is delicious!  I used leftover rice, a ground pork sausage in lieu of Chinese sausag,e and SPAM lite because that's what I had on hand.  Followed the recipe otherwise.  My husband loved this.  I will defintely make this again.

This is a very tasty dish! I cooked the eggs into an omelet, using a small amount of oil. I then rolled it up like a burrito, sliced it into small strips and set it aside. I cooked both the spam and lup cheong in the skillet without the 2 tsp. of oil. Once the sausages were rendered I added the cold rice using the grease from the spam and sausages to coat the rice. I added one garlic clove, chopped, in place of the garlic powder, thou the garlic powder wasn’t listed as an ingredient called for in this recipe. I stirred everything then added the oyster sauce, Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. I added the pineapple bits and eggs and stirred to combine well. I sprinkled with some chopped green onions. I could see the pineapples bits, chopped spam, lup cheong and specks of green onions throughout the fried rice. There is a nice sweetness from pineapple bits and saltiness from oyster sauce and sausages. A nice change from plain ole’ white rice with a tasty blend of flavors.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good. Used leftover rice, SPAM lite, no sausage, fresh pineapple and sadly, had no GF Oyster sauce, so subbed GF soy sauce, sriracha and a little honey. Added some peas for a veg. Was a little dry, but I blame the pineapple, no juice. Plus, as the entire SPAM-eating world knows, SPAM has to be cooked crispy. Will for sure make again, after I cook up some GF Oyster sauce. Will be super with that and canned pineapple with juice, plus mixed veg and double the onion! Thanks, Chen, for an easy complete meal. It's a winner, and so easy to tweak to taste.

I just made this for a party this last weekend and had to make 2 double batches(I have a big wok)! I was unable to find the chinese sausage and was leery of spam so I cubed 2 raw ham steaks instead. I browned the ham a bit after cubing it and it worked out great. I also added 1/3 cup white sugar, 2 Tblspns honey, 2 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 Cup soy sauce, 2 Tblspns toasted sesame oil and cut 1 fresh pineapple into cubes. Remember, I doubled the recipe, so the amount is not exessive. The dish was such a hit that even the second batch couldn't satisfy everyones appetite for more. Chen, you're an angel. Thanks for making me the hero!

Excellent!  Left out the Chinese sausage and used Spam Lite (it still has plenty of sodium & fat) for the first time ever.  I added a little carrot, pea and corn frozen vegetable medley.  Will defintely make this again.

This is a favorite at our house.  I make the following changes, but it remains pretty true to form.
1. Cook rice in rice cooker & spread on greased cookie sheet to room temperature. 
2. Omit sausage (just too much meat for our taste)
3. Use fresh pineapple when available...ammmmazing!
4. Use about 2 tbsp oyster sauce and 1 tbsp soy sauce.
Highly recommend!  Very tasty!

I can't give it all 5 stars since I don't make it with spam--I use cubes of ham, or BBQ pork--or the sausage.  I have also added shredded cabbage and carrots to get some extra veggies in there to make it a one dish meal.  Very tasty and fast (I make the rice the day before for best results otherwise it comes out mushy and sticky).

Even though my guests enjoyed the dish, I was disappointed in it.  First off, the jasmine rice came out very sticky, more like sushi rice. When frying the cooked rice in the canola oil, it never toasted. Second, although I doubled the amount of pineapple I found the dish to be lacking in flavor.  I ended up putting soy sauce on the table for anyone wanting to add more flavor.  Sorry because I was really  looking forward to this dish.

Excellent!!  Served this at a luau themed party, and everyone loved it.  Husband and very picky toddler loved it as well, which is a rarity.  Left out the lup cheong, just because I never loved it growing up, and used Lite Spam so I wouldn't feel guilty serving it to my family.

Whole family loved! -- Cooked the spam really well as the texture is too mushy unless made near-crunchy, and had to eliminate the chinese sausage as the local chinese market was out that day.  still wonderful -- the measures for garlic powder? had to wing it and it was great!

Very good.    I used the lite spam and cooked a chopped green pepper with the meat because I had one on hand.  I'll make it again.   I like things spicy so I might play around with the spices a bit but would recommend this one!

Every time I make this, I get rave reviews!  I usually omit the sausage because my husband is not a sausage fan, and I always use Turkey Spam, but I make no other changes.  Even speaking as someone who does not like pineapple in savory dishes, this recipe is fantastic!

We live in Hawaii and there is nothing more authentic than mixing in SPAM and Lup cheong.  My husband loved the sweetness of the pineapple and said it was the best fried rice I had made yet!

I had fried rice in Hawaii and tried to recreate it. This recipes was so close to the one I had at the resort. I didn't realize I was forgetting the oyster sauce and SPAM. These ingredients make the rice taste so authentic. I made a few changes to recreat the flavor of the resort rice - omitted the pineapple, and added 5 cloves of roughly minced garlic (the one I had was VERY garlicky. I definately suggest  NOT substituting the Chinese sausage - it makes such a difference in the flavor!

This was great!  I had some cooked Jasmine rice to use up and this sounded yummy.  I got all excited reading the ingredients that I totally skipped reading the directions and basically tossed everything in the frying pan.  Regardless, it turned out great, despite not having sausage or oyster sauce.  I added a bit of salt but other than that I used what was on the list.  It was great!  Thanks for this recipe, I'll be making it again for sure!

Very good!  Have made this twice now, everyone loved it both times.  Still haven't found Chinese Sweet Pork Sausage - so I used honey garlic ones instead.   I don't know what I'm missing - is it possible this can get even better?

My husband and I have made this recipe twice now. We both like the recipe, but had to make the following revisions for this to be 4 star-worthy. Added fresh chopped garlic in addition to the garlic powder. Also added chopped yellow onions to give it some texture. Excluded the pineapple because we've never seen restaurants in Hawaii use pineapple in their fried rice, ever (yes, we ate at all the hidden gems/local spots, not the touristy places). Only used 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce. Anyone who has cooked with oyster sauce or is familiar with it knows how salty it is. 3 tablespoons sounded like way too much, so we used 2 tablespoons our first try; the leftovers next day were almost inedible. Cut down to 1 tablespoon this time around and it made all the difference. Used Spam Less Sodium instead of regular Spam to balance the saltiness of the oyster sauce. Added nori fumi (seaweed) furikake rice topping on the rice, just like they do with poke bowls. My husband and I both agree that this topping adds a whole new level of complexity to the fried rice. We insist that you try it! Overall, this is a good starting point with room to improvise. Thanks for posting!

The whole family loved this. I did make some changes though because I didn't have time to run to the store before cooking.
No oyster sauce available- used soy, hoisen, and pineapple juice to substitute.
Used ham lunch meat in place of span.
Used big can of pinapple.

I've made this a few times now and it is absolutely delicious. I've made a few changes though. First.. I don't use Jasmine Rice, it's too sticky. I use day old rice or cook it that morning and leave it out to dry a bit. I don't use Chinese Sausage, too hard to find.. instead I use Lil' Smokies (mini sausages) and cubed ham instead of Spam. After browning the meats, I saute' regular white onion just enough to soften it.  Instead of Pineapple Chunks, I use two cans of Pineapple Tidbits. Fantastic recipe and great left over the next day too.

This is an AWESOME recipe. I love the play on sweet and salty. You should definitely use SPAM. I used the low sodium kind. For pineapple, I used pineapple tidbits which was the perfect size for a perfect bite. For additional flavor and color, I added frozen peas and corn at the end of the rice. Everyone loves this rice recipe and can't believe SPAM was in it. (I didn't tell them SPAM was in the recipe because most people would not have tried it.) If you haven't given SPAM a try, you should. Also, you should use the oyster sauce. It does not give a fishy taste at all. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It's a definitely a family and guest favorite.

We were doing a Hawaiian-themed lunch at work and I picked this recipe because not only did it look good, it seemed like it would be easy and quick enough to do on a week night. I found some sweet pork sausage at the Asian Market - it wasn't called lup cheong, but I think it was the Filipino version of the same thing.  It didn't slice well, so I squeezed it out of the casing and it worked fine.  I cooked the rice a day ahead, so that it would be cool and ready to go.  I read all of the comments and used a 20-oz can of pineapple tidbits.  I cut the SPAM in very small pieces (not much experience with it, and kinda grossed out by it) and fried it and the sausage until very crisp. I also fried the rice quite a bit longer than the recipe said so it would also be crispy.  The next day, I stirred in the green onions right before I nuked the rice.  I have to say, despite my trepidation over SPAM, that it was very, VERY tasty, and was the hit of the potluck!  There was not a single grain of rice left, and everyone, bar none, asked me for the recipe.  I will make this again!

Easy and very very good. I don't add the Spam to it though. I make with the Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker and both go well together.

I made it with the leftover holiday ham instead of spam. I also had leftover pineapple  and cherries which was used to drizzle the ham, so I just picked out the pineapples to us for the fried rice. The Chinese makes this dish delicious!!! :-) Thank you for the recipe, chen!

Did not care for this at all. Followed recipe specifications to the letter with the exception of using turkey spam instead of regular and using a version of the sausage called for made with chicken instead of pork, simply because I don't eat beef or pork. The pineapple is very faint - if you want to be sure to detect it, I recommend using a large can & even consider throwing some of the juice in with the rice as it cooks. The only bites that tasted kind of ok to me were those that contained at least a bit of the green onion - provided a nice little burst of freshness so if you're going to try this definitely don't skip the green onion, maybe even add more than called for. Looked interesting and the reviews were generally good so I decided to give it a try - glad I did but definitely won't be making again.

I omitted the 2 tsp of oil, SPAM and sausage because I was looking for something to complement the Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs on this site, that we just love. This rice absolutely did the trick. Thanks Chen, it was delicious!!

I found this recipe here on Allrecipes a few years ago and made it for the first time. It was to die for. I remembered how great it was the other day and made it again last night.. It really brought me back. An explosion of great taste; the sweet pineapple and salted meat! 

I have never made mine with the Chinese sausage. I used a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks and cut each chunk into thirds. I cut the luncheon meat into pieces about as big as the cut pineapple pieces.

I added about 1 tsp of garlic powder while frying the rice in the oil.

I cooked everything together in the end for a minute which cooked the green onion perfectly.

This recipe is definitely a keeper for years to come. Restaurant quality!

I tweaked this recipe quite a bit, but loved it! I cut out the spam and meat entirely, (as I was preparing it to be served with sweet pineapple chicken meatballs), I only used two eggs, and I took some one else's suggestion, and rather than oyster sauce, used half and half, pineapple juice and teryiaki sauce. I sauteed in diced red pepper while I cooked the eggs, and about a minute before I took the eggs out of the pan, tossed i the pineapple and green onion, so that they weren't added in completely raw. The base of this recipe is awesome!! I will most def be making it again!

This meal was a big hit.  I did not tell my husband that I made a variation on our regular pork/chicken fried rice.  He started eating, stopped and said, "Is there pineapple in here?" and when I told him it was an island variation he said, "This is delicious."  Now, I did eyeball the ingredients and ended up adding way more pineapple than stated- loved it that way.  Also, I used regular cubed ham since we are not a fan of the Spam variety.  As for the rice, I always make it an hour or two before dinner and stick it in the freezer so it is nice and cold when I need it.  That way, it doesn't get mushy.  Hope this helps.  Thank you for the recipe, chen!  It will most definitely be made again.

I made as written except I could not get Chinese sweet sausage/not sure what it's equal is so I used Italian sweet sausage and real ham/not SPAM. One problem is that the instruction list says to add garlic but there is no garllc in the ingredient list....had to guess. I started with 2 cloves and that got lost and ended up with 4 cloves. In the end my daughter still didn't care for the sausage in it....said she could not taste the pineapple flavor much over it and she wants to taste the pineapple. Persoanlly we will stick with the one here on AR called Pineapple Fried Rice II for our tastes.

This rice was excellent!!  The only changes I made was to use ham instead of SPAM and to use a sweet sausage meat instead of the Chinese sweet sausage.  The rice was so tasty and I can not wait to make it again!!

I love this rice. I made the rice with pineapple juice replacing the water. I only used spam and I didn't have oyster sauce so I used soy sauce. I also omitted the onion because my family doesn't like them. I also used coconut oil to fry everything up which have it a very light coconut taste and really made a more tropical rice.

I really liked this dish even though the rice - simply and delicious.  Even though the rice was nowhere close to "fried" (it was more like a sticky rice bunch), I still enjoyed the flavor.  Keep in mind that this is island style, so the flavor is supposed to be subtle, not like the Indian rice dishes.  We used a type of Vietnamese sausage (because that's the closest I could find in our Asian market) and increased the amount, added slightly more pineapple and a little bit pineapple juice (maybe that's why it didn't fry).  I found the amount of oyster sauce to be all right, but my husband added more because he's used to more spiced dishes (I think he abused his taste buds to the point that he needs more to stimulate normal senses lol).

I love fried rice so I decided to try this and it tastes so yummy. I didn't follow the directions though, I added the beaten eggs with the rice in the pan. I used sweet soy sauce instead of the oyster because I didn't have any and I used half of the amount of pineapples because I didn't want that much in my rice. Still yummy!! :)

This was very good but I had to make a few changes based on what I had. I used white rice instead of jasmine. I used smoked sausage because it was all I had on hand. I also used half pineapple juice and half soy sauce in place of the oyster sauce. It was yum!

Tried this tonight with very few modifications. Didn't have the Chinese sausage. Increased the eggs to 5, doubled the pineapple and used more green onions. Used the "lite" Spam, as that was what we had. FABULOUS. My son and I agreed that this recipe is a total keeper. It would have been nice if there were leftovers -- there were not. We were both hungry and we devoured the whole thing.

Very good! I ended up frying the SPAM until it was crispy, which added to the flavor. I also forgot the green onion, but it was still very tasty.

I live in the south so we will eat rice for any meal. I made for breakfast and it was delicious.  I omitted the pineapples and added diced onions and it was still good.

I just made this and am eating it as I type. and I HATE rice! SO Very good. I didn't have all the right ingredients but most or similar. I didn't have the sausage and no one in my house likes pineapples so I used about a 1/4 or less of a cup of sweet and sour sauce and canned ham. My boys will be home for lunch soon and I know they will love this too. Delicious, Thanks for the entry, I love AR!

Loved this fried rice recipe, perfect with our Hawaiian grilled shrimp.  I had some bacon to use up, so I subbed that for the Spam and sausage.  I aslo added some peas.  Delicious!

Mixed reviews here.  I like that it is different from standard fried rice.   My husband thought this was o.k., but I wasn’t real crazy about it.  At first, the oyster sauce gave it an overwhelming fishy taste and smell.  We had a ton left over and when reheated as a leftover, it had a much better flavor and kind of grew on me.

Really loved this recipe!  I added diced red peppers & baby peas because my husband & I like a lot of vegetables.  Also, used brown rice & a thick slice of deli ham instead of SPAM (don't really care for SPAM).  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Next time I'm going to try it with cruched pineapple instead of chunks.  The chunks are a little too big with all the other ingredients being diced.  I agree with one of the other reviews, I'm not quite sure why more people haven't tried this.  It's great!

I used Spam Lite, and left out the sausage.  I sauteed two teaspoons of minced garlic in the oil before adding the Spam.  I also sauteed the thicker pieces of green onion, and added the lighter green top pieces at the end.  The pineapple juice & teriyaki sauce substitution that others suggested was great (my husband is not a fish fan).  Pearl rice tastes great in this!  I'm not much of a cook, but this was easy and turned out great.

I made this for a luau dinner party kind of on a flook.  I wanted to have something to incorporate spam into my theme.  It was the hit of the party.  I did leave out the chinese sausage because I couldn't find it.  I wish I could say how good it was, but it was all gone before I got a chance to eat.

This was awesome. I didn't use either of the meats (just sliced ham) and I used pineapple juice and Shoyu Chicken sauce instead of the oyster sauce (I didn't have that). It was great, even with brown rice. Thanks!!

I used chopped up left over ham and chicken instead of the meats mentioned, and leek instead of the gren onion.  I also added some chili garlic sauce - about 1 heaping t.  It was really good.

A yummy alternative to traditional fried rice.  I used portuguese sausage, diced ham, and spam.  I also added some leftover pineapple juice to the mix toward the end of cooking. Absolutely delish!

I prepared it without the pineapple (the men in my life weren't too keen on fruit with their rice) and it was delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

Thanks for the great recipe! I made this with stuff from my cupboards so it was a bit different; used Teriyaki Spam and Coconut Jasmine Rice (Uncle Bens Ready Rice, one bag coconut, one bag brown...I know...lazy, but quick, clean, and what I had). Because I had those flavors, I didn’t add any of the extra sauces. They complimented each other well and it was great. Next time I’ll try it with my Portuguese Sausage Spam! Didn’t have any onions, sausage or pineapple either... maybe next time. And I did use minced garlic with the oil instead of powdered, as I liked the idea that the most liked reviewer had mentioned about their crushed g. These tweaks actually cut it down to 454 cal for 5 one cup servings...according to my Fitness Pal app, which is another plus! Thanks again!

I used all the ingredients as stated except for the Chinese sausage (unfortunately I don’t have any Asian markets close by) and I used 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic.  It turned out great! It was very flavorful and delicious. Next time I will definitely use the Chinese sausage.

I really liked it.  Couldn't find the sausage so I added extra spam. I also think it would be better to use the tidbits pineapple instead of chunks.  I would make this again!

We made it, with canned flakes of ham instead of SPAM, and with a Johnsonville small polish sausages, and the kids absolutely loved it! The pineapple sweetness and with tasty meat surprises, made for a great flavour in the rice, and everyone was raving about it! Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

This was really good to me.  I did not have oyster sauce, but I had clam juice so I used that.  I also did not have the Chinese sausage, so I used what I had on hand which was sweet Italian sausage.

I used two cans of spam, 2 cups of rice (and more water), and added half a bag of frozen peas, carrots, corn and green beans.  I've been doing a "clear the pantry" type week of meals and this by far was the best we had and I've been asked that we make it a new go-to meal by my kids.

This is one of my favorite recipes and I've probably made it a dozen times. My guys love it.  I add a little reduced sodium soy sauce but otherwise make it exactly as written. I would like to find a green veg that could be added just so it's colorful and a bit healthier.  For all the people who skipped the Chinese sausage, it's really what makes the dish so I trek to the Asian market and stock up, it keeps for a long time.  Also aidells chicken sausage with bacon and pineapple is an okay substitute!

I used ham. I also added frozen mixed veggies. To add a little bit more flavor I put 1/4 tsp of Chinese 5 spice and a spinkle of ground ginger.  The 5 spice added just the right amount of flavor to the rice.

Great basic recipe, that changes each time I make it! When I have leftover rice, the next meal is fried rice! Whatever meat is on-hand goes into this; Spam, ham, cut-up sausage links, portuguese sausage, bacon, chicken, steak and even shrimp!
Its a great way to use up leftovers!

Delicious! Needed a dish to take to a potluck with an Asian/Hawaiian theme. So tested this out with my family today first. All agreed it was a thumbs-up and good to go for the potluck. The only thing I changed was to add more pineapple and to use the tidbits, since the can of Doke tidbits I bought was 20 oz. After draining the pineapple, I used 6 oz of the tidbits. I found the lap cheong at an Asian market and it really adds a good dimension.

I only used SPAM, and that was fine.  I sauteed a minced clove of garlic (instead of powder) and half a chopped onion with the SPAM.  I didn't have oyster sauce, so I added a little finadenne sauce (soy/vinegar mix) instead.  I also sprinkled a little bit of grated unsweetened coconut over the top at the very end and mixed it in to taste.   YUM!!

Great recipe.  Everything that has been said below is spot on.  Didn't use the pork or Spam (though I know that's what makes it Hawaiian style), but everything else was used.  I like it better personally with fried vidalia onions over the green, but that's just personal preference.  Great recipe and reminds me of Hawaii for sure.

This rice was a hit at my Hawaiian-themed surprise birthday party.  I read every single review and made a few changes and it held up well in my crock pot for several hours.  The recommendations I found helpful were to add garlic (real, not powder), use pineapple tidbits (or at least small pieces), add extra pineapple, cook rice ahead and cool on greased cookie sheet in fridge, and add green onions.  I didn't use the sausage and went with some lite Spam and some regular cooked till crispy.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I added 4 cloves minced garlic, fresh ginger, zuccini, minced carrots and bell peppers. Hot Italian sausage, turkey sausage and Spam Lite are the meats I used. It tasted just like the Hawaiian Rice I use to get in Waikiki.

Loved it! Changes I made- used soy sauce instead of oyster sauce. Used minute rice- 4 servings (was not able to properly brown it after it was prepared- so skip this step), added 1/2 cup green onions, used fresh pineapple, used diced garlic instead of garlic salt/powder, omitted the sausage. My husband absolutely loved it.

I enjoyed this recipe but did substitute the meat for Aidells Spicy Mango with Jalapeno chicken sausage, which was a fabulous complement to the pineapple.  Only complaint was the instructions say to add garlic powder but this was not listed in the ingredients.

I made this recipe while visiting Maui to go with a local-inspired meal. I used Portuguese sausage (local) rather than Chinese and a fresh Maui Gold Pineapple. Fantastic!! Traded a bowl for drinks at the bar. Thanks Chen!

I think this recipe has potential.  I think next time I may marinate the chicken in the curry sauce for a while before cooking it, also may add more curry as I thought it lacked a little in flavor.

This is one of my favorite recipes to cook anytime I have left over rice.  The key to great fried rice is to use two or three day old rice!  Whenever I use fresh rice for fried rice dishes it always seems to turn out so mushy.  I think using old rice is best because it has dried out a bit while sitting in the fridge so when you cook it the rice remains in individual grains rather than lumping together. 
Also, I have never had SPAM before this dish and loved it!  The saltiness from the SPAM and the sweetness from the pineapple really mesh well. Thank you for this recipe!

Made this last night following the directions with only a few changes.  I used a 20oz can of pineapple, swapped summer sausage for the Chinese sausage(quartered and sliced thin), and half of a sweet onion for green onions (what I had on hand). It turned out excellent! I cooked the sausage and spam together until they were almost done then added the onion and cooked until translucent. When I make it again I will only double the pineapple, it was just a bit too much for me but the kids loved it.

coming from someone who isn't big into sweet this was wonderful and a great way to use up some leftovers! halved the recipe and used leftover roasted pork in lieu of the spam and chinese sausage.. added some leftover grilled green bell pepper.. used leftover rice.. one whole egg.. 4 oz of canned pineapple rings that i chopped up.. fried the green onion instead of using it as garnish as rasmasass suggested.. since there was no exact measurement i too just sprinkled some garlic powder over the rice as it was heating up along with a light sprinkle of cayenne.. ty so much for the recipe

This was so good and super easy. I did not have spam or the other meat on the list. I did have some left over sausage. I cut it up into small pieces and it worked great in a pinch.I served with Hawaiian Chicken Kabobs from this site and black beans. Yummy will be using this again.

My family loves this recipe. If I plan on making it I make A LOT and it still gets eaten up in a day or two. I use crushed pineapple bc I don't really like to bite into chunks of pineapple. I also like fry some garlic, ginger, and whole star anise with the luncheon meat and sausage.

Loved this!  Served it to the whole family on our Cayman Island vacation after one of the kids requested fried rice.  It was a huge hit!  Subbed soy for oyster sauce and used a smoked sausage.  Yummy!
