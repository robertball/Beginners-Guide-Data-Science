Spectacular. Made it with my cooking group. Everyone loved it. Cut the crushed red pepper in half if you don't like it too spicy. Yummy!!!!

Very yummy. I added some lemon zest, which added more freshness.

This was really good. It seemed a bit heavy on the oil, so I cut it back by 1/4 and replaced it with rice wine vinager. I also added 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 or 2 extra pinches of red pepper flakes (we like it spicy). Delish, not a bean left in the bowl!

Super easy!!! and delicious! took this to a family party and everyone loved it. Definitely not too spicy, even my aunt who is scared of salsa ate some and liked it. My uncle liked the sauce so much he dipped bread in what was left in the bowl when the beans were gone. I think I'm going to try it with asparagus tomorrow.
Thanks for sharing

I'm not a big green bean fan, but my CSA box from the farmer's market included nearly a pound of green beans, and so I was looking for something easy to do with them.  Both my husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much, so much that I'm hoping we get more green beans in our box next week.  I'm also thinking about trying this with broccoli, so that I can learn to like it too.

Excellent!  I used less olive oil as I wanted a lighter feel and added some ginger for a nice asian kick to go with the sesame seeds.  Very tasty and light side dish.

Way too many sesame seeds and red pepper was overpowering (and I like spicy food...)

Other than using leftover cooked green beans from last night's supper, I did everything as directed. It was a fast addition to the meal and the family ate every bit of it. Very good.

We really enjoyed these beans.  The dressing was not too heavy and really added a lot of flavor.  It was a good "cool" salad and so easy to make.

Followed the suggestion to reduce the pepper flakes by half as I'm not into heat.  May cut them back even more, if I make again, but they *do need to be there*.  There are flavor tones in the flakes and the sesame seeds that holds hands really well.  Serving suggestion: use to jazz up pasta. I mixed it in with some penne and added some butter, as I was eating it hot.  For a pasta salad I'm sure that increasing the olive oil/lemon juice mix a tad would work just fine.

Delicious! I only used 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil and I added about a tablespoon of teriyaki sauce to it. My family ate the whole thing! I might decrease the amount of sesame seeds next time, but this is a great recipe!

Perfect side for Asian dishes! And unique usage for fresh green beans. Great when the thought "one more piece of lettuce and I'm going to scream!" hits you.

Made this for Thanksgiving and loved the tangy flavor!  Would like to try this with other beans and greens like snow peas.

We really liked this a lot.  I cut back quite a bit on the red pepper as spicy foods don't agree with me.

This didn't turn out very well for me.  Maybe I made it too far ahead of time - the beans all got pretty sad looking by the time I served it.

This didn't quite have enough flavor for me. I tasted the dressing before it went on the green beans, and it was pretty good, but there wasn't enough of it. If I make it again, I'll double the dressing. Also, I did use some soy sauce in place of the salt.

I have never been crazy about green beans because they are generally boiled too long and become mushy and tasteless. This salad is really refreshing and the flavors are complex and delicious. There is just enough garlic and spice without being too spicy, and the lemon juice makes it taste very fresh. Like others, I reduced the olive oil to 1 tablespoon and found that to be enough.

This was a great salad. I served it refrigerator-cold. I cooked the beans, toasted the seeds, and mixed the dressing ahead of time. I mixed the salad together only abour 10 minutes before serving. Great taste. I doubled the sesame seeds and next time I would add a little dash of soya sauce to the dressing. Overall it was really good!

I added salt to the water to boil the beans in.
For "southern grown green beans" that are already tender I cook them in salted water for 1 minute and then drain.  
I cut the red pepper in half as my family doesn't like it very spicy.

Wow! I didn't particularly like green beans before this recipe. I found some purple ones at a farmers' market and gave this recipe a try. Since I was feeding a toddler, I omitted the crushed pepper. These were a big hit. So easy, so yummy. Now I am craving green beans!
