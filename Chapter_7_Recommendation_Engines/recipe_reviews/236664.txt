Basic simple recipe that can be tweaked to ones tastes. For a nice fish dish I added some scallops, mushrooms, diced red peppers, parsley and Mrs. Dash citrus seasoning.  Goes well with any type of pasta.

Excellent.  I added some lemon pepper (the real thing!) Otherwise didn't change a thing. My adult son who is very particular loved it.

This was sooooo simple...and crazy delicious!   I used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 2.  I used Classico sauce instead of Barilla.  I did not add the fresh basil, only because I didn't have any on hand.  Don't FORGET to add the pepper flakes.  They gave the sauce a little zing...and I do mean little.  I served this over rigato pasta with steamed broccolli and garlic bread with cheese.
