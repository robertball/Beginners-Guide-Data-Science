What a great idea! I tested this out for inclusion in my Christmas Eve dinner. Made it in the morning and placed in the refigerator, covered in plastic wrap, on a baking sheet. Removed from fridge 1 hour before baking, brushed with egg wash just before baking, and that's all there is to it. It looked beautiful sliced (used a red and a green pepper), and tasted delicious. The only change I will make on Christmas Eve is to use a different cheese. The stringiness of the mozzarella can be difficult to handle, and I think a stronger tasting cheese would add even more to the wonderful flavour. Highly recommended for entertaining. Thanks!

The first time I made this, I found it to be a little bland. Since then, I have added a generous helping of Italian seasoning and some crushed red pepper when cooking the vegetables, and sometimes I also include some hot Italian sausage. In addition, I now serve it with marinara sauce to which I have added a little cream and crushed red pepper for a kick. It was a big hit at Thanksgiving.

We had this as part of our Christmas Eve dinner this year. The flavor was exceptional! (Use the red pepper; I think green would take it in a different direction that would not be as good.) My only complaint: leftovers don't re-heat too well, so serve as a main dish (rather than as a side dish) where it will be finished.

it was okay. I made it just like it states. There wasn't to much flavor. Probably won't make again.
