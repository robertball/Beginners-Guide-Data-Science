I followed the recommendation of a previous poster and brined the chicken (always brine the chicken, anyway).  Used about 2 T lime juice and a handful of cilantro - blended all into a Vita-Mix (though a blender would work as well).  Phenomenal!

The key to this is soak the chicken in salt water for an hour.  This seasons the chicken and keeps it juicy.  The marinade is excellent!

The chicken that comes from this brine is juicy and delicious. The only change I made was to extend the chicken's soak in the lime/pineapple/water mixture. Let it go most of the day, pulled it out, grilled it, and it was great.

I did not add all the water and I did not have saffron. I did use smoked black pepper, I also doubled the amount of juices. This is the best chicken it is really tender and flavorful. It is very forgiving I converted the the recipe for 30 and it still worked great I still used less water.

we cut the chicken into chunks, used real lime, doubled the saffron b/c ours was a bit old, and rather than marinating, we cooked the chicken directly in the marinade. we added a bit of corn starch and put it over rice. Very tasty!

I love this recipe. I did as other suggested and cut the water and salt in half, or just double everything except the water and salt. I've marinated from a couple hours to a day and it's great.
