Delicious well balanced goodness. I put mine over undressed coleslaw and they went very well together.

Made as written and this turned out pretty good. The tinglin from the wasabi definitely sneaks up on you. I made this for a dinner salad but think it would be better as a dressing for slaw. Good recipe and one I would make again.

Wonderful!! Just enough zip to it without being burning. Of course the wasabi can be adjusted to suit the eaters tastes.
