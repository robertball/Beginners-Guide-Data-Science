I'm making creamed spinach tonight and you can bet IF I have any leftovers they'll be used for this!  :)

I made it with this recipe and it tasted delicious. My two-year-old daughter also said it tasted good.

This is an awesome quick and easy weeknight dinner recipe.  And I actually make my own version of creamed spinach with a 10 oz box of chopped spinach, a couple shakes of garlic powder, a cup of mayonnaise, and a 1/2 cup of sour cream or 4 oz of softened cream cheese.  Then I added a tsp of horseradish which gives it a little zing.  It's also great on English muffins!

I didn't have creamed spinach so I sauted the spinach in a pan with spices and oil and piled it with parmesan then put it on the already toasted bread. it was delicious!
