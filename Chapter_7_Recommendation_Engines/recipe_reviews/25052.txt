Very good cookies. I added peanut butter chips. My only suggestion would be to bake at 375 for 10 minutes (instead of 12-15 as suggested in the recipe) to ensure a chewy cookie -- after being in the oven for 10 minutes, my cookies had a slightly crunchy edge with a chewy center. All in all, very good!!

THIS IS THE PERFECT PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE!
I've tried ALOT of recipes, and this is the very best! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. I did divide the dough and added milk chocolate chips with peanut butter chips to some of it and butterscotch chips to some. Those were great too as well as the cookies without chips. You don't have to refrigerate this dough at all, it's ready to use as soon as you make it. Good job!! I would give this 10 or more stars if possible!

Delicious cookies. I couldn't stop eating them, even as soon as they came out of the oven. I found that baking them for ONLY 10 minutes at 375 was sufficient enough, too.

Cook the cookies for 10 minutes.  Dip a fork in water then in white sugar to flatten slightly.  This method works much better than flour on the fork.  Sprinkle white sugar on top of the cookies as soon as they are taken out of the oven.

No problems, issues or criticisms. This is a basic, classic peanut butter cookie. Nothing extraordinary about it other than there are no problems or issues with the recipe - and in my mind, that's a good thing.  I added a little salt to make the flavor come alive, just shy of 1/2 teaspoon.  Rather than margarine, which I never use, I substituted half butter and half shortening. What I particularly liked about this recipe is that while most peanut butter cookie recipes call for equal amounts of fat and peanut butter, this one calls for a smidge more peanut putter.  I rolled the dough balls in granulated sugar, then pressed the criss-cross pattern into the cookie with more granulated sugar rather than flour.  They came out of the oven shaped pretty much the same way they went in - no surprises, which is also a good thing.  The cookie has a light texture and is slighty crispy.  These are rather small cookies, so I might consider making the dough balls bigger for a more generous-sized cookie.

DURING THE TIME OF MAKING THIS RECIPE I WAS PREGNANT, AND I FOUND IT TO BE INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS! I DID REDUCE THE TIME OF BAKING BY 3-4 MINUTES. COOKIES ARE SO SOFT AND CHEWY! THANKS

These cookies have definitely been around for a long time.  My grandmother's recipe (which is almost identical to this one) yeilds a good cookies.  The criss-cross pattern on top is a traditional must and to make it an even more sweet treat, drop a hershey's kiss in the center half way through baking time.

This is a wonderful basic peanut butter cookie recipe. It took me nearly half an hour that didnt have special ingredients. I thought I was going to have to buy a Cookbook! I tried some variations, I baked them in mini muffin pans with Hersheys chocolate inside, I put Hersheys kisses on top, and finally, I made the tiniest balls and put a single semi-sweet chocolate chip on... Great recipie! Everything worked!

These turned out really good.  Perfect balance between the peanut butter and sugar tastes.  They were light but still chewy..the way I like them.
I used my mini muffin pan and baked for about 5 min.  then i smashed them down and put in a peanut butter cup candy in the "tart".  My boyfriend put chocolate chips in some too.  I used the leftover dough to make the plain ol cookies.  All were wonderful.  I highly recommend this recipe.  The best part is you don't have to refrigerate it..mix it up and there you go.

I loved this cookie, but I made some changes based on other reviews and my preference.  The cookies had alot of flavor.  They held their shape well and were lighter than some other recipes.  I used unsalted butter instead of margarine, increased vanilla to 1 tsp, added 1/2 tsp. salt, and used Extra Crunchy Jif.  I refrigerated the dough overnight.  It needs to be refrigerated for at least an hour - more is better.  I scooped the dough with a soup spoon, made it into a ball, dipped the top in sugar, and then inprinted with a fork to make the criss-cross pattern on the top.  I baked at 350 instead of 375 - 12 minutes was the perfect time for the size of cookies I made.

It is a good recipe. I am not a fan of peanut butter cookie, but I made them for my husband and he really likes them. The are soft anf chewy and the batter is light and tastes great. I left half of mine plain and the other half I melted milk chocolate in a candy bottle and drizzled chocolate on top.

These were pretty good. I prefer a less sweet, more peanutty cookie myself, but my boyfriend was wanting something a little more classic. These worked out well. I did use real butter instead of margarine. I also doubled the size of the dough balls, and coated them in sugar before pressing the crosshatch on top. I kept the baking time at 12 minutes, but reduced the temp to about 365. They came out very evenly done and stored well.

This recipe is great.  I did need to add a little more flour but I think because I used butter instead of margarine.  I also put my thumbprint in them and added some mini chips and some I did jelly.  They tasted just like a PB&J sandwich.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a good peanut butter cookie for people who like softer cookies. Perfect with a glass of ice cold milk. Taste improves the longer you let them sit.

I did this recipe almost exactly as stated. Only thing I did differently was added maybe 1/4 cup of flour and some chopped peanuts.  I baked them at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes and they're really good! They could be a touch more peanuttier (is that really a word?) but they're very good.  I have added this to my recipes and will definitely make them again.

These are extremely good cookies! My husband begged me to make some peanut butter cookies, so I used this recipe. What a keeper! The only problem is that my husband and I won't stop eating them. Didn't alter a thing on the recipe either.

Another family favorite! Made a good amount of cookies and they are not too sweet like some recipes. Perfect for our taste. Dipped the fork in sugar also when pressing them. I also had a half of a bag of Heath toffee chips so I threw those into the last half of the dough. It was really good too! Thank you Anita for this recipe that reminds me of the PB cookies I made as a little girl with my mother.

These were pretty good, but ended up kind of dry and crumbly, and didn't have as strong of a peanut butter flavor as I like. Not quite what I was looking for.

These were a big hit with my son.  He must have eaten a dozen right out of the oven and my husband loved them too.  I did alter the recipe a bit.  I used real butter instead of margarine and added 1/4 cup flour.  Then I cut the cooking temperature back to 350 degrees and cooked the cookies about 8-10 minutes. I used cooling racks lined with wax paper.  They turned out perfect. Will use this again.

Very good! Only thing I did different was I used natural peanut butter, added chocolate chips, and instead of margarine (didn't have any) I used half butter and half coconut oil. I can taste a hint of coconut which is nice but the cookies are amazing anyway :)

Very good.  I found it helpful to put dough in freezer for about 10-15 minutes to help it get less sticky.  Can chill in fridge too, I've made dough a day ahead and put in fridge. I dip my fork in sugar before making criss cross as it helps the fork from sticking. I bake at 350 for about 11 minutes.  Co-workers loved them!!! Next time may add chocolate chips.

Good Basic Peanut Butter Cookie, I was just hoping for bit more peanut butter flavor. I think next time, (They are definitely good enough to give them a second chance) I will add 2 cups of peanut butter and maybe either butter instead of margarine or a bit more vanilla.  They were a bit floury for my taste.  Definitely shorten the baking times as written unless you like yours crunchy and toasted.

Very good peanut butter cookies. I did not quite yield  54 cookies or 4 1/2 dozen cookies; I ended up with 40 cookies or 3 dozen and 4 cookies. I baked them for 10 minutes (almost 11 minutes) for softer cookies; for slightly crispier cookies I would suggest baking them longer intervals at 12 to 15 minutes. Some batches I left in the oven a little longer to crisp them up a bit more for those in my family who like crunchier cookies. The next time I make these I will make a note to roll the cookie dough into larger size balls to make a slightly larger size cookie (personal preference).  A nice balance between the peanut butter, butter and flour measurement. Cookies tasted very peanutty! Just how I like them.

I'm not sure why they didn't turn out great.  The peanut butter taste wasn't very strong.

I have made these two ways - traditional with the criss-cross on top and by making "drop" cookies and adding peanut butter chips to the cookie dough.  Both ways are fantastic!  Very good recipe.  Thank you!

These are one of those rare cookies that I can NOT put down, no matter how many I eat.  Crispy edges, soft middle.  My husband ate one dozen in a sitting.  I think I won't make these again any time soon, but only because we will go into a sugar coma if I do!

I'm eating a cookie as I type, accompanied by a cup of green tea...yummm.  These are very good.  I used crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth because that's what my husband likes.  I will definitely make these again.

5 star.  I made these cookies because my grandson loves peanut butter cookies.  I don't think there's very many left.  This is a saver & will print it out.  Thanks Anita.

This was a perfect recipe for homemade peanut butter cookies.  Some changes that can be made to it is the use of crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy and I had some extra candy corns from Halloween and I placed one in the center of each cookie prior to baking and the kids absolutely loved them!  Another thing for the adults, you can place a pecan half in the center of each cookie as well.  A lovely holiday treat, this is!

Wow!  Usually peanut butter cookies are crumbly and a bit dry.  These are awesome!  I added a half a package of peanut butter chips, and substituted butter for margarine (that's just what I had.)  I'll definitely make these again.

OK folks listen up.  The search for the perfect peanut butter cookie ends here.  So, it's 3:26 p.m. on Valentine's Day, and I am feeling extremely lame because I do NOT have a gift for my husband.  I run to the computer, pull up allrecipes.com, and find this quick and easy recipe for his very favorite kind of cookie.  I say to myself, why not?  So I whip these cookies together in record time, and he is happily eating a delicious peanut butter cookie at 4:07 p.m!  It doesn't get much better than that!  Note - I cut the ingredients in half, just because I didn't want to make 54 cookies!  I melted the butter, even though the recipe did not say to do so.  I only baked them for 10 minutes, and they were perfect!  I highly recommend them if you have to give a gift, and only have half-an-hour to come up with the perfect valentine!  Enjoy!! :)

These were the Best, I did not change a thing.I searched the web to find a recipe that used butter, vanilla, brown sugar. and both soda and baking powder, I knew this recipe would be great, and I liked this one because I did not have to refrigerate the dough. this is the one I will always use, Thanks for this recipe, Joyce

Good recipe.  I followed it EXACTLY as it was written.  It is a very light cookie... not as chewy as I would have hoped.  I did not bake as long.  I only baked mine for 10 minutes.  I think this recipe is meant to attract those who like a more crispy cookie.  I prefer a bit more dense, as well as a soft and chewy texture.  Still a decent, easy recipe.  Not quite what I was looking for though.  Thanks!

These are soooo yummy!  They were a little crunchy around the outside and slightly soft in the middle, just the way a peanut butter cookie should be! The only change I might make next time is to lower the amount of the sugars but that is because I like my cookies to be more peanut buttery than sweet.

If you like the cakey kind of cookies, these are OK.  This batter was so gooey that I couldn't roll it into balls like the recipe said, and the only substitution I made was using crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy.  Maybe that did it, but I still prefer the more traditional version of PB cookies.

This was an really good recipe.  The only thing that i did extra was after making the dough into a walnut sized ball. i rolled it into a mix of granulated and brown sugar for extra sweetness. i also added about a 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

This recipe is awesome!  My husband loves peanut butter cookies, so I was on the lookout for a recipe that he would really enjoy.  I definitely found it.  These cookies were peanut buttery, just the right consistency, and very yummy.  I added chocolate chips to some, peanut butter chips to some, and left some plain.  The plain ones were the best!  Many thanks to the author for sharing this wonderful recipe.

These turned out amazing! i added about 1/2 cup more peanut butter and also mixed in some chopped white and milk chocolate bakers rounds. I rolled the dough into balls and rolled them in white sugar before baking. I did not press them down. I baked for 10 minutes only and they came out just right! nice and soft in the center and crispy golden brown. AMAZING. the recipe made the 4.5 dozen promised. just yummy! theyre already gone and my boyfriend has requested them for his lunches (as have many of our guests). thanks so much for sharing :)

Excellent tasting cookie. Remind me of my Mom's. However 375 a bit too high a temp to bake them at. I would'nt go any higher than 350.

This is a terrific recipe! My boys LOVE them! The only difference is that I add a whole tsp. of vanilla and when I roll the balls I dip the top half in sugar and then the fork doesn't stick. Actually my boys use the fork and they LOVE it!

Without a doubt the BEST recipe for peanut butter cookies I've tried so far....I used Butter Flavored Crisco instead of margarine and added mini chocolate chips to the recipe .  Criss-crossed the cookies with a fork dipped in sugar and used a cookie scoop.  Baked for 10 minutes....These cookies are beyond "awesome" if you love peanut butter cookies...THANKS SO MUCH for sharing this wonderful recipe...its a keeper for sure.

Great taste, but they came out very crispy at this temperature, almost like storebought.  I did my last batch for 9 minutes at 350 and they were nice and chewy.

These cookies are fantastic! I followed the advice of some others and shortened the cooking time to 10 minutes. Other that that, I followed the recipe exactly and they tasted great! The peanut butter taste is just enough-not too overpowering. They are sweet but not too sweet. Just perfect!

Awesome!  These are the perfect peanut butter cookie.  Still soft and yummy 2 days later (surprised there are any left, but there are only 2 of us). Makes about 2 dozen large cookies.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This PB cookie turned out great...even though I messed up the recipe :) I used brown sugar Splenda and totally forgot that you only need 1/2 the sugar. Oops...they tasted great, even with extra sugar. The amount of PB evened it out.

I found that if you use 1/2 cup of butter they seem fluffier than normal. Also in stead of useing flour on your fork to use sugar!

Lighter, fluffy, soft peanut butter cookie. Dough seemed almost like a whipped texture. Used fork dipped in flour. Baked at 350 degrees for 11 minutes on baking stone, then let set up for two minutes before removing from baking stone and transferring to cooling rack. Not too sweet. Liked that I could bake these right away and not wait for the dough to chill in the refrigerator.

I have a recipe that I alwasy use and it's sweeter than this recipe. This definatly had more of a peanuty taste. The only changes I made was I used half creamy peanut butter and half chunky peanut butter b/c I like the peanut chunks in the cookie. I also used sugar to dip my fork in instead of the flour and I only cooked it for 9 mins.. 12 min was definatly too long in my oven I almost burnt my first batch. I like softer cookies and 9 mins was PERFECT! I personally like the sweeter recipe but these are definatly good too. I will keep this recipe in my collection for those who like thiers more peanuty. Thanks!

These cookies were good, but not fabulous.  I just didn't think they had a strong peanut butter taste and that something was missing (salt).

I used 3/4cup smooth and 3/4cup chunky peanut butter. I also made half with chocolate chips. I read the suggestions from others and reduced baking time to 10 minutes, and they were still a bit crispy. They tasted delicious!!! But I like my cookies chewy.

I love peanut butter cookies and this was a great recipe. Its simple, tastes great and makes alot! I found if I left them in for the time suggested the bottoms got too dark, so I just kept and eye on them and took them out when they were slightly golden. Great recipe!

these turned out ok I melted the margarine in the microwave before I mixed. this helped with the dryness. the cookie dough was dry and hard to form cookies and fell apart while cooking when I did not melt the margarine.

This recipe just didn't do it for me.  The dough was fairly greasy and difficult to work with even after sitting in the freezer for awhile.  I baked for 10 minutes as suggested by other reviews, and the final result was just plain, cakey cookies.  Maybe more peanut butter would've helped the overall flavor and texture.  They are edible, but just not what I was looking for.  I will probably not use this recipe again.

This is a good cookie. The recipe is also very versatile and forgiving. With all baking one must be precise. But this recipe can accommodate those of us who like to eyeball certain things. In my case it was the butter. I scaled the recipe and forgot that only 1/3 C was needed but I used the whole stick. The lack of a 5th star comes from there needing to be a little more sweetness from the sugars.

OMG!! These are just PERFECT!!  The right amount of peanut butter flavor but not over powering.  I added Chocolate chips to this recipe and it was absolutely out-of-this-world.

The Best Ever.  If you like Peanut Butter Cookies you will love these for sure.  I did put the temp at 375 and cooked for 11 minutes. For my oven that seemed the best. TY for putting it online!

I made these with margerine once and with butter once...definitely think margerine is the way to go, unless you like harder cookies...either way they were very easy to prepare and yummy.

Good cookie, but I reduced the cooking time to 8-10min.  With the first batch I tried 12 min and they were too hard for me.  I see others recommended reducing the temperature which might work also.  I love a really soft cookie so at about 8 min, after they cool they come out perfect.  Thanks

I like a short cookie so these were just perfect. I did add a pinch of salt. They didn't last very long at our house! I highly recommend using parchment paper when baking them.

I liked how the cookies were firmer then other peanut butter cookies that I have made. I think cooking them for 12 mins is better then 15 mins.

It just contained TOO much butter for our liking. We also experienced problems with the baking time. Even after adjusting the bake time to 8 mins, we still managed to burn the edges of the cookies. We will not be using this recipe again to make PB Cookies. Sorry...

used 1/2c reg. splenda & 1/4c. white sugar and 3/4c splenda brown; 1t vanilla and added 1/4c chopped peanuts [could use crunchy peanut butter] 8oz baker's peanut butter cups (well almost 8oz ;} ) they seemed very greasy to handle, but these came out better than great! (shiny stainless steel cookie sheets work great for these)

These cookies were great although I agree that they have more of a shortbread texture than I expected (around the edges).  I increased the peanut butter slightly and cooked them at 350 for 10 minutes as suggested by other reviewers.

Excellent cookies!  I did use softened butter instead of margarine, and I only cooked for 8 minutes at 350 (or 9 minutes without the criss-cross on top), because I like these cookies chewy.

Watch the baking time - I found the suggested 12-15 was much too long.  More like 8-9 minutes. Otherwise great peanut butter cookie!

My only complaint is that the cookies flattened out a LOT more than I expected.  But they were delicious--crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside.  I'll use it over and over again.

My husband loves this recipe!!  The cookies are not soft!! I've been looking for a peanut butter cookie that is crunchy for 3 years!!  This one is the best!!!  The only change I made is I used crunchy peanut butter for added texture.  I also used butter instead of margarine

I made a complete blunder and went by the recipe and used margarine. I had qualms doing so, but did anyway. This was a mistake because they came out absolutely flavorless. And this is coming from someone who loves peanut butter cookies! On top of that, our margarine we have on hand is Country Crock Light, so it left out even more flavor than regular margarine would. 
If I were to make this again, I will use unsalted butter or butter-flavored Criso. DO NOT use margarine in this recipe! I'd probably also add some pecans, walnuts or macadamia nuts to it as well. One good thing about this recipe is that it made a whole lot considering the small amount of peanut butter used.

Just made these and they are just divine!! 4 stars because i add a little salt as i was using unsalted butter and replace 1/4 cup of creamy peanut buter with a chunky one. I could not stop eating them. When cooled completely, these babies were crispy on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside... Mmmmmmm! Am still munching on these as i write this review. Thank you for sharing :)

These turned out great. I baked for 12 minutes and rolled the balls in white sugar before I pressed a fork on them. I also pressed Hershey kisses into them right out of the oven.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had!  When I need a large amount of cookies I make these.  I usually add milk chocolate chips and they are to die for!  Or I roll them in sugar.  Always bake at 350 on parchment paper for about 8 minutes.

Very good Classic PB Cookie!  Only Modification: Used 1.5 cups of PB as I am not shy with PB flavor.  Plus I used these to make PB Blossom Cookies (i.e. the cookie with the hershey kiss on top) so I wanted the cookie to hold together a bit more (sometimes PB cookies can be more crumbly) --- baked my PB blossoms 9 minutes = perfect!

I made these cooking for the first time tonight and I have to say they are perfect!!  I followed the recipe to  the letter and I don't think they could have come out any more perfect!  The batter for these cookies was so smooth and it wasn't too runny or too dry, just the way it should be.  I used a cookie scoop so the balls were all the same size and I didn't even have to flour or sugar the fork before pressing them down.  I didn't quite need to put them 2 inches apart because they only spread a little bit.  They keep their shape very well.  My oven took 16 mins to cook them at 375 but when I took them out they looked slightly under done and when I let them sit for 5 mins as the recipe says, the finished cooking right on the cookie sheet.  Golden crispy edges and soft centres.  So yummy!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I love this recipe. I ususally add a lil more peanut butter and I add more flour by the spoon full until the dough is not sticky. Grab my tableapoon and measure it out and smash my balls down with a fork dipped in sugar and bake them for 10 min. I actually make them for my family because I hate peanut butter but I find myself sneaking them every once in awhile. VERY YUMMY!!!

Great basic recipe. I made the original batch and added different toppings to each: Hershey's Kisses, mini Peanut Butter Cups, chocolate chips, and regular old pressed cookies. Each was slightly different, but equally delicious. Great, easy recipe!

I can't imagine what I did wrong, but these didn't turn out at all. A very floury, non-peanut buttery taste.

These cookies were yummy, but I've had better. 12-15min is definitely too long to cook these. I would suggest 8-10min.

I love everything about this recipe except the baking temp.! I baked my cookies at 375 for 9 minutes and they burned! Not terribly bad but enough to have black bottoms. Next time I will try 350 and check on them until they look done to figure out a bake time.

These were good.  They had a great texture, not hard and crunchy.  My parents thought they were GREAT!!! My dad couldn't stop eating them.  I gave them only 4 stars because they weren't sweet enough for me. But everyone else raved about them!

These cookies were delicious! They didn't take very long to make, and were a very simple recipe. I would also recommend you cook them for about 10 minutes instead of 12 for a more chewy cookie, but they were still amazing. I will definitely make these again.

First time I've made peanut butter cookies other than with my grandma. They turned out great!!!! Only change I made was I used about 1/3 cup crunchy peanut butter (just to use up what I had) and the rest creamy peanut butter.

This cookie was missing its peanut butter taste. Otherwise, it was excellent. Maybe I didn't use a good brand of peanut butter. The cookie tasted like a sweet sugar cookie minus frosting. Tips: An 18 oz. jar of PB has about 1 5/8 cups of PB. Butter works well in place of margarine.

Made exactly as written. Dry! I don't care how many times you roll them in sugar, then sprinkle them with sugar, then dance around in the kitchen throwing sugar everywhere. These suckers are dry.

This is an excellent recipe. I made them 3 days ago and they're still soft and chewy. Be careful not to overcook them. I cook them just until the bottoms start to brown.

Really good recipe.  I followed it exactly.  Makes big cookies.  Dough easy to work with and freezes well too.  Some said they were too crumbly I didn't find that at all.

Perfect and very easy! I love them so much and so does my family. Definitely will be using this recipe often. I did put my oven on 350 degrees and cooked them for 10 minutes only. They turned out so good.

These cookies were exactly what I wanted!  Very good.  My whole family loved them.  It always drives me bonkers when people mess with the recipe without trying the original recipe first rather than tweaking it later, but I will say that I noticed there was no salt so I added 1/2 tsp, but obviously based on the reviews nobody has been missing it, so I don't know if it made any difference at all.  I also baked them only 9-10 minutes instead of 12 (but used a very small Pampered Chef icecream scoop to measure my cookies) after letting them sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes they were out of this world! Thank you so much for sharing!  We will definitely make these again.

These are delicious!  However, I only baked mine for 8 minutes because I like them soft and chewy.  At 12 minutes, mine were real crunchy.  I can't imagine what 15 minutes would have been like.

Wonderful cookies! Delicious right out of the oven with a cold glass of milk. The dough whips up in no time flat. I used real butter, not margarine. I also took them out at 11 minutes - 12 is a little too long.

Were good, light and fluffy. I am not a huge peanut butter person but had a craving. This was good enough to satisfy my taste. However, if I was looking for a really peanut buttery cookie, this would not do it. Stayed soft for about a week after.

These are the best! Crispy and chewy at the same time. Instead of margarine, I used 2 T butter, 4 T butter flavored shortening, and 6 T flax meal. Might substitute even more flax next time. Made half of the batch with bittersweet chocolate chips, but I think I prefer without the chocolate.

These are a lighter, airy version of peanut butter cookies.  Almost a shortbread hydbrid with a fainter peanut butter taste.  I like the denser, more peanut buttery tasting variety.

This is the best pb cookie I have ever made! It was very easy to make and looks wonderful! I just made some and my last batch is in the oven. This is a very versatile pb cookie recipe you can do a lot with this recipe. I will definately make these again. Thank you! I did add extra pb due to the fact that my family loves pb and the usual pb recipes just dont taste like pb but my family loves these and I will definately be making them a lot more now. Thank You!

I didn't like these; they didn't have any flavor and if you cook them even 30 seconds too long, they are rock hard. I made them because so many people said it was a great recipe but I like cookies with flavor and these peanut butter cookies were very bland. I would not recommend this recipe.

This recipe baked perfectly but the cookies weren't peanut-buttery enough for my taste I think next time I will use fresh ground chunky peanut butter next time and add peanut butter chips.

Wonderful peanut butter cookie with old fashion taste.  It only took ten minutes for mine to start to slightly brown on the edges.  By taking them out then they remained chewy.  Great recipe!!

I really want to love these, I do. However, the dough just wasn't coming together making for a very dry and crumbly mess. I had a difficult time forming balls and putting the criss-cross shape into them with a fork. I read someone's review to dip the fork in cold water beforehand, but that still didn't work for me. I don't know what I did wrong as I followed the recipe to a 't'. On the upside at least they were soft, chewy and not too sweet!

I will say these were good cookies, but they werent addicting or anything.  They had that bland cafeteria peanut butter cookie taste. My kids ate them though.  I added 1 cup of chopped peanuts to them. I think I may stick with my 3 ingredient peanut butter cookie recipe.

I made these for Christmas and my husband and daughter loved them!  I added mini chocolate chips to have of the batch (yum) and I also used reduced fat peanut butter, since it is all that I keep on hand.  I am baking another batch as I type this and they smell soooo good!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought these cookies were pretty bland and I even added more peanut butter than required.  I was disappointed because I really was in the mood for some good peanut butter cookies and quite frankly it was a waste of my ingredients.

Great cookie, but much better with eggs! Hahaha...I was having one of those days and took the first batch out and thought that they looked really dry and hard when I turned around to see the eggs sitting on the counter! :)

This recipe was really really good...I am making them for my boyfriends family, so I was a bit nervous, but they came out really well, and it was my first time making peanut butter cookies.  I added a hershey kiss to the top and just skipped the criss cross part...simply delicious.

I used this recipe to make Peanut Blossoms with Hershey Kisses.  I rolled them into balls, then into sugar.  I baked them for 10 minutes, and then pressed a kiss into each cookie.  I baked an additional minute and then cooled.  They came out really good, flaky from the butter, but still soft and chewy.  I ran out of kisses so I made a few traditional "criss cross" peanut butter cookies but 10 minutes was too long and they got a bit dark.  They were flaky, but not soft at all.  Still tasted good, but if I ever make traditional cookies with this recipe, I'd bake for 8 minutes or so to get a softer cookie.

These cookies are the best cookies ever. My mom who is not big on peanut butter cookies ate them up real fast. She even wanted me to make more. Instead of making the criss cross pattern on top I baked them as a ball shape then halfway through I pushed a hershey kiss in the middle of them and baked them the rest of the way.

This recipe is pretty good.  I baked them only 10 minutes as everyone else has suggested and they turned out just right.  I was expecting the cookies to be a bit more chewy & soft though.  This is a good recipe, but it still doesn't beat the Flourless Peanut Butter Cookie recipe on this site....and it's only 3 ingredients!

I just baked these and I can't stop eating them!! I did them just the way it said, but I baked them for 10 min. and added just about a 1/2 tsp or so of cinnimon to the flour mixture before adding it to the other mixture. OMG, these are perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

I cannot believe they came out as good as they did. I used organic pb with no extra sugar or anything and they are just spectacular. I also didnt have any baking powder, but that really didn't seem to make much of a difference. Thank you!

cut the flour back to 1 1/2 cups and then add 1/2 teaspoon salt, 


i tried this recipe as is and it was awful, i would only use this as a very very last resort.

its dry and dense,  but with the added change/variatommisions, it did turn out great

This was so easy to make. I made them for my daughter's K-5 class. They loved them! I used 1 cup creamy peanut butter and 1/4 cup crunchy instead of all creamy. I also took the advice of others and cooked for 10-11 minutes. Just until the edges began to brown. They turned out great! I will definitely make them again.

Good cookie.  I tried a variation for this recipe.  I used 1.25 cup of soynut butter instead of peanut butter.  I also added a 1/4 tsp of Almond Extract to give it a little more nutty flavor.  You can't even tell I didn't use real peanut butter!  I too baked it for only 10 minutes and they came out in perfect texture.

These cookies didn't last long.  My boyfriend told me not to make them again, because he can't leave them alone.  The only things I had to change was the time I baked them for - baking for 12 minutes made the bottoms too dark, and they were too crispy.  I baked them for 8 minutes and they were nice and chewy. I also rolled mine in sugar before baking them so they were more like my Grandma's peanut butter cookie. Perfect peanut butter cookie.

The were not the moist peanut butter cookies I was hoping for.  They are definitely on the crisp and dry side.  I used unsalted butter and crunchy, sugar free peanuts-only peanut butter.  The flavor of the cookie was good, but they could have been a little more peanut buttery.  Not too sweet, which I like.  After 8 minutes at 375, cookies were still raw.  10 minutes, browned at the edges and slightly crispy.  12 minutes, a little more crispy and a little more brown.  My search for a good peanut butter cookie recipe continues...

Very disappointing.  Even though I cooked these the proper amount of time (which is way less than this recipe calls for), they came out dry and crumbly.  I'll keep searching for the perfect recipe.

These were good! I didnt have margarine (dont use it) so I substituted 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of Shedd's Spread. I also added some diced cashew's since my husband wanted some chunks of nuts in his PB cookies. He said I could make them again, but wanted more peanut butter flavor next time...just his personal taste. I was also THRILLED that the number of cookies turned out to be EXACTLY what is stated on the recipe...that's never happened to me before! My only complaint was that in my oven, 12 minutes was perfect...but only for the first 2 batches...the rest were not as chewy as I'd have liked. But overall a great recipe...thanks!

Not the flavor and texture I've been looking for since I lost my mom's recipe 3 years ago... I'm beginning to think I am just too picky about peanut butter cookies...

Thank you so much for this recipe. This is by far my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe to use we make them all the time. The only thing I do is I add a bag of peanut butter chips to the recipe because we just love the extra kick of peanut butter. THANKS SO MUCH for sharing this deleightful recipe. 5*****

I followed this recipe to the letter, but it came out to cake like for me. I found that it kept falling apart. Didn't like it at all. I wanted more of a peanut butter taste. Put a whole 28 oz. bottle of peanut butter in there, but still did not have a big peanut butter taste. My kids however loved it.

Pretty good, I cooked at 350 for 9 minutes and they still turned out a bit crispy. I prefer a chewier cookie, but if you like crispy cookies this one is for you :)

I just made a batch of these cookies and oh my, they are just about the best pb cookies I have ever made. I used whole wheat flour and added 1/4 cup wheat germ to make them a bit more healthy. Since wheat flour is a bit heavier I added a whole cup of pb. I will defintely be making these again very soon.

These cookies turned out great. I had to use half butter instead since I only had 1 stick of margarine, but other than that I followed the recipe. I had to cook cookies 8 minutes instead of the time listed because my oven is old and it likes to burn things.

This is a great recipe for peanut butter cookies.  The only thing I did differently was baking it for 11 minutes and using parchment paper on the baking sheets.

These are sooooo good. Easy to make. They came out perfect. Good flavor. I stuck the bowl of dough in the freezer for 15 or 20 min. just to make sure it was stiff enough to work with and the dough rolled perfect. I will definately be making these again and again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Really good! Very moist, soft, and a lightly crisp edge.  Next time I make these, I'm going to add some chocolate chips to one batch and chopped peanuts to another.

I live outside of the US and at work we had a potluck lunch at which everyone had to bring a dish they grew up with. This peanut butter cookie recipe looked the most authentic so I made it. I was very pleased with the results. As the other reviewers said, I shortened the cooking time to 10 minutes. They were perfect.

It's pretty hard to mess up a peanut butter cookie, or so I thought.  I followed the recipe to the t & for some reason they really turned out bland, perhaps because I used generic rather than name brand peanut butter.  Next time I will try a name brand of peanut butter.

Great recipe!  I added about 1/2 cup extra peanut butter, 2 tsp extra vanilla, and some cinnamon.  Also reduced temperature to 350.  These went over very well.  They ended up with a light, crispy, crumbly texture in the end.  Will make again around Christmastime, guaranteed!

A good cookie, crisp on the edges and chewy and tender in the middle. My husband thought they should be a little sweeter, I thought they were okay as is.

Not bad...maybe add a little pinch of salt or cinnamon for more flavour.  12 minutes is a good time to cook it at 350.  Texture is almost muffin-like - not the typical PB cookie you expect.  Don't think I'd make it again. :(

These are great!  I read over almost all the reviews attached to this recipe and I don't know what they are talking about.  I competed the recipe as follows and only modifed 1 item which was the brown sugar, which I did not have enought of by adding the difference in white sugar and 1 tbsp molasses.  I did bake them only at 350 for 10 mins, because I know my oven works best at that temp for cookies.  They came out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Perfect!!!

I thought this recipe was great.  Used butter instead of margarine......they weren't as sweet as some other recipes I've used in the past but I wouldn't hesitate to make them again.  I may add an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter next time for more peanut taste.

Simple and delicious!  I've made this using Splenda sugar and brown sugar, too, and they were still very good, although drier and more crumbly.  They are also great with chocolate chips in them, or a chocolate Kiss planted in the middle.

I guess when it comes to peanut butter, I'm a real nut...  This just wasn't my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe.  It bakes up very light and crumbly, and doesn't have a strong peanut butter taste at all.  I prefer a more dense moist cookie, and would imagine you could substitute some of the margarine (I used butter) for peanut butter - maybe 2 cups pb 1/4 cup butter.  I just don't know for sure, but I didn't care for this recipe.  Not that it's a bad recipe, just not what I was looking for.

these definitly had a good taste to them, one of the better peanut butter cookie recipes that i've tried on here.
i used unsalted butter instead of margarine as well, not sure why you would use margarine.

This recipe creates a good hearty peanut butter cookie. I increased the brown sugar to 1 cup and used butter instead of margarine. I rolled the cookie balls in sugar before pressing on cookie sheet. As a variation, I worked in morsels(chocolate and peanut butter) when forming the balls. When pressing with a fork, these cookies may crack a little and are bumpy but get crusty tips once baked. YUMMY!!  I baked in a 350 degree oven for 11 minutes. They were chewey/crunchy and just the right thickness.

I chose to halve this recipe.  Was about a 1/4 cup short on butter so I replaced it with extra peanut butter.  Used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy.  These are the best tasting peanut butter cookies that I have ever had!  They are nice and chewy but some fell apart on me.  That might really bother some people, but I'm perfectly content eating these with a spoon.  Husband really liked them as well.

Definitely a 5 star cookie!  This is such a simple recipe but so Yummy.  I did add peanut butter chips to half of the batch, those seemed to be a favorite.  I also reduced the cooking time to 10 min and they were soft & chewy.  These are a keeper.  Thanks Anita!

Excellent recipe. Cookies came out rich and had a sandy texture. I would reduce the baking time from 12 minutes to about 10 minutes. I would DEFINITELY make these again!

Very, very good - but be sure not to bake on the lower racks. They burn easily on the bottom.

I normally make the 3 ingredient PB cookies but I don't think I will make.them ever again. This recipe was so good and easy to make. I used crunchy peanut butter because I didn't have enough smooth. Also I can't believe how many cookies this recipe makes. Definitely a keeper!

These were perfect classic peanut butter cookies with excellent peanut butter flavor.  I did double the recipe and used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter.  I also added some vanilla and used 1 tsp kosher salt.  But basically, it was the same recipe.  I like a crisp peanut butter cookie so I let mine bake for 10 minutes, they were just barely chewy in the center but crisped up during cooling.  I will continue to use this excellent recipe!  Thanks, Anita!

Depending on your oven bake only about 10 to 12, I did 14 the first batch and they were a little overdone, not burnt. Otherwise very delicious cookies!

I added an additional 1/4c peanut butter. Once I formed the balls I rolled them in turbinato sugar then marked with a fork. I refrigerated each baking sheet of cookies for 5-10 mins prior to baking. DELICIOUS.

It was a very easy recipe but I was hoping for a more chewy cookie. My husband loved them but I thought they were just a little dry.

I added an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter and it still tasted like it needed more.  other than that they were pretty good.  they held their shape well and didn't go flat. yay

Very good. It made a LOT of cookies. I used butter instead of margarine and criss crossed with salt instead to add the salty factor with the sweet.

They turned out good.  I made them small so I had to watch that didn't burn.   I also did a batch with splenda instead of white sugar for the diabetic in family.   They turned out great!

I used butter instead of margarine. Used warm peanut butter that I had just made in my vitamix. Turned out perfect. Did not spread much.  Delicious.

Super good cookies. First time making peanut butter cookies. Peanut butter was not overpowering which I was expecting from other peanut butter cookies I’ve had in the past. My mother who is not a fan of peanut butter liked the cookies.

I just made these cookies.  They are wonderful.  We love them. On some of the cookies, I placed a Hershey Kiss in the center right after pulling them out of the oven.  My kids said they tasted like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!  I do agree that if you want a chewy cookie, only bake them for 10 minutes.  Will be saving .. Thank you!

These are great cookies!! I haven't made peanut butter cookies in years, so I was looking for an easy recipe, when I came across this one. I followed it exactly and they came out perfectly. I couldn't quit eating them! Perhaps I'd better wait a while to make them again :-). Thanks for the great recipe!

It works just as well if you use melted butter instead and instead of putting it at 375 put it at 350 in for 13 mins for perfection

If you love the taste of peanut butter, this is the cookie for you. My cookies came out peanut buttery and crisp. Great taste. Only changes I made was lowering the amount of sugar slightly and using 3/4 cup creamy and  3/4 cup chunky  peanut butter. This recipe yielded 40 medium and large cookies.  Very flavorful. I cooked them for the full 15 minutes because we like our cookies crispy.

Made a batch of these to add to my Christmas cookie platters.  They are perfect!  I rolled them in granulated sugar before baking and pressed a Hershey's kiss on top after baking.   I also subbed honey roasted crunchy peanut butter because it was what I had on hand.  I will make this again soon and maybe add some chopped honey roasted peanuts instead of the kisses on top.

These cookies were very easy to make.  They are however, a bit bland.  The texture is good. Not to crunchy  and not to chewy.  I think they made need a little more peanut butter flavor and perhaps some salt.

Delicious! I baked half exactly as the recipe stated and the other half with peanut butter chips and only for 10 minutes. This is the same recipe I remember my mom making when I was a kid and I'm so glad I found it! (Yep, I even broke my no margarine rule to make these throwbacks). Thanks for sharing!

I love that these do not have to be chilled before you bake them. They are simple and delicious! I used 1 cup of salted butter instead of margarine, and I always add more vanilla to anything I make...I probably tripled the vanilla. My husband cannot keep his hands off these cookies! I do agree with other reviews to be careful on the cook time. 15 minutes is WAY too long. 10-12 minutes is just right depending on how you like your cookies.

I am used to peanut butter cookies made with oil. These are wonderful. The butter makes them much less greasy. Made the recipe exactly as written. Baked exactly 13 minutes at 375.  Excellent. I wil be making these again!

I just made these cookies and they are really good!  I omitted the vanilla because I didn't have any.  Also, used vegetable oil spread in place of margarine and baked @375 for 10 minutes.  Did grease the cookie sheet as well.  Not a strong peanut butter flavor but still good.  Rolled the cookies into walnut sized balls as instructed and placed two inches apart on a round baking sheet.  To flatten I dipped my fork in a cup of water then sprinkled sugar over both sides of the fork to press down the cookie balls and make a crisscrossing pattern... If you find the cookie is sticking to the fork possibly you need to dip back in water and recoat the sugar.  In between batches I placed the dough in the fridge even though it's only for a few minutes as you prepare the cookies for the oven it helps with the fork sticking to the cookie when flattening.

I added a bit more pb and 1/4 c. Less of each sugar. In addition, I added 1cup each of choc chips, walnuts,and shredded coconut. Super good!

I was excited to try this recipe because it's rated so highly and it didn't require refrigerating the dough.  I'd like to say upfront that I followed this recipe and measurements exactly EXCEPT for one thing: I used butter instead of the margarine it called for. I highly doubt that change was the cause of the crumbly, dry texture. It almost seems like there's just too much flour in it. As I was measuring out the flour I thought to myself, "I bet I can get away with just a couple of cups...." But I followed the recipe. I usually like to go ahead and follow a new recipe the first time I make something just to get a feel for it then go back and tweak it to fit my expectations. All in all, these cookies  weren't BAD ... but they weren't the best cookies I've ever made, either. I think next time I'd lower the amount of flour to 1 3/4 or 2 C and maybe add a little bit of salt to balance the sweet.

first I will say that the hubby and I do not bake often. flavor was good but the texture was a little too crumbly and dry for our liking. we baked for 10 min as many reviews suggested. instead of margarine we used unsalted butter. we followed the recipe on everything else. would prefer a more chewy and moist cookie.

This is the only recipe I make now. My entire family loves these cookies. Instead of using creamy PB I used the chunky and I also chilled the dough for 1 hour before baking.  Best PB cookies ever!

These were ok, made as directed except I used butter instead of margarine and I added chocolate chips.  The taste is good, but the were sort of dry and crumby.  I think they will be a good dunking cookie. I just prefer a moister, softer cookie.

They turned out pretty good. It seemed like it just needed just a little more peanut butter. I spread some peanut butter on top of them and they were great. Got my peanut butter fix. Thanks!

These cookies came out pretty good but I feel they could have had a fourth of a cup more peanut butter. Not peanut buttery enough for me. Also the ingredients call for vanilla extract but it's not in the directions.

Absolutely a life saver!  I work the overnight shift at an Assisted Living community, and part of our job is to bake cookies every night for our tenants.  All from scratch - All the time.  There are many many PB recipies out there...but this one - bless your heart - won over all the other night shift workers' recipies - hands down (and that came straight from our elderly residents, who, I might add, can be VERY unforgiving if we mess up their baked treats :)  I doubled the recipe - came out PERFECT.  Many many thanks!

Best peanut butter cookie recipe EVER! I have been baking for 40 plus years. If you want a peanut butter cookie that actually tastes like peanut butter, then this is it. So simple to make. I didn't tweak it at all. My 5 Grandkids couldn't keep their fingers out of the dough. I try to make a double batch because these wont last long in a cookie jar.

I made these cookies and they didn't turn out, so i cut the butter in half and added more peanut butter and they turned out great. This recipe calls for to little peanut butter and to much butter. After doctoring them they was great.

Pretty good.  Could have used some more peanut butter.  I substituted coconut oil for the margarine.  It gave it more flavor and the peanut butter with coconut tasted good.  I didn't criss cross the cookies, instead I made them mini and put a single chocolate chip on top.  I just didn't like the taste very much.  I might try a different recipe next time. :(

Excellent recipe! I used butter instead of margarine and added just a bit of extra flour (less than 1/4 c) to prevent them from becoming greasy.

This recipe was fantastic!  The only change that I made was I used butter flavored crisco instead of margarine. They are so delicious. I also didn't make them that small. I made them about the size of the big cookies by nestle and pillsbury and I still had 36 cookies total! My husband and mom love peanut butter cookies and they as well as myself are very pleased!

I use this recipe for all of my peanut butter cookie needs, whether it be peanut butter cup cookies, white chocolate chunk, or just plain old peanut butter cookies, they are amazing! I even used the dough  inside chocolate and topped with peanut butter frosting and a piece of a Reece's peanut butter cup on top!

My family agrees that this is one of the best  PB cookie recipes I have ever used. Sometimes I add chocolate chips or PB chips or chopped peanuts. Plain still seems to be everyones fav, however.

Excellent recipe :) If you have an extra sweet tooth like I do, you may find that they could use a little powdered sugar sprinkled on top. My family loved them. I found that cooking them for 13 min at 375 degrees made the cookies achieve a perfect crunchy/soft balance. Thanks a lot for the recipe, Anita!

Not bad. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with 58 cookies. After the first batch, which was quite dark on the bottom, I realized that 1. I needed to raise my baking rack up and reduce the cooking time, and 2. There was not enough sugar. I rolled the rest of the cookies in granulated sugar and baked them for 10 minutes at one notch above centre, removing them from the pan as soon as they came out of the oven. They came out fine then. In the future, I might add an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla, a bit more sugar, and I would probably add some chocolate drizzle or chips, just for personal preference. Still a nice easy recipe that I will keep in my book.

I was really pleased with this recipe. It makes a nice, moist, slightly chewy peanut-butter cookie with good flavor. We stuck chocolate Kisses on the top of each one right when they came out of the oven!

This was GREAT!!! I made a few changes..instead of margarine (because I had none) I used oil and then I added about 2 tblspoons of Maple Syrup. Also substituted creamy PB for Crunchy!! It was tastey!!

Followed recipe exactly as described. In my opinion, I did not care for the texture.  Dough was too sticky and after baked they came out too fluffy....I believe this to be because of the 2 eggs...other pb cookie recipes I have tried call for only 1 egg, and shortening should be used instead of margarine.  They definately did not take 12-15 minutes...more like 7 or 8 mins. on 375F.  Gave it a 2 because the flavor was "okay" it was still peanut buttery, but not great. Most likely will not make again!

These cookies are about a 7 on the peanut buttery flavor scale.  Very soft (I cooked them for 10 minutes) and light tasting.  The boyfriend loved them, the kids were kind of on the fence.

This is a great recipe. I love peanut butter cookies but my family could take them or leave them. These were gone in 1 day! I added chocolate chips because thats the best way to eat them! The cookies weren't chewy when they cooled but it didn't matter.

Theses are definately the best pb cookies I have found.  They are absolutely perfect with a slightly crunchy outside and soft, chewy centre.  I doubled the recipe and didn't make any substitutions but will try chocolate chips next time.  I did use extra-creamy pb (Kraft brand) as I find different brands can make the product slightly different.

The best peanut butter cookies that I have ever tasted! I didn't have smooth peanut butter and used crunchy instead, and I followed the advice of others and baked them for 10 minutes. Delish!

Yummy! They were made perfectly following the directions given :)  Once I made 3 dozen of just peanut butter cookies, I decided to place a chocolate kiss in the middle of the rest ~ What a FABULOUS combo!! (Oh, if you do add a Hershey's Kiss to the cookie, please make sure you put them in the freezer right away so the chocolate hardens again since the heat of the cookie melts the chocolate.)

This is a great basic peanut butter cookie recipe!  My only change was that I am a huge fan of vanilla, and I added 2 teaspoons.  I also agree with the 10 minutes of baking time.  Chewy, soft cookies!!  YUM!

The cookies turned out dry even with a way shorter cooking time. They didn't have that creamy rich peanut butter taste that I was looking for. I will keep looking for a better recipe.

Mmmm! Really good.  I substituted sunflower butter for the peanut butter due to allergies in my family.
Watch the temp/cooking time (maybe reduce a bit so they don't burn).

These really are our favorite peanut butter cookies! I make my cookies larger, so my cooking times vary, but they are always the perfect texture and absolutely delicious. HINT: Don't taste the dough, or the baked cookies won't taste as sweet to you. I also use Skippy Natural Creamy peanut butter.

These Cookies cooked up very well for me. I took the Advice of the other reviews to cook them for only ten minutes at 375, and they turned out to be chewy, melt in your mouth, peanut butter cookies. Great Recipe!

I tripled this recipe. Rolled them into balls and put them in the frig. They were used by the pre-kindergarten class at church to make for mission work. They just popped a hershey's kiss in the middle of each one and we baked them up.
We gave them to the police dept. and fire dept. as well as bagged some up for homeless lunches. 
Of course the children had to sample them too. yummy! 
Thanks!

I am a beginner baker and these were great for me- the dough was easy to work with and not too greasy.   As suggested I cut the baking time down to 10 minutes.   They turned out great... and were even better the next day.  My boyfriend was happy that they were fluffier than other peanut butter cookies I have tried recently and says if I add peanuts next time they will be a 5.

I am certainly not what you'd call a baker... and despite that - these are terrific!  I used butter and a higher ratio of brown to white sugar as some reviewers suggested.   Thanks so mush for sharing this - it's a keeper!!!

Very easy cookie to put together. The taste and texture were terrific. There are quite a few PB cookie recipes on the sight so i will have to try a few more to give it a really true rating, but we did enjoy these.

We LOVED these cookies!  I made a batch for my dad who loves peanut butter cookies and couldn't stop eating them myself!  My dad loved them too.  The only changes I made were to follow the 10 minute suggestion of the other reviews (they came out perfect) and to add peanut butter/chocolate swirl chips but they would be perfect without them as well.

these cookies were just ehh.  like others, i found them to be too dry and crumbly and way to flour-tasting.  i increased the pb and used butter instead of marg. like others suggested, however i still wasn't impressed at all.

I was looking for a chewy cookie. These are a little too "cakey" for my taste. The peanut butter didn't come through so well either. A good cookie, but not exactly the classic peanut butter cookie.

I didn't care much for these... they were really dry and crumbly. I tried adding more peanut butter and vanilla but that didn't seem to help. I can't figure out what I did wrong since everyone else seems to be giving this GREAT reviews!

WAY WAY WAY too greasy feeling. I feel like I wasted my time and ingredients on this one for sure. I don't have much time to bake cookies always but love to send them with hubby to work and I hate that I wasted my time. The batter feels greasy when you roll the balls and the cookie leaves grease all over your hands. I don't care for it, and I even went over everything 3 times to make sure it just wasn't a mistake on my end. I would definately decrease the marg/butter and actually just do another cookie. Sorry for the one star but I don't even feel like it should get that.

Excellent basic peanut butter cookies. I added a dab of grape jelly/rasberry preserves 1/2 way thru cooking. I just indented the cookie in the middle with a spoon. Yum!!

I Found The Cookies A Bit Crumbly And More Cake-Like; Not Much Like A Cookie. Also, They Did Not Have Much Flavor; I Would Suggest Adding More Peanut Butter, Flavoring, And Sugar.

This was a pretty good recipe although it was a little dry for my taste.  I suggest using chunky peanut butter and maybe real butter instead of margarine.  Also I used sugar to flatten the cookies instead of flour, the flour just made the cookies taste drier.

My husband is a lover of peanut butter cookies, and we both loved them.
i like how they were crispy on the ends and moist in the center, the flavor was perfect balance. they were also very simple to make.
My only complaint is they were a little bit crumbly, but im sure a little extra peanut butter would help.

Very good once you turn down the oven heat to 350 degrees and bake for 8-10 minutes rather than 12-15 minutes. I got some really poor results at first -- the cookies overcooked even they were in the oven for only 8 minutes. They were super crumbly and unappetizing. Turning down the oven heat made a HUGE difference. (I live at sea level.)

I substituted butter for the margarine since I don't like hydrogenated oils, and these cookies were melt in your mouth good.  I baked half plain, half with chocolate chips added and everyone in the family was happy!  I also used all natural peanut butter and added an extra 1/4 cup for the peanut taste. . .
Very very good!

Great cookies, but I gotta say, there is NO WAY this recipe will make 4 1/2 dozen! *LoL* I got 32 very tiny cookies. Usually in our house we like big cookies, but I made these tiny to make the quantity stretch. Other then that, they are FABULOUS though. Melt in your mouth yummy. I sprinkled them with a little white sugar before baking. Make sure not to over cook, as these are delish just barly done. Mmmmmm! :)

I was not very pleased with this cookie. It did not have a very peanut buttery taste and the texture was more consistant with a shortbread cookie. Not what I was hoping for...

I'm a novice Baker who enjoys making deserts and breads. The thing I noticed was they had a good texture, and maintained it even when slightly over-cooked. For a festive flavor try adding some cinnamon.

Made these for a christmas gift for my brother - with the help of my 5 year old.  Very easy, wonderful tasting according to my husband - used half creamy and half crunchy - also used half margarine and half butter. Wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks a bunch!

Decent cookie, but too dry and crumbly to pair well with a hershey kiss on top.  Although, in all fairness, I did use butter instead of margerine, rolled the ball in corse raw sugar, and cooked it for 1 minute less.

These were fantastic.  I added a Hershey's Kiss to the center of each cookie.  They didn't last long!

these were good, but would benefit from more texture. Chunky peanut butter would be good.

These are not very sweet.  I also wish that I had used butter instead of margarine, but I was out of butter which is why I picked this recipe.  Not very flavorful.  Not a bad cookie, they are edible, but I will be looking for another recipe.

These cookies are really good. They are soft and chewy and not too sweet. However, I'm sure this is the recipe on the back of my Kraft Peanut Butter!

The cookies were great.  I cooked them for 10 minutes only and they are perfect.  I split the dough and put chocolate chips in half very yummy either way.  Will do over and over again.

This is an easy cookie recipe that is sure to please! I made a batch on a whim one night and brought the rest into my co-workers, seemed like a hit! I would definatley make this recipe again.  I did bake less than the 12 minutes suggested (about 10-11) for a slightly softer cookie. Turned out well!

12 mins burnt the cookies,9 mins was perfect...still a bit to crumbly for me. Not to sweet but did seem like it was lacking something...Soft and chewy, yes...my search will go on. FYI if you press cookies down they will be more likly to burn and will be flat.

This is a great tasting cookie.  My husband loves it. We like a softer cookie so baked it for only 10 minutes and it was perfect...golden but not hard!

Fabulous Recipe!  I used Butter instead of margarine, and cooked them an additional minute for a crispy cookie.  I also dipped the balls in sugar before crossing with a fork.  Hubby took some to work and everyone loved them!

Maybe it's a matter of preferring crunchy or chewy peanut butter cookies. The dough was too soft to work and I had to put it in the freezer. When it rose, the cross hatch design totally disappeared. It's not a very presentable cookie. And was it chewy. Chewy in a hard way. The flavor was good but given enough peanut butter, any recipe will taste good. I will try other recipes.
