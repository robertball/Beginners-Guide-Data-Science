This was great, only I used fresh cactus as I don't like the canned ones.

I found this recipe quite simple to make yet very tasting. Though to add a bit of spice, I added a habanero pepper as well.

Great recipe!  I used fresh nopalitos and prepared them by boiling in water for 5-6 minutes, draining them, and boiling again for 5-6 minutes.

I had half a 30-ounce jar of nopalitos leftover from pollo con nopales (a friend's recipe), so I decided to give this a try.  It's excellent!  I was worried it would be a bit bland, but with the optional jalapeno and salt to taste, it's perfect.  The flavor of the potatoes meshes well with the nopalitos and tomato.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We love Mexican food and this is a fabulous recipe. 
Very easy to make. I didn't have fresh tomatoes but used canned diced tomatoes which worked just fine.
Thanks!

Excellent flavor, easy prep. Only question: is the Nopales supposed to get a bit gooey? I love it even still.

We loved it! I added 1 lb. extra lean ground beef and it was yummy. 
The beef actually made the nopalitos not gooey. It was delicious!

The ratio of potatoes to everything else is too high. Use fewer potatoes, more of everything else. Don't let your husband go crazy with dried jalapeño flakes.

If you like that okra with tomato mixture, you will enjoy this because it has the same flavor, just not as wet. If you don't like that, I'd recommend you find a different way to cook your nopales.

Made this today and was pleasantly surprised! My mother has never had nopales before, so I had her try it before telling her what it is. She absolutely loved it! I was initially worried that there would be far too much of the potatoes, but it turned out great. It also did not turn out gooey for me. The only thing I would probably change is the amount of peppers (personal preference...it just wasn't spicy enough for me). Will probably add poblano peppers next time, and as another reviewer suggested, some ground turkey. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Delicioso! I added tajín and minced garlic for added flavor...For the last 10 min of cooking I added a few tablespoons of sherry cooking wine -  fantastic. 

The recipe calls for russett but I used red potatoes and they were on point! Great recipe.
