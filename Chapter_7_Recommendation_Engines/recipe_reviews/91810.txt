Love this recipe, but after making it several times now I've found that you only need 1 tbs of vinegar and 1 tbs of olive oil (or none at all).  The vinegar can be overpowering if you use the full amount called for, especially when doubling the recipe.  2/3c uncooked couscous will feed 6-8 as a side.  Again, the recipe is delicious.  Thanks!

Superb! Instead of grape tomatoes, I added peeled, seeded and chopped Roma tomatoes. I used nice, fat asparagus spears, peeled and cooked only until al dente. Also added fresh mushrooms which had been sauteed with minced shallots, then reduced with dark rum. Used chicken stock to make the couscous instead of water, which added a lot of flavor. Added a handful of chopped, fresh basil leaves and a sprinkle of Asiago along with the feta. Brought it to a potluck at my quilting bee today and it drew raves. Many stuffed pita bread with it and appreciated that it was a filling, yet healthy sandwich. The recipe is a good starting point for a few tweaks that make this over-the-moon delicious. Even though I made quite a few additions, A+ for a versatile, out-of-the-ordinary recipe that can be altered easily to suit your taste.

This was very yummy-we used trader joes multigrain couscous (instead of regular).  It has a combination of mini chickpeas, quinoa, large israeli couscous and orzo.  The nutty flavors of the blend along with the cheese and asparagus worked very well with the sweet balsamic vinegar.  We will certainly make this again.

This is a great side dish- and easy too!  Here is what I did to make it really tasty....cook the couscous in chicken broth.  Then I roasted both the asparagus and the cherry tomatoes (cut in half) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous shake of salt and pepper.  I also added some sliced green onion.  Mixed the oil and vinegar in a small bowl, then dressed the couscous and vegetables with it.  I then tossed it with some really good quality goat feta, although only 4 oz.  We enjoyed this side with some grilled salmon!  YUM!

this is a great recipe. I did make several changes though. I made the couscous and let it sit out to cool to room temp.. I blanched my asparagus and immediately plunged it in ice water. I cut up two stalk celery with leaves. i made carrot slivers with my potato peeler. i opened a can of whole tomatoes, put the juice in a ziploc in the freezer for another time and sliced up the tomatoes into cubes. I also cubed a whole cucumber. When the couscous was room temp, I cut the asparagus into small pieces and added it and all the other vegies, 1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, 1 T mayo, 2 t. italian dressing, 3 sprigs fresh thyme, and about 1/4 cup cucumber dill dip (sour cream based, made for chips and vegies)mixed it all together and everyone in this household RAVED about it! even the asparagus haters ate it all. Thank you for the base recipe for me to create from! linda

This is really good.  I had to modify it a little because of what I had on hand, but I'm certain it would have been just as good either way.  I substituted artichoke hearts for the asparagus because I didn't have any on hand and then I used flavored feta for the cheese.  I might next time use white balsamic vinegar just to keep the natural color of couscous.  Great recipe.

I used some roasted asparagus I had left over and it really made this recipe.  Try with grilled or roasted asparagus for a fabulous variation.

Only change I made was to scale it down slightly (a half cup of couscous is plenty for two as a side size portion) Great side dish! Thanks!

My compliments to the chef!!!  This is definitely going to be a great addition to our backyard BBQ's!  I added chopped, fresh basil - and will probably add more next time.  The next go 'round I will add more tomatoes and feta than called for.

What a delicious recipe!  We'll be having this often.  I did make a few changes.  I used Israeli couscous (bigger than couscous).  I browned it in a skillet with a little olive oil and a couple cloves of garlic and pepper then added equal parts water( 2 C Israeli couscous, 2 C water), brought it to a boil, then reduced to med. low and simmered covered for 10 minutes.  I grilled the asparagus and also a couple green onions.  I didn't have enough feta on hand so I used what I had and added a little parmesan to compensate.  I'm thankful because any more feta would have over-powered the salad.  Finally, I had basil in the fridge so I cut up a few leaves and added that.  It was a great addition but the salad was absolutely good enough on it's own.

Didn't have cherry tomatoes, so I used steamed diced carrots to get the coloring in the dish. I like how the dressing doesn't overpower the nuttiness of the couscous. I did add about 1/4 tsp. lemon juice to the dressing, to tie in with  the Grilled Lemon Herb Pork Chops I served with it, also on this site.

This dish only took 20 minutes to put together.  I didn't hae couscous, so I used acini de peppe pasta.  It was wonderful - the recipe makes a lot!  This recipe is a keeper.

Yum!!! I used brown rice (cooked in chicken broth), left out the  tomatoes (I just don't like them), used 3 Tbs light balsamic dressing, added enough feta to taste, and the kicker, added dried cranberries and sliced roasted almonds.  Holy cow--yum!!!

Not sure how to rate this as I changed some major things.  But it turned out amazing!  I used artichoke hearts instead of asparagus and Quinoa instead of Couscous.  This was a truly great dish that I made with the Mediterranean chicken dish from this site.

This was a tasty salad.  I read the reviews and used just 2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and 2 tbsp of olive oil.  That seemed like the right balance because the vinegar flavor was a back note instead of the main flavor. I boiled the asparagus for a few minutes until they were crisp-tender because that is how I prefer my asparagus.  The couscous that I had on hand was garlic-herb flavored so I think that probably helped flavorwise. Also, my feta cheese was garlic-herb flavored.

I used the roasted garlic flavored couscous and I cooked it in chicken broth.  I roasted the asparagus and tomatoes. I added chopped green onion and I did salt the veggies when I roasted them. ...and I added some salt after I mixed everything together.  Very good!!  I think the next time I will either add or serve with grilled or roasted shrimp.

Hubs is not terribly fond of couscous, so I made this recipe using orzo.  I had already cooked orzo in the freezer, which made this even easier.  I just eyeballed the salad ingredients – didn’t measure.  For the dressing, I used white balsamic vinegar and cut it to 2 T. and used lite olive oil.  The white balsamic ensured that my salad wouldn’t turn an ugly shade of brown.  I also went about this a little differently.  I tossed the orzo, asparagus and grape tomatoes separately in a little dressing and then layered each ingredient in that order on a serving dish.  Then topped the layers with the crumbled feta.  I think the salad is much prettier layered, instead of tossing everything together.  I didn’t think of this until it was too late, but some toasted pine nuts would have been an excellent addition.  Regardless there was not a bite leftover, which means we really enjoyed this and it will be made again!

I think I would add a little more balsamic vinegar and oil to this next time. It seemed a little dry, but other than that it was very good.

Great recipe-I used israeli couscous which is more pearl size.  I also added 1/4 cup of fresh diced italian parsley and used garlic/lemon flavored feta which I found at my local supermarket. I also served this salad chilled as a side with grilled fish and broiled mango slices. This salad was very filling but was a fresh take an the same old side salad!

Love this recipe! It's so easy and I just made it for a potluck that I need to go to in an hour!  I substitute goat for the feta cheese and it's fine.  I also use a mixture of gourmet tomatoes to add more color. I think this would be great on orzo, instead of couscous. To add more flavor, I used a boxed flavored couscous mixture (one that is flavored with olive oil and garlic).  I think it tastes better.  I will make this for lots of meals to come!

This was very good.  I did not have a problem with blandness because I used the flavored couscous packages--one was a pine nut and the other was roasted garlic, as I doubled the recipe.  I halved the amt of oil and vinegar as recommended by other cooks, but in the future, I'd think about eliminating the oil altogether.  Overall, a big hit.  Am now thinking about trying it with chick peas rather than couscous to make it a little more healthful, in which case I'd definitely use the oil, how much TBD.

fantastic recipe!  i did change it slightly based upon reviews plus took a shortcut and used canned asparagus, and a large vine-ripened tomato diced really small, halved the vinegar/oil, and used chicken broth and garlic to cook the couscous (used Israeli variety) and my kids and hubby all ate seconds and asked for it for lunch tomorrow - THANK YOU!!!  :)

Very easy and delicious. I only had a 4oz container of cheese instead of 6oz and it didn't seem to matter. I also lightened up a little on the vinegar and oil as others recommended. I would start with half the amount and add to suit your liking.

Very well-balanced. After reading other reviews of this recipe, I made a couple of modifications: easy on the feta, swapped white wine vinegar for balsamic and grapeseed oil in place of olive oil. Added finely chopped red onions, a bit of garlic and parsley. Took it to a dinner party and it was a smashing success. This will become a new regular in my repetoire!

I just made this and it is fabulous!  I made one-half the recipe using a tricolor couscous with vegetable stock.  As couscous can sometimes be a bit dry, I added a little extra stock then as the couscous was cooling I added sauteed onion (about 1/4 cup) and garlic (one large clove) and then stirred the feta cheese into the couscous/onion/garlic to incorporate the flavors. I used steamed asparagus and a medium chopped and seeded tomato. To finish the dish I drizzled the balsamic vinegar and olive oil evenly over the couscous and mixed it in. This made 4 generous servings!

I GRILLED THE ASPARAGUS AFTER BASTING THEM WITH OLIVE OIL, SALT AND PEPPER. i ALSO USED LESS CHEESE, ABOUT 1/2 CUP AS MY DAUGHTER IS NOT A BIG FAN OF FETA CHEESE. FOLLOWED EVERYTHING ELSE AS WRITTEN AND IT WAS DELICIOUS!

Great flavor, easy to make.  We dramatically cut back on both the olive oil and the basalmic vinegar (season to taste) and used fat-free crumbled feta cheese and found it tasted just as good.  Great served cold or hot. Large portions. Can substitute broccoli for asparagus depending on what's in season.

It's pretty bland as by the exact recipe. I reduced amount of vinegar and added parsley and toasted almonds. Also, a whole bunch of asparagus is way too much for just four servings of this salad. After those adjustments, the salad came out DELICIOUS!!!

I broke my own rule and modified this quite a bit to make it fit with our style of eating; really, all I did was cut the couscous to one cup (which makes it more of a vegetable dish than a starch dish), the olive oil to one tablespoon, the vinegar to two tablespoons, and the feta to four ounces. It was very good this way, but I imagine it's also very good as written - probably even better, because how can more cheese possibly be a bad thing? You just can't go wrong with these flavor combinations.

Lovely. I added kalamata olives and red peppers, and my couscous had already been cooked in chicken broth, so I went light on the dressing.

The only complaint I have is that the couscous absorbed too much of the balsamic flavor and the rest didn't.  If I were to make it again I would combine the couscous and the rest right before serving.

I did not care for this at all.  I was looking for something to have for lunches and this certainly is not it for me.  I did roast the asparagus as suggested by several and that was a great idea.  Other than that I made this exactly as written.  It was way too dry - ....sorry maybe it's just my taste but I'm being honest.  I picked at the veggies and will end up tossing this - breaks my heart to do that - I tried to send it home with my Dad but he wasn't having anything to do with that either.

Super yummy and simple if you know how to prepare couscous. I was trying to tie some flavors together with the rest of the meal so I added about a fourth cup of chopped cilantro and a few sliced leeks.

A good base for a recipe.  I had quite a few little tweaks and a person could have lots more, you just need to adjust to your tastes.  I roasted the asparagus instead of steaming.  I used parmesean/asiago instead of feta and I would have used a little less oil/vinegar in the end.    I wasn't sure how much couscous to use...2 cups dry or 2 cups cooked.  I went with the two cups cooked and this easily made four side servings, if not six.  But again it was a little too much oil/vinegar for the amount of couscous.  I like mine to be a little more dry.

This turned out really good, but I did a few things differently after reading other reviews.  I grilled the asparagus, which gave it a very nice flavor.  I added some sliced green onions.  I only used about 4 oz. of feta, which I'm glad I did because I think the full amount would be too much.  Also, instead of adding the vinegar and oil, I just drizzled on a little balsamic vinaigrette dressing instead.  This was a very yummy dish!  I'd definitely make this again and again.

Great summer main dish recipe - I added fresh herbs - oregano, parsley and basil, along with shredded carrots and cucumber.  Can feed 6 easily as a main dish.  I used 2 T balsamic vinegar and 3 T olive oil and mixed together then added to the couscous.  You could easily use red wine vinegar instead, but I like balsamic.  Highly recommended, easy recipe - definitely will be made again!

Great recipe!! I tweaked it a little bit when I made it.  I added celery, cucumber, and carrot to the tomato and aspragus.  I only used 1 T. balsamic vinegar, and added 3 T. of greek dressing.  I also served it cold, and everyone loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

A delicious couscous dish.  I cut the recipe in half and still had a ton of food.  I added extra feta, because I love it, and basil, oregano, and parsley as someone previously suggested.  I mixed up all the ingredients except for the couscous and asparagus and let it prep in the fridge until I was ready to cook.

A geat hot day salad recipe. The only change I made to the recipe was to cook the 2 cups of couscous in chicken broth which added great flavour. The recipe does make loads, and as others have said, is great the next day served cold (or even heated).

In general I find balsamic vinegars  and vinaigrettes too overpowering in a couscous salad. So after reading the other reviews I used 1/2 cup of a very nice Italian salad dressing instead. For us it was just right. Everything else was according to the recipe. A lovely salad!

I started packing this for my husband's lunches as a healthier alternative to what I normally pack and he can't stop raving about it. I did make several alterations, though:
1) Added chicken (seasoned)
2) Use light balsamic vinegarette dressing
3) Season the asparagus with garlic salt 
4) Cook the couscous in broth

I used whole wheat couscous which was delicious, but made way too much. I only used half of what I cooked in the salad.  I also added fresh chopped parsley and a handful of dried cranberries.  Yum!!!

This really is a tasty salad/main dish.  I used homemade vegetable stock - so if I make this again, it probably won't taste exactly the same. Anyway, I "fried"  up the couscous in a little olive oi. with some chopped shallots -- just think Rice-A-Roni - then added the boiling stock.  I let it cool.  The only thing I added to the couscous were some chopped scallions because I needed to use some extra.  I used the vinegar/oil ratio in the recipe, and it was delicious.  I refrigerated it for a few hours then served it cold/room temperature.  I would make this again.

It was easy and tasty dish however I did some modifications.  I first sautéed chopped  garlic in a pan with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter. When the garlic began to brown I added 2 cups of water. Then added a little adobo, black pepper, salt, one clove and savory spice to the water and let it boil for a few minutes. Next I mixed whole grain couscous to the water and took the pot off the fire. Once couscous absorbed the water I added remaining ingredients.  I used more than 3 table spoons of balsamic vinaigrette. But I only had a light vinaigrette on hand.  I think the vinaigrette is the key to the dish coming together.  I would definitely try this dish again.  Especially if I need to whip something up in a jiffy

I substituted Quinoa cooked in chicken broth for the Couscous, Oven roasted the asparagus for 10 minutes w/ EVOO, sea salt and pepper, and used seeded Roma Tomatoes, chopped.  I also cut the balsamic down to 2 Tablespoons which was adequate.  In addition to the Feta, I grated some Romano Peccorino cheese which I think enhanced the nuttiness of the Quinoa.  Healthy and good!

I really like this salad, and so does everyone else who's eaten it when I've brought it to work functions or parties. My only recommendations are to 1) use a flavored couscous, such as parmesan and garlic, and 2) salt liberally to bring the flavors of the individual ingredients together.

This was the perfect light summer side dish for grilled chicken. I added some pine nuts and a little lemon juice. Next time I will roast or grill the asparagus.

Simply amazing taste.  Instead of the feta cheese, I used a bag of Kraft Mediterranean Crumbles with provolone, feta & parmesan cheeses.  Then served with shredded cold smoked salmon over the top.  A complete meal. Tasted like a gourmet meal and it took about 20 minutes.

Delicious!  Used Trader Joe's Harvest Grains Blend and also added chopped kalamata olives.  Otherwise didn't change a thing! :)

The second day I added chopped sausage and a little yogart. It made a whole new meal. I loved it both ways.

This is a quick and easy dish, but after making it I found it was unedible. There was too much couscous and it made the whole dish taste bland. It is too bad because it looked really appetizing.

The list of ingredients was mouth watering but once I built this dish the flavor was just OK.  I think the balsamic vinegar had something to do with it.  I will play around with this one before I serve it to friends

This is so good!! From the little kids up through the adults, EVERYBODY had seconds!  The only changes I made were roasting the asparagus in olive oil, s&p, and adding lemon when it came out of the oven, and I added a can of garbanzo beans.  (I'm on a garbanzo bean kick!)
Would absolutely recommend this recipe as a light meal or a wonderful side to......well, anything!

Made this for a potluck BBQ.  It was a big hit with everyone.  Made it the day before and let it sit in the fridge and get happy.  Used the white balsamic as suggested so the colors stayed fresh looking.  Did not have enough feta on hand so also added blue cheese as well.  Next time will add basil and maybe some green onions.  Thanks for a great couscous recipe.

Tomatoes and asparagus were a great variation from my usual cold couscous! This was delicious.

This is a nice side dish that I would definitely serve to guests.  It only took a few minuets to prepare, and the flavors are  great! I did add a bit of chopped red onion and some dried basil, oregano, and parsley, and I cooked the couscous with chicken broth. I actually liked it better the next day, so I will prepare it in advance next time!  Great recipe!
