This was surpisingly good! I was a little leery about "alfredo" made from Cream of Mushroom but it was good and relatively healthy if using fat free soup and wheat pasta!

This was AMAZING!! I love anything with sauteed mushrooms and I was worried about what the broccoli would do to the taste, but it was superb. I used less mushrooms than it called for and also less broccoli, which worked out because I think if I would've used the full amount, the sauce would've been mostly broccoli and mushroom coated in alfredo instead of alfredo with broccoli and mushroom!

This recipe was okay... It tastes more like a stroganoff than an Alfredo, so if your heart is set on an Alfredo, look elsewhere...

I was looking for an easy alfredo sauce and this fit the bill as I had all of the necessary ingredients on-hand.  I dressed it up a little by adding cream cheese.  Since I'm a vegetarian and had a little of carrot and red pepper available, I added them to the vegetable saute.  I poured this sauce over mushroom ravioli (instead of fettuccine).  For my carnivore hubby, I placed sauted shrimp on his plated portion.  We loved it! I attempted to submit without a rating since I changed the recipe.  As that's not an option, I'm giving this recipe five stars.

Too dry and bland, even after a double batch of soup and doubling the parm. I think there can never be enough broccoli either, so I added ~3 more cups of broccoli 2 days later.
