I adjusted this to our liking,but,it was so good,we may make it two weeks in a row! While the pasta was cooking (I used Rotini)in a fry pan I heated 2 1/2 cloves minced garlic (& I added a bit of chopped garlic for fun) and about 1/2 cup chopped red onion in a little olive oil. I added sugar snap pea pods and sun dried tomatoes. I grilled the asparagus on our Hamilton Beach griller for a few minutes (after mixing with a little olive oil and lemon juice). Then I added to fry pan for a few minutes. I then added all ingredients together in a large bowl and tossed with fresh grated parm chz (a drizzle more oil) and a little salt & pepper.  Awesome!

I liked the idea of this recipe, but made some changes to suit my tastes. I prefer my veggies stir-fried instead of boiled, so I cooked them in olive oil in a pan along with some chicken and some Mrs Dash. I also used whole wheat rotini instead of penne. All around a very healthy dish.

I just made this for dinner and it was fantastic!  I sauteed a small onion, sliced with the asparagus in a large saute pan.  Then added a clove of minced garlic and a pinch of red pepper and salt.  Then I added the snap peas and let it all cook for about 15-20 minutes.  Served over the cooked penne drizzled with a bit of olive oil.

We loved this recipe!  My husband SAYS he doesn't like asparagus - but guess what?  He loved this asparagus dish.  My only difficulty was that the snow peas I got were still out of season and got a little bitter.  But you could substitute frozen peas instead if that was the case.  I would stick with only fresh asparagus though.

This is very good.  Maybe a little bland as is, but a great start.  Adding a little bacon makes this AWESOME.

Delicious! I used frozen peas and fresh asparagus and stirfried them with some garlic season-all, pepper and salt. I also threw in some red onion as well. Served it hot over al dente penne with grated Parmesan cheese. I really enjoyed it, while my husband only gave it a pass, and my toddler just picked out the peas. I don't care what they think, I'm making this again!

5 stars for easy preparation and the healthy ingredients (esp. when made with whole grain penne pasta.  minus 1 star b/c it was a bit bland for me.  A sprinkle of italian seasonings promptly fixed that, and I ended up having a lovely lunch.  Thanks for sharing!

Very easy, light and quite good.  Will definitely be making again as I'm trying to make more meatless dishes and increase our vegetable intake.

After tasting this receipe as written, I'd give this recipe 4 stars, because it was a bit on the bland side.  With a little tweaking such as adding a little Balsamic Vinegar and minced garlic to the pasta mixture - I'd rate it a definate 5 star recipe.  The second time I made it, at the last minute I realized that I didn't have snow peas so I threw in halved grape tomatoes and I really liked that combination as well.  Definately a great base recipe as it and easily adaptable to your liking

I made this recipe the other night and found it very good.  I added peas instead of snow pea pods.  I also added chicken with a little bit of hot pepper flakes.  You can add or do just about anything to this recipe to make your own and be very tasty.  A very good basic recipe.

So delicious. I made this with whole wheat pasta and all I had on hand was Mozzerella cheese. We loved it. I'm sure it will be even better  with  Parmesan. My newly diabetic daughter thanks you for sharing and so do I!

Very good for a light vegetarian spring dish.  My picky husband even liked it.  It could probably use a little extra "kick" for flavor.

So light and great! When it was done I threw in some grape tomatos, used homemade italian dressing instead of plain olive oil and covered it for just a couple minutes to warm up the tomatos.

Very good, easy pasta recipe.  With so few ingredients and few steps I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but was quite impressed.  My 4 yr old daughter loves it which is a bonus when they'll eat something with vegetables.

We really enjoyed this as a side dish.. more flavour than expected. We did add sliced sundried tomatoes with a bit of oil and it added flavour. Overall, the presentation and taste was very good.

After coming home from vacation to 20 pounds of sweet peas to be blanched and frozen and having an event to bring a dish to this recipe saved the day! I did modify it a bit and it was a big hit!  Also had asparagus to be dealt with so I blanched those and the peas (2 min each) then into ice water to cool and drained.  We had been given a stick of delicious salami from an employee who works at a local factory and I thought that looked like it would be good in this.  My husband thought that vinegar would give it that italian pasta saladness, though that is not what I was shooting for, I added 1 tb of apple cidar vinegar.  I love cheese but I would cut down a little on the parm next time.  I think the recipe meant for it to be served warm but I served it cold, therefore it did need more oil eventually.  IT WAS AWESOME!

Very plain tasting pasta.  I'd thought it needed a white sauce or maybe some pesto to jazz up the flavor.

I used this as the base for the Johnsonville 6 Ingredient challenge.  I added a large clove of garlic, minced and 1/2 pound Johnsonville Mild Fresh ground sausage.  Rather than boil the vegetables, I blanched the peas then transferred them and the asparagus to the pan with the cooked sausage and stir fried it all.  We thoroughly enjoyed it. Jessica, thanks for a great inspiration.

I added the balsamic vinegar and minced garlic as suggested but still found the dish quite bland. Next time I will add bacon and sauteed garlic and onions.

This recipe was pretty delicious! And it allows for flexibility which means using up veggies you need to get rid of! I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic and 1 cup of sliced red onions in olive oil. I then added mushrooms, asparagus, and broccoli and sauteed. I added some lemon pepper  & crushed red peppers to the vegetables. After adding the penne, I added some more olive oil (as the recipe said) and grated parmesan cheese( not fresh) and served. It was great!

I love how simple and healthy this recipe was! I will definitely make it again. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was it was bland. I'll either cook the veggies with some garlic or add in some italian spices. But it's a great base recipe that you can alter to your taste. 

Thanks so much for the great recipe idea!

It was just ok. It smelled so good cooking, but it wasn't as flavorful as it smelled.

Quick and Fabulous Meal! I replaced the snap peas with broccoli and steamed the vegetables rather than boiling them. In the meantime I cooked the pasta (whole wheat rigatoni). My boyfriend and I both loved it. It was a healthy meal too...and a great way to get your veggies :)

This is excellent, quick, and easy.  I even substituted broccoli in place of the snap peas the third time and it still was great. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  We added 15 large cooked shrimp to the recipe.  You might want to use cooked scallops. Easy to prepare.

I added in a tomato that had been seeded and diced....it just needed more flavor to me. Added a lot of salt and pepper. Maybe I should have added more salt to the veggie and pasta water?

I liked the basis for this recipe but I changed it a little bit. 1/2 pound penne 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 pound thick asparagus, cut into 1-inch lengths 2 cups chicken stock 2 cups (10 ounces) shelled English peas or frozen baby peas, thawed 1/4 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano- 6 oz prosciutto, cut into 1/2" pieces Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving Salt and freshly ground pepper It came out WONDERFUL!!! Add as much cheese as you need for flavor but the prosciutto added all I needed!

Freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a good quality E.V.O.O. make this a delicious pasta dish! This one has been added to my rotation of regular recipes ... even the kids loved it.

I was looking for something quick and easy  to make with produce I bought at our local farmers' market.  It turned out perfect and  was a hit. It is a tasty lower sodium dish if you forget the salt.  The Parmesan cheese adds just the right amount of flavor.  It is also makes for a quick meatless meal.  I will be making this dish again and again.

This turned out very well.  The only change I made was added only 2 tablespoons of olive oil and I added some sun dried tomatoes.  My husband liked it as well.

Made this for lunch today and it was so tasty and quick.  Sautèed frozen peas, asparagus and a little minced garlic for 2 to 3 minutes in olive oil. Added veggies to freshly cooked farfelle pasta with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and of Italian seasoning. Added Parmesan cheese ( eyeballed it) and another tablespoon or so of olive oil. Mixed well. I can see this often in the future. So good!

Simple, delicious, and refreshing! I could see the merits of adding other things to this recipe, like garlic or other vegetables, but on the other hand I really like the flavor of it just as it is. It's also very hearty and cost-effective, which is good if you're on a budget but still want to eat really good food you'll enjoy. Already a favorite!

Okay, so I admit I haven't made this yet, but I think it will be very good.  I'm adding the review to suggest to readers, if they want a full meal, to add some cooked chicken to this at the end, allow the chicken to heat and voila  - a ready meal.  You might need to adjust the oil, cheese and seasonings a bit.

This was delicious, but I made some tweaks to it.  I felt it would be a little too bland with just the oil and parm cheese.  I used cauliflower instead of snap peas ( I didn't have any on hand) and added shredded carrots, fresh chopped parsley and chopped scallions.  My husband liked it and it's a keeper in our house.

Very good.  My kids and husband were not a big fans, but they don't like vegetables like me.  This was great.  I recommend using less olive oil than recipe calls for.
