These are absolutely delicious bars! The amount of pecans is perfect, the filling was just slightly gooey, and the shortbread base is so buttery and delicious. The only thing wrong with these is that the maple flavor isn't all that present...you can taste a delightful hint of it in the bars, but they aren't extremely maple-y. I may decide to add some maple flavoring to the next batch I make, because adding more syrup would mess too much with the texture of the filling. I lined my baking pan with Reynold's release foil so that I could just take the whole section of cooled bars right out of the pan for ease of cutting. I did cut them into triangles instead of one inch squares...I thought they looked prettier that way. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...it's a winner!

Excellent! Here are my additions: 1). doubled batch; 2). used 1/3 brown and 1/3 white sugar in the dough; 3). added 1/3 c. shredded coconut and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the topping; 4). lined the pan with foil and lightly coated with Wilson's Cake Release; 5). Immediately after removing from oven I sprinked lightly and evenly with miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips (don't spread when they melt - just let them 'dot' the cookies with little bursts of chocolate).

After cooling almost completely; the bars cut beautifully!

For first time shortbread makers - let the butter come to room temperature naturally - don't try to microwave it. Then cut the sticks into little cubes, and sprinkle the cubes into the flour/sugar mixture as you're mixing it. Mix on low to medium speed and don't overmix. Taking this extra care with the butter and using a standing mixer will make a beautiful dough that is evenly incorporated, allowing you to just lift the dough out and press right into the pan.

Made this exactly as written, except for the addition of 1/2 tsp maple extract to give it a more distinctive flavor.  My husband loved these.  Tastes a lot like pecan pie tarts.  Next time I'm planning on substituting some white sugar because it was a little too caramel tasting for my liking.  I also lined my pan with foil so i could lift out, to make the cutting into bars easier.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan, and substituted an extra tablespoon of maple syrup for 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar.  SO GOOD.

AMAZING!
I am going to make these again for sure!
The only thing i changed was the pan i used. I didnt have an 8x8 so i used my cupcake trays. this recipe makes 12 cupcakes size discs. they were a perfect 2 bites and best of all i used cupcake liners so i had no clean up. unwrap and serve they looked nice and neat. In future i will make 2 trays worth. If i do that i would double the shortbread crust and triple the filling. I found the crust was perfect for 12 cupcake size bites but i could have used a bit more filling. Seriously good. You have to try this easy and addicting treat!

Sooo tasty and seriously so simple it shouldn't be baking legal! I've made this both with pecans and walnuts and its equally as good to us. The only thing I really have to add is that I have started adding just a pinch of salt to the egg mixture and would like to reiterate what the other reviewers have said about the maple syrup...it must be good quality pure syrup or you might as well omit it because you won't prominently taste it. Thanks for this easy delicious recipe!

These are rediculously delicious! Made a double batch and gave half to my coworker for her birthday. Good maple syrup is key to this recipe for a strong maple flavor. Only thing I'd do differently next time is to line the pan with parchment paper. I thought a quick spritz of cooking spray would suffice...I was wrong. However, they still tasted fantastic in pieces!

These are little buttery bites of heaven!  I now print off copies of the recipe before taking the bars anywhere to save my 16 year old from having to write the recipe out in multiples.  I've made them twice now, the first time I followed the recipe to the T and the second time I added salt to the shortbread...a typical shortbread has salt in it and it did make a difference..but it was great both ways.

I can't even describe how delicious these are â€“ and they're very easy to make too. The only changes I made were to add another 1/2 cup of pecans and about 2 TBSP of extra maple syrup. As other reviewers have noted, NOTHING takes the place of real, pure maple syrup (especially an artificial extract!)... trust me, I'm Canadian. ;-) However, some people may not be aware that there are different grades of maple syrup -- light, medium, and dark. With 'dark' giving a much more intense maple flavour. It can be hard to find, but it's out there. 
These squares are truly awesome. I can't wait to try them with walnuts or almonds.

@larkspur, for the maple flavor you must use pure syrup, i find that store bought stuff isn't very good. Not sure what you used, but thanks for your compliment:) Glad you enjoyed them

I made these without nuts because of possible allergies. My co-workers loved these. the caramelized brown sugar and maple on top was amazing. And the bars were chewy, buttery, and sweet! I will be making this again!

Very tasty!!  I don't have any real maple syrup, but I really wanted to try it, so I substituted the maple syrup for light corn syrup and added 1 teaspoon of maple flavored extract.  I also threw in about 1/3 cup extra pecans.  It was rich and delicious.  I will be making these again soon!

Very good, but my only complaint was that the bottom crust got soggy after 24 hours or less.  I did add a bit of maple flavoring per other reviews.  These were very good.

Wow these were exceptionally good! Make them, you wont be disappointed! I actually made them twice in one week. Make sure to use PURE maple syrup just like the recipe states...outstanding! (I did add more pecans and also added 1/4 tsp Vanilla extract to the pecan layer...yum!)

Delicious!  Following suggestions from other reviewers, I doubled the recipe and added 1 tsp maple flavoring, an extra 1/3 cup of pecans, and a pinch of salt to the egg mixture.  Despite adding the maple flavoring, they still didn't taste particularly maple-y, maybe because I used dark brown sugar.  Next time I'll use either light brown sugar or white sugar instead.

very good recipe, my kids really appreciated it: and they can eat pecans, which are healthy! I doubled it, because I thought there was no point in baking such a small amount. The quantity is perfect for a 9x13 baking dish really. Definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe!  Whenever I take some to a potluck, my friends fight over it.  I've also tried it with about 1/4 cup of chopped crisp bacon in addition to the pecans.  YUM!

Such a great, easy recipe for someone who has never made crust before! I made this recipe using mini cupcake trays. If you are going to try it, I think it is best to spread the crust thinly because they puffed up and left almost no room for the topping. I would also make two batches of the topping because there wasn't enough to put in all 24 of them.

Followed recipe as writted. Delicious! Very similar to pecan pie bars, but the filling here is a bit thinner spread. Meaning there's less on top of the crust compared to pecan pie bars. Everyone loved them, thanks for sharing!

These are absolutely spectacular! I didn't imagine just how wonderful these would be! I also added 1/3 of Skor bits (the kind you get in the same place in the grocery store as chocolate chips) to the pecan mixture and they are to DIE for!!!!!

Great taste.  Super simple to make.  I added a pinch of salt to the dough and used pecan halves (though chopped pecans might have made it easier to cut).  I lined the pan with parchment paper to make them easy to remove.

The topping softened the shortbread too much and almost felt like it was uncooked.  It was good, but I wouldn't use this recipe again.  I would probably double the pecan.

I have made these many many times and they are great.I followed the recipe to a t. I have made these for my co -workers and everyone loved them i even had to give the recipe to a few people.I do suggest that you use good quality maple syrup when making these it does make a difference.

A very tasty cookie, and very easy to make.  I lined my pan with parchment paper for easy removal, and took another reviewer's suggestion and added a little maple flavoring.  I will definitely add this recipe to my holiday baking.

These were a big hit at work! The recipe turns out perfectly as written.(I did add a pinch of salt though.) They even came out of the glass baking dish quite easily. The 2nd time I made them I added a tablespoon of bourbon to the pecan & maple filling and toasted the pecans as I would with a pecan pie. It adds another depth of flavor that I really like.

Everyone who tried it said it was better than pecan pie!  Pure maple syrup is a must.  I greased the pan and they came out easily. I also doubled the pecans and it was the perfect amount. You're going to want to double the recipe, it's that good.  Thank you for the great recipe!

These are just perfect.  Easy and quick to make, with delicious, buttery, soft, gooey, brown sugary results.  The maple is subtle, and I was worried it would be overpowering.  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.  I might try increasing the filling next time to make the bars more substantial, but they really are dreamy the way they are.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these just as written except I double it and used a 9 x 13 metal pan lined with parchment paper.  Baked for 20 minutes as the recipe states.  Turned out perfect and delicious. Be sure to spread out the pecans so they evenly cover the shortbread. Cut them in even squares, then cut them in half diagonally for a decadent look.

easy to make and very tasty. It looks and taste like a store bought pecan bars. I had to increase pecan to almost 50% as it looked better that way when cooled but I followed other's recommendation to add salt. I'll definitely make it again when I crave pecans but not often since it uses quite a bit of butter... -_- With my oven, I baked shortbread section for 15minutes or so. Second baking took approx 12minutes. 
Overall, great recipe!

Oh my... These are some serious trouble! I made them for the Easter dinner at my boyfriend's parents place tomorrow, and I am seriously tempted to just say that they didn't come out good so I decided not to bring them. Lol. Seriously though, these bars are just pure delight. My only problem is that the crust fell apart in some places. It stuck to the wax paper that I put on the bottom of the baking dish. And I did want to add some salt to the crust, as other reviewers suggested but I completely forgot about it. Oh well. I have a feeling I will be making them again very soon... :)

Amazing bar! One of the best I have ever had! The pceans I used were very chopped up, but I don't think it made much of a difference. I used pure maple syrup and, due to the fact I didn't have a mixer, mixed the flour/sugar/butter by hand and with help of a wooden spoon. I also followed the advice of some others and added a bit of salt to the mixture. Delicious!!!

These are vey good; I don't find them to be too sweet at all. I made them yesterday with only one minor change.  I added an additional tablespoon of maple syrup.  I will probably double the recipe next time, as my husband has already eaten almost the entire pan! :)

I am not a pecan pie fan but assumed these are similar.  I tried making the recipe tonight and gave them 5 stars for the flavor and easy prep but I had some problems.  Tracy, I hope your or someone else can help me because the flavor was delicious and I'd like to make them often.  

I made them exactly according to the recipe except for using a whisk to mix them instead of a mixer.  I was unsure if the shortbread should go up the sides of the pan or just cover the bottom as I have never made shortbread before.

I baked them 17 minutes and they were done perfectly in the corners but not in the middle. I had no problem getting them out of the pan and I put nothing on or in it.  

I will try again and will add a touch of salt to the delicious shortbread as others suggested because I also thought it could use a touch.  Please help if someone out there can. I did use authentic dark maple syrup because that is all I will buy as it has the best flavor.  

Thanks,
Janis

Phenomenal! Made this exactly as written, using real maple syrup. Had to make 2 batches in one week because my husband and I ate the first batch and didn't have any to share for the holidays! I will need to be careful with this recipe because I could make it over and over and over...

These are amazing. I used real maple syrup and the maple flavor is perfect. I didn't wait for butter to soften completely. I chopped up mixed with pastry cutter. Pressed in pan and it was fine.

This is my first review and I have tried many fantastic recipes, but this one is definitely worth the time to write a review. I have made this several times and its simply amazing! I follow the recipe exactly but I found the bigger the chunks  for the pecans, the better it looks and tastes. Place a giant handful of pecans in a ziplock bag and hit it a couple times with a rolling pin ( double bag because the bag breaks) and its the perfect consistency. AMAZING. This is small batch. Its perfect to make a great desert without having too much of it around.

These were a nice lightly flavored butter cookie. Easy to make and yummy! I baked mine about 20 minutes and would recommend making them small so the middle part bakes all the way. I even left out the pecans because I wanted a simple, easy butter cookie. Thank you for sharing

To get a good maple flavour, i used a good maple syrup and substituted some of the brown sugar with maple sugar (can be purchased in some costco stores in Canada.

Super super simple to make these literally take no time or effort to make.... Instead of using a blender I just used a bowl and mixed with a fork and they turned out great.... Next time I might try adding more maple syrup in the topping and less brown sugar for a more maple flavor.... They reminded me of seven layer bars without the layers definitely a good base to make if you need something fast

SO GOOD! These were okay when pulled out of oven, but they were AWESOME the next day. The BEST! Flaky shortbread, crunchy pecan pie like topping. Did I mention SO GOOD? They didn't have a chance at my house. I will double next time!

It took me 3 tries to get this right. I was baking the shortbread in the wrong sized tin. Make sure to use an 8 inch square tin. Another easy recipe (when done right) although my trial runs did not go uneaten either!

I took them to a bake sale the day after I baked them - they definitely soften once they are cut and put in a cookie tin (they aren't firm like normal shortbread since they have the nut topping).  Keep that in mind - they need to be eaten fairly quickly, but are quite tasty.

These were so delicious! A very simple desert and loved the shortbread base! My husband requested these again after we had finished the pan. Thank you for the recipe!

I'm making these for the second time as the first batch turned out so wonderfully. This time I'm using Splenda brown sugar to cut the calories. Like others, I add 1/2 tsp maple extract for more flavor. This deserves 5 stars!

Excellent recipe.  I used the plain low fat maple syrup I had in my fridge and it turned out great.  I've made these twice in one week and everyone loves them.  Tastes like the best pecan pie you've ever had.  Will make these for Thanksgiving dinner instead of the pie!

Very easy to make and turned out great. Especially good for those that love pecan pie. The shortbread made a great crust and absorbed the sweetness from the maple/brown sugar/pecan topping. Mmmm

I also doubled this recipe & just used a 9 x 13 pan to bake it in.  I did cheat and used just regular lite butter flavored Aunt Jemima syrup, but it was REALLY good.  The added butter flavor with just a hint of maple made it tast sort of like a gooey, chewy, really tasty butter pecan deal.  They have been around for 3 days now & have just gotten softer & better tasting with age.  Very easy recipe & went over well at the wine tasting I took it to.  Thank you for sharing!  :)

I wanted to make these for Thanksgiving instead of pecan pie.  Everyone likes pecan pie but finds it so rich that they usually cannot finish a piece and then it goes to waste.  I made a trial run and found them to be easy and delicious.  For the reviewers that thought there was not enough maple flavor, I think, again that depends on how much you like maple.  I do not like a strong maple flavor so these were perfect for my taste.

This is a keeper! Iâ€™ve made it twice in a week, for different holiday potluck parties. 

The first time I followed the recipe. It was a bit sweeter than I prefer, but still excellent. The second time, for a double recipe, I cut the brown sugar in the topping by half, to 1/3c, and added 1/2c finely chopped fresh pineapple and 1/2 c chopped raisins. They were great. Will make again for sure.

I made a double batch of these cookies and put it in a 9 x 13" pan. I cut 60 cookies out of this. The topping didn't go all the way to the edge so the side pieces were larger.  The crust cooked 15 minutes to a golden color & the filling also cooked 15 minutes to firm up. These little gems were delish tasting like bites of pecan pie. I will be making these again.

Oh my goodness! These are SO GOOD! I followed the recipe closely (did not have real maple syrup; substituted with Log Cabin). Did everything else exactly.  So EASY to make.  Everyone in my family will get some of thÃ¨se in their "Christmas Cookie Box" this year.  I will be proud to serve thÃ¨se at my Christmas Party this year. I did not line my baking dish with parchment or anything.  I used  a metal baking pan that had a very smooth, almost shiny finish. Got them out of the pan easily.  So easy and so delicious!

First and foremost, thank you Tracy for putting this recipe into print and sharing with everyone.  I have been making this recipe for a very long time and get requests to make it all the time. I've been reading the reviews from other bakers and there are a few who just can't follow a recipe and so the end result is frustrating. For this recipe, I found using a glass baking dish, weather an 8x8 or a 9x13 and lightly sprayed with cooking spray, works phenomenal for not sticking.  If you don't have glass bakeware, then yes, aluminum foil lightly sprayed, works like a charm. The recipe is perfect as is. Why fix something that "ain't" broke??? To answer another reader's question --I press the shortbread up the sides of the dish to hold the topping a bit better. Second, as the recipe  instructs, the crust must be completely cool before pouring on the topping to bake. This prevents the base from getting soggy and sticking to the pan. Also, check the bars after 12 minutes or so to see that the edges are not too brown. The center will be a little soft and wobbly when done. Remove the pan from the oven at this point since as the bars are cooling, the heat from the pan will continue to bake the batter. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Oh good grief! Ridiculously good! I tried the cupcake version but they were a little big. I lined the pan with tinfoil for the the squares version which made clean up a breeze. Also tried adding coconut to the topping mix, still ridiculously good. I can't make this again for fear that I will eat them all...in one go...as they come out the oven!

Simple & yummy! I am really happy with how these turned out - they are definitely worth the minimal effort. Only change I made was using 1 C total chopped pecans and adding an additional 2 T maple syrup. I'm really glad I did - the amount was perfect. Used an 8 x 8 pan lined with parchment paper - they came out easily.

Great recipe! I did follow it to a T and it makes a great square, but what I prefer even more is adding maple extract, cinnamon and coconut to the topping, and using half white sugar /half brown in the shortbread. Everyone loves these! I gifted them to many people along with some other cookies.

My all time favorite recipe. I've made it dozens of times following the recipe to the tee and making numerous variations, either way, they always turn out great. My favorite thing to do is candy or make a praline out of the pecans before adding them, really takes the bars to another level.

These are good and easy to make.  I used real maple syrup and did taste the maple.  I prefer a little more pecan topping over the shortbread, so next time  I'll try to increase the syrup topping.

Epic disappointment. For so many raving reviews, I was optimistic. The crust process went well. After 20 mins, I added  the pecan topping and baked for 13 mins (recipe says 12-15).  The result looked NOTHING like @larkspur's picture shown for this recipe. When I scrolled through other bakers' photos, I saw similarities to my own results. I did not serve these. There is only so much value for a recipe's taste; for me, success also means a good presentation.

Very good, and mistake-proof!  I messed up the crust (melted the butter a bit too much!) and then baked it too long and it was still awesome.  I did use my cheap maple syrup that I had on hand, so you really couldn't taste it, but that was OK.  This is still delicious!

These are delicious. Very simple. I think they are better the longer you let them set up. The only thing I changed is using Aunt Jemima. Love pure syrup and I am sure the purity would be excellent flavor but all I have right now is Aunt Jemima. Ugh but don't want to waste it so I am using it. I did not add the maple extract maybe the fake syrup already has the additive? Making another 2 batches today!

Just made these and they are still a little warm but I cut them because I couldn't wait.. The smell was just heavenly as they baked!  I doubled the recipe, which I'm glad I did; I used a 13x9" pan and added 1/4 tsp. maple flavor along with using "real" maple syrup.  They are rich and delicious without being too sweet.  I wish I had a scoop of ice cream to put on top of them.  This will most likely be what I'm bringing for Thanksgiving.. :)

I made these today and agree that they are fabulous!  I used about double the amount of pecans, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The bars are buttery and not too sweet - my guy told me they were great, and ate five. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this a few days ago. I was so excited to make this from reading all the reviews. I was craving pecans and thought this recipe would be good. I did exactly as written but when it came to baking, it wasn't so great. I put the oven to 350 degrees. I think it cooked pretty fast and 20 minutes is too long. I think the oven should be set to 320 degrees. When I checked at 20 minutes the edges were burnt. I had to take it out quickly and I poured the egg batter and lowered the temperature. It was good when it was warm but once it was cold it became hard like a rock. I ate the top part and threw out the shortbread part. I do want to try it again, it can be chewy but the instructions are not right. And the maple flavor I didnt care much for. Maybe cinnamon flavor would be better or honey flavor. I will add honey instead of maple syrup and maybe a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

So my advice heat the oven at 320 degrees, Put it in the oven for 15 minutes then pour the egg batter and put back in oven for 5 minutes more. And cut it right after you take it out. I will try it again. Hopefully I should get it right this time.

These were a big hit at the office. I made the recipe as is with only slight adjustments. I added a pinch of sea salt to the pecan mixture and threw in a few more pecans. I forgot to prick the shortbread with a fork before cooking but they still turned out great. I will definitely make these again. It reminded me of pecan pie, only better. They weren't overly sweet which made them perfect.

Amazing, and so easy!  I used a butter maple pancake syrup and walnuts as that's what I had on hand, and added a pinch of kosher salt to the topping.  I found I liked them much better once they had cooled, these are so good!

These are fabulous!  I used Grade B maple syrup I purchased at a farmers' market in Middlebury, VT while visiting a friend.  It is by far the best maple syrup I've ever had - buttery, rich and smooth.  It gave a delicous and delicate maple flavor to these bars. Also, I didn't have any pecans on hand so I used walnuts and it was still excellent.  I can only image how phenomenal it would be with pecans. Thank you for sharing.  I will be making these often.

i followed the recipe exactly, except I added just a dash of maple extract, per ideas from other reviewers. Wonderful. I made only a single pan - now going to make more since it's almost Christmas and this stuff was wonderful. Thank you for the recipe.

Cookies are delicious!  Didnâ€™t make any changes to the recipe . My mistake :   I used a nut chopper that chopped the nuts too fine (small).  Next time I will rough chop the pecans for bigger pieces.  I will definitely make this again!

This is so quick and easy if you have everything handy. Real maple syrup works fine and an extra 1/2 tablespoon brings the maple flavor forward more if you want it stronger. I add a touch of extra brown sugar and some extra pecans to ensure that the texture isn't gooey when I do that.  There are so may variations I would love to try.  No white sugar here. My family loves the rich caramel flavor in the shortbread and topping.  My dad has a super sweet tooth and these actually satisfy him.

We love it,  is a good treat that you can cut really small and nibble on.  We love the buttery shortbread with the sweet maple and saltiness of the bacon and sea salt that I added to the topping.

Amazing!! Followed recipe exactly as written and would not recommend changing a thing, although  I did line the baking sheet with parchment which I think is a must as these are pretty sticky.  Used a pizza cutter to cut them into squares. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe, these bars will be a regular part of my dessert rotation:)!!

I'm addicted to these bars!! I've made it 3 times now and have adjusted the recipe a little. For the shortbread crust I added a couple of tablespoons of Maple sugar to give it a little more of a maple flavour and cooked the base for 3 minutes longer before adding the topping. I've used both pecans and walnuts, either is yummy, it just depends which nuts I have on hand. I also doubled the recipe each time and used a 9x13 glass pan. This is now a favorite in our house.

These are good and are easy to make.  I am also from Ontario Canada and pure maple syrup is always a must for any recipe.  I used walnuts instead of pecans.   I also lined the disk with parchment paper.  My family thought they weâ€™re good but they just arenâ€™t our favourite square.

Easy peasy and delicious too!  Only problem I had was with shortbread dough.   Mine was dry.  I just added a few drops of water at a time to make dough stick together.  I think it was the quality of butter that I used because  I had same problem with a different recipe.  I did take the advice of other reviews and lined the pan with foil.  Great tip!  Also, make sure you score the sides right out of pan.

Pretty good recipe...I was a bit  skeptical how it will turn out since there was no egg in the actual dough...which was quite dry even after a long mixing by the mixer. I also added shredded coconut as recommended by another reviewer...and broiled for a min or so to give a golden top-finish.

I added a 1/4 teaspoon of maple extract. Unbelievably delicious and so easy, I quadrupled the recipe.  I will be making these to add to my Christmas goodies I make to give away as gifts.

Prepared exactly as stated. The crust which I cooked for 20 minutes becomes over cooked when the topping is added and returned to the oven. I cooked the toppings g for 13 minutes and It did turn out just fine.

These are the best! I make them several times every fall. They are a big hit at work and with the family. I took someoneâ€™s suggestion and I add 1/2 teaspoon of maple extract.  I also bake it with the filling a few extra minutes. This is an awesome dessert even better than pecan pie. Thank you so much for sharing it!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great!  Was a huge hit at the office bake sale.  I followed the advice of a number of different commenters and added tin foil to line the pan, leaving the foil sticking out extra long past the sides to enable easy extraction once they cooled.  Brilliant!

Like Bonnie1244 I doubled the recipe. I put a little vanilla extract in the base though. With the top pecan portion I was worried it wouldnâ€™t be enough topping so I added an extra egg so 3 all together. Plus one teaspoon more of syrup. It was AMAZING!!! Drooling now just thinking about it.

This is one of the best things I have ever eaten.  If you like pecan pie, you have to try this!  I made it exactly as stated and wouldn't change a thing!  This is a new family favorite!

Giving this 5 stars because even the people who don't normally eat dessert enjoyed this.  Easier then pecan pie.  I used salted butter in the shortbread.  I toasted my pecans and used about a cup.  I added a quarter tsp of bourbon to the pecan mixture.  I take recipes as a starting point - oven temp and humidity have a definite impact.  I cooked my shortbread until it smelled done.  I also used an electric mixer on the egg/sugar/syrup combo and got it nice and thick and frothy.  If you don't beat it long enough you will end up with a runny result.  

I used buttered parchment paper on the bottom of the pan - didn't even trim it.  I did poke a generous amount of holes in the shortbread before baking - there might have been more holes  than dough.

My husband went back for 4ths.

Will definitely make again, especially since it can be eaten by hand, unlike a pie.

4 stars because I made two changes to the original recipe, I doubled the nuts and added a pinch of salt to the shortbread crust. With that alteration it was 5 stars! After the first bite, My pecan lover husband said it was the best dessert I've ever made him. And with every bite after he continues to go on and on. 2 notes. I don't taste maple. I used a high quality, pure maple syrup ...a bourbon barrel aged one. We can taste a little bourbon, but no maple. Which is fine! Delicious is delicious!!! Secondly, please note that brown sugar in the shortbread makes a much more caramely flavored cookie than white sugar. We will try it next time with white sugar to compare because we love the shortbread part of lemon bars. But for a pecan lover, this is an a amazing dessert!!!! I used a heart cookie cutter for Valentines Day and he loved it! **update, was asked to make again the very next day, exactly the same (brown sugar in crust) all of the boys in the house including teenagers, LOVE it! Baked shortbread for 25 min and used the wax paper as other reviewers suggest"

These are so great! I added the 1/2 tsp maple extract as another reviewer did to enhance the maple flavor. I'm sure they are delicious even without that. I used parchment paper to be able to lift it out of the pan and not worry about the edges sticking. Rave reviews from family! I would consider doubling the recipe and using an 8x13 pan.

These were very good.  I feel like there was a disproportionate amount of shortbread crust to topping.  But the flavors were excellent.  Will make again and just make more topping. I also used Reynolds Non Stick foil to line my pan, which made clean up super easy.

These are delicious! I made them with gluten free flour (Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1), added about 1/4 tsp of pure vanilla extract, and increased the amount of pecans to 3/4 cup. The time for the crust varies whether or not you use a glass or metal pan (cooks faster in metal-about 3 minutes less for golden brown). Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my husband who loves pecan pie to try before thanksgiving. We both agree it was as good as a pie, as satisfying and probably less calories than a pecan pie! I used dark maple syrup with a tablespoon of maple syrup sugar. The cookie was crunchy (added a dash of salt and apple pie spice)- the smells in the oven were yummy! I will be making this instead of pie for the holiday- thanks for a great recipe!

these bars are amazing! but there is something missing. i felt that the topping and pecan quantity were too little. i didnt have maple syrup so i used honey instead and a drop of vanilla extract. i think mybe next time i should just stick with maple syrup. i thought the bars will be goewy but it turned out biskit texture. its tasty anyways.

My daughter made them and brought them to me for Mother's day.  They were OUTSTANDING!  I plan on making them soon.  I love shortbread cookies so I may try increasing the crust amount when I make them.

Doubled the recipe and cooked in a 8x12" dish. Fabulous.
I cooked the crust a little longer than the suggested time and then cooked the filling for about 25 minutes. Rave reviews. Thanks!

These are really good! I saw a comment that the presentation wasn't the best. I do think they will be prettier if I place the pecans on top, rather than mixing them into the batter.

Easy quick recipe.  The first time I made it I didn't cook it long enough, and it was too soft to cut in squares.  8x8 is small, so it won't feed very many people.

my 10 yr daughter made, it's  that easy.  she didn't realize and used raw, brown sugar instead of brown sugar for the short bread; and it turned out even better! 
double the recipe (triple the nuts) and bake in "brownie" pan.

very good, rich squares.  Dont over cook, or bars will be too dry.

This is a very easy recipe that results in a very tasty bar cookie. I was surprised by the fact that the pecan pie layer at the top was very thin - not like the picture. Next time I think that I might double to topping portion.

Perfect just as it is written! I followed the directions exactly and took it to a party (brave, without testing!) and it was a hit! Not too sweet, they turned out great.  I have a convection oven so I cut the time by a few minutes each.  The flavor was perfect, just the right amount of shortbread and maple flavor.  Next time I might add a few more nuts, or maybe just chop them a little more. There will be a next time and soon!

These are pretty good. I'd make them again. I would have given them 5 stars but I wasn't that impressed with the shortbread part. I followed others advice, and added a little maple flavoring but I wouldn't do that again. I think it was a little much. I'd also try it with walnuts instead.

I made it exactly as written, with the one addition of adding salt to the shortbread. Delicious!  There are lots of great reviews and tips on here. I followed these tips, which were very helpful: (1) lined my pan with parchment, so they could be easily lifted and cut; (2) cut them into triangles, which were pretty!; and ,(3) made a double batch in a 9x13 pan when I needed a lot. I'm excited to pick up some good quality maple syrup to try that, but it was very good with publix maple syrup. It just wasn't very maple-y.

Taste is good. Directions state not to spray pan before putting shortbread into it and when I cut my bars they stuck to the bottom. The color of mine was also darker, but other than that the y were good.

This is a great recipe.  I just made it this morning; made 4 batches of it in fact; I tried a double batch, tasted it, it was a winner, so I  then doubled it again for a cookie exchange.  It was amazingly easy, fast, didn't use too many ingredients, and well, lets just say I kept cutting my squares smaller so I could keep nibbling.  I ended up cooking the double batches of shortbread (in a foil lined 9x13 pan) about 25-27 minutes.  The egg filling took about an extra 5 minutes too, just because of the bigger batch.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing and won't.  Thank you for a delicious recipe that I know my friends will be drooling over!

Wow, these are great!  I made as directed and lined the pan with parchment paper for easy clean up.  Tip: use the butter wrapper (greasy side down - add a little baking spray if needed) to help smooth the shortbread evenly without getting your fingers sticky.  The pecan/maple flavor was balanced well for me, but I will add a pinch of salt to the shortbread layer next time...which will be soon because this batch is going fast!

Really nice bars. Quite sweet but what would you expect? I may double the short crust, next tome. The textural differences are lovely.

I was craving pecan pie for dessert on Thanksgiving.  Made these bars instead in the evening after the turkey dinner...delicious!  My husband and I could've eaten the whole pan but stopped ourselves at half.  So good and quite easy to make!

Made exactly as directed. I'm happy to say I will not be making pecan pie (or those time-consuming little tartlets) ever again. This is equally delicious, just as portable as tarts, and can be whipped up with pantry staples in just a few minutes. Husband said it was 'heavenly.'

Oh my goodness,  so delicious!   please listen to the other reviews and line the pan with foil.  I would take a picture but it doesn't look too pretty since I had difficulty getting it out of the pan.

Sub maple sugar for brown sugar....then you will have all the maple flavor!!  You can make maple sugar easy enough.  1/4 cup and keep adding granulated sugar until it's the texture of brown sugar.  Store what you don't use...it's great in a cup of coffee.

Only addition I made was a 1/2 Tbsp of rum to the mixture.  Adds a lot of depth to the taste and cuts thru the sweetness a bit!

The shortbread is way too runny. You can't even prick it with a fork as the recipe indicates. After cooking it for 20 minutes, it was still way too soft.

Better texture and taste the next day. Not completely satisfied with the shortbread crust but 5-year old helper shoulders the blame for not pricking the crust so says his on-the-phone stupidvisor. The recipe is well worth trying again as the bars were yummy, just not pretty. Next time will use easy release foil which would make it easier to cut the gooey bars outside the pan. See â€˜View Notesâ€™.
