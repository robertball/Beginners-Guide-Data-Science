Incredible fries! Important -- bake at 400 degrees, for 40-45 minutes, and turn at least once during the baking. If you use the 450 degrees in the recipe, the fries will burn. I mixed everything in a gallon size ziploc bag. For the spices, I used freshly minced garlic (no onion powder), paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, and chili powder. I used 6 potatoes (4 russet, 2 sweet) and 1/3 cup oil. Delicious!!

Mmmmmmmmm!!!!!  These french fries were wooooonderful!!!!  I cut the potatoes into sticks like normal fries and then baked them for 15 minutes, turned them over, and baked for another 15 minutes (the whole time at 425 since they're thinner than wedges), and I must say these are the tastiest fries ever!  I also added salt and freshly ground pepper and garlic salt, and didn't measure it out- just kinda put on as much as looked good, and wow, were they tasty!  I think the chili powder was what really put them over the top, so don't be shy with it, and remember that seasonings seem to lose some of their flavors when baked (which means put on more than you usually would)!

This is a great recipe! The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it needs the tweaking that other posters mentioned: a little salt, lower temperature (400degrees), less cook time (30min), and they need to be turned 1/2way through. Thanks for posting this!

These were phenomenally good!  Quick and easy - and much tastier than the frozen variety.  

Cooking time and temperature will vary greatly on how thick you cut the wedges.  I followed the recommendations of others and reduced the cooking time and temp to 425°F.  However, after 30 min it was not ready.  I had to increase the temperature to 475°F in order to ensure they would be ready in time for dinner.  So, if you cut your wedges small and thin - you will need to cut the temp and cooking time.  But if you cut true (thick) wedges - follow the recipes directions (although I strongly encourage flipping the potatoes halfway through the process).  For a super easy cleanup - I poured the oil and spices into a gallon size Ziploc bag and mixed it all together until well blended - then I added the cut potatoes and kneaded and shook the bag until all the potatoes were well and evenly coated.  Then poured it into a 9x13 glass baking dish lined with foil.  

Minor adjustments:  I used paprika, garlic powder, salt, freshly ground black pepper, a pinch of chili powder - mine is exceptionally potent, and cumin)... The second time making this recipe I added fresh minced onion - and that was a very tasty addition too!

These were actually pretty good, but I only give this recipe 3 stars since the time & temp are way off!  Too hot & too long.  I had to play with it a lot to save them from burning.  Next time I will try them at 400 degrees for a half hour, and turn them halfway through.

I'm a college student, which means that I don't have a lot of supplies or ingredients on hand when my tummy starts a'rumbling.  But this recipe is really easy, and can be made even if you don't have all the ingredients.  What I did was cut up a bunch of potatoes into wedges, put them in a Rubbermaid box, poured a little olive oil over them, sprinkled them with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and red pepper then shut the box and shook vigorously.  When the wedges were evenly coated, I put them on a cookie sheet and stuck them in the oven.  Delicious!

FOR THOSE WHO THINK THIS RECIPE TOO BLAND:

Take one onion for every 3 potatoes. Cut it in half lengthwise and cut it into slivers.  Take all ingredients, including the onions, and put them in a zipper bag.  Knead and shake until ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Proceed with recipe directions. The onions add quite a bit of zing as well as nutrition!

Excellent, easy and less fat than deep fried! Use any seasonings that appeal to you. Done in about 30 minutes using  my convection oven. I turn the potatoes halfway through the cooking to get them more evenly brown. I am surprised by the number of people saying theirs came out burnt. My advice is, don't just close the oven door and forget it. Check on the progress every 5 minutes or so and take them out when they are brown and done.

My husband and I did not think these fries were that good.  For some reason none of the seasonings could be tasted.  I won't make these again.

These ROCK!!! I cut mine with a french fry cutter so they were smaller than wedges.  I took the advice of another reviewer and was generous with the seasonings (I used heaping rather than regular teaspoons).  I added the same amount of seasoning salt and a generous sprinkling of pepper.  The Ziploc bag trick worked like a charm.  I baked at 425 for 30 minutes (450 is too high - the olive oil will burn!)- turned at 15 minutes.  I put my fries on foil and they stuck a little, even with them being coated in olive oil.  Since the olive oil has a lower smoking point, the foil turned a little black at the end.  No problem with taste though - they were nice and crispy and spicy!  I am so happy I found this recipe - a great alternative to people trying to eat healthier.  Next time - I will use Release foil so they don't stick.  I would definitely say that if you like crispy fries - cut them smaller, don't do the wedges.  I had no problem with these being bland.  The chili powder MAKES this recipe for sure.  Don't be shy with the spices and you'll love this recipe.  Update:  for those of you who are saying this is bland, perhaps replace your chili powder with some fresh stuff...I noticed a huge difference when I replaced mine.

I have made this recipe for years. I have one suggestion: if you like your fries with a creamy center and crisp outside, microwave the potato for 4-5 min first, then slice and make the recipe. Adjust baking time accordingly. Delicious!

I've now made these twice and I absolutely love them!  They taste a lot like the seasoned frozen ones I used to buy all the time- only BETTER!  The seasonings are perfect and I didn't find the bake time too far off.  If you cut your potatoes into nice thick wedges the way I like to, they do take almost 45 minutes.  I shake the potatoes and seasonings in a plastic bag with the oil so it is all well coated, then pour out onto a baking sheet layered with parchment.  This makes the taters bake up great with NO sticking!  Great recipe!

As is, I'd give the recipe a 4.5 maybe? The flavors are awesome, but... I've made this about a dozen times now, and what I've changed, is that I put the oil ON the cookie sheet and just dip the potatoes in the spice mixture (I add a few spoons of flour to it as well) and it makes them bake up crispy and a lot like deli fries. This maybe is just our family's preference, but we love it.

These fries were very good and pretty quick to make. I tripled the recipe (big eater at my house)and cut the potatoes fairly thin. I did not have to cook for 45 minutes as the recipe listed but for 30 minutes. Also, a good way to coat the potatoes evenly is to throw them into a freezer bag, add oil and seasoning, and shake the bag.

I cut my potato 2 times lengthwise and each of the 3 sections 2 times lengthwise; this gives me   9 "steak size fries."  Most of te time, I use no spices at all: only olive oil.  I brush it on the potatoes.  The 450º works fine and I do flip them half-way through.  You can pretty much tell by sight (nicely browned) that they are done.  My husband loves them and that's good enough for me!  Thank you for sharing!

I thought these tasted great but only after I added more seasoning. I added some salt and garlic salt and they tasted great. I ran into the problem of them stickiing to the pan. I had to add a lot more oil to keep them from sticking. Othwerise pretty good recipe, will make again with changes.

I've been making these for several years. I never fry potatoes anymore. I've used countless different blends of seasonings and they always turn out great. My favorite is garlic powder and Season-All with a bit of red pepper. I use a gallon zip lock, slice my potatoes a bit thinner (french fry strips), dump the potatoes, sprinkle some olive oil on top, generously mix in various seasonings, zip it up and mix it up, then back for 12 min. per side at 400 degrees (but my oven cooks hot, so that's just right for my oven). I don't buy or cook potatoes often, but when I do - this is how I serve them. :)

This recipe is great!!  I tried adding a couple of tablespoons of each panko bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and man....they turned out sooooo....crispy.  You can hear the crunch every time you take a bite.

Very good fries. I have made these 3 times, the first 2 times I turned half way through and had a tough time getting them flipped without tearing them apart. The last time I didn't flip but turned on the broiler for the last 5 minutes, and they turned out great.

I think this recipe called for too much chili powder. It was very overpowering. I would recommend using less chili powder and more garlic powder.

Mmmm, these are good.  I'm with Sherryl, & added a tsp of salt to the seasonings.  I stirred them 1/2 way through.  We dipped them in Tostino's salsa con queso (a cheesy salsa dip).  Yum.  Thanks Ms. Ashlee!

Have made fries like this for years with various seasonings for those who said they need to be turned 1/2 way through, if you cut true wedges and place them skin side down on the foil, there is no need for turning. Both cut sides brown nicely.

Amazing fries.The whole family loved them. I followed others suggestions and only cooked for 30 minutes at 400. I also added a little extra olive oil to help in coating the fries. Will absolutely make again!

Cooking temp seems too high. I had to take my potatoes out before they burned at about 30 minutes. They were not crispy, just kind of chewy.  The seasonsings were not that special; salt and pepper and olive oil would have done just as well for our tastes.  Will not make again.

On the whole, the fries tasted great, nice and moist inside with a crunch outside. However, the next time I make this recipe I'm only going to coat the potatoes with oil and then season with spices afterwards. This gives the fries more flavour, which tends to disappear when you bake them in the oven "pre-spiced".

I made this recipe using 3 potatoes and doubled and tripled the spices as we like them.  I should have made more, as the five of us loved these fries.  They were easy to do, no peeling necessary, and if you bake these on greased foil, the clean-up is fast.

These were great and so easy to make.  I added a 1/8tsp.of cayenne pepper to mine and it gave it a little added zing. I also cut the cooking time,I cooked mine for about 25-30mins.  I will make them again and again. My family loved them.

Very good flavor.  I love that no ketchup or anything else is needed with these.  My whole family liked them but I must say I got much more raves with the parmesan seasoned ones.

Yum! Loved these. I added some sea salt before baking. I don't know if I would have liked them as well without a touch of salt. The bake time was right on, and it made enough seasoning for five medium potatos! Thanks. (Had these dipped in Ranch Dressing II from this site.)

these were good. I had about 6 med potatos so i tripled the amount of seasonings, and tossed the potatos with olive oil in a bowl just to coat them, laid them on a cookie sheet and sprinkled then seasoning on top, baked for half the time, turned them and sprinkled the rest of seasoning on top and finished baking.I will try them next time with more chili powder just to have them more zesty

I did as others suggested: I put the oil ON the cookie sheet and just dipped the potatoes in the spice mixture. I cooked half exactly as directed and the other half I added cumin. I thought the ones with cumin were slightly better. I also added salt.

My kids loved it, even with the chili powder and paprika.  I added 1 teasponn of kosher sea salt to the oil/spice mix and used about 8 small yellow potatoes.  It wasn't as crispy as the fried version, but it was still tasty.  400 degress for 40 minutes - 20 minutes each side, flipped with a spatula.  Probably could've used a spray of PAM or similar oil mist.

Great fries! The only thing i would mention is that they didn't look like the picture that is there for the moment. Used pilau masala, cinnamon, two garlic pieces (chopped finely), 1/4 onion (also chopped finely), and needed extra olive oil so that they wouldn't stick. Put too much chilli powder, so i'll remember to use very little next time. Thanks for a healthy recipe for fries!

These were just ok. I think I still prefer regular good old fashioned Mcanes fries. Although the chili powder is what really made these fries, so don't be shy with it. I was hesitant at first but it really brought out a good taste.

These turned out great.  Doubled the recipe, and followed the other reviews and lowered the cooking temperature and time.  I cooked them at 400 degrees F for about 35 minutes and they turned out fine.  Will make these anytime I need or want french fries!

Excellent way to eliminate added fat.  I mircowave the potato wedges before putting them into the oven, this saves extra time when in a hurry, and the potatoes always come out crispy.

I decided to go even healthier and use sweet potatoes. Instead of the suggested seasonings I used taco seasoning mix. Ashley doesn't particularly care for sweet potatoes, but both girls absolutely loved this! Thanks Ashlee!

These didn't move us.  There was too much seasoning that, rather than contributing a whole lot of flavor, only contributed an odd dark color.  Compound that with a too long cooking time (by roughly 15 minutes) and what you have is kind of mushy, dark, overcooked "fries."

Heat oven to 450' Line jelly roll pan w/ parchment paper. Put 1/2 t each paprika, garlic, chili, & onion powder seasoning together so you can shake it on or sprinkle with your fingers.  Slice large potato for french fries.  Place on parchment paper using 1 T olive oil in hands - toss the fries.  Then shake seasoning over all.  Added garlic powder, seasoning salt and black pepper at the end of baking.  Turn oven to 425' & flip over w/ spatula at 1/2 time.  Watch 15' before done and check every 5'

These had a nice flavor but they came out a bit soggy and part were burned from not turning. I might make these again but maybe use a different procedure to cook them in the oven.

This is your standard oven baked potatoes really. In addition to lowering the heat and turning halfway through I'd like to add that if you read the spices in seasoned salt, with the exception of the chili power it is the same ingredients. So instead of taking more time to find and measure out the spices than it does the cut the potato, dash as much seasoned salt as you want in there and they will be amazing. Also, the skins of golden potatoes cook a bit better than baking potatoes and the golden color makes the fries look more like deep fried fries minus half the fat.

I really don't understand the high ratings on these french fries. They were TERRIBLE! I followed the recipe to a T. They were SO incredibly bland so I added more seasoning and baked them a little longer, and that just made them powdery and STILL BLAND! My husband will eat pretty much anything, and we both had to douse them in ketchup just to make them edible, and even then we ended up throwing out more than half of them. Absolutely disgusting - will never make again.

Very good.  I cut the fries a bit thinner and cut the baking time.  I didn't have 45 minutes to get dinner ready.  My kids said they were the best fries ever.

I loved this recipe. may want to add a little more garlic salt and make temp 400 and line baking sheet w/foil. The ziplock bag is such a smart way to coat the potatos, its so obvious and I will probably always use this idea.

Yuumm--I used canola oil spray to  coat the fries instead of oil,and I think I ended up using way more spice than it called for. Incredible. Definitley better than the seasoned steak fries at the grocery store.

Loved these fries! I only used 1 tbsp oil for 3 potatoes but tripled the spices, so fries ended up being lower in fat and delicious. I do agree with other reviewers - 450 is too hot, baked at 400 for 30-35 mins. instead. The thinner you cut the fries the crunchier they turn out - yum!

I made the mistake of reading the reviews, and adjusting the temperature of the recipe. They got soft before the outside got crispy, and fell apart when I tried to turn them. When it became evident that the "fries" would be soft potato wedges, I finally topped the whole thing with cheddar cheese and bacon, and served it with ranch dressing. It was delicious but not what I had originally intended. Next time I'll try following the directions!

These are great fries and are baked instead of fried!  This is the 2nd time I've made them and we all love them! I just made a few adjustments both times.  I used the same seasonings that the recipe calls for and just added salt and a little pepper.  Cook them at 400 degrees and turn over half-way through. Enjoy! :)

The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 was because there were no instructions to spray your baking sheet. Common sense to some...I know but I was following the recipe directions fully. All of my fries stuck to the pan. Grrrrrr! They were still delicious though.

This was a great base recipe.  In addition to the mentioned seasonings, I added some seasoned salt and crushed rosemary to a zipper bag and shook everything together for a better mix.  Yum!

I was in a hurry, and making these as sides was a last minute decision. I took 3 large potatoes, and cut them into thin rounds. I soaked them in the oil mixture which contained barbeque paprika powder, mixture of fine dried herbs (tarragon, chives etc) and salt. Compeltely skipped the garlic and onion (coz I didn't have them on hand and had no time to go out and get these). I thought 230C was way to high to bake these so I baked these 2 175C for about 45 minutes (I forgot to flip them) and they were really yuummy. I'd love to next time sprinkle some cheese over these and ofcourse remember to flip these as well. =P Thanks Ashlee! :)

Delicious! Loved these. Cooked them for 30 minutes (flipping once) on regular bake, then 5 minutes on each side with convection bake. Spicy : )

While this was nothing special, it was good tasting and easy to make.  I cut the oil in half, added salt, and cooked the potato wedges for only 20 minutes.

There is no way you can bake these for 45 minutes. I followed the 45 at 450 and I came out with little hockey pucks. Make sure you lessen the time and flip them at least once. Not a good result. I couldn't even taste them to try them.

These fries were pretty good. I adjusted the baking time after reading some reviews saying that they were burning. I did 400 for 35 minutes and that worked out well. The seasoning was good, although next time I make these I think I will add a little salt to the potatoes to make the flavors more prominent. My son didn't care for them all that much, but he's not much of a potato eater so I won't count that into the rating. My husband and I liked them though so we will probably make them again. Thanks for the recipe, Ashlee!

Followed recipe (doubled for 2 large potatoes) and added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the mix a along with 1/2 teaspoon of pepper per potato.  Very easy to pour all ingredients in a ziploc and shake up.  Oiling up the foil on the baking pan is essential.  Taste was pretty good, but half of the batch of fries were dried out and some burned due to the high oven temperature suggested in the recipe.  45 minutes at 450 degrees is way too long and I chunkified my fries (though they were not technically wedges).  Next time I will try reducing the time to 30 mins. or lowering the degrees to 400 @ 45 and see how that works out.  At the very least, try checking your fries at the 30 minute mark if you go with the original recipe temp and time.

This is my go-to potato recipe for almost any dinner.  I usually make this with the spices as stated but always use fresh garlic. I also bake at 400 for 45 minutes turning after 20 or so. I also sprinkle kosher salt on after they're out of the oven.

I didn't use these measurements at all or the exact ingredients, but I built off of the recipe. I used red russet potatoes; cleaned and cut into wedges. In a bowl I mixed the potatoes with enough olive oil to evenly coat them, sprinkled them with garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika, and dried minced onion (because I didn't have onion powder). I put them on a baking sheet with the oven at 400 degrees for 23 minutes on one side and 22 minutes on the other, totaling 45 minutes. They came out perfect! I will definitely make this again.

The best part of this recipe was the spice mixture.  It will definitely be the spice mixture I use from now on.  I peeled the potatoes and then rinsed them in water-and patted dry before coating with the oil/spice mixture.  I got very crunchy fries.  It is very important to bake in a single layer so no steaming occurs while cooking, otherwise you will end up with soggy fries.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Didn't turn out so good.  They got too blackened, with all of those spices and kind of burnt with out a lot of flavor.  I guess a tip would be to cook for less time and to put more salt on it with less spices.

These were very good, but I made a few changes.  First, they need salt, I used season salt.  Second, 45 minutes is WAY too long.  I baked them for 20-25 minutes on one side and flipped them to crisp the other side.  About 10 min.  And I mixed the seasoning to taste.  A lot better than fast food fries!!!

Delicious!  These fries were loved by all five in my family.  I made them and we put them on our steak salad.  I will be making them again and again!!!  I chopped up lots of potatoes into shoestring size and threw them in a large ziplock bag with the seasonings which I doubled and after mixing them up I tossed in 1/3 cup olive oil and then spread them on a baking pan.  Actually you could cut down the oil to 1/4 cup.

Great Recipe! I used 6 small pot. and tripled the spices. I did't have onion powder, so I used 1/2 tsp. of onion salt and 1 tsp. of Lawry's seasoned salt. I also cut pot. thinner than wedges, used veg. oil instead of olive, because I was out. 45 minutes @ 450 was perfect. I didn't turn them and they were crispy! Thanks Ashlee!!!

This recipe has great potential.  I made it as is, with the exception of reducing my oven temperature as suggested by other readers.  I added salt after it was cooked to taste.  It was a good alternative to french fries.  Now when the kids ask for fries, this is what they'll be getting, in an attempt to improve upon the quality of food we are all eating.  I think next time I will spice them up a little, but am thankful for this basic recipe from which to work.  You can really tailor it to suit any type of main dish!  Thanks!................adding an edit now............

Okay so I couldn't resist.  I made them again for lunch, this time I cut 4 medium red potatoes (skin on) into fry shape (1/2 inch thick), 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil, 2 Tbsp homemade Emeril's Essence Cajun Seasoning, placed on parchment lined baking sheet for 40 minutes at 400 degrees, turned once halfway through, and delish!!

I have been making a variation of these fries for years... I coat a sheet of aluminum foil with olive oil, place the aluminum over a baking sheet, and place the sliced potatoes on the sheet (I dont make wedges, I make strips). I sprinkle the fries with Old Bay Seasoning (a Maryland crab seasoning, similar to Cajun seasoning, but not quite) and some salt, and let the strips bake for 10 minutes or so at 450. I then flip the fries, so that they will evenly brown, and cook another 10 minutes. (That is for all of you that said yours charred... c'mon now! Do you really thinnk that potato strips, or for that matter, wedges, wont be charred after not turning them for a half an hour? Let's think, here!) The end result is healthy and delicious! I always burn my fingers though. EVERY TIME! In fact, I have a nice tiny blister on my inner middle finger from the batch I just made! The strips DO stick to the foil, though. You just have to pry them a litte, they'll budge.

We use this recipe often. The seasonings are great but basic process is good if you just want to make plain french fries. As a simpler side we often use course ground salt and then bake them. We have used a relatively light weight cooking sheet but I suspect that a heavier cooking sheet or a stone would allow the bottoms to brown more.

Good by me.  Shook up the potato wedges in a plastic bag with oil & spices.  Then had to bake around 400 degrees.

I, too, changed the temp to 400 and reduced the time to 30 minutes. I cut my fries to between 1/8in and 1/4in and they were perfect!

Amazing! Turned out sooo good! This is my new french fry go-to recipe, for sure. The chili powder on them was the best part. The oven temp seemed a little high so I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked them at 400 deg for 40 mins, stirring once or twice and these turned out crispy and delicious.

Not too bad, not too good. I made some with just salt, pepper and olive oil, and it tasted SO much better. Definitely 15 minutes, turn over, 15 minutes at 400 degrees. Put lots of salt, or it will be bland.

I made this recipe, cutting my potato like fries rather than wedges.  I cut my fries and let them sit in cold water in the refrigerator until I was ready to bake them.  I dried them well with paper towels, tossed them with the oil and spices and baked them at 400 degrees in a cast iron skillet.  I turned them halfway through the cooking time.  These didn’t crisp up as much as I thought they would, so I’m wondering if letting them sit in the water for several hours may have been part of the problem.  In order to get them crisp, I baked them longer, which started to turn the chili powder dark – darker than I would have liked.  Next time I won’t cut my fries ahead of time and soak them, to see if that makes a difference.  Four stars due to too high an oven temp and the baking time is too long.

This kind of recipe inspires me. I'm a late bloomer when it comes to cooking but then this kind of recipe makes me feel like I've been cooking for so long. The taste of this is incredibly delicious!!!! My husband and kids love it so much that they just let me taste only a few. I followed the recipe to the dot, however, the only change I made was I added salt and pepper and baked it at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes turning once. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Ashlee =)

These were very easy and delicious. My husband, who detests potatoes, liked them and would eat them again. I did use 1/2 chipolte chili powder and 1/2 chili powder. This is a keeper.

I followed the recipe exact and the fries burned. Also, I wasn't big on the seasonings. A simple Creole seasoning would be very comparable but would give it a little kick.

This was both easy and excellent. I did cut the potatoes slightly smaller than large wedges and found the cooking time to be a bit long (mine burned), so I reduced time to 30 minutes. Also found them a bit greasy, so I cut down on the oil, but otherwise - it's a perfect recipe! (Other changes were that I didn't have garlic or onion powders, but used the rest of the ing's, and they were fine.) My 8yr-old daughter and I gobbled them up and made more! One big potato makes a LOT of fries for two people! Super dupe!

I just made these and they were delicious, hard to believe they were baked! I shook the potatoes in a bag with the oil and seasonings mentioned, and added salt and pepper. You can't add too much seasoning so go crazy if you wish. I am never gonna make homemade fries any other way again.

Delicious. I made them into ¼” sticks (like regular french fries) and therefore bumped the temp down to 425 and flipped after about 30 minutes. I also just used Lawry's seasoned salt instead of the other spices. They were crispy and so much better and healthier than anything you can get at a restaurant. I will make these many more times in the future

This recipe is amazingly tasty, and I only give four star because 450 is too hot so I had to do them at 400. I added Salish salt to the spices already listed and it was great.

Delicious...we found this recipe about a month ago and have made them a half a dozen times since.  Minor changes we made - we use cajun seasoning instead of paprika.  We also add a little hot sauce.  This gives it a bigger kick.

I baked at 400 instead of 450 for the 45mins and that was fine. I also used just a seasoned salt because, as someone else stated, the ingredients listed at those in the seasoned salt. These were just OK.

I don't understand all these glowing reviews.  First of all, why would you write the recipe for ONE potato?  How about at least four potatoes?  I had to guess on the spices because I didn't realize it was for one until I had already peeled and cut half a 10 lb bag.  I tried flipping them halfway through and they STUCK to the pan and FELL apart.  I didn't think I would have to spray the pan with the oil already on them, but I apparently there wasn't enough.  What a WASTE of time and potatoes!!

These were so simple and delicious! Next time I will up the seasonings a little so they are stronger. The only change I made was that I turned the temperature down to 350 after flipping them 20 minutes in. They turned out perfect though! Much tastier and healthier than the frozen ones. Thanks for sharing!

These were great! I didnt have onion or garlic powder so I finely diced a bit of onion and garlic and added it to the oil & spices in a large freezer bag then added the potato wedges and mixed. Cooked at 425 for 40 minutes (flipping 1/2 way through). Served with a store bought rotisserie chicken and frozen veggies. My 6 year old said it was better than Swiss Chalet and hubby had 2 large helpings of these fries. Definitely a keeper!

I've tried a bunch of "baked french fry" recipes from the site and I thought this was the best so far.The spice combo is really good and it's not too spicy for the kids.I quadrupalled the recipe for a family of 5.

Wonderful flavor! I used 4 medium-large white potatoes and doubled the oil and seasoning (just tossed it all in a baggie, smooshed it around, then poured out onto a foil-lined, Pam-sprayed jellyroll pan). I sliced my potatoes about the thickness of the fries shown in mominml's photo, and it took 25-30 mins at 450 for them to be perfectly done (nice and crispy!). Thanks for sharing the recipe! :)

This recipe is awesome.  I love french fries but thought I had to give them up due to healthier eating.  This recipe is ideal for me.  I get the best of both worlds.

These were really good.  I was looking for a recipe because my fiance is on a low salt diet.  However, these were a bit bland.  The next time I will probably sprinkle with a little seasoning salt just to give it some salt flavor.  Plus the cook setting was a bit high for my oven.  About halfway through, the fries were already "overly" browned.  The next time I try this recipe I will cover with foil for at least half of the cook time and reduce to maybe 350 or 400 and then uncover.

Works very well and is simple- hard to mess this one up.  Cooking time is dependent in part to the thickness you slice the potatoes to, so watch that last 10 minutes and take them out if they already look done.

These turned out excellent. I had to feed my teenage son and his friends on short notice and didn't have any frozen fries or chips to go with hamburgers. They gobbled these down and it filled them up. A rare thing for teenage boys!

Thanks Ashlee, so much easier than the fried potato's that are hubbies favorites.  He didn't even realize that I hadn't fried them.  I will be making these very often and won't tell him they aren't fried if you don't tell.  Thanks again.

Not to be redundant, but these were really good.  I made wedges, baked at 450, and mine were done in 25" (but I used a medium size potatoe). Just had for lunch with a lovely spring salad and ranch (my bad) dressing.  Very nice.  TY so much for recipe.

My entire family loved this recipe. I added some salt as well...and made sure to flip them pretty regularly. They wound up being in the oven for 45 minutes at 400°, but I think they could have stood to be in a little longer. Granted, I sliced them into wedges, so they're going to take longer than thinly sliced fries. :)

I have been searching for a homemade oven baked french fry recipe; this is VERY good!  After reading some of the other reviews, I went with a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes (flipping the fries at 15 minutes).  I also lined the sheet tray with foil; this seemed to give a hint of a crunch to the fries.  I cut the potatoes into sticks instead of wedges.  For personal tastes, I suggest adjusting/changing the seasonings to your liking; next time, I will probably cut back slightly on the chili powder.  Overall, a tasty recipe.

Really good!  I didn't have onion or garlic powder so I left them out and then sprinkled the works with salt to taste after they were cooked.  It turned out delicious and it was super easy too.

Yum.  Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, flipped and baked an additional 10 minutes.  The only change I made to the recipe was instead of onion powder I used onion salt as that was what was on hand.  I think next time I might add a speck of cayenne pepper.  Very good.

Yum!  These were delicious!  Super easy to make too-I should know, I've been trying to perfect my french fry recipe since hubby and I got married.  This is the winner!  I had to leave them in longer than suggested (we like them extra crispy) and the fries on the edges of the pan burned a little.  Still great!  I will definitely be making these again.  These were a great side for garlic burgers, but they were so tasty, I would make them to go with just about anything (or even on their own for a snack!).

I thought these fries would be really good, I followed the instructions exactly and what came out of the oven was a piled of burned, inedible pieces of charcoal.  I'm actually clearing the cache on my browser so that every remnant of this recipe is erased from my hard drive.

Great! Didn't change a thing and were quite tasty! I can't handle spicy food and the chili powder was not that much. I cooked them in ~30 mins for 3 potatoes in  a hurry.Microwaved sliced for ~15 minutes and baked for ~15. Soft in the inside and crisp on the outside.

I've made these several times and my WHOLE family loves them!!!! I honestly wonder why I even buy frozen french fries when I do buy them! If you want some good homemade french fries, then look no further, this is the recipe. I made this exactly how it says and they were wonderful. But it is such a simple recipe that you could add any other seasoning you want for sure! ENJOY!!!

I cooked them at 400 degrees as recommended and they came out perfect.  My daughter who doesn't eat home made fries normally even ate these.  I'll be using this as our regular fry recipe.

These were absolutely delicious!!  I was so excited to try these because they smelled so good while I was preparing them...and even better when they were baking.  YUMMY!!  I cut them into thin strips and baked them at 425 for about 50 minutes.  They were crispy and delicious.  The only change I made was adding red pepper (ground cayenne pepper) because I didn't have any chili powder.  It gave them a nice kick!  Will definitely be making these again!!

Added 9/2/10:  This also makes a fantastic marinade for chicken!!!  Instead of potatoes, add pieces of chicken (I used legs) and let marinate.  Spicy & delicious!

Very very good.  Only thing I changed was the time and temp.  I cooked these for 40 minutes @ 400 degrees.  Husband couldn't get enough of them and I had to slap his hand away just so I could get a few of them.  Will definately be making these again.  Probably weekly.

These fries are just about perfect. I think next time I might add just a little pinch of salt to help them crisp a bit more

i cut my potatoes using one of those handheld fry-cutter tools... i found 450degrees to be the perfect temperature! i improvised on the spices, but stuck to the time/temp guidelines in this recipe- best baked fries i've ever made (and trust me, i've tried numerous recipes!)

Terrific :) I put the fries in a large tupperware and mix them all up with the seasonings/oil, then place them on an aluminum foil-lined baking tray, bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes - flip them and then do another 15-20 mins. Thanks!!

I used 4 large potatoes & adjusted the seasonings accordingly.  Baked at 450 for 45 minutes and they were PERFECT!!  I didn't have any paprika but used all other spices listed & also added seasoned salt.  This was is a keeper!  So much flavor and so easy.

We loved these!  They are as close to the real thing as I've ever made without frying.  I lightly salted them when they came out of the oven.  Mine were done a little sooner than the recipe stated, so I think it is best to check them often.  I will make these again and again!

These were really good.  I doubled the seasoning.  I baked them at the specified time and temp and they came out nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I think some a either using medium sized potatoes and/or cutting the wedges too small - as I used large russet baking potatoes and cut them in large wedges and had no problems with the time it took them to bake nor the temp.  I also used canola oil, as that's all I had on hand.  Will make these again!

These fries were delicious and a great change from plain old fries!  
I find that everytime I try to bake fries the outside is done before the inside, so what I did what basically cut the fries and boiled them for like 8-10 minutes so they are almost cooked, then I mixed them and cooked them for like 15 min in the oven at 475.  They turned out perfect and so delicious!  You just have to keep an eye on them!

The baking time in this recipe is way off! I barley salvaged these when I checked them after 35 minutes of baking and they were black! The seasoning were burning. We were able to eat a few of them but most were thrown out. I have been using this web site for years and this is my first disapointment. I will try these again but will cut back on the heat a bit and the baking time.

Good recipe, spices can be changed easily to satisfy anybody.  I made the recipe as written and it was well received.  Tonight I plan to make again using only hickory smoke flavored salt... which think will be delicious.  The only negative thing is, they really don't hold up good to reheating, so eat up!

There were awesome, and oh so easy and quick. I substituted the onion powder for parm cheese (as per another slightly different baked french fry recipe on this site). The spices and the parm were perfect together, and the potatoes came out to a perfect consistency. An easy snack or side dish-five stars!

This is a yummy fry recipe! My hubby-to-be loves fries, but I hate him ordering them from fast food places or buying the frozen kind because of the pounds of chemicals and preservatives and trans fats those varieties are loaded with, so I gave these a try with dinner last night. They were very good! 

I didn't measure anything out since potato sizes are so variable anyway, but I added my oil and spice mixture to a zip-lock freezer bag and added the sliced potatoes, closed it, and shook them all up. I will say that turning them 1/2 through is probably needed for sure, though it can be a bit of a pain if you have your cookie sheet filled to the brim with thinly-sliced scalding hot fries. I'd definitely sprinkle salt on them when you take them out of the oven too.

Great recipe....will make again. Thanks!

These are truly the best french fries ever!  I always quadruple the recipe using 4 potatoes and four times the spices.  I do add almost a teaspoon of salt (when quadrupling the recipe) in with the oil & spices.  I also preheat the metal baking sheet in the oven so that it's piping hot once the potatoes are placed on it.  The french fries always are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  The spices give the fries a great kick and it is a favorite in our family.  I also make a simple dip using equal parts mayo and sour cream, and add garlic powder, onion powder, a dash of salt and cayenne.  It's great for dipping the fries.  Fantastic recipe!!

Really Yummy! I put them out with fried ones and my hubby picked these as best, who knew?  I used veggie oil instead of olive, that's what I had, and they were just great! I also used the ziploc bag method which seemed weird with the oil but worked really well. I think you should be able to alter the seasonings to taste and the possibilties are endless.  thanks for a great recipe!

These were very good!  We adjusted the oven temp to 425 and cooked them about 25 min., flipping the potatoes half way through.  When we flipped the we added a sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano which crisped up nicely adding a super flavor.  We are actually having them again tonight with burgers on the grill and we just had them 2 days ago.  The only other thing we did differently was to cut the potatoes into strips like regular fries instead of wedges.

Quick, easy and pretty healthy for French Fries.  Like others I cook at aroung 400 and keep checking them - they do not take 45 mins.

Very easy. I scrubbed and cut about 6 medium sized potatoes into wedges, put into large zip-loc bag, poured in olive oil and seasoned with Goya Adobo all purpose seasoning. I baked for 45 minutes at 400 degrees on a foil lined baking sheet. This turned out to be an easy three-ingredient recipe that my boyfriend LOVED. I don’t think I’ll be doing mashed potatoes anytime soon (which I now realize is quite labor intensive and dirties way more pans/dishes).

I would not call these French Fries, but they are still good! I usually do this with red potatoes - this was yummy - and of course the kids loved it. Lowered temp to 400 as suggested from other reviewers (thanks!) and flipped with a spatula every 10-15 min. Use less oil then you think you need and spray foil generously with PAM- Thanks!

Wow, just as good as fried!  I doubled the recipe so that I'd have plenty leftover.  I used only half the amount of chili powder (I don't like things hot), and added salt (1/4 tsp. for a double recipe) to the spices.  I baked them for 30 minutes instead of 45, which was perfect (maybe my wedges were thinner?).  I served these with "Portobello Mushroom Burgers" from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this recipes dozens of times, and yes, I rated it a 5.  But, I toss them in Italian salad dressing and sprinkle them with parmesan cheese.  The trick is to bake them on parchment paper, they don't stick and they turn a golden brown.  My kids loves them.

For those of you that thought that this recipe was a 5-star ... WHY?  I followed the recipe to the tee.  Within 8 minutes they started burning AND (silly me) used a cookie sheet that doesn't have sides and the oil was dripping off the cookie sheet.  I wouldn't even know what to do to improve this recipe.  I even read other reviews to be prepared for any changes that I may have needed to do.  Not only were they soggy, but they tasted horribly bland.  Lastly, let me tell you, this is the first time I've ever rated an allrecipes.com recipe poorly.  Sorry Ashlee.  :(

These potatoes were horrid and had to be thrown out--they were so black!  Perhaps I have to accept some blame as I doubled the quantities of oil and spices but the potato I had was so large I decided it was the equivalent of two.  We're enjoying our ribs tonight WITHOUT potatoes.  Too bad!

I followed the advice from other reviewers and cut the potatoes length wise like real french fries.  I thought it would be too oily with the olive oil so I reduced it.  My mistake!  Since I used 3 potatoes, it was not enough.  I also used red potatoes...they have more flavor.  I sprayed the pan with I Can't Believe it's Not Butter to prevent sticking since my olive oil modification, but some still stuck.  I also reduced the temp to 400.  450 was a little too high, even though I like my fries to by crispy ;-).  Will make again!

I used 4 regular sized russett potatoes and I doubled the rest.  Just the right amount of spices, but too much oil.  Next time I will use only 1 TBSP but still double the spices, for my amount of potatoes. After reading the reviews I was going to put salt on the potatoes, but I forgot, They definately need salt!  I will make these again, and experiment with different flavors such as plain salt, parmesean, and herb flavored.  I have a lot of experementing to do.  Oh Yeah, I french fry sliced mine and cooked them for 15 min turned them and cooked for 15 more minutes.  Do not layer/overlap the fries.

I thought these were very easy and very tasty.  You really don't need to use only the spices listed - I think I added cayenne pepper and Season All salt.  I also was baking ribs simultaneously at a lower temp, so I went ahead and put them in at 350 for about 40 minutes or so per side, and they turned out great.  I flipped them halfway through, and also poured off the excess olive oil that had collected on the pan so that they would get crispy.

This recipe is fantastic!  I doubled it and also added about 1 tsp. of salt to the seasonings. It only took about 1/2 hour to bake at 425.

Great recipe.  Kids said the only thing I did wrong was to use potatoes that were too big.  They would have liked smaller wedges (more flavour).  Thanks for the great recipe.

I agree with the other reviewers that the cooking time is way too long!  That said, even though they were a little "crispy," (i.e. burnt) after 45 minutes baking, they still tasted quite good.  Will try again with shorter cooking time.

Very tasty! These are so easy and much healthier than chips or fries.  To speed things along, I cook them in the mixing bowl in the microwave for a few minutes before putting in the oven, and cook for about 15-20 min.

I've made a recipe similar to this, I would suggest not crowding the baking sheet, and it helps to turn them over half way through baking to get even browning.  Try adding some grated Parmesean cheese too.

It is a great recipe but I didn't find the serving estimate accurate.I used 5 potatos just for my husband and myself. This meant adjusting the oil and spices as well.

Loved these! I doubled the recipe and used one russet potato and one sweet potato. The combination of seasonings was delicious. (I also added salt and pepper.)  I will definitely make these again!

Baking these potatoes for 45 minutes at 450 degrees made them completely inedible. I'll be trying it at a lower temperature next time.

45 minutes is WAY TO LONG.  Totally missed the boat on that one.  These fries are burned to a crisp, my house is filled with smoke, and my wife is upset.  

They would have been good I'm sure, but this was a serious oversight.

These were delicious and so easy to make!!!  I used all purpose potatoes, it's what I had on hand,  and for spices I used garlic powder, paprika, and seasoned salt.  I mixed the spices with olive oil in a large ziploc ba and then addes the potatoes.   I took the advice of other users and baked them for 40 min @ 400 degrees turning once after 20 min.  I will definitely be making these again.

These potatoes smell outrageously good while baking.  I added a little salt though and baked them at 400°.  You must watch the clock when you change the cooking temperature because the spices can burn before the potatoes do.  I will make these again.

I ONLY HAD MINE IN THE OVEN FOR 20 MINS-- and they came out fine. Some were almost burnt even. Anyway, if you had these at 450 degrees for 45 minutes your kitchen would be filled with smoke and the aroma of burnt fries. I didn't measure out the seasonings and put a little more in of my favorite seasonings. I also cut my fries less thick than the recipe described. The mixture of oil and seasons was fabulous and my whole family gave me the label 'The French Frie PRO'. ;)

A wonderful recipe.  For a little kick, I added  1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and for additional flavor, I sprinkled some freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  With the coating of olive oil, these fries have the same taste and texture of deep fried french fries.  These fries were a great side dish to the all recipes Neat Sloppy Joes by Aunt Mamie.

I don't usually put chili powder on potatoes so this was unique & a good change of pace.  I lowered the oven temp a little so I could bake some chicken at the same time and everything worked out great.

Baked bar be que chicken and these fries were an awesome combo.  I grow my own garlic so I used crushed fresh garlic instead of powder. We baked these along with the chicken at 350 instead of 400, and baked them for an hour, flipping once.

Delicious, I regret not baking them with more salt. Luckily that's a simple fix even after they're done.

This recipe has so much potential, but when baking these, it becomes very clear, early on,  that 450 degrees is way too much heat for these fries. If I make these again, I will reduce heat to 400 degrees for about 30 minutes instead of 45 minutes.

Delicious. There are so many different "recipes" of fries out there. All variations (and extreme at that!) of different cook temperatures and times. 

I found that 20 minutes was enough depending on how I cut them.

45 minutes will burn the potatoes.  Reduce by at least 10 minutes.  I agree, turning the potatoes is a good idea

Made these the other day to go with some burgers, I love spicy so I added a little more paprika, and a pinch of cayenne.....awesome! Good, fast, easy to make.  Just dont cut them too thin or they turn out crunchy, other than that these were good.

These are a good "healthier" version of french fries and easier to make! I double my seasonings and sprinkle a generous amount of kosher salt on them. To get that fried and crispy coating, broil them for about 5 mins after they come out of the oven!

We try to be pretty healthy eaters, so this recipe is a fun one to use.  The kids love it.  I usually leave the potatoes in the oven longer for a bit more crunch.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

Good seasoning, but the fries were chewy. I was expecting them to be more crispy based on the oil and the temp they were cooked at.

This recipe has become a staple for our burger nights and I will never buy another bag of frozen french fries again. I add a little salt and fresh ground pepper and cut my potatoes into more stick like fries and bake them at 425 for 30 minutes, flipping them over half way through. Such great flavor!

If you're looking for resturant style... keep looking.

We made 4 potatoes worth, but 4x-ing the recipe only covered ONE potato worth of wedges.  :(

Even worse, we detest limp, soggy fries and there is no way to make these crispy.  Leave it in the oven longer than called for... and the herbs just burn and taste nasty!

The rest of the fries we made up just dipped in plain olive oil and salted after.

These fries are excellent!  The only problem I have with them, but it happens every time I make oven fries, is that they aren't crispy enough.  I put them under the broiler for the last 3 minutes of baking and that seems to help.  I also added Lawry's seasoning salt to these fries.  Wonderful flavor!!

After reading other reviews, I modified the cooking temp to 400 and baked for 30 minutes.  The fries turned out great except many stuck to the sheet : (  I even flipped them mid-way.  Still a great recipe that I will make again but I will add non-stick spray in addition to the olive oil.

These lacked in flavor and the cooking time and heat were way off. If you have made french fries from scratch at home before this is a good starting place. 
I suggest 400F and 30min total cook time, remember to rotate in oven half way through cooking. Also sprinkle a little salt before cooking.

I vowed this year to find healthier versions of some of my family's favorites and these baked fries will replace our deep fat fried ones easily. They are so much tastier and no ketchup required! Give this delicious, simple recipe a try.

This recipe is great. It has become a regular side at my home with my family and my youngest daughter loves these "potatoe fries"! Ty so much for sharing this tasty and simple recipe. I have made this serveral times and will make it many more. I have found that we also like to season them with cajun seasoning mix.

These fries were great!  Very easy to make make, too.  I cut the wedges pretty thin because I was pressed for time and wanted them to cook faster.  I reduced the heat a little and they came out perfect!  I did sprinkle some salt on them when they came out of the oven.  For those who said it wasn't spicy enough, I wonder if they were thinking of spicy as in spicy hot. The seasoning was did not make them spicy hot, but my husband and I loved the flavor of the spices on the crispy potato wedges.  We will be making this again!!

Cooked for 45 minutes at 400. Pretty good, but too many spices. Next time I think I'll try them with minced garlic and salt and oil only...Thanks for the easy recipe!

Took the advice from other reviewers and turned halfway through baking. My only problem was that the combination and amount of seasoning (and I love highly seasoned foods) was a little too much on my stomach. They were good but gave my husband and I both horrible indigestion.

This is a great recipe.  Have made these for years, only change is try the red potatoes (not peeled) and add some parsley.  Excellent taste, but that is my preference.

I used a red potato instead and put the wedges into a tupperware, added lots of garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a little bit of cayenne pepper. *ADDITIONS: I also cut an onion into thick slices and layered it on top, and once I shook them up in the container, I spread them in a pan and sprinkled parmesan cheese over them! So delicious! Definitely try this. *NOTE: Like everyone below has said, 450 degrees is overkill. 400 degrees for 30-40 mins depending on your oven should do it!

i've enjoyed this recipe alot.  i change my seasonings all the time, though.  I've followed others' suggestions - putting the ingredients in a plastic bag and tossing the fries in it and turning the fries after 20 minutes or so.  great, thanks!

Best homemade fries I've tried so far!  I cut them into skinny fries and they were done in 25 minutes.  Make sure to turn them half way through the cooking time so as to not burn and stick to the baking sheet.

YUMMY! What else can I say, the flavor combo of the spices were super! We all liked these fries. I eyeballed everything, increased on the EVOO. I quartered my pots, then cut into 3 pieces, so I got 12 wedges that I cut in half. I cooked on 410 for 22 mins then turned em for another 22 mins on 450.  I think that if I would have done 450 the whole cook time, they would've burned. It was pleasantly surprising how great these were...not at all spicy. I made these with Portobella Mushroom Burgers from this site, a very yummy, healthy meal! Thanks for sharing!!

I cut mine in a fries shape with the skin on, added a bit more oil than stated (probably 4-5 tbsp), and mixed in a gallon-sized plastic bag with real minced garlic, pepper, and chili pepper (don't use much salt in general). I baked them at 450 degrees for fifteen minutes each side (turned once). They turned out great! Nice and spicy. We dipped them in Thousand Island dressing to cool off and give a good flavor.

Very good and really easy. I didn't have onion powder so used minced onions (the dried spice). This was a nice change from our regular potatoes. My husband and I liked them dipped in ketchup. I'll make them again when the kids are home to eat them! Using the foil on the pan made clean up easy too. I followed the suggestion for lower temp so did 425 for 30 min. I didn't have to turn them but did check them quite often to be sure they weren't burning.

Absolutely Delicious! I used a mix of white and sweet potatoes and kosher salt to taste. Followed the spices in the recipe. Baked at 400 - worked perfect. Everyone here loved them. We will use this recipe often. Thank you for sharing!

Great! Simple! Added different seasonings to spice it up. Would suggest using a silpat liner so they don't stick.

love these fries!!! i also cut them shoestring since that's the only way my son will eat them. i didn't measure anything out either, just seasoned as i went and they came out great. having them cut thinner does bake faster, so fries were ready to eat in 30 minutes. thanks for the recipe!

I just made these fries today. And they were absolutely delicious. I baked them on 400 degrees for around 32 minutes and they turned out perfectly. I'd definitly bake these again. Outrageously awesome recipe. :D

Hubbie and I use this recipe at least once a week.  Very easy, healthy and no fried mess. Love that! Sometimes we use sweet potatoes and add a little brown sugar.  Either way are great!  We also add a little sea salt of an extra kick.

These were delicious and I will definitely need to double the recipe next time!  I used a mandolin to cut my potatoes into rounds.  Then I placed all of the ingredients into a large Ziploc bag, (I added 2 Tbs of olive oil instead of one), and shook it until the potatoes were evenly coated.  You can play around with the seasonings to make them extra spicy, garlicky, with fresh dill, or whatever!  I covered my baking sheets with foil and sprayed them with Pam to prevent sticking and make for easy clean up.  I baked my potato rounds at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, flipped them over and cooked them another 20 minutes.  Yummy!

I didn't think these were that great. I have to agree with a few people that the temp and time are off because mine came out a little burnt as well but still salvageable. Despite that I didn't think the seasoning was all that fabulous. I would recommend adding salt to anyone considering making this though I don't think I'd make these again.

I placed the potato wedges, olive oil and seasonings in a ziploc bag to mix everything together.  Used chilli powder, onion powder, garlic salt, and cracked pepper.  Also lined baking sheet with foil for easy clean up.  I baked for 30 minutes at 425 degrees, flipping a couple of times.  Ended up broiling for a few minutes to get them crispy.

These were extremely time consuming, but it was worth it! The flavor they had was great! I did raise the temperature a bit and cooked less time, which kept them from overcooking. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Yummy, but the recipe lacks a very important ingredient.  Salt, salt and salt.  Apart from that I'm glad I found this recipe and I'll make french fries over and over again - without the guilt! :)

These are great fries and so easy to make too! I've made these multiple times and I usually use more olive oil and less seasonings, just because that's what I prefer. I also bake them on parchment paper so they don't burn or stick to the pan. Thanks for the great recipe!

Do not cut them much larger than a regular french fry from a fast food restaurant. Dunk them in ice water to get them very stiff. Bake at 400 for 30 mins then crank it up to 500 for another 5 mins or so to get them really crispy. The seasonings are perfect just the way they are!

These fries were soooo good!  My husband isn't a huge fan of baked fries, but he even liked these!  The only changes I made were to use Canola Oil instead of Olive Oil and instead of chili powder, I used an equal amount of seasoned salt.  I put the fries into a plastic ziptop bag, then I mixed together the oil and spices and poured over top and mixed together.  I arranged them in a single layer and then baked them for 30 minutes (I cut them into smaller fries than the recipe called for).  I will definitely make this recipe again and again!  Goes great with the Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers also found on this site!

We quadrupled the recipe and it was still amazingly tasty! (Review from 9 year old.)    I also experimented with using a lot less oil, and found that works out well, we just put the mixture in a bowl and had to stir more.  We also tried this with yams and sweet potatoes and it was good with those, too.

these were good - but i thought they needed some "help".  when mixing the spices it seemed like it was going to be a lot!  but after testing them 1/2 way though cooking...i thought they were REALLY bland!  at that point i added generous salt/pepper & same parsley.  after taking them out i sprinkled them immediatly with some parmesan cheese!  next time i'll increase the spices even more!  oh...and i took the advice of reviewers and baked at 400 for 40min flipping 1/2 way.  next time i may increase to 425 to make sure they get crispy!

My Husband and I really liked these! We sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on them as well. I also tried it with sweet potatoes and it was great that way, too!

Fantastic way to make fries! Adding other veggies to make along with this is even better to go along with the meat of a meal.   WAY-TO-GO!

The taste was good, however a little tedious for me. I kept having to turn them to induce browning of some, and prevent scorching of others. So I will tinker with the method of cooking maybe use to cookie sheets and place one on top of the other then flip. Just so I am not constantly opening the oven and loosing heat. Overall they were good fries.

I loved them, my husband did not.  He thought they were too bland.  I disagree but next time will make some variations to suit his tastes; there's a lot you could do w/ this recipe.  (garlic salt, Johnny's...)  I put everything in a ziplock to help distribute the oil/seasonings; that works well.  Beware of cooking time, my fries were too thin to be cooked for 45 minutes, they came out burnt but still delicious.  This recipe is a keeper.  If you don't care for it the first time it can easily be tweaked to taste different the next time.

**Edit** Made them a second time using only olive oil, garlic salt, and seasoning salt, they were fabulous, changing rating from 4 to 5 stars!**

My husband loved these fries. I followed the adice of fellow reviews and my fries turned out great. Almost a little over cooked on the slightly thinner peices. I did use the ziploc baggy, as well as  put the oven to 400 degrees. I would suggest however if your fries are thinner than a 1/4 inch think to cook them for only 35 mins. I did 40 and it was a little over done. They taste really great with ranch. I served them with catfish fillets.

These fries were so great and a perfect side for burgers.  I didnt have onion powder but they still came out great. My only suggestion would be to bake them for just a little less time. I would suggest about 35 minutes so they dont get so crispy. Delicious recipe!

Considering that these were healthy, it was pretty good but not great. It was a lil on the bland side. Needs a little bit of salt maybe before baking. It baked up nicely though. Crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. If you dont want soggy fries, I suggest cuting them thinner and not into wedges.

Very good, but they need salt and pepper, this makes them much less bland. I baked them at 400 for about 45 minutes. If you want a healthier option, substitute some or all of the oil with egg white. It's not quite as good (maybe deserving of 4 stars rather than 5), but it's definitely still tasty. 

EDIT: I tried these in the pan this time rather than baking. Microwaved pre-cut red potatoes, skins on, for about 8 min on high with a bit of water and chopped fresh garlic, then sprayed with low-cal butter spray and cooked over medium heat for about 10 min. Just as good, and quicker.

These fries were good, but I was hoping the seasoning would have just a little bit more flavor. I will probably make these again, but will perhaps add some additional spices, maybe some cayenne pepper or cajun seasoning to add a little bit of kick. Also, I felt that the fries could have used a touch of salt.  All in all, these are far better than fried french fries, or store-bought frozen ones.

Great fries!  I followed everything pretty much exactly except that I reduced the oven temperature to 425 like some reviewers suggested.  They came out crunchy and tasty!!  My picky husband and 2 year old ate them up!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!!!

I sliced these a bit too thin and they ended up more done than I would have liked, but because that was my fault and everything else was perfect (great flavor!), these get five stars!

I added Lawry's seasoning salt and regular salt and flipped them once while in the oven.  I made my strips thick so the temp and cooking time were suitable.  I'm definitely making these again!!!  :)

Have made these 2 times now & it just is a waste of time. Though there are spices used, you don't taste any. I tried reducing the paprika & chili power, but still it was blah.

These were really good, and a great alternative to fried.  When I eat french fries, I like the greasiest, soggy  ones, and these satisfied that craving without the grease.  The flavor was good too. I will make these again.

Perfect if you are trying to stay away from fried foods. I usually add about a tablespoon of parmesean cheese. I'll take these over fried french fries any day.

These fries are delicious and a healthier alternative to frying!  I followed the recipe's ingredients exactly. The only change I made was to bake them at 425 for about 12 min, flipped them over and baked another 12-13 minutes.  They were perfect!

These were so good!  My kids ate them up and they usually don't like anything with spice.  Excellent served with ranch to dip them in.  I used about 6 potatoes, 4T olive oil and 2t. of each of the spices.  Threw everything in a sealable bag and shook to coat.  Will be making these again for sure.

I am new to cooking and trying to eat healthy.  This was the first recipe I tried because I love fries, but I know they are not very healthy for me. Cooking these was so easy and they tasted better than Mcdonalds to me!  I made it just as the recipe called for and the spice was fine for me(though I am not big on spicy food).  If you are a beginner, this is a good place to start.

My husband and I love these! I use the gallon bag and bake at 400 or 425 for 40ish minutes. I add paprika, garlic powder (or freshly minced garlic), salt, pepper, cayenne. If I had more spices I would add those as well. *grin* Great recipe.

Great tasting fries. I added a little salt to the mixture before coating the potatoes. I made the mistake of trying to cook them ahead of time then reheating them when it was time to eat. Straight out of the oven taste much better.

This is a keeper.  Take the 400 degree and 30 minute advice; I didn't and fries almost completely burned.  Extremely yummy.  Goes crazy-great with the Brown Sugar Meatloaf on this web site.  Also recommend using the ziploc idea to coat the fries: shake and bake.

Really easy and really yummy! I have made this 3 or 4 times, sometimes using 2 russet potatoes or 2 large red potatoes. I like to use garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and extra chili powder. Really good with burgers or steak!

These were tasty.  I liked the seasoning.  I cooked a little in the microwave first.  I would not reccomend this approach.  They never got crispy.  I'll try again with full cook time in the oven.

I made these the other night and they were very good.  The herbs give them a nice kick.  My wife thought they were a bit spicy but that's the way I like them.  They were good but they weren't the restaurant style I'm looking for.

I dip the wedges in egg white instead of olive oil to cut back on some fat, and then spray the cookie sheet with nonfat cooking spray.  They come out awesome, nobody can tell that they are virtually fat free!

I must say, this recipes as is probably only gets 3 stars. However, I read several reviews and took their advice. I used a zip lock bag and mixed in italian dressing (Kens steakhouse is amazing), some olive oil, and all the listed recipe seasonings. The only thing I did differently was pour the whole concoction out onto a foiled cookie sheet (cup the sides so it doesn't run). 15 minutes, flip, 15 minutes...salt and pepper...enjoy..= 5 star

These baked fries are good.  I followed the advice of others and cooked at 425 degrees and turned them after 15 minutes.  My were done in a total of 30 minutes.  I used a ziplock baggie and put the spices in with the oil and then I dumped the raw potatoes in to evenly coat.  I doubled the spices, but the chili powder was overwhelming so I won't do that again.

these were delicious! i followed other suggestions about cooking for 15 minutes and then turning them and then cooking another 15....worked great! a little too much oil so they weren't as crispy as we like-next time i won't use as much!

I normally read the reviews before I try a recipe but I didn't bother this time and now I'm wishing I had. My fries were charred after 30 minutes (45 minutes at 450 degrees is way too long at too high of heat ~ I should have known better; I've been cooking for a long time now ~my bad) and seasoning salt would have been a welcome addition. I thought the mixture of spices would be flavorful enough but a bit of salt is definately needed here. I'm going to try them again though (with the modifications).

These fries were pretty good. I could defintely see why some reviewers felt that salt was needed though.  I also think that the 45 minutes alotted at 450 is too much.  My potatoes were a little charred, next time I will reduce the baking time.

It was so-so.  I didn't love the blend of spices, but I ate them.  I baked them in a toaster oven for about 25 minutes at 350 degrees F.  I cut them into long pieces (like you would find at fast food places) instead of wedges.

I went a little light on the spices - these were for the kids only.  The kids at them up, but for adults I would definitely add more spice.  A little bland for my taste.  A nice alternative to purchased fries.

These were good-easy to make. My husband loved them, and they tasted like any kind of steak fries you'd buy at the store. I think the cooking time should be extended a little-we baked ours for 50 minutes, and they were still a little hard. Other than that, they were a hit! Thanks!

Very tasty!  I doubled this recipe and added 1 tsp cayenne pepper and about of 1 tablesppon of cajun seasoning.  I cut mine into sticks (we don't like wedges.  I baked them at 425 for 15 on each side, and they turned out perfect.  Not one fry was left over.

I normally bake my french fries in the first place but I have never added the variety of seasonings this recipe called for.  This was pretty good and although the receipe didn't call for salt, rarely are french fries good without it! That should almost be automatic! I doubled the recipe and they disappeared pretty fast! Thanks Ashlee!

The baked fries were very good. I do agree with the other reviews only cook for only 25-30 minutes. I also turned them once. They are worth making. Thanks Ashlee

I think I would take these out of the oven a little earlier than the recipe says, but they were very tasty.  I saw a similar receipe in Men's Health a long time ago, and had been looking for this ever since.

Delicious, especially with a grilled steak. Very tasty. My kids just didn't like the potato skins.

These fries were not as good as i expected them to be. All the fries did not fit in my cookie sheet and the recipe doesn't specify if you could layer the fries in the cookie sheet.

I'm bad at measuring, so I just poured approximate of the ingredients over it (make sure you don't over-do the olive oil if using this method). I used the exact time and temp recommended and they came out perfectly! If you're looking for crunchier, obviously just cut your fries thinner and watch them like a hawk. I can't stop making them now! I put them on a sprayed aluminum lined baking sheet and shook them gently half-way through. No trouble getting them off the pan. Made some sriracha aioli to dip in - TASTY.

Just used 2 russet baking potatoes for 2 people.  Seasoned with paprika, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt, chili powder, and olive oil. Put all in a gallon bag and mixed.  Cut them into sticks instead of wedges because I didn't have enough time. Baked at 425 for about 30 min. Turned once. I would recommend putting them on parchment paper. Some of them stuck to my foil.

Great recipe but ovens definitely vary. Adding some salt and cooking on 400f for 30 minutes, flipping in the middle, should be perfectly fine for this even with a fully loaded baking sheet/tray. Was delicious!

This recipe was absolutely amazing!!! I started out by cutting four small potatoes into wedges and sticks. Then I used garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, and olive oil. I put the potatoes into a big bowl and put the spices and oil in. I kinda just went with what I thought was good. Then I used my hands to mix it all around. Messy, but it got everything even. Then I put them into the oven. I looked at the reviews from this recipe and decided to change it to 30 minutes and at 400 degrees. I didn't turn them because even with aluminum under then they were hard to turn halfway because. It was difficult. I then took them out of the oven and they were delicious!!! This was so easy!!

Very nice fries.  I made them twice.  Once just as the recipe says and they were great. Another time I used real onions and cut them in to very thin slices and cooked them . Very good.

I made these last night, and are they ever good. I'lll never buy frozen french fries again. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding some garlic pepper that Winco carries in their bulk section and cayenne pepper as well. 

The other reviewers are correct about the temperature. Seems like 400 is the optimum. It took about 30 minutes in my convection oven.

Excellent recipe.  Will definitely make again.  I sliced 4 medium potatoes into small jo jo sizes or large steak fry size. I only used 1/2 tspn of spice for all 4 potatoes and it was perfect.  Also, I cooked on 400, turned once at 20 minutes and then cooked an additional 20.  Family really liked them.

These are amazing! I might never purchase french fries again. I agree with the reviewer about the time and temperature. I would bake these at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes instead of the full 45 minutes at 450 degrees. I made these again and added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to make Cajun-style fries and they were delicious!

Great and easy recipe, have made them 3 times and they just get better every time.The only spice I added was a 1/4 tsp of Rosemary, made a nice   addition to the flavor. I  placed a large Pampered Chef stone in the oven while it was preheating then added the fries, mine took only 27 mins. Thanks for the good eats Ashlee. Margaret.

This recipe didn't work at all. The recipe didn't call to grease the baking sheet and the fries got stuck. I had to scrape them off with a spatula. What was intended to be baked French Fries turned out to be baked Mashed Potatoes.

I would recommend greasing your baking sheet before you put the fries in the oven.

My family, and quite frankly I, was amazed at how easy to make and awesome these fries turned out. You have to be patient with the baking time but they are SO worth the wait! I'll never buy frozen French fries again.

These are the very best baked fries I've ever tried. I make these as written, just with a bit of kosher salt usually thrown in with the spices. I also use an oven heated to 400 degrees and I do turn them part way through the cooking time. I just pull them out when browned and cooked through-- about 30 minutes or so. I've been making these potatoes about once a week for several years now and everyone loves them.

Made these tonight and they came out great. Used a previously made cajun seasoning instead of listed spices, and cooked at 400 for 35 minutes, flipping the fries halfway through. Thanks to OP and other reviewers for contributing:)

Soaked the potatoes in cold water for several minutes. Sprayed potatoes with cooking spray after draining. Mixed low sodium seasoned salt with chilli powder and cayenne pepper. Added dry mixture to moistened potatoes and mixed until evenly coated.
Baked at 425 for 25 minutes (checking occasionally) turned and baked for an additional 20 minutes.
Seemed to be a winner in our house.

This was a disaster. I made sure that everything was measured to the correct amount, that the oven temperature was correct, and the potato wedges were rather large. The recipe says to leave them in for 45 minutes. I checked them 30 minutes in and they were already burnt to a crisp.

IMO, we did not care for these. Next time I will just use olive oil and salt. Did not taste the spices used.

Excellent? The only reason I can't give this five stars is because the recipe lacks salt and therefore would be too bland. I added a pinch of salt and it tasted great. Putting the fries in salt water for two hours will make them crispier.

I have made these type of potato wedges for years, you can use just about any spice that turns your taste buds. I gave it a 3 star because 450 is too hot and 45 minutes too long. I bake mine for 30 minutes and then to brown the top I put the broiler on for the last 5 minutes or so.

I have made oven fries this way for many years and I vary the seasonings and spices.  I use minced fresh garlic instead of powdered garlic.  I add a teaspoon or so of Dijon mustard (depending on amount of potatoes), lemon pepper  and also shake some grated Parmesan cheese into the seasoning mixture before tossing. As others have mentioned, time should be adjusted according to the thickness of the fries.  I find they turn out best if baked on a flat baking sheet rather than on one with sides.........they brown better this way and are easier to turn.  These fries are so much better than any served at fast food places and so much healthier too!  I also do roasted potatoes this way with similar seasoning and just adjust the cooking time.  Great for fingerlings too!

These tasted very good.  I sprinkled ours with a little salt before baking and recommend cooking these at 400-425 degrees in the oven and turning half way through the cooking process.  400 degrees seemed a bit too low as these weren't browning enough at that temperature so I ended up setting the oven to 425 degrees half way through baking these.  Easy and delicious.

I omitted the paprika (because my husband brought me home more chili powder instead of paprika!) and added dried parsley and it was very yummy!
I did toss them about every 15 minutes to evenly cook them and I turned the heat down to 425 which was perfect for 40 mins. I will make these again!

These were really good.  They had just the right amount of seasoning.  I didn't have to bake them for the full 45 minutes, so make sure you check on them after 35 minutes if you bake them at 450 degrees.

The potatos need to be soaked first but the seasoning was great! The potatos just need to be softer by time everything is said and done. I added just a little salt, probably about a teaspoon.

Very good!! And fairly healthy for fries! I just eyeball the spices and I add quite a bit but do be careful not to add to much.. I made this mistake once and it was like eating the spices straight from the jar.
I make these often with tilapia fillets. Yum!

Very good! I left out the paprika, forgot about it, but still good. I mixed everything in the bowl I soaked the 'taters' in and then spread out on a foil lined cookie sheet. Baked @400 for 30 minutes, flipped and baked another 30 minutes.

Very tasty and easy! My son kept going on and on about how tasty these were. Another similar recipe calls for a lot more oil so I was pleased that these turned out crispy without all the additional fat. Simple recipe that can be altered to your tastes. Thanks!

Fantastic! Great flavor. Make sure to test the crunchiness out before you remove them from the oven because the spices make them look as if they're burnt. Everyone loved them!

I baked for about 45 minutes, flipping each of the wedge pieces over halfway through cooking.

If I were to do this again:
- I'd try baking for 30 minutes instead (flipping them over at the 15 minute mark). I think that would be enough.

I love baking fries. I find the cooking time to be too long and usually only back them for 20-25 minutes, depending on the shape/size. I often get lazy and just use cajun seasoning instead of this mixture, but I do enjoy this combination of spices.

As other reviewers said, 450 is WAY too high and 45 minutes was not necessary - 30-35 min at 400 degrees did the trick for me.  I didn't have onion powder but they came out great anyway.  delicious and healthy home made fries!

Awesome baked fries! Loved the mix of seasoning that take these over the top. I used red skin potatoes sliced thinner than wedges. My seasoning mix was chili, garlic and onion powder and cajun seasoning. I agree with others who said to be very liberal with the spices because they tend to get lost in translation with the oil. With the thinner cut I baked them at 425 for 30 mins, flipping after 15 and broiling them for about 3 mins at the end. Great tasting seasoned fries!

What a great healthy alternative to a food my teen loves. You could add any of our favourite spices to change things up. A favourite in our house now.

I thought these were fantastic.  They came out deliciously crisp, just what I was looking for.  I did coat the pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil to ensure crispiness.

The time and temp are way off.  I don't know how thick people are cutting their potatoes, but at 450 mine only needed 10-15 minutes and still came out partially burned.  They seem to taste ok.  Next time I will definitely tweak the temperature and hope the really do taste good.

These were really delicious. I added a little fresh black pepper and seasoned with salt prior to cooking. Baked at 400 degrees for 35 minutes turning halfway through, I will add another 10 minutes next time to crisp them up a bit but I think 450 would cause them to burn.

These were awesome - I'd just do less chili powder next time and more salt or seasoned salt instead.

Great french fries! I added salt and decreased the temp to 410. I baked for 15 minutes, turned them, and baked for another 15 minutes. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the seasoning was not evenly spread on the fries. I think next time I will coat the potatos with oil first and then add the seasoning (instead of doing it all at once). But they were delicious and I will make them again. Thank you!

awesome fries:) much better than frozen! I quartered my potatoes so I had really thick wedges and the time and temp worked perfectly for me but I could see if you cut them thinner you might need to adjust time and temp. My family likes thick wedges so this recipe is perfect for us. I also put everything in a gallon ziplock bag so I didn't have to clean up a bowl and the kids love shaking the bag for me! Thanks for sharing:)

These were delicious and much healthier than buying fries.  Gave it four starts because, like others, the cooking time/temp needed to be 30 min at 400 and flipped half-way through.  And add some salt.  But whew they were yummy!

Half of mine burnt.  I think I made them too thin.  I will do more of a wedge next time of cook less time.  Seasoning was good though.

My family loved these fries.  I loved being able to use my new Williams and Sonoma chopper to make the fries :)  They were so easy to make and I felt good feeding them to my family knowing they weren't fried.

I sliced the taters and popped them in the microwave for 3 mins, stirred and cooked 3 more. This made cooking time much shorter. I added more of my own seasoning (cumin, parsley, diced onion, garlic salt) and increased the olive oil. This gave it a good coat and they crisped up nicely. As written, I had to give it 3 stars, but it's a great starting point.

Very tasty that is for sure.... I do have a few recommendations though... Add more oil per spice mixture... It will go a lot further that way... also these need salt i shook a little lawry's seasoning salt over mine when I ain't them... Great that way... I also cut mine thinner baked at 400 and flipped them half way through... With the few small changes definately 5 stars

I made these fries the other night they were a big hit with my family. I left out the paprika( I didn't have any) and they still tasted great. I made the recipe for 5 and the website calculated for me the only difference I would make next time is less olive oil. I cooked them an extra 10 min too because we like our fries crispy. I will make these again and again. It's also a kid friendly recipe I let my 4 yr old add the ingredients into a zip lock bag with the potatoes and she shaked it all up too.

Tonight I felt like eating French fries, but didn’t want to buy frozen French Fries, (hardly on sale anymore) or fast food fries (cooked with salt, unhealthy oils, etc.). I searched for baked French Fries and discovered this recipe. After reading many of the reviews, I made them.  I can’t believe how easy it is! I was out of onion powder and used “vege-sal” along with the paprika, garlic and chili powders. "Vege-sal" is the sister spice to “spike” (which Cardell used) but without the salt. These fries are delicious and the baking time was only 35 minutes at 400 degrees. When the fries browned after 5 minutes, I reduced the heat to 375 for a while. They are so tasty that I didn’t drench them with ketchup, to taste the spices. I can’t wait to serve them to my family and next guests! Thank you Ashlee for a great recipe!

I have made these fries three times, the first two times I followed the recipe and they earned four star; the third time I used a seasoning called "spike" (best season every!) garlic salt, and onion powder and they were amazing....five stars!!

Pretty good! The house smelled phenominal while they were baking.  All the kids and the hubby loved them and want me to make again. I wasn't as in love with them, but still pleased. Liked them a lot better with some garlic salt. I had no problems with burning at 450 for 45 minutes, but I followed the directions, and had some pretty thick wedges. Thanks for sharing!

very good and easy!  I was worried they weren't going to get crispy, but once I took them out of the over and let them cool a little, they were fine.  We're going to experiment with other flavors now.  Parmesan cheese, taco seasoning, who knows!

Thanks, these are awesome every time!  Why buy the frozen ones that are way too pricey?  When I feel like being a little healthy about it I spray them with fat free cooking spray then sprinkle seasonings on generously.  But with only 1 tbls of olive oil it's kind of silly to even do that.

I followed the comments suggestions and cooked for 400f for about 35 minutes and  they turned out well, if not a little burnt on some that I'm guessing were over-seasoned. Otherwise came out pretty well!

Like many others I am giving this four stars because the cooking time is way off.  I cut potatoes into about 15 wedges (quite thin) and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, flipped potatoes, then cooked an additional 15 minutes.  35 minutes at 400 is plenty of cooking time.  I kept the spices as listed except I didn't use onion powder because I didn't have any.  We were eating these with gravy so they didn't need a ton of flavor on their own.  Overall, a great recipe, just watch your oven temp!

Easy and taste good.  I used russet potatoes fresh from garden and cut each into 12 wedges. Baked at 425 for 30 minutes turning once.  Lower temperature and less bake time was perfect.

Good taste.  I cooked them on 450 for 20 minutes, then 400 for another 20.  I wish they would have been crispy, but they were not.

3 1/2 Stars: These fries were pretty good, but came out slighly mushy. I prefer more crispy fries. I sprinkled rosemary on half of them and was very pleased with the results.

These are a nice alternative Ashlee.. not sure about the oven temp though.. I reduced based on some of the other posters and cut the time down to 20 mins before flipping and doing 15 mins more.  Who ever thinks they are bland or dry.. may have overcooked them?  They are very nice, although I think I prefer them as chunks of potato - red skinned or new.  They are just good no matter what shape they are!  THanks for sharing.

The time and temperature really do need adjusting on this recipe. I bake them at 400 degrees for twenty minutes a side. If you flip them they cook more evenly and you avoid having burnt fries. My husband says these are better than store bought. Plus, they are a lot healthier.

YUM YUM YUM  I sliced into sticks, put them on a pie plate, added the spices, tossed well and baked at 450 for about 20 minutes (give or take).  Perfect.  I served it with Jaeger Schnitzel for German night at our house.

I will never buy a bag of frozen french fries again.  I made this with red potatoes (because that's what I had), sliced into thin sticks.  They were so good and the whole family thought the spices were perfect.

The first time I made these, I didn't add the chili powder, b/c my little girl was going to eat them. They still turned out amazing! My husband was even shocked, he asked me where I bought them! I also did 425degrees at 30mins and turned them at the halfway mark, they could have gone longer though, without any burning if you like crispier fries. I added salt and pepper and they were delicious!

These are delicious!  Any time we think about making french fries, we always come to this recipe! :)  A good tip is to mix everything in a gallon-sized ziploc bag (much easier than trying to coat the potatoes in a bowl).  Also, we use a lot more potatoes than the recipe calls for, but we still adjust the oven temp to about 425...and only for about 30-35 minutes so they don't burn.  Good stuff!!!

VERY yummy as is. I didn't measure exactly so I may have put on more spices than called for. Did sweet potatoes and russet since I didn't have enough russet, and I liked russet better. But sweet wasn't bad at all.

These fries were alright,but the seasoning definitely didn't infuse very well,i know this sounds strange but let it marinade for a little bit and the flavors will definitely be stronger in those fries.:)

Wonderful and easy!  I tripled the recipe using 3 potatoes.  I put the oil and spices in a ziplock baggie, left the skins on and let my 2 and 4 year old help shake it up.  Once they were well coated I let them sit in the baggie while I prepared chicken strips for the oven.  My husband thought the fries were store bought!  Yum Yum!  Thanks for a great recipe!

they were good the ones that were not burned.  I looked at them at 40 min and they were mostly burned.  but that is most likely my fault since I cut them thiner like regular fries.  My bad...lol  So my suggestion is to cut them like steak fries and they should be ok, or if you like them thinner, reduce the cooking time.

Delicious! I put everything in a gallon plastic bag to coat the potatoes evenly, and use a fellow reviewer's suggestion of using a cooling rack over a foil lined baking sheet for easy clean up and no turning!

these were pretty good. I liked the taste the olive oil and seasoning gave it. I cooked it for a little less time cause I like  fries a little soft. It looked like they were burning but it was just the dark seasoning cooking into the potatoes.

Yum!  Very good with sweet potatoes, too.  Just make sure to bake them on a high enough temp because they have less structure than white potatoes.

Made this last night - yum!  I also reduced the heat to 400 degrees and baked them for 40 minutes, turning at 20 minutes.  I had a little of the dressing left over once I put them on a baking sheet, so when I turned them over I just added a little extra.  I topped them with cheddar cheese and... wow... I'll be making these again!

These were delicious.  I didn't have any paprika so made them without it, and they turned out yummy anyways.  I can only imagine the extra oompf if I'd been able to add that too.   This is a keeper recipe so I'll add it next time....

***A bit of advice for those of you who are having a hard time with the fries sticking to the pan...USE PARCHMENT PAPER!!  It works wonders and you won't have to wash your pan.***  I've been making a rendition of these for a while now but this is the first time I've seen a recipe of the like that called for paprika so I was interested in trying it.  I took the time/temp issues into consideration so I followed the crowd and baked them at 400 for 45minutes.  However, they burned before time was even up.  As far the flavor of the ones that didn't burn, they needed a lot of salt because they were a little bland and believe me, I love spice so I used PLENTY! All in all, I will stick to my old, and much better, recipe and refrain from using this one EVER again.

These were really great! We live overseas and frozen fries are pretty expensive.  These obviously took more time than frozen but well worth the effort!  I followed the directions for the most part but not sure how much oil I actually used. They didn't seem like they were getting crispy enough so I just poured on more oil.  They didn't get terribly crispy (like fast food fries) but they were great! They did get kind of soggy once they were out of the oven so make sure everyone is ready to eat when you pull them out of the oven.

French fries are one of my favorite foods and these are amazing, so good and good for you.  We make these a lot and my kids say they are better than any they've ever had.  In the summer we wrap them in foil and cook them on the BBQ to avoid heating up the house.  About 15 minutes on each side. So yummy.

Good stuff! I used 2 russet potatoes and kind of eyeballed the spice measurement.  I accidentally left out the chili powder but they came out fine. Also added salt. Be careful to bake these in a single layer because they fall apart when you dont.

I have made this many times now, but still haven't had the chance to use potato wedges.  I have however used the frozen shoestring fries, and dumped them in a large ziploc.  Poured some oil in to coat the fries, then added all the spices (but added seasoning salt- it needs it)  I did turn it over 1/2 way through, and have never been disapponted with this one.  I will really have to try potato's one time!  It's just so easy using frozen fries!

These weren't bad.  If I make them again I will definatly lessen the seasoning.  You do not need to apply that much.  It just comes out way to strong.  They were good besides that.

Very good! These will be my new french frie recipe! Although I do recomend doubling the spice part of the recipe and leaving the oil the same. The flovor was there...but it could have been stronger. never the less very good!

Oooh, these were so yummy! I used a comparable amount of cayenne pepper in place of paprika. I also turned down the temp a little bit (and flipped them 1/2 way through) since I cut my fries thin.

I love my fries crispy so I made the cuts rather thin.  I also took another reviewer's advice and coated them by tossing them in plastic bag with the mixture.  They were great - flavorful enough to eat on their own, but not too flavorful to overwhelm any type of dipping sauce.

The only reason I rated it 4 stars and not five is because I only heated my oven to 400º vs original temp. and I did add salt to taste (which I am glad I did)... Otherwise this was an awesome, super delicious recipe and for once I was proud of the Baked French Fries I made. They were perfectly cooked inside and out (with a bit of a crisp on the outside and a tasty potato inside). I made sure to stir them up every 5 minutes or so...   I thought these were TDF and the only thing I will do next time to better this recipe is instead of the 3 serving recipe I did this time I will do a 6 serving (because I could of ate them all by myself)...  BTW: both my young children loved and that is saying something. Thank you for the recipe, very happy with the results and it is now saved "forever" in my recipe box.

Better than frozen - more healthy than fried - mixed in 1 sweet potato with regular ones. Lowered temp a bit and did them a little longer. They were good.

yummy!  i do agree with many of the other reviewers on time/temp: i cut my potatoes into fries more than wedges, and baked them in the oven at 425 degrees for about 35 minutes or so.  nice and crispy, but not burnt.  i also added cayenne pepper, garlic powder instead of onion salt, and was a little more liberal than 1/2 teaspoon with all the spices. they turned out great!

Much better than normal oven fries, I used onion salt rather than onion powder. And also, added 1/4 tsp lawreys salt per other reviewers suggestions.  Based on both of these, they were too salty.  Need to tone down salt next time.   ****** UPDATED ******* I repeated the recipe again and used the onion salt again, but did not add any additional salt - were perfect!

I like these a lot. I resized it for 9 servings (1 5-lb bag of white potatoes). The amount of oil it suggests at 9 servings isn't quite on target--reduce it a bit. I still had oil left in the ziploc bag! You can't really go wrong with this recipe as long as you use good sense when it comes to the cooking part :)

Yummy! Satisfied my french fry craving and was much healthier than deep fat frying. I cut the potatoes into small french fry style and it took less time to bake, which was great with two starving children. :) I am going to try the recipe with sweet potatoes next time to try and make it even healthier!

Good recipe overall. They are a nice alternative to french fries that are fried. Next time I would reduce either the time cooked or the temperature because some of the fries were just a little bit too done.

I liked them and will have them again. They were not great, but I think I did something wrong. They were good as far as fries go, just not what I was hoping for. When I try them again I will report back.

These were very good. I also added S&P and some other seasonings to liven it up. I mixed everything in a Ziploc bag, shook it, and dropped them on a pan. So easy. Will make again!

I made these exactly as instructed, but I also sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese over top right before I baked them. My husband and all of my kids gobbled them up, with my teenage son declaring these the best he has ever had! Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Great baked fries! I've been making something similar for years, but enjoyed the spice combination of this recipe. I cut the fries slightly thicker than McDonald's. Mixed in a gallon-size zipper bag, didn't measure anything. Went with other reviewers advice and baked at 400F for 45 minutes turning halfway through. The fries turned out perfect!

I was SO disappointed with this recipe!  The seasoning mixture came out like a thick paste and I wasn't able to cover the fries with it without adding more oil.  Half the fries came out mushy and half came out burnt to a crisp.  The ones that were actually edible tasted overpoweringly like chilli powder.  My family wouldn't eat them either.  I ended up throwing them all away.

These were really good.  I cut up my potatoes and placed them in a ziploc bag.  I then added the olive oil and spices to the bag and shook to coat the potatoes.  I placed them on a foil lined cookie sheet and baked at 400 degrees for about 45-50 minutes.  Turned out great..

These were good, I used five potatoes,I should have added a little more spice, I doubled up on it all, but I should have used a little more chili powder. Will be making again.

Great recipe! I agree with other posters...400 degrees for 45 minutes - turning them twice. I also added parmesan cheese for extra flavor which turned out great! My kids (ages 3.5 and 1.5) LOVED this also.

Try the Reynolds no stick foil...makes turning possible. I have been doing something like this for years.  Try olive oil spray, I cut potatoes, rinse in cold water, dry with CLOTH. 'Dump' in bag, add seasonings, mix. Spray foil..yup no stick I spray too, spray potatoes, toss at 1/2 way point, I use tongs. spray again,,sometimes add seasoning salt at this point..play with it. It's worth the choices.. I make sliced potatoes the same way/at the same time they take less time to cut!! these I either serve, or store for 2-4 days, & use later..Less time in oven then or fry in butter..

Awesome potatoes!  My family of five (picky eaters included) wiped these out in one meal.  I stuck to the original recipe and made no changes.  They were perfect.

These were good, but make sure you follow the 400 degrees for 25-30 min and flip over 1/2 way through but also make sure you don't put the oil in the bottom of the baking sheet they don't end up crispy at all. I should of known better but following orginal recipe and I also added less oil then called for. Who knows great base recipe easy to tweak with and change to make it your own

Great and easy recipe! I think you could add whatever spices you like and it would still turn out good. I used fresh garlic, italian seasoning, s&p, and a little cayenne.

I made these cutting my potatoes into thin fries. Baked at 400 for 30 mins and mixed them 15 mins in. I also used my garlic crusher to added 3 cloves minced garlic and quadrupled the recipe. They were really good! They definately needed salt!!  I will add to mixture before baking next time!

Pretty good! I peeled 3 small potatoes(i don't like skins), sliced them into thin wedges, oiled the sheet, and only needed to bake them for 20 minutes. I didn't have garlic or onion powder on me, so I used the minced versions instead, which were potent enough. I've made this before, and the ingredients don't differ that much.

These were just ok.  The spice mixture wasn't nearly as flavorful as I was hoping.  I would recommend using fresh minced garlic, salt, paprika and onion powder along with the olive oil.  I don't think the chili powder added anything.  Make sure you have enough oil to coat.  

Also, if you cut large wedges, then 40-45 min at 400 degrees is plenty.  If they're smaller wedges, then check after 20 min and adjust accordingly - probably around 30 min is enough.

I thought these were excellent. I was out of olive oil so I used vegetable and it worked just fine. I also sprinkled with salt at the end of baking.

I think this is the best homemade fry recipe I've tasted. They don't have that day-old flavor that you get with frozen.  My husband says he still prefers deep-fried fries, but the health factors alone make this a perfect choice in my book- especially for my kids!!!
I did add some Lawry's seasoned salt when they came out of the oven.  I also took some advice from other reviews and baked three potatoes, sliced about 1/4"-1/2" thick for 45 mins at 400'
I'll definitely make again!

these were pretty good. the coating of spices and oil kinda got burnt so the flavor came out bland, but the texture was good. i baked mine at 425 degrees for 45 min.

Really good!!!  I didn't use the spices listed, substituted for seasoning salt.  Baked at 450 for 45 minutes, flipping once, and they came out PERFECT!!  Crispy on outside, soft on inside....real tasty!!  Family loved them and will be made instead of buying frozen french fries in future!!

These are absolutely delish! I doubled the olive oil to 2 Tbsps. and added a shake of salt and pepper. (Plus, I already had all the ingredients on hand. Added bonus!) I learned the first time that 450 for even 30 minutes is waaaay too long, so now I cook them at 425-450 for 20-25 minutes and they come out PERFECT! Sprinkled with Lawry's seasoned salt and a side of ketchup, these make a GREAT snack or side dish! My boyfriend thought there was too much chili powder, but I love the wonderful flavor and wouldn't change a thing!! Thanks for sharing with us!!

Awesome recipe.I cut them into steak size fries and baked them for 30 min. Next time I will add a little more chilli powder and some salt also spray pan really well with pam spray before baking. Left overs make good home fries for the next days breakfast. Add chopped up onions with cut up fries and fry until done. Delicious.

Loved this recipe.  I cut my wedges on the large side, used the center rack and kept a close eye on them while baking.  Came out perfect as directed.  As far as salting, I left that up to the individual eater, 1/2 my family salted theirs, 1/2 didn't.  Thank you for sharing.

My husband and I love this recipe!!!  We have had made these fries five or six times since the beginning of the year.  Great with burgers and a cold one.  We just put all the ingredients in a zip lock and shake, shake, shake!  Add a little extra oil if you have any trouble.  We like to add a little seasoning salt.  It is great just as written too.  My favorite part is that it is good for the waist line unlike "fried fries".

SO good - worth the wait for the long baking time...crispy on the outside, soft inside!  I guess on the spice amounts, whatever looks good, and sometimes add some cayenne for extra spice, and only shake maybe 1 teaspoon of oil with these, and spray the baking sheet VERY well with cooking spray.  The leftovers also re-bake well.

The flavor of these fries was great. For personal preference I cut them into sticks and followed other reviewers' advice, baking them at 425. The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 is because they were quite oily so some of the fries were kind of soggy. Next time I'd cut back on the oil.

These were really good -- I had no complaints last night! I did add some sea salt and ground black pepper. I cut mine in  wedges and cooked them just a little longer than 45 mins (they were cooked through but still a bit soft and not yet crispy at 45). Everyone liked them. I definitely recommend.

Yum!  I made these fries 2x this week.  The 450 oven temp worked well for me (it really depends on how accurate your oven is).  I used 1 tbsp oil for and 1 tbsp grill seasoning and they came out great!  I flipped them halway through baking and even put them under the broiler for about 1 minute to get them extra crispy.  I can't imagine ever buying the frozen kind again!

These were really good and flavorful.  i didn't tell my teenager they were baked and not fried until after we ate.  I did blow it by not spraying the pan before banking. Sort of a "duh" kinda thing, but I guess I was thinking they wouldn't stick because of the olive oil.  We also all added salt to them at the table although I still won't add more salt when I cook them because salting to each person's own taste is easy enough to do at the table.  Really good, inexpensive and easy recipe.  A definite keeper.  Served with Philly cheesesteak sandwiches with garlic mayo from this site.  Outstanding meal.

These were delicious.  I think next time I will make a bit more of the olive oil/spice mixture though because I didn't have quite enough for all of the fries.  But they were VERY tasty!

Great flavor!  I changed the recipe to five servings and added 1/2 tsp. salt.  Then baked as directed.  They were perfect.  Maybe so many reviews state that the time/temp. is too much because they are not cutting them thick enough.  I cut them like thick steak fries.  Perfect.  Will definately make them again.  My family of six loved them (ages 2 - 40)!

Pretty good taste.  The cooking time or temperature needs to be adjusted.  I tried to adjust the temperature myself to 425 degrees after reading some of the other reviews.  They were done well before 45 mins.  Once again, pretty good taste and very easy to make.  Just adjust the temp and/or cooking time so that they don't burn!

This was an easy (though not very quick) snack.  I added some red potatoes to the mix, and I didn't realize they would crisp up quicker, so be warned.

This recipe is great!  I have made it several times for entertaining and it is the first thing gone! Great mix of spices. I had a bunch of different veggies left over in the frig ~ along with the potatoes I added sweet potatoes, zucchini sticks and red bell pepper sticks.  It was a HIT!!  I throw all of the spices, oil and the veggies in a large zip lock, shake and put them on a large baking stone!  To die for!! Thanks so much for a great, easy crowd pleasing munchie!! :)

These turned out great, but I made some changes.  I doubled the recipe and cut the potatoes into standard fries, not wedges, and left the skins on (nutritious and delicious!). I  used garlic salt instead of powder and they were the perfect level of saltiness for me.   I didn't have onion powder, but added 1 tsp each of cumin and dried tyme (for a doubled recipe) and it was great!  Also sprinkled with grated parmesan and fresh ground pepper just before baking.  The ziploc bag technique worked well, but I found I needed a bit more olive oil than what's listed to coat all the fries.  I baked at 400 for about 45min.  Will definitely make again!

Great alternative to regular fries. I tried making some with Pam cooking spray and they worked out ok, but they are better with the EVOO.

I tried this recipe when my parents had some friends over and we all loved it! The only problem was that the amount of sauce in the recipe wasnt nearly enough for the potatoes that I made. I had to like triple it. Also instead of using garlic powder i used garlic salt & it turned just fine. I will definitely make this recipe again.

These fries were awesome!!! My husband loved them :) However, I also made some adjustments: I added a little more spices than suggested (I love spices...mmmm) and I also cooked at 425 degrees for 35 minutes, turning once at 15 minutes. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside AND healthier than fried.

Hmmm..good texture for baked, but it was a surprise to find that it was so bland..and I mean, "bland". I used Hungarian paprika and a good quality chili powder. It had such a nice appearance, so I gave it 3 stars. I won't be using this receipe or tweaking it. I shall trudge on my quest for a decent baked french fry.

I was skeptical because I haven't found a healthy french fry recipe. They always come out burned and tasteless. I used garlic salt instead of onion powder and baked at 400 for 30 minutes (flipping fries halfway through. The results came out perfect for me. I will definitely make this again and again.

Based on the reviews I was excited to try this. I adjusted the recipe for 5 medium potatoes, I thought 2 1/2 tsp. of everything was going to be too much, but I tried it. Everyone ended up dumping salt on them because they were so bland. I came back to the recipe thinking it was my fault for using "powders" instead of salted spices, but thats what the recipe did call for! What a waste of spices!! Will not make again.

Hi everyone!  Just to give a few more ideas, use a baking stone to cook the fries on, that really crisps them up! :D I also agree with 425 for 25 minutes!

This recipe was awesome! My whole family loved it. The only things I changed was the temp from 450 to 400 and I ended up adding a little more olive oil. Instead of garlic powder I used garlic salt and I also added salt plus pepper. Very good will make again!

these were excellent!! The only problem I had was not putting non stick spray on my pan, and they stuck, but otherwise the taste was great!! I  made them with some buffalo style chicken strips!!

I have made these fries several times now and they are soooo good. I do reduce the temp and time like others suggested.  My kids love them and they always ask for the ranch dressing to dip them in. Thanks for the recipe.

A little too spicy for my kids, so the 2nd time I made them, I omitted the chili powder, and added rosemary leaves and sage powder...it was PERFECT!! I also threw in some slivered onions and sweet potatoes. Very tasty and delish!

This gets 5 stars, even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly--I only had yukon gold potatoes, cut into about 1/2 inch strips, omitted chili powder, used cayenne instead, shook all together in a ziplock.  Also, I didn't use any oil,just sprayed pretty heavily with Pam.  Baked like the others said at 400 and turned them after 15 min. (on convection oven setting)--perfect!! Served with sour cream with dried parsley flakes for dipping.  We loved these with our Friday night burgers!

These rocked! I peeled the potatoes, and then cut them into 1/4 inch thick sticks. I had the oven at 400 degrees, and flipped the french fries over at 15 minutes and cooked them for another 15 minutes. They were perfect, crunchy on the outside, and soft of the inside.

I learned the hard way that the timing of this recipe is way off... I think I will try it again with a lower temp and a lower time and would melt cheese over the top... then we'll see how good these potatoes are!!

I'll make these again, I was pleased with the flavor of all the spices.  I cut my potatoes pretty thin so they didn't take a full 45 minutes to cook.  I served these with the 'BBQ Pork for Sandwiches' recipe on this site, as well as some coleslaw.  Made for a VERY tasty meal!

Great, easy and fast!  I took the recommendation of lowering the temp to 400 and cooking for 30 minutes.  I turned once for even cooking - perfect!

Good and simple. I skipped out on the garlic powder and used minced garlic instead. Watch the fries, because mine started to burn with 8 minutes left on the clock so I took them out of the oven. They were cooked through, and nice and crispy on the outside. Three potatoes is probably enough for four people.

Great base recipe.  I mess around with the seasonings depending on what we are in the mood for and they are always really good.  Much better than frozen fries.  Thanks for this easy, healthy version of a great side!

Made last night and they were not bad.  I did have to add more salt but very easy to make and will make again.  I probably will double up on the spices next time.  I also had to lower the temperature down because they started to burn and mine were done in half the cooking time.  Thanks

really good--I used a little too much oil, so mine weren't as crunchy. I baked at 425, 15 mins on each side, then sprinkled cheese on top and broiled for a few mins. I didn't use paprika or chili powder, but will try adding them next time. Also, as suggested by other reviewers, I put oil & spices in ziplock and then added wedges and shook 'em up before arranging on cookie sheet sprayed with Pam.

I loved the base of this recipe but not the flavor. Next time I would use some salt, maybe parmesan cheese, garlic powder, etc. Very easy to do and adapt to your own taste. I baked at 425 for 15 minutes, flipped and another 15 minutes, using baking potatoes.

Oh so good!  I used spray on the cooking sheet and then moved them around halfway through to prevent sticking.  Will try with more onion and garlic powder, but my husband raved about them.  Great recipe!

Surprisingly good! I cut the potatoes like french fries instead of wedges. Using aluminum foil cuts down on clean up, but the poatoes still stuck a little. Oh, and i used garlic salt instead of powder, and onion salt instead of powder. Great potatoes!!

My whole family loved these "fries." Nice and easy to make. I didn't bother peeling, just cleaned, cut and shook in a bag with seasonings. I used a foil lined pan for easy clean up and flipped after about 25 min. They were perfect. I didn't have any onion powder but can't imagine that they could be better so who cares!

Too much oil for the amount of potatoes & temperature.  Next time, I'll spray with a Canola Oil Non-Stick Spray (like Pam).  The fries were not crisp.  I baked them on a Silpat mat and turned them over to brown evenly.  The side on the mat browned better than the exposed side.  Great starter recipe & excellent concept!!!

These were fantastic! I wont be buying frozen fries any more! I used 2 potatoes, the olive oil and paprika, some minced garlic as well as some cayenne pepper, black pepper and some dried pasta herbs that I had (no chilli or onion powder on hand). I also added about 1 teaspoon of dijon mustard and a teaspoon of chilli sauce to the mix and cut back the oil a tiny bit, put the whole lot in a small plastic bag with the potato and shook it around then poured onto an oven tray. I cooked it on about 195 degrees C for about 40 mins then turned it up to 220 C for the last little bit (Turning them half way) Absolutely YUM, thanks!

These potatoes were really good and simple to make. I probably will throw a little more different seasonings(old bay)in next time, but the overall taste was good. Since you're not frying them atop a stove, you really taste the flavor of the potatoe and seasonings without all the oil. And, using golden potatoes (Yukon Gold) makes them even better. I will start making these kind of potatoes instead of frying them in a pan of oil gettin' my arteries clogged!

This was a pretty good side dish. The fries ended up being more bland than i thought.  I would add more salt and more spices.  Also, it is easiest to coat the potatoes Shake & Bake style (in the baggie).

Great recipe.  We use garlic salt and dried onion and it still tastes great. One of our guests asked for more but they were all gone.

These were excellent!  My 2 year old picky eater loved them, as well as my fiancee who usually turns fries down.  The only thing I did different was instead of chili powder (we didn't have any), I used garlic salt, and put cooking spray on the bottom of the baking sheet.  

From past reviews I was nervous of the cooking time and took them out 15 minutes early.  My fiance and I decided next time thats a no-no!  We want them crispy!!  I will just continue to flip them and use the exact recipe next time.  

Thanks for sharing!  This is going in our recipe box!

These were good but there is something off about the baking time or temperature. I only had them in the oven at 450 for 24 min before they started to char. My husband really liked them though, so I'll try them again. I did follow others suggestions and put everthing in plastic bag to coat. Also sprinkled with salt after they came out of the oven.

A keeper for sure.  Just make sure you lower the oven temp to 400 and maybe check after 30 minutes.  It really depends on how thin you make the wedges.  Watch out...they burn easily.

These a delicous.  I wedge the potatoes and put them in a tupperware with a tight fitting lid.  I add the spices as well as the oil to the top and then shake the container.  They turn out so crispy and delicous.  Thanks for sharing.

Changes to recipe: Doubled the recipe. Omitted the onion powder and substituted 1/2 tsp. Lawry's seasoning salt.  Used the ziploc bag method to coat fries with seasoning as another user suggested.  I also used sesame oil and turned the temp down to 400 for the last 10 min. of baking...

These fries turned out wonderful.  I like mine a little softer, but with plenty of seasoning and with the minor changes, this did the trick!  Will no longer buy frozen - these are better and take only 5 min of prep work.

Mmmmmmmmmmm, delicious! I used garlic salt and onion powder as well as chilli powder and paprika. They tasted soooo good - much better than potato wedges I've had at restaurants. We had them with some Ranch dressing as a dip. Thanks, Ashlee!

MY FAMILY LOVED THIS RECIPE.  I SPRAYED THE PAN WITH PAM, TURNED THE FRIES EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES AND SALTED THEM AS SOON AS COMPLETED.  TO INSURE COMPLETE COVERAGE, I MIXED THE POTATO AND INCREDIENTS IN A ZIPLOCK BAG. MY FAMILY INSISTED THAT I MAKE THE FRIES AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT.

I've made these several times and they are always polished off quickly.  Next time, however, I will followed another reviewers tip on reducing or eliminating the chili powder (which can give it kind of a bitter taste) and adding garlic salt.

Delicious.  I was amused by the reviews by people who thought the fries were too spicey, because I thought they were flavorful without being overpowering.  I think that plain pototos with salt/pepper would be too bland.  Thank you for this recipe!  The only mistake I made was assuming my nonstick calphalon baking sheet, combined with the oil coating, would keep the fries from sticking -- some of the crispy yummy outsides were left on the pan, even though I tried to toss them frequently as many suggested.  Next time, I'll PAM my cookie sheet.  Overall, fantastic.  Thank you!

I used vegetable oil and added salt.  I just added the seasonings without measuring and I used more than one potato-about three. It was good.  I found that it did need the full time and temperature called for.  It probably depends on the cut.

Ok, it was 10:30 at night here and I was craving french fries.  However, I was feeling too guilty to go out and eat a greasy order of fries from the local fast food place right before bed.  So, I found this recipe and decided to give it a try since I had a 10lb bag of potatoes lying around.  They were great!!!  I only used salt and pepper and I cut them into sticks like normal fries.  I would recommend flipping/moving the fries around every 10 minutes or so to prevent them from sticking.  After about 30 minutes of cooking they were done.  Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  Yummy!   I ate them all and don't feel sick from eating anything greasy.  Thanks for sharing this great healthy alternative to fried french fries Ashlee!

These taters were only ok. I did find them soggy (and I had reduced the oil) and too much of a mish/mash of spices. My hubby said he didn't mind them soggy - not for me though. I doubt I will make them again.

These are wonderful; you don't miss the oil at all under the spices.  I've added nutritional yeast to these for vitamins and cheezy flavor, and it works very well.

I didn't enjoy these. The chili powder was a little much I think, and they definitely needed salt. My husband is a french fry nut, and he didn't even like them that much. They were edible, but I won't make them again.

These weren't bad, but they weren't worth telling all my friends about either.  In my opion they should be cut thinner or cooked longer.  They were just too soggy for my liking.  However, the seasoning mix did taste pretty good.

I loved these.  These were the first fries I've ever made.  It was very easy.  Served them with sloppy joes and varied the seasoning a bit to suit my husband who likes milder flavors.  I thought they were very good dipped in ranch dressing.

Very good, very easy. You won't feel "cheated" because they weren't fried...easier to clean up as well! I did add a bit more garlic to the mixture and a pinch of salt.

My husband and I love these fries!  It's a great alternative to frying.  Definately cut the cooking time to about 30 min or you're fries will burn.

Very good & healthy version of fries. A little too much chili powder - I will decrease it next time, and cook for slightly less time. Another good seasoning mixture is grated Parmesan, garlic salt and Italian seasoning.

This is a great recipe! It has become a regular side dish in our home. Kind of reminds us of the KFC's potatoe wedges.

These fries came out terrific!  A little spicy, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  I will add this recipe permanently to my repertoire!

These fries are tasty. I added a tsp or so of worchester sauce and a bit of cayenne pepper for extra zing.

This was great, pretty easy, and I had everything on hand.  I made a few tweaks based on other reviews... I used minced garlic, and added salt (could have added more).  I made a ton... used 7 med russets, and so I used around 1/3 cup oil, and 1 2/3 tsp of each ingredient (other reviews mentioned upping the seasonings and I upped the portions anyhow)...and I mixed everything in a ziplock freezer bag.  I followed other suggestions to bake at 400 for 15, turn, and another 15 minutes.  I think my wedges were on the thicker side, I could have used a higher temp and longer time to get them crispier on the outside... but they’re great - great base recipe that could be tweaked with adding more garlic and Parmesan or cutting the potatoes thinner to fit whatever you making with it!  Will definitely do this again!

Followed the recipe and these wedges turned out beautiful, slightly crunchy, and delicious. The wedges I cut were thick. I feel that if you cut the slices thin like regular French fries they will definitely burn. I also baked these on the lowest rack of the oven.

Used 3 smaller potatoes and doubled the spices and oil to accommodate the extra potatoes as well as adjusted the cooking temp and time. They came out crispy but couldn’t taste the spices on them. Had to sprinkle them over the finished product. Will make again though next time maybe coat them in oil then put the seasonings on after they are in the pan. Overall super easy recipe. Perfect for after work. Thanks for the recipe ??

I am only gave it 4 because I agree with many others that 400 would be a better temperature and I was at about 30 minutes. I realize that different sizes of potatoes sliced differently cook differently so you really have to take that into account. The spice mix was good. I enjoyed them as did my other half.

Following this recipe almost made my apartment burn down. Temperature is too high and baking time was too long for one potato. 350 degrees and 20 minutes is more pleasing to my smoke detector. Also the seasoning was insufficient.

I used salt and pepper and cayenne and garlic powder. 
We roasted them on a rack and cut even sized slices to ensure proper cooking. We roasted at 425 Fahrenheit. Keep in mind 450 will most likely burn the fries, depending on how small you cut them . 4 stars because i changed the recipe slightly.

The seasoning is tasty.   the cook time/temp made my wedges burn to crispy, almost inedible fries.  I recommend the cook time be reduced by 10 minutes, at least.

I went on line to find the temperature to bake my fries at and came across this recipe. I had already planned to spice it up with the suggested spices but added cayenne pepper...LOTS of cayenne pepper (I'm a "heat-aholic!). I used 6 small - medium Russet potatoes and cut them in a 1/4 inch french fry; skins on. I used a generous amount of Canola Oil and put all my spices, oil and potatoes right on the baking sheet and mixed there. I divided the potatoes in 2 batches so they would all lay in a single layer. the first batch came out perfect at 450 degrees and 45 minutes cooking time (large batch approximately 3 small to medium potatoes). Second batch, a smaller batch, I did not add extra oil but added extra spices; cooked them for 40 minutes and they nearly burned. Keep in mind I like my fries on the well-done side and the first batch had many small edges of potato/skin pieces that were crunchy little morsels of goodness.

Lessons learned: Temperature is fine. Less potatoes, less baking time and I think more oil is better.

I hope this helps people who felt the times and temps were wrong. You have to experiment.

Simple and easy to make! We've made it three times now and like the seasoning for the fries. The first attempt was made as written--bake temp is too high and time to cook is too long. Keep an eye on them to avoid burning, which happens very fast! I'd decrease the amount of oil used, which we did the second time around. These came out much better on convection @ 400F (just hit convection bake and punch in 425; our oven auto-decreases the temp by 25 degrees for convection). They were done at approx. 20-30 min. (I sliced mine thinner instead of having them thick). The last time we made them, I did the above with decreasing olive oil a little and convection baking, but also put them on a rack on the sheet pan and flipped them after 10-15 minutes. Some were still a little soft, but they turned out fine and no complaints. Rating of 3 stars only because we had to play with these a bit to get them right. Otherwise, it is a good recipe! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These turned out great.  Slightly crispy on the outside and just the right consistency on the inside.  I also added a bit of garlic powder and onion powder.  Delicious!

I used the exact amount of seasoning for 2 lbs- I think one potato would have been overly seasoned.

If I could rate this less than a star I could. My fries ended up burning and nearly burnt my house down. 45 minutes is far too long to bake fries like that.

I think the heat is too high. I should have used about 350. I had to only keep it in for about 30 minutes because I noticed them really burning. I used way more than a spoon of oil. I covered them completely with oil and half way through, I flipped them and covered them again. They were good, but definitely burned.

These were quite good. However, it took only 25 minutes for the potatoes to fully cooked .
I suspect the time required may vary depending on the type of potato used.

These are really bad directions! Preheated oven to 450, coated the fries in oil, put them in the oven, and they were burnt after 22 minutes, not even halfway through.

Since  so many of the reviews are saying the directions are too hot for too long, CAN SOMEONE PLEASE JUST UPDATE THE RECIPE? As written, this is an example of the blind leading the blind into a pit. How can all the other reviewers give the recipe a good rating when they know the recipe if followed will burn the food to a crisp?!? All my time preparing this was wasted. (Yeah, Google Home didn’t read me the reviews before it gave me the recipe.)

Here’s a picture of the fries after 22 minutes of cooking. Totally inedible.

I made this baked French Fries potato dish tonight and used Chipotle Chili powder,  along with Chipotle flavored olive oil. My wife loved it. I also added minced onions rather than the onion powder. We both ate every fry! I only had small  golden potatoes, but they were fine. This will definitely be used again and again. Can't wait to try sweet potatoeswith the recipe. A very easy dish to prepare.

Make sure to turn down the temp and time to avoid burnt fries. I also recommend adding some salt to enhance the flavor. Good recipe  though, will make again using these changes.

Going by the directions the fries got a little over cooked, cooking time needed to be reduced to 30 minutes.  Flavoring was very good and would not change anything on that part.

Temp was way too high.  I cooked for 35 minutes and checked them after flipping halfway through.  Good thing cause at 45 minutes they would have been charred black.  I would cook next time at 425 and pull to check at 35 minutes.  The flavor was really good though!

Awesome baked fries!  I would cut the cooking time though.  45 minutes has been too long both times I made these.  Next time I'll start checking them at 35 minutes so I can remove them from the oven before they overcook.

I don't understand why, but my oven started smoking and then flames appeared. Then I read online that you should never use olive oil to cook fries on high heat because the oil's burn point is very low. Did anyone else have this problem? We ended up having to turn off the oven, open all the doors, and switch everything over to the frying pan. :/ I'll be using ghee next time.

Did exactly what the recipe said and the fries burned. I checked some of the reviews afterward and many people mentioned that you shouldn't follow the recipe's directions because if you do the fries will burn.  Waste of potatoes.

I didn't read the recommendation to lower the temp a bit, but really didn't see an issue. They were crispy, but I like fries that way. I didn't have onion powder or paprika, but I did add salt, pepper and a little cayenne pepper for some kick. Good solid side dish and something I will do again, but not  anything really special.

Sure enough, like the comments said, following this original recipe burned my fries.  I later put them on at 400 degrees F, with only about 30 minutes, not even, and I did flip them.  

I was originally excited about this recipe because of all the many ratings being positive, but I see that's only because they modified theirs.  I found these fries to have very little seasoning and most of them ended up burnt.   Also, very little flavor, add some  salt!

Since I made a big batch, I was left with some that were eatable, but not plain, so we made them into nacho fries, piled with other tasty things.  

Good luck!

delish!!!!   I used fajita seasoning instead of chili powder but otherwise followed the recipe.  Make sure to turn them halfway through the cooking time.  Temp and time was perfection!!  Golden brown and fabulous!!!

These fries turned out pretty good. I added salt and ground black pepper. I baked them at 425 degrees for approximately 40 minutes. These are a good option if you want to avoid frying and don’t care for frozen varieties. However, they take a little longer to make.

My fries were done in 35 minutes. I took them to a dinner and got great reviews. To make them young kid-friendly, pull back on or eliminate the chili powder.

Easy to make, comes out like they were fried, but not oily/greasy.  I don't have a deep fryer so this recipe is a keeper for me.

I made these tonight and they were AMAZING! I too lowered the temperature to 400 and baked them for 35-40 minutes , turning them at the 20 minute mark. I did not have chili powder, but I had the next best thing .......SIRACHA !!!!!! I drizzled a lot on top and mixed them up before baking , for some reason it made them even taste cheesy but I wasn’t complaining , everyone loved them even my dad who is super picky about spicy things !!

Would have been a 4* review if it were a recipe for charcoal. How is this 5* if the default temperatures are completely off?

My husband loves these fries.  I cut them thin, and bake them at 400 for 30 minutes turning halfway through the cooking time.  They are crisp on the outside & soft on the inside.

This is now my go-to fries recipe. The first time I made them, I followed the advice of numerous posters who said to cut both the time and oven temperature; however, I thought they’d never get crispy and nearly tossed the recipe. Decided to try it once as originally written and they came out perfect! Go figure. I suspect we all just have to learn the vagaries of our ovens. The seasoning was delicious, and I added a bit of Spicy Montreal Steak Seasoning to the mix for a little extra zing. Didn’t add the salt several suggested as I consider salt mostly a table spice since too many people add it before they even taste the food! Great way to have steak fries without the deep frying.

Wonderful! I did change the cooking temp to 400 for 40-45 and added 1/2 teaspoon of salt as other reviewers suggested and they came out perfect.

NOTE TO THE SUBMITTER: PLEASE CHANGE THE BAKING TIME!!!
I have learned a valuable lesson.  Read the helpful reviews before trying a recipe for the first time.  I followed the recipe as written and after 25 minutes decided to check things.  I opened my oven and it looked like the potato wedges were charred.  I turned off the oven and tried to save them.  They tasted horrible. and I had to throw them in the trash. Unfortunately, my dinner was ruined.

This was a great spice blend. I was super short on time so I actually just mixed the spices in a large zip lock bag with plain store bought crinkle frozen french fries. they turned out amazing! no more buying "seasoned" fries for me! thank you!

Seasoning was not so good for hubby and I.  Cooking method is great though.  We'll give it another shot with our own seasoning.

Super yummy! Listen to the commenters and bake at a lower temperature. I baked them at 375 because that's the temperature my chicken was cooking at. I cooked them for about 41 minutes, flipping halfway through. They were delicious! They were crispy and had a great texture. I might add some salt and pepper to the bag of seasonings next time, but overall I loved it! I will definitely make them again!

Fantastic. Easy and quick. I added some powdered Italian dressing to the bag before I tossed the fries. The sugar makes all the difference in the crunchy texture.  I'm so glad I tried this recipe and will recommend it to friends.

I made the recipe with the exact ingredients, but I cooked it at a lower temperature than in the recipe, the potatoes burn at 450, so I cook them at 400 and they turn out perfect.

I thought they were good.  My husband thought I baked too long, and it wasn't as long as suggested.  For me there was too much oil, next time I will reduce it a bit.

My husband and I both loved these! I doubled this recipe because my husband is a fanatic for fries. The only change I made was that I didn't double the chili powder, only because I don't particularly like it. They were absolutely perfect!! Thanks for sharing!!

I took them out before the suggested 45 minutes.  I baked mine  about 40 min.  They came out pretty well compared to other times I have made homemade fries & wedges in the oven.  They were slightly rubbery and a couple had burnt edges.  They don't taste like deep fried potatoes, but decent.  I didn't add onion powder because I was out and chose to leave the chili powder out.  I would make these again and play around with the cooking time and spices.

This recipe was so easy and soooo delicious!  I used both a regular baked potato and a sweet potato.  Came out so good.  This is one to save!!!

Really good - don't feel guilty eating these at all - though I changed the spices a tad to accommodate my family's taste - I omitted the chili powder and added salt and pepper. They loved them and this will be a new go-to for fries. :)

*I noticed that some had a problem with temp/time for
 baking in the oven - I had no problems with this - most were perfectly crispy with a couple of the smaller ones on the toastier side, so note that temp/times may vary due to different ovens.

Pretty good recipe though I definitely followed what others said about cooking at 400° for 40-45 mins & spiced up the spices used :-)

It was delicious, although I applied 400 degree baking temperature instead of 450. Also turned the fries half way through.  Used more than 1 potatoes (3-4 potatoes) with the same amount of seasonings, turned out very good.  Will not buy frozen stuff anymore!

I made these for my parents, who loved them, however I kept checking them while they were cooking (which I highly suggest you do) since they were done within 10 to 20 minutes. However it's a great recipe still which is why I'm giving it 5 stars! :3

Like the others say, try it at 400, this seemed to work quite well, however you will need to adjust cook time depending on the cut of the fries.  I also used fresh garlic and added salt.

450 for 45 minutes is way too much. Also, there was no salt in the recipe so I didn't enjoy the flavor.

This was a big hit with the little ones (and big ones). As others noted, it does need some tweaks. Bake at 400 or 425 for 45+ minutes rather than 450 which will burn it before the inside is done. I also added salt and pepper (crucial for potatoes), and used crushed garlic rather than garlic powder.

Crisp and tasty but only needed to bake for 30 minutes at 450. Any more time in the oven and they would be way too crisp to eat and probably burnt.  I suggest setting your timer for 30 minutes and check on the "fries" at about 20 minutes to see if they are done all the way through, browned, and crispy. Note:  I did not use aluminum foil - Reynolds  Parchment paper or baking sheets work wonderful with this recipe.

I think the recipe might call for thicker wedges, I cut them more thinly. Regardless 40 minutes will do.

I'm never buying frozen fries again! They were amazing. I used 4 medium-large potatoes (not sure what the name is) for my boyfriend and I, I could have even used an extra one. I added cayenne pepper, cumin and extra olive oil since the recipe is only meant for 1 potato. Definitely making these again

Followed BandE's suggestion to bake at 400 for about 40 minutes and flipped halfway through, but instead of using the amount of oil it called for just sprayed them with oil until lightly coated.  Came out great, and without all the oil only wound up being 150 calories!

This needs a lot more salt. Mine charred, burned and crispy. This is not all that bad if you like your fries that way. My husband really liked them. Usually my fries stick to the pan really bad and fall apart. This is the first time I mixed the seasonings with the oil and cut the fries into bigger wedges and they didn't stick!

The coating burns in the oven and the ends were hard.  Maybe I cooked them too long.

Made as stated except I baked at 400.  I flipped halfway through.  The flavor was goo, but not the best.  Worth trying again.  I cut my pieces rather small so they baked faster...... done in 30

I left out the onion powder since I had none, and these tasted amazing. The cooking time obviously depends on the size of the wedges, and I guess mine were thin because it only took about 20 minutes!

Really good, I wish I would have cooked more.  I baked them at 400 degrees based on the advise of others.  My hubby said them were like Five Guys Cajun fries.  This is great, because he should not be eating Five Guys fries.

450 F and 45 minutes is way too hot and too long.  Burned the fries black because we wasn't watching them.  Won't do this recipe again.

These were very yummy. I adjusted the cook time/temp as suggested by other posts. If you are making these for kids cut back on the spices & just use salt & maybe a little old bay. Too many flavors for my 9 year old.

Not sure how these would have tasted as I burnt the  out of them.. I  followed the time/temp (knowing that I should have checked them periodically). But  my excuse for not doing so (as lame as it is): I work from home in the evenings, so I often don't get up every few minutes to look. Needless to say, I am bummed but I will give it another shot later and make the needed adjustments. Wish I had read some of these reviews beforehand!

Awesome and simple side dish. My variations were: add some salt, cook for 30 minutes at 400 degrees and turn them at halftime. I cut them in wedges just as the video suggests.

I have made these 2 times now. The first as written and they are good.   The second I made them thinner and I like them better that way. Next time I'm going to make them in rounds and see how that goes. I also just spray with olive oil and sprinkle with seasoning so they all get some and aren't over coated.

These were fabulous. I made them exactly as the recipe suggested, and served with a steak and cheese recipe from all recipes dot com. They were a huge hit. I just learned that, making a big batch for a party of ten, I needed to baked them on several shifts to be sure they were done well. Just the best - I'll use this recipe a lot, it was not greasy and was super tasty!

I cut mine thin, so they burned at 450 degrees after 30 mins! They were toast! I read the reviews after the fact. Also, the spice proportions are way off. I would say coat the cut up potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle some spices! Then season to taste AFTER cooking.

The olive oil/seasoning combo is a thick paste that's WAY too hard to spread, and they came out burnt. 
My advice? 
1. Turn the  heat down. 400 or 425. 
2. Turn the fries partway through baking to avoid burnt bottoms. 
3. Coat the potatoes with oil THEN toss in seasoning. This will make for a MUCH better and more even coating. 
4. Do not bake for 45 minutes without checking on them.

I added a few more seasonings, like a pinch of cayenne and some black pepper. I also took the advice of others and changed the cook time and temperature. 

They turned out great! My husband begs for these at least once a week now. They've become a family favorite.

Definitely followed other reviewers tips and baked at 400 for 30 min (flipping over halfway through), instead of 450 and for 45 and they came out perfect! As is, seasoning is good, but I felt it just needed a little something extra: I added a sprinkling of garlic salt afterward, which I found was the flavor that was missing, and really made these fries POP! Overall, good recipe :)

They were powdery and almost tasteless beyond the taste of powder.  Maybe I had bad spices, but will look for another recipe next time.  Maybe a little salt and pepper would help or instead.

There was no flavor, other than a slight spicy aftertaste (I assume from the chili powder) it just tasted like a potato.

Made these twice already, first time cooked to high with the current directions. Lower the oven temperature or shorten the time about 15 minutes and they are delicious!

I just made these and I will NEVER buy another bag of frozen fries again.  They were truly delicious.   I have had deep fried home fries and you can't tell the difference.   So much easier to bake without that messy oil from deep frying.   I put my potatoes in a freezer bag, mixed the oil and spices together and then shake until coated and then put on the baking sheet.

This is a very inexpensive, easy, healthier, and delicious way to make fries. I recommend baking at 400 degrees and cook for 20 mins then turn fries over and cook another 20 mins. Put any seasoning you want on, don't just limit yourself to seasonings in recipe. If you bake them on foil, spray the foil with non sticking spray due to mine sticking when I took them out to turn them over. I also didn't peel my potatoes and used about 3 medium sized potatoes for I and my boyfriend. Trust me this is easy and you can say you made your own fries from scratch!

Loved the seasonings, but my wedges burned at 450 degrees for 45 minutes! I'm going to try this recipe again, and hopefully be able to give it more stars!

Just follow the other recommendations (on time and heat) and spray the pan. I thought the oil would keep the fries from sticking but that wasn't the case for me.

This is now my go-to recipe for french fries.  Made them several times before realizing that they don't even have (or require) any salt.  The much-disputed oven temperature and time worked fine for me, and I think it might be because I cut my fries pretty big and leave the skins on.  I might sometimes take them out after 35 or 40 minutes.  Nice and crisp on the outside and soft inside.  Delicious!

I prepared this recipe as instructed, but when I took the fries out of the oven to turn them halfway through (at 20 minutes, even though not part of recipe), I found that many of the edges were burnt and decided to eat them at that point. Many were so hard and crunchy I could barely bite them. I wish I had read the comments first. I agree the temp is too hot and the time is too long. The flavor was fine though.

I am just a begginer cook and I put way too much trust in recipes.  I followed this recipe as written and the potatoes burned to a crisp.  I'm so disappointed. I even turned down the oven to 400 when there was 17 minutes left but they still burned.

The fries were tasty. I love french fries and always looking for a healthy alternative. I will say that I set the timer on my oven for 40 minutes and they almost burned. When making them again I will cook them for 30 - 35 minutes.

I took other reviewers suggestion and baked at 200C/400F, and kept an eye on them- took about 40 min in my fan assisted oven. Soaked wedges in salt water before mixing spices in. Good stuff, will definitely make again!

Sorry about the three stars but I burned the living daylights out of the potatoes in about 15 minutes! Thank goodness I noticed and salvaged whatever I could. When I read the recipe I thought 450 degrees was too high and should have listened to my gut. Should have read the other reviews before I attempted this. The ones I did get to eat were delish, seasonings are good but use coconut oil! That gives them a sweet delicious flavor!

I went to flip these half-way, at 22 minutes.  They tasted good, but I figured there was no way they were done in so short a time.  I put them back in, and 10 minutes later decided my own logic was stupid.  At that point, they had started to burn.  These are NOT good burnt.  All of the spicing gets really dusty and thick.  I'd happily try them again, as that quick taste I did at 22 minutes in was fine.  Even then, though, not as good as just potatoes with rosemary.

First of all, the cooking time depends on how thin or thick you cut your taters, so keep an eye on them after 30 min; I also baked at 400ºF instead of 450ºF. You definitely need to add salt to the seasoning as well, but overall a yummy recipe for a yummy side!

I did everything as the directions say.  Oven at 425 and bake for 45 minutes.  Good thing I checked these 10 minutes early, because they were already burned in spots.  They didn't taste that great because of the burnt areas.  I'll make it again, but this time I'll lower the heat and the baking time.  Thanks for sharing.  I'm looking forward to trying again...

The All-Star Winning Award potato wedges!! Absolutely loved this...amazing! I increased the recipe 4 times and I also added 2 more potatoes to equal 6. And I'm glad I did cuz it goes away very fast. I followed other suggestions and tips. But I think next I will bake @ 425° instead of 400° cuz it took longer to bake. I didn't have to flip it 1/2 way though. And another thing is that I will put less salt next time

Great baked fries. Used ancho chili powder and 1/4 tsp onion salt rather than onion powder. Took 30 minutes without flipping over.

Let me start by saying, I have no problem serving these wedges to any guest or relative.I have containers that are blends of spices but they mostly include only the listed spices here. 
One problem that I often have is the potatoes not cooking evenly so here are my recommendations:
Cut large potatoes potatoes in eighths and boil for 7-10 minutes before mixing with spices.add a pinch of salt and black pepper.
Bake at 400 degrees.
Bake with a dish half way filled with water to avoid burned wedges .this will result in soft wedges. Take water dish out outshot way in to give it a softer crisp.

Followed the recommendation from another reviewer and lowered the temp to 400. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Yum!

After reading reviews I had my doubts.  I watched the video.  People should watch videos they have provided for recipes in case you miss something.  Lots of tips were explained on the video.  For instance, watch them carefully and often to ensure they don't burn and turn them once or twice halfway.  A lot is depending how you cut them also.  It calls for baking potatoes which are huge.  I didnt have those but close to it.  So smaller potatoes aren't going to take as long and you will have to adjust the time accordingly.  I also peeled mine first.  I didn't have paprika and left it out but added salt and pepper.  I didnt measure the spices either.  I just sprinkled them on the top along with olive oil and stirred them.  Also, it helps to spray your aluminum foil before baking and I use olive oil spray too.  Oven on 450 and after 20 minutes I turned them.  Put them in for another 20 minutes and were perfect.  Next time I will set them on broil for a couple minutes before pulling them out.  They had the perfect seasoning.  Not spicy and not bland.  If they are bland you didnt use enough.  Very pleased and this is a keeper and healthier than fried!

These are really great especially if you cut them a bit thinner so they crisp up well. My two year old daughter gobbled them up!

Made these exactly as the recipe said. The temperature and time was way off. The taste would have been better if they were not overcooked. Next time I make these I will adjust the temperature & time.

These were pretty good - I followed other's suggestions and only cooked at 400 so they would not burn.  Make sure you watch them as all ovens are a little different.  I may change the spicing next time to try something different.

I added a 1/2 tsp of Cayenne to the mix. Nicely spicy!! Additionally, I used a mandolin and cut them into traditional fry shape. Make sure you spread them out over a large sheet as, while mine were cooked fine, they were not crispy in the least, despite my cooking them at 450 for 30 minutes (coincided with cooking some Van de Kamps beer battered fish!!).

I did not care for this. The oil and spice mixture came out sort of like a paste and was difficult to mix on all the potatoes in a zip lock bag. I did decrease the temp to 400 and baked for 45 minutes. the spices turned black and they were sort of burnt, I even turned them after 20 minutes. They tasted burnt too. I will not make these again. Thanks for sharing though.

These were delicious, however the time to cook was not near the full 45 mins this says to cook them and I did not add as much of the "hot" spices as this called for.  But the family loved them!

I love these, the flavors are wonderful and the ease of prep works for me. I mada them the 1st time for dinner, since then I have made for my lunch on weekends a couple time. The only thing I changed is I use coconut oil instead of olive oil. A keeper!

I thought this was an awesome recipe!  I have a picky teenager who only eats potatoes in french fry form.  So, tired of not knowing what sides to make, I had a potato in the fridge.  I found this recipe and tried it and it was a total hit!!!  He asked for them again tonight and I feel they are much healthier than frying (not to mention less mess)!  I did adjust to everyone's review and set temp to 400 degrees, but I ended up leaving them in longer as he likes them crispier.  Thanks for sharing Ashlee!

I didn't have any onion powder on hand, but by doubling the garlic powder they still turned out well. The other comments are right though. I did 450 degrees for the first 20 minutes and then dropped it down to 375 degrees after turning them and left them in for another 10 to 15 minutes. I ate them with some ketchup and enjoyed them a lot.

The seasoning on these fries are delicious and I loved the fact that you didn't have to peal the potatoes. I left the fries in the oven for the amount of time that the recipe stated, but they were a little overcooked for my liking. Next time, I'm going to take them out about 5-10 minutes before the recipe tells you to. It was my fault for not watching them carefully enough.

5 stars for easy and tasty. I used the ziplock and eyeball spices method. Baked at 450 and watched them (as with ALL baking its never a good idea to just leave it and walk away, prevent burning by watching for desired "doneness") took 30 min middle rack turning halfway for me :) Thanks for sharing!!

Family loved them!! We didn't make wedges though, just did normal "fries". Stuck them under the broiler to crisp up at the end.

Wow, these are good!  I mixed the oil and seasonings (plus cumin and black pepper) with the fries in a bag.  I cut the potatoes thin.  After putting them on the pan, I ground sea salt on them.  Then, I cooked on 425 degrees on a foil wrapped pan for 30 minutes, turning them half way through.  We are addicted to them!  They turned out crispy and delicious!  We will make these alot now!  I have heard that wedge potatoes are easy to cut with an apple corer.  I might try that next time if I want to go with a larger french fry.

I did as the other readers suggested and baked these at 400. I don't know if I cut them too thin, apparently I did, because most of them burnt to a crisp. I only did the salt and pepper as seasoning and added seasoned salt afterwards; I think I will try other seasonings and cut my wedges much thicker next time. cut your potato wedges on the thicker side, because they WILL burn if they are thin.

These are family favorites.  I pre-mix multiplied quantities of the seasonings, so all I have to do is put a couple Tbsp of olive oil in a ziplock, sprinkle in a good spoonful of the mix,  add the potatoes and toss them around.

Great recipe. I didn't have any of the seasonings separate but I had some monteray chicken seasoning which had the garlic, onion and other spices, so I just shook that over the fries until they were well coated. Then some salt and pepper. I like my fries very seasoned, but don't be afraid to over season because the spices can lose potency when baking. My fries were somewhat thin so I baked them at 415 degrees for about 30 minutes, turning them at the 15 minute mark so they wouldn't burn. So yummy!

Excellent!!  1st time making "baked" fries and wasn't too hopeful...but this recipe is wonderful.  Will never deep-fry again.  Flavors are fantastic & turned out crispy on outside & soft in middle.  I did follow others advice though & baked @ 400 degrees for about 35 min (turning 1/2 way).  Turned out perfect!  Thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper!!!

Found these to be a little over-seasoned. We doubled the recipe straight, which might've been the problem. Followed the advice of one commenter to lower the temp to 400 to avoid burning. Glad we did!

Just pulled these out of the oven about half hour ago and they're already gone! Hubster loved them, and he hates potatoes! (Personally, I could eat potatoes every day, lol) I did read some previous reviews and heated oven to 400 instead of 450 and only cooked 30 minutes, as well as flipping the potatoes halfway through. These potatoes are in DIRE need of salt! Lol. Adding salt to these definitely brought out more of the flavor of the spices. 5 stars because these are pretty darn awesome. ;]

Need to add a little salt.  This is a good base mix.  You can add what you want and take away what you dont.  Hubby and I both enjoyed these.  I also used it on some cut up chicken before I fried them.  I did add a little cayenne--otherwise made it exactly like this recipe.  It was good!

They would get five stars, but the cooking time is off. I baked them for 25 min. and they came out perfectly done. However, mine were not the really super crispy type, so if you like that type better, then go ahead and bake them for 40-45 minutes.

I've never tried these but I guess I just have a suggestion... For crispier fries try coating them in veg. oil instead of olive oil, I guess its more fattening but thats how I make my fries in the oven with garlic salt and parmesan cheese and there crunchy and super yummy! :)

Good flavor.  They definitely need more oil and need to be watched closely.  I turned mine at 20 minutes and lowered the temp to 400.  After 30 minutes of baking most were overcooked.  I will try them again but will watch them more closely.

The spice mixture in this recipe is wonderful.  However, DO NOT bake them for 45 min at 450 degrees.  You will burn them like I did!  Lower the temp to 400 and check/turn them after 20-30 min.

This was good. The only reason it got four instead of five stars is a) yes, it needed more salt, and b) the fries weren't crispy, which is what I was expecting. Still tasty, though.

I sliced them very thick, I got 6 sticks from each potatoe (they weren't the biggest potatoes) and it still only took 30 mins to bake and I had to flip them half way through.  Other than that, they were great.  My 11 month old daughter loved them, too!

I am giving this recipe three stars because the spices tasted great on the fries, but the cooking time and the amount of spices you use are way off. First, I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. Second, I omitted the paprika (husband hates it). Third, I actually baked the fries on 350 degrees for about an hour (no burnt or hard fries came out). Fourth, before the fries were almost done, I tasted them and couldn't taste any of the spices, so about 10 minutes before I took them out, I added the exact same amount of spices that the recipe calls for - again. They turned out really good! Thanks!

Very simple, very tasty.  I baked these on the BBQ grill, placed them in an aluminum pan and placed the pan on a pizza stone to keep them from burning on the bottom.  I did end up adding salt and pepper to them after they baked, which we will add to the recipe at the beggining next time.  Since I used the pizza under the pan, I did not need to flip the fries during the baking period.

These came out good. I didn't use the seasonings in the recipe..I just drizzled some olive oil and sprinkled some Lawrys and cook as suggested.

Very good!  I used 3 medium potatoes and doubled the other ingredients.  I also added salt and pepper (1/2 tsp each for what the recipes calls for) Mixed together in a plastic bag (which was so easy!) and then baked for 30 minutes at 450 degrees.  I turned halfway through.  These turned out really well.  They were a little spicy for my taste so I may cut back just a little on the chili powder next time, but overall a great recipe!

These are fabulous and we have them several times a week.  My kids love them and request them.  No more frozen french fries for us!  the temperature for me is perfect, but they bake in less than 45 minutes.  I just check them for doneness.  It usually takes around 25-30 minutes.  I do sprinkle some salt on them right out of the oven.   As for other reviewers saying they must be flipped - the solution is easy.  Place the potatoes skin side on the pan to where the wedge is basically standing up.  No need to turn them!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe!  I multiplied it by 5 because I made a big batch for a BBQ...The only change I made was to use 1/2 regular paprika and 1/2 smoked Hungarian paprika.  Thanks!

I had to make a couple variations because I didn't have a couple things on hand, so I tried to make up for it by adding other things. They turned out great, however my house was filled with smoke after about 15 minutes. I ended up cooking them at 300 degrees for 35 minutes.

These fries taste phenomenal! A great alternative to frying them. I didn't miss the oil at all! However, when I cut my potatoes I was not consistent with the size and thickness of each cut so my thinner fries were burnt. Next time I will keep them wedge size. I also tossed in a sweet potato. Will definitely make these again!

These were very good and I adjusted my baking time due to reviews. Next time I may follow the recipe to a T and keep a close eye on it though because I think I could have had a crispier fry that way. I also added some salt after baking because I live with a bunch of salt lovers. I enjoyed these with a jazzed up ketchup w/out salt and thought it was sublime. I really think that the cooking time is something everyone will probably have to adjust on their own depending on their oven's temperament and the serving of potatoes that you are making. Crowding the potatoes will definitely result in a soggier fry so give them lots of space. The good news is that these were way healthier than fried potatoes and just as delicious (or more) in their own way. I will use less oil next time and I'll let my potato slices dry a little in the air before coating them in the spice oil. I think these would be great dipped into a sauce made with chopped chives in strained, salted yogurt and thyme and a smidgen of lemon. I'm eager to try it next time!

I can't believe that making your own fries was this easy! I loved this recipe. I added cayenne pepper as some other reviewers did, then I thought they were a little too spicy for my liking, so that's my own fault! I baked them for 30 minutes at 425 in a convect oven, and that was plenty of time.

They were just a little less crispy than I would have liked... Next time, I think I'll use the notes of another reviewer and cook them at 400 for longer. Thanks!!!

These fries were very tasty!  My husband enjoyed them as well and told me I need to make them again.  I followed the advice of others and baked them for 30 min at 400 degrees.  Next time I might bake them a bit longer in hopes of them getting a little crispier.  Only thing I changed ingredient-wise is I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder.

I give this 5 stars due to the fact that ALL three of my very picky eating children loved them!  (ages 2, 7, 9) They never agree on foods, and generally do not like any kind of potato, except for the artery clogging fast food variety.  So I am thrilled to have found this recipe - thanks for posting!  I cut my potatoes into thin strips and did not have any onion powder, added a little salt and dried rosemary.  Cooked at 400 for 30 mins, turning once.  Also doubled the recipe.  I didn't really need 2 T. olive oil.  I will certainly be making these again!! No more frozen fries!  Will probably decrease the chili powder next time, just due to personal preference.  Thank you Ashlee!

They are a little over-spiced as written, but still excellent!  Shaking the potato slices, oil, and a bit less spice in a tupperware before baking works perfectly!  So easy to customize with different spices!

I sliced my potatoes thin which helped make a crispier fry. I also baked for 30 mins at 400 and the last 10 mins at 450. I also turned these after baking for 20 mins. These were so good, make sure you serve them with fry sauce. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks!

Excellent! I got my 4 year old daughter involved by letting her add all the ingredients for the mixture. Simple, tasty, and great joint activity with my daughter!

Wonderful flavor and a healthy cost saving substitution for frozen.  I used 6 potatoes, doubled the seasoning, 1/4 c olive oil, and tossed in a zip lock bag like others suggested.  Baked at 400 for 20 mins and broiled at 500 for 10 for added crisp!  I can't wait to make them again!!

I used 4 russets, medium sized, and quadrupled the spices.  I did add 2 teaspoons salt as well. Cooked at 400 for 20 minutes, flipped them once, then cooked for 20 minutes more.  Came out perfect!  So, sooo tasty!  Thank you for posting!

I made a small batch(one tater per person) and the kids went crazy over these.  Next time I know to make twice as much!!  I baked them at 350 for about 35 minutes, while I baked the Old Settlers Beans from this site.  I'll be making these again!!

These were super good. I even made them with dinner 2 days in a row and my husband was very happy about that. I was worried all the spices were going to be too strong or too spicy but they were not at all. They were just right. I did cook it at 400 degrees as suggested in some reviews and it was done in like 30 minutes. I did not remember to flip them either time but they were still perfect.

My husband was so opposed to the idea of baked fries but I made it anyway and he loved them!  I tossed all the ingredients in a gallon size ziploc as someone else had suggested and it worked wonderfully.

These fries were the best oven-fries I've made!  I followed the recipe, but added a little salt, and sprinkled sea salt on them after they were out of the oven.  I took the advice from some other reviewers and turned the wedges once.  I also baked them at 400 degrees, but after 20 min. I turned it up to 450, because they were taking too long.  450 for about 45 min. was actually just about right--but we like our fries crispy.  You can adjust temp and time for how you cut and like your fries.  I cut mine into steak fry type wedges.  The spices were not too spicy at all--even for my little kids!  And it really helps to mix the oil and seasonings in a zip-lock.  Just add the wedges (skin on) and shake it up!  I doubled the recipe, and used 3 big bakers--worked out perfectly. Thanks for the simple, yummy recipe!

these were really good.  i switched up the seasoning so that it would go well with the "Grand Marnier Chicken" from this site.  used garlic powder, paprika, a little rosemary, and greek seasoning salt.

My mother loves this recipe, and even asked me for it. Trust me, THAT is a compliment. The only reason I knocked off a star was because I don't find them crunchy enough, though maybe that just comes with the territory. Regardless, WILL be making them again.

These were awesome. I added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and used olive oil to coat instead of vegetable oil, and used a half teaspoon of salt.   I baked them for 55 minutes and didn't turn them over. They were beautifully crispy and flavorful.   Everyone who tried them said that they were the best fries they'd ever had. They were soooooo easy, and not messy at all!! I didn't feel like I was giving up anything by eating these baked ones instead of fried ones. Thanks a bunch for the recipe Ashlee, it's a keeper!!

I didn't have the garlic or paprika unfortunately, but they still came out great!   They were a side dish to homemade black bean veggie burgers and baked-from-scratch sesame seed buns.  It doesn't get any better!

Amazing!  Who knew fries could be this great?  We followed this recipe closely and it turned out wonderfully.  It's a household staple now.  A tip, you can make potato coins by cutting them into slices.  The thinner, the crispier.  Also, add extra spices by sprinkling them over the potatoes before they go into the oven.  Turn them once during baking.  That's it!

I had been craving french fries for a couple of days and just happened to run across the recipe.  Reviews looked good, so tried it out. Oh my goodness, these were outstanding.  I didn't have any garlic powder, so I put in a little garlic salt.  All the previous reviewers were absolutely right.  Do not bake at 450 degrees, they will surely burn.  I baked mine at 425 for 30 minutes, turning them half way through, BUT, I did cut my fries in thin sticks as is normally for fries.  I think if you have much thicker fries such as the wedges, you probably should bake them for 40-45 minutes, but 450 is way, way too hot! The fries were awesome, and I will definitely make again!!

Tasty and I find nothing to change about them.  I didn't really measure the spices out, just sprinkled them on in approximation and the seemed to work well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great flavor, but be careful of the cooking time based on how thick you cut your wedges. Very easy, fast, and tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to make...great and healthy use of my many squash.  I really enjoyed the addition of cinnamon w/ nutmeg.  Sticking, turning, and uniform baking was successful by placing a small mesh (1/2 - 3/4") oven grill for use over a cookie sheet when baking the fries.

The first time I made these I burned them - but that was entirely my fault!  I was so disappointed that I tried again the next day, and they came out great!  Easy to make and better than the frozen ones.

Yummy!  I cut into fairly thick wedges and baked at 400 for 45 minutes (turning once).  I added garlic salt to the rest of the ingredients, and served them with ketchup (and french dip sandwiches)... loves it :)

These are not exceptional, but they are very tasty. I like the flavor but it was still pretty mild, so I might try adding more chili powder next time.

These are pretty good...the chili powder and paprika kind of overpowered the tate a bit, I thought, but maybe that's because I cut the potatoes into shoestrings. They were also pretty limp; I stuck them back in the oven under the broiler and that seemed to perk them up a bit.

My husband and I both really liked this recipe! I did change a few things. I skipped the chili powder and added some seasoned salt and a little regular salt. I did bake them for 45 min. at 450 degrees, as the recipe called for, and they came out fine. I did flip them a couple of times during the cooking process, though, so maybe that made a difference. This will definitely be a repeat.

YUMMY!  My family thought these were fantastic.  Simple, easy, but with very good flavor.  I saw a bunch of the other reviews that suggested changing the cooking time and temperature.  As such, I baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  When they did not look even CLOSE to being done, I turned the temperature up to 450 degrees for an additional 20 minutes.  After that, I broiled them on high for an additional minute or so just to crisp them up a bit.  That worked out perfectly.  They could not have been any tastier.

this recipe is great!  my husband and our friends love the fries and I can never make enough.....important tip, spray baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray and season the tray with the spices....this way no turning necessary and the flavors sink into the wedges.

Way too much paprika.  If I cooked again I would use 1/4 of the paprika and add salt.  Needs a full 45 mins at 450 in a toaster oven.

We really like these!! I don't know if it's just me, but the cooking time isn't right for my oven (but usually my oven cooks just fine). I have yet to have the PERFECT batch because so far they are either a little burned or little soggy (if i leave them in the whole time they are black!). The seasoning is really good (don't be shy with it!) I'll keep experimenting with oven temps and times until i get it right for my oven. But they are really tasty! Thanks

I thought they were very good, but the kids didn't enjoy them.  They certainly needed more seasoning than listed.  I thought I added extra, but it might need more like triple the amount.

I followed the recipe just how it states but used frozen french fries for lack of time and they turned out just perfect. I topped them with cheese and sour cream and now its a regular side dish at my house. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

The fries turned out fairly well at 400 degrees for 45 minutes, but if your oven leaks smoke at all, it is very important to put the fries in a pan which will not let the oil leak, because the smoke from the oil on the bottom of the oven is very caustic.

These are good, but at that temperature they do burn around the edges and not so crispy in the center.  I think the flavor was good but lowering your oven temp to 400 degrees is a good idea.  You get that good crispiness. Thanks for posting!

This tasted great! I made a few minor changes as suggested: Preheat at 400 and baked for 30 minutes rotating once as noted. I also didnt have any Paprika but put in some Italian Seasonings instead. I also put it all the combined indrgents into a container and shook. Everything turned out great!

My Family loves these! I recommend reducing the baking from 450 to 425 degrees! I also recommend reducing the cooking time to 35-40 minutes, so they don't get over cooked!

These had a great flavor, but they burned quite easily.  I am not sure if I made the wedges too large and therefore they had to cook longer then they should have.  I will probably try again and cut the wedges smaller.

This is a pretty good recipe. However, I followed the reviews here and used a bit more seasoning than called for, about 1.5 X the recipe and the fries turned out way too seasoned. Luckily I was serving them covered in chili and cheese, but they were very overwhelming on their own. The cooking temperature does need to be cut down for regular steak fry size - I baked mine at 425 for 20 minutes, then flipped them and baked for another 10 minutes. I did have to increase the amount of oil to 1/4 cup to evenly coat my fries as well. Less seasoning and they would've been perfect!

These were really good!!!  I took the advice of another reviewer and was generous with the spices.  They were a huge hit in my house.  I will make these every time we grill burgers.  Delicious.

Just the recipe that I was looking for! Instead of having the high calorie and high fat french fries that come from burger joints, this provides a delicious side for burgers and sloppy joes. It has a great amount of seasoning and tastes similar to curly fries at Jack in the Box without the guilt of consuming fried foods.

I should have read the reviews before I made these...they were way over-cooked. And I don't recommend using smoky paprika, but it's all I had on hand.  I didn't care for these at all.

had to play around w/ the measurements since i was using a few potatoes. overall they turned out pretty good. wasnt too oily since i tried to watch the amt that went in. i took 1 mbr's advice and used a plastic container to mix spices and potato strips. doesnt have quite the same taste as deep fry but def better on your waste line if ur craving fries. next time i'll try using yams!

I steam/boil the potatoes first to soften them up a bit so they don't take as much time baking. I use vegetable oil instead of olive and I just drench the fries in herbs as it takes a LOT of pepper, dry basil and garlic powder (and any other stuff you'd like to add) to get that herb-y taste.

This recipe is great, especially if you have some potatoes that need to be used! I would also recommend turning the heat down a bit. 425 worked well for me.  Make sure the potato is completely coated with oil too, otherwise the fries tend to stick! Also, make sure you turn them at least every 10 minutes, as another reviewer recommended.

These definitely need less cooking time or a lower temp. I reduced the time by about 10 minutes, and the potatoes were cooked perfectly, but the coating was really brown...next to burnt. There wasn't much flavor. It definitely needs more seasoning, including some salt and pepper.

Good! I used corn oil the second time around and tasted better. bake at 400 for about 25 min, 30min at most. Flip fries over 15 min into it, then frequently check on your fries or do taste checks for the next 10-15 min to make sure it is not overcooking/burning.

I really liked these.  Who knew how easy it was to make these?  The best part of this recipe is that you can adjust the seasoning to your taste or menu.  The second time I made this, I added a drop of sesame oil to the oil mix (since I was serving this with Asian food) and used Jane's Crazy Mixed up Salt.  This is a very flexible recipe and can be referred to for the techinque

I found that I didn't care so much for the onion powder but otherwise the spices here are good. Cooking time worked fine for me, though you do need to turn these 1/2 way through. I think these look a lot spicier than they actually are.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe, using 1 regular and 1 sweet potato, added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, cut into thin strips (like at a fast food place), tossed everything in a ziploc bag, and baked for about 20 min at 400 degrees.  It immediately went into my permanent recipes.  Thanks!

I was surprised how good this recipe came out. I made them for my son to go along with burgers for dinner. I did sprinkle a little seasoned salt on them also. I did cook them at 400 degrees and not the 450 that was stated and gave them a few tosses. I took them out around 45 minutes.

They were great!!! I used a sweet potato and white potato because hubby does not eat white potato. I added salt and ground pepper and cook at 400 for 20 minutes then flipped and increased the heat to 425 to finish cooking and brown to a nice crisp. Will definitely will be making this again. Next time I will try fresh garlic and some onion

These turned out great, but I had to give four stars instead of five because of the changes I had to make. Added pepper and seasoning salt, and baked for 35 minutes at 400 degrees.

This was an awesome recipe! It definitely doesn't take as long as the recipe calls for, but they were delicious! I use a wide variety of spices, but my favorites are garlic salt, cayenne pepper and parsley!  Everyone who tries them loves them!

These were the best home made fries I've ever had!! I didn't have any onion powder so I used onion flakes instead and added 1/2 tsp. of lawry's seasoned salt, they turned out so perfect and flavorful!  I had to turn the oven down to 425 about half way through because they were starting to burn but otherwise this recipe was great! I will definitely make these again in the near future!

Mmmm! The best home cooked fries ever! I didn't have any trouble with temperature or time, I added more of all the ingredients because I used more potato. I kept an eye on them most of the time just to make sure they didn't turn super crispy.

This was a great recipe. I loved that the seasoning coated every fry. My hubby loved these, and usually doesn't eat baked fries. I added a little bit of cayenne powder and parmesean at the end and they were perfect. I'll definatly be making these again.

Excellent fries!  I ate them all myself and didn't even offer any to the bf.  I probably should've--next time!  I like all the flavors, but think it could use some salt and maybe some pepper--lemon pepper would be awesome!  I cut them into strips like regular fries and baked them at 400 on each side for 30 min, which turned out to be perfect.  Nice and crispy fries.  Thanks so much!

Awesome! My boyfriend and I loved the spices. I definately found that the fries did not need too long in the oven. 10 - 15 minutes made them perfect (I cut them pretty thin). I will be using this again.

Made this and added a little salt. I would also add more seasonings next time because my family likes it that way. I ate the leftover fries today with shredded cheddar and jalapenos. They were so good!

These were tasty. I took advice from a few different comments: cut them thin, shook everything together in a tupperware, baked only 30 min. and flipped halfway. The spices weren't evenly distributed with the tupperware method. My fries were cooked, but soft. I'll make them again, but I'll play with the cooking time, temperature and the mixing method for crisper, more evenly coated fries.

These were very good. My husband asked me in disbelief, did you make these from scratch. He is tough to please and he thought they were awesome. I cut them smaller just because that is the way I like them and I added some salt and pepper otherwise followed the recipe, will be making them again...soon.

My husband and so loved these fries. While not overly crunchy as I like them (why I only gave them a four) these are definitely a winner in my house. There is no doubt that I will make these again soon.

Tasty. Cut into strips, we've found that it needs a lower temp (400) and shorter cook time (30-40 min) or they will burn!

These were really good, but you have to really keep an eye on them while they are cooking. I cooked them at 375 in a convection oven for 45 minutes, turning over halfway through. I had to finish them under the broiler for a couple minutes. I also used canola oil instead of olive because I did not have any, and I added salt and pepper to the spices. The flavor was great.

Thanks for the recipe! It was very tasty. I didn't have any chili powder on hand so I used crushed red peppers and it turned out well. I think that the cooking time is a bit long..I had to remove mine 11 minutes early. So I would decrease either your temp or time.

These fries came out scrumptious! I made a few changes. I used in 1 tbsp of garlic salt, since i didn't have garlic powder and i grated about 3-4 garlic gloves into the mixture(I doubled the recipe.)And I also realized i didn't have any onion powder, so i grated 1/4 of an onion into the mixture as well. They cameout very flavorful.

These were awesome, wouldn't and didn't change a thing in this recipe! Although I did sprinkle some salt and pepper once they came out of the oven, but I do that with all baked fries. :)

I don't think I'll be making these anymore.  For what flavor was there they were pretty good...but needs like double seasoning that what it calls for.  They never got any kind of crispy, just stayed soft.  Thanks anyway.

Changes:
- 425 degrees for 35 minutes
- mixed spices and oil in ziploc bag prior to adding potatoes
- added minced garlic, which somewhat burned but still tasted good
- added sliced onions to mix
- sweet potatoes taste even better!

This was my first attempt at making my own fries.  They were good the whole family at them all, but my husband and I thought they were missing a little something.  I will try again and look again at more reviewers comments.

Pretty good recipe although next time I think I will make it with different seasonings.  I'm not a big fan of papairka and ony added a little but the taste was still strong.  Next time I will use garlic powder, and basil, chili powder.  I did not have any oliveoil on hand so I had to sub vegetable oil which may have resulted in an extra oily french frie.  The recipe was very simple and easy to make; however, I would change the seasonings.

These fries were very good.  I made a few changes: I added a bit of roasted red chili paste and a bit of cayenne pepper.. Next time i'll minus the cayenne. but a very good recipe.

I cut potatoes into strips and baked them at 425 as other users recommended.  They were pretty good, the seasoning wasn't great, I will definitely play around with that next time.  The fries never came out crispy, but my family thought they were pretty good.

Very easy and you can adjust the amount of seasoning and the types.  I added some cayenne which gave it a kick.  I only baked them at a temp of 400 degrees and it was not as crispy as I was hoping for.  Will definitely have to increase to the recommended temp next time.  A treat you can enjoy without feeling guilty since they are baked and not fried!

These fries turned out excellent! Very tasty. I didn't have garlic powder so I chopped up some fresh garlic (one large clove), and substituted onion powder with steak seasoning (reduced it to one teaspoon). Yum!

Superb and using the oven means no hot grease spitting at me woo hoo. The longer cooked the better the crispy ones are best and i used too much oil so i had to drain on a paper towel but thats what i get for not measuring.

Really good fries without the high fat and calories!  If I would have left them in for 45 at 450 degrees they would have been black!  I suggest 400 for 40 minutes...glad I was watching them.  I will make up a bunch of these and foil them on the grill next time we have a BBQ.

No measurements required. Fabulous late night snack. Had about 5 smaller potatoes in the cupboard that were ready to go so....sliced them up and started dumping the spices and olive oil, stirred them up and baked.Really good and easy.  Better than fried potatoes.

Good seasoning but the temperature is way off. Ive tried this several times forgetting each time about the results. I always manage to save them before they become completely charred. I would give it a 5 except I have yet to taste them without burnt edges.

My family really enjoyed these fries.  Because I didn't have enough time to cut potatoes, I dumped a bag of frozen cubed potatoes into a Zip lock bag and added the other ingredients and baked at about 400 degrees.  Because the potatoes were small, they were done in a little over a half hour, and I turned them twice.  We liked them so much, that I am making them again tonight, but I did cut up the potatoes tonight, so we will see how I like tonight's version!

These were great!  Way better than frozen fries.  I wouldn't say they are better than restaurant fries, but they are way better for you then restaurant fries.  I made recipe as stated, except I micro"baked" my potatoes before cutting up & added a little Lawry's salt before serving.  I'll be making these again.

The fries seemed under-cooked, and were very spicy. I used 2 potatoes, but kept the spice amounts to one serving, and there was too much of the spice mixture on the fries.

I'm sure that if I would not have cooked the fries for 45 mins as instructed they would have been great.  However, I'm kind of new to cooking so I just followed the instructions, and they burned.  I will try them again though as I am sure they would be wonderful!

The seasonings on these fries was great.  I think I used more garlic powder than was necessary.  My fries didn't really get crispy, but I think next time I'm going to use the tip to par cook them first and then put them under the broiler to crisp them up.

These were really good. I used Old Bay seasoning instead of the spices listed. I added too much oil and couldn't get them to crisp up. They were more like fried potatos but still yummy.

Good flavor with the addition of seasoned salt!  I cut into matchsticks and baked at 425 after reading reviews but they never got crispy.  Maybe the temp was to low after all?  I'll make these again with some adjustments.

Pretty good, healthier that's for sure.  You don't need much of the olive oil at all.

Everyone seems to love these, but I found them to taste weird. I think it's because the chili powder overpowers the flavor of the other spices...

I didn't have chili powder and they still came out delicious!  They were VERY crisp.  I also cooked them 20 min on each side.  Easy, excellent recipe.  My husband loved them and so did my 2 year old daughter!  So nice when you can please the whole family!

These fries are wonderful.  I add pepper and LOTS of salt.  I've made these a few times with fresh potatoes, but I recently tried this recipe with frozen fries to save some prep time.  I used half a bag of frozen Ore-Ida "Fast Food Fries," doubled all the spices, and used 2 Tbs. olive oil.  I tossed it all together on a baking sheet (sprayed with PAM) and arranged the fries in a single layer before broiling on low for about 5 minutes.  Delicious!

Wonderful recipe!!  I cut the potatoes into big wedges and served with Blackened Tuna Fillets.  This is my new, favorite "baked" potato recipe...can't wait to serve these alongside grilled burgers.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  Almost forgot to add that a sprinkling of   course kosher salt was just the thing on these.

These are wonderful. Much healthier then deep frying and you can play around with the seasonings. I used onion salt instead of powder, added some curry powder and a bit extra chili powder for some extra spice.

Good & easy potato side to make.  Don't have to worry about whether I have the ingredients on hand.  I used 5 potatoes, 2 TBSP of olive oil & just sprinkled the seasonings on.  Will cut down time to 40 min - got a bit burned at 45 min  at 450 degrees.

These were excellent.  I added salt (what are french fries without salt??), cut them thin with my crinkle cutter and cut down temp to 425 and time to about 25 min.  I've tried baked french fries many times but these turned out the best, by far.

Completely excellent! The flavour to these fries is simply delicious.  I did add quite a bit of salt though, and I used red potatoes, they were cooked with 20 minutes. Thank you!

These were Um Um Good.....  The only change that I made was by adding some Garlic Salt.  That made this dish a perfect match for my BBQ Brisket Sandwiches.  Heck - Forget the sanwiches, the fries were OFF THE HOOK... ( To my husband and I at least!! :)....

I used garlic salt versus powder. These were very good. Next time I'll add more spices... I was pretty light handed and as the "most helpful" review states, when baking the spices lose flavor.

These turned out very good, other than it was a bit too much oil for me. Will be cutting that down next time. Maybe even just spraying the potatoes with PAM olive oil and then rolling the potatoes in the spices. I skipped the chili powder, but otherwise kept the recipe as is. I used both redskinned and sweet potatoes. Very easy and very tasty.

Delicious! Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and just the right mix of spices. I did decreased the heat to 400 degrees and the time to 40 minutes. I also added some sea salt. These are some of the best fries I have ever made at home! Thanks for a great recipe!

Good, healthier fries!  I cut 4 medium-sized potatoes into thin pieces and doubled the other ingredients, shook everything in a Ziploc bag, and put them in the oven for approximately 30 minutes on 400 degrees.  (Don't forget to flip them half-way through the time.)

These fries were just OK.  They looked like they would be full of flavor, but my husband and I both felt that they were missing something.  Will make again, but will had more salt and other seasons.

These were a great alternative to fried fries, but no replacement! I just wish I could have made them crisper without burning. I will definately make again!

These were SO good - my husband kept going back for more until they were all gone!  I followed the recipe with some additions: i added fresh, shopped garlic, garlic salt (in addition to garlic powder), and cayenne pepper.  I cut my fries in regular french-fry fashion so i only baked them for 30 minutes (15 each side).  These are so so so so good - i can't wait to make them again!

This was great! I logged on here hoping to find a healthier way of making some sort of french fry that wasn't actually fried. This did the trick and then some. I think i could actually prefer these to actual fried potatoes. I followed the recipe to the tee, and was very happy with the outcome. I had my meal with a grilled cheese on french bread, and i felt like i was out eating at a pub. Quite a nice night considering we're snowed in by 15" of snow in Michigan!

I have to admit that the taste of these fries was absolutely wonderful, but the texture was not. I follow the instructions faithfully but the fries started to burn on the underside before half time cooking them. When I tried to turn them, they were so soft that some started to break in pieces (almost a puree inside). Once they finished cooking, they were not crispy and I had to add some kosher salt to them.  I loved the fact that the calories were 1/3 those of the regular fries in oil! (300+ compared with 1,000+ of the regular fries). I will have to try a different oven temperature because these fries are worth the effort to get them right. thanks for the recipe - any suggestions to make them crispy or more crunchy will be appreciated.

these were very tender and yummy but bland!  I seasoned the fries just like the recipe said and although they LOOKED and SMELLED wonderful they did not have much zip.  Next time (I WILL make them again - it's a good recipe) I will add more spices and salt.

This french fries were delicious. I didn't have all the seasonings on had, So I used instead Tb. chili powder, Tb. seasoned salt, 1/2 teas. garlic (not a big garlic fan), and 2 Tb. olive oil. They were a hit.  I will be using this recipe again in the future.

Without a doubt, these are the best oven baked fries I have ever tasted.  Not only do they taste suberb, they smell so fragrant when baking!  Crisp on the outside, soft in the middle... mmm.  Only change my husband said he made to the recipe was adding a sprinkle of coarse salt to the fries before baking.  Time & temp seemed just perfect for red potato wedges.

I was surprised to find that these were pretty bland on their own, although they looked beautiful. They perked up with some barbecue sauce and ended up being a tasty side dish. Still, I think they need some salt, and maybe quadruple the spices. I prefer the 'Totally Tangy' recipe on this site.

These had a great zip to them! I added a bit of sweet paprika with a sprinkling of cardamom to sweeten these slightly because I added in a sweet potato with the rusetts. They took awhile longer to cook for some reason, but were well worth the wait.

These were ok for me.  They lacked a little "kick" of flavor and crispiness.  I used others suggestions like using garlic salt, pepper, and shaking in a ziploc bag.  I baked on 400 for 40 min. I have had better baked fries.

First when I tried it it ended up real burnt so I cooked it again for 350 degrees and for about 15 minutes it came out really delicious. Next thing I knew I was always making it because it was so good! Great recipe but I would just change how much to heat the oven and how long to cook it. This is probably because I cooked mine in a mini oven. I made it in a regular sized oven and it turned out rubbery and burnt.

Very good!  Cripsy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The only thing I would change is to use a little less chili powder next time as they were a little spicy for my kids.  Thanks for sharing!

These fries were okay. I believe they needed some extra salt or something. They seemed to lack a little flavor. Next time I make them I will add seasoning salt and maybe a little less paprika and chili powder.

These fries are good but not great. I used chopped garlic instead of powder and added cajun seasoning along with the other spices. Following other reviewers recommendations, I baked on 400 for about 40 minutes. Some of my wedges were cut thinner than others and those were best. I'll cut them all thin next time. They're best straight out of the oven, they lose they're appeal once they've cooled completely. I'll try cooking them again at the higher temp.

My potatoes were on the small side I guess  - the seasonings and oil were way too much.  We didn't enjoy this recipe.

I made these for a dinner when friends came over and they were delicous and SO easy. I just threw everything into a gallon size ziploc bag, shook it up, and then put them on cookie sheet lined with foil. I did bake them for half an hour and turned them half way through as others had suggested.

Great tasting fries. Is there such a thing as a "healthier" french fry??? At least this takes the "fry" out and gives it a shot.

It was "okay."  I made it exactly as described, but I found it was pretty bland.  I added salt to mine after cooking, and it helped some, but it's still missing something.  Not sure what though.

I also cooked these fries at 400 as advised. I cooked the potatoes in the microwave before slicing, this lessened the time need in the oven and they seemed to take up the flavors better.

If i cooked it as long as it said they would have been burnt to a crisp. I think that is because mine were cut a little thinner though.  I didn't measure the oil and i probalby used to much also. They ended up super crispy so next time i will measure and not cook as long!

Excellent!  I used the advice from others, lowered the temp to 400 and baked for 35 minutes (flipping halfway through).  Used Lawry's seasoning salt as well.

Good, but a little soft and oily.  Next time, right before I take them out, I will broil them for a few minutes, flip them and broil for a few more minutes on the other side.  Otherwise a GREAT change to the usual mashed taters, etc.

I guess I would have to say that it may have been a good base - my fries came out pretty soggy - not exactly what I had been looking for, but not horrible either.

mmmmmmmm these were really good!  I love baked french fries, and I was looking for a recipe to give them a little something extra.  This was it!  So easy, and the fries turned out perfect. I did follow others advice and cook them at 400.

Thanks for the recipe!

These were excellent! The first time I made these like the recipe stated. The second time, I made these and added 1 tsp grated parmesan cheese and an additional 1/2 tsp garlic, for a garlic parmesan flavor. These are a definite keeper!!!

These fries are so good. Some of them came out a little soggy, so I won't put so much oil on them next time. I will also have to try with different spices and maybe some cheese. So much better than frozen fries and just as easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe! My 8yr old son, who can be very picky said these were the best french fries he has ever had! I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and used parchment paper, they turned out crispy. I also sprinkled some parmesean cheese on the fries towards the end. I'm trying to stay away from fast food fries and these hit the spot. Great recipe!

very nice with alot of room for tinkering to your own tastes.  I didnt have potatoes so put the mix onto some oven cook fries that I had in the freezer. You can add salt afterwards if you need it.

I used melted margarine instead of olive oil and I didn't have onion powder, but these were good anyway and much healthier than the traditional fries.

Nice alternative to the evil French fries! :) Don't forget to add salt, they'll be a bit bland otherwise.

No complaint here - these are great.  I have made them a few times this week alone and love the results. I tweak the seasonings as I am in the mood for since this recipe is very flexible.

Yummy! I made this for a snack for my daycare children and they LOVED the fries!!  I made these for an after school snack!  I did follow the 'advice' of other reviewers and placed unpeeled raw potatoes in a ziplock bag to mix the seasoning over all the wedges, placed it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and turned the fries, after @ 20 minutes of cooking!

Recipe is so easy, and they turned out moist on the outside, perfectly crispy ouside. I used chopped garlic in addition to the other spices and left the skin on. Delicious!

For some reason mine was not that great. It's good but not great. But will try again and see if it's different.

I followed some of the suggestions for this recipe and am very happy with the results.  I used 1/2 tsp of seasoning salt instead of the onion powder (didn't have any), shook it all in a plastic bag, and made sure to flip the wedges at 15 minute intervals.  I also used a lower oven temperature because I was roasting chicken at the same time.  As a result, my potatoes were not crispy but they were delicious.

I cooked these for less time at a lower temp, and I still had some crazy crispiness going on.. but they were tasty nonetheless. I'd probably make again. Thank you!

At first I was skeptical, but I've been making these for a while and everyone loves them!  I didn't like them at first with the spices, but I just add seasoned pepper and a little bit of salt and they're wonderful.  Thanks for the idea!

I didn't read the reviews before making these because they seemed simple enough; I was busy in the kitchen as these cooked so didn't pay any close attention to them as I should've and some of the fries ended up charring. As many others said, 45 minutes at 450 is just WAY too long to cook these. The fries that remained edible were just "okay". Next time I attempt to cook these, I'll add a sprinkle of salt, which I felt they needed.

Great flavor, but turned out mushy.  I lowered my oven to 400 after so many reviewers said they charred at 450.  That could be why they didn't crisp up.

I followed suggestions from previous reviewers by omitting some of the spices and adding seasoning salt.  I tossed them every 10 minutes, tasting each time to get the right consistency for us (about 30 minutes).

These are some pretty good fries, just need a bit of salt in the seasoning mix to bring out the flavor a bit more.  I'll be making these again.

We love these!! We're not sure if the time or temp may be a little higher than it should be of if it's just our oven, but they usually come out a little crispier and darker than we would like. We lowered the temp and bake about 5 minutes less than stated. When any meal has fries, we always make these. They are awesome with ranch!!

I was looking for an alternative to greasy fries and this is it!  I had to give this 4 stars only because I changed the spices.  I use only salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the potatoes and it tastes delicious!  I like mine extra crispy, so I leave them in a bit longer than 45 minutes.  These are wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good.  I cut down on the chili powder so it wouldn't be too spicy for my kids.  I also added some seasoned salt.  I served this with a french dip recipe that is also on this site, and they're also good if you dip them in the au jus from that recipe.

I am used to frying my potatoes in veg. oil but was low on the oil and searched for baking option. This recipe resulted in crispy and tasty baked fries.  My family, all 6 of us ages 9 - 42 loved the fries.

If you leave out the chili powder and use garlic SALT and onion SALT they are much better.  I made this for football snacks and when they were done I topped them with sharp cheddar cheese and crisp bacon pieces.  Served them with ranch dressing with taco seasoning mixed in.

I loved this recipe, a great sidedish for burgers or subs.  I changed it up a little though, I omitted the paprika and chili powder, and added salt and pepper instead.  I brought the heat down to 400F.  These were delicious and didn't last long at dinner.

These tasted pretty good but were pretty oil.  I may make them again but try to put the oil on more sparingly.  Perhaps only on one side instead of all the way around.

Despite all of the spice, I thought these were  bland. None of the family liked them. Definately could use a little salt. I Will not make them again.

A good alternative to french fries. I too put the wedges in the microwave for a few minutes to soften them up. That helped with the cooking process. Flavorful, but not a huge hit with hubby.
I would make them again.

I wasn't a big fan of the potatoes, but at a family gathering everyone else loved them.
