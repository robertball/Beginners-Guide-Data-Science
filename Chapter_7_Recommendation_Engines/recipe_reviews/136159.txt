I took someones advise from another recipe and crushed the oreos in a food processor.  It's very quick and you can't even see the "white" filling from the oreos.  Crushing them this way truly make the oreos look like dirt.  I make this quiet often since my 4 kids LOVE them.  I keep half the oreo topping in a baggie on the counter so that when the treat is ready to be eaten the topping is still crunchy.  It does last for several days in the fridge.  Hope this helps...

We made this for Earth Day.  It was easy and a lot of fun for a group of kids.  I'm sure they would all give this 5 stars.

This is a fast, fun recipe that tastes great!  It's perfect for kids parties.  I've been making it for 12 years now and I never make it in individual servings.  I make the whole thing in a clean flower pot and garnish with gummi worms, gummi bugs, and/or fake flowers.  Adding a clean spade to serve gives it the perfect something extra!

Yummmmy!!! I made these for a playdate and we're having a hard time not "digging" in to them before our friends arrive. I used fat-free Cool Whip, skim milk and sugar-free instant chocolate pudding...though you'd never know it by the taste of it! Kids love these, you can't go wrong:)

I made 22 of these for my kindergarten class for our Earth Day celebration. Quick, easy and they loved them! I topped them with Willy Wonka gummy bugs and they were adorable.

I was reminded I had this recipe yesterday when someone asked for the 7th recipe on page 17 of my recipe box.  So today when I went to stay with my grandchildren, they made this dessert themselves with my supervision, of course.  They loved making and eating it and said it deserved a 5 star rating.  And I say it deserves 5 stars for making memories.

I always loved dirt cups and this recipe worked out perfectly. This was easy, not expensive at all and something I could make for a party.

Just had seven teenagers over and needed to make something in a flash.  This is the perfect dessert.  I used the small plastic cups- and it JUST made seven servings for me.  Also, add as many OREO cookies as you like.  I know I do ;)

Every time my sister has a get-together, she texts me asking, "Can you please bring dirt?"  While that may be confusing to some people, I understand her perfectly.  She wants me to bring this dessert!  I make a double batch in a big mixing bowl instead of using individual cups.

So easy so good. Made as stated for a group of toddlers. Crushed the oreos in the food processor. Then got lazy at the end and opened up pudding cups and topped them with the crushed oreos and worms. Just as easy that way and probably cheaper when you get the pudding cups on sale! ;)

My husband is a Cub Scout leader, and he was doing a lesson with his boys on plants. I made these as a snack for the meeting, and they were a hit!

My daughter and I made these for a Halloween get together in our neighborhood. All the kids grabbed a cup and started digging in. I did change the recipe a little bit though. I chopped up four or five gummy worms and put them in the pudding for an extra chewy taste. Overall the dirt cups turned out great! I will certainly make these yummy treats again!

Great simple recipe. Since the pre-made pudding cups were on sale, I just redistributed them into nicer cups!-VIOLA! No mess, inexpensive potluck treat.

We made this for a big group of kids- they put them together themselves and had a blast.  Let them crush the cookies to get out some aggression.  We used the sour gummy worms.  Lots of fun:)
