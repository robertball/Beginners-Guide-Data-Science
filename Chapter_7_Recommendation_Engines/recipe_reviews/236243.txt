I was skeptical in making  this recipe.  Instead of  putting 1 cup of cold cooked corn and 1 red pepper. I bought frozen Birdseye - lightly seasoned southwestern corn bag (2/3 cup serving) and microwaved it. I let it cool down then did the recipe as it was written. It came out delicious. Make it, you won't regret it.

I live near all of the ethnic markets listed above and couldn't find a green papaya so I diced up a ripe one. The brown sugar adds a nice touch to a great salad.
