Different twist on French toast that our family loves.  I usually use a Brioche loaf which is a pastry of French origin usually reserved for tea, dessert or breakfast.  Gives this recipe that little extra ommph!  I was skeptical of using chocolate milk, but the flavor is so mild against the Nutella you almost don't even need it.  Served with 'real' maple syrup (not the imitation heavy imposter stuff) and pecans for a wonderful breakfast!  Thank you Nico!

This was awesome! Add some fresh fruit for a side, and make sure to add fresh bananas to the top as well and its even better!

How can you go wrong with banana & nutella?  This recipe is a delicious & decadent treat!   I wasn't sure if you would taste the the chocolate milk, but, there is a slight flavor in the background.   I would make it again, but, probably just use plain white milk.

This recipe was not that great.  I made this recipe for my son who loves Nutella and bananas but he did not like this at all.  Presentation is kinda messy and the Nutella is overpowering.  Not wanting to throw away all of it, I ate my portion and then instantly regretted it.  Way too rich and an instant stomach ache.  I also felt cooking it in butter was unnecessary and i could have just used Pam. Luckily this recipe doesn't make a large amount, so not a huge loss.
I feel like just a good french toast recipe with fresh sliced bananas and a drizzle of Nutella on top would be much more delicious and less heavy.

My kids love Nutella. This is a huge hit in our house. Its easy to make and it tastes great. I usually do not like French Toast myself, but this is one I will even eat. I have made no adjustments to the directions. When finished cooking, the kids and I sprinkle on powdered sugar and syrup sometimes. Most times, we make it with fresh fruit on the side. My kids are exceptionally picky eaters, but there is nothing left when I make this for them. Thanks Nico!!

Excellent recipe! I used peanut butter on one side of the sandwich for a little extra flavor, and it tastes amazing!
