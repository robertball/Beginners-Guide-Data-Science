An easy and delicious way to prepare carrots! I used baby carrots, and seasonings to taste. The home-prepared balsamic vinegar dressing and the light touch of brown sugar went well together.

I made this to go with a brown-sugar-basalmic vinegar chicken. Everyone loved it. I did add a bit more sugar & used a little of the left-over brown-sugar-basalmic glaze for the chicken.

I have never liked cooked carrots, raw, yes, but cooked bleh.  The ingredients looked like a winner.  Had to make my own balsamic vinaigrette because I didn't have bottled, did use brown sugar.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing.
