I made this and my husband and I really liked it. I did follow the recipe however I added a few other spices. After I added the olive oil to the skillet, I also added a shake of salt, tiny bit of black pepper, a shake of dry basil and a shake of garlic powder. I then added the 3 -   6oz salmon filets to the skillet.  I repeated the same added spices this time over the 3 salmon filets. I cooked  8 minutes, then turned the filets and cooked 5-7 minutes . Iâ€™ll make this again soon.
