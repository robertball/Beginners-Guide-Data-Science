I love tuna and I loved experimenting with this recipe! I felt so fancy using puff pastry for the first time it not only taste great it was simple to use. I did everything as it said to do and these "fancy" cups came out delish. I had to make my own gyoza sauce which I found a perfect recipe on allricipes for. I could not find any in the store. I have to say though I brought them to a BBQ and no one was thrilled to try tuna but when they did they loved it too! I would make these again but maybe for a dinner party instead.

I actually made the filling twice because the first time I mixed the tuna mixture and the drizzle together.  In the middle of the night I realized what I'd done, so this morning I went back and did it right!  Even with it all mixed together (which we ate last night) it was really tasty.  I made my own dipping sauce which was more like what the remainder of the drizzle ingredients were like, and I'm thinking that a store-bought gyoza dipping sauce would have been much better.  Next time I'll do that!    This is a great little appetizer and can easily be halved for a smaller crowd.  Thanks, Kim!
