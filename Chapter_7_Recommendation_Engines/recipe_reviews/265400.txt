7.21.18  Used Wild Alaskan Cod which baked to perfect flaky consistency in 15 minutes.  I used Italian panko crumbs, and served with lemon wedges.  This is an awesome weekday (or any day) dinner, so very easy to make, and an easy cleanup.

This was good. Not amazing, but I don't think fish can ever be amazing.

Like others I added Old Bays Seasoning on the fillets before adding the bread crumb topping. Delicious!

Great recipe! This is the way I usually bake fish fillets. I was given  some locally-caught fresh fish around mid-summer. I don't even know what kind of fish it was! After thawing, this recipe worked perfectly. It's  definitely a tried and true recipe for me.  I just don't usually add lemon to it, just drizzle after it's baked. I did use Ritz crackers, my preference for a crumb topping with fish. I would normally do fish at a higher oven  temp, but the baking time and temp were spot-on here. Nice browned, crispy crumbs and the fish was just right. Thanks!

Oh it turned out wonderfully! I added old Bay seasoning to the mix and it added a nice kick.

Excellent with the tilapia. Loved this simple fish recipe. I used 3 tsp. of dried lemon peel which I hydrated with 1-1/2 tbsp. of water and set aside 5 mins. Also used panko with a shake of dried thyme, 1/2 tsp salt and pepper. Note. I always buy fresh fish fillets, package them with my food saver and freeze until I'm ready to fix fish.
