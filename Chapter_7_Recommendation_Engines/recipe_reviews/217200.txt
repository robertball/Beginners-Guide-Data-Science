These are awesome.  I have made them many times for parties, however, I boil my jalapenos for approximately 5 minutes prior to stuffing.  It takes a little bite out of the pepper and makes it softer once baked.  Always a crowd pleaser.  Sure to disappear

I have made these twice now and will probably make them again and again while I have hot peppers in my garden.  Last night, a friend who was here for dinner, asked me if she could have the 3 that were left to take home with her.  Following another reviewer's tip, I boiled the peppers for 5 minutes before stuffing them.  They were delicious.

Easy, cost effective and delicious! 
Wear gloves (surgical or plastic) when making these especially if you wear contacts...trust me!

Prepared as recipe directed but cooked in an air fryer vs. the oven. They were delicious. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I made these and they were a hit! My mother and aunt (both born and raised in Poland) have never eaten jalape単os and don't really do spicy (unlike me), so I did as another reviewer suggested and boiled them for a few minutes prior to stuffing. This definitely took away some of the kick, and because of that, they managed to polish off half of them by themselves! Love this recipe, though next time I might skip boiling so I can enjoy the intensity of the pepper.

Just made these today and there were amazing!  I used precooked bacon bits and that made prep even faster. Everyone loved them and I liked how easy they were to make. Next time I will wear gloves to seed the peppers as getting the jalape単o juice in open cuts hurts a lot.

Absolutely delicious!  My guests loved these too.  I added a slight bit more cream cheese.  Also used fresh peppers from the garden.  After baking for 10 mins, I put them on broil to get the tops golden brown.  This is a hit!

Everyone loved them. I used red and yellow mini peppers which was perfect for the people for whom I was cooking. I will add more bacon next time.

I rate this appetizer a 5 with no hesitation! Followed the recipe to a "T" but followed the suggestion in the "Footnotes" below the recipe to add a tiny bit of ground red pepper to increase the "pop". I served these on an appetizer table in my living room right before serving Thanksgiving dinner and guests LOVED them! I did not boil the jalapenos ahead of time. Here in the Mid-South where I live, people expect some heat. The flavor of the filling was awesome!! Easy too!  If some of your guests are vegetarians, you can save some cheese filling aside  without the bacon, fill the peppers as usual, and bake along with the others.  WILL make again!

07.30.17 ~ Just picked our first round of jalape単os from the garden.  I whipped up a small batch of the cheese mixture and stuffed it in 10 halves.  Popped them in the toaster oven and 15 minutes later had a delicious side to go with our corn on the cob and fresh fruit.  Super simple to make and a nice way to use up some jalape単os.  I did wear gloves to handle the peppers while cleaning and stuffing them.  So glad I did as two of them were particularly (spicy) hot.  Like grab your glass of milk spicy!

SOOOO delicious!  I was disappointed when I went to my cheese drawer and was out of cheddar cheese, which never happens!  I wanted to make these really bad, so I used parmesan instead.  I thought it worked great!  I love how the bacon is pre-cooked then mixed in rather than wrapped around the jalapeno.  I don't have to worry about if some of the bacon doesn't get cooked this way!
