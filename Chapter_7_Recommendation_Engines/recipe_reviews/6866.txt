WOW!These are the biscuits I've been looking for all my life!I made a batch with whole wheat pastry flour and a little less shortening and they were still delicious!I used these to make dumplings for chicken and dumplings and with a little sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top the top of a peach cobbler.Both variations were great!I will never use another biscuit recipe again!

Foolproof and versatile! Try it for cinnamon rolls (use 1/2 shortening). Dress it up rolling it out in layers w/ butter like crescent rolls. So EASY and tasty.

My husband loves these! I didn't have any buttermilk so I substituted 1/2 yogurt to 1/2 milk. They taste like Hungry Jacks according to DH. Thanks for sharing!

My fiance loved these. They were tasty and easy to make. I also didn't get much rise during the proofing stage but did while baking.

I don't know what I did wrong but these came out hard as rocks and definetly not light and airy. I will probably try again but I had to resort to frozen biscuits for dinner.

These biscuits were very good! I give it only four stars because I have a non-yeast recipe that I use which eliminates the rising time. I did make these into cinnamon rolls by spreading it with melted butter after rolling it out. Then I combined brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled it over the top. Rolled it up sliced it and put them into mini muffin tins. My Sunday School class loved them!

My Mom made angel biscuits all of the time when we were growing up. She passed away before I could get her recipe. This recipe brought back so many memories for me just like my mom made.

Loved these - my first time making and tasting 'Angel Biscuits' but definitely not may last time. Made them in my KitchenAid mixer - could not be easier. I only used 1 Tbs of sugar and they turned out fine. Thanks for posting this recipe!

These were so good none of us could have just one. I loved how tender they are and how they are a mix between a biscuit and a dinner roll. I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I mixed together 3/4 cup of milk with a teaspoon of vinegar. I let them rise for an hour and they were perfect. I baked them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet for about 12 minutes. These are great to make when you feel like dinner rolls but you don't have enough time or patience. Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!

If they did non rise or came out hard as rocks you had one of three problems.1 yeast was old 2. water was too hot killing yeast. 3 water was too cold (yeast did not foam up) Also dough needs to be in warm area to rise not hot.

Love them over and over again...Used Cuisinart instead of "Two Knives". Making preparation easier...Talk about Moist!! You will never buy a "refrigerated biscuits" again!

These biscuits did not raise like I believe they should have. Is it because there was no baking soda? Other recipes includ baking soda as well as baking powder salt and the yiest. Guess I'll try those since the "rise" is half the draw for me.

We liked these biscuits. They were not as fluffy and light as I would have liked them but I might not have let the dough rise for the proper amount of time. I'll try this recipe again.

I tried thees twice. Once as written the second time I let them rise an hour as suggested by other reviewers. Both times they turned out dense and flavorless. Threw them out.

These biscuits were amazing! Lovely texture light fluffy and delicious following recipe exactly as written. (my only problem was that I was out of buttermilk and had to substitute with milk and a little lemon juice). I am a baker worked in a bakery and had my own wedding cake business for years. I LOVED these as did my whole family! They rose beautifully and baked perfectly in the 15 min. time period after rising just 30 min.. I'm sure they would have been as good without the full 2 tbsp. of sugar-but I loved them just as written. Now in my "go-to file"!

I have made these twice now & they are FABULOUS! I put ham in them the 1st time & then bacon the 2nd time. They were both good. Of course I had them with a meal 1st & left-overs were with the ham & bacon the next morning. I have not had any problems with this recipe. I put them in a pre-heated oven to 200 degrees & cut the oven off when I put them in the oven for the hour. They rose just fine & were light & fluffy. I will make these again & again.

After two decades and possibly thousands of biscuits that could serve as boat anchors I have made a batch of decent biscuits. This will be the recipe I will forever forward use - No More Looking! Yay! - and will build my 'experience' upon so that one day (later this century) my future grandkids will curse at my grave because I never wrote down the the recipe for 'my' biscuits;P I should mention that I accidentally used a whole teaspoon of salt and they weren't salty (I HATE salty!).

The texture is nice enough but this severely lacks in flavor. I make all my own breads and everything else has a bit more punch even though the recipes are pretty much flour yeast salt and water. I'd suggest maybe a wash of melted butter before baking or possibly integrating some herbs or other flavoring into the dough before the rise (I have the feeling Parmesan cheese may do well). It may work for a presentation with a gravy of sorts but on it's own IMO it lacks the flavor profile I'd want.

THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!  I have been looking for this recipe for 45 years and had given up hope.  My great aunt used to make these for Sunday dinner when I was a little girl and just called them "yeast biscuits". I used to call them "melt in your mouth biscuits" because that  is what they did.  She was a fantastic cook but passed away before passing on the recipe. She used to dip each biscuit in melted butter before putting them in the pan to rise ,so the pan didn't need to be oiled.  Yum,  I am so happy to have my biscuit fix back.  Now I can pass it on to my daughters.

Not exactly light and airy. They didn't rise very much. They tasted good and we enjoyed them but I was looking for a light and airy biscuit not something this dense.

I just felt like making biscuits so I made these up. They are so good! I used butter in place of the shortening and regular whole milk. The dough was too soft to handle even after adding another cup or so of flour so I put it in muffin tins and let them rise about 45 minutes. I got 11 good sized biscuits this way.

We had these for breakfast this a.m. The family liked them very much. They are much lighter and did not crumble as much as regular biscuits. The extras were better for breakfast sandwiches for the freezer.

when making these biscuits and using a biscuit cutter...do not twist the cutter..push it straight down then pick it straight up..if you twist it it seems to seal the edges then not allowing the biscuits to rise properly..just my experience with making these several times...
