Really good....I used all of the crumb  mixture for the crust instead of saving some for the top....thought the crust would have been way too thin in a 9x13 if I reserved some. I also added some coconut to the top. Really yummy and easy. Thanks!

MMMMM.....VERY GOOD! Followed the recipe except used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had. So good. Rich,chocolately but not overly of either. My husband says they're excellent! The bottom takes like a buttery wafer bar then combined with the chocolate is....just yummy!

this is a great recipe.  I gave 4 in place of 5 stars because I didn't have enough crumbs to cover the bottom of 9x13 so I had to take it out and change to an 8x8 pan.

I followed the directions exactly.  When cut, the bottom layer crumbled apart and the crumb layer on top was loose.  Something is missing....maybe more butter mixed in to hold it together?  If you add coconut to the top, then it's about the same as Magic Bars.  Doubt I will make again.

I am not a fan of dark chocolate so I made this with a mix of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips.  Also used glazed walnuts for additional flavor.  OMG, these are very VERY yummy.  Even the neighbors loved them.  And simple to make

Very good flavor. I overbaked them (30 min) and they were crispy/hard around the edges. Also took longer than 12 minutes for the crust to start to get brown.  Very good flavor, though I think it would take even better with some coconut in the topping. The crumbs for the topping could've used more butter too as it tends to fall off.

This just didn't have all the flavor I thought it would with a full can of sweetened condensed milk.  The crust was also pretty dry and flavorless.  It did seem to taste better the next day after having been in the fridge.

I made these for dessert on Easter and they were a hit.  I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and they turned out perfect.

VERY RICH!  Substituted a white cake mix for the flour sugar and salt.  The nuts add that extra crunch.  So yummy.  If you find that the crumb mixture is too "wet" add a little flour.

These were devoured.  I accidentally poured all of the chocolate chips into the sweetened condensed milk.  I was able to get some out in time and sprinkled those on top but it didn't matter anyway -- nobody cared because they were so good!

My version changes the Dark Chocolate to Milk Chocolate, replaces the Walnuts with Pecans, and adds a sprinkling of Coconut to the top.  

It works great that way!

Excellent and so easy.  We have used milk chocolate chips also, and its's so good.  I put my non stick pot with condensed milk and chocolate chips over the element that releases heat, while it's baking for the first few minutes, and the chocolate chips are nicely melted which makes it extra simple.

Love love love these! I made them as part of Christmas goodie bags. I almost didn't give them out; I wanted to keep them all for myself! Absolutely a new favorite treat.

I went to the Nestle site. Their recipes uses 1 cup of butter and 2 cups of flour. The ratio will be the same, but will give you more crumbs for coverage. This is an easy recipe    tasty and quick!!

These are pretty good but the crust is a little overwhelming. I think if I make it again I might add more of the chocolate mixture.

I actually made this as kind of a pie using one of the pre-made graham cracker pie crusts, it saved time and it tasted just as good. I also didn't have too many nuts so to make up for it I sprinkled on some marshmallows and let them melt over it. Tasted amazing!! Next time I think I'll try it with some coconut flakes

Everyone loved these.  The bottom did crumble a bit, but it didn't stop anyone from eating these.

These are very delicious and addicting dark chocolate bars. Watch out! You will want to eat the whole pan in one sitting.

Wonderful!! So easy and delicious!  I used almonds because I realized at the last minute I was out of walnuts.  Also tossed a handful of coconut into the topping, YUM!!

This was good.  I took the advice of others and used 2 cups of flour and a full cup of butter. I think we had plenty of crust. I didn't pay attention and dumped all the morsels in the pan with the condensed milk. 
I think these are a delicious, dark decadent treat.

This recipe was amazing. I made it for an office Christmas party and people couldn't get enough. I used all the crumb mixture for the bottom so it wouldn't be too thin and made a smaller batch to crumble over the top. I also used half white chocolate chips and half dark chocolate. SINFULLY Delicious!
