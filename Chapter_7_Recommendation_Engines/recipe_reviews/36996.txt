OMG! This was awesome. I wouldn't want Lobster any other way.  Only one suggestion, I don't believe that the Lobster needs to cook 12 min. on the grill. It stuck to the shell and was difficult to remove. I should of taken them off earlier.  My boyfriend and I rate our recipes and this one got an A+. We will make again for company or a party. A little expensive but well worth the money! Wait till the grocery store has a sale and stock up on these bad boys!

Fantastic.  Simple and delicious.  As other said, no need for melted butter.  First time cooking lobster and was very easy.  Two tips: use kitchen shears to cut the shell, and make sure to cut half way through the meat lengthwise where you cut the shell and butterfly it so it cooks in the middle.  Took a bit longer than stated, but that could have been the size of tails I got or heat of the grill.  Make sure to baste constantly to keep it moist.  And watch out for flareups when the oil drips into the grill (keep a spray bottle handy).

Delicious!  We used regular lobster tails and cooked them for 7 minutes....just cook until they turn white then remove from the grill immediately.

This was the first time that I have ever grilled lobster. And I'm a GRILLER!!!. Well this was one of the easiest and flavorful lobster dish I have ever cooked. I followed recipe exactly. But I also cooked some shrimp skewers, and just basted my shrmp with the same marinade Oh My!!!. Very simple and light. 5+++++Stars

FANTASTIC! We were fearful of grilling lobster but this recipe got such great reviews that we decided to brave it. Followed the recipe except we skewered them down the center to keep them from curling & then cut them in hlaf for serving. Served the leftovers the next day on  Lobster Salad with Red Devil Dressing (from thsi site) & it was excellent.Thansk for a great recipe Joe Nekrasz!

This recipe is so simple yet so good! I'm a lobster purist and I loved it! The olive oil keeps the lobster from drying out on the grill and the spices add just the right amount of flavor...not overpowering.  I've made this several times and I'll make it many more! Thanks for the great recipe.

Additional Note:  I've used this method on scallops too.  Excellent!

This is an excellent recipe.I changed a couple of things. I only used 1/2 of the oil and replaced it with melted butter, added more lemon juice and because my husband dosen't like pepper I did not use any.  We ate 6 lobster tail with grilled corn on the cob. best lobster I ever tasted.

This was our first time grilling lobster and it couldn't have been easier!  They only took about 7 minutes and were easily removed from the shell.  They went great with drawn butter.

This is the recipe I use on my lobster tails, except I butterfly and bake them, using this sauce/marinade to baste them before, and 2-3 times during. Baking them usually doesn't dry out the tail as grilling sometimes does, and is a much much more forgiving method of cooking lobster than broiling OR grilling. It results in a VERY succulent lobster, too. Here's the cooking times for a lobster tail by weight at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. You'll want to take them out once they reach 140 degrees internally.
2 oz = 12 minutes
4 oz = 18 minutes
6 oz = 22 minutes
8 oz = 26 minutes
10 oz = 28 minutes
12 oz = 30 minutes
14+ oz = 35(+?) minutes

And just so you know that I know what I'm talking about, this is what mine look like when they're done. These are two 6 ounce tails that I just picked up at Walmart in their little 20 dollar pack that comes with the clarified butter.
http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/561215_401361419926345_1424558192_n.jpg

Also, two little tips for you if you're new to cooking lobsters. One, I like to put a little water on the pan underneath the tail before I put it in so the tail doesn't burn or stick. I'd say about a cup, a cup and a half maybe. And two, the best way to eat this lobster that you've prepared is to poke holes in it with your fork and then squeeze all the lemon juice of a lemon wedge over it. Then cut it up, and dip it in a little thing of warm to hot clarified butter, and you have a little bite of heaven on the end of your fork. Enjoy. :)

This was wonderful! Except for reducing the oil by half (wanted to cut the calorie count) I didn't change a thing - except I used Maine Lobster tails instead of rock lobster tails (It's all I had). I served these with a grilled filet and a baked potato. I will definitely make these again (and will try it with Rock Lobster tails). Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!!

Fabulous flavor! We highly recommend this sauce & the grilling method of cooking. For only two 5 oz. tails - half the size of the recipe's 10 ouncers! - I halved the sauce quantity, & then set aside about 2 Tblsp. of the sauce to use as a dip for the lobster meat, which was a very good & tasty idea. I usually replace any recipe's garlic powder with minced/pressed fresh garlic. In this case, I used 1/16th tsp. each of powder & fresh. Terrific! Lastly, I grilled the thawed tails flesh side-up first, so the basting sauce would stay in the shell, its flavor surrounding the flesh for the majority of the cooking time. Right before turning, it received another basting. Unfortunately I don't remember how many minutes the 5 ouncers took to grill, but it was close to 10 minutes.

yes, this is the way to grill lobster tail. or any crustean for that matter. throw this on when you turn the steak, get your corn and asparagus turned, check your steak for doneness. turn the lobsters over, grab the aspargus, let the corn jump on the grill...grab the steak and lobster...make someone go grab the corn. now eat.

My father made this last night (well, he did marinate the lobster tails 24 hours in advance of dinner!)...it was fantastic!  The perfect marinade to keep the lobster moist and to enhance the labster taste!

Just wonderful. Made exactly as written except for 2 things.  First, I used cold water lobster tails from Canada ($4.99 each!!!). These were about 3oz each.  Second, due to being much smaller than the 10oz tails in the recipe, I only grilled for 7 minutes total.  I also applied the marinade to the tails on the grill.  Grilled for 3:30 meat-side down, then flipped, basted with marinade, and grilled 3 more minutes. Absolutely delicious, so easy, and amazing taste and presentation.  Will do this again!!!

I used fresh garlic (minced) instead of powder in the marinade since I had some to use up.  I used skewers to keep the tails from curling on the grill, but the exposed ends caught on fire even after soaking so I had a bit of a grill fire for a bit.  I served it with some grilled asparagus and the tomato and garlic pasta from this site.  Major points with husband (and on a budget compared to the same dinner out!)

I agree with mstrappero3. You don't need to dip this in melted butter. The marinade is rich enough, but also tends to tone down the richness of the lobster. This is definitely a keeper.

Because of the weather, I broiled the tails (using a metal skewer to keep them from curling) about three inches from the heat for about 7 minutes, basting at 3 and 6 minutes.

To.Die.For.
I have made these grilled rock lobster tails for the past three New Year's Eve dinners and they are delish!  The oil/lemon/etc keep them from drying out on the grill and the presentation of the split tail is huge on wow-factor.  My only tip is to watch these on the grill...don't walk away for a minute.

Ok, this is the bomb! We LOVED it! We lived on a sailboat in the Caribbean for 6 months and had grilled lobster on numerous occasions, but we've never had lobster this great! It's the perfect mix to make the lobster taste better than ever, thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I've made it a few times for my boyfriend and each time it is absolutely fabulous.  I like to spread it on the tails for about 5 or 10 minutes before I throw them on the grill to pick up the flavor.  These are wonderful!!

Excellent.  I also use this marinade for grilling prawns or large shrimp -- shells on or off, it's good.  Whenever I serve it, I am asked for the recipe.  Sooooo easy.

Dinner couldn't have been better. I accidentally put 1 tsp of white pepper in instead of 1/8. Also for some reason I didn't have paprika on hand (weird), I added some red pepper flakes. I used a electric hand whisk. The only thing I would change next time is to make sure there is more lobster.

I followed it pretty close, didn't have white pepper so used black, and didn't measure too close but did approximate portions for the marinade. First time ever making lobster and holy cow it was amazing! So tender and moist as long as you keep basting it. Don't even need butter! :)

This recipe is absolutely delicious! The lobster was tender, tasty and so easy to make. This was my second time trying lobster - and the first wasn't so good, so I wasn't too keen - but I ABSOLUTELY loved this! I will definitely be making this again!

i am not surewhat i did tht everyone else didnt do. i chose this recipe because nobody had given less than 5 stars. i made it exactly as called for. it was not good at all. next time i will just stick to making crab legs. i know a good recipe for them. maybe i shouldve used that for the lobster. to me it was a waste of money.

This marinade/baste is very good.  I made the mistake of not using the entire marinade so the lobster didn't have as much flavor which it could have.  I will make this again and use the entire marinade.  I recommend this recipe for a simple but flavorful lobster tail!

Being a first time lobster griller I was completely clueless.  

I ended up steaming the lobster THEN using the 'marinade' and tossing them on the grill.  They turned out FABOO!  I used it again, but the second time cut the oil down to 1/4 cup and substituted 1/4 cup melted butter.  That is also tasty!  Now I just follow directions for grilling and they're always a hit.  Thank you so much!

Have made this twice each time I cut the oil to 1/4 cup. First time grilled and basted frequently for about 8 minutes (lobster tails where smaller than 10 ounces). Second time wrapped in foil. Turned out great both times.

This was very tasty and surprisingly easy.  I followed exactly, except for using black pepper instead of white.  Definitely baste frequently or this will be too dry.

So simple, so quick and so delicious!  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of only cooking the lobster tails six minutes with the lid down for four of those minutes.  The tails we used were about 10 ounces each.  After flipping the meat on to the top of the shell and brushing with the marinade, when we served the tails, the meat just slipped out of the tail end leaving nothing behind.  Perfection!  Thank you so much!

I was a bit hesitant to put a lobster tail on the grill.  I love outdoor cooking so I gave it a shot.  I have grilled the lobster tails twice now and they came out great!  I continously basted the tailed with the marinade during grilling.  This keep them from drying out and they really soaked up the flavors.  Have a spray bottle handy because you will have flair ups.    We found the marinade to be waaaay to salty.  I will use no salt at all next time.

Must start off by saying that I think lobster tail dunked in warm butter is one of teh best thing son earth and this nor anything else can really compare.  BUT, when looking for an alternative that will save you a couple of lbs this isn't bad at all.  My wife and I enjoyed it.  Will do again if I choose to forgo butter again!

Ok, last year we went to a resort in Mexico that had a place called the lobster house. I thought that was the best lobster I had ever eaten. It was until now! The flavor that this marinade gave was unbelievable, I cant wait to try it on other seafood on the grill. Wow!

This was a great and simple dish to make.  The marinade keeps the lobster tails very moist... no need for butter with this lobster.  This is paired wonderfully with the Grilled Shrimp Scampi.

...We love lobster!  I've never had the nerve to bring home a live one...so decided to give these a try.  They were actually very easy to prepare.  We just split them down the back, brushed on the marinade and grilled them right side up for a few minutes while continuing to baste. Just kept turning until they looked done.  Ours took a little longer to cook and they came right out of the shell.  Even with all the basting, we still dunked ours in butter...so good!

This was my first attempt to make lobster and it was fabulous!  I made it for a family Valentine dinner.  I love to cook and will challange myself with any recipe.  However, when it came time to cut the lobster, I was stumped, as to what side to cut...the underside or the top shell ??? (don't laugh.  I said it was my first attempt).  The challange brought a silver-lining because when my husband saw me stumped, he took charge and saved the day.  He does not enjoy cooking and I have made many attemtps to get him and our boys in the kitchen and they enjoyed "pitching in" to assist with this recipe.  We didn't waste any time to add this recipe to a book I keep to share with my boys one day.

This marinade was amazing!  My husband loved it.  We have never made lobster at home and this came out top notch.  He usually dunks it in butter and with this recipe he didn't need to!  I followed the recipe except I used fresh garlic and cayenne pepper instead of the paprika as another user suggested.  We will definitely use this again.

Absolutely delicious! I used this marinade on the Brazilian lobster tails you can buy from Costco on the weekends after halving them and cooked them on my indoor/outdoor George Foreman grill. Next time I'll try it on my new charcoal grill and see if that makes them even better!

Doesn't get much better than this. We had grilled lobster in Mexico and of course Allrecipes was the first place I looked for a recipe and there it was.  So quick and easy to make. I've found the best way to cut the tail is to take a butcher or any sturdy knife and lightly hit it a few times with a hammer. I melted some butter with a little minced garlic and lemon added to dip the lobster in and served this with a baked potato and side salad and it was possibly the best meal I've ever made at home!

Pretty good.  I used more lemon in mind but did not note the flavor being imparted to the lobster.  It was still good however.  No complaints.

Had a chance to try this out on my Weber performer today. It was absolutely delicious!!! My lobster tail was gigantic so splitting it length wise was a must. I grilled it for about 2-3 minutes flesh side down, 2 minutes shell side then I let it sit for about 4-5 minutes in indirect heat with the kettles lid on. Searing any type of meat for 2-3 minutes per side then letting it cook in indirect heat is always a recipe for success. *basting is key here. Beware of the flames after 60 seconds, keep a water bottle on hand to help control flares. Enjoy.

I thought the paprika would be too much it was perfect.  I did grill a little different.  I split tail from the shell but kept attached and I put marinate on flesh and then wrapped in foil and cooked on grill. It came out perfect.  A good alternative to clarified butter.

Yummy!  Somehow I was surprised, that they were so good, never having made them myself.  Used chopped garlic, instead of powder.  The East Coast Canadian lobster was yummier than the warm water ones.

This was awesome, easy, delish. I only used butter, no oil, separated the meat from the shell leaving the end of the tail intact, and brushed the inside with the butter mixture, so the lobster wouldnt stick to the shell. When i flipped them I pried the shell open and basted the lobster again. The butter just sat right in there. Medium heat, 5 min each side they were done, they were 8 oz tails. I was worried, they were expensive--- but it was perfect.

This is by far the best loster recipe. My wife and family say, nothing else compares. **Remember to grill the tails "shell side down", so as not to burn the meat.

I won't be able to eat lobster tails any other way.  They were the BEST!!!  Didn't even need drawn butter...although it was nice to have.  I used fresh garlic, fresh parsley, a squeeze or two of meyer lemon, salt, fresh ground pepper, a dash of paprika and butter.

These were good but I don't buy lobster that often (hardly EVER) so I must say; I missed the butter.  I personally think NOTHING can top lobster tails dipped in clarified butter, drool.

This was fantastic and I will be using this marinade again!  I did make some changes, used melted butter instead of olive oil and real garlic instead of powder.  I also brushed this on frozen mussels on the half shell before baking in the oven, I am looking forward to trying this with other seafood!  Thank you for a keeper!

This recipe was perfect! A simple basting marinade that does not over power the natural flavor of the seafood. I also used it for shrimp and thought it complimented the shrimp perfectly. Anytime I grill shrimp or lobster I will use this recipe. No need for strong flavors when you are cooking something as delicate as seafood.

The cooking time wasn't long enough and some parts were still raw.  Not enough seasoning for me.  I wanted it as a substitute for the unhealthy dipping it in butter, but not enough flavor

Had 5 lobster tails and 2 people didn't show up so I got a chance to cook just a few days later.  These were 5 oz lobster tails and I found that just under 10 minutes made the lobsters much better.  This recipe is so simple but it turned out great!

Excellent Dish!  It got windy and cold, so I butterflied them and broiled them in the oven.  I had 3oz tails, I set them on the middle oven rack and broiled them for about 10 minutes, along with the Grilled Shrimp Scampi that I had scewered up.  At 6 minute time, I turned the shrimp over and basted shrimp and lobster.  I cooked for 4 more minutes.  Just the right amount of time.

Wow, these were so good! My boyfriend made them on Valentine's Day. The marinade makes a lot. He butterflied the tails by taking scissors and cutting the shell down the back. Then he pulled the meat out, and placed it so it sat on top of the shell. Then he threw it on the grill meat side up, and flipped it once during cooking. They didn't even need to be dipped in butter, they were so tasty!

These are easily the BEST lobster tails my husband and I have ever made.  My husband's family owns a lobster/steak house in New York and he grew up working in the restaurant and trying the various lobster dishes they had and he feels this one truly supercedes them all.  We did use butter to dip the lobster meat in and I would do that again, however, I feel the flavor in the lobster meat was SUPERB with this sauce.  It was truly the best quality lobster meat we have ever had and will be the only way we make this in the future.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This is good eats.  I made the lobster tails for Christmas Eve dinner on a whim, and it worked out very well.  I subbed melted butter for some of the olive oil and was able to multiply everything else evenly for 8 tails without disaster.  The one thing that I wished I knew beforehand was how important kitchen shears would be to cut the shell.  Incidentally, I cut through the rounded plate side, not the flat side.  I never really figured out if that was right, but it looked good on the plate.

I've cooked these a few times now, and it seems that they just keep getting better. I usually use this recipe for a surf and turf dinner. I'll never steam lobster again!

I had a very tough time splitting the lobster tails.  I ended up using kitchen scissors.  Although this was good, I won't make it again.  It was fairly bland, and grilling the tails made them very difficult to remove from the shells.

It was really yummy, and turned our well. Got a bit charred though.... Wondering if anyone has tips to avoid that. Other than that it was delicious. Will make it again.

Loved it although I did add a bit more garlic powder. Next time I'll try butter instead of olive oil and minced garlic instead of garlic powder.

Just Yummy! I paired with a champagne butter sauce which brought it to another level (2 tablespoons minced shallots, 1 cup champagne, 1 pound cubed butter. cook champagne and shallots until reduced to a glaze then whisk the butter in slowly, strain and season with salt and pepper). Made for a very special meal and one I definitely will cook again!

This recipe was so easy and the lobster tails were amazing. While I was making the marinade I kept thinking to myself this is too simple-Boy was I wrong the flavors work!!!! I did not change a thing except maybe the cook time was a little less....The meat pulled straight out of the shell---This is the only recipe I will ever use to cook lobster tails. Thank you for sharing.

We've used this recipe for cold water and warm water lobster tails.

This recipe is easy to prepare and will get many compliments.

Cook any Lobster Tails  on the grill the way you like them and this recipe will be a hit.

Wonderful!   Our first time grilling lobster tails.  We used little 5 oz. tails along with filet mignon and we cooked the tails about 5 minutes or so and then put them on the upper rack of grill till the filet was medium rare.  We butterflied the tails and cut down on the amounts of remaining ingredients.  My husband said "we will do this again..best meal ever".

I'll never make lobster any other way again. Our propane pooped out right as they went on the grill, so I had to do them on a grill pan on the stove and they were still flawless. Other than that, the only thing I did differently was to add more lemon juice - just our personal preference. I can only imagine how they'll taste on a real grill!

Oh my this was AMAZING.  No need for butter to dip it in, it had so much good flavor.    We have never cooked lobster before, I cannot even tell you what kind of tails they were, just smallish ones from the local market on sale.  I marinated the lobster tails in the marinade on their belly for a hour before we put them on the grill.  I also realized after we cooked them that I needed to cut the underbelly down the middle and had forgotten to do that.  Maybe that helped seal in the juices because as it was on the grill we kept spooning the marinade over it which caused the flames to lick the sides of the tails, SOOO good.  We grabbed the scissors after and cut their bellies (easiest way for this and crab legs which we also had) the meat was opaque and perfect.  You have to try lobster this way, trust me you will never want to eat at Red Lobster again, not when your food can come out this good and cheaper.

This was my first experience with lobster.  I had a hard time splitting them but I finally got the hang of it.  I actually googled how to do it so I didnt ruin the meat.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect.  My guests raved throughout dinner.  Thanks!

I'm not sure what I did wrong; I followed the recipe exactly; let the marinade sit for a bit before grilling them and basted them almost constantly while on the grill.  I didn't find that this recipe enhanced the flavor of the lobster; sorely disappointed.  Other seems to have had success with it so maybe I'll try it again in the future.

I may have done something wrong since everyone has rated these so highly.  The marinade wasn't great, I still needed melted butter with lemon to provide more flavor.  They did seem to cook a bit faster than expected (8-10 minutes).  I suggest adding salt, more pepper and a dash of lemon pepper and marinating for a long period of time in order for the lobster to absorb the flavor.

This is an amazingly WONDERFUL recipe!  Loved the marinade flavor, the grill flamed up some, but only ended up crisping parts of the meat which caramelized the marinade and was terrific. I overcooked mine a little, so watch them closely.....

This was excellent.  I really reduced the oil, though & tripled the recipe but added less oil than the original recipe.  It really had a great flavor.  We needed it to be healthier, though. Good recipe!

This is the only way I've ever made lobster myself and it's so good I don't think I'd be willing to even try another method. I like doing a butter/olive oil mix personally... A lot of people only do butter with lobster, but the olive oil in this is what really keeps the meat tender and moist, not rubbery like it can sometimes end up. White pepper is also important to this recipe, and many others. I've heard people say 'who uses white pepper?' I am a huge white pepper advocate- I love pepper, but don't always want the black specks in dishes and white pepper brings the flavor, but not the black flecks and chunks and because it's so fine, you get a much more even pepper flavor. Although this recipe says to 'lightly grease grill' I'd say fairly heavily, I mean not enough to start a grease fire or anything, but these babies can really stick and although it still tastes good, it kinda ruins the presentation to serve a mangled lobster tail. If you happen to have any leftover bacon grease, use it to grease your grill- it adds a nice subtle flavor. And I stay with these pretty much the whole time they're grilling... depending on the heat of the coals, cooking time can greatly vary. I wish lobster was cheaper and we ate it regularly, but it's a nice treat every once in a while... especially made like this!

Woooweee! This was so good, talk about simple with a bang! This is it. I agree no butter needed, but I made the same recipe and used butter instead of olive oil to serve on the side and people were putting it on their steaks!!

I loved this recipe.  It was so simple to prepare and just delicious!  My husband couldn't get enough.  We had metled butter on the side for dipping the lobster in.  This recipe is has become a household favorite.

Simple, quick, and delicious. Suggest using onion powder instead of garlic powder. My clients prefer foods without the heavy use of garlic because of the breath odor garlic leaves

Because I have used 6 split lobster tails at a time , I put the marinade in a  large Ziploc bag and toss .  I have also added other herbs like dried basil, rosemary or dill weed.

This was very tasty and easy.  I used smoked paprika instead of sweet paprika,by accident.  The result was very tasty.  Would make this again, next time the lobster tails are on sale.

First time cooking lobster. I was very nervous but it turned out AMAZING! Oh my gosh I couldn't eat enough of it. It was juicy and tender. I soaked it in lemon juice am hour before I cooked it. And as for the time, I just waited until it turned white and then pulled it off immediately. Better  to undercook it and put it back in the grill then to over cook it. I will DEFINITELY be using this one again.

Yummy!!!  I am not the grilled in the family and even I was able to replicate this recipe and have it turn out fabulous. I followed some others and did 1/2 oil 1/2 butter and it did not need any additional butter.

I loved this recipe.  I used it for grilling for my first time.  I made 1 little change and used some crushed garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I also used the marinade on my steaks.  Amazing!

This was our first time for fixing lobster.  Well, actually my husband grilled it and ate it. He really liked the marinade mix that he basted the lobster with. The lobster tails were very small so he grilled for about 10 minutes.  He said the end result was very moist and full of flavor.  They were served with 'Smothered Filet Mignon', 'Grilled Sweet Onion' both from AR and grilled Parmesan green beans.

I made this for my valentine day dinner, and it was delish! I would just advise you to watch the time...smaller tails will cook much faster. Don't be afraid to take it off the grill in as little as 6-8 minutes. When the meat turns white remove from grill.

OH - MY! AMAZING! I grew up in New England so didn't have high hopes for lobster from Costco in the midwest, but was really craving that taste so thought we would try grilling them. They were so good. 
We pulled open the shells of the lobster to really get as much meat coated with marinade and let them sit about ten minutes before putting on the grill. You have to stir the marinade well and often to be sure it all mixes together and you don't get too much or too little of one thing - was a little afraid that the marinade would have no flavor based on the lack of scent to it so mixed up some garlic butter for dipping, but I was wrong. I ate mine simply grilled and tossed the garlic butter. My husband broke his up, mixed it with a light ranch dressing and threw it on a hot dog bun as a lobster roll. We both found it to be fantastic.

Well, I was surprised at how well this turned out.  I brought in the new year 2013 with this dish.  I've NEVER cooked lobster before....although I've been served plenty in the past.  The ingredients sounded lame....but WOW...what a wonderful flavor!  We've decided to make this a tradition each new year....regardless of the weather!...and they are right....you really don't need butter.   One tip that saved me was that you MUST have a water sprayer when they are on the grill...whether butter, etc....it will flame up...and keeping the lobster moist with the oil/butter is important.  This is a keeper!

This was my first time cooking lobster, and honestly, the recipe sounded like it might be too bland for my taste...was I wrong! I took a taste of the marinade and thought it tasted like olive oil and couldn't recognize any of the other flavors. I was pretty skeptical of how the lobster would turn out, but the flavors all came together when I basted the tails and grilled. I was really happy with this meal and flavor... just wish I would have cooked more than two tails!

As a lobster lover, this recipe is top-notch. I highly recommend substituting cold water lobster tails, as cold water tails are sweeter and have a nicer texture, in my opinion.

We had teeny, tiny lobster tails, about 4 ounces each and they were perfect after about 3 minutes on the first side and only 2 minutes on the second side.  We reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup.  Fabulous!

My husband said this was the BEST lobster he has EVER had. He couldn't stop talking about how much he loved the seasoning. He said I could go into business with this recipe. I followed the recipe exact, with the exception of 1/2 cup olive oil. I thought that was too much oil and would put us into cardiac arrest. I stretched the mixture by adding a little water. Finally, I added garlic & herb Old Bay seasoning because I use it on all my seafood dishes. Absolutely a keeper! Thanks Joe!!

This is the best lobster I've ever made. The seasoning is perfect - not too overpowering, but gives the lobster good flavor - and the recipe is pretty easy to carry out. Definitely will be doing this one again.

Everyone enjoyed the lobster tails.  I didn't have to turn on the oven to broil.  However, it took longer than the time it called for.  They were delicious.  I would give it 4 stars

This was AWESOME!!!!! I broiled in the oven and I used Canola oil instead of olive oil...it was still soooo good.  My ever so picky son in law loved it.  I'm making it again tomorrow. I did marinate mine for several hours though and added some extra lemon to it.  All I can say is Yummy

Good seasonings and perfect on the amount of time to cook the tails. I personally thought it tasted a little too much like olive oil, next time will probably substitute at least 1/2 of the oil for butter.

This recipe was excellent, I didn't use the paprika or white pepper which I'm actually glad I didn't.  The lobster had a great grilled taste without really tasting the seasoning.  We had never made lobster before, went to the grocery store and they had South African tails that were already butterflied so we bought those.  My husband cut them off the shell and just cooked them directly on the grill.  My first attempt to cook lobster turned out excellent, thanks for the great recipe.

I used Atlantic lobster instead of rock lobster, and these came out great.  If, for whatever reason, I have lobster laying around, I'll prepare it this way again, but with the price of lobster being what it is, that may not be any time soon.  Edit: Also, I forgot to add, we grilled these on a George Foreman grill, and it only took about 5 minutes, total.  The flavor was not compromised at all.

Great recipe! We have used this recipe on shrimp and prawns and it has turned out great.  For the prawns we BBQ'd my BF decided to add a dash of cayenne pepper for an extra kick.  I imagine the pepper would be good on the lobster too.

This was a wonderful recipe and super easy!  Had everything except the Paprika so I left it out and everyone still raved about how good the lobster tails were.  I don't eat lobster tails, but it seemed to be a hit...I will use this again.

Very good, however, all that oil is not needed.  We used 1/4 cup of oil, added a tbsp. more of lemon juice, and I used garlic pepper instead of white pepper, since I didn't have any white pepper on hand.

First time grilling lobster and it was great! I was scared to use so much cayenne but it worked.  Also I used less oil, added fresh garlic, and used black pepper since I did not have the white kind on hand.

Marinated some scallops like this and pan fried... YUMMY! I'd probably add a little more pepper/paprika next time. I did double the lemon juice though...I used the same about of everything for about 10 nice size scallops and kept basting them with the sauce.

I made this recipe as a surprise for my fiance on his birthday.  I had never made any type of lobster and was nervous as to how these would come out.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only change I made was using frozen rock lobster tails.  I parboiled them for 3 minutes and then split them down the middle. Making sure to get the marinade over all the meat, I threw them on the grill.  They came out PERFECT!  My hubby to be couldn't stop complimenting on them.  I also squeezed a little fresh lemon on top when finished.  SOOO GOOD!  I went right back to the store and bought two more for Valentine's Day!

These were really lacking in flavor.  I could not taste any of the seasoning when they were done, and I ended up having to dip them in melted butter for more flavor. Nevertheless, lobster is delicious no matter what you do to it!

Not quite flavorful enough for mine and my husbands tastes.  Not sure exactly what could be added to give it the flavor needed.

Just OK, but probably won't make again.  Not bad, just nothing special.  Followed the recipe to the letter, so I'm not sure why there were so many rave reviews.

The BEST recipe for grilled lobster! Couldn't be any easier, and I WOULD NOT change a thing. This is even great on shrimp, and don't forget to make enough to dip your crusty baguette into!

Phenomonal!  We've decided that grilled seafood is the way to go now!  We have a great local fresh seafood shop we use often!  The "marinade" works great on shrimp and scallops too!  Just make them into kabobs and brush on!  We no longer see a need to go to the "national lobster chain restaurant"!

These lobster tails turned out great on the grill!  I used minced garlic instead of powder and just a pinch of salt.  A lemon wedge and butter for dipping and you are in heaven with every bite!

OMG. This recipe is amazing. I will never pay for lobster after eating this recipe. I made it for Valentine’s Day dinner and it made for a great touch to go with the bone in ribeye. I always thought was is the big deal about lobster tail, crab legs are better. Now I know I had not eaten good Lobster. I’ll never go back.

This is absolutely the BEST recipe ever!!  I BBQ lobster for the 1st time  yesterday , found this recipe in a clutch and chile... it did NOT disappoint.  I tasted the recipe as written  and decided it needed just a little bit more  to suit my taste. I added 1 tsp of onion powder, 1 tsp of Tony Chachere's, 1 tsp of Old Bay  seasoning ,  and 1 tsp of lemon pepper seasoning to the mix to  jazz  it  up. The base mix with my add on's made it  BEYOND memorable. This is a great  marinade for  lobster, going to try this  again using fish!! 15 min  and basting on both sides and they came out PERFECT!!

Next time I’ll buy more lobster tails. My kids ate these without sharing. The flavor was so delicious. I love simple recipes and this one does not disappoint. I can’t wait to grill some later in the summer for a family get together.

I like lobster, Mari loves them. Bought two tails at Kroger for $8 ea good deal. We were surprised at how much meat there was. Cooked them on the grill along with wild Atlantic shrimp, delicious.

First time attempting Lobster. Delicious! Used a grill top pan, only used butter, parsley and garlic salt for basting and it came out perfect. Cooked a little longer than 12 minutes. Started with the meat side down, grilled 7 minutes and turned to shell side for about 10 minutes, which allowed easy detachment of the shell and not overcooked.

This is my go-to recipe for lobster. I usually add a little bit of extra lemon as a personal preference. Drizzle this stuff over lobster and let it sit for about 30 minutes, throw it on a grill at 300f and cook each side for 4 or 5 minutes.

It was very simple to prepare and delicious! I did these on a stove-top griddle grill. I used kitchen shears to cut the shell and part way through lobster flesh. Brushed marinade on flesh and cooked flesh side down and then brushed on shell. Made sure to gently press flesh down for contact with griddle grill. Flipped to back of shell to gently cook lobster and then back again. Kept using some marinade to baste while cooking. Lobster easily came out of shell and didn't need butter. Used extra marinade to cook Tilapia filets as well! All were delicious!

I had to doctor this recipe a bit! I added 2 or 3 pats of butter, Italian season, fresh garlic and a few shakes of Ole Bay! I also used the juice from a while small lemon! It was sooo good! I should have brought more lobster tails!!!

followed the recipe to a T, I heated the grill, but cooked the lobster on the side without the flames.  Turned out awesome.  After reading other reviews, I wouldn't believe that you didn't need butter, so I had it ready to go, when the lobster came off the grill....But, like others wrote, NO butter needed, Tasty as it can be. :)

It was good, not as good as with garlic butter but depends if u want to b health conscious or not. I didn't understand whether to cut the shell from the bottom of top. For my oven recipes the tail is split down the back (top). I ended up splitting from the top flipping it a couple of times. It need the full 12 minutes as the  top inside wasn't fully cooked.at 9 min.

I mixed it just the like the recipe shows and we loved it! I agree with KARPOWELL that is doesn't need to cook for 12 minutes on the grill. Mine took about 10 minutes tops. But the marinade is so fast and easy to make and tastes great! Gives the lobster a nice little spice without over powering it. I will definitely use this recipe over and over again. I'm gonna try it on some shrimp for the grill next time. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us! :D

Made the "sauce" almost exactly as written, but subbed a little butter in for part of the oil.  This sauce is amazing, and is obviously what makes this recipe work.  I used smaller (cheaper) tails, but made all the sauce.  Used it to marinade the tails shortly before grilling and it was perfect to bring the meal together by dribbling some over the finished steak and asparagus.  I cooked my tails just under 10 minutes and basted them very frequently...You cannot walk away from the grill while these are on.  They turned out great!  My daughter devoured her portion, and my wife said it was the best lobster she ever had (pretty good for $5 tails).

Made this just as described, although my lobster tails were much smaller. Grilled three 4-5 ounce tails- they were done quickly and tasted delicious. Keeping this in my recipe box!

All I can say is melt in your mouth. I was very shocked at how well this tasted. You do not need butter and I always have to use butter on my lobster. We have used this several times now and will use it forever!

A friend came to visit from Wisconsin and I grilled Lobster Tails and Shrimp.  I used the same marinade on the shrimp.  Our dinner was fantastic and I didn't change a thing on the recipe.  A defiant do again..

This turned out really good.  Cooking times vary depending on size of lobster, so using a food thermometer is helpful. Internal temperature of at least 140° is recommended. Will cook this again.

We had 4 Maine lobsters tails,  5 oz  each. I followed the recipe exactly, adjusted for size.. We did 3 minutes on each side ofthe 
very hot gas grill and baisted liberally. The timing was perfect and the marinade was subtle but involved. We had a porterhouse on the grill as a side dish with veggies. Awesome.

My fault most of it tasted like burnt hair, but the parts that didn't tasted amazing. Highly recommend wrapping them in foil if doing over an open flame. The hairs on the underside of the lobster tail taste and smell like our hair when it's burnt

A few notes:
1. Prep time was 5 minutes including ransacking my pantry for the ingredients.
2. Skip the paprika - its not needed
3. Double the pepper
4. Cut the shells back and front but don't cut the meat.
5. 5-6 minutes on one side, flip and 2 more minutes. 

10 minutes is more like shoe leather. And 5 is better than 6 for the 1st stage.

I have never cooked or grilled any type of sea food before because I don't personally like it. However at a friend's BBQ last night, no one else knew how to grill lobster after they purchased it. I searched for a recipe and came across this one. I have never received so many great compliments about something. This recipe was perfect! I did not have any lemon or white pepper so I omitted those and added melted butter while the lobster was on the grill to keep them moist. I will definitely use this recipe from now on!

Just made this for Valentine's Day dinner for my girlfriend and I...it turned out AMAZING. I used a charcoal grill and it gave it great flavor. This is the first time I've ever made lobster and I can't say I've had better in a restaurant. I will be using this recipe every time I make lobster now.

Great recipe if you DON’T ADD SALT! The lobsters are salty already. You can put chopped parsley on top before sprinkling the marinade. Then 12’ broiling is perfect for both lobster and parsley.

Excellent,  but be careful when cooking it.   The oil (I'm assuming) flared up and my husband's eyebrows were singed when he put it on the grill.

I have never been a big fan of lobster. It always seem like an overpriced vessel for butter. So after going on a diet there were only certain foods I could have and I thought I'd give lobster a try, and this recipe was fantastic. I followed it to the "t" and the results were absolutely delicious. My kids even loved it and they won't eat any kind of seafood. Great recipe, thanks for the upload! Just a side note, I put a little honey on some before cooking once and it was great too. I just mixed about a tablespoon of honey with the olive oil and it turned out great too. We'll have it either way, this recipe is great without any modifications.

10 to 12 minutes is far too long under a high grill. Around 6 or 7 minutes (turned once) is about right. 
Listen to it - when it sizzles, it is time to turn it. When it sizzles again, it is time to serve it.

5 stars for sure.  Absolutely delicious. Followed the directions exactly, took almost 10 minutes to cook.  Finger-licking good.  As others have stated, butter wasn't required.  I'm not overly fond of lobster but if I see them on sale at the store again I'll be buying them.  Thanks for posting the recipe, Joe!

I always cruise right by the meat department lobster tails however this one day they had the mini lobster tails on clearance so I bought a package of 2 mini lobster tails came home and found this recipe.  What a wonderful recipe plus I grilled up some steaks for the perfect surf & turf dinner ... My love loved them!  He makes it so much fun to cook for!!!

Perfect.  Made it on our lava rock grill.  I did add some herbs from our window garden - oregano, basil, thyme and rosemary.  It came out moist and tender.  Just make sure to keep basting it and not to over cook the tail or it will get rubbery.

This is really a simple recipe. So I thought no brainer... But maybe my taste buds are unusual but this had little to no flavor & once the meat was removed from the shell it was done in certain areas but not all.  Couldn't throw it all out but should have. Wasted a lot of money.

Was expecting the tails to have a better flavor than they did.  The shrimp I made out classed them. Very disappointed especially for how much the tails cost.

I used the recipe exactly as published. It is as good as I have ever had at a restaurant. I used 10 oz Maine lobsters tails. My sister and wife said it was the best they have ever had. I did grill them on a gas grill and the 3 of them took about 20 minutes at 350-400 degrees.

Unbelievable how simple and easy and yet DELICIOUS this dish is. I keep trying different recipes and our family always comes back to requesting this one. No need to mess around or add things to it, the recipe is delicious as is and also works really well on similarly textured seafood like shrimp and scallops. I do these in the oven for about 8-10 minutes and they come out perfect.

Tried and true!  This mixture makes the very best lobster I've had anywhere. It's also an excellent sauce for shrimp. We have been using this for years. Each time we use it, we get compliments and requests for the recipe.

I didn't have rock lobster but I gave this recipe 5 stars anyway. I don't think it matters what kind of lobster you use, it's the marinade that makes these guys. Can't wait till next summer to wow my friends again. 
I get asked for the recipe whenever I make these. I have decided it is a closely guarded secret. :)

The marinade tastes great on the lobster and also on shrimp. I think the 10-12 mins is a bit too long though, but it still tastes good :)

Recently moved to south FL and used this recipe with our first hand-caught spiny lobsters!  It was great, and I didn't have white pepper - fresh ground black worked fine.  Only thing I would mention is that we did cut each tail completely in half...so two tails equals four separate pieces.  They cooked quicker, the marinade absorbed better, and my kids and I tend to like the meat more well done.  Anyway, great recipe..will definitely share and repeat!

My husband and I both enjoyed it.  We did cut through the lobster meat and rubbed with seasonings.  Left sit in frig for a couple of hours and the meat was so good. We did dip it in drawn butter, just our choice for lobster.  This will be on the top of our lobster list

Excellent recipe!  I've never grilled lobster before and this turned out well.  I basted as instructed and the lobster did not dry out.  The baste also added a nice flavor.  I did not miss dipping the lobster in butter.

Made this for my wife and family on Mother's Day for the first time...never a concern with recipes with great reviews on this website...Came out perfect (took about 15 minutes on the grill--we had large lobster tails, so it depends on their size for the grilling time.
Flavor wasn't overwhelming which was great and everyone raving about how great the flavor was, which allowed the flavor of the lobster to shine. I substituted the salt with garlic salt since I didn't have any garlic powder...
Everyone was worried that grilling the shrimp would cause it to be dry, oh contraire, it was moist and delicious.
Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made these twice now and they are delicious and easy.  The first time I BBQed them with steak and put them on when I turned the steak so that they would be on the grill for 7-8 minutes...but they weren't quite done so I had to finish them under the broiler for 3 minutes.
The second time I cooked them for 7-8 minutes each side on the grill with our steak and they came out perfectly!

This is the first time that I have prepared lobster on the grill, and it was AWESOME!  This made my Christmas Eve surf n turf meal awesome!  If you are using a charcoal grill(the only type any real grill master uses) and you use a chimney to start your coals, lower the cooking time, the chimney gets the coals so hot, I would leave on around 8 minutes.

I grilled and used this recipe last night!  Best Lobster I have ever had.  I was so tired of the typical butter/garlic marinade.  This was certainly a fabulous change!  Tonight I made grilled cheese/lobster sandwiches with the leftover-----so good.  Can't wait to make this for my friends!

My boyfriend absolutely loved these.   Said it was fabulous and best lobster he has ever had.  He melted butter but used it for the shrimp I made too spicy for him instead of for the lobster!  Will definitely make again! Super easy and all ingredients on hand.  I used lobster tails from the meat/seafood department for $5/each rather than the Rock Lobster and $15 each.

We have tried lobster in every which way this recipe by far is the best I have had.  My hat is off to the cook.

I made this for Thanksgiving and served it with ribeye steaks.  My husband loved this.  We both thought it was fantastic.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and skewered the lobster on skewers to keep them from curling.  The lobster was moist and flavorful.  This is a keeper!

Fantastic recipe - easy to make, great tasting and impressive for entertaining! Works well with roasted corn as other reviewers have mentioned. Our only suggestion would be to ensure you make extra as you will likely want a second helping!

I used this on something called a 'lobster shrimp', not sure what the official name is but it cooks up very similar. Delicious in a cast iron skillet. I recommend butterflying the underside (legs side) for cooking within the recommended 10 or so minutes.

Excellent recipe. Wonderful flavor. The only change I made was placing metal skewers through the meat to avoid curling. I also wrapped them in tinfoil to secure in the juices. I did have to cook my smaller tails for 16 minutes. I have made this 3 times in 1 month. I purchased (2) 7 oz. tails and had plenty of marinade left over which I used on my grilled tuna.... Thanks for sharing...

It was good.  I used Maine Lobster Tails since that it what I had on hand.  I prefer broiled lobster tails better though.

Delicious!  My first time cooking lobstor at home, and will definately use this recipe again & again!  Didn't need the whole marinade though, so will probably cut the recipe in half.  I don't think we cooked it long enough either, but it was still great.

These were FANTASTIC!!!!! They truly melted in your mouth, with such great flavor! I did use 4 smaller 4oz tails, and just reduced the cook time.Highly recommend to anyone who loves to grill anything and everything!

Followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious. I took the meat completely out, although it was still attached to the tail and let it grill with the meat completely exposed to the grill and the shell resting on the meat. I basted the meat front and back as the tail was was easy to manipulate while the meat was out. 
Lobster is so expensive. I only cooked two tails, could have easily eaten more.
Have fun cooking.

This recipe makes some awesome lobster tails, and is really quick and easy as well. Definately one of my favorites.
