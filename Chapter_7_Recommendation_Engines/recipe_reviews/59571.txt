One of the best mushroom soups I've ever tried!  Because garlic is good in almost everything I added three cloves of freshly chopped garlic when I sauteed the veggies; and because I was too lazy to make rice I added a handful of dry orzo to cook up as the soup simmered.  I used my immersion blender to slighly puree a small amount of the soup which gave an illusion of creaminess; but still left it very chunky.

A wonderful mushroom soup recipe full of flavor without the fat! Truly an excellent base that can be changed up tons of different ways to suit your personal preferences. I omitted the carrots and leeks, used about 3 pounds mushrooms (white/crimini/shitake), added garlic to the onion/celery mixture, a couple of sprinkles of beef boullion granules, and a few dashes hot sauce. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was great! I didn't have any leeks, so I left them out, and the only thing I added that was different was a packet of onion-mushroom soup mix. I may try some white wine next time, but my husband said it was great as is.

This was good, and certainly a healthy dish as written. It would be a good choice for someone wanting to eat lighter fare, and possibly wanting to reduce calorie intake. Essentially, this is a tasty broth with ample mushrooms. In reading the 84 reviews, it seemed to have a high percentage of reviewers deviating from the written recipe which makes one wonder whether to follow along and whether the rating is sound since they didn’t taste the real deal. Prepared the recipe as written, and in retrospect, wish we had adopted some of the changes others had made. We would probably not make this again unless there were dietary reasons to do so.

This soup is very tasty.  I use a vegetable broth or stock.  It is the perfect vegetarian soup.  I tried it pureed and not.  I can't decide which I like better.  Last time I made it, I pureed about half then mixed it with the other.  Yummy!

I make this soup quite often and it's always a hit.  I cook it as written.  Great with garlic bread and a nice chianti.

This is a delicious soup. I made it as described with the addition of garlic. When finished I thought that it was really good but needed a little help. I added a bit of beef stock and some red wine. It really perked up!
  This is a very healthy and satisfying soup. Low in fat and calories. Thanks!

ohmygod...what a great soup.   The few changes I made were cabbage instead of leeks( I didn't have any)  added a tad of garlic, white button and portabella mushrooms, 2 can's veggie broth and a can of beef gravy instead of the chicken broth.  The rest was the same.   Other's like it pured, but I prefered it chunky. I will Definately make it again and again.

When followed to the 'T,' the recipe is great for what it offers. It has a great blend of everything - flavor, freshness and uninhibited ingredients. I deviated slightly because I don't like leeks and there was no celery, so I just subbed other vegies. I pureed half the pot for thickness because my fiance won't eat "thin" soup. I liked it with the wild rice and parsley. I might try it with barley next time. Great soup!

I did not have leeks and I used mushroom stock (Better then Bullion) and this soup was fantastic! I also added about 1/2 cup of uncooked farro when I added the broth and about a 1/2 cup finely chopped kale right at the end. Very healthy and my kids even liked it. Even my 10 month old baby ate it!

We love, love, love this! I've made it twice now and was pleasantly surprised at how much my husband likes it. I leave out the celery because I'm sensitive to it and use dried thyme. This pairs really well with the Fabulous Fargozas (muffins). When I gave some to a friend I threw in some shredded chicken to make it more of a complete meal for her. She loved it too.

I LOVE this soup!!  I prepare mostly as written, however I have been using beef broth instead of chicken since that's what I had on hand the first time I made it and it was sooo good I didn't want to change it after that!  I also add about 2-3 cloves of crushed garlic.  (oh...and I have never had any leeks or green onions on hand, lol!  Guess I should try to follow the directions and it would be even more delicious)  Right before it's done I use an immersion blender to take out some of the chunks.

Wow! This soup was so good! I appreciated the fact that it wasn't made with cream, which made the soup less heavy. It had a very pleasant mushroom flavor. I did add a bay leaf and some dried parsley to give it more flavor, since I did not have leeks or green onions on hand. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and cut down the amount. Since most of my family doesn't care for mushrooms, they wouldn't eat it, but those of us who do like mushrooms really loved this soup! I will be making it again; thanks for a great recipe!

I wanted a mushroom soup that was lower in calories than the cream of mushroom soups I love so much, decided to give this recipe a go.  It had ingredients that I already had on hand, quick to make, and utterly delicious.  A friend popped over after it was done so I offered her a bowl.  She raved and raved about it and had to get the recipe so she could make it for her family that night.  My husband loved it as well!  Can't wait to try it on my adult kids, some who have declared their disdain for all things soup.  The flavor in this soup is amazingly irresistible!  Thank you for posting your recipe!!

I used vegetable broth & olive oil (instead of chicken stock & butter). This is one of the easiest and best soup recipes.  Also allergy-friendly, I barely had to alter.  Thanks for posting!

My husband and I liked this. Just out of curiosity, I cooked and added a mixture of Minnesota wild rice and brown rice ; then, I blended some of the soup. It added a nice creamy earthy touch. I used crimini and shiitake mushrooms.  Loved the leeks. Made my own chicken stock. I will definitely try this again. Makes a great hearty soup for cold nights in Minnesota.

I've made this soup twice now. The first time with chicken stock and the second with vegetable broth. It was best with the chicken stock, but both were a little bland ... asking for more salt than I was comfortable using. It was good, but I'm still looking for a better broth-based mushroom soup.

Great Soup, great flavor.  However, I thought there were too many mushrooms.  I was really surprised with how much flavor existed, with so few ingredients.  I will make this soup again, and again.

This soup recipe has good bones, but for my tastes it required quite a bit of tinkering to make it work for me.  What foremost impressed me about this soup is that I could feel good eating it - it is nothing but fresh, lovely ingredients. But it was a bit on the weak side in terms of substance and flavor.  Given the submitter gives her permission to modify this to our tastes, I did, in several ways.  I don't like carrots, so that was already out.  I was a little short on the amount of  mushrooms and had no leeks so I filled in with zucchini and fresh baby spinach, (added at the end until just wilted).  Finely chopped red bell pepper added both color interest and flavor.  I sautéed the vegetables in olive oil and added fresh minced garlic, tho' I would have had no problem using garlic powder if fresh was not available.  A good glug of white wine (Pinot Grigio) and a combination of both chicken and beef stock also lent a deeper color and flavor.   At this point I was happier, but still something was missing for me.  While this soup certainly wasn't a deal breaker without it, adding a little pastina (small soup pasta) completed this for me, making it rich and satisfying.

I doubled everything in this recipe except the mushrooms, i used only the two pounds I had, sliced thinly.  I used 8 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups beef broth and I added 4 cloves of fresh garlic minced up. I did not add the green onions at the end.  This recipe had a wonderful taste to it! Even my 18mth old loved it!  For those like my hubby who can't fathom a meal without meat, I took some leftover pork chops, sliced the meat into thin strips, fried it with onions and served it over the soup.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing!!

Wow this is good! I am actually eating it while I am typing this review. I made the mistake of not using enough mushrooms and I added Barley. Next time I will use the whole 2lbs of mushrooms and WAY less Barley (I only used 3/4 cup which was too much). The broth of the soup is phenomenal especially with the leeks and Thyme. I used a mixture of of Enok, Skiitake, Crimini, and Yellow Oyster Mushrooms for extra flavor.   This is a really great soup and I definitely recommend it!

So, so, so delicious!!! I used four cups of chicken stock and two cups of vegetable stock, and I don't care for thyme, so I used marjoram and basil. Spun the immersion blender through it (lightly) so it still retained some texture. I can't wait to try it with several different types of mushrooms!

As suggested by other reviewers, I added the garlic and Worcestershire sauce.   I used a combo of portabella and shiitake mushrooms.  I made this twice in one week.  I had orzo in the pantry so that's what I used.  Great soup and I love that it doesn't have cream.

This is excellent soup recipe to begin with, but adding in the fact that this is also a great Paleo and Primal, gluten- and grain-free alternative to the cream and barley based ones.  Since I didn't have any leeks on hand and had a bunch of celery to use up, I instead modified this using the following: 2cups of carrots, onion and celery, 2 cans of sliced mushrooms, 1 quart veggie stock and 1 quart chicken stock, 1tsp dried thyme, and garlic salt to taste.  This turned out wonderful and filling and am very happy to come across this recipe.

Very delicious! Admittedly, i changed a lot of things due to forgetful shopping and our tastes, but the flavor started with the recipe. I didn't have leeks so i doubled up on green onions, and I didn't have celery either (!) but it was still good. I used half white button mushrooms and half brown pearl mushrooms. I also added about 3/4 cup _cooked_ black'n'brown rice to the soup as it cooked, which added a nice texture and nuttiness. After cooking the soup, i quickly browned some chicken breasts and then added soup to the skillet to cook them the rest of the way. then, let it all mellow in the fridge. the next day, i tasted and it was missing something. added a splash of red wine to the soup and chicken breasts in a skillet and re-heated for dinner--yum! rich and delicious without any added oil, fat, or cream!

Excellent recipe! I omitted the carrots etc, and instead used one chopped white onion, and added some sherry.

This is some tasty soup!  I dislike the texture of onions, so I minced it and then cooked as directed.  I added some hulled hemp seed for a nutrition boost and some wild rice blend for added texture.

As written this soup is pretty good.  It needs some added flavor though.  With some tweaking I think it could be great.  I made it as written this time to see how it turned out.  It definitely needs a few changes for my taste.  I agree with other reviewers that beef stock might be better.  I think it would lend a stronger flavor to the soup, and would compliment the mushrooms better than chicken stock.  I also would add garlic next time, and maybe a splash of worchestershire sauce.  It's a good base that I can adjust to suit my taste.  Will definitely make again.

I wished I had some Worcestire on hand to deepen the flavor.  This soup was ok but unremarkable.  I added some acini de peppe pasta for texture and used crimini mushrooms. ADDED - it is better the next day.

This is an excellent soup! It was pricey as the mushroom are expensive - but really worth it. I did follow Chef John's technique of caramelizing the mushrooms to bring out the full flavor and I also added a little crushed garlic. No leeks as I did not have any. Delicious!

Absolutely loved it.....I read the reviews and did tweak it a bit....added 2 cloves garlic when cooking the vegetables, added a few strong dashes of hot sauce, added 1 beef bouillon cube crushed, an extra two cups of chicken broth, 1 1/2 cups rotisserie chicken broken in tiny pieces, and when I was putting the lid on to simmer I added about 2 cups of small shells.

Made for the first time tonight. Added a clove of chopped garlic to the veggies and sautéed  them before adding the broth. Also added a cup of wild rice and only pureed part of the soup. Excellent!

Gorgeous soup, great for me as I hate creamy soups. 
I followed the recipe exactly but would add more stock next time. I only used 1lb of mushrooms and that was plenty? Will be making this again and again....

I added some small star pasta to this near the end of it cooking.  Also, right before I stirred in the stock, I stirred in about 2 tbsp. all purpose flour with the veggies.  This thickened it up just enough.  I took the advice of others and added a couple of dashes of hot sauce and a bay leaf.

This really is a delicious soup - I enjoyed it with a chicken salad sandwich.  I opted to add some finely chopped yellow squash instead of leeks and used a combination of garlic, curry, and white wine for the seasoning.  Also added about a tsp of flour to the sauteed veggies just to thicken it up a bit as I did not want to puree and lose the texture.

Holy Mushrooms Batman!   This recipe is fabulous!  I had to change it up just a little since I'm on a fairly strict sodium restriction: I used ~half low-sodium vegetable stock and ~half low-sodium chicken stock, didn't add salt at the end (just made sure the salt shaker was out for my wife) and used 3 cloves of garlic in the beginning. So tasty.  I'm going to try it with Shitake mushrooms in the mix next.

This is a wonderful starter, clear mushroom soup for you to fiddle around with.  I actually made mine "creamy" by substituting the chicken broth with 1/3 homemade beef broth and 2/3 potato water (the water you boil your potatoes in) and puree everything before returning the pureed soup to the stove for a slow simmer.  Consistency of the soup is just what I'm looking in a creamy soup -- without the need for dairy or cornstarch.  Also, I halved the amount of mushroom in the recipe since I didn't have that much on hand, and the mushroom flavor is still very pronounced.  Can't wait to use this in the Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast recipe on this site!

In place of the brown or white button mushrooms I had obtained a selection of mushrooms from an Asian food market. I used oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, and brown beech mushrooms. I also didn't have any celery on hand so I had to leave that out. It turned out to be a great soup. Very tasty, low-fat, and great texture with the Asian mushrooms.

So good! I had green onions, but not regular/yellow, so I used garlic. The footnote of the recipe mentioned rice, so I used a little more chicken stock, and partway though simmering I added about 1/4 cup rice. With fresh ground pepper to finish, this is awesome!

I like to stick to the recipe the first time and then make changes.  So glad I did, this was so good and so easy.  I didn't have the "optional" leeks but hope next time to add them. I had organic chicken broth and for the mushrooms, I used 1/2lb baby bellas and 1-1/2lb white buttons. At the end I did use a hand mixer to smooth out about half of it. I thought this was very flavorful. Didn't even have to add the rice mix as noted in the footnotes as a possible addition.

This is a really good soup for beginners like me who are new to cooking. I used 3 beef bouillon cubes instead of chicken and added about a little less than a 1/2 a palm of celery salt(sub for the reg salt as I had no celery), and 3 cloves of garlic. This recipe is very versatile.

Great soup to enjoy on a cold evening with some type of rolls on the side. I added some cut up chicken breast, shirataki noodles, and one clove minced garlic and it was a hit with everyone in the family! Since I added some extras I cut back on the vegetables some, like no leeks (didn't have any at the store) and less celery and carrots.

This is really good soup.  I put chicken in it so I didn't have to use as much chicken stock, I just added a little more water.  I also put some barley and zucchini that I had to use up.  Very good!

This soup is AWESOME!!!  I didn't have leeks so I left those out. I added some red potatoes sliced thin. I also didn't have any celery...but, I did have dried celery flakes so I added that instead. I ended up using more butter than it called for because I added the potatoes. But, the end result....YUMMY! Thank you so much for this recipe. (All I did was Google mushroom soup and I picked this recipe....Good choice on my part!)

I think this is very nice change of pace from the cream soup type of soup.  I did add some wild rice to it, but it was fine without it.  This would be a nice soup course at a dinner party.  Hearty, yet not heavy.

A good soup especially for a cold day. I changed it up a little; but, I'd say this is a great base to create from. I used more carrots, celery, and mushrooms. I added cumin as well. Also, for a bit of heat I added slices of jalapeños.

Made this for a welcome to fall dinner. It was perfect uses great fall items!!! I used more celery/carrots/onions and replaced leeks with a little fresh sweet anise! Added a new yet subtle flavor and I also added garlic right before the mushrooms and pureed a little of the soup to thinken it.

This is surprisingly excellent, since there are very few spices. I didn't have thyme and totally forgot a bay leaf until the last minute. I tossed some mustard powder, black pepper, a little bit of salt, and a bay leaf in at the very end. Most of the flavor is from the wonderful sauteed mushrooms. (I've never understood just boiling them!) I used 1 lb Baby Bellas, 2/3 lb white sliced, and 1/2 oz. dried shiitake, rehydrated. I wish I'd chopped them up a bit more, but my husband loved it as is. Also added 1 cup cooked barley. Tasty!

"Oh my" this soup was very good. I used white, cremini and portobellos. Loved the texture of the mushrooms and it has a very earthy taste. Will definitely make it again.

I served this soup for the first time with the Crispy Cheese Twists from this site at a dinner party, and everyone agreed that it was really yummy. Since then, I have been making big bowls of it every Sunday and taking it to work for lunch and eating it for a snack. Thanks for such a great, healthy recipe!

This soup is great! I scaled it down to 4 servings and made it as is, though I didn't add the leeks. I did add a bit more mushrooms (for a more earthy taste) and used butter and herb wild rice. Fantastic!

Really enjoyed this soup.  I used a liquidizer to make it smooth.  I've tried a few other mushroom soups without cream and this is by far the best.

Great taste and simple to make. I didn't use exact measurements. I used 2 carrots, 2 stalks celery, one medium size onion, one leek, and 2 lbs. white cap mushrooms. Also made chicken broth from bouilion paste. Will make again. Thanks for the receipe

Made this soup with plenty of variation... Didn't have leeks so used red onions instead. Also didn't have carrots, so replaced them with colorabi. Didn't use thyme, either. Used portabella and forest mushrooms, not button. Came out GREAT! Served it with wild rice, as recommended. Was really wonderful, full of flavor like no other soup. Great for weight watchers who're looking fora light, cream-less mushroom soup.

My modifications included using spay butter to reduce the fat and added a ton of garlic.  The soup turned out fabulous and tasted similar to a French onion soup, but mushroom soup.

I really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again.  I took out a bit of the soup and using a stick blender, blended the soup till smooth then added it back to the remaining soup.  It added a bit of thickness and I enjoyed that.

At first, I was skeptical because there are so few ingredients and is very simple to make, but its an excellent soup recipe and very flavorful.  I was short on time so I used only leeks and onions (I doubled the amounts of each), used only 1 lb. of mushrooms and it was still very good.  Will definitely make again and will also try it with beef broth, french bread and cheese for a French onion soup variation.  Thanks!

A wonderful easy soup for a cold winter evening. I used a chopped onion instead of leeks, added chopped garlic, and used more of a chicken stock rather than a broth, but either would work.

This is delicious! 
Only change that I made was to add a bay leaf while simmering.
I didn't have the leeks and it was still great. I have also substituted olive oil for butter workout any problem. A truly delicious and extremely healthy lunch!

Great recipe! I’ve added dumplings to mine which made the recipe even more delicious. I also doubled up on mushrooms rather than using leeks and the food was still great!

I started by making this as written except for using mushroom stock instead of chicken stock, but I felt it was too thin at the end.  I thickened it just slightly with some cornstarch dissolved in water, then pureed some of it - added more salt and a few sprinkles of red pepper, and finally added about half a can of low fat evaporated milk.  With all those changes, it was pretty good, but I'm not sure this will be my go-to mushroom soup.

At the end of cooking, I took about half of the soup and blended it.  Then I added the other half back to the mix and it came out as a very nice creamy, but chunky soup.

Made it exactly as written, I even measured the ingredients (something of a miracle). I stopped by the mushroom farm and got a crate of portobellos but had no cream or  milk in the house. I found this recipe, took a chance on it since I had the ingredients on hand and it was GREAT! I wouldn't change a thing, This soup is hearty and flavorful without the cream. The rich and buttery mushroom essence comes through loud and clear.  I served it over pasta for the carbs. YUM.

The soup is very tasty. Made as is once and is great. Then I just make with whatever I have and eyeball everything. Still fantastic. What’s great is if you make a large batch as is, next day you can add kale or whatever else and it changes the soup’s texture and feels like a totally different soup! Made this a couple times and will continue.

I LOVE mushrooms and saw the reviews on this recipe was good, so I thought I'd try it out.

I looked at changes others have made - adding garlic when sautéing vegetables.  Also, added a bay leaf and parsley.

I made a lot more vegetables because I wanted to have leftovers for the next couple of days, also added the celery leaves.  But, I omitted the leeks and green onion.

I also used 4 cups of chicken bone broth, another 4 cups of low sodium chicken stock, and 2 cups of water because I added so much vegetables.

I toasted until lightly brown 1/2 cup of quinoa with butter, garlic, and onions, then added 1 cup of water and boiled until water was evaporated and added the quinoa as well.

My mom loves it too, she asked for the recipe :)

Simple ingredients combine to make a light but hearty soup. I took the advice of others and added garlic. I recommend doubling the carrots to add more color. I used homemade chicken stock.

I never make recipes exactly as they are, so keep that in mind as I tell you that this was DELICIOUS!

I used about 1.5 t dried Thyme with only 4 cups of vegetable broth.    

I added onion powder and a bay leaf but in retrospect, the additions may not have been necessary if I were more patient.  The flavor develops as the vegetables cook down.

I served it with sautéed chicken thighs and parmesan so guests could choose their own additions.

YUM!

I love this recipe. I cooked the carrots, celery, onion, and some garlic cloves a little longer than what the recipe calls for before adding the beef broth.  Overall this is healthy and delicious!

This soup was surprisingly delicious--the best broth-based mushroom soup I've made. Used lovage in place of celery, added a lot of  garlic, because we love garlic in everything.  The leeks gave it a lovely, subtle flavor; the carrots a burst of color.

I made it with baby bella mushrooms. Being single, I usually make half or less of a recipe I'm trying out. I wish I'd made the whole thing! Rich and savory. Will definitely be making it again.

I loved it but I halved the recipe and used just yellow onions since I had no leeks.  I also added 1/2 c white wine and used dry thyme (1tsp) and added chopped garlic (1tsp).  I took about 1/3 of the soup and pureed it in the blender to make it thicker.  Yum!!!

LOVED it. Hummed and hahed about including garlic, and am glad I didn't as this would have dominated the other subtle flavours. didn't have leek to hand so added a bit of red onion, and also added dried porcini and shitake powder just because I had them and treat them as an extra seasoning for many soups. AND (The squeamish can look away now) I added a good pinch of MSG, because I always do!

Have made the soup twice now and we love it.  Market had a variety pack of mushrooms which I used along with cimmini and white buttons.  Used the immersion blender for the creamier version.  Will definitely be making this again.  It tasted even better the second and third day.

Excellent!  Minor adjustments.  Added more carrots/leek/celery.  Scrapped corn of one ear and added it.  Added a little bit of white wine - maybe a quarter cup.  Added 1/4 cup whole wheat orzo pasta .Added a little more chicken broth.  Used dry thyme - less than what the recipe called for, and a little bit of fresh ground pepper.

The basis of the soup was pretty good, however I used only 4 cups of chicken stock. Instead of using leaks, I doubled the onions and put garlic powder in, and a few cloves of garlic. As you can tell I like garlic.  I also put multigrain quinoa for some starch, I thought it added a nice touch. For herbs, I add basil, oregano.  I am not a big salt person, so I thought the chicken stock was salty enough so I did not add anymore salt.  I hope this review helps someone, enjoy!!!

I thought I would be the only person eating the soup, so I made half the amount. My sister came by and loved the soup so much she took half of the soup with her. This soup is so good! I will be making this soup twice a month during the fall and winter months.

I had a 10-oz pkg of mushrooms that needed to be used, and I'm glad that I came across this recipe! I halved it and used vegetable broth. I didn't have leeks on hand but did add 1 cup of chopped cabbage. I also added about 1/4 cup of red wine and some garlic powder. I love the rich, earthy flavor of this. It would also work well with beef broth, dried mushrooms, worcestershire sauce and a little barley. I tried some yesterday when I made it, but today it definitely has a better flavor. I also added some chopped rotisserie chicken, and that works very well here. Thanks KitKat. This is a keeper of a recipe!

A fresh-tasting, light alternative to cream of mushroom soups;  thank you for posting this, KitKat.  The only change I made was to add a shake of garlic granules;  will definitely make it again!

I followed other's suggestions and pureed some of the soup to thicken it and added some garlic. I've made it twice and once added a bit of milk - both ways were tasty.

It needs a LOT more flavor. Used Hemp milk to give it a 'base' then added more onions, smoked sea salt & sweet paprika, smoked paprika and more.

Really great, easy, and healthy recipe. It was also very delicious. Followed all of the instructions as they were except I also added garlic and did not have any leeks. It was DELICIOUS!

Good healthy soup. I made it almost exactly as the recipe described, except I added 2 cloves of garlic and a bit of dijon mustard to give it a little kick. I would add more garlic next time and some wild rice or barley to give it more substance. Also I would use fresh thyme instead of dried thyme - I just didn't have any. The dried thyme is not really ideal for soup.

Used 8 ozs  less mushrooms and only 4 cups of low sodium chicken broth. Put in three shallots  instead of leeks. My wife and I loved it.

I was surprised how "meaty" the mushrooms made this soup. I added in a bit of leftover chicken sausage, but it really didn't need it.  Hubby loved it too!

This was amazing. I have been looking for a simple mushroom/vegetable soup without cream for a while. This one was easy and great. Everyone raved at the smell while cooking, and the taste. I can see using this as a base and adding other ingredients. Since this was my first time cooking this soup, I decided to follow the recipe. I wasn't super exact in the measurements, but pretty close. I did follow the cooking instructions. I did not add salt and pepper, and no one else eating it did either. It was perfect as written.

Two thumbs up!  I made this one evening to have for lunch as I work from home and I'm always looking for healthy lunch ideas.  This totally hit the spot.  Just a few things I did different which I don't think really changed the recipe all that much.  I halved the recipe since it was just for me.  I used one pound of the baby belles and used one dry shiitake soaked in about 1/2 cup of water.  I used the soaking water when I added the broth ( which I used homemade chicken stock).  The only other change is that I used dry thyme instead of fresh. Next time I think I will use two shiitakes.  I will for sure make this again and again as it makes for a great light healthy lunch.

I had really high hopes for this recipe based on the reviews and it smelled great when it was cooking, but the final product, as written (including option leeks) is bland. After being somewhat unhappy with the end product I made some modifications. Added more thyme, some garlic, 1/4 cup red wine and probably 1 tsp salt and at least 1/2 tsp of pepper. Salt and pepper "to taste" always leaves room for interpretation. Considering the chicken broth already in the recipe (used "Not So Chicken" broth cubes) there's a lot of salt in this particular pot of soup.  I wish I would have loved it like most others, but it wasn't meant to be.  I'll be sticking with pub-style chili, great northern bean soup and creamy vegan corn chowder recipes from this site as my go-to soups for the moment.

Wow thanks for the yummy recipe. Only thing I did differently was to add one clove of minced garlic when sautéing the onions. I also didn't have any leeks, so added a few extra onions. Delicious !!

It's a good base.  I think it needs a little something to add more flavor.  It was kinda bland to me.  Maybe garlic or something.

Not a huge fan of thyme. But a great addition is dill. I have made this several times and change it up some each time. I have added Potato, spinach, beef, wine you can pretty much add in whatever you want. I have added sour cream and milk also to switch it up sometimes. But dill is the major change I like.

When I first made this I was afraid I was going to be disappointed. Not so. I did make a couple of changes. One was to add a couple of cloves of garlic when cooking the vegies then I added 5 tbsp of wonder flour gravy mix to thicken it a bit. Awesome

Added the garlic as so many reviews suggested,  used some dried mushrooms along with the button and portobello ones and went with a veggie broth and olive oil instead of butter.  Also added a heaping tablespoon of organic miso paste. Garnished with grated parmesan reggiano.  Yummy in my tummy.

I wanted a recipe that didn't use cream and this one is fantastic!  I took some advice of other reviewers and added cabbage since I didn't have leeks on hand, increased the garlic to 5 cloves, added some red wine and used beef stock.  Delicious recipe that I will definitely use again!  Thanks!

I was so excited to try this (my first soup!), and while it turned out OK I was a little disappointed. Even for a mushroom fanatic like myself there were an awful lot of mushrooms. Yes, the recipe says how many, but it didn't click until I saw how skimpy the other veggies seemed in comparison. This recipe's true strength is as a template. Make it as-is one good time. Decide what you do/don't like about it. It will stand up to whatever revisions you make and can only improve.

I read many of the reviews and decided to use beef stock instead of chicken and omitted carrots. Great low carb soup, it was absolutely wonderful! I spent the day making different soups to freeze and this one didn't make it to the freezer! Yum!

I used this recipe as a base for a soup cooking experiment on a stormy day.

Changes I made:
- Skipped the butter, leeks and salt.
- Used low sodium chicken broth.
- Didn't measure any veggies...just chopped and tossed in three celery stalks, one large yellow onion, a bunch of carrots and mushrooms and about 1/2 of a green cabbage.
- Added a few shakes of garlic powder and pepper and 1/8 t of dried thyme.
- Added one box of Farmhouse long grain and wild rice (prepared in the microwave as directed then stirred in).
- Added one packet of onion soup mix.

I did garnish our bowls with green onions. My boyfriend added Sriracha for additional flavor.  We enjoyed our new tasty soup with French bread. :)

As written I would say it was four stars. It seemed a little bland. I added wild rice and to kick it up on the flavor, added worchestire sauce and some heavy red wine. I think would also use half beef broth next time. But we really enjoyed this and will make again

This soup was awesome!!  The only changes I made was I used beef broth instead of chicken.  I mixed in wild rice when I served it.  I would make this for company.

a great recipe, but i found that by adding a table spoon of flour to vegetables it thickens the soup nicely also i used a lamb stock and found that this gave it a stronger flavour

I didn't have leeks, used dried thyme instead of fresh, and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to keep it vegetarian. I also simmered 1/4 cup of brown rice in the soup as it cooked, rather than the wild rice addition (although that sounds good too!) to make it just a little thicker.

This smelled so wonderful as it was simmering, but unfortunately it didn't taste quite as good. The only changes I made were to use veg broth and omit the celery. Strangely, it didn't taste as mushroomy as I'd hoped. I'm not going to give up, though--next time, I'll add some shiitakes (I used all baby bellas this time), and I'll take another reviewer's suggestion and add rosemary and garlic.

This soup is fantastic! And because it has no cream, it's healthy and it freezes well. I add garlic, fresh parsley, and fresh rosemary, but skip the leeks. During the last 10 minutes of cooking time, I add a little flour to thicken it. When serving at a dinner party, I puree it and serve it with a sprinkle of crispy bacon on top.

Very good.  I used a mix of white, crimini, and shitake  mushrooms.  I also added a tablespoon of sugar to the soup.

This recipe didn't work. The vegetables were hard and needed longer cooking. I waited to see if it was better the next day, but I am disappointed.

I made this with an 8oz package of mixed gourmet mushrooms. The soup was pretty good, but I must admit I would have preferred it with some cream. Thanks, KitKat!

I guess I must be the oddball here, because my husband & I did not care for this soup. It has everything we love in it, & sounded good, but didn't taste good. Usually soup gets better after it sits overnight in the fridge but it tasted worse! Sorry!

I'll make it again, but I had hoped that by puree it, it would have a smooth consistentcy, and it really didn't.

Delicious and simple, not to mention pretty! Great presentation. I only used half the mushrooms because that was all I had, and it was still plenty chunky - I don't really think it needs a full 2 lbs. Anyway, we loved it.

Delightful,light but filling soup. Made this for lunch for my parents and paired it with Springtime Ham and Spinach Salad recipe from this site. May also add some fresh asparagus chopped next time.
