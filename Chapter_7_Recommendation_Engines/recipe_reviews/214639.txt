OMG! I loved this recipe. I made some revisions. I used jerk paste instead of curry paste and regular vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar. I had to stop myself from eating because I ate kind of late and the dish has rice. I love the cilantro, mango, and jerk flavor! Sooo...good. Try and you won't regret it.

This was delicious as is but with a few tweaks could be a 5 star recipe. The flavor and texture were very comforting but I would have like a greater punch of flavor so next time I will up the amount of curry paste and vinegar I put in. Salt the chicken before you put it in. I would also mix the curry paste mixture into the rice before I put the chicken in - very hard to distribute the flavors afterwards. I was surprised that the mango wasn't as mangoey as I thought it would be but instead mellowed out and combined with the rice to be like a sticky rice. Maybe jarred mango would actually be better to maintain the flavor. Thank you for a great recipe!

My whole family loved this recipe!  The combination of fresh ingredients were fragrant and delicious.  I couldn't find tarragon vinegar and didn't have time to make it so I substituted white wine vinegar and chopped fresh tarragon.  I also used brown rice so I boiled the water before adding it to the baking pan.  The chicken was a bit overdone so next time I will parboil the brown rice and bake the dish for 45 minutes instead of an hour.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe Nicole!

I made this dish exactly as state in the recipe. The flavors in this dish are really great which is why I am giving it 3 stars, however, there are lots of changes I would make next time.  I feel 1/2 cup rice is not enough. I would up that to 1 cup for sure and leave the water alone so it doesn't turn out so runny. There was way too much liquid.  I would also add the cilantro after it is cooked - all the flavor is cooked out by adding it before baking. I would probably add extra mango as well. And when searing the chicken thighs - I would not use so much oil! You will render fat from the chicken - there is no need to add more. I would slap it in the dry pan and sear it nicely to lock in flavors. If I try this recipe again with my changes I will edit and update.

This dish is a wonderful blend of taste!  I would like to add a bit more curry paste for a bit more of a kick and some tarragon too.  Easy & delicious just as it is though - thanks for sharing!

Flavorful and fragrant. I used chicken breasts imstead of thighs, and had to cook it on the stovetop when my son forgot to put it in the oven :-) But it was still a huge hit. Will definitely make it again.

made the whole block smell good, though the chicken was a bit dry after being both sauteed & baked.

Wow, this was flavorful! The cilantro was bold, the mango was sweet, and overall, it was just fantastic.
I will confess I did not use green onions or rice (just baked the chicken in the mixture), but I felt the need to lick the plate after!

My husband and I made this last night.  It was a very tasty combination and the chicken was moist.  My husband thought there was a bit too much cilantro for him (I thought it was fine though!), so next time I might increase the mango a little and decrease the cilantro a little.

After reading all the reviews I tripled the curry paste and added a bit more rice.  The result was bland chicken and mostly bland and mushy rice.  Sounded great, but just didn't work for us

Great combination of flavours, just a little bland... next time I will add salt or fish sauce to bring out the flavour of the red curry paste. Thanks though- it was a fun new recipe & I look forward to trying it again with my "tweaks".
