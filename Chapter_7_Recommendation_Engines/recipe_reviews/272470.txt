Five stars if done the follow way.

With smoking a chicken using a pellet grill you've got to pick if you want heavier smoke flavor or crispy skin. It is almost impossible to get both. 

Some folks will smoke at 225 for a while (45 minutes.) and then turn up the smoker to 375 (The last 15 minutes.) to finish for a crispy skin. I like a dry brine (AKA: Rub only.) chicken smoked at 325 or 350 the whole way. Use a Thermopop to test doneness.

Here's another twist. How about smoked fried chicken? Smoke it first, then flour it and fry it
