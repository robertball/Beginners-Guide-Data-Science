As far as I'm concerned, this is the perfect basic chili recipe. I made it with a few minor variations and I was very pleased with the results. I cooked it on the stovetop because I was getting a late start on dinner last night. At first I thought it didn't have enough juice, but after I cooked it on low (with the lid on) for about an hour it was perfect. Aside from cutting up the onions (always a pain), it was super easy to make. I used Rotel tomatoes because that was what I had in the pantry. That worked OK, but I think it would have been just as great without the added kick. I served it with Fritos, cheese and sour cream, and I can't wait to have it again for lunch. This will definitely be my standard chili recipe. I've already added it to my recipe box.

First, I have to admit that I changed somethings about this recipe.  Not the least of which was the ground beef.  We do not eat red meat, so I made this with ground turkey.  When I browned the turkey, I added cumin and garlic salt - as some had suggested the flavor was bland.  I did not have any greeen peppers, but I did have the diced tomatoes & green pepper canned so I used that.  I also used a chili ready tomato sauce which had added seasonings.  To give it a flavor boost, I added about a half teaspoon of crushed red pepper.   The end result was pretty good.  However, it seemed a little bit dry.  The recipe called for one 8 oz can of tomato sauce and I used about 2/3 of a 15oz can.  Next time I will use the whole can. 
One other somewhat important aspect was that the mixture filled my crockpot to the top and I had a tough time blending it all in because it was so full.  It would probably be easier to mix it in something first and then add to the crock pot.  Just a thought.

This is a great basic chili recipe! I made some adjustments based on our own tastes and I have made this chili 6 times with the following: 2 pkgs (lb each of Laura’s Lean Beef Brand-Ground Sirloin)-great brand to use since they don’t give their cattle added growth hormones, etc.  I use this brand a lot for ground turkey breast, etc. 3 cans of Bush’s Dark Red Kidney Beans instead of 2 cans, this made it very hearty 1 -14.5 oz can of Del Monte Diced Tomatoes (Zesty Chili Style) 1-14.5 oz. can of Del Monte Diced Tomatoes-(regular) 1- 8 oz. can of Del Monte tomato sauce We are really not into having too many onions in anything so I used a chopper to chop only 1 medium onion and then used 3 fresh cloves of minced garlic to brown the meat with.  While browning the meat I then sprinkled some black pepper, crushed red pepper and a little garlic salt.   We like garlic so I added about 2 more cloves minced into the pot after transferring the browned meat.   I then followed the directions of this recipe with the chopped green pepper,chili powder, salt, etc. I have made this chili in my slow cooker (for 4 hours on high) and also on the stove top (1 ½ hours on low) with the same results.  Fantastic! I served it with some shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top of each bowl.   I think everyone will adjust making this to their own likes/dislikes.  I also have young nieces and nephews so sometimes I can’t put the crushed red pepper or make stuff too spicy. Thanks for this easy and great recipe!

I made only a few minor modifcations to this recipe. I added corn and green chilis. For the tomato sauce, I used a spicy basil marinara. The chili was fantastic...very easy recipe. The house smelled terrific. Great with some green chili cheese cornbread.

Outstanding.  Very flavorful.  I added a tablespoon of cumin to the recipe, but I don't think it really needs anything else.  Yum.

Tasty! I used almost three pounds of ground beef, no green pepper (didn't have one)and no canned diced tomato (we don't care for tomato chunks in chili). And it still turned out good! I didn't have any tomato sauce either so I used two 6 oz cans of tomato paste mixed with two cans of water and that did the trick! And I only used half of a large onion instead of two medium onions. There were no leftovers, which leaves me singing the praises of this dish! :)

First time using slow cooker & making chili... very easy.  Added cumin, red pepper flakes and a little more salt & pepper because it seemed to lack some zip.  Once spices were added it was great!  My boyfriend and his coworkers loved it!

**I have to make a correction to this review I posted a while ago:  I used BRANDT GROUND BEEF, not Angus beef.  It's 100% natural and I found it at my local Thriftway grocery store.  It's really tender and  flavorfull.***

This chili is really good!  I set my Crock Pot on high for 4 hours and after a looksee at 3 hours, I was skeptical.  The "sauce" part of the chili looked thin and watery.  I had cut the recipe in half but used 8 oz of tomato sauce.  At this point I added about 1/4 cup of Ragu sauce just to thicken it a bit.  One hour later, it turned out great.  It wasn't dry as other reviewers claimed.  I also used Angus ground beef and I feel it made a huge difference.  The meat is more tender and flavorful then "regular" ground beef.

Excellent and easy. I use Pato tomato sauce instead of tomato sauce for an extra kick. I also use 1 can of pinto beans instead of kidney.

I followed the recipe exactly (in the crockpot on high for 4 hours) and it came out delicious!  It had just the right amount of liquid and spiciness.  I served it by the bowlful with a fresh loaf of italian bread.

For me, this is the basic chili recipe.  All of these ingredients need to be present and you can always tweak it and adjust the spices, salt and pepper to your taste.  Now if you want to add corn, chilies or anything else, thats OK, too.  I make this on the stove all the time.  Just brown the meat with the veggies and garlic.  Drain and add everything else, except the cheese and cook on low for about an hour. It'll be just fine on the stove in a nice stock pot.  When I first saw the recipe I thought someone had been looking in my recipe file and stole my recipe for chili.  This is exactly how I've made chili for more than 40 years.  You can make changes if you like, but it's great just like it is.  I add about a tablespoon of white vinegar and about 2 teaspoons of sugar, as well.  I love the way it gives the chili a little twang. Try making a paste out of 2 tablespoons of yellow cornmeal and water.  Add it to the chili right before you serve it.  It'll thicken it nicely and gives it an authentic Mexican flavor.   Also, if you like, boil a little macaroni and add separate for chili mac.  I always have the macaroni on the side so people can add it, if they care to.  I like green onions cut up on top, too. You can get a fresh loaf of french bread for dipping, too.  Delicious!

Ok, I changed alot of stuff but this recipe was THE BEST chili recipe I have ever had. I made it vegetarian by using black bean burgers as the meat base. I added a can of pinto beans and black beans. I only used one can of kidney beans and one can of diced tomatoes. I added one more Tbl of chili powder, 1/2 Tbl of cumin, dashes or paprika, oregano, garlic and onion powder and 2 Tbl worcestershire sauce. I then added enough water to my desired thickness and simmered on the stovetop for 2 hours. Thank you so much for a recipe that was a good base but that I could also change and make it my own. AWESOME!!!

Great recipe!  there were a few changes I made:  I used 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground turkey, I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chillies, a red bell pepper instead of green, and added 2 tblsp vinegar, and 1/8 tsp cayenne and onion powder.  It was amazing!!  I left it to cook on low for 10 hours in the crock pot and served it over apple sticky rice in bowls!  My husband was so impressed and cant wait for me to make more!!

It's a perfectly good basic chili recipe.  I make my chili in a similar fashion.  I don't make quite this much though. I use only 1 pound of ground beef and 1 can of kidney beans that are drained and rinsed.  This time I used diced tomatoes that I pureed with my hand blender.  My husband doesn't like tomato chunks.  I also used a can of tomato paste.  I used an entire head of garlic as well.  I fried the ground beef, onions and garlic in the frying pan and dumped them into the slow cooker with the other stuff.  I just sort of dump chili powder in, I don't measure.  I've probably used 3 or 4T of it though.  And I didn't use green pepper.   It makes for tasty chili!!

This is a fantastic chili!  I am used to making a 'cook-off' style chili that requires four different "drops" and takes a good 5 hours on the stove (babysitting the pot).  This slow-cooker chili is every bit as good as the drop-style chili and serves as a terrific base recipe for folks to add their own personal twists to.  I created this chili using extra-lean ground beef, 1 can of Busch's Spicy Chili Beans (medium heat), 1 can of Busch's seasoned black beans, 2 Tablespoons of red chili powder, 2 Tablespoons of Mexene chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and 1 tsp of cumin.  Absolutely fantastic outcome and highly recommended!  Enjoy!

I use 1 small can of tomato paste, and add black beans and pinto.Fresh cilantro, and teaspoon of Cumin powder. I add beans towards last hour, because they can get mushy from overcooking for that long!

I wish I could give this more stars. We don't use meat so I used vegetarian crumbles. I made it twice in one week, and already have requests to make it again. The meat eaters never knew the difference! :)

Great chili recipe!  I followed some other suggestions-added more chili powder and cumin-eliminated the green pepper.  Definately personal preferences.  As a base-it was an excellent starting point.  I made this as a pre-Christmas dinner appetizer and my guests said that  the chili was all they needed!  Will definately make again!

This a great basic chili recipe ..add extra chili powder if you want more kick and since I don't eat red meat anymore so I use ground chicken my kids love it and so do their friends.

I haven't made beef chili but a few times, but this recipe will be the one I continue to use. The only changes I made was I only used one onion, added an extra clove of garlic, cumin, and some extra tomato sauce. Was great, my entire family loved it.

This was a GREAT Chili recipe!. i only gave it 4 stars, because i felt it needed alot more spices...so i just modified to my own taste. otherwise it is a great starter chili. the changes i made was i skipped the tomato sauce, and added 1 can of tomato paste instead. i also added 1 jalepeno, and more garlic. about 1 hour before serving i added some frozen corn. i cooked on high for about 3 hours!

really enjoyed this dish. chili is my 4yo's favorite dinner, and she really liked this. too many beans for her and my husband, but overall a great dish. made with ground chicken the first time, but not as good. much better wtih gr. beef. used 2 tbsp tomato paste instead of sauce, added 1/2 tsp cumin and rotel for the tomatoes.

An instant family classic! I have made this several times now, on the stovetop simmering for an hour. I do cook the pepper and onion in olive oil before browning the meat and add cumin, otherwise I follow to a t.

Excellent recipe! I followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers and 7 other people loved this recipe! I added 1 tsp ceyenne pepper, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 extra tbsp chili powder, garlic salt instead of plain salt, green chilies and used 2 cans of tomato sauce and 1 can of water instead of diced tomatoes.  My husband said he definitely wants this again!

This is recipe is great. I made a few of the following modifications and everyone went back for seconds (some even thirds!).

I followed the recipe pretty much as is with a few additions and some substitutions.

Added:
1). 1 can of black beans, 2). 1 TBSP of Cumin, 3). 1/2 - 1 Tsp of fresh ground Chipotle Chili Seasoning (comes in a bottle with a grinder), 4). 1 can of Mild Diced Green Chilies, 5). 2 crushed cloves of fresh Garlic (through a press), 6). 1/2 can of Tomato Paste to thicken in the last hr.

Substitutions:
1). Replaced regular Diced Tomoatoes with Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes for flavor (brand - Muir Glen Organic), 2).
Replaced regular salt with Garlic Salt, 3). "No Salt added" Tomato Sauce by Muir Glen Organic. (I watch the salt in recipes quite a bit as I have family members with high blood pressure).

Omitted:
1). Green bell pepper.

Topped each bowl off with some grated Smoked Cheddar Cheese, Lt. Sour Cream, Diced Black Olives. 

Everyone commented that the Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes and the Smoked Cheddar on top gave it such great flavor. It had a slight kick. Just enough to be an authentic chili dish. My hubby forgot shredded cheddar at the store and all I had in the frig was a block of Tillamook Smoked Cheddar.

My mom isn't big on spicy chili or a lot of beans so this is perfect for us.  I used ground pork today since it was on sale and it came out as delicious as usual.

Excellent Chili! I revised a little. I added about a tbsp and a half each of the following: cumin, freshly ground pepper, and chili powder. I also used Walla Walla sweet onions instead of regular onions, substituted one of the cans of kidney beans for Bush's baked beans for a little sweetness, added a can of niblet corn, and used a larger can of tomato sauce. (prob 12 oz). So yummmmmmmmy! My husband loved it as well so I froze half of it for another time and we ate the rest for dinner with cornbread. Definitely making again!

Fantastic recipe, very tasty.  I made one small adjustment, only because I like spice - I substituted 3 small jalapenos instead of the 1 green pepper.  It wasn't overly hot but gave it a bit of a kick.  Will definitely make again!

Substituted ground chicken for ground beef and added red peppers. Made a good, hearty chili without having to scoop lots of fat off the top! Recommend - quick and easy.

This is my favorite chili recipe with one tiny change. I'm a vegetarian, so I omit the meat and double the beans - a can of kidney and a can of black works well. I like halving the recipe and cooking it in my little crockpot - I get three or four meals out of it that way. Great over pasta. The flavors are perfect.

Yum! We love this as a starter chili! The only thing we add is chopped green chilies,corn,red pepper flakes, and we use black beans. 

It's yummy with a dash of hot sauce with corn bread and cheese!

This was the first time I have ever made Chili, and I had my in-laws over!!!  I was searching for a good recipe to impress them with and I think I did all because of this delicious recipe! It truly is the best!  I did add 1 more TBS of Chili Powder and 1 TBS of Cumin like many of the other reviews suggested, it was a hit! Can't wait to eat our left overs tonight! Thank you!

This recipe seems like a good start as-written (too dry, though?), and it is easy to alter to suit your taste. I like a lot going on in my chili, and so I added the following: 1 bottle of beer, 1 large chipotle, cumin, oregano, 2 Tbsp tomato paste, lots more garlic, and some frozen corn at the end of cooking. I added a second can of tomato sauce, which may not have been necessary. I used only 1 large onion. I cooked it for 8 hours on low and served the chili with cheese, green onions, cilantro and sour cream on top. Would have included tortilla chips, but I caught the hubby finishing off the bag earlier that day - oops. Anyway, we ate seconds of the chili, and there is still plenty left to freeze. I usually reduce the number of stars when I alter a recipe so much but not this time because it is a good basic. I will make again with changes - yum!!

Super easy to put together and VERY satisfying... I left the cayenne out because my 3-year-old rejects anything spicy, and it became a really family friendly dish.  Very hearty and lots of protein!

I had cooked up a few pounds of kidnew beans and frozen them a few weeks ago.  I also cook up ground turkey w/ onions after I purchase it for future use.  I decided to make chili and found this recipe.  It was easy & delicious, especially b/c the beans and ground turkey were already ready for use.

Very tasty!! I made minor changes, hardly worth mentioning. I only used one onion (purple) because that's all I had. I used one can of dark red kidney beans and one can of pintos, and added a can of green chili peppers. Will make this again for sure.

Easy & Delisious! Great for busy people. I cut the recipe in half and it works great. I leave the green pepper out because i don't like spicy. I also add 1 cup water (if cooking it longer than 2 hours), 1 can of drained corn, & some cumin. I like to mix in cheddar cheese, sour cream, & fritos in my serving bowls.

Excellent-my husband loved it!  I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I substituted one can of black beans (for one of the cans of kidney beans) and one can of Rotel (for one of the cans of tomatoes.  I used deer hamburger meat browned in Tony's (since we have a deep freeze full) and also added one teaspoon of cummin to the mixture.  I used green and red bell peppers.  I followed the recipe for everything else, and it is by far the best one I have for chili.  Thanks!

This is by far the best chili I've EVER made/had! I followed the recipe exactly. Kindof. I used what I had on hand in the house. Instead of a green pepper, I used an orange pepper. I had 2 cans of diced tomatoes but they had green chilies added to them(they gave GREAT flavor!) and I had i can Bush's kidney beans and 1 can of Bush's chili beans. All I can say is WOW. Really the only thing I actually changed is when I browned the ground beef I cooked it with the 2 cloves garlic AND added 2 more cloves to the pot with the other ingredients. This chili had the BEST flavor, the PERFECT spice, and everyone raved about it. I'm not sure how this is a "basic" chili recipe as other reviewers have stated. I wouldn't add a thing! Chili should be simple. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I call this "can't screw up" chili! I didn't have some of the ingredients - I used pork sausages (browned & cut up) yellow pepper, frozen tomatoes, tomato paste. Instead of chili powder used cumin, paprika and crushed red pepper flakes. Came out great!

This is a great basic chili that is definitely fun to tweak! I myself did the following changes:  Before I cooked the meat, I drizzled some olive oil in a pan and lightly sauteed some garlic. Once the garlic was cooked and infused its favor in the oil, I added the meat and added salt and garlic powder. When the meat was cooked, I added some store bought finely diced jalapenos (for a bit extra heat!). I added the other ingredients but added some more salt and chili powder than the recipe calls. I also added some regular hot wing sauce,  it gives the chili some heat and an added flavor. My boyfriend loved this chili! Definitely start with the basics and make it your own!

Best chili I have ever eaten.  My boyfriend also raves about it every time I make it and I have made it quite a few times now  I modified the receipe a little bit by using Bush's chili beans instead of kidney beans (undrained), a can of rotel either regular or hot depending on how much of a kick I want to add to it and one can of regular dicked tomatoes (undrained), only one onion, a teaspoon of cummin and and an extra tablespoon of chili powder and it turns out absolutely fantastic!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent base recipe- however, I did alter it quite a bit to make it a full 5 stars. First, I substituted 2 pounds of lean, ground turkey in place of the ground beef. I browned the meat and added the onions, salt, pepper and garlic to the meat for about 2 minutes for the flavors to meet. I then transferred it to the slow-cooker along with the other ingredients. There's no need to drain, because the meat is so lean, and the juices add wonderful flavor to the chili. I reduced the salt by one tsp, used one can of diced tomatoes with zesty chiles (because we like things with a bit of a kick) and one can of diced tomatoes with green pepper and onion. I also added one tsp of cumin, and diced two celery stalks and added it to the rest of the ingredients. I cooked it on low for about 6 hours. Truly the best chili I have ever made. Everyone was begging for seconds!!

This was excellent, of course with own twists it was even better. I added some cumin, a little bit more salt and pepper. 2 more cloves of garlic and a tad bit more chili powder.

This is the perfect-for-everyone chili. We have quite a few sports parties and always serve this chili. Everyone comes back for seconds. Served with some good crusty buns it makes for a delicious meal. Not too spicy, which is nice when cooking for people with various tastes.

I made this 3 days ago and I'm still eating it...it makes a LOT of chili.  It tastes even better as the days go by.  The only changes I made to the recipe were to add an extra tablespoon of chili powder, and a box of frozen corn the last hour.  Excellent recipe!

This was indeed a good starter chili recipe. I used flank steak cut into small cubes instead of ground beef, but otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe as written. It was mild, which was great for me, but my son prefers a little more kick and added some hot sauce to his bowl. After reading other reviews saying it was a little watery, I did drain one can of the tomatoes, and took the lid off the cooker for the last 30  minutes, which helped - it would have been too thin for my taste if I hadn't. All in all, a nice mild chili to "play with". Will definitely use this recipe again!

This was very good... I like my chili with thin broth, like they do it at Wendy's... and this was very tasty.  I used Rotel since I didnt have any green peppers, and it was plenty spicy.

This is my favorite kind of Allrecipes recipe: One that is solid as-is, but ripe for variations. Prepared as written, it's not "too" anything -- salty, spicy, etc. --leaving room to add according to one's preference,  and the flavors balance well.  The proportions of the recipe also lend themselves well to making a half batch.

I only gave 4 stars, because I had to add more seasoning to make it 5 stars. I tasted it halfway through (I cooked for 4 hours on higher temp), and thought it tasted a bit bland. I added extra salt, cumin, coriander, mexican oregano, cayenne, a little beef bouillon, and a large bay leaf. Also, I used one can of diced tomatoes with chiles in place of one of the cans of regular diced tomatoes. The end result was awesome! It was good enough that I totally forgot to put the cheese on it when I served it, and nobody said a thing about the cheese missing. I served it with cornbread and honey butter. About the too dry versus too watery thing... at first I thought it looked way too thick and added some extra water. As the vegetables cooked, they released enough water that soon it was too watery. I left the lid off for a while to let it cook down a little and it was perfect. So either way, it's a problem easily fixed. It most likely would have been perfect had I not added the water, although I'm sure it's much up to personal preference.

This is a great recipe.  I cut the amount in half for the meat, and use 2-3 onions, and at least 4 cloves of garlic, and also a whole green pepper.  Comes out with a lot of flavor.

Very easy and very good! Had plans for crockpot but got a call that family member had been in minor accident just as I was cooking meat. So by the time everything was cleared up and I was home again, I just made it on the stove. I added the cumin as suggested for little extra flavor. Appreciated that it was not spicy. Did need some more juice so I'll be using the larger can of sauce next time. Oh, and I used ground turkey!

I made this for the first time yesterday and took it to work for my co-workers. I made TWO big pots and they devoured them both. Everyone raved about how good it was. The only change I  made was I added a jar of HOT picante sauce to one pot. And a jar of MEDIUM picante sauce and a can of drained whole kernel corn to the other pot. Excellent recipe. Thanks.

EXCELLENT chili! Easy prep, very flavorful. I sprinkled black peppercorn on the ground beef while browning, also added 1 tsp worcestershire for added flavor to the meat. For crockpot, skipped the kidney beans altogether. Used 4 fresh garlic cloves (chopped) and added 1/4 tsp cayenne. Used canned diced tomatoes that had mild green chile in them. Didn't have tomato sauce so used Classico sausage pepper & onion spaghetti sauce. I insist this helped with kick and flavor! Cooked on high for 4 hours. Topped with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. Served with Fritos. FH wasn't hungry when the meal was ready but devoured it when it was served. He is picky about his chili and absolutely loved this, as did I. Thanks for the recipe! It is a keeper!

Great recipe, would not change a thing, only to help you out a little, try using frozen chopped onions and peppers, it is soo much easier and faster, and nobody even notices that they are frozen.

Great basic recipe, but it's missing something!  I made this for my family and I added the cumin like other reviewers suggested but it was still missing something, what, I'm not sure!  I added a half of a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to give it some kick even though we're not ones for spicy foods.  Next time I'm going to put a tablespoon or two of tomato paste in it to try to round out the flavor a little bit more.  I did not find it to be dry at all like other reviewers.

The recipe needed just a little bit more flavor, so I added some jalapenos. Otherwise, the chili turned out really great and was so easy.

Absolutely delicious! I cut everything in half because I didn't need so many servings. However, I did use a whole can of tomato sauce because it looked dry. In the end it turned out perfect. Can't wait to make this again.

This is an awesome chili recipe! I used Fresh anaheim peppers, and jalepenos. 3 of each  I roasted them first before putting them in. I skinned and seeded them  and chopped then up. I also added about a tablespoon of cumin. I cooked it on high for 4 hours, and low for 2. It came out amazing! My boyfriend still asks me to make it all the time!

My husband is always asking me to make this chili. It's the only chili recipe I've ever attempted and I don't need to look any further. It's the best. I don't change the recipe much at all, just to suit my taste. I only use 1 onion and I add a can of black beans. I also add an extra green pepper. It's so simple and smells soooo good while it's cooking. Great recipe :)

I only changed using black beans instead of 2 cans of red kidney (so 1 and 1).  I used turkey instead of beef.  I used a bit of red pepper flakes.  I didn't use a green pepper or onions as I'm not a fan of onion.  

Based on that, everything else was followed and this was great! I make meals for myself and this scored 7-8 meals for me.  This demands cheese but a cheese stick suffices.

This recipe was great!  I made the following changes: I used pinto beans instead of kidney-- they worked much better texture wise.  I didn't use the pepper, and only used 1 onion.  It is very bland, so I used a LOT of chipotle seasoning plus cumin, plus extra chili powder.  Still, it was delicious, and it's a great base recipe.

I made this recipe for a chili cook off at work and got 1st place.  People didn't believe me when I told them I only found the recipe online two days before the contest! I added Jalapeños because I like spicey food and some cumin because other reviews suggested it. Love the recipe and will make it again for future chili cook offs and for cold winter days.

This was a decent recipe.  Not something I would serve to guests or take as a potluck item.  I added more spices as it was quite bland.  My husband commented that it was too tomato-ey. Better the next day.  Will keep looking for a better chili recipe.

I did NOT enjoy this chili. It lacked flavor. I added a few ingredients (per our personal preference) and we were still disappointed. My husband said it had too much garlic; and too much onion. I used 1 medium onion and added Del Monte chili style canned tomatoes, added jalapeño's and 3 tbs of chili powder. :( Very disappointed. I will continue looking for a crockpot chili recipe.

Very easy recipe and was perfect for an office pot luck.Very easy to adjust for taste; I eliminated the green pepper and added a can of diced tomoates with mild green chilis, added a tsp of brown sugar and a bay leaf and only used 2 1/2 onions. I  increased the qty to 16 servings. Yum!

I made this for a potluck and it's very good for those that don't like spice but I prefer mine more spicy.  Next time I'll add some cayenne and maybe some jalapenos as well.

So yummy, warm, and cozy on a cold night.  I am don't eat dairy right now, so no cheese or sour cream and it is still fantastic! It has just the right spicy kick to it.  Love it!  SO easy, too!  

I used ground turkey instead of beef and one can of dark kidney beans and one can of light kidney beans.

The seasoning is way off in this recipe. 2 pounds of meat and only 2 tsp salt? I always watch my salt and compensate with other seasonings but this definitely needed twice or 3 times the salt. I also used a lot more chili powder and cumin because without the additional seasonings this chili would be extremely bland.  I even added jalapenos, a small cayenne pepper and green and red peppers for flavor and still, I had to keep adding spices.  This recipe is very base (use it and add on it like I did) and bland and for someone who does not like flavor.

This is a wonderful basic chili recipe. I altered the recipe slightly to suit my tastes and it was delicious! I substituted Rotel for the diced tomatoes to add a bit more flavor and spice. I omitted the green pepper simply because I don't care for it. I doubled the garlic and added about 4 teaspoons of freshly ground cumin. I also added 1 can of water on top of the tomato sauce because it looked a little dry. I served with sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream and cornbread. Very quick and easy to throw together and wonderful to come home to at the end of the day!

Made as directed, found it good but a bit bland.  Needs more spices and some heat.

Delicious! My changes: 2 cans whole tomatoes instead of diced, 1.5 lbs hamburg instead of 2 and 3 tbsp chili powder. I'd think I'd add even more chili powder next time.

I personally do not eat chili but I made it for my husband. He absolutely loved this chili. I added a jalapeno, and a pablano to kick up the heat. He loves spicy food.

I cut the recipe in half and followed it exactly from there.  It made a fabulous meal, topped with a little grated cheddar.  Of course it was even better the next day!

Used one lb of hamburger and 1 lb ground hot sausage substituted 1 can of chili beans for the 2nd can of kidney beans and added another can of tomato sauce.  The substitutions were as a result of what  I had on hand nonetheless the chili turned out terrific. Cooked 8 hours on low.

Great starting point.  I left out the green pepper and added some ground cumin (2 tsp) as I saw suggested in some other reviews.  Think I will add a little more heat to it next time too.  Overall though very happy with the basic recipe.  Easy & tasty

This chili is money as is and I have cooked it several times. With that being said I double the recipe and use 2 lbs of ground beef and 2 lbs of stew meat. Another suggestion is after you brown ground beef, add onion and continue cooking till onions are clear but not browned, then drain and add to cooker. Then brown stew meat, add to hot pan and sear, you want to seal in the juices from the meat and add. Before you make, you will need a 6 or 7 QT slow cooker to fit it all. This recipe is great the way it is written...These are simply things I have added and my friends and family go crazy for. Thank you Sue for this great and simple recipe !!

I followed this recipe exactly only without the kidney beans (because i didn't have any) I have to say it did not take on a chili flavor to me, it tasted somewhat like a sloppy joe or meatloaf. Maybe the beans are what makes the chili great. I will be looking for a better base chili recipe. =(

This is good. I give it 5 starts for easiness. I added cumin and since I didn't have tomato sauce I used tomato paste thinned with water. I used a can of mexican beans, only 1 tsp of chili powder and brown sugar. Very nice.

Incredibly boring and bland. I don't know why so many people are impressed with it. I'd eat it on hot dogs, but it's not good enough to eat on it's own. After first following the recipe, I had to add a bunch of stuff to it to save it.

This is a perfect basic chili recipe and very easy to make!! I made it for my in-laws and everyone loved it! I added an additional can of 8oz tomato sauce, a little extra garlic, and only one onion. After mixing all ingredients together, I was concerned that it seemed a little dry, so I added some V8 juice (that's all I had to use) until I got the consistency I wanted. Next time I think I will add some jalapenos for some heat.

This has become a favorite recipe in our house, with a few important modifications:      * 3 tablespoons chili powder (instead of 2)      * 1 tablespoon salt (instead of 2 teaspoons)      * Add 1 tablespoon Cumin      * Add 1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes (this gives it just a little kick that was missing in the original recipe)      * Add 1/2 teaspoon sugar    I also like using red peppers instead of green, but I think it's good either way.

This was an excellent recipe. The only thing I changed was to add a couple of TB. of brown sugar to give the tomato less of an acidic taste. Thanks!

I got a similar recipe from Taste of Home and it was very good I think this may be the same thing but the one I used had modifications that made it awesome, it also served 16 and the changes are...  instead of just 2 cans of beans 2 cans dark kidney beans 2 cans light kidney beans  instead of tomato sauce  a 14 oz jar of pizza sauce or almost similar size  only one medium onion  instead of green pepper use a 4 oz can of green chilis  instead of 2 TBSP chili use 4 TBSP chili.   Cook in the crockpot for 6 hours after onions,, garlic, and meat have been finished and put with all of the other ingrediants in the crockpot

LOVE this chili. My kids LOVE this Chili as does my hubby and the babysitter. lol. Only thing I did different was add 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground sausage as that is what we had on hand. I have made this twice now and it is soo easy and sooo good. Not too spicy. Also leaves it open for you to add other ingredients to your liking. Thank you for a great recipe!!

Like others said, this is a good basic chili recipe. I made a few changes and the results were amazing! I made half the servings since my slow cooker is smaller. I  added a couple serranos, about a teaspoon of cumin, I also didn't drain the beans, added chicken boullin, and I put in the entire can of tomato sauce (2 if you're making the 10 servings). I also added a couple cups of water since I like it a bit more watery. There was something missing, so I added a splash of white wine vinegar and vooahlah! It was the best chili I have had!

This is the perfect basic chili recipe. I've used ground beef for this but I've also substituted cannellini beans or additional kidney beans for the meat and the flavor is just as good. I also like to add some Asian chili sauce (the kind you see in a lot of Thai restaurants with the clear squeeze bottle with the green cap). That adds a bit more heat and a unique flavor. Great recipe!

This is the perfect chili recipe - Not too many ingredients, easy to make and absolutely delicious! I was short of time, so I skipped the slow cooker and made it on the stove - turned out great!

Love it. It was easy to make and really good. My father likes it much better than my mom cooked her other recipe.  I added one red pepper and one tsp groung cayenne pepper. It is still delicious. I definitely will make it again.

This was really good and easy to make. I added some corn, used green onions and used a can of green chili's instead of a green pepper because that's what I had on hand. My husband loved it and wants me to make it again, and I definitely will.

This was a great dish, but the reason I cook and not bake, is because I can NEVER just stick to a recipe. SOOOO... I substitued 1lb of beef for 1 lb of JimmyDean Hot Sausage.  I added diced green bellpepper, can of corn, the diced tomotoes had the diced chili's already with it, and then added another can of diced medium heat chilis. I also added cumin.  It was a hit with a bite!!!

This was awesome.  Super easy, simple and not too many ingredients.  Only changes I made were to add a little bit of cumin, cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper because we like thoses flavors in our chili.  This will be my go to recipe for chili from now on.  Thanks!

I used this as a base recipe and it was really good! I lessened the amount of chili powder to 1T and I used 1 part navy beans and 1 part black beans. This is also the first time that I've made chili with green pepper and I really liked the new taste dimension that it added! This is for sure a keeper!

I enjoyed this recipe, but found it slightly dry. Adding another can of diced tomatoes took care of that. The nice thing is that you can season it t taste. For a little more spice, try adding: an extra tablespoon chili powder 1 teaspoon dried parsley 1 teaspoon dried basil 3/4 teaspoon dried oregano These can be gradually added as you finish cooking the chili.

Mmmm this is so tasty! I love chili and wanted to learn to make it, so I pulled up this easy recipe. I also added just a few things. I halved the recipe, because it is just me and my husband, although we wouldn't mind left overs! The only amount I do keep is the 2 tablespoons of chili powder, which I add to the meat. I also use ground turkey instead of ground beef and it is just as good. I add a can of black beans, and corn to the mix and also add some chili flakes. When I first started making it, it was very thick so I started adding a can of water (one of the empty cans of beans) to make it a bit more soupy and so it wouldn't become so dry in the slow cooker. My husband and I give this a recipe a thumps up. Def a keeper!

This was very good!  I omitted the beans and replaced them with 1 more can of diced tomatoes and 1 more can of tomato sauce.  Also, I added more chili powder and about half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

Followed the recipe, along with adding a bit of cumin as others had suggested and it turned out perfect. I never thought chili would be so easy.

OK NEW REVIEW FOR ME. I just entered this chili in a contest and took 3rd place out of 17 others. I only added a bit of hot peppers to give it some zing. Thanks again I love it. I have made it about 10 times now and its a hit everytime.

I have never made chili before. I asked my dad if I could substitute black beans for the kidneys? He said I could, but it'd more of a southwestern chili, then he asked if I had any canned corn. I did, so it also went in and everything else was the same. It turned out VERY good! Oh my gosh, what flavor! All because I didn't have kidney beans on hand. Excellent with hot cornbread on the side. 
Thanks, Sue!!!  :)

I used 90% regular supermarket ground beef and it wasn't dry a bit.  I added the cumin and substituted black beans because I don't like kidney beans.  Otherwise, just follow the recipe. It was great.

What a disappointment.  I used the McCormick's seasoning packet but changed nothing else.  I put it in the crock on low for 8 hours, but since the ingredients seemed to absorb all the liquid, the beans burned and stuck to the sides.  I cannot say burned kidney beans mixed into chili are a delicacy.  Perhaps adding the beans at the end would be better.  The extra McCormick seasoning did kick it up.  Don't know if I will use this recipe again.  There are so many out there for slow-cooker chili.

I hated chili nights growing up.  So when my husband asked for chili, I was a little less then thrilled.  I made this recipe and wow, I love chili now.

Super easy and great as is.  I change the green pepper to red, and don't add the tomato sauce because we like it thicker.   This makes enough for 2 meals for us, and freezes great!  I just thaw it and stick it in the microwave until done.

Thank you for sharing this with us. :)

great chili.  We took someone's advice and added a packet of chili seasoning along with the regular spices.  Just right!  Great on a cold evening.

This was definetly lacking flavor. Needs alot more chili powder. It was my first time making chili and my hisband may never let me make it again. It's the only thing he's said he didn't like that I've ever made because is had no flavor at all. I also only added one can of beans (not a bean person)but really did enjoy the combination of all the other ingredients. Just lacked seasoning.

A great chili recipe. Everyone raved about it. I was even asked to enter a chili contest!! The only change I made was I added diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers in the can.

This chili was very good and adaptable for a crowd.  It didn't have much heat, so I put out a bottle of hot sauce for everyone to spice to their taste.  I added a can of corn and the half-can of beer suggested in another review.  I will make this again, but will probably add another can of beans.

This was really good.  I halved the recipe, and omited the green pepper.  I just used the crushed garlic in a jar and also added a little louisiana hotsauce and garic salt.  I used a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  Very Easy to make and tastes great topped with some cheese and tortilla chips to dip.

This really tasted more like a goulosh more than chili.  I added more chili powder and added garlic and onion powder and ground red pepper as well as more salt and pepper and still it wasn't very good.  I also garnished with diced fresh tomatoes and sliced green onions.  It was very filling.

I used the RoTel tomatoes as suggested in previous reviews.  It really did make it spicy!  Next time I'll probably use one can of RoTel and one regular can of tomatoes.  But the chili itself was excellent and very easy to make.  I'm the only one who eats chili in the house so I ate this for a few days and it was better the second day.

I was pretty disappointed in this chili.  It is a good base but definitely lacked flavor.  My 6 yr old is a HUGE chili lover and he was even disappointed in the flavor.  It definitely needs more spice.  I did add about 6-8 oz. of more tomato sauce b/c we prefer a more soupy chili.  I also added a tablespoon of ground cumin and that still was not enough.  I will make this recipe again but I will add a LOT more seasoning to it.

As a person who has never made or even eaten chili before, I'd say it was pretty good. It was definitely easy to make. And it was nice to just let it cook all day and not have to rush around getting dinner ready in the evening. I don't eat red meat so I made it with ground turkey. After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to add some cumin for some added spice. My husband thought that it was perfect but my son thought that it was a little too spicy. Next time I will go for less spicy.

It was alright.  I was a little dissapointed.  It could have used another can of tomato sauce.  Otherwise the ingredients were pretty tasty.

I made this chili with only one exception. As I don't like bell pepper, I used only 1/2. It was amazing! This chili was hearty yet not chalk full of beans. It went well with cornbread and basmati rice or all on it's own. My husband and daughters really enjoyed this meal. My oldest keeps asking me to make it again & I will.

Delicious base recipe!  I used only one pound of ground chuck browned with a little salt, pepper, garlic and onion.  I added a jalepeño, a can of maple baked beans, an extra clove of garlic, 1 teaspoon of cumin, and 2 tablespoons of honey.  I let it simmer 8 hours on high (my crockpot doesn't get as hot as others).  It came out spectacular!

This is my go-to chili recipe! Made as written, I find it needs a little extra spice. 
I add cumin, more chili powder, paprika, and seasoned salt. I use Rotel chile with lime tomatoes, 16oz tomato sauce, because we like a soupier chili. I also add a packet of chili seasoning, along with my own seasonings.

It's just okay.  Definitely not worth a remake.  I found it bland and uninteresting.  I added cayenne, and it was still flat.  I'm going to try the one with Cocoa pwdr, coffee, and beer next.

I'm not a chili fan, but my fiance kept asking me to make chili. When I found this recipe I decided to give it a go and I was really surprised. It was very easy to make and the chili was actually really good. I ended up adding an extra can of beans to better balance the meat to other stuff ratio and I added cumin and crushed red pepper. The chili was the perfect consistency and converted me. I'm now a chili eater.

Great chili recipe. Next time I would add a little more spice though. No matter how much cayenne pepper or paprika I added, it was never spicy enough. Still very good. The cheddar cheese at the end really sealed the deal for this chili. My household doesn't eat that much chili but for those that did, they enjoyed it.

I halved the recipe and added 1-2 Tbsp. of BBQ sauce to give it a little more of a smokey flavor. Tastes a lot better with this added!

Very, very good! I used diced tomatoes with jalapeños, two cans of kidney beans and doubles the chili powder. No bell peppers because, in my opinion, they are not food.  This was boost spicy at all. 
As a side we had honey cornbread. Everyone was happy.

This gets three stars for ease of preparation.  For taste, it's a 2 star recipe at best.  This was VERY bland. I always try recipes as written first and rate them as such.  This could be a five star recipe, but it would take more seasonings.  I will probably double the chili powder, add some cumin, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and a can of tomato paste to make it a little richer.  I will probably switch out one of the regular cans of tomatoes to one with chiles in it.  A dash of hot sauce would probably help too.

Last few times we've had a snow here in Chicago, I've pulled up this recipe and made some chili.  Easy to prepare, cook, and eat!  Comes out great and super simple. 
Addition:  I've tried a few other slow cooker recipes and this is hands down the best.

This is a good basic chili recipe.  It was better the next day.  I doubled the tomato sauce.  I thought it was a bit bland and could use some heat or more spice.

This has been a go to chili recipe for me since it's been published in Taste Of Home.  Not only is it supper easy, but it also tastes good and can easily be multiplied to feed a crowd.  We love it in bread bowls.

This Chili smelled great, but was lacking a little in taste and seemed really dry. I thought maybe I left something out, but I didn't.

I recomend this for beginners

This Was My First Atempt for Chilli..and it  came out  really well , wasnt too spicy.
The recipe called  for 2 tablespoons chilli powder , I used  three to  give it  more of a  chilli flavor.

served on side  as Optional Additives : shredded cheese and Sour Cream, Mustard and  Oyster Crackers.

my kids loved  it and  ate left overs the  next day =)

This was soooo good.  I didn't have a can of tomato sauce, so I used 1/2 of the basil tomato jar sauce.  didn't have a can of diced tomato, so I diced up a fresh tomato.  I cooked the onion added the beef and some frozen minced garlic I had, then followed the rest of the directions.  Eat it with brown rice and shredded cheddar, colby, jack cheese. I can't stop eating it and my husband loves it too. :)

Great simple chilli recipe. I altered amounts to feed 4 and ended up using 1tsp of chilli powder, 1tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp of paprika, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 salt and 1tbsp of worcestshire sauce. I also popped the onions in the pan when browning off the mince. Turned out great, kids enjoyed as it was not too spicy but still had a little kick. Thanks for sharing.

just okay, nothing special.  might try it again as a basic recipe but needs several additions...maybe more beans, seasonings & less meat.  also wouldn't bother to cook it so long

5 stars if you use chili beans, and this doesn't need to cook very long, in fact it tastes better if you cook it less!

I love this recipe and use it all of the time.  I make changes to the recipe depending on my mood and what I have in my fridge or cupboard (I like to add different veggies such as corn or mushrooms or different peppers)...and I always add about a teaspoon of cumin...not because the recipe is lacking...just because I love cumin!

Perfect basic Chili!  I'm a very nervous cook and obsessively watch each person's face as they take their first bite; each face was beyond content.  A sure winner with all of my friends wanting more!

Love it! I made it as stated and it was very good. I made a few adjustments the next time and it was the bomb! The 2nd time I made it with Italian sausage, I added an extra can of tomato sauce and diced tomatoes as I like it with a little more juice.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Amazing! I used 2lbs ground turkey (seasoned it with a bit of cumin and garlic powder) instead of ground beef, omitted the green pepper only because my husband doesn't like them otherwise I would have put it in, doubled the tomato sauce (as I like to crumble Saltines into my bowl), used Red Gold chili ready tomatoes and added an extra clove garlic. This is definitely one of the BEST chilis I have had! Thank you for a great recipe!

Great recipe. I used 1 lb. Moose burger and 1 lb. lean hamburger. Added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin seed and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. I used 1/2 the salt also. Followed the rest of the recipe to the tee!
Can't wait for leftovers!

Halved it.  Threw in a small package of sliced mushrooms, 3/4 c.  thinly sliced zucchini,  and a  huge handful of preshredded carrots. So no need for extra veggies.  A total meal deal, wonderful!!!  : )

I have been researching different recipes for quite sometime... This is absolutely PERFECT and so SIMPLE to make. I used a pound a sirloin and a pound of lean ground turkey. The second time I made it, I used Ranch Style beans (26oz - do not drain) 2 cans of ZESTY diced tomatoes, 3 jalapenos - chopped and a tbsp of Cummin... AWESOME people... Just AWESOME!!!

WONDERFUL recipe! I added 1 and a half cups of elbow macaroni noodles to the recipe when it had 20 min. remaining. I opted the green peppers and only added in 1 onion ((picky kids)) and added in another 8 ounce can tomato sauce, because of the noodles. This is a wonderful mouthwatering recipe for those cold winter months. Add some good hardy bread on the side and everyone will be so full they'll forget about snack time :)

AWESOME recipe!! I made this the other night for friends but added a can of original rotel and a small can of diced green chiles and it was amazing. We like a little kick to our chili and this gives just the right amount. We will be making this much more:)

Awesome chili recipe.  A few hours into cooking after taste testing, I did add a can of tomato paste to sweeten it up just a little.  Turned out perfect!

I used what I had on hand so altered this just a bit.  I substituted one can of kidney beans with one can of black beans.  I also only had a Mexican-style diced tomatoes on hand which had green chiles in it.  Both cans of tomatoes were with these.  It came out excellently!

excellent basic recipe, I cooked the the beef with 2 tablespoons of Worchestershire , and added 3  freshly diced garlic buds. I used 1 large red pepper instead of the green. I also added 3 drops of tobasco sauce to the pot to add some kick & used about 1/2 bottle  of beer. Also added 2 cups of diced fresh mushrooms.  I also drained the excess fluids off the mix as I prefer moist chili over being too soggy and wet. Served this to friends and they begged to take some home. Making more again today !

Excellent as a base recipe! Though I'm not sure how this would fare on it's own.  However, because this is such a good starting point for a great chili, I still think it deserves an good rating.  I won't bore you with every little alteration I made but I will say this: do yourself a favor and add ALOT of veggies, and also there is no need for Cumin! (I actually discovered that Cumin is "that flavor" I hate ((but didn't know what it was)) when it is prominent in some chilis just by smelling a labelled can of it for the first time)

This is a very good chili. I've made it several times now and do make some small changes. I like to use 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of baked beans and it adds just a touch of sweetness! Sometimes I will also use a diced tomato with green chili in it for extra spice. It's such a perfect basic recipe that anyone can adjust it to their liking.

My 12 year old can't stop raving about this simple to make and delicious chili!  I followed the recipe exactly as suggested and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it turned out!  I refrigerated left-overs and had several lunches at work out of it, yum!

July 8, 2011 update: I  now use twice as much garlic as the recipe calls for and the chili is divine! The extra garlic gives this hearty dish a nice flavorful kick.  Delicious!

Good base chili recipe. Only change I made was to add 1 Tbsp. of ground cumin.  At first I thought there wouldn't be enough liquid but I was wrong.  Cooked on high for 4 hours.  Served with crushed Fritos, shredded cheddar and sour cream.  Tasted even better the next day.

Straightforward, hearty and tasty!  I jazzed it up a little by using one can of kidney beans and one of mixed beans (that included black beans, chickpeas, etc.)  I also added a can of corn niblets which added some colour and interest.  I found this lacked some 'zip' but it was nothing a dash of hot sauce couldn't cure!

I chose this recipe for my first slow cooker chili experience and it was excellent.  I added 1 chopped up jalapeno pepper and 1 tsp of cumin.  Even my boyfriend loved it and had 2 large servings and was even contemplating a third...:)

Really great chili!  As it was cooking, I was worried that it looked too "soupy" but adding a dollop of sour cream to the individual bowls thickened it up nicely.  The changes I made:  I used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce based on reviews that said the original recipe was too dry (ironic).  I used 4 cloves of garlic and added a few shakes of cayenne pepper.  Next time, I think I'll try only using 3/4 of the 15 oz. can of tomato sauce to see if that helps make it thicker.  The taste was perfect!

Fantastic. I really went wild with the garlic! On a cold evening (and when you're not feeling too well), this chili will leave you with a good feeling. And probably for one or two more servings.

This was my first time crock-potting chili, and I have to say, the texture of the meat came out better than any I have ever had before! I'm not the biggest fan of meat to start with (it's just ok, and sometimes disgusting, IMO) but crock-potting the ground beef for 7 hours rendered into tiny, tender pieces rather than the large chewy chunks I get from just browning & draining alone without a 7 hour simmer. I did have to dress up the spices in this very heavily, but that was a given before I even started the recipe really. Note for others: I could not fit this entire recipe into a 3 quart crock pot. I wound up leaving out the 2nd can of tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe, I'll use this again!

My family enjoyed this.  I cooked the meat the night before.  In the morning, I just placed everything in the crock pot, and let it cook on low for about 6-7 hours.  There was enough left over for the next 2 days!

Family loved it!  Even my 7 year old loved it, he didn't even notice the green peppers.  My mom thought it could use more spices but hubby and boys thought it was very good.  We don't like a lot of spices.

this was a great recipe to try out our new slow cooker. We followed the measurements exactly and found it delicious. However, next time we might cut down on the chilli powder as we are both wussy in the heat department and not used to chilli!

It didn't come out great, my family and I didn't like it at all. I waited for it for hours and then it was a big disappointment.

Easy and good.  I usually do a turkey chili but my husband requested a "real meat" chili and I tried this one.  I'm all for anything slow cooker.  I added some extra veggies just to get them in our meal.  But still would have been good without.

It turned out excellent, was a real hit!!!! I have recently did a complete modification of this recipe.

1 3/4 cups dry kidney beans
2 Lb. ground beef
3 1/2 cups diced tomatoes
1 medium green bell pepper
1 stalk diced celery
1/4 cup minced dehydrated onion
1 cup tomato sauce
2 tsp garlic powder
2 tbsp chili powder
2 tsp salt

1. Soak kidney beans overnight. I recommend at least 10 hours. When developing recipe I soaked them for 6 hours and had to add 3 1/2 cups of water.

2. Fry hamburger until well done.

3. Combine all ingredients in crockpot, cook on high for 6-8 hours.

This is a fantastic recipe, especially for people who don't like vegetables (me being one of them!).  It was the second slow cooker recipe I ever tried, and I've made it several times since.  Changes I made were to add a 16oz can of chili beans (still used the two 16oz cans of dark red kidney), one can of tomatoes (tried different kinds, last one was a can of stewed tomatoes with onions, celery, and green pepper with low salt from Del Monte - big plus for the people watching salt intake), 16oz can of tomato sauce instead of 8oz, about 7oz onion (pre-chopped because I'm kind of new to figuring out how to pick good produce), and two red peppers instead of green.  I used a lot more garlic too (love it!).  For people that don't like vegetables, I'd recommend taking most of them and almost doing a puree thing.  That is how I managed to get myself to eat this recipe.  The beans I left as is though.  Trust me, I do NOT like raw vegetables (especially tomatoes, onions, and peppers), but the flavors when cooked are great.  LOVE this recipe and love that I can modify it with it still turning out well!

This was fantastic! The only changes we made were: we used ground venison instead of beef, we used chili-style diced tomatoes (spicy) & we did have to add a large can of tomato sauce toward the end since it got way too thick. We will definitely use this recipe again!!!

Very good basic chili recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and I would definitely make again. (I did use tomatoes for chili.) I enjoyed the convenience of making this in a slow cooker. I did prep ingredients the night before and put the chopped ingredients in the chili tomatoes overnight in the fridge. I think this may have added some additional flavor.

I didn't have any canned tomatoes, so I added some medium salsa and beef broth to make up the difference in liquid.  It turned out great!  Thanks Sue!

I made this today for Super Bowl Sunday. I've made lots of different versions of chili, but for the flavor delivered given the simplicity of ingredients and ease of preparation, this wins hands-down. My husband was impressed. "Where did you get this recipe?" he asked. From now on, this will be my go-to chili recipe.

This was my first attempt at making Chili... after reading through so many recipes here, I settled on this one. I have to say, I followed the recipe to a tee, and was somewhat dissappointed with the flavor, it seems to be missing something, and being a novice cook, I am not sure what it is. There seemed to be enough heat, but what flavor exactly is missing I am not sure. Was a little thinner than I had hoped also. It cooked in the slow cooker for 10 hours while I was at work, and when I got home, the house was filled with the awesome smell of chili cooking. If anyone knows what spice would make this taste more authentic, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you for sharing this recipe, I have learned I really enjoy cooking recently and will continue to search for more good recipes.

I made several alterations to the recipe, but the result was delicious!  I made this for a housewarming party last and several people asked for the recipe.  I forgot to buy onions, so I added 3 extra cloves of garlic to the meat after it browned.  I used Trader Joe's diced and fire roasted tomatoes with green chiles which gave the chili a nice kick.  Because the tomatoes made it a bit too spicy, I also added Newman's Own Tomato and Basil Bambolina sauce (3/4 cup).  The sauce is too sweet on it's own, but helped to balance out some of the heat.  Lastly, I added 1 tsp of cumin.  Next time I'm going to try adding some dark chocolate for sweetness and smoothness instead of the sauce, but the chili does need a little extra liquid.  I'm also going to remember the onions.

I did make a few changes to this.  First off I used Turkey instead of beef.  I also used 1 can of chili beans with the sauce so then I did not add the tomato sauce.  It came out great!

Good basic recipe - works surprisingly well "as is".  Another time I added a can of corn, a can of chilis, a chopped green pepper and a teaspoon of cumin.  Had to use black beans, which were probably not as good as kidney beans.  This recipe is pretty fool proof and kid-friendly.  Will definitely use again.

I think this is a great recipe but I did change it up a bit for my family's taste. We don't care for onions or peppers so I didn't use those instead I added corn. I also only used 1 small can of beans.  Sometimes I add a little cayanne pepper seasoning to make it warmer.  Then I crush up some fritos and put them on top. Another favorite dipping for my chili besides fritos is toasted peanut butter bread. Very good recipe, love it!! Lots of comments from family and friends.

This was very good! The only thing I did was add a jalapeno pepper to it, because we like spicy food. :)

Perfect, Basic exactly how I Love it Chili!! The only thing that makes it better is adding some Cumin :) And to make life easier it's perectly delicious when you use the Tomato, Onion & Garlic all together in the can!! Soo Good, & also comes out good just on the stove, if you don't have a slow cooker, don't worry! Just let it simmer on the stove for about an hour!!

Modified this recipe some, I used one large green onion instead of two medium onions, I used a store bought tomato sauce that was meant for microwaving and making quick spaghetti, but I've heard from a few people that it works well, with the seasonings that are in it. I also used only 1 and a half pounds of ground beef, because that's all I had. I also added a few different spices, a chili spice, which is a blend of a few kinds of peppers, and some paprika. Also added a tablespoon of sugar to the whole mix, to soften the acidity of the tomatoes. Great recipe for a simple chili, and a great starter for your own recipes!

I never made chili before, but this turned out quite good (though not absolutely outstanding) with some alterations.  I used half the beans and half the chili powder.  My husband neither likes beans nor extra spicy food.  Even though this was said to be a milder chili recipe, it was spicy enough for us, even with half the chili powder.  I also kept scooping out the extra liquid from the crockpot.  I'm glad I did or else it would have been too liquidy.

We loved this recipe! It made so much (I added 1 can of black beans, and a schwack of garlic) that I used 2 crock puts and frozen about 1/3 of it once we had eaten.

Tasty but something was missing, I just couldn't put my finger on it.  I would make again - perhaps play around with the spices a little.  All in all a good recipe.

This is a really good chili recipe. I did not have the problem of it being "dry" at all. It was actually a little liquidy, but I imagine the leftovers will be less soupy. I thought it was good as-is, but my husband said it could use a little less onion (I used 2 large onions) and more meat (I used a little less than 2 lbs.) Only changes I made were to use a red pepper instead of a green one and I added a tsp of cinnamon.

Yummy!  I've made this several times with some minor adjustments: I add 1 chopped red pepper, some Frank's Red Hot, and use only 1 can of beans.  I also season the ground beef with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder while cooking it.  I have also made it in a pot on the stove, and it is still good!

My husband and I both love this recipe. It's the best chili recipe I've tried. I used stew meat or cubed chicken breast instead of ground beef (as I don't care for ground beef in chili), but it comes out wonderfully this way. I also add a couple of teaspoons of cumin for some smokiness and use rotel diced tomatoes for chili instead of plain. A hit every time! Thanks for this recipe!

I have tried several chili recipes and this has been the best one by far. My family really enjoyed it. I added a dash of Cumin and a 15oz. can of tomato sauce, but other than that I followed the recipe and it was wonderful.

I have made this several times now and we have really enjoyed it at my house.  I add a can of corn and I use already seasoned beans (chili beans pre seasoned) as a substitute for one of the kidney beans.  I also buy seasoned tomato sauce and tomatoes then add a little less chili powder.  My 2 and half year old loves it.

Can you really go wrong with cooking chili in a slow cooker? Not really.  Overall this was very good and you can add or change things as you wish.  I always like to use chunky tomato sauce in my chili & lots of onion.  Serve in a bowl topped w/sour cream & shredded cheese and you have the perfect comfort food on a cold winter's day!

I had to add a lot of extra.  A large can of tomato juice, red pepper (crushed and powder), garlic powder, chili ready tomatos, chili ready beans, hot sauce, among other things for taste, after a while it was a dash of this and a splash of that.  It was good even though in the end I relized I forgot chili powder, lol!

Super easy to make.  I like Chili kind of spicy so I used Chili beans plus still added all the chili powder.  I also added a couple teaspoons of cumin and some chopped jalapenos.

Excellent recipe, we loved the addition of green pepper.  I also tried this with half the diced tomatoes and half the kidney beans to make a meatier chili.  Both ways were great.

I have to say that this chili was amazing. I did make a few changes though. I added cumin and red cayanne pepper during the browning process and some more in the slow-cooker. Also, I added 2 jalepenos seeded and chopped and a little parsley to garnish. I think that for my first time ever making chili it turned out fantastic! It had a nice spicy afterbite. We loved it! I will use this recipe for a long time to come.

I'm not vegetarian, but I made this with Yves Meatless Ground soy product (there are like products made by Boca Burger and MorningStar). Also, I cut the salt to 1 teaspoon, added a tablespoon of cumin and 1/4 cup of red wine. I used black beans because I didn't have kidney beans. This one's a keeper!

So, while I do not like chili, my boyfriend loves it. So using the new crockpot we got, I decided to cook him some. He doesnt like tomatoes, so i omitted the diced tomatoes, and i only added one onion (no space left in the crockpot) and we forgot chili powder... but he said it was practically perfect. If it had had the chili powder, it couldnt have been better. Whats best? I cooked the meat while dicing the onion and pepper, etc, and made it the night before. The day after, i scooped it into different tupperware and put grated cheddar cheese on top. His coworker even tried a bit and said he was switching in his wife for a new one who would cook for him like this, haha.

Decent chili.  I added a jalapeno and a little extra chili powder for more kick.  Has good potential, makes a basic chili.

I doubled the amount of tomato sauce and it was still fairly dry so I added another can. I also used diced tomatoes w/green chilies to make it a little more spicy. Other than that, this recipe was delicious!! I can't wait to have leftovers!

Absolutely loved it!  It's a very easy recipe and it turned out great.  I made a few changes:  I used half-chicken, half-beef, but the flavor was great, even for my beef-lovin' husband!  He said he would not have known there was chicken in it.  
I have a 7 qt. slow cooker and I cooked it for 8 hours.

hubby made this on a sat morning. we were gone all day and evening and came home to a huge pot of yummy chili. he accidentally used 3 lbs ground beef but we still thought it was good. will make again w/ the 3 lbs of ground beef and add another can of beans. we are topping baked potatoes w/ these and some cheddar cheese, sour cream, and sliced green onions for an easy weeknight meal. great recipe when you are looking for basic chili

Great...with the addition of 4 oz can of diced green chilis, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 tsp smokey tabasco sauce to chili.  Also, 1 tsp paprika, 2 tsp cumin and 1 1/2 tsp garlic salt to meat.  I did 1 lb. of ground turkey instead of 2 lbs ground beef.

Served with cheesy cornbread muffins and a dollop of light sour cream.

What a great base!  I used stew beef instead so we had chunks of beef.  I made this as a cold dish by cooking it in the crockpot for 5 hours on high then refrigerating it.  I dished it up with cheader cheese, sour cream, and avocado.
CHANGES:  I used a 15oz can of tomato sause.  I added some green cabbage to hide another veggie in it.  I diced it thin like an onion and just through some in the pot... no one noticed/knew.

This was the first time cooking chili and it was sooo easy! The only modifications I made were adding a can of black beans, garlic, and a packet of chili seasoning. My family loved it, and I served it with sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips. Will definitely make again! I would not have made without the chili seasoning. It spiced it up, but not too much. It smelled so good while it was cooking!

Wow, my husband actually liked it!  He can be really picky about chili and I have tried several versions.  The only changes I made to the recipe were:
1. White beans instead of kidney because I had them on hand.
2. Cooked it on the stove and simmered it on low for about 5 hrs.  When it started to dry out, I added a little beer.  It worked well, adding some nice flavor.

Good straight forward recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

To be honest, you can start with this basic Chili recipe, add practically anything, and it will turn out fantastic. I cleaned my cupboards with this one. I added black beans, kidney beans, red beans, hot sauce, ketchup, onions, red pepper and more. Very good base recipe and an excellent way to use up cans of odds and ends.

Made this for "Poker Sunday" and served 5 guys. They loved it & gave it rave reviews! It is a perfect basic recipe and you can tweak it as you wish, but it is perfect as is. Since my husband doesn't like beans, I left them out and it was still great! I always like to add extra seasonings so I incresed the garlic, added cumin, paprika & sauteed the ground serloin w/ 1/2 of the onion & some garlic before adding it to the crock pot. Just like the other readers said...it makes the house smell soooo good! When placed in individual bowls, top w/ a dollop of sour cream in addition to the cheddar for an extra special treat. I will definately make this again.

This chili recipe is delicious.  I have made it a couple times and it is now a family favorite.  I added a spoonful of sour cream and some cheddar cheese, doubled up on the green peppers, and left out the beans.  This is excellent on a cold, winter day.

This recipe works best if slow cooked for at least 6 hours.  I added a good squirt of ketchup at the end of cooking that made it a little sweet but still slightly spicy.  Excellent chili!

Recipe was great!  Easy to follow.  It does need a kick though so next time I am going add some cayenne pepper and more chili powder for that extra kick.  I am not fond on onions so I only used half of an onion and it was plenty!

I love this recipe...and since its cold outside I've been making it just about weekly. I add some extra cumin to mine, and sometimes a jalapeno that I remove after its done for some spice but other than that my whole family gobbles it up..freezes well too!

This is a very good chili recipe.  I love that it can set all day while I am at work and I do not have to worry about it cooking too long.  It always taste better the longer it sets anyways.  My husband also likes it.  He says that it is a lot like the chili that they have at Wendy's.  

I know that many comments complain about the chili being to bland.  I do not mind as some of the people that I have eating this do not like spicy foods.  I always leave some tabasco sauce and extra seasoning out for those who do like it spicy.  I do prefer to use my own chili seasoning mix though.  I have made this recipe with only one pound of hamburger as well and it still turns out great.  Also, do not forget that while the chili is cooking it will create it's own broth from the steam.  I was afraid that it wouldn't the first time I made this and it turned a little more soupy than I prefer, but it was still great.

Very nice. I only put in 1 rounded tablespoon of chili though, as I like it mild. Made it overnight and had it the next evening -- chili's always better on the 2nd day!

As another reviewer mentioned, this is a good base chili recipe.  Made as-is, it's somewhat boring - not spicy at all, no complexity of flavors - just what you'd expect if Chef Boyardee made chili.

This isn't the end of the world though - as a base, it can be easily tweaked to fit all fans - from those who prefer spicy, smoky chili (add some canned chipotle) to those feeding small children (as-is).

My only gripe - even as a base, how do you not have cumin?  Chili without cumin?!

I made this with great reults during a fall camping trip last month.  Today we are having our first snowstorm of the winter and chili seemed like a perfect meal so I have a big crock of it simmering on low.  The only change I made was to add a lot more chili powder and a bit of hot sauce, we like our chili spicy!

This is an awesome recipe, but better with a few tweaks, I think.  I browned the ground beef with 1 tsp cummin and 3 cloves minced garlic. (I omitted the green pepper).  I added a full 14 oz. can tomato sauce and 1/2 can of pumpkin (the plain stuff, not pumpkin pie mix). It cooked on low for 9 hours and was sooo good with Fritos chips, sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese for toppings.  My son even takes leftovers to school the next day in a thermos!

This is a good, basic chili recipe. I used pinto beans instead of kidney and I used a 16 ounce can of tomato sauce. I served it topped with lots of grated cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream. It's a VERY MILD chili, and I found myself wishing it had more flavor. Next time I'll use a can of Rotel tomatoes or a can of chili-ready tomato sauce, along with more seasonings. Don't be afraid to try this recipe - it's a perfect recipe to tweak to your liking.

Very good! I am not big on spicy foods but even I thought that this chili was lacking a kick! I just added a bit more chili powder and my husband added some tobasco sauce and we gobbled it right up! Zero leftovers!

This was very good.  We added more garlic, doubled the tomato sauce, and used chuck instead of ground beef, 1 teaspoon of Cumin, and a jalapeño.  We would add more garlic and more tomatoes next time, but overall had very good flavor, very easy to make and was very filling and hearty.

I was looking for a quick chili recipe that would cook while I was in class, and this is by far the best and easiest chili I have ever had! I took it to a study group that night, and my friends raved about it -- even those that said they usually don't care for chili!

I tweaked it a little bit.. I added some frozen corn (about 3/4 of a cup), and I added some beef stock (about 2 cups).  I also bought four dried chili peppers, cut the ends off, and stuck them whole in the chili to fuse it with some smoky sweet spiciness. I also used diced tomatoes that had spices added to give it a little extra flavor. It was a little watery after cooking on high in the crockpot for four hours, so I transferred it to a large pot  and let it simmer for 45 minutes.  By then, it was perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great chili.  I didn't change anything.  They were eating it out of the crockpot, before it was even done.  I'm making it again this weekend.

Made this last night and it was fantastic!  I halved the recipe (but used a full 8oz can of tomato sauce) and used diced tomatoes with green chilies as that's what I had and added a drained can of corn.  I also used a little under 1/2 TBSP of chili powder so my 15m old daughter could also eat it and cooked the onions and garlic with the ground beef.  It still had some kick, and was great!  Hubby loved it, too!  Will definitely make again!

Super cali fragi listic expial delicious!  Instead of using two Tbsp's of chili powder, I only used 1 and a half along with a tablespoon of curry.   I would upload the actual dish, but I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be good for my computer.

My husband thought it was really good! I did add some cumin and next time I'll add pinto beans instead of kidney beans. I didn't get a chance to make this in the slow cooker and let it simmer on the stove for about an hour and a half instead. Yummy!

I have prepared this chili several times and it came out great.  I made it again today and this time instead of using a whole green or red pepper, I used half of a red bell pepper, 1 cherry pepper and 1 poblano pepper.  I also added about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  It came out really good and plenty hot and spicy!

A Good basic recipe that I use as a base. I cook the onions and garlic with the meat, then season with steak seasoning, roasted garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, extra salt and pepper... I say extra because I feel the flavors sometimes deaden in the slow cooker over time. I also a can of corn add at least one chipotle pepper in adobo sauce with the ribs and seeds removed and some of the adobo sauce before stirring and closing the lid on the slow cooker.

This is a great base recipe for chili and it has been our go to in our family for seven plus years. I modify the ingredients a bit...instead of 2 pounds of ground beef I do a lb of pork sausage and 1lb of ground beef. Then instead of kidney beans we do black beans. I use 5 different peppers instead of just the green bell pepper but all in all it's a win every time I make it.

A good, basic chili.  Some people may prefer to add extra veggies or more spice to it, but this recipe worked well for us.  My 8 yr old nephew (who "hates" onions and anything spicy) loved it.

Very unimpressed with this recipe. With all the good reviews, I thought for sure it would be great. Tried it twice, the first time following the recipe exactly, and the second time with a bit more spices, and still could barely eat it. My husband, who usually eats anything, refused to eat the leftovers, my children refused to eat it at all. Do not recommend.

This is a simple, delicious chili recipe. I have been making this one for years, and I never change a thing. The only thing I would recommend is using sirloin chop meat... it's worth the extra cost.

I really love this recipe and have used it for years.  I just wanted to tell you my two secret ingredients.  First of all, often I use bison instead of regular beef.  Bison is so rich and delicious.  That same beef flavor but with a richer dimension.  But whether i use bison or beef, i always add about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 2 teaspoons of oregeno to this dish.  I usually do this in the sautee pan after I've drained the fat off the beef.  I drain the fat, add the spices to the beef and then just cook it for about 3 more minutes so the spices sear into the beef/bison.  It cooks a little differently this way once you put it into the slow cooker.  

Since my kids don't like kidney beans, I substitute white beans (canelli) for those.  I once used garbanzo instead also.  Any bean of that type will do.  Also, I only use one can and I up the veggies.  It is such a great dish and even better the  next day.  Thanks for this classic recipe!

This chili has almost no flavor. I added a lot more chili powder and added cayenne pepper as well.

I just made this for the second time. I halved the recipe, but put in almost all the beans called for, the whole can of tomato sauce and an 8oz package of LightLife meat substitute (I am vegetarian). It was soooooo delicious. I still have some left in the refrigerator for the next few days. Great, simple recipe.

I have been making this recipe for a while now, and it's ALWAYS a hit!  I'm a college student, so I love a cheap recipe with little effort.  I have played with it and made variations.  I never use beef, always turkey (my mom even used elk once!)  To make a vegetarian chili, swap the meat for a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  I'm always liberal with the garlic and chili powder.  Diced tomatoes are better than crushed, but if that's what you have then use it.  It will come out a little more soupy but no less tasty.  And use whatever beans you have, it doesn't matter.  Never disappoints!

I absolutely swear by this recipe! It's never let me down. Let me say it's great as it is written. 

I've made some adjustments to it but NOT because it lacks anything at all - just personal preferences based on what I like (or don't like as much)...

That said, here are my alterations to some of the listed ingredients and I added a new one:

1 lb. stew meat; 1 lb. lean ground beef; 1 can of kidney beans; 1/2 of a large onion, chopped; 1 (4 oz.) can of chopped green chilis...

Also, at the end, I take about 1/4 cup of cornstarch in a bowl, dissolve it in water and stir it in to thicken.


The rest of the ingredients I use as directed. It's really an awesome recipe!

Yum, but I did do a few changes.  I only used 1.25 of 93% lean ground beef seasoned with a little garlic salt which was plenty for my husband and I.  I also added some more tomato sauce, because it looked to dry with only 8oz.   I later thicken it some by adding 1 can of tomato paste.   Instead of plain diced tomatos I used 2 cans of rotel tomatos with chilis.  Instead of chili seasoning I added about 3 tbs of Tastefully Simple Wahoo Chilly seasoning.  (it has a kick!)   I also just used about 3 spoonfuls of minced garlic I had in a jar instead of mincing fresh cloves.

This is a great starter recipe for a slow cooker chili. Great mixture of meat, peppers, beans, and tomatoes, although I used less onions. Also, after cooking about half the day, the chili wasn't thick and need more chili flavor, so I added a can of tomato paste and additional chili powder and that added the perfect touch for my taste!

This chili was simple to make and tasted amazing! The only major change I made was to add tomato juice because it was too thick for my liking. I only used 1 onion instead of 2, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. I set it on high for 2 1/2 hours and it was perfect by then!

This was a first for me in two ways:  my first time to make chili and my first time use a slow cooker.  This meal was delicious and filling.  Perfect for cold weather.  I used fire-roasted salsa style tomatoes and seasoned to taste.  Yummy.  My four-year-old son loved it, too!  Next time I plan on adding a little bit more kick for a spicier version.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a GREAT basic chili recipe. I made it with a few minor variations and I was very pleased with the results. I was serving 6 people so I made the serving size to 14 and it was gone after two bowls each. I also added 2 cans (5 ounce each) of green chili. I also added one can of chili beans.

I used this recipe as a guideline, however instead of ground beef I used steak cubes (I believe it was beef round). Delicious! I used 2 cans of fire-roasted tomatoes, canned chopped green chiles, fresh green and yellow bell peppers, and a purple onion.  I also added a dollop of Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and a small squirt of sriracha sauce. Yum!!!

This recipe can be easily modified to suit your tastes or just to use up what you have on hand.  I used home-canned tomatoes and added a jar of tomato paste to make it thicker.  Also used 2 bell peppers and a bag of dried kidney beans (that I cooked beforehand).  It definitely needed more spices in my opinion, so I added more chili powder as weel as some onion and garlic powder.  My coworkers loved it.

Excellent chili and was very easy to put together.  The time spent in the crock pot was well worth it to get a rich, smoky flavor.  It was a large pots worth, so i froze half for a dinner on the fly in a couple of weeks!

I love this recipe! Awesome! I make this recipe several times a year. I made this chili for a potluck at work and now my coworkers request this chili everytime we do a potluck.   I made a few minor changes to the recipe. I deleted the green pepper and added 2 tsps. cumin and a dash of red pepper. I use garlic oregano basil diced tomatoes to add some extra seasoning.   I will definitely continue to make this recipe.

Great recipe....I used another review suggestion and used ground turkey instead of beef.  I used Fire Roasted diced tomato's for more flavor.  I used one can of Bushes Chili Beans and a can of kidney beans. I added 1 tsp. of cumin.  Cooked it for 4 hours and was concerned with the thickness, so I slowly added 1 can of tomato paste throughout a 1 hour period for desired thickness.  Lastly I added 1 package of Frenches Chili-O seasoning packet as there wasn't enough flavoring.  When it was done it was perfect for my tasting as I know everyone has different tastes when it comes to chili!  Served it with homemade cornbread and enjoyed it!

What a great chili riecipe this is. I put it in right before church and when we all got home it was done perfectly. I friend the meat the night before and sliced the peppers and onion as well. Then in the morning all I had to do was throw it all together and stir before leaving for church. When we got home you could smell the chili as we walked in the door. I substituted the 2 16oz cans of kidney beans for 3 32oz cans of chili beans and insetead of chopping the onions I slivered them and they gave the chili a beautiful texture. Everyone raved about this recipe and two of my guests asked for the recipe. I served fritos, corn tortilla chips, shredded cheddar blend and sour cream with this as well. Thank you for such a quick and easy recipe!

GREAT! I usually just use the McCormick's Chili Seasoning pakcet when I make chili, but I won't be able to get away with that anymore! :-) I added 2 Tbsp of Worsteshire (sp?) sauce and also did not drain the kidney beans. It was great!

I thought it was a great chili! I first want to say thanks for the recipe, it's a huge hit. I am giving it 5 stars because it tasted good, and was a great base, I only adjusted it to my taste. I replaced the tomatoes for a 30 ounce can of tomato puree. I also added a teaspoon of red cayenne pepper.

I made this chili for my very picky eater of a boyfriend. I made a few adjustments though. I cooked the ground beef with a tablespoon of taco seasoning and a pinch of garlic powder. I also did not have tomato sauce so i subsituted 2 cans of tomato paste and about 2 cups of low sodium beef broth. I added cumin, cayenne pepper, 4 cloves of garlic, one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans. I only used one can of cut up tomato, also low sodium. It turned out great. It was a chunkier chili which I prefer. The boyfriend approved too.

This was a delicious chili and super easy. I substituted and used Elk meat instead of hamburger. My husband isn't an onion fan so for this time I just used 1/2 of a medium onion and he never even noticed and went back for seconds. I added in about 1 1/2 cups of Brown Sugar for sweetness and a little more black pepper, garlic powder,  onion powder, and while cooking off the elk meat I seasoned it with Johnny's Seasoning Salt. Hope this helps someone but yes it is amazing!

My new favorite chili. My husband even likes it better than his own.  I did add cumin and oregano into the pot. I liked it much better this way.

Delicious!  This is what chili is supposed to taste like.  I was worried that it wouldn't be soup-y enough but in the end turned out to be the right consistency.  Instead of the seasonings listed in this recipe, I used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe from this site, as it is my go-to seasoning for everything.  I also used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of red beans.  Definitely will be making this again!

This chili was so good!  I used ground turkey and chickpeas and doubled the sauce and chili powder because it wasnt the consistency of chili to me w/ the suggested amts.  It was fabulous and the best part - super easy!

This Chili is super easy, great tasting and easy to modify to your tastes. I only used 1 can of light kidney beans rinsed, and only about 1 1/2 lbs ground beef that I had precooked earlier in the week. Also, used 1 can regular diced tomatoes and 1 can italian style because it is what I had on hand.  Put all ingredients in the slow cooker on low for 5- 6hrs and it was fantastic! Will definitely use this recipe again!

I used 1 can of diced tomatos and 3 cans of beans, which turned out fine for us (my husband is not a big tomato guy).  Next time, I will double the tomato sauce to give it more of a soupier texture because this was pretty hearty (as in, not as soupy as I like my chili).

Wonderful recipe!   Made it in the crockpot just in time for the football games! I used a red pepper instead of a green pepper (ran out of green peppers) and I added a can of corn (low sodium, drained).  Took exactly 4 hours on high in the crockpot.

I halved this recipe, and my husband and I almost ate the whole thing for dinner!!  It was so simple and satisfying on a cold winter's night.  I had about 1/4 cup of lentils in the pantry, so I threw those in too.

Not only is this chili easy to make, it's the yummiest we ever had.  My husband likes it so much, he'll make it himself.  Enjoy!

This chili was so good! Not spicy at all so my 3yo was able to eat it. The only change I made was to add a little spaghetti sause to thicken it a bit in the end. Only half a jar I had left over. I loved it and will defintely be making this again.

Too much for our smallish slow cooker, had to cook on stovetop. Used one can kidney, one can pinto beans. There was just enough spice for just being chili powder. A little watery, next time I'll try draining at least one of the cans of tomatoes. But very good!

This is very similar to the chili recipe my mom gave me.  Instead of tomato sauce I put in another can of tomatoes and an extra can of kidney beans.  I don't like a lot of meat so I only put in a pound.  Very good!  The best chili I have ever had!

The first time I made this was for a potluck at work. I got it all ready and tossed it in the crock pot, letting it sit overnight. The house smelled Delicious the next morning. My coworkers loved it so much, I didn't get any. My family made me make it for the next night and it disappeared quickly. It is wonderful as is, no changes necessary, though I do tend to cut down on the onion a little, but that is only personal preference.

This was tasty and super easy to make. I cooked it on the stovetop but I would try it next time in a slow cooker. It tasted really good on tortilla chips.

This is the first time that I made chili, but thanks to the great recipe I hit a home-run!  Instead of 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato sauce, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes, one 6 oz. can of tomato paste, and 1 home-canned stewed tomatoes with great results.  Added cumin.  Ran out of chili powder; probably only used half of what's called for.  I used venison hamburger meat.  It was very good.  No gamey flavor whatsoever.

This was a great simple recipe. We added half a packet of McCorrmicks chili seasonings in addition to the other seasonings. Also an extra 6 oz. of tomato sauce (flavored with garlic.) We used the Rotel mild chili blend and 1/2 cup of sliced jalanpenos for a little kick and it turned out awesome.

Great chili! Only changes I made were to use Chili Style diced tomatoes, and only 1 can of kidney beans and added 1 can of Chili flavored Pinto beans. It is not spicy at all so if you are looking for that then you will need to add a little something to it..but great base recipe. Was great the next day as a frito pie with Chili Cheese Fritos.

This is a good fuss free recipe which is what I was looking for. I made it for my daughter's 18th birthday party. I left out the green pepper and used an extra clove of garlic. Thankyou for a crowd pleaser.

I have never made chili before and I thought this came out very well. I spiced it up with a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes and a little Corriander. I also added one extra garlic clove because I love garlic. I thought it had a nice bite to it once I added a little heat. I will save this recipe and use it again, maybe for a party!

I will add one more to the five star rating! It was my first time making my own chili. I grew up with "Mom's Best" but its been a long time and this is definitely WONDERFUL. We had it for dinner, then breakfast, and what the heck... lunch too. Don't change a thing!

This is the best chili that I've ever made!  It is my new chili recipe.  I only submit a review of a recipe if I make few or no changes.  The only thing that I did was added chili seasoning to the ground beef and left everything else the same.  It was perfect!

Great basic recipe. However, my family likes a chunky style. So I cut up stew meat instead of ground beef. This works great in the slow cooker too.  Very hearty!

Excellent basic chili recipe...I am not a huge fan of cumin which is what initially made me try this recipe.  I add a container of chilis for a little extra kick. This is a great recipe to play around with and add things to your liking!

A very good basic beginning. I did make a few changes...used 1 onion instead of 2, removed the green pepper and substituted in their place a 16 oz jar of salsa (pick your poison on that one!). I also added a good dash each of sage, cumin, and red pepper flakes and then doubled the salt. This was a HUGE hit over nacho chips with melted cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.

Yummiest Chili ever! We swapped the beef for Ground Turkey, added extra chili powder (This chili is not very spicy if you don't ad some extra to it) and we added Black Beans & Chili beans. We also used a mix of dark red kidney beans & light red kidney beans to add to some of that artsy side of cooking. :)

Never made chili before because it's never really that cold here, LOVED IT!  I topped with sour cream and served it with cornbread.

This is a great chili. My very picky husband, dad and brothers all loved it.  I did add 2 extra cloves of garlic (we love garlic) and used the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes that have garlic and other seasonings in them.

Awesome! The wife and I loved it. Changed a couple of things to are preference. Went 1 can of diced tomatoes, no green pepper (not fans of green pepper) and added 2 tspns of cumin and 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper to fire it up abit. May add more cayenne next time. This was my first chili I have ever made and it was the perfect recipe to use.

Made this for taco salads and it is very good.  I stayed pretty true to the recipe without having to go to the store.  My tomatoes were "seasoned for chili" flavor and I do not buy kidney beans, so I used mild chili beans in sauce.  The only addition I made was 1 tsp. of cumin.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be using it again!

This Chili was a hit. I used light and dark kidney beans added some anaheim peppers along with yellow and red chillies to the mixture. It was wonderful. I will definitely make this one again.

I found this recipe to be a good basic chili, but I added a few extra ingredients to make it amazing!  I added 2x the amount of chili powder, 2 tbs of oregano, and 3/4 cup of red wine!  This really brought out the otherwise bland flavor of the tomato base.  I also like a much spicier chili, so I added red pepper flakes, jalepenos, and siracha sauce.  YUM!

Good basic chili recipe. I added 2 tsp. ground cumin (as I think all chili needs cumin)...and substituted one can rotel for one of the cans of diced tomatoes. Gave the chili a little extra kick.

This was wonderful.  I increase all quantities and add about 2 tsp sugar, 1.5 tsp. cumin, and some green Tabasco sauce.  I also add some extra kidney beans.  Everyone who's tried this recipe loves it!

Makes a wonderful chili! A few minor changes- I only made it for two people so I cut the recipe in half. It doesn't have an abundance of flavor on its own, so I added another clove of garlic, crushed red pepper, and a whole lot more chili powder (didnt measure, just dumped!). I seasoned the meat heavily when browning. I also added 8oz. of tomato sauce per the other reviews saying it wasnt moist enough, and I think that did the trick. It has a wonderful dark, rich color and the house fills with the smell. I will make this one again!

My fiance and his study-buddies loved this chili.  He's a vegetarian so I left out the beef.  One of the cans of tomatoes had chili's in it and boy did that make the chili spicy! I little too much for me, which is why it only got four stars.  I will probably be making this recipe all winter long.

A favorite in our family.  I did tweak by adding 2 cups V8 Juice since we like our chili more soupy.  Also used a local restaurant chili powder mix.  Excellent and we make it over and over.

I cut the recipe in half and used about half the onion and green pepper.  I also added 1 tsp. Cumin, as some of the other reviewers suggested.  I loved the taste of this chili.  I am giving it a 4 because I would have liked a little more liquid in the final product.

This was delicious!! First time I made homemade chili. I do not like it spicy so this was perfect, I had guests over and they loved it. There were no leftovers. 
I am not too fond of tomatoes so I only added one can of diced tomatoes and it was plenty. I also used less onion.
I will definitely make again.

Delicious!!!  Whole family enjoyed this for a couple of meals.  Did not use green pepper because most of us do not like cooked green pepper and did not use cheese due to none in the house.  This is sure to be a regular in our home.

After 6 hours in the crockpot, I tasted it and found it a little bland.  So I added green onions, celery, oregano, paprika, red pepper flakes, increased the chili powder amount and a teaspoon of sugar (to neutralize the acidity of the canned tomato and sauce).  After all those additions, it was perfect for our taste buds.

I thought this was excellent-I read the reviews and added a packet of chili seasoning and used tomato sauce that had added chili seasoning in it as well.  I also was ready with some cornstarch on hand due to some reviews said it was a little watery-that took care of it nicely.  A very hearty chili but delicious.

Excellent recipe! I am new at "slow cooking", and it was pretty easy to make. I seasoned the ground beef in the skillet with Adobo and Sazon (found in the Goya section). I found these two seasonings make any meat taste better. I also added green chiles, cumin, crushed red pepper, and about 20 drops of Frank's Red Hot Sauce to the slow cooker.

I added 1 large can (30 oz?) tomato sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, 1 can corn, 1 can kidney beans, 1 can black beans, 1 small can of GREEN CHILLIES (I think this really gave it kick without adding too much "heat").
I also added CUMIN & extra garlic. Do a dollop of daisy (haha) and it's a hit.
I served this with homeade fat free ranch dressing alongside cut up veggies (tomato, bell pepper, cucumber, carrots) & french bread slices.
PERFECT for a long Friday, ready to walk in, sit down, and eat. Not to mention only my 3rd time using this crockpot. THANKS!

I made this a couple months ago and LOVED it! It made the house smell great and then I made fresh corn bread to serve it over. Even excellent as leftovers!

I used 1 pound of ground sirloin, added a little more tomato sauce and garlic, used only 1 can of diced tomatoes, and used a can of pinto beans, a can of kidney beans, and a can of chili beans with mild sauce. I also added a little oregano and basil. I'd never made chili in a slow cooker before, and I think that's what made all the difference. It was delicious!

This was so easy to make and it made the house smell wonderful!  It tasted great!  Added a bit more beans and meat to thicken things up, but outstanding!

Just okay.  I've tasted better and I'm not a  bean lover so I cut the beans in half and maybe that was what turned me off BUT my husband liked it so its not an all bad review.

This is a great and easy recipe.  I used ground turkey (it is cheaper and healthier than beef) and no one could tell the difference.  I served it to 4 hungry friends after a day on the ski slopes! 

I used 1 can of white beans and 1 can of kidney beans and also used McCormick chili mix (1.5 packets) since I was cooking at a bachelor pad and he does not have many spices.  Many people complained about it being runny or too thin for their tastes but I felt it was the perfect consistency.  I served it over elbow macaroni with cheese and sour cream.  A total hit!  I am making it again tonight to serve my boyfriend on a cold winter day in Chicago!

This is an awesome chili recipe! I also made a few variations, and it was wonderful. I left out the green pepper, used a bit more sauce and a can of chilis w/ tomatoes instead of just tomatos and added some pinto beans. Superb! Everyone ate it up.

My husband I LOVE this receipe. I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker at 9pm, I turn off at 5am and put in the fridge. By the time we get home and reheat it is so tasty. 
This is the easiest homemade chilli ever.

My husband & I never had great luck at making chili.  However, we made this and it was very good. I did change around the recipe a little.  I used diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of green peppers (as suggested by another member) & added a small can of tomato paste to thicken it up some.  Definetely a keeper here in this house!

I am not a chili-eater, but I made this recipe tonight for a house full of guests for the Superbowl and it got rave reviews.  I did everything according to the recipe, except... I added a packet of regular McCormick Chili Seasoning because others were complaining that it was too bland.  After doing this, all the guys were saying it was perfect.  I also cooked it on low for 8 hours.  It definitely left an impression.

This is definitely one of the best chili dishes I have tasted.  The only thing I added was extra chili powder.  It needs a little more of a kick to it for my tastes.  Excellent!

I got a slow cooker for christmas and it had been a while since i've had chili and i've never actually made it myself so i used this recipe.

It turned out great!  I made only a few changes.  I read that it tended to be a bit dry with the amount of tomato sauce used so i used about 14-18 oz of a "classic spicy tomato sauce".  I also added cumin and garlic pepper.  When i cooked the hamburger i cooked in some garlic and a few spices i like suchas the garlic pepper, garlic salt, and crushed red peppers.  Also i topped it with a blend of mexican shredded cheese on individual servings

It turned out great, i served it to about 6 people.  No complaints and very little left overs !

This is a great recipe.  Even the picky eaters in my family enjoyed it.  Also you can add in other ingredients such as mushrooms or mix up the beans to suit your tastes.

This was the first slow cooker recipe I ever tried having just gotten one for xmas.. and it came out great! The only thing I changed was to add an extra can of tomatoes, 2 peppers instead of 1 and 2.5 lbs of beef, since I had one of the bigger size pots I wanted to make a little extra. Everyone loved it. I think I'm gonna be using my crock pot a lot :)

This is great! I just found this recipe and have already made it twice.
I only use one can of kidney beans and I add a small can of corn, otherwise I keep the recipe pretty much as is.
Will be making this again!

The only modification I made in this recipe is that I added diced tomatoes with green chiles. It turned out awesome! It started tasting it just 1 hour into cooking and it was already amazing! Will definitely make this over and over!

My husband and I thought that the original recipe set a good foundation for a great chili. We recommend making the following changes:  4 cans diced tomatoes, undrained, 4 Tbs chili powder & 4 teaspoons salt. Every recipe needs a little tweeking to make it great!

Both my husband and I really liked this chili.  I did, however make some small changes-I added a packet of McCormick chili seasoning and put in a full 15 oz. can of tomato sauce.  It's a simple recipe that I'll make again!

I'm not sure that I can fairly rate this recipe because I'm not sure that I made this dish.  I tried to make it as written but instead of in the slow cooker, made it on the stove.  As I was putting the ingredients together, I was short of chili powder so used what I had (only 1T) and threw in some cayenne and red pepper to make up the rest.  Also, I didn't have any kidney beans so I used black beans.  I have to say that it was still pretty darn good.  In my opinion, a good recipe can take a little tweaking and substitutions and still come out.  This recipe definitely did that.  Served it with the shredded cheddar and sour cream.  Everyone ate up!!

I made this today and it is really good!  The only changes I made was instead of using garlic and onions I used garlic and onion salt.  It was good and ready to eat after 2 hours on high, then I turned it down to low for more hours and my son had some when he came home from work and really liked it a lot too!  If you like spicey chili, you may want to add some jalapenos or?  I didnt add this time, but probably would next time cause I like spicy food!  I think this chili comes out best on low for the longer time.... so make it before you go to work, put it on low and have a wonderful tasting chili waiting for you when you get home! mmmm mmmm good!

This is a wonderful chili.  I added two 7.5 oz. cans tomato paste, but it could have used a large can plus one small one.  I also added a small can of  corn. My family loved it!

This was really good. We left out the onion (my boyfriend doesn't like them) and used el pato sauce which is a mexican tomato sauce. We also added corn. It was a huge hit. everyone loved it.

I made this last night and everyone raved about it! I did change the ingredients a bit and used what I had in the cupboards. Used chili beans in place of kidney beans and I added some cumin too. Very good recipe! Will be making this again!

This was awesome!!!  I added corn, red pepper and jalepenos and it put just enough zing into it - which is what we like!!!  I cooked it on low - in my slow cooker.  It made enough that we made chili dogs one night and put it over a baked potato another night!  My boyfriend liked it so much he asked me to make another batch so he could take it to work with him the next week!

Fast, easy and delicious!  We don't really like hot and spicy chili so this was perfect.  Only added a dash of oregano.

This was pretty good, although I took some of the reviewers advice and went heavy on the seasoning. I even seasoned the ground beef while I cooked it. I added almost 3 pounds of ground beef, and only 1 can of beans since my husband doesn't really care for chili with  beans. I also doubled the tomato sauce because I look the flavor and I added a can of mild chili's. My husband likes heat so I cut and de-seeded a jalepeno and threw it in there whole to cook with the chili. Turned out pretty good! Would make again, really easy!

I really loved this recipe, but my husband thought it was bland and boring.  I recommend spicing it up quite a bit if you want more than a very mild chili.  Great base though.

Perfecto.  I thought the flavor was awesome.  Cooked all day on low.  Kids even ate it.  Amazing.  Mine seemed kind of thick when I assembled it in the morning so I just went ahead and added a little water (and about half a can of beer because why not?) and it turned out supurb.  I didn't have a green pepper, but it was still great.

I love this recipe.  It tastes like my favorite canned chili....only so much better homemade.  I used 1 lb. ground turkey (misread the ingredients calling for 2 lbs.) instead of beef and thought it was going to be way too watery but after 3 hours on high, it looked awesome.  I let it cook for another hour and served it over baked potatoes.  YUM!  I love the simplicity and the taste.  I prefer the subtle chili flavor and the mild flavor made it a bigger hit with the kids.

Good recipe.  The only thing I changed is I didn't use the minced garlic I used garlic salt. And didn't use the kidney beans cuz my family don't like them.  It was a family hit!!

First time chili maker.  Long time taster.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and I could not tell the difference.  My girlfriend and I ate the whole thing in one day.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Thank you!
