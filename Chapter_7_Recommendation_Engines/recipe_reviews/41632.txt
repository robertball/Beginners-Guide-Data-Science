This is an absolutely fabulous recipe.  Cooked it tonight and will cook it again for a dinner party this weekend.  I used fresh tomato,and fresh corn off the cob (lots in season right now) and half a yellow zucchini for the two of us.

Simple and delidious! Awesome to use up all the zucchini and tomatoes from the garden. I used grated parmesean cheese instead of monterey jack. Quite good.

This was pretty good stuff. I used frozen corn, and also added some mushrooms that were starting to get old. The only other thing that I did differently was to sprinkle parmesan cheese over it rather than using the shredded cheeses. I'll definitely be making this for my family again.

This was a delicious way to prepare zucchini.  Even though it's a bit difficult to reheat with the cheese on top, I found it just as good the second time.  I halved it and omitted the corn so that I didn't waste 2 cans half-ful.

Delicious! I saut√©ed the onions first and then added the zucchini, just because I didn't want them to turn mushy.

This was delish. I used fresh garlic, olive oil, and added some rosemary. Even the kids enjoyed it. Thanks!

My husband and I tried this out and just loved it.  We made it exactly as directed and turned out great.  The two of us managed to eat the whole thing.  Next time we'll use a little less cheese and maybe some black beans for texture.  This is a definite keeper!!

I have not made this in quite a while. I was so glad I decided to make it for dinner since hubby was home and could enjoy a hot meal. We love this simple yet delish dish. I used Queso Fresco cheese just before the veggies are done and break it into small chunks. This cheese does not melt away,  like cheddar/ jack does, it's a mild Mexican cheese that is terrific. I also chopped up a half a bunch of cilantro to add at the end, just long enough to warm it up. This dish is always welcome in my kitchen. Thank You LeeLee Excellent job!

This was a very good dish.  I used two zucchini, one onion and two tomatoes because there were only two of us. It did not reheat as well as I would have liked.  I will make this again.

I thought this was pretty good as a side.  I used fresh chopped garlic and added a little dried oregano, but otherwise made as is and it was enjoyed by all.

I'd say 3 1/2 stars as is.  I thought this was a little bland and that there was too much cheese.  If I was to make this again, I think I would use fresh garlic, instead of powder and cut back the cheese by at least half.  It is a very pretty dish though!

Very tasty! I used fresh corn in place of frozen and cut the recipe down to 4 servings. I only used 1/2 cup of cheese total and after cooking my zucchini and onions in the skillet, transferred everything to a baking dish and put it in the oven while I grilled. Whole family loved it- will make again using fresh tomatoes.

I'm always looking for different veggie sides and this was very good. I did use fresh garlic and I didn't use as much cheese as listed. I sprinked a healthy hand full of shredded mexican blend cheese (because that's what I had on hand) and some parmesan on top and mixed it in.

Loved it . . . especially with fresh veggies from our garden.  My children love making it with me and call it ratatouille!  Whatever works!  They eat it ALL every time!

I don't think I have ever had a zucchini dish that I haven't liked, I just LOVE it! This recipe is great - easy to prepare and if you cut back on the cheese a little it's pretty healthy. To be honest, I didn't add all of the cheese, we added the amount we wanted after we dished up our individual servings. My three year old also loved it, and had two big helpings! Great recipe, thank you for sharing, Leelee!

Thought this was a decent dish.  I did cook the onions first before adding the zucchini because we like it with a little harder texture to it and didn't want it to turn to mush.  I added the zucchini the same time I added the corn and tomatoes.  Used about half the amount of cheese and that was plenty.  Next time I think i'll use fresh garlic as well.

Outstanding ... almost a complete meal in itself. Sauteed 8-ounces of fresh sliced mushrooms in with the zucchini and onion. Yum, yum! Requires a VERY LARGE skillet.

This is the one dish my mom always made for us growing up that I looked forward to eating EVERY time. It's so delicious. On a side note, down here in the southwest, we call this dish "calabasitas" (kal-a-bah-see-tas).

A little mushy and a strange blend of flavors.  I like my zucchini very tender (which it was), but my husband only tasted this because I made him.  He prefers his zucchini al dente and thought the whole mixture was weird.

Not mentioned in the recipe, but I drained my vegetables before I added the cheese.

So yummy, but oh so full of calories from the cheese.  Next time I'll put in less cheese and see if its just as good.

This is one of my favorite zuccini recipes.  I make it almost exactly as listed here, only I add a diced jalapeno or two.  I also just use a sprinkle of shredded cheese (whatever's in the fridge at the time).  I LOVE IT!

This is a quick and easy recipe that was very delicious and satisfying. I used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar and Monterrey jack to keep it a little bit lighter. Used 2 tsp of union powder & 2 tsp of garlic powder. Got a lot of complements on it.

I HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS FOR YEARS.  GREAT FOR USING FRESH TOMATOES ALSO.  AND IF YOU ADD A SMALL TOUCH OF KNORR CHICKEN SEASONING IT MAKES A VERY TASTY MEAL.  I CAN SOMETIMES GET THE FAMILY TO EAT IT LIKE THE MEAT PORTION OF THE MEAL.

I really enjoyed this. I adjusted this recipe for 2 people and used 1 large zucchini, 1/4 of a onion, 1/2 a can of corn and 1/2 a can of Contadina diced tomatoes with garlic and basil. I used parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of the sharp cheddar...I think next time I will try fresh tomatoes and add my own garlic and spices because it was a little juicy for me. We actually ended up putting this on top of our chicken and it made a great sauce as well as side dish.  Loved it and will try again exactly as written when I have the correct ingredients on hand.  Thanks!

This recipe is delicious! My husband and I both loved it!  We are garlic lovers so I added minced garlic as well as the garlic powder. It was very flavorful. Yum!!!

Not bad!  It'll be better in a few more months when fresh tomatoes are in season!  I used some canned tomatoes as well as a handful of grape tomatoes that I needed to use up.  I also chopped up a handful of mushrooms & added some fresh garlic.

Used fresh garlic and a pinch of italian seasoning in addition to the salt and pepper.  Used frozen corn instead of canned.  Only used a sprinkle of cheese over the top.  It was pretty good - might use even more seasoning though next time.

This is a great recipe to use as a basic starter recipe.  I used zucchine and yellow squash, corn,mushrooms and added some sliced olives..I then added a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes..It made a really nice sauce to have over pasta.  My husband loved it and so did I.  We will have this again.

This was a hit at our home.  Perfect way to use up squash from the garden.  Even my 4yr old ate it.  We told him it was "Ratatouille".  I didn't add as much cheese, just scattered it on top once I was done cooking.  This probably made it easy to reheat the next day.  We will DEFINITELY make this again.

I saw this recipe on the "recipe exchange" here on this site and decided to give it a try. Since some thought it was mushy, I chopped my own tomatoes and used frozen corn.  After reading reviews, and to make it healthier, I just sprinkled it with parmesan cheese.  A good recipe that is nice change from the same old boring steamed veggies I usually serve.

I halved this and it was still plenty for my husband and I.  It was very good and I had the leftovers the next day and I found it reheated great!  I am making them again for a dinner party and am still going to half the recipe and use a full can of corn instead of the tomatoes since one of the guests hates tomatoes.  Hope it still turns out okay.

My husband, 5 year old grandson, and I loved this! I used one medium large zucchini and tomatoes from our garden, fresh garlic and corn I cut off the cob. I used butter instead of margarine. I followed the recipe except for using the fresh ingredients instead of canned. It was so easy and cheesy. As I was putting away the few leftovers, I could have eaten the rest right then, but I made myself save it for tomorrow's lunch. Thank you!

This turned out really great. I was looking to use up some leftover zucchini and decided to throw in some mushrooms and cauliflower that were getting old as well as two cans of tuna. I also added some cumin and rosemary - my family LOVED it!

Big hit at the dinner table.  Next time I will leave out the corn because it seemed to be thrown in for the heck of it.  I think that it would have been fine without it.  I used less cheese too and used cheddar and mozzarella (instead of the montary jack).  Also, I added 3 cloves of fresh garlic, chopped.

A bit bland, but the zucchini and corn are a lovely pair - I'll have to play with this recipe a bit to figure out how to bring out the flavors. This time I just sprinkled with taco seasoning and used 2% Mexican blend cheeses, which was good, but I think something nice could be achieved with a blend of fresh herbs. My fiance liked it and is bringing some to lunch tomorrow, so that's a good sign!

This was great. I had a ton of zucchini to use up from the garden. I added some fresh chopped basil and parsley. I also added a chicken bullion cube for more flavor. I had about 3 cups of left-over rice that I mixed in.

Instead of vegetable oil, I used extra virgin olive oil. Instead of garlic powder, minced garlic. Adn natural tomatoes. And Colby and Monterrey Jack cheese.
It is so juicy, all vegetables are tender, it is a wow!!

This was really yummy!  Tha bacon gave it a southern flavor that my family really liked.  Even the picky ones who refused to eat squash loved it!

This is a good way to use up zucchini but it wasn't very flavorful. I especially didn't like the melted cheeses on top. Another reviewer suggested parmesan and that would have been better, less heavy.

Loved it! I am not really a big zucchini fan but this tasted great. It turned out perfect not mushy at all. Just make sure your canned food is fully drained.

very tasty!  My own innovation adds tator tots and mushrooms for a mid-day snack.
