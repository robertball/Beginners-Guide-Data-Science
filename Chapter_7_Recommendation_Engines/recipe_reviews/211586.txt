I also doubled the Worcestershire sauce but also used an extra teaspoon of ground rosemary.  Definitely more tasty.

There is nothing wrong with this recipe. If you taste it at the end and it's bland, it's because you can't cut the hot sauce. Even if you hate spicy food you have to add a little to bring out the flavors of everything that's in it. I cut the recipe in half, doubled the Worcestershire sauce, used 1 can of celery soup and added about 1/8t dried cayenne pepper to it in place of the hot sauce. I have a very low tolerance to spice, but this small amount was fine, I just borrowed it from my roommate. Even with the hot pepper it had no fire at all.

I hate to rate something so low but as is, the recipe is horrible. I scaled it down to 10 servings. I sauteed some red peppers and celery to add some crunch. But it was so thick after everything was in, there wasn't anything to simmer. I had to add over a cup of water to get it right. Also, it was very bland. I had to add the rest of the can of tomato soup, cumin, a little brown sugar and more PP spice. I used hot chili sauce in place of hot pepper sauce. After my changes it was actually pretty decent, but the recipe is not good. Sorry.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe! All you have to do is make it and let it sit in the fridge over night to let the flavors come together! Our town has a pumpkin festival every year and we always host a pumpkin party during it. I made this for one of the main dishes and it was devoured! Everyone loved it! Don't let the reviews scare you, it's an excellent recipe.

I used turkey instead of beef, so this is probably my own fault, but here is my review after knowing that info.... As written, this recipe is very bland.  I at least doubled all of the spices, and still found it to be bland.  I recommend being very liberal with the spices, and then also adding some ketchup and pepper.  After doing that it was good. Not amazing, but a good hearty fall meal.

This is simply the most disgusting thing and does not make any logical sense and taste
