I make the same recipe.  If I have time, I marinate the jalape√±o and onion in lime juice for at least a couple of hours.  It is good even without chips and often, I eat half for my lunch. When I make mine, I use one avocado.  I thnk leaving the avocado in chunks rather than mashing enhances the eating experience.  This is a very healthy guacamole.  All good!

My mother-in-law made a similar recipe for the 4th of July and it was a hit!  I immediately began searching for a mock recipe and came across this.   A light yet highly addictive treat that is perfect for warmer weather. I added more lime juice (because you can never have enough lime) but the recipe stands on its own perfectly!
