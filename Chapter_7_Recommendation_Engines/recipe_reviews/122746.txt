I used sugar free Country Time PINK lemonade mix, "light" cranberry juice and sugar free Sierra Mix in this punch. My kids and I drank the whole pitcher in 15 minutes, though Mommy added a jigger of vodka to her cup before adding the punch. None of us even noticed I'd used lighter ingredients--this was VERY refreshing. We're on our second pitcher.

Lemon-Berry Pitcher Punch was tasty. It was very simple and used ingredients that weren't too strange. I prefer punch with a carbonated ingredient and without sherbet/ice cream, so this was good for me.

DELICIOUS!! I used this for a family party of 25 and everyone LOVED it! Very fresh and tasty. I did use cran-raspberry juice. Thanks Margaret! I'm hosting another party and my 6 year old asked me to serve it again.
Update... I forgot to mention that I actually doubled the cran-raspberry juice to about 1 & 1/3 cups. It made it more flavorful.

I realize why this is titled "pitcher punch". If a friend is stopping by unexpectedly, and you're looking to jazz up powdered lemonade, this recipe may be for you. It tastes like (don't you wish there were a "Taste Now" button to click on these sites? anyway...) a slightly fruity lemonade. Powdered lemonade, that is. I made this recipe for a large crowd. It wasn't bad, but consensus was a flat "three stars". However, it may be much better with real lemonade concentrate and/or frozen cranberry concentrate.

This was pretty good.  I used frozen lemonade in place of the powdered and I doubled the cranberry juice.

I used this recipe for a beach themed bridal shower and it went over very well. It's a good thing it was so simple, I went through 2 canisters of lemonade to keep up with demand! I did use cran-raspberry juice and garnished with lemon slices and fresh red raspberries. Very nice!
