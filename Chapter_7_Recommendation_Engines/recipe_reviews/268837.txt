10.28.18 The sauce was VERY thick and I did add more milk (used skim milk what I had on hand which worked well) to thin it out for fear that if too thick you d just have a glob on top of the cauliflower and it wouldn t coat the cauliflower well. I did give the florets a quick toss in the sauce before spooning into the baking dish. Unfortunately by steaming the cauliflower until tender then baking for 30 minutes resulted in mushy cauliflower so I would recommend that you don t steam your cauliflower until it s really done. I used Italian panko bread crumbs and the topping was just crisp enough at 35 minutes. Super simple to make and pretty darn tasty just a little tweaking to make it 5 stars.

I thickened the sauce with corn starch as I am gluten free. The cauliflower and topping turned out well but the sauce was rather tasteless. I won t make it again.
