I only had baby bok choy, but tried to make the dish anyway. I cooked it for far less time, basically just enough time to get them on the grill, butter them, flip them over, butter them, then cook for a little bit. Some of the leaves did get a little burnt, but it was still amazingly delicious!

The key here is hot heat and fast. It keeps the thick part of the bok choy nice and crunchy and the leafy part crispy like a potato chip.  Nice blend of seasonings.  I used baby boy choy which  I cut in half lengthwise.  This is a make-again.

I could not believe how good this was! I put the bok choy into a grilling basket and kept stirring and basting it with the seasoned butter as it grilled. It took up less room on the grill that way

My husband and I thought this was pretty good. I used baby bok choy and olive oil instead of butter... mixed the basting ingredients in a bowl prepared the bok choy leaves added them to the bowl and massaged the oil throughout the leaves. I put the leaves directly on the grill. The ends of the leaves came out crunchy and a little burnt the stalks were warm and tender. There were some bitterness probably from the burnt pieces but not all of the burnt parts were bitter. It was good and I'll probably make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Just the change I was looking for from saut√©ing this veggie. I found the basting brush difficult to use on the leaves while grilling so I just put it all in a covered bowl with the ingredients and shook it around. Worked great and less work. Served with hamburgers and hot dogs. Yum!

Because of the pouring rain tonight I grilled this on my indoor grill. I also blanched the bok choy for just a minute or two first in salted boiling water. I used 1 1/2tblspns of olive oil instead of 1/4c of butter (I wanted to keep the fat content way down) kept the spices the same except the season salt which I used half of and just 1/8tsp of fresh black pepper. Submitter has it down twice so I used the lesser. Thought 1tspn was extreme. Added red hot pepper flakes to mine. I enjoyed this! Might be better with baby bok choy since it may be more tender. Looking forward to making again and grilling outside for a more smokey taste.

My son and I loved this got him to try a new veggie! You could flavor it with whatever you like it mostly tastes like the oil/butter seasoning you use. I used fresh garlic.

Didn't love this. But I agree with another reviewer...I just think I don't love Bok Choy. It was a little soggy too?

This was really pretty good. I loved it and it had the wonderfully smoky flavor of the bbq. I made it next to the chicken I was grilling off. Quick and easy. Thank You Nom Nom for getting us to think Outside the box!

Made this along with some kabobs the other day and it was a big hit. My 2 year-old devoured his share. I did cut down on the salt and used a spice medley from Penzey's to supplement.

We've never had bok choy before but received some in our farmer's market veggie/fruit basket this week. We tried it with this recipe. I think the recipe itself was good but none of us really liked the veggie. Served with grilled steaks baked potatoes and biscuits.

I really liked this. It was crisp and flavourful and perfect with vegetable fried rice. My husband didn't like it as much but he doesn't like cooked leafy greens so that's not surprising. I would happily eat this every week. Thanks for the great recipe!

I chopped all of the Bok Choy and put in a ziploc bag with all of the ingredients. I also added some mushrooms. I let this marinate for about an hour and then put in on the grill in a grill basket. The texture was great just seemed to be lacking in flavor. Next time I will add a little heat.

I'm not a fan of this one. The stalks were too chewy and they were too smokey flavored. I couldn't really taste the vegetable.

We liked the flavor of the leaves the best. A few leaves got a little charred. You have to keep an eye on your grill while cooking!

Holy Bok Choy! I prepared this according to the recipe except I added 1 Tbsp. of balsamic oil to the melted butter - then finished it off with a little grated parmigiano right after I removed it from the grill. Delicious!

This was amazing. My fiance who usually picks the bok choy out anything I make with it ate seconds! Go easy on the seasoning salt as it can get a little bit salty. Maybe unsalted butter too? The grilled flavor was amazing and the bok choy really picked up the flavor. Thank!

Being the first time I have ever eaten bok choy I made the recipe exactly. I found it to be incredibly salty and we had nearly a tablespoon of the seasoning mix left over. Saltier than dried seaweed but next time I will cut the salt back by half and try again as it had potential.

We found that the bok choy burned on the grill before the stalks became tender enough to eat. Our grill is older and hard to perfectly control temp but on med-high we had charred leaves and tough stems. Best to start on lower part of grill and finish on upper racks. I ended up pan-searing the bok choy because I could get a bit of char but then cover it to finish cooking it through.

That was awesome! Thanks! Only thing I did differently was put it in a veggie basket. Next time will add onion and maybe mushrooms. But this really was good.

I rather liked bok choy grilled.. It brings out a whole new flavour. I had 12 baby bok choys and felt that the amount of butter would be too much so I used only 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of avocado oil. I kept everything the same with the exception of the extra pepper. Will definitely grill bok choy again but will play with flavours. Thanks for the idea

We thought this was a nice way to prepare bok choy. I do like my stalks a little more tender so next time I might blanch first. Thanks for a new idea NomNomDelicious.

My hubby LOVED this and he rarely will eat veggies. SO nice to have another veggie to make. Made it two ways used olive oil for half and butter for the other half. Both were great. Followed suggestion to put all in a bowl and coat the leaves first. Saves me basting in the dark. Definitely will make again.

Super delicious!  I never knew what to do with the bok choy that came in my CSA box.  I came across this recipe & it's one of my favorites.  The leaves are like addicting potato chips  - you can't eat just one!  The only caveat is that you need to eat them right away.  If you try to keep them "warm," they will just get soggy.  I seldom make the entire amount of bok choy & usually cut the butter recipe in half.  So yummy.
