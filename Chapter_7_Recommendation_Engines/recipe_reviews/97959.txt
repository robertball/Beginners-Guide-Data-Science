Holy cow! I was a little interested in this drink when I first read about it because my husband is a lover of whiskey. I couldn't believe how well the flavors blended together! It's a great drink that will sneak up on you quick! My husband also loves it!

I don't care much for whisky but I wanted to try this. Odd phenomenon for me is that while there isn't too much apple flavor it's a good blend to cut the bite of the alcohol without making it all fruity sweet. Good compromise if you're looking for one.

Try apple cider instead of juice if you want a stronger apple flavor it gives it more of an earthy taste that will knock you on your butt if you don't watch it.

It's not bad, the apple juice cuts the wiskey, but doesn't do much for the flavor. Easy ingredients.

Try with a dash of pumpkin pie spice. Even better warmed up.

I was looking for something to mix my honey whiskey in. when she said apple juice I was like “hellz ya!”

I added cinnamon and used Honey Whiskey instead of plain. 

Tastes like apple pie! Goes down too easy

Have drank apple jack's for many decades. Was always known as apple cider with Yukon Jack. Not a new drink.
