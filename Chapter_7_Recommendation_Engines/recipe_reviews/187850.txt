my advice to people is when I learned this recipe at like 8 years old, I took the bread buttered it both sides, and took a small mouth glass and pressed down to cut the perfect circle (hole) in the middle of the bread, put it on the stove and added the egg to the hole, salt and peppered, flipped and cooked the little cut out circle as well.  it never burned.  Never even tried bacon, I was too little then lol.

This was breakfast after my muffins tanked. It's always a comforting breakfast (my dad made it for me when I was a kid) but it was made even better with the use of bacon grease. Is there anything bacon can't make better? I don't think so. ;)

Excellent.  I'm 50 years old and had never heard of this before.  I prepared it for my husband this morning and he loved it.  I used a fork to mix the egg a couple times as it cooked so it wasn't as runny.  I was a little short on bacon grease so I added a little butter to the grease.  I put the extra bread rounds in another skillet, and quickly sauted them in butter with cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top, flipping them once -- a delicious and easy addition to this already yummy breakfast.

Egg in a hole, egg in a boat...so many different names for this!  It's very good.  Simple to make too.  I turn down the heat after I put the egg in and cover with a lid for a few minutes or untill the white and most of the yolk is cooked.  I sometimes scramble the egg before putting it in the hole (kids like it this way)I don't use bacon grease, although I'm very sure that it would be really good that way..Mmmm. I just use butter or margarine.  THX.

So many names for an old classic.  To me it has always been Toad in a Hole.  I now use olive oil for the extra flavor.  Thanks for reminding  me that my snack or quick lunch can be full of protein and very tasty. A little fruit on the side completes it.

Delicious and easy for breakfast! Great way to combine your eggs and toast together plus it's a nice departure from the usual scrambled egg. I opted out of cooking this in bacon grease and just used a little melted butter. I waited until the egg was cooked and added a slice of cheese. Great with a side of Canadian bacon and OJ!

My mother made this for us as kids back in the 1960's.  We called it "hole in the middle"....never used bacon grease...only butter.  Nice with day or two day old bakery bread...not just white grocery store bread.  Seeing this recipe brought back warm, cherished memories from my childhood. Note: use a drinking glass to make the hole

We called these "Eggs In The Nest" in the "old" days; let's just say we have been making these for 55 years! LOL.

Anyway, we, too, butter both sides of the bread and then place the bread, along with the buttered cut out "hole", in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the first side till lightly brown and flip the bread and "hole" and THEN add the egg and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook until you see the egg white "whiten" and begin to bubble and then flip the bread and egg over to cook slightly longer for that "over easy", no uncooked egg white, finish. Serve with the "hole" replaced and voila! "Egg In The Nest" heaven!

5 stars for being easy and tasty. I toasted the holes along side and used them for mopping up the yolk. Might crack my egg a little sooner next time to ensure completely done whites.

My son-in-law made these one night and I have loved them since then. They are easy but you get the egg and toast at the same time. Great for day or night.

We call these Pirate's Eyes. Cut hole in plain bread with a small juice glass. Butter bread. Place in pan sprayed with Pam. Drop egg in. Cook until bread is golden brown, and egg is just over easy. 
(runny yolk). Add maple syrup and eat! Delicious every time, and a kid favorite!

I do these with French bread and add some parmesan or romano cheese to the cooked side when I flip them. Once that side is done, I flip the parmesan side down for a minute or so to toast the parmesan and make it crusty!
The taste and consistency are awesome and fun!

Takes only minutes for a super quick breakfast.  I sometimes smother them in chili and shredded cheese for my husband.  My teenager makes two and then stacks them on top of each other with a slice of cheese in the middle.  Delish!

Like many others I have been making these for years! My newest fun with it is to butter the bread, fold it over, let my granddaughter bite the middle out so she thinks she is helping!

We call them "Egg Islands" or "Toast Swimming Pools" and always use Lawry's seasoning salt. Try them that way! I think you'll find that they are eggcellent!

We call this "egg in a nest" and I learned to prepare it exactly as Charlotte (using a glass to cut the holes, buttering on both sides and grilling the cut out piece as well).  Kids love to help prepare these.

Egg in a Frame.  I learned from my parents a half century ago.  
- The frame supports the egg to some extent so even non-expert egg flippers can have an egg 'over easy'.  
- Definitely toast the center.  
- We use a biscuit cutter to cut the hole in the bread.  
- Instead of bacon grease, we butter both sides of the bread before placing in the pan.
- After the the bread has been flipped, you can 'step' on the egg with the flipper to break the yolk for those that don't want a runny yolk.

I've made these for years.  I use a shot glass to make the hole in the bread.  Put a little bit of butter melted in the pan, next the bread and then break the egg into the center.  I just look to make sure it gets a bit firm and then flip it over for the other side.  EASY!  I have never used bacon grease but to each his own.  My kids loved it and they still make it for themselves now.  Some like the egg really firm others a bit looser.

As a kid in the 50's, I loved this breakfast! My brother made these and used low heat to get the whites cooked - a must for us. The bigger the hole, the more cooked the egg. Great memories. Now I'm going to remember to make these for the grandkids!

I first learned how to PEEK-A-BOO eggs from my Girl Scout Leader Aunt, when I was around 7 or 8.  I butter one side of the bread and put it in the pan, then I cut the hole out with a small juice glass or a small mushroom can which has both ends cut off.  I butter this side including the hole cut out hole and fry the bread until it's lightly golden.  Flip over all the pieces and put a dot of butter in the cut out hole.  Drop your egg in the middle and cook until the white is mostly cooked.  Flip the egg and bread until the rest of the egg is cooked.  It's easy to over cook and leave you with a hard cooked egg so use your finger to check the egg it should be slightly squishy.  To serve I always put the grilled little cut out back on top of the egg.  Small children always like to lift the lid and say Peek-A-Boo.

This brought back a nice memory of my childhood. We called them eggs in a nest. I don't use bacon grease now (though my mother did when I was child), I use margarine. I also use a glass to make the hole and I use either rye bread or whole wheat. It just holds up better and has great taste and texture with the egg.

My mom used to make me this, & I still love it! I make it for myself because my husband doesn't like runny eggs. My mother used butter & called in an "egg in a frame". I usually use olive oil to fry my eggs nowadays, but for this recipe, butter is best.

Yes, many names.  My Dad called them Hobo Eggs, my husband calls them Toad in the Hole.  I make them with Thomas' Bagel Thins, but you have to enlarge the hole!  Butter, butter, butter.  After flipping over I put a thin slice of ham on top, and cover skillet until the ham is warm.

My mother made these for me when I was a little girl.  She spread the bacon grease on to the bread on both sides, and used a juice glass to cut the hole.  She cooked it the same way as this recipe.  Oh, and don't forget to cook the hole.  It tastes yummy too!

Used to fix this and "eggs in a basket" for my kids all the time. Put refrigerated, raw and rolled flat biscuits in muffin pad, add egg, salt and pepper and bake until white is done.  YUM

My boyfriend makes these for breakfast all the time and they always come out sooo delicious. I recommend using butter instead of the grease, but thats just my preference. We also sprinkle a little garlic pepper and some salt on the egg before its flipped.

It was fun to read about allthe the memories and different names people have for this dish. For us, this has been a camping favorite for years. You can keep it simple....or for an extra treat, I criss-cross two almost-cooked bacon slices on the griddle and I dip the french toast bread with the hole cut out in our french toast batter and then center it on the bacon. Break the egg in the center and then flip. Bacon, egg and french toast in one. Serve with warm syrup....yum. Mmmm now I want some. :)

Definitely a 5* as my kids would say. We all enjoyed it for years. A few short cuts: LIGHTLY toast the sliced bread first, cut a perfect size circle in middle of toast by putting toast on cutting board and pressing down with lip of a glass the same size as hole you want, serve that cutout toast on the side for dipping, brush melted butter or olive oil on both sides of toast then fry. When first side is hot, flip and add the egg to the middle. Cook til egg is done to personal satisfaction - serve hot!

I still have my 8th grade steno recipe book I had in Home Ec class (I'm 63 now) with this recipe in it. I had forgotten about it until this post. Thanks for the reminder.  It was one of the items I really liked back then and is so easy to prepare.

Don't limit yourself to a round hole. I posted a picture this morning with a heart cutout, using a cookie cutter. The bread shape you cut out can be toasted or grilled and then served with your eggs. Add a little love to your breakfast!

I used butter instead of bacon grease and it was AMAZING. I can only imagine bacon grease would make it better. I placed the egg in the hole as soon as I set the toast in the pan because I like my eggs well done. Worked out great.

I grew up calling this "Sunshine Toast" it was a favorite then as it is still today.  This simple breakfast has many creative titles and is just as versatile in preparation.   Add bacon or ham bits, and cheese, scramble the eggs first for those of us who don't like runny eggs.  For a fancier breakfast top with a slice of ham and hollandaise, then serve with hash browns. Fast and easy to make and then eat while running out the door in a rush.  In other words, make it so you like it!

Nothing is as good as a warm egg with a runny yolk!  My tip would be to slightly PRE-toast the bread!  It makes it a little firmer and quicker to fry.  I ALWAYS pretoast my bread when making french toast.  It makes it more firm AND soaks up more of the yummy egg mixture!

Never made it with bacon grease always butter.  We called it hole in the bread.  I add a slice of cheese as soon as it comes out of the pan and serve it with corned beef hash fried crisp and OJ.  Love it.  Nice childhood memories.

I have been making these for years.  I use butter, & my OLD buscuit cutter to make the hole.  I also toast the 'hole'.  I always called it 'egg in the basket'.  I now have to puree my food and these are easy to swallow if you add milk, syrup, or other thinning liquid to puree it.

It's been around for decades. We call it "Oeuf dans le trou". 
Thick garlic bread (Costco sales it) brings your taste buds to a different level. 
No matter what bread you use, it's yummy!! 
And it's the best way to eat your eggs, without a fork, fingers licking good.

Simply one of the best breakfasts. Fun and easy. I like dredging the bread with cinnamon like french toast first, adding maple syrup on the plate. Don't forget to cook the little rounds, too.

This is one of my favorites.  Cheap and easy to make and everyone loves them!  We called it a "bird's nest" and my dad used to make these for us all the time.  I always use spray from a can so it doesn't stick, as I am not too fond of grease, but you can add a bit of any oil you would like to give it extra flavor and cook the bread with a more crunchier outside.

Having the mindset I would not enjoy this I was surprised! I'm not a big fan of bacon grease and was hesitant in using it. Although, I really liked this I probably won't do the the bacon grease on a regular basis when making these. Also, I cracked the egg into the hole when I first put the bread in the skillet. It still had a runny yolk when it was done which I liked.

I've been making this for years. Since I rarely have bacon, I use butter instead. I have a big kid (husband) who doesn't like runny yellows so I break his yolk and make sure it is very hard before serving, but for the rest of us, sopping up the left-over yellow with the cut out hole is the best part.

Brings me back to my childhood.  My dad would make these, and he called them "Eggs Popeye".  Instead of cutting a hole, each child would bite a hole out out of the center of their bread before cooking!  Janis L.

I am now 60 and I can remember my mother fixing this for me when I was sick. The only difference is she used butter instead of bacon grease. She also toasted the part that came out of the hole. I would love if my Mom could make this for me again. Good food! Better memories!

I too was a kid when my mom made this for us in the 50's. We called it "An Egypcian Eye Sandwich." We always had to wink through the hole before cooking. I came from an old black and white movie from the 40"s. I'm still searching for that movie -- with no luck.

Family enjoyed it....omitted the bacon grease and used a little butter instead. Also toasted up the "cut round" in the buttered pan as well and used for dipping in the egg yolk. Used whole wheat bread. Thanks!

We call them "Bird in a Nest"! We first saw these when Cher was making them in the movie 'Moonstruck'. We make ours (as they did) with thick sliced Italian bread, buttered on bothe sides. I use real butter to fry them in but I'm sure bacon grease would be just wonderful! I also, as others state, fry the circles to enjoy along side the bird in the nests. Everyone loves these!! :)

I used unsalted butter instead of grease. Easy. Fast. Hot. Yum. I was still hungry after one though, so I had another. This made a great hot breakfast in minutes.

This has been a favorite for decades.  With a non-stick skillet, I don't add grease, though.  Recently had some garlic butter left over and use it - delicious! I prefer wheat or oatnut bread, too, but you can't beat this for a good breakfast.

These are so yummy! I have been eating them since I was little. My dad always made them for me before school and called them Humpty Dumpty's! I always thought he made them up, but I guess he lied! I always put grape jelly on the leftover toast circle for a little breakfast dessert!  Wonderful quick breakfast and fun for kids of all ages!

This is a long time favorite of our family. We called it Birds Nest. I use butter or margarine in a skillet, cut the hole in the bread and dip both sides of the bread into the melted butter before putting the eggs in the middle. I also throw the bread I cut out for the holes into the pan to toast and we use them to dip into the soft yolks. Delicious.

In our household this was called Hens egg in toast.
One first made English style toast and removed a center placed the toast in a buttered copper skillet and dropped in an egg.
My experience with Toad in the Hole was a classic English recipe which was basically a pancake with a cooked sausage rolled inside.  Therefore, the toad is in its hole.
There is also Egg in a Glass.  Another great breakfast.  Also Shirred Eggs.

MEMORIES Sweet Memories!  I'm almost 64 years old and you brought me back to my childhood.  If I remember correctly I took the recipe from a Kids Betty Crocker Cook Bood, infact I still have it somewhere.  I'll see if I can find it and post it.
How I made it was I'd butter one slice of the WONDER Bread, flip it butter the other side,cut out the middle.  Then put the frame in the fry pan, add the egg and fry until the underside of the bread was golden. Oh yes I did fry the hole.  When the second underside browned out out of the pan it came.  Then the fun would start.  I'd break the creamy yolk and dig in. Ya' know I think I know what I'll for my B'day breakfast 1/25.  Think I'll make a more mature version and use a whole grain bread.

We called this "Egg in the Nest". Only used butter. To make the hole we just tore a piece of the inside bread, never got that technical and used a glass! We all fought over this part as we fried it as well!

I have been eating these since the 60's also when my mom received the recipe. Then it was called "port hole" cause it came from ppl that lived on a boat. I always used butter on the bread before frying and used a knife to move white of egg around a bit so it would cook completely. Try it with a bit a cheese sprinkled on top...always yummmmy!

I have cooked eggs this way during my 40 year marriage.  I do not know where I learned it because I never had it growing up.  I called it Egg in Toast, but my kids say it was called Egg in a Basket.  Any name you give it is fun, and it's delish cooked in bacon grease or butter.  I butter the bread on both sides, cut the circle with a glass, add the egg, and fry it all up.  The circles are the BEST, for some reason.  I may scramble the egg next time as one reader does.

My dad made these for me as a kid, and still makes them now when I come home for visits.  He calls them "One-Eyed Bandits".  They are delicious.  He buttered the bread.  We are big fans of sweet/salty, so he seasoned the eggs with seasoned salt and put a little shredded cheddar cheese on the plate before serving (the bandit would melt the cheese) and then top it all with some preserves.  Soooo yummy and brings back GREAT memories!

I like to think of myself as a gourmet cook, but I think my husband was happiest when I recreated this simple recipe from his childhood Saturdays with dad...  He has since taught the 'Toad in a Hole' method to my kid sisters.
We started using Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of regular salt and pepper - it really adds a kick!

I have never made this or even had this before. So yummy. Didn't have bacon grease so I just buttered the bread but I am sure the bacon would have made it even better. I added a couple drops of hot sauce because I like my eggs with a little kick. Love it! Can't believe I have waited so long to make these.

Yes,this is an old favorite; almost a military requirement after a Regimental Mess Dinner. I don't think the wives knew just how much we appreciated their love for us in that they would get up from a nice warm bed at 4AM, to make them for us, especially since we always seemed to have a couple of tipsy buddies with us. Thanks for reminding me of good times, long gone.

WOW, I almost forgot about these.  My Mom made these for us back in the 1940's.  It certainly brings back alot of memories.  We didn't use bacon drippings, we butteres both sides of the breack + holes.  Mr grandkids love them now.  YUMM!!

I remember my mom making these when I was a child and now I make them for my grandchildren.   We use a drinking glass to cut out a circle and lightly butter or spray the pan.  We also cook the cut out circles and eat them like toast.  (I did not give five stars, because I have never used bacon grease and never will.)

Hard to believe doing such a simple thing could produce such a great tasting dish. We love these. I use butter instead of the bacon grease. Do toast your buttered "holes" and serve them on top of the egg. Great dish!

I’ve been making these since I was old enough to use the stove by myself......I’m 64 wow. We called them “ POPEYES “. We buttered both sides and browned before adding egg.

We called them Eggs In A Nest.  But as an adult when I flip the egg over I put a little salsa on top of the egg and add a slice of cheese, seal that salsa in.    Also good served on top of a very thin large hand pressed sausage patty or ham steak.   be sure and cook the cut outs,  Yummy dipped in the yoke.

Love these and been making them forever. One trick I found out if you don't want to use the bacon grease is to lightly toast the bread in the toaster. Then they are easier to butter both sides and cut the hole out. Then just coat your pan with a bit of olive oil. Cook over medium about a minute a side and it's done. I'm going to have to try the bacon grease though for something different.

I just made this but instead of bread I used a pancake and omg yummy my dad has made it for me and it's my favorite and I used the shot glass method to make the hole. Make pancake as directed when the bubbles are popped flip over and make your hole and crack egg immediately. :-)

I've been doing this recipe for the last few weeks a couple times a week, and everyone loves it! I add a bit of parmesan cheese on the top side of the egg before flipping it! I suggest you cook it in the highest setting. It will make sure that the bread and egg are cooked from the outside but still soft from the inside.

The instructions said to cook this on low heat. My mistake, I started out on medium heat. So as you can see from my picture my egg in a hole is a little too brown. However, I quickly realized my mistake and turned the heat off, then back on, on low. It was a delicious breakfast/brunch and I got in a protein, a carbohydrate and a fruit . I'm very happy!

These are so fun to make.  I melt the butter in my skillet and dip both sides of bread in it, then add the egg.  Be sure your skillet is hot.  I normally do not like runny eggs but can't get enough of them this way.  It took me a few tries to get it just right.  This is a quick dinner on busy evenings with sausage or bacon.

This is always one of the "ultimate" comfort foods. My mother also cooked this often when I was a kid in the 1960's and she called it "Boy Scout Eggs." After the egg in the middle of the bread cooked a little, she would flip it over and layer 1 to 2 pieces of cheese on top. Once the cheese was melted, it was ready to eat...Yummmmm!

I've done this recipe for years, but I use it when I make French Toast: After toasting slices of bread, I dredge them in beatened eggs with a little cream and a splash of Vanilla added, before frying. When plating, a little powdered sugar, nutmeg and maple syrup to crown, and voila...delicious!

I use French bread sliced diagonally and butter both sides.  I heat on a panini maker and top off with a slice of cheddar.  I always called it "bird in a nest".

Eh, not worth the trouble. Just make an egg over medium and serve toast on the side and you get the same thing.  In my book, the only thing that would have made this worth the trouble was if my kids thought it was a fun way to eat an egg and toast.

I have eaten this regularly ever since I was old enough for solid food! It was called "chicken on the roof" in our house, and still is in mine. I love hearing all the different names and had never heard of scrambling the eggs for it. It's also good with a slice of cheese put on when you flip it, then some ham or bacon & syrup over all (if you're feeling calorically deprived that day!!)

Come home late at night, peckish.......this is a nice, quick and easy snack.  The bacon fat makes it extra delicious.  A bit of pepper and salt.  The deed is done.

I feel a little left out because I never had these growing up and my first experience seeing it was in the movie Moonstruck, but I made them as stated and they were great.  I used a small juice glass and that size seemed to work.  I used bacon grease, though I haven't cooked with that before and I thought they were great.  I'm sure butter would be just fine too.

I grew up in the Pittsburgh area and these were called "dippy eggs".  Still delicious.  When I was young my dad used to make them for me for breakfast before leaving for school on a cold winter's day.

I have made these for years but I do scramble the eggs for the Grandkids. I am surely going to try them using bacon grease, for the added flavor. Bacon grease only has 4.6 more calories then butter, per teaspoon, so not a dramatic difference. Sometimes we put a slice of tomato on top. This is a much heatlhier recipe at 231 calories, then the "Eggy Doodle" 803 calorie recipe, in last weeks Allrecipes "The Daily Dish". Thank you Allrecipes, for showing us all that there is a healthier version.

Butter the toast first and omit bacon grease, cook on medium or med-low and it will brown perfectly. do not try to butter bread with a hole in it... butter it first then cut the hole.  ( :  After flipping, slap a slice of good ol' American (or whatever you like) cheese on top.  Yum!  Grandma made these for us as little kids especially if we were under the weather. Perfect easy breakfast!  Thanks for reminding me of this fantastic classic!

I am not a big fan of fried eggs, but decided to try this!! It was sooooo good. I used bacon grease and butter, and then turned it into a bacon, egg and chesse sandwich. Thanks for a great recipe!

We have made these for years and our kids loved them, but so did we. We called them "One-eyed sandwiches". And the cutouts were always an added bonus.

We call this Bird in the nest ...we also keep the holes we cut out to fry in the pan to dip in the egg yolk. This is a great way to introduce kids to cooking ... they usually get a kick out of it.

Oh my ... what a surprise to see this.  As a child (a few decades ago) this was always one of my favorite breakfast treats and my kids loved it too.  It never had a "name", but I've since heard it called Toad in a Hole.  Not terribly appetizing, but cute.  I still eat it today for a light supper and breakfast.  Butter is a great substitute for bacon grease.  Thank you for sharing .. it made me smile.

My kids love this for breakfast.  We call it Egyptian or Camel Eye Toast.  We make it more fun by using a shaped cookie cutter to cut out the hole.  I fry it hard (by breaking the yolk and moving it about) for one daughter and leave it runny for the other.  Their favorite part is the little piece of leftover bread that is buttered and toasted.

MY DAD MADE THEM OVER 50 YEARS AGO AND CALLED THEM "MAN ON A RAFT" THEY ARE STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITES.MY ADVISE IS TO FRY ONE SIDE OF THE BREAD FIRST, THEN FLIP AND ADD THE EGG, THAT WAY BOTH SIDES ARE CRISPY, DON'T FORGET TO FRY THE WHOLE TOO.

Great recipe - mom made this for us back in the 50's and called it Egg in a Nest- she always used butter since dad's family owned a dairy - and she used a juice glass to cut the hole - thanks for sharing this recipe- it brought back lots of memories - think I'll make them for breakfast in the morning!

Wonderful breakfast, but we always called it Toad in the hole.  I use home made lard in a cast iron skillet and it always turns out perfectly.  I like to use a biscuit cutter to cut the center out, to get a perfectly round hole.

We always called them "Hen in a Pen".  We buttered the bread and same as the rest, and toasted the cut out.  We did, however, cook them in a pan that still had some bacon grease, but not much.  It is a great recipe, and if you're partial to spicy, try spreading it with a little jalepeno or pepper jelly.  The hot and sweet is a wonderful addition.  Enjoy.

My grandmother made this dish - "Toad-In-A-Hole" - for we sibs and our cousins more than 50 yrs ago. A great way to entice fussy children to eat eggs. I still make Toad-In-A-Hole for brunch for my women friends when we are having an "English Fry Up" once a month. It brings back such great memories of my Grandmother, and the lovely, noisy Saturday morning breakfasts my sibs and cousins and I would enjoy with her and my Grandfather when we were very young.

these are wonderful and so easy.  if any of you are old enough to remember biscuit cutters, they are perfect for cutting the hole in the bread.  my grandmother used a biscuit cutter and i was lucky enough to find one a a garage sale!

This has been around for 60+ years,,,,being from the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, our name for it is  "Bird-in-a-Nest"  I make this for my grandkids now and they love it...it's a great after school snack with a cup of hot choc or breakfast.  We eat it with our fingers on the go, too.

Haven't tried this recipe yet, but it brings back memories of childhood when I would stay over at my Grandma's house and she would make me breakfast in the morning. She always used bacon drippings, as they were plentiful in her kitchen. She would always cook up bacon for Grandpa and me to go along with. YUM-O!!!

OMG!  I used to camp and hike as a in my teens and early adulthood and this recipe was my all time favourite, plus it is so convenient to make when you only have one pan to use and it's balancing over the fire on firewood.  Back then, I made it all the time.  It was sooo good!  Thanks for the recipe and bringing up good memories as well.

In my home, we call this "bird in a nest" and we LOVE them.. we use soft french bread - slice a large piec off vertically , and then a horizontal cut all the way down the middle - If we use white bread (or wheat) we cut the crusts bit - need a bit of a border - to hold it all in - I generally brush a bit of melted butter with some garlic, black peppper or dill - pretty much whatever we feel like that day on the bread and we use butter or margarine or bacon grease - adds flavor - plain ol' corn oil just wouldnt do this justice - you can also do these in the oven, spay some foil really well with butter flavor baking spray, place your bread (pre basted slightly with seasoning of choice - can use spray here too) crack the egg into a small bowl and pour carefully into the nest) bake - keep an eye on it so itdoesnt get overdone.  Thanks rosburn! :) a wonderful recipe!

This is such a great recipe.  When my children were little I used to use a chicken cookie cutter to cut out the middle, then toast the cut out.  They loved it.

This has been a favorite of mine since I was a little girl. I've never used the bacon grease, just a little butter and/or Pam spray. To add a little fun to it, I've used different artesian breads (sourdough is a favorite) and sprinkling shredded cheese on it after the last flip adds a nice kick - I just let let it melt into the toast - yummy!

Have been making these for as long as I can remember, this is a favorite of my daughters and my grandchildren..  I think we have the weirdest name of all.  Don't know where the name came from - but we call these "Frog in a hole".    I know - has nothing to do with frogs..    Also - have never used bacon grease, always fried in butter.

My grandpop made these for me when I was just a wee thing. He called them Egg in a Nest.  Great memories.  Like others, I use butter instead of bacon grease.  And my son eats the bread holes.

My mother made this for me as a child and I still make it regularly for myself some 30+ years later!  Since I don't like runny yolks, I use a spatula to spread the yolk and egg white all over the top of the bread and over the edges, then flip when the bottom is cooked.  This way you get egg and bread in every bite!

Oh Gosh.  I havent made these for hmmm over 30 years.  Me and my lil sis use to make them.  We called them Bullseye.  Our mother died when we were 13 and 10, so this was something easy we could do ourselves without Dad (pre-microwave)  I had quit because I remember thinking what a waste of bread (the inside) Being a kid, never even thought to use that to sop up the last bit of goodies.  It all makes perfect sense now, and I will have to start making them again :-)

I made this with butter, as I didn't have any drippings. I've known about this recipe for about 9 years, and I'm just now getting around to eating it. FOR SHAME!!! I could have been enjoying it all along! I always dip my toast into my egg yolks anyway, so this is the perfect treat. I did use too small of a cutter for my hole, and I ended up bleeding whites on top of the slices, but they cooked just fine, and didn't stick. Next time, I'll use my 2 inch.

I made this a few days ago when I was looking for a change for dinner. I used 12 grain bread and used non-fat butter spray on the bread to make it a little healthier for us. We still made the bacon on the side well drained and I sprinkled a little cheddar cheese over it for added flavor. We really enjoyed this and it was a nice change from basic eggs!

My mother used to make these, and I still make them today.  We call them "Birds Nests", but as said here before there are many names.   The only thing I do different is use butter.

I change things a bit.  First I spread mayonnaise onto my piece of bread, both sides.  I use a cookie cutter in shapes of a heart, star, or a plain circle(boring).  All 4 people In my house like their eggs cooked differently.  So I prepare scrambled, runny yolk and fried hard.  The runny yolk person doesn't like whites, so use a smaller cookie cutter and just place in the yolk.  Fry on a griddle.  Even put the cut out on the griddle for a mini piece of toast, why waste.  the mayo browns up really nice and gives it a bit of a zip.  You can use mayo also for Grilled cheese

Add This Step  (Cheryl) 

I enjoyed reading all the reviews with all the different names for the dish and the different ways of fixing the eggs.  May I add one more?  I didn't read this step among any of the reviews.  I have been married for more than 47 years.  Like others, we always call them "Eggs in a Nest."  They are best with homemade bread.   The homemade bread is, also, a little sturdier besides tasting best.  Use a cookie cutter to make the round in the center of the bread.   If you are, also, fixing bacon, pour a little bacon grease into the skillet. Otherwise, use butter.   DIP THE SLICE AND ROUND INTO A DISH OF MILK. Immediately as you put the slice and round into the skillet, pour one egg into the center.  Cook until the bread is browned on the bottom the way you want.  Use two spatulas to turn the slice with egg and the round over in the pan and brown the other side.  Salt and pepper.  That's it.    So good.  It reminds me of my Dad's Depression Era dish of Fried Bread.  Oh my gosh.  It makes me want to make some right now.

I was looking for a new breakfast item and came across this recipe. It was easy to make. I did adjust it a bit. I fried bacon and used the grease but also a little bit of butter. I used a lid from the seasoning mix to cut the circle. As recommended I cooked one side and then flipped the bread and then added the egg. I used a season from Washington that I love called Johnny's. I also cut the strip of bacon into 3 and served it on top of the toast and sprinkled with cheddar cheese. It was very good.

I’ve never made Egg in a Hole with bacon grease. This was fantastic! I cooked mine in the cast iron skillet. I toasted the bread on one side and flipped the bread to toast it on the other side then broke the egg in the hole. The bacon grease absorbed into the first side so when I flipped the egg it was starting to burn. I learned I needed to add more grease when I flipped it...yummmmm

This is one of those weekend breakfasts that remind me of my childhood. Simple to make and yummy! It's unique plate presentation will have new guests at your table asking for the recipe. I add fresh fruit and cheesy grits with breakfast meats to complete the meal.

To me this is SO much better using butter instead of bacon grease. Bacon grease just doesn't give this simple breakfast the lovely taste butter will give.

I love this recipe. I live in the south so I make this with grits and sausage links. And I put the toast on the plate then grits on top then sausage links on top of that.

This recipe is quick and easy. I sometimes sprinkle cheese and let it melt to get the omelet effect.

This was so yummy!!! I loved it. But you definitely have to like over easy or over medium eggs.  I love sourdough bread so going to try it with sourdough next time. I love the pics using the heart shape cookie cutter!

Love this recipe. I didn't use the bacon, but did butter the toast prior as per Charlotte's recommendation. Also used a cup to make the circles- worked perfectly.

Excelente! I tried cookinh the toast with butter and with bacon oil.  Bacon seems to brown the bread and butter Goldens it. I cut a half a slice of bacon and add it to the egg side.  It made it eve more delicious...yum

I am in my 60's, I have made this for the past 45-50 years. I butter both sides of bread, cut out my hole with a glass. Heat my pan, drop in bread then egg. Salt and pepper to taste when bread nicely browned flip and cook other side. I always call them "Bulls Eyes". These and Poached Eggs on Toast run neck and neck on my breakfast choices. I am a from scratch cook and started cooking before I started kindergarten! I made soup, I couldn't wait for the necessary time, but I ate it. My soups today are savory and requested from family often.

Made it this morning for my grand-daughter.  We've been making "Egg in the Hole" for years.   We like to call the circle we cut out  (butter, grill and eat), the "Gold Medallion" :)  Didn't use to use bacon grease tho (can't believe I didn't think about it all these years!) but I did today before getting the recipe in my inbox this morning.  Serve with an ice cold glass of OJ :)

I have had this type of egg since I was a little girl over 50 years ago.  I like my egg cooked through so I cut a 3.5-4"  hole in the bread.  Adding the egg right away allows my egg to cook well on both sides; I can even break the yolk if I want to.   The big piece of bread taken out of the center fries along side the egg for a tasty piece of toast.  You can also substitute butter for the bacon fat if you prefer.  Still tastes great!

I have made these for years don't know why but our family always called them "Silver Dollar Eggs", but Toad in a Hole makes much more sense.  I just recently started taking a large slice of sourdough bread and cooking with Two Toads in a Hole side by side. Flipping this in the pan is a bit awkward but it  can be done. Anyway a great breakfast recipe :-)

My mom called them one eyed sandwiches and we always buttered the bread and browned the cut out hole along with the sandwich and used it to dip in the yolk.  I've continued the tradition and made them for my kids and grandchildren.

I love this simple breakfast. I use to make it when i was young. Havent made this in 30yrs!  I also put butter on both sides of the bread, cook one side & when i flipped it over to cook the other side you crack the egg on that side. Yummy! Gotta make this again.

As countless others, we call this "egg in a basket." My dad taught us kids how to make it, I taught my kids, and now at 60, I taught my grandson  (now 6.5) who has been making these since he was 4! (With supervision of course). Only my husband likes his egg runny, so we pick the yolk after breaking egg into basket. I use my grandma's biscuit cutter. We add a little real butter to a little bacon grease, cut the bread, coat both sides, add an extra tiny pat of butter in the circle before adding egg. If you are using a stainless steel skillet, heat pan first before adding grease, heat grease before cooking egg. Voila! Non stick! Also, using high quality bread takes it over the edge! I recommend a good quality stone ground wheat such as Brownberry (in the red label) or Trader Joe's wheat or 7 grain bread. Our favorite breakfast and sometimes dinner.  I never even knew this recipe was in print before I read it on Allrecipes! I thought it was something my dad created! How much fun to share this memory!

I had this all the time when I was a kid and now I make it for my kids all the time! I butter the bread on both sides and do not use bacon grease at all. I toast the bread in the toaster then butter the bread on both sides. Then I  take a small juice cup (or sometimes a cookie cutter) to make the hole. I then crack the egg and scramble it once they start to get a bit fluffy that's when I flip it. My kiddos LOVE IT this way! For my hubby I crack the egg and flip it gently once the egg becomes all white but I still have a   yolk. Once it's flipped I make sure all the white part of the egg is cooked while leaving him the yellow yolk to mix on his toast I also salt & pepper to taste both egg toasts. They make a simple before school breakfast!

Better yet, french toast. Cut a hole, make your french toast as usual. ( circle as a  side) one side of your french toast cook as usual. Other side leave underdone. When ready for eggs, put the raw side down, crack you egg ( butter of bacon fat) and cover until egg is cooked to your liking. ( FYI- stab the yolk for hard fried and flip it go a minute at the end)
My french toast dip is eggs, milk, vanilla and brown sugar. Nothing else needed but feel free to use syrup.

We have made these for years, calling them "Spy Eyes".   A new twist--here in Uruguay--we assemble a ham and cheese sandwich ready for grilling, cut the hole in the middle, and proceed as directed....this one is called a "007 Spy Eye".  A hit with my older kids!

Mom made this when I was young. I'm now 62. She called it "Egg on a Raft". She let us help make them by using a small glass to make the hole in the bread. The variations are probably enough to never get tired of it.  A great teaching tool for young children learning skills in the kitchen.

When my son was a Boy Scout he came home and told me about these. He called them "Toad In the Hole." We just buttered both sides of the slice of bread, used a small jar to cut out the center and followed the recipe from there. Everybody's favorite part was the "hole."

My husband has been making them since he was a youngster.  He called them "Toad in a Hole".  We've never tried them with bacon grease but will the next time we make them!

In this day and age, I wouldn't use bacon drippings--I do use butter, much the same way one reader said--butter one side of the bread with a hole already cut in (use muffin tool) and place it in buttered frypan.
I learned about these in college--we call them 'eggs in the basket'!

I learned how to make these when I was about 9 or 10 years old. We called them,  A One-Eyed Egyptian and if you really want to get your kids into making these,  butter the bread and then have them bite out the middle of it and that's where you put the egg at.

I had never heard of, or seen or tasted this one, until I was well into my 50's, and visiting a friend, who made them for breakfast.  I was amazed that I had never heard of them, or even thought of making something so easy.  They are delicious, and if you have a large grill, you can make quite a few of them at one time.  Bacon grease does make them very flavorful, and there isn't enough calories to worry about, unless you are obsessive about it.

We have been making these for 30+ years. We call them "toad in the holes". You can flip as many times as you like to cook the egg to your preference. Don't forget to put a slice of your favorite cheese on at the last flip. The kids thought that this was gourmet eating.

I don't use bacon fat (Kosher thingy) I use like a 1/2 tsp of butter and a 1/2 tsp of coconut  oil in the hole in the bread. I just butter both sides like I was making a grilled cheese and brown it on one side then flip it and crack an egg  in a small dish  then gently  schlep it into the hole in the bread and cook until the white starts to set and then hurry up the process  with a butane torch to finish the egg white, this way the yolk is still ooey gooey to dip a bagel n' cream cheese in. I bought the torch at Harbor Freight for around 8 bucks, handy for other things too like soldering. If you make a larger hole in the bread the white will cook faster too.

I grew up with this yummy way of cooking egg and toast. I always buttered both sides of bread first and made a hole in the center with a small cup, put it into the pan and cracked the egg right away, fry then flip. I like to add just a little syrup on top . Yummy!

We called this eggs in a nest when my kids were young. I always toasted the "holes" on the side. I covered the egg with the hole so they ate it along with the egg for dipping. They liked their eggs "drippy." My youngest is 40, so I can't even remember what I used for frying back then. I would use butter now.

This has been one of our favorites for years.  We use butter in place of the bacon grease.   If you like a runny egg to dip the toast in, watch how long you cook it carefully.

Excellent way to get kids to transfer from eating scrambled to fried eggs. My mom made this for me 60 years ago and we always knew it as a 'Popeye'. Margarine or butter was always used on both sides of the bread, the hole was always cut with either a drinking glass or a biscuit cutter. I would estimate that this recipe, by any name, dates back to the WWII era.

I've been making these for years, 50+ actually. We called them "One Eyed Sandwiches". I got the idea from an old Monty Woolley film. 
They are fun for kids to make and delicious to eat. I fry them in butter. I butter the bread on both sides before I drop it in the pan fry on both sides till golden brown.
I put a slice of ham at the bottom of the hole, drop in the egg and cook for a few minutes . Then I cover the pan and turn the flame off and let sit till the egg is "Steam" cooked. Yummy!

We call this egg in the nest.  Lightly butt er the bread on both side and put a dot of butter in the pan before breaking the egg into the hole.   Use a juice glass to cut the hole in the middle.

As most "family" recipes go, we have a different name "Egg in a basket".  But the basics are still the same.  Vegetable Oil or bacon grease in pan 'till hot, brown one side, flip, add a drop of oil to hole directly in center, then add the egg.  That extra drop of oil is not absolutely necessary, but for me, it helps prevent sticking of the egg.  I also add a slice of American or mild-cheddar cheese to top it off just before the egg is finished cooking.  That cheese adds that extra touch!

My grandma always called this "toad in the hole." She used cookie cutters to make the hole- mine was always the star- and served it with her homemade sausage. Still a favorite! But now I make a spicy aioli to go with it.

I made with 1 Tbsp bacon fat in skillet and bread buttered on borh sides. Per another suggestion  used a glass to "punch" out holes in bread for eggs. It was sooo good. Loved these "Eggs in a Nest" as we called them when I was small.

Simple and delicious. The bacon grease (which I keep on hand as a staple) just elevated this even further and made me feel like I was eating just plain ol' bacon & eggs.

This has been around a long time and known in my family as a egg in a nest when you turn it over. Simple and wonderful! Brings back memories of my Grandma!

My kids loved this as much as teddy bear pancakes.   For theirs rather than circle I used a heart shaped cookie cutter with small eggs.  Once cooked on one side I used spatula to corral too much egg over the heart.  With a slice of breakfast ham or bacon serving size portioned to theirs of course with OJ was their favorite starter for the day.

I have always loved this recipe since my Grandma taught me how to make it when I was 6 years old.  She called it eggs in a frame and so do I.  We use margarine or butter on the bread and do not cook in bacon grease.  (might be tasty, but why make a cholesterol bomb a nuclear cholesterol bomb?)If you don't like over easy eggs, then just beat the egg with a fork before putting it in the frame.  That's how my Grandma made it for me when I was a kid before I liked over easy eggs.  I find using large eggs and making them runny results in too little bread to egg ratio, even with the holes toasted so I use medium eggs for this, or toast another slice per two frames.

One of my favorite breakfast recipes. To save time some mornings, I toast the bread, butter it, fry up the egg and toss it on top. But for the days I want it to be cute and have the time, I go this route.

Substituted margarine for bacon grease and it turned out very well. Being pregnant, I can't eat under-cooked food so I scrambled the eggs and poured that in the hole. My boyfriend loved it!

To us these are a "Hole in One" and we butter the bread on both sides before cutting the hole and adding the egg as soon as we put them in the skillet.  I have loved them for 50 years.  shellyleck

Darn good...I really do wonder who was the first person to actually carve a hole in a slice of bread and pour an egg in?! So many wonderful names for the dish too...I like "Cyclops"!
Also thanks everyone for your great suggestions for different breads (even waffles), additions of shredded cheeses, spices and lots of different frying fats.

When I was growing up, Mom would make these for my brother and me for breakfast. She called it "an egg in the nest". She would cut out a hole in the center by placing a small juice glass upside down on the bread and press down. Then she would butter each side of the bread, place it in the skillet (a cast iron skillet seem to work the best), put a dab of butter in the hole, crack an egg into the hole after the butter had melted and fry it until the bread was brown. Then she would flip it over and brown the other side. She would also butter the remaining pieces of bread cut from the middle and fry both sides. I still like 'em 50 years later.

Been making this since I was in high school.  Learned it in a cooking class when they still taught that.  We used butter but now I use butter flavored Pam and also cut a hole in center, fry the center piece too.  Those of us that can have all that grease.  I salt and pepper it too.

Just ran across this recipe while looking for something to do with eggs (since I really need to get to the grocery store). My mom used to make this for my brother and I, probably hadn't had it since I was 12 or so. Brings back the memories.

This was called Eggs in the Basket for me when I was growing up.  I am 70 years young and it is still a great easy breakfast/brunch type of meal. I generally use butter on both sides and toast the one before putting in the egg as this helps so the white doesn't make it too soggy. It isn't toasted all the way just enough to put a light crust on it do the other side the same then add the egg it seems to help.  In serving it I put the lid (already toasted also) back on the egg and serve it with bananas in orange juice.  My kids loved this for a special meal.

Egg in a nest is what my Dad called it when I started to eat it in the 70s. A classic, simple, and fun dish. My son loves it like I did as a kid.

My variation is a tad different. I don't use bacon grease, instead I butter a warm pan so there isn't a ton of butter used compared to buttering each individual side.

My husband introduced me to this very easy yet delish recipe 20+ yrs ago (we call them Sunshine Eggs) and it has been a favorite in our family ever since. He taught me to first lightly toast the bread in the toaster, butter 1 side then cut the hole with a small cup. We also just use light cooking spray in the pan and save on the calories. So simple yet filling!

Been making Egg in a Hole for more than thirty years.  Fry the cutout, too.  Used to make them on campouts with our kids.  Cheese is good.  So is a little peanut butter.  Add a thin layer while the egg and bread are still hot and it'll melt to perfection.  Still making them today for our grandchildren.  Neil

I'm 57 and was raised on nest eggs. My kids and now my grands also love them. An empty tomato sauce can works great as a hole cutter. Just be sure to punch a hole in the opposite end to allow air to escape.

This is an old family fav from the 60s, we kids would make it. First, we butter both sides of the bread, place it on the griddle and then punch out the middle with the inside of Mother's doughnut cutter, (the doughnut hole), or a small juice glass. Add the egg, season it, cook both sides. We called it "One-eyed Egyptian sandwich"  I made it for my kids and they are still making it also...fun and delicious.

This was a great recipe! Ever since watching V for Vendetta, I have been wanting to try this. After reading a couple of reviews, I decided to top the pan so I wouldn't have to flip the bread slice and possibly break the yolk. I did figure out that it is best to add the egg right after flipping the slice of bread. Really good recipe, cannot wait to make thins for my boyfriend! :D

I love making this at home. The first time I had them, I was at the Cracker Barrel in Londonderry, NH. You can order them at any Cracker Barrel, even if it isn't on the menu. But it is very nice to be able to have them at home.

Delicious recipe I have used for more years than I care to remember.  Good as is but I add a dash of worcestershire sauce to the egg.  Now, to all you negative people...don't knock it until you try it.  Adds a bit of zip, especially for a late evening snack.

I have made this a few times and love it. Instead of using grease, butter or margarine, I lightly spray both sides of the bread with butter flavored cooking spray. There is no chance of it being oily and still has that butter taste to it. May have to try the olive oil cooking spray next time.

I was leery about using bacon grease, but it turned out to be very tasty.  My husband raved and asked for it again.  I served it to a older lady from El Salvador who thought it was standard American breakfast and pronounced it "bueno."  She's going to try to make it at her house.  I used a shot glass to cut the circle and it was just right.  Also, it's a great way to use bread that isn't good enough for sandwiches because it has become old and crumbly as happens here quickly in Florida.

Been making this with homemade cheese bread for years. Always a hit with family & friends.  Have to say the featured photo with raw eggs & untoasted bread, is a bit offputting. A photo of the finished dish would be more appropriate.

As so many have wrote, it's an old favorite.  I was taught by an Italian woman and it was called egg in hat.  Melt a slice of your favorite cheese on top, any pain you have will vanish.  Delicious!

The only comment I have is a little PR, instead of calling it "bacon grease" it sounds better if you say "bacon drippings". It's the same thing, just sounds better!

Interesting how we all seem to have different names for this, we called it a hole in one and did it a little differently, cut out the hole(sometimes using cookie cutters for different shapes) buttered both sides and the circle or shape, placed in frying pan, added egg, s&p, fried, flipped, enjoyed! dont forget to fry the bread removed from the centre, yum!

There has been many names for this recipe in the years. Back when I was young when we had hardly anything to eat we would make this dish, but we called it a toa in a hole.

I have been eating "Egg in a Bread" since I was old enough to eat table food and love it. I melt margine in a frying pan, ripe a piece of bread from the center of a piece of white bread, place the bread in the frying pan, crack the egg & drop it in the whole, cook for about 5 min then flip the bread and cook the other side just enough til the white is cooked

I'm 58 yrs. old & my Daddy use to make these for us, using leftover hamburger buns. He would use a jigger for the hole & some of the egg would be on top of the bun. My twin sis, Mom & I loved them! I now make them w/bakery Jalepeno/Cheese bread & they are delicious! Thanks for the memories!! :)

We called these "bird's nests"  Whenever my kids had sleepovers, they told their friends that Mom cooks bird's nests for breakfast....the look on their faces was priceless every time.

I have been making these for my children since they were little, using butter instead of bacon grease. For some reason my son called them Peter Rabbits and the name stuck.

Ahh a classic, who doesn't love it?  I usually use butter or margarine instead of bacon grease.  When I make this for my boyfriend I carefully cut out the hole in the bread into the shape of a heart :)

This is great. I have been making this for 50 years. My father showed me how. We put Ketchup on it and call it a "Bloody man on a raft". He said in came from the Navy in WW2. Sometines I add a dash of Franks Hot sauce. Yum!

I used to make these 30 some years ago for my sons.  We called them picture framed eggs and would toast the rounds for dipping.

Very yummy. Just finished it up. I did use Parkay spray butter (0 calories, fat...) One piece of bunny bread and one large egg, only 130 calories!! I am not a breakfast eater so this was just perfect. For that little of calories I could easily have two if I wanted. Thanks so much!!

I can't believe there's actually a recipe out there for this! My dad used to make this for me as a kid (except the bacon grease part... we just used margarine)- all my friends think I'm crazy when I talk about it.  Well, they don't know what they're missing!  Great breakfast food- sometimes I even have it for dinner :)

I love this recipie!  Being pregnant leaves me with not a lot of choices at this time of what I can eat (nausea).  Eggs have been an easy dish my stomach can handle.  I've been eating scrambled egges until I found this recipie and it I love it!  I fix them all the time and now my 14 year old enjoys them every morning before headed off to football practice.  Wonderful.  May try using butter later, but for now I'll keep it just the way it is!

These are very cute, I made them for my hubby and I this morning.  The only issue I see is that by the egg is cooked the toast is starting to burn.  I ended up having to flip the toast with the egg to finish it off.
