This dish was AMAZING (and husband approved - which is a WIN in my house!)! Very simple and quick, but also very tasty! I think next time I'm going to spice up my breading a little bit more, and possibly add a little more mustard, but overall, great recipe!

Yum!  This was so easy and so so good. I used olive oil rather than buy avocado oil and sliced Swiss since that was what I had already.  This one will be a staple in my low carb rotation!

Great recipe! I did not season the chicken, but added 1/2 tsp of kosher salt and 1/4 tsp ground pepper to the dry mix. I also used grated Parmesan from a can, and it turned out really well. I will definitely make this again, and may add some crushed rosemary next time.
