I’ve made these cauliflower mashed potato dishes many times but always have to be very careful when I make them so they don’t turn out too goopy.  For great success the cauliflower must be cooked until very tender, must be dried out as much as possible, and a very limited amount of milk added, if any.  What I immediately noticed in this recipe was the addition of the potato flakes, and I thought that was ingenious!  The submitter adds just enough to ensure that the cauliflower is a mashed potato consistency and it was a very easy and effective solution!  You know, one of those, “Why didn’t I think of that?” kind of things.  I made it easy on myself and just microwaved the cauliflower and dried it very thoroughly before I continued with the rest of its preparation.  Since I was serving this with gravy I didn’t use the Cheddar cheese.   Obviously this only pretends to be mashed potatoes, but it does a fine job, particularly with the “secret ingredient” of potato flakes.   Suggestion:  For best flavor use butter, not margarine.

This recipe turned my hubby from a cauliflower hater to a lover.  He even said he wouldn't mind having these instead of mashed potatoes!!  I skipped the cheese, and used a light whipped butter for a less calorie version.

I have a similar recipe which I never thought of as a substitute for potatoes! but is a good side dish? I mash cooked cauliflower with low fat mayo, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder and black pepper. can be served right away or reheats well,too. I sometimes top with melted cheese, whatever I have on hand.

Texture and mouth feel is a huge part of the illusion.  If you simply mash the cauliflower, it doesn't quite pull it off.   But if you puree it in a blender or food processor, it comes very close.

Just made this for dinner and yumm.  I did find the texture when mashed to still be like cauliflower and not like potato so I added some freshley minced garlic and then whipped it in the food processor, adding more milk as needed.  I then baked it with some grated cheddar and paprika on top for about 15 minutes.  Came out awesome! Will definalty make again!!!

I made them and thought they were good.  I didn't care for the cheese on top so replaced with some gravy.  Kind of defeated the healthy aspect I suppose, but it made them so much better!

Very good and easy, added a little garlic powder, I will probably just cook the cauliflower in the microwave to save some time. Husband who's diabetic ate all of his, and didn't complain about no mashed potatoes! ( = a 4 star review for him)  The rest of us loved itl

I modified the recipe to use 4 cups cooked cauliflower, 1/2 c. Betty Crocker Butter and Herb mashed potato flakes, 1/2 c. milk, 4 tsp. margarine, 1/2 c. cheese. After boiling the cauliflower for approximately 8 minutes, I pureed it in my food processor then added the flakes, milk, and margarine; processed again then added the cheese. I did not take the extra time to bake the potatoes because my 2 year old niece wanted a taste and ended up eating two bowls. Four cups of cauliflower only made approximately three servings so I had to make a second batch immediately. Delicious! I didn't add salt or pepper due to the extra flavoring in the mashed potatoes. I will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe! A great way to make mashed cauliflower. We like lots of flavor, but few calories as possible. I added a tablespoon of light sour cream, 1 chicken cube powder (no water-just the crushed cube and 1 clove finely chopped garlic and some chopped parsely to the original already fantastic recipe before baking! Thank you for sharing it with the cooking community!

In trying to eat healthy, I tried this for my husband and I. We love cauliflower, and this is fantastic!! I cut up a whole cauliflower, steamed it in the microwave, and followed the rest of the directions. Did not feel the need to use anything on them, other than a spritz of butter spray. The taste is exceptional, and will be making this again and again!! OOPS, forgot to say I didn't use the cheese at the end. Again, didn't need it!!

Totally different taste than mashed potatoes (which is what you think of when you're eating it), but VERY good.

This recipe was very easy to prepare, put together and bake.  I opted to use almond milk in place of the low fat milk.  I added fresh parsley and onion flake for added flavor.

I made these cauliflower mashed for the first time this evening, and I'll probably never make mashed potatoes again.   I made it with the ingredients in my mashed potatoes: 1.5 lb head of cauliflower steamed with 2 cloves of garlic.  I did puree my steamed cauliflower in a ninja to smooth it out.  I mixed in about 1/4 c milk, 1/2 c sour cream, 1/4 c cream cheese, a bit of onion powder along with the potato flakes, salt and pepper. I did skip the cheese on top. No one in my family knew the difference between these and mashed potatoes which prompted a confession at the end of the meal.  They loved them and suggested I make these instead of potatoes in the future.  I served with Lightning Gravy (also LOW carb) and am very pleased with the results.

the only reason you need the flakes is for the starch to get it to stick together. I substituted with one large russet potato. kids didn't even know the difference!!

Excellent and nutritious veggie dish. Can really pass for mashed potatoes. Easy to prepare. I used a blender to purée and added white cheddar cheese and sprinkled that on top before putting in oven. My husband loved it!

Awesome recipe! Everyone loves cauliflower anyway so trying a new dish with it was great! Can't say we would like it with gravy,that would defeat the flavor!And they don't need alot of cheese either! Why even eat it if you would cover up the taste? 5 stars here!

I omitted the milk and potato flakes.   The only reason I make this is because I need a low carb alternative, and the milk and potato flakes just add the carbs I try to avoid. If I was to add potato flakes I would just make instant mashed potatoes and save myself the work of making this.

I didn’t use the potato flakes bc I didn’t have them.  Although, I’m curious about the combo.  ??I tweaked the recipe a little.  Steamed the cauliflower in the microwave for 10 minutes.    I used same amt of milk, but used unsweetened almond milk.  Added 1 tsp Better Than Bullion chicken flavor, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp celery seeds, salt, pepper, and butter.  It doesn’t necessarily need cheese.  Next time, I think I will try some Ranch dressing mix or dill.   My hubs can’t stand cauliflower, but I told him it was mashed potatoes. ??????. He loved it.  He now knows n can’t believe it.

This is so good.  I added garlic salt rather than regular salt and it was very good.  I didn't use a pound of cauliflower but probably a little over a half pound.  I steamed it in the microwave.  Try it out!

It was fine on the day I made it but was hoping for a more potato tasting mash due to the added potato flakes. Next time I’d leave them out and reduce the carb amount.  On the second day the leftovers definitely had a cauliflower flavor. Maybe the recipe  needs more cheese, garlic or onion.

I enjoyed this dish a lot.  I did make a few changes.  I used a full bag of sour cream instant potatoes (1 cup).  I used light cream instead of the skim milk and kept pouring in water as needed to blend the potato flakes into the cauliflower.   My whole family enjoyed them!

I made these “substitute potatoes” for Easter dinner and it was delicious! I used 4 heads of cauliflower and doubled all the other ingredients. I used roasted garlic and parsley Idaho potato flakes. It was a nice addition. I did use the cheese and they were great. I didn’t make gravy because I did not know if it would be good on them, but it would have. I will make this recipe again.

This was so easy & so good! My husband loved it and my daughter asked me to make this recipe instead of mashed potatoes from now on.

This is a great way to skinny up mashed potatoes i will be making this again. Only suggestion is to make sure that the cauliflower is really done done I used an electric mixer to whip them up nicely

It has very good flavor.  I made it without the potato flakes, I didn't have any on hand.  My sister loved them.  I used a handmixer, not a food processor.  They weren't completely creamy, but it didn't seem to matter.  Next time I'll try it with the cheddar on top and baking it thru.

Next time, instead of hand mashing, I will put the cauliflower in my Vitamix to blend it better.  Other than that, it was absolutely delicious!  I also substituted a different type of cheese when I didn't have cheddar on hand and that worked out fine.

It was my first attempt faking mashed potatoes- it tasted ok but  I learned a few things. Maybe just microwave cauliflower -steaming it made it soggy with water. Use a food processor- my masher/whip combo left the mixture 'flat' not fluffy. And really, all I wanted to eat was the cheese... by the handful.

This was the first time I made mashed cauliflower and my husband and I loved it!  It was so easy .  I used the food processor to get a smooth consistency and honestly, I almost felt like I was eating mashed potatoes.   A winner!

I used twice as much cheese. In addition, trying to mash with a fork did not do a good job. Dish was very tasty but mealy. Next time I will use the electric hand mixer.  Otherwise good alternative for mashed potatoes.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I boiled the cauliflower instead of steaming it (as I was strapped for time) and added a bit of extra cheese. I also used a Roasted Garlic mashed potato powder for a little bit of extra flavor. This recipe was tasty, but I may add a little bit of extra spices next time just for a little more flavor. Will definitely make again!

Anytime my husband will eat a vegetable side and "like" it becomes a winner!  I added just a pinch of French herb blend, a pinch of granulated garlic. I omitted the cheese. just because I wasn't in the mood for it.  Excellent side.

I didn't exactly follow the recipe but I'd definitely would make this dish again! Instead of milk I used 2 tablespoons of light sour cream, minced garlic, onion powder, parmasaen and parsley. I recommend boiling the cauliflower with a little salt until just about all the water cooks down (made it super easy to mash with a fork) Delicious!

I started the Wheat Belly Total Health way of eating about a month ago, so was looking for all kinds of alternatives for potato dishes. This fits the bill! I didnt mash them all the way today, left out the potato flakes and added a dollop of sour cream. Will mash another day! Tastes great!

I love cauliflower so it was great for me. Didn't make any changes. Next time will try some garlic. Great substitute for mashed potatoes since hubby is diabetic.  Now I can have "mashed potatoes " again and he really liked them!

this worked out great and I think it is the addition of that quarter cup of instant potatoes that makes it, cause I didn't use butter and only used a splash of evaporated milk.  Steamed the cauliflower till very tender and then put in food processor with the instant potatoes and milk until creamy.  No cheese either, as we don't usually have that on our mashed potatoes either.  thanks for sharing!

This was very good, but I skipped on the cheese, and used my Food Processor (Ninja) to make the cauliflower smooth and creamy.  I like the idea of adding some potato flakes because of a really picky boyfriend who is afraid of eating anything "different."  Also I added a little garlic powder.

There was a distinct unpleasant taste to the cauliflower.

These were awesome! Put a little white pepper in and added a little Parmesan and they were totally a hit.
