We all loved this, and especially my husband!  I cut the cayenne in half for me, and it was at the delicious edge of too hot for me while he raved about it.   Be careful about the cooking time;  it can look done but I had to cut the meat before I realized some of it wasn't done yet.  I had to return it all to the oven for a few more minutes.  Will definitely make it again!

I'll be honest---I approached making this thinking it would be interesting, and maybe a bit special for Valentine's dinner with my husband. I'm not a fan of Sriracha, and Tarragon is sort of ok with my palate.  
Well---this sauce was deLICIOUS, and perfect with the lobster!  We both really loved it, and thought the sauce would be great with crab, scallops, halibut, cod, probably chicken , and maybe pork also. And so easy!!  

THIS IS A KEEPER!!

We wouldn't make it again. It was spicy, but didn't really add anything to the taste of the lobster. Too much lemon for our preference. It may have made it a bit juicier, but we really prefer just basting with butter when broiling.

The sauce was excellent but on Lobster?  I don't think lobster needs anything but little paprika and butter but gave this a try. What I did not like was that you lost the taste of the lobster. Think this sauce mix would be great with deviled eggs and will give that a try as the taste was great and liked the hint of  heat.

Other than struggling with splitting the lobster tails, this recipe was incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious!  The hubby said it was a little too spicy for him, so I may cut down the cayenne a little next time.

I used frozen lobster tails and they were fast and easy to prepare. The only substitution was that I used dried tarragon instead of fresh because I didn’t have it and so I used a little less. As far as the sauce goes it was delicious, fast and easy. It would be good on other things as well. I thought it was a little bit strong and over powered the lobster taste. I probably wouldn’t use this sauce on lobster tails again but I definitely will use this sauce on something else and maybe I’ll use butter with a little tarragon on the lobster tails.  Like Chef John said though you could change this method of cooking really easily and it works out fast and well. It looks nice when it comes out of the oven so it’s an impressive meal too.

I couldn't find tarragon at the store. I used thyme, parsley, chives combo. Good recipe! I had to make extra sauce and used lime for the citrus. Got me thinking of a Latin version on the future.
