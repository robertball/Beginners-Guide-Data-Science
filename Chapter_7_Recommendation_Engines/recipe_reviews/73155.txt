I tried this recipe for myself and I really enjoyed it. The only change I made was that I used honey instead of sugar and was a little more liberal with the cinnamon. I love this recipe and will definitely make it again . Thanks!

I am a porridge eater normally but was looking for a recipe similar to what the Hari Krishna tent serves up at the Glastonbury festival in the UK, which is spicy, sweet and breakfasty too. I found I needed to add more cinnamon to this and poured honey over it too or it would have been bland. I also used sultanas instead of bananas as the one I had previously had sultanas. Not a very exciting recipe but not bad either

I didn't try it with bananas, as I find cooked bananas too mushy.  Instead, I added dried raisins, dried and chopped appricots, and chopped almonds.  I upped the cinnamon, added cloves, nutmeg, and allspice, and Voila!  Christmas cookies for breakfast.

This was really weird. I cut the amount of salt in half and it was still way too salty. The whole thing tasted like salty bananas, very strange. Next time I will leave the salt out all together.

Oops, I must have forgotten to include 1/2 cup saltanas in the ingredients when I submitted the recipe.  You simply add the saltanas with the other ingredients.

I thought this was pretty bland until I added a ton of brown sugar. Maybe next time I'll add some more spices to it. My toddler ate a whole bowl of it though!

Great recipe -- easy, quick, delicious and versatile. It's great as is, but sometimes I leave out the bananas and add apples, dates, peaches, apricots, walnuts and/or berries --whatever I have on hand.

I didn't like this recipe much. But I didn't make it for nothing because my mum ate it. I think I didn't enjoy it much because I dont like the hot banana taste. I added some brown sugar and that made a bit of difference but it still needed something. I dont think it tasted like porridge just bananas. Over all this recipe would be good for people that like the hot banana taste.

Simple, fast and delicious recipe! Instead of sugar, I used honey. The taste of cooked banana combined with cinnamon makes the trick of this recipe. I really enjoyed this porridge and will make it again as long as I have bananas in my fruit basket!

This porridge is great, I love the Cinnomon in it, I did add about 2 tabs. Heavy whipping cream per serving to it to add extra flavor to it, and then it was great.  My kids also liked it with a little more Cinnomon and some rasins in it, but the recipe was easy and quick to make, a must in my house!

I loved the smell but it tasted awful! To much banana flavor even after reducing the amount of bananas to 1 banana.

This is a great starting point recipe.  I modified it quite a bit (no bananas, brown sugar instead of white, pinch of salt instead of full amount) and it turned out great.  It was my first time making porridge, and it was a huge success.  Thank you!

I made it and it was sooooo good! Instead of white sugar, however, I used stevia. Stevia is not only healthier, but more powerful, so it really gave it the bang it was missing. I'll def make this dish again.

I enjoy this recipe but I leave off the sugar and salt and let the banana reduce completely and then add a handful of blueberries and a sliced strawberry (single serving) to top it off once I put in a bowl - excellent!

Very easy to put together and a nice hearty breakfast on a cold day.  I added a little brown sugar to the top because I thought it needed to be slightly sweeter.   I did not care for the texture of the bananas cooked into the porridge.  They were a little too mushy for my personal preference.  I would make this again, but, add some dried fruit and nuts instead next time.
