I didn't like this as much as I thought I would, but it was refreshing. I don't like overly sweet drinks, so the sweetness level was fine for me, however I think most would prefer it a bit sweeter. I like that it's low cal too. You don't really taste any coconut, so if I make this again I'll use coconut milk instead. I wouldn't call this a smoothie, really. It's more slushy and icy.
