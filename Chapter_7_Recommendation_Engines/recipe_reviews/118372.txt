The only thing I would change next time would be to double the gelatin and water because it seems just enough to cover the filling but it would have been awesome with more gelatin.

I did not have frozen whipped topping, but did have whipping cream, so I used that. I also put the whole recipe in a 8x8 pan, so it was thicker. Used sugar free gelatin. Very good! Taste like summer!

FYI: Don't rush the jello mixture in the freezer and expect it to be ready when picking up the bowl too quickly and spilling it EVERYWHERE, oh my! lol

This was delicious. Make sure to double the crust and filling or it will be very thin.

This is a very light and refreshing dessert.  I used fresh peaches and made a slightly different crust.  I doubled the gelantin mixture on top as well.  Very good.

I liked this, but it was a little too much cream and crust and not enough peach flavor.  Next time I will add more peaches and perhaps more peach gelatin.  It was good, just needs some adjustments.

The taste is light and creamy and delicious.  Simple to make and convenient with canned peaches and gelatin.

Thought this was pretty good. We brought it to go with Christmas dinner, and only had a few slices left.

This dish was simple to make and delicious!  I did what other reviewers mentioned and doubled up the creamy filling and it was perfect.  Would be great for company.

This is such a refreshing summer dessert!  It is amazing how the jello stays on top, without soaking the crust!  I will try dicing the peaches the next time and maybe adding more peaches!  I followed the recipe to the "T" and it turned out Great!  This recipe is surely a keeper!

This was very good.  I let my gelatin thicken up a little too much but it was still very good.  Thanks

This was a huge hit!  The only change I made was using the reserved peach juice instead of some of the water.  I think next time I'd use 2 boxes of jello for a thicker gelatin layer, but will definitely make again.
