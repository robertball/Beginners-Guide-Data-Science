A rather simple and quick dessert to satisfy your sweet craving.  I'm not normally much of a fan of coconut flour as it tends to dry out and have a gritty texture, but the frozen berries help with adding in moisture. First off, please do not microwave cream cheese and butter together on high for 1:20! After only 25-30 seconds, it was making popping sounds and spurting all over the microwave.  Even removing it from the microwave and trying to stir it was causing it to explode everywhere. The moisture being released in the cream cheese is not a good mix for hot fat! I would highly suggest you do a lower power, such as 50-60% and microwave in short increments, stirring every 20 seconds or so.  After adding the coconut flour, it will soak up all the moisture in the butter/cream cheese mixture, but no worries, it'll turn out!  Just be sure to stir or whisk very well once you add in the egg and extracts. I served this with a bit of whipped cream on top and a few more frozen berries. Yum!
