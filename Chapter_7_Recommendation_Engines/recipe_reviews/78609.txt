Pretty good treats.  Truffles is a funny name, though, since these are NOT light and fluffy.  I used plain prunes and zest of an entire orange.  They're sticky, so I rolled them in powdered sugar (still sticky, but more attractive).

I was greatly inspired by this recipe, but changed it up substantially.  I had to substitute crispy rice cereal for the nuts since I was making it for a friend who needs everything gluten-free (who knew my nuts would have wheat in them?).  I used freshly picked wild plums (from this same friend) instead of the prunes.  I accidentally left out the spices, but these were still wonderful after I rolled them in chocolate almond bark with some real chocolate melted in there.  My husband really doesn't want to share these!

Easy and very fast recipe!  These are a great snack, and I love that they have a lot of fiber and Omega-3 (from the walnuts).  I rolled the balls in shredded coconut, and they are delicious!  I used plain raisins, will try with chocolate-covered raisins next time.

Interesting yet time consuming. Can repeat on a good mood.
