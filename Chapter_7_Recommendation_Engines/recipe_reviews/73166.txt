This is delicious!  For a more substantial main dish I think taco seasoned ground turkey or beef would make an excellent addition :)

This is an excellent salad!!! I only used 1/2 cup of Catalina dressing and the second time I made it I used a red pepper and frozen corn and it was even better.

This was awesome. I didn't have enough dressing (only 1/2 cup) so I add some salsa and some italian dressing. I'm not the biggest fan of black olives so I substituted black beans. I also added one hass avocodo diced and 1 tbsp. of lemon juice. Yummy!

Wonderful!!! I've been trying lately to get my children to eat more vegetables. They're so used to the same old stuff, so I when I found this recipe I was so excited to try it. 
It uses lots of veggies (not just lettuce) and really entices my kids by using cheese and corn chips. Even my husband was impressed. Everyone in my family went back for seconds of this salad. I've never used catalina, but the sweetness of it brings everything together and then constrasts with the chips. So delicous! I can't wait to make this again!

I added diced avocado and black beans to this. It was a smash hit! Leftovers were just as great the next day.  We did not add the corn chips to the salad, just added them to our individual dishes so they wouldn't get soggy.

We loved this salad.  I made it pretty much like the recipe with a couple exceptions made solely on the basis of personal preference.  Omitted green pepper because I don't like it.  Omitted cheese because I didn't think it would add to the taste and thought I would save the fat/calories in this case.  If I had used it I was thinking I might cube it rather than use shredded cheese. I also substituted the catalina dressing with a basic vinaigrette.  I didn't have catalina dressing and the vinaigrette sounded so fresh tasting.  Loved the fritos. I thought about adding tortilla chips but the fritos made the salad in my opinion.  Even though I varied the recipe, I think it is an all-star recipe.  I do hope to try catalina dressing at some point.  I almost forgot - when I read the recipe I thought it had a can of black beans in it.  Even though it didn't, I added them anyway and would definitely do so again!  Thanks for sharing!

Wow!  Loved this.  I made a few changes...instead of black olives, I added a can of rinsed, drained black beans, 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped, and replaced half the catalina with italian dressing.  The changes made it taste like an improved version of my favorite corn and black bean salsa.  Must try this!

Very good & colorful & refreshing. I used a little less dressing than recipe called for. Use CRUSHED Fritoes on top of each serving, similar to a familiar Mexican salad.  I seeded the cucumber and tomatoes. The "Western" brand dressing available in the midwest is very good for this and I used the light version. It is very similar to Catalina.  Also I used a little less green onion.  I will try as someone else suggested and add drained black beans next time.  This is so great for summer.  Will enjoy this a lot, Thanks to Mrs Potts from Susie

I didn't love this - it tasted a little too sweet for me.  Maybe with something other than cataline it would be better.

Pretty good!  I made this for a BBQ & everyone enjoyed it.  I personally gave it 4 stars because it was good, but not awesome (+ I'm picky : ) I was expecting some great flavor combination & really it tastes like it sounds - veggies & cheese in catalina dressing with corn chips on top.  Might try the black beans suggested - I think that might work better than the olives.  Also for fun this could be a really different salsa served with large corn chips for scooping instead of the fritos!

I'm rating this while I still have the taste in my mouth. This was awesome. I'm not a huge fan of olives, but they weren't overpowering in this, and I think they gave it a necessary strong taste to pull the salad together. I do NOT recommend adding chips right to the bowl. Just serve them on the side. I kept telling my boyfriend to eat it with chips, but he thought it was good enough to eat without them. Very easy. Did not look as messy as anticipated. I also did not measure the Catalina; I just added it, little by little, and stopped when it tasted how I wanted it to.

Huband looked at me funny when I brought this to the table for dinner...but to all of our surpise, we liked it very much!  Used low fat Catalina dressing and added 1/2 can of rinsed/drained black beans.  Will make again for a change of pace side.

This was an excellent salad. I was so apprehensive about making it because it is unusual to me but I was sick and tired of the usual pasta salads. I was also eager to try my new food chopper. Wow! My hubby loved it too. The Fritos are awesome but definately wait to add them until you are ready to serve. I will definately make this one again.

This is amazing! It was so good I could not get to sleep thinking about having it again!  I served as a side dish to a picky group who claim not to like veggies, and all of them loved it!  Definitely serve the chili cheese chips on the side to add.  I used leftover grilled corn, and added black beans, avocado and used less Catalina.  Other than doubling the recipe so I have plenty for lunch the next day, I wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you so much Mrs. Potts!

This is a great salad.  Made it for a grill out and everone loved it.  I made two changes -- added Black Beans and just before serving added chopped Avocado.  I made quite a bit so with the left over's I added chopped cooked chicken and a small pasta.  This is definitely a keeper and so healthy.

I loved this. I served it at an all-girl get together I had. I used 1/2 cup of light dressing and I also used low-sodium black beans instead of olives, since I'm not a huge olive fan.

Excellent! Great BBQ or potluck salad that is different than what you usually see. Tastes the best with fresh garden cucumbers and tomatos. Only used 1/2 cup or so of Catalina salad dressing as we like our food less saucy so the veggies shine through. I substituted a red pepper as I don't like green and used 2 cups of thawed frozen corn instead of canned. I also rinsed the olives after I drained them. Add the corn chips just before serving (or let everyone add their own). This salad doesn't keep very long as the cukes get soft etc. Best if eaten the same day.

This is really good!! I have so many green peppers, tomatoes, green onions and cucumbers in my garden and no clue what to do with them.  This was perfect. Tastes like something my grandma made out of her garden goodies when I was a kid...  I didn't use the olives, beans instead. (This is weird, but I was out of beans in the cupboard so I washed off the beans from a can of bush's baked beans (original) and added them minus the piece of pork-It worked great)  And I grated the cheddar myself because its softer that way than store bought. Goes perfect with the crunchy chips.

Very good!!! I added black beans, cilantro, and avocado. The avocado made it very tasty. Next time I'll omit the cucumber for my husband. I also halved the Catalina and cheese.

My family loved it! My daughter said, "Well, it taste a lot better than it looks!" She does not regularly eat peppers and onions and she had seconds! I followed the recipe for the most part, but used red peppers instead of green. I added ground beef (1lb) and a packet of taco seasoning. I only added maybe 1/2 cup of Catalina dressing. After making it, i realized that there was not enough for a main dish meal (for two adults and three kids). So I whipped up some yellow rice and mixed it all together with the salad. I served it with cheesy nachos, salsa and sour cream. It was a hit!

This is a fast and easy - and delicious- salad that can serve as dinner on hot summer nights.  Our family loved this dish and had additional servings.  Good mix of flavors and colors, yummy dressing.  There was enough left over for salad dinner the next night.  Will be keeping this recipe close on hand !

I was making it last night for the next days lunch, but couldn't help sneaking more bowlfuls as I was making it. even with modifications based on what I had at hand, it was delicious! I didn't add corn, and added black beans based on previous  review comments, and a little bit of cilantro. I didn't have Catalina (I've used this before and find it too sweet) but did add some oil & balsamic and some salsa! cant wait to make it again!

I have made this twice now.  It is very good and the family loves it.  We use flaming hot fritos.

03-08-15 ~ Delicious salad!  I made this for a birthday carry-in at school.  I did sub rinsed and drained black beans for the olives, as we are not fans.  For the Catalina dressing, I made 'Sweet and Spicy French Dressing' from AR.  Since I made this in the morning, and we weren't having it until later in the day, I added the dressing and cheese right before serving.  I let everyone add their own Fritos as I didn't want them to become soggy.  We had leftovers, so I made the right decision not to add them.  The leftovers of this salad held up nicely.  Definitely will be making this one again.

I'v made this a few times substituting black beans in place of the olives and everyone always asks for the recipe. It's a keeper for sure!

I loved this and if you use low fat Catalina, it is very nutritious with all the fresh vegetables. I also added some zucchini and yellow squash. Excellent!
