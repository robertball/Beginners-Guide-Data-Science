This recipe is a family staple at our house. My picky kids eat the heck out of these.  I have a neat trick..When I get the economy pack of pork chops from the store I immediately divide the chops into one meal portions ( 6 chops for us) mix up the marinade and toss it into each bag and put them in the freezer that way it can marinade while the chops are thawing out.

I didn't have time to marinade it and had bone in pork chops. I cut the meat from the bone and made small strips and put them  in a casserole dish. I mixed up the ingredients and poured over the meat. I baked it in the oven for about 45 min. covered. It turned out great with enough sauce for white rice. No left-overs. I'll make this one again.

Love this recipe. The porkchops come out so juicy. I use fresh garlic and ginger minced instead of the powder and I also use honey instead of brown sugar. I also add about a tablespoon of distilled vinegar to help tenderize the porkchops. I like to use thin cut porkchops and cut them into strips about an inch wide. I marinade them for a few hours and then sautee it on the stove top.Turns out wonderful.

I replaced the lemon juice with lime juice, more of a thai flavor and baked 25 minutes on a 425 oven, this was so good and easy.

I just made this for dinner it was great! I did make a few changes since I really didnt have time to marinate it for long, I cut up the pork chops in bite size pieces and marinated for about 2 hrs, then put it all in a pan and let it cook, I also cooked a bag of Birdseye steam fresh broccoli for about 3min in the microwave then tossed in the pan w/ the pork and sauce, let cook another 10min (till meat is no loger pink) served over rice. My kids (5 and 18mths) loved it and asked for more! Will make again!

I can’t grill to save my life, so I did a mix of what other reviewers said. I followed the same ingredients, but I cut the pork into bite-size pieces. I let it marinate in the fridge for several hours in a Ziplock bag. Then I poured the entire contents of the bag into a 13x9 dish (including the marinade) and baked it at 425 degrees for 20-25 minutes. We put it atop white rice. 

Anywho... excellent recipe! My husband loved it. It will definitely be a regular on our table.

I cooked these up in the oven (although at 450°f for 20 - 25 minutes as I usually do), and they turned out fine.  It was fine... a bit sweeter than I expected it to turn out, but no complaints.  However, it didn't really have that special spark to make me want to do it again.

For such a simple combination of ingredients, the flavor turns out amazing!  I have used this as a marinade for chicken as well as pork.  Marinaded them for 2 hours minimum.  All times we have BBQ'd the meat and LOVE the flavor.  Thanks for this one!

Good marinade, I will definitely use this one again. I like teriyaki, soy sauces, and this was very good. Marinated for 10 hours, it was good, and not overpowering, but I would prefer it to be a bit stronger - so I'll go for a full day next time. Also, I would probably add a 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard (Chinese or Goldman's), and a 1/4 teaspoon (maybe less) of apple cider vinegar - OR just  - increase the ginger a 1/4-1/2 teaspoon.  I put these in the oven on 425, for 25 minutes - probably could have taken them out around 20 minutes and tinfoiled them to rest for the last five minutes - use a thermometer, pork should be at 170, but I like to take it out around 160-165, and let it rest until it comes to temperature. Next time - I'll slice the chops into strips, marinade, bake, serve over rice sauteed with scallions, sesame oil, garlic and broccoli. Can't wait!

We LOVE this recipe! The recipe doesn't say how thick the chops were and we get the thick ones so it took 20-25 minutes. I have never had pork chops taste so good and I didn't change a thing. I used my food saver marinater and 2 hours was enough time. If you like this marinade and you like seafood I suggest you try Barbeque Halibut Steaks from this web site.

Delicious!!!!! My husband and I both loved them. I made them according to the directions, except I didnt let them marinate for 6 to 8 hours, but only 3 1/2 hours. I also cooked these on the Barbeque. Tender, juicy, full of flavor. Very easily the best pork chops we've ever ate. This will become one of my regular pork chop recipes!! Thanks so much!!!!

I recently got a new grill and have been trying out new recipes as I learn to use the thing and this one is amazing.  I didn't have time to marinade for 6-8 hours so instead it was probably only about 4, I also used a thinner cut bone in chop.  The taste on these was perfect, in fact both my kids who I usually have to beg to eat asked if there were any leftovers could I send them for lunch the next day at school...that has never happened.  I followed the recipe exactly and no changes were needed.  These will definitely become a staple in my house!

My daughters loved this - the sauce is sweet and tangy and the meat just soaks it right up. Delicious.

I used honey to replace the brown sugar, fresh minced ginger and garlic, and grapeseed oil to replace the unhealthy vegetable oil.  I brought the marinade to a simmer then cooled it overnight in the fridge before marinating the chops.  I let them sit all day, then grilled them over relatively high heat. These got a bit blackened on the grill due to the sugar content of the marinade, but I thought they were otherwise wonderful, flavorful and juicy.  I will just have to watch them more carefully to prevent the deep charring of the grill marks. Served along a simple ginger/garlic saute of sugar snap peas and bias cut carrots with shallots.   Will make again.

These pork chops are delicious, cheap, and very little effort.  I made the recipe even easier by just pouring all the ingredients in a casserole pan, mixing them together, adding the meat, and putting them in the fridge to marinate for the day.  Then I threw them in the oven.  I didn't baste them with any remaining marinade and they turned out moist and delicious regardless.  Very little effort for a nice dish that doesn't even require any ingredients that I didn't already have.  We will make these often.

Made these today for dinner and because of Hurricane conditions  I ended up just making them in the oven and they turned out pretty well. I marinated them all night then threw them in the oven with the marinade. Enjoyed by all who ate them. I would like to try them on the grill next time though.

I'm not a huge pork chop person but my fiance is, so I'm constantly trying out new recipes for them.  This was a real winner!  I chose it because it was so low in calories for my diet, but it was incredibly delicious as well.  I followed the recipe, but I only marinated them for about four hours.  I did poke a few holes in each chop with a fork so it would absorb the marinade better.  Finally, I reduced the remainder of the marinade and poured a little on top of the pork chops right before serving.  Delicious!

These chops were fantastic!  Easy and delicious.  We ate them with home grown grilled squash.  They were just as good as left overs a couple nights later.  I will definitly be keeping this in my recipe box.

I just became a big pork fan so I just tried this recipe! I used the exact amounts of everything except i grated some fresh garlic and used 2 huge pork chops with bone. Only marinated it for an hour but it came out great. I baked it in the oven, covered, for almost an hour; probably took long because the chops were huge. It was so tasty though! Served with white rice. Easy and delish!

What I did was add 1 tsp. of five spice powder, (maybe more if I'm being honest I was kind of dancing and cooking at the same time), I only used 1/4 c. Splenda brown sugar blend, low sodium soy sauce and a little chopped green onion. Really good. I served it with Sesame Noodles. NOTE: I did broil these and they came up super juicy.

I'm not usually a reviewer, but I was blown away by this!!  I seriously may never order out for Chinese food again!!  I subbed sesame oil for the vegetable oil, sliced my pork into strips before marinating for 3 hours and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  I poured only half of the marinade over the pork and saved the rest.  While the pork was baking, I added about 1 cup of vegetable stock to the remaining marinade and simmered it to pour over the top.  I served this over jasmine rice, which gave it a lot more authentic flavor.  On the side I served Sesame Green Beans, also from this site.  No leftovers and my super picky 4-year-old ate it too!!!

This was a huge hit, and will most definitely become a staple in our house! I didn't change a thing - grilled to perfection! Served it with sweet potato fries, raw broccoli and ranch dressing (for our boys), and an avocado salad with citrus vinaigrette. Yummy!

These are excellent! I only had time to marinate for about 2 hours and pan fried them on the stove and they still turned out flavorful and delicious. I am thinking of using this marinade on chicken breasts...

Excellent - hubby and I both loved these.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I only used 1 tbsp of lemon juice.  One of the other reviewers mentioned that it was a bit sour.  It was great and I will definitely make it again.

Really good flavor achieved by staple pantry items.  And it would've tasted even better yet had I remembered to poke holes in my chop, or reserve some marinade for basting.  I think this would taste good on chicken, too.  Thanks Benny for sharing!

This recipe was very easy to make and tasty too. Adults and kids both liked it. Gives a nice variety to my traditional lineup of pork chop recipes. I will definitely be making this one again.

I did what one reviewer suggested and cut up the pork into strips and baked in the oven. I then thickened the sauce to pour over pork and rice. Sooo good!!!

These were just okay wouldn't make this again as they were a little dry and not as flavorful as I hoped.  We grilled ours and that may have had an effect on them.

Yum!  The whole family enjoyed this.  The only variations were fresh garlic, powdered ginger and I squeezed the juice of a half a lemon into a ziploc bag and marinated for about 20 minutes (was in a hurry!).  They were super tasty and we will definitely make again.

Yummy! Followed recipe exactly - grilled on the George Foreman. What we all actually really loved most about this was that it didn't really have much of an 'Asian' taste...we aren't really big fans of Asian cuisine in my family; but this was really good. Thanks Ben!

Delicious! We'll have to remake this soon! I used fresh ginger (about tsp. finely chopped) instead of powdered ginger. I also added a scant cup of crushed pineapple to the marinade. They were so succulent, and reminded me of a Hawaiian luao. I opted to use my George Foreman (too lazy to fire up the charcoal grill). I would double the amount of oil, because I felt the caramelized sugars kept sticking. This would be great for entertaining. Thanks for sharing!

Since the first time that I tried this I have been in love with this dish that is very easy to make.  Every time that I make pork chops I make them this way all except for one time when I tried another recipe that was just a waste of time.  I was courious one day and tried this marinate on ribs and I was not at all dissapointed.  Great recipe

I marinated the pork chops overnight and cooked them in a skillet instead of a grill.  Turned out great.  Thank God for a thermometer to prevent overcooking.  The sauce was light brown and tasted pretty "Chinese-y."  My husband and I really enjoyed it.

These were absolutely delicious! If using the grill, I do  highly recommend that you grill each side of the coneless chops for 2 minutes per side using a hot grill, otherwise you'll end up with shoe leather. I used Wegman's boneless thin cut boneless pork chops. They turned out mouth watering!

I thought these were very good, though my husband said they were a little on the salty side even with a low-sodium soy sauce.  We did marinade them considerably longer than called for, so next time we'll stick to the recommended 6-8 hours.  Still, this recipe is a keeper!

Just ok. It wouldn't have been different if you just poured teriyaki on them. Actually a little sour with the lemon. Wont make again.

Wow - everyone thought these were great.  I marinated for about 8 hours and then grilled them on my stove top grill.  Only took about 6 min per side and they were done and had beautiful grill marks and nice caramelization.  I used bone in loin chops and they were very tender and not dry at all.  Will definately make these again - they were very flavorful.  Highly recommend these.  Oh I did use real garlic and next time will use fresh ginger too.

Very flavourful and easy to pull together.  I threw in about a cup of crushed pineapple and some frozen brocolli florets before I put it all in the oven in a 13x9 dish.  I baked at 350 as directed but after 30 mins it was nowhere near done so I turned it up to 400 for another 15 minutes.

Excellent.  Only had them in the marinade for an hour or so and they still had great flavor.  Will make many more times in the future.

Simple recipe and everyone loved them.  I substituted real garlic, marinated the pork chops for 6 hours and grilled them out doors on the barbeque.  The chops were about 1" thick and I got great grill marks on them.  With the marinade they almost tasted like steak.

My family and I loved this recipe, but I found it a little too salty.  I think next time, I'll cut down on the soy sauce and perhaps marinade for a little less time (I did 5 hours).  The only changes I made to the recipe were to add more Garlic Powder than suggested, and about a tablespoon of Balsamic Vinegar.

Took other reviewers advice and cut back the soy sauce, they are amazing. Have made these 4 times on the grill and turned out prefect everytime, even when my husband burned them.

I have been making a similar recipe for years but had not htought of grilling..I take thick pork chops marinate overnight with soy sauce/brown sugar and a pack of the dry italian seasoning dressing. Before baking I add a small amount of water to dish and bake covered for approx 2 hours....not so muh water to dillute but enough so it doesn't dry out....they are always moist and fall apart from cooking

Great and flavorful! I pounded the pork chops thin which made them really tender. Also I substituted sesame oil for vegetable oil.

I set some marinade aside and let my chops sit in the rest for the afternoon.  As I roasted some potatoes in the oven I fried these in a skillet for about 15 minutes with the reserved marinade.  The marinade thickened and made for a great sauce when everything was finished.  My kids ate every single bite.  I will definitely make these again, it was really simple to prepare.

I thought these were a little salty, even with reduced sodium soy sauce, though I tend to prefer food with less salt than most people. My husband really liked them. The pork chops were very tender. We cooked to 140 degrees (they finish cooking off the heat) then covered loosely for about 10 minutes before cutting.

A little salty but good. I used bone in 3/4" chops, marinated for about 45 minutes, then baked in a glass baking dish covered for 15 minutes, uncovered 10 minutes. Next time I would baked uncovered the entire time and for only about 20 minutes. Mine were a little tough and dry. I used the juice as an au jus and diped the pieces in. Made White rice and fresh green beans - spashed the juices on them also. All in all a great marinade.

Delicious.. tastes just like chinese pork from a restaurant, only better!  I didn't marinate mine for as long and they came out great; if any longer might have been too salty for me.  Went great with brown rice and a side of veggies!

Delicious and easy marinade!  Thanks!  I didn't grill--it's too cold outside to take it to the grill, so I just fried on the stove top for about 15 min each side.  Very flavorful and moist--I marinated for a day or so.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am not a pork chop girl or are we a pork chop family!!  But With the price of food these days I got them on sale and thought OK what now!  I looked and looked for a recipe and came across this one and made it  just and the recipe says with the only exception of omitting the oil,, and I can not say LOUD ENOUGH HOW GREAT THIS WAS!!!!!  MY 10 year old son ate 3 1 inch thick chops!!  I will be adding this one  to the favorites!!!!

Ever since trying this recipe, this is the only way that I have prepared pork chops. I use freshly grated ginger, a grated garlic clove, and I add some lemon zest. I cook them on the stove top grill pan. They are a hit every time.

This is the first recipe I cooked on my new Cuisinart Griddler (like a George Foreman grill) and it turned out wonderfully!  The pork chops were juicier than any I've ever had.  The marinade was so delicious, even though I only had time for it to marinate for 5 hours.  It didn't taste particularly like something Chinese, just very flavorful and savory.  They wouldn't seem out of place served with mashed potatoes and corn bread.  I'll be making these again and trying it with chicken!

Great flavor.  I marinated overnight, then grilled on the George Forman.  Next time I will cut into strips before marinating so the flavor can really saturate the pork and stir fry.

I seared these and then baked them.  They were good, but kind of bland for me.  Maybe making a sauce out of the marinate, reducing/thickening it and pouring it on top?

These were quite good.  I used bone-in rather thin pork chops and about 3 cloves of crushed garlic instead of powder.  I guess I marinaded them about 6 hours.  Every tasty.  We will be having these again.  Thanks!

This was soooo good.  If you know what the sauce tastes like that comes wih fried dumplings, then that's what it tastes like!  I marinated my chops for a day and 1/2 and they were soo juicy!  Def a keeper!

Very good. I will be making these again many times. I followed the directions exactly but only marinated them for 4 hours because I forgot to prepare the marinade sooner. We did these on the George Foreman grill. Thanks.

Made very thick chops; awesome meal. Very, very tender and just the right amount of sweet, tart, and salt. I cut it up and placed over rice. Recommend making extra sauce to drizzle over and add to rice. Great side kick was the asparagus and cashews from this site!

I have been trying to recreate this BBQ favorite from my childhood with little success until now.  I used thin pork chops and found that both fresh and dry ginger and garlic work for this recipe.  Thank you!

These turned out great. I used fresh garlic and ginger instead. My husband loved them and my 15 month old scarfed it down.  Thanks for another recipe to add to my collection.

The marinade was easy enough to make, but next time I'll give it a little extra kick with more ginger and garlic maybe a few red pepper flakes.  I baked in the oven for 30 minutes and my husband really liked it.

The family loved it! I didn’t have lemons so I used lime and fresh ginger and garlic. I let it marinade 4 large bone in pork chops for 2.5 hrs then cooked it in the instant pot for 12 mins with the full natural release. It was fall off the bone tender. I also reduced the sauce with 1 tbs corn starch mixed with 1 tbs water and they poured it over rice and veggies. Will def be in the rotation!

Love this recipe! Gave it 4 stars because I have made a few changes to suit my family. I have made this recipe many many  times. I have tried the original and it is great but prefer it my way. Instead of pork chops I use a pork tenderloin. I put it  in the Slow cooker on high for 4 hours or low for 8. (I've even thrown it in without unthawing meat and without marinating, still turned out great) I add tons of fresh garlic, add pepper and double the sauce but do half soy and half water instead of doubling the soy sauce-too salty for us. After it's cooked I cut in to portions and throw back in the Slow cooker on warm so it really soaks up the marinade. Serve with rice or mashed and drizzle extra sauce on everything.

This recipe is quick and flavorful.  We added 2 t. sesame oil.  This is enough marinade for more than 6 pork chops.  The longer you allow the pork to marinate, the more flavorful they will be.

Excellent recipe. Definitely pierce the pork chops with a fork. If you don't have Brown Sugar on hand, substitute with honey. I substituted vegetable oil with olive oil. If you use fresh ginger, garlic and lemon juice, you will have better flavor.

I only had two thick pork chops but doubled the marinade, wanting extra on the side and to add to some jasmine rice. The marinade was very tasty, but the chops seemed dry to me. Maybe thinner chops work better here. I did marinate them for only two hours and baked at 425 deg F for 25 min. (after others reported good results with that). I only had a small portion after it was cooked. I cut up the leftovers into small pieces to marinate overnight, to hopefully improve/salvage them.

I didn't change the recipe, but instead of marinating it (because I didn't have time) I baked it in the oven at 400F for 45 mins in a casserole dish covered. It came out so tender and it was absolutely perfect!

This is a super marinade!  I used fresh grated ginger and garlic and doubled the marinade recipe.  I decided to try this recipe a little too late, so I only marinated for 1/2 hour, but I used a Norpro meat tenderizing tool to pierce the meat to help it absorb the marinade...  seems like it worked!  I microwaved parsnips (cut into bite-sized pieces) and broccoli (whole stems) in a little water for 5 minutes, then dipped them in the marinade and grilled them in a grill-pan, alongside the chops.  Put the veges on a bed of rotini on each person's plate, alongside their chop, and drizzled the remaining marinade over the chops, veges and pasta.  Delish!

Fantastic flavor, moist and so easy.  I baked it uncovered for 30 min at 350, basting twice.  Substituted 1/8 cup brown sugar splenda.

Kids said it was second to bacon. Personally, I wasn't that impressed but there is no denying that it was good.

Made this for dinner tonight with our Korean and Chinese students. They enjoyed it.  I used bone-in 1/2 inch chops, marinated for about 8 hours and cooked them for about 6 min. each side on the grill. The pork chops were tender and juicy. I liked that the recipe is easy with things I usually have on hand. I did use fresh ginger and garlic rather than powder, about 1 teaspoon each.

We love this simple recipe for an easy weeknight dinner (as long as we remember to marinate the chops before we leave for work!).

My boys gobbled this up.  They all went back for seconds. I loved it too. I baked our chops in a Pyrex dish for 30 minutes, though I think I could have shaved about 5 to 10 minutes from the bake time. I followed the suggestion of a few reviewers to substitute sesame oil for the vegetable oil and I'm glad I did. This was just as good if not better, and certainly a lot healthier than any pork from a Chinese restaurant.

Loved this!Very tender.  Cooked it out on the grill, but I am sure it is good in the oven as well. 1st time, I made just as listed, but cut it half for 2 pork chops, but the second time I made the whole recipe (except I used lime juice instead of lemon as per one rating I read) and I am glad I did because we sliced the leftover pork for hoagie buns and the sauce was perfect for a dip for the sandwiches. You must try this....

Made these tonight, substituting sesame oil for the vegetable oil for extra flavor. Opted to broil and then bake as another reviewer suggested. Was very pleased with the result and will definitely be making again! Thanks for great and easy recipe.

I loved this recipe! I served it with Ramen with the marinade run-off mixed in instead of the seasoning pouch. I also added about 1/3 cup of beer, seasoning salt and mustard powder to the marinade. It is delicious!

Nice subtle flavor. I marinated the chops over night and they were nice and moist. If you are looking for a bolder flavor try "Oriental Pork Chops". Thanks BennyTwo5.

Tasty!  I used Chinese 5-spice powder instead.  Turned out great, but a bit salty.   Personally, I think either less marinating time, as another reviewer suggested, or low-salt soy sauce would be a better choice.  Thank you for submitting.

This recipe was good.  I ended up marinating overnight and put in the crock-pot on low for around 6-7 hours (marinate and all).  It was SOOOOOO TENDER and MOIST!!!!  DH and I thought it was great, not sweet at all.  However, I had reserved some marinate for basting (planed on cooking in the oven) but used that for stir-fry veggies that had a lot of sugar and ginger flavor in it...must not have stirred it enough or something.  None the less, DH kept commenting how good it was.  I served it along with some white rice for sort of a stir-fry thing.  Will make again. Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe was so great.  I marinated my chops overnight (I had thick ones) and grilled for about 25 minutes.  They came out juicy, tender, and very flavorful.

This recipe is amazing. I made this for my family not telling them what was in it or what the recipe was called, I do that a lot! They thought it was wonderful. Marinating it hours ahead of time has to be the trick here because it was so good. Definitely a keeper.

Easy and tasty but a little salty for my tastes. Used half light soya this time and will go all light next time.  Marinated a little longer which may explain the saltiness (18hrs).  Chop was super tender though.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  It was great but I expected the flavors to be a little stronger than what they were. Overall, my famiy liked it I will make it again and probably modify it a little.

Turned out great.  Kids were questionable but they liked it.  I used boned in chops and cooked it at 350 for about 35 mins.  Cooked some brown rice and veggies with it, served with the sauce severed over top everything.

Simple yet delicious. I was only able to marinate it for 2 hours but it turned out great. Both my wife and daughter loved it. Looking forward to giving it the full 8 hour marination next time.

AWESOME! But I did like the others and made substitutions. I didn't use any soy sauce and I replaced chicken for the pork. I then battered the chicken and deep fried it. This is a main staple in our house, but I didn't like it and will not make it again . Great recipe! Can't wait to make this again.

I made this in the oven, since I don't have a grill right now. The flavor was very good, but the marinade didn't have that nice gooey look like in the picture, even though I basted throughout the cook time. I imagine it would've been better on the grill. I also had to cook longer than the 30 minutes mentioned for the oven cook time, probably because I opened the oven a few times to baste, as well as flipping them after 15 minutes. I will make this again when I have a grill.

Marinated in my slow cooker pot and then slow cooked on regular 6 hours. 4 hours might have been enough, otherwise they were incredibly tasty. Careful with salt.

Excellent recipe. Only changes I made was using extra virgin olive oil and I used a cast iron skillet on the grill, high heat and seared both sides for a minute and then removed and placed on the grill rack to finish cooking.

Loved the flavors. They went really well with rice and Lemon Honey Glazed Carrots.  My only hitch was doing them in the oven I went a tad over so they were borderline tough.  Next time I will use nice thick chops and hopefully get the timing right!  And, yes, there will be a next time!  Delicious...

This just didn't carry that smoky Asian flair I'd hoped for; don't know if it was some mistake made in doubling the sauce or not THICKENING the marinade/ sauce ( I let chops marinate about 4 hours ).  And I also oven baked the chops; perhaps it's best you BBQ grill them and get that very slight  charred look to them.  Otherwise, my effort here passed for "just OK".

3 stars for very tender and moist pork chops, but definitely could use more flavor. I marinaded for 7 hours and grilled the chops. Used low-sodium soy sauce and we didn't think it was too salty at all (and my husband is not a salt person). Wasn't too sweet or tangy (lemony/sour) either. Overall, It was just too mellow and didn't seem to pull through for us. Fresh garlic and a little fresh ginger would have been better. Maybe add in some green onion/scallion too.

Fantastic marinade! I baked the pork chops in the marinade instead of marinading and grilling them. I served it with rice and a broccoli cauliflower medley - sooo tasty!! We'll make it again.

Grandson and I really enjoyed these chops. Moist and flavorful. I initially baked them covered, at 425 * for 10 minutes, then turned them over and baked uncovered for the last 10 minutes. Served with broccoli and Thai rice. Thanks!

The whole family loved this recipe, very tasty and tender. The only change I made was I cut the pork chops in bite size pieces and baked it in the oven at 425 for 25 minutes. So delicious thanks for the great recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and would make it again. DH liked it. Both of us agree with other reviewers that it works better when pork is cut into smaller strips rather than whole pieces.

This was delicious! I made a couple of minor tweaks to make the recipe a little healthier. I used a less sodium soy sauce and used Extra Virgin Olive Oil in place of vegetable oil. I also ended up getting 4 pork chops instead of 6. According to MyFitnessPal, it ended up being 174 calories a serving.

The flavor was great. I might have cut back on the soy sauce just a little bit. The first bite I took was a bit saltier than I would have liked, but after that first bite, the flavor was wonderful. I prepped the meal on Tuesday and cooked it on Thursday, so the pork also had another day to soak up the flavor. I would definitely make this again!

Fantastic flavor! I changed a couple of things. 1) I used fresh, grated ginger instead of powder. 2) I used Braggs Amino's instead of Soy Sauce. 3) I used fresh garlic instead of powder.

My girlfriend and I were blown away by this recipe, I'm making it again tonight. GREAT recipe!!!

These were great!  I forgot to poke with a fork, but the flavor was still incredible.  My husband loved them and he usually likes his meats plain.   Mixed the marinade right in the ziploc bag and put in the pork chops.  No mess to clean.  Marinated for five hours then grilled, without extra marinade.  Flavor really was great.  Thank you!  Will make again for sure.

I didn't have ginger so substituted allspice.  Also used fresh, chopped garlic.  I started the marinade last night so it marinated for about 20 hours.  Then I just baked it in the marinade at 425 for 30 minutes.  SO YUMMY, everybody, including picky kids, loved it!

I ended up marinating for 4 hours before baking the chops (with the marinade) at 375 for about 25 minutes and they were so tender and delicious.  The (cooked marinade) sauce was great to drizzle over our rice too, so it made for a great meal.  The flavor is addictive- slightly sweet, a little salty, a little tanginess, and I could easily see using this for chicken thighs too.  My Filipino girlfriend says it is very close to her mom's chicken adobo recipe and asked me to add a splash of vinegar next time.   Our kids loved it too, which was a pleasant surprise, so we will be adding this to our regular dinner rotation.

We thought it was okay. My grill is broken, so I used the baking directions. I think this would have been much better on the grill to give it more flavor. I'm not sure I'll make this again.

I made this for 3 pork chops so halved the ingredients and it worked out great.  Really nice flavor and incredibly tender pork chops.  Even our 11 year old asked for seconds!  That speaks volumes.  I baked it in the oven as directed.  Next time I would like to try the grilling option.

Very good!!! I marinated the pork chops in the sauce for most of the day. Since it was too cold to break out the BBQ I put them in the oven @ 450 for 25 minutes. Came out perfectly moist and so delish! I think next time I make them I will use low sodium soy sauce to cut down on the salt flavor.

The flavor was excellent; we used the leftover meat in a stirfry the next day.  I think the next time I make this, I'll use bone-in chops.  The boneless were so lean, they were a bit dry.  I would perhaps poke the chops with a fork and marinate overnight.

I chose the oven cooking method for this and the 30 mins at 350 is on point, however, it should be noted that I used the THICK boneless pork chops, not the thin ones. Reduce your cooking time accordingly if using thin chops. At any rate, this was hugely tasty if a bit salty; boyfriend remarked it's one of the best pork dishes he's ever had. When making this in the future (and it sounds as though I will if BF has anything to say about it) LOW-SODIUM soy sauce will be used. Thank you for sharing!

This is a keeper!  I used lime juice instead of lemon and like others, I cut the meat into pieces and cooked in the oven.  Might add broccoli next time. Very good and didn't call for special ingredients :)

I made this twice in two weeks. First time I used lemon and had to use honey (had no brown sugar) and the second time I used brown sugar and vinegar (had no lemon).  I prefer the brown sugar vinegar version a little better although it was a little salty. I'm thinking the lemon cut some of the salt.  Which ever way the boys in the family loved it. I baked 4 bone-in thin cut chops at 425 degrees for 20 minutes and tried to broil quickly to brown.  This is a keeper and I might try next time rice wine vinegar and maybe half low sodium Soy.

My family really enjoyed these porkchops. I baked them due to inclement weather. I also reduced the reserve marinade into a glaze, thickened in a sauce pan added a little corn starch and drizzled over the pork chops for serving. Definitely increased the "yum factor."

Absolutely delicious! Our oven broke when pre-heating, so cooked them on medium in my electric skillet, 4-5 min on each side. Definitely will be making again!

Made this for the first time tonight. Like others, I cut the pork into strips. I made the marinade per the original recipe and will double it next time because we like extra for the rice and broccoli that went along with it. I marinated the pork for 24 hours because it made sense for me to prep it the night before. I baked the pork at 425* for 20 minutes and let it rest for an additional 5 minutes. This was a big hit with my husband and son. I served it over a bed of rice with broccoli on top and drizzled the leftover marinade (set aside) on top. The only other changes I'll make is to substitute sesame oil for the vegetable oil and use fresh garlic & ginger. We like garlic a lot so will increase the amount. Overall, fantastic recipe because pork chops and pork loin were becoming a bit of a bore.

Not very impressed with this recipe. I definitely have had similar recipes with more flavor. I won't try this again. I'll just use the other recipe that I have and believe offers more flavor.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I don't have a grill so I broiled the chops on a broiling pan at 500 degrees for about 7 minutes on each side. I brushed the chops with sauce twice on each side. They were perfectly cooked with crispy outer edges and juicy insides. I paired it with frozen green beans and carrots sautéed in a little olive oil, minced garlic, soy sauce, with sesame seeds.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used 8 very thin boneless pork chops. Since I was pressed for time, I was only able to marinate them for 2 1/2 hours. The thinness of the chops seemed to work to my advantage though, because the flavor was outstanding!  This time they were broiled in the oven, (6 minutes per side). Next time, I'll use thicker cuts, marinate longer,  and try them on the grill. I can only imagine the flavors popping!  Thanks so much for sharing.

These were delicious, but a little too sweet for my taste.  I think next time I make them I will try adding some green onion to balance the sweetness.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

We made these in the oven, followed the recipe exactly including the oven directions (350 degrees for 30 minutes), and they turned out good. Not over cooked or under cooked, and they were still dripping with sauce (I hadn't added any extra during the cooking or when placing them on the sheet, it all came out from the meat while cooking). I will admit I only marinated the pork chops for 3-4 hours, because I forgot to start on them this morning, but they were quite good regardless. Slightly sweet flavor balanced nicely by the saltiness, but I tasted the sweet more than the salty. I'd imagine if you marinated these overnight, the salty flavor would be overpowering, so I think the recipe's 6-8 hour marinating time would be perfect. Couldn't really taste the lemon juice, my husband was a bit bummed about that, but he still liked it. All in all a nice alternative to boring old shake 'n' bake pork chops, we'll make it again with a longer time to marinate. Was great with rice and broccoli.

Delicious! I added a bit of orange juice to the marinade and pan seared the chops before simmering in the leftover marinade.  Served chopped, over rice with sautéed green beans. A whole family pleaser!

I just made this and it was really salty. It might have been because I marinated overnight and for longer than recommended, but in any event, it was too salty to even eat. The problem might be due to user error, but I won't be making this again. Oh well!

This is absolutely one of the best pork chops I've ever put on the BBQ. I followed the recipe exactly as it is, marinated for 6 hours and it turned out amazing. I'll definitely be making it again.

This was great! My family loved the flavor and the meat was so soft. I did add 1/2 a chopped onion to the marinade. Like the other reviewer, I used chopped garlic and ginger also. This is a winning recipe. From the minute I put it in the frying pan till it hit the plate. Thank you.

Yummmm! This marinade is perfect!!!! This is my first time  ever making pork chops ever (what, I'm jewish :)). Anyway, a friend gave me wild pig chops and I tried this marinade. I made a few substitution:  I used raw agave instead of brown sugar, fresh ginger and avocado oil. I followed the instructions from the reviews about cooking at 425 for 25 minutes and they came out sumptuous.  I let them sit about 7 hours and it was just perfect! My 4 year old, 7 year old and husband all wanted seconds! I will for sure make this marinade again. I think it would taste great on any kind of meat!

We loved these chops! I omitted the garlic because I am allergic and they still had great flavor.  I might try lime juice instead of lemon just to see how it tastes.

Although tasty, this marinade could use some more spices and perhaps a different form of sugar, as the soy sauce overpowered much of the garlic and ginger and the brown sugar ended up settling to the bottom of the marinating bag. I added some more fresh ginger and garlic, but the soy sauce could have definitely been toned down.

I marinated this overnight and made no changes to the recipe for the marinade. My husband grilled the pork outside on a charcoal grill. I didn't get to taste it but my family said they liked it. It certainly looked delicious.  If there were any leftovers, I plan to eat them tonight.

I did the marinade, threw the pork chops in and froze this.  2 weeks later I pulled it out and grilled it.  I thought it was very salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce.  Not sure if it's because I froze it?  Anyway, I plan to try this again fresh to find out.

Very good and easy to make.  I marinated them a day and half by accident and they were still very good.

I thought this were really great, *however* if you do not like salty food you might want to use low sodium soy sauce.

I used low sodium soy sauce, and cooked them in a skillet. They were nice and moist. The flavoring is very strong I can't imagine using regular soy sauce. My kids really enjoyed them.

I made these twice so far. The first time I followed the recipe exactly except for using lower sodium soy sauce and grilling them on BBQ. But I didn't really have time to let them marinate long enough. They still turned out pretty tasty. Then I made them again a few nights ago but this time I added 1/4 teaspoon of pure sesame seed oil and marinated them overnight. They turned out GREAT with the addition of the sesame seed oil. It really gave it a lot more authentic Asian flavor and aroma.

Pork isn't my favorite but this recipe was yummy.  I am thinking about making it with chicken too.
