Okay, I feel that I made this dish but i did change some things.  I used canned black-eyed peas instead of dried, frozen greens instead of fresh, and grape tomatoes instead of the regular sized ones.  I also used potatoes instead of turnips because I had no turnips.  (I used what I had in the house.)  This is really a good recipe!  I followed your instructions except for the dried bean part. The vinaigrette dressing added just the right sweet and acid for the greens.  I did add a little red pepper to mine because I like red pepper in greens but this was a super recipe without it!  By the way, using the canned peas, my dish was done in about 20 minutes.

I used potato instead of turnips (I had none)and it worked out well.  I added smoked sea salt at the end of cooking.  It was a quick and easy recipe and is super filling with brown rice.  I also made the balsamic vinaigrette at home so Yum!

I used kale instead of collards.  The combination of turnips and black eyed peas along with the greens is delicious! This is easy to make!  Great recipe!

added 6 instead of 2 cloves, used some white  wine and salt - also cooked it down a bit more and 1 T of chicken stock  - also used the canned black eyed peas for a quicker dish and home grown tomatoes added great flavor over store bought.

Healthy but pretty blah.  Definitely, needs the vinegar and oil.

Added some soy sausage chopped up fine.   Great side dish.   Next day even better in wrap sandwich lunch.  Young kids liked it
