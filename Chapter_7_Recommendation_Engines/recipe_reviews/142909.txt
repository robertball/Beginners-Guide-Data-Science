Yum!  I modified the recipe slightly - since I didn't have an orange, I used orange juice.  I also added several tablespoons strawberry yogurt as well.  This was great, refreshing smoothie!  The coconut milk gives it a real tropical taste.  I will definitely make this again!

Ahhh!!!  I feel like I'm on a beach when I close my eyes and sip this.  So yummy!  I couldn't find coconut milk in the store but I did find cream of coconut.  I don't know how close they are but I decided to use 1/4c cream of coconut and 1/4c skim milk to sub.  I blended that first to make sure it was smooth then threw everything else together.  This is my favorite!

I found this recipe while on the hunt for some way to use up the coconut milk I had in the fridge and I'm SO glad I did!! It was absolutely OUTSTANDING! My kids and I all loved it! My oldest even asked me to make it for him again tomorrow! As far as following the recipe, I used frozen strawberries, so left out the ice. I subbed orange juice (3/4 cup) in place of the whole orange and tossed in a banana. I also added another 1/4 cup of coconut milk at the end  because it seemed a little thick (maybe because of the addition of the banana?). The result was delicious! We'll definitely be making this one again and again!!

I used a little coconut extract in whole milk and used two mandarin oranges and frozen strawberries, which eliminated the need for ice cubes. Both the kids and I loved this.

Great drink for breakfast or lunch. I added organic orange juice instead of an orange, although next time I would like to add the actual peeled orange. The coconut cream is light and rich and makes this drink taste extra special and sets it apart from the others. I always add whipping cream to the top of my drink. Thanks!

I threw in a banana and topped with whipped cream and a cherry. Very pretty. I think next time I will add some silken tofu for extra protein.

I really did not like the taste of this one. It had a weird taste and smell. I just don't like the combo of strawberries and oranges. I added a few spoonfuls of strawberry yogurt, and that made it tolerable. Not my cup of tea. But if you like strawberries/oranges, you might like it.

Did not really care for this at all.  Taste was okay, but felt that it was too runny.  I used a tiny orange and thought this was too much.  With some additions to thicken it up, it could be better, but I like my smoothies thicker.  As the recipe is, I would not make again.

Surprising delicious as I'm not a huge fan of coconut milk. I had opened a can of coconut milk for another recipe and found this recipe to use the rest . I followed the recipe but omitted ice cubes as I used frozen strawberries. Had to add about a cup of water , was too thick. Very berry!!!

Quite good; although I think it could use a spice-flavour to it; like nutmeg or the like. I'll definitely make it again.

This was alright, usually I love the taste of oranges and strawberries, so I thought the coconut milk would be a great addition.. but that wasn't a good idea, the orange and the coconut didn't seem to go together so well.
