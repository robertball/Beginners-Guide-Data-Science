Very tasty!  I didn't have any fresh strawberries so I used the frozen ones that come in the square containers (no need to add any sugar!).  Also, I didn't use the blender, just cooked them as they were.  I also added more cornstarch to make the sauce thicker.  It turned out great!  I will be making this again!

My sister-in-law made this for a family birthday party.  The presentation was beautiful, but the taste was very unappealing.  My daughter liked the strawberries, but wouldn't touch the chicken.  Out of all the guests at the party, the only person who finished their serving was my sister-in-law.  I wouldn't make this.

Needs something, but I'm not quite sure what. Not bad, but it doesn't shout "Make me again" either.

An unusual taste, but good.  Next time I will add some raspberries too.

This dish was okay...  The taste of the strawberrys with the chicken went together, but it just didn't go well with me.

This is so delicious! I couldn't find strawberry nectar, so I used cranberry juice. Yum -- what a treat on a summer day. Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't like this recipe at all (I don't really care for sweet meat), but my boyfriend and daughter did.  However I didn't have the ingredients listed.  I couldn't find just plain strawberry nectar, so I used strawberry banana nectar, and I was short on that.  I ended up adding a few dobs of strawberry preserves in the mix.  But not a bad recipe according to the family!

pretty good recipe.  It was nice to try something different, but I don't know if I would make this again on a regular basis.
