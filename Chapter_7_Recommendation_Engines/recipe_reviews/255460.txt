This is awesome BUT there is no salt listed in the ingredients.  I cut the recipe in half, which made one bundt pan - added 1 tsp of salt to the flour (for half the recipe, if you are going to do the full recipe add 1 1/2 - 2 teaspoons of salt) 
I needed to add about 10 minutes to the baking time.  I covered the top with a sheet of foil, to prevent over browning for those extra 10 minutes.  As a Chef once told me when asked how long to cook, "Until it is done!"  
Note to self - butter and flour the pan, not just cooking spray.

This came out delicious. I halved the recipe to make just one pan. Followed exactly but added about 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a little nutmeg to batter. Baked in a 13"x9" pan for about 45 minutes. Topped it with a caramel glaze recipe that I found on this site. Got rave reviews by family and friends when they ate it.

I loved this recipe! I also halved it and used two bread pans. I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter then cooked for about 70-80 min. My family ate it up! Really good with vanilla ice cream!
