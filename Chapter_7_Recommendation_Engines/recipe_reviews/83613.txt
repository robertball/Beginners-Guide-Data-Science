Wonderful!  Love using molasses -- good iron content!  I bumped up the nutrition with 1/2 cup wheat germ, 1/2 cup ground flax seed, 2 cups whole wheat flour and used Whole Wheat setting -> more dense of course, but very tasty.  THANKS!

this was great! I only used whole wheat flour and put the bread on my whole wheat settings and it turned out perfectly.

This is a soft bread, with a delicious, mellow molasses flavor.  If you are making it by hand, double the recipe- one loaf wont last long!  My dough didn't need the entire 2 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour, so if you're kneading it in, add it in increments as you knead.  I heated the milk, water, and molasses together on the stove, then added it to the yeast and let it foam up for a bit before adding the melted butter, salt and flours.

I absolutely love this bread!!  It is sweet with a great even loaf.  It bakes up beautifully in my bread maker.  I too loved it with a dilly egg salad.  It toasts great as well.  My new favorite!

I don't have a bread machine, so I proofed the yeast in the water, then added molasses, butter and warm milk.  Used my kitchenaid mixer to mix in flour and then knead.  I'd doubled the recipe, so I let it rise once, then punched down and separated into the two loaves and let rerise, then baked at 350 for about 35 minutes.  Lovely color, nice crust and wonderul texture, but it seems to be missing something. I might try adding some oatmeal or wheat germ next time to jazz it up a little.

The molasses contributes a very unique, earthy flavor to this soft bread. I didn't change a thing, and the result was a perfect bread for sandwiches or toast. Be aware that although the texture is nice and moist, it does crumb significantly when cut. When we just couldn't eat it fast enough to keep it from getting stale, I took those leftover pieces that weren't fresh anymore, and gave them new life in the Bread Pudding II recipe from this site. Wow! That was the best bread pudding I've ever eaten. No matter what you use this for, it could not possibly be better.

This is a nice, hefty bread.  it's rather soft, which bf loves, but still has a flavor that reminds me of a a whole wheat loaf.  I used the bread machine to mix the dough and baked in the oven at 350 for 30 mins.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it with 100% whole wheat flour but added some gluten and a little extra molasses. Turned out great! Tried it with egg salad. It was delicious.

Fantastically yummy!  I will definitely use more molasses next time because my husband adores molasses, but this was just great.  Thank you for a wonderful bread recipe.

Definitely a tasty, hearty bread. I'm going to try doubling the molasses for the next batch. It smells terrific when toasted.

a superb bread!  i mistakenly put the yeast in before the flour, and the bread got too big, but still tasted fantastic.  next time i will read the directions more carefully, and add the yeast as the last ingredient, as my bread maker suggests.  this bread is my new favorite.

This just came out of the oven and it is delicious! I used my bread machines dough setting and baked it in the oven as 2 loaves. I made the recipe exact except I used 1 1/2 cups all purpose and 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour. This is the first bread I made with whole wheat flour that turned out light and fluffy instead of dense.

I made this recipe as written except for using all white flour (didn't have any wheat) and I added in 3 tablespoons of brown sugar because I was craving a sweet yeast bread.  It turned out GREAT with a very soft, thick texture.  I made mine on the basic setting but I think next time I might try the sweet setting.  I highly recommend adding the brown sugar if you want to try it a bit sweeter!

Soso.  The bread was just a little to dry and bold for my taste.  If you like wheat breads a lot you would like this one.

This was a very flavorful bread, with a rich, molasses flavor. It makes great toast, egg salad and ham sandwiches but the molasses flavor is a bit too pronounced for a tuna sandwich (just my personal preference). It made my kitchen smell wonderful while it was mixing and baking. I'm saving this recipe to make again.

Loved your bread!  Halved the recipe, and made the dough in my bread machine, then formed it and baked it as usual.  I normally make my dough in the machine, but don't like the way it looks after it's cooked, but love having the machine do all the kneading!!

Very tasty bread, but I found I didn't like the combination with most of my usual sandwiches.  I found myself using it mainly for toast or plain buttered bread.  For that reason I may not make this bread again.

Great without mods. It's true, you can use ordinary all-purpose and whole wheat flour rather than special bread flours, and it bakes up beautifully. Tastes great, too!

This is the softest, sweetest smelling bread!  I only did the dough cycle on my bread machine, then shaped the loaf and let it rise in a loaf pan.  I will make this one again!

I finally made it!  When it was mixing I was wondering if it was going to rise as it seemed so dense, but it did.  Delicious bread, my youngest son loved it as well, will definitely make it again and again.....

Made this wheat bread exactly to recipe and it is my new favorite wheat because of the molasses. Yummy with butter and honey - dense like Great Harvest wheat breads.

it is a very good recipe. The only thing is it was too much dough for my bread machine, so i had to bake it in the oven and made two batches. New time I will make it smaller. Thanks, it was delicious!!

I really enjoyed this. Made as is. Flavor was different which is what I was looking for. I've never had bread with molasses in that. Gave it a distinct flavor. Will use this one again.

Excellent! Makes a beautiful loaf in my bread machine.  Makes especially delicious toast.   I did substitute and equal amount of  coconut oil for the butter simply because I'm trying to incorporate more coconut oil into our diet.  Still made a wonderful loaf.    Great recipe.

AWESOME bread!  This is absolutely the best bread that I've ever made in my bread machine.  I've made it twice now (in less than a week) and it came out great both times.  My family raved about it; even my picky son who is not normally a big bread eater asked for thirds!  I did change just a couple of things b/c I can't seem to leave a recipe alone... I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour and also added 4 tsp. vital wheat gluten.  Next time I'm also going to try adding some honey.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The recipe was awesome. LOVED IT.  I did add about 1 tbs of sugar; I did not think to add brown sugar. I will try it next time.  The taste and texture was great.  The loaf was small and I world have liked a larger loaf. But other than that it was wonderful. I most defiantly made it again!!

This bread was a big hit in my family.   I read the other reviews and added another tablespoon of molasses and put 1 cup of whole wheat and 2 cups of all purpose.  It was fantastic.  I will definitely making this again.

Made without a bread machine and forgot the salt!  I think this recipe has a lot of potential but it is a little bland (even without the salt) and a little too moist for my taste.  Like I said though, I DIDN'T make in a bread machine so that could account for it!  I would try it again if I ever got a bread machine!

Very nice dark loaf. I used white bread flour and whole wheat bread flour and increased the yeast to 2 tsp to prevent under-rising.  The molasses taste does come through a bit, particularly in the smell. This bread is very moist and fluffy.

I rated this 4 stars because I didn't really care for the taste of the bread when it was fresh. However, it was fantastic toasted with some butter. The crust, texture, and density were nice.

After reading the previous reviews I increased the molasses to almost 4 Tbsp. Also, I wasn't sure if the recipe calling for "all-purpose flour" was a typo or not (did the author mean to say "bread flour"?) so I used 1-1/4 C all-purpose flour and 1 C bread flour.  And then of course I used the 3/4 C wheat flour the recipe called for. 

If you are a molasses lover, I definitely suggest you try this bread.  Apparently I just don't like the flavor of molasses as much as I thought I would.
