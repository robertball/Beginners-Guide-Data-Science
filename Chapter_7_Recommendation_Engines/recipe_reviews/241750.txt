I was disappointed to find I needed a can of retried black beans to make this recipe.  The reason I am looking for a recipe is that they are no longer available anywhere in my area now.

We all LOVED these beans! This was a last minute decision and I only had a can of traditional refried beans on hand, so I used those along w/ the black beans, which worked wonderfully! Very easy to make and super yummy! I served these w/ 'Copycat Chipotle(R) Cilantro-Lime Brown Rice' and 'Lettuce Leaf Tacos', both from this site. I will def be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Rave reviews, served with poblano rice and cumin chicken - didn't have refried beans on hand so used chopped onion, roasted garlic & 1 can of black beans, cooked with a bit of olive oil then mashed - then added another can of whole black beans, a bit of chicken stock, 2 tbsp cream cheese. Make again!

My family has always made refried beans from a can, and I've never been a fan of that. However, this recipe made some pretty delicious beans! I followed the recipe as close as possible (with the exception of the garlic; I used pre-minced garlic and probably put a bit much in there). I initially thought they turned out too runny using half of the reserved liquid, but after the beans cooled down a bit, they turned out great! Quick and very easy recipe to make, and has a good foundation to expand upon for those creative or adventurous amateur cooks.

I made this recipe with traditional refried beans and black beans.  I only had cheddar cheese so I used it.  I really liked it.  I think I may also put this in a taco shell instead of meat.  Yum

This was a big hit at my house. Used a little more cheese than the recipe calls for but it was delicious!
