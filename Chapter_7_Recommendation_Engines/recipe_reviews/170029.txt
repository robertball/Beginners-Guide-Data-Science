The recipe has 2 measurements backwards:  1. Carrots should be 1 Cup (not 1 tablespoon)  2. Water should be 1 Tablespoon - give or take (not 1 Cup)  That should help out considerably.  Add Habaneros as desired!!!

I have made this recipe a few times and its a big hit at dinner parties.  I make the "Tex Mex Pork" from Allrecipes and put the shredded pork in its sauce over pasta and add the "Habanero Hot Sauce" with sour cream as a condiment and everyone loves the combination!  The only modification I make to this recipe is I cut open my habanero and remove the seeds and stem.  My husband and I love hot food, but we managed to ruin a different recipe when we added whole habaneros because it was so hot that we couldn't eat the stew we had slaved over for an entire afternoon. I opt to put my habaneros  in a pyrex and steam the habaneros in a double boiler for about 7 minutes.  I think this mellows out the hotness of the sauce without losing any flavor.  I add everything to a food processor minus the tomato and it makes a delicious fairly spicy sauce that pleases the masses.

I really hoped that I'd like this, but I honestly did not enjoy this at all.  It was definitely hot enough, but I agree that the tomato flavor was just too much, and I think it really needed some seasoning.

This is a delicious sauce.  I only had half the amount of vinegar it calls for, but it turned out awesome anyway.  I can't wait to make it with the amount called for.

Ive been eating a belizian hot sauce for years and finaly decided to try making it myself. This recipe came pretty close, though i must say, i used 4 peopers and it was so hot i couldnt't' eat it so i doubled the other ingredients and decreased the overall pepper to other ingredient ratio. Now its perfect. I would reccomend starting with two peppers an increasing as you go by taste and to pur preference. Thanks!

I liked this, my son said it wasn't hot enough!  I love the fact that I didn't have to wear gloves to handle the peppers, but instead put the whole peppers right into the blender!  Now I just have to figure out the best method to store this!  On second thought, it might not last long enough for that to be a concern!

I had an abundance of Habanero peppers from my garden this year. I was looking for another use for them besides in my chilly. The recipe was easy to make and the taste was hot but not too spicy. I would suggest that you prepare this recipe in a well ventilated kitchen. While onions may make you cry, the effect of the Habanero fumes feels like mace. My wife, in the other end of the house, said she felt her eyes burning.

Delicious hot sauce.  Did not have onions available, so substituted minced onion flakes.  Also, used a small tomato to minimize the tomato taste.   I made homemade pizza and used this as the sauce.  Excellent heat profile.  Will definitely make this again and again!

Added cumin, more lime, a whole red pepper, 2 tablespoons of sugar, more vinegar, more garlic, and only a 1/4 of a tomato. Cook veggies longer and simmer final product for 15 minutes, covered.

I added 1/2 cup lime,  and less water, more chilli, carrot, onion tomato , 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, lots more garlic and 1tblspn raw sugar, 1 tblspn pink salt.  Used a hand blender in the pot and pulsed till smooth then simmered for 10 minutes.  Turned out nice and spicy. Will mature very well I think.

Made this for my husband who appreciates hot peppers and sauces. This flavor didn't appeal to him. He loves cayenne peppers and the hotter the better. I was disappointed.

This was the first hot sauce I ever made and I can tell you I'll make it again someday.  It was really good.  Before Salt and Pepper it had a weak flavor, but with good heat.I used all the ingredients needed, with maybe 2/3 of a tbsp of pepper and 2 or 3 tbsp of salt (I didn't measure these, but did it to taste).  It still had a weak flavor.  I added about as much Seasoned Salt as I had added pepper and it brought the flavor out.  The burn is perfect and the flavor is outstanding.  I would highly recommend this to people that love heat AND flavor.

I didn't seed the habaneros and it turned out pretty hot but kind of fruity and sweet.  Overall, the flavor is good, I am curious how it tastes with a little less heat.  I boiled it a little longer because I wanted a paste more than a sauce.  Initially I was looking for something like you find in the stores in the bottle and this is not it, more flavor and sweetness.  In saying that, I think this will be pretty good as a condiment on some foods you would like to add some heat to, maybe something with chicken or pork.

I was lured to this recipe by the ease of the blender.  Unfortunately, it did not impress the family. I didn't want to throw it away so I mixed it 50/50 with Cholula and was then told it was my best batch yet!!?!  Not really too happy about that but glad they enjoy it.   :-)

Very HOT on my scale, but good flavor, and it works well as something where I can add a 1/4 teaspoon or so of this sauce to other recipes to add more heat.  Goes great as an addition in salsas, chili, even on fish.

I didn't originally make changes until I tasted the final product.  It wasn't hot enough for me so I added some Daves insane ghost pepper sauce to the mix,  about 1 tsp. This definitely helped out as I didn't have anymore habanero peppers to add. I do like the fact that this sauce isn't overly vinigery but I think I'll cut down on the carrots and tomatoes next time because I feel the consistency is more of a salsa than a sauce but this could be due to having to blend the mix in a magic bullet unit.  I'll make it again to see if I can get a better result that i prefer. Also I think inconsistent habanero heat from the peppers I bought from the store didn't help.  It's hard to tell if you're getting quality peppers.

This recipe was excellent. The only thing I did different was to double the recipe, added 10 deseeded, fresh from my garden Devil's Tongue Pepper, and added 6 teaspoons of sugar. It had a great flavor that everybody loved. I will definitely use it again.

I went out of my comfort zone and tried this.  After reading the ingredients my heart said to stop but my mind said "try it anyway, you grow all the ingredients in the garden." Basically you are making a spicy, carrot, onion and tomato smoothie. And it tastes just like one. I will never make if again. Couldn't find a single dish to utilize this with.  Sorry

I doubled recipe & tripled the chilies and I used a couple of shallots instead of the onions.  I used rice vinegar, since I had it & mixed everything up in the food processor (so no need to pre-cook the carrots) and then cooked it in a saucepan, as directed.  I put it into sterilized canning jars - one for now, one for later.  Yum!  The flavor of the carrots & chilies is perfect.  A friend who makes sauces like this all the time suggests letting the sauce 'cure' for a time before using.

Excellent hot sauce and simple to make. You may want to cut back on the peppers. We're Texans and love hot sauces and this is spicy.

I absolutely LOVE salsa and hot sauces and this one is in my top 3 to make.  I have made it regularly and love it.  I double the recipe most of the time and have found that I need to use a little bit less lime when doubled because sometimes it overpowers the other flavors.  I also mess with the amount of tomato if I am making it for a party because it is a too spicy for some of our friends.  As a Mexican woman who's been making her own salsas for 25 years now, this hot sauce is amazing, thank you for sharing!!!

This was my first time making hot sauce and it was so easy that it won't be my last. I only used a small amount of carrots as I don't like them. But I used 7 habaneros because I like that "fire from hell" hot sauce. It has a good taste and plenty of heat.

Made 2 batches. In both, added apple cider vinegar in addition to white vinegar thus doubling the amount of vinegar. Also, added 1/4 cup of molasses, paprika, a total of 15 habanero peppers And Dijon mustard to both. I did add one can of tomato paste to the second batch only. Both came out great flavor and excellent heat. The batch with paste had a mildly less intense heat and a sweeter note. Love then both.

Super hot with 4 habaneros!  I followed the recipe exactly, including adjusting the water per the author's correction note.  The only exception was that I tried it with 4 peppers before adding the 5th.  If you like HOT, you'll like this.  Looking forward to adding this to spaghetti sauces and other dishes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe, and added 2 peppers for a total of 12.  I also used more garlic than was called for. It made a very good, clean, fruity sauce. 
The second time I made it, I did the 12 peppers plus one reaper. Hoo boy, it's plenty hot, but still had great pepper flavor.   I canned the second batch (processed for 5 minutes).

After reading about the tomato issue I dropped it but I replaced it with a good sized ripe mango, 'bout the size of my hand and most likely if using frozen chunked I'd say a cup. I zested the lime and added it to the mix too. Used apple cider vinegar instead of white, dropped the carrots because I'd totally forgotten about them actually so that's probably why the mango worked well. 
I used 7 small peppers but I deseeded 4 of them, I still had plenty of heat. Added 1/2 teaspoon Not smoked paprika and about 1/4 teaspoon of Demerara sugar.
I made this as a gift for a friend that "collects hot sauce" and it was a major hit at the party. Everybody loved it! My hubby heard someone joking "this hot sauce is like Jodi, sweet and smooth then comes up behind you and kicks you in the head" I also got a "velvet brick" comment. 
Oh! like other reviewers I used Only One Tbl of water not the 1/4 cup! I also put my chopped peppers in a steamer and steamed for 5 minutes And without adding water I tossed my chopped mango in the microwave covered for 3 minutes to maximize their flavor. I put my paprika with my onions when I sweated them to wake up the paprika flavor and remove that "raw" spice flavor from it. Winner recipe and btw, this made a perfect pint sized jar full.

Too much tomato flavor and not enough habañero flavor for my taste, but still tasty and hot nonetheless. I will make it again but reduce the amount of tomatoes used.

I added more vinegar because I wanted a more vinegary and salty flavor. I added 6 habaneros and it was VERY hot, which is what I was going for. I'm not a huge fan of the carrot flavor and might cut down if I make it again.

As is, its a recipe for hot carrots. In order to make this sauce good u need to do a couple things. First and most important, half the amount of carrots minimum, perhaps even more. Secondly, double the amount of vinegar, and third, unless u add a lot more lime juice you are gonna need to add at least 1 1/2 to 2 tbsp of salt.... And i dont like salt. With these changes i would give this recipe 3 1/2 stars. It lacks the depth of flavours from other sauces that are actually cooked and have a fruit in them (tomatoes dont count).

Followed the recipe to the letter and I love it!  I will be making at least a double batch, if not more when I'm finished with this single one.  I only wish the consistency was more liquid.  I think I can fix that by blending it longer.  I removed all the veins and seeds from all 5 habanero peppers so it's not too hot at all IMO.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I've made this a few times and people love it.  I've made a few changes.  I use at least double the habanero peppers.  I half the tomato or less per batch.  I also add a few fresh cayenne and a couple tablespoons of crushed fresh paprika peppers.
Also once I soften the carrot etc I combine the rest into the pot and cook for a minute or so...I use an immersion blender which takes awhile but the result is amazing.

Tried this out with what I had on hand. This is a great base recipe to tweak to taste. 

I wanted much more pepper-forward, so I only did 1/2 cup carrot, 1/8 cup lime juice (only had one lime), no tomato. I added some spices (cumin, a little smoked paprika). I used only 4 habenero and it gave it a very tolerable kick.

Solid flavor, but rather bland given its mild heat. I will make it again without the tomatoes and with double peppers and it should be great.

This is effective as something you'd add to another sauce to increase the heat, but I wouldn't use it on eggs or anything that would really showcase the sauce.  It needs a little something to make it shine on its own. I'll update this if we discover what works.

My wife Oluchi Devore is from Nigeria and she loves using habanero peppers to spice up everything so i wisely chose to use this perfect recipe to keep some habanero kinda hot sauce on deck for when its time to wreck a plate!

I thought this was delicious!  It does need plenty of salt but it goes great on so many things...I first used mine on a chicken wrap, then used it on some meatballs!  I did all 5 habaneros and deseeded to of them and left 3 whole.  Pretty spicy but we can handle it around here :)

Excellent!  If you're a real spice nut like I am, leave the seeds in!  Without them, I thought it could use more kick, but my less-spice-tolerant friends thought it was plenty spicy.

Loved it. Big hit even to skeptics. Don't like vinegar so I replaced it with vodka. Muy bien!
