What a refreshing treat this recipe is. I used freshly home-made full fat coconut milk, fresh & very ripe pineapple, and almost black bananas. My result was packed with flavor, super creamy and just lightly sweet. My whole family loved it!

I really liked this.  I love ice cream but don't really care for too-sweet things, so this was perfect for me.  Nice texture, too.  Don't expect a really sweet dish if you aren't accustomed to eating Paleo, but I love the flavors, and it's sweet enough for me as is.  I also aded a dash of vanilla.  Using really ripe bananas will make it sweeter if that's your preference.  I like the ones that are just beginning to get a few spots on them but are still firm.  Thanks for the recipe!

We made this tonight and LOVED it! We don't have an ice cream maker and was so happy to see this recipe didn't call for one! It really is a keeper, thank you.

Very good! Right consistency as soon as I made it. I chilled the coconut milk also, which helped. I toped with toasted shaved coconut and chopped macadamia nuts.  Takes awhile after freezing the left overs to get it soft enough to eat like ice cream. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I love this recipe. It is really creamy and just the right amount of sweet. I really dislike coconut but the lime juice completely neutralized the taste of the coconut milk.

Great alternative to ice cream.  I added more pineapple than  bananas. And used 3 tablespoons coconut cream instead of the milk.

I made this just as the directions said and it was amazing. I did make sure to use ripened bananas so it would be a little sweet. I peeled the bananas and sliced them before freezing. It turned out great!
