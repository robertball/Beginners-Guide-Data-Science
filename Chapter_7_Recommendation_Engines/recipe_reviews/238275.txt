5.21.16  I mixed up the cheesecake mixture, and wanted more lemon flavor, so I did add lemon zest in addition to lemon juice.  The crust turned out crumbly, and about half of it stayed in the dish when it was cut into squares.  When I patted it into the dish, it felt like it needed more butter, but I hate to change a recipe too much first time I make it.  There either needs to be more butter added to the gingersnap crumbs (and I weighed the crumbs, so I know the amount was correct), or the amount of crumbs needs to be reduced...or maybe both.  The crust-filling ratio seemed to be disproportionate to me.  Even my husband said you need more cheesecake filling on these.  So if I make these again, Iâ€™d reduce the amount of crumbs, add more butter if necessary and, maybe, even add a little more cream cheese. On the positive side, they taste delicious, the lemon-gingersnap-cream cheese partner really well, and my 4-star rating is based on taste.  Thanks for sharing.

The ginger was too strong for my liking... most of the bars ended up in the trash unfortunately

I used a 10 oz. bag of gingersnap cookies and the crust still came out pretty thick, but it had a nice ginger flavor, which was what I was looking for.

Too much crust, not enough topping. A little too sweet for our taste.
