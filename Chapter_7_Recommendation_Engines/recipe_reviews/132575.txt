This was an amazing & easy supper dish! Ethereally light & fluffy (thanks to the beaten egg whites, which I didn't even beat to "stiff peaks")--subtle despite sage's tendency to be strong--flavorful enough to be a satisfying meal in themselves! 

I made my own buttermilk with milk + lemon juice (so I didn't have to run to the store), and used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano.

Mm :)

This is a great recipe and easy too! Nice savory pancakes with a hint of sage. The addition of the Romano cheese puts them over the top.
