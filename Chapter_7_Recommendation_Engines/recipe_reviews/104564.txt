The ingredients sounded promising and I really wanted to like this one, but the fish sauce was overpowering and the soy sauce made it too salty. I couldn't eat it.

This was awesome..the flavors really mingled together...I wasn't sure about it but I had everything and the fresh tomato liquified with the soy and fish sauce. This would be good to use with a bunch of different veggies like yellow squash, zucchini, mushrooms, celery, water chestnuts, etc...I used a splash of sesame oil and a bit of chicken broth while cooking since the green beans do take a little longer to cook...sprinkled toasted sesame seeds on top when finished....Try it!!!

This recipe was great and delicious!!! I served it as a side dish and my family loved it! I added some stewed tomatoes to the greenbeans to give it a little zip. Thanks for the recipe and please post more vietnamese cuisine!

These were really good.  I only used 2 tbs of fish sauce and low sodium soy sauce.  I simmered covered for 5 minutes then removed the cover.  I tossed in a bit of crushed red pepper for a little spice.  It was definitely a 4.5

I used low sodium soy sauce and these beans were still way too salty for my taste (but I'll admit I'm not the kind of person that loves really salty foods). I won't make them again.

This was a good, easy side dish that came out looking very pretty. I used low sodium soy sauce, and the result was still rather salty, but not overly so. Just enough. I decreased the amount of fish sauce to 2 tablespoons to be safe, and I didn't think it came out tasting like fish at all -- and I hate fish, so I'm very sensitive to fish taste. My husband, who loves fish, did think it tasted fishy, but he liked the dish. The only problem with it was that after simmering on medium for about 15 minutes the beans still weren't tender. Next time, I'll cover the pan while simmering so they'll steam more and get soft.

Way too salty, even with reduced sodium soy sauce and using less of the fish sauce.

I used half the fish sauce and low sodium soy sauce and this dish was delicious!! A smidge salty but nothing a glass of water couldn't fix.
