Greetings everyone, I hope that you enjoy the recipe. Some recommendations  to share, this was intended to be a vegan burger, but I recommend adding egg for those who are not strictly vegan. Also, when frying, after placing patty onto the pan, wait about a minute or two and then cover, so you can get the steam-fry effect, cripsy on the outside and moist (and cooked) on the inside. Thanks, again.

Love it, but made a few little changes a usual. :)
I had only kidney beans on hand. I added one little can of red beets, including juice, for color and flavor, and mixed it in a blender along with the tofu. I didn't add cooked rice because of the ingreased moisture from the beets. I added a whole cup of uncooked bulgur wheat(didn't have oat bran) and a whole cup of oats. I added a lot of Tex Mex spice and put it in the fridge overnight. The consistency was great the next day to shape little meatballs. They browned nicely and tasted great. To finalize it, I added a jar of tomato sauce and served it with pasta. Next time I will make it with oat bran and the BBQ sauce, which I didn't have either. Hope this helps.

Great flavor, but I would suggest using extra firm tofu. Otherwise the paties tend to fall apart.

Many reviewers suggested adding egg and I concur.  I also substituted A-1 sauce for the BBQ sauce with good results.  Texture was appealing and leftovers warmed well as patties and crumbles in taco salad.

This All-Star Veggie Burger gets 5-stars! I am pleasantly surprised at how flavorful it turned out to be. Used all the ingredients listed except for the dried sage which is replaced with thyme. We froze the remaining patties and it works well.

Im not a vegetarian and this meal was fabulous!!  I did add an egg which helped (kinda the meatloaf effect).  I also added about 1/4 cup Bisquick for it to stick together even better.

I should have read the reviews before I made this. It definitely needs an egg or something to bind the mixture together. I used wheat bran instead of oat bran, and I added more of it to the mixture, which seemed to help. They were really falling apart on me. The fact that I absolutely couldn't get any water to squeeze out of the tofu didn't help matters. It all just squished between my fingers. I think the flavor is pretty good; I especially like the brown rice. I just wish the texture was better.

We enjoyed the flavor of these.  They do, as other reviews said, tend to fall apart a bit if you're not careful - it's that darn tofu!  Not making the patties too thick, using a very wide spatula to turn, and cooking till crisp on one side before turning all helps.  I'll make again & try some variations - maybe black beans, sunflower seeds, sesame, etc..

I don't think this is even a recipe. I think it's just stuff thrown together. They don't hold together as burgers and there's almost no flavor.  The amount of seasoning could easily be tripled. I think people who change the whole recipe shouldn't leave 4 star reviews because this is not a 4 star recipe.  I barely salvaged these into patties, but they're lose and wet and do not hold together. I got 14 patties, not 8.

I saw a lot of people used eggs, but I found that add a little bit of flour and water while shaping these burgers made all the difference.  The ones that I made before the water/flour addition fell apart quick as noted - but after the water/flour addition, there was no change to the taste (which is terrific) and they held up very well.

Forget the egg - just use flour (especially for those vegans out there)

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I made this without the oat bran or rice (didn't have any) and added chopped bell peppers and it still turned out great. Next time will add mushrooms or carrots. To keep shape, agree with other reviewers about adding egg/flour.  A very healthy and filling meal!

These were surprisingly good. I have had veggie burgers before, but never really cared for them. I ended up halving the recipe. TIP: Put the chickpeas in a ziploc and mash them with a rolling pin, super easy! Instead of fresh basil, I used dried. Didn't have the BBQ sauce, so I did a 1/2 ketchup/Worcestershire sauce. I added 1/4 tsp minced garlic instead of powder. I added 1/4 tsp ground mustard, 1.5 tbs chopped onion, and a few shakes of Liquid smoke. I also added 2 tbs of Bisquick, as suggested by another reviewed. I didn't feel like it needed an egg, like some others have said. Overall, pretty impressed. May make these again when I get tired of turkey since I do not eat beef burgers.

These are DELISH!  I added one egg, used 5 Tbsp of ketchup with a few shakes of Tabasco and a couple Tbsp of BBQ sauce.  Also used extra-firm tofu.  They fell apart a little but are surprisingly very moist.  Yummy and easy, thanks!

Yes, absolutely delicious,  I too made a few additions I used the tofu, along with chick peas, kidney beans, and black beans.  For the overall flavor,  I added lots of cumin and cumin seeds and a touch of curry. I have been making these for 30 years and it is endless the the different ingredients and spices you could add.  Eat Healthy!  Be Happy!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  It was delicious!  I served it with Garlic Aioli and everyone ate it up so fast, they were going after the crumbs that were left over.  I will definitely be making this again very soon.  It was excellent as written, but maybe next time, I will try it with the egg, since I'm sure the egg will help it hold together better.

This is good, but takes some elbow grease. Trying to mash those beans took what seemed like ages, and the tofu was not too forth coming with it's liquid either. However, once that was out of the way it was surprisingly simple. I added cumin (as suggested) and used dried basil (no fresh available). Also, I had no oat bran, so I used wheat germ. Tasted just fine. If you aren't sure whether the mixture is will hold it's patty shape when cooking here's a tip: simply make a huge ball out of it before making patties. If it retains the ball shape without lots of crumbs and cracks, it'll do fine. But if it won't retain the shape, add an egg or maybe more liquid. That's how I figured out if it would stay together in the pan. Hope that helps!

My husband and I really liked the flavor of these burgers! I only made some minor changes: I used wheat bran instead of the oat bran (and doubled the amount), and added some cumin as another reviewer mentioned. I found that the mixture actually held together pretty well (I didn't need to add any egg), possibly due to both the doubling of the wheat bran and the fact that I drained the tofu beforehand (placed it between paper towels and put a heavy skillet on top). I'll definitely be making this again!

I followed previous advice and added an egg and A1 sauce. I used wheat flour-didnt have any oat bran at hand. I added thyme instead of sage and some chopped onion, lawrys season salt to taste. I covered the pan after few minutes for the crispier burger-paired with wheat bun and home fries. Hubby gobbled it up and I did too (and Im not a vegetarian)!

I was searching for a use for leftover chickpeas and rice and found this.  I made it exactly as is... until I made the first practice patty.  These won't stay together as burgers as-is.  I took the rest of my 'dough' and kneaded in some gluten, which helped greatly.  However, the spices/flavoring in the finished product was turned down way too low for us.  With modifications this can be a winning burger, but as is, it was a total flop.

My first time making veggie burgers, and they were good. I didn't use tofu, and I regret that (substituted additional rice and ground sesame seeds. They were still yummy, and I will try again with the tofu. Flavor was better than many of the store bought burgers I have made, and I know its GMO free when I make it :)

Good recipe, very tasty. The first time I made them though I had trouble with it crumbling. This time I added 1/3 to 1/2 cup of vital wheat gluten to help with elasticity. Seems to have done the trick, and it's still vegan. (Not that I'm vegan, I'm just looking for a good, healthy dinner.) Also used JD BBQ sauce and Worcestershire sauce instead of Korean BBQ sauce.

I was out of oat bran so I doubled the cooking oats.  And instead of hunting down Korean BBQ sauce, I just used my favorite BBQ sauce that was already on hand.  My whole family enjoyed these veggie burgers and I will make these again.

I was disappointed in this veggie burger.  It really needs flavor.  Next time I would add sauteed onions and garlic (not powdered),some vegetables (e.g., carrots, zucchini), and different spices.  As it is, it tastes like bland, "hippie" food from the '70s. I have a suggestion for those who are having trouble with the tofu:  Cut the tofu into four equal sections, place it on a baking sheet, put another baking sheet on top, then add several heavy books (dictionaries work well).  Press it in this manner for an hour before crumbling it and adding it to the mixture.  This process eliminates quite a bit of the water.

These turned out totally awesome, but we did make a few changes. We added 2 eggs, used leftover yellow rice with peas and onions instead of the brown rice, used ketchup/worchestershire mixture instead of the Korean bbq sauce. The first one was a wet mess that crumbled apart so added 1/4c panko to the mix and let sit for a minute--then it worked great. With those modifications they turned out great. Next time I will try cutting down the tofu by half, try quinoa instead of rice, and I would add 1/2 med onion minced. Will let you know how this turns out.

These taste great! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it is sooo time consuming! I didn't have much trouble with mine falling apart. I used extra firm tofu though. Squished the water out through a mesh sieve. Used a garlic and ginger teriyaki(sp?) marinade instead of Korean BBQ sauce. Delish! Dressed it up just like a burger with Miracle Whip, melted cheddar, red onion, lettuce, and ketchup.

I halved this recipe as it was just my husband and I.  I also followed the suggestions of some other reviewers - mashed chick peas in a ziploc bag with a rolling pin, used one egg, and used extra firm tofu.  I also found, as suggested, that wrapping the tofu in a papertowel and placing a heavy pan on top of it for a couple of hours worked well to drain the liquid out.  I also added some fresh garlic and a bit of tex mex seasoning.  It worked well and didn't really have any trouble with them falling apart while cooking.  They did, however, get a bit crumbly when we tried to eat them, but not a big deal.  My husband and I thought it was very tasty!

These were pretty good. I added eggs and still couldn't get them to hold together so I added miso and V8. That did the trick. I like the recipe but I think they are missing something. Will play around with them till I can find what it is!

Definitely needs egg. I even tried an egg substitute, and it didn't work. Also, after many messy patties, I decided to spray a cookie sheet, place the patties on that and spray the top then bake at 420. (flipping after about 15 min) It was a good idea, healthier too. I also added some liquid smoke, and used a regular BBQ sauce. Extra firm tofu is the way to go.

For a Veggie Burger this was pretty good.  Only giving it 3 stars due to the having to alter the recipe to get it to work.  As other reviewers have posted it falls apart completely without the addition of eggs.  I had to add 2 large eggs to the recipe.  I also added cumin and taco seasoning, per other reviewers suggestion.
 Tasted good.  My 19 month old enjoyed it.  Husband wasn't so into it.  He prefers regular burgers.  He ate them though! 
I started them over medium high heat to brown (and keep the shape) then covered and lowered to medium low to fully cook through.  Made them light and fluffy with that crunch on the outside.  
I did not have Korean BBQ sauce, but I did add half natural BBQ sauce and 1/2 teriyaki sauce.  Tasted pretty similar.  
We put Thai Sweet Chili sauce on the buns and this was spectacular with the patties.  
Have quite a bit of leftover uncooked mix, going to saute it up tomorrow night and try it in burritos.

This was a wonderful recipe that I would make again except that next time I would add a bit more egg to get the patties to stick together better I did use 1 egg but it wasn't enough, they fall apart very easily. I also used Tariaki sauce instead of the bar-b  que sauce because I couldn't find the bar-b que sauce and it gave the burgers a tangy taste.

First off I have to admit that I did not have garbonzo beans! I had to substitute baked beans which changed the overall flavor. BUT I followed the recipe to the "T" after discovering I was out of garbonzos.  The consistency and flavor was terrific. My son hates beans and even he liked them!

Good taste but original recipe needs tweeking just like everyone says. I too had trouble with it falling apart in the pan (even with 2 added eggs). The ulimate solution was definitely adding the flour and vaaalaa! Perfect!

Great recipe. I love the variety. Next time I make it I'll add one egg so that they don't fall apart when flipped.  I cooked them on the griddle because they were burning in the frying pan.  I couldn't find oat bran at the store so I used wheat germ instead.

I don't know that I liked these. The flavor was a little bland so I added some cumin and some taco seasoning which helped quite a bit. I'm not sure about their texture either. When they were in the pan they were blackening quite a bit on the outside and still seemed pretty raw on the inside. I made about half into patties and browned the rest like you would ground meat, and plan to put it on some salad later tomorrow, but I don't think I'll be making these again.

Very good veggie burger, though I think I under-seasoned mine (needed more salt).  I followed the recipe mostly to the T, but I did not have oat bran and I used Hoisin sauce instead of Korean BBQ..not sure how much of a difference that would have made but it still came out good.  I also added a little egg white to the mix to bind it otherwise I could see that it was going to fall apart.  I threw in some sunflower seeds after I mixed everything together in a food processor, I wanted to add a little nuttiness to the taste and had those lying around in the pantry.  All in all a good recipe and I'd make it again.

This is great recipe. Other reviewers mentioned needing an egg. I found that this wasn't really necessary. If you put the garbanzo beans in a food processor rather than just mashing them, it seems to hold together a lot better. 
Thanks for posting this recipe!

I found this kind of labor intensive given the result.  If I make this again, I will probably use instant rice instead of cooking brown rice.  Despite using extra firm tofu and the egg as recommended, most of the patties fell apart in the oil.  It's possible I didn't squeeze enough of the water out of the tofu.  I wonder if chilling the mixture for an hour or so before cooking might help.  We enjoyed the flavor, so we may venture to try again with modifications.

This was really good!  Like others, I added an egg and that really helped it stay together.  It didn't have a very strong flavor on its own, but that makes me excited to use it as a base and try many variations!  It also takes well to a variety of sauces/toppings.

WIll definitely make again!!

I liked this recipe.  I am always looking for the best veggie burger recipe.  So healthy and held together well even on the BBQ!.  I did add the egg as others suggested. I would add more seasoning next time but I like bold flavours.  Excellent
