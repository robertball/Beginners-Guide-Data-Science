READ ME >>> I'M HELPFUL.

This recipe is fantastic, however, the "walnut sized" suggestion is not helpful as none of us know what that means specifically.

To get this right first time make the dough balls just under 1/8th of a cup in size and keep them AT LEAST 2 inches apart in the oven, as these cookies like to spread out.

Funny thing is, even if they spread out and blend into one another, they are still delicious once they've cooled.

My mother in law gave me this recipe years ago....the only changes are 2 cups of raisins, 1 cup of oil and only 3 cups of flour. It will take more sugar to coat them. I make these cookies every year for the holidays. Leave them on the cookie sheet for a couple minutes to cool..then remove.

Taste like raisin filled cookies without the work and with raisins in every bite. I put more raisins in. I use this recipe for wedding cookie trays and they are always a big hit. Got the recipe originally from the  Pennsylvania Grange cookbook.

Really good cookie.  Mine didn't flatten as much as the ones pictured...but great none the less.  I also added a tsp of rum to the raisin water and another to the batter for a 'rum raisin' variation.

An extremely accurate name for this recipe! --except I did use craisins since I wanted to use them up... so Craisin Puffs. Overall, a good cookie. They baked up very nicely and were deliciously firm yet cakey cookie. It is very lightly flavored...too lightly flavored. I think an extract or liquour could boost thie flavor a bit. Or a touch of lemon zest... My bf suggested using cherries, which was interesting since others have subbed dried cherries. --Perhaps using a liquid other than water to plump the fruit... that would probably help. ANyhow, it will be a fun recipe to play with! What a happy recipe to find when I wanted to bake cookies but found myself without brown sugar!

These cookies have the perfect consistency - soft and chewy. Also, they are light and taste good. I forgot to roll mine in sugar, but they didn't seem to miss it. They needed 10 mins in my oven - don't bake them more, even if they look undone to you. They will harden when cooled.

These were a huge hit!  I followed the recipe, only instead of vanilla extract I used vanilla bean when boiling the raisins.  I will be making these again soon!  Really great cookie that isn't too sweet. Also I didn't grease the cookie sheet, this lead to less spreading.

I saw these today and decided to try them. For some reason, I was thinking they would be more like a biscuit, as they look, or like a mini cake as others were saying. So, I didn't think they would be too sweet. However, they are exactly like a "very sweet and thick sugar cookie" in taste and texture. Just not what I was expecting. They are just way too sweet for me. Using the calculate button and changing the servings to 18 will yield 13-14 good sized cookies.

I would say that these took more like 20 minutes to cook, but otherwise an excellent recipe. My batch made 46 puffs, and I needed a bit more than 3 T of sugar to coat them in, but maybe that's just my preference for coating! Looking forward to experimenting with other ingredients. Maybe almond or lemon extract rather than vanilla? Or even dried cranberries?

The taste was good but they spread a lot.  To stop this I had to add more flour.  The end result was good...but I had better raisin cookies by just adding raisins to a basic (good) sugar cookie dough...without soaking the raisins.

These turned out really great. I used currants and followed the recipe as written. I think next time I will use half butter and half shortening, I found they tasted a little to much like shortening and I'm not a fan of it. I will reduce the sugar a little too but that's just a personal thing. The kids loved them. I may try dried cherries too or pretty much any dried fruit would work with this, even mini chocolate chips. Thanks for sharing this great recipe, will be making these again and again!!!

My daughter's friend has a dairy allergy and I wanted to bring a snack to school that she could eat.  I used currants instead of raisins and rolled them in red and green sugar for the holidays.  you need a lot more than 3 tbsp sugar! maybe just put sugar on the top of the cookies? these were delicious and all the kids and teachers loved them! the teachers even saved a couple extra for the little girl to have when the snack brought isn't allergy friendly.

Very easy receipe....Thank u

A few points though..to get the powdery texture I sprinkled sugar upon removing from oven also
The baking timing is off...better to use the texture as a guide

These cookies turned out so well!!  I used a medium sized cookie scoop so they were bigger than the recipe called for and also pressed down on them a little bit for a less rounded look, they do not spread much while baking.  The 1 thing I did differently was to use some apple juice in place of 1/2 C. water for boiling the raisins. Next time I may try orange juice.  This is now my favorite raisin cookie recipe!!

I have been on a search for an easier version of a Welsh Cake recipe passed down from my great-grandmother who was born in Wales.  This is it!  I added a teaspoon of nutmeg (keeping with the flavors of our traditional Welsh Cakes). Next time I will skip rolling the dough balls in extra sugar...too sweet for our family.  Overall, a nice cookie recipe!

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes. It was a crowd pleaser at all of the family functions through our time in the military. This time I substituted craisins for the raisins. I was pleased with the result.

Excellent cookies texture and taste . Amazing!!! I would add an extra cup of raisins. I will say raisins in the cookies are a good simple flavor but next time I will do blueberries , mini white chocolate chips, and lemon zest. They really need a tart fruit to complement the cookie flavor. Also these need to be in at least 10 mins with original recipe.    And if you want them to puff nicely instead of flattening I would freeze them or refrigerate them overnight first.

LOVED this recipe and it was quick and easy as described.  I added both vanilla and orange extracts to the water when cooking the raisins.  I also used half white sugar and half Splenda brown sugar and it turned out great!   I would use the brown sugar again.

I made the cookies for a friend who cannot have any dairy and they came out well. I used cranberries instead of raisons. I can't say they are my favourite cookie overall, but they are the best non dairy cookie I have had. They are soft inside and perfect  to go with a cup of tea.

Yum! I tried to make these a bit healthier and ended up substituting half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour, used unsweetened applesauce in place of the shortening, and used agave nectar in place of the sugar (but still rolled them in regular granulated sugar before baking). The result was a delectable, perfectly sweet and pillowy puff!  I made my puffs a bit bigger and baked them for about 11-12 minutes, then let them cool and firm up on the sheet for a few minutes before removing them.

I made recipe as it was written, they came out great. I use parchment paper, and  after  I roll the dough balls in the sugar and put them on the cookie sheet I flatten them slightly. Easier to cook, less chance of undercooked dough in the middle if they are too thick. They still took about 11-12 mins.next batch I would use more raisins, or mixture of cran raisins add more flavor to this sugar cookie.

I've been searching for years for a similar recipe that my grandma made, these are pretty close. You must have pretty small walnuts out your way though, I used a cookie scoop and my batch yielded 40 cookies. I will be making these again, but will try rolling them in cinnamon sugar.

This is a habit forming cookie. It is moist and easy to eat. You can't just eat one! My cookies didn't flatten out though they stayed in the ball shape.

Excellent cookies! I followed the directions but substituted 1/2 of the all purpose flour for whole wheat flour and added about another 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the dough. I also cooked them on parchment paper. My children inhaled them as fast as they could cool! Will definitely make again!

I used dried cherries like a fellow reviewer. These cookies taste good! My dough was a little crumbley, so the cookies turned out chewy instead of cakey..Which is fine as long as they are soft!! And these are soft. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I made these for my daughter & her friends at daycare and they LOVE THEM!  They're always asking for more!  They're great because they are dairy and peanut free, but are still a sweet treat!

Very good.  I substituted rough chopped dried cherries for the rasins, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Turned out very very good, everone thought they were wonderful.  Only other thing I did different was baked for 15 min on parchment covered, not greased air bake cookie sheets. A++ Thank you Diana H!!
