Fast to make, tasted good. I'll actually drink it. I'm not a huge fan of smoothies or anything really fruity flavored like that but I liked this one. I tasted the soy quite well but I'm not used to soy milk so that may just be me. My friend tasted it also and said he tasted mostly the banana.

I didn't add any soy powder and I used almond milk instead of soy milk. It was amazing! I also put in a little more banana because they are my favorite fruit and it tasted super good! I could really taste the almond milk, so if anyone doesn't like a lot of almond milk, I recommend adding less than the recipe says or using a different kind of milk.
