I have been making this pie according to Aunt Carol for 9 years or so and I thought it's about time to give it a rating.  I have been able to make excellent pie dough for many years, but the apple filling in this pie is the very best.  My brother-in-law has cautioned me so many times about arriving to their home without an apple pie and risking being locked out of the house.  ;o)  I will continue to make this recipe as written and I thank Jo Ann Taylor and Aunt Carol for it.

I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I usually sprinkle white sugar on the top crust rather than brown. Depending on how juicy the apples are 1/2 cup flour might be just right or it could be a bit much, but I hate a watery pie, so I normally do use that much flour just to be sure. It is better to determine doneness by whether the juices have started to boil instead of the crust color. If it isn't boiling yet and the crust is getting too brown, put foil strips over the edges.

This is a great recipe.  It bakes up just nicely and the sugared top crust is just extra yummy.  I was looking for a great apple pie recipe and I found it!

This is the best apple pie we have ever tasted.  My husband doesn't like apple pie, but he's loves this one.  My brother in law wanted only this pie for his birthday.  Thank you Aunt Carol!

Great recipe, thanks for posting.  I added vanilla and nutmeg like a few reviewers suggested.  We ate it while still warm so it was pretty sloppy bit delicious anyway.  I hope tomorrow it's set up more.

My first apple pie!  I used 3 Granny Smith and 5 McIntosh, 3/4c white sugar, and 1/4 brown and it had just the right sweetness.  Follow the recipe if using all Granny since they are so tart.  The McIntosh gave it a little natural sweetness, and since they are very firm, did not get mushy.  This is my go to apple pie recipe!  Can't wait to make for Thanksgiving.  I also used the Good Housekeeping pie crust recipe--it is very easy!

This pie was delicious! I substituted Spectrum organic shortening (0 trans fat) in the crust. I used light brown sugar as I couldn't find the brown sugar specified in the recipe. But it came out perfectly. It didn't overflow into the oven either. I also brushed egg white on the top crust, then sprinkled with sugar.

This is a great recipe. I usually use Gala apples and then eliminate some of the sugar from the recipe.

Delicious pie!
My only change was letting the cut and coated apples drain in a colander for about 45 minutes.  That let the excess fluid drain off some before loading the crust with he fruit.  Which made the second attempt much less runny & it set up much better than my 1st.  Thanks!

My husband LOVES apple pie and he loved this recipe.  He said it was better than Mrs. Smith.  I took it to a party and even the people that don't like apple pie loved it.  I added a little more cinnamon and brown sugar to make it extra sweet.

Yummy!!  Used red delicious apples because that's what I had. Used regular brown sugar, not the special kind recommended. I will definitely make this again and again. It was a little sweet for me so next time, I will decrease the white sugar in the pie to 3/4 cup. I will leave my apples in big slices too because I like them firm, not soft. Wonderful tasting, very easy recipe!!

I made two of these pies and brought one to a church pie auction benefit. It sold for 60$! It looked really pretty with homemade piecrust and latice. It was pretty simple to make and it was totally yummy, especially with the granny smith apples. They really do make the best apple pies because they are very flavorful and stay firm and slightly tart which is a nice compliment to the sweetness.

Absolutely delicious...would definitely make it again!!  The only thing I did differently was that I brushed the top layer of dough with milk and sprinkled white sugar on the top of the crust rather than brown sugar.  (The milk helps brown the crust)  FYI:  I followed the "French Pastry Pie Crust" recipe off this site.

This pie was easy to make and delicious!  Since finding this recipe, I make it once a week and my family loves it everytime.  The only change I made was to use white sugar on the top instead of brown sugar.  Yummy!!!

I have been making a variation of this for years! I prefer gala or Fuji apples and I reduce the sugar a little to compensate for the sweetness from those varieties. Sometimes I change up or add spices such as nutmeg or allspice depending on how I’m feeling that day. My husband loves it as do both of my brothers-in-law. Aside from the turkey I think it’s the most looked forward to item at our Thanksgiving and Christmas gatherings. It was also requested in place of birthday cakes one year!

This recipe was just a little too sweet for me. That being said, I did use a different variety of apple (gala and fuji). My husband really liked it, though.

I've made this several times, and it's a never fail recipe! It's always perfect!  I'm not much of a baker, but everyone thinks this pie is amazing...so it makes me look good. Thanks!

Amazing. My first ever apple pie & came out better than I ever could have hoped! I used the recipe "Ruth's Grandma's pie crust"  instead of a pre made dough. I also let the apples sit in the mixture in the fridge overnight, but that wasn't intended (I realized too late that I needed to borrow a pie plate) & as a result there was all this sugary syrup at the bottom of the bowl I just threw into the pie...it came out super!

I have not made Apple pie much as we don't typically like the spices ratio used in Apple pie recipes.  However this one is delicious and all my family raved over it.
