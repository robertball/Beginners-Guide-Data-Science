Mixed reviews in this house. Unlike Hubs, who called this "gushy mush," I kind of liked it and prefer to simply call it "creamy."  While I liked this, I do still have criticisms of my own - with no seasoning I could see where this would be just flat tasting "gush." To circumvent that I used Italian sausage and added freshly ground pepper, sauteed garlic, shallots (onion would have been fine too) fresh parsley and chopped, roasted red pepper. These additions lent color, flavor and texture and easily elevated this to 4-stars.  In keeping with our individual and opposite assessments, I ate twice as much of these as Hubs, mostly when he wasn't looking.

Delicious!  Be sure not to put too much sausage mixture on the mushrooms because it becomes too rich.  I just sprayed the portabella caps with pan spray instead of brushing with olive oil.  Turned out great!

This was great!  I used baby portabellas, half the cream cheese, added some peppers and did it all on the range.  We ate this in tortillas (because I had some that needed to be used up), but it's also great by itself.

Loved them!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Very easy, very good.  Might try a spicier sausage next time.  But this was great!

I made the Al Fresco portabellas today for lunch. I made some substitutions to make them lower in fat and they were tasty! I used Laughing Cow cream cheese and fresh chives. I also omitted all the oil.

These are really good! I didn't use portabellas, I used large criminis and served everyone 3 each. I didn't use the onion & chive cream cheese, either. I grated up 1/4 of an onion, 2 cloves garlic and snipped in my own fresh chives from my garden. I topped with an Italian cheese blend. These took about 1 minutes at 375 degrees before they were done to my liking. I'll make this recipe again. Thanks, al fresco...every one of the recipes that I have tried using your chicken sausage has been absolutely delicious!

My Hubby couldn't stop eating these during the football game. I did add a bit of red pepper flakes to the sausage when I browned it. Yum! I really liked it but thought it could use a bit of panko or bread crumbs mixed in and with the parmesan cheese on top. We like a little bit of crunch and a little touch of spice. Super easy too. A keeper.

I made this recipe with large cremini mushrooms since I felt the portabellas would be wasted. Only 1 other person in my house likes mushrooms. I think the creminis worked better anyway and they're not as expensive. I didn't have the cream cheese spread so made it myself with 1/2 of the cream cheese  and added basil, oregano, and garlic. I chopped the cremini stems and sauteed them with the sausage (1/2 the ammt also) I find if u skin the sausage b4 browning, it isn't as chewy. I added green onions as I didn't have chives. The texture was too creamy for me so I added some Italian dry bread crumbs, which helped improve the texture and flavor alot. After these changes..they tasted great.

My husband and I really liked this recipe! I changed it slightly to add a little more flavor. I halved the recipe since it was just the two of us. I used about 6 oz. of Italian chicken sausage and only half of the cream cheese (4 oz.). I added sundried tomatoes (in oil), chives and shallots to the cream cheese before combining it with the sausage. Not too mushy at all and the parmesean browned up nicely. Will absolutely make it again

I've made this twice now. And it's rather good. I love the cream cheese in this heated up...hmmm mmm hmm!! The recipe I have to say over all is really good. But what I find in this is....the portion size. I have tried to find the size in this recipe, and it's a no go. Either small ones about 1 1/2 to 2 inches OR 5-7 inches...I've purchased the largest and the filling doesn't match up at all. I can get 3 to 3 1/2 filled with the amount that is written for in this recipe but no where near 8. Which is fine. Other then that. The recipe was fine.

This was a pretty tasty recipe...more on the 3.5 stars than 3.  I did change this a small bit by making them with small stuffing mushrooms, but kept everything else the same.  It was a basic mushroom recipe and there was nothing that stood out as putting these mushrooms over the top.

I really loved this recipe! I love creamy foods and this one was creamy, flavorful and hearty! I used fat free plain cream cheese and added fresh minced onions and chives to it. The only other change I made was to saute the sausage with fresh garlic and I used shredded provolone instead of parmesan cheese!

Very easy and tasted great!  I just used jalapeno chicken sausage, diced it, mixed it with Laughing Cow Garlic and Herb cheese, and baked in the mushroom caps.

These were really yummy! I added a bit of shredded mozarella cheese on top, but only because I like having cheese on top of my stuffed mushrooms. I will definitely make these again, but I might add some bread crumbs to the cream cheese for a different texture. The al fresco Italian chicken sausage was delicious, by the way!

Loved this recipe! The 5 stars are there, even though I added a couple of things, I gave it 5 stars because I think this recipe is delicious as is. I only added personal preferences: garlic, red bell pepper and scallions. My favorite of the al fresco recipes so far!

We really liked this! Instead of using portabellas, I decided to use the criminis I had on hand and made them as appetizers for our Sunday dinner. I added more garlic (you can never have too much garlic) and skipped the chive garnish. A flavorful, quick appetizer.

This was a very good recipe, we like it a lot.  The mushroom caps I got were enormous, so next time I will double the ingredients, except for the sausage, since the caps were not filled.  I used this as the main dish and added a salad with walnuts and strawberries as a side dish and my husband said it was better than a cruise ship meal! So this one goes on my favs list too.

I made these today & made one with the stem still attached for picking it up easier. The other one, I popped the stem off & cut it up & added it to the cream cheese mixture. I use to make stuffed mushrooms in the restaurants & I always used the stems in the mushroom mix. I didn't have any Parmesan cheese, so I topped with a Mozzarella blend.

These were great. I have posted a picture also

I am in love with Al Fresco!!  This is perfect for anyone who is watching their diet!!  I am so glad to discover this!!  I did some changes to the recipe to make it more healthier.  I used non-fat greek yogurt, chopped onion, fresh chopped chives, used non-stick spray for cooking sausage and baking pan.  I did not mix the yogurt with chicken but instead layered it topping the sausage with fat-free mozzerella!!  I did bake it however longer than 7-8 minutes due to making the mushroom more throughly baked-delish!

These were crazy good, that is exactly what my husband said and I agree! I used Publix mild turkey sausage and accidentally used plain cream cheese. If these were good without the flavored cream I can't wait to try it with the cream cheese.

OMG...I read the other reviews and bumped this up to something really quite exquisite.  Way better than many reviewers reported.  I read the 'mushy, runny and bland' reports, and the 'use spicier sausage,' and I went a little bit different route instead.  I got a nice apple/chicken sweet sausage and IT became the star of this recipe!  I browned it & carmelized it first.  Then I bumped up the sauce and it was heaven on a plate.  

I used large portabellas and made it a main course with sauted fresh asparagus on the side.  I used low-fat cream cheese with onions and chives for the base of the sauce, but I added chopped spinach, sauted onions, garlic and green pepper, and some red pepper flakes.  The contrast of the tangy sauce, the mushrooms, and the sweet chicken and apple sausage was really awesome.  Just as good warmed up the next night!

Way Good!! Hubs says do it again!! Added a few red pepper flakes and used low fat cream cheese to lessen the calories.  Will definitely add this to a regular meal rotation.  So super easy and a light dinner for summer.

I love this recipe. It was almost perfect but I changed a few things. Instead of the chicken sausage, I used marinated chicken (I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing). I also used about 4 oz. of cooking cream cheese (Italian flavored), half a large onion, a little garlic, and red pepper flakes. I cooked it for 7-8 minutes at 375. It was a great recipe. My dad and I loved it!!!!!!!

Family liked these mushrooms very much. I think I will add more seasonings next time though. I did not use the entire package of sausage and I did cut the recipe in half.

This was fantastic!  My store didn't have the Italian sausage available, so I used the Roasted Garlic flavor, which went very nicely with the flavor of the cream cheese.  I'm not familiar with preparing portabello mushrooms and I wasn't sure if the "gills" should be removed, but I went ahead and did so.  Like a few others, I chopped up the stems and sauteed them with a small diced onion and the sausage.  My whole family really liked this, except my 16-year-old doesn't care for mushrooms, so she just ate the filling.  I'd like to try this again, using baby bellas so they're appy-sized.

Delish.  Made a few changes that I don't think affected the overall recipe much.  Used regular mushrooms instead of portabellas, added about 1/2 cups mozzerella to stuffing mix, added panko to parmesian topping, added chopped mushroom stems to stuffing mix, used parsely for topping instead of chives (as I hate them).  Browned the meat after removing from casing.  This took much longer than recommended, about 10-15 minutes.  Total baking time was longer as well, about 10 minutes instead of 7.  Turned the oven up to broil for the last minute of baking to completely brown the topping.

This was a delicious dish.  I loved the chicken sausage, and the idea that I'm eating healthier.  This will be going in my recipe box for sure.

A wonderful recipe

I knew before I ever made this recipe that it would be 5-star-worthy!  I absolutely love these!  The flavors of the chive & onion cream cheese and the Italian sausage meld together so well.  I also love the touch of the grated parmesan chees on top to give it that little bit of crispy topping.  The ONLY thing I did to this recipe is I sauted up a little bit of chopped celery and red onion because I was trying to clean them out of my refridgerator and I thought a little crunch couldn't hurt.   The results are simply delicious and I am sure that these would be just as good without my additions.  Al Fresco chicken sausages are, IMHO, the best sausages on the market today.  I just love them.

I just LOVED this!  The flavor combination is delicious and it's incredibly quick and easy to put together.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Al Fresco has become one of my favorite "convenience" foods and I like that it's all natural.  Thanks for another winner!

I made this last night and thought it was awesome. The Alfresco sausage had just the right snap to it. The only thing I would be more careful next time is drying out the mushrooms more!!!

These were really good! And they were very simple to make. I used turkey italian sausage, because the Al Fresco brand wasn't available where I live, but they were yummy. Next time though, I will add more of the cream cheese spread with onion and chives into it.

What an impressive recipe! These mushrooms taste like they took a lot more work than they really did! Super quick to make. This was my first time trying the Al Fresco italian sausage and I'll definitely be buying it again. Makes a great last minute appetizer when unexpected guests pop in!

For a super easy recipe these are pretty good.  I've been using portobello's for years as a vehicle to deliver fabulous flavors and this one did lack a little creativity, but still good.  I'll use the sausage again, but will use low-fat cream cheese and mix in some sauteed onion, garlic and spinach.

I love just about anything on a portabella, so I was really looking forward to this dish.  Unfortunately, it just didn't work for me.  It's only saving grace was the sausage which was great!  The mushrooms needed more liquid to soften up a little, as far as I'm concerned.  The consistency of the mushroom and the creaminess of the filling just didn't work together.  The flavored cream cheese overwhelmed the great flavor of the sausage.  Would not make again.

Al Fresco chicken sausages are really delicious. This is a great dish that is easy, looks pretty and tastes wonderfully. My husband doesn't like cream cheese but he said he doesn't mind it at all when used this way. I drained the liquid that the portabellas yielded before serving them.

This certainly qualifies as a little bit of decadence on a plate!  Rich and creamy.  I served the mushrooms on a bed of spinach and arugula dressed with balsamic vinegar which gave a nice acidic balance to the very rich filling.

This was delicious. Simple but so so tasty.  I made was using sweet Italian pork sausage because that's what I had on hand, but it would be delicious either way.  I also sautéed fresh diced onion, tomato, and bell pepper into it for some more substance. Would definitely make again!

Delicious. I used a spinach and red onion chicken sausage; the flavored blended well with the onion and chive cream cheese. Never having baked portobello mushrooms before I didn't realize how much liquid they release. Next time I will try placing them on a rack or broiler pan. Also, I was making them as an appetizer to share so I will quarter them before I sprinkle the Parmesan cheese and bake as they were difficult to cut  without affecting their appearance after they were baked. Definitely will be making theses again. Everyone loved them.

This dish is AMAZING!!! One of my new favorites! I added red pepper flakes and a little garlic to the chicken sausage. Highly recommended! Next time I will use non fat cream cheese to make it even more healthy.

I've made this twice, the first time I doubled the recipe for my family at Thanksgiving, I used  fit and active brand turkey Italian spice link sausage ( I just cut it up into pieces as it was browning ) , plus since I have an iPhone I get little pics and sale tags along side the ingredients list-where the onion and chive cream cheese was listed there was a picture of sour cream instead, so I used it thinking that perhaps that was a mistake ( I've never seen onion and chive cream cheese ) I used baby bells and a mix of low fat Italian blend cheese along with the Parmesan. It turned out great, everyone loved it . Now the second time I had to make enough for my husband's entire department for their Christmas party-so I used six-eight cartons of baby bells, five pounds of  ground pork sausage ( cheaper and less work not having to cut it up )  , chopped onions, both sour cream and cream cheese, plus the shredded Italian /Parmesan blend cheese , garlic and black pepper. This made a whole crock pot full with enough "sauce/filling" left over to make a " bed" in the bottom of the crock to put the mushrooms in so that they wouldn't stick/dry out. My husband's crew ate it all !!! This recipe is a keeper

I am a fan of stuffed mushrooms but did not care for these.  I wish I had done what others did and just stuffed white button mushrooms, I think they would have turned out better.  The portobellos did not stand up to the stuffing and it went all over the pan.  The stuffing was not special.  I added a handful of chopped fresh spinach but that did not even liven it up.  I won't be making these again.

Sausage just isn't my thing and neither is cream cheese.  However, when given the assignment to cook Al Fresco sponsored recipes, this one caught my eye.  I used much less cream cheese (enough to keep the sausage together) and chose not to add black pepper (in the directions, yet not listed in the ingredients).  I ate half of one and was OK w/it.  Mr. LTH really enjoyed them.  Would I make them again?  Nope.  Are they worth trying if you have some sausage and mushrooms to use?  Absolutely...

We're not big portabella mushroom fans, but love "stuffed mushrooms" so we used large white mushrooms instead. I made the mistake of buying plain cream cheese instead of the one WITH chives/onions and just added fresh chives with sauteed onions to the cream cheese. Used a food processor and pulsed all the ingredients, including cooked sliced sausages, to a chunky texture. Added a pinch of parmesan cheese to the bottom of the mushroom caps before adding the spoonful of "stuffing", then a pinch of panko & parmesan on top. Baked in the oven for 6 min with the last 2 on broil to crisp/brown the tops. We LOVED them! Will definitely try this recipe with the Roasted Garlic Al Fresco!

These were unbelievably easy to put together and very flavorful considering it had so few ingredients. 8 minutes was the perfect cooking time for my large portabella caps.   In future, I think I would make this using the small portabello mushrooms for a smaller bite.  The filling is very rich due the cream cheese.

We thought these were delicious! I had smaller (stuufing size) portabella mushrooms that had stems, so I followed another reviewer and chopped them fine and added them in the pan w/ the sausage, along with some finely chopped onion. I seasoned it all w/ garlic powder, salt and pepper and allowed it to cool to room temp before mixing it w/ the cream cheese. I could not find the al-fresco Italian chicken sausage in my store, so I just used the store brand chicken sausage. Hubby said that he would request these, so that makes them a winner in my book! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made several changes - but mostly with amounts.  I used the Andioulle Sausage since that is what I had on hand.  I felt it would have more kick to it anyway than the regular sweet sausage.  I think the buffalo sausage would be a great switch up too, with a little franks added to the cream cheese mixture.    

I ended up using only 1 sausage and sauteed some of the mushroom stems with the sausage.  I sprinkled the tops with a little panko before baking to give it a little "crunch"  They were yummy!

I'll give these 5 stars because they were really good AND pretty fast/easy.  Added some onions, shallots, garlic all finely chopped along with some sun-dried tomatoes as recommended by another reviewer and they were gobbled up at dinner party tonight.  This one's going in the recipe box!
