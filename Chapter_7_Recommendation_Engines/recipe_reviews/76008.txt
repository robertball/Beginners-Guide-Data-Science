I would give this 5 stars for flavor and ease of preparation, but reduced it to 4 because the presentation wasn't very pretty, so I couldn't give them as gifts.  When you stir all the pistachios and cherries into the chocolate, you lose the red and green color and it all turns out like a lumpy, off-white mixture.  Next time I would pour the chocolate into the pan by itself and then sprinkle the nuts and cherries over the top.  That way it would be red, green, and white - perfect Christmas colors!  It was absolutely delicious, by the way.  I'm still eating it now!

These turned out great but wasn't sure what bars of vanilla-flavoured candy coating were so left them out. Just added more white chocolate chips.

It doesn't get any easier--or more foolproof--than this. I halved the recipe, using almonds instead of more expensive pistachios, and it turned out fantastically. Despite my attempt at screwing up even this easy no-bake recipe (turned my head away from the microwave too long, and scorched the interior of the pile of white chocolate chips a light brown--but with a few tablespoons of water added and the chips stirred around, it turned a perfect creamy off-white), this recipe went off without a hitch, and disappeared at the social dance I brought it to. I even got the compliment, "Wow! This tastes like something I'd get at Kilwin's!"

This was so easy to make! I made little bags of Christmas candy for a group outing, and decided at the last minute to make this to add to them.  I lined my pan with foil and sprayed it with cooking spray, then put a thin layer of melted white cocolate on it.  I sprinkled most of the pistachios and cherry-flavored Craisins on that (I already had them), then drizzled the rest of the white chocolate over it.  Then I took the remaining pistachios and fruit and sprinkled it on top, pressing it down lightly.  After it was firm, I just lifted it out of the pan, peeled away the foil and gently broke it into small wedge-shaped pieces.  It looked beautiful stacked with the fudge and other candies in little clear bags decorated with snowflakes and a red ribbon. Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out gorgeous!  Substituted cranberries for the cherries, and after I ran out of pistachios, used sliced almonds.    Put them in pretty see-through boxes and tied with a bright red ribbon.  GORGEOUS for Christmas gifts!

I used cranberries and pistachios..  As another poster mentioned, I also subbed shortening for the vanilla candy coating (what is that?).  Instead of microwaving. I melted in a pan on top of a pot of boiling water. Spread the chocolate first and then add the cranberries and pistachios.. Huge hit.. 4 batches in 2 days.

Super simple and quick.  This recipe received rave reviews from my picky father.  I replaced the pistachios with whole almonds and the vanilla coating with more white chocolate chips.  I scored the bark halfway through chilling which made breaking into squares clean and simple.

Very good but I think I'll use Craisins next time, the cherries are a little too sweet.

Great for gift giving or eating yourself!  These were very easy to make with no problems whatsoever.  I had some white bark left over from another recipe from this site "Crunchy Peanut Bark".  It's nice to have on hand for last minute gifts too.  I portioned one batch into 4 gift bags.  When you take the cost to make this divided by how many people or families it's an inexpensive gift that tastes great!  Didn't change the recipe at all.  Will make more tomorrow.

Super good.  The only change I made was using dried cranberries (cheaper).  I bought pre-shelled pistachios to make it easier on me.  I dropped the nuts and fruit on top of the melted choc/bark mixture and then drizzled more white chocolate on top.

This bark was so good! I took it to a party this week and gave it to friends for Christmas. Everyone loved it. The only thing I'll do different next time is find pre-shelled pistachios. Shelling and peeling the pistachios took way too much time.

I didn't have white chocolate chips so used all Almond Bark. I don't think I heated it up long enough because it didn't spread very smoothly into the cookie sheet and isn't as lovely as I imagined but it tastes really good. Also made some with dark chocolate and it was very yummy and loaded with antioxidants!!

I made this recipe last year as part of  my food gift packages for family and friends.  They were a huge success. Everyone seemed to really like the combination of cherries and pistachios.  Thanks for a tasty and easy recipe.

This was an absolutely HUGE hit when I made it and brought it in to work. People kept hovering around the plate and grabbing more pieces, and in no time, it was gone! I will definitely make it again this holiday season.

Fantastic!  I made this last Christmas and forgot to review it.  It was a very popular item on my cookie trays.  I think this year I'll use real white chocolate for even more decadence.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Very good, but mine didn't come out very pretty.  I had trouble with melting the chocolate and I used too much pistachio, but the taste was still there.

I've made this before and it never fails. Only thing I do different is I use semi-sweet chocolate on the bottom and drizzle with white. Pistachios and Craisins are good. Can take or leave the coconut as my family isn't so fond of it.

I have made a recipe very similar to this using 2lb vanilla candy coating, 1 1/2 C pistachios, 1 1/2 C dried cherries and 1 tsp grated orange peel. Mix the cherries and pistachios in a bowl with the orange peel. Add that to the melted candy coating, that way orange is incorporated better. YOU SIMPLY MUST TRY WITH GRATED ORANGE PEEL!! It takes it to another level of flavor that is absolutely outstanding!

A perfect recipe for a new year gift at work. I  made the changes as per the other reviews
1. used cranberries for a batch and cherries for the other
2. Mixed it up with pretzels
3. sprinkled them instead of mixing  them in, made it look prettier
4. drizzled dark chocolate it give it a gourmet finish.
Wonderful recipe, thank you.

I followed the directions and "burned" the chip mix. After buying a second batch, I melted the mix in a double boiler. The result was much better.

A friend brought us a holiday tin with this, OMG delicious. But instead of cutting into squares she broke it into pieces, perfect presentation. The colors reminded me of stained glass. My husband waiting for me to make a batch, big hit!

Made this using cranberries instead of cherries.  Didn't mix the nuts and berries into the chocolate, but sprinkled them on top for better presentation.  I would make this again for Christmas gifts and gatherings.
