Better method-Use 1 head cauliflower cut into florets and seasoned with 2-3 tablespoons olive oil, salt, pepper, and minced garlic to taste. Roast on a baking sheet in a 400 degree oven for 20-25 minutes. Meanwhile, make pasta and drain. Toss cauliflower and pasta together (with olive oil from baking sheet) and add 1/2 cup pasta water. Combine. Top with cheese. YUMMY! Something truly wonderful happens when you roast cauliflower. Must try!

I always roast the cauliflower instead of steaming it. It adds so much more flavor. I toss it with a little olive oil (about 2 tbls per lg head of cauliflower), salt, pepper, granulated garlic and a little onion powder and then roast it in a very hot oven (425*) until very golden brown and pretty limp. Toss that in with your pasta and you will see why roasting the cauliflower instead of steaming it makes all the difference in the world.  This is a very common menu item for Meatless Mondays at our house. A lg, full head of cauliflower is just enough for a 16 oz. box of pasta and feeds a family of four nicely as a main dish, with leftovers for the next day. If you can't find a good sized cauliflower (at least 2 to 2 1/2 pounds) then buy two smaller ones. Break the cauliflower up into pieces about as large as a toddler's fist.

I used a head of cauliflower and two bunches of brocolli in this recipe. I also found that using 2 tablespoons of oil was enough. I used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated.

This is the second time I've reviewed this recipe, but I can't seem to edit my initial post...In an attempt to avoid having to wash another pan, I merely "steamed" the cauliflower with the onion  and garlic powder in a covered saute pan.  When they were tender I added some white wine and butter for extra flavor and to make a sort of sauce for the pasta.  I tossed the cooked pasta with the veggie mixture before topping with cheese.

I have made this twice now and we have decided it is a "keeper".  I did not use 1/2 cup of oil, more like 1-2 T., and a little more pamesan cheese. Delicious!! Better than boring steamed cauliflower!!

I did not steam my cauliflower. Instead, I tossed it with a little EVOO and some salt/fresh ground pepper and roasted it. I did increase the garlic by a few cloves, I upped the parmesan cheese and I threw in a little crushed red pepper flake. Not only was this quick to prepare, the boys thought it was very good--even my cauliflower hating husband.

Used less oil & added some pasta water as suggested. Also, added 1/4 cup pinenuts & one more clove of garlic, omitted garlic powder. Quick & Easy!

This was a pretty good meal.  I made a few changes though - I roasted the cauliflower and onion in the oven and I think that really made a lot of difference.  I coated them in about 2 TBS of olive oil and that was plenty.  I also added a bit more garlic then was called for.  Per the suggestion of other reviewers,  I did add about 1/2 cup of the pasta water to the mix afterwards, which really helped with the dryness.  It was very tasty, but next time I will definitely add broccoli and mushrooms.

My suggestion is to avoid measuring and instead add salt, pepper, garlic powder, olive oil, Parmesan, and your own favorite shredded cheese all to your heart's desire.  I roasted the cauliflower with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and it came out great! Then mixed it into the onions and added it to the pasta along with 2 types of cheese (parm and shredded Gouda). I also agree with the suggestion to add back some of the cooking water to the pasta; I used a whole grain pasta, and it soaked it right up.  I can see why some people found this recipe a little dry.  It's good, but the flavor is not wonderful/intense enough for 5 stars.

This wouldn't be a good meal on its own, as the flavors were very mild.  I used fresh cauliflower, only 2 tbsp oil and pasta water.  It goes well with a strong flavored main dish.

I thought this was very good. I roasted the cauliflower, onion, broccoli and garlic (5 cloves) in the oven with olive oil and then tossed with the pasta. I left out the additional garlic powder and used lots of freshly grated parmesan cheese.

Absolutely delicious!  Since it was my first time making this, I realized, after the fact, that over over cooked the cauliflower a bit. I also think that using a little less olive oil would be better.  Overall, the flavor of the onions and garlic, sauteed with the caulifower and paired with pasta was amazing!

Great recipe!  I did half cauliflower/half broccoli.  Loved it.  I too used less oil.  Next time I plan on adding about twice as much veggies.  We plan on making this a favorite of ours!

If I had prepared this as written the most stars I would have given it would be 3.  I ended up steaming the cauliflower in w/the onions after they cooked (in a LOT less oil!) for a few minutes.  I had just made chix broth so I added two ladels-full and a bit of white wine for flavor.  With my changes I still only gave it 4 stars.  Thing is, the entire receipe is WHITE.  White cauliflower, white pasta, white onions, white parm (I used Romano which was THE saving grace).  I'd try again with broccoli perhaps... or perhaps not.   Husband enjoyed it tho.

We didn't really care for this. I did add the pasta water, which helped a lot, but it was still dry and kind of bland.  I think we would have liked it better with some alfredo sauce.

The delicious factor on this particular dish was surprisingly great. I made a few minor adjustments to satisfy my palette. Take them for what they may be; I added almost two heads of cauliflower to make it a bit more hardy. It's about 70% noodles and 30% cauliflower. I was shooting for about 50/50. Make sure you have a good al dente recipe. It makes all the difference. I placed a piece of black pepper/lemon salmon on top and it added another dimension to an already great dish. Bon appetit.

This was such a nice surprise and change! I cooked the cauliflower in with the garlic/onion with some chicken stock and white wine. I added some red pepper flakes and minced fresh rosemary. This was light and delicious.

I made this for dinner tonight for my husband and I.  We both liked it but not enough to make it again.  Changed the recipe a wee bit by adding 1/3 cup of the pasta water, 2 balls of frozen spinach instead of parsley, 3 cloves of fresh garlic in place of the combination.  I too roasted the vegetables.  It didn't taste bad at all but rather just a personal preference to not have it again.  Thanks for the recipe and the experience!

Made this the other night and I reduced the olive oil to 3 Tablespoons...when I repeat this recipe, I'll reduce it to 2 Tablespoons. Added some chopped pepper along with the onion; omitted the garlic powder but increased the fresh garlic; subsituted fresh oregano for the parsley. This is definately a keeper and will also try it with broccoli.

I did a member's suggestion of roasting the garlic in the oven and using only 3 Tbsp of olive oil instead of 1/2 cup.  We really enjoyed this!  It is a great alternative to a meat dish.  Will definately make again.

Cut about a pound of bacon into pieces. Cook. Use some of the bacon grease in place of the oil. This will add the missing flavor and extra protein some are looking for. A few more calories, but as a main dish it works.

My husband has made this dish for years and it's always a hit.  The only things he does differently is to throw the cauliflower  in with the pasta to cook and also adds anchovies with the onion and garlic. The anchovies virtually disappear but the flavor they add is a really great thing! Try it. You will be surprised how much flavor it adds even if you don't think you are an anchovy fan! I didn't think I was but wouldn't want this dish without it! it is a great main dish and possibly even better as a side dish with steaks.

I tried this once as written, very bland. Next time I roasted the cauliflower & onion & garlic, added olive oil, salt & pepper before roasting. Then I cooked the pasta (penne rigate) and mixed in some some leftover marinara, shredded mozzarella & parmesean. Put in in the oven until the cheese melted. Everyone loved it!

I think the amount of olive oild should be cut in half, i tried with the 1/2 cup and the noodles were far too greasy for my tastes. However, my kid loved the meal.

This dish was a staple in my sicilian family household growing up.  My mom always made it with the addition of peas and we didn't have it with spaghetti but with ditalini.  

I still make this as a fall dish when cauliflower is fresh at the farm stands.

I went ahead and cooked the cauliflower in the pan along with the onion.  Worked great and I didn't have to clean my steamer pot.  I agree with another that roasting would be delicious too, adding a new element of flavor.  Could have used a few more fresh herbs to brighten it up a bit..maybe some fresh lemon juice... pretty good as is though.

I am sure the premier recipe as prepared by the lady that posted it is great, yet I also thank those who added ideas leading to my own concoction. I went with the roasting suggestion. I also added red pepper flakes. I mixed 2 types of pasta; whole wheat spaghetti and an ever-so-slightly-thicker bucatini adding texture. Also, 3 tablespoons of minced garlic instead of the 2 cloves.

Based on some of the other reviews, I must be really odd, because I made this as written and I loved it!  The only change I made was minor- and that was using a shallot in place of the onion (just because I had one that needed to be used).  To be honest, I really didn't expect to like this as much as I did, and I was absolutely shocked when I was immediately asked by my meat loving BF when I will make it again.  I can see how roasting the cauliflower rather than steaming it would be delicious, and I will probably try that next time, but we truly really enjoyed this as written.  Thanks ANGCHICK!  This is a keeper for us  :)

This was very yummy, but just like other people who have reviewed this, DEFINITELY save some pasta water to add in at the end.  I would even sautee more onions to add because it makes the pasta nice and sweet. I will be making this recipe again, for sure! Thanks!

This was awsome! I added shrimp to it, and my two yearld and husband could not eat it fast enough. Will make it in the future for sure, and maybe will add sliced tomatoes to it, since it is one of my daughter's favorite vegie.

I always like to find more ways to use cauliflower.  This one is very good.  I halved the recipe (just us 2), and followed a few suggestions from other reviewers: roasted the cauliflower, added a little pasta water, some chili flakes, and a bit of butter to the sauce.  Also decreased the olive oil, using only about 1.5 Tbs which I tossed with the cauliflower for roasting.  Thanks for posting!

Great easy dish. Followed other reviewers comments and added broccoli and chicken. Roasted broccoli, cauliflower and onion for 30 minutes @ 425. Combined all ingredients with 1/4 c pasta water and 1/2 c fresh grated parmesan cheese. So yummy!!

I liked the recipe, but I also roasted the cauliflower, onion, and garlic in the oven.  I only used about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and  increased slightly the amount of pasta water.  I also added a few teaspoons of light cream cheese and stirred it into the finished pasta/cauliflower mixture along with the parmesan cheese.

Only thing I I did was use less oil and I made a quick butter sauce with butter, des parsley flakes, garlic powder, and basil.  I tossed the pasta with the butter sauce first, then tossed the cauliflower mixture into the pasta.  Delish!!!

This was quick, easy and delicious!  I used about half the amount of olive oil it called for- 1/2 cup seemed like a lot.  I also used a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic b/c we love garlic and I added some soy sauce to it for a little more flavor and used a broccoli/cauliflower mix- excellent recipe!  I would have added some crushed red pepper to it as well, but thought it might make it too spicy for our 17 month old (who also enjoyed it very much!).  The only thing I would have done differently is that I would have saved some of the pasta water to add to the dish as it would have given it a better 'sauce'- it was a little dry without it (perhaps b/c I didn't use as much oil as it called for- but again, it seemed like a lot and I think the pasta water would have finished it off perfectly).

As written this would be pretty bland. Like others I roasted the cauliflower and added a few cloves of garlic. To the onion sauté I added 1/2 C of white wine, 1/2 C of water and 2 chicken boullion cubes. Added generous salt and pepper and fresh parm. With the additions it was good. Not sure if I will make this again though.

I did what most other reviewers did and roasted the cauliflower florets.  I used fresh garlic, added a pinch of red pepper flakes and totally forgot the Parmesan.  I really liked this and will make it again.  Thanks!

Google found this recipe for me when I had a bunch of leftover cauliflower. As always, I took the advice of previous reviewers and did half cauliflower and half broccoli. I also skipped the garlic powder, but added chilli flakes (3 shakes worth for a halved recipe). I also threw on a bunch of freshly ground pepper and was generous with the parmeasan.  Deliciousness ensued! It was a fully satisfying meal with just enough kick. Leftovers heated up well the next day! I will definitely make again! Yum!

i admit i thought this looked lame and tasteless, but thought i'd try it b/c of the good reviews and it didn't require a trip to the store.   i was wrong, it is great.

as suggested, i roasted the cauliflower and onion along with A LOT of fresh pressed garlic in a drizzle of olive oil and added 1/2 c. pasta water at the end.  i also decreased pasta to 1/2 lb. bc thats what i had and thought that was a good ratio -- i would never make this with the full lb.  drizzeled with a little more olive oil and few shakes of cavendar's greek seasoning, topped with fresh grated parmesan -- YUM.  on my third bowl.

I thought this was tasty.  I used both broccoli and cauliflower. Be sure to use plenty of salt, black pepper and cheese.  Taste test before tossing with pasta.  A little bit of red pepper flakes can be good to give it a kick.  I added in some shrimp and it was a good mix.

It was a nice meal. I am going to look at other reviews for ideas to perk it up abit.
