I was totally against even tasting this fudge, much less even making it. However, my coworker made it and I tried a piece. Then two. It was very good! I tried making it this weekend because I needed a last-minute dessert item to take to a party. Not only did everyone love it (and never guessed my secret ingredient!) but some said it was the best fudge they ever tasted! This is pretty fool-proof for even the most beginner cooks. I did microwave it for an extra minute to get it all melted though.

The flavor on this fudge is out of this world.  Super creamy and sweet.  My one problem with it is that mine turned out rather sticky and soft.  I'm not sure if it is because it wasn't chilled enough or what but I would like to figure out a way to make it a bit more substantial and less soft/sticky.

Despite the incredibly unusual addition of Velveeta it seems to be a hit among family and coworkers.

Very good, as it sits the cheesey taste comes back.  Since I live alone I am having to eat it all myself (I know its a great torture), but now its getting a little hard.

Amazing fudge!! Even better than the fudge recipe my mom makes!  Wow best recipe I have tried on this website yet...will definitely make again and again!  My fiance could never guess it had velveeta in it, and if I hadn't made it, I wouldn't have guessed either!

My mom has been making this fudge for YEARS and it's amazing! I've never made fudge any other way and I just won't. If it ain't broke, don't fix it is what they say. This recipe works for me!

This is amazing! I'd never guess it had Velveeta in it if I hadn't have made it!!! I added a little Amaretto, a few heaping spoonfuls of creamy peanut butter and two extra squares of Baker's chocolate (mostly bc I didn't know what to do with the last 2 pieces of the 8 piece box). Skipped the nuts, but that's just a personal preference. Mine was a little sticky/melty, but I blame Florida heat and humdity more then the recipe.  This one's a keeper for sure!!!!!!!!

this is awesome.  It is also very easy and versatile.  We put peanut butter and other ingredients in at mix stage for different flavors.  We have used different nuts, m&m's, white chocolate chips, etc.  Give this a try.

So I made this fudge after seeing it in a Paula Deen Cookbook. It sounded really weird but is tasted so GOOD! I've made Peanut Butter Fudge too by melted 1/2 cup of chunky P.B. into the cheese mixture and omitting the cocoa powder.

Very creamy.  I would only use 1/2 lb of the velveeta and incrase the chocolate to 8 oz.  Other than that it was good and I would make again!

This fudge was the favorite of everyone who tried it.  I had it at a Boy Scout fundraiser & thought the lady meant to call it Velvet fudge ... not!  This will appear on my candy tray for years to come.

This fudge is very good, though I had the same problem with it coming out somewhat sticky.  My husband could not beleive it had velveeta in it.
