I followed thie recipe exactly, but forgot to toss the bacon in before serving.  Even with that error, it was a 5 star at our table.  :)  It's like coleslaw, but doesn't taste heavy & saucy like coleslaw sometimes does - it's very light & flavorful.  I hand chopped/sliced everything to avoid the "shredded coleslaw from a bag" look & it was well worth it.  It was very pretty w/ the thicker cabbage slices, green bell pepper pieces, thin red onion slices, & matchstick carrot pieces!  I found the amounts called for in the recipe were spot on - the dressing is the right amount for a perfect light coating & after 5 hours in the fridge, it blended nicely without getting that soupy pool at the bottom of the bowl like other coleslaw recipes I've tried.  We really enjoyed it with our Sloppy Joes II sandwiches.  Thank you very much for sharing this!

I have been eating this stuff all day. It is so good! The only thing I would say is that I had to use more than 3 T mayo for a small head of cabbage. But anyway, I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks so much, Gail!

The only reason I made this is I had leftover cabbage from another meal.  It's pretty good and obviously easy to make.  I had everything but a green pepper on hand.  I did have a red one though.  I'll make it again.

I made this but as always I tweaked it a bit.  I used a red bell pepper to add a little more color. Used miracle whip instead of mayonaise (that's the southern way) and used a mixture of Bragg's apple cider vinegar and lime juice instead of the white vinegar.  Turned out fabulous!

Excellent cabbage salad, although I would describe it more like a cole slaw, but maybe that's a regional thing. The dressing was light and tasty, without being overbearing. The amount of dressing yielded by these measurements seemed awfully bare to me, so I doubled it, and still felt like I had just enough sauce to coat the ingredients. No complaints about the recipe itself, though, as this has turned out to be a tasty treat!
