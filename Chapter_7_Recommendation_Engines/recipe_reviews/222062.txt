I give it three stars because it is new, I liked the flavors and the idea is really good. But I think it needed more liquid to blend it, it was way to dry with only 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. I would do it again, with a mix of lemon juice and water (so its not too sour),  because it seems healthy. I also used both dark and milk chocolate.

Really tasty!  The chia seed seeds and fruit give it a different texture than regular fudge.  I used 1/4 cup of dried cherries and 1/2 cup raisins, it reminded me of a chocolate covered cherry!
