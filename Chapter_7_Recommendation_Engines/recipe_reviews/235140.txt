So...  I rarely follow recipes.  By that I mean they are just generally inspirational, and I take it from there, but this recipe looked awesome, healthy, and it sounded really easy to make, so I followed it verbatim.  the only thing I couldn't accomplish was that i could't find the particular Genoa salami suggested.  I bought a quality Genoa Salami, but didn't have the exact item.   My result looked almost exactly like the recipe as pictured.
   My family said that this was "bland", and in fact I agree.  I think it needs some texture - other than the Salami, which really turned out to be dry (maybe it was because I had the wrong kind?).   The other problem was that the tomatoes really withered away too much...I thought it seemed soon, but in retrospect I am certain that I should have waited until just before adding the Spinach - maybe 60 seconds before tossing in the Spinach?  I love these ingredients (except the Salami...).  If I do it again, I will probably toss in some crumbled bacon for taste and texture.   I think this is a pretty healthy dish - fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, scallops, and Spinach... hard to beat.  It all came together really easily, but I need to toss in something for texture and spice.  Maybe other folks who are better cooks that I am will add some ideas.  I will check back in a few months and see if some folks have ideas.   thanks for posting tho!

This was super easy and turned out fantastic! Make sure you dry the scallops before searing. Great dish!

I was hesitant to try a recipe with so little reviews, but I am glad I did! It turned out very good. I did substitute white button mushrooms for the crimini and it was fine.

I thought this was delicious. I made some changes…. used bacon instead of salami and twice as much garlic…. I added the tomatoes, 1/2c fresh chopped basil and the spinach at the end cooking just until spinach wilted and topped scallops on top instead of tossing to retain their specific flavor. Yummy!!!

Amazing! Was skeptical with so little reviews but amazing. My husband who is an incredible chef loved this. I cooked the scallops in butter and garlic, then set aside. Sautéd the mushrooms, rest of garlic and prosciutto for 2 mins, then removed prosciutto. Added the wine and cooked mushrooms and garlic to reduce for 10-15 mins and. Then added spinach and tomatoes (dried well) for another 3 minutes then added pasta, a lot of basil, and cooked for another 5 minutes on low. Amazing! Large portions so definitely half the receipe for 2 people.

Oh man this was SO GOOD! I added shallots with the prosciutto, didn't add spinach (didn't have it) and upped the garlic. Added about a half cup pasta water at the end to help thicken as well. Absolutely stellar! Came together quickly.... 10/10 will make again!

This was fantastic.  One change I made was to fry up the prosciutto  and then saute the scallops in the prosciutto oil to add flavor.

I made a half batch, following the recipe more or less as written cut by half, including weighing the ingredients, with the following exceptions: 1) I sauteed some shallots in the oil after I took the scallops out 3) I just guessed at the amount of pasta needed, and had a little too much I think -- no big deal though 3) I had cilantro on hand, so I used that as the garnish instead of fresh basil  4) I added some shaved parmesan cheese after serving at my wife's suggestion.
Also, I don't think it matters, but I used whole wheat pasta for health reasons.
A word of caution: the prosciutto and scallops have a natural load of salt, so don't add any more salt until they're all in the mix and you've tasted it. I say this as one who has to watch sodium intake -- I'm sure there are others like me among the readers. 
All in all it was a really good dish. My wife (#1 customer) rated it five stars, so that's my rating :).

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I make it with shrimp and I always use bacon.  Don't skimp on the garlic, wine or butter.  The only thing i add is pasta water to keep the sauce from drying out.  I will definately try the scallops next time they are on sale.

This was a hit with the SO.  It's an interesting mix of flavors, all things we like, and I didn't think that it would work, but it did. Just be careful about the salt content.  With the prosciutto, no more needs to be added.

I made this for my family today.  Everyone loved it.  I would definitely make it again.  I chose to stick with the prosciutto, but I did follow the suggestions to add the tomatoes later, right before adding the spinach.  I also added the basil directly into the sauce just before serving.  I found it added more flavour or this way, instead of just using it as a garnish.  Watch out for the prosciutto.  It's very salty, so adjust your seasoning accordingly.  One last note:  the portion size must be enormous! I halved the recipe, fed my family of four, and we still had lots of leftovers.
