I altered the recipe so much, I may as well create my own recipe to upload. But I used this as a basis to create my own lentil burgers, because I wanted to have a cheap, healthy lunch on hand and also because I am trying to eat less meat. I added chopped garlic to mine, and some various spices I had on hand (adobo seasoning, garlic salt, even a sprinkling of poultry seasoning, I was just afraid of bland tasteless beans so I threw in a lot). I also did not add the shredded mozzarella cheese because I wanted to top my burgers with a slice of cheddar (or something more flavorful than mozz) instead. I did not process the beans, instead I put them all in a dishrag and squeezed all the water out, which really helps prevent mushy burgers. And lastly, I did not dredge mine in cornmeal, I just pan-fried in olive oil instead to create a nice crunch, you can see in my picture the great crust I ended up with. Oh one more thing, I made up a bunch of patties, laid them on a cookie sheet and put them in the freezer. One frozen, I put them all in a ziploc bag, and now I have my own veggie burgers on hand!

I have actually been making this for years adapted from the exact same recipe! Its awesome!!! However, I do make it with a few changed sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, plain panko breadcrumbs, jalapeno pepper instead of bell and I do not use cornmeal (though I will try the cornmeal next time) I also add about a tsp (or so) of Sambal Oelek (we like things spicy). I also serve with spicy mayo made with Sambal Oelek mixed with light miracle whip. Awesome that you added this recipe!!!!

Tried to follow to the letter, but I didn't have bell pepper, so substituted some sautéed mushrooms and carrots; also sautéed the onions. Probably should have squeezed out the lentils and veggies, because I wound up having to add a lot of breadcrumbs to get the patties to hold together. But once I did that, they cooked up beautifully! This is such a versatile and forgiving recipe - I will be playing with different seasonings and veg in the future.

Better than expected although I might as well have made a new recipe. I didn't know how many lentils to use for 2.5 cups cooked, so I used way too much and doubled the recipe.  I accidentally added the oil and cornmeal to the 'burger' mix, and I ended up baking them instead of frying. 400 degrees for 20 minutes, flipped half way through.  Pretty darn tasty still, I was surprised.

Really drain the lentils. I added garlic and a bunch of seasonings to it as well. Very delicious. My Aunt's bf asked what kind of meat was in it!

These were great!!! We loved the flavors. I added some mushrooms and used planko breadcrumbs to avoid dairy. We will make them again. I did allow the beans to drain for awhile and put them in the fridge for the next day. So mine were very "dry" for making the burger. We will make these again. Even my 6 year old ate them up. Thanks!

Looked simple but turned out some gross-looking lentil mush. I'm giving it two stars rather than one because some of this was operator error. For starters, there is nothing in the recipe that indicates what consistency your cooked lentils should be, what kind of lentils to use, or how many cups of dry lentils make 2.5 cups cooked. I had to google it. I then proceeded to make red lentils like I usually do for curries and such and wound up with too-soupy lentils. I figured the bread crumbs would thicken it up, but even adding 3x the recommended amount didn't save it. At no point could I shape patties. Putting them in the pan on medium heat for five minutes burned them. They fell to pieces when flipped. The taste wasn't awful - bland but not bad. Aesthetically they looked like literal puke - a yellow-ish mush with chunks of pepper and onion in it. Recipe could easily be improved with some more specifics on how to cook the key ingredient. Not sure what the accompanying photo is of but that is not even remotely what my end product looked like.

I was concerned about the cornmeal, but it was a good idea as it added texture and crispness to the patty. As others have mentioned, I altered my take on the recipe and added curry powder, shredded kale & carrot and ground water chestnuts. Oh, and I used pepperjack instead of mozzarella.

Really good - we've tried these grilled, fried and baked, and definitely prefer grilled. I skip the cornmeal, and do freeze the leftovers for a quick lunch later! Will skip the peppers next time, and add more garlic and maybe some new sauce. Overall, very convincing and satisfying burger.

This was a great starter recipe. I had to add more egg to get the patty to hold together and seasoned like crazy.  I didn't even know where to start and this recipe definitely got me going in the right direction.

The parties fall apart as you're trying to cook them in the oil. When trying to flip them they completely fall to pieces. The recipe must be missing something that would hold the burgers together better. Was hoping for a good recipe but ended up ruining dinner.

I added mashed pink beans. Used egg substitute. Came out good. I found that letting it sit in the fridge for a while will let it firm a little.

This is a nice base and I'll definitely be playing with it more in the future to find what I like. I followed the recipe except for substituting shredded carrots for the green pepper and leaving out the cheese. I definitely should have followed advice to squeeze liquid out of the lentils/carrots, I couldn't get patties to hold together. I found the flavor to be too bland for my taste so I'll have to experiment with seasonings too.

I changed this a bunch! I even baked mine instead of frying them on the stove top. Also, I used yellow lentils ( Chana dal). Used rits crackers as binder too.

I also changed the recipe a bit, didn't have any peppers so added some mushrooms, and cannot eat bread so I left it out. I also oven cooked them to be a little healthier. It worked out fine, but wasn't very stable when I flipped it to make it crispy. Overall very impressed as this was my first time eating lentils, will have to get used to the taste but will probably make again.

I made it all in the food processor which was simple and easy. However, due to an extremely fussy eater in our household, I had to process it until smooth. I also had to add well over an extra cup of rice crumbs (substituted for bread crumbs) because it was very soft. As a result of the over processing, it was grainy and soft. The taste was a little bland but it was definitely easy!

Very tasty. The patties were a bit dry though.
