Excellent side dish. One question, why did I preheat my oven to 200*?

The preheated oven should be used during step 6...keeping the lobster meat warm until you are ready to fold it into the potatoes.

This isn't so much of a review than it is a thank you to Mauigirl for giving me a new way to make potatoes! I couldn't follow the lobster part of the recipe because I used frozen chopped lobster tails. I did, however, use the russet potatoes, instead of my usual red, and cooked according to recipe. Then I just sauteed the tails in butter and garlic powder and stirred them into the potatoes. Anyways, I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I didn't follow it completely. But I think it would definitely be worth that extra star!

The best mashed potatoes Iâ€™ve ever had!  I made these for thanksgiving and everyone took them home before anything else.  I even tried it with imitation crab meat and it was awesome!!
