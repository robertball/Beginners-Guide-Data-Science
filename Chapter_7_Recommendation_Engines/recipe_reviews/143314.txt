Very good and refreshing! I used seltzer water instead of club soda because I already had some. Next time I will use a little less lime and a lot more ice. Thanks!

I liked this as a great base. I used fresh mango and 1/4c mango juice because I only had about 1/2C of orange juice. I did cut the lime by half but I crushed the lime and sugar together at the bottom of the glass sort of like a mojito but used lime instead of mint. Instead of club soda I used diet ginger ale. I also added a little Brazilian rum and 1/2 oz of simple sugar. It was a big hit! Thanks for the base recipe.

great idea for a hot day. As I had no orange juice in the fridge I used: one mango, a lot of ice, juice from half a lemon and lemon flavored water. I love the combination of lemon & mango!

Very limey.  My mango tastes a little odd, but I guess that's bc I bought some jarred mango in syrup--what you buy in the refrigerated produce section--and have never had it before.  fresh mango is definitely better.  But it worked to try it.  I agree with Sunny--the lime is very strong, so I'd cut that down.  I actually didn't use any ice bc I only have my food processor and I've been told not to use ice in it.  I suppose I'll have to get a blender one of these days and try it again.  It was good even without the ice.  thanks for the recipe!

Nice and fresh beverage. The lime is a bit strong, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to cut it down some (perhaps by using a bit more orange juice in its place).

Definitely one to repeat for sunny and cloudy days alike. :o)

I made this exactly as written, except I added a few more pieces of ice.  The lime was very overpowering. It tasted like a really sour orange juice drink with really no mango flavor, or any enjoyable flavor at all. None of us liked it at all.

I'm sorry I just don't think this is a good recipe. Imho, mango cannot be distinctive when put up against the strong flavor of orange. To me, this tastes almost like plain orange juice, if you were to buy a brand that has added sugar (like Donald Duck brand, which I used to love as a kid lol). I did reduce the lime by half, so the lime was not overpowering. However, the mango flavor still didn't come through. I tasted my mango before I pureed, so I know I had a good one with flavor! This recipe is too much effort for what amounts to sweetened orange juice. I have one mango left; gonna try a smoothie instead. After I tasted the finished recipe I added more ice, thinking that would help. It didn't, but I decided to freeze the whole thing so I'll have a kind of granita or gelato or whatever it's called. Not a total waste, but I definitely won't make it again.
