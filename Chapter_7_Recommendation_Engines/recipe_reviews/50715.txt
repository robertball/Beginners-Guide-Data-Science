A St Louis favorite!  This is well worth trying.  If you don't have the browning sauce but have a hearty beef broth you'll be fine.

Very, very good. This is a much heartier French onion soup than my previous recipe, which I seem to have misplaced. This and a salad actually filled my husband.

I found the salt level to be pleasant, but my husband felt it was a little too salty. I used buillon cubes, so I'm sure that contributed to the saltiness. I added a few extra cubes to ensure the soup wasn't too weak, and in hindsight, I don't think that was necessary.

I used Merlot instead of a white wine because that is what I had handy... also, I added a splash of balsamic vinegar towards the end of cooking.

I toasted the french bread slices before broiling and mixed in a little romano and fresh mozarella with the swiss.

All in all, very good. Our 11 year old asked for more soup instead of pizza.

Don't be afraid to cook the onions for longer than stated. I made mine a nice golden brown - carmelized almost. I think that adds so much to the taste.

I have been making this soup for the past 20 years and there is no other like it!  The addition of the paprika adds a richness both in color and in taste and I often find myself adding more than the recipe calls for. My kids and relatives all make it for their families now.

Delicous and always hits the spot!  If you have homemade beef stock use it, otherwise use 1/2 canned chicken broth and 1/2 canned beef broth.  Canned beef broth can get too tinny tasty when reduced.  I always add a pinch of salt to the onions, it makes them release their juices, hence their flavor, to the soup when browning them.

Rob, there's no doubt that this is an excellent FOS recipe. I used low sodium beef broth, red wine (didn't have white) and added a few more seasonings. The recipe called for paprika, but I didn't see in the instructions whether to add it to the soup, or if was meant to be a sprinkling over the cheese. Anyway, I did both and it was great. I always add some sugar to my onions as they're browning, which cuts down a little on the cooking time. Hubby's the FOS King and he and my family just loved it. Thanks so much!

THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I grew up with Famous Barr and I'm 59 years old!  Their French Onion soup was a "must" for lunchtime shoppers and this IS IT!!! I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't disappointed.  VERY GOOD and rich in flavor.

This was so much better than most of the onion soups I've ever had out!! Wow!! I made a huge batch of this (6x? can't remember now) for a church "SoUUper Sunday", and it was a huge hit. Every last drop was eaten, and I couldn't keep my spoon out of the pot when I was making it. I was worried that the directions weren't right about cooking the onions so long, but the whole recipe really turned out perfect. My mouth is watering now remembering it. Too bad my husband's not a fan of this type of soup or this would be made much more often at home!

Just made this today, and it's a great recipe! We just moved in, so we didn't have wine or a bay leaf (had to borrow the flour!), but it's a easy, hardy soup to make for a cold rainy day. Now if only we could unpack the food processor to make slicing those onions easier...

I really tried to like this recipe but there is way too much paprika and the directions need to be clearer. I thought something was wrong noting to cook the onions 1.5 hours but it is right and needs to say this is needed so that the onions carmalize. I had a problem when the dry ingredients were added and needed to cook 10 minutes. If I cooked the dry ingredients for 10 minutes they would have burnt. I also only could let the soup simmer on very low for 1.5 hours, any more and I would not have had enough liquid left for it to be soup. The broth in this recipe was somewhat heavy and almost too rich from simmering so long. Sorry :(

It's true, you do need to cook the onions for at least an hour. I used mozzarella instead of swiss, also skipped the browning sauce.  It's great with the white wine (don't skip that!).

Oh how wonderful!  I have always used a very complicated onion soup recipe in the past that required two days to make.  This was oh-so-good and so much easier.  None of my three young children cared for it - but what do they know.  Thank you for posting this sublime recipe.

This soup was AMAZING!  I did have to add a bit of sugar to my onions and cooked them for over 2 hours but it was well worth it!  This recipe makes A LOT of soup :)

This was SO good! I only wish I had made twice as much - we liked it that much. Now, every time we have a snow storm, I start a batch of French Onion Soup to cook while I shovel, stirring it when I come in for a break. By the time the driveway is cleared, I have a great lunch ready, leftovers to go in the freezer.

This was outstanding!  I didn't have white wine, so I substituted a Chianti, and I think the wine is essential to the success of the recipe.  I also used a blend of swiss, mozerella and parmesan cheese.  I counted on leftovers for lunch tomorrow, but even my son who doesn't usually eat onions loved this, so there isn't any left!

I made this for 40 vegan servings. That translated to 17lbs of yellow onions to caramelize. It took quite a while, but I'm happy I took the time to get them nice and brown as it really made the taste. With that big of an adjustment to the sizing, I reduced the paprika from over 1/3 cup to a few tablespoons and think that was wise in the end. With the onions caramelized so well, I didn't require a browning sauce. It tasted so good that I was honestly scared to toss some balsamic vinegar in there or something and to wind up ruining 10 quarts of good soup. I used a good quality veggie bouillon to make the broth. It got tons of compliments from children and adults, most of whom were not vegans or vegetarians, and several of them said they liked the soup but didn't even like onions! Thanks!!

I have always loved this recipe. I got it out of the paper a long time ago. My recipe is a little different though. It does not have paprika and it calls for 3/4 cup of flour. It also says to make it one day and let it sit in the fridge overnight and heat it the next day.  The last time I made it, I was hungry so I had some after simmering for about an hour. Don't do that! It was really missing something. I had another bowl the next day for lunch after letting it finish cooking. It was great as usual.

The excellent flavor of this soup is very similar to the wildly popular "French Onion Soup Gratinee" - but that one is a little better. If you do make this, add 1 tsp. of sugar to the sauteing onions to speed up cooking time.

Calls for WAY too much paprika, and probably a bit too much black pepper.  And, listen: my family cooks and eats lots of peppery foods (Cajun, Indian) and I'm Hungarian and I love paprika.  But this is not the flavor profile you are going for in French onion soup.  I only put in half (1 tablespoon of) the paprika, and it was still too much.  If you want to try this recipe, I recommend: try 1.5 *teaspoons* of paprika, *1* teaspoon white pepper (replacing the black pepper).  Let it simmer, then taste; you can always add more -- but you can't take it out!

No, No and No! This soup was a project, hours and hours in the making. The finished product does not have the full body beefy onion flavor. Instead the soup is has a dark reddish hue and has a tangy taste because of all the paprika. I was quite disappointed and wondered why I trusted the recipe with so much paprika. For those of you who rated so positively, you must not know the true taste of a good French onion soup!

The key is to get a good swiss style cheese to melt on top (go for the pricey stuff; it's worth it).  I personally don't like the bay leaf flavor in this so I leave it out.  I have used both beef broth and veggie broth and had great results both times.  Definitely take the time to cook the onions as the recipe indicates to maximize flavor.

This is the BEST onion soup I have ever eaten! I use Wondra (R) flour instead of AP to ensure a nice silky consistancy. Also, I toast my bread and rub it with fresh garlic for an extra layer of deliciousness, (not that this soup needs it). It may seem like a process, and though it is time consuming, it is DEFINATELY worth it~ a keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've never had French Onion Soup. My cousin always has to order it.  I decided to try it and used this recipe.  I thought it was delicious, my cousin said I could make more, (I only made 4 servings, just in case I didn't like it)  I will definately make this again and again.

EXCELLENT. I ONLY HAD UNSALTED BUTTER, SO I HAD TO ADD SALT AT THE END. I USED SOME SWISS, ROMANO & MOZZARELLA. (NEVER HEARD OF SWISS CHEESE IN FR ONION....) I BROILED 2 THIN SLICES OF FRENCH BREAD.  YOU DO HAVE TO COOK THOSE ONIONS FOR AT LEAST AN HR.  AND NEAR THAT HOUR, KEEP WATCHING AS THEY WILL BURN.  MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS SOUP, AND SO DID I. ONE MISTAKE, YOU DIDN'T SAY WHAT TO DO W/THE PAPRIKA. I ADDED IT WITH THE BAY LEAF, ETC..  PERFECT

I have never made French Onion soup before, so I'm no expert, but I followed the cooking times and measurements exactly.  The onions were not cooked enough and the soup tasted WAY too onion-y.  Also, I served this at a family get together and needed 12 servings; this recipe makes more like 24+.  No one needs that much French Onion soup...no one!

Takes some time, but definitely worth the outcome!  I used 2 lbs red onions and 3 lbs yellow, and 2 quarts of beef broth and 1 quart of chicken broth....tasted great!   Terrific winter meal w/ a salad!  Thanks for sharing!

This was so very east to make and had a great flavor.  The recipe I used to use took a full day to make, and was not as flavorful as this one !  It really made a splash at our holiday meal.

I've been making this for 40 years. It's the best and I always compare it to any other FOS that I sample. These days, I make the beef version and a chicken version. It's pure perfection any time

My son & I try every onion soup available (east coast to Honolulu and other islands across Hawaii ) when traveling.  This recipe is among the best we've tried.  Added bonus so easy to make.  I use gruyere cheese instead only because we like it.  One tip -- be patient, cook and simmer for at least the time recommended.  Yummy !!!!!

This was very good.  My husband and I both liked it a lot.  I added cayenne pepper to the soup and it gave it a little heat.  I will make this again.  I used too much browning sauce.  Be careful.  Also, I left the lid off the entire time, so there wasn't much broth left.

a bit salty - probably has more to do with my beef base than the recipe. very good.  only cooked onions 1 hour, but then I'm not sure that I had a full 5 pounds to begin with.  Will definitely make again, but probably will look for a lower sodium beef base first (or not - it's really good!)

Superb!  Only little tweak I added was to put a very light spreading of dijon mustard on the french bread before I topped with the swiss cheese. Also added a dash of worcestershire as noted by previous reviewer (reduced salt accordingly). I also suspect that if you were out of white wine a few glugs of good sherry would work as well.  You would NOT want to substitute red wine in this soup.  Paired w/additional french bread and a bottle of Syrah.  Lovely!  The secret is giving the onions the full cooking time - this is an "all day" cooking soup but you'll love the results.

This was the best onion soup I have ever tasted - in restaurants, or homemade! Followed the measurements exactly - wouldn't change a thing. My only regret is that I only made a half of the recipe.

This was a great recipe, but I found it lacking something.  Then I put about 2 tbsp of worchester sauce in the soup and it was perfect!

Obviously this takes a long time to prepare and cook but it is worth it.  Only change I made was when it called for one cup of wine I changed it to another l/2 cup of beef broth and 1/2 cup of sherry.  Also added a little thyme.  Thanks submitter.

FANTABULOUS!! JUST LIKE Famous Barr’s! I agree with those who said 2 TBSP is TOO MUCH PAPRIKA....& though I’ve made this a buncha times, I’d forgotten that little tidbit when I made it yesterday!  I just love this soup! Although YES, it’s quite labor intensive, it’s WELL WORTH IT!!

As a teenager I lived 10 minutes away from Famous Barr. I would go there just for the soup and even eat by myself if I couldn't get anyone to go with me, that's huge for a teenager lol! This recipe I have does call for it to sit in frige overnight and mine uses 3/4 cup flour. They used to serve it with a big hunk of fresh french bread and butter. I also use a mandolin for the onion slicing. I whisk the wine, paprika, and flour all together till smooth and then add it to the onions. I've never used the browning agent. It does freeze great. I wonder if some of the folks complained about it being too salty if they had condensed broth  that should have been diluted.

I only used half  beef broth and half water with beef boullion. Next time I will only use 1 Tbsp of paprika and skip the bay leaf. Did not have wine, but I think that would have improved it.

Making this soup is my favorite snowy day activity--and it is an ALL DAY activity. The results are so worth the effort.  I use Mayan onions (honey sweets) and Sweet Vermouth instead of white wine. This is s great complement to a good steak and potato meal on a cold winter's day.

This was the best French onion soup I've made yet! An excellent quality wine (I used Santa Margarita Pinot Grigio) and Pacific Organic beef broth (without MSG) made this soup outstanding. I made a half batch (6 servings) for our family of 5 and we had plenty. I followed the recipe exactly (maybe not adding all the paprika) except for the browning sauce. I have never heard of it, but will look into it. My soup didn't miss it!

Made this a few years ago and was looking for an Onion Soup recipe again recently. When I tasted it, I wasn't sure it took me 2 years to make it again. I was out of the browning sauce, but put a dash of worstershire instead. So good. I love what the paprika does for it.
