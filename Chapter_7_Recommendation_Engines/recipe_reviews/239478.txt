My husband and I love the way it tastes  and the smoothness of this syrup. I made it per recipe, terrific as is.  Will use this for rice pudding & bread pudding and maybe add brandy, rum, kaluha or ?. Recipe is a real winner!

This is a great recipe. I've made it several times with various adaptations. I've used coconut oil in place if butter, used some brown sugar, even added raspberries once (turned it a metallic silvery-gray color).

OMG this syrup is so good it's unbelievable. I have never liked buttermilk unless it was cooked in something so I wasn't sure how I'd like it but I knew hubby would like it. You can bet I'll be making this recipe again and again. I doubled this recipe so we'd have some for breakfast tomorrow too (So glad I did).  I paired this syrup with the buttermilk pancake's II recipe also on this site and they were a match made in heaven. Thanks for posting this delicious homemade pancake syrup. You can bet this one is going in my favorite recipe file.

I've made this several times, and it has turned out great every time! I do think it's easier if I melt the butter before I add the sugar and buttermilk. I also never have buttermilk so instead I use regular milk with a small splash of vinegar in it which makes a perfect substitute.

we love this recipe with our german pancake.  If you let it cook a bit more it will get slightly dark and turn to caramel sauce also.  Left over sauce I use in my coffee in the morning to make caramel lattes.  You can use it on ice creme or anything you wish.  I love both version the light and the dark caramel one.  Any recipe needing a caramel sauce this is, what I use now, it's fast and easy.  Oh and when they say it will foam up, it is no joke...use a big sauce pan because it is fast and it will overflow a smaller pan.

I love this recipe! It turns out like caramel sauce. You can use it like syrup or as an Icecream topping. It's ideal because it has so few ingredients! I highly recommend doing a SLOW warm up on the sugar, butter and buttermilk. If you go too fast it can turn out grainy. I melt my butter first then add the buttermilk and sugar. Make sure the sugar has fully dissolved before adding the vanilla and baking soda. I'm so glad I found out this recipe!

I first tasted buttermilk syrup when a friend made it. Her recipe is almost identical but it calls for corn syrup and this does not, so I tried it out. AMAZING! Love this! I usually make it when I'm making buttermilk pancakes to use up some more of the buttermilk ... and because it is easy and delicious! Thanks for sharing.

Four of my grandkids were here for the night and wanted pancakes. I didn't have any syrup so tried this. I didn't have buttermilk but I made it with milk and vinegar.  No problem. I made it just like it is and WOW!!  My grandkids were in heaven. LOL  They LOVED it.  They said it made their pancakes taste like a pastry! Next time I make cinnamon rolls, this is going on top!  Excellent syrup.  I made a memory with my grandkids today that I bet they won't forget! Thank you!!!

I have made a similar, but larger recipe for years, but I decided to try this one, as it yielded a smaller amount than my usual. I'm not sure what I did wrong, if anything...but what I wound up with were caramels. So, I put it back on the heat, and added extra buttermilk, and put the baking soda in at this point. I wound up with something similar to what I was looking for, and it tastes OK, but I'll go back to  my original recipe from now on.

I had extra buttermilk left over after Thanksgiving and was craving pancakes. I remembered that I didn't have any maple syrup and lo and behold, Grandma's to the rescue! I paired this syrup with "Mom's Buttermilk Pancakes" and I instantly fell in love. I'm not a good cook (I do make awesome dinners) but this made me feel as if  I can create anything! Thank you for sharing Katie!

This is my favorite homemade syrup. I always use coconut extract instead of vanilla, which makes it AMAZING. I've also tried Mexican Vanilla instead, which gives it some depth and richness.

I love this recipe.  I also add 2 tbls of karo syrup.  Yum!  I don't like maple syrup so I make this one or cinnamon syrup for my family.  It's great on pancakes, waffles or french toast.

We had some family friends that used to gift  buttermilk syrup every year at Christmas. When they moved away, we thought we'd never get it again. Thanks to this recipe now we can share buttermilk syrup at Christmas. Delicious!

This was amazing! I had never had buttermilk syrup (or heard of it!) til we went to Washington state on vacation.  I am so glad I found this recipe! I halved it because it was for just my husband and I.

I really like this syrup. It's buttery and creamy. I'm using it over an overnight baked french toast. I can't wait for everyone to try it.

I made this tonight to go on my scratch buttermilk pancakes and it wax absolutely amazing!!! I don't think I'll go back to Maple syrup again. This is definitely a winning recipe. I made it exactly as it's written and it turned out perfect

01-04-16 ~ Super simple syrup.  I made this syrup to drizzle over 'Auntie's Buttermilk Cake' from AR.  The flavor is good and it worked nicely on the cake.  You do need to reheat for each use as the butter causes the syrup to firm up.  This is a nice change for waffles rather than regular maple syrup.

This was so good!  I added pecans because my husband wanted pecan syrup.  It would be great on ice cream too. Thanks for this recipe, cellocrazy32! I wish I had taken a photo to post

I didn't have any of our usual Mrs. Butterworth's when I decided to make pancakes for dinner tonight. I found this recipe and give it a try - We will never buy syrup again!!! This is so good! I was nervous giving it to my 7-year old because it wasn't what she was used to, but she asked me to "always" make this syrup when we have pancakes. I imagine it is amazing on French Toast, too. Fantastic!
