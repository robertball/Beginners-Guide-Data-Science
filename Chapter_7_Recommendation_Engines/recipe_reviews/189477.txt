not bad, but traditional sushi rice should have a bit of salt in it. the correct method is to add about 1 tsp salt per three cups of rice, you dissolve the salt with the sugar in the vinegar, so for one cup rice, it would be about 1/3 tsp salt. otherwise, this would be perfect.

Way too much mayonnaise ratio to finely chopped crabmeat.  It drowned out the crabmeat taste.  Instead of 1/4 cup mayo, I'd put 1-1.5 tbsp for 1/2 a cup of crabmeat.

The first time I make these, they came out rather large but everyone loved them.  I took the recommendation and used less mayo.  Then I added alittle siracha hot sauce to the mayo to make them Spicy California rolls.  Very tasty!!!!!!!

This is a very good basic recipe. I make my sushi a little bit differently, though. First, I do not use any mayo with my crab - I like the flavour on its own. Also, I like to lay slices of cucumber alongside the crab and avacado - makes for a bit of a crunch. Yum!

I agree with a previous review, this is a great recipe for the beginner cook. I also took the advice of others & added salt to the vinegar. I also used real crab meat with a dash of sesame oil and chopped water chestnuts to give crunch, I added mayo to taste. Cooking is about creativity and doing what u like & enjoying what u create. Release the inner chef and go with it. Thank you for those who have shared!

I also added 1 tsp of salt to the vinegar. Fish roe adds not only flavor but color. Just used enough mayo to hold the crabmeat together so it wonÂ´t overpower the other ingredients. Removed the seeds from the cucumber and be generous with the sesame seeds.

Just like the "real thing"! I made the first batch inside out (nori on the outside) because I forgot to flip them, but honestly, it tastes the same regardless, and it's much easier to make them inside out, so that's how I'll make them from now on. I also shaved the cukes with a veggie peeler, which gave me thin, long strands. It's faster and easier than cutting those tiny spears, and all you need to do is put a few strips on each roll; the length is just right. And finally, I used the recipe on the package of sushi rice, which has different concentrations of vinegar/sugar and also uses salt. I'll be making this often!

This recipe was easier than I expected, but requires changes for it to work (at least for me). As prepared, this recipe only made 4 rolls, and the rice was spread too thinly even then. The rice seasoning also had way too much vinegar for my liking.

So here's what I recommend for a recipe that makes 6 rolls using 

2 cups rice (this requires spreading the rice quite thinly, so take your time)

Rice flavoring (goes into the rice after it's cooked, as described in the recipe):
1/4 cup (4 tbsp) rice vinegar
1/4 cup (4 tbsp) water
2 tbsp white sugar
1 tsp salt

Filling:
- 3/8 cup (6 tbsp) imitation crab meat
- 2 small avocados
- 1 small cucumber
- Mayonnaise is optional. I left it out and the rolls tasted very good nonetheless.

Once the rice is ready (cooked, combined with the vinegar mixture, and cooled), split it into 6 equal portions and spread each portion as evenly as you can onto the nori. Split the filling into 6 equal portions as well, prior to adding individual portions to each roll.

Otherwise, follow the original recipe.

And don't forget to get some Japanese soy sauce, fresh or pickled ginger, and wasabi or horseradish if you like to have something salty and spicy to dip your rolls into!

Sushi doesn't have mayonnaise. You could also substitute another vegetable instead of avocado and only use one; two is a bit much.

Good base recipe for people who want to try making sushi for the first time. Although, the rice is better with Mirin instead of sugar in my opinion, and no mayonnaise, to me it just doesn't belong. And instead of two slices of avocado I would add a slice of folded egg omelette, shitake mushroom, or cucumber. overall good recipe though. And it's nice to finally see someone mentioning the way the rice should be prepared, rinsing and all!

Made this for dinner tonight. Was pretty good with a few modifications.  I'm not a huge fan of the raw seaweed so I substituted a mixture of flower eggs milk and butter blended together for the seaweed and rice.   Couldn't find my soy sauce but luckily I had some tomato paste that believe it or not  was a great stand in.    The crab wasn't really my style so I used some ham and ice always loved fruit so I used some pine apple.   

Now I was feeling a little creative so I added some cheese over the whole thing and instead of rolling it just left it flat.  Normally I would be totally fine eating it raw but last week I got food poisening so I decided to cook it.  I know the traditional method is to fry it but I baked it for my health.  

5 stars.  Best sushi ever.

Thank you for the easy to follow instructions. My CA rolls look very pretty. After learning how to make this, I don't think I would want to buy CA rolls from restaurants anymore. The ingredients are so simple and easy to prepare. Most of the time is spent cooking the rice and cutting.

This was my very first time making sushi and I felt that they came out pretty well.  I found that there was not nearly enough rice for the amount of nori sheets stated in the recipe (maybe I laid it on a little too heavy).  I ended up making only half (4 rolls).  I also found that the crameat filling amount was not adequate.  I used whipped cream cheese & a little mayo for the surimi mixture & added some hot sauce to spice it up.  All and all, a fair effort with decent results.  The recipe was easy to follow and I'm sure I'll become more adept with practice.

These were really good and very filling.  I cut my recipe down to only make 2 servings since I would be the only one eating them.  Did taste like too much mayo.  I even added a bit more crab to mine bc I could see the mayo was overpowering.  I've never rolled sushi before so my rolls were kinda thick but that didn't mess with the overall taste.  I will make these again!

My kids and I enjoyed this but for some reason the flavoring of the rice bothered me a little.  I think it's because I could taste the rice over everything else. Otherwise a good, simple and enjoyable treat.

Very tasty. I cut down on the amount of mayo (about 2-3 TBSP) and also cut the rice vinegar down by 1/3. I didn't flip it, as suggested, just rolled it normally. The ride wash seemed to help with the bag rice I used. I will make this again!

Rice: Add a teaspoon of salt and drop the vinegar to 2 tablespoons and the sugar to 0.5 tablespoons.  The keeps the sweet/sour balance the same but gives the rice a more delicate flavor which is supported by the salt.

Crab: Unless you really like mayo use just enough mayo to make the crab hold together.  1-1.5 tablespoons.

I have zero experience in cooking and I made sushi following these clear instructions. To my surprise, my kids loved these experimental sushi and asked for more.
In my opinion, here is one problem with this recipe.
The amount of rice and water is wrong - it should be doubled.
Although, the proportion of rice to water is correct.
1/4 cup rice should be for 1 roll. 1 cup for 4 rolls.

The exact taste of a sushi restaurant is there. Very difficult to roll without a bamboo roller, so the form wasn't quite right.

Not bad. Wonât use mayo next time. And Iâd use 1 thick cucumber strip rather than a few thin.

I would have given it a 5 but it was my first time and I'm sure I can do better.

It was okay. I put too much mayo in it and used the wrong kind of crab meat.

Pretty good! I feel like the measurements are off, because with 1 cup of rice, I was only able to make 4 sushi rolls, not 8, as the instructions said. Apart from that, it's amazing!

I think this is decent sushi for the simplicity of the recipe. I did alter the fat content by replacing the 1/4 cup of mayo for 2 TBSP of light mayo...big difference if you are trying to lose weight! :) Also, if you don't have a bamboo mat like me you can use a clean heavy towel that is folded into a square with some plastic wrap to roll it up (there are videos on youtube and articles on how to do this). Overall good recipe! I'm going to try it next time with cream cheeese. :)

We found that 1/4 c rice vinegar was too much. We followed the sushi rice directions using 2 tbs instead. Very easy and tasted fantastic!

Pretty good, but definitely too much mayo. A good, classic California roll, super refreshing and filling.

We gobbled this up before I could even finish rolling them. They  may not be fancy but they are quite delicious.
