Like the previous reviewer, I was also looking for a chewy cookie. Changes I made: 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of brown sugar instead of the aspartame, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 1 cup bread flour instead of 2 cups all-purpose flour, cut down the baking powder to 1 tsp, the baking soda to 1/2 tsp, and the milk to 1/2 cup. Oh, and I added some walnuts and chocolate chips.   Even with all those changes, the bars still had a cakey texture. Didn't taste like banana bread though!

I followed the directions precisely, except replacing the aspartame w/ 1 Tbsp brown sugar.  Very yummy!  My three-year-old loves it.  It does taste a lot like banana bread, but that's fine with me because I really like banana bread :)

Not a bad recipe, but was extremely similar to what I'd call banana bread.  I was expecting more of a bar cookie texture.  However, number of eggs needed was left off, so that may change the recipe.  I used two.

I thought this was a great recipe, nice and moist easy to make but I added a hint of salt and a few shakes of cinnamon to the dry ingredients

I made the following changes based on reviews by other bakers:  I doubled the recipe and made it in an 11 x 15 pan.  I replaced the artificial sweetener with 1/2 cup brown sugar. Instead of the 3/4 cup skim milk which, when doubling the recipe made it 1 1/2 cups, I used 3/4 cup 1 percent milk and 3/4 cup vegetable oil.  This made the bars less like cake  and more dense, like a bar cookie.  After frosting with cream cheese frosting, I felt it needed a little more bang, so I drizzled it with salted caramel sauce.  Everyone raved about them -- will definitely be making more!

Made almost exactly as recipe. Used 9 x 9 dish so I baked it 15 minutes longer for the depth. Beautiful! I've been looking for a good banana bread recipe for a long time. This one is a keeper! Moist, lightly browned on top, no need for icing. Just the right level of sweetness. Here's where I changed it up slightly. I used maple syrup instead of sweetener as I often do. I don't like artificial chemicals.
My sister and great-nephew loved it as a healthy snack.

This was one of the best banana recipes I ever made/ate.Everyone that had it agreed.I added one more banana then called for, I think it made it moister and topped with homemade icing with a pinch of cinnamon and honey in it!!

didn't know how many eggs I had to use. I put three. It tastes good but it may be better with something sweeter on top.

Pretty good, although I'd probably call it a banana cake or bars, but who cares what they are called if they taste good, right?  :o)  These are very moist, and dense, and not that different from banana bread in my opinion, but I've never had dry banana bread so maybe I'm in the minority here.    I topped with a vanilla glaze I had in the fridge, and bf liked them but thought that a strawberry frosting would be better with them.  I think some more spices, like cinnamon, would make the taste pop more too.  He preferred the chocolate cake I  made today, but well . . .it's chocolate, and he likes most things with chocolate better anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!

We're used to banana bread, this was a refreshing change.  Not as strongly flavored, softer and very good.

I used this recipe as a starting ground for a delicious banana cake/ Blondie. The things I changed were ;  I added chopped pecans to the mashed bananas as well as some shredded coconut,  about 1/3 c of each,  really to your preference. I also used fat-free half and half as that was all I had,  and I added about 1/3 c fat free sour cream. After pouring into the pan I sprinkled with some more chopped pecans. My husband and I can't stop eating this!!!

The blondies were very good! I changed a few things...I used 1 egg, substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for butter, added coconut and chocolate chips, and baked it on a cookie sheet instead of a 9 x 13 pan. They were a bit more "brownie-like" and everyone loved them!

So here's what I did...I started with 5 bananas.  (mostly just because I had 5 super ripe bananas) I used a 1/4 sweetened condensed milk.  Skipped the aspartame all together.  Mixed in mini chocolate chips.  And added a pinch of salt.  I don't know what it was, maybe the sweetened condensed milk...maybe the extra banana...they're more cookie bar style.  My short boy smashed two and had a hand on a third before I had to cut him off.

My son loves these.  Says they taste like a donut (but a lighter texture).  For those reviewers looking for a chewy cookie, this ain't it.  This is cake-like.  You may want to search for banana cookie recipes :)

I tried to follow the recipe exactly but it really seems more like banana bread than a brownie. It tasted fine but missed the texture of a brownie.

these were very yummy treats and I quite enjoyed baking them! they were super easy and I’d definitely make them again in the future. I did change one thing though. instead of using the aspartame, I substituted it with just a tablespoon of organic honey and it was super delicious!

Nice change of pace (and quicker to bake) than regular banana bread, but not quite the "blondie" texture I'd been hoping for.  Based on other reviews, I reduced the milk to 1/2-cup, baking powder to 1 tsp, and baking soda to 1/2-tsp. I also used 1/4-cup brown sugar in lieu of the aspartame.  For additional flavor, I sifted 1/2-tsp each of cinnamon and allspice into the dry ingredients as well as 1 cup semi-sweet morsels.  The result was tasty and extremely moist.  I plan to experiment more with the consistency.

I omitted the baking soda, and I added 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, and 2 tsp of baking powder instead of the 1.5 tsps. it called for. My Neighbor loved it!!

I made these as directed, but swapped out the aspartame for some brown sugar, as suggested by another reviewer.  I balked a bit at the amount of vanilla extract, but I'm glad I added the full amount, because it was perfect!  These came out very moist and mild, but definitely had a more cakelike texture than I had anticipated.  Tasty, regardless.  I'll probably top them with some whipped frosting to satisfy my husband's sweet tooth.

Good recipe, added 2 tsp honey to give it more taste. Also found only 25 minutes needed to bake, 35 will burn it.

These are quite tasty! They do turn out more like cake than blondies, though. But they taste great. I left out the aspartame but added a whole bag of white chocolate chips and dolloped peach preserves over the batter and swirled it before baking. Yum, yum!

The moistest banana bread  I've ever made!  Just add chopped walnuts and cream cheese icing and it'll be perfect!!!
