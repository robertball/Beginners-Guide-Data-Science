Made as written except that I only used half of the ramen noodles the recipe called for due to personal preference. There was already a lot of crunch going on and I didn't seen the need to add the extra calories. This was great! I'm not a huge fan of fruit in my salad but I loved it in this recipe. The browned butter really brought all of the flavors together. This one is a keeper!

recipe didnt specify what type of vinegar. I used apple cider vinegar. didnt like it with acv. may be a good base to start with.
