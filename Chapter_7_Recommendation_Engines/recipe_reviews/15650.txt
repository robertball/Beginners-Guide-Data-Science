I am Filipina, and the ingredients are similar to my adobo recipe that I cook on the stovetop. The only difference is that I do not use any onions. I add a generous tablespoon of peppercorn, and 2-3 bay leaves. I recommend using WHITE vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar because apple cider vinegar has an unpleasant smell when it is cooked. When I was growing up, I hated when my parents cooked adobo because they used apple cider vinegar, and I thought it was smelly lol. White vinegar has a more pleasant aroma.  I noticed that many reviewers added a lot of sugar. Adobo is not a sweet dish.At most, there should only be a hint of sweetness. The combination of vinegar, garlic, and soy sauce is what gives adobo its unique flavor.

My Filipino family has made this adobo for many years using 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1 cup water, and 2 bay leaves. A generous amount of granulated garlic or garlic powder can be used in place of fresh garlic. Serve over white rice. Delicious!

Advice to all who attempt this recipe-- chicken adobo is meant to taste "tangy".  I've read many of the reviews and it seems that the intended flavor of the recipe is a matter of taste.  Like your sauce thick or thin, this is a tangy dish.  Like it thin, then water it down; like it thick, then add corn starch; like it less tangy, add sugar; more tangy, add less sugar.  Smell while cooking is often pungent... normal for vinegar-based dishes.  But if "tangy" is your forte, then the "pickle" smell during cooking is a GOOD sign.  My advice on the dish- try this dish at a restaurant or elsewhere and decide if you like the general essence; if you like it, then try your hand at this dish, making modifications to personalize your tastes.  If you aren't hip with such exotic foreign dishes, then steer clear of making this foreign dish simply for the sake of trying something new and exotic.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I'm a this 'n that type of cook so I added about a 1/4-1/2 cup of brown sugar, two more cloves of garlic, about 3/4 cup of water, a good inch or so of fresh chopped ginger, and I used six whole legs (leg and thigh combo) with the skins peeled off.  I loved the sauce so much that I buttered a casserole dish, put in a cup of long-grain uncooked white rice(basmati) and put about five ladlefuls of juice(maybe 2 1/2 cups) from this adobo chicken and 1/2 cup of water and baked the rice covered at 425 for a half hour.  Yummy!!

I give this 4 stars for giving me the idea of using a slow cooker to make adobo, a dish that I have made many times.  Otherwise, the actual ingredients are make a very basic adobo, and miss a couple of common ingredients.

Try using red or white wine vinegar, but at a minimum use cider vinegar- white vinegar should be last resort.

Add the traditional adobo ingredients- 10-15 whole black peppercorns and 1-2 bay leaves.

Add  1-2 Tbls. of brown sugar.

I recommend using reduced sodium soy sauce.  I like Aloha brand, but there are other good ones.

I did not need to add water.

Finally, try adding a cup of coconut milk- I like the ones from Thailand found in the Asian section of your store or at an Asian grocery.

I have a lot of Filipino friends, and I am half Thai, so I am used to Asian dishes. One of my favorite authentic Filipino dishes is Chicken or Pork Adobo, so I was thrilled to see a recipe that was really easy to make( 5 Stars for Easiness) The downside is that I stayed home today while it was cooking and I couldn't stand the smell. It was pungent...The best description I can think of would be a jar of pickles cooking all day on the stovetop. My 5 year old would not stop complaining about it. I thought the recipe had TOO MUCH VINEGAR. I didn't take those other "sour" complaints seriously, and I wished I would of listened. Even though I went easy on the vinegar, added extra water and sugar,the dish was still very sour and overpowering. Start off with 1/8 cup vinegar or less if you aren't used to Chicken Adobo. Then add more later to taste. That way your dish won't go to waste...like mine.

I used chicken thighs from which I removed the skin (I fried the skin up and fed it to the cats, they were in kitty heaven)  Otherwise I followed the recipe more-or-less exactly except to add bay leaves and peppercorns as suggested by other reviewers.  It tasted even better than the adobo my Filipino brother-in-law makes.  My husband who grown weary of my experimenting and has been asking me to make a few dishes that "originated on this continent", absolutely loved it.  I served it with garlic rice and sliced mangos drizzled with Mango/Chile Vinegar from Trader Joe's.  Pay no attention to the bad reviews.  This was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  I did make some changes--I used rice wine vinegar and cut it down to 1/4 c, added 2 tsp. ginger and 2T brown sugar.  It was so easy and delicious!  My son said it was like eating chicken wings without the mess.  Next time, I will skin the chicken first or use boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

I had ordered this meal at a Caribbean restaurant last week, and wanted to try it at home.  I reviewed the reviews, and decided to try the recipe with the all suggestions of community.  I added fresh ginger, 1T brown sugar, 1 c. H2O, black pepper and 2 bay leaves.  I skinned the chicken and used low sodium soy.  The result was better that the restaurant!!  Thanks for a great recipe base.

Definitely good!  A solid 4-star.  A few revisions will likely bump it up to a 5-star.  Use a large yellow onion and not a medium sweet one for better flavor.  I use a lot of sweet onion but not for adobo.  Use a lot more garlic, a whole bulb is probably in order.  Freshly grated ginger is another big plus in adobo, as much as 2 tablespoons.  Use equal parts soy sauce and vinegar.  Don't use regular white/clear vinegar, use apple cider vinegar, again for better flavor.  No need to measure your liquids just use equal parts of both soy and cider vinegar, enough to completely cover the chicken.  Other reviews of this recipe state that they might try boneless, skinless breasts.  Don't!  You'll have much better results if you use the whole chicken, both white and dark meat, skin and bones all combine for a superior adobo.

This was soo good, I ate until two helpings! I loved the sauce over steamed rice. My Filipino boyfriend said it's just like his mom used to make it. Although I did put in a bay leaf as he said it was the "secret." Meat was so tender it fell right off the bone! Thanks for this wonderfully easy recipe. Will make again for sure! UPDATE 2/4/08: As if this couldn't get any better...I tried this by frying the chicken for a couple minutes on each side in a little olive oil then added the rest of the ingredients right into the pan. Didn't measure the soy and vinegar, just made sure they were equal parts and put enough to cover the chicken. I added 2 whole jalapenos, 3 whole cloves of garlic, about a half of a sliced onion and about 3 bay leaves instead of just one. Simmered for about 45 minutes and this was even better than in the slow cooker and was just as easy!! Once again, great over sticky white rice. PS Use white vinegar! Also, I used Low Sodium Soy Sauce.UPDATE AGAIN 10/17/08:I used garlic powder instead of whole cloves because the next day it seemed kind of tart like when you overcook garlic. Didnt fry the chicken just dumped it all in the pan-just as good. *New tip* Thicken some of the juice with corn starch and it makes a wonderful sauce. Not so brothy and it mixes better with the rice. Boyfriend went nuts because he could smell it from outside when he came home, and again when he tried the sauce. Im going to use the sauce to make shrimp & veggie stir fry tomorrow since we

Dont add the onion, it will make it more pungent.  Most of the flavor should come from the garlic and vinegar. White vinegar is best.  I have had alot of adobo as I come from a filipino family and have had alot of different families cook it for me.  Reduced sodium soy sauce is best to use to keep it from having a strong sodium taste and you can be liberal with the soy sauce if you do so, but a pinch of salt may be needed.  Brown the chicken first, this is a very important step, as is browning the garlic.  For my taste, the more garlic the better.  If you really want to impress guests, add one star anise.  Experiment alot as I have found rubbing the chicken with pepper, rubbed sage and ground coriander before searing can give this dish a very distinct flavor that your guests will never forget.

Actually 4.5 stars. Someone recommended this to me in a Recipe Buzz exchange and I decided to try it. The vote from my wife afterwards? ... "You can do this again. We can even serve this at one of our guest evenings". That was high praise indeed. I (of course) then did it a second time. It was still good. The third time I tweaked! I added some fresh ginger. And that was a nice little addition so I will be doing that in the future.

I did maybe 10 weeks, off and on, in the Philippines while serving in Vietnam in the mid-60's.  I became addicted to adobo.  [Anything] Adobo.  I'd probably eat Worms Adobo if offered.  This is a really good recipe.  Don't stop with the onion, try carrots, potatoes [put them in right at the end].  We put pea pods, a green pepper, and broccoli in.  Don't worry if the chicken isn't covered at first, it will be.  Thighs work just great, the bones are big and you can pick them out when you're serving them.  Really good on brown rice.  I used red wine vinegar, but I'm not sure it matters.   You can do this with pork too.  A really easy recipe and it can simmer until you're really ready for dinner.

Very mouth watering and the meat just fell off the bone I used 2 chicken legs and 2 chicken thighs. I will deffinately make this again! Thank you

I have no idea what adobo means, but this is a super-easy way to cook a chicken, and it results in flavorful and moist chicken, usually with plenty leftover to stir into another dish.

Fantastic!!  Tasted exactly as when it was made for me by a Filipino family!  Excellent when served with rice or mashed potatoes.  My only modifications were that I skinned the chicken, added 1/3 cup brown sugar, and added 2 cups water so that the marinade/mixture completely covered the chicken while cooking (a fool-proof way of avoiding the odd dry piece of meat when cooking in crock pots).  The sugar and extra water cut the "kick" of the vinegar perfectly.  For those of you who mentioned that the sauce was watery... it's supposed to be. I prefer it that way, but for those of you who like thicker gravy, a little cornstarch or flour will thicken it nicely.

This recipe by itself isn't very good, however, I read a bunch of the reviews and decided to use a lot of the added suggestions to come up with the best 5 star version of this recipe.  I used a whole cut up chicken on the bones and with the skin.  I used 3/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce, 1 1/2 tsp. brown sugar, 2 bay leaves, 1/8 cup red wine vinegar, a cup of chicken broth, a yellow onion, 2 tsp fresh ground ginger, a generous amount of granulated garlic and cracked pepper.  I cooked it on high in the slow cooker for 4 hours and kept it on warm till dinner.  I served it over white rice with a dark green salad and a homemade balsamic vinaigrette.  PERFECT!

I made this tonight and it was delicious. I made the following changes based on people's recommendations, and a few of my own: 2 packages of boneless, skinless chicken thighs (but would use 3 packages next time), apple cider vinegar, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 - 1 tsp. brown sugar, and 1/2 tsp. of peppercorns. I served it over basmati rice and with sauteed asparagas. Yum!

Being Filipino, I was somewhat skeptical about cooking adobo in a slow cooker. Much to my surprise, it was wonderful!!!  First of all, the adobo smell does tend to linger in the house, so I set up the cooker under the covered patio. Using white vinegar does help with the cooking odor, but I only had apple cider vinegar. I did add a couple of bay leaves and about 2 tsp of black peppercorns. I love onions w/ adobo, so I used 1 large sweet onion, sliced 1/3-1/2" so it wouldn't disintegrate during the cooking process. I was running a little behind in starting the cooker, so I put it on high for 2 hrs then low for the last 4 hrs. Also, baste the chicken hourly, if possible. The chicken fell off the bone beautifully and it was not at all dry. Spoon the sauce onto jasmine rice and chow down!! My family loved it!

I took a few of the reviewers advice and I left out the onion, used 1/3 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 10 crushed garlic cloves, 1 cup of water, 2 bay leaves and a big TBS of peppercorn..I used drumsticks (thats what was in my freezer).. It turned out very good.. It was a nice balance of peppery, garlicky, slight vinegary chicken.. I think next time I will use a little less water cause I like my adobo a little vinegary.. But it didn't stink up the house and it went great with white rice.. I also made lumpias to go with it! Great time saver!

Fabulous recipe, thank you! I used rice wine vinegar because it was what I had, and frozen pearl onions because we love them. So, minor changes for my convenience and a delicious result with very little effort.

Great recipe and super easy! A lot of the reviews concerned me, as i am a very picky eater so i took some of the advice and used only 1/4 cup white vinegar and added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, as well as 10 cloves of garlic total. It turned out perfect and was a huge hit with my friends. I served it over rice and everyone kept going back for seconds! I also used 6 chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken and that was very handy. The meat fell right off the bones and was delicious!

My Filipino husband loved this! Just like his Grama's. Substituting chicken breasts for the whole chicken still tasted great but just wasn't the same flavor. Definitely add the peppercorns and bay leaves. Skip the onions and any sugar suggested by other reviewers (not real adobo.)

Excellent! I live overseas where there is a large Filipino community. My live in housemaid is also Filipino and she loved it. I altered the recipe by adding 2 bay leaves, peppercorns, and 1T of brown sugar. Once everything was cooked, I degreased the juices and thickened them with a bit of cornstarch. Super yummy!! This recipe is a keeper!

I have made this on occasions when I need to serve a lot of people.  it always turns out great, and there are never enough leftovers.  The last time I made it I took the leftovers to work with some rice, and several people asked me for the recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe to add more garlic!

This recipe is a very flavorful dish and easy to prepare. I wouldn't say it was my absolute favorite of all but it's a tasty and different change for dinner. I will make it again every now and then. I used apple cider vinegar.

My mom is Filipino and taught me her recipe when I was younger.  She is a fantastic cook, so this one isn't quite as good as hers, but it's pretty darn close.  Plus the fact that it's so much easier to make, makes it a lot more appealing.  I added freshly ground pepper and a couple bay leaves.  Definitely use white wine vinegar and low sodium soy sauce and serve over white rice.  If you've never had Chicken Adobo, you must try it.  If you've made it before, you will love the ease of this recipe and how good it turns out.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  My husband is still raving about it!

I used a whole chicken once, VERY oily feeling.  I have used skinless/boneless chicken breast and prefer it that way.  I guess I could try skinning the chicken because I like to use the bones for broth...  For the record a 4+ lb chicken only gave 2 lbs meat!  I added the brown sugar 1/2c but honestly don't think it made a difference!  I think the soy sauce is perfect.  Didn't have a problem with the smell either.  USE WHITE VINEGAR!!!  Great for toddlers because it's been slow cooked the meat is VERY tender.  Easy for them to tear apart and chew.  I have a one year old and a two year old and they loved this.  Used 2 1/2 c of the juice from this with 1 1/2 rice with big onion chunks (I like to remove mine when done kids won't eat them!), bring to a boil then simmer 20 min with lid on. Add about 1/4 c chopped fresh parsley and you've got a wonderful rice pilaf to accompany your chicken!!!  PERFECT!

I've not made this in crockpot but I would imagine it would be the same as using a pan. I've read some negative reviews and all I can say is cook it to your taste buds. Adobo is always with bay leaf and peppercorn. The ratio of soy to vinegar is about 1 to 1 (about 1/2 cup each). I add brown sugar (2 Tb) to tame the tang. Dark meat (or cut up whole chicken) is best for adobo; white meat will be dry. I like a couple of slices of ginger, again to your taste buds. I like adding potatoes too (add towards the end). Eat with steam rice.

After reading some of the comments I adjusted a few things to avoid things being too salty and tasting too much like vinegar. I added 1/2 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of vinegar, 1 tsp of sugar, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 tsp of black pepper and 1 cup of chicken broth and kept the garlic the same. I also added onion and carrots. I know adobo is suppose to be tangy but it was too tangy for me so I added the sugar. I kept it on low for 6 hours and it was ready to serve. It was okay, not my favorite but not bad.

I've made adobo before (and eaten it many, many times), but I couldn't remember the entire recipe my adopted Filipino family taught me, so I tried this one and brought it into work for my Filipino coworkers to try.  The flavoring is very light, more like "American-ized Adobo".  Everyone agreed that much more vinegar is needed for "real adobo".  The chicken came out very moist and tender, falling off the bone, but this is due to cooking it in the slow cooker.  It didn't taste bad, it's just not a strong enough flavor.  Add a lot more vinegar when making this, I recommend Native cane vinegar, found in Filipino and Asian grocers.  The soy sauce is probably the right amount, maybe a little more as the coloring seemed to be about right.

We enjoyed this recipe very much. I didn't have a whole chicken so I made it using boneless breasts, which I shredded and served on top of the rice. It was delicious and the chicken was very tender. We are gluten free, and I adapted this recipe using GF soy sauce. FYI- Wal Mart's generic brand soy sauce is gluten free and very cheap. Thanks for the recipe. It's definitely going in my rotation.

Hmmm... I'm missing something with this one. It just tastes like chicken and soy sauce. I guess I was expecting a magnificent transformation.--Didn't get it. It was easy, that's good I guess. I don't think I'll be doing this one again.

I haven't made this particular recipe yet, though it is very close to one given to me by a Filipino friend. After reading the reviews, I was confused by all the people adding sugar to this recipe.  Adobo should have a pleasant salty/vinegary taste. The vinegar gets less intense as it simmers with the chicken. Adobo isn't supposed to have sugar! This isn't a recipe for teriyaki or sweet and sour. If that's the flavor you are after, you're better off trying a different recipe.

This was delicious. The meat fell right off the bone. I just used chicken legs with backs attached and cut them apart. Cut vinegar to 1/4 cup and added brown sugar and ginger. My teenage son bought his friends over and they devoured it.

We made this last night and everyone agreed it was not tasty at all.  We ended up throwing away almost the whole bird.  We didn't have a problem with the chicken being over cooked, it was actually cooked just right, but it was the ingredients that made it awful.

This was my first time making / eating chicken adobo. I used a cheap bag of frozen chicken breasts. It was wonderful. So easy and so tasty! I actually enjoyed the pungent, tangy smell and flavor. In fact, I might go with a more intense vinegar than plain white next time.

I used 1/2 cup soy sauce & substituted 1/2 cup red wine for the vinegar because I didn't want it to be too tangy for my picky eaters. I sprinkled cumin & used leg quarters because that's what I had. My pickiest eater (my 9- year-old son,) gave it a resounding 5 stars. Everyone liked it, & it was super easy. Definitely will add this to my busy work week stash of recipes.

This is a quick version of adobo. I recommend you try an authentic stovetop recipe first before a crockpot version so you can make changes based on knowing what it should taste like.

My mother worked at a Filipino and Bracero Work Camp and cooked at both kitchens.  She made us adobe chicken but with different ingredients; with a pestle she crushed one tablespoon pickling spices; crushed 4 or more garlic cloves; 1/2 cup vinegar and several cans of tomato sauce.  She browned the chicken then added the ingredients.  She added about 1/2 cup of water to make a sauce and simmered until sauce thickened about 45 minutes.  Pour chicken and sauce over white rice.  Very delectable and not as tangy made with tomato sauce.

Hubby is Filipino and has a Filipino mama. He said this was close to what she makes but too much vinegar. Also he said you need bay leaves and peppercorn. He said there is something else but her forgets what. 

For me this was very salty. I never had my MIL adobo so I can not compare.

Wow!  So many conflicting reviews!  I followed JC Perez's suggestions from 12/29/05 and used 1/3 cup soy, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, and 1 cup water, but followed the recipe otherwise.  I used chicken legs and thickened up the sauce with cornstarch at the end.  My husband who normally does not like chicken, really enjoyed it enough to take it to work with him for lunch.  I made it with white rice and Colombian frijoles and it was gone quicker than I would ever expected.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I'm sorry but this recipe was awful. I made several modifications suggested by other reviewers including adding bay leaves, brown sugar, ginger, red wine vinegar and reducing soya sauce. Served it with jasmine rice which was the hi-light of the meal! Used dark meat and while it was very tender, the taste was terrible - we could not even finish it. Won't ever make this again.

This was easy, convenient and delicious. I don't know what the previous reviewers were talking about when they said it stank during cooking. It smelled fantastic! I used balsamic vinegar. I read lots of the previous reviews and balsamic seemed to be highly recommended. Other tips I took from others: Added ginger, used low sodium soy sauce, added brown sugar, 2 bay leaves, and a half cup of water. I wanted to add pineapples too, but I didn't have that on hand. TRY THIS! ITS AWESOME!

Maybe this is an acquired taste, but I ate one piece and had to eventually throw it all away. I thought about feeding it to the cat, but was afraid the high sodium content would hurt him.

This is a recipe I return to often. I add half vinegar & half white wine, when I have it, more garlic, and about three cups sliced mushrooms. Very yummy & easy.

... I am sorry.  I have NO idea if I did something wrong, but I cook all the time, love to cook, and often get compliments on my cooking.  Not to mention this recipe is SO simple, how could I mess it up... BUT, it was TERRIBLE!  Also, we all LOVE vinegar, so I have no idea what went so horribly wrong here?  I wont make it again though...

We enjoyed it thoroughly, and we went straight by the recipe, although we did alter the amount of garlic rice wine vinegar down to the 1/8th cup as recommended by another review.  We added about 1/2 a cup of sour cream at the end to add a little to the sauce, and try to thicken it up.  It would have been good without it, but it did not deter from it in any way.  Also, the extra sauce could easily be used as a tasty marinade for a roast, or perhaps even a steak!  *UPDATE:  I absolutely adore this recipe!  I basically use the sauce as a catchall for flavor - I add garlic vinegar, a few drops of hot-flavored oil, etc.  After dinner, I put the remaining sauce in a container and store in the fridge for up to 3 days.  Put a beef roast in the crockpot, pour the sauce over and voila!  A second easy dinner!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  I followed the suggestion of cooking the chicken skinless, already cut into serving pieces.  So tender and flavorful! The kids didn't eat much because the meat turns brown---they don't know what they're missing!

We really enjoyed the flavor of this simple chicken dish.  It was great over steamed rice and served with stir-fried vegetables.  My only complaint was that it was sort of greasy.  When I make it again, I will cut the chicken into serving pieces and skin them.  This will definetely go into MyRecipeBox.

This was very, very good. Do yourself a favor - watch the video because it gives more detail and lets you know to use rice vinegar, and add pepper corns and bay leaves for a more authentic taste (which is correct). I wished I added more pepper corns than the video suggested - the video said a "few," I would go with about 10. My only modification was that I only had "regular strength" soy sauce so I used a half cup soy sauce and half cup water (to reduce the sodium).

I almost talked myself out of making this after reading the reviews saying it smelled so horrible, had to throw it out, yada yada yada. Glad I didn't listen to them! We loved this, and the house smelled wonderful while it was cooking. I chickened out and used a little less vinegar (those bad reviews you know!), but when I make it again, I'm going to use the full amount. Yum!

This was delicious but I would suggest using boneless chicken breast or debone chicken before cooking. Using the whole chicken & cutting it up just leaves a soupy mess of chicken & bones.

Pretty good recipe for being in a slow cooker which I have never done.  My mother traditionally taught me to use the good ole' stove top for this Filipino favorite.  I too like to use white vinegar vs. cider vinegar and I omit the sugar since it's meant to be a "tangy" dish so to speak.  One thing this recipe is missing is the bay leaves which I think is key for an authentic Filipino adobo recipe, otherwise, it's pretty good.  I'll definitely try it again.  -Caligirl

yum!  Tender chicken, low fat, low carb, low calorie, and SUPER EASY....what else do you want!!!  Since the recipe doesn't specifiy what type of vinegar, I used red wine vinegar.  Added 1 TBS splenda brown sugar blend....and that's it!!  I made it with the "quick chinese-style Vermicelli noodles" from this website (altough I'm thinking the noodles are more thai than chinese...just sayin')  Anyway....fabulous dinner.  Thank you Ms Lapp

I really liked this as did my teenage son.  I used bone in thighs and removed skin.  I added 1 t chopped ginger, 1/2 cup water, 1 T sugar and 3 bay leaves.  When it was cooked I boned the chicken.  Took all but 1 cup of liquid and thicken with some cornstarch.  Then I added the chicken to thickened sauce.  The 1 cup  broth I used to cook rice....very good

Essentially it is stewed chicken drenched in soy sauce. I make adobo, it is meant to be tangy with hints of vinegar, garlic. Some dishes simply need to be cooked.

Adobo is a favorite with every Filipino family.  I have a husband and teenage son who are both hearty eaters so I always add potatoes.  Just cut them in halves or quarters (depending on cooking time).  We always eat this over steamed rice with freshly cut ripened tomatoes on the side.  Yummy!

Being a filipino I know how hard making chicken adobo the old fashion way is. This recipe is excellent, didnt use a slow cooker however. I used a normal 6 quart pot, and cooked it for no more than 2 hrs. My mom says its better than hers. Thanks alot!!!

Great recipe!!!  I used chicken breast w/ bone instead of a whole chicken.  I also used low sodium soy sauce and even with that it was a bit saltier than I would have liked, but serving it with rice helped.  Next time I will cut the soy sauce with water.

I used half a cup soy sauce,and half a cup rice vinegar. I was worried about it being sour,so I added 2T brown sugar. It was delicious, and so easy. I also browned the chicken before putting it in the slow cooker, then poured the sauce over it, and left it to marinade for 15mins, before turning the slow cooker on.

So easy and delicious.  Adobo was not meant to be sweet like a previous poster mentioned and this recipe (in my opinion) is in perfect proportion.  White vinegar is a must. Our county fair has an awesome adobo concession stand and I'm so glad to be able to have it more than once a year!  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. But did not use onions because my best friend is a Filipino and she said you don't put onions in chicken adobo. Just soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and bay leaves

Really good!  I was hesitant about "pickling" my chicken but am glad I went forward.  I followed the recipe to the letter excepting I used white vinegar for cider vinegar.  No sugar! Whether its authentic or not, this is a flavor combination the my family really likes.  I even enjoyed the aroma of pickling chicken but then again, I'm a pickle fiend.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Turns out good. I've made this a few times. Lots of flavor. However, the juice turns out to be a little watery. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could get it to turn out a little thicker without changing the flavor

Five stars if you do what some others are doing with the pepper corns, bay leaves that you just got from Penzy's and coconut vinegar that can be found in a FilAm store, perhaps other Asian markets or on line. Sooo good!

This was delicious, though I did some tweaking to it. I didn't have enough garlic cloves so I used minced/dried garlic and onion powder instead of the fresh. To the rice (after it was cooked) I added veggies, 2 T butter, salt and pepper. My husband loved it and my son ate it! It's a new favorite in our recipe box!

I used 1.5 lbs of drumsticks so I halved all the the ingredients except the garlic (kept it at 8 cloves).  From the other reviewers, I trusted them (who would know better than a Fillipino!) and left out the onions, added 2 bay leaves, dash of brown sugar, 8-10 peppercorns, and some water.  Cooked it at 6 hours on low, could have probably been taken out before since it was a bit on the dry side.  The smell as it cooks makes you salivate and the sauce comes out amazing!  So easy that I will definitely make again and take it out a bit earlier.

This was fabulous, I'm stuffed!  I followed recipe and used white vinegar, and the bay leaf recommendation. I did not have a problem with the smell, in fact my family kept asking when is it going to be done! I did not add sugar, and I think to do so would ruin it, but I think we have become sugar addicts.  My advice is try it without the sugar first, why add the extra calories?  My family was pleased with the results with this simple recipe.

This recipe didn't work out at all for me.  I have made adobo chicken on the stove top many times with much success.  This recipe, however, left me with metallic tasting chicken.  The sauce was tasty but I will never make this in a slow cooker again.

Super easy to make.  I used white wine vinegar and didn't think it was particularly smelly during the cooking process.  As recommended by several reviewers, I added bay leaves and peppercorns to the sauce, along with about a tablespoon of brown sugar.  Very different flavor combinations from the chicken we usually eat, tasty and satisfying.  Served with fresh sliced tomotoes and red beans and rice.

Oh my, this was delicious!  I didn't have low-sodium soy sauce so I used 1/2 cup regular soy sauce + 1/4 cup water to substitute. As per some other reviews I added 2 bay leaves and 1/2 TBSP of peppercorns.  It only had to cook 4 hours in my slow cooker and the meat was falling off the bone!  Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe.

definitely an acquired taste used some of the other readers suggestion, added bay leaf and black pepper. also arbol chile and a few carrots slice thin diagonally.  loved the chicken,i used cutup thigh and breast. can't really recommend the sauce for rice, although it would go well seasoned basmati rice. next time around i may add some tomato paste, just to round out and mellow the vinegar.

Pretty good! It's close to my husband and daughters brothy type of adobo. I usually cook my adobo in a stove top but i got lazy and just wanted to throw in my frozen large drumsticks in a crock pot and walk away while doing other house work. I never add onions to my adobos but sometimes I do add potatoes 10-15 minutes (depending how big the cut is) before the chicken is done.   It may be a little salty from the biginning but that's okay. The chicken needs to absorb the saltiness from the soy sauce, just add water half way through the cooking process. The first few hours is just a marination stage. I also had to add the other common ingredients which were 2 bay leaves and half tablespoon of peppercorn.

So yummy! I followed another reviewer's advice and omittd the onions. I only had 1/2 of soy sauce and it was not too tangy. It was perfect! I would recommend using dark meat as the breast meat gets a little dry cooking this long.

I have made this dish twice in a week and loved it both ways I made it! First time I followed directions exactly and thought it was fabulous, but my wife said it was too salty for her taste. Second time out, I cut the soy sauce back to 1/2 cup, added 1/4 cup water to compensate. Definitely was less salty (and not as tasty for my palate) but wife was pleased. I will confess to being a saltaholic, so those who don't care for salty food may want to cut back on the soy or use low-sodium soy sauce. 

Either way you do it, this is a great recipe for the middle of the week when you need something simple yet delicious for the slow cooker.

Love the flavor though the chicken was a little dry and a little too salty. I did use some of the liquid for making brown rice and that was delicious. Don't know if I'd make again...maybe with less soy?

Yum! The chicken was so tender it fell apart, and the flavor was great.  I made one adjustment and that was to add 1/4 cup molassas, which gave a it a slightly sweet taste.  We enjoyed it even more on the second day.

This was a good recipe, I made some modifications suggested by other reviews.  Used 1/2c soy and 1/4 c water, added a teaspoon of ginger and some brown sugar.  It came out nice, chicken was very tender and juicy and flavorful.  Served with rice and veggie mix.  will make again.  Oh the smell was wonderful while it was cooking!!

Very Good and easy. I made just a few changes. I sprinkled the chicken w/ Adobo powder and only added 1/2 cup of light soy, 1/4 cup red wine and the full amount of vinegar. Cooked on high for 1 hr then low for 5. When chicken thighs were done, I pulled them out and thickened the sauce w/ corn starch then shredded the chicken and added back into the crock. Served over rice. Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe was very good after I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers.  I only used 1/2 cup of soy sauce.  I used rice vinegar.  And added 1/4 cup of water, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp fresh ginger, 2 crushed bay leaves, 1/4 of red wine, 15 peppercorns.  With all the additions I would give this recipe 5 stars.  It was super easy to make and both my DH and kids loved it.  I will be making this again!

I took the advice of others and added 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, 2 tsp of ginger. I used chicken breasts and mine were a little dry because I should not have cooked it for the full 6 hours (next time I will know better.) A good recipe but not great. I served w/ Basmati rice.

Although this was good, it didn't taste quite the same as the chicken adobo I had while living in the Philippines.  I cut back on both the vinegar and soy sauce, and added peppercorns, bay leaves, and a touch of brown sugar.  It was still missing something though (but it gets props for simplicity).  I used chicken breasts with bones (I removed the skin) and it was wonderfully tender.

I made this dish and loved it!  My husban and five year old loved it, too.  I did take suggestions and added enough water to cover chicken, added brown sugar, ginger and a bay leaf.  Also, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  It came out wonderfully.

Nothing remarkable about this one for me.  I might try it again and assemble everything in the crockpot liner well in advance, leaving it overnight in the refrigerator so the chicken can marinate.  Easy to prepare, the chicken was tender, but just about all chicken prepared in the crockpot is tender due to the method.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I do , however, agree with others who used some brown sugar (I used 1 1/2 tsp) and added 3.4 cup of water as well as used red wine vinegar (1/4 cup instread of 1/2 cup.  I also used half of the soy sauce and replaced the oother half with terriyaki.  Great with rice!!!

Yum!
I substituted lite teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce and
red wine vinegar for plain vinegar. I also removed about half the 
skin to cut down on fat and added 2 tbsp. brown sugar.
Very good... smells great while cooking too!

I went against my better judgement when I bypassed the negative reviews for this recipe. I have used vinegar/soy sauce recipes before - the difference this time is there is nothing sweet to dull the salty sour taste and there is nothing to thicken the sauce. If you like sour and acrid with a sauce the consistancy of water - this recipe is for you. I will not be making this again.

This recipe was great!  I skinned the chicken, used rice vinegar, mirin(sake seasoning, and poured water in to cover the chicken.  It turned out wonderful!  It was easy and tasted great!  I put it on max heat to cut on the time, and it came right off the bone!  Kudos to u!

My husband who rarely comments on anything I cook went crazy over this dish.  I loved it too.  And so so easy.  I did precisely what the recipe called for and it was perfect.  We will be eating a lot of this.  I am not much of a chicken lover but this dish makes chicken yummy !!!!

This was quite tasty but something was missing for me. I have only had Adobo Chicken one other time so I might just have a taste for my friends recipe. Still very tasty though!

This was very good turned out great. I added brown sugar about 1/4 cup and 4 bay leave served with rice everybody loves it. I would recommend to season the chicken how you like it tho and instead of using a whole chicken ( it's a lot if bones ) use breast or just 6 legs. Thanks for sharing

Whole Foods had a sale on organic whole chicken so I bought and brought home.  My meal planning doesn't usually include whole chicken.  I was happy to have found this recipe.  I made a few tweaks and my family loved the results.  
I added the broth from boiling the organ meats and neck, along with some grated fresh ginger, and big chunks of carrots.  I used only 4 cloves of crushed garlic but 8 whole peppercorns and two bay leaves.  

After about 7 hrs on low I served over brown rice.
The meat was so juicy and just fell off the bone. 
delicious!

This was a great recipe. Super simple, super cheap and just a little different from the average marinade. I left out the onion and it was just as tasty.

Very surprised how easy and delicious this recipe was! Just like what I remembered having had at a local Pilipino restaurant. I followed other reviewer’s suggestions and added 2-3 bay leaves and peppercorns because I love them both and it could only be that much better. Will make again for company. It’s that good!

My 2.5yr old - who eats nothing - ate an entire drumstick!!  I amended the recipe as per the comments - adding the brown sugar, bay leaves and decreasing the soy sauce to 1/4c and using red wine vinegar.  This will definitely be a repeating dish in our house!

What I do,  is add bamboo shoots drained, sliced water chestnuts drained, sliced mushrooms, black pepper, and  about 1/2 cup  water to cut down on saltiness of soy sauce.  I used apple cider vinegar, but will be trying the white vinegar, next time.  My family loves chicken adobo served with steamed white rice.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the adobo turned out too potent....I think next time I will add some water to make sure everything is covered and that it won't be so strong

I made a couple changes. I used three boneless skinless chicken breasts, 3/4 soy sauce, 1/2C vinegar(white), 8 garlic cloves pressed, 2 bay leaves and crushed black peppercorn and cooked in crockpot on high for 4 hours, stirring occasionally. My Filipino husband rated it an 8.5/10 - which I feel is pretty good for my first time making Chicken Adobo :) I served w/ rice made in the rice cooker. DELISH!!!

Replace half the soy sauce with water so it is not so salty and add black pepper (2 tsp).  I also followed another review wich said to use cider vinegar. Serve it over rice. YUMMY!

Super Recipe!  I used 1/2 worstishire sauce and 1/2 Soy Sauce to cut down on the salt.  Will for sure make this one again-kids and husband really enjoyed it!

Wow...so simple and so good.  I used a whole chicken and just took the skin off and threw it into the pot.  I did use equal parts (3/4 cup each) of rice vinegar and low-sodium soy sauce and also added some pepper and bay leaves as other reviewers had suggested. Yum!  P.S. The house smelled amazing.

Excellent flavor.  I put the chicken in whole and flipped it midway thru cooking.  When done, it fell right off the bone.  Served it over white jasmine rice.

This is now one of our absolute favorite ways to cook chicken.  What a wonderful taste!  I usually just plop the whole chicken in the crock pot.  However, to make it have a little less fat, today I took the skin off the chicken before putting it in the crock pot.  Can't wait to smell it cooking!!!

This adobo is great! My son-in-law is Hawaiian Phillipino and always makes this dish for me for my birthday.  The dish lost nothing in the slow cooker translation. By the way no problems with a vinegar smell at all.

A very good and easy chicken. If you're not fond of soy sauce or garlic you may not like this very much. Chicken was moist and tender.

I didn't care for this at all. I added the bay leaf and peppercorns as suggested, but it just tasted like soy sauce and vinegar sauce over chicken. Very salty.

My mom is Filipina, and this reminds me of home! My first taste reaction was literally "Wow!" The taste is very authentic. I did add a bunch of whole peppercorns and 2 bay leaves. Loved it! I'll definitely make this again.

This is my first review and I wanted to say that I cooked this chicken pretty much according to recipe, using the soy sauce and (white) vinegar.  I did cook it on high for about 3.5 hours and it was done. Didn't have any bay leaves, but did have some peppercorns to toss in and the chicken came out delicious;  falling off the bone, moist, and flavorful!  I will definitely cook this again soon.

Delicious!  I suggest removing the skin from the chicken before cooking.  I removed  the skin from half of the pieces, and left it on the other half, and every piece was equally moist and tender, and the skins were soggy and made the sauce a bit oilier than I would have liked.  I also cooked it 3 hours on high in the crock pot.  I asked the BF if he liked it enough for me to make again, and he replied, "I'd be mad if you didn't!"

Fantastic.  I used boneless skinless breasts and thighs, added 1/8th cup brown sugar and 1/2T ginger.  A major hit with my husband and kids (even my picky 10 y/o son who cleaned his plate!!).  I will definitely make this again - not only did it taste fantastic but it made the whole house smell incredible!

I had always heard how good Adobo Chicken was, but never tried it.  I thought this recipe would be a good place to start and I was right!  I followed the recipe using some reviewers suggestions of reducing soy sauce to 1/2 cup, adding a bay leaf and using red wine vinegar.  I served it with steamed brown rice to soak up the heavenly juices and a nice green salad. This was so good and a huge hit with my husband.  He said this is a definite keeper and requested that I make often! I agree, and will make it often as it is so easy to prepare, tasty, healthy and an economical dish as well.

I've made chicken adobo lots of times on the stove so I modified a bit to match the taste I'm used to.  I used rice vinegar instead of distilled, added a chili pepper for spice, and used 50/50 medium sweet soy sauce  and regular soy sauce with just a little brown sugar.  I've always used this combo and a co-worker who's filipino says it tastes just like "home" to him.  The only thing I didn't like was the shredded chicken.  I prefer the cut pieces of chicken from my original recipe so I'll probably make this in the slow cooker next time with just the onions then throw in a pot with chicken 20 minutes before eating.  I was told that traditionally you take the onions and chicken out of the sauce, carmelize in a pan then put that on top of rice and pour the sauce over it.  With the shredded chicken it didn't turn out as well so I'll stick to cutting it up instead.  Otehr than that it was delicious.

I went with several other suggestions on this recipe, and it was very easy and very good.  I loved it and my husband liked it too.  I used 1/4 c red wine vinegar instead of white, 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce, and I added 1 Tbs brown sugar, 1/4 cup water, 2 bay leaves, 10 peppercorns, 1 Tbs chopped ginger. I also only used 1/2 pound chicken thigh meat, still very easy with all of the extra stuff.  I served it with rice. I will definitley make it again and the only thing I would do differently next time is add a vegetable, like snow peas or broccoli.

This turned out wonderful.  I used leg quarters that I boiled for about 20 mintues, let cool then took meat off bones.  Used low sodium soy salt and a couple of dashes of hot sauce.  Tasted great, thanks for the post.

This is a classic Filipino dish, traditionally slow-cooked in a clay pot, so it lends itself well to slow-cooking.  You can easily add vegetables to do this dish.  Green beans can be added half-way through cooking time.  Spinach works well too, but wait until the last 1/2 hour or so.  You could also add peppercorn and bay leaf to this dish for  extra flavor.

This was great!  I cooked it on high almost all day, then deboned and shredded, and then put back into crockpot for an hour or so til dinner. I served this to 4 children and all asked for seconds!!  I don't like to cut onions so used 3/4 cup of frozen diced onions.  I will use this as a once a month cooking recipe...or make double and freeze the left overs.

I love ethnic foods and was excited to taste something different but this was awful. I must be one of those people who don't like adobo! I used some chicken legs and some chicken breasts and let it cook 6 hours on low just like the recipe said. I even cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup and put in pineapples and juice as one reviewer suggested. Sorry.

I have made this several times now, sometimes using a whole chicken, sometimes just boneless breasts, and it always comes out great!  This last time I added potatoes and cabbage to the mix, which soaked up the wonderful flavor nicely.  Even my picky boyfriend liked it.  Easy and delicious--Serve over rice.  I highly recommend...

i love chicken adobo, but i hate cooking on the stovetop (smelly).  so i was so happy to find this slow cooker version!  i added 2 bay leaves and after 4 1/2 hours (on high/low) i think it came out great.  both my son and my husband loved it.  my sister uses balsamic vinegar for a stronger taste, as this is a bit mild.  i'm making it again now, and am going to add some ginger as recommended below.  if you've never had adobo or aren't uses to filipino foods you may not like this.  it's not your average chicken dish.   also...i use white wine vinegar and low sodium kikoman soy sauce.

I used some of the suggestions already listed in Reviews and this recipe worked out very well. I added about a half cup of brown sugar for a more tangy taste. The meat was very tender. I added cornstarch to make gravy as suggested but I preferred the taste of just dipping the chicken into the left over sauce. I had a frozen chicken and defrosted it for 20 minutes in the mic. It turned out fine this way.

I have an Adobo Chicken recipe that we all love, but not for the crock pot. I added fresh ginger and a couple bay leaves as they are in the old recipe.  This was very good and much easier. I'll probably never make it the other way again!

This was *very* easy and quite tasty! I added 1 cup of water (per another reviewer's suggestion), and I'm glad I did. Also, I added sugar (to taste) to the sauce (after chicken was finished cooking). The sauce wasn't too runny but I was prepared to add cornstarch to thicken it a bit. This one's a keeper!

My husband and son (the picky eater) thought this was excellent.  I think I like the idea of adding a little sugar to sweeten the sauce for myself.  Easy, tasty, and tender.

What a delightful way to serve chicken, my husband absolutely loves this dish. He said the meat is sooooo teder if falls right off of the bones. I would recommend serving the sauce over rice for a most delightful diner.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I used balsamic vinegar since it was not clear as to what type to use.  Also added about a cup of water so that the chicken was covered with liquid.

This recipe was OK.  If you use boneless, skinless chicken breasts, make sure you only cook it for 6 hours on low.  Any longer than that, and the chicken will be dry.  As for the taste, it tasted like garlicy soy sauce - I guess I expected a different taste.  I served it over brown rice, and my family liked it but I don't think I will make this one again.

This was good, but I would definitely recommend less vinegar and more soy sauce.  This was just too much vinegar for me personally, but all my friends really liked it.  (But I think they would have liked it better if it had less vinegar more soy sauce, bahaha)

I used frozen chicken breasts, and they were perfectly cooked - falling apart - after 6 hours. I found the soy flavor a little overwhelming, but overall this was delicious! I will definitely make it again.

This dish was easy to prepare, but lacked flavor. I browned the chicken first before adding to crock pot and left the skin on. If I make again I need to add a little something to the sauce just unsure of what at this time. Served with baby gold potatoes and carrots ..

The taste was very good.  Added brown sugar and it made it taste like a sweet teriyaki.  I used chicken breasts instead of a whole one, so cut the cooking time by half otherwise the chicken will be dry.  Will definitely do it again

It was so good! The only thing I'm going to change when I make it again, is the cooking time. I felt the chicken was dry the first time I made it, so the second time I made it I only cooked the chicken 5 hours and it was much better.

I loved everything about this recipe, and the only change I made is that my garlic came out of a jar because I hate crushing it myself.  Since it came out of a jar I used less than 8 cloves.   
I have made this several times and the last time I only had about a 1/2 c (maybe a little less) of soy sauce, so that is all I used.
Every time it is delicious.  One of my favorite recipes!

This was great!!!  My husband spent a couple of years in the Phillippines and has always wanted to have more rice dishes.  I heard him talking about Adobo but had not been able to make it well.  This recipe worked really well for us.  I did follow the advice of other posters and added 1 Tbsp of peppercorns to the recipe and put a little less of the vinegar (white distilled).  My husband and I loved it and the kids even finished what we gave them.  The leftovers were just as good as the night of.

It was okay.  I'm also Filipina and my mother made this a staple as we were growing up.  Like others have reported, she added bay leaves and peppercorns but there were no onions in it.  This is good for throwing into the crockpot and having something hot and tangy to eat when you come home, but it wasn't quite what I think of as truly authentic. Close, but no ceeeegar.

Very easy. My Filipino friend said it's not 100% authentic since it's not fried, but he said it was still delicious. I did add 2 bay leaves when cooking (remove before serving).

Slow Cooker Adobo Chicken Haiku: "Could've been better, had it not been overdone. Maybe marinade?" I used 4 large, bone-in chick breast, and the exact ingredients, and ratio of, but at 3 hrs., my chicken was well past cooked. The taste was still there, but the texture was a bit dry. I think if I make this again, I'll use the ingredients as a marinade on boneless breasts, and grill them instead, b/c I don't seem to have any luck w/ chicken crockpot recipes, unless it's a soup/chili where the chicken's already been cooked.

This was only ok. The chicken was too dry and the onions were still crunchy. We couldn't taste the garlic at all. Probably won't make this again.

I followed the recipe but my chicken came out bland and chewy.  I used the leftover juice to make the rice and that was flavorful but didn't quite make up for the chicken.

I love chicken adobo, I ate it a lot growing up on a navy base in Hawaii that had a lot of philipenos. I will say this is pretty authentic. I personally cut back on the vinegar for my boyfriends sake (he doesnt know athing about foreign food), but keep in mind thats how this is suppose to taste!

way too salty, even with low sodium soy sauce. I added a bit of brown sugar, which helped slightly. Not at all what I was hoping for.

4 stars made as is...delicious.  The second time I made it I changed it to my taste which was simply to use all dark meat (skinless), used about 3/4 cup vinegar, and 1/2 cup dry white wine.  I then added 2 TB cornstarch mixed with 3 TB cold water to thicken the sauce just a little.  I think the other variations suggested make for good dishes but get away from the basic essence of adobo chicken.

I've made this many times.  So wonderful!  Very comparable to the Chicken Adobo my friend's family made when we were growing up (they are Filipino).  Absolutely delicious.  I use white vinegar to cut down on the stink factor while cooking.

very bland chicken--the gravy was good on rice, that is the reason for the 3 stars.

My changes were: 2 bay leaves, equal 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar and soy sauce, 2 TBL brown sugar 3/4 tsp ginger, 5 cloves garlic, 1 onion and 1/2 cup broth water. Best part was the fall-off-the-bone tenderness, but the taste didn't appeal to us. Leftovers will be used in chicken salad instead.

This was pretty darn good!  I substituted 1/4 cup of water for soy sauce and added fresh mushrooms at the end.  Served it over wheat pasta, but totally could have done crusty bread for dipping :)

Very, very yummy.  Next time I will cut the soy sauce, howerver.  Tastes yummy but the amount of sodium in the dish is a bit unhealthy.  Will definitely make this again with some adjustments and creativity (I might add green onions and red peppers next time as well as reducing the sauce down a bit once the chicken is cooked thoroughly).

Made exactly as written.  It smelled great while cooking.  Both my husband and I thought the flavour was too vinegary.  Won't make again.

I really hacked this one but it turned out to be very good - we all liked it.  Used balsamic vinegar, yellow onion and chicken breasts.  Cooked 4 hours low.  I'll make this exact version again.

This was tasty! I liked it more than b-f did he thought it was plain but that could of been my fault. I didnt cut the chicken up bec I though it would dry out I just put it in whole. I used red wine vinegar and added basil and pepper. I cooked this on low for 4hrs and it was great very moist. Next time Im either going to chop chicken up near the end or thicken the sauce and add it on top. Onions were very good. Im gonna cook this every 3rd chicken I get.

I used only chicken thighs, omitted the onion, added three small bay leaves and a tablespoon of peppercorns.  It was very good; it came close to the adobo that my Filipino friends used to make for me, but the texture was slightly off (my husband commented that it was a bit too "mushy" for his liking).  Although I like the ease of the slow cooker, next time I will try a stove top recipe.  Also, be wary of the cooking time if your slow cooker tends to cook hot as mine does -- I think it was done after only four hours.

I keep thinking it must've been something I did, but I followed this recipe almost to the T and it tasted terrible. It tasted like overcooked chicken soaked in too much soy sauce for too long. I even used reduced sodium soy sauce and served it over steamed rice, and it was still way too salty to eat.

Really good chicken!!  I used another person's suggestion to use the 1/3 C. Red wine Vinegar and 1C. of Water instead of the regular vinegar.  DELICIOUS!!

This was a great recipe.  I used bonless chicken breasts, a nice balsalmic vinegar, and made a little extra sauce and served it over white rice.  My whole family liked it (and my 4 kids are picky)!  I think that next time I make it I will try to thicken the sauce a little.

This was super good. I used boneless chicken breast and added small diced potatoes, mushrooms, and a small amount of fresh lemon juice. We ate it over rice with a side of black beans. Wonderfully yummy. I will make this again and again.

I wasn't sure about this recipe, but tried it anyway.The flavors were good,I followed other recommendations of bay leaves and peppercorns.Served with brown rice with the "sauce". Maybe next time I'll leave in the crockpot for 6 hours, 8 was to long. Easy and simple ingredients. Thanks.

I really like this recipe.  Like others I do a few things differently.  I like equal parts vinegar and soy sauce and I also add a few bay leaves.  I addition I cook mine in the pressure cooker and it is so tender and delicious!

O.K. 1st off I followed some suggestions.  I used about half the vinegar & chicken breasts.  The result was just O.K. but I don't knock the recipe.  I've had this recipe before and no Filipina has ever served it to me as a chicken breast, usually chicken legs & thighs, so my mistake.  If you use chicken breasts I would suggest less vinegar, less soy sauce and plain unseasoned rice.  I ate mine with snow peas and potatoes and they staved off the saltiness (from the soy sauce) very well.  BTW,  I did use low sodium sauce.  I did like the taste, so I'll be trying it again.

This was very, very good.  I cooked it on low and set my slow cooker for eight hours but for some reason it didn't turn off when it was supposed to?  I'm not sure what happened...this is the second time I've used my slow cooker I just got it.  =X  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, as it was what I had on hand; I cut up about five of them.  I cut the onion up in pretty big chunks but they were almost completely dissolved by the the time I stopped cooking, and the chicken was very moist and practically falling apart.  The flavor was strong, and nice and tangy like I expected.  I served it over white rice.  Normally I get paranoid about cooking things too long but this was still perfect.  I hope the leftovers keep well.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was soooo good. I did alter the recipe quite a bit, I actually mixed this recipe and another one together, I mixed the onions with garlic pepper, fresh ground pepper, fresh garlic, 1/3 cup lite soy, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 3/4 cup water, fresh ginger, bay leaves, and slow cooked it with 10 chicken drumsticks. it was amazing!!! served it over jasmine rice. YUMMY I cant wait to eat the left overs for lunch today!!!

I really loved this recipe.  So simple but so much flavor!!  I used rice wine vinegar because that is what I had on hand and it was so yummy and moist.  Will make this again for sure.  Oh, we did have to add some chicken broth close to the end because it seemed to be drying up.

I made this for my family and we enjoyed it. My son (went back for seconds) and I loved it all, the sauce and chicken but my husband wasn't too keen on the sauce but really liked the chicken.  I added some brown sugar and ginger, and some cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit.  Served over white rice with a side salad.  It was great, I will be making this again.  Thanks!!

Followed recipe exactly....did not like...boring. tastes like chicken with soy sauce. it may be very authentic but it didn't taste good to me. UPDATE~diced the boring chicken and put it on a salad of romaine lettuce,roasted soy beans,sunflower seeds and used a low fat spicy Asian dressing~better but still boring....

I made this yesterday without reading reviews so I wouldn't change anything. I used boneless chicken breasts since that's all I had on hand. It turned out wonderful! I served it with steamed rice. It was a bit salty so may try less soy sauce, low sodium soy sauce or add some water. Thanks for sharing!

This was okay.  It was nice to have a new recipe for slow cooker chicken, but i'm not sure I'd make this again.  I didn't particularly care for the flavor.

This recipe had a good flavor but it was missing something.  I needed a kick.  In reading the reviews I noticed that some people threw in some ginger and a little sweetness.  Maybe that is what I should have done. I will give this 3 stars because I would make this again but I would have to add something to it.  I love the garlic,onion flavor mixed with the soy sauce but something is missing for my taste.  Also,  you may want to use dark meat because the breast will dry out.  I just used a whole chicken.  I did not cut it up and it still came out very good with meat falling off of the bone.  I may make this again one day but no time soon.

I was so excited about this recipe.  I have two friends who are Filipino and I grew up eating this with them.  It just didn't live up to it though.  Even my dad who was in town and eats EVERYTHING said it wasn't that good.  I don't know who will eat the leftovers.  I used white vinegar, and did everything else, but the taste just didn't work for us.  I will not make this again.

Great recipe!  I followed it exactly and served with steamed short grain rice.  My whole family liked it and my kids especially liked the sauce on rice (they are 2 1/2 and 1 1/2)  Thanks for the recipe!

the first few bites were great, but it is SO salty that my husband and i couldn't even finish it! (which never happens). the chicken was nice and tender, but WAY too salty. maybe cut down on the soy sauce.

Really good! I think I will use boneless/skinless chicken next time; the meat and skin/fat fell right off the bone, and was kinda to dig out before eating. Otherwise...delicious!

This was really easy and really good. I was a little hesitant about vinegar and soy sauce. But I used 2 onions, apple cider vinegar and the full measurements of soy sauce(despite reviews) and this was soooo good. The whole family had seconds and thirds. The flavor was sweet slightly tangy and not salty at all. Will defiantly put this in the regular rotation. Thank you!

Great just as the recipe is written.  Everyone in the family loved it... especially served with the gravy over rice.  All the plates were clean at the end of the meal and that is a rare success!!  Great EASY recipe!  Thanks!

I didn't care for this recipe. I used low sodium soy sauce and it was still too salty for my taste. The other flavors were a little "off" for me. Maybe it was the red wine vinegar. Thanks for sharing anyway.

Made this recipe last night. No one really liked it. It didn't have any flavor and the chicken was dry. I followed other readers' suggestions about the bay leaves and that didn't help it. The chicken was in a broth that wasn't good on rice either. Won't make this one again.

SO EASY!  My husband who is NOT fond of chicken actually asked when I was going to make it again.  My daughter & Son-in-Law love it.  I use Rice Vinegar and that's the only change I make then serve with yellow rice.  Keep looking for leftovers - there AREN'T any!

This was excellent and so easy! I couldn't stop eating it. I used cornstarch to thicken up the broth left in the crock pot and ate it over rice. YUMMY:)  and next time I think I'll see how this recipe does on just chicken breasts. Thanks. Mmmm

Sorry...I guess I don't like Adobo because this was not good at all or just not to my taste.  I did add the brown sugar as many suggested but that's the only modification I made.  I've never tried Adobo so don't know if this is how it should taste like but defintely won't make again.  My husband also didn't like it. 

Thanks anyway

This was DELICIOUS! I thought it tasted just like what adobo should. I made a few modifications to the recipe, mainly due to other reviewer suggestions and because my mother, who is Filipino, would use much of the same: I added 1/2 cup of water, 1/3 cup light brown sugar, 2 bay leaves, about 1/4 teaspoon of whole peppercorns and red wine vinegar in place of regular vinegar. I used a whole chicken, cut into pieces, left the skin on, cooked it on low for about 8 hours and thought it came out perfect. I served it over hot steamed white rice and am looking forward to having leftovers! Thanks!

For this recipe, I used bone in chicken breast, and I removed the skin and the ribs before cooking. About an hour before it was done, I removed the rest of the bones, and shredded the meat back into the slow cooker. As others did, I used low sodium soy sauce. I also used apple cider vinegar and added potatoes and carrots and a smidge of ginger. It smelled heavenly, and I got about five large meals out of it, served over rice. I thought it was fantastic! My boyfriend, however doesn't have my palate, and while he finished his meal, he didn't care for it so much. I may try again with fewer potatoes (I used about 5 medium) and with a different type of vinegar or I may add some wine. The great part about this dish is that one can play around with the ingredients to find the best flavor for themselves.

EDIT: I've tried again, this time skipping the potatoes and carrot altogether. I used a combo of rice, white, apple cider and balsamic vinegar,  low sodium soy sauce, about 3 oz Pinot Grigio, enough water to cover my two giant bone-in chicken breasts (prepared the same as before - skin off, bone out), about a tablespoon of brown sugar and about a teaspoon of ginger. Lovely and TASTY!!!

I'm sorry, but this did not turn out well for us.  Every bit of the chicken tasted so strong!  I don't know if it was the vinegar or if I should have used low-sodium soy sauce, as others had suggested.  My husband and kids barely ate theirs, and I only ate the chicken pieces without pouring any more of the sauce over my rice.  It WAS very tender.  I just wish my tastebuds could have tolerated the flavor!

Delicious recipe Adrienne! I used bone in breasts, low sodium soy sauce, a can of crushed pineapple in its natural juice and during the last half hour of cooking I threw in broccoli and yellow bell peppers to help make a more complete meal. I shredded the chicken and tossed the whole thing together with Ramen noodles. Family loved it and thank you too!

This was a very easy and tasty recipe for chicken.  I served it with mashed potatoes instead of rice, and the chicken "gravy" flavored them wonderfully.  Will definitely serve this one again.

This is a great recipe. It's almost as good as my dad's (he's filipino). For those of you who find it salty, add some quartered potatoes. They will absorb some of the saltiness.....that's the way my dad makes it. And it's great.

Even though my family thought the chicken tasted okay, it really stinks up your house while cooking and doesn't look very appetizing either. Probably won't make it again.

Looks good! I'll have to try it -- it's close to my recipe for regularly cooked adobo. (I'm Filipino.) If you like an island kick, add some pineapple and pineapple juice. It'll take away some of the saltiness. And yes, it's supposed to be watery. Another suggestion: can also be made with pork or a mix of chicken & pork.

This turned out really good and not too salty.  Used 3 bone-in breasts and 6 thighs.  The chicken turned out very tender and flavorful.  Served this with a salad and fried cabbage.  Thanks a bunch!

This is one of our favorite meals. The brand of soy sauce makes a big difference - I use Kikkoman. Instead of a whole chicken, we prefer chicken pieces (we've tried it with different parts and like skinless thighs the best) I marinate the chicken in the sauce for 24 - 48 hours before transferring the whole thing to the slow cooker and cooking for 6 hours. Adding pepper or peppercorns add to the flavor. We don't find this too salty at all, the meat is moist and very flavorful and the sauce tastes great on plain white rice.

we were split on this. My husband and daughter loved it. My son and I weren't impressed. If you like Chinese food, heavy soy sauce/sodium flavor you will love it. It was very simple to make though.

Overall this was a good base recipe.  I'm Filipino and "adobo" is a dish quite common in our culture.  I would recommend using chicken wings and drummettes to make cooking and prepping easier.  Also, you could use the same recipe over the stove and depending on your preference, you could leave it with some sauce to go with your rice, or continue cooking until the sauce has caramelized along with the onions.  For leftovers, you could also fry the chicken in a bit of oil and serve with garlic fried rice.

This a great chicken recipe.  Very flavorful, and yummy when shredded and put on a roll!  I didn't cut any vinegar or soy sauce, but omitted the onion, and added a bit of poultry seasoning.

The sauce that this makes is very tasty, but I found the chicken to be rather greasy and mushy cooking this way.  It wasn't bad, but I'll probably try something else next time.

My mother-in-law, who is Filipino, always uses coconut milk in her Chicken Adobo, so we added 1 can of Coconut Milk the last hour of cooking.  She liked this version of Adobo so much, she asked for the recipe.  We also cut down on the amount of time cooked so the meat doesn't fall of the bone so much.

Wow! I love this site! 3 for 3 successes so far. The adobo was soooo good. My 8 year old son who normally never eats anything like this was asking for more! The changes I made to the recipe were 4lbs of chicken (thighs and legs), 3 bay leaves, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 20 or so whole peppercorns. The last 3 mods I got from someone else’s review. Thanks!

My husband is Filipino and we make adobo often - this was a great recipe, the meat was very tender and the flavor was excellent. We added three bay leaves, used white vinegar and cooked it for 5 hours on low. I like adobo sweet, so next time I will add three tablespoons of brown sugar.

I read the reviews and many had complaints about too much vinegar and/or switching to rice vinegar. I did use rice vinegar and cut it in half. There was no unpleasant smell while it was cooking  and no overpowering tasste so next time I will use the amount of (rice) vinegar that the recipe calls for. First time having adobo chicken and it was enjoyable.  I thought with alll that garlic it would be too strong but it wasn't. I thought us Italians were the only one's who used lots of garlic.  LOL

Due to time constraints and recommendations of other reviewers, I used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic and omitted onion. I added 3 bay leaves and used a large tray of fresh chicken thighs, skin on.  Used soy sauce, apple cider vinegar in amounts listed in recipe. Low for 8 hours. I was so skeptical of this dish but WOW. Chicken is delicious, not pungent or sour. I'm posting a picture of a lone bone, all that was left after I took a piece from the cooker for a "taste". Even skin was delicious.

I love Adobe.  My Mom used to make it when I was growing up.  This is a great base.  I added bay leaves, a little cayenne pepper, and more garlic.  I added equal parts soy and vinegar.  I like using rice vinegar the best.  I also added a cup of chicken stock.  I like it a bit more tangy so I did wind up adding a little more vinegar.  Instead of rice my Mom used cellophane noodles.  Really yummy.

I only had red wine, so I used JC Perez's sauce mix.  YUM!  My whole family loved it.  I froze the chicken pieces before  placing in the slow cooker (even the dark meat) and also browned them after they were cooked.  I've never done that before, but the video suggested it, so I did and it was great!

This was fine. Nothing to write home about. It just tasted like soy sauce to me, though the chicken was super tender.

AWESOME! I blended the ingredients in the food processor and cooked on low for 7 hours. Served with jasmine rice and baked carrots (tossed in olive oil, salt, and pepper - baked at 350 for 25 min).  I did this with all thighs and it turned out great!

This is a super tasty, low fat & low carb dish! As usual, I found I didn't need to cook as long as the recipe stated.  I cooked for two hours on high, then about 1.5 hours on low.  The chicken was cooked through, yet tender and juicy.  I served with rice and steamed carrots.

I think the low sodium soy sauce is a mistake...I found this a little bland and felt like I wanted to add salt. Would try again with regular soy sauce.

We enjoyed this recipe....it was quite tasty.  I made almost exactly as written except I did use a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.  Served over rice and the boys both ate it up!  I appreciated the ease of throwing these ingredients into a slow cooker.  Next time I will add a bay leaf and some peppercorns, like others have suggested, to see if that will amp this up to a 5-star rating.

I used 3 lb of Costco chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand. I added 2 Bay leaves but used the other ingredients in the proportions indicated. I shredded the chicken breasts and served over Basmati rice. Instead of carrots I served watermelon on the side. The sweetness was a great contrast to the tang of the chicken.

I did not use low sodium soy sauce and it was not too salty. Tasted excellent, served over rice.  (also did not have a whole chicken so used 3 lbs. of boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Perfect, easy meal.

I've prepared this several times and it always turns out well.  My family members like it.  I use low sodium soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce, but everything else the same.  I'll also add a bay leaf next time.

Very good, but made the mistake of using "chicken for baking and frying" which happened to be on sale and contained many tiny bones. Avoid tiny bones at all costs. I didn't find it to be overly pungent. The only change I made was to add a few peppercorns per other user recommendations, didn't have any bay leaves to add at the time, but that sounds like a great idea too.

I took advice from other reviewers and now know where I would change it next time. Definitely need 2 bay leaves, don't need sugar but if you do make it no more than 1 Tablespoon. I used 1/2 cup soy and 1/2 cup white vinegar and didn't feel it had any strong vinegar taste. Here's the big thing though...I cooked mine on low for 5 hours and it was falling apart and the breasts were dried out. That ruined it for me. I'd rather have juicy, moist chicken and I think that's really how this should have been. Anyway, it opens the door on Adobo for me and I'm willing to try again!

We didn't care for this recipe at all.  I added some ginger as suggested by another reviewer and a couple Thai chili peppers for a extra little heat but it was still very blah.  I will not make this again.

This is definitely a great starting point for adobo but has to be tweaked a little to make it taste much more flavorful.  I lowered my soy sauce to 1/2 cup and used 1/3 cup of rice vinegar and added whole black peppercorn, more garlic, bay leaves, minced ginger, and a tea spoon of brown sugar.  It tasted more refined when I tweaked it and definitely don't use JUST skinless chicken breasts like I did.  The fat from the chicken adds more depth to the flavor and juiciness otherwise the chicken just comes up fairly dry.  I'm trying Pork Adobo next time as I love pork adobo more than chicken :P.

I never cooked chicken adobe in a slow cooker before.  I added whole dried bay leaves & onions - like I use when preparing on the stove.  With back to school and football - I have less time in the evening to prepare meals.  I am so glad that I could provide one of my family favorites using my slow cooker.  The chicken over fresh steamed rice with steamed spinach is a perfect meal.  Thank you!

Very easy recipe and the house smells AMAZING. But there isn't a lot of flavor and the white meat on the chicken still came up very dry even though it looks moist.

Really good!  I doubled the sauce and added some corn starch to thicken it up.  Also I added about 15 peppercorns and 3 bay leaves.  It was delicious!

Based on some of the other posts, we decreased the amount of soy sauce and vinegar down to 1/2 cup each.  Next time, we would use the amount that the recipe calls for - it could have been a little more salty.  We used about a 1/2 cup of brown sugar to eliminate any "bitter" taste, and this gave it a nice taste.  We used red wine vinegar, at the recommendation of other posts.  We also used all breasts, and found that they were a little dry.  Next time, We would use thighs next time to have juicier portions.  All in all, it's a good recipe that you can enjoy over rice, quinoa, and even cooked carrots or potatoes.

The closest recipe to Micronesian food.  Use the sauce to marinate and baste food as you grill it.  It is delicious!

This was really delicious! Tasted quite like the chicken adobo I get at the local Filipino joint. I used a whole chicken and extra chicken breasts and they bother worked great! Made a delicious smell for the house as well!

My family did not care for this recipe at all.  On the plus side, the chicken was very tender.  It had a very strong smell, and we just didn't like the way it tasted.  I'm from Guam and use soy sauce and vinegar in much of my cooking and marinating.

This was quite good.  I've made other versions of Adoo Chicken and like the searing of the chicken first prior to cooking in the sauce better then just putting it in raw.  Otherwise a keeper.  I added coco milk, peppercorns, and bay leaves like others who've commented.    My family ate it up and the house smelled great.  Love the slow cooker!

While this cooked, I thought SURELY it can't taste as bad as it smells.  Well.  I was wrong.  I love Filipino food - adobo chicken is a favorite.  This wasn't it.  Had to throw it away.  Used white vinegar and boneless skinless chicken breasts.

I lived in California for awhile and fell in love with Filipino food. I had a similar type of chicken while living there and loved it. I found this recipe and made this for my daughter and I (she is VERY picky) and she gobbled this up. Its definitely a fav in my recipe box. I also e-mailed it to friends. Thanks ?

The picture looked appetizing enough so I thought I'd give it a try...I couldn't eat it. The vinegar and soy sauce was overwhelming, and the onion was an odd addition that simply didn't work. I will keep searching for a good slow-cooker chicken recipe because this wasn't it.

I followed this recipe as written. When finished cooking and I tasted it, I threw away the liquid and soaked the chicken in water to remove as much of the flavor as possible. Wanting to salvage the chicken, I smothered the skinless thighs in tangy BBQ sauce and baked it in the oven for 15 minutes. The flavor from the original recipe still permeated the meat. I did not care for this recipe at all.

I followed one of the reviewers suggestions on this meal and did not use the onion or the sugar and used the white vinegar instead of the apple vinegar and it was awesome also fried some cabbage to go with on top of some rice and it was a hit for my family...I will use this recipe again.

Too salty for me.I have to say it was easy.Putting sugar is not an option,because it is supposed to be tangy in taste probably next time I will cut down the soy sauce in half and add some water/chicken broth.

A very good authentic recipe, my Filipino hubby really liked it.  And I love the fact that you get so much flavor from so few ingredients (and stuff you mostly have on hand anyway!)  I agree that you should NOT add sugar, if you want something sweeter look for a teriyaki recipe.

I agree with the previous reviewer. This had the starts of a flavorful adobo, but wasn't as strong as the real kind should be. It was tastey nonetheless. Next time I might try a different adobo recipe.

It was definitely easy.  I think I cooked the chicken too long because it was a little dry so do not overcook.  I thought this was good, but not "The Best".

We have now made this recipe several times and really enjoy it. It reminds my husband of his childhood. We just make sure to put the peppercorns into a tea bag so they are easy to take out and we always use applecider vinegar.

Although I enjoyed this simple and flavourful recipe, my partner voted it "an every six months" recipe.  I'd suggest elevating the chicken pieces slightly if you have alot of liquid for a more subtle taste.  Used the leftovers to make a great and super tasty chicken salad.  Call me crazy but I thought the house smelled delicious and I used a 50/50 ratio of white vinegar to organic cider vinegar.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this turned out awful! I packaged this up in a freezer bag and then thawed and put in my slow cooker... cooked on low for just shy of 8 hours and the chicken tasted like salty saw dust.  There was no redeeming this one by turning it into something else.  I had to toss the whole thing.  Will not be trying this one again.

have to say i didn't care for the taste of this recipe.  I found the soya sauce made it VERY salty.  If i were to make it again, I would definately use a low salt soya sauce.

Quite delicious. I lost my original adobo chicken recipe given by a Filippino friend. This one is almost exact in flavor, yet easier to cook in the crock pot. I will use this again.

This recipe is good.  I added whole peppercorns and a bay leaf.  I served it with plain white rice with fresh tomatoes (add a pinch of S&P) on the side.  I still prefer cooking adobo on the stove top.  But will definetly make this again especially if I want a hot dinner waiting for me when I get home.

I love this recipe!  I use chicken breast instead of the whole chicken.  I prefer to substitute the soy sauce with teryaki sauce but it is really good either way.  I have made this several times and everytime I make it for company they ask for the recipe.  I had a friend over recently for dinner and she loved it so much that she asked for the recipe and made it for her family the next day.

Amazing! Use the white vinegar! You can tweak it as you want but start off with this and after cooked, go from there. It tenderizes the chicken so well. Also- there was hardly any smell in my tiny 650 sq ft apartment, I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about! I followed it to the T, with store brand products, and it is amazing. Served over white rice!

This recipe was okay but didn't knock my socks off as I had expected it to after reading the reviews.  I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken because of my family's preferences and added bay leaf and peppercorns as suggested.  Will make again in the future and try playing with it some more.

Easiest recipe ever! I often turn this on around 10pm, and leave it going on low all night/next day, and eat for dinner around 7pm the next day. Found that dark soya sauce works better than light soya sauce. Great on egg noodles, or rice.

Minus onion, plus bay leaf, this recipe is a keeper.  But I will cut the cooking time next time - 6 hours in the crock pot was about an hour too long.

This is great but we always add; 1 tbsp brown sugar, black pepper corns or fresh ground/cracked pepper, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 tsp red pepper flake and some fresh ginger. I also like to season with salt and pepper and brown my chicken in a little garlic infused olive oil first...

My entire family loved this and I have made it twice in one week.  Few changes: I browned my chicken pieces first just because they look better this way, used low sodium soy, added a chopped onion and potato. Since I browned the chicken first, I only cooked on low for 4-5 hours. Incredible dish that reheats well if there is any leftover.

Good recipe.  Only had boneless, skinless breasts so that is what I used.  Used a little less soy and added about 1 1/2 Tbls of brown sugar.  Hubby and 2 young boys enjoyed as well.

This recipe was phenominal!! Each bite was an explosion of flavor. The chicken was so tender. I served this with mashed potatoes and I pan seared green beans with a little of the Adobo Chicken broth. I've referenced this site for years and this is the first recipe I've commented on. All of my dinner guests and I thank you for this recipe!!! I will continue making this for a lifetime!

This is good, but I recommend using a thermometer to cook the chicken just right- otherwise I find 6-8hours too long and dries out the chicken.  I also recommend using low sodium soy sauce.

Yes, the soy sauce is too much!  I used 1/2c. instead and it was plenty salty.  I used chicken breasts (4 lb. bag) and cooked it for 6 hours.  It was good, but dry.  I served it with long grain brown rice and sauted zuchinni (not seasoned because the chicken was soo saltly) and it was a nice blend.

This was pretty good but not my absolute favorite. I would recommend boneless, skinless chicken breasts if you're going to try it. Thicker, more substantial pieces of chicken seem to work better so you're not fishing around in the pot for the meat. I made this in the crock pot.

I made this with a few modifications from looking at other adobo recipes and it turned out wonderful.  I added a couple tablespoons of chopped ginger, two bay leaves and fresh ground pepper.  If I had peppercorns I would have used them.  The meat fell off the bone.

good, I think I might take down the soy sauce and add some hot spice of some sort - knowing that it will be less adobo then.

This is a very good recipe. I add chicken broth and make sure the chicken is completely covered and it falls off the bone every time.

Too salty and too dry... If I were to try this dish again I would half the amount of soy sauce (or double the amount of vinegar) and adjust the cooking time by a couple of hours.  I am a person that puts salt on everything and I can't believe how salty this dish is!!  It was overwelming and I could not finish my plate.

I never taste adobo chicken so I wasn't sure what I was expecting.  It was too salty and overcook for my taste.

I read all the reviews before cooking. The only things I did differently was I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and white vinegar. The dish was a hit. Both husband and grown son loved it. Hubby said he would eat it again.! Since there were no left overs, next time I'll double the recipe!! I served this over brown rice.

Easy! Delicious! The only modification I make to this is I don't even bother to cut up the chicken. Otherwise, I make this exactly as written and we love it.

The soy sauce mixture was too strong for us,we could`nt even finish the meal.I have many Filipino friends and I know adobo does not get sugar or onion.Because my family and I love adobo I`m going to try it with less soy sauce and vinegar.Also add some
water.I did add peppercorns though. think some more garlic would be good.

I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and used regular vinegar, garlic, and soy sauce.  It cooked for almost 9hrs and came out way too salty but with rice it was fantastic. Next time I wont cook it as long and cut down on the soy sauce. Great recipe, simple, easy, will make again!!

This recipe was so easy! My Husband is Filipino and taught me to make Filipino Adobo and this is almost as good. But it's easiness scored it 5 stars! It sure beats the long method! I used Boneless Skinless Chicken thighs. I also added water to it. We like ours soupy. Wonderful alternative!
Update~ I have madethis several times since...and it's awesome! My Filipino husband gives it a thumbs up! I've been using chicken legs. So easy!!

I really enjoyed how tender the chicken was but my husband thought it was alittle bland and to watery( maybe i'll use some cornstarch to thicken the juice).  We'll make it again but I will just doctor it up some more with other spices.  I used red wine vinegar as well and let soy sauce as recomended.

This recipe was ok, not a keeper.  It didn't taste like real Chicken Adobo.  It was ok to eat but did not taste like it should.  I'm going to keep looking because this one is not it.

Not bad for a first attempt (but not great either.)  I will definately try this again with some changes.  My husband and I found this WAY to strong (and we both love salty/big flavor foods.)  So I will add some water the next time and maybe try a different vinegar.  I might also, try to thicken up the sauce a little bit as well.

This is soooooo good. My sister in law is from the phillipines and makes this  when she is visiting us. This recipe is just as good as hers. Now I can have it whenever I want and it's sooooo easy! By the way, I added carrots and potatos to mine and served with rice.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  The meat was very tender, but my family didn't really enjoy the taste.  This is a different type of flavor than we are used to.  I think that it would taste a lot better by adding enough sugar to give it a sweet flavor.  I won't make this recipe again.

This dish is too salty. Next time I'll use reduced sodium soy sauce. I think the soy and vinegar may work better with beef instead of chicken. I thickend the sauce with corn starch and served over rice.

I followed several of the recommendations - used red wine vinegar, and brown sugar. I was still disappointed. I guess I should have listened to everyone who used chicken breasts and got dry results. Obviously, this receipe should NOT be made with breasts... mine were dry, too (6 hours on low and turned half way through). Also, at first the flavor was good, but after several bites it was too much (the vinegar, I think - and we like vinegar). Hubby said don't make again. Sorry...

This was very good and  so simple... almost too good to be true.  I listen to the other reviewers and added the brown sugar.  I will make again.  Only comment is that because of the soy sauce it is salty, I like it that way, but if you are concerned about sodium maybe try the lite soy sauce

If you're looking for a traditional adobo, this isn't it.  BUT!! Given the great flavor that's pretty close to traditional and it's simplicity... you can't go wrong!  I will be making this again and again :)

** I did follow the suggestion one other person and used 1/2 c. soy sauce and 1/4 c. red wine vinegar and the 1/2 1/2 c. white vinegar.  Surprisingly, it was just the right amount!

Great way to cook bone-in chicken breasts! I used 2/3 c low sodium soy sauce & 1/4 water, 1/2 white onion instead of yellow onion.  Will cook with some veggies and will place chicken meat side down to prevent drying out.

Our all time favorite!  I do incorporate some  suggestions of others (listed below).  The only thing to watch for is overcooking.  It will become rather dry.  Still completely edible, though!  Yummy.

Extremely easy and very delicious.  But the best part was chilling the leftovers and creating an outstanding chicken salad by simply adding apples, walnuts and mayo.

I had a 5# whole chicken that I skinned and cut up for this so had to tinker with the ingredient proportions.  I used balsamic vinegar for some sweetness and as other reviewers suggested, peppercorns, brown sugar, and cut back on the soy sauce.  I added a couple of green peppers and a heaping teaspoon of thai red curry paste just for some zing, as well as 2 bay leaves.  I have to say that when I mixed up the ingredients I was not impressed with the taste, but after it finished in the crockpot and sat there for a few hours, I really like the flavor.  I also like the fact that the ingredients are cheap, those that I keep on hand, and fat-free; no heavy oils.  The chicken was incredibly moist even the breasts (and I had deskinned the whole chicken)  Will keep this in my box to make when I don't feel like fussing but want a hearty tasting chicken.

Quite a nice, easy chicken dish to start before running errands or going to work.  The vinegar balances the dish.  The onions have nice flavor too.

GREAT recipe, Adrienne.  I did follow others' suggestions, adding the peppercorns, bayleaf, some chicken broth and white wine, and used a mix of red wine/balsamic vinegar.  I didn't have fresh ginger, but had fish sauce with ginger (minced chunks of it), so added some of that.  Tossed in some Vietnamese basil and a wedge of lime at the end for extra flavor.  Easy and tasty!

I LOVE this recipe!  Substitute for 3/4 c. coy sauce with 1/4c. soy sauce and 2/4 c. teriyaki sauce.  Sub only 1/4 c. seasoned rice vinegar, add 2T brown sugar and 3/4c. water.  I always use chicken breast since we like th white meat.  Ends up a tad dry, but still tasty.  I serve over jasmine rice...mmmm...

I will definitely make this again, but it only gets 4 stars b/c it needs some tweaks...

I followed the recommendation of the other reviewers (bay leaf, brown sugar, peppercorns, red wine vinegar), but cooked it for 12 hrs on low (I commute over an hour each way to work).  Next time I will use chicken breasts with the bone (I used boneless skinless, and only 2 large breasts), and either add more water or reduce the amount of soy sauce.  Although the chicken turned out very tender, it was a little dry from cooking so long.  Hopefully by using chicken on the bone, and reducing the soy sauce, it will be great.  My fiance thought it was good, I thought it was quite salty...

I also want to put veggies in it, but what type would go well?  Maybe carrots, potatoes, or chayote.

I thought this was a great recipe, too, although I made the same modifications previous reviewers made (with the bay leaf, brown sugar and peppercorns).  Also, instead of using bone-in chicken I used boneless and skinless breasts and thighs and reduced the cooking time to 1 hour high, 6 hours low and it came out wonderfully.  My husband, who is Filipino, loved it, as did my non-Filipino family.  The best compliment was from my brother-in-law, who grew up in the Philippines and said that it tasted very much like it was made there.

This is a four-star recipe as is, a five-star with the modifications.  A definite keeper -- in fact, I'm going to be making it again next weekend when my in-laws are over.

I did not find this recipe too salty.  I did add part soy sauce & part water as other's had suggested.  The meat was very moist and fell off the bone.  I added yellow squash & zuccini a 1/2 hour before it was done (in addition to the onions).  The extra veggies made the dish look more appealing and added to the meal.  I will make this again.  Thanks Adrienne!

Not too bad but I would definitely recommend low-sodium soy sauce.  I like salty foods but this was really salty.  With that adjustment, I will make this recipe again.

Wasn't real thrilled with this one. Used the low sodium soy sauce and still thought it was too salty but then I don't cook with much salt anyway.

Hubby got to make this one before he left for work one morning, and it came out just fine!  Chicken was fall apart tender, so it was hard to grab a serving's worth and bones sorta just fell in with the meat as you served, sometimes making them hard to find.  We were afraid the vinegar would be overpowering, but an unfounded concern.  Will make again, thanks!

The flavor was ok, would have liked it to be a little stronger.  The chicken was very dry though.  Not sure why.  I will make it again but probably add a few ingredients.

Not bad! Made exactly as stated, but due to a long work day the chicken remained in the crock pot for 11 hours, so the meat and bones seperated making it difficult to utilize the sauce for gravy. Since overcooking was my bad, I'll make this again using boneless chicken! Even without the overcooking, I'm not sure this would have rated 5 stars in my family, but still, it was a nice dish and good for a change of pace!

This is the best chicken slow cooker recipe!  The flavor is to die for, it smells amazing, and is incredibly easy.  I've made this several times (a real winner to impress company!).  I put the chicken in whole without cutting it up, and it falls off the bones by the time it's done cooking.  AWESOME!  Great with a side of rice and steamed veggies - a  healthy dinner.  Thanks!

Fantastic!  My boyfriend's family is Filipino and this is so close to his Mother's recipe...(Better in my opinion!) I added the brown sugar and ginger as another person mentioned.  That way, it cuts some of the salty flavor. For those of you who complained about the smell and said you had to throw the whole chicken away - You either did something wrong, or you just don't like ADOBO chicken!

This unusual dish is not for everyone.  It stunk to high heaven and was not a pretty sight when it was done, falling off the bone.  It was moist and tender, though, and I really liked it.  As usual, I use low sodium tamari soy sauce.

Definitely easy and very good.  But be careful, if you cook it too long it does get REALLY dried out (I overcooked it, but it still tasted great).

Quick & easy, I love it!!  I did cut the recipe in 1/2 since there are only 2 of us & 2 picky kids.  I used 2 packs of noodles, but just 1 seasoning packet per others advice.  I did add a little water at the end, it was very thick.  LOVE IT!

Added brown sugar, ginger, cut the soy sauce, as some others advised, added mushrooms and served over rice for a little variety.  Tastes better if the chicken is shredded towards the end.  My DH liked it ok, but we agreed that this was missing something.  Will maybe make again.

This was a hit with my husband, my 7 year old son and myself.  I added a tablespoon of sugar to the sauce and thickened it with some corn starch. I served it over pasta instead of rice.

This did not have a whole lot of flavor to it, in my opinion.  I didn't think it was very good, however, my boyfriend and neighbor both enjoyed it a great deal.  To each his own, I guess!  It was certainly easy to make in my crock pot--worth a try to see if you like it.

I tried this because I needed to have dinner done when I got home from work. The house smelled wonderful, the chicken literally fell off the bone and had a very good flavor. Will do again.

This recipe was very easy.  The kids had two servings, and my boyfriend three.  
It was a little dry - but if you poured the sauce left over on rice it was much improved.
I skinned the chicken so that it wouldn't be greasy - it worked great.

I must have done something wrong - my husband and I didn't think that this was very good at all. And we really love just about any type of chicken.
I did use light soy instead of regular.

I'm a vegitarian but my husband is not so I'm always looking for quick and delicious recipes.  Let me tell you that the smell of this dish even tempted me. I was hoping for left overs so that I wouldn't have to cook the next day, but my husband liked it so much that there was only enough for a snack.

OFF THE HOOK.  Use Jasmine Rice and make sure to have extra sauce.....cuz it’s great mixed with the rice.  But you don’t want it doing the back stroke in the sauce either.  Boy oh boy was it good.

This still is my Go To bone in chicken recipe after all these years.  I'm pleased it has survived the test of Internet time! 

Please, by all means use white or rice vinegar with this recipe!  The first time I tried this dish without a recipe was with apple cider, so I didn't know the difference, however I appreciate the dish all that much more!

It is a go-to  for bone-in thighs while on Keto!

I followed the advice of the most helpful reviewer.  Added a couple bay leaves and pepper.  I left the onion in, as we love onion.  Also, on the advice I used white vinegar.  Easy and delicious, served with Spanish rice and steamed broccoli.

Excellent recipe, great fusion of flavors and really tangy, great over white rice! The only changes is I made was add 1 Tbs of brown sugar like other reviewers suggested and instead of 3 lbs whole chicken, I used 1.5 lbs of chicken thighs and the other 1.5 lb were baby carrots & potato’s (I prefer the potato versions because they really soak up the sauce!).

Kids and hubby liked it.  Unlike some other reviewers, I did not think the smell was bad while cooking.  My daughter actually came home from school and said the house smelled good.  Used 4 leg quarters, apple cider vinegar, bay leaves, and coarse pepper.

This was an easy slow cooker recipe—-a nice change of flavor profile!  We really liked  the tanginess and the chicken was falling-apart tender. NOTE:  the video adds 2 bay leaves, but they are not mentioned in the recipe. I added 3 leaves, and will use 4 next time, because we couldn’t really taste them. Also, the video served it over rice with spring onion leaf slices. This made a nice color and flavor addition to the rice.

On my second batch right now!  Only additions was pepper,  bay leaves and a bit of both onion and garlic powder, just to help intensify the flavor. 
 I wanted to drink the broth it was so good.  Just make sure once it is done around the 6 hour mark on low, take it out of the croak if not eating right away.  I turned my off and let sit 2 hours or so until I was ready to serve it and it did dry out a bit compared to when I tasted it at the point I shut the croak off.  Either way it was so good!

I made some "upgrades": 
1. added 2 kinds of vinegar - 1/2  quantity regular & 1/2 quantity  apple vinegar.
2. added  2 tbs. of semi dry wine.
3. added 2 sliced carrots, 1 big zuccini, 2 teaspoon sweet paprika, 1/2 teaspoon hot paprika. 
4. Cooked the first 2 hours at high (!!!) temp. - to  terminate salmonella  risk.

This is great! I used 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tsp fresh grated ginger, 1 tsp garlic powder (salt free), 1/2 red onion, 1/8 c red wine vinegar, 3 bay leaves, 1/2 c. chicken broth and 1/2 c water, 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce. I actually doubled all this so I'd have twice as much sauce mixture. Wonderful!

I used a pork shoulder roast instead of chicken. I browned the roast before putting it in the crock pot. I also doubled the soy sauce and vinegar so I had enough liquid to almost cover the roast. Cooked on low for about 7 hours and the roast fell apart as I was taking it out of the crock pot. It turned out pretty good except it was a little salty, probably because I used regular soy sauce instead of the low sodium version.

This was delicious! I used red wine vinegar and added broccoli and mushrooms. I added the broccoli about an hour before the time was up to keep it from getting overdone. I used whole baby Bella mushrooms which held up well. This is a great meal and so easy!!

Even after following other reviewers' suggestions of adding fresh garlic, bay leaves, a spoon of honey and peppercorns, and diluting with about 1/2c water, I didn't see that this was anything special.  It was still way too vinegar-y.  The chicken was tender, but the sauce was not to my liking, and the color of the chicken was a bit off-putting.  Probably will not make again.

This tasted almost like the adobo my friend from the Philippines made me. I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I made it I added more sugar than vinegar.

3.5 Stars for this recipe. It was okay and perhaps worth making again. It didn't taste like authentic Adobo I've had in the past, but it was fine. I reduced the sodium called for in the recipe, but I still found it to be rather salty.

Some improvements that first-timers may want to note:

1.  Add some peppercorn or ground black pepper to it.  

2.  Definitely use reduced sodium soy sauce.  I used regular soy sauce and it was far too salty!!!  I tried to balance the taste out with water and a lot of brown sugar :(  and it turned out well.  But I did not feel healthy eating with the gravy at all.

3.  Add cornstarch to thicken it at the end.

4.  Add mushrooms or vegetables, if you'd like.

I added some veggies (mushrooms and red peppers) and would in future maybe add carrots.  I also thickened the sauce at the end using corn starch - nice dish!

I wasn't sure if my picky eaters would like this .... but I was wrong.  It was a huge hit! I substituted apple cider vinegar for white vinegar and used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. I served with mashed golden potatoes, skins included, and roasted broccoli, cauliflower, and yellow squash. This will definitely become a staple in our household.

Fantastic. I used a large package of chicken thighs for mine, and as with any meat in a crock pot, it fell off the bone. Husband is demanding that this be added to our regular meal list! 

After reading through some comments, I did make the following additions: roughly a couple of teaspoons of ginger, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and a tbsp of brown sugar. 

Thank you for the recipe!

We were divided on this one. One of my sons and I thought this was pretty good, but the hubby and other son didn't really like it. I used thighs and did add ginger and a little brown sugar to it. I probably won't make it again, but am glad I tried it.  Thanks!

This had way too much vinegar and soy sauce, and was missing some other flavor component that I couldn't put my finger on. The sour/tangy/salty flavors were overpowering (and those are all flavors I like). And somehow the chicken was falling apart, but still kind of dry/tough - I don't know how that happens. I won't be using this recipe again.

I used regular onions and apple cider vinegar. If I use breast I shred. Other wise I prefer thighs!! If cooking a full 8 hours use frozen chicken to prevent over cooking and dryness. I have made this once a week for the last month!! New staple in our home!! So easy and Delish!!!!

This was pretty good overall.  I used a 5  cloves of garlic instead of the recommended amount and used just a touch less vinegar.  I ended up adding around a 1/4 cup of dry white wine and some crushed black peppercorns to the mixture.  The whole family loved it and we were able to put the extra sauce on the side dish of rice.

I had to drain all the sauce/juice and eat the chicken with lots of rice.

GOOD.  The slow cooker have enough room for 6 pounds 
of chicken wings.  Made it at high temperature for about
3 - 3 1/2 hours then to low temperature for about 15 - 30
minutes.

I am a beginner cook of about 2 weeks. I am not Filipino but always loved this dish and eat it quite a bit from a local Filipino restaurant. I thought it was a stretch for me to try this since I really am not a cook but BOY AM I GLAD I DID....AMAZING is all I have to say. I am a foodie so I know what is good and what is not and this was great and EASY!!! Even my husband who is Hispanic and doesn't really try new things loved it...and my 18 year old son ate bowl after bowl...I made it with 3lbs. of boneless, skinless breast and used 1/2c of both regular soy and rice vinegar because it was what I had, I also added 1 tbspn. of brown sugar and 2 bay leaves as others recommended. PS... the house smelled great while it was cooking and my son kept coming down asking if it was ready because he could smell it.

Made it exactly as the recipe listed. 

The chicken was very tender but it tasted meh. Mostly just tasted like soy sauce. I wouldn't make it again.

I omitted the onion and decided to add a finely grated medium carrot to the mix instead for a little sweetness. Very tasty—I’ll definitely make it again.

My family loved this recipe. I did make some changes--I used rice wine vinegar and cut it down to 1/4 c, added 2 tsp. ginger and 2T brown sugar. It was so easy and delicious! My son said it was like eating chicken wings without the mess. Next time, I will skin the chicken first or use boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

I used white wine vinegar and 3 Bay leaves and half cup chicken broth.   NOOOOOOOOOO SUGAR.  It would ruin it.  I spoon it over brown rice and it is sooooo delicious!  I crave it.  My new favorite food.  Cooking my 4th batch now.  MMMMMMM

Worked out wonderfully with the time and measurements. I added the bay leaves and peppercorn like my moms Filipino adobo. I've made this before but not with a slow cooker and it tasted exactly like I normally make it!

This was my first time ever eating or cooking Filipino food. I decided I'd try it as everyone at church (I'm catholic) raves about the food our Filipino ladies cook. Now I see what all the hoopla is about! This was not only easy, it tasted really amazing. I was surprised because looking at the ingredients, I didn't think it was going to be anything spectacular, I am so glad that I was wrong! If you're looking to try Filipino food, this a great, easy recipe to begin with! I will definitely be trying more Filipino recipes after this! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was easy and the end result was really good.  I followed the suggestion of others on adding the peppercorns and bay leave, some brown sugar, less white vinegar.  I omitted the onions and added some cilantro that I had left from some tacos.  I know is not part of the real Adobo Chicken but it added great flavor.  It was a hit and my husband loved it.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

We loved this...well something like THIS anyways. I ran out of soy sauce (made a double batch) and used Worcestershire sauce *dont kill me* I think it gave the chicken just the right KICK so my DH did not say "Blah". He is a picky eater and if things are not just meat and patatos he has something to say about it. He loved this though! THX for the idea to work off of~

Wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, it tastes like soy sauce and onions to me.  But I cut up the chicken and put it in a salad with my favorite Japanese Peanut Sesame Dressing (recipe from this site) and holy cow!  So delish.  So it wasn't a loss at all, just needed more to it to make it to my dinner table.  Thanks for the easy recipe

Very good and simple. Taste great with a rice dish on the side. Just make sure you don't overcook 6 hours worked well for us first hour on high and t he remaining 5 on low.

Our family did not like this at all.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and it was still salty.  It just tasted like chicken with soy sauce.  I will not make it again.

We benefited by reading previous reviews (& suggestions).  We used white vinegar, low sodium soy sauce, 2T brown sugar & ½ c water.  We also skinned the chicken prior to slow cooking.  We cooked the chicken (on low per recipe) for 6 hrs.  It needs no longer!  After removing the chicken (& shredding it), we thickened the sauce w/ 2T corn starch mixed w/ 2T water (turn your slow cooker to high for approx. 5 min.)  & mixed the shredded chicken in sauce.  We served this w/ brown rice & green beans.  Great recipe!

This was ok, but nothing spectacular. Part of the problem is that my chicken breasts were dry...and I used the liquid quantities specified and cooked on low for six hours. So the fact that the meat was dry is really contributing to my average rating.

Followed the tip from  JC Perez on the different amounts to make the sauce, added extra garlic and a few chiles for some kick. left it in for 8 hours. Delicious.

Over all a good recipe but minus one star for the pissing and moaning I had to endure because there were BONES in it.  Next time I'll have to just buy skinless/boneless.  I tasted the vinegar-soy sauce mix before I poured it over the chicken and decided it was too sour so I added 1/4-1/2 c brown sugar.  Next time I might add 5 spice powder ot garam masala.

i'm not really giving this a fair rating considering i changed it a bunch from ' JC Perez's review (the 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1 cup water, and 2 bay leaves). i also added 1tbsp brown sugar. plust the garlic and onion of course.
it was very very good and i would give it a 5.

Read alot of reviews before making and cut the soy sauce down to 1/2 c. Unfortunately this was not a hit at my house. The soy sauce overpowered everything. Will not try again!

My entire family love's this dish.  I make it with boneless skinless chicken thighs because they didn't like the skin and bones in the suace.  It's also great if you add brocoli or sugar snap peas in the last hour of cooking.

I didn't care for this recipe. The aroma was not very appealing to me and the chicken did not have a very appetizing look to it. I have never made or ate adobo chicken before so I don't know if that is the way it is suppose to be or not. I could not get past the way it smelled so we did not eat it.  Thank you for sharing though.

This should be called Soy Sauce Chicken.  The chicken came out tender and juicy, falling off of the bones.  However, if you don't like soy sauce don't make this.  That's the only flavor we could taste.  I'd make it again if I didn't have anything else in the house but I won't go out of my way to make it again.

I thought this chicken was really easy to prepare and turned out really well. I used chicken breasts, so I cut back cooking time a bit, and followed the advice of others and replaced about half of the white vinegar with red wine vinegar. The results were great and went well with rice. Everyone enjoyed it and leftovers were just as good.

This chicken dish was great to come to home to and smells great as well. I did make the mistake of using a whole chicken, which made it impossible to save the left overs, but I will definately make again with the chicken pieces as stated in the recipe

This recipe is a family favorite!  It is simple and easy and tastes oh so good.  The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is I suggest using half regular soy sauce and have low-sodium in order to regulate saltiness.

Great recipe!  I did tweak it a bit also.  I used 1/4 cup vinegar, 4 garlic cloves, added 1 cup water, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, and added peppercorns and 2 bay leaves.  I also only used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I add quartered red potatoes and carrots to make this a complete meal.  This recipe is excellent!  A new favorite of mine and my husbands!

I am cooking this now as I type and the kitchen smells wonderful!! Its only been simmmering for about 3 hours but so far the chicken has very nice flavor. I can't wait until its done!! I suggest using dark meat for this recipes. Chicken breast get dry to easily. I plan on serving it with white rice and broccoli. NOTE: Add the additional extras as suggested by the other reviewers it really make for nice flavor.

Excellent, moist, great flavor.  The sauce is great with bread.  I triple the onions because they come out so good.

This recipe is pretty tasty.  It doesn't taste anything like any chicken adobo I have ever tried.  Way too much onion and galic.  Also it did not need to cook for 6 hours.

My husband is not a huge fan of slow-cooker meals so he wasn't thrilled about this one. It is really easy but the taste isn't that great either.

It wasn't quite as good as I was hoping it'd be, based on prior reviews, but it was a nice change of pace from other chicken dishes.  Per others suggestions, I used balsamic vinegar, 2 T of brown sugar, about a 1/2 cup extra water and served it over white rice.

Love to cook, love chicken, onions, garlic. What went wrong with this recipe?
I did not read the reviews before I tried this.  I would have pased on this one, had I looked at the reviews first.  What a waste of good chicken.

I get excited about recipes with lots of 5 stars.  So, I tried this.  It was very mediocre.  My family said I didn't need to cook it again.  I was disappointed.  It smelled delicious.  The taste was just "okay."

Mmmm...sorry this just didn't work for us.  I really wanted to like this recipe, but it was way too intense.  I tasted it just before it was done and it was so strong that I added a can of chicken broth.  That helped, but I don't think I'll make this one again.  I have to admit it smell really good while it cooked.

For everyone who said this "stinks" up their house, I'm not sure what they're talking about.  This was good, my husband liked it more than I did, but it definitely smelled good, if anything.  I added some brown sugar and potatoes as others suggested.  Thanks.

THIS WAS PRETTY DARN GOOD. I USED BONE-IN CHICKEN BREASTS INSTEAD OF THE A WHOLE CHICKEN. I SHREDDED THE CHICKEN AND ADDED IT TO RAMEN NOODLES, MUSHROOMS, SNOW PEAS AND BEAN SPROUTS; THEN I DRIZZLED SOME OF THE SAUCE OVER THAT..I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN.

The chicken was moist, but it was extremely salty.  The onions almost carmelized which was nice, though.

Absolutely Fabulous!!! I made this with chicken breasts, because I don't like dark meat chicken. It was AWESOME!!!! I used cider vinegar, because the recipe didn't specify what kind to use. I reccomend using low-sodium soy sauce for this recipe. I will be making this many, many times. THANK YOU!!!!

Fabulous, with a couple alterations.  I used *apple cider* vinegar, used low sodium soy sauce, and added 2 crushed bay leaves.  My fiance LOVED it!  This is going into permanent rotatation at my house!  Thanks so much.

This was pretty good.  I used low-sodium soy sauce.  Next time, I'll use chicken breasts and legs instead of cutting up a whole chicken.  I also removed the skin from the chicken.  I bet the addition of brown sugar or pineapple would give an even better flavor.

WOW!  Meets all requirements for few ingredients and quick prep.  I didn't read the reviews first but made the recipe as listed.  EVERYONE went back for more even my VERY PICKY kids - good thing I have a large crockpot and used 14! skinless boneless breasts and doubled the sauce.  Will definitely make again, possibly with variations

This is good! I added the ginger and brown sugar like others have suggested. Just before I put the cover on I poured about a 1/2 cup of orange juice over the chicken.

Im from a Filipino Family...Im german by birth.My daughters a filipino and once you get used to the smell and all its really nothing. Adobo is one of my favorites over potatoes.Trust me once you get used to the taste and all its wonderful. You can mend the recipe to fit your tastes..But it is a really good dish.My family loves it.Nothing beats moms cooking tho...

This recipe was very easy but it was really strong- I would maybe dilute the sauce with some water next time. I would also use low sodium soy sauce so it's not so salty.

While cooking it smells like old fashion stuffing. Serve over rice or noodles with some of the extra sauce from the crock pot over it. Next time, I will try to cook with fresh green Beans. 
Thank you for the recipe.

I must have done something wrong. When I put it all in the pot, it smelled absolutely delicous, but when it came out it was nothing special. I wont be making this again.

I have made this receipe twice and love it!!  It's so easy!!  My friends think I am crazy to do this in a slow cooker because it takes so much longer then cooking on the stove but I love the fact that I just throw it all in the slow cooker in the morning and when I come home at night it's all ready to eat!!!
