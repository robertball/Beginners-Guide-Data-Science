Big hit with the family, I used regular carrots that I julienned on my mandolin, a new hot weather salad, thanks for the recipe!

My friend's daughter, who does not like carrots, gobbled up this salad because of the light, fresh taste from the carrots marinating overnight in the unique dressing. Definitely a keeper! :)

Great change for a carrot salad! I just had regular carrots but I bet the colored ones would look pretty on a plate!

Absolutely delicious for how simple it was. First time I made as is and I found it needed way more citrus and less oil for my tastes (granted a "bunch" of carrots is pretty vague so keep that in mind)! Still super good. Next time I added red wine vinegar, fresh dill and garlic... phenomenal!! Also thought it was even better the next day so making it ahead of time for a party might be a good idea. Going to try it greek style next with oregano, lots of garlic and some crumbled feta...possibilities are endless!

Yum, love this salad! I added lime juice instead of lemon as that's what I had on hand, and it was delish! I can see orange juice working in this wonderfully too. The hint of cumin gives it that warmth and depth of flavour. It went great as a side with herb roasted chicken and potatoes and of course it's a beautiful salad to look at! I will make this again for sure.

Easy salad with ingredients i have. Cumin was very mild but flavorwise not stupendous. I would make it again though
