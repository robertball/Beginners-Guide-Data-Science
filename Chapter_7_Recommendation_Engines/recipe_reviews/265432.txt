Very good. For the crust, I used: 1/2 pound softened unsalted butter, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 cups flour and pinch salt. I combined and pressed into a 9x13 pan (lined with foil), and baked for 20 minutes at 350F.  (Cooled it down) Then followed recipe for filling as written. It was nice and tart, creamy and very lemony. After cooling, I chilled it, the removed the whole cake using the foil and cut it into bars. Took it to a Christmas potluck. It was a hit.

Another winner for my Women's Club meeting! I had to use a graham cracker crust as I didn't have any shortbread but that did not affect the flavor of the bars. Next time I will buy the shortbread cookies and make the crust in the recipe.

Very good - but nothing like the picture - which looks like a traditional lemon bar.  This is definitely a cheesecake.  i made a homemade raspberry syrup and swirled it through and baked.  Delicious.

A real disappointment. The crust was good but the filling was gritty. My guess is that the 4 tbsp flour should have been decreased or not added at all. My husband and I each ate a piece and agreed to dump the rest in the garbage.

This was nice. I cut the recipe in half, and put the filling in a prepared nine inch gram crust. I baked it till set but forgot the powdered sugar on the top, but it still turned out well. Thank you for sharing.

I used inexpensive shortbread cookies because that’s all that was available nearby. I won’t do that again. It was the weak piece in an otherwise delicious, flavorful dessert.

It was wonderful.  No changes.  I like it better than cheesecake..not as rich.  It would be wonderful ad a key lime in exchange for the lemon.

Came out tasting great, but was not firm.  The lemon filling was a bit soupy even after chilling overnight.  Baked 30 min @ 350 degrees.  suggestions please!
