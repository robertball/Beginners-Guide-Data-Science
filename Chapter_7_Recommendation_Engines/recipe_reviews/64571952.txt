These are surely thee best cookie ever!  I have made them dozens of times, and get good results/reviews with all variety of the organic nut butters.  One can easily reduce or add coconut sugar to sweetness desired.  One cookie is rich and filling enough to satisfy both in protein and in sweetness.  As well as knowing they are healthy.  I hope you try these, you too may never go back to the same old PB cookie.
