This recipe suffers from a problem I have found to be all too common on this site:  Vague instructions.  The recipes says to roll the dough into log shapes.  How many?  2? 4? 10?  Then it says to cut these logs into 1 inch slices in an irregular shape. What sort of shape? Octagonal? Trapezoid? or   does it mean to cut on the diagonal as in biscotti?  I rolled the dough into 2 logs about 12 inches long.  Then I sliced it into one inch slices on the diagonal.  This gave me 17 biscuit/cookies.  Anyone who manages to get 48 pieces from this recipe has my admiration.  The pieces would be microscopic if I did it.  These came out tasting pretty good, but I am rating this recipe 2 stars due to the inexact instructions........Aug, 22nd  I had to re-think my rating of this recipe.  Even though I still think the instructions are ambiguous, the cookies are strangely addicting.  My husband and I can't stop eating them.  Will definitely make these again.  Soon.

Strange but likeable. I used a Cabernet in this and the biscuits turned out to be a grayish color that's not very appealing. Next time, I'll add a little red food coloring. I agree with other reviewers that the instructions were vague. I ended up rolling the dough into 3 logs and then sliced it, kind of like small biscotti. I got about 36 biscuits out of it. When these finished cooking at 30 minutes, I took one out of the oven and tried it. That was a mistake. They really need to stay in the oven to cool to get that crispness on the outside. Don't eat them until they are completely cool -- they don't taste very good when they are warm. After sitting in a tin all night, they were quite good today and made a great afternoon snack. I'll be taking a few with me for lunch every day -- they make a nice complement to soup, salad, and chicken or tuna salad. It's a nice change from bread or dry crackers.

Very good recipe. Easy to make and, as advertised, the cookies are crunchy and lightly sweet. For those that may want to try it out:
I didn't toast the seeds prior to coating the cookies and it worked fine: seeds toasted during the baking period. Also, skipping the egg white worked fine: seeds stuck to cookie dough with no problems.

Surprisingly yummy.  I have a tendency to try weird recipes, this qualified. The 5 minute rest time was important. It gets the baking powder activated. You want to keep those air pockets! I was very careful not to over work the dough while cutting so the cookies would remain light. Will make these again, definitely.

These were pretty good.  They have a crisp outside and are only tinged with sweetness.  The biscuits are very dense-don't use these if you're looking for something fluffy.  I used the egg white on half of them, but it picked up far more sesame seeds than the amount called for, so I stopped coating them, and it worked fine.  I only ended up with about 20 biscuits, but that could easily be my fault.  The dough was slightly difficult to roll into logs for cutting.  Yet overall, they are a mellow, tasty, and filling treat.

Loved these!  I am a big fan of sesame so had to try these.  Want to thank the other reviewers for the tips.  I too excluded egg white - not needed.  I used way more sesame seeds than 2 T. though - probably 4-4 1/2 total.  These remind me of some of my one grandmothers savory cookies from my childhood.  Fabulous.  Thanks for sharing this one.

I've made these several times now.  Very addicting.  Definitely don't need the egg white wash.  I don't know why I didn't rate this when I first tried it.  When I saw it in today's daily e-mail it brought back memories of the first reviewer's comment about her admiraition for anyone getting the number of biscuits suggested by the submitter.  Quite witty.

I eliminated the salt. Instead of using an egg white to adhere the sesame seeds, I just rolled the dough into balls, and pressed into raw (not roasted) sesame seeds.  These remind me of biscotti!  Great cookies

these cookies are pretty great and easy to make. its hard to waste things especially wine so after i turned leftover wine maranade leftover from a great veggie noodle dish the day bfore i threw that in for as the wine and left all the other ingredients the same.  i did leave out the egg white because the dough was sticky enough as it was so i made sure to flour the table and made a long skinny snake to cut them into small pieces. thanks for the recipe im going to try the recipe exact next time and make these for a party!

here was the marinade i used:
