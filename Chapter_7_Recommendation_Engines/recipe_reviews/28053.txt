I have to agree with the others on this one. It was tasty, but needed a little zip. I heeded the adviec of others and made these changes which made the recipe even better. I cut the recipe in half so note accordingly. I cubed the chicken and tossed with the cinnamon and cooked for less time, about 15 min. I used a half of a jalapeno, a whole garlic clove, i added cayenne to the potatoes before going in the oven, the whole lime, a bell pepper with the onions, olive oil in stead of canola, and lots of cilantro right near the end. the potatoes needed a little non-stick as well, but otherwise, different, and really a nice meal.

This is my recipe...submitted long ago and never realized it got published...looked at the original recipe and realized the reason many say the chix is dry is that they published the cooking temp for the potato not the chix...lower the oven temp for the chix...or lower the cook time.  So honored it got published and enjoyed...guess I should make it again:)

yay!  i didn't change much in this recipe, but I did use sweet potato instead of regular potato, cuz it's better for you tastes better too, IMO. My husband said it was one of the best dinners I've ever made.... and we've been together 12 years so that's a lot of dinners! I served it with some NO FAT sour cream, which was a good call because it would have been too dry without being able to dip it into some cream, but that said, it was way yummy and i'll def make it again. And it's not bad for you either, so it gets all five stars. Thanks!

This was surprisingly tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used flour tortillas instead of corn (all we had).  We are pretty picky, but we definitely did enjoy these - but we expected a little more of a kick.  Next time, we will add a little cayenne to the potatoes before baking to give them a little more spice.  Also, I think that coating just the outside of the chicken with the cinnamon mixture didn't really allow the cinnamon to stand out as much.  Next time, I think we will cut chicken breasts into slices or cubes, toss in spice mixture and then cook (so cinnamon covers more surface area).  Also, the jalapeno didn't add anything and we even used ALL the seeds!  Next time we'll add in at the end so that kick is not lost in the cooking.  We'll also use 2 limes to enhance the lime flavor. It needs a little help to be 5-stars but this is overall a great combination of flavors!

I give this recipe a 4 only because these were on the dry side. I will make them again but will probably shred a roasted deli chicken or moisten the chicken with broth before adding.

One of my regulars!! This one is a family favorite.  The potatoes took longer to brown than the recipe stated, so start them first. I omitted the Jalapeño and used a chopped Chipotle in adobo sauce. I served it with sour cream, colby jack cheese, guacamole and a tossed salad. Yum!

Fantastic!  I made this exactly like the recipe, except that I added a bit more jalapeno.  I was nervous because the cinnamon seemed like it would add a strange taste, but it was perfect.  My husband, who is a very picky eater, absolutely loved it!  We ate them without any cream or toppings, and they were great.  The corn tortillas were a must. This will be a new staple in our house.

Fabulous!  I marinated the chicken using Super Fajita Marinade for a few hours and then coated the chicken with cinnamon. I used the marinade to coat the potatoes and cooked the chicken and potatoes together for 30min.

Amazing!!!! So deliciously different. If I could give this one 10 stars, I would. I didn't change anything except an additional tablespoon of jalapenos, and a tablespoon or two of finely chopped cilantro to the skillet mixture. I LOVED the cinnamon, it blended perfectly in the recipe. Will make again and again, I'm sure!

This recipe was good, however, the Tablespoon of cinnamon is way too much - I would use maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of a tablespoon.  It just made it way too spicy, however, it adds a good flavor.  I recommend for any fajita recipe to buy a lemon and squeeze it over the chicken immediately before serving it.  It gives the chicken a great taste and it is my absolute favorite thing to do with fajitas!

This is "One of the best dinners I have made in quite some time" per my picky hubby.  And I agree!!  Followed the recipe exactly -- Next time will add some sliced green peppers, coz we like 'em.  The potatoes are a surprising component and were the hit of the table.  I served it with Dee's Mexican Rice (per earlier reviewer's suggestions) and that is ANOTHER winner.  Took the (few) leftovers for lunch and shared the recipe at work -- with raving cube-mates.

I was really curious about this recipe but had no potatoes or jalapeno peppers, so I tried it without potatoes and with diced green chiles...it was a nice dinner, but definitely missing depth and body without those peppers and potatoes. I plan to try it again - with the correct ingredients!

This is a great recipe!  To speed this recipe up even more you can use country style hashbrowns instead of cubing the potatoes.  Absolutely delicious!

These were great.  I left out the potatoes, added tons of cilantro and extra chili powder.  I make this all the time.

Not wowed by the recipe.The good thing is it gives you a place to start. It needs some spice, like others suggested. I think next time I will shred the chicken and add a whole lime and toss with some chipotle sauce before putting back on the skillet. I suggest such using the basic idea of the recipe but add your own zest.

Surprisingly good! I followed the recipe with no changes except for adding an extra lime. This would also be good with bell peppers.

The only thing that really saved this dish was the potatoes...it was rather dry...we will try it again but with some small tweaks to the original recipe...

Delicious, I'm 14, and I make dinner for my family once a week. I made it on monday and it was delicious! I followed the recipe pretty well, except I used more lime and green chile peppers with sprouted grain tortillas. 6 servings served about 4 of us, it went REALLY well. Definetly keeping this one

Absolute delicious!  I made this tonight for my boyfriend and myself and we are in LOVE!  Neither of us could stop going on about how great it was.  I made some revisions: -sprinkled the potatoes with some cayenne before baking -Cooked the chicken and potatoes at the same time @ 400 but took the chicken out at 20 mins and the potatoes out at 30.  - -Added almost a full bunch of chopped cilantro right before removing the chicken/jalapeno/onion mixture from pan -Used the juice of 2 limes -Used jarred jalapenos, about 2 TB  Absolutely delicious!

This was awesome!  I didn't have a lime or a jalapeno, so I used lemon juice and a small can of green chilies.  I also added a redpepper to the onions and garlic.  This turned out so good!  My whole family said it was a keeper.

Very yummy.  At first I thought it wasn't spicy but it kicked in pretty soon.  I was too lazy to bake the chicken and just chopped up my breasts (ha ha) pretty small and sauteed them with the spices.  Also I didn't have quite enough potatoes so also roasted up some pumpkin which I love. For a lower calorie sour cream substitute I often mix whipped cottage cheese, natural yoghurt and a bit of lemon juice together.  You get all the creamy goodness and on something spicy you can't really tell the difference.

The best chicken fajitas we have ever eaten! The lime, cinnamon and toasty potatoes make this an authentic Mexican dish.  I add more cilantro, since I'm a cilantro fiend.  A blk bean/mango salad-recipe on Bush Beans can, rounded out our meal.  Thank you for this recipe.

I am not one much for "interesting" tastes and was hesitent to try this, with the cinnamon but am glad that I did. I've made these a few times now and I think I like them better and better everytime. I cook my chicken in the slow cooker so it is really tender and easy to shred. Another thing that seemed odd to me was the potatoes and yet I love the extra touch. Yum!!!

This was terrible. I followed it pretty closely, cubing the chicken at someone else's recommendation (cooking for 15 minutes). Chicken doesn't go with cinnamon. It was dry and tasted odd.

Delicious! I made a few changes: First, I cooked the chicken and cinnamon in the Crockpot instead of the oven and added the lime juice here. This helped keep the chicken moist, and cut down on the oven usage.  After saute-ing the onion, I added the chicken, half of a chopped jalepeno, and half of another lime (juiced). I also cut in some cilantro. Served with the other half of the jalepeno (my husband likes things slightly hotter than I do), salsa, sour cream, chopped tomatoes, olives, and warmed corn tortillas. My husband and I both LOVED these!! :)

This recipe was excellent; I have made it several times.  I love the flavor of the cinnamon and lime together.  I did replace the baking potatoes with sweet potatoes I think this added some additional flavor, and sweet potatoes are so good for you.  In addition, one time I did not have the jalapeno, so I replaced it with some canned chipotles in adobo sauce.  This added some additional heat and a lot of smoky flavor.  This is now my preferred way of making the recipe.

Whole family gobbles these fajitas down --- including a very pciky 3 year old boy!  He and his five year old sister even requested them in lieu of PB7J in their lunch the next day for camp!  My husband loves them too - great subtle flavoring - don't be turned off by the ingredients!

It really was not a hit with my family.  It wasn't too bad.  I think it would have tasted much better w/o the Cinnamon.  We tweaked the recipe a little.  We took out the potatoes first.  We put a helping of the chicken  onion and garlic (I put in some red  bell pepper)on a plate, put some shredded mexican cheese on the chicken..melt it in the micro, next crush taco flavored doritos on top with a little taco sauce and sour cream (optional).  I liked it much better that way.

These are excellent!  My husband requests them all the time.  I do suggest using 2 limes to give it a stronger flavor.

The cinammon provides a nice and different flavorful twist to the fajita. Nice and filling too. Now if I just had better tortillas to put the chicken in, but that's a totally different matter.

Five stars with changes: I cut the chicken into small pieces, sprinkled with cinnamon, and baked with the potatoes (sprinkled generously with paprika) for about 12 minutes - it came out perfect. I also added diced red bell peppers, doubled the lime juice and added cilantro at the end. Served with flour tortillas and pretty tasty! Don't forget the salsa!

We LOVED these fajitas!  Don't be scared off by the odd combination of potatoes and cinnamon -- they truly make these fajitas.  We spiced ours up a little more with some hot sauce (and as an added bonus, we used our leftover potatoes for hash browns the next morning) but other than that, this recipe doesn't need any changes.  It made for a very relaxing dinner that was easy to make and a great change of pace from the usual flavor combos!

These weren't very good - not enough spices, but way too much cinnamon, and who puts potatoes in fajitas anyway.

I really liked this. My hubby liked it too, but thought it was a little sweet, so I might cut down on the cinnamon next time. Great for a totally different fajita. Oh, I cut the raw chicken up and then added the spices, lime juice and jalapeno to marinade for a couple minutes. Then cooked in a skillet with onions and bell pepper until soft.

I used many of the suggestions fom the previous reviews. I added a little chicken broth to the chickeen as it baked to retain moistness. With the onions, garlic and jalepenos, I added some chipotle in adobo sauce (enough to taste--nice and smokey flavor) and a can of chopped chilis. Was fantastic!

loved it! i went to get all the ingredients and forgot the potatoes, so i substituted black beans. love the cinnamon. mine were nice and moist, juice running out the tortillas. and, i don't like corn tortillas so i used flour.
i would also use a bit less cinnamon and more lime, and more jalapeno; just my taste. i will have to remember the potatoes, because i think roasted potatoes would be awesome.
served with some sour cream and avocado, but i preferred no sour cream.

This came out good, but we had to tweak it a bit.  I try to make things true to the recipe at first, but next time will definitely add more spices like others have suggested and more jalapeno.  We had some chipotle sauce that ended up doing the trick in the end.  Love that it has potatoes, so different but adds a great texture. (I love starchy food though).  Will make this again one day.

Very Tasty.  It does need more lime juice and spices because it is a little bland without them.  I used lime crystals and sprinkled several packets over my potatos while they baked.....my family enjoyed this recipe very much.

Surprisingly good!  The flavors complemented each other well, and my little ones liked the cinnamon flavor.  The potatoes were a nice addition and bulked up the chicken.  I will make this regularly!

This recipe is amazing!  My friends were so impressed.  Who would have thought Lime and Cinnamon would work so well together.  The potatoes are the most important part.

This recipe was delicious!  I only put about 3/4 a tbs of cinnamon in, and I cheated and bought pre-cooked garlic and herb chicken.  I marinaded the chicken in the oil, lime, and cinnamon, then cooked the sauted onions, chicken, and jalapeno for around 15 minutes.  This ensured that my onions were done to a t, and the meat was warm all the way through!  When serving these up, I slather my tortillas with sour cream and salsa, then top it with shredded cheese.  It was the perfect amount of juicy and delicious!  However, if you like spicy, you are going to have to add more jalapeno or something.  Overall, this was terrific!!

this was a great recipe that did need a little adjustment for our taste.  I added a small amount of chicken stock to the chicken so that it would remain juicy.  I also cooked the potatoes ahead of time at 400 then lowered the temperature to 350 1/2 hour later,  add the chicken and continued cooking the potatoes in Olive Oil at the same time.  I did add Cilantro, red peppers, extra fresh lime juice and preferred to use flour tortillas (not a fan of corn although they are the best for making Tortilla chips).  Family loved it with sour cream.  It's a keeper!

I made these without the potatoes for a low carb version and loved it.  The first time I  used bottled lime juice and I measured 1/3 cup.  The second time I added about 3 Tablespoons more than previously and it was outstanding.

I cut one potato into small cubes and baked in pan sprayed with pam.  Added salt and pepper and cooked for about 45 min.   I grilled 2 chicken breasts on the BBQ. I removed the chicken from the grill, added garlic powder and cinnamon. Set aside.  Then I sauted red onion, yellow bell pepper and garlic in oil in a wok.  Added chicken, fresh cut mushrooms, cayenne pepper, 3 tbs of red taco sauce, a handfull of pickeled jalapenos (not as hot as fresh but flavorful), and 4 diced pickled red peppers.  Add the chicken and lime juice and sautee for about 1-2 more minutes.  Garnished with sour cream, spinach, tomatoes, and cheese.  Plenty of flavor.  This meal was all natural with no preservatives... (except the tortillas which I use low calorie "FLat-Out" wraps that are only 90 cal/9 gm of fiber, & 9 gm protien

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't add the jalapeno peppers or any heat at all due to my little kids.  It was still delicious.  I cooked it at 400 degrees.  I went 40 minutes for the potatoes and 30 minutes for the chicken.  I think we'll be having it again tonight.  Even my most picky eaters loved it.

Ehhh... Fresh food is always satisfying at some level... I don't really understand the point of the cinnamon... There are so many flavors with the peppers and onions and the cinnamon didn't really compliment them very well... I will not make this recipe again.

We loved this. It was better than I thought it would be.  The potatoes didn't add a whole lot so I'm not sure if I would make the potatoes with it again. I really liked the sour cream with the cinnamon, they complemented each other very nicely.

liked the cinnamon but this dish was missing something.  I did add extra jalepenos and the cayenne pepper to the potatoes but it is not a meal I feel is worth repeating

AWESOME recipe AlyssaLyn! My husband said the cinnamon "threw him off" and made him think of cinnamon toast...but my husband is a weirdo when it comes to things like this...in any case, he finished his plate! ;) So a finicky eater may balk....but anyone with a normal brain and taste buds is going to LOVE this!  I ended up using some cayenne pepper on the potatoes, because we love spice...but I only used a bit. I also ended up having sour cream on some of the fajitas...it was good with and without! I wasn't sure how the flavors in play were going to come together on this one...but it was really too good to be true! Just a perfect balance...the jalapeños made me remember why I love jalapenos so much..the lime was perfect with the cinnamon..the whole thing just came together.  Also...and this is really secondary...the fact that the prep was so quick and then the somewhat lengthy baking times for the potatoes and chicken gave me plenty of time to clean as I went and tend to sniveling children while cooking...I know that doesn't REALLY matter, but with an 8 week old and a 19 month old...it was nice! Very easy to make, very easy to eat...very easy to give it five stars!

SOOOO Yummy!!! The potatoes REALLY add a newe texture to fajitas that I've never experienced before. I took other comments into consideration and cut up the chicken and seasoned it before baking. I put the chicken and potatoes in the same baking dish at 350. After 30 minutes I took the chicken out, but let the potatoes cook for 15 more minutes. I made this for my husband and followed it up with some white chocolate creme brulee - we were both pleased!

Great.  I baked the breasts in a little lime juice so they didn't dry out, make extra potatoes, they were the best.  A picky 7 yr old and an even picky-er 3 yr old DEVOURED these.  Will make them again!

The shredded chicken turned to mush and the only flavor i could taste was cinnamon.  I had some leftovers the next day and they tasted better after sitting for a while - only then could I get the heat of the jalapenos.

This recipe was awesome- 1. because it was so easy and 2. because it tastes great! 

I didn't want to take the time to bake the potatoes or the chicken so I pan cooked both of them. It was MUCH faster. I cut out the oil and used PAM- which also worked well. Additionally I added cumin to the chicken- along with the cinnamon, pepper, and salt. I forgot to add the hot sauce- but it tured out great anyway. 

I will definitely be making these again!

Very nice, we decided it's a keeper. Who'd've thought that cinnamon on chicken would work, but it does. I offered several toppings with it(sour cream, salsa, salsa con ceso, shredded cheese, olives, shredded lettuce, tomatoes) for everyone to build their own fajitas. They were not try at all that way. I recommend getting the biggest tortillas you can get to have ample room for all this flavor.

I made this dish tonight and was disappointed. The chicken was very dry and I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all.  I made it, following the recipe as is. Since limes don't have a lot of juice, I had to add half a lemon. The recipe sounded intriguing but I don't think I will make it again.

Family says that this was fairly good.  Wouldn't mind having it again, but not great like some others I have tried on them.  I agree that the potatoes are pointless.  Anyone that ate them just put katsup on them.  From the cooking stand point, if a recipe takes an hour or so to make, it should be worth it.  The effort wasn't worth the mediocre result for me.

Delicious!  I added extra onion and served with avocado and sour cream.  I forgot to add cheese, which I normally put on everything, and I didn't even miss it!  Only slight complaint is that the cooking method left the chicken slightly dry.  I think I'll add a little chicken broth while baking the chicken next time.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

WONDERFUL!  These sounded so gross that we had to try making them . . . and we were pleasantly surprised!  We had been searching for an "authentic"-tasting Mexican recipe ever since going there on our honeymoon last year, and we FINALLY found one.  They are incredible.  I have doubled the recipes several times when we had groups of people for dinner, and they were wonderful each time.  We always have too many potatoes, so I usually get rid of half the potatoes left, mix it with the leftover chicken and keep it in the fridge.  My husband eats it right out of the container for lunch the next day.  Personally, I think that it would be a HUGE mistake NOT to serve these with fresh, chopped cilantro.  It really puts the taste over the top!  YUMMY!

great recipe.. I ended up leaving out the potatoes the second time around and added wild rice, some cheese and lettuce, to make a wrap. I thought about adding a couple raisins next time.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! I did a little alterations of my own as well. I added crushed red pepper to the onions and jalapenos, and then added honey into the dish when mixing it all together.

This recipe is excellent with a few changes. Baking the chicken makes it super dry so instead I cooked it on a stove top pan replacing the jalapenos with diced chilies. This made all the difference.

This was soo good! I did go a little overboard on the spices...I added cayenne pepper to the potatoes before I cooked them, and added too much cinnamon. The cayenne was perfect though. Textures went together beautifully...And the lime was a pleasant suprise when you bit into the onion. I will definitely make this again, with less cinnamon next time. This made a TON of food though, I only cook for two people so we have lunch and dinner for tomorrow.

It was delicious! My husband has even requested it again; I’ve made it 3 times this month!  I did take other’s advice and added cayenne pepper to the potatoes, cubed the chicken in smaller pieces (to get the cinnamon to cover more surface area), cooked the chicken for 15 minutes, added broth to the chicken in the skillet, and added the jalapeños at the very end. Great recipe, I would have never imagined putting cinnamon on chicken.

This was fantastic. However, I modified this a bit. I cooked the chicken in a 350 degree oven for an hour coated in the cinnamon/salt/pepper mix. I did this in a foil packet. I added another foil packet of the potatoes coated with olive oil, chili powder, old bay, and tony catchers all spice after 15 minutes. After I pulled the chicken, I added more cinnamon for taste. I didn't use jalapenos, but instead added hot sauce to the garlic/onion mixture. I also tryed the corn tortillas, but flour tastes so much better with this dish. Next time I am going to use some more lime juice. However, this is fantastic.

I took many suggestions for this recipe and kept them in mind - I used sweet potatoes, thinly sliced breasts of chicken rubbed with cinnamon, chili powder, salt, and pepper - i cooked with olive oil in pan.... then sauteed red peppers, anions in pan until soft, mixed everything together in a whole wheat soft tortilla, topped with fat free plain greek yogurt - cilantro, and a squeeze of lime! Excellent

We were so pleasantly surprised by this.   Not too spicy, not too bland just plain good and yummy.  I made the potatoes in toaster oven while the chicken cooked.  I used a pretty large chop on the jalps because I wanted to be able to keep them out of my 2-yr old's portion.  I also used red skinned potatoes and left the skin on. The only changes I will make next time is using Montreal Steak Seasoning on the potatoes and slicing the onion rather than chopping it.  The potatoes were different but so good, all in all a great recipe with a good twist.

We thought this was OK.  It wasn't a huge hit the night I made it for dinner, but the kids really liked the leftovers in quesadillas.

These are totally tasty and I make this pretty often. They come together easily and the flavor is just great. I do prefer to use green onions when I have them, but they are a wonderful meal made just as written.

This is one of my regular recipes, definitely one I enjoy.  As others have said, it is on the mild side but is easy to modify according taste.  I usually use half a jalapeno for 2 servings and a whole lime (which also keeps the chicken moist).  Sometimes I even add some cinnamon to the potatoes for more punch.  The unusual (yet authentically Mexican) combination of flavors make this dish a nice twist on the same old fajitas.

I thought these were really good. The lime and cinnamon were a great combo and I loved that I could just stick it all in the oven. I liked the texture the onions gave to the fajitas since I used flour tortillas, the tortillas, chicken, and potatoes were all soft, so the onions gave just a bit of crunch.

Really good. I omitted the jalapenos and my girls even ate it. I also used a seasoning salt on the potatoes instead of just plain salt. I made this with homeade tortillas too-

I thought this was very good.  I made the recipe exactly as stated, except i used country style hashbrowns and lime juice rather than a juiced lime.  My chicken was extremely moist as well so i did not need to add any broth.  Good flavors and pretty simple.

I was leary about a chicken fajita that called for cinnamon.  WONDERFUL!!  Thanks for the recipe.  My husband says "This one is a keeper, right?"  We both loved it.

This meal was OK. Both my hubby & I weren't impressed and had high hopes b/c of all the other high ratings. I thought the cinnamon really OVERPOWERED the recipe and I didn't even add as much as the recipe originally called for. I even added extra green&yellow peppers for some added flavor. I think there needed to be some other spices added, maybe some cumin, more garlic??? 
I don't think this will be made again in this house but it was still a nice change from ordinary fajitas.

I thought these were just okay.  Not bad, but not really all that great...you know?  I'd recommend serving with a wedge of lime to spritz over the put-together fajita - this gave it a nice edge.  

I probably won't make them again.

Yum-meee! I served this for my parents and we all loved it. Of necessity, I substituted a lemon for the lime and used olive oil instead of canola oil. The chicken is delicious and moist, the potato adds a filing surprise, and it all just comes together really well.

Eh, it was pretty good.  It didn't wow me.  Everyone liked it just fine.  I think the potatoes made it too bland...I would've like to season them with something other than just salt.

Made this using Quorn vegi breaded chicken. Needed about 2 more limes to achieve any lime taste. Came out very good though and will make again. Did not use jalapeno's as jalapeno are unbearably hot for me and my hubby, but did use a dash of red pepper.

All I can say is WOW!! The fusion of the cinnamon and the lime was wonderful. I did add a little more jalepeno than the recipe called, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  I also made Dee's Mexican Rice with this dish. It complimented it well.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This recipe has become a favourite in my house.  Thanks for the suggestion of using Dee's Mexican Rice as a side!  We like it too.  I'm going to try using sweet potato (I think Americans call them yams?) instead of chicken as a vegetarian alternative.

Absolutely yummy! This a unique dish, but one that will be come a favorite. I prefered just the chicken mixture on a tortilla. And if you leave out the potatoes it is quick to make. Also I reccomend making a fresh tomatillo salsa. I made mexican beans and refried them for a side dish.
you must try this atleast once.

I cooked this with my friends, and used this recipe in conjunction with Dee's Mexican Rice (5 *'s) and I highly recommend it.  We used marinated beef meat instead of chicken, but kept the spices, and it tasted very good, and was very filling.

I thought swapping a can of green chilies would be the equivalent of the jalapenos but it wasn't. It needs the zip of the jalapenos. It was a little bland my way. Good, but needed something else. I did add green peppers. Here's a tip- buy frozen chopped onions and green peppers. Saves a ton of time and tears.

I'm rounding up from 3.5 stars.  I think this recipe has a lot of potential and it is so different from a lot of the things I tend to make.  Definitely needs cayenne or something to add a little pep.  I will also try putting in the potatoes in to cook for about 20 minutes and then lower the temp to 350 and then stick the chicken in too and cook both for 30 min.

I thought this was a nice change from a regular fajita.  I really like the potatoes and I did use less cinnamon, that way it wasn't overpowering.  DH didn't really care for them but I did!

These were super delicious and easy to make!  The cinnamon and lime combination is a different, fun way to season fajitas.  I'm sure we'll be making this on a regular basis when we are craving Mexican food.

Great recipe. Like the others, I thought this rendition was a bit dry. Next time I'll change up the chicken I use.  Also, I'll use a little bit more jalapeños.

I was wary of this dish just by the name. After reading the rave reviews, I decided to give it a try. Maybe I did something wrong, but the fusion of cinnamon and lime was TERRIBLE! I will not make this ever again.

I tried this recipe and loved it!!! the only reason it got 4 stars from me is because of all the steps. I made it as suggested and took the advice of the last viewer and added a little chicken broth once i put in in the skillet. so it would'nt taste dry. I even have enough for left overs!!

This dish was okay. It was a little bland, like others stated, so I added some extra spices. I also added mushrooms to the sauteing and served it with white rice. Will try again with variations.

We didn't care for this at all. Way too bland. I didn't feel like I could taste the lime at all. And what was the point of the potatotes--they needed something too besides just salt. I was very disappointed.

sorry, this recipe just doesn't do it for me and hubby.  way too bland.  i added all my "favorite toppings" and all i tasted were them.  i cut the recipe in half for the two of us but left the full amount of garlic (1 clove is all!) and full amount of lime juice.  still bland.  won't be using this recipe again, sorry.

This is an excellent variation to the fajitas. I loved the lime and added alot more than the recipe called for.

I thought these were FANTASTIC.  I added a few more tsp of chopped jalapenos to kick up the 'hot' factor.  I thought the lime made a really nice compliment for the chicken.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I loved the uniqueness of it and the kitchen smelled like cinnamon rolls as it cooked!  I was a bit disappointed in that the flavor was not as strong as I had expected.  I would have liked it a bit spicier.
