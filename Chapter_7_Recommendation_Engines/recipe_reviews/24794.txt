I too ended up with chicken curry soup, but hubby ate it anyway. I'd suggest either reducing the water to only one cup OR swap out the two potatos for 1 to 2 cups of rice (they'd soak up the liquid).

True, the curry didn't thicken for this recipe, but I thought it had a good taste. It was easy and it smelled great! I didn't add the stir fry into the crockpot as suggested. I steamed the stir fry separately, as well as made rice. It was good. I had unexpected company drop by, and I served it to them, they had seconds and begged for the recipe. It was the first time I had made curry chicken of any sort and I was pleased with the outcome. I would not add the potatoes to it next time as I did serve it with rice. I would make it again. I would probably play with it some, but I always do that!

Unfortunately this curry just had no taste and the consistency was wrong. I added onions, more curry powder, cream and several other spices to try to salvage it but we were disappointed - I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

As written this was very bland and watery. So the first try was met with disappointment from my curry crazed family.  The good news is that this receipe is salvagable. The next time,  I added plain yogurt (about 2 TBLS)to thicken the sauce, coriander, cumin, and tumeric. I served it over rice with fresh ground cinnamon. Not a bad start though as the chicken stays very moist and tender.

This recipe works if you omit the water and use a can of diced tomatoes instead. I used tomatoes with onions and celery.

This "curry" was so thin, I had to thicken it with flour and more cornstarch in a sauce pan over high heat, it just didn't thicken at all.  The taste was very bland and unappetizing.  We went for MacDonalds and threw this out!  This will teach me to never make curry with recipes that only call for one spice.

As others have said this was too bland and juice to thin, although it had a nice curry smell.  If I make again will definitely add more or stronger curry or both and garlic, maybe some red/cayenne pepper and onions and use less water.

Adding more curry powder and chili paste on the plate and serving on rice (made with chicken broth, chopped onions, curry and garlic) did help.

This dish was very bland.  I would not recommend it.  We had to add other seasonings to our bowls after it was done like soy sauce.

There are a lot of ingredients missing! Good start. Use a frozen veggie medley with broccoli, carrots etc, Not a stir fry veggie mix. Add coconut milk and canned diced tomatoes,paprika and chopped celantro. Thicken with a slurry of flour and coconut milk. Depending on amount of heat you like, add some crushed red pepper.

This was not too bad. It was easy enough to make. It needed more curry and didn't thicken properly. It was tasty enough, and easy, I will try it again with less liquid and more curry.

This recipe was very bland and the juice did not thicken enough.  I think if I tried it again I would add more curry and use a can of Cream of Chicken soup in place of one of the cups of water.  The chicken was very tender, however so will definitely play around with it to give it more flavour.

My family liked this one!  I followed the directions but used one cup mixed rice instead of the potatoes.  It was good, I did have to add one cup water with the veggies because alll the moisture was pick up by the rice.

I left out the water and used prepackaged Vermont Maple and Apple Curry. Turned out very flavorful. Probably a new recipe on its own!

Needs much more cornstarch to make it a thicker gravy and lots more curry. Still very good.

I followed some advice from other reviewers. Didn't add any water, a can chopped tomatos instead. I also browned some garlic and an onion with some curry, turmeric, cumin and chilli. I didn't have potatoes and I added chick peas instead. I also noticed that a chicken was done way before the scheduled time (I cooked on High for 4 hrs). Next time, I will try 3 hrs with adding veggies after 2 hours of cooking.

I'm always trying new recipes for curry this was too bland and watery.  I make slow cooker chicken curry regularly.  My version - use 6-8 bone in thighs - 1 pkg. onion soup mix - 1 can cr. of mush. soup; 1 can of whole potatoes -  2+ tablespoons curry powder.  Serve over hot rice and garnish with any or all of chopped tomatoes; chopped carrots; chopped nuts; chopped celery and of course plenty of coconut.

Being a vegetarian I used faux chicken stips, cubed. I added a little salt as the flavor was a little bland. The curry was excellent, in fact, my mother said we should cut down on the curry a little as both of had our sinuses cleaned by the end of the meal. I, too, made rice and found it to be thick enough when served over jasmine rice. Will definitely make again.

Chicken was good, but sauce didn't thicken even after cornstarch, and no fabulous curry taste.  Kind of bland.  Needs something else.  Have to look for a new chicken curry recipe.

this recipe was easy enough to make, but I really didn't like the result.  I would have named it chicken stew with curry.  I am a big curry fan and the taste of this dish does not satisfy my curry cravings - as others have pointed out, it's rather bland.

Well, my biggest problem with this didn’t come from the ingredients but from the fact the GFI blew in the wall socket and the socket stopped working!  Three and a half hours in before I noticed. No clue how long it had been sitting there not cooking. LOL. Based on others observations and a previous attempt at making this I made the following small changes with what I found in the cupboard. I added green onions, used 3TBSP of curry, a teaspoon of cumin. I also left out the water and used 1/2 cup of white wine. While it turned out very tasty it wasn’t quite what I think of as a curry.

This is an easy to make recipe.  I cooked it on high and the timing is correct for my slow cooker.  We liked this curry, but thought it was bland. I used a very mild  curry powder.  If you like heat you could add hot sauce or red pepper.

If I make this again I wouldn't add water, I would use chicken stock instead . Also I found it was a bit bland once I added the cornstarch. More flavour was needed .  Too much liquid made this a soup .

A little bland but the chicken was tender.   Put a little more curry and sub some of the water for coconut milk.

I tried the four hour recipe and it was not nearly long enough. I ended  up cooking it for 8 hours on high. I added double the curry powder and salt because there was just not enough flavor. It was easy to make, just needed some modification to suit my taste.

This recipe needs a lot of work to be palatable. Just as the other contributors have noted, the original recipe calls for too much liquid.  Additionally, it desperately needs flavor!! Add salt, onion, garlic, coriander, pepper, etc. to taste.  Wound NOT recommend it as is.

Very good. Did not add veggies as my kids would not have eaten it.
