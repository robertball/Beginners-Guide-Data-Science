This was so very good.  I baked my fish first at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes then put on topping and broiled for about two minutes. Turned out perfect.  Thanks for sharing.

*Please note I did not follow the recipe, I changed the ingredients, thus the 5 star rating*

I took the grouper fillets and seasoned them with salt, fresh ground black pepper, Emerils bayou blast, and lemon juice.  I then added 3 medium-large size shrimp on top of each fillet. Next I melted 2 Tbsp butter, and added 5 tsp flour to the melted butter to make a smooth paste, I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp Emerils bayou blast, 1 1/2 Tbsp parmesan cheese and 1/4 cup milk, and mixed this together w/ some  chopped shrimp.  I poured the mixture on top of the fillets, covered the dish w/ foil and baked for 25 minutes at 425 degrees.  
Not sure what the original recipe tasted like, and I know I didn't follow it...but there's something about mayo on fish that just doesn't sound appetizing!

Excellent!!! I grated a very good parm cheese for it, I saw a similar recipe and it had green onions and chives in the mixture so I did add that (personal preference) highly recommend!!!!!! I was skeptical the mayo just didn't seem right to me but it was fabulous. Everyone on here should rate a recipe based on the original recipe and state if you add or subtract, don't ever give anyone a bad review when you have changed the recipe so much it is not even close to the original!!!!! Please that is common sense and courtesy!
Even though I did add the onions and chives this would have been great without the additons, this one is really good people!!!

This was excellent. I loved it (which I guess means 5 stars!). I’m not a confident broiler, however, so after brushing the grouper filet with olive oil and seasoning on both sides with sea salt and freshly ground pepper, I baked it at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes. (Cooking time will obviously depend upon how thick your filet is and the degree of doneness you prefer. I prefer mine DONE) I took it out of the oven at this point, switched the oven to broil, and coated the fish with the mayonnaise, Parmesan and butter mixture. For a little color, I added chopped fresh parsley and paprika. Don’t overcoat the fish – you’ll just waste your precious ingredients because as it heats a lot of it just melts off. I slipped the pan under the broiler for just a couple of minutes, until the fish was golden brown.  I spend a good deal of time in SW Florida, where grouper is common and plentiful, so I know that the success of the dish depends largely on the quality of the filet used. Fishy tasting grouper is NASTY. Avoid any filets with grey areas or at least discard that part! I got lucky, and the fish I used was fresh and delicious, and only enhanced by this simple recipe.

This was just "okay" for us. My 5 year old didn't like it. My other two ate it, but nobody LOVED it. If I make it again, I will probably make a few changes. I think it would be better with some crispy bread crumbs or panko flakes. The topping is good, but the texture of the fish needs help.

We went fishing and caught 100lbs of Mahi and came home looking for a recipe. I know this one says Grouper, but we tried it anyway... OMG it was so good and so easy. A Must Try!

This was awesome!  We had bought some grouper yesterday and had no idea what to do with it, so I found this recipe and gave it a try. WOW!  We loved this and would highly recommend this for grouper or any other mild fish.  Great recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing.

Amazing!  I'm not a big fish fan, but this is by far the best tasting fish I have ever had.  My husband who is not big on compliments said that the fish was "excellent."  The only thing that I did differently was to sprinkle a little bit of Emeril's Essence on the fish before the initial broil.  This is definitely going to be added to my "all time favorite recipes."

We used Ranch Dressing instead of mayo, less fat, and more flavor, and added some panko bread crumbs to the Parma cheese mixture.  My kids loved it, and Hubby did too, it is a keeper.
Baked at 400 for 12 minutes, put under broiler for 2 minutes after adding cheese mixture. Browns nicely!

I usually don't try recipes that have not been reviewed by others, but I was feeling adventurous...and it was well worth it. This recipe was easy and turned out delicious. I would have liked the parmesan sauce to be a little thicker, but it still tasted wonderful.

First time reviewing a recipe..I LOVED this one with a few modifications. As someone else suggested- bake @ 400 for 10 min and then broil for 2. Absolutely no need for mayo, just leave it out. Mayo is meant for cold preps -sandwiches and potato salads, not hot preps(baking). I'd not mix the cheese with the butter, just sprinkle it on top after you baste the butter. Otherwise gets lumpy and does not cover the grouper evenly. This grouper is absolutely the best I have ever had- moist and DELICIOUS!

Our neighbour dropped off 2lbs of grouper he had caught yesterday. Between the freshness of the fish and this great recipe I enjoyed the best grouper I've had for 5 years of gulf living.

This is the absolute best recipe I have tried from allrecipes.  I used the suggestion of baking the fish at 400 for 12 min, then broiling with the topping, it was wonderful.   I served it with farfalle pasta with brocolli and fresh squash sauteed with garlic and lemon juice.

Okay, so maybe it's just me, but not a big fan of the mayonnaise/Parmesan combination. The only thing I eliminated was the hot sauce (because I didn't have any) but I substituted with a little paprika and cayenne pepper. I pushed the topping off, and I ate the fish as is.

What a great change of pace for grouper! Full of flavor, however, I would use 2 Tbsp mayo instead as the mayo taste was a bit overwhelming. Good recipe though!

Great! I had to make a few substitutions: used assiago cheese, baked for 12 minutes at 400 then broiled as another reviewer mentioned, added pine nuts on top. (Watch carefully for overbrowning if you try this.)  Used creole spice mix and a few dasheds of cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce. Got rave reviews, I'm saving this one and will repeat! In FL, grouper is on every restaurant menu, this was better than any I've had out.

I am always looking for fish recipes since I know it is good for me, even though it's not my favorite. This recipe was very good and I would make it again. I thought the mayo would be weird, but it gave the topping a sort of creamy consistency, which I liked. Also, I have a brand-new oven and my fish was still mostly pink after 6 minutes-- I ended up cooking it like 20 minutes. Overall, very good.

This was a really yummy way to make fish - I used frozen grouper that I thawed in some milk and added 1/2c. plain bread crumbs (might have needed only 1/4c.) to the recipe after reading some of the reviews. That worked well to hold the topping on the fish. Even my husband enjoyed it and we are both fairly picky fish eaters - though grouper is a favorite.

One of the most delicate fish recipes we have ever tried. We brought back grouper from Fl, used it, creating a better fish recipe than we had at any restaurant at the coast. I did use a dash of Essance.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  My husband, who usually goes for fried fish, thought it was great! The kids loved it, too! I broiled my grouper about 5 min. and it came out perfect!  I ended up adding 1 large clove of garlic to the cheese mixture...yum!  Thought maybe some sauteed onions in the cheese mixture would be good, too.  Will try next time!  This recipe is a keeper!

We grilled our fish first and then threw it in the oven under the broiler with the topping. As suggested from other reviewers I added panko.  This was a wonderful dish and will make again! My two yr. old loved it and asked for more! That makes one happy momma:)

When you balance taste and ease of preparation, this dish deserves high marks. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that mine profited greatly from suggestions from other reviewers. I applied a liberal amount of Emeril's seasoning and baked mine at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. I added the mayo/Parmesan coating with Panko and several additional drops of hot sauce and broiled the grouper for 5 minutes. It turned out great. I was looking for a new way to prepare simple fish fillets, and I'll definitely try this again, with tilapia and other mild fish.

I thought this was WAY too salty with all the parmesan cheese. I was nauseous after I ate it and won't make it again.

Loved it but made some changes, instead of broiling the fish I baked it for about 25 minutes at 375, just put the lemon and salt and pepper on it.  Then I put on the topping, with a little extra cheese on the top and broiled it, got all melty and good.  I like my fish done well that's why I baked it, sometimes when I broil it doesn't cook on the inside.  Loved it, so did the family, gave the recipe out to friends, good reviews.

Modified the recipe according to other recommendations, so that's why only 4 stars...but it was a HUGE HIT both for me and my husband! The amount of sauce seemed too much, so I only slathered on half of it and topped with bread crumbs before going under the broiler. FABULOUS! A Keeper! Thanks!

Truly my new favorite fish to eat thanks to this recipe! The only other way we've ever had Grouper was Grouper fingers, and I truly didn't think I would be able to do the 80lb beast justice when we caught her, but I still packed her in the freezer and now all that meat is like gold due to this tasty recipe! Now I just have to get an oven on the boat and we'll be set when we go back to catch more...

To cut back on fat and calories, I used half the recommended Parm, butter and mayo, a little more lemon and plenty of black pepper and garlic for flavor (I had only 1.5 lbs fish).  Also added 1/4 cup panko to the mixture and topped the fish for the last min of cooking.  It was pretty and tasty with just the right amount of crunch.  Will definitely make again.

this is sooo good!! i only changed a little bit about it. i did not add lemon juice because i didn't have any on hand, and it turned out fine. to add some more flavor i added 2 tbsp minced garlic and 3 tbsp finely chopped sundried tomatoes. it's very good and very easy.

This recipe is a definite keeper.  I used frozen grouper.   It never has had a good texture when I've cooked it previously.  I followed the suggestion of cooking the fish w/ just the lemon juice for about 14 min. before I broiled it.  After broiling it was hot and very delicious.  I didn't have hot pepper sauce and used a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes.  Thanks for this recipe!!

We enjoyed this and will make again with some changes.  I added some minced garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, and a dash of lemon pepper seasoning to spice it up.  I also added some lemon juice to the sauce as well as the fish.  I bought imitation crab meat and put it on top of the grouper before pouring the sauce over it.  With the crab meat, it was delicious.  I also reserved some of the sauce, heated it over low heat in a saucepan, and poured it over the ravioli I served it with.  Yum.  It turned out great.  My husband really enjoyed it and he is not typically a grouper person.  He says he'll eat grouper anytime if I make it this way!  We really liked the flavor of the sauce.  Very versatile and would also be great on chicken.  Another plus:  Super easy to make.  It took me a grand total of 30 minutes for the entire meal, and that includes cooking the ravioli (store bought pre-packaged portobello mushroom kind) and almond green beans.  Easy and fast!

Since I dicovered this recipe we have it once a week. I use flounder or snapper files instead whole fish  because it is more readly avaible in this area. I also use light mayo and use smart balance butter to keep it lighter and more healthy.

Looks very, very similar to Broiled Tilapia Parmesan found on this site.  Which was very good!  There are tons of ways to tweak this.

Excellent!!! Made as written--except added 2 ingredients fresh parsley and chives to Parmesan/mayo mixture. My husband this morning is asking if next time I make grouper if I will make it the same way.  It was outstanding!

I made this with grouper and cod and baked it at 400 before broiling it like some other reviewers.  I also used lime juice instead of lemon juice.  Added some other seasonings: parsley, oregano, basil and cilantro.  Family loved it and the sauce over brown rice.

I needed a quick idea for a grouper dish and this was perfect.  I had a Manchego Cheese and ranch dressing on hand  Doubled the amount of cheese.  The cheese made this dish amazing.  I'm sure the parmesan is great too or any favorite cheese probably works.  We grilled our grouper and then used the oven just to broil the cheese mixture till bubbly and golden.  BEST GROUPER we have ever had.

Excellent! Made this for dinner on Good Friday and it was so delicious I wished I would have had it every Friday night during Lent. I changed the recipe a little by adding dill to the cheese mixture and seasoning this fish with seasoning salt, pepper, garlic, and dill.

This is an absolutely awesome dish! Not only is it delicious but very easy and quick to prepare! My family usually prefers fried grouper. Tonight, my husband fried his and my sons while I prepared my fish using this receipe. When they tasted mine,they decided the next grouper dinner will be broiled!

Rich taste of parmesan with the flavor of the grouper.  Restaurant quality based on the quality of your cheese and fish.  I loved it.

I loved this recipe...it gave a really nice flavor to the fish. Here in Qatar they call the grouper...Hamour. It is very popular here and I could not stand it baked, till now! Thanks for the recipe.

Yum, I made a second batch with the other half of a large fillet.  I softened the butter with a tsp or so of anchovy paste and backed off on the salt.  Yum...

Excellent. My husband and I both loved it. I halved the recipe, also used reduced fat mayo. The fish took twice as long to broil the first round.

The sauce is alright.  Next time I might keep the parmesan out and sprinkle over the top of the sauce so it is distributed more evenly across the filets.  My filets and my sauce took longer to broil than the instructions.

Very good recipe! We've made it twice.  This time around I added Emeril's Essence (as other reviewers suggested) just prior to broiling the fish the first time and added one small shake of hot sauce to the cheese mixture (also reviewer suggested).  The addition of those two will make this pretty good recipe a 5.

Great, easy recipe. I followed the recipe except instead of salt and pepper, I added about 1/4 t. of lemon pepper and some garlic powder to the butter mixture. Also I used 4 to 5 dashes of hot sauce. (cholula is my favorite.) This would be great on boneless chicken breasts and shrimp too.

Thank you JOANG2. This is such a good recipe. With so many possibilities. I varied it by broiling it with the hot sauce and lemon juice first. Then, I added onion, garlic, and mint to the topping. It melted in my mouth.

I did add 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder to the parmesan mixture, some panko breadcrumbs to the top of the fish, and sprinkled some fresh shredded parmesan on top of the fish. A keeper! Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious  will make again I did make some additions and change.
I baked in 400 oven for 15 minutes after basting with lemon juice, salt,pepper, garlic powder and paprika.  
I added to sauce italian spices , garlic powder and chopped fresh ginger root,   added chopped yellow squash and planko crumbs on top of fish for crusty texture. and cook 4 minutes under broiler.

This recipe is quick and simple. A neighbor brought me some grouper fillets from a fishing trip and I decided to try this recipe. I didn't have fresh Parmesan cheese in the house but I did have a "canned" version I keep around for spaghetti. This dish got a "two thumbs up" from the man of the house.

I've made this 3 times! My family and friends LOVE it! Great job and great recipe. I usually make adjustments, but all I can say is that I used less butter. Thank you.

no mayo ( if it was it would have been olive oil mayo, and only one tablespoon ) used only 3 or 4 drops of lemon juice. what are you eating, lemon mayo cheese melt with some grouper ?  I did add more regiano plus the lightest dusting of Italian bread crumbs. I also baked the fish only a couple of minutes. just to begin melting the cheese slowly , then I cranked on the broiler to get the cheese browned fast without  overcooking the grouper. I was using a convection oven so the process was very quick

Easy and excellent recipe.  I did leave out the tabasco (due to allergy.) We will definitely be making this again!

This had my picky husband singing praises! I added my own complete season instead of just salt And pepper and I used franks hot sauce ( my favorite) also Himalayan salt is what I use daily. I used pre-grated Parmesan  from a tub that air had. I covered it with parchment and foil (To keep the aluminum from leaching into the food) and baked in the middle of the oven first. I had thick steaks. Then I broiled until the topping was baked. Delicious. Sorry I don’t  have exact times. I don’t cook with exact measurements. I just know when it’s done. It was more than 10 minutes I know because I wanted it to be cooked through. A+! I can’t wait until my husband catches another grouper to make this. The one we used was black grouper he said. I’m sure it will come out good with any. This is my first time cooking grouper any other way than in soup.

Wonderful! Great flavor that did not detract from the flavor of the fish. I used red snapper and served it over a bed of grits. Will do again for sure!

I’ve tried this recipe several times and it is excellent.  Cut down the amount of butter and added some cracker crumbs to make the topping more substantial.  A favorite for any fish for our family.

Made it as directed.  Did cut fillets in half to make sure it cooked through; it was the best fish ever!  Making it for every Friday during Lent.  It will be my "go-to" recipe whenever I can purchase grouper.

Super delicious. I made it exactly as written.  Those who are shy about cooking with mayo-  don’t be.  There is something about mayo that isn’t what you imagine; I’ve used it in some really weird recipes with tasty results.  This topper was so good on the grouper that I will definitely use it on other fish like tilapia or swai.

Made this first time tonight for dinner.  Absolutely loved it.  My husband was skeptical because of the mayonnaise, but first bite erased any doubt. It was delicious! Can't wait to make for dinner guests.  I did have to broil the grouper for almost 15 minutes.  Guess what I bought was thicker than what the recipe had used.

Oh my goodness! This recipe is delish. My husband raved over it and we agreed it was better than restaurant quality. The only thing I did different was add some white wine to the roasting pan with the grouper. I baked it at 400 degrees for 8-10 min. Then brushed on the topping and broiled for additional 3 minutes. I will definitely be making this  recipe again!

I found this recipe to be a quick, easy answer to feeding a group of fisherman straight off the ocean with their own fresh catch! The topping is rich and makes the flaky fillets into a hearty meal.

Made the same as recipe. Grouper is too expensive... It was edible but it reminded me of scrambled eggs with cheese and not a good piece of fish. Won't be making this way again... Fish doesn't need cheese that's after trying... Live and learn it's all good

It was great! I don't even like fish and I enjoyed this. The outside was flaky and crispy, while the inside was mild and juicy. I myself halved the amount of mayo and sprinkled the parmesan at the end, but ultimately, it was very nice!

I really liked the recipe and the taste was great. If you try it my only advice is to try to use the perfect size pan where the pieces of fish are tight.  I used an oversized pan and  The topping can melt into the pan.  No big deal.

Easy and Delicious!  I did add a little Italian bread crumbs to the parmesan cheese which tasted good.  I will make this again!  Would be a great entree for company, because it is easy and impressive !  I would recommend using fresh local grouper.

No changes except that my quite thick filet took longer to cook. I switched from broil to bake  and then back to broil for the topping. It was soooo.....good! Thank you for the recipe. Easy and delicious. !

I used the suggestion to bake it at 400 degrees, then broil for two minutes.  Obviously, the thickness of your fish dictates how long you should bake it.  The broiled topping was excellent!  Thanks for sharing!

It was excellent. Great flavor. The topping enhanced, but did not overwhelm the fish.

I do not eat dairy so substituted vegan mayo, reduced Parmesan cheese to 1/4 cup and for hot sauce used Korean Gochujang. Recipe was excellent.

Loved it!  I used very fresh, thicker cuts.  It was fabulous.  I broiled it on a broiler pan on the lower rack on LO until flaky.  Then I turned the broiler to HI and put it on one rack down from the top.  You have to watch it closer, but it was wonder.  Squeeze a little fresh lemon on it an you are good to go!  I served it with Glazed Julienne carrots and some diced potatoes  that were very good.

Made as is, sprinkled a little bit of breadcrumbs on top before second round of broiling. Came out great! Fish was too thick for the broiler,  so I switched from broiling to baking after 5 minutes under the broiler.  Yummy and thx for sharing.

I brushed the fish with melted butter and seasoned it with salt and pepper and baked it as others had done, and pretty much followed the recipe as written the rest of the way, although my butter was melted instead of softened. The result was delicious, succulent grouper that tasted as rich as if it were Imperial Crab.
For those who think mayonnaise sounds gross on fish, do you use tartar sauce? This is not much different than that. It makes a luxurious sauce. We will definitely make this again!

Made this tonight and it was delicious!  I crushed 22 Ritz Crackers and mixed it with the Parmesan Cheese mixture. Increased the cooking time another 5 minutes.  Everyone loved it! 
Another easy and delicious recipe :-)

This was excellent. I think you could leave out the butter or most of it. I had a really thick grouper fillet and baked it at 400 for about 20 minutes, putting the sauce on for the last 5 minutes.  I also seasoned the fish with Old Bay after lemon juice.

This was awesome. Its my first time broiling ANYTHING, let alone fish. I must say this dish is very exact and very tasty. the 6 minute 30 second time of cooking is very precise. My husband who HATES all manner of seafood enjoyed it. Highly recommend. Compliments to the chef!

I only had 2 grouper filets that were less than a pound so I halved everything else.  I also added a TBS of powdered Ranch dressing.  I only needed to broil about 5 min. with the lemon and then about a minute with the topping.  This was very tasty and will be a go to recipe.

This was delicious!  I just wish I'd read a few of the helpful reviews first, because broiling didn't seem to cook the fillet properly.  I would definitely bake it first at 400 degrees, then top it and broil it.  As it went for me, trying to broil first, the fillet was still raw in the center even after several cooking time extensions.  I then wrapped it in foil and baked it, but it lost the beautiful look of the baked topping.  I spooned the topping back on when I ate it and wanted to lick my plate.  I'm sure this will be good on other types of fish as well.  Tasty!

I used frozen boneless, skinless filets, and may not have thawed them quite enough, so after baking at 400 for 10 minutes they were not done. I put them back in for 2 minutes, then another 7 minutes before they were fully cooked (could flake with a fork). Then I broiled on high for 2 minutes with the topping (made exactly as specified by the recipe) and it was perfect. I topped it with a bit of chopped fresh parsley and served on a bed of rice. I actually used spanish rice, since that's all I had on hand, and it was actually delicious together. My husband, a grouper groupie, wants this again as well!

Loved it! Next time I think I'll go easy on the topping, it's very rich, but very tasty!  I used fresh squeezed lemons which gave it a real nice flavour. I broiled for about 7mins and then another minute or so once the topping was on.

This was so easy and so good! I baked it at 400 for 12 minutes as others had suggested and then broiled until brown:) It was delicious. I may use the same seasoning on every thick, mild, white fish!

This was really good actually. I followed the recipe exactly except I did bake for 10 or so minutes and broiled for 4 minutes. We had thick filets that were fresh caught by us in the Gulf. We added Panko to the mix and glad we did. I don't see how it would all stay on and crust up if we didn't. Next time I will add more Panko but no other changes. Thanks you. We made Grouper 3 ways as you can see in the picture.

Very good and fast, replaced the mayo with cream cheese and added a little bit of dill. Not sure about the time, had to just keep an eye on it.

It is very tasty. A good parm is a must and if your fish is thick, it should be cooked for at least 8 minutes per inch.

This is delicious! Followed the recipe with some minor changes: I seasoned the grouper with cracked black pepper along with the lemon juice before broiling. Then we added Panko bread crumbs in the cheese mixture (as another reviewer suggested), using the same amount as Parmesan cheese. Tastiest grouper we've ever had. So easy! The splash of hot sauce really gives it a nice flavor. Thank you for this recipe.

My husband gave this one a "10," and he's pretty picky about his fish. This was super easy and fast. We will make it again. I didn't add enough hot sauce, so I might spice it up next time. I used fresh parmesan and low-fat mayo, cut back on the butter a bit.

Nice recipe, which has a great flavor, and is super easy.  Two comments on preparation:  (1) Make sure your Grouper isn't too thick, or you will have to substantially increase the cooking time. (2) When you add the cheese mixture to the top of the fish you might dab off any standing juices so that it adheres well.  I also sprinkled some bread crumbs on top to give it a bit more texture.

This was a great, easy way to prepare grouper.  I live on the Gulf coast where grouper is quite plentiful.  I was skeptical of the mayonnaise but it gave the dish a nice creamy topping.  My food critic husband was full of compliments!

We love this recipe. Works on many kinds of white fish. Amazing on grouper and halibut, can even use on tilapia. Even my kids (who don't like any fish besides sushi) will eat this fish without complaint. I make the full recipe of sauce, but never use it all, my kids end up putting more of the raw sauce on it after cooking. E

It took a bit longer to cook than 6 min, my grouper was thicker.  Nonetheless, it was excellent.  (I skipped the salt and pepper - it was great on it's own.)  Served with a side of spinach and sliced tomatoes, I'd serve this for company.

Awesome. We cook lots of fish and experiment with recipies on weekend. I Googled for something for nice fillet of Grouper I picked up at our fave fish store on way home. Followed recipe exactly. Key eval criteria: both our teenage girls LOVED it. We did too. Way over the top flavor, with potential to play w/sauce mix to taste. Combined w/simplicity, this is a big winner. Thank you!

Wow, found this recipe and immediately used it for my Grouper dinner..absolutely delicious! Ended up just mixing ingredients to taste but it was pretty easy to get the taste I wanted and went sooo well with the fish.

I made this with some fresh grouper I got at the market, and it was so good, I had no leftovers for lunch the next day! (I normally make 4 servings for the 2 of us every night because I love leftovers).  It was super easy to make, too!  I didn't have any tabasco, so I substituted sriracha.

Easy, tasty, with a zing!  Love Grouper, but not always available at my local Grocery Store.  I may have baked first, and broiled last few minutes with topping.  Needed more of a crunch.  Hats off to this receipe for ease and flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly as written...I'd rank the flavor at a 4 stars, maybe 4 1/2 stars, but I give it an extra star for the simplicity and ease of the recipe.  I cooked the mahi my hubby caught on an overnight fishing trip. I had all the ingredients handy and it took less than 10 minutes to cook!  Hubby & I loved it!

This is a great recipe.  As stated by marie22 in the previous review, I think this would be good with any meaty fish like halibut.  I used a single large fillet of fresh grouper.  Because of the thickness of the fish, it took about 20 minutes just to get the fish done enough to put the topping on.  Overall, a fantastic recipe.  Even the non-fish lover in my family enjoyed it.

Great!  Baked at 400 for about 15 minutes then broiled for 6 minutes.  Delicious! Used a lemon/soy sauce mixture to dip in.  God bless.

Very good and made with grouper and tile fish. I had to cook the fish for about 7 minutes and cooking the topping for 1 min. didn't taste so good, so I put back in the oven until it was really brown/bubbly and it then tasted great.

I baked the grouper for about 5 min (because it was pretty thick) then broiled it for 5 min, & I used a powdered hot seasoning. I followed the rest of the recipe as directed. My husband loved it!

This was awesome!!  I've never cooked Grouper before, but this was easy and delicious.  Even the family members who didn't like fish loved this dish.  The only problem I had was the timing.  It took about 10 minutes to cook and then I had to flip the fish and cooked an additional 3 minutes before adding the parm sauce.  It was probably because these were really thick fillets.  Either way, this recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for posting!

Absolutely delicious! I ended up using tilapia instead of grouper because the grocery store was out. My father and younger brother, both extremely picky eaters, came back for seconds!! I'll definitely make this one again.

I thought this dish was delicious. I used freshly grated, good quality parmesan cheese and served with parmesan/herb flavored couscous.  What a light and delicious meal and so quick to prepare.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this tonight, and it came out nearly perfect. I think there's a few flavors that are missing. For example, I put about a teaspoon of minced garlic and a teaspoon of ground pepper and it brought out a nice flavor. Also...lol..I used Mahi rather than grouper. The grouper was still in the freezer, and didnt feel like a defrost...the mahi was fresh.

It's ok.  I think the proportions could you some tweaking. There was too much parmesan and too little mayo.  It was a thick parmesan paste.  The fish does need to be lighly salted or else this can be a bland fish dish.  I brushed the mixture onto the fish and baked it for 10 min. at 400 degrees.  Overall, it's a quick dish to make but lacking in flavor other than a strong parmesan taste.

I have made this recipe several times - each time was excellent except today, as I used grouper that had been frozen in my freezer for I don't know how long.  Cutting to the chase, this recipe will only be good if you use fresh fish (as is generally the case).  Grouper does not keep well frozen.  I believe that the previous commenter may have used non-fresh grouper, as she mentioned that the texture of the fish needed help.  The fish texture was not bad because of this recipe, but more likely, because of bad fish.  As I said, this is an excellent recipe, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has access to fresh grouper.    I like to serve it with a caesar salad.

This was so yummy! My husband said it was probably the best fish he has ever had. I added garlic and onion powder and also sprinkled a little fish seasoning on the top. We will be making this one many more times!

Our fillet was 2 lbs. and nearly 1 3/4 inches thick and very fresh. The cooking time increased to 18 minutes. The first few bites I was unsure. The parmesian taste with the lemon took on a strange sour fishy taste. But the rest was moist, delicate and flavorful.
