I just have to add my two cents worth and say how absolutely AMAZING these cookies are!  I've baked them three times in the last two days (see, I told you they're amazing!), each with a different balance of spices (once as written, once with the addition of some nutmeg and allspice and less ginger, and once with more molasses and the addition of nutmeg), all with spectacular results.  Some things I found helpful: 1) I baked them on parchment paper for exactly 13 minutes...perfect every time!; 2) I used a 1" scoop and then rolled the cookies in sugar on the non-flat sides; 3) I used the back of a wooden spoon to flatten a bit before baking, and 4) the longer you beat the shortening with the sugar and egg, the crispier and more crumbly the cookie.  They do look exactly like the photo, and as perfect as something manufactured commercially, but with a MUCH better taste.  Thank you, Larry, for what is now probably my favorite cookie recipe!

I've been looking for a gingersnap recipe that makes a crispy, crunchy cookie, and I'm happy to report that this is DEFINITELY it!! A few notes for those who are looking for that familiar degree of spiciness that leaves a bit of warmth in your mouth after the cookie is gone; add a couple of shakes of cayenne pepper to your dough and mix well. You can also use ground white pepper. Many folks think they need to use more ginger, but 1 Tb is plenty for the size of this recipe. More ginger won't give you that zing, but pepper will. The recipe made 40 perfect little disks. I rolled them in sugar laced with more ginger, and flattened the balls slightly. They baked up nice and flat, looking much like the commercial variety, with a far superior flavor. Thank you SOOOOoooo much for this wonderful recipe. The one I've been searching for for decades!

Amazing! I have been looking for a thin crispy gingersnap recipe and this was perfect. I did substitute real butter for the shortening to eliminate any trans fats.

This is an excellent recipe.  It tastes just like the ones you can buy in a bag at the grocery store.  Using vegetable shortening is why their so crispy.  One note, if you want them nice and flat, once you put them on the cookie sheet, flatten them slightly.  Or, when they have baked for half their time, remove sheet from oven, and gently "drop" or "bang" sheet on counter 1 or 2 times, and cookies will flatten. I have used this recipe in a cooking class and it's always been a success.

This is an awesome recipe!!  I made it 4 separate times during the holidays and they were devoured each time!  They are perfectly crisp, perfectly spiced...... all fingers and toes UP!  5 stars!!!!!

12/11/15: 8 years later & these are still my favorite ginger cookie! Best gingersnaps EVER! I roll them into tablespoon sized balls, dip top in colored sugars & then flatten slightly on pan with a glass. This gives them the perfect crunch outside & slightly soft inner. Yummy yum yum!

Outstanding is not a strong enough word!  My son is a pumpkin pie fanatic but after these, he has a new favorite dessert.  I followed some of the other suggestions listed.  I baked it on parchment and added a touch of nutmeg and cloves.  I also flattened them out a little before baking.  I couldn't believe how easy they were to make.  Best cookies I've had in ages!

These cookies look beautiful but they aren't a flat crispy cookie.  They are chewy and puffy. For a more traditional gingersnap I would add a little nutmeg and maybe cloves.  I had to cook these significantly longer than 12 minutes but that might just have been because of my oven.  Overall a good cookie and a nice change for the holidays!

Sooooo yummy! I could not resist eating two! I just made these this afternoon and they taste great right out of the oven! Instead of shortening, I used softened butter and I also added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves. I also did not roll the cookies in sugar. Instead of shaping into balls, I rolled all the dough out onto a floured surface to about an 1/8 inch thickness and cut the cookies with a 1 1/2 inch biscuit cutter. I baked them at 350 for about 10 minutes each. It made about 6 dozen cookies. Please note that you do NOT have to refrigerate the dough before making them this way. I absolutely loves spiced baked goods and these are the best! The amount of salt is perfect, the contrast (salty-sweet) is great!  I will most certainly be making these again! Taste just like store-bought gingersnaps without the preservatives and other fake ingredients.

These were so yummy.  I had to increase the cook time by about five minutes to get a firmer cookie.  But that was fine with me because they SMELLED AMAZING while they were in the oven!  My family went through a double batch in no time.  This recipe was a huge hit in my house.

Very Yummy, just as I remember them at Grandma's house.  I added a touch of fresh groung nutmeg and used organic dehydrated cane sugar ( much better for you then white sugar), then pressed them flat before putting them in the oven.  For some added holiday fun, I dipped one half of each cookie in melted white chocolate.   mmmm!

I substituted Butter for the Shortening.  HEre is a very good article http://www.melindalee.com/resources/reference-center/cookie-tips/ on how to get a crispy cookie.  Basically  shortening will make a softer, puffier cookie and butter will make a crispier one.  It was great with the butter.

thanks for this recipe. i like ginger cookies but its so hard to find in Malaysia. i tried the soft ginger cookie recipe here but i like it to be crunchy. thats why i tried this one, but its weird coz the only difference is the 2 cups of flour instead of 2 1/4 in the soft cookies. to ensure crunchyness, i added 1tsp of emplex in the flour mix. molasses also is so hard to find here, except the blackstrap at organic shop. so i sub the molasses with dark treacle. i like mine to taste the spices more, so i roll the balls in 2tbsp sugar + 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp ground ginger, and keep adding in that portion untill all the dough finished. another thing is, coz i see the dough is too sticky and dont wanna get my hand messy, i added 1 tbsp of flour, then the batter is just fine to roll in ur palm. thanks so much for this recipe, now i make my ginger cookies myself :)

HOLY COW! Absolutely fantastic. For some reason, I was hesitant about making gingersnaps, but these turned out perfectly. I did follow the hint about beating the sugar and shortening for a good long time, and I flattened them a bit with the bottom of a glass. I baked them for 11 minutes, let them sit on the pan for 2 minutes and transferred to a rack to cool completely. I wanted to try one, and looked for a "bad" one, but there werent any! Every time someone eats one of these delicious confections, Larry gets angel wings for posting this recipe! I will be making these cookies over and over again!

Came out flat and crispy just like a gingersnap is supposed to!  I took the suggestion of others to beat the eggs into the shortening/sugar mixture for a bit longer to get it to bake out crispy.  Mines rolled out perfectly (they weren't sticky).  This is a super easy recipe!

Very good recipes! I made these today and my family is gobbling them down as I write this!  I will be making more again today as I was making these for a pumpkin cheesecake recipe for the crust.
  I added the following, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp clove, & 1/8 tsp of all spice. 
 My kitchen smells so YUMMY..
 Thanks for the recipe~

Just perfect!  I wanted them to be flat so I flattened them out rather than rolling into balls.  I cooked for 10 minutes and they came out slightly chewy which was wonderful. I added ground cardamom just a teaspoon and the flavors all blend very nicely.  I think this will be my new annual Christmas cookie

Easy and tasty!  These may be the fastest cookies I have ever made and they turned out great.  If you like them "snappy" make them a day ahead.  I enjoyed them warm and soft but the next day they were much more along the lines of a traditional gingersnap.

I made these and rolled up in balls, dipped in sugar (per recipe) then I put them in a bag and baked off 4 at a time so I wouldn't eat too many! They are more chewy than crispy. And I did make some right away and the ones I make a month later tasted exactly the same as the ones I made the day I first made them.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because they were made for my husband and they were not to his liking. First of all, my husband LOVES ginger cookies and is very particular about how they should be. He said these cookies did not have enough ginger in them (even though I added 1/2 tbsp. more ginger plus some allspice AND black pepper).  Also, he likes his cookies VERY crunchy and these cookies were crispy on the outside but chewy inside.  I guess I will have to continue my search for his perfect ginger cookie.

DELICIOUS!  If you love almond as much as I do, try adding 1 tsp almond extract and 1 cup sliced almonds.  The ginger and almond flavors compliment each other in a delectable way.

Oh wow...I used to dislike gingersnaps very much. A friend of mine told me they were his favorite so I tried this recipe. I'm glad I only baked half the dough tonight; he can't pick them up until tomorrow, and these are likely to be gone by then. SO delicious! Following other reviewer's advice, I worked the shortening, sugar, and egg for a good long time for crispiness, added a little nutmeg and allspice, flattened before baking, and baked for 13 minutes on parchment paper. Perfect. I guess I never liked gingersnaps before because I had only had the store bought kind in the past. Thank you so much.

This is amazing! I used to think gingersnaps as crunchy-only cookies with a bite to it and nothing else. But these changed my mind. I'd baked them when I was down with a cold and after eating a few, my stomach literally started warming up; I could feel the heat curl in my belly and that was wonderful considering how miserable I was. I made two half-batched, one rolled in sugar, one without, and to be honest, I prefer the one rolled without sugar. You can really taste the bittersweet and spicy taste to them without the outside coating. I later made a match with just a touch of cinnamon on the outside and that was probably the best since I adore, adore cinnamon. Excellent recipe!

Delicious!  Watch the time on them.  My oven temp. might be a bit off so I only cooked them for 8 1/2 minutes and they were perfect.  Ten minutes was just a bit too long for mine.  They taste so much better than the ones in the bag!!!

I cut the sugar in half.  Used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  Added about 1/4 cup chopped candied ginger - DELICIOUS!

These are baking right now and they smell HEAVENLY!! I substituted butter for the shortening 'cause I haven't any on hand. Other than that, followed the recipe and they are really, really good. And easy! Thanks for the great recipe.

These are pretty good. I use light brown sugar, less ginger, and some cloves. I use fresh cloves and ginger, but dry ginger works just as well. Also I use butter in everything. Im not sure why people flatten these before baking for there is no need. Just roll them in sugar and pop in the oven, they rise, then fall and crack and they're done. These are amazing with tea!

I changed this recipe just a tad. I added 1.5 tbs of ginger and also added .5 tbs of ginger to the sugar which u dip the rolled dough in. I also flatend the cookies to my liking and then coated on sugar. baked for 6 minutes and then lightly flatend with the back of a spatula and baked for 2 more minutes. just the way i like alot of snap and thin and crispy! A+ loved by all!

While these were not as thin and therefore lacking the real potatochip-like crisp I was looking for, the taste was really delicious. I'll save this recipe for a slightly thicker version and also add an extra 1/2 teaspoon or more of spices.

Excellent recipe! I've also tried using baking powder instead of baking soda to make them less flat, and that's also good.

turned out pretty good! I used butter instead of shortening, and used about twice the ginger (since I like my gingersnaps gingery). My only complaint is that they do taste a bit oily--only a bit, though. :)

I have made this recipe a few times now but I make some changes.  I double the recipe and do half shortening and half unsalted butter.  I also use half dark brown sugar and half white.   it adds some richness.  Finally, I triple.the ginger and add about 1/4 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.  it gives a little.spicey kick but it is a nice finish and not too much.  If you want thinner and more iniform cookies be sure to press them down before baking. They are always a hit!

While these cookies were very tasty and nice and crispy (I used 1/2 c. shortening, 1/4 c. butter), they did not have quite the zing I was looking for.  Even though, after reading many of the reviews here, I increased the spice amounts and added allspice, nutmeg, black pepper and even a bit of cayenne, they were not spicy enough for our likings.  I will keep this recipe on file but my next attempt will most likely include some crystallized ginger and a lot more cayenne.

These are delicious! I used coconut oil instead of shortening, half cup brown sugar half cup unbleached sugar and I ran out of malasses so substituted maple syrup for the balance of the 1/4 cup. They turned out great, can't wait to eat them with coffee on the morning.

Just made these today. They are wonderful! I will certainly be making them again. The true test is when my husband gets home tomorrow to try them. They are not spicy at all though. I think I'll be adding something to them next time. I think I'll go a little less on the salt too. Just a personal preference though. 
For all those that are saying they aren't crispy enough. Let them sit for a day or two. They get crispier. The inside chewiness dries up and crisps up quite well. I tried baking for 10 minutes and for 12 minutes. It didn't make a difference, after a few days of sitting they all are the same. 
Adding… my husband liked them, but also agreed they weren't like the store bought ones. I'm trying another batch today.

Just fixed these yesterday.  Followed the recipe but added a touch of cayenne for added snap.  Excellent recipe.  My husband does not usually like gingersnaps but he loved these and wants me to make them again!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

Delicious, I have made this twice in the past week, the first time I shaped into balls and flattened with a sugar dusted cup bottom, and the second I rolled into gingerbread boys and girls we then decorated, this cookie is fabulous both ways; oh and I doubled the ginger the second time, extra spicy, yum!

These gingersnaps are soooo good!   I added extra spices, a sprinkle each of cloves, nutmeg, cayenne pepper and white pepper...  gives it extra spiciness!!!   I also flattened these cookies when placing them on the pan.  I only fit 9 to a smaller cookie sheet/ 12 to a bigger cookie sheet as they spread a lot.   Yumm-sters!

Thank you so much for this recipe!  I tried another Ginger Biscuit/Cookie recipe for my partner and well...it was rather horrid.  So after careful perusing of the many recipes, I settled on trying this one.  Let me tell you...he has raved about them and said they were better than store bought ones!
My adjustments were heaps more of the ginger/spice (B/c he loves that!) and I did not have molasses, so instead I used Golden Syrup.  I'm not fond of ginger cookies myself, but these....these were excellent!

I have 2 young children and they loved these cookies.  They were easy enough to make that the children were able to help me.  They each grabbed one right out of the oven and I had to tell them no more after they each grabbed a second one.  We will definately make this recipe many more times as a fun edible craft.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to take care of a snack and craft in one fun sweep.

The cookies themselves were very yummy, but try as I might I could not get them crispy, which was a problem, since I wanted to grind them and use as a pie crust.  I have no idea how anyone could have burned these.

These burnt too easily and were really bad - I think I'll just stick with the box I buy at the store.

These cookies are not too bad except I used butter instead and they weren't crispy rather chewy and tender.  I was dissappointed.  Otherwise they were good.

These cookies were very good. I made the recipe exact as written. I pressed them down with a glass after rolling them in white sugar. They baked in about 10 min. They did spread a bit, which I liked. They were crisp on the outside edges and chewy in the middle. They will be good for making ginger bread people.

Delicious gingersnaps, exactly the way I wanted them. I made a few changes, though: I rolled dough into 1.5 inch balls and flattened them before cooking. I increased cooking time accordingly, 14 to 16 minutes. Tastes a lot like Belgian speculoos. 2 thumbs up!

A friend and I had a sudden craving for these one day and I had never made them before.  Of course I turned to Allrecipes to find a recipe.  These were absolutely wonderful!  The only things I did differently was grating a little fresh nutmeg in with the dry ingredients and flattening them out a little before baking - I just happen to like them very crispy.  When you do that you really have to watch them carefully so they don't burn, but they were yummy!  Definitely will be making these again.  Thanks, Larry!

The best gingersnap cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Watch the time while baking, though - one minute means the difference between a chewy cookie and a "snap."

I have been looking for a crispy ginger snap and this one is perfect.
Followed some other reviewers suggestions.
Will make again. Went with cayenne pepper and it was borderline too much kick. Will make this recipe again

Made these for my girlfriend and her family. They loved them. I used butter since I had no shortening. Crispy edges and soft center. So good! Will definitely make again.

These are just like the ones from the store in the brown bag. I substituted natural cane sugar and used only half the salt. I also increased the ginger to 2 tablespoons and added a pinch of fresh grated nutmeg and a pinch of cardamom. I also used real butter instead of shortening. My first batch burned at 12 minutes so I baked the remaining for only 10 minutes and they were perfect! They were crispy at 10 minutes and chewy at 9 minutes. I love them both ways. I will make these many times again. Thank you Larry!

A massive hit at work. In fact I have to make more because my co-workers ate all of them in record time and left none for me! I give it four stars because I did have to make some changes. Butter instead of shortening and I followed other's advice and worked the butter, sugar and egg for a good long time. I chilled the dough for 5-10 min and then rolled it to cut into pretty shapes. Keep an eye on them in the oven because edges on intricate shapes can burn quickly. They came out thin  and crispy. A nice light cookie but still strong enough to dunk in tea.

I made these exactly as the recipe said, and while I'd give the flavor 5 stars, they are definitely not crispy. Not sure how I can change it to make them get a nice crunch, but I'll give it a shot because the flavor is perfect.

This is the best gingersnaps recipe I have been able to find. I use butter and no problems with the recipe. Sometimes I also add a touch extra ground ginger for a little extra burn.  Pretty failsafe recipe.

I made another recipe first, which included ground cloves. The cookies were good but I really wanted a crispier cookie so I found this one. Just easy and delicious. I flattened the cookie ball and flattened it with the bottom of a glass. I then gently pulled the cookie off and placed one side in Sparkle Sugar. 
They were a big hit as gifts.

Didn't get the crinkle effect I wanted. Tried different temperatures and/or longer baking time. Ended up baking for 13 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  Will add another teaspoon of ground ginger next time, but they were very snappy.

Yummy and we add cloves and mixed shortening and butter to recipe.  Doubled it up and put brown sugar on top.  Crispy on outside and and a little chewy on side.  We love ginger cookies at my house.

Perfect crisp cookies. Used all butter, added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves, flattened balls a bit with bottom of glass, and baked on parchment exactly 12 minutes. Let sit on cookie sheet a couple of minutes before removing to rack. Crisp and crunchy when cool, not chewy, just the way my husband likes them. I think with a little white pepper, as suggested by another reviewer, they would taste exactly like the store brand boxed gingersnaps he loves. Great recipe, thanks!

Please stop comparing these delights to a store bought cookie!!!.I was hesitant to bake  with shortening instead of butter but I  always follow a recipe as written the first time anyway..   I measured carefully except for a generous  tsp. of cinnamon.   As recipe was written, I would rate 4 1/2 stars. Second half added pinch of pepper because I like a little kick and added few grates of nutmeg and a pinch of cayenne in the rolling sugar.  Also flattened with bottom of measuring cup  Wow     10 to 12 minutes 325 convection oven on silpat  and they were  crispy on the outside with chew on the inside, Beautiful cracks and delightfully flat. An hour later they were perfectly crispy. It doesn't matter how they keep there won't be any left tomorrow. If I wasn't avoiding  trans fats I wouldn't try to change the recipe, but  tomorrow I will try these with butter.The texture and flavor of this cookie surprised me.

Fabulous and simple! I substituted unsalted butter for the shortening, because it's a hay oven had on hand. They came out just crispy enough on the. Ottoms and outside, but slightly chewy on the inside and oh so pretty!

My mother used to make these over fifty years ago, but I didn't have her recipe. These are the REAL DEAL, and I'm so glad to have found my favorite cookie again after all these years.

I used coconut oil instead of shortening, which makes them crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  PERFECT.

Perfect! Easy and quick; my young son helped roll the balls in the sugar and flatten them with a glass. I doubled the ginger and added 1/4 tsp cayenne, as some other reviewers suggested. They are being gobbled up by my entire family, and not in the least bit spicy -- just gingery and great!

Love these cookies. Great taste and easy to make. I added a little more ginger, just because I like a little extra. They come out looking perfect and definitely use parchment. Thanks for the great recipe!

Perfectly Crispy. I love them, but will reduce the salt next time, if I add any at all. The overall flavor is delicious, but has a strong sensation of salt in the after-taste. Outside of that, I would have give a high-five and a 5 star salute.

Crispy, chewy, spicy, delicious cookies! I did substitute butter for the shortening (personal preference) and add 1/4tsp each of cloves and nutmeg.

This recipe was great! I did add 1 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I don't usually make cookies with shortening, but the previous recipe I made with butter came out so flat! These had great taste rose well! I will use this recipe again for my Holiday baking! Thank you :-)

Substituted butter for the shortening.  Doubled the ginger.  Didn't dip in sugar.  Rolled into balls, then smashed them down flat on a cookie sheet lined with Silpat and baked at 350 in top third of oven for 10 minutes.  Crispy on the outside and a hint of chewy on the inside.  Perfection!

Time to buy a stand-mixer.

I have never cared for gingersnap cookies, but I made these for my mother-in-law's mother.  Maybe I'd never had a good gingersnap before because I liked these a lot.  They do not taste overly gingery, but I also used a store brand ginger so that could be it.  Very easy to make.  I think I got well more than 7 dozen from this recipe.

Wonderful recipe!  Make them small for thinner, crispier cookies, bigger for chewy ones.  I also suggest adding a half teaspoon of cloves and an additional teaspoon of ginger.  And lard or butter rather than shortening.

This is identical to my grandma's gingersnaps -- one of my all-time favorite cookies. I have been making it for almost 30 years and it doesn't get any better than this. Everyone I have made it for loves them!

I made these cookies yesterday.  Today, when I came home from work, my husband said "I think you need to hide those cookies."  He has never asked me to hide anything with sugar from him before.  :3  These cookies are awesome.  I made another batch today with only 1/2 cup of shortening and they turned out beautifully.  Thanks for the awesome cookies!

These hardly need any more accolades, but I just have to put in my two cents' worth. A perfect 5. I flattened these before baking. The first batch was not very dark and are a bit chewy. The second batch turned out quite a bit darker and crispy. Either way, absolutely fabulous. Just the right amount of spice. THANK YOU!!!

These cookies have good/great texture but not the taste I was looking for.  Way too much salt and not enough spice. I am looking for an almost 'hot' (but still sweet) gingersnap so will maybe add fresh ginger and a little black pepper and definitely cut the salt by 1/2.

This really is a great recipe. I'm not a fan of gingersnaps in general, but I couldn't stop eating these. I didn't sprinkle or dip in sugar, and I did add a little bit extra flour from reading other's reviews of how greasy they were. Overall, fantastic recipe that will be my go to recipe for gingersnap cookies.

These cookies are phenomenal. I added just a touch more ginger (I like it strong!) but otherwise didn't change a thing. These are by far the best gingersnaps I have made - this recipe is a keeper!

The cookies were really good. They were very easy to make, I handed out the ingredients to my daughter (6years old) and she mixed everything together and enjoyed it. To make it a bit spicier I added some ground black pepper. There's no need to flatten out the dough after dipping in sugar it spreads out just fine.To make it crispier mix the shortening sugar and egg for a slightly longer time and then leave the dough till it's slightly browning round the edges not as soon as it puffs up and starts to crack, otherwise it will be doughy and soft - unless that's how you'd prefer it. Great recipe. Thank you!

Somehow I missed reviewing these up til now!  I made them at Christmas time and they turned out great!  I was in search of a CRISPY gingersnap with a lot of ginger flavor...not just another soft spice cookie.  These were the ticket.  I did bake for very slightly longer then recommended...and left them on the cookie sheets for a bit after taking out of the oven.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

My Gosh, is this recipe great! I never commented on a recipe on this site before, but I just had to add my praise for this recipe. I found this one last Christmas, and my family LOVE these cookies. I just made some for a Christmas party at work, and 2 people have asked me for "my" recipe. You will want to double the recipe after you taste these. If you compare the other gingersnap recipes, you will see that there is more ginger in this one. The cookies are both chewy and crispy but not brittle. They are easy to make, and my results have been perfect every time. Just follow the recipe and you can't go wrong!

The yummiest, crispiest gingersnaps! I did manage to burn the first batch but for the second, I made larger balls and kept a close eye on them. Turned out perfectly, just like the pictures! I did add extra cinnamon and a 1/4 tspn of allspice. Added great bite! Will be making these again...especially for my mom as she loves crispy cookies. Thanks Larry!

WOW!  This is a terrific recipe - we love the way these gingersnaps turned out.  Thin and crispy on the edges - maybe the entire cookie will turn crispy once they cool but we couldn't wait that long.  I used unsalted butter for the shortening and also let the cookies set on the sheet for a few minutes after they came out of the oven.  Don't be concerned when they look puffy as you take them out - once they start to cool they flatten right out.  Absolutely a keeper!

Really great cookies... thin and crunchy, just as they should be.  I used a good deal more spice than the recipe calls for (cloves, nutmeg, black pepper).

ok-these are awesome! made for catered event to serve w/raspberry carmel brie.  I found putting sugar for the dough in a flat bowl.  Roll cookies by the dozen setting in bowl with sugar.  Press down gently into sugar and they come off on your fingers easily transfered to sheet.  saved time!

Baking these for ten minutes gave me cookies with a little crunch on the outside and soft in the middle.  At twelve minutes they're crunchy "snaps."  I love them either way.  Even when they're not completely flat, they're crispy, and the flavor is wonderful.  Not excessively spicy, but I think they're just right.  I'll make them again and again, even though I hate the smell of molasses and ginger!
