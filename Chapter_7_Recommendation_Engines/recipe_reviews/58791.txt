This is basically the same recipe as my Filipina sister-in-law's, only we add lemon and/or lime juice to the marinade.

We also marinate this for at least 4 hours and usually for 24 and cook it indoors in the oven broiler. And you MUST serve this with rice!

AWESOME!  I made this with filleted pork loin and grilled it outdoors- it was great!  Served it with "Sweet Potato Salad with Chili Lime Dressing" from epicurious.com- it was a FANTASTIC combination- thanks so much!!  No changes needed- but add the juice of a whole lime at the end with a sprinkle of cilantro on top.  YUM!

This is wonderful and my husband loved it. I used pork sirloin which was very tender and tasty.  I added some golden syrup to sweeten it and used fresh ginger.  I also used low-sodium soy sauce, and I'm glad because it was very salty - next time I'll cut out the salt.  I also added some fresh lime juice to the marinade.  After adding the fresh lime to the cooked product, I also added some dried parsely for color.

This would be great on beef or chicken, also!  Yummy!  Thank you!

Sort of an odd combination of flavors, but not altogether unpleasant. The meat was very tender.

I thought these were really good, not quite as good as the meat on a stick I found in the streets of a lot of asian countries I have traveled to, but at least I know what kind of meat this is...lol

Very good though very salty.  I would leave out the salt next time.  Tastes a bit like bacon - yum!  My husband didn't like it. : (

This was just ok. I thought there were too many conflicting flavors going on. It might have been better without the soy sauce. Thanks anyway.

My entire family enjoyed this dish very much. I did not feel the need to change the recipe and was satisfied with the results. Served with two tone baked potatoes recipe also from this website. A Great combination!

Made the recipe as is except for eliminating the salt and  I used low sodium soy sauce. This recipe was sooo salty and not impressive at all. I will not make this recipe again.

This dish waws fantastic!  The only thing I did different was used pork tenderloin instead of pork butt and then followed the recipe exact.  Made it for company on the grill & everyone raved about how great it was!  Will be making again!!!!

We made this last night and it was just delish. Had a few skewers left this morning and ate more with some eggs. Can't wait to share with the rest of my family.

I rate this a four because the flavor of the sauce is great, however since I do not care for pork, I used beef in place of it. I do not like pork, but from reading the recipe the sauce mixture sound great and I enjoyed it. I did not rate it a five because I did not try cooking pork with sauce.
