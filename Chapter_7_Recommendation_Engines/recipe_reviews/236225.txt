This one is very good, except, we forget the peppers.  One or two cranks on the pepper mill for course ground black pepper is all you really need.  Most of Chef John's recipes always call for hot pepper, but they really are not necessary.  I for one don't like to burn my taste buds to the point I can't taste the good stuff in his recipes.

OhMyGawsh Good.
Used fresh Dungeness crab. Used sour cream rather than creme fraiche and smoked paprika rather than Aleppo. Filling absolutely delicious. The crab salad topping was too spicy - I prefer to taste the crab. I will make these again - and soon 'cuz it's crabbing season - but will skip the crab salad... I'll top them simply with a lump of crab and sprinkle of fresh chives.

But you are so ate up with BS.  For instance, boil your eggs, timing them when the water first start to boil, for 7 minutes.  Then immediately pour out the water and run them under cold water to stop the cooking.  As soon as they are cool enough to handle, crack the shell and peel with the edge of your thumbs.  The eggs will turn out perfect with no pits or blemishes and the yolks will be golden and creamy.  If you do not intend to use the eggs immediately,  put them in the fridge with the shell on.  When you get ready to use them, you will find them so much more fresh than the traditional hard boiled variety.

This is a solid devils egg recipe.  I actually did not make the final touch and it was still excellent.  I'd recommend this recipe to anyone.  I'll be making this again.

Very enjoyable.  Everyone agreed bit of crab salad on top was the best part.

Made these to take to a holiday gathering. They were inhaled in minutes, and I planned for 3-4 pieces per person! Chef John is right: be generous with the crabmeat salad on top. Will definitely make again and not change a thing!

Just as other reviewers mentioned, the amount of mayo needs to be increased to have a creamer mixture.

Yummy, and a nice twist. They get a bit dried out in the crab if in the fridge for too long, but a few hours before is perfect.

A new holiday menu item. I substitute German mustard it gives it a bite on the front end and sweetness of the crab meat on the backside.

Crazy good recipe. I make deviled eggs frequently and wanted to mix it up. This recipe is a crowd pleaser.

Amazing! I love the combination of spices in Chef Johns rerecipes. They're always the perfect amount of heat for me and so flavorful. I didn't have Aleppo pepper, so I substituted for paprika and it was still excellent.
