Super yummy!  My kids and husband liked them.  I substituted 1/4 cup oat bran for some of the white flour, used egg whites only, no yolks, and thinned with water no milk, and no oil-just applesauce.  Tasted great, very filling.  Will make again for sure.  I have mixed up the dry ingredients into plastic bags so I only need to add wet stuff to make, much faster that way on the weekend for a quick breakfast.

This is a great and healthy alternative to regular pancakes. My two little ones, (29 months and 13 months old), gobbled these up!! Yes, I agree that they are tasteless BUT that is the fun part about these pancakes. My 29 month old liked them with blueberry fruit spread, my 13 month old liked them plain and my husband and I liked them with honey....everyone wins! To thin them out more I just used more milk and the batter was fine. I plan on making these pancakes agin and freezing them for a really quick, delicious and nutrious breakfast!

These were really tasteless pancakes even after I added vanilla for one batch and cocoa for another.  They were too heavy too.

Two out of my three kids loved these.  I really liked these because of how nutritious they were.  I will definitely be making them again.  Thanks for the recipe.

The only thing I will change in the future is adding flavored low fat yogurt to sweeten them up and give them a more kid friendly flavor without sacrificing their nutrition.

These were a big hit. My husband is a diabetic & has high blood pressure, so I appreciate that it had no salt or sugar. I used all WW Pastry Flour, halved the recipe, but worked with 2 eggs. I ground up dark brown flax seeds in my coffee grinder and added those in. I totally missed the canola, but we didn't notice. I had added a bit extra applesauce so maybe that took the place. I used more milk because WW seems to soak it up more. I was afraid that I had overbeat my whites because they didn't want to incoorporate for a while. But, the finished product was fantastic! Added walnuts for even more fiber. Great start to the day, thanks for sharing this recipe!

I wanted to make a special treat (fruit topped pancakes) for my youngest boy for his birthday (and his older brother as well) but I wanted to make it a little healthier than what I'd get at the resteraunt. This recipe was perfect. I used whole wheat white flour instead of unbleached, homemade organic applesauce, vegetable oil and lowfat buttermilk. These turned out fluffy and delicious. I made a low-sugar strawberry topping to put on the top of these and topped off with a small dollop of whipped cream--like the fruit pancakes that we used to get for the boys on their birthday at Sheri's. Quite a bit healthier but the kids never noticed. This made quite a few additional for me to freeze in groups of two to stick in the toaster for busy mornings when the kids still want a hot breakfast, too.

These turned out fluffy and very tasty.  The kids (4 & 6) thought they were great too! I did add a tsp of vanilla and made sure the egg whites were well whipped.  I loved a healthier alternative!

Delish! I stayed as close as I could to the recipe, though I had to use some vanilla yogurt + water instead of milk (last of the milk was sour--ick!) and white whole wheat flour instead of regular. But the resulting pancakes were delightful! I'll make them again soon.

Absolutely heavenly! I veganized the recipe by using EnerG egg substitute (beaten stiff w/ mixer) and almond & rice milk. I also added a banana. They were extremely moist and the fluffiest vegan pancakes ever! Thank you! This will now be my "go-to recipe!"

I just love this recipe.  Why should I add sugar when most likely I'll be topping them with syrup or something else that is sweet?  My kids love them and I know they are getting something that is a healthier alternative to your basic pancake mix.  Oh yeah, I also added ground flaxseed meal.  Enjoy!

Not a bad start but definately needs some more flavor; maybe a little salt and blueberries or even a few chocolate chips.  My 3 older kids ages 10, 8 and 6 did not eat these but my 16 month old did.

These pancakes were indeed fluffy and delicious, but I was disappointed we couldn't taste the applesauce. Maybe I'll try chunks of apples in them as another person suggested, or more applesauce as a topping. I used all whole wheat flour and they were still light and fluffy. Thanks!

I made them this morning and both my 2 yr old and 7 yr old loved them - the whole batch is gone between the three of us!! I had only 2 whole eggs in the fridge and a package of liquid egg whites to account for the rest, but even with an egg yolk missing they turned out well.  I also substituted cow milk with Almond Milk (unsweetened) and had to add a bit extra.  Next time, I'll add a pinch of salt - these would be great with shredded apples and cinnamon, or bananas as well!.  Thanks for a great breakfast! :)

GREAT PANCAKES!  I made the recipe as listed, just with a little salt added, and an extra 1/2 tsp baking powder (I like my pancakes REALLY fluffy!).  They were delicious, and very light and fluffy!  As a note, we had ours with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar on top and they were fantastic.

I loved the texture of these pancakes, but they cried out for a little salt! After tasting one, I added salt to the rest of the batter and they tasted MUCH better. I had to add extra milk and applesauce, and I still couldn't taste any apple flavor; I guess I'm not really sure if I was supposed to, but I was a little disappointed that I couldn't. These were good pancakes, but not the best. Thanks for the recipe!

I will not be making these agin.  They ended up tasting OK and we did enjoy them.  So here's why I will not be making these and simply cannot recommend the recipe;  1) the amount of dry to liquid were completely off; I at least doubled the milk its one thing to need to add a splash or two but to have to double the amount is an error in the recipe.  2) It completely lacks seasoning, we added cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and vanilla and they were still on the bland side of flavor (and I like whole wheat/'healthy' food so its not that I'm not used to eating more grainy food).  3) the need for two bowls and beating the egg whites, I figured I would give the recipe a shot but even with the 'soft peaks' added the pancakes were pretty dense, that combined with the additional work is unnecessary.   There are some good recipes for wholesome, filling, and yummy pancakes so I just can't be bothered to re-use this one again with the extra work and dishes for a lackluster result.  I don't regret trying them but they won't be a repeat.  Sorry.

I liked these.  I agree with another reviewer, these are more thick than fluffy.  I like thick pancakes, but I'm not sure it's worth it for me to get out the mixer.  I would make them again, but w/o beating the egg whites (I wonder how I should change the recipe/ratios?).  They are a little bland, but with syrup it hardly matters.  My 16-mo-old doesn't seem to care.  I did add some cinnamon, I think it was a good touch.  And in answer to somebody's question, I think the oil in the recipe is just for frying.

Quite tasty but I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a chopped peeled apple for some extra chunks. Yum! After making it, we all wished we'd added a touch of salt to wake up the flavors, but we'll we making this on Saturday mornings for sure!

I may have goofed the recipe, but I did not care for these pancakes.  They were more doughy than fluffy and were not very flavorful.

Wow - these were great! We had made applesauce from our slightly withered autumn apples a couple of days ago but didn't eat very much. Dad found this recipe this morning and served them to us. Definitely something to wake up to! The opportunity to add wheat germ and use up applesauce was great. The only thing to change... Mom wanted these thinner - they're probably 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, so Dad added some more milk. Beautiful and tasty nonetheless. Thanks so much!

okay for homemade pancakes. Not as fluffy as i wold have liked it to be though. Maybe it was my fault, but the store mixes have 10x more bubbles than what these made. good flavor and texture though.

I used an entire cup of homemade cinnamon applesauce and four eggs, instead of separating out the white and yolks. Flax seed instead of wheat germ and coconut oil instead of canola. My three boys loved them!

First I have to say I only had egg beaters so I don't know how much that effected the density of these. But, they were very dense and bland. I added more milk to thin them out. I ended up adding splenda, cinnamon, and vanilla and they were still kinda bland. Will not make again.

Nice pancakes.  I halved the recipe, then got a bit stuck on the egg measurements (halving results in 1 1/2 egg yolks, 1 1/2 egg whites).  However, I perservered anyway and ended up with (I think!) the correct ratio of eggs.  These are heartier pancakes, and I love that I can use my jar of applesauce in something else.  Bf liked them as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

The pancakes were incredible ! I loved them, but I changed the recipe a little bit. I made it only for myself so I made three pancakes, I put the flour kinds, 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk, a little bit of oil, backing powder and a small amount of cinnamon and rosemarie (for the taste). I baked it on butter. Taste 3 pancakes have come out. I cut a part of banana and honey and "decorated" it. I just finished eating and I feel full and as if I was in heaven ! Loved it! Everyone should try it ! They may be a  little bit tasteless for some people but I think that they tasted good anyway, and the good part about it: you can use anything you want to cover them. Plus they are a healthier alternative for the usual pancakes, and who doesn't love healthy and good tasting food?

The egg whites make the pancakes nice & fluffy. Since other reviewers said "bland", I added 1tbsp butter, roughly 1/2 tsp sugar, salt, vanilla and replaced 1/4 cup of white flour w/ almond and coconut flour. It did need a few tbsp of water as my batter was too thick. The flavor was delicious.

As others, I didn't use any of the oil but used applesauce instead. I also substituted 1/4 of the flour for oat flour and used only egg whites.

Also as a substitute for the oil, I used a no-sugar added, high protein banana yogurt we had on hand along with 1/2 of a chopped up (NOT mashed) banana.  Also added a tsp. of vanilla and soy milk until the consistency I wanted.

WOW!!!!  Super duper yum--this one is a keeper and healthy to boot!

These were delicious! I will add some sugar or syrup next time. But these are the fluffiest pancakes and semi healthy too! It's a win in my book.

I would have given this three stars, but I made two changes that probably made things worse: I used wheat bran instead of wheat germ, and didn't bother beating the eggs. The result was a very heavy pancakes. But with maple syrup it wasn't bad. If your kids need sweetness add 1 Tbsp of honey to the batter and serve with syrup.
