This is a wonderful way to eat kidney beans!  We skipped the sage and hot sauce cause the kids don't care for those.  We all loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was awesome! I did not use sage I used fresh rosemary instead and I used a can of light red kidney beans and a can of white kidney for some color. We really enjoyed this and its something different to do with kidney beans =)

This was very interesting, and pretty good, too!  I'm not sure that I would make it again, but it was a nice to have something different.

Surprisingly good.  I also added a bit of minced onion, and used two types of kidney beans for visual interest.  might add green or wax beans next time around.

This recipe is delicious - I've made it many, many times.  I always follow the dressing ingredients exactly.  I have varied the bean combinations and any are great.
I like extra vegetables and crunch, so I always add 2 chopped sweet bell peppers, 2 or more ribs of chopped celery and a couple of green onions. I find there is enough dressing in the original recipe to accommodate the extra ingredients nicely.

Woah, this tastes awesome! The title of the recipe seriously messes me up, because honey? And beans? Luckily it got good ratings, and I was out of everything I needed to make regular 3 bean salad, so I HAD to give it a try! So happy I did. Delicious, no hint of honey (I suppose it balances out the vinegar - so don't worry about eating sweet, cold beans!), and very flavorful. Followed the recipe exactly, except used only half the oil and added some raw onion. My new go-to bean salad recipe! Try it people, don't be afraid of it! :-)

This is an excellent recipe!  I added rice to the kidney beans just because I had some (and one of the pictures looked like it had rice in it!).  I didn't add hot sauce just because I was giving it to my little girls.  Other than that, just follow this recipe exactly.  It's so very good!

This has a wonderful flavor even without the hot pepper sauce. (I can't eat that as I am solanine toxic.) Today I'm making it with one can of dark red, one can of light red kidney beans, and one can of garbanzo beans to liven it up for a church potluck. It should be just as nice, as the liquid was ample for the two cans of kidneys in the recipe.

I just changed the oil to coconut oil and took out the hot sauce; I am not fond of spicy foods and coconut oil is better for my thyroid. I have diagnosed hypothyroidism.

I made this today using kidney beans, black beans and chickpeas.  My husband and I loved it.  I used garlic powder and added some onion powder and it was really good.

This salad is sooo fine.  I've made it numerous times now since first stumbling upon it.  I make it about once a week.  I've added macaroni and kale and an extra white bean and have used the two kidney beans.  I've made it so many times that now I have to get another large jar of honey from the grocer.

The ingredient list intrigued me, so I made half a batch (and added some chopped red onion, since the onion in the photo looked good and other reviewers liked that addition).  I made it last night to have for lunch at work this week and I must say that I really liked it.  I do feel sorry for any co-worker I breathe on this afternoon, but this was a healthy lunch that I enjoyed with some reduced fat pita chips.  Thanks!
