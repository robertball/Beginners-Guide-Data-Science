Not a sweet dough, it makes a good cookie for icing/decorating.  Dough was dry and hard to work.  I added less flour, which made them much easier to roll and handle.

I decorated my cookies with vanilla frosting, so I substituted the lemon extract with vanilla.  The honey is a great addition, and they turn out really crispy and keep forever.

I've used this recipe for many years and love it. The only thing I do is cut back a little on the lemon. Because of the honey these cookies turn out darker and with so much more flavor than regular sugar cookies. Thanks so much!

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but the dough was so gooey, we couldn't roll it. We ended up rolling them into balls and flattening them to make simple round cookies. I didn't like the lemon extract, either. Next time I'll try vanilla. It tasted too much like a lemon cookie. No bad, just not what I expected.

We had to use a lot more flour than the recipe said, otherwise it would have been too sticky to use cookie cutters with.  We used about an extra 2 cups of flour.  This is a basic sugar cookie recipe.

OMG!! it was so good! but instead of shortening we used butter and instead of lemon extract we used vanilla extract and then added real lemon juice. We also doubled the recipe.

I had the same problem with hard to work dough - too much flour.  I added another egg and have the dough in the fridge to "ripen", we'll see, I think it's going to be too sticky to cut with cookie cutters though...

They taste good and all but I could not use the cookie cutter.   Every time I would try to pick them up theyâ€™d stick. So I ended up with odd ball looking cookies. Nobody complained though.

Recipe tastes good, but cookies DO NOT take the form of whatever shape you've cut them into upon baking - they spread thin and crispy, but yummy.
