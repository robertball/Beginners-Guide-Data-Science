This was fun for the kids to do and they loved eating them too.  I used beef hot dogs.  You have to use the grand size biscuit.  The dough must be flattened out a bit first.  Even my four year old could handle this.  For added texture and flavor, I rolled the wrapped dogs in corn meal.  Very good.

Kids LOVED these.  I used low fat wheat biscuts and organic nitrate free dogs. Make sure to flatten the biscuts really well and make them into an elongated oval shape, that way the biscut will cook through and it will fit the length of the dog.  On ones that I didn't flatten enough into the elongated oval shape, the dough didn't bake all the  way through. Perfect on the ones I pounded thinner though :)

Awesome. My 5 year old loved them, and had fun making them! Only difference is we used 1/2 beef 1/2 venison hotdogs that we make.  And took someones advice and rolled them in cornmeal. Very good!

I made homemade corn bread mix and these were AMAZING. Even my non-vegetarian friends couldn't get enough of them. So easy to make and delicious!

I didn't find the corn biscuits so I substituted crescent rolls and pinched two together to form a rectangle sontheywere more like pigs in a blanket, but my kids still loved them.

This sounds & looks so good!! I cannot wait to try this! Vegetarian corn dogs are difficult to find in most local grocery stores & this sounds healthier, fresher & much tastier than ones I've had in the past.
