I would make this again. I tweaked it a little.  Baked the hash browns in the oven, in the bottom of my casserole dish after mixing them with a little olive oil, salt and pepper.  Mixed precooked sausage and veggies in with egg and cheese.  After cooking onion, I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and a big handful of chopped baby spinach.  Poured over hash browns.  Added a sprinkle of cheese to the top and broiled for 2 more minutes.  Great and simple ingredients in this recipe.  Lots of egg and less milk than most recipes.  I like that.

Great casserole! Easy to throw together with simple ingredients. Great ratio of bacon, egg and cheese. Thankful for a breakfast casserole without a bread base.

This is very easy to throw together and tastes very good too. I used russet potatoes that I grated into my salad spinner full of cool water - triple rinsed the potatoes using the insert as a colander and then spun them dry. When I make this again I don't think I would bother even pre-cooking the peppers and onions & a sprinkle of paprika on the top would be nice too. Thanks for a good recipe.

I was looking for a breakfast casserole recipe, and I am glad I chose this one. The proportions of eggs, potatoes, and meat were just right.  It took almost an hour to cook, but that is because it had been in the fridge.  (I made it the night before.)  I used a pound of sausage instead of bacon, and I used frozen potatoes o'brien (which already contained the onions and red peppers).   This recipe is a keeper.

Followed the recipe exactly except used country style potatoes instead of hash browns and it was really good. I will be making this again.

Made this for a brunch with a group of friends. Everyone loved it. 
But as we were already having bacon, I subbed the bacon for ground sausage. Also very tasty. 
I ended up cooking in an 11 3/4 x 14 1/2 dish, so it was a little bit thinner than intended, but I think it was hearty enough & it helped it cook through in 45-50 min.
Would make this again!

This recipe is just what I was looking for: a breakfast casserole with no crust that I could make ahead and take pieces to work for quick reheating.  My changes were that I used spicy turkey sausage instead of bacon, and I threw in one chopped, de-ribbed/seeded, fresh jalapeno.  YUM!  I wasn't able to find a package of hashbrowns at 16 ounces, so I got a 30 ounce package and eyeballed about half.  Honestly, I could have added all of it without overflowing the baking dish, and it wouldn't have been too potatoey (yep... just made that word up).
Helpful hints: if you are using an egg substitute, please note that 12 eggs comes to about 2.5 cups.  
In addition, I cracked each egg into a small bowl, and then added them one by one to the mixing bowl to ensure that no shell pieces got into the final mixture... easier to take a few pieces out of one small bowl before cracking the next egg than trying to fish them out of a huge bowl full of eggs. Also, I would suggest adding the seasoning to the veggies as you saute them... just easier in my opinion.

Best egg bake casserole  I've ever  made.  It was a huge hit Christmas morning.  I prepared the dish exactly as directed and served with salsa.  I rated this 5 stars which says a lot since I have tried similar recipes that we did not like nearly as much.  I prepared everything the day prior and baked it in the morning.

Love this recipe as is. I've even made it the night before, covered with plastic wrap and popped it in the fridge. Then in the morning its ready for the oven. Great brunch dish!

I served this Christmas day for brunch and everyone loved it! I always make the breakfast casserole with the slices of bread layered, but there's no comparison. This is our new family tradition! 
It did take longer than 45 minutes to cook. I cooked it for an hour and it was perfect.

I make breakfast casseroles often. This one has a very good texture and taste. I prefer less salt than the recipe calls for especially with bacon as the meat. I made this with ground sausage instead of bacon and it was good too. I plan to try ham next. I mix all of the ingredients ahead of time and keep in the fridge overnight, then I bake it in the morning if I am using it for breakfast.

Made for friends for brunch with two slight changes...no bacon but sauteed the sweet onion and red pepper in bacon drippings and used yukon style frozen hash browns (with flavors) and a cheddar / gruyere blend doubled the recipe and cooked in a very large/deep skillet for an hour. A HIT and a go to for a crowd and also excellent as a leftover..

I served this for Mother's Day brunch and everyone liked it. I made it the night before and was glad that I did as it took over 10 minutes to prepare due to having to cook the bacon.  I'd say that you can easily get 12 servings from this dish.  There were 8 of us and we have leftovers which is great.  Will make again

I baked my bacon in the oven in my large stone ware pan at 450 degrees and then poured the prepared mix right into the pan(after crumbling the bacon).  I subbed asparagus for the onion (my husband hates them).  I also just added a splash of half and half instead of the milk (it was too watery last time).  I also added garlic and onion powder.  Very good and made the house smell wonderful.

Can I just eat this all the time please?  It's a great proportion of egg v. cheese v. bacon and so easy to make.  Not to mention affordable and the whole family loved it.  I haven't rated a recipe in forever but had to leave this one 5 stars!

I'm sure that this recipe is excellent as is, but it is also one where you can make multiple changes and it will still be delicious!   I used only six eggs and the rest was egg substitute.  I also cut back on the bacon and added some fully-cooked sausage cut up as well as some chopped mushrooms and spinach.  Instead of sweet onion, I used green onions.  After all that it looked like it needed a few more eggs, so I added more egg substitute.  I had to cook it a little longer, but it was excellent!  I will definitely make this again.

Yum. I made this as written and my family loved it. It makes more than 6 servings - we had half a pan left after the 4 of us ate - but that's ok because it keeps for several days in the fridge and makes a good, quick breakfast. You could reduce the calories and fat by using reduced far cheese and turkey bacon or sausage.

This was delicious! The next time I make it, I will cut the amount of salt in half. The bacon adds a lot of salt to it already. Also, I will cook it at 375. In my oven it took longer than 45 minutes. I recommend the recipe!

This is delicious! Like some of the other cooks, I was glad to not have bread in there. I didn't change the recipe much. Didn't have any fresh onions or peppers, but used some onion powder. I left out the salt, because with the bacon and cheese I felt there was already enough. I cooked my bacon, sprinkled with some ground pepper, in the oven on parchment paper.  While the bacon was cooking, I prepared the rest of the ingredients. Used some of the bacon grease to lightly coat my pan. Added the cooked bacon to the mixture, then baked  for one hour. It had a nice crispy top, perfect inside, and everyone loved it. Will be making this again. Thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious!  Added a little garlic powder because I don't know how to cook without some form of garlic.  Took longer to cook up....an hour and the middle was still not fully set.  I don't think my hash browns were very icey so would probably only do 1/2 cup of milk next time.

This was delicious and a beautiful presentation for a morning brunch with friends. I tweeked a bit while keeping  the basic recipe in mind. I used turkey sausages instead of bacon (cut them up  into cions and heated through), added red pepper with the onions that I cooked slightly, threw in more cheese  and baked it. About 15 minutes before it was done i placed sliced tomato on top, a little more chees and finishec baking until browned. It was thick and delicious And everyone raved about it! It does take the whole cooking time so plan for that. You could adapt this to lots of different mix ins. I would definitely make it again when ive  got a large group to serve.

Mother's Day was perfect!! This was one of the best casseroles I've ever made and for breakfast /brunch, it was just what Mom loved.  Everyone raved about it and I will definately make it again. It was so easy, I've memorized it and have given it to my patients. Can't wait for another special occasion or Friday night dinner!

Excellent! Made this for brunch while a guest was staying with us. Prepared it overnight and put it in the oven while it was preheating. Total cooking time was a little over and hour. Pretty much stuck to the recipe, but added some chopped shallots and minced garlic to the peppers and onions. Also, some garlic and onion powder.  Used half egg substitute for the eggs. 
Will definitely make again!

SOOOO GOOD! I make this casserole for my family as often as possible and it comes out exactly the same every time....delicious. It's nearly impossible to find a breakfast casserole WITHOUT bread that tastes good. I omit the onions and dill to make it more appetizing for the kids.

Made this for our weekly Sunday brunch.  It turned out great and was super quick to put together.  I cooked the potatoes a little before putting it together and also made it the night before.  Cooking time was accurate when prepared this way.  I also used pre-cooked breakfast sausage in place of bacon.  I liked that it has a high ratio of eggs, giving it a good consistency.  Will definitely be putting this one in our breakfast rotation!

I used less bacon and that was a mistake....seemed a little dry and bland.  Would probably use more cheese next time too.

Made this for Christmas Morning. The family loved it! like others, I fried the hash browns first to make them a bit  crispier. I then layered the hash browns on the bottom of my baking dish and poured the egg solution on top. Served with some hollandaise sauce. Delicious!

I made this Christmas morning, it took much longer than 10 minutes to prepare and over an hour to cook. I liked the red pepper in it, but it came out soggy and mealy texture. But the flavors were great. This morning I pan fried it to heat it up and it was much better. Next time I'll fry the hashbrowns first to help with the sogginess, maybe less mill?  And put it together the night before and refridge it overnight to save time. I couldn't detect the dill flavor.

I made this for my wife on Mother's Day. I added some mushrooms, tomatoes, and yellow bell peppers to the  recipe  which added extra flavor. It came out perfect and was a big hit!  Will be making this a staple from now on!

I'm not a fan of breakfast casseroles, but this one I can eat! Not too bad. Five stars because I do actually eat this one and have made it a few times. The recipe makes more than my family can eat so I only bake half of it and freeze the other half for us to enjoy later.

I made this for Christmas morning and it was just o.k.  I omitted the red pepper and dill.  It took longer than an hour to fully cook and so the bottom and sides were a little dry and burnt.  I don't think I will try this again.

I changed this only by omitting the veggies (subbed the onion for onion powder) because I was making it for a middle school class breakfast. Everyone was raving over it! Even my  son who is INCREDIBLY picky loved it. Great recipe, thank you!

I’ve made this twice so far, and it’s been inhaled both times! Perfect balance between the eggs, bacon, and potatoes (nothing overwhelms) and reheats remarkably well in the microwave. I find it easier to cook the bacon on foil-lined sheet pans in the oven since there’s so much of it. Otherwise it takes a good hour to rotate a pound and a half through a skillet. I also don’t usually buy frozen hash browns, so the second time I just peeled and grated a pound of potatoes on a box grater (about 4 medium russets). Bake time varies by the pan you use. For me, it was 35 min in a disposable foil pan and 50 min in my 9x13 Corningware. Same oven. So just make sure you check on it and give yourself enough time. This is my new go-to for breakfast and brunch potlucks!

Awesome recipe! I did adjust down the number of eggs used based on other reviews.  So I used 3 eggs instead of 5.  I also put the topping to set in the refrigerator while the cupcakes cooked as someone else suggested.  This was absolutely a hit and I plan to make it again soon!

Made this recipe for an end of the year family brunch and it was a hit. The recipe says that it serves 12 but I wouldn’t say that’s the case (or we may just each too much). If it’s for a large group, I would almost suggest 2 trays. I also substituted the ham with turkey bacon but that’s more of a personal preference. Other than that.. It was great!

Excellent breakfast for all.  Sorry, I did make a couple of changes - which I always consider cheating - but I eliminated the dill and used 1/2 bacon and 1/2 sausage.
My family walked away smiling in their food comas.
We have a new holiday traditional breakfast!
Thanks for a great recipe.

Really disappointed with this but I know it can be better.  It doesn't call for enough cheese.  Next time, I'm going to put in two cups of cheddar.  It's bland so I might put in some hot sauce too.  You will need to bake it longer than the recipe states.  it's basically a quiche without the crust.

Was looking for a breakfast casserole that did not have bread and found this one. Made it  for a neighborhood get together. Everyone LOVED it. Made as is, but probably only put about a pound or less bacon. Will definitely make again. Thanks for a recipe that was a little change of pace!

I've been making this for years, my family loves it!  Tried with different meats, sausage and ham too. Cheddar cheese tastes the best but have used with motzarella. It's also good to use cubed frozen potatoes O'Brian when you don't have fresh onions and peppers. I always add a little garlic powder, garlic salt, and fresh ground black pepper.

This recipe was a huge hit for Christmas morning breakfast, I only changed a few things for the picky eaters, I omitted the red pepper, instead of putting the onion in the skillet I simply chopped it and added it to the other ingredients, I mixed up all the casserole ingredients the night before, and stored it covered in the fridge. However I cooked the bacon and put in in a separate container until the morning. On Christmas morning I put it all together, we opened presents while it cooked, super easy!

I added sautéed mushrooms along with the onions.  I made it the night before so I needed to bake it almost 1 1/2 hours to be fully cooked through. Family raved about the flavor and will make it again for Christmas morning!

I made this casserole for my workplace's annual holiday breakfast last year and it was all gone before the end of the meeting. I used green pepper instead of red pepper to give it a colorful presentation (since the bacon was already red) and it was both delectable and pleasing to the eye.

I added diced ham along with the other ingredients.  My family loved it.  It will be a staple at our brunch table.

It took longer to cook by nearly 20 minutes and the casserole seemed dry.  Needs more cheese or gravy on top.

Living overseas, I don't have access to all the spices, so I used merkén (a ground smoked red pepper) instead of dill. Huge hit!
