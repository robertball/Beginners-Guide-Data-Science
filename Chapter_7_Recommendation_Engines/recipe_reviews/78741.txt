Four stars as written, as I believe that with just  cream the sauce would lack dimension and would be rather flat. I embellished upon the recipe which made this dish a solid five star recipe.  The chicken, which I seasoned only with salt and freshly ground pepper, developed a much more appealing look and color dredged in flour before sauteeing. Once I turned it over I covered it just briefly to make sure it was cooked through. After removing the chicken to set aside, I deglazed the pan with about 1/4 c. of white wine, then added the cream, a good squeeze of lemon (didn't use the lemon pepper at all), and now the dill.  I used only two chicken breasts but kept the sauce measurements the same (essentially doubled the sauce), and it was just the right amount. If prepared with the amount of sauce as the recipe directs it would be pretty skimpy!   The chicken was moist, tender and flavorful, with a rich, creamy lemon/caper/wine/dill sauce that made an already good chicken something extraordinarily delicious.  I served this with cappellini pasta and "Spaghetti Squash Saute," also from this site. This was an outrageously delicious dish,  a definite "make again."   This cooking method and the sauce, by the way, would also be wonderful with salmon or other types of fish as well!

Made this for the first time tonight and it was fabulous!  I followed others' advice  and doubled the cream sauce.  I am glad I did that because we had exactly the right amount of sauce.  I would highly recommend trying this WITHOUT putting any flour/cornstarch in the sauce because it was perfect without it.  I usually like to try a recipe exactly as written the first time and then make adjustments (if needed) the next time.  However, without changing any of the ingredients I did them a little differently.  I marinated the chicken breasts in lemon juice for about 15 minutes and then seasoned them with ground pepper, sea salt, and fresh baby dill.  I diced one clove of garlic and added it to the butter that the chicken cooked in.  That was the only variation from the recipe that I made.  My husband, daughter and son-in-law raved about this one and instructed me to give it a top rating.  I will definitely make this many times again, it would be perfect for company.  I served it with steamed broccoli and lightly buttered penne pasta with fresh grated parmesan.

WOW!!! This had such fantastic flavor! I did make some changes to the recipe. I used chicken tenders instead of breast halves. I didn't have any lemon pepper so I used McCormick's Key West Spice Blend (lemon zest, basil and thyme) and added black pepper in it's place. I also deglazed the pan with a couple splashes of white wine before I sauted some garlic and added the fat free half and half, as suggested by others. It was outstanding! I have also substituted Tilapia for the chicken - YUM!

I'm here to tell you this recipe was elegant and exquisite!!! I made a couple of alterations: used heavy whipping cream, doubled and added 1 tbsp of flour to it for thicker sauce. Used a little Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning (we put it on everything in Louisiana!!!) in addition to the other seasonings for the chicken and sauteed freshly minced garlic before I added the chicken to the butter. Also cut the breasts into medium sized pieces and placed them back in the skillet with the sauce to mildly simmer for another 10-15 min. Definitely want some bread to dip in the sauce!!!

This recipe is very delicious and easy! My picky 9-year-old nephew even loved it. My husband soaked up every bit of the sauce (that I doubled) with his rice and went back for seconds. I also pounded the chicken breasts thin like other reviewers suggested. The chicken cooks up really quick and tender this way. Or, you can use the thin-sliced chicken breasts at the supermarket if you are in a hurry. I am going to try fat-free half and half next time for some of the cream. Thanks for the great recipe! Update 1/17/06-Made again tonite and used fat-free half & half and less butter- worked great. Also, lightly floured chicken with the seasonings and put some of dill directly in sauce.

For such a simple recipe, there was a lot a flavor carried in the sauce from the meat juices and fats in the cream.  I used olive oil instead of butter to add a healthier element to the dish   My husband and children LOVED this recipe, as did I! GREAT for a quick weeknight meal when you want to make it seem like you spent time in the kitchen...

My girlfriend LOVES when I make this for her, says that I'm going to spoil her! This is a great recipe that I only adjusted a bit after reading other reviews that made sense. Adjustments were: (1)squeezing lemon juice onto chicken breasts and then seasoning with (2) garlic pepper and dried dill weed. Then let sit 15 minutes. (3) NOT turning chicken more than twice. (4) De-glazing the pan with 1/2 cup Pinot Grigio and simmer down by one half before adding doubled recipe amounts of sauce ingredients and then letting that reduce a bit - as per directions. The thin consistency complaints I've read should be adressed by REDUCING, NOT ADDING STARCH OR FLOUR. This is a sauce and not a gravy! I like to serve this with an asparagus amandine and a cooked pasta sautéed with EV olive oil, butter, garlic and parmesan. The sauce just gets all over everything and is INcredible! Thank you mommyto2boys for this great recipe! You should let your husband browse for ingredients some more!

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes.  It is easy and very flavorful.  I don't think it would be quite as nice if you made it with regular milk and flour or corn starch as other readers have done.  Then it becomes gravy rather than sauce?

Delicious, simple, and served with garlic mashed potatoes or brown rice, it is real comfort food.  The cream is what gives this dish the richness it deserves....regular milk with cornstarch? Yikes!!

Delicious and easy! I sauteed some minced garlic in the butter before adding the chicken. I also used thin-sliced chicken breasts. Served up with some asparagus, and used the sauce on that as well. I would recommend doubling the cream to create more sauce.

In a pinch, mix 3 tablespoons of softened butter with 6 tablespoons of milk to replace the 1/2 cup of whipping cream.

What did I do wrong??? All the reviews were good and it seemed like a simple recipe but my sauce curdled!  I did use fat free half n half (and it was fresh) but other than that I followed the recipe.  The chicken had good flavor but I didn't even try to serve the sauce.  Any ideas on what might have affected the sauce?

I made this tonight for dinner and it was AWESOME!  I served it over egg noodles and added a little more capers.  I will make definitely again.   Wish i could rate higher.  One other change - because my chicken was still partely frozen I sliced into strips and sauted; etc.  - PS - I did double the cream.   YUMMY!!!

Made this this weekend while visiting my son and daughter-in-law.  The whole recipe just reminded me of something I had once in a nice restaurant that had mushrooms in it.  I crip fried some mushrooms and then carried on with the recipe exactly as written, adding the mushrooms back in at the end with the capers.  I served it on top of mashed potatoes with asparagus.  Absolutely and completely fantastic!!  My daughter-in-law has only dropped being a full vegetarian while breast-feeding and loved it so much, she has requested it for Christmas Eve!

We love this dish and make it often, sometimes twice in a week. We will make it for our family of 10 and everyone enjoys it. We always use more cream and capers to ensure there is enough sauce, otherwise we don't alter the recipe (unusual for me).

Delicious! I didn't have any lemon pepper or garlic powder so what I did was marinate the chicken in maybe 1/2 C lemon juice with the dill, and a sprinkling of adobo. Since I used heavy cream I opted to saute the chicken in olive oil and contrary to what a number of reviewers suggested I did NOT flour the meat-just browned it in the oil.  Removed to a plate and quickly sauteed some minces garlic before deglazing the pan with the lemon juice marinade. As suggested by some others I used a full cup of cream. I second the reviewer who said resist the urge to add a thickener. Just reduce the cream to a sauce-it's delicious like that. One more error turned good: I was rushing and didn't read carefully and instead of 2T capers I just dumped in the whole little bottle. I would probably do that again-we love capers! I returned the chicken to the pan which isn't quite as pretty but the sauce was so delicious I wanted to coat the chicken in it. This was so easy and so good it will definitely go to the repeat section. Thanks for such a simple and delicious recipe!!!

Really good but I'd leave out the salt completely.  Based on everyone's reviews that there wasn't enough sauce, I just doubled the cream and deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup white wine.  I tasted just before adding the capers and it obviously needed salt.  However, even the tiniest bit that I added caused the sauce to become overpoweringly salty.  Next time I won't add any salt at all.  Served over brown rice with a side salad and homemade french bread.  Will definitely be a frequent guest at our dinner table.

LOVED THIS - Husband loved too.  I minced and sauteed 2 cloves in the butter and chicken which added extra garlic flavor.  Will try reduced fat cream next time.... but am afraid to sacrifice flavor!!  This is a great recipe!

This is so delicious! I did increase the butter and cream by 1/2 so that we would have plenty of sauce. The only other change I made was to add a bit of dry sherry to the pan as the chicken was sautéing.  The flavor of the sherry was so subtle but it added such a nice touch to the sauce.

Very Good sauce, the only change I made was to add a can of drained artichokes, and a little more cream. The spice blend was the perfect amount and combination for this dish.

We LOVED this recipe. I used chicken tenderloins, as that is always what I have on hand. I dusted them with flour mixed with the lemon pepper and garlic powder. I just recently learned to like (love) capers, and this dish is wonderful. Oh I did deglaze the pan with extra dry vermouth, something I always have in the fridge, once opened, you can keep a bottle of it in the fridge for a long time, unlike opened wine. Thank you for this great easy recipe. We will be having it often!!

I pounded the chicken breasts and reduced the salt to 1/4tsp.  Served with red potatoes & "Garlic Broccoli Spears".  The sauce was really good on all of the meal.  Thanks, Mommyto2boys.

This was EXCEPTIONAL.  Based on the comments in other reviews, I dredge the chicken in whole wheat flour.  I don't like cooking with butter much, so I use canola oil.  I also deglaze with white wine and use lemon juice instead of lemon pepper.  "Caper Chicken" is now the boyfriend's favourite dish.

Very tasty.  I did not have any lemon pepper so I used regular pepper, and a squeeze of lemon.  I also had to substitute the whipping cream for half and half.  The sauce thickened on it's own.  Next time I'll cut the salt...not sure why but a little too salty.

I agree that this is a four star recipe as written, and I have mixed feelings about posting the manner in which I adapted it to our own tastes, because I know that many readers are critical of such a move. Usually, I make a new recipe exactly as written first, then make adaptations. I couldn't do that this time, because I had no lemon pepper, and I just did not want to use so much cream, despite the fact that I follow a low carbohydrate diet. So here is what I did: I poured half a cup of chicken broth into a small bowl and added the zest and juice of a medium lemon, then set aside. After I had finished cooking the chicken cutlets, I added two cloves of crushed garlic and the dill to the pan, let them sizzle for a few minutes, then de-glazed the pan with 1/4 cup white wine. Then I added the chicken broth/lemon mixture and whisked 1/4 cup cream into this, and added the capers (be sure to find the smallest capers you can). Let this cook down for about five minutes, then serve the chicken with the sauce. My husband, who is not an adventurous eater, loved this, and so did I. His got served with boiled potatoes. And we both had fresh green beans. I'll make this again very soon. Hope someone can use this modification.

This was delicious! I did cut the salt in half, just because I'd rather add it at the table if needed, and half was perfect. The browned pan from the chicken and the cream made a really tasty cream sauce. I've never had capers before and they added a unique, tangy flavor. My husband loved this, too. I will definitely make it again!

This was a great recipe! I really don't pay attention to the reviews when the original recipe has been altered! I like to follow the recipe and judge on my own after that. One ingredient added or left out can make a big difference! As with all recipes I think the amount of salt used is different with everyone. I will definitely make this one again and not pay attention to reviews!

This was a very easy and flavorful recipe. The minor adjustments I made: I coated the chicken in salt, pepper & an Italian herb mix and some shredded Romano cheese. After cooking the chicken, I deglazed the pan with half a cup of white cooking wine. I used light whipping cream and doubled the sauce like others suggested. To the cream I added the dill (I used leaves, couldn't find dill weed), freshly squeezed lemon (half) and the capers. After a few minutes, I reduced to simmer and put the chicken back in for about 15 minutes. The only problem I had was getting the chicken fully cooked-- they were thicker breasts and I ended up throwing them in the microwave for 2 minutes to get them up to temp. The sauce thicken nicely and it was so tasty. If you're not a fan of dill, you may want to reduce the amount, or only use 1 tsp. even if doubling the sauce.

4 stars for how it is written, 5 stars for my improvements....dredged in flour, salt and pepper, sauted in the butter, till browned. Removed from frying pan added 1/4 cup white wine to deglazed the pan, added double the cream, double the capers, dill, (I forgot the garlic), juice from 1/2 lemon (I do not care for lemon pepper) and fresh ground pepper.  Poured sauce over chicken breast.  Served with green beans and coucous! It was wonderful.

I tried this recipe and wow,had everyone raveing about it.. It was good. I only made a couple of changes. I used white wine to deglaze the pan and added mushrooms, diced garlic & olive oil instead of Butter. It was a hit. However you need use twice as much cream to get enough sauce. I will make this again.

This was delicious! Totally not as heavy as you would think with the heavy cream - I think the lemon lightens it up. Few changes made were: minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, lemon juice and pepper vs. lemon pepper; and I did de-glaze with wine. I also upped the cream amount to make more sauce. This will definitely be a staple in our house!

easy, tasty, but much too much salt.  This is regardless as to whether you rinse the capers.  Don't forget the Chardonnay it cut right through the cream.

This is fantastic!  I did make it my own by lightly dredging my chx in flour (as I always do to saute) and sauteing in olive oil instead of butter (only needed 1 T).  I didn't have lemon pepper or dill (and didn't want to invest $4/btl) so I omitted the dill and seasoned my chx w/garlic, s & p, then deglazed my pan w/some lemon juice before stirring in the cream (I used light and it worked just fine).  My boyfried could not stop saying "Wow, this is great!"  He finished the whole pan of chx himself!

Made this pretty much as written except cut the chicken in bite size pieces before saute'ing.  I deglazed with some white wine and served over whole wheat Papadrelle noodles.  It was nothing to write home about.  Hubby did not like it - said it tasted like it had mustard in it which he hates.  I think it must have been the capers which I normally love.  There are too many other good chicken recipes out there so I will not be making this again.  Thanks anyway.

So ask me if I'm surprised that 42,000+ have saved this recipe. Not! I frequently have made something close to this, using a bit of thyme instead of the mint, a little white wine, as another reviewer (probably lots) mentioned, and sauteing some mushrooms in the pan before added the wine and cream.
Now have tried it just as written here. And have added it to my short list of quick and easy chicken dinners that I have to fall back on when the need arises. Definitely a keeper!

YUMMY!  I doubled the sauce.  Also, leftovers make an EXCELLENT soup.  I served it with buttered fetticini, and "Daddy's Fried Corn & Onions" (from this sight).  After dinner, I threw all the leftovers in a bowl, chopping the chicken first.  The next day, I used butter, flour, chicken broth & milk to make a soup base, added the leftovers plus some chopped carrots.

This was really good.  I didn't use the lemon pepper - just a personal preference.  After cooking the chicken I used 1/4 cup of white wine to deglaze the pan - chicken broth would also work.  I added a squeeze of lemon juice to the sauce, which was amazing.  Thanks for a lovely recipe!

Fantastic, and now my fiancee's favorite dish. I have made several variations with the sauce, using half and half, whole milk, or heavy cream, depending on what I have in the fridge. I do cook my capers beforehand, usually but putting in with the chicken and letting them cook to make their flavor a little more neutral.  I also grate fresh parmesan into the sauce if I have it on hand.  We like to eat this with rice.

This recipe is SO easy and fast yet it is delicious!  I also doubled the cream sauce, 1/2 cup is not enough.  You don't have to have the capers - I like mine w/out but my husband likes it with them.  The dill weed is a must.  I don't especially like dill but in this recipe it is yummy!  I serve it over bowtie pasta and this is now a staple in our home!

This is a definite keeper!  Easy to make and quite tasty.  I added a bit of 2% milk and went heavy on the capers to increase sauce volume.  Other than that, followed the recipe to a "t".

This recipe was easy and quick to make, but hubby and I did not care for it too much.  The chicken with seasonings were good on its own, but the sauce wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Hubby said the sauce tasted "kind of weird". (But he's kind of particular anyway.) I added white wine & fresh lemon juice like others recommended, but it still wasn't a "wow" recipe (to us).  However, this was a quick and easy recipe, and can probably be spruced up with the right ingredients.  Thank you for sharing!  It really was fun to try this new dish, even though it didn't turn out the way we thought it would.

This has become a family favorite.  The dill seasoning makes it unique and I've even aimed for a healthier version using 1% milk instead of cream and it's still very good.

Yep.. another winner from allrecipes!  Thank you mom22boys!! My daughter had her bandmates here so last minute dinner for the gang.  Everyone loved it!  It was actually so good that they were asking me what capers are and about the dill etc.   Changes that I made.. real lemon, fresh dill, fresh garlic and doubled sauce.  Served over egg noodles.  Perfect!!

Great recipe.  I think it would be outstanding as is, but I hate to admit that I had my modifications:  I pounded out the chicken breasts and added minced garlic to the pan before cooking.  For the sauce, I first put in a splash of white wine, then fat-free half and half followed by a few drops of lemon juice.  Other than that, I followed the recipe...  Overall, a delicious inspiration!

I changed this a bit but kept all of the original ingredients. I added some white cooking wine after adding the cream to create more sauce, which I spooned over thin spaghetti and the chicken breast. I also added chopped garlic to the butter while the chicken was cooking. This was very good and my husband liked it too.

I'm with Naples 34102 on this one. Sauce amount is just right for 2 chicken breasts. I also deglazed the pan with about 3 Tb Chardonnay, and reduced it quickly until the vapors ceased to tingle the nose. Omitted the garlic powder because its taste is so polyester! The flavor of this dish is so nuanced that it doesn't need garlic, but if you like it, then I'd recommend sauteeing it crushed and finely minced before you cook the chicken. I added the juice of half of a lemon and added some finely grated zest, which gave a nice zing. Right before serving, I stirred in the tiniest dollop of Dijon mustard, maybe 1/2 tsp. It gave a little indefinable je-ne-sais-quoi. The dill blends beautifully with the lemon and capers, making this special enough for a company dish.

Fabulous!  I did make several changes due to other comments below; I used half and half in place of the cream and doubled it.  I also added minced garlic after the chicken was done.  And to the half and half I added 3 tbsp of flour because we like thicker sauce in our house.  Delicious!

I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, and deglazed the pan with dry vermouth before adding the cream, but those are the only changes I made.  Really easy, really fast, and really, really good.  My husband loved it and so did I. My son wouldn't try the sauce, but he's 16, so what does he know?  A winner, and one I'll make again.

Simple, Yummy, Affordable. . . 
What more could you want?
Absolutely lovely!  Didn't add capers, but did use some rosemary and a splash of marsala!   Served over a brown/white rice combo.  Will make again.  Make sure to totally scrape up and incorporate those drippings.  I covered the pan after first turn to keep moist.  Can customize easily with this easy recipe, I used skinless drumsticks, that's all I had, please try it, you'll be glad you did.

This is a great weeknight chicken entree that you can prepare in next to no time.  We liked this well enough that I'm going to mix up a triple batch of the spices, so the next time that I make this all I have to do is pull one bottle out of the pantry instead of four.

Really Good!
Only thing I did different is I used fat-free half & half instead of heavy cream.  Simmered down to a wonderful consistency.  Yum!

So Salty!! I will cut all the seasons in half next time. (I used peas instead of capers - can't imagine how much more flavor with capers!) Too much sodium and flavor for us. I can imagine a great dish otherwise.

This was well liked by my husband and two daughters. It was easy to make. I modified the recipe, as some other reviewers suggested, by dredging the chicken in seasoned flour to help the breasts take on a golden brown colour, and adding about half a cup of white wine to the pan after the browned breasts were removed to deglaze the pan and add more flavour. Thanks!

My newlywed husband eats everything I cook, but rarely does he ask me to make something twice. I cooked this meal last night and he said we MUST have it again!!! I took the advice to marinate the chicken in lemon juice and season it with salt, pepper and dill. I was out of fresh garlic like the other user suggested, so I used the garlic powder. It was delicious!!!

Made as is, seasoned a bit more than recipe called for and cooked the chiken longer than called for and it turned out amazing.  Served with my pan fried potatoes and california veggies.  Delicious and no one will guess it was as easy to make as it was.

Great chicken dish.  I pounded the chicken, so it was thinner.  The dill really gives it a slightly different taste than my other chicken piccata recipe.  My family asked for this one again!

I made this tonite, and it was so good.  My husband loved it, said it was the best chicken recipie yet.  On the advice of others I doubled the sauce (a must!) and deglazed the pan after cooking the chicken.  We will definately add this to our regular selection of dinner choices.  Very good, thank you for the recipie.

I have been looking for this recipe--we eat close to this recipe at a very expensive resturant and I finally found it.  I did change a couple things--I add sun-dried tomatoes to the sauce with the capers and once it's all put together I add a little feta cheese to top it off.  Truly and excellent gourmet meal!!

This was outstanding!  I doubled the capers, butter, and cream, and I added one large minced garlic clove to the butter before I added the chicken breasts.  I served it over garlic chicken Rice a Roni, with green beans and spinach salad with toasted pecans, sliced strawberries and Ken's fat free Raspberry Pecan salad dressing.

I have to say this is a delightful dish.. I read many of the other reviews before I made it and only made one change to it. I added more cream due to I like more sauce..I also tend to believe when leaving a review a person must follow the recipe in order to know the dish.. But this dish is a hit !!!

My wife and I made this for dinner the other night.  It was the best meal we have had in a long time.  The chicken with the creamy caper sauce was awesome.  We are going to cook this again for a dinner party we are having next week.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

This has become my husband's favorite! After experimenting with many of the same changes suggested on other reviews, I've ended up back at the original as the best version. Some worry that a plain cream sauce will be too bland, so they strip the seasonings off the chicken & fancy up the sauce. The seasonings are strong enough on the chicken, that a lot of seasoning remains in the pan after frying & ends up seasoning the sauce. Once the capers are added, it's plenty flavorful with the 'plain' cream sauce. Also, you don't need to add flour to the sauce to thicken. You need heat & patience. Remember to turn the heat back up to high & then just stir for a few minutes. You wait & wait & it doesn't look like it's thickening at all and then suddenly magic happens & it's instantly thick & perfect. Be ready to pull it off the heat at that moment of perfection before the sauce 'breaks.'  Also, I've tried whipping cream, half & half, & fat-free. Any will work, but of course the real whipping cream is always a bit richer. We make this frequently enough that I've premixed large quantities of the four spices in a shaker & when we want a quick dinner, I cut the breast into tender sizes to cook faster, & just shake the premixed spices on liberally & about a minute later it's in the pan cooking. Easy, Fast & Yummy.

OMG it was wonderful! I did not change a thing!
It really made the chicken succulent! The sauce really made it!
In fact days later, I took Flounder and baked it with a little butter,dill and lemon pepper seasoning, and then made the sauce as it was in the recipe and spooned it on top of the baked flounder. My husband said it was the best flounder he ever had,definitely restaurant quality! thank you!

Yummy! I had to improvise a bit; my jar of Lemon Pepper seasoning was, well, it didn't look so good so I checked the ingredients and did the following to get a "lemon pepper" flavor: I pounded the ckn breast to almost 1/4 inch thick, sprinkled with lemon juice, freshly ground pepper, sea salt, celery salt, onion powder, garlic powder, dried dill. I did this to BOTH sides of the chkn and let I sit for 20 min. I did add some slices of garlic to the butter in the skillet when I sautéed th chkn. Definitely need to double the sauce, and I next time I would add a bit of salt to the reducing cream. It took longer than 3 minutes to reduce the cream down to a good thickness but no big deal. I love the capers so next time I think i'll add a bit more! Thanks for the recipe!!
UPDATE: I have now made this recipe for my family four times in the past 3 weeks. I'm out of capers! who runs out of those?! Only thing new is I've been seasoning the sauce with a bit of the same spices that I used on the chicken-and I've been a bit more generous when dousing the chicken with the seasoning. My husband has gravitated towards putting a chicken breast and sauce on french bread-he says it is the best chicken sandwich! Thanks again

What I love about AllRecipes is the range of recipes available to the home cook.  All the way from rustic to elegant, with skill levels from simple to complex, it's all here!  This recipe is beautifully simple to do, but it is FAR from rustic.  We loved the combination of flavors, and the preparation was a snap!  I did double the sauce, and I'm glad, it was yummy.  Thanks for the idea!

ooooh, this was fantastic! I thought this recipe would be a great way to use up some walleye, so I swapped that in place of the chicken (though, I'm sure chicken is great too). This was a snap to put together with things I had on hand; the fish was perfectly seasoned; the sauce was creamy and so flavorful. I was proud to serve this for dinner for me and my boyfriend, and I think it would make an impressive entree for guests too!

Absolutely fantastic!  Got a top rating as an all time favorite with the family.  I marinaded the chicken well before hand and seared it good before adding some cooking sherry to finish during the medium heat phase.

I MADE THIS TONIGHT AND IT WAS STUPENDOUS!!

I marinated chicken & seasonings overnite with fresh lemon juice overnite - YUM!! 5 Stars!!

Doubled the sauce as most everyone has suggested. I use a Turbo Cooker (which is a deep skillet with a dome lid with a vent to open & close.)
My chicken breast were thick and I cooked for at least twice the cook time suggested with vent closed.
Served with stir fried veggies, and chilled fruit cocktail after dinner, because sauce was so good, but rich, so, the chilled sweet fruit cocktail was a good compliment!

Can't wait to make the sauce & seasonings on fish.

Thanks MOMMYFOR2BOYS!!

This was so simple, fast and flavorful.  We enjoyed the chicken on it's own, as well as with the sauce.  We served with baked potato and a green salad.  Very well received from the 2 y.o. to the 80 y.o.!  Thanks for sharing this keeper!

I made this for the first time last night, and it was delicious! I did dredge the chicken in flour and used white wine to de-glaze the pan before making the sauce per others suggestions. I added a tad more garlic to the sauce as well and cut back on the salt altogether because the capers are salty even after rinsing. It had a very nice taste. I served it with potatoes, but next time I will probably serve it tossed with pasta. A keeper in my book! Thanks!

Very yummy. I only had 3 breasts and was afraid it would be too salty but it was just fine.  Of course cooking in butter makes everything delicous.

Yum!! I don't usually leave reviews but the way my boyfriend was raving after dinner I figured I'd better. I made my own lemon pepper mix with lemon zest and pepper. Next time I wouldn't add salt to the chicken, as it was a bit salty. But other than that, it was perfect! I didn't double the sauce and seemed to have a good amount for 4 breasts.

Very tasty!!! I made a few changes based on reviews and what I had on hand, but not so much that it changed the essence of the recipe. Very good and we'll definitely make this again.

What an awesome, easy recipe!! I followed previous suggestions and marinated the chicken in lemon juice (wonderful added zing--excellent suggestion), sauteed a garlic clove in butter before adding chicken, and added white wine before whipping cream for the sauce. Delicious! Will definitely be making again and again!

It was very yummy but watch the salt.  Capers are salty which I love but I added some of the juice from the jar and it was a tad too salty.

I served this on a bed of fresh spinach and added a little garlic, more lemon and eliminated the lemon pepper. Also added a lemon twist to the plate and a few pieces of chopped fresh plum tomato. Picturesque.

Delicious, and so easy too. I pounded the chicken breasts to an even thickness. I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. (so glad I did, otherwise it would have been way too salty). To cook the chicken I used 2 Tbsp. olive oil and 1 Tbsp. butter. I loved how the seasoning and browned bits from the chicken flavored the cream. I cooked the cream for only 1 min. and it had reduced to a sauce perfectly. Served it with roasted potatoes and a salad. Great meal!

I too doubled the sauce and everything was really good.  I have gestational diabetes right now and it is so nice to have recipes that are flavorful and I can eat.  I served rice with this for my family, but ate mine without.

All I can say is Wow!  What a sauce!  I did deglaze the pan with wine as was suggested by other reviewers and the family loved it.  We are making the sauce with tilapia next week and I know it will be good.

It was good and easy, but not impressive. It just didn't have enough flavour for us. We love capers, but the end result was kind of boring. However, the recipe came out fine - just a matter of personal preference, I guess

This dish was delish!!  I filet/sliced the breast long ways to make thiner pieces. Made the following adjustments as recommended from several different reviewers: Marinated the chicken breast in fresh squeezed lemon juice for 15 min.  Pounded the chicken just a little (use parchment paper it works really well).  Dredged the chicken in flour after seasoning the meat with salt, garlic powder and dill (used fresh dill). I omited the lemon pepper, just used some of the lemon juice from the marinate in the sauce.  Doubled the sauce. After cooking the meat I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup white wine and scrapped the bottom to get all the good stuff lose. Added a couple cloves fresh minced garlic to the sauce. Topped it off with some sauted sliced mushrooms.  It was so so so soo good!!  Served it over rice pilaf (RiceARoni) with Copper Carrots (from this site).  This is now one of my favorite dishes!!  Thank you for posting it Mommyto2boys.

Easy and delicious, although I strongly recommend doubling the sauce and there really is no need to thicken it.  I also added dry white wine while I cooked the chicken and some fresh ground pepper. Delish!

After reading the reviews and seeing things being said about doubling the sauce, I decided to simply halve the amount of chicken, since that's all I had anyway and I was only feeding 2 mouths. My chicken was already cooked & cubed, so I just got started on the sauce and let the chicken go in the sauce for the 2nd half of the cook time.  For such simple ingredients - I had everything on hand - this is surprisingly tasty! It's zesty and delicious, but probably easy to overdo so watch the dill & capers, especially if you're using fresh dill weed.. I served my dish with rice, and to my surprise my b/f absolutely loved it. I will be making this again, it's EASY and simple, but tastes like it requires much more time!

Just so you know upfront, I did change this just a little.  I cut up one packet of Costco boneless skinless chicken breasts into chunks, marinated it in the juice and zest of one lemon for about half an hour.  I cooked the chicken as described in the recipe and removed it from the pan.  I added the lemon juice from the marinade and sauted 2 minced garlic cloves.  I doubled the cream, used 3 tablespoons of capers, added the chicken back, and served it over capellini.  It was SOO good that I can't wait for leftovers!  EDIT AGAIN:  with Costco's chicken breast tenderloins this is easy to make just as directed with two exceptions.  I sauteed the chicken in half olive oil, half butter and then added a squirt of lemon juice to the cream at the end.  So easy!  Fifteen minutes from beginning to end.  Served with corn cut from the cob--absolutely yummy!

This recipe is fantastic! We marinated the chicken first in lemon juice for about 3 hours. We doubled the sauce and capers, and served it over angel hair pasta.

Fabulous!!  The only thing I would change for next time is tripling the sauce instead of doubling!  I served the chicken over noodles, so maybe that is why I seemed to need more sauce.  There was enough for 3 chicken breasts, but not the fourth.  Very easy, yet elegant.

My family loved this...even the 14 month old.  I followed the advice of previous posters.  I marinated the chicken in lemon juice before cooking.  I also added garlic to the butter for the sauce.  My husband wanted the lemon flavor a little stronger, so he splashed a little bit of lemon juice over the chicken/sauce after I served it.  It turned out surprisingly well.

I made this recipe according to the directions before reading any of the reviews.  I also agree that this is a very flavorful dish...and will also be making it again...but will also double the sauce.  The sauce is great,just not enough so I would suggest doubling it.

Excellent recipe and great tasting!  I would not change a thing--except to address Sassy121's problem:

When making this sauce, include some cornstarch, arrowroot or flour to prevent the separation that Sassy experienced when making the sauce.  The addition of any of the above will act as an emulsifier and prevent the mix from separating.

This was a very elegant and easy change to our routine.  On advice from other reviews, I added a tsp of flour to the butter before adding the cream to thicken it a little, and also added (a good) boullion to enhance the flavor.  We like garlic in our house, so I served it with egg noodles tossed in a mild garlic butter sauce.  Round it off with a caesar salad and hot rolls.  Higher calories, but excellent for an occasional special dinner!  My 2-yr old ate it ALL (except for the salad - of course).

This is a great, easy recipe - something different to do with chicken! I like capers, but my husband isn't too sure about them, and we both loved this chicken dish. I didn't have any dill at home, so I skipped that. Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty much exactly; I might have used a bit more butter and cream, and I threw in the capers while the sauce was cooking.

Made this tonight for hubby and me...it's a KEEPER!!!  The flavours are subtle, but bam, when you bite into a caper...your taste buds explode.  Hubby had a second helping, and he normally hates capers!  The only thing I changed was doubled up on the spices and cream so I would have more sauce.  Served over extra-broad egg noodles, with green beans almondine as a side.  Definitely a guest-worthy meal!

Let me start by saying that I am not a cook... or anything close to resembling a person skilled in the kitchen. My family jokes that I do not even know which side of the toast to butter. Regardless of this, my boyfriend and I successfully made this dish. Not only was it edible, but it was freaking delicious! We ate every single drop. Note to whoever is going to make this dish, I did not use lemon pepper (does anyone even own that?) and tenders instead of breasts due to a personal preference. The recipe is quite simple, and I will be sure to make this again and again. We paired our chicken with a salad similar to the Roquefort Pear Salad recipe on this site (though we used apple instead of pear). Your taste buds will thank you for making this dish!

This was amazing and so easy! Both my husband and my son loved it. After reading the reviews I also doubled the sauce and deglazed the pan with a little white wine.  I didn't change anything else and thought the chicken looked nice as is, and it was still very tasty without the sauce.  It would be fantastic on fish as well.  I think next time I'll try adding more of the seasoning to some breadcrumbs and parmesan, then top the chicken or fish with the mixture and finish it off in the oven or broiler for a few minutes.

This turned out DELICIOUS--although to get it there I felt the need to add some fresh garlic to the chicken while it cooked, and lemon juice and white wine to the sauce. My first sauce cooked a bit too long and began to separate, so I needed to start the sauce over while the chicken rested-this time with the addition of a few sprinkles of chicken flavoring to make up for the lost pan juices. Thankfully, it came together quickly and tasted great. We felt that the tiny squeeze of lemon added a lot to the sauce; and, in my opinion, it just screamed for the wine. This is a sauce I can see myself using often...possibly on salmon in the near future. Thank you!

This is very flavorful and unique!  My husband and I loved it, but my kids were picky about the capers.  I would agree with some other reviewers that it needs no salt.  The capers make it taste plenty salty enough.

This was so good.  The only changes I made were to use mostly olive oil and just a tiny amount of butter, and to sub nonfat Greek yogurt for the cream, which worked amazingly well. We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

Un-freakin-believable! This is now on our permanent rotation!  The only change I made (er, am making at this very moment!) is substituting evaporated milk for the heavy cream.  If that works then I plan to try fat-free evaporated milk... we'll see.  As written, the recipe is super-duper fattening and fantastically delicious!

My husband loved this so much he was eating the sauce with a spoon before I could get this on a plate and on the table.  Then he ate all of his serving and half of mine!  Next time I would double the sauce as others mentioned.  I followed several reviewers suggestions and added a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan, black pepper and a little lemon juice instead of lemon pepper.  I added minced garlic to the sauce.  Since it was such a hit with my husband I will make it again.  For me it was good but did not wow me.

Recipe is perfect as is, however, today I wanted to make it but was lacking chicken and cream.  I decided to use tilapia and fat free plain yogurt instead.  Did everything like the directions said except added 2 tsp cornstarch with the 1/2 cup yogurt (might only need 1 tsp).  I read online that adding it should help keep the yogurt from curdling.  While it didn't curdle, the yogurt did separate and looks a little weird but it didn't compromise the taste so I ate it anyways.  The dish was good with my substitutions, but not quite as great as the original (not like I expected it to be).  Still, it's a good low-fat option!

Also, I always add the meat again after the sauce has thickened and turn it over while it cooks a little longer to let some more of the spices rub off into the sauce.  Don't know if it really makes a difference, but this recipe is perfection!

Great twist on chicken. my only complaint is it was a tad bit too salty for me. I find the capers have an olivey type taste so that adds to the sodium. I added about 1/4th cup of white wine to my sauce and reduced it. Very lovely otherwise. Will make again

This is an amazing, simple recipe! I added sliced mushrooms with the chicken, and felt like that really put this sauce over the top! I served it over orzo pasta so we could enjoy all the sauce. My fiance loved this dish and told me it needs to be part of our regular menu.

The cream sauce was really plain. I would try what someone recommended and deglaze the pan with white wine to add some flavor. I did follow another recommendation and coat the chicken in flour before sauteing.  This gave it a nice brown look and some added flavor.  I probably won't make this again.

Oh wee..this was so good!! Better than I expected. And it was quick to make and mostly required ingredients that I keep on hand. Here and there I will try a recipe that turns out to be a gem, and this is definitely one of those! I followed the suggestions of some other reviews and it came out perfect. However, the adjustments were minor enough that I could tell the base recipe alone would also be 5 star. I did add 1tsp of minced garlic to the butter before adding the chicken. I also used chicken tenders and pounded those with my rolling pin to tenderize and thin then out a bit. Then, after seasooning exactly as the recipe states, I lightly dredged the chicken in flour. After removing the chicken, I deglazed the pan with some white zinfandel I had in the fridge. I used 1 cup of heavy cream, instead of 1/2 a cup. Really glad I did this because I had JUST enough sauce for about 8 chicken tenders. Lastly, I added just a splash of lemon juice to the sauce. This dish smelled good and gives a fantastic presentation. Great for a dinner party or romantic dinner at home! It looks, smells, and taste restaurant quality. I would suggest cutting the salt to 1/2 tsp or even omitting it all together because the capers provide enough of a salty taste, even after draining and rinsing them. So for those that claim it is too salty, omit the salt and be sure to drain/rinse those capers really well, and don't miss out on a wonderful dish!!

This was FABULOUS! My husband said this is the best meal I've ever made! I kept to the original recipe, with the exception of doubling the whipping cream...you pretty much have to do this. YUMMY!

Very good.  I used fat free half & half, doubled the sauce and added a bit of corn starch to thicken it up.  I used olive oil instead of butter for health reasons.  I also brined my breasts ahead of time because I love them super juicy.  My brine consisted of kosher salt, sugar, lemon pepper, dill, garlic & water.  Just use your own brining method and throw in the herbs from this recipe.  We had angel hair pasta mixed with cauliflower and a tad of chopped kale.  We drizzled the cream sauce over the chicken and pasta/veggies.  My husband and I loved the taste mixture.  My boys 7 & 8 loved the sauce but did pick out the capers.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  I will make again!

Love this recipe. Changes I made this recipe ever better was, I used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder and I also added fresh basil to the seasoning. To the sauce I added white wine and a cup of whipping cream, because I like it saucy.

Followed recipe exactly.  It had a great flavor but the sauce was really runny and separated once I added the chicken back in.  I will try again because it taste great but didn't look too appealing.

I will start by saying I have never had capers. I was a bit hesitant, but have heard so many good things about this recipe, I thought it was worth the try. Did not disappoint! Oh-so-good!! I think what surprised me the most was how quickly this came together. It is a very quick dinner to make! I did what others did and dipped the chicken in a light flour coating before cooking. Also did double the sauce which was amazing!! I would happily make this for company, and the fact that it is made in such a short time frame would be helpful when entertaining. I think tenders would work really well in this dish, also.  Don't know why blsl thighs wouldn't work, either.  Brown rice and broccoli were my sides.  We both really enjoyed this meal and will become something I will come back to many times. Oh, and I found out I really like capers!!  Excellent.

I have a 4 1/2 and 2 1/2 year old and I did not have any left overs. In fact my 2 1/2 year old and husband wanted more.  I did use light cream instead of whipping cream. I added white wine and garlic based on other reviews. It was fantastic! Next time I will make more so I have left overs!

This was REALLY delicious! I followed the recipe with the exception of garnishing mine with the capers as husband doesn't care for them. He is not usually a "sauce" person but he loved it and said he'd like to have it again soon. I did did double the sauce.

Very good...was salty but that was my fault for not rinsing the capers.  Would have liked the sauce a little thicker, but I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 so maybe that was the problem....

Her husband should become a cook. This is delicious. I used olive oil in place of butter, rice milk in place of chipping cream, lemon juice concentrate in stead of the lemon pepper, and fresh minced garlic in stead of garlic powder. Mixed together the dill weed, lemon juice, salt, garlic and olive oil and marinaded the chicken for about 1/2 hour. I also whisked up some chicken broth and cornstarch to add to the pan after the chicken was cooked to create more sauce to go with the quinoa. Very very good, quick and easy.

Fabulous meal.  I marinated the chicken overnight in lemon juice and garlic powder and then cooked it as described.  After the sauce was completed, I added some canned sliced mushroom, returned the chicken to the pan and simmered for about 15 minutes.

I was intrigued because of all the positive reviews and by the fact that I had all the ingredients already... this recipe did not disappoint! I used fresh dill instead of dried and added more cream to create more sauce. I will definitely make this again.

This is quick, easy and very tasty.  I followed others' suggestions by pounding and flouring the chicken without lemon pepper, then sauteing with jarred garlic.  Added some lemon juice at the end with extra cream (I used fat-free h&h, which was fine) but did not double seasonings.  The sauce was not too thick but worked fine over linguine.  Very good if you like capers and cream.

Made this vegetarian with tofu. I drained the tofu on paper towels (about 10 minutes), battered them in unbleached white flour, and then pan-seared them in olive oil with just a thin slice of butter for flavor. I ground black pepper on top and tossed in a bit of minced garlic. Afterwards I set them aside with just a squirt of fresh lemon juice. 

For the sauce I doubled the recipe as others suggested, used fresh dill and added a tsp of garlic salt. It was a bit reminiscent of tartar sauce but much more rich and accompanied the pan-seared tofu very well!

Served over brown basmati rice with a side of grilled asparagus (also topped with sauce). I loved it, the hubby was happy and we will be having left-overs tonight! :-)

I made this for the first time tonight, and it was delicious.  The only change I made (based on other reviews) was that I seasoned some flour with dill, salt, white pepper, and garlic powder and breaded the chicken before pan frying it in oil in the pan.  I used lemon juice in the cream, seasoned the cream with white pepper and salt.  I served it over spaghetti with salad and green beans.  It was wonderful!  I will definitely make this again!

So good. Hubby and I combined 1/2 cup lemon juice with all the seasonings and marinated in fridge about 45 min.  Did use 1 cup whipping cream- was a good amount because I really don't like to be short on sauce and this made enough to cover the chicken and rice well plus a small spoonful leftover.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not impressed and I really thought I would be based on the reviews. Only change was to add a little white wine (as suggested). We ate it but I have no enthusiasm to do it again.

Eh. This was allrigt. Neither my husband or I were all that impressed (sorry!). We both felt this lacked flavor. My husband commented that there were too many capers for his liking and that the capers were the only ingredient that added any real "flavor." I must admit, I doubled the sauce (i.e. cream AND capers), so that could be the reason for his complaint.... In retrospect, I wish I would have incorporated naples34102's suggestions (or at least a couple of them). I think dredging my chicken in flour is a GREAT idea (and I do this with most pan-seared chicken recipes anyways). I also think adding fresh lemon juice to my sauce would have given this dish the oomph it desperately needed. Served with sauteed spinach (which I added to my sauce) over a bed of linguine pasta with onion & dill baugettes and a Caesar salad on the side, this was an "OK" meal. I just don't think I'll repeat it. Thanks for sharing your idea, MOMMYTO2BOYS! :-)

This was decent. I dredged boneless/skinless thighs in seasoned flour (seasoned with lemon pepper, salt and thyme as I had no dill). I then pan fried these in a little olive oil and then followed the sauce recipe as written (doubling it) except only putting in 1T of capers (had never had a caper before and wasn't sure we'd enjoy them). My kids didn't like the capers, but I thought they were nice with the sauce, giving it a nice salty flavor. Otherwise, to be honest, it was just pan fried chicken with a basic creme-based sauce. Nothing overly fancy or special. The lemon-pepper didn't stick out to me at all. Don't get me wrong, it was good.

EASY!! for such a gourmet looking dish.  I didn't have the lemon pepper, so  I just used ground pepper.  Looking forward to trying the lemon pepper next time.  I did add about a 1/2 cup of wine to my doubled sauce.  Oh, and I did pound my breasts out so they where a bit thinner. Served on angle hair pasta....yum!

I cut back on the dill and added powdered lemon peel to taste. Also a little cream cheese or sour cream thickens it nicely. The extra sauce is wonderful over top of angel hair pasta with steamed broccoli!!!

This was pretty good.  We aren't huge caper fans but had some left over from another recipe and wanted to find a way to use them up.  We'll make this again.

Great, easy recipe. Followed it almost exactly, but I did add a lot more than 1 tablespoon of the seasonings. We like it really flavorful. My whole family loved it.

Awesome!  Husband & 2 young kids both gobbled it up.  Will definitely make more sauce next time.  Only change is adding fresh garlic to simmering sauce.

Just delicious! I did not have the lemon pepper but used a fresh lemon and rubbed the chicken with it and seasoned it with pepper. Came out great. Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the sauce, (omitting the salt) tossed in some sauteed wild mushrooms and served the chicken sliced over whole wheat egg noodles.  SUPERB!!  I will make this again and again!

This recipe was fabulous!! My boyfriend even loved it and he is EXTREMELY picky about food.  He said it was the best dinner he's had in a very long time!  I also doubled the cream and instead of keeping the skillet on the high heat to make the cream sauce, I removed it from the heat. This helped it form into the sauce much easier.  Very easy and absolutey delicious!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  It's festive, tasty, and quick to make.

Because the capers are salty, watch the amount of salt and lemon pepper that you use.  It can tend to get a little salty, but the sauce is wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wow!  Our family loved this recipe.  I did double the sauce as others suggested.  I made as is only subbing fat free half and half (we are trying to diet)and adding a little flour to help the thickening process.  It was really great even without the yummy whipping cream.  We served the chicken over couscous with a side salad-really great fast easy meal.  I love meals that are this easy yet appear to be so elegant, difficult, and time consuming.

Superb!  The only thing I changed was that I made 2 chicken breasts (I made just as much sauce as the original recipe called for).  Also cooked the chicken a few minutes longer since  it was thick.  It was a great change cooking with dill, and it was very fast and easy!  For anyone cooking 4 breasts, I'd suggest doubling the cream and capers so you have enough sauce to go around.

I followed the directions while only changing the whipping cream to whole milk with a little corn startch stirred up in it.  I thought the sauce had no flavor so I added about 1/4 cup lime juice and some salt.  Also, I did cut the chicken breasts in half and pounded them before cooking.  After adding the lime juice and salt to the sauce, it was great.  We loved it and will keep making it.  Thanks!

My whole family really enjoyed this recipe.  In fact the reason I tried it was because of the reviews saying that kids really like this dish.  I did change it a tad, which is why I only rated it 4 stars.  I added two large cloves of garlic (diced) and five large button mushrooms (also diced), which I sauteed in the pan prior to adding the half and half (which I used in place of whipping cream).  Like some other reviewers, I put the chicken over a bed of egg noodles, with a little extra sauce.  
My almost four year old twins said that dinner was "Deeelicious!"  : )  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish is fantastic!  I didn't have lemon pepper so I squeezed a Meyer lemon & used cracked pepper.  Absolutely delicious!  I also added some lemon to the white rice I made.  It tastes much like the lemon butter sauce the Brigantine uses on their Calamari Dore which I love...

I thought this dish was really very good - but I too would agree with those who said the sauce needs to be doubled.  I didn't make this exactly as the recipe states....instead, I omitted the salt completely, seasoned the chicken with dill and fresh black pepper and then floured it before throwing it in the pan.  Replaced the butter for olive oil and while the chicken was cooking, I squeezed fresh lemon juice over it and threw in some minced garlic.  Used fat free half-n-half in place of the cream and would most likely use more capers the next time around, since to me, they make this dish.  As with all chicken that I prepare, I pounded the chicken breasts before starting out in order to make a nice fork tender meal.  Simple, light and overall tasty.  Will make this one again - thanks much for the recipe!

I was very excited to try this recipe but the sauce separated before I could get it poured over the chicken. It was quite awful looking! I didn't cook it on high the entire time. Could this have been the problem?

Wow!!!!!!!!!  Didn't know it would taste that good, but I was fooled.  Followed the recipe exactly, even though I was sure the "sauce" was going to need more than just whipping cream and capers.  But I was wrong!  All of the tastes blended well together and the entire family, even my children who do not care for chicken, loved it.  My husband said its probably his favorite chicken recipe.  Thanks

This was a great sauce, I did substitute thighs for the breast. For my taste the chicken breast are just to dry. For those that substituted other "Creams" for the heavy cream, you just don't know anything about cooking. I have always had good experiences using heavy cream but substitute half and half that is just plain stupid.

Family LOVED this meal. I added garlic salt and a little of Montreal Chicken Seasoning to the chicken. I also made angel hair pasta brewed in italian seasoning and basil seasoning in the boiling water to give it a flavor. Will make it again..and again. :-)

The recipe was pretty good. I didn't have dill (thought I did) so I used thyme and I think it turned out well. I also pounded the chicken breasts before letting them soak in a little olive oil with salt, pepper, thyme, and freshly squeezed lemon juice which created an amazing flavor in the chicken once it was cooked. I dredged the breasts in flower sifted with salt, pepper, and thyme prior to cooking them and sauteed garlic prior to deglazing the pan. I used the left over lemon mixture from the marinade with just a few splashes of Reisling to deglaze before adding the cream and added a few sprinkles of lemon pepper before adding the capers. I doubled the cream mixture and added a bit more to make sure I had enough sauce to plate 5 chicken breasts on a bed of spaghetti tossed with olive oil. I served with sauteed yellow and green Italian squash with garlic.

Love this! This is my go to recipe for when I do our food ministry for church, or when having company over. Everyone raves about it. It is very simple, fairly quick to make & looks very gourmet. I make it just as directed but I suggest doubling or tripling the cream as you will need more sauce when you serve it. One of the other comments mentioned adding 1/2C white wine which I think would also be a great idea. Also, the chicken breasts I usually buy seem to be very thick, so I do pound them out to flatten the thick side a bit, so that the chicken breast is about the same thickness all around.  I like serving it with roasted asparagus, or fresh broccoli. Also your favorite noodles as a side or some mashed potatoes. This is a keeper & you will love it.

This is a divine recipe if you skip the lemon pepper, flour the breasts lightly before browning and then deglaze the pan with 1/2 c. white wine before adding the remaining ingredients. I used the juice of half a large lemon in the sauce to replace the lemon pepper. I had 3 breasts, which I halved and pounded between waxed paper. This gave me 6 thin cutlets and I did not need to double the sauce. The chicken breasts were from Trader Joe's and were hormone free. Quality of the ingredients really does make a difference. I briefly returned the cooked chicken to the pot until coated all over with the sauce. Served this with a side of Laura's Lemon Roasted Potatoes from this site (*****) and some steamed artichoke hearts. What a meal!! Thanks for the start of a great recipe.

I just made this for dinner tonight and my whole family loved it!!! I modified it to 8 serving sizes so that my husband could take some for lunch tomorrow. Lucky him! I also doubled the sauce. We all got extra! I did add 1/2 c. of chicken broth to deglaze the pan before adding the heavy cream. I also added some black pepper because I don't cook without it. I used 1/8 tsp  of corn starch to thicken it up a bit. Served it with Jasmine rice and broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower. Next time I will try deglazing with a bit of white wine. This is a keeper!!!

I didnt have any Dill, so I used some Italian Seasoning, it worked well. I doubled the recipe for the cream, and I deglazed the pan with some White Wine. The sauce was GREAT. I used alot of Lemon Pepper, and it gave the chicken great flavor and served it over some tri-color noodles. This was a GREAT recipe. I used fresh chopped garlic in the butter as well.

Made this exactly as written at first. This had good flavor but too salty. Omit the salt as it's already the first ingredient in the lemon pepper seasoning and there is salt in the capers.  If you like a lot of salt, then go with the original. Also, if you have leftovers, don't microwave. The sauce just turns to liquid. Reheat in a sauce pan on low heat.

Great recipe and will make again.  Simple, quick, and hubby enjoyed it.  I found this dish salty so I checked my lemon pepper seasoning to realize that salt was the first ingredient.  I doubled the amount of cream b/c the amount of sauce seemed like too little.  Unfortunately my cream wasn't nice and cream-colored though.  It was more brown-colored from the browned pan drippings.  I served this with sauteed spinach greens along with a basil/parmesan orzo pasta recipe that I found on this site.  Perfect!

Next time I'll half the salt in the dish if I use the same lemon pepper seasoning.  Check your lemon pepper to ensure it doesn't have added salt!!

OMG I am so glad I made this. I've had this recipe saved for almost two years, and I've only just made it, and boy, was it good! I mixed up 1 T  of flour, some Italian herbs (because I didn't have dill), lemon pepper, salt and some chili flakes in a zip-loc bag, then added strips of boneless chicken thigh to it until evenly coated. Sautéed garlic in the skillet with butter, then added chicken. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and increased the amount of cream slightly. Added a pinch of chicken cube and 1 T of water to the sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes. Served over spinach fettuccine with butter and Parmesan. Scaled down to one. Loved it for sure!

I am a horrible cook but since moving in with my boyfriend I have been desperately trying my hand at home cooked meals. Although I feel bad for my cooking most nights, he completely RAVED about this meal and even went out and bought wine to celebrate my cooking breakthrough. This recipe is definitely easy and oh-so-good!

Delicious. I modified slightly. Didn't have lemon pepper so deglazed my pan with the juice of 1 lemon before adding the whipping cream.  I used abt a half a pint of cream and it was plenty. I went easy on the dill, not my favorite flavor. I also added a little freshly grated Parmesan to the sauce.  Served with a mixture of roasted vegetables. Yum.

Wow! Every once in a while a recipe comes along that you know was meant for you. This is one of those. Didn't change a thing except to pound the chicken to make it more evenly thick throughout. And you're going to want more of that fabulous sauce.

Yummy recipe!  Love capers!  I would omit the salt in this recipe though.  It was a bit overpowering here.  But my whole family liked it, even my super picky 10 year old who eats nothing w/o complaining.  Delish!  Fancy enough for company and super easy to make!!

WOW this was moist and tender, and SO flavorful without being overwhelming! I followed the directions exactly and cooked the chicken to an internal temp of 150 degrees (USDA recommends 165) since my peices were thicker than usual. I also added more cream to make more sauce and it was just delicious! Thank you so much for sharing!!!

I made this and it was very rich (maybe too rich) and delicious.  But it probably was the most unattractive dish I’ve served in a long time.  My sauce totally separated which made this look very unappealing.  I made the full amount of sauce for just two chicken breast halves, seasoning them first with salt and pepper.  I did cut back on the butter, using only 2T.  I cooked the chicken completely and removed it to a warm oven.  Then I deglazed my pan with 1/4 cup of white wine as suggested by another reviewer. I also used a squeeze of fresh lemon juice instead of the lemon pepper. If I were to try this again I would cut back on the butter even further to 1 T.  And I would probably use half and half to cut the richness.

Very good overall. Some changes that (in my opinion) would improve this dish are: 1) pound breasts to cutlet size. 2) add more seasoning for added flavor and coat in flour. 3) Saute in olive oil for a healthier alternative. 4) Add 1-2 minced garlic clovers while sauteing chicken. 5) Make twice as much sauce.

So good!!! I've made this recipe several times and its a hit for my boyfriend and I every time. I agree with past reviews about using twice the amount of whipping cream. I would also recommend using the extra sauce on asparagus or mashed potatoes. It's delicious!!

I liked this and followed it exactly as written. I think the next time I make this I will either omit or reduce the lemon pepper because I thought it was a bit on the salty side. My husband loved it and asked that it be added to our rotation. Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe! I duplicated one review by marinating chicken in lemon juice for 15 min. Didn't have any cream in the house, so I used mascarpone to thicken the sauce. Love the fresh dill, capers and fresh garlic. Also added 1/4 c. white wine to thin the mascarpone. Delicious!

I followed the recipe to the letter.  The chicken was tough and dry and the sauce curdled.  This recipe was a big disappointment.  Needless to say I will not try it again.

Love this easy recipe - I used less salt because the capers are salty.

I dredged chicken in flour after seasoning. I added  some white wine and lemon, to make this sauce shine. I thought the sauce was bland.

This chicken was wonderful! I used half and half instead of whipped cream and it was great . Easy to prepare and the sauce is sooooo good, I could eat it straight.

The only reason I tried this recipe was because of it's ease and the great reviews.  I have to say that I loved it!  I am so surprised that a dad who's not a cook thought this up.  I did use fresh dill instead of dried dill, which worked well.  The capers added a piquant that I absolutely loved.  It has a sophisticated flavor.

Amazingly good and easy, the first time I tried it it was great, the second timeI has to substitute milk with a thickening agent (corn starch) and it was still good.

This dish was so simple and elegant.  As others suggested I used fresh/chopped garlic instead of garlic powder, and I did add a splash or two of a good white wine.  I'm sure fresh mushrooms would be grand as well, but I'm not a fan.  I doubled the cream and had leftovers the next night with noodles.  Yum-O!

The only thing different that I did was to chop up the capers and swap out half and half for the whipping cream.  Delish!

DELISH! Been wanting to try this recipe and it was amazingly simple and my family loved it. It is going into our book of yummy recipes that we will try again. I did use the white wine to deglaze the pan, which I think I was a bit liberal with and it made the sauce a bit thin. Overall the flavor was amazing.

My husband and I loved this, and he didn't even ask what the capers were!  I used extra whipping cream, and it made a nice amount of sauce, so next time, I will prepare some rice to serve with the sauce also.  Thanks for a very nice recipe!

Got an "absolutely delicious" from my husband, an "excellent!" from one twin daughter, and a "best chicken I've ever had" from the other twin.:-)  Personally, I thought it was a touch too salty, so I'll cut back on that a bit next time.

I deglazed the pan with a splash of white  wine after removing the chicken and before putting in the cream.  I did double the cream, but that turned out to be a be too much sauce ... so maybe 3/4 of a cup next time.

Thank you for a great recipe that my family can't wait to have again!

Was ok.  I didn't have capers, so I'm sure that would have made a difference, as we kept having to add salt.  I added some fresh spinach.

I would have preferred a little more lemon flavor and thinner sauce.  I simmered the cream for 3 minutes and it was quite thick--no flour needed!  It is very quick and easy.

A.ma.zing. Just made this for the first time tonight with my boyfriend and it was absolutely outstanding. We didn't have lemon pepper on hand, so I grated a lemon for zest instead. Loved it! Thank you!!

Very tasty! I didn't have any capers so I followed the recipe and left them out. I'm always looking for new ways to cook chicken breasts and I must say this is a winner in my book.

The sauce was so good I wanted to lick my plate! My three picky kids also liked it! I put the seasoning on the chicken in the morning, so it would "marinate" before cooking it that night. Otherwise followed the recipe and loved it!

Too heavy with seasonings, resulting in a strong, salty taste.  Perhaps halving the seasonings and doubling the cream would help.

WOW!  Love this recipe!  Made it for dinner last night and had the left over piece for lunch today, I licked the plate!  I have made lots of chicken dish from this website and I have to say this is by far my favorite!  So easy and so delicious!  It didn't take too many ingredients but the chicken taste full of flavor and the sauce is wonderful!!  The only thing I would do differently next time is to cut down the salt by half!  Thank you Mommyto2boys for this awesome recipe!!

This is ok. The flavor was ok but did not look pretty at all.  It was more like a creamy chicken picatta. I probably will not make again.

Wow, was this chicken easy!  And my boys- husband, 7 yr old, and 18mo old gobbled it up and asked for more.  The chicken by itself was yummy too.  I adulterated the sauce because I didn't have whipping cream, so I used whole milk, the pan drippings, a squirt of whipped cream, and capers.  It didn't whip, so I just glazed the chicken with it.  It balanced out the dilly lemony taste of the chicken (already good), softening it with the glaze.  Yummy!! I'll make it right next time and see if it's even better!

Made this as written and it was delicious!  I will make again in future but will take advice of others and double the sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Okay...loved it and I did double the cream so therefore, I doubled the butter as well. So tasty but if I changed anything, I would omit the salt. My butter was salted and the capers being salty as well, I thought it was a bit much. I seriously don't think you would miss that added salt. I also added the chicken back into the sauce after I felt it was the right consistency and simmered another 5 minutes. A keeper for sure.

Wonderful recipe,. I follow it pretty much to the letter, with some minor additions. I did double the cream and used chicken tenders dusted with flour. I deglazed with white wine I also sauteed mushrooms and garlic in olive oil for the topping before the sauce. This was served over Jasmine rice. Just delichous.

I really liked this recipe but my husband did not.  The kids liked it all except the capers - so 4 Stars.  I also doubled the sauce - if I wouldn't have there definitely would not have been enough!  Served it with white rice and the sauce was excellent on that as well.

This is a keeper. My husband loves anything cooked w/ lemons. After cooking the chicken, I added fresh garlic, lemon zest and capers and cooked for 1 minute. Deglaze w/ white wine and lemon juice. Pour over chicken, place in oven @ 375 for 20 minutes.

I don't think 5 stars is enough, I think I need to go to 10 or 15.   I did modify it a bit though. Took out the garlic powder and used fresh minced garlic as well and cooked it on top for a long time. Then I finally flipped it and just let the garlic flavor go into the remaining butter and cooked it til it became crisp. Didn't have the capers or cream.  I served it over white rice that I mixed the butter from the pan into to flavor. The end result was a new favorite of my husband, myself, and his best friend! The flavor is amazing and I never would have thought of it on my own!

This was so quick, easy and delicious. I used a can of cream of mushroom soup (and a little water) instead of the cream and whisked it.  Then chopped up the cooked and seasoned chicken, put it in the sauce and served over rice.

This recipe is now a regular in our house. Usually I make it with thin pork chops, double the sauce and serve with linguine or other pasta. I do find the sauce a bit bland as written though so I add more dill and a little extra s&p to it to bring the flavors through. I also sometimes substitute chopped green olives for the capers (no extra spices). I never would have thought of it had i not been making this and realized i'd run out of capers! Now my family asks for 'that olive cream sauce'. Thanks!

Just made this tonight. We all loved it even the kid. The only issue anyone had was the capers. The kid and my wife couldn't handle eating them whole. I personally liked the contrasting in taste though. As others stated I doubled the sauce and barely had enough but I also served the chicken over while grain egg noodles. I'm new to cooking with recipes so I was a little freaked out when making the sauce. For those that are new like me expect the sauce to foam up quite a bit. Don't turn down the head it will settle and loose the foam. That's when you know it's done.

I thought this was really salty! and I didnt even add any salt ,doubled the whipping cream and added some onion powder. I would make this again but half the capers, dice up the chicken and add some mushrooms. I let some of the pasta soak up the  extra sauce.(angel hair) B-f loved this. Thx.

Loved this dish with a few modifications. I didn't have dill weed on hand so I omitted that. I marinated the chicken as stated to do along with lots of lemon juice. After cooking the chicken, I splashed 1 cup of pinot grigio into the pan before adding the half&half (trying to be a little healthier). I found that even when I doubled the sauce, it wasn't enough. Next time I will triple or quadruple. I also added the juice of a half of a lemon to the sauce. It took about 10 minutes to finally thicken. After the first 6 minutes of whisking, I thought it wasn't going to thicken so I added a couple pinches of flour and thats what might've helped get it thick. I served with white rice and steamed green beans. Delish!

This is a really great dish! Just as suggested I doubled the sauce. After the chicken was cooked I sauted 3 cloves of garlic and added 1/4 cup of white wine to deglaze the pan, then added skin milk instead of whipping cream (sorry no offense, but I refuse to add so much fat) and a little bit of cornstarch. I rinsed the capers well before adding to the pan to reduce sodium. Served over whole wheat spaghetti, even the kids asked for seconds. Thanks!

Pretty good.  The capers weren't well blended into this recipe.  I think if they were warmed into the recipe a little longer, maybe added while the chicken was browning it would have been better.

Quick & easy yet so delicious!  Great for a dinner party, too.  Be sure to double the sauce as many reviewers have suggested.  Half & half works instead of whipping cream.

Oh-my-goodness!  This is SO good...really, it sounds simple, and it is...but the taste is so rich and flavorful!  My only change was that I deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine before adding the cream for the sauce, AND, I doubled the sauce...good thing cause it's delish!!!  This is a keeper, keeper, keeper!  I'm going to try it with Salmon...I"m sure it'll be great!

If you're a caper fan, this one will make your day.

As per at least one of the comments, I doubled the cream.  I also pounded the chicken.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was outstanding.

The blend of spices is awesome, the chicken came out delicious and flavorful! My husband loved it. My only complaint is that if you follow the directions exactly, you will burn the cream instantly. My suggestion is to lower the heat once the chicken is removed and deglaze the pan slowly.

I really like all of the ingredients in this recipe but they didn't blend well. The sauce didn't taste of capers until I actually ate one. I will try to find a way to fix this as the idea here is a good one. Many reviewers complained of too salty a taste. I rinsed the capers, used unsalted butter and didn't salt the chicken and I found the dish needed salt. I should have known better. Thank you to the reviewer who suggested baking and thick chicken breasts after frying. This ensured the meat being done properly and saved me from burning the bits in my frying pan. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will probably give it another go.

This was a great recipe – and came together in a flash!  The entire house smelled wonderful while I was cooking and even my pickiest eater liked it!  I replaced the dill weed with Pampered Chef dill mix (a must have in our kitchen) and exchanged the whipping cream for fat free half and half as that was what I had on hand.  It was most pleasing and I am sure it will become a staple on our weekly menus!  My only challenge is how to make more of it at a time……I think I will have to get two skillets going next time!

This was quite good. I had huge chicken breasts so I pounded them, but couldn't get them very thin. They still took forever to cook! I used just 2 breasts, (they were probably the size of 4 regular ones) and used 2/3 cup cream since everyone else said it needed more sauce. (Looking back, I probably should have just used 1/2 cup, but oh well!) I omitted the salt and didn't rinse the capers. The chicken was still very tender even after taking so long to cook through. I enjoyed the cream sauce. Served with a Trader Joe's rice pilaf and veggie.

DO NOT ADD THE SALT!!!  The first time I made this, it was so salty it was not edible. So I tried it again without the salt... it was really good. I used lemon juice and pepper (I didn't have any lemon pepper), chopped the chicken into bite-sized pieces, and let the chicken simmer in the cream sauce until it thickened (20 minutes or so). Served with chicken flavored brown rice and steamed veggies. This would also taste good without the capers (they aren't necessary to the flavor of the dish).

Light, gourmet taste.  If you are making a gravy out of this, I cant imagine how terrible it would taste.  I'm not really sure how people can change an entire recipe, then grade it down.  You're not grading this recipe, you are grading what you made.

Wonderful recipe.  Substituted 1/4 cup chicken broth for part of heavy cream addition and did not rinse the capers for added flavor.  Also used fresh dill and fresh lemon zest on sauteed chicken instead of lemon pepper.

Per other reviews, I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, fresh garlic and the herbs.  I followed the instructions from there, and thickened the sauce by making a roux with the drippings.  The flavor of this dish was incredible!  I loved the saltiness of the capers in combination with the tartness of the lemon and dill and the creaminess of the sauce.  I think I've only ever given 5 stars 3 times before.  This recipe is definetly worthy of the highest rating.

This is a very easy dish to make, and the end result is very tasty. I didn't  have whipping cream, so I used light cream instead. The sauce was still quite good; I'll probably make the chicken this way again. I love garlic, so I added a few cloves of it when cooking the chicken. I omitted the salt as well.

Terrific!  Only changes I made was to marinade in lemon juice and double the sauce.  Even our uber picky 10 y/o ate it all up.  

Served it with angel hair pasta mixed with just bit of tarragon and grape seed oil as well as a simple baby leaf spinach salad.  Hubby said it tasted even better the next day as left overs.

Made this tonight....Absolutely Delicious!! My whole family went back for 2nds. Love the sauce. So simple, but so flavorful! I also added fresh garlic to the butter and I seasoned the breasts and let them sit in a ziploc in the fridge for an hour before cooking. Delicious. My 13 yr old (very picky eater) asked if we could have it again tomorrow night!!! This recipe will be going in the "family favorites" file!

Quick, easy and delicious.  I did add one cube of frozen garlic (from Trader Joes) to the butter as it was melting and I doubled the sauce as some reviewers suggested. I served the chicken with egg noodles and put some of the sauce over the noodles.  I also added some fresh mushrooms while the chicken was cooking.  The whole family liked this recipe.

This looked really delicious, beautiful presentation, too bad we didn't like it. Maybe it was the lemon pepper? The capers? Both? No one here liked this dish. We all voted it a "thumbs down". It was edible, but just not to our tastes. I was very disappointed because I had been looking forward to making this dish for quite some time. Sorry :(

Yummy! I pounded the chicken flat for easy cooking, sprinkled with all seasonings except the salt (didn't need it) and just a touch of flour. After removing chicken, I added more butter and sauteed some mushrooms in the pan before adding cream and capers.  Served it over angelhair pasta.  Very good! I will make more sauce next time too! (Also used Heavy Cream..cuz that's all I had!)

This recipe is a winner! Very good and very easy to make. At the end I just poured the cream right over the chicken and added the capers and let it simmer together until a sauce formed. Delicious!

I've used so many recipes from this site, but this is the first one I've ever reviewed. This recipe is OUTSTANDING.  I’ve made this every week for the past couple of months.  My family loves it - even my picky son loves it.  I’m adding more cream just to have more of the delicious sauce to share.  So easy, so good...what more could you ask?

So, this seemed simple enough but it turned into something very different. I thought I had all the ingredients but as it turned out I didn't have dried dill, so off to the store. Turns out they didn't either and walked out with fresh instead. I've heard of fresh to dried conversions before and did a quick lookup. Found what I needed, did the conversion, and finely chopped it. Then, I couldn't find the garlic powder so back to the conversion website. Finely ready, I made enough sauce for 6 though stayed with the 4 breasts, the extra for the broccoli side. I did tweak it a little by adding Siracha powder to spice it up. One additional afterthought, sautéed mushrooms that I added after the sauce was done. This is easily the easiest and one of my top 5 favorite recipes and being I cook for myself for the following week's lunch I gave some to a coworker, as I often do, who said it was the best thing I've made.

I followed the recipe exactly and this was a big hit at my dinner party.  All the guests said "it's a keeper".  I did brine the chicken for 2 hours in a mixture of water, salt, sugar and olive oil.  It did not alter the flavor at all, just rendered the chicken nice and juicy.  The spice combination was spot on and the caper sauce was delicious.  The whole meal was very light yet satisfying.  I'll be making this again.  Thank you for this great recipe.

I used whole milk, 2 tablespoons butter, and 2 Tablespoons flour to make the sauce.  My husband rated it 5 stars.

This meal was quick and easy to prepare. Perfect for a mid-week meal. I dredged my chicken in flour with the lemon pepper, dill weed, and garlic powder and sautéed it in a little vegetable oil and butter until browned and cooked fully. Also put lemon pepper and dill weed directly on to chicken before dredging. Then I removed them and added a pat of butter to pan and added minced garlic (1 TB) and added a cup of cream and lots of capers. I put the chicken over buttered egg noodles and served it with fresh asparagus. Delish!

If followed the reviewers suggestions so I really don't know if if it is good as is. That being said, I made the chicken as described in the recipe. But when the chicken was removed from the pan I deglazed the pan with a little white wine then added the cream and capers. Also I like a lot of seasoning so I added more of what went on the chicken in the cream (excluding salt, low salt diet)  and more capers it was very simple and quick. I will make again. My husband loved it and so did I. Oh and I also cut two chicken breast to make them thinner and served the chicken on top of thin  spaghetti with the sauce  (that I doubled) over all. It looked gourmet.

My family loved this recipe. I used variations of the variations across several reviews. Skipped the lemon pepper and marinated chicken in lemon juice for 15 min. Dredged chicken in flour that had been mixed w dill weed, garlic powder and pepper. Added a garlic clove to the butter before adding the chicken. Deglazed pan and used 1 cup cream. Served w penne. Great dinner.

Very good recipe. Good for Paleo or carb free eaters too.  I followed the recipe, except for using real lemon juice and pepper instead of using lemon pepper that I didn't have and I used fresh dill and garlic instead of dried and powder.  I deglazed the pan with a small amount of white wine to get all of the chicken bits and flavor into the sauce. I added sautéed mushrooms at the end with the capers. I doubled the sauce recipe.  Really great tasting sauce and an easy dish to make. My husband LOVES this dish. For those not happy with the consistency, using heavy cream, not 1/2 & 1/2 and reducing it by cooking is they key as well as using the butter. No need for flour or starch. The sauce always turns out wonderful, with great consistency and flavor.  Served with sautéed vegetables. Thank you for sharing.

Very tasty! I actually bought a bottle of capers, which I had never tried before. They are now a permanent addition to my condiments! I did not salt the chicken at all (I don't use a lot of salt generally.), relying on that left in the capers. I used fresh lemon zest and freshly ground pepper in place of the lemon pepper - same thing, right? Wanting to double the sauce, but only having 1/2 cup of cream, I used the standard substitute of 3 T butter & 6 T milk. That didn't really work; it separated somewhat in making the sauce. My fault. Oh, I added a couple of sliced Baby Bella mushrooms when sautéing the chicken. I think the sautéed chicken can stand alone without the sauce, and the sauce could be used with other entrees. Recipe is marvelous as is!

Delicious.  Since it's only my husband and me, I made two chicken breasts but used full recipe for caper sauce.  If I was making for four people, I'd double the amount of cream and capers to have enough sauce.

Oolala!  We loved this chicken.  Congrats to the originator who isn't a "cook"!  ?   This is a very simple, quick-to-fix meal.  The simplicity of ingredients lends itself to simple planning as well.  I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and I'm betting many others would,too. If you like picatta recipes, you will like this.  The flavor is like chicken picatta  without the frying in oil. Served it with baked potatoes with fresh-cut chive, and fresh green beans lightly steamed with onion slices and sprinkled with garlic salt.  This was a very good weekday meal that was cooked in minimal time.  It will definitely be a repeater in our home.  5 star for flavor, ease of prep and cooking, and cost to plate.

Delish! Just make sure that you're using lemon pepper, NOT lemon pepper seasoning salt ;)

I've also made this successfully with milk and/or half & half in place of the cream, it just needs a tiny bit of flour to thicken (about 1 tsp).

This was delicious! I used chicken tenderloins rather than breasts so I just adjusted the cooking time. I also took the advice of another reviewer and deglazed the pan with a bit of white wine and a squeeze of fresh lemon before adding the cream. The dry rub with dill, lemon pepper, etc was delicious and would be good even without the creamy caper sauce.

Really delicious.  As others did, I doubled the cream, added a touch of cornstarch to thicken then also added mushrooms. Because I have teenagers, dinner was delayed so instead of putting the sauce over top I left the chicken in the sauce to simmer. I will make again.

Delicious! I modified it slightly: I pounded out the chicken to thin it. I didn't have any dill so skipped it, but seasoned chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and lemon pepper and let sit in fridge while I cooked the rice and veggies. Before I sautéed the chicken, I dredged in flour which really helped with browning. I also used a little more butter because I was using a very large skillet, and I deglazed with white wine before adding the cream. My sauce tasted a little bland but a touch of salt brought out its flavor. I served with white rice, broccoli, and French bread, and my boyfriend  who doesn't care much for chicken cleaned his plate and complimented the meal.

Awesome way to make boring chicken breast!!! Absolutely delicious and even my 10 and 5 year old boys devoured it. I made a regular meal...we make it at least 1-2 times per month. I will say it makes a bit of a mess in the kitchen though...but thats why I do the cooking and my wife does the cleaning. I think I have the better end of the deal!!!

The chicken was really good and flavorful however the sauce was terrible. My 13 year old liked it but the other 5 kids didn't. well not make sauce again.

It was so flavorful, covered the breasts with lemon pepper, garlic powder, dill weed, salt and pepper, after 5 minutes drizzled half a lemon on it, let it sit 10 min, after cooking in a wide skillet, I put it aside in foil for 15 min, then put it back in the simmering sauce with capers and garlic and cooked 5 minutes, it helped the flavors seep in the chicken, took out the chicken, reduced the sauce and poured it on top, will make it again- Najm

This sauce is so good!!! I substituted the chicken with salmon.  Deglazed the pan with white wine before sautéing some garlic and then adding the cream and dill. Added a few more capers and a little more cream than recipe originally suggested as well. Great idea!!!!

This was an excellent recipe that even my ridiculously picky husband enjoyed. I did make a couple changes. I pounded out the chicken to about 1/2 inch thick. I juiced one lemon and marinated the chicken with half the juice, fresh dill, garlic powder and pepper. After cooking the chicken, I deglazed the pan with the other half of the lemon juice and reduced the cream with more dill and the capers (the sauce cooked for about 7 minutes). I served the chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. This was a really simple, quick recipe that I will most definitely cook again and again!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have any dill so I used some scallions instead. Next time I definitely make sure I have dill. We're having the leftovers tonight. I'm glad I doubled the sauce, it should have even more flavor tonight. Served it with roasted brussel sprouts and cheesy mashed potatoes.

I made this last night and I screwed this cool recipe UP.  I sautéed the chicken, put it aside as instructed, made the sauce and then I thought "I know, I'll put the chicken back in the pan with the sauce so the chicken will be absolutely COVERED in sauce. YUM!" My mom and I tasted tiny bites and agreed it was awesome.

My dad then called and said he'd be awhile and to east without him. I said we'd wait. We did and 60 minutes later we went to eat and oh my lord... The sauce had messed up. The butter in the sauce and the rest of it had separated, and I had to whisk a bunch to even get it to be ready to be served. Also The sauce had gotten bitter. I couldn't eat it. Everyone else said it tasted good and ate and kept telling me I had done well and to not be hard on myself, and said we'd just serve it when done next time, but I ate a bowl of Honey Kix while watching, embarassed, as my really sweet family, ate their way through my mistake. 

I give this 4 stars because it tasted amazing when I did the taste test after it was done. And also if they could eat it and claim they enjoyed it EVEN AFTER I MESSED IT UP, that's a great recipe. Will be making it again but will serve immediately. I served the chicken and sauce on top of rice and with steamed green beans.

So easy.  We don't have dill weed hanging around in the house, so substituted 1/2 tsp chives and 1 tsp parsley.  The sauce is delicious and some red potatoes and cauliflower go well with it.

I followed the recipe exactly, using all organic ingredients, and it was wonderful!!!  My husband,  who was a little leery of the capers at first, loved it and said he definitely wanted this as a regular meal. 
It was so simple.   I did not double the sauce, as others suggested,  because I was pretty certain my 6 year old's wouldn't like it, so hubby and I got their portion!  (They did try a bite with the sauce, but preferred just the chicken).  I saw where some reviewers  used milk or half and half then added cornstarch or flour...  I can't imagine that being anywhere near as good.  Served with brown rice and steamed broccoli and carrots.   Probably one of my favorite chicken recipe's from this site so far!

I make this recipe all the time and it's a big hit with the picky eaters in my family. To save time, I cube the chicken so it will cook faster and then serve over hot rice. Wonderful, quick, savory dish that is perfect during cold weather.

I think tis was a great dish. I, like others added 1/4 c white wine to deglaze the pan as well as adding 2 cloves of chopped garlic. I doubled the sauce too. I served this with brown rice and carrots. My husband liked this very much. This is a keeper. Next time I'm going to try fat free half and half and try this over pasta. Good job Mommyto2boys. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!

Great recipe, only made 2 chicken breasts and used the original recipe for the sauce. Turned out wonderful and just enough sauce. I made garlic asparagus as my side and it went well together.

This recipe is so delicious and very easy to make. I had to cook the chicken breasts longer than in the recipe,  used less salt and I doubled the cream amount. So simply and really fabulous. This is a firm favorite.

I was afraid that my husband would not like the capers, but he said this dish was fantastic! Based on other reviews, I marinaded the chicken in lemon juice for a few minutes. Dredged lightly in flour just before frying. Doubled the sauce. Excellent. Will make this again soon.

I made this exactly as written and it was really yummy. My husband like it so much that he had the leftovers for breakfast the next because he didn't want to wait until lunch! lol I'm making it again today and will double the sauce, but that is the only change.

I liked the recipe and will make it again. I didn't have garlic powder so I mined fresh garlic and used sour cream instead of whipping cream. Great tasting and simple! Make sure the chicken breasts are fully thawed if using frozen breasts. Served with quinoa.

I don't like dill so I substituted a mix of basil and rosemary. I used just two chicken breasts and had the perfect amount of sauce. I will make this one often

So good he insisted on making it two nights in a row. I cubed the chicken and dredged it in flour before adding the dill and lemon pepper. While the chicken was cooking I added minced garlic to the pan. After removing the chicken I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup white wine, then added the cream and capers.  I doubled the cream. Delicious served over basmati rice. One of my favorite recipes ever!!

Great.
Cooked on a wood fired grill.
Deglazed with some wine added garlic and a splash of real fish sauce (not the brown stuff) to the sauce, a bit of butter to finish.
Fresh basil and lemon slices for garnish.

This is such a simple, yet FANTASTIC dinner! We all love it. The sauce is amazing. The only thing I changed is I coated my chicken in panko before frying. Just adds a bit of 'crunch.' Great dinner! Thanks for sharing.

I was looking for some 'guidelines' to use for a stuffed chicken recipe and found this caper cream sauce, which is what I was looking for.  Made some adjustments, added the whole small jar of capers with juice and added dry mustard (but made much more sauce).  We put the caper sauce on a provolone spinach stuffed chicken breast instead.  Paired very well and similar to a chicken dish I had at a favorite restaurant.  Used the same cooking times but covered the chicken.  Thank you for the easy and delicious caper cream sauce, will make again with other chicken dishes!

Took a little longer than indicated to cook, but the flavour was very good. We enjoyed this with wild rice and green and yellow string beans.

This came out so great! The chicken was moist and flavorful. I needed to add more cream for more sauce and used more capers than called for and served the chicken over egg noodles. It was a big hit!

GREAT! I decreased the butter to 1 Tbsp and used 2 Tbsp of olive oil to fry the chicken. My husband loved it and he does not like capers. This is a keeper in our house.

I haven’t made this recipe yet but the seasonings (minus the garlic powder) plus the creamy caper sauce sound perfect for a mild white fish such as bass or walleye.

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of doubling the cream as others had suggested.  Mmmm..was it delicious!  Very flavorful, tastes just like going to a fine restaurant but very easy and quick to make.  Will definitely be on the menu next time I have guests over that I want to impress.

This recipe is all that it's cracked up to be!  My husband downed it so freakin' fast it!  I get warm fuzzies in my tummy when I see him eat something I made with such excitement.  All the reviews are right though, DOUBLE the sauce!! Maybe even triple it.  I followed the advice of another review and served this with penne noodles in butter and parmesan cheese, VERY TASTY!!  I've actually made it twice already and will make it many many more times to come.

Great recipe!  The fiance approved and asked it to be added to the dinner rotation.  After reading comments I doubled the sauce.  Also, I baked the chicken after browning it on the stove.

Oh...YUM!
Made this with my left overs - had some chicken breasts I already cooked the other night, cut them lengthwise into strips, spinkled lemon pepper and dill on them.  Warmed them up in butter and minced garlic.  Set the chicken strips aside and in same pan combined what I had in my fridge, milk, some sour cream, the capers and a smidge of cornstarch to thicken better.  Was super tasty.  My husband loved it.  I served his over left over mashed potatoes.  Awesome!!!

I loved this recipe!!  I did not have dill so I used Italian blend and instead of the lemon pepper I used a savory lemon spice that had pepper and other spices in it.  I added 1/2 t ground mustard and 1/8 t cayenne pepper.  I also saute'd mushrooms before adding the cream ( I used half and half) and took them out with a slotted spoon to reserve the juice.  Then I added the cream, cooked it added the mushrooms and capers and cooked until the thickness I liked.  Very Delicious.

This was fantastic. For seasoning, all I had was lemon dill and garlic powder and that was perfect.
For the sauce, I would suggest using a whole cup of whipping cream and we even added a touch of flour to thicken it. If your thinking of skipping the capers, I wouldn't! They added a really nice savoury side to things, even my wife loved it and she was apprehensive about the capers. Oh and I added fresh sauteed mushrooms to the sauce - just a personal preference. This is a great recipe!

Made this for the 1st time last night. Husband gave it 5 stars. Followed other reviewer's suggestions and added some garlic & mushrooms and deglazed the pan with white wine. As we wanted enough sauce for the egg noodles, we did double the amount of cream. This was a Super-Easy recipe that we will definately make again.

Great, Great, Great!  As other reviews suggested:  
add garlic to saute the chicken, dredge chicken in flour then saute.  I also deglazed the saute pan (after chicken was done cooking) with a little chicken stock, then added heavy cream.  My kids absolutely loved it, will definitely be making this again!

This was very yummy!! My fiancé and I loved it! It was a bit too salty so next time I will use 1/2 tsp salt instead. I also used a little bit of baking powder to slightly thicken the sauce. Definitely double the sauce!

I made this dish for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit.  I couldn't believe how well all the tastes mingled together.  I made the sauce on the side and served the chicken by itself because a lot of the people at my house are picky and wouldn't eat the chicken with the sauce on it.  It worked perfectly.  My only suggestion would be to double the sauce, I like a lot of sauce and it didn't go very far.  Can't wait to make this one again!

This is a great recipe for beginners. I would suggest some uniformity in the chicken breast halves, though. I found that having uneven sized chicken pieces caused the small ones to be dry when cooking for the specified times. Not a flaw in the recipe so much as the cook. But I am learning!

This recipe was delicious and super easy. Next time I will take the advice of others and double up on the cream sauce; it just was not enough to cover the whole thing. It was even better the next day for lunch!

This was pretty tasty.  The blend between the butter, dill and capers, was simply fantastic!  It blended very well with the flavors of the chicken and complemented it almost flawlessly.  I only wish that I had made more of the sauce, it was soo delicious!  I was a little disappointed in the toughness of my chicken (completely my fault) as I had to reheat it since it hadn't cooked completely through the center.  It took away some of the tender juiciness of the meat, which would have made this dish even better.  Besides my personal kitchen blunder, this was a very good recipe, so good in fact, that my two boys (5&6) gobbled it right up then asked me for seconds :)

Very nice chicken.  I don't digest most milk products well, so I have to be careful with them.  I decided to try to using a little bit of milk and greek yogurt instead of the cream in this.  It worked okay, but it curdled, so I shouldve tempered it.  Other than that, it tasted really good.  I enjoy the flavors completely--the creamy sauce with the capers and chicken are wonderful.  I'm not as sold on the cream sauce as I am on lemon piccata, but I'm not as big a fan of cream sauces as I am of non cream sauces--due to the lactose intolerance.  Still, it's delicious and if you like cream sauces, you will just love it.  I probably will make again, this time  trying with tempering to see if it will work with the yogurt.  thanks for the recipe!

LOVE IT!!! 
I found this recipe last year thinking what am I to do with that bottle full of capers in the fridge. 
Tried it last night. 
I didn't use lemon pepper, but I used freshly ground black pepper. I doubled the sauce and served it on buttered spaghetti with shaved parmagiano on top. My husband loved it and he even licked his plate clean. The sauce is really to die for. YUM!!!

My husband said "this could be the best chicken I have ever had". I followed this recipe exactly except for doubling the sauce- it was outstanding. The ingredients are so simple that it is hard to believe that the combination is so incredible. He already asked if we could have it again this week.

This recipe is really simple to make. It also tastes awesome. I did add just a touch of garlic powder to the sauce to give it a little more flavor.

one of the best recipes I've ever made. I added a little extra dill and lemon pepper to the sauce and it made it taste exceptional! Definitely make extra sauce because its so good you might want to stick your face in it.

Excellent!!!! The flavor is so rich and wonderful. I too felt the need to double the sauce the second time I made it (hubby liked it but said it needed more sauce). Meaning, I doubled the butter to 6 TBS and added a couple of fresh minced garlic cloves. The heavy whipping cream was increased to 8oz. I also deglazed with 1/4 cup white wine. Thickening took quite a bit longer than 2 minutes. Lastly, I squeezed half of fresh lemon juice. Served with rice!

Have a very picky family and this fits the bill.  I keep the capers to the side for the people that want them.  I double or triple the dill, lemon pepper, and garlic powder (we like alot of flavor).  I leave out the salt and let people season to their liking.  I have also noticed that some blends of lemon pepper have salt in them which can make the dish too salty.  I usually pour in extra heavy cream into pan since we like extra sauce for some angel hair pasta.  To thicken the sauce more quickly, I add about a teaspoon or two of cornstarch to a little water (1/4 to 1/2 cup), stir and then add to cream (looks like thin milk).  Stir cream over medium heat until thickens.  If sauce gets too thick, add some more cream or if still too thin, add more cornstarch and water.  I also use thawed frozen chicken tenders.  I thaw them by putting them in hot water.  I pull the tendons out with some forceps (again, picky family).  These cook very quickly 5 to 10 minutes over medium high to high heat.  They always turn out tender.  It seems like alot of work, but the more I make it, the easier and quicker it gets.  Just remember, equal parts of the dill, lemon pepper, and garlic powder.  And use cornstarch and water to thicken sauce.  I can make this in about 15 to 20 minutes now.  I feel like I'm eating at a fancy restaurant.

My entire family loved this-even my picky 5 year old!  Quick, easy, and so yummy.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I just used plain.  But I did add a little lemon juice and pinch of flour to the cream sauce--fabulous!

Has ANYBODY tried this recipe as written? It sure doesn't look like it. It's WONDERFUL as is! I followed the recipe to a T, and was happy at the result. Thanks, Mommyto2boys!

My family loved the recipe! I doubled up the sauce just like other reviewers, next time I might just cut down on the salt a bit- but it was delicious.

This is a really good recipe! I didn't have any lemon pepper and so I instead sqeezed 1/2 a lemon into a plastic storage bag and 1 tsp of black pepper along with the rest of the seasonings and shook it to coat the chicken prior to cooking.  I squeezed the other half of the lemon into the sauce while it was cooking and I left out the capers (personal preference).  Next time I'll try the half and half others have suggested for part of the heavy cream.  Everyone loved it!

Wonderful! My husband said to add this to our recipe box. I added a few things, I sauted onion and garlic in the butter before the chicken. Kept to the original spices but also added black and red pepper mix. While cooking the chicken I added mushrooms and grated broccoli. I intended to serve with pasta, but after doubling the sauce I cut the chicken into small peices and served over Penne with parmesan. So Good!

Made this tonight and my husband and I loved it! Like others, I added some white wine to deglaze the pan. Next time I will increase the amount of cream so there is a little extra.

The meal was a great blend of flavors. I made this recipe almost as is, except that I doubled the whipping cream. It was easy to make; the time to prep/cook was accurate. We have added this to our list of recipes to make again.

Very good and easy to make.  I didn't have any lemon pepper so I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and dill.  I sauteed the chicken in olive oil instead of butter.  I de-glazed the pan with lemon juice, added the cream, some garlic, and capers and put the chicken back in for a few minutes.  I served it with mushroom risotto.  My 5 year old declared the chicken "delicious".

Great recipe! My husband and kids are very picky and don't usually want to eat anything too "spicy."  They all loved it.  I changed the whipping cream to 1/2 and 1/2 because that's what I had and it's also a bit leaner for my diet requirements.

This recipe was fantastic.  I did as some of the others suggested and doubled the cream sauce.  I did saute some garlic before adding the whipping cream.  I am not much on breaded stuff, as another person suggested doing to this great recipe.  This recipe stands alone without the breading.  It was great, with some steamed broccoli, some red roasted red potatoes, hot rolls and white wine.  I have a dinner party in 2 weeks and will use this recipe for my guests.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

Wow!  This was perfect, plus it is Atkins friendly.  I didn't have dill or lemon pepper so I used lemon grass plus 1/2 lemon to de-glaze the pan.  I did double the cream for more sauce as the chicken will soak it up if you let is sit 5 minutes.

I made this last night and my husband said, "WOW"!  Something different to do with chicken.  My children, however, did not care for the capers.  Might have to improvise their portion.  We loved it hough!

Made this for dinner, and have to say this needs to have Ten Stars. As with some other cooks I also lightly floured the chicken breast, and 1 1/2 times the sauce. I served it with a Pasta. Will definitely make this again. This is a must have recipe.

Really good, I should have spooned the sauce out of the pan as the first couple portions did not get many capers and the last portion was overwhelmed but it was still good.

Kind of new to real cooking and this was my first sauce reduction (and first Cream Sauce), really turned out easier than I thought.  Definitely doing this one again.

Great recipe... I sauteed some sliced mushrooms and minced garlic in the butter before adding the chicken. I cut the chicken breasts in smaller pieces and dredged in a little flour that had the seasonings mixed in. Wow, the cream, butter, and drippings made for an excellent sauce!

Excellent!! Really tasty. I'm a rookie cook, and followed the recipe as noted, with two exceptions: I added garlic to the butter when frying the chicken, and used heavy whipping cream. It was delicious! Thanks for posting!!!

Absoulutely delicious meal!  I doubled the sauce as well and only used two chicken breasts and flattened them out a bit.  I never have liked capers before, but for some reason, all of the spices and the capers work really well in this meal together!  Great recipe!  It's work making!  My husband went back for seconds!

The recipe was fabulous. 
the only change I made was that I seasoned my chicken with spices that we like. I skipped the dill weed and lemon pepper. The rest was spectacular.

This was delicious and had a nice flavor.  I scaled the recipe for 6 instead of 4.  I added a little more cream for extra sauce.  I think the sauce needed more salt, so I added more to suit our tastes.  Served with egg noodles and veggies.  Makes a great sauce for the noodles too. Thanks for the recipe.  UPDATE: my husband ate this late after work and he didn't care for it.  He thought it had a "wierd" flavor.  I think it was the capers.  However, me and the teens liked it, so it'll get made again, but only when when dad is not eating.

I was honestly disappointed with this recipe. I had such high expectations because I love capers. Pretty sure the dill week ruined it for me. It also could have been because I didn't make it exactly as written. I didn't have heavy whipping cream on hand, so I combined 3 tbsp unsalted butter with 2 tbsp flour and 6 tbsp unsweetened almond milk (all I had) to make a heavy cream-like mixture. I also used varied this recipe by using much less than a whole tsp of salt. Finally, using my nonstick cookware, I do not cook anything at medium-high heat, so I cooked the chicken longer at medium, which resulted in blackened chicken on the outside. Still learning cooking techniques, but this one was a fail.

I used half n half instead of cream, and added a splash more than called for.  Also made them with boneless/skinless thighs.  Those were the only changes I made.  Great recipe! Thanks!

My 4-year old son's favorite food!  This is nice enough for company, easy enough to make on a weeknight.  I've made it with whipping cream, whole milk, skim milk, etc.  It's certainly best with whipping cream, but still good with the less-fatty milk products.  Also, fresh dill gives a nicer flavor than dried dill, but it'll be great with whatever you have.

This was delish.  I doubled the sauce but left out the capers because my kids won't eat them.  It's a mental thing.  Will definitely make this again.

Femeril LOVES this dish!!  My Boyfriend really liked it too.  It is relatively easy to make and there is only one issue.  There isn't enough sauce at the end of the cooking process.  The sauce is so good...you are gonna want to rub it all over yourself!!!  I didn't think that it was going to turn out very good but WOW!!!  I'm making this dish for a dinner party that we are having this weekend.   I always Add a squeeze of FRESH lemon juice and use 1/2 cup of white wine to deglaze the skillet. Thank you for an EXQUISITE recipe MOMMY!!!

We all thought this was amazing. This would be something I would pay for at a resturant. The major change I made was the cooking method. I put everything (except cream) into a pan and baked for 35 minutes. When chicken was done I added all the drippings to a skillet with the cream. It turned out great.

YUMMMMMMY... I've been trying different recipes from this site about 3-4 times a week for the past year or so and this one is by far my FAVORITE!!!!!  I did add some freshly minced garlic in with the butter.  It added a nice little extra flavor to the sauce!!!  Since I only cook for 2 (me and the hubby), I only used 1/2 tsp of the spices to cover only 2 chicken breasts instead of the 4 that the recipe calls for.  The amount of sauce this recipe makes is PERFECT for 2 breasts.  I would suggest doubling the sauce if cooking for 4.  I served the chicken over penne and sprinkled with parmesan!!!!  OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!

GREAT recipe!!!  I couldn't stop eating it!!!  Here are the things I did differently . . . 1.  I used lemon & pepper seasoning salt so I left out the 1 tsp salt.  The chicken was salted just fine in my opinion.  2. After seasoning both sides of the chicken, I ended up with about 1 1/4 teaspoonful more seasoning mixture than needed (keep for further seasoning).  3. Used 3 tbsp of Smart Balance 50/50 stick butter.  4. The sauce was a good consistency without any help from flour or cornstarch.  Maybe it has to do with the fat content from the cream or the fat from the butter or the high heat . . .  I'm not sure!  5. You will probably need more sauce.  Maybe double the cream . . . if necessary use more butter and seasonings!

Delicious! Followed recipe aside from cutting my chicken breasts in half to make them thinner and adding a little extra cream to stretch the sauce. Not having had capers before I was surprised by the mustard-like flavor but enjoyed it. My husband devoured it!

I did like recipe said  but only used 2 breast , kept sauce the same I did not use dill on chicken breast I just used it in the sauce and I used 1/2 amt of  dill. Bf said this is a keeper and  capers were new for him too.

Y.U.M.M.Y.!!  I served this with plain couscous and garlic bread.  I made a few changes to the original recipe.  I used plain bread crumbs and added the seasonings to it- the lemon pepper, dill weed, garlic powder and salt.  I dipped the chicken in egg then coated it with the bread crumbs.  I warmed olive oil in the skillet and added minced garlic.  Cooked that for a minute and added the chicken.  I cooked the chicken stove top for a few minutes on both sides and browned it.  I then placed it in the oven on 400 for about 10 minutes to continue cooking it through.  Just before it was done, I warmed the skillet back up and added about 1.5 cups of cream and cooked it like the recipe said and then added the capers.  I really think the breading on the chicken helped to hold in tons of flavor!!  It was amazing and there was enough cream to cover the couscous as well!!

Delicious!  My daughter asked for "some kind of saucey chicken" for dinner, and I came upon this...lucky for us!  I had everything I needed except for the heavy cream, but half and half worked just fine, and I will just use that again the next time I make it.  Oh yes, there definitely will be a next time!  (I will also use my daughter's suggestion, and serve it over pasta.)  I agree with a prior review...it's elegant, but with such little fuss.

Fantastic!!!!!!  My husband is a very picky eater, I love to cook and he is only crazy about 1/4 of the stuff I cook (not because I'm bad at it, only because he's picky) and he LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this!!!!  Yay!

Amazing and simple. This recipe was so tasty. I didn't measure out the spices and maybe ued a little more than called for, but it was still very good. I also doubled the sauce recipe, I did not think it was enough for 4 chicken breasts (I like my food saucy)

I made this the other night and it was delicious.  I'd probably make it with less butter though, because it was a bit too buttery.  Overall, good flavor.  It'd probably be good on tilapia as well.

I've been using chicken tenderloins more and more, as opposed to breasts. IMO, easier to cut and more tender after cooking. Try adding kalamari olives and sliced grape/cherry tomatoes (add when you do the capers). I also turned the heat on low and let everything simmer for 10-20 minutes. One thing: double the cream...I use 1 cup and you get more sauce. Very tasty with angel hair pasta. I had a similar recipe (with the olives/tomatoes) in a slow cooker (minus the cream) but this is easier and quicker to make.

I actually think the capers were a little too much, and will cut the amount next time. I also had some extra sweet onion laying around, so I added it when the chicken was almost done, and whisked it with the sauce, which was delicious. Other than that, I did everything according to the recipe. Thanks!

I followed the recipe but I marinated the chicken in McCormick Garlic Herb and Wine Grillmates marinade.  I tripled the sauce and added minced garlic to the melted butter before adding the cream.  I used 2 parts whipping cream and 1 part heavy whipping cream.  I also added mushrooms and a touch of white truffle oil...  OMG!!!  This will knock your socks off!!!  Enjoy!!!

Delish!!  The first time I made it with the chicken, leaving out the capers (because my husband doesn't like them)and it was delicious.  I've since made the sauce with the capers and poured it over baked salmon.  I also added fresh lemon juice to the sauce and was great over the fish.  It thickens up quit nicely.  Next time I'm going to try using half and half to at least save on a few calories.  Try it...you won't be disappointed.

Very good!  I halved the butter and added chicken broth to moisten it up.  I used a bit of regular milk and added flour to the sauce to thicken it up.

This is such a wonderful recipe and pretty easy and quick to make too.  I don't think that I used as much salt and spices as called for, but just sprinkled on probably about half as much.  It still came out delightfully flavorful.  I used fat free half and half because that's what I had on hand and I thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch.  The sauce was very creamy.  I believe the next time I make this, and I know there will be many next times, that I will decrease the fat to 1 T butter and 1 T olive oil.  I did make changes to the recipe, but none that I feel compromise the taste or quality of the original.  The changes were made mostly for dietary reasons.  Super recipe!

This was great! I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, garlic powder, pepper, salt and dried dill. I also added white wine to the skillet and let it simmer a little before adding the whipping cream and capers. Delish!!!

I have tried this recipe today, and even though I have "adjusted" it, I will give it 5 stars! It was a wonderful meal and I was very proud of myself, b/c my Hubby actually commented on it (and he usually doesn't ..LOL) Changes I made: I marinated the chicken breast in a mixture of Lemon & Orange juice, with fresh dill, salt & pepper for about 45 mins. Then I followed the recipe, I sauteed green onions & garlic with butter before putting the chicken in, but as the chicken was almost done, I poured the juices (lemon & orange) while it was finishing cooking.  And the last touch, I put some more fresh dill in the sauce.....I know, it might change the basic recipe quit a bit, but it was good, nicely tangy and creamy....yummy definitely a keeper.....enjoy it!

Oh yum, this is the best recipe ever.  My husband asks for it all the time.  I did double the recipe for the sauce and I used 2% milk to cut out some of the fat.  Also I pound my chicken pretty thin, really helps with tenderness.   Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

Very tasty. After reading other reviews I decided to deglaze the pan with a few splashes of white wine. Also, I served it with pine nut couscous. Next time I will serve with pasta.

Wow! Hubby couldn't stop talking about this dish, said it was like something you'd get in a restaurant, even used the word "phenomenal". And from the cook's perspective it absolutely couldn't have been faster/easier to prepare.  Made some minor changes - 1/2 salt, 1/2 lemon pepper (not a fan), a little garlic in with the chicken, used a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan, and doubled the cream. Served it with a side of asparagus. Wow! Phenomenal!

Incredible. The sauce is amazing. Adjectives forever. But there isn't NEARLY enough of it, which is the ONLY reason I'm deducting a star. Triple the sauce and you will love yourself. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe was fantastic.  I used light cream and doubled it as many of the reviews mentioned.  I served it with steamed broccoli and penne pasta.  My husband and kids loved it.   Next time I would try fresh garlic but otherwise it was delicious.

I must have done something wrong because it was so salty we could not eat it. I gave this a 5 star rating though because I plan to make it again with less salt and will rinse the capers before mixing them in. I believe this will make this dinner real good. Just add less salt. You can always add more later.

When I went to make this I did not have whipping cream, so I used half and half. I also did not have lemon pepper so I squeezed a fresh lemon over the chicken and some black pepper. I did add 1 clove of crushed garlic to the butter in the frying pan. Even though I did not have the exact ingredients it turned out very good. Will difinitely make this again, it is so easy. 3-15-2012 Made tonight using cream. Sprinkled chicken with spices about 2 hrs. before cooking. Added 2 minced garlic cloves to the butter in pan. Followed directions, mm mm good!

This was FANTASTIC!!!!  The only thing I did any differently (and it was b/c I let the pan get too hot after I removed the chicken...) was to add a little Sherry to break up the pan drippings before I added the cream.  I also put a sprinkle of garlic and dill in the cream sauce.  My picky eaters GOBBLED it up, and even ate the "weird looking capers".  My children NEVER eat things that look different.  I will be making this again for SURE!!!!! Thank you!

recipe tasted like the product of a good french restaurant.......for those who feel that the recipe lacks "taste", increase by 50% the 4 spices that coat the chicken prior to cooking.

I love this recipe. I used lemon juice on the chicken. I added some olive oil to the butter to prevent burning. I also doubled the sauce and it was just the right amount. However, i did not double the capers per personal preference.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I halved the chicken and make the same amount of sauce and it was really good.  I think I will make even more sauce next time since I liked the cream more reduced than 3 minutes.  Very simple and quick and the capers are tasty and make the dish just a little fancy.  To make it quicker I did brown both sides of the chicken and pop it in the oven at 350.  I let the chicken finish in the oven while I made the sauce in the chicken pan...any dripping went right back in the sauce!

Very good even my two sons 8 and 5 yrs approved and they are picky! I sauted the chicken in a little extra olive oil  butter and I did not use the capers and used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. Added a little lemon juice, salt and pepper to the sauce and served it with a side of angel hair pasta and garlic bread. YUM!!!

Simply incredible.  My wife and I loved it.  I didn't know that a chicken dish could be this decadent.  Stick to the recipe and resist the urge to add any salt at any time...the capers take care of that in the end.
GREAT!

This was a very tasty recipe. However, making the cream sauce was tricky. The heat was too high and burned the cream the first time. YUCK! Luckily I had enough ingredients to try again. On lower heat, I was much more successful.

EDIT: Made this again with the thin-sliced chicken and it was much better. Still had to doctor the sauce, though - I just find the original recipe a bit bland. Sorry!

I followed this recipe to the T but then found the cream sauce to be really bland? I perked it up with some extra lemon juice and sherry, and that was tasty. I would definitely make again, although next time I would use thin-sliced chicken and my adjustments to the sauce.

I was so happy I made this. The only thing I changed was doubled the whipping cream and added garllc with the butter. It was hands down the best chicken ever. So savory. My husband said it was better than dining out. I have to say I am on the expert level of cooking and I was very impressed. Thanks so much..

holy quick, easy and yummy!

as many others have commented, the sauce can be doubled and you won't be disappointed.

i changed a few minor things - browned the chicken in a mixture of 3 tbsp olive oil and lemon juice (2 splashes) instead of the herb mixture recommended.

i saved the herbs for the sauce concoction, as they taste more fresh that way.  i did not use the lemon pepper since i already added lemon juice to brown the chicken.  and i do not feel you need to add salt with capers in the recipe.  i also used fresh minced garlic in lieu of powdered garlic and added some black and red pepper (just a wee bit) to taste.  and of course, the dill weed, which balanced out the saltiness very nicely.

i must say, i have tried other lemon caper sauces before and this one turned out the best by far.  i served it with an asparagus risotto and they really complemented one another nicely.

thanks for the foundation for a delicious dinner - my hubby ate 2 pieces of chicken and my 13 month old son gobbled it up!!

This is a very tasty dish and very simple to make.  I followed the proportion for each ingredient as directed with the exception of the lemon pepper, which I added a tiny bit more of.  Safe to say, it turned out great.  Of note, the cream sauce came out darker than shown on the photo.  I also cooked the coated chicken breasts in the oven for about 20 minutes at 275 degrees to make sure the inside was well cooked.  I then browned the chicken in the skillet as directed and afterwards, I prepared the caper cream sauce, with heavy cream sauce rather than whipping cream, in the same skillet.  The sauce was a bit salty, most likely because of the capers, yet, it turned out tasty.  I will definitely make this tasty chicken recipe again.

This sauce is very forgiving, so you can use what you have on hand.  I added an onion with the chicken, but the onion overcooked.  Next time I'll saute onion and mushrooms after I've cooked the chicken, and add the sauce to that instead of capers.  Great recipe and great starting off point to make your own adjustments.  Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious. I did not double the sauce and served it on a bed of rice. It tasted yummy but hubby wanted more sauce so I will have to double it next time. I did not have whipped cream so I used milk with 1 tsp of cornstarch. I understand what others say about sauce being more decadent if made with whipped cream, however we enjoyed it with milk as well and saved some calories too. I also did not have lemon pepper so I rubbed lemon juice on chicken and added some black pepper. Wonderful and easy recipe. Thank you so much.

A deceptively simple recipe! I skipped the salt, and garlic powder, and instead added minced sauteed garlic to the cream sauce (I doubled the cream per previous reviews). This is so delicious! Served it with grilled asparagus and garlic mashed potates. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a guy tonight, and I think he wanted to propose to me after tasting it. Seriously. The only changes I made were: marinated the chicken overnight in lemon juice, Italian dressing, mustard, and white wine. I deglazed the saucepan with white wine before making the sauce, and I doubled the amount of cream and capers. Served the chicken with cheesy mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. This man would not  stop raving about the food. I might receive flowers tomorrow just because of this chicken.  :)  Success!

This has become a regular for my wife and me. There is nothing to change with this recipe it is perfect as is.  Be careful this the temperature as it is easy to turn the sauce brown in the heat is too high, doesemt change the flavor jus tnot as appealing to look at.

The flavor of this recipe was very interesting (but in a good way!) because of all the different herbs/spices. However, it was a tad bit salty, and I even cut the amount of salt in half. This could be user error though.  After finishing dinner, I noticed that my lemon pepper seasoning contained salt, as well. Next time (and this is definitely a keeper!) I'll omit the salt that the recipe calls for completely. VERY good recipe!

This turned out great. I made it with a few modifications:
- I used (boneless, skinless) chicken thighs insteas of breasts.
- I marinaded chicken in lemon juice (+water), and used pepper instead of lemon pepper, as others have suggested.
- Instead of garlic powder, I used minced garlic, frying it some before adding cream.
- Instead of using dried dill, I sprinkled fresh dill on top afterwards.

Very tasty.  I followed some advice...marinated in the lemon juice for 15 min.....deglazed the pan with white wine and doubled the sauce.  Personal choice. the sauce was a little thin for me so next time I will thicken by adding some butter and flour to make a roux before adding the cream.

I've made this many, many times and the results are always flawless.  We forget in between how much we love this recipe.  We've also tried it with fresh basil and oregano instead of capers and dill, and whatever herbs are used it's fantastic.  Thanks for sharing!!

We thought this was OK for a change but if I make again I will deglaze my pan with wine and leave out the capers along with making more sauce.

My sauce didn't seem to turn out right but the chicken itself is fantastic. I marinaided the chicken in the other engrediants before cooking, substituting lemmon zest and juice, along with pepper, for the lemmon pepper seasoning. The absolute best chicken ever!! I now make this all the time. (chicken then can be baked or fried)

Pretty good. Picky husband said it tasted too lemony. I liked it though.

This was DELICIOUS!  I doubled the sauce portion and added more capers (love them!).  Served over angel hair pasta.  My son picked the capers off, but told me that the chicken was the 'bestest he's ever had'.  Presents well, and truly does look and taste like a nice meal you'd find at a restaurant.

FANTASTIC! The only difference I made to the recipe was that I used 6 chicken tenderloins rather than breasts since that is what I had. Other than that, I followed everything to the letter, and served it with fettucini alfredo, broccoli, a salad & bread. A definite pleaser & repeat dinner in our house! Thanks so much :)

This recipe is really delicious and impresses dinner guests. Restaurant-quality meal. I like to make double-triple the sauce and serve with bowtie pasta. We love capers, so I also add plenty of extra.

Pretty tasty! I deglazed the pan with about a half cup of white wine. I also used half and half. Very tasty but I think next time I will add a lot more capers. It needed some more I think :)

This has become my favorite chicken recipe, which is saying a lot, since I raised chicken for years, and still eat chicken 3 times a week... The last time I made this (2 days ago) my boyfriend insisted on grilling the chicken--we use thighs-- This was absolute heaven, like knee-buckling good.  Just the best!

It was the first time for my family trying capers and we love it! This was a very quick and easy dish. I dipped the chicken in flour mixed with dill weed and lemon pepper; omitted the salt and garlic powder; added fresh garlic; used olive oil instead of butter. Everything cooked up nice and quick.

Very good recipe. I actually marinated my chicken in lemon juice for about 3-4 hours and sauteed them in the oil with garlic and butter. I had to cut them up into quarters/fifths because they were a little thick. I also used double the whipping cream and extra capers..as capers as a favorite of mine! Very good flavor. I wasn't sure how it was going to taste because I've never had dill and capers together before, but it gave off a nice flavor. Not too much to where it hits you in the face. Just right! Served over fettucinni with a side salad.

The chicken was surprisingly flavorful!  The only thing I added was more pepper and next time I will use 1/2 the salt, it was quite salty.  Thanks for recipe!

Made this last night and it was very good with a few suggestions! I would definitely go with doubling the sauce and making sure chicken is not cooked too much. I think next time I'm going to rub lemon garlic on chicken and let it sit for a few hours before cooking. The chicken was tasty, but could have used a just a little more flavor. All in all...a great recipe! I will definitely make again.

Excellent!!  I also did as other reviewers said and doubled the sauce and used entire jar of capers (a little too much, but I love capers so it was fine with me... husband left a few off to the side).  Other than that, followed to a tee.  I served over egg noodles.  Superb recipe!  Can't wait to make again.

Great Recipe!  My entire family loves it.  Everytime I make it for guests they want the recipe.  I do change it a bit--I bread the chicken and fry in olive oil and then make the sauce and pour over the chicken.

I followed the advice of others and marinated the chicken in the fridge with the spices.  I found the sauce to be lacking in flavor and extremely bland, even after taking suggestions to add fresh garlic.

Was this good! I followed someone else's advice and marinated the chicken in lemon juice for 15 min. I also mixed ground pepper, dill and kosher salt together and sprinkled a generous amount on both sides of the chicken before frying. While the chicken was being kept warm in the oven, I made three cups of sauce with a whole jar of capers. The extra sauce was wonderful and the family put it over penne pasta and brocolli. Can't wait to try this out on guests.

The sauce didn't thicken as well as I had expected, maybe next time I'll add a little cornstarch.

This chicken was very very good!  The dill gives it a lot of flavor.  The capers just add to the flavor and make this an exceptional recipe.

I honestly believe this is the best recipe I've ever tried from allrecipes.com.  And it's so easy to make.  The caper cream sauce is divine (think I'll double the amount the next time!!!)

This was a fabulous recipe! The only "changes" I made were to pound the chicken breasts flat, add a minced garlic clove to the melted butter, and double the sauce as other readers suggested. I only used two chicken breasts (there are only two of us), but doubled both rub and the sauce. This was indeed a meal for company. Thanks!

Either I used too much seasoning on the chicken or this recipe calls for way too much salt....it was soooo salty!!! I would double the sauce next time and leave out some of the salt.

This was great and extremely easy.  I made both chicken breasts and boneless, skinless thighs.  I saved all the drippings to make the cream sauce and it was very yummy.  Definitely will make again.

Excellent, very easy recipe.  I used too much of the seasoning on the chicken.  But next time I will know better.  LOVE the capers.  They make the meal.

Very easy dish and I loved the capers at the end to give it a tangy taste, my man loved the dish, he said it was so professional and the browned chicken with the creamy sauce was an excellent combination.

This chicken is ridiculously delicious. In order to decrease the fat content, I make it with fat free half and half and whole milk. It's just as good.

This was OK but it didn't "wow" me.I only used 3 breasts; pounded them a bit, then patted them dry & gave them a very light coating of flour. I omitted the salt entirely (the capers will add plenty of sodium) & decreased the lemon pepper. I had intended to deglaze the pan w/ white wine after cooking the chicken but discovered the only white wines I had were kind of fruity, so I used chicken broth instead. I really wish I had used white wine...it would have added the flavor I think this sauce was missing. I used a cup of half & half instead of half a cup of heavy cream  but did not increase the capers...in hindsight, I probably should have. They were the best thing about the sauce. I added a little Wondra flour (non-clumping flour used in sauces & gravies) to help thicken my sauce some. Like Sunflower, I was a bit turned off by the brownish color the chicken drippings gave the sauce. In the posted picture, the sauce must have been prepared in a fresh pan to get that lovely creamy color. I served this w/ basmati rice cooked in chicken broth w/ sliced grapes added & Garlic Green Beans (from this site).

Honestly? I was going to give it 3 stars. I thought it was just ok tastewise and definitely not visually appealing (chicken drippings give the sauce a weird brownish color). Cooking the sauce in a separate pan would certainly help. Also, the sauce needs to be doubled. Even if this is not one of those "swimming chicken" recipes, 1/2 cup whipping cream would hardly coat one chicken breast! However, my boyfriend seemed to appreciate this: he ate two servings while not being a capers fan! And I must say I liked the spices mix used to rub the chicken. i might re-use it for another recipe! All in all, thus, a 4 stars. But I won't bother making it again.

I always look at the the nutrition info before making a recipe and I was more than a bit surprised by the sodium content. When I viewed the recipe it was apparent by the teaspoon of salt the dish suggested for only four breasts. Salt should be used to enhance a recipe, not dominate it. Between the butter and capers, that was enough sodium for us. I'm not fond of browning chicken and then pouring sauce over it, so once the sauce was made, I let the chicken simmer for a bit in order for it to flavor and soak up this wonderful sauce. I used a combo of butter and evoo to brown the chicken and once removed, added flour to make a roux. I then added at least three cups of fat free half and half and it was delicious. By themselves, the capers added a distinct flavor, however, I don't think they added all that much to the overall dish. My family enjoyed this meal so thank you mom of your two little guys" for submitting this very nice and recipe.

I felt like I was dining out when eating this chicken!  I made a few changes/substitutions.  I added sauted mushrooms to the sauce and used evaporated milk instead of the heavy whipping cream since I didn't have any, and omitted the lemon pepper b/c I didn't have any of that either!  I also pounded the chicken so it would cook evenly and it also tenderizes it.  I will make it again with the correct ingredients and mushrooms.

Easy recipe!  I love the ingrediets -- dill, lemon, capers, cream, butter.  You just can't go wrong with those flavors!

I did use fat free half and half but had to use corn starch to help it thicken.  Next time I may use reduced fat evaporated milk.  I'll also double the sauce as other viewers had mentioned.

My husband thought I went overboard with the dill (not me!), so next time, I'll cut that back.  But I did use fresh dill, so that could be the reason.  I also love capers so an entire small jar went into my conconction -- perfect!  I did not use the lemon pepper, but did add fresh lemon zest, lemon juice and freshly cracked pepper to the sauce while stirring.

I'm thinking the next time, I'll experiment with julienned sundried tomatoes!

Very good recipe!  I used a pint of 1/2 and 1/2 as others suggested and threw some extra garlic in at the end.  I used a whole jar of capers because we love them and they were just the right touch!  In the future when I make this, I will use fresh lemon zest and black pepper because the flavor of a real lemon can't be beat!  Thanks for this recipe!  YUM!

I found the herbs etc.. on the chicken breast over browned when cooking which resulted in a slightly burned taste. This could of been my fault for having the stove at a high heat. The flavour aside from the burnt taste was quite nice. Using fresh herbs and adding them too the cream while it's reducing may be a better option.

This recipe was so easy and the taste is fantastic!

Like other reviewers, I would recommend you at least double the recipe for the sauce - it was so yummy and I keep wishing we'd had more!

I didn't have lemon pepper on hand, so I seasoned with regular pepper & the other spices and added a little lemon juice in the sauce mix.  Everything was wonderful and got rave reviews in my house!

I will definitely make this again!

I found the sauce a bit bland, but my husband LOVED it! I used a pint of cream as suggested by other reviewers, and added extra capers to compensate. I think next time I'll try adding minced garlic to the butter at the beginning of the recipe and also adding some garlic in the cream at cooking time. The chicken was delicous, and I served the mixture over egg noodles, again suggested by another reviewer. I'm so glad I tried this recipe!

YUM!! This recipe has only a few ingredients making it quick and easy.  I also pounded the chicken to speed up the process.  There didn't seem to be enough sauce so I used a pint of whipping cream and added some chicken boullion(to compensate for the chicken drippings) and served the chicken and sauce over egg noodles.

I made this, and it came out very good, and very tasty. I didn't have dill, so I didn't use anything in it's place.  I will add a few more capers next time, they really pull the flavor out of the chicken.  Also added 1/2 cup white cooking wine and a 1/4 cup more whipping cream to make more sauce.  Perfect!

When my husband loves a new recipe, you know it fantastic.  Watch the salt.  Capers, butter, and on the chicken was all a little too much.  Next time, maybe unsalted butter and/or eliminate the salt on the chicken.

Delicious! We had thicker chicken breasts so I cooked longer. Also I just seasoned the meat without measuring.  I used half the recommended capers and the family loved it! Thanks for an easy and good recipe.

This was delicious. I didn't have cream so I substituted with cream cheese ( that's all that I had at the time).
I would use the cream cheese again. It was a big hit for my family.
I used a tablespoon of softened cream cheese and let it melt from the heat of the pan.
Yummy

This had nice flavor.  Cooked 2 chicken breasts.  Used same amount for sauce and it was good. Had 1/2 and 1/2 and it curdled.  Why?
I will make again soon.  Thanks for the recipe.

I think this is a great base recipe.  Like others, I dusted chicken with  seasoned flour.   Sauteed the shallots and then deglazed with white wine.  Made twice now and I love it!

Very nice recipe, quick, easy and delicious! I made it as it was written with the exception of doubling the sauce. I can imagine that fresh garlic, as mentioned by others, would be even better. I don't always love chicken, but this was a keeper!

We love this recipe!  It’s quick, inexpensive and savory.  I do use a ton of dill, probably a couple of tablespoons versus the 1 tsp the recipe calls for.  It’s a fantastic meal idea for a weeknight, especially if you’re due for a trip to the grocery store and find you’re running low on options.

Alright y’all, I had to do a lot to this recipe to make it work. Double everything except the salt and chicken. I made the sauce and the then put the chicken in it and left it on medium heat for 20 minutes. Then I took out the chicken and added a whole cup of heavy cream and started the sauce again.

OMG, what a wonderful recipe full of brightness and depth.  I  didn't give five stars because based on other reviews I made a couple changes.  Did not use lemon pepper, just salt, pepper, and garlic powder on chicken.  I did cut the chicken breast in half, just so I'd be sure were cooked properly (Hubbie can't stand undercooked chicken).  Deglaze cast iron skillet (the only skillet that ever should be used) with 1/4 cup vegetable broth...it's all I had in the pantry.  After adding cream, squeezed fresh lemon juice into it and whisked as directed.  Also, as others, I doubled the sauce...Hubbie said, make sure you don't lose this recipe!  Thanks to Mommyto2boys for submitting.

This exceeded my expectations and it was so easy! I even marked it as good enough to serve company. The only change I made was to use half and half instead of cream. I'd probably use cream for company, but it really was delicious with just the half and half.

I doubled the cream (I used light cream since that's what I had on hand).   I hadn't used all of the spice mixture on the chicken, and since I doubled the cream, I added a little more of that to the cream.  It was super easy and delicious!  Everyone in the family loved it.

It was just ok, sort of bland. Next time I would make a roux or dredge the chicken in flour to thicken. Perhaps a 1/4 cup of white wine to deglaze the pan would have helped as well.

I wasn’t sure, but I made it and I liked it. 

I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter to pan fry. 
I used a stainless steel fry pan, so I used a lower heat. 

When it looked like the chicken might start to burn, I added a tiny bit of chicken stock.  Several times. This allowed very nice browning, but no burning. When I added cream/capers at the end, the sauce had a very appealing colour. 

 Not an every day recipe for me due to cream, butter but definitely a nice occasional treat.

We loved this! Before adding the cream,  I added 1/4 C. of white cooking wine to deglaze the pan.  May have made it a bit thinner, but had delicious flavor.  Next time, I will cut down on the salt, because with the capers plus the salt, it was too salty.

I love it. I didn’t have lemon pepper so I rubbed the chicken in real lemon juice and followed the original directions. I didn’t double the sauce but next time I will, it was so good.

I made this for my wife last night as she loves capers. I served it with fresh home made pasta from the Lexington Pasta Company so I increased the amount of cream sauce. I butterflied the chicken breast and pounded them slightly.  The  meal didn't look like the picture as the cream sauce was white.

However it was delicious and my wife asked me to do it again. Definite do over!

It’s a little salty so the second time I made it i only used 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Other than that it was a huge hit! Definitely putting it into the rotation.

7/15/2019 This was easy AND delicious! 
Pounded the 3 chicken breasts a bit to cook them evenly.
And added a little more cream and capers for some extra sauce. But, went by the recipe other than that.

I pounded my chicken flatter.  I am a huge fan of capers but didn't make extra sauce. Next time I will.

Very delicious and easy. I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand. I used just under a pound of chicken tenders which reduced cooking time. I served over rice and the sauce was just enough for the reduced amount of chicken. I didn’t have lemon pepper so I used regular pepper and added lemon to the sauce. I added fresh oregano as I have an abundance. I also added sun dried tomatoes as I had some on hand.

Love this recipe! So quick and easy. Like other reviewers, I usually deglaze the pan with a little white wine, and I add more cream than called for so we have more sauce. Today I was out of dill so I substituted dried basil and we liked it even better!

I made it as written, except I used a whole 4 oz jar of capers.  The sauce was perfect just by whisking for 3 minutes, and no thickener was needed. It ended up being a little salty, so if you end up using more capers, omit the salt on the chicken.

I didn't have cream, so used coconut cream instead for the sauce and doubled it.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing and we really liked this!  The seasonings make it so good!  (Real cream would probably be better but it was good with the swap, and along with olive oil, this would make it a dairy free dish, if you need that).  Thanks for the recipe, we will be making this again!

Great recipe!  I infused garlic in the butter, used white wine to deglaze the pan and after it was reduced added the heavy cream & capers.

Really easy to make, and very tasty.   I put in a splash of cooking sherry because last time I made it, I felt it needed a little something.  Next time I'll use less pepper and more dill weed.

Made this one, followed the recipe EXACTLY.  It was too  good.  I ate two chicken breasts - the caper cream sauce was, a brown sauce, and amazing.  I did carrots as a side.

I've made this three times now and the first time I wasn't sure about it, the second time I thought it was okay, but on the third time I really figured out the ratio of cream to capers.  The key is to really make sure the capers are washed and drained.  My husband and I think this is one of the best recipes on the site.

I like that it is quick and easy yet tastes gourmet. I highly recommend using naples version.  The wine added and light breading  definitely helps.

This dish is ridiculously good. I used chicken strips and deglazed the pan with white wine. I also sautéed three garlic before adding the cream because I love the flavor. Wow!

Substituted Creme Fraiche for the cream and it was DELICIOUS.  I think the more sour flavor of the creme fraiche achieved a similar effect as would get from reducing with wine or adding lemon juice. Since the creme fraiche is already thick there was no need to reduce.  Also drained but did not rinse the capers as we like the flavor.  The amount of sauce was fine possibly because there was no need to reduce. Will definitely make again with the cream and try first deglazing the pan with white wine.

Absolutely delicious!  Even my daughter who never eats “ hunks of chicken” devoured 2 pieces!  Did put extra dill and lemon pepper in sauce for a little more zing. Not a heavy cream sauce!  Perfect!

This dish came out wonderfully.  Family loved it.  It has great flavor and a nice presentation.  I served it with mashed potatoes and chives, and a nice garden salad.
My changes will be:  My stove burns very hot even on low so chicken and butter started to burn.  Next time I'll use a lower heat then recommended to accommodate my stove heat level.

"The chicken, which I seasoned only with salt and freshly ground pepper, developed a much more appealing look and color dredged in flour before sauteeing. Once I turned it over I covered it just briefly to make sure it was cooked through. After removing the chicken to set aside, I deglazed the pan with about 1/4 c. of white wine, then added the cream, a good squeeze of lemon (didn't use the lemon pepper at all), and now the dill."

Excellent and tasty! I needed more cooking time for the chicken to get them browned (even after cutting each breast into 2-3 pieces), but that may be because the chicken had been frozen and wasn't completely dry. Leftover chicken was wonderful in an alfredo pasta the next day.

This was excellent!  After reading the reviews I did double the sauce. Made a very minor change by deglazing the pan with a small amount of white wine and added  a squeeze of lemon. I will definitely be making this again and again.

This is so good, with so few ingredients!  I substituted lemon juice  as I didn't have lemon pepper and put about a half a tablespoon more capers in.   Will make double the sauce next time, as I also had steamed broccoli with this dish and it would have been even better to have some sauce for that as well. Excellent!

Talk about an easy & delicious recipe!  Tiny adjustments I made were; used two large breast halves and butterflied them for thinner slices.  Reduced the garlic powder in half.  The flavors in here bring a party to your mouth. Plan to serve this at my next dinner party. Daddy's chickie is terrific...thanks!

Wonderful recipe! I used chicken tenderloins, tossed in spice mixture and let sit for 15 mins. Cooked chicken in butter turning only once and covering loosely with foil. Once chicken is set aside I added a little olive oil to the butter, a tablespoon of minced garlic and juice of a whole lemon to deglaze the pan. I too wanted more of the glorious sauce, so I added a full cup of whipping cream and cooked over med heat and added the capers. Hubby said this is the best thing I’ve made so far and I agree! Served over linguini noodles. Added photo. Thank you for a great recipe!

I usually don’t like chicken breasts but this recipe turned out delicious. Nice and creamy. I’ve never used capers so it was a surprise to finally taste and use them. Fun recipe would make it again.

I have to admit that I am giving it 5 stars based on the modifications in the reviews. I used wine to deglaze (sp?) the pan. Added extra cream, some lemon juice and salt and pepper only on the chicken before sautéing. It was excellent.

I usually try to rate recipes as written, but I thought this recipe would be too bland compared  to what my family is used to. After reading some of the other reviews, I used some of the suggested changes and came up with some of my own. This recipe would be OK as written, but with my changes was excellent. For the chicken, I melted the butter, sauteed 3 minced garlic cloves for a couple of minutes, pounded the breasts to an even thickness, dredged them in flour, salt and peppered them, sauteed them until done, and put them on a plate covered with aluminum foil to keep warm.  For the sauce, I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup white wine,  then added 1 cup whipping cream (condensed milk can also be used), 2 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice, 1 tbsp. fresh chopped basil, 1 1/2 tsp. fresh chopped thyme leaves,  1 tbsp. fresh chopped parsley, and 2 tsp. dried dill weed. I brought the sauce mixture to a boil whisking constantly, turned down the heat, and simmered, whisking constantly, until the sauce was reduced and thickened. Then I added 4 tbsp. capers, heated a couple minutes, plated the chicken and spooned the sauce over the chicken. This sauce would also be wonderful over whitefish fillets, and it was a definite 10 rating as I made it.

I used chicken cutlets which are very thinly sliced chicken breasts.  They cook up even quicker so done in less than 25 minutes.  Husband loves anything with capers and the cream sauce was delicious.  Wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company.

Amazing!! I made this last night and it is definitely a KEEPER! The only modifications I made (because I did not have lemon pepper on hand) 1 lemon  -juice & zest-  poured over chicken prior to adding the spices on both sides. Per other’s recommendations, I also cut the salt in 1/2. It was perfect!

FABULOUS!  I made it for my book club, and they raved about it.  However, the seeds should be removed from the lemon before slicing.   I used a 2 mm slicing blade on my Cuisinart, and the lemon slices were perfect.  

I had my butcher slice the chicken for me, which was a mistake.  The slices were very uneven.  Although I asked for 1/2" slices, some of them were almost an inch thick.  So, the cooking of the chicken took forever.  Next time, I'll partially freeze the chicken, and slice it in the Cuisinart.  

The sauce preparation went lightening fast.

This recipe is so easy and tastes amazing! I used thin sliced cutlets pounded slightly and cooked about 3 minutes on each side - otherwise I followed this recipe to a T and it was fantastic! The sauce is so good and creamy without being too heavy. It’s just the right amount to top the chicken which I was pleasantly surprised had a lot of flavor given the simple spices used! Great quick recipe for a weeknight dinner!

Outstanding.  I added cream cheese and sour cream, but next time I'll make it exactly like the recipe says.  It would be milder as the cream cheese adds a little sourness and I think the original recipe would be richer.  Love the capers!

I made this because my Mother said it was wonderful.  And it was!  I only made two changes.

1.  I used less salt because 1 tsp. seemed excessive, even though I use Kosher (I hadn't read the comments).  I will use even less next time.

2.  I did not add the capers because the cream sauce was already a bit too salty.  I loved this without the capers and will likely not use them when making this again.

So easy and packed with flavor.  The butter and cream made a spectacular gravy for the chicken.  Definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe!!!! It’s so flavorful and absolutely delicious. I don’t like capers so left them. Other than the capers, I followed all ingredient and instructions and it was not skimpy by any means. It was perfect!

I made this with pork chops. It was so good. I used whole milk because I did not have cream and it was still delicious. Next time I will try it with cream!

OH MY GOSH this was AMAZING!!!! & Easy!  I added the seasonings to the sauce, and made a little extra, I think I would make even a little more next time, maybe using a full cup (or more) of heavy cream.  I served it over spaghettini with garlic lightly fried broccoli & zucchini.  Definitely a new family fave!

This was amazing! Made for my boyfriend and friends and everyone loved it! The seasoning combination on the chicken really turned the simple cream sauce into something five star. I made the recipe as written, except for doubling the cream and capers. I wanted to make sure I had extra sauce since we were having  white rice with it. I also served some peas along side the dish. Will definitely make again!

Other than using half and half and a little flour to thicken sauce at the end, kept true to recipe. Delicious and whole family loved, including my picky children.

Fairly easy to make, juicy and flavorful sauce.  My husband loved it.  I made it as written but used 2 large breasts, doubled the whipping cream and added 3 Tbl of capers.  I cut the breasts up into 3 pieces each, but wish I had filleted the thicker pieces to make them all even for cooking.  I'm glad I doubled the cream.  I thought I might need to add some cornstarch, but it thickened very well without it.  I don't think I'll increase the amount of capers next time, though; I generally like the taste of some salt in my dishes, but the extra capers made it a little too salty.

This turned out delicious. I gave it 4 stars because even with rinsing the capers off it was a little salty. next time I will half the salt. I used half and half because we didn't have any cream. I also cut the chicken into chunks to get them to cook faster and then poured the half and half over the chicken after it cooked. Needed to add a little corn starch to thicken the sauce. We ate it over spaghetti noodles and my kids loved it.

This was very very good, quick & easy. People with think you spent a lot more time cooking than you actually did. I pretty much followed the recipe. Had no capers so used extra fresh ground pepper. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing

I really enjoyed this recipe and will definitely make again.  I followed a couple of other reviewers' suggestions and seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and lemon pepper, then dredged the pieces in flour seasoned with garlic powder and dried oregano.  I sauteed the chicken in a garlic oil / butter combination and it tasted great even without the sauce.  I simply eyeballed the lemon juice and just squeezed a couple of fresh wedges directly into the cream sauce, then added the dill weed and capers.  I served it with a side of pasta tossed with brown butter and mizithra cheese... It was fantastic!

I had some extra heavy cream left over from the cajun pasta dish on here, and luckily i found this recipe to use it up! I doubled the chicken, deglazed with hefty splash Chardonnay (watch out for the flames!), and used 1 cup cream to make more sauce. It still was a bit skimpy on the sauce, so i cut up the chicken in smaller pieces to make sure that it was all able to be coated in the sauce. It was DELICIOUS! Definitely something that i would purchase again from a restaurant! Everyone loved. Yum!

Great recipe. Very easy to make and also delicious. Alterations- I chose to use fresh dill and garlic instead of dried dill and garlic powder. Also, I used one chicken breast cut into strips instead of 2 whole chicken breasts for 2 servings. If you choose to use 2 chicken breasts like the recipe states, I would recommend that you double up on the sauce.

I've made this several times.  I seasoned the chicken and then flattened it out so it was the same thicken all over; this also pushed the seasonings into the meat.  After the first time, I doubled the sauce. Delicious, and a great meal for company.

Instead of seasoning the chicken breast with all of the seasonings, add them to the cream sauce to give it more flavor. Also I had to triple the amount of cream sauce so that when I put it over a bed of rice, so it was not dry. Overall great recipe

I’ll try this recipe again but I made it exactly and the flavor was odd and off my expectations. Only added a bit of paprika but that shouldn’t alter taste that much.

It was a really good dish and I will make it again. I made a few variations with amounts but pretty much used the recipe guidelines. I like to saute in butter and olive oil and I did shake a little flour over one side of the cutlets. We always use organic chicken and dairy products. I've been in the food business for a very long time now and I figure I'm going to live just so long so I don't skimp on ingredients. I don't care for lemon pepper so I used real lemons. Served this with cauliflower and couscous, and it was delicious.

I have to admit that I love a good sauce. This was very good but I felt as though something was missing. I would definitely make this again but I might finish the sauce with a bit of acid or add in some white wine after cooking the chicken. I do not have lemon pepper so I used black pepper. My kids (ages 6,4 &1) devoured the chicken and  were circling the kitchen taking little bites of the chicken as the walked by. The chicken was delicious yet simple and sometimes simple is what we need! I added fresh dill to the sauce & loved it!!

I read many of the reviews and ended up tweaking it like naples34102 recommends. With those changes it is a solid 5 star recipe. This is our new favorite dish with capers!

This is by far the best chicken recipe I've ever tried! I follow the recipe in detail and I change nothing. first time I used iron skillet and my sauce burned and became very brown, even thought burned the chicken was delicious! Second time I made it in a regular skillet and I doubled the sauce. I ended up having leftovers and I must say the chicken tasted delicious two days later! I generally don't like reheated chicken but this was different.  from now on this is how I make chicken. Thank you!

I loved the recipe and will definitely make again. As for my minor changes I deglazed my pan with white cooking wine and floured the chicken.  I added the chicken back to my caper sauce in the cast iron skillet. I then added Jasmine rice to the skillet, topped with parmesan & mozerella cheeses and broiled until bubbly.

The sauce was great, the salty bite of the capers but I think it was the mix of seasonings sprinkled on the chicken that made it yummy!  Served over pasta like a piccata. This one's a keeper!

Very good. I baked two chicken breast with the directions with all but lemon pepper which I didn't have so I used half a large lemon (juice) and my favorite add on- garlic. Everything else I followed directions adding a little boulian from the chicken to the cream. I had no idea what capers were which just are salty. Easy to make and tasty.

I made the following changes:  I blanched chicken in water cooking about half way through then followed the recipe cutting the amount of capers down due to the briny spur taste they gave to the sauce.  The chicken was very moist with the blanching. If you love capers then keep the amount as is in the recipe.  I served with a side of rice and buttered broccoli.

My compliments to the man that developed this recipe, it was spectacular! I doubled the sauce, other than that I made exactly as written. Served with "Easy Pilaf" recipe also on this site and a spinach salad, it was a dinner made in heaven. I'm always looking for new ways to prepare chicken breast, this was a winner!!

I always try to make recipes as directed the first time then make them my own. I wish I had followed the advice of other reviewers, because this really lacked flavor. The sauce was ok, but the chicken was bland and boring. I found a different chicken picatta recipe all together on this app and it was so much better. This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.

It was okay- A very rich sauce, but not much taste at the same time. I ended up adding my own spices to enhance the flavor a little bit.

First time making this and it was awesome! I did make a few adjustments , I didn't add Caper added portobello mushrooms instead , used a whole 16 oz whopping cream because I made 6 chicken breast. I did use the lemon pepper, garlic salt, and onion powder which gave it some amazing flavor. I also used 6 tablespoon of butter for the amount of chicken I made. I did have to add 2 teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken it up. This is going to be my family's favorite 
for awhile.

Simple and delicious.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream but added a few teaspoon of cornstarch to stop the sauce from separating.  (Less fat will cause curdling without added cornstarch or butter)

This is an all-around great recipe! Super quick and easy to make.  I didn't include the dill weed (as I am not a huge fan of dill) and it was still delicious. The sauce, though simple, was incredibly good, as well!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The only change I made was doubling the sauce. I double the sauce on most recipes. Thank you for this recipe. I love capers and now my family does also.

All agreed at family dinner that sauce was very tasty, but chicken was too salty.  I will make this again,  but use only 1/2 tsp salt.

You really need to double the sauce. I followed Naples adjustments and the fresh lemon is the way to go.

This is a great, fast, easy recipe. I didn't have heavy whipping cream on hand so used 1/2 C 1% milk, 1/2 TBLSP butter and 1/2 teaspoon corn starch instead. It probably wasn't as rich tasting but tasted light and I loved the zing of the capers. Perfect weeknight meal!

I liked this, but I thought the sauce was a little bland. Next time I will add some of the seasoning from the chicken into the sauce as well, just to give it an it more flavor, and I think that will bump it from 4 stars to 5.

I made this for the first time tonight and I didn't have dill so used Herb d'province which added a totally different flavor but my husband really liked it.  Right now I live outside the U.S. so it wasn't like I could pop over to the supermarket and get some dill.  When I get back to the U.S. in 2 months I will make it exactly to recipe and hopefully he will love it even more.  It's a great recipe that I will work to perfect.  Thanks!

My kid used up the heavy cream as coffee creamer so I substituted low fat cream cheese. I used 4 oz of the cream cheese in the same step as the heavy cream. I melted it and used half and half to get it into a cream sauce. It was really good - very nice taste! Will make it again.

Couldn't believe how good this tasted considering how quick and easy it was to make! I can see this becoming a regular week-night dinner. I served it with the Orzo and Rice recipe, and spooning some of the sauce over top of it was delicious!

I used lemon juice & cracked pepper instead of lemon pepper (personal preference), a whole jar of drained capers, & about 16 oz  quartered artichokes.  The taste was close to that of a favorite local restaurant. The hubs wants this on a regular rotation. I'm going to try it with shrimp sometime.

Salt and peppered 2 thighs, then dredged in flour and pan fried. Removed from pan. Added 5 chopped garlic cloves, a handful of sliced mushrooms, a handful of fresh dill, and 2T capers and brought to a simmer before adding 3/4 c cream and a small splash of lime. Also salted to taste. Served with baked potato. There was plenty of sauce for the potatoes as well. Also cooked Fried Casserole 2 from here with it for an extra veggie and meat.

Excellent and yummy.  Followed recipe except like other reviewers I dredged the chicken in flour before sauteing.  Served with roasted zucchini also from this sight and rice.  Leftovers were also good.  Will make again for sure.

This was a great, and very easy! recipe.  I added minced garlic to the butter and chopped onions to the sauce step - added great flavour and consistency.  I also didn't have whipping cream so I used regular milk and a sauce thickener.  Fab, quick dinner!!

Loved the sauce.  I doubled it to have plenty.  I also cut the chicken breasts? into smaller pieces for faster cooking and easier eating.  Will definitely make it again.

I used half and half instead of the cream and added just a little corn starch to give it a little body.

I will absolutely make this again. So easy! Next time I will drain the capers, but not rinse them. I think the brine will add flavor. I also pounded the breasts a bit so they would cook evenly and to tenderize. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Loved this recipe.  It was simple and a quick fix for my husband and myself.  The flavors were savory.  I did use boneless chicken thighs in lieu of breasts.  This will be a standard rotation in my  cooking.

Followed to the letter. Way too salty. Sauce was greasy and separated as soon as it was plated. I will try again with no salt as the capers are salty on their own. Also would use olive oil instead of butter and deglaze the pan with a little white wine, wisk in a little flour to make a rue before adding cream. Has potential with a few changes.

This is an easy recipe and fairly quick.  I think next time I will add a little more seasoning to the chicken.  The same ones, just a little more.  I would also make a little more of the sauce (adding an extra 1/4 cup whipping cream).  I put the chicken and sauce over rice and would have liked a little more sauce on my rice. Otherwise, this was a great recipe for a quick, tasty meal.

I prepared this according to the recipe. It was delicious. I added sliced mushrooms (prepared) while chops cooked in sauce. My wife and I think it is one of the best recipes we have ever had.  We will make it over and over.  My wife's comment was "this is company food."

Followed recipe to a tee, but my chix breasts were thick, so used a lid to cover to make sure they were done & cooked for 30 min on a low flame.  Seasoned with all the suggested spices.  I thought lemon pepper and dill a strange combo - I was wrong - it is fabulous.  When chix done, put on platter with lid while I deglazed pan with white wine (like others).  I don't think it was necessary.   Added a bit of chix bouillon to wine & cooking goodness in pan.  Let it  reduce, then added 1/2 & 1/2 & capers.   This made a beautiful meal with asparagus & long grain & wild rice box mix.   Late home from work, had purchased fresh skinless, boneless chix breasts & lucky me, found this recipe.  One of the best for chix breasts, I will make this again.  Thank you for this recipe.

Super easy and delicious - great for company as it makes a nice presentation! Added a bit of sherry to the sauce and thought about adding mushrooms but had none. My super picky son even liked it (but thought the capers were peas!_

Delicious! I had to substitute another spice for the lemon pepper because I was not aware I was out of it when I started the recipe. I don't think it made that much difference. I made a bit of extra sauce, and wished I had made more. We really liked this a lot and are fighting over who gets the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

This dish is amazing.  I followed Naples34102 recommendations and cooked the chicken with s/p.  Then I deglaze the pan with 1/4 of wine,  added the spices (garlic, fresh dill, fresh lemon juice, capers and cream).  Returned the chicken to the pan to heat through.  If it thickens up I just would add more wine or chicken broth.  Its a keeper.

My husband had kitchen duty tonight and made this recipe for two adults and 4 teens so we doubled the entire recipe but followed it exactly.  We loved it BUT the next time will cut back on the salt and probably deglaze with some white wine first.   It was way too salty for our tastes.  It is a fairly simple, easy to make but still delicious recipe.  Thanks!

This is one of my standby recipe.s  Easy enough for weeknights but equally impressive for company!
I saute mushrooms in garlic with a splash of white wine then add the cream or half-n-half, whatever I have, then toss in the chicken for a couple minutes with the capers.

My wife and I are always looking for a quick and easy meal. This fit the bill and was tasty. We didn't use capers because we didn't have any. I would probably cut the salt if I used capers so as not to make the dish excessively salty. We also used tenderloin instead of breast. We will make this again. Good enough for company.

This was excellent, however I did make some changes that probably Improved it. I used skin on/bone in breasts. Mixed salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and parsley with some flour, dredged the breasts in this mixture. Browned the breasts in oil. Removed after well browned. Added some white with e to the pan, deglazed. Then added the capers, etc. And continued as directed for the sauce. Once the sauce was complete, returned the breasts to the pan, covered, and cooked on low heat until the breasts were cooked through.  Excellent, moist, tender.

This chicken is fantastic.  So easy to make, and so tasty.  I have my own slight variation.   I squeezed some lemon juice on the chicken breasts as they were almost done cooking.    Either way it's a great dish.

Loved it.  I didn't have cream so I used low fat sour cream and it was wonderful.

This is a regular recipe in my household now. The only changes I made is I like to put flour on the chicken to make it slightly crispy. I mix lemon pepper with flour and coat in on the chicken before cooking it in the butter :) served over rice with the sauce, its 10/10~

We loved this! I did what other reviewers suggested and used fresh lemon.  I just put the breasts in a gallon size bag and squeezed one lemon in the bag.  I was prevented from making the recipe that night and they sat in the lemon juice for two days.  I don't think I would do it that long next time but even overnight would be great.  I also doubled the cream sauce and it was perfect! I will definitely make this again.

I think this recipe would be 4 stars as written.  Based on the advice of other reviewers I seasoned the chicken as written then dredged in flour prior to sautéing.  Also deglazed the pan with white wine, doubled the amount of sauce and added juice of half a lemon. I also used 2 chicken breasts, halfed and pounded thin for a total of 4 chicken portions. Turned out great, will definitely make again!

Wow! Very complex flavor in a very easy dish! Like other reviewers definitely double the sauce and it comes out perfect. I also deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine which worked splendidly. Putting this is my top favorite recipes! Absolutely delicious!

Very good. Probably 4star as written, but easily bumped up.  Added some lemon juice, garlic, a little garlic salt (be careful) and some parmesan cheese and that all helped the sauce a lot.  Doubled the sauce recipe and there still wasn't a lot of it. Next time quadruple the sauce recipe (2 cups cream) except use just 1 jar of capers.  Served with egg noodles.

I used real lemon juice, squeezed a little on the chicken before cooking.  The chicken was delicious and very moist.  I thought the sauce didn't have much flavor so added some dill, garlic, pepper and lemon juice to it also. We really liked it with the sauce modifications and will make again.

Very tasty! I did follow the suggestions of adding some fresh lemon juice and white wine. My only suggestion would be to triple the sauce.

Wow.  This one is a keeper!  I did marinate the chicken breast in lemon juice for about 15 minutes instead of using lemon pepper seasoning, and dredged them in flour before adding the spices.    Cooked, then deglazed the pan with white wine.  Served over rice.  YUM.

Made almost exactly.  After reading the reviews i didnt have enough heavy cream so I used milk leftover in the fridge and I did dredge the chicken in a little flour to make sauce a tad bit tighter.  Only thing I didnt have was the dill weed.  Next time will use dill weed to see if there is any difference in taste.  Quick and easy to make.

Sooo yummy!!  I followed this recipe almost to the 'T' and my husband (who is fairly particular) and I LOVED it!!  It is pretty simple to make, and the only changes I made was reduce the salt by half, doubled the sauce and used lemon juice to deglaze the pan before adding cream. I served over rice. My 18 month old daughter even liked the rice, she's currently anti chicken..  I will definitely be putting this into my regular rotation and making often!

I served this chicken over some buttered pasta.My family liked it. I happened to have some fresh dill so, I chopped some and used instead of the dried kind. It gave the dish a lot of flavor. I will try to always use fresh dill when making this dish in the future.

We made this tonight, and it turned out great. Like others, we doubled the whipping cream and capers, and we needed to cook the chicken a bit longer than listed here, but we used thick pieces.

This is an awesome recipe did follow the recommendations of using wine to deglaze prior to pouring cream, also added a teaspoon of lemon juice. Served on a bed of brown rice. After deglaze I used a pint of sliced mushrooms, and let them simmer till ready for cream. Only because we love mushrooms. Served with steamed broccoli and cauliflower. Very moist!!

Love this but I make the breasts into cutlets. With flour and the seasoning together dredging the cutlets then browning in Olive Oil and butter.  I sometimes add a quarter cup of white wine to creating the caper sauce.  We love this on rice or pasta. Planning on making this with Salmon.  Very easy and the taste is like an uptown restaurant . Thanks!!!

I forgot to ask Kathy to get cream, so I faked it with sour cream, butter and milk...a little blah.  I will add lemon juice next time.  Also prefer chicken breast on the bone rather than boneless.

I love capers but this wasn't a good result--too salty, too little sauce, and the cream didn't enhance the dish.  I did use the left over chicken for soup, adding a cup of sautéed mushrooms, a cup of rice, 1/4 cup white wine, 3 cups of chicken broth, Rosemary, and freshly ground black pepper.  The flavor improved the basic chicken rice soup, so it was not a lost cause.

The recipe as written did not seem very appealing.  I followed the suggestions of multiple reviewers: I dredged the chicken in flour before sautéing in butter; I then deglazed the brown bits with a bit of chicken stock (1/2 a cup), then added the cream (1 cup), and  then the lemon juice.  After it was warmed up, I seasoned the sauce and added the chicken back into it, leaving it on low for a bit.  My family loved this - it made a great dinner.

This was a great dish! I did make a few changes though. I pounded the chicken breasts and dredged them in flour. I added salt, pepper, dill and garlic powder to the flour. Fried the chicken in butter and some olive oil. I also doubled the sauce and added dill, salt, pepper, and half a fresh squeezed lemon (foregoing the lemon pepper) to the heavy cream. I used the amount of capers the recipe called for but husband said the dish was a bit too heavy on capers - guess I'll do less next time. Overall easy to make and delicious!

We all really enjoyed this meal, and we have 3 kids. However, it was a bit on the salty side. I would reduce the salt by 1/2 next time. Definitely a keeper though.

This is by far the best recipe I've come across in a long time. I love the flavor of the capers and dill weed together! It was delicious just as written. I think it's best with mashed potatoes, because you can pour the cream sauce over them!

As written, this is a solid 4-star recipe. I have made this twice, once following directions exactly and once making changes. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs because I like dark meat better, seasoned with salt and pepper only and browned them. Setting them aside, I added a small minced white onion with about 2 cloves of garlic and deglazed with white wine. After reducing, I added the juice of one lemon and the capers and let it all simmer for a bit before adding the cream, a bit more than called for in the recipe. The end result yielded about twice the sauce called for and had a lighter color, which I liked better as a personal taste. I seasoned the sauce with salt, pepper, the dill, a couple dashes of cayenne, and some parsley. Returned chicken to pan and baked in a 400 degree oven for about ten minutes, basting every 2. Turned out beyond amazing, I'm having the leftovers for lunch today! Thanks for a great base recipe that is so very easy to alter to taste while staying true to the original!

Wow! So awesome. Wanted to take a picture but there was none left! I quadrupled the sauce because we served it over tortellini pasta and it was seriously so good. Next time I'm going to add a few cherry peppers to make it spicy. Thank you for posting!
Update: made another batch, this time I coated the chicken in flour as some reviewers suggested. This changed the consistency and the flavor quite a bit. I liked it much better without the flour!

This was amazing. Whole family loved it, even though they don't like capers. I did not have cream on hand, so used butter and milk as per other reviewers. We had it with spaghetti and four cheese sauce from Bertolli because the sauce from the chicken was not enough for the spaghetti. Next time I will double the sauce.

I made this for the first time and it was amazing!! I did make a few adjustments...instead of having lemon pepper seasoning, I used pepper in the seasoning and squeezed a fresh lemon on the chicken in the pan. I also used the small jar of capers and added some flour to the seasoning for chicken. As well as the others, I doubled the amount of sauce and it was perfect amount! Will definitely make this again!

This recipe seemed way too easy to get such high reviews but my husband loves capers so I figured - let's check it out. It was super easy to make and the only thing I did different was slice the chicken and serve it over jasmine rice but it was delicious and my husband (who doesn't typically rave over my cooking for good reason!) was still talking about it several days later. Great flavor and so easy to make! Thin chicken would be a little easier for ensuring it is cooked all the way through.

This was the best!  Definitely a keeper! I did noting to chance the recipe except I did not have garlic salt & instead put some minced garlic in with the butter. Would also consider doubling the amt of sauce as it made enough for 2 breasts.

Great recipe With a few changes . Doubling the sauce is a must do!  In a separate skillet  Sautéed 6 oz. of fresh button mushrooms and added them to the finished product. I  deglazied the sauté pan after chicken was set aside with a splash of white wine prior to adding the cream  which only enhanced the flavors. We love lemon and mixed  one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and 1/4 tsp of creole seasoning in the cream sauce. Terrific!!

I used a lighter cream and added 2 tbsp flour to the seasoning mixture I used to dredge the chicken. Finished the sauce with an extra pat of butter and served over fresh linguine. Absolutely delicious and whipped up so quickly.

This sauce is phenomenal!  I did only use 2 chicken breasts and the full amount of sauce as I knew we would want extra to use as a gravy on mashed potatoes.  This sauce has such good flavor from cooking the chicken in the butter first--all I can say is "WOW!".  We thoroughly enjoyed this meal and hubby said I could make this anytime.  I did add some fresh-squeezed lemon juice and a dash of wine to the sauce.  We truly enjoyed this meal.

I did the light dredge in wondera flour (it's very light) and seasoned it with salt,pepper, and Parmesan cheese). I sliced the chicken breasts into cutlets.  I also added artichoke hearts, and sliced mushrooms,and used heavy cream. I also added a couple tablespoons of sour cream. I serve it with sliced lemons. It is easy to add more of anything to your personal preference.Lots of raves!!! This is my go to dish for company

This was in my to-do list for a long time because we eat a lot of chicken  and I love capers but just didn't get around to it until last night.  What was I waiting for?!  Loved it.  Simple and quick.  Only thing I did different is, I only had two chicken breast but very large and organic.  I pulled off the meat on the under side and also, pounded them  to about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch.  Just easier to cook in the skillet like that.  Seasoning was the same with perhaps a touch more dill and lemon pepper.  Even though only two breast plus the chicken tenders from the underside  I doubled the capers.  Being a Chef John and cayenne fan, next time, I would add a pinch of cayenne.   Came out delicious and this will be put into the rotation!

Excellent as written, but second time made a few  changes...quadrupled the sauce (made 8 breasts), and also deglazed pan with some white wine.  After sauce started boiling added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and a pinch more salt.  It was delicious!!!!!

Made it and will make again.  Ingredients are simple to remember.  I too doubled the whipping cream and capers and NOW I have plenty of sauce left over to make another batch  today.  My 9 year old also loved it!!

Okay, so I changed the recipe some by combining 2 recipes; but I prefer the base of this recipe.  Here is what I did: Omit Lemon Pepper & increase Heavy Cream to 1 cup (We like a lot of sauce). After cooking & removing chicken from cast iron pan, add 1/4 cup White Wine Vinegar & 1/4 cup Lemon Juice. Whip the juice & vinegar to release chicken morsels from bottom of pan and cook over med heat until reduce by 1/2. Add Heavy Cream cooking until slightly thickened and add Capers.  **If serving with potatoes, chop the potatoes, toss & brown them in the pan after removing chicken (before adding lemon juice & wine vinegar), place potatoes in a microwave safe bowl, cover & finish cooking in microwave.

This was quite delicious using chicken tenderloins. But what I was thrilled with was that I came in very late and had to get dinner on the table quickly. This dish came together so fast! I had put left over rice in the freezer, so all I had to do was quickly defrost it in the microwave for a delicious dinner that looked pretty and tasted as though I had slaved over it.

Very good! I didn't have cream or garlic powder, so I fattened up my milk with butter and used fresh garlic. Turned out great. Next time I make it I'll use cream and it will be even better. I saw a lot of reviews that said it was too salty. I think the seasonings are given in proportions as in a seasoning mix. I assume you just season your chicken like you'd ordinarily salt and pepper it's about right. I don't think it's all meant to be dumped in, if that helps?

Four stars as written.  This is a very good recipe that with a few tweaks is sensational.  Marinated the chicken for one hour, added the juice and rind of one lemon in place of lemon pepper, two teaspoons of minced fresh garlic , 1/4 cup of dry white wine and increased cream to 2/3 cup. Place breasts in a plastic bag with lemon juice, rind, minced garlic, salt, fresh ground pepper and dill.   Removed breasts from plastic bag and cooked according to directions.   After removing breasts from pan added wine to pan scrapping bottom of pan, increased heat to a boil, added cream, reducing cream and following rest of cooking instructions.   Flavorful and moist.  Yum!

This meal was quick and easy to prepare. Perfect for a mid-week meal. I dredged my chicken in flour with the lemon pepper, dill weed, and garlic powder and sautéed it in a little vegetable oil and butter until browned and cooked fully. Also put lemon pepper and dill weed directly on to chicken before dredging. Then I removed them and added a pat of butter to pan and added minced garlic (1 TB) and added a cup of cream and lots of capers. I put the chicken over buttered egg noodles and served it with fresh asparagus. When the chicken was removed from the pan I deglazed the pan with a little white wine then added the cream and capers. Also I like a lot of seasoning so I added more of what went on the chicken in the cream (excluding salt, low salt diet) and more capers it was very simple and quick. I will make again. My husband loved it and so did I. Oh and I also cut two chicken breast to make them thinner and served the chicken on top of thin spaghetti with the sauce (that I doubled) over all. It looked gourmet. Delish!

We thought this recipe was terrific!  I realized that I didn't have any dill weed after I began cooking, so I used a couple of tablespoons of dill pickle juice from the jar.  It was excellent and also added more to the sauce. I wouldn't change anything about the recipe and I will definitely make this again and again.

This comes out so elegant for so little effort!  I reduced the recipe to one quarter as I am only one, but only reduced the sauce by half.  Next time I am going to try deglazing the pan with a little brandy and flame before adding the cream.

I loved it. I did make some changes, partly because I didn't have one of the ingredients so I improved. In place of the lemon pepper, this is what I didn't have, i used 1 tsp of pepper & the juice of 1 large lemon & I used fresh garlic & marinated the chicken  in that for around 15 minutes. For the sauce I use a whole pint of cream, because I wanted extra for the noodles & to take for lunch, & I cooked the chicken with onions, left them in the pan when the chicken was done & add 1tsp of dill, 2tbsp of butter, 1 clove of garlic & the juice of 1/2 a lemon then cooked as directed. I served it with linguini & steamed asparagus. I loved it & passed the recipe on to a bunch of my coworkers.

I tired this recipe and it was a winner! Absolutely love it! The things that i did a bit differently was i didn't measure the ingredients to cover the chicken and put quite alot on (which was amazing) and with the cream sauce, i added one and a half teaspoons of Mild Danish Mustard & about half a teaspoon of garlic. It was so delicious!! Will definately be making this regularly!

So followed directions, but the sauce curdled the first time. Luckily, I had extra whipping cream, wiped out the pan and tried again....better with extra cream.....but all in all, nice - Chicken had GREAT FLAVOR!

Wonderful and simple!  In fairness, we made it with tilapia instead of chicken, but really quite wonderful.

I made this as written except only two breasts. I decided to make the full recipe because everyone said to... But no need! There is no need to drown the chicken breast!

Brilliant recipe. So easy and very tasty. Served with basmati rice and a salad. Next time need to make more for leftovers lol Oh I used about 1/2 cup creme fraiche with the cream and it gave the sauce such a rich boost. Thank you for the recipe !

I used chicken thighs and doubled the sauce. The salty tangy edge of the sauce was delicious.  Even though I overcooked the sauce, it was still great.

I got a GLOWING review from the whole family!   I served it over La Piana brand Mezzaluna with butternut squash filling (like tiny tortellini). I made quite a few changes to the sauce based on other reviews. 
DEFINITELY double the sauce AT LEAST.  The sauce was incredibly rich, so you didn't need a whole lot, but even after doubling it I ended up making a 2nd batch.

My husband LOVES this one!  But what is truely wonderful is that an eight-year-old kid loves it too.  Those parents are doing something right by their kids!  Back to the recipe. When I prepared it the first time, the capers made the dish very salty and briney.  Second time I double rinsed the capers and backed off on the salt.....Perfect!  Now, I'd love to try this on my husband's grade school age grandkids.  They won't eat anything spicier than chicken nuggets with ketchup!  That's gastronomic child abuse, raising them with such limited, bland tastes.

My family loved it!  It was very simple to make.  I did add a bit of flour to the sauce to thicken it up a bit and once the sauce cooled down a bit it was perfect.  I also added an additional tablespoon of capers,  because my family loves capers. :)

Very nice. Had to use lemon zest and pepper instead of bottled lemon pepper.  And couldn't find the capers. But everyone enjoyed it.

Fantastic recipe.  Will definitely make again.  My sauce was thinner than what is depicted in the photo, so if you want a thicker sauce, consider using a thickening agent.  In any case, it was great just as it was!  Will be a "go to" chicken recipe.

I marinated the chicken in ginger garlic paste with salt and pepper seasoning and then pan fried it. Followed the sauce to a T and it was awesome. Served it with garlic Parmesan spaghetti and the whole combination was fantastic

Loved this! Simple and a wonderfully unique taste. I made it pretty much as described, doubling the sauce as others suggested...do this! Also, I highly recommend serving with some sauteed mushrooms (with garlic)....goes PERFECT with this along with a nice glass of wine. My kids liked it, husband and I loved it. Will definitely make again!

Just made it tonight and it was tasty!! The chicken took a little longer than expected but the sauce was faster than expected. We didn't have any lemon pepper, but didn't miss it. Definitely something to make again - quick, tasty, and easy!!!

I made this recipe as-is, but I think I will try the other reviewers' suggestion to use fresh lemon instead of seasoning. The seasoning has an artificial taste that I did not care for. I did double the sauce, and I think that was just the right amount. I will definitely try this recipe again because it is so easy!

This dish was absolutely delicious! Instead of using lemon pepper, I used lemon zest and juice which gave it a nice fresh flavor with the creamy sauce. I would absolutely make this again! The only thing I would recommend is going easy on the salt. With capers already being so salty, it was a little much for my taste. otherwise, a delicious dish all around!! I served it with sautéed vegetables and it was the perfect meal! Pretty simple too!

We love this chicken, even our young kids love it. One earlier review suggested adding Tony Catchere's Creole seasoning, and we absolutely agree. That will add more salt to the recipe, so I suggest a salt-free lemon pepper and not add any additional salt.

I made this and my husband loved it! He told me 4x it was good and this is a keeper recipe. The only thing I did different is slicing the chicken breast in the middle, not all the way, and put the spice in the middle as well, because I always found the middle of the breast has no taste. I would make more of the sauce next time. Very tasty! Thanks for posting this recipe!

Very good, my fiance said it was delicious.  This is  good comfort food on  a cold day.  I would make more sauce next time & add slightly more garlic & dill.  I also added a slight splash of Mamertino (my fave white wine) and served over garlic egg noodles. Next time,  I'll possibly serve with some garlic bread. Thanks for submitting - I will make again.

This was delicious!!! The only variance from the recipe was taken from some of the other recipe raters.  I used some white wine to deglaze the pan.  No need for any flour just let it reduce a bit.

This has become a go to in my house. So simple and sooo tasty. Don't over season the chicken. That was my mistake the first time I made this.

I've made this several times, and am always impressed with how great it is!  I double the sauce and add more capers.  I serve with mashed cauliflower, and it's always a hit!

I did not have any whipping cream handy so I improvised on the sauce.  I melted 1/4 c butter and added 4T Capers while it melted.  I then added 4 T of flour and let it thicken to a paste, and then slowly added milk, until it thickened.  It was amazing.  I will definitely make this again.

I used the 'adjust receipe' option on this site to make for 6 people.  It calculated 1 1/2 tsp of salt.  It also calculated 3 tablespoons of capers.  I don't know if it was the salt or capers but the chicken was so salty it couldn't be eaten.

I made this yesterday and my husband and I both loved it!  It was so easy to make and delicious. I was missing the lemon pepper, so I just used poultry seasoning instead of the other seasonings to coat the chicken. I also added garlic salt just because I love garlic. I think the key ingredients are the butter and cream and especially the capers for the sauce.

This recipe was delicious. I did, however, make a few changes. I did not have any whipping cream, so I substituted 2% milk and butter and I doubled the sauce. I also cut down the salt to a 1/2 tsp and added fresh garlic to the pan when cooking the chicken. In addition, I deglazed the pan with mirin (a chinese cooking wine) and served it with rice. My husband and 2 boys loved it. I'll definitley be making this again!

I don't want to say it was bad, but the flavors in this were not to our liking. I'll rework the seasonings to be more to my tastes if I make an edited version of this again. Namely I will omit the dill for a less sour, pickley taste and definitely leave out the nasty capers. They ruined what otherwise would have made it a tolerable dish.

I made this for my son and his family for Father's Day.  I have to say after reading the reviews, I made double the amount of sauce, I also added a Swanson, Chicken flavor packet!  This was so easy and quick to make and tasted GREAT!  It is a keeper.  I served it over Angel Hair pasta with fresh green beans.  My 5 year old grandson even ate it without complaining!  Try it you will like it!

Made this for the first time last night.  I did put about a tablespoon of white wine in the sauce, and used fresh lemon and dill on the chicken.  I thought it was okay, but I won't be making it again.  My son thought it tasted funny.  It was most likely because of the dill, and after thinking about it, he's not fond of pickles, mayonnaise or mustard.  He said he thought he could taste all three in the chicken and the sauce.  I've never cooked with capers, and he wasn't a fan of those either.  Just not a good recipe for my family.

We really enjoyed these. I used thin-cut breasts and deglazed the pan with white wine before adding the whipping cream (I used low-fat half and half and it came out great). My only issue was that it didn't have enough sauce, despite the fact that I doubled it. But the flavors worked really well together and I will definitely make this again.

So very good!  My whole family loved it and I will definitely make it again.  Made it as listed, but doubled the sauce ingredients.  We love sauce.  Used lemon Juice to have the spices "stick" and deglazed pan with a little sherry.  Great dish and super easy for a week night.

It smelled wonderful cooking, but somehow mine turned out too salty, even after rinsing the capers.  If I make it again, I'll leave the salt out of the seasonings and let everyone salt their own if needed.  Otherwise, I think the flavor would have been good, and it certainly was quick and easy.

As others have said, this 4-star recipe becomes a 5-star with the addition of real lemon and white wine in the sauce instead of using lemon pepper.  I also lightly floured the chicken before cooking.  Came out great!

I made this tonight, and it was a hit. My husband loved it. I didn't have whipping cream so I used 2% milk. It made a good sauce, but I know the cream would make it more rich. Next time I'll use whipping cream and some wine, and flatten the chicken. I had to nuke it for a minute. The sauce does need to be doubled. I served it with asparagus and wedge salad. Defiantly make it again.

I just made this and its delicious! Husband approves too. It was so simple and turned out great. I used Goya capers in a jar instead of dry capers.

The sauce for this was very good. I had never made anything with capers before. In fact, took me 30 mins to find it at the store (they were by the olives, btw). I think I will make this again and not use the capers just because I don't like the flavor. It reminds me of green olives.

This lady's husband is brilliant! I just coated my chicken with equal parts of all ingredients listed, browned it and removed it from the pan. I doubled the cream and reduced it until nice and thick added the capers and wow! This simple dish is worthy of special company.

This was amazing!  i added some minced garlic to the chicken breasts as they were cooking.  I also added some minced garlic to the whipping cream as it was heating for added flavor, once that was finished added the capers and chicken back to the skillet and it was delicious!  Made witha side of italian garlic noodles.

I loved the sauce. Wonderful. I don't think we find capers in New Delhi, but will substitute with something else.

Thanks.

Loved it! The dill was a flavor that went well, I was apprehensive first but went with it and I'm glad I did. I doubled the capers and sauce as many of the other reviewers had mentioned, this went well with my squashed potatoes and asparagus!

Wonderful recipe! I cut the chicken into small pieces,added Portabella mushrooms to the sauce, and doubled the cream sauce - like a lot of people did. I love the dill flavor and the capers. It's a great flavor and very different from something is normally try.

This was tasty as the recipe is. I added fresh lemon juice to the sauce to help cut the cream a little and give it a bit of acidity. I paired it with garlic quinoa and kale and sautéed asparagus.

This was fantastic! I tenderized the chicken and used puréed cannelloni beans instead of cream because my daughter is allergic to dairy. We also used a vegan butter alternative. The seasoning was great and the sauce very flavorful. My husband raved about it, which is very unusual for him! Thank you for the recipe!

I made this exactly as written with a few tiny exceptions. First, I pounded the chicken cuz that's just how I roll w chicken. Second, I used a full cup of heavy cream and smooshed the capers with a wooden spoon as soon as I added them to the cream. I would be confident to make this for company! ~Nola

Amazing!!!! The only thing wrong with this recipe is I think I practically tripled it and still wished we had more sauce! Once I started making more though I started just adding more seasoning without measuring anything. I put the chicken back into the sauce at the end(in bite sized pieces) and put that on top of fettuccini noodles. This sauce is to die for. Make tons-tippy can't go wrong! 
Side note- I did use some minced garlic also not sure how much.. probably two cloves

Loved this! The only thing I did different was season both sides of the chicken before frying, and doubled the cream sauce. It was so rich, will definitely make again.

Loved this one!  My only negative was that it was a touch on the salty side, but that is easily fixed!  Quick and delicious, just remember though, your cooking times may vary based on the thickness of your chicken.  Mine took much longer than the time recommended, and I covered the skillet for part of that to help keep moist.  My other half wanted more sauce, but again, easily fixable.  I definitely recommend!

This is great! Deceptively impressive. Nobody will know how easy it was. I try not to modify recipes the first time around, but I'm watching my calorie intake, so I used skim evaporated milk instead of the cream. It worked like a dream! I was also a little more generous with the dill and lemon pepper. This is definitely going into my permanent recipe box! A keeper!!

I tried this recipe twice now it was great both times. However we found there was not enough sauce, so we made more. Cream, capers, and black pepper.

The second time we added onions and mushrooms to the sauce it was great!

My family loved this recipe!  I marinated the chicken in lemon juice for 15 minutes and added fresh garlic when I cooked the chicken instead of garlic powder. I doubled the recipe for the sauce. My guys thought it was just a little too strong so I may cut back on the capers next time.  This one is a keeper!

This has such a fantastic flavor! I am just a novice cook and am not used to raves. But my family raved over this! The only thing I did was add a little chicken broth to deglaze the pan.

My husband is a very picky eater. Then I told him what I was making he was almost immediately skeptical, but he LOVED this. Every time we have company he asks me to make this. We served this with mashed potatoes and it was a great complement!

Made this recipe as shown but only used a pinch of salt instead of  full teaspoon.  Also, to ensure each breast was cooked thoroughly, I cut each  into quarters.  It made cooking the chicken a bit more work, but it was worth it.  It was super easy and super tasty.  Will be making this again!

Easy, quick and delicious! I followed the recipe with the exception of the dill weed because I was out of it. I'll try it with the dill weed next time. I served it with rice and asparagus. This would be a great dish for company. Looks like you fussed.

Probably shouldn't review this based on the couple adjustments I made, but I'm gonna do it anyways! I didn't have lemon pepper or dill weed so I didn't use any. Instead I added wine, and some honey mustard to the sauce (which i did double). It tasted great and it's super easy. 

Also instead of using chicken breasts I used chicken tender sized pieces which I seared on both sides with seasoning first, and then added to the boiling sauce to finish the dish in one pot.

I doubled the entire recipe.  Once I got done cooking the chicken, the pan was screaming to be de-glazed.  I used slightly less than 1/4 cup chardonnay wine and got all those tasty, crunchy goodies stuck to the bottom of the pan to release.  The end product seemed a bit too salty.  I think the brine of the capers were enough to satisfy the salty needs of this family.  Would cook again, but would cut back on the salt a bit.  I did not double the sauce as many have mentioned and was fine with the quantity of sauce produced.  The spice blend alone is worth keeping in the recipe box.

I was looking for a recipe to use the fresh dill in my garden.  I made this according to the recipe.  The only thing I changed was to use fresh dill instead of dried dill, which I doubled to 2 tsp. This dish was fabulous!  The flavors worked well together, and it was easy to make.  I made a little extra to freeze, and had the leftovers last night.  This meal froze well, and was almost as good the second time when microwaved from the freezer.  I will make this again and again!!

This was awesome and very easy. I did make double the sauce.  After pulling the chicken from the pan I sautéed 3 cloves of garlic in the butter for about 3 minutes, then added the cream till warm then added about 1 tablespoon of flour.  I pulled from the heat and added the fresh dill, capers, and juice from one lime.  Kids and husband loved it.

Being single I don't often make meals that take some planning.  However, this was so easy and fabulous!  This meal reminds me of when you are finished with a great dish in a restaurant, that you say no to dessert because you want to savor the flavors of your meal!  When I make this again, I will double the sauce!  I would also cut the salt in half or leave it out!!  Brava!

Ok. So I made this but I switched it up considerably.

I took some tips from naples34102 and added my own twists too.

I coated the chicken with almond flour because of a need to be gluten-free and then I removed it from the pan and then added a little olive oil, then added some shallots and fresh garlic. Once they sauted a couple of minutes I added the white cooking wine to de-glaze the pan.

Once that was reduced a bit I added the cream.

Then I plated the chicken and put the sauce over and spread the capers over it.

It was delicious!
I am known as "Dial-A-Cook" amongst my family and friends. They call for advice and recipes. Some of my recipes have been published in the King Arthur Flour 1st addition of the 200th Anniversary Cookbook.

Very good chicken recipe. I doubled the sauce as many others mentioned; however, I did not double the capers, and they were still a little strong. Next time I'll use less capers or find some seasonings, perhaps lemon, to offset some of the caper tang. Otherwise, very yummy and will definitely make again. Thanks!

Made this successfully, (meaning made deliciously), with mushrooms (16 oz) and two zucchinis instead of chicken. Followed everything to a T, but did a bit less dill; I find it very strong. Delicious!

Awesome blend of favors with the ginger and the capers. I think I will try fresh grated ginger next time and some fresh garlic. I used sour cream and some half and half since I didn't have heavy cream on hand. Added some fresh parsley as well. This dish was easy and will be a frequent choice at our house!

My husband and I liked this.  My daughter said she didn't like the dill.  I got her to try a caper, and she didn't seem too fond of that, either (but that doesn't surprise me -- she's very picky).  I fixed three chicken breasts, and cut them into cubes because I thought that would work well with the sauce and pasta.  Deglazed the pan with chicken broth.  Omitted the salt (we try to do lower sodium), and didn't miss it at all.  Used half & half because that's what I had, and doubled it.  I thought it was easy and turned out well.  We will fix this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed the entire recipe, and our children enjoyed the chicken without the sauce and the sauce over spaghetti. I will make it again.

It was a little too heavy for our tastes.  I also found the timing to be incorrect for cooking the breasts in the skillet - took over 25-30 minutes and had to constantly keep turning to prevent burning.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I marinated the chicken in fresh lemon juice and apple cider vinegar for 6 hrs to tenderize the chicken. I rinsed it prior to cooking. I also used a heavy cream, as the recipe did not indicate. I only made 3 breasts but used the same measurements. I plan to make it again for guests.

This was so easy and quick, great for a weeknight! I used table cream and at least double the amount, since the pan was so hot that most just evaporated right away. Also cooked chicken on medium heat instead of medium high. Served with quinoa and a side salad, it was delicious!

Loved it....although I did need to increase the ingredients for the sauce.  It just wasn't enough when I followed the recipe the first time, so I doubled it for the second and it was just about perfect.

made this for the first time and hubby kept saying how good the "gravy" was. not a healthy dish, but every once in awhile we must eat for the joy of eating, and this dish definitely fits the bill. I did double the cream sauce, because we like "gravy" as my hubby calls it.

Yum, Sauce was great.  I followed the recipe as written and loved it..  Capers are a must.  It adds that final zing to the flavor.  At Kroger, It's located in the "ethnic" aisle.  The "nonpareilles" capers are supposedly better because they taste better but smaller? ---

This was very good! The only thing I changed was half and half instead of whipping cream, because that's what I had. Agree with others that you should double the sauce. I did 2 breast halves, so halved the sauce. Shouldn't have, it was too good.

Super easy and delicious!  I use chicken tenders instead of breasts and I  de-glaze the pan with white wine and it adds a little something to the flavors...highly recommend this dish for company!  It will impress your guests.  

I also double the cream sauce...we like to have lots!

Awesome recipe! My definite go-to for company and easy weekly meals now! Simple yet elegant, in my sauce I also used about 1/4 c white wine and I doubled the sauce per other reviewers. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

This dish was wonderful! I did make the change of adding about half a cup of chicken stock (as there was not oil left to drain) and it was perfect.

Just made this for dinner in about 30mins. Used fresh lemon, garlic & cream cheese instead of whipping cream. Sauteed the chicken in butter, set aside. They made the sauce from those juices with cream cheese, lemon, garlic & other spices [skipped dill]. PLaced the chicken back in and simmered for 20 mins. Full of flavor. Delicious. will certainly make again.

Fabulous. Only thing I did differently was to slice the chicken breast in half (cutlet). It cooks faster & more evenly this way. I cooked for @ 3mins on each side.

We made this twice in one week. We even poured the sauce over asparagus. It was very good. We did not have dill and it tasted good without it.

This was FANTASTIC!  What a great sauce.  I only browned the chicken in the butter for 3 mins on each side and then cooked in baking dish on 350 for 30 mins to keep it juicy.  This sauce would be terrific on a baked/grilled fish as well.

This recipe is delicious and super easy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  When I make it again I would use a little less salt or leave out the capers.  My husband loved it and he made a doggy bag for lunch tomorrow.

This recipe was fantastic! I made a few changes, I didn't use lemon pepper and instead used 1/2 a lemon squeezed and some fresh ground black pepper.  I doubled the sauce as well and added a pinch of corn starch to it.  I have made this recipe for both chicken and salmon, both are great!!! When I make this with chicken I add mushrooms to the sauce...sooooo yummy!

I can't get the sauce just right, yet. It reduces too quickly on my stove. However, this dish coms out delicious every time I make it. Props to the dad who came up with it.

This was really excellent. Very tasty. I also increased sauce with 1/4 c cream, 1/4c low fat cream cheese and 1/4 c low sodium chicken broth. I did not add thickener and it was great. I also did not rinse capers as I generally use very little salt. This is a keeper.

This was simply fabulous. Easy and quick to prepare.  The kids had the chicken without the sauce which left more sauce for for my husband and I.  This was a great chicken dish and will be made multiple times in this household.

This was absolutely delicious!!!  It was simple to make and extremely good.  I didn't have any lemon pepper so I used juice from half a lemon and black pepper.  I marinated the chicken in the juice and herbs for a few hours so it would get some of the lemon flavor.  Next time I will just buy lemon pepper so that I can make it when I am in a hurry.  I also used cutlets so they would cook quickly.  I doubled the cream because my family really likes sauce.  It was delicious.  Besides doubling the cream if you want more sauce, there is no need to stray from the recipe.

Nice Easy recipe; as I enjoy cooking fresh and adding color I added some extras.  After cooking the chicken I removed it fr the pan. Added onion, fresh garlic, red pepper, capers, 1/2 cup of fat free cream, 1/4 cup of 1% milk, 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Stir together and add chicken back to the pan. Simmer to make sure chicken is completely cooked through.  Garnish with chopped scallions! Enjoy!!

Doubled the cream and used slightly less butter than called for and it turned out fine. Almost too much sauce in fact. Overall, pretty good and easy to make. Quite creamy though!

very good! I added the seasoning to a bag with 4 tablespoons of bread crumbs and coated the chicken. I also increased the cream (I used half & half) to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup chicken broth. Served on a bed of pasta. Delicious!!

Made this for the first time tonight. I wish I would have read previous reviews first because the sauce definitely needed to be doubled. Once I started it didn't look like nearly enough so I just addeda few more spashes of cream. While others omitted the lemon pepper I really liked the seasoning as is. I would like to add some white wine to the sauce next time. My picky toddler and I loved it while my husband did not, mostly because of the capers.I also added fresh squeezed lemon before eating.

Fantastic flavor combination! Definitely double the sauce. May also want to tenderize your chx breasts a little with a meat pulverizer, or use tenderloin cutlets.

Loved this recipe! I followed it exactly, but couldn't resist another reviewer's advice to deglaze with dry white wine (a last minute decision after adding some of the cream and seeing that it needed a little something more...what a wonderful flavor it gave, it was enjoyed by all; also served it over a little bit of angel hair pasta so as not to waste any of that sauce! Also I did end up doubling the amt of cream, as half a cup was just not enough.

Really tasty dish. I followed the recipe as posted. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the flavor could be improved with some breading. Also, I tenderized the chicken breasts, which I something the recipe should explicitly instruct cooks to do.

Loved the flavors! Used the cooking techniques from Chef John's video on AR for "Quick Chicken Piccata". I omitted the lemon pepper. Instead, after deglazing with white wine and smashing a few of the capers, I added the juice of 1/2 lemon into the pan. Added 1 cup of Heavy cream and reduced until I got my desired viscocity. Thanks for posting!

Your husband needs to experiment more! I did not change a thing and will never, it is perfect as is. Quick and easy to make, and looks so gourmet when plated. My husband is very picky and rarely likes to try new stuff; I made it tonight and he loved the chicken and sauce so much he asked me to add this as a regular dish to our monthly menu! He doesn't even like capers, or thought he didn't till now anyway. I can't wait to make this for our next dinner guests. Thank you so much for such a great recipe. Can't wait to try your husbands next creation!

Very tasty and quick!  I love lemon piccata and this is a faster way to incorporate all the same flavors.  I added a squeeze of fresh lemon on the cooked chicken and it made the flavor really pop!  Nice go to for a week-day dinner!

I made this recipe tonight for dinner for my husband.  It was a big hit! Very delicious and it had great flavor.  I set the heat on medium the entire time bc it just seemed hot enough, and the chicken came out perfect after a full 10 min.  Great crust and cooked just right, not too dry. At the last second, I decided to double the amount of cream in order to make sure I had plenty of sauce and I was really glad that I did afterwards.  I served it with whole wheat penne and a medley of roasted veggies (zucchini, squash, asparagus and red bell pepper).  Delicious! I will definitely add this into the mix for our regular rotation of dinner recipes.

This was AWESOME!  The only recommendation I would make would be to cut down the salt a wee bit. Maybe it was salty because I marinated the chicken in a brine solution.  I don't know.  Otherwise fantastic!  Will definitely be making this again.  Hats off to your husband for a successful experiment!

This is AWESOME! This is the closest thing I've been able to find to the chicken piccata at Cheesecake Factory which is my fave! I stuck to the recipe as a whole except for using chicken cutlets to save time on cooking and I did put flour on mine before seasoning them. Definitely double maybe even triple the whipping cream. I doubled it but could have used even more sauce to serve with thin spaghetti on the side. Oh - I also added mushrooms b/c that is what is in piccata and I had some to use. I sauteed them in a separate pan and just threw them on top of the chicken. YUM YUM YUM! Thanks!!!

Just made this today and loved it. However, I made more sauce than what it called for. But will definitely be making this again.

This chicken was amazing with very minimal changes made. I seasoned the chicken with the salt, garlic powder, fresh dill weed, and lemon pepper but didn't measure it, just sprinkled ample amounts of each on the chicken. I let the chicken sit in the seasoning for about 20 minutes and then cooked it in the butter, adding a few cloves of chopped up garlic to the butter first. Once it was cooked I deglazed the pan with a big splash of white cooking wine and then added 1.5 cups of whipping cream. I brought it to a boil and then down to a simmer. I added a few pinches of salt and a few sprinkles of lemon pepper and then put in 4 tbsp of capers and let it simmer for a few minutes. I served the chicken and the sauce over top of spaetzle and with a side of sauteed zucchini. Amazing and restaurant quality!! Will make again and again!!!! Absolutely does NOT need to be thickened with flour or cornstarch, great as is!!!

Wow so much better than i expected.  I doubled the heavy cream and i am glad i did because it was the star.  I  also used fresh garlic in the butter like i read in one of the reviewers.

This was absolutely amazing comfort food!  I didn't add salt because the lemon pepper  seasoning already has salt and I doubled up on sauce (but not the butter) and it was exquisite over fettuccine.  My kids are now big fans.

I love this recipe.  This is fast, easy and elegant.  I do not measure ingredients for this one.  Simply season the chicken liberally with the seasonings.  The more you have the better the sauce will be when you deglaze the pan with the whipping cream.  My sauce tends to be darker but so flavorful. I do use more cream then the recipes call for.

Chicken dredged in flour before sauteeing. Deglaze the pan with about 1/4 c. of white wine, then added the cream, a good squeeze of lemon (or lemon pepper), and now the dill.

Double the sauce

This was really good.  And I found out that my husband (of 26 years) loves capers!  I did double the cream for the sauce.  I didn't have any lemon pepper, so I put black pepper on the chicken and added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the pan with the butter.  I also deglazed the pan with a half cup of vermouth because it sounded good.  However, the cooking directions for the chicken were obviously developed by someone  whose cooking experience is mainly in grilling.  I put the chicken in the pan over medium heat, covered it and turned it once.  Searing skinless chicken results in a tough outside, and turning often isn't necessary. I served it over rice, and it was the perfect complement.

WAY too salty!! (Change to 1/2tsp or less).)And I do love my salt being from the South.....
I did double the cream sauce. Also added about two small shakes of Wondra to tighten it up. 

Worthy of repeat with these changes.

One of the best new recipes I have tried in a long time. Thank you for sharing. I marinated in lemon juice then sprinkled with GP and Dill, seared chicken cutlets in butter and olive oil 3 min each side. Removed from pan over low heat added 2 heads fresh garlic and cream. Put chicken and capers back in pan and covered for about 5 minutes. The flavor is excellent and the chicken is juicy!

My family and I love this recipe.  I did make some minor changes.  First, I cut the chicken up into bite size pieces but followed everything else.  I doubled the sauce and when it was done, we put it over spaghetti. It is so good with the sauce and pasta.

Loved the flavor of this recipe and definitely want to increase the amount of sauce next time. I also replace the capers with julienned sun dried tomatoes. Capers are way too expensive, and not good.

This recipe is fantastic and instantly became a family favorite. The chicken was extremely tender and flavorful. I did marinate the chicken for a few hours first and used fresh squeezed lemon juice in place of the lemon pepper. This did not involve a huge time commitment and with a little organization you could  be serving a wonderful dinner with definite 'wow' factor.

I followed the recipe as it's written, except I doubled the sauce.  It was delicious.  Next time I will flour the chicken first to see if there's a difference.   I can't decide which chicken dish is better -- this one or the garlic chicken.

This recipe is superb!  I, too doubled the sauce and doubled the meat but used tilapia.  My husband, son, and grandson all gave it two thumbs up.  

I have to believe this sauce would work with any meat.  Also, I didn't have whipping cream on hand so used evaporated milk for half and 1/2 and 1/2 for the rest.  It was just as creamy as it could be.  It didn't hurt that it cut the cost way down, either.

Reducing the sauce is key.  As has been pointed out, this isn't a gravy.  Thank you, Mommyto2boys.  A wonderful recipe.  Give hubby a pat on the back, too. I served it with parmesan0garlic noodles the way another cook did and with the caper sauce on them.........an epicurean delight!

It get's 5 GIANT stars after the changes I made based on other suggestions.  Melted butter in olive oil and cooked 2 chicken breasts with just lemon pepper.  I then deglazed pan with white wine, and added the 1/2 cup whipping cream, a generous tsp of dried dill, and a good squeeze of lemon.  Then just before it was done I added a tsp fresh garlic and the 2 tsp capers and sauteed that for about a minute.  I served the chicken over a bed of brown rice and drizzled the sauce all over.  This sauce was amazing!  I bet it would even be good over salmon.  I can't wait to make this again!  For company!  They would love this one!  My new bragging chicken recipe!  Thank you Mommy!

The sauce was out of this world. But do double it, or you will be scraping the skillet. There is NO reason to flour the chicken whatsoever. The whipping cream will do the job. I did add some fresh garlic, fresh lemon juice, in place of the lemon pepper, as well as 1/4 cup of wine. I did serve over rice, which I would never do again. Instead angel hair pasta, would have been far better. Thank You for Sharing a wonderful, quick and a dish packed with flavor.  The angel hair Pasta is far better, after making this again. The pasta absorbed all the goodness of the sauce. Did however add the dill to the sauce. Wonderful. Don't skimp on the capers.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Although the flavor was very good, it was lacking something.  Also, the sauce was not thick at all.  I think the next time, I will dredge the chicken in flour and use different spices.  All in all, it is a good recipe.  Thank you!

Will definitely make it again.  Pound the chicken breast to tenderize.  Use butter and olive oil to cook the chicken.  Double the cream sauce.  Served with rice pilaf and string beans.  Yum!

Great recipe!  I would have followed the directions except that I didn't have the lemon pepper or the cream... I skipped the lemon pepper and used milk +butter for the pan sauce.  Delicious.  Great recipe. Also, I used boneless pork chops, excellent accompaniment!

I loved this recipe!  I used heavy whipping cream and white wine, plus I sliced fresh garlic instead of the powder...it was awesome!  (And, I doubled the sauce, as we are a sauce-lovin family!)  Plus, I stole Bayou Gator's idea and also dredged it in flour.  I used half butter, and half olive oil, too!

Wonderful flavour, for adults, kids and tots!
Even my 8-yr old daughter that is not fond of sauces, asked for sauce on her chicken after she tried mine.  My tot devoured it too!
Fast and full of flavour. I had to make two small changes, as I didn't have all the ingredients on hand:  I used sour cream and milk in ratio of 1:1 to replace the whipped cream, and used not only butter but also coconut oil as I only had 1/2 the amount of butter called for in the recipe.

I added an orange pepper toward the end of cooking the chicken (I cut up the chicken as well into bitesize pieces) and added a fresh chopped tomatoe after I had let the pepper saute for a minute or two.  Added half and half and the capers and served over pasta.  It was great!

If you use lemon pepper salt DO NOT add extra salt as the recipe calls for. May even be able to get away with plain lemon pepper. Capers are not needed in recipe.

Nice for a change!  Added baby portabella mushrooms and onion.  As others suggested added garlic to sauce verses powder.  Husband said better than many other chicken skillet recipes. :)

This recipe was fantastic! My family ate every bite! I followed some other people's instructions and added garlic to the butter (and some olive oil). I put Tony Chechere's on the chicken. I also didn't have lemon pepper, so I added lemon in with the chicken (just about 2 tsps) and some pepper. Loved this! Will try it again.

I made this just like the recipe stated, but did take numerous suggestions and doubled the heavy cream...came out good, my wife liked it too... the dill really gives it a good flavor, might use a little more of that next time.

Absolutely delicious. One of the best I've found in months. Approved by the entire family, and considering how picky my son is, it's a wonder. He's only ever liked one recipe before. This must be amazing if he likes it!!

Made this for the first time tonight and it was awesome...the only thing I changed was the cream sauce...I added sauteed portabello mushrooms chopped, double the sauce, and added extra capers due to the fact that I cooked angel hair pasta to go with the chicken and love the sauce...the chicken would have been better had I put less salt, but overall this could have been a meal from an authentic Italian Restaurant!

This was a pretty good dish. I love chicken and capers. I followed recipe all the way through but when I got to the sauce I felt like it needed a little something so I added some parm cheese and was much better. Have made this several times now just adding the parm and extra capers make it perfect to me. Gives it that Alfredo taste.

Excellent dish.  I did not change a thing nor did anything need to be changed.  The sauce didn't really thicken up for us but we didn't care at all.

One of the best recipes I've tried yet!  I made zero changes to this and it came out wonderful. I'm sure you could do some substituting to cut down on the fat but I would advise against it and just make sure you keep your portion size reasonable. It's worth it, better than dessert in my book!

I'm giving this recipe four stars only because I did not  care for the dill with chicken.  I think it would be a great recipe with fish so I'll try that next time.  If I use chicken again, I might substitute a different herb for the dill.  Otherwise....good dish.

This is an excellent recipe! I didn't have any dried dill so I used dried majoran instead, and I didn't double the sauce as mentioned by many reviewers - it was the perfect amount and a little goes a long way! This is a quick and easy dish to prepare even for a week night. I served them with boiled potatoes. Will definitely make again!

I grabbed this recipe on the way out the door to the supermarket, and I am glad I did! I made it for lunch that day and my husband took one bite and said, "mmm, this is great!" Definitely a keeper recipe! 

I thought at the time that I would rather add 1 cup of whipping cream instead of just 1/2 cup, but it turns out that the 1/2 quantity has worked just fine. With the cream mixed into the runoff from the chicken and the rest of the chicken seasoning, the sauce is great! The seasoning on the chicken is also terrific.

I put all the seasoning on a plate and laying the chicken onto it. I ran out for the 3rd one (I actually only made three) and just sprinkled more seasoning onto that last piece of chicken. I think that if I did it all again, I would just sprinkle the seasoning on the chicken to begin with instead.

To salty!  This is so good but I'm cutting the salt in half next time. Otherwise I would have given five stars!  Super quick and it tastes like it took much longer.

I love this dish.  It's become my go-to recipe for when I don't want to go out and want something simple, because I'm about 95% likely to have all the ingredients already.  The only thing I do differently is cut the chicken into strips before seasoning and cooking them.  That way they cook faster and the seasoning better coats each piece.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  I enjoy making one-skillet main courses and this one is simple and packed with flavor.  I flattened then seasoned the chicken breasts and the dish was ready in about 20 minutes.  Makes a great presentation with a starch, vegetable and bread.  I'm sure I'll be asked to make this again soon.

This was quite tasty indeed.  Instead of using the heavy cream, I deglazed with a little lemon juice and made a quick roux, then used whole milk and half and half until the consistency was right.  The capers added JUST the right touch.  Bet this would be good with salmon as well.  Thanks!

After the first time I made it, this recipe became a staple in our meal rotation!  It's such a quick and easy recipe to whip up on busy weeknights.  As written, there's enough sauce to cover just the chicken.  It is so good to pour over rice, so the only thing I change up is to double the sauce, otherwise there just isn't enough!  The sauce soaks up all the flavor from the chicken drippings left in the pan, and is incredibly tasty.

This chicken is soooo good!  The first time I made it, it became a family favorite.  I omit the capers because I just don't buy them to have on hand.  But I stick to the recipe as is and it ALWAYS turns out delicious.  I usually serve mine with a side of rice and a vegetable.

This is a good recipe, but a modification makes it a great recipe.

First time I made it according to the instructions; and we liked it.  However, Allrecipes has a caper recipe which pairs w/Halibut and is hard to beat if you like capers (and we do)

So the second time I followed it, however I omitted the capers and subsiituted fresh sauted mushrooms. Yum ... that how we do this recipe.

What is there to say-easy to make, delicious.  My husband liked the chicken but not the sauce.  My 7 y.o. son did not care for it at all.  I think it is because they do not like their foods to have layers of flavor.  I prefer layers of flavor in my food and this does not disappoint!  I will make this over & over for my lunches.  I'm glad they don't care for it, more for me!  Final note:  take the advice of the other reviewers & make extra sauce.

This recipe is amazing! My husband's absolute favorite, have made many times since trying! The only substitute is I use 1 cup of fat-free half, to cut fat and add more sauce. Enjoy!!!

Used tilapia instead of chicken. Thought it was too salty, but I still think this recipe has potential if the salt content is reduced.

I have made this twice and love it.  I use a little extra whipping cream so there is more sauce to pour over the chicken.

I can not thank you and your husband enough for this recipe! My husband used to work as a cook in a gourmet French restaurant but as I do not work the cooking falls to me. I am not very good at it. He is very picky and does not like citrus or dill, but loved this recipe. Plus it was so quick and easy to make that we got to have more time together. I had the Chardonnay with it and it was delightful.

Very good.  Had with leftover mac n cheese, but would be great with plain buttered noodles to soak up some of the great sauce.  Used fresh dill along with a little dried dill.  Used lemon juice instead of lemon pepper, and marinated in fridge for about an hour with the juice, EVOO, dill, salt and pepper.  Other than that, followed recipe...yummy and easy!

This was soooo easy and good... I also deglazed my pan with some wine (1/4 cup?) and added a couple tablespoons of grated onion to the butter before making the sauce, which I doubled.  One of the 1st things my husband said was that this would be great with fish  :)  YUM - I'll definitely make this again!  Thank you!!

Tried this recipe tonight and loved it!  I made it as the recipe was written with the exception of pounding the chicken for thinner quicker cooking breasts.  This one is a keeper and will definately make again.

This recipe is awesome! I actually made it for 15 people, but it still came out perfect. I followed the most of the adjustments by naples34102; I seasoned the chicken with just salt, pepper and a little garlic powder, and dredged through flower, I added the white wine and used lemon juice instead of the lemon pepper. I didn't have any dill weed, but I didn't miss it. Between the lemon, butter, wine and capers, there is so much flavor. I used 2 cups of cream and 1 1/2 cups of butter and 1 1/2 cups of wine for 20 chicken breast halves. This in no way doubles the recipe, but it worked, with sauce to spare. I will DEFINTELY be making this again. It's my new favorite recipe, and SO easy. I served it with seasoned rice and roasted zucchini.

Great recipe and very easy. This is one of my husbands favorites. This recipe was the first time I had ever cooked with capers. FYI- The recipe isn't the same without the capers.

I made this last night, with a few variations. Actually, the variations would probably make it a different recipe but since i used this recipe as the base i wanted to rate it. I seasoned the breasts with the same spices in the recipe (lemon pepper, garlic powder, salt & pepper). However i stuffed my chicken with a ham slice and swiss cheese, sealing it with toothpicks. I seared each side in the butter. I removed the chicken and added the cream and fresh dill, salt & pepper to the pan. Let that cook for a few minutes, then added the chicken back in the pan, cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through. I did not add capers because my kids wouldn't have touched it if i did! I know, a lot of variations..... but very good!

I must've done something wrong with the measurements or my taste buds are off.  This was very salty to me, but I made mashed potatoes and steamed veggies, so it cut the saltiness down quite a bit.

This recipe could not be easier. Don't let that fool you though. This is so good.  I only had one giant chicken breast and I'm not much of a measurer so I just used what seemed right. I used half and half not whipping cream. This was fantastic. Family said it was a keeper.  Maybe next time I'll make more for them.

I would have rated this 5 stars but I felt as though the capers threw the flavor off.  I normally like capers but I think the sauce would have been better without them.  Will make again without the sauce.  After cooking the chicken I cut them into strips and tossed in the sauce again.  Very good stuff.

This was yummy. I did double the sauce (served the chicken with veggie/rice). I also flattened the breasts and dredged them in flour before cooking. They were moist and delicious!

Yum Yum!  This recipe was awesome.  I followed the advice of a few reviewers by doubling the sauce (whipping cream) and I wish I would have tripled because we served it with pasta. The other adjustments I did was: fresh dill and 2 cloves of garlic.  Loved it!  Thanks for sharing.

Double the sauce and don't change a thing. Soooo yummy. This is one of the few recipes that has made it into our family rotation without extensive revisions. Definitely good enough for company, though. Way to go, mommyto2boys! I've got 3 little boys and they loved this. The chicken was slightly crisped on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.

This was just ok.. It was edible. I gave it 3 stars because the chicken came out nice and moist and I will continue to use the technique but I didn't quite like the sweetness of the sauce and it also lacked flavor. I followed the recipe exactly but maybe I should of add a little spice to it. I don't understand why anyone would think it's too salty... Guess that's just me! If you do try this recipe I'll definitely recommend doubling the sauce, I used 2 chicken breast and it was a good amount for just those 2. My husband however didn't care for it and he usually eats anything. Probably won't try again....

This was a fabulous dish! I didn't follow the directions exactly, but I did follow the advice of others and didn't flour the chicken breasts. I didn't have any lemon pepper so I used half a lemon juice and pepper along with the other spices. Sauteed the chicken breasts in olive oil, instead of butter, with garlic and shallots. And when I made the sauce I used the juice from the other half of the lemon and added salt and pepper. Also added artichokes to the sauce.

Great Recipe! Like the other reviews I also doubled the sauce  and made some asparagus and polenta and drizzled the sauce on top of it. I also put some fresh garlic on the pan with the butter.  A must try and I will make this one again.

The store was out of dried dill so I made a few small, random additions/substitutions - also seasoned the chicken with parsley & a sprinkle of pakrika.  To the sauce, I added fresh squuezed lemon juice and a sprinkle of each of the following: lemon pepper, garlic, & oregano.  Chicken came out super juicy and the sauce was to die for.  As recommended by others, I doubled the sauce (we were even dipping our asparagus in it).

This is a great recipe.  I've "had" to make it twice now for my family.  I added a little flour to the pan before the cream and it made the sauce a little bit thicker and nicer.

I made this for the first time tonight and it turned out pretty well.  I followed some of the other suggestions and used fat free half and half and olive oil to make it more healthy and doubled the amount of sauce.  Also, I didn't have enough chicken so I ended up using some pork chops and my husband actually liked them more.  My only reason for not rating this a five is that I tend to prefer things that aren't quite as oily.  Thanks for the great recipe, though!  It was really good and very quick and easy!

I didn't have the lemon pepper so I used lemon juice and black pepper.  I didn't have dill.  I had one breast and guessed the measurements.  It turned out wonderful!

Great recipe! Very easy to make, and fast. I would only do 1 thing differently: cut down the salt to like 1/2 tsp or so since there is already garlic salt added. Great to make ahead and easy to do in large quantities too! :)

This is my favorite kind of recipe: simple, quick prep, & great taste. It could be whipped up for company while still having time to enjoy the company!  I did use fresh minced garlic (instead of powder) and whole milk (instead of whipping cream) and had fabulous results.  I also deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine.  I wouldn't have thought to pair chicken with dill, but it tastes very good.  Next time, I might use slightly less butter.  I will definitely make this again.

We did not enjoy this dish.  It had very little flavor as written.  After tasting the sauce, I quickly sauteed a little minced garlic and onion to add to the cream sauce, added additional black pepper, capers, salt...even a squeeze of fresh lemon...but it didn't really help.  It was chicken alfredo without any cheese - very bland.  Sorry, but won't be making this one again.

What a great blend of flavours.  Capers are pretty good.  We only had 2 chicken breasts but used the extra sauce on some baked potatoes... worked with them too.   Will definitely make again (maybe with a splash of white wine?)

My kids surprised me and actually liked this.  I, on the other hand, thought it had a strange saltiness.  I'm wondering if it was the capers maybe.  I've been trying recipes for a dinner party...and this won't be the one, but it was still good.  Thanks.

I really like this recipe, but it is really salty. First time I made it I used all of the seasoning mix, so I figured that was the problem. I made it lastnight and didnt use everything and it was still to salty. I really like it and can tell it will be excellent with less salt...Next time Im gonna reduce salt down to 1/2 tsp and see if that works.

ew! Followed recipe and suggestions and hate this dish. Once I picked out the capers it was edible.  I usually love capers.....mine tasted too "pickled" from the jar.  On the other hand my husband liked it and my 1 year old didnt throw it on the floor.

My husband asked if I added this to my recipe box to make sure we would have this again. He went back for seconds even though he said he was full ;) So easy and so yummy! I skipped the dill, doubled the sauce amount, and served over rice with a side of asparagus. Next time I will also skip adding salt as a seasoning. The chicken was well seasoned enough with the lemon herb and garlic powder and got lots of extra salt from the caper sauce. Thanks!

Delish and simple.  I soaked the chkn breasts in some lemon juice first then seasoned it without the dill (didnt have any).  My daughter loved it.  We ate it with Potato/broccoli mash.  I am going to try it with talapia.

This recipe turned out good. The sauce was a bit runny but I think I just used a bit too much half and half.

This recipe was delicious.  My kids ate it without the sauce and loved it.  We ate it with the sauce and it was delicious.  For leftovers I cut up the chicken, mixed it with the sauce and mixed it with long grain rice with a good squeeze of lemon juice.

WOW!  The flavor of this dish is really amazing.  I used tarragon instead of dill because I really don't like dill.  I find taragon subs pretty well in most cases.  I did deglazed with about 1/4 cup chicken broth and added most of the seasonings to the sauce instead of the chicken.  Hubby even asked about the recipe and the kids ate a bit more than usual (which is really saying something!) This will be in the usual rotation for it's simplicity and wonderful taste.  Fast and delicious, thank you for sharing!

Since others had recommended doubling the seasoning, I used what was called for on just three thinly sliced chicken breasts.  The result was a little overpowering for me but the bf liked it so much (minus the capers) that he took it to work...and he almost NEVER eats leftovers.  In order to have extra sauce for left overs I'd recommend making as is but adding more spice directly to some additional cream, then simmering with the chicken so the sauce has extra flavor rather than the chicken.

Whenever I ask the fam what they feel like eating for dinner, the response is the chicken with capers!!! This dish is amazing. I can't believe how tasty it is for having such few ingredients. I did double the sauce, simply because the sauce is so freakin' good, you will want extra to spoon over the pasta and chicken. I also use fresh garlic as opposed to powdered. I make penne pasta and add some butter and fresh grated parmesan and serve it with steamed brocolli. Thank you for submitting this delicious recipe!

This has become my new recipe for Chicken Piccata!  My husband does not care for dill but LOVED it in this recipe.  Don't be afraid to try dill-- it just adds an extra something, whether you like it or not.  Like some other reviewers, I created a white sauce by making a roux with flour, then added milk, just to cut back on the calories.  But cream would be an amazing treat!  Defintely a keeper!

I've been using this site for years now and this recipe inspired me to register so that I could say how much I loved it.  I didn't measure anything because I never do, but did use the ingredients, with a tiny exception.  Didn't have lemon pepper so I used black pepper on the chicken and then poured some lemon juice into the cream sauce.  Also went easy on the dill because it can be overpowering.  Served it with white rice, roasted asparagus, and chardonnay.  Expensive restaurant quality at home...with minimal effort.  Thanks!

This is a Great recipe and my family loves it.  The only change I have made to it over the years is;I cut the salt in half and after frying the breasts I put them in the oven at 350F while I make the sauce, adding a teaspoon of Dijon mustard to the it gives it just a bit more taste.

Used 1% milk instead of cream to save saturated fat calories, so expected the sauce to be thin...but honestly didn't care for the capers and milk flavor combo....and the breasts were over-spiced.

Not terrible, served over wild rice and roasted asparagus.  I'm confused about people saying to double the sauce though.  I increased it slightly and had way more than we needed, almost turned it into a soup.  I would stick with the original recipe if you want a sauce to accent the great chicken instead of a bowl of milk with chicken in it.

Wow this was good. Followed the recipe other than I chunked up my chicken before cooking, doubled the sauce, and served over penne pasta. We found it a tad salty (which is weird for us) so next time I will cut the salt in half. Man was it a good rich meal though. Def a keeper!!

Sooooooo good!  I did alter the recipe somewhat.  I used fresh dill instead of dried dill.  I also omitted the lemon pepper and simply marinated the chicken in lemon juice, dill, salt, pepper and garlic.  I doubled the cream sauce and added additional dill to it as well.  This recipe will definitely be a staple in our house.

I used chicken tenders instead of fillets.  I melted the butter and added 3 garlic gloves to the pan and used the juice from one lemon vs. lemon pepper.  I also added some white wine and covered to let simmer.  I served mine over rice with a side of asparagus. I doubled the sauce but there wasn't enough-next time I'll use the entire 500ml of whipping cream.  Huge hit!

This was amazing! My husband said it was restaurant quality. I made a couple changes: I did not use lemon pepper. Instead, I put the chicken in a ziploc bag with the juice of one lemon, 3 ripped up basil leaves, and 1 crushed garlic clove. I let this sit for half an hour, then fried it in garlic butter and wine in a pan. When the chicken was done, I took it out, added the cream, and made sure to scrape up all the yummy fried bits from the bottom of the pan. When it had reduced a bit, I added the capers and poured it on the chicken on a bed of whole wheat egg noodles. Delicious!

This is fabulous!  I pounded out the chicken breasts before browning them.  I also used the juice of one lemon + black pepper b/c I was out of lemon pepper. Also, I browned the chicken first and then baked it all in some of the cream sauce to make sure it was cooked all the way.  This we will make again and again! Thanks for a winner!

I love this recipe!! I made this for my boyfriend and best friend first and they loved it. On Mother's Day I made it for all of my family. They had never tasted my cooking before and they are still talking about how delicious it was! I have made with wild rice and garlic mashed potatoes..both equally delicious. Oh, and the only adjustment was that I added Creole seasoning =-)

Great Recipe -- I give very few five stars and reviews.  I made this for Mother's day, it was so easy, no marinating, I made a mistake and bought light cream, it was delicious, Mom even licked the plate and did not have any garlic powder but I had fresh.  I am going to try  the left over sauce over mushrooms because I had so much left over.

Excellent flavor just be sure and really go easy on dipping the chicken in the flour mixture, I put too much on and the coating became mushy in the sauce. Overall the recipe is a keeper!

Very tasty and easy to prepare. I've made this twice and it was good as written but the next time I decided to doctor it a bit. I made a roux after removing the chicken from the pan then I added 1/4 cup of white wine to deglaze the pan before adding the cream. This thickened the sauce nicely. I also added about a tsp of dried dill for more flavor.

Used fresh garlic and lemon instead of the powders. Very good. The first time I made it was for a dinner party -- I took a chance, and it was terrific!

OMG this was great.  I use the site very often but have never come across a recipe that I needed to comment on.  I made this last night for my son & his girl friend and we all loved it.  I seasoned the chicken two hours prior to cooking & used fresh dill.  As other reviewers had suggested I doubled the sauce.  There was not an ounce of chicken left.  I will be making this one again & again.

Very tasty...double the sauce by adding 1 cup of the cream. The capers add enough saltiness to maybe go 1/2 tsp salt.

Sooo yummy.  All my boyfriend could do was shake his head and say, "this is excellent" as he splattered sauce on his face.  For the chicken I cut the breasts thin and marinated them in fresh lemon juice.  I omitted the salt and lemon pepper and used fresh garlic and fresh cracked pepper, and I also added a dash of EVOO so the butter wouldn't burn.  For the sauce I deglazed the pan with a splash of a pino grigio, doubled the recipe, as I used pasta as my side, and added dill to the sauce. It was perfect and really easy.  I will be cooking this again for sure.

I loved this recipe!  I just got done eating it and had to review it.  I made a couple changes - I used thinly sliced chicken breasts, fat free half and half, and put the dill right into the sauce.  Very quick and easy!

I made this tonight and it was great! I don't like cream sauces but this was so light it really wasn't heavy and the flavor was yummy! I did double the sauce as others suggested and squeezed a fresh lemon on the chicken as it was cooking and a little in the sauce. This will be a family staple..

My picky 3 year old could'nt get enough of this chicken, so that alone makes it a 5 out of 5 for me!!! I loved the flavour, and how easy it was to prepare. I will be adding this one to my regular line-up. As per others reviews, I doubled up on the sauce. Yum!

I am glad I finally tried this (I'd been eyeing it a while).  I'd never tried capers before.  This was an overall very good piece of chicken, but I think maybe next time I'll skip the capers part.  Not that the recipe is bad, by any means!  I just don't think capers suit our tastes.  I really enjoyed all the other flavors, though.  Thank you!

so good - even with half and half. probably better with cream though. use less oil to brown chicken. sauce would be great over veggies. not much sauce from 1/2 c liquid. added garlic to the oil before the cream. mushrooms would be good too.

Exquisite! I followed DeeDee's advice and marinated the chicken for 15 minutes in the juice of two lemons before cooking it and adding crushed garlic to the butter. You just can't go wrong marinating chicken in lemon juice then cooking it in butter! It will always taste incredible! I did cook my chicken in a deep dutch oven - less splatters to clean off the stove later and since everyone loves capers in my house, I threw in extras of those. I didn't double the sauce and we had the perfect amount for four servings. There was enough to let you know the chicken was in a sauce but the chicken and pasta weren't drowning in a rich sea of cream...

Pretty good recipe. I followed the recipe as it was written but should have followed others' suggestion to double the sauce.

My husband thought this was OK, I did not care for it. I used half and half instead of cream. I found this dish to be quite flavorless.

totally loved this recipe! this is the first time i tried capers n it was a hit! its great with anything... i had it with a side of rice while mom had it with a bowl of salad... sure it wud b great with bread too :)... had a hard time trying to save some for bro who was late to the table. the sauce needed a bit more taste so added the capers with some of the vinegar it was soaked in instead of rinsing them out

I made this last night and I varied a little by using 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream.  Also, I did not have lemon pepper so I stuck the chicken in a bag with lemon juice and cracked black pepper for about ten minutes.  I think because of that it created too much juice to properly brown my chicken in the time given so some of it was a little dry (I used breast halves because that is what I had) I think I would have had better luck going with the original recipe but it ended up turning out pretty good and if I had done it properly it would have been even better.

This was good, but the sauce was a bit too creamy for us.  I also changed how I cooked the chicken: I dipped it in flour, egg & planko bread crumbs, cooked the chicken in olive oil for 3 minutes & baked for 7 minutes.  I also added lemon juice to the caper sauce.  In the future, I'd use half and half to cut back on the calories and fat.  I'll make this again.  Thanks.

I made this a while ago - before I knew what capers were - and substituted canned peas for them. You may be surprised, but it still turned out wonderfully. It was a good way to get veggies into the meal and worked  perfect for my mother who doesn't like the taste of capers anyway. I have tried it again with the capers, and while I will make the recipe again and again and again, I will probably change out the capers often.

this recipe was soooo easy and the flavor was fantastic!!!, i doubled the cream and did not have dill so i used a little parsley instead, it was fantastic! i also grated some garlic and browned the butter a bit first, we live in the south so we like lots of seasoning! thank you for a great recipe!

My husband and I thought this was tasty but may need a little tweaking.  I soaked the breast in lemon juice and instead of pounding them cut them in half lenghtwise.  I used 2 Tbls. olive oil and 1 butter and used fat free half/half trying to make it a little healthier.  This may have been the reason my sauce didn't want to thicken.  I added a little gravy flour and that took care of the problem.  Served with brown rice and broccoli.  Will try again to see if I can perfect.

I marinated the chicken in garlic salt, onion powder, paprika, pepper & olive oil for about 5hrs.  I took others advise and added some white wine to the drippings doubles heavy cream and capers.  The dish was delicious.  My husband loved it...my son thought it was ok.  I will definitely make it again.

Easy, easy, easy! The taste is wonderful! To save cooking time during the week I use skinless thin sliced chicken breast. My teenage son request this often and now enjoys capers.

It was a just a touch too salty for my first time preparing it.  Next time I will completely leave out the salt in the season mix for the chicken.  Other than that, this is an excellent dish!

I get SO sick of trying to figure out what to do with chicken. This recipe renewed my love! We add extra dill because we just can't get enough!    LOVE IT!

Very Very Good!  Would make this for company. I had bought chicken breasts with bone in so that is what i used, i did have to cook it longer so i also added white wine while it was simmering. Other than that i followed it to the "T". Thanks....will make this often.

I followed this recipe exactly and thought that it was too salty.  Eventhough, I would still make it again but 1/2 the salt content.

This was very good.  I left out the salt because capers are so salty.  I browned the chicken in olive oil.  My chicken breasts were pretty thick, so I ended up baking them for about 10 minutes at the end to keep them from burning in the skillet.  I did double the sauce and I'm so glad I did.  It's really delicious! I added white wine to the skillet first as suggested.  A lovely, easy dish!

This was good, but not like I expected.  The seasonings burned on my pan, so when I added the whipping cream for the sauce there were char pieces in it.  I don't know, maybe I gotta try again.  But, my boyfriend enjoyed it!

I cooked this meal about a week ago and I let my husband rate it.  He's a real meat and potatoes type of guy so whenever he is impressed by a new recipe, so am I.  I would have given it a 4* but it is still a good recipe.  In fact the reason I am rating it now is because he asked me to prepare it again tonight.

My husband asked me to make something very special. He invited his boss for dinner and told him he was taking him to "Ma's". (His boss is from out of state.) He said he was surprised to drive up to a home and get out. Dinner honestly tasted better than most 4 star restaurant food. I served this chicken with sauteed carrots, broccoli, and garlic/buttered bow tie pasta with fresh grated Parmesan cheese on it. For dessert, we had buttermilk pie. Delicious!

I fixed this dish tonight and it was great. My husband isn't crazy about capers, but he loved this dish. I served it with Angel Hair pasta and a nice salad. I doubled the cream and it worked out perfect. This is an easy but quite tasty dish.

Simply terrific! Some minor changes: I used olive oil instead of butter and deglazed the pan with a little white wine and reduced before adding the heavy cream. I also used thyme instead of dill. Next time I'll double the sauce too! Thanks for the post.

Soooo good! The only thing I changed about this recipe is that after browning the chicken on the stove top I put it in the oven for a few minutes, the top was getting too dark while the inside was uncooked. It turned out perfectly. I will definitely be making this again and again. I served it with penne pasta tossed in butter and Parmesan cheese and steamed asparagus.

This was a very good receipe, my husband loved it b/c the leftovers are already gone! I used thin chx breasts, deglazed the pan with white wine and doubled to cream sauce. Only thing I would change next time is omitting the 1tsp salt!

Makes an excellent dish! 
If you want to get creative, use this recipe, but add lemon juice and white wine. YOu can also substitute sour cream for the yogurt. 
YUM!

This recipe tasted fantastic -- even our 6 & 3-year olds loved it.  We didn't have lemon pepper on hand, so I substituted white pepper, and then added lemon juice to the cream/caper sauce.  By the way, we also doubled the sauce -- definitely a must.  Our only "complaint" was that it tasted just a touch too salty; next time we will try unsalted butter.

This is a quick, easy and excellent chicken recipe.  I made it for our company, and everyone loved it.  I used way extra whipping cream, and it took quite a while for it to reduce down, but the end result was delicious!  I will be making this again very soon.

I combined the sauce ingredients, omitting the butter and sub. a bunch of fresh dill, poured over my boneless thigh pieces, and baked in a flexipan. I also followed other reviewers and doubled the sauce. It yielded a moist, flavorful chicken and a rich creamy sauce--perfect for pouring over rice. My guests loved it, next time I'll halve the salt and add some lemon juice.

Family did not like the cream base. I make a similar lemon chicken w capers without the cream sauce so think they were comparing it to that.

Really liked the flavors, but the cream hurt our review (we are trying to get into Caribbean wear for vacation).  I splashed lemon juice over the chicken breasts, then used lemon pepper seasoning plus fresh ground pepper as well.  I left out the salt since my lemon pepper had salt in it.  I used a splash (okay a very big splash) of white wine to deglaze the pan.  Next time I think I will use half and half instead of cream.  Overall, I will definitely make this again and my husband says he will be pleased to eat it again.

I thought it was ok, I guess I'm not a big fan of the lemon pepper seasoning, so if I had substituted that with something else would probably be better.

This was really good, it was pretty salty so I think next time I will cut down on the salt that I rub onto the chicken. I followed the recipe exactly as it says (I always try to the first time) and  overall it was very yummy and easy.

This was tasty! I unfortunately didn't double the sauce, but definitely will next time. The only thing I did differently was deglaze the pan with a little white wine before proceeding to add the cream. The family gave it 2 thumbs up! Thanks for posting!

We loved this!  We even ate it twice in one week.  My husband loves dill, I love capers, it was perfect.  It is really perfect served with angel hair pasta.  I may try doubling the sauce next time though, as per my husband's request.

This was just o.k. for me.  I love chicken with lemon & capers, so I thought this would be the perfect recipe for me.  I thought it was a little bland.

Made for lunch today and it went over very well. The chicken was very flavorful. I added some white wine to the sauce and doubled the sauce as I served it over white rice. Thanks

This is absolutely a favourite of mine and my husband's.  I have made this twice now...love it love.  Very flavourful.  I actually marinate the chicken for a few hours in lemon juice, garlic powder or fresh, dill and the lemon pepper.  It makes the chicken very tasty.

Suprisingly Great!  Whole family loved it!!!  Very picky eaters in this family, which ranges from 7yr to 15yr.  Didn't make enough the 1st time because I didn't think anyone would want seconds.  Next I will make more and will also use less capers-this many is overwhelming.

Phenomenal -- simple meal with a gourmet taste!  I served over white rice with a side of veggies and my boyfriend loved it.  I made myself a vegetarian version as well with sliced portabello mushrooms and tofu, and it was also delicious.   I did add a little white wine and vegetable broth to the sauce to make up for the lack of chicken drippings.  I will definitely make this again!

This was good, but nothing "wowed" me about it either. This may just have been a fluke, but the capers I had were REALLY strong with vinegar taste... that may have been what bothered me the most.

Nice, full-flavored tasting dish. I made a few modifications. Didn't have lemon-pepper seasoning, so I used the juice of 1 1/2 fresh lemons with 1 teaspoon of mixed white & black pepper. Let the chicken marinate for about an hour. Also followed other recommendations and didn't add the 1 tsp of salt that recipe called for. Turns out that 1 teaspoon of garlic salt did the trick instead (and I like salt!). I also filleted the chicken breasts in half so they were thinner and would cook faster. I doubled the cream sauce and threw in a few fresh sliced mushrooms. Served over couscous with steamed broccoli and baby carrots. Yummy.

Trying to cut fat whenever I can, I used fat-free half n' half.  I'm not sure if there is corn syrup or some type of sugar in this half n' half, but the sauce tasted a little sweet and I didn't like that.  If I try making this again, I will use the whole cream.

We had this last night for dinner and loved it - after I pan fried the chicken I poured 1 pint 1/2 and 1/2 over the chicken and let it simmer.  I removed the chicken breasts and sliced them - then added 4 oz cream cheese to the sauce.  I served the sliced chicken over angel hair pasta with the sauce and topped with the capers.  We will make often!

After reading the reviews I was favorable about this recipe, so I tried it. Boy, I have to reconsider those stars that everyone is handing out. This recipe was a real disappointment. It was not what I was expecting, nor did the flavors seems to blend together, as the author said, her husband out it together out of what was left int he refrigerator and it really tasted just like that.

Delicious!I served the chicken over egg noodles and saved a little of the spice mixture to mix in the pasta after draining it. I love capers and added a little extra.I didn't have any garlic powder so I used garlic salt and didn't add the regular table salt.

Delicious and very simple to prepare. This did end up a little salty because I only had lemon and pepper salt. Next time, I will use just lemon pepper seasoning. I also added some fresh lemon zest to the sauce because I wanted a little bit more lemon flavor. The kids liked this one as well, even without the sauce the chicken was very good. Pounded the breasts thin so they would cook quicker and be more tender.

OK - this rating is more from my sister and her husband who I made this for.  After my brother-in-law took a bite of this he just stared at my sister, then me and said this is excellent, my sister agreed.  I thought that it was very good my self but I didn't quite rave as they did.  I used freshed (or salted) Capers which I thought did add a lot to the flavor but they were bigger than the brined capers so I would probably add more of the fresh ones next time instead of sticking with the recommended amount the recipe called for.  This meal was just too terribly easy to be the fine dining meal that it was.

This was really good and very easy to make. I added lemon slices when I was browning the chicken, and it gave it to much lemon flavor. It was still really good, my boyfriend and I cleaned our plates. Next time I will stick the the original recipe.

I liked this recipe but the rest of the family did not so much.  Needless to say one of them is not a lemon fan.  I think the lemon pepper is strong.  I may shave a little fresh zest instead next time or squeeze a couple drops of lemon instead.

I made this recipe for company based on the rave reviews and thought it was quite good.  I doubled the sauce which is very tasty. Instead of dried dill I used fresh dill and doubled the amount.  I served it with rice pilaf and a salad.

This was excellent.  I didn't bother measuring out the spices and DH thought it was "a little dilly", but I thought it was great.  This sauce (along with the spices) would be excellent on fish.  Great recipe Mommyto2boys.

Yum!  I've made this twice for a pickey family and then friends.  I think I like this recipebecause of the lemon and capers, one of my favorite combos.  But the dill with the chicken is a great combo that I'm going to use in other recipes.  Both times I used real lemon juice instead of lemon pepper.  I used half and half and all the butter both times too. Since everyone liked it so much I'm going to try reducing the fat a little next time to see if we still like it. Thanks husband of  MOMMYTO2BOYS.  this one's a keeper for me.

Great Recipe!  Very easy and very tastey.  As others suggested I served this over egg noodles.  The only alterations I made were adding a tsp of flour to the dry spices and I made a light roux with the drippings and a little additional butter before wisking in the cream.

I decided to do a trial run on this recipe, so I made one serving for dinner tonight.  This was awesome....I wanted leftovers, but didn't have any!  Can't wait for my boyfriend to try it!  I did use 1/2&1/2 instead of the cream, though it turned out great, thanks!

Very, very good! Super easy and quick to make, the sauce turned out rich with wonderful flavor and thr chicken was tender and delicious. One of my boyfriend's friends was here for dinner, and he liked it so much he had to ask me how to make it! :) I will definately be making this again.

This was wonderful! My husband was very impressed, and my 3yr old at this chicken right up! I will be making this more often. Very flavorful! I didn't change a thing and it turned out very nice!

Delicious.  My family loved this.  I will double the amount of sauce next time though.
