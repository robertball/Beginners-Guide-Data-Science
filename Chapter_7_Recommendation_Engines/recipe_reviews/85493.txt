These will cure your sweettooth without cheating if your on a low carb diet.  I would use 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 2 1/2 tsp splenda.   They are delish!  Oh and I used ziplock baggies to coat the pork rinds for both the butter and the spices.  Very easy!

I make these just a little differently.  I use very soft butter and brush on rinds, place on parchment lined cookie sheet and sprinkle on cinnamon sugar/substitute and bake in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes or so to let the butter crystalize the sugar/substitute.  The are very very good!  Try this on left over pie crust.

For you non-lovers...give this a try.  Im sure you will change your mind.

well this would have been awesome if I could have enjoyed. I put the melted butter on the pork rinds and was shaking the bowl...but the butter was making the pork rinds pop and sizzle..Then quickly added the cinnamon and sugar and it was too cinnamon flavored and not sweet at all. Plus, my rinds were soggy. So tried to let them dry and just didn't work. I was excited about this...concept was good but maybe use liquid spray butter and use a 2 tablespoon splenda to 2 tsp cinnamon ratio. Sorry, won't make this again.

I used regular granulated sugar instead of splenda and hubby loved these. I have never eaten a pork rind in my life and don't intend to start now, but he said 5 stars so there you have it! Thanks from the bottom of my pork rind crunching hubby's heart!

YES! So much yes. I used liquid sucralose to completely eliminate the carbs, mixed that with melted butter and ground cinnamon, poured it in to a gallon ziplock bag to shake & coat. I've been fighting my sweet tooth the past few days, and this totally does the trick. Plus it's a great use of pork rinds,  which I really like but had gotten bored with lately. YUMMMMM.

Do not, I repeat do not bake these as an added step as suggested by other reviewers. They are perfect if made following the directions. If baked for they become jawbreakers. I'll most certainly make them again.

These were way too salty for me. I wish I could find low sodium pork rinds then they would have been much better.
