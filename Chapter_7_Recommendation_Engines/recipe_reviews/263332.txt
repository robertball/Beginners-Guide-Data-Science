One of my favorite things to make in my IP is chicken broth! What used to take hours and come out good, with the IP, It's MUCH LESS TIME and comes out great! This recipe turned out so good, I literally could have poured myself a mug  and just drink it! DELICIOUS!
Made as written, just seasoned the chicken and veggies with Sazon Complete before putting them into the oven.
*** Something you must ALWAYS do when making broth/ stock is to ROAST THE BONES AND THE VEGGIES FIRST ***  It takes it to a whole other level.  I thought it made a huge difference when I started making it that way on the stovetop.  In the IP, It's even better.
What else can I say?   Oh, from now on, THIS will be my recipe when making broth/ stock.  It really is the best!
THANK  you for this recipe!

Beautiful color and wonderful flavor for chicken broth. Made almost as written and loved that it's made in far less time using the Instant Pot! I omitted the salt as I like to freeze the stock in 2-4 cup containers/jars for a variety of uses in cooking. The only change I would make is to omit the tomato as I think it caused a sweeter flavor to the broth, which was still good, but not what I'm used to with chicken broths. Next time I may add a bay leaf and some fresh sprigs of herbs if I have it on hand. Used this broth when making Lemon Asparagus Risotto, which worked out perfectly! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely fantastic.  I used no salt so it is healthier.  I pressure canned about 6 pints and am using it up fast!  I will definitely make more.

this was unfortunately not a success for me.  i'm used to making bone broth in my slow cooker on low for a full 24 hours.  my broth comes out super rich.  after 30 minutes the broth was very light and undeveloped. i tried another hour and then another hour and still nothing.  i eventually set the instant pot to slow cooker and let it go overnight.  the end product was closer to what i normally make but i was expecting more.  maybe this is not the poster's fault and more the instant pot's and my impractical expectations.

I added a bit more salt and added white wine since I had about 1/4 cup sitting in a bottle.  Fabulous!

This came out great--nice flavor and easy to do. I only had a small bit of tomato to add, so I don't know that it added much. I'll have to remember to have a tomato for next time. My only issue is that I checked the vegetables at 45 minutes, and they looked perfect, but I got distracted and didn't pull them out until my timer went off at 1 hour. By then, they were starting to burn just slightly and stick to the foil. The only thing I added to the pot was a bay leaf and some sage. The broth was perfect in the chicken corn chowder I made.
