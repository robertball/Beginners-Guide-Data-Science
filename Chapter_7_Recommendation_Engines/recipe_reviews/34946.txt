Unbelievably good.....  loved this recipe!  Made it on the grill the 2nd time as it was summer and didn't want to heat up the house using the oven.  So much better with the smoky taste from the grill.  One a side note:  Use a good balsamic vinegar and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese as you can definitely tell the difference!

I made this for dinner tonight to go with some Ribeye steaks and the only real variation I made to it was to leave the cheese off for the first 7 minutes and then pull the asparagus out of the oven and put the cheese on and bake for another 4 minutes. This was to keep the cheese from burning. I didn't measure my cheese but I know 1 ounce really isn't that much so I think next time I would add more cheese.  I used freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano and most of it melted and then there were only little flecks left to form the "crust". Sprinkling the balsamic on last was a great touch. I love the strong flavor of balsamic with vegetables though so you have to know you like that flavor.

Love how tasty this was. I used thin asparagus and baking time was onlt 10 minutes! Don't over-bake them or they will be very stringy. remove them from the oven when the just start turning bright green. They'll be perfec!

Very simple, quick, and an amazing combination of flavors! A little minced garlic is also pretty tasty. I marinated them for about an hour in olive and balsamic vinegar before putting them in the oven and it tasted wonderful...no need to wait to put the vinegar on after they come out of the oven! I love this recipe...it's almost the only way I make asparagus!

This is great!  Try reducing the balsamic vinegar--just put it in a small saucepan and keep it at a fairly high simmer until it's syrupy.  It mellows out the taste, and adds a little sweetness to the vinegar.

These were really good. Instead of oil, we soaked our asparagus in italian dressing for a little while then topped and baked. Also, didnt use balsalmic vinegar.

This rating comes 100% from the husband.  I do not like this veggie...so this is all him.  He really enjoyed and ate this like it was going to just jump off his plate.  Thanks for a new side dish for the hubby.

The cooking time was ok, although I played it on the safe side and lowered the oven temperature to 425 degrees.  I swear roasting asparagus is not only the easiest, but also the best way to cook asparagus. It was the additions to the asparagus in this recipe that didn't appeal to me.  First, I believe grated Parmesan, rather than shaved, is a much better option - I didn't want to end up with gloppy wads of cheese on my asparagus - and just a little sprinkling was fine.  Second, this cried out for some garlic to me - garlic powder would be fine, tho' I sprinkled it very lightly with fresh, minced. Finally, I already knew I wouldn't like the balsamic vinegar on the asparagus because I don't care for it in the first place.  But I thought Hubs would like it as he's more a fan of it than I am. To the recipe's credit it does give you the option to add the balsamic vinegar to taste rather than the suggested, heavy-handed 1/4 cup, but even "to taste" Hubs didn't care for it and agreed a squeeze of fresh lemon juice (like I put on mine) would have been a much better choice.

This was a treat!  It's not often that I make asparagus, and I just love it.  I agree that you really do need a good balsamic vinegar.  My husband won't eat cheese (or asparagus for that matter) so I made him an artichoke, but I really loved this, the pepper added a small kick, mmmm.  Thanks Kimber!

Good, but the cheese was cooking faster that the asparagus.  Otherwise, good recipe, great flavor!

Amazing and awesome flavor!  The balsamic vinegar made this taste excellent.  I used Kraft Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing & Marinade.  Based on the reviews I prepared this a tad differently than written (I didn't change the ingredients). I lined the baking sheet with foil for easy clean up, placed the olive oil in a bowl and tossed the asparagus in it to coat evenly.  I cooked the asparagus until it looked slight bright green (about 11 minutes), pulled it out of the oven and added the Parmesan cheese and balsamic vinaigrette.  I cooked until the cheese was melted (about 2 more minutes).  A different and delicious way to cook asparagus.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I took the advice of Mrs. Chef Esh & dumped the asparagus, EVOO, & balsamic vinegar into a ziploc with some minced garlic.  I let it sit in the fridge for about 1.5 hours.  Popped it in the oven at 450 for 10 minutes & they were delicious!  I probably added more than 1 oz. of Parmesan - didn't really measure as we love cheese; burnt Parmesan is the best!  I made this as a side with our filet mignon last night & it was perfect!  This is my new way of making asparagus from now on!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

Wow! What a delicious and easy way to prepare my favorite veggie, asparagus. We were getting tired of it just steamed. I used thick spears, made sure they were well coated with the oil, and used another reader's tip and cooked for 9 mins w/o the cheese, added about 1/4 c fresh shredded parmesan, then popped back in the oven for another 9 mins. PERFECT! We all loved the lacy, crispy parmesan bits that coated the asparagus and the pan. Didn't remember the balsamic vinegar 'til after we'd devoured the asparagus, but will try it next time.  Hint: use the Reynolds No- Stick foil for easy clean up. This is definitely a keeper!

I don't think I will make asparagus any other way now.  I dumped the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and some fresh minced garlic into a zip lock bag and marinated them for about a half hour.  Sprinkled with parmesan cheese and baked for aprox. 10 minutes and they were perfect!

This is very good. I served 4 lbs. of asparagus at Thanksgiving and it all was eaten.  I roasted the asparagus at 400 for 10 minutes and followed the advice of others, putting the Parmigiano Regggiano on at the end. Next time I'll roast it a shorter time, as I like it crisper.  Instead of 1/4 cup of balsamic, I used a smaller amount to finish the dish.  It was delightful.

FANTASTIC and I didn't even use the good parmesan (I used the kind in the green can)! I took it out before 10 minutes, I don't like veggies over done!

Delicious!  I used thin asparagus, and it was done in about 10-11 mins.  I fresh sliced some quality parmesan and I think it made all the difference.  I'm not a big basalmic vinegar fan, so i just tried a little on the side.  I thought it was really good in small amounts.  As long as it wasn't enough to overpower the cheese.  I think 1/4 cups would have been way way too much (but that is just my preference)  I will definitely make this again and again.

My dh thought that I had "overcooked" the asparagas because roasting and (my)balsamic was dark, giving the asparagas a brownish look.  Anyway, presentation wasn't the brightest green, but the taste was delicious. Will make again this way.

This recipe is a great addition to any risotto.  I served it as a side dish with the Mozzarella and Sun-dried Tomato Risotto recipe from this site.  It was a hit!  Next time I'll use an olive-oil based cooking spray instead of the olive oil for a lighter taste.  Also, try using bigger asparagus spears, or cut down on the cooking time for baby spears.  My baby spears were overdone at 12 minutes in the oven.

Be very certain you are using the block of Parmesan cheese and shaving it and NOT using the green can of grated cheese or shredded cheeses.  It makes a world of difference in the taste.  With the "real" stuff, this is a tasty dish.

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for years, and finally tried it. Had I known it would be such a top shelf side dish, I would have tried it long ago. First, it is super easy. It was prepared and done in around twenty minutes with ingredients we had on hand. We paired it with grilled ribeyes and 2% cottage cheese for a wonderful, simple meal. We used canned asparagus and it was great, but would obviously be even better with fresh asparagus. Five stars, for sure.

I,like another reviewer, take out the asparagus about  5 minutes before they are done and then sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over and put back in oven to finish.  No worries about the cheese burning.  I make this without the vinegar, too.  Good both ways.

This was SO good and SO simple.  I actually forgot the balsamic vinegar so I can't say whether or not that would have made it even better.  I see me serving this a few times a week while asparagus is in season.

So yummy! The first time I spaced the balsamic vinegar, and it was amazing. The next time I added the vinegar, and it was great! Not sure which version I prefer. Thank you for the recipe!

Wow was this tasty! Some complained about the parmesan not sticking - here's what I did. I drizzled the asparagus with olive oil and tossed to coat. I then lined the asparagus up right next to each other and sprinkled it with shredded parmesan cheese. I baked it till I saw the cheese start to turn slightly brown (thus forming the "crust" part).  After I took it out of the oven I sprinkled it lightly with the balsamic vinegar.  My husband raved about it!

I have an asparagus patch so have plenty to try different recipes. So far this has been our favorite and sooo easy! I cook for 9 mins and then add parmesan cheese as others have suggested. Cook an additional 3-4 mins and it turns out perfect. I also add garlic because I grow my own and always have plenty on hand. Couldn't ask for a more easy or tasteful recipe for a great fresh veggie. Thanks!

This was AWESOME!  Only thing I did differently was to add a little garlic powder before putting it in the oven.  I also followed another's recommendation to cook the asparagus for 7 minutes then top with the shaved cheese and cook for another 3 minutes.  Unless your asparagus is thicker, 10 minutes just the right cooking time.  Also, adding the cheese at the end keeps it from melting completely away.   Truly a delicious recipe!

Wow !  This was amazing. I made 2 lbs of asparagus and there was not one left ! The balsamic adds such a nice flavor to the asparagus. I tossed my asparagus with the oil, salt and pepper and cooked in the oven first for a little bit per other reviewers suggestion.  After about 8 minutes I added 2 cloves of garlic grated and then I added the grated parmesan cheese.   Left in for just a minute or two longer took out and then drizzled the balsamic over all.  So good. My mouth is watering as I write this review. Thank you.

This was so delicious!  I was afraid the parm would burn, so I added it the last 7 minutes and it was perfect.  I'll make this again- it was wonderful.

Excellent!  I made this for my inlaws Easter celebration - I left it in a bag to marinate while I went to Church and put it on the grill when I got to their house.  It crisped up nicely and the cheese was a great add.  EVERYONE gobbled it up fast!

This was very good and easy.  I used canned asparagus, but next time I will use fresh asparagus.  The quality of balsamic vinegar definitely makes a difference!

Easy, quick and not to mention delicious!  I used a garlic infused olive oil and just a splash of balsamic vinegar vs. 1/4 cup.  I roasted this at 400 for about ten minutes and it was perfectly done. This is a perfect accompaniment to any meal!

Very good almost perfect I just think it may be missing something...not as crusty as I thought it would be.  perhaps mix the parm with some crumbs and oil?

Yum! What a great way to make asparagus. I served these as a side dish to pasta with a homemade tomato cream sauce and my boyfriend loved them. The only thing I didn't do is used any of the vinegar, since I didn't think they needed it. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Have made twice in the last week, once marinating the asparagus in the olive oil/balsamic for 1.5 hrs. Excellent either way. Definate keeper, thanks for the amazing recipe!

I didn't care for this recipe. I like all of the ingredients separately, but did not care for the balsamic vinegar with the asparagus - it really overwhelmed the asparagus. I think I will stick to steaming with a bit of butter and salt.

I tried this tonight and it was great! I usually steam my asparagus but this sounded so good I had to try it. It wasn't any harder than steaming. I did take the suggestions as far as baking it for 8 minutes first before putting the parmesan on and then bake for another 5 min. Don't make the mistake of salting it (like I did) because the cheese adds enough saltyness to it.

Ok, I made this without the addition of the balsamic. Then made a salad that included cherry tomatoes and fresh herbs and diced sundried tomatoes,  topped with warm grilled chicken breasts(sliced) and warm croutons, scattered the asparagus artfully, and then drizzled the whole lot with a homemade balsalmic dressing.

What a great alternative to the usualy steaming...this is also a great way to prepare broccoli (sometimes I sprinkle garlic powder on the broccoli prior to cooking). Thank you!

Really liked this.  My husband said it was good and he's not a big asparagus fan.  Didn't add the basalmic vinegar because I made a roast that was marinated in it and didn't want to have balsamic vinegar overload, I will use it next time.  The cheese melted nicely and paired well with the asparagus.

This was alright, but I prefer steaming the asparagus. The thing I don't like about roasting asparagus is that the tips seem to get overdone and crunchy. The combo of asparagus and parmesan is great, though!

This is my favorite way to cook asparagus.  It is so easy and the asparagus has a great texture!  I usually leave out the vinegar.  I have also used frozen asparagus spears and it turns out fine.

Turned out great- really brought out the "woody" asparagus flavor. Will definitely make again using the canned parm... I thought the fresh was too salty.

I really loved this dish.  I cooked it at 350 for about 12-15 minutes & it turned out really great.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I've made this as directed and it's great. I've also subbed manchego cheese for the Parmesan and tried substituting a balsamic vinegar reduction - made syrupy with a little sugar. Both the original and the slightly sweeter versions are a hit in my house.

Excellent!!! It also reminded me of an asparagus dish I had at Lamella's here in Little Italy, Manhattan.  Very very good.  I just don't know what the balsamic vinegar was for, it definitely didn't need it.  Enjoy!

This is the best and fastest side dish I have ever made!! I served it with wild rice and catfish baked with a buttermilk/cornmeal crust and fresh jalopenos. Both cooked in about the same time. Yum!

Hubby thought it was ok, i did not think id like it however i liked it more than i thought, im not a big parmes. Fan and i felt that itwoukd not create an overall good taste to me because there was no sauce, just a crust. I found another recipe where you bake and make a sauce and drizzle, i was not a big asparagus fan till i had it that way, this was not a winner for me.

I love asparagus and am always looking to make it differently. This is perfect. Also works well wrapped in tinfoil on the grill. As is was great, but since then I have started adding some garlic as well.

Delicious and super easy! This is a keeper! Only change is that I marinate the asparagus in olive oil, crushed garlic and balsamic in a bag for a bit before putting in the oven. Great way to make asparagus!

Just perfect. Doesn't need a thing. It's even good without the vinegar (but balsamic vinegar is divine, so don't, unless you're like me and forget things...)

Excellent and easy!  The asparagus was still tender and made so delicious with the parmesan and balsamic vinegar.  We made it for company and everyone loved it!

My husband had disliked asparagus as long as I have known him, and even he'll ask for asparagus prepared this way! This is my go-to recipe for quick asparagus.

Loved this-I used white balsamic vinegar instead of the regular balsamic vinegar.  I also didn't use black pepper.  Made it for Easter and everyone raved about it!

Absolutely delicious! You may not need to cook them for the full 12 minutes...I suppose it depends how soft you want them. These are so good straight from the over, I recommend you make this right before you serve dinner.

After looking at the pictures, I suspected that there wasn't going to be any "crust" on this asparagus and I was right.  However, the flavor was quite good and I really liked the addition of the balsamic vinegar. I baked mine at 400 for about 8 minutes, because we like our asparagus crisp-tender.  I found that most of the parmesan was left on the baking sheet and not on the asparagus.  Next time I think I would just sprinkle some parmesan on when plating, and then drizzle with the balsamic.  Still enjoyed this though.

I am an asparagus LOVER!!!!!!! I also happen to be a bacon LOVER...so the only thing variation was to marinate the asparagus in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar first, then add the paraesan cheese and wrap three to four pieces of asparagus with bacon and OMDG!!!!!!! SCRUM-DIDALLY-UMPCIOUS!!!!!!! GREAT recipe!!!

This was awesome!  I marinated it in balsamic & oil for a bit, then cooked it on the grill.  I didn't use the whole amount of balsamic - just eyeballed everything.  The flavor is spectacular!

I would suggest more cheese and no balsamic vinegar. As soon as I put the balsamic vinegar the cheese got soggy and slipped off the asparagus. I liked how the shaved parm just kind of melted and wrapped around the asparagus as it was cooking.

Very yummy and easy too!  I added some garlic powder with the pepper, and cooked the asparagus halfway before adding the parmesan cheese.  The balsamic was a wonderful addition!

Delicious and simple! I followed the advice of past reviews and baked the asparagus for 15 minutes before adding the cheese and baking for another 10-15 minutes. I baked mine at 375 degrees (because I also had salmon in the oven) and it still turned out well.

I really just used this recipe as a guide to figure out my oven temp and cooking time, but the asparagus was so good!  I cleaned and prepared my asparagus and placed them on a foiled lined cookie sheet, drizzled some extra virgin olive oil over them and tossed to coat them.  Then I sprinkled on some sea salt and parmesan cheese (I even cheated and used the kind in the green can).  The oven temp and cooking time was pretty right on, I just cooked until the color looked right.  I skipped the balsamic vinegar because the asparagus were so good without.

Such a simple, easy, but decadent way to eat asparagus.  I have to leave the vinegar on the side for the sake of my 6 year old and toddler who is starting on table food, but it's a must for the adults!  If you haven't tried balsamic, don't be afraid!  It's not like other vinegars.  However, it is a little rich (and it is still vinegar, after all), so use a gentle hand with it if you're not used to it.  Great, great recipe!

Love these! I use more cheese than the recipe calls for & eyeball everything. It's such an easy recipe to make. They are good w/o the basalmic if you really like asparagus, but if you've never had it with, you have to try it.... it's awesome! This recipe is a regular in my house now.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe. I tried it both with and without the basalmic vinegar. I'm not much a fan of vinegar, so I would personally not add it in the future. I also added about a tsp of crushed garlic to the recipe, rubbing it all over the asparagus. Will make again.

Fantastic combination of ingredients, nothing needs to be added or subtracted.  I agree that the parmesan shouldn't be added at the beginning of cooking time, more like closer to the end... it should just be past the edge of melty and not too brown. I usually start asparagus by a quick microwave steam for 30 seconds or so, and then roast.  I don't know why, some other recipe I guess and it has always worked for me.  You do not need an expensive balsamic for this recipe, of course if you have one it might be that much better... but I have made this recipe and several others using balsamic from Costco, from Safeway, from World Market... none of them expensive and all tasty when used as in this recipe.

I add a clove of garlic and marinate 1 hour. Do not over marinate or asparagus will be tart. Very good.

As written I think this is a 3 star recipe but w/ just one very small, but very important, modification, it's definitely five star...I'm splittling the difference & giving four stars. I had some white asparagus (don't often find it but when I do, I snatch it up) that I have been eager to try in this recipe so I had hubby make this up for me while I relaxed, from a day w/ all 3 grandkids, in the bath w/ a glass of wine. I was very disappointed when I saw the finished dish & thought he didn't follow the recipe (he did)...I never noticed that the recipe calls for the parmesan to be added at the beginning of the 12 minute cook time. It was all melted up & shriveled away & I was expecting beautiful flakes of parmesan. I flaked some more up & that remedied that but next time I am following CarolineC's lead & topping it w/ parmesan after it's pulled out of the oven. The drizzle of balsamic was a perfect touch!

12 minutes is way too long - mushy -  maybe better just blacken them on the grill then grate fresh cheese over the top

This was a simple dish to prepare and makes for a nice presentation.  Next time I prepare this, I may substitute the basalmic for lemon juice.

The first time I made this, I checked the asparagus after 10 mins, and they were burned. I ended up throwing them away. This time I just pan-fried them til tender, served them up, topped them with shaved Parmesan, then drizzled a little balsamic vinegar over. Excellent!

Great flavor.  Make sure you serve immediately from the oven otherwise it gets cool quickly and the vinegar doesn't soak in with the asparagus.

I thought this was a delicious and easy way to fix asparagus.  Much better than steaming in my opinion and eliminates the need to make a sauce.  We didn't have any balsamic vinegar so I squeezed half a lemon over it--it was delicious and fresh-tasting.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was a nice change from the typical steamed asparagus we eat.  When making, I used fresh shredded parmesan cheese as opposed to finely grated/powdered stuff.  I was unsure about the combination of balsamic vinegar on the delicately flavoured asparagus at first, but it turned out to be a great combination.

Excellent!!  Such a simple little recipe but it was absolutely delicious.  I served this as a side to Pan Seared Chicken with Basil and Parmesan Couscous.  At first we were cutting it with a fork but were soon picking the asparagus up with our fingers to devour more quickly.  Two thumbs up!! Thank you!

Thank you, Kimber, for such a great way to cook asparagus! My husband loved it, raved about it to his mother, and now all of us are making asparagus this way! My mother-in-law used lemon juice instead of balsamic vinegar and loved it.

Delicious.  The asparagus had a roasted look and taste.  I used very little olive oil but a lot of parmesan.  Be sure to use freshly grated parmesan for best flavor.

I didn't like the way this recipe turned out.  I think the cooking time is meant for thicker asparagus.  The parmesan is a good match with asparagus.

This was good.  Maybe it is not fair for me to rate because I took other reviews suggestions and altered it a little.  I put the asparagus in a bag and marinated it in the oil, vinegar and added garlic.  Left it in the frig for a couple hours and then backed.  A nice changed for steamed asparagus we usually have.

Great flavour. I made the mistake of cooking them too soon before dinner and I forgot to use Balsamic Vinegar, but they still got devoured by the end of the meal. Asparagus is my favorite vegetable, and this is a great alternative to the usual steamed asparagus with butter, probably healthier too. Will have to try making it the right way next time.

This just didn't have enough flavor, if I made it again I would increase how much of everything I put on the asparagus. I wanted the parmesan to really shine and I didn't even know it was there.

Absolutely wonderful! And super easy to make. I made this for Easter dinner and Saturday evening dinners. It is a hit with adults and my 10-year old daughter.

This was really easy to make and it was very yummy.  I only wish I'd had more room in my stomach to fit more of it!  The asparagus was nice and tender without getting all mushy and stringy and the Parmesan wasn't overwhelming but added a nice flavor.  We'll definitely be making this again!

I really liked the flavor of this recipe alot.  I'm a big balsamic vinegar fan.  However, if I were to make it again I would bake the asparagus for about 5 minutes, then top with cheese, and continue baking for 5-7 more minutes.  I felt that the cheese cooked faster than the asparagus.

I thought this was great, and the secret was the balsamic vinegar. I tried a piece before adding the vinegar and thought it was great, the old "one for the chef" before you serve dinner. At the table I added my balsamic vinegar, and now that I've tasted it that way I don't think I can go back :) Thanks for the recipe!

Was really simple to make. We all had seconds. Only tip is to watch them closely and get them all to be around the same thickness of some get a bit over done.

This was really simple and good. I roast the asparagus for a few minutes before I sprinkle on the cheese. I've always forgotten to add the balsamic and it's still wonderful. Will probably be even better with it.

I am only giving this 4 stars because it has so much potential for me. 12 minutes in the oven is almost too much, and the cheese was burned. So my advice- wait to put the cheese on, and don't overdo it on the balsamic vinegar - it overpowers the nice taste of the asparagus/parm. Overall, a great recipe, and there were no leftovers, so I'll be making this again with a few minor changes to time and measurement. THank you for sharing!

Amazing side dish! We loved it, a really great new way to prepare asparagus. I followed another reviewers suggestion and baked the asparagus for about 7 mins then topped with the parm and baked for another 5 mins or so. The balsamic is a perfect finish. I'm making this for a second time this week :)

I loved the flavor of this recipe but I way over cooked it. It still tasted good but the asparagus were a little shriveled. Next time I will make this when I do not have to time it with my husband barbequing. This dish is not something that you can make and leave in the oven on warm.

This is delicious. I used fairly thick asparagus and roasted for only 10 minutes and it was done perfectly. The balsamic drizzle is not to everyone's taste in our family, so I just put the bottle of good balsamic on the table and those of us who wanted to, drizzled. Thanks!

I have been using this recipe for about 4 years.  The first time I made it, it didn't even get to the plate!  It is so good, I just kept taking a piece off the baking pan and eating this.  This is terrific, the absolutely best asparagus recipe in the world.  My son adds sauteed minced garlic to it.

Easy, Quick, and Delicious!  My husband loved it so much he was eating it right off the pan before we sat down to eat.  I only needed about 8 minutes for the cheese to melt and the asparagus to be cooked perfectly so keep an eye on it in the oven.  I reduced the balsamic by half which made it a little sweeter.

This was awesome.  I had made it with "Balsamic Roasted Red Potatoes" so there was enough balsamic in that recipe that i didn't use any balsamic with this one.  It was so simple to make and so delicious.  I will definitely be making this again

This was just okay for me the first time, but since my husband loved it so much, I made it again.  The second time around was better for me and my husband requests this recipe a lot.

These were really good!  Mine did overcook for some reason, but I like mine pretty crisp.  These were a little soggy, but the flavor was great!  Next time I'll just cook them less and they will be perfect!

Another good asparagus recipe.  I'm mad cuz I forgot to sprinkle the balsamic....I'm such a dork sometimes...easily distracted...my dog was being cute as I was serving dinner.  I'd make this again without the balsamic but want to do it right next time.  Thanks Kimber!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes.  So easy and always so good.  I never measure but I'm sure I use a little more cheese - just sprinkle it on.  The asparagus has a nice texture -- and you can never go wrong with balsamic!  Thanks for an easy, never-fail recipe.

My sister-in-law brought this recipe to Christmas dinner.  It was awesome.  She shredded her own parmesan and I think that was a great touch.

I liked the change, which was nice.  I however, marinated my asparagus and I don't think I will do that again. Too greasy (not sure that was even why). I did enjoy the crustiness of the parma. though. I will make again.

So simple and so good.  This is how I often make asparagus, but I never thought about adding parmesan.  It makes a good thing even better.  My husband and I ate a whole pound by ourselves!

Very Yummy and great to serve as a side dish for a dinner party! I prefer thicker asparagus and I "snap" off the bottoms. Along with the pepper I added a few dashes of salt. I omitted the red wine vinegar and used lemons instead (also pretty so serve with a few lemon rounds on top). I will never boil my asparagus again!

A quick and easy way to use up asparagus! No need to drizzle with balsamic vinegar if you're not a fan. Mash some garlic into the olive oil before tossing with the asparagus! Yummmm.

Very good, next time I will try adding garlic too.  I may try using the balsamic as a dip instead of poring it over all of them - my kids didn't like it and I think it may be the vinegar.

This recipe may actually make my Easter dinner table!  WOW!!  I followed the recipe to a "T" -- I know, rare for me :-).  It was absolutely perfect.  I baked it for 15 minutes and next time will go more towards 10-12 minutes to keep that nice crunch to the asparagus.  Bake it too long and it tends to get mushy. The balsamic vinegar makes the dish!  Mmm Mmm.

Excellent! I had thin spears and roasted them for 10 minutes and they were perfect! We put the bottle of basalmic vinegar on the table and just seasoned with it as desired. I found this much easier than any other method of cooking asparagus -especially easy to control doneness!

This is the best Asparagus I have ever had. The balsamic vinegar adds such a unique taste- I was kind of leary of it but now I cant believe how wonderful it  was. I also tossed in some sesame seeds when it was done cooking and that added a little nutty flavor that was a great compliment to the parmesan cheese. Will be making this alot in the future.

Wonderful!  I was concerned when I put this in the oven, and it started smoking, but I turned the oven down to 350, and cooked the asparagus for about 12 min.  Sweet, tender and delicious.  I had sprinkled on some finely minced garlic, and it was just right.  I even forgot the vinegar, and we still loved it!

5/12/05  I had some issues with this dish.  First, the asparagus were ready to be removed from the oven in 7 minutes or so- they would have burned if I left them in longer.  Plus, the cheese didn't really stick to the asparagus very well.  However, my mom Loved it, and although I prefer other cooking methods, I also thought it tasted decenty.  Give it a try.

This is a wonderful recipe! I do not like Asparagus, but for some reason can't seem to get enough of this. I mixed oil and balsamic together in a ziploc bag then marinade the Asparagus before cooking.

This is definitely our favorite way to cook asparagus. It's so flavorful and so quick and easy. We love the way the parmesan cheese makes a crust on the tender asparagus. It's awesome

This recipe came out perfectly: great flavor, good texture, even a pretty presentation.  I'm so happy to add another vegetable dish to our rotation!  My husband likes it better without the balsamic vinegar, but I disagree.

These were the best!  Nice presentation, too.  I only had grated parmesan that comes in the tub in the deli department, but was still delicious.  The balsamic vinegar gives it a nice little tang.  Thanks!

Very good!!  Unfortunatley all I had was grated parmesan cheese (the canned stuff), but I still really enjoyed it and will make it this way again!  Probably for special occasions I will splurge on better parmesan, but I don't mind using the cheap stuff most of the time.  Even my boyfriend who claims to hate asparagus enjoyed this!!

So good and easy! Used 1/2 of the oil, and rolled spears in it, still turned out great!

Great side dish.  I must have overcooked mine because the asparagus was a little mushy, but the parmesan and balsamic vinegar added a lot of flavor.  Just watch it closely!

YUM!! loved this recipe!  also nice with a little garlic salt.  better if you make it at the very end of the cooking process bc cheese can get a little too crusty. really good just out of the oven piping hot.

This was wonderful! Everyone in the family (including 11 year old child) loved them. I only had grated cheese on hand and it worked great. The first batch I cooedk 10 minutes and I think it was too long. They were good but they had shrunk and were too soft. The second batch I cooked for 6 minutes. They were perfect. So simple and elegant.

Tasty.  I put some balsamic vinegar on the table & sprinkled it only on a couple of asparagus.  My family liked it better without the addition of the vinegar.

WOW! Okay, this is very good. I am lucky enough to have a bottle of 100 year old balsamic. What an amazing taste with the parm and asparagus. The dish only needs a few drops of the balsamic.  I would make this again, next time I would grate the parm, it melts the same and would stay on the spear better.

Everyone loved this. The kids didn't like the balsamic so next time I will separate some of the asparagus for the balsamic-phobes. Also, next time I might sprinkle some cubed pancetta on them before the cheese.

I will confess I left the asparagus in the oven too long BUT they were cooked like asparagus chips!  Everyone loved them and kept going back for more so if you over cook them do not worry you may find out they are still good!

These were very yummy!  The only issue I had was that they were hard to get apart to eat since the cheese melted over everything.  Not a big deal unless your serving them for a fancy dinner.  :)

I really liked this a bunch!! I had some lemon already wedged so I used the lemon at the end instead of the balsamic. Delicious!
I also added the parmesan cheese halfway through cooking as to not burn it. 
Thank you for posting!

I made this recipe and it was delicious! I personally liked the asparagus without the lemon sauce, but my boyfriend enjoyed it WITH the sauce. I added more veggie oil in my recipe. Next time I will try it with the recipe amount in order to avoid all that oily-ness!

This recipe is wonderful! I have changed it up a little here and there. I used the powdered cheese instead of freshly grated (because that's what we had) and no vinegar. It still comes out great! Or you can chop up a few fresh pearl onions and add those with the olive oil and ground pepper and it comes out also very yummy!

I made this last night for dinner and it was delicious.  I sprayed the asparagus with olive oil spray and did not use the balsamic vinegar to cut on calories and it was delicious!

I made this with dinner today, it was great. I tried reducing the balsamic like another reviewer mentioned, it was a great idea. I would absolutely make it again.

Unfortunately did not have shaved parmesan.  Had to use grated.  Tasted delicious--cannot wait to try it again with a little more balsamic then we used and the shaved cheese. Quick and easy recipe that I sped up by cooking the asparagus in the microwave first for about 3 minutes then popping it into the oven with the rest of the ingredients for about 5 minutes.  Perfect!

Mmmmmm.  I left out the vinegar but tossed the spears with the other ingredients then laid out single layer in oven.  I think a broiler might be great as well.  (same temp) I am not sure I left them in that long, maybe closer to 10 mins. They came out nice and crisp.  Delicious side for stroganoff.

I've actually cooked it like this for a while, and ALL of the 6 members of my family (even the picky ones) love this asparagus!  The only changes I've made is that I spray the asparagus with Garlic Juice instead of the oil, and I drizzle some lemon juice on it instead of the balsamic vinegar and sprinkle it with a little bit of garlic salt.  We like garlic!

This was really good. My hubby doesn't like asparagus so I had it all to myself. The only thing I added was more cheese. Thanks for the GREAT recipe.

This was a nice side dish to pair with Pork Chops with Fresh Tomato, Onion, Garlic and Feta (Lovecooking). It's not "knock your socks off" good by any means (sorry!), but it has potential to be improved upon, especially the cooking time (which is a little long IMHO). I cooked my asparagus for a total of 13 minutes, adding the cheese during the last 5. If the Parm were added any sooner, it would burn - BAD!!! I didn't measure the amount of cheese used (just liberally sprinkled over my asparagus), and in doing so, there was a lot of it on my aluminum foil (I lined my baking sheet with foil for easy clean-up). My bf commented that the cheese "crisps" that he peeled off the foil actually were the best part (go figure!)!!! And, now that I think about it, I forgot to add the finishing splash of balsamic. That would have made a HUGE difference for me (too bad...). For such little effort spent, this was worthy of giving a try. Thanks for sharing Kimber :)

Side dishes are too often overlooked. Main dishes can be a lot of work so it is nice to find a side dish that is both easy and tasty. Thanks for the recipe and the new way to fix an old favorite.

Yum Yum!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated (although I didn't  measure the cheese, so may have added a bit more than 1 oz.)  My husband's words were, "This is a keeper recipe!"  Someone was asking what to serve this with and we had marinated grilled Tilapia and rice.  Quick, easy, and healthy!

Excellent...I did use fresh shaved Asiago cheese since I had no parm. Will make again, very tasty and easy. And loved the fact that this recipe called for very little oil. Thanks!

This was very tasty.  I did add some minced garlic as well.  I also did not put the cheese on until it had already baked for five minutes.  A tip if you want the asparagus to cook evenly: bend each piece until it snaps and throw away the bottom.  Each one will break in a different part, but the result is that all it will cook evenly.  It tastes great with and without the balsamic vinegar on it.

Tasty, though I added the vinegar a bit late.  It would taste better if the asparagus is peeled at the beginning.

This was ok. I've been trying to serve more vegetables lately so I chose this dish to go with scallop. I added some garlic powder & only cooked for 10 mins. I might try marinating to see if it comes out better. 1 oz of cheese is 1/4 C.

I won't downgrade my rating on this for my own blunder of overcooking. It still tasted really good, even though the asparagus was limp and shriveled insted of bright and crisp. The balsamic vinegar is an inspired addition (use GOOD balsamic, not the $3 a bottle kind).

I love asparagus pretty much every way you can cook it.  But this is over the top!  It was so good!  I didn't use a whole 1/4 cup of balsamic - just drizzled a few drops here and there.  I will be making this often!

This is such a great, simple way to enjoy asparagus! I used Parmigano Reggiano for the Parmesean, and I really believe it makes a big difference. My boyfriend and I ate this as a late night snack with cheese and crackers. This might be my new favorite way to eat asparagus!

Delicious!  I added 3 minced cloves of garlic to a little bowl of olive oil and let it sit for half an hour so the garlic flavor was all through the oil before drizzling it on the asparagus.  I had thin spears and it only took 8 minutes to cook.  This went absolutely perfectly with my Easter ham.

Great and simple.  I did cut the asparagus into bite size pieces so the kids would eat them.  I cooked them 7 minutes, pulled them out and put on the Parmesan cheese and then cooked them 4 more minutes.  Like others, I had the vinegar out on the table as an option.

We love asparagus prepared just about any way.  I've roasted it before but never used the shaved parm and balsamic.  Will definitely make it again this way.

Another good way to serve wonderful asparagus! I sprinkled the vinegar on so it wouldn't too much for our likes.

I made this for my fiancee's family and they loved it!  Even my future father-in-law ate the whole piece of asparagus (he usually only eats the tips).  The only thing I did differently was use grated parmesan cheese, and it still turned out yummy!

Very good.  I prefer the roasting to steaming.  The balsamic adds a nice little flavor at the end.  I forgot to add the parmesan and still enjoyed the dish.

Finally! An asparagus recipe I REALLY love, and that's super easy to prepare. I sprinkled a little Monterey Jack first, then put parmesan on top. Sooooooo good.

I would rather lightly steam my asparagus and serve it with hollandaise sauce.  I thought the parmesan was a gummy mass sitting on top of the asparagus, and that the balsamic did not partner well with the vegetable.  I even went out and got a high quality balsamic, per other reviewers' advice.

Very Very good. I love the parmesan flavor that it had.  I have made asparagus a few different ways in the last week and this def was a keeper of a recipe.  I would only bake for 12 minutes if you like them to have a nice crunch to them though.  Beyond that they get mushy.  THANKS!

Pretty good.  I prefer steaming the asparagus, but the balsamic vinegar and parmesean (I used shredded instead of shaved) added great flavor.  Will make again.

We love this recipe! The combination of flavors is delicious and it just couldn't be any simpler to make. The first time I made it I overdid the olive oil b/c it didn't seem like enough - but I was wrong. It's perfect as written and this recipe is now a staple at our house.

I don't normally like asparagus, but this recipe is delicious...I add a clove of crushed garlic when tossing, and I use the best cold pressed olive oil that I can afford....excellent, and I now go out of my way to buy asparagus - thank you!!

I don't get the hype!  Now I absolutely adore asparagus, parmesan, *and* balsamic vinegar; but when I made this dish, the shaved parmesan just sat on top of the asparagus and fell off in dry slivers instead of becoming more of a sauce (which I was kinda expecting).  I agree that the parmesan should be grated instead of shaved to help alleviate the problem. The flavors together were fine--the texture was just poor.

I really liked this recipe and it is so simple to make.  I used finely shredded fancy parmesan and it turned out pretty crunchy.

Almost 5 stars, except that I feel the parmesan would have been tastier and better distributed if it were grated instead of shaved.

I have to go against popular opinion on this dish and say that I was very disappointed.  I didnt think that the balsamic vinegar complimented the aspargus whatsoever (and that is coming from a person who usually loves apsaragus AND balsamic.) Thanks anyway Kimber.

I made this for my husband, and he said he really liked it... he doesn't say that much about vegetables.  I just used a handfull of aspargus, garlic-olive oil, and only needed to bake it for 7-8 minutes.

This was okay, but nothing special. I did use grated parmesan, because that was what I had, so maybe that makes a big difference? Will keep looking for another asparagus recipe, don't think I'd make this again. Thanks anyway!

Super easy and a delicious side dish.  We loved everything about it - the balsamic vinegar and parmesan where perfect additions; don't use the parmesan in a can - it's important to use the real stuff!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was fabulous (and quick and easy!).  We didn't even end up adding any balsamic vinegar because the asparagus was so good without it.  Thanks!

I just made this last night, and really liked the way it turned out.  I didn't have fresh parmesan cheese on hand, so I had to use grated.  But, it still tasted really good.  I didn't really like it with the balsamic vinegar though.

Yummy.  I marinated the asparagus for about an hour in the oil and basalmic vinegar.  I don't think this really made much of a difference.  Would have been just as easy to bake right away and add the vinegar afterwards.  Very good tasting, and different!

I made this recipe Thanksgiving 2002.  This vegetable was a hit.  It was so good everyone requested we have it again this year.  Thanks Kimber for a delicious recipe.

This is the best asparagus recipe.  I have never had asparagus as good as this!  I used a vegetable peeler to shave my cheese (a generous amount) and did everything according to the recipe without modifications. Excellent!
