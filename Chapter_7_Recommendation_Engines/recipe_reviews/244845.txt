Used fresh orange juice as that is what we had.  This was enjoyed all around by everyone!

This is a light and refreshing drink.  The key is to pair it with a beer with citrus notes.  I served it using Blue Moon, which was a great complement.  Beers are brewed in many ways and using a beer which has been brewed with citrus peel is ideal.

I made one of these not knowing it was called a beermosa. I just had a glass of beer and a cup of orange juice and thought they would make a good combo. Tasty and refreshing.

3.26.18  I like beer, and I like an occasional glass of champagne or prosecco.  This is my first beermosa, not sure there will be a second.  Prominent flavor still is beer with the OJ flavor very, very subtle.  Understand, you'll know you're not drinking a mimosa.  This was OK, just not super crazy about it.  Maybe Iâ€™m just too much of a dedicated wine drinker to really crave a beermosa.

This is a very nice drink and I will make it again. I'm not usually a beer drinker but this was very refreshing. I also tried it with grapefruit beer and I enjoyed that too.
