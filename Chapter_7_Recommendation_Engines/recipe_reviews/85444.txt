This is pretty basic and is leaving out some key ingredients. Add chopped onion or onion powder and a little bit of mustard. Also mix ketchup with equal part of brown sugar. Spread on top of meatloaf for the last 15 mins. of baking.

Seems like a good recipe, sausage makes a nice moist loaf,  but I would add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of chopped onion, a couple cloves of garlic chopped, some herbs, such as oregano and basil, for flavor.

This is basically the same recipe Mom used when I was growing up,with a couple of changes. Mix chopped onion in with the Hamburger and sausage. You can also use the Lipton dried onion in the box. I used the Onion and Mushroom for added flavor. Add 1/4 C Ketchup and mix in 2 eggs. Add dried bread crumbs until your meat mixture starts to hold form. After you place in baking dish,take 1/3 cup ketchup and mix in 4 or 5 T of Brown Sugar. If you don't have brown,use White. Pour over top of Meatloaf and bake. I put foil over top until the last 15 minutes of baking.  Believe me it is NOT too much ketchup.

Even in the OZarks we add onion and diced green pepper. You can add oatmeal to make a firm loaf if you need it.

Not much in it to add flavor. Also she says add 1/2 cup of ketchup to meat mixture, but doesn't say what to do with the 1/4 cup at the end of the ingredients list.

Thank you so much for proving that there are people out there that understand that food is good and does not have to be drowned out by onion, and other herbs and spices.  Sausage is a great flavor enhancer for the beef in this recipe, (thank you pork fat.)  And yes home-raised eggs and homemade bread makes the difference!

This is the best recipe with meat to egg ratio out there!  Stands alone just fine and makes great sandwiches the next day.  
Since my family likes a bit more spice, and because Im always sneaking veggies into EVERY meal to confuse my picky eaters, I now add grated carrot and zuchinni to this base, as well as onion, celery or green pepper. You can even add radishes, grated turnips, etc. Whatever you have! Meatloaf was made to hide veggies inside!  Just dice or grind them very fine.  The Pork adds a bit of moisture and different texture and flavor which makes the loaf stand out with firmness, yet also moistness.  A perfect texture.  We love Garlic added, Greek Seasonings, even taco seasoning to create different variations o f this fine loaf!  YUm!

This is as good as the meat you use to make it. I used very lean ground sirloin and maple sausage. I served with an array of condiments including, sweet & sour, ketchup, and chili, Worcestershire, and BBQ sauces. Also, piled roasted veggies on the serving platter. All my non-onion eaters were very pleased with this one.
