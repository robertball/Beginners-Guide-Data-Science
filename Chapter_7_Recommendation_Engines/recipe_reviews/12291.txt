This recipe saved some cherries quickly nearing the end of their lifespan from being wasted.  Even in my non-cherry-loving household, this was a hit.  I also used fresh cherries, about 2 cups, combined with 2/3 c. sugar and about 1 T. flour.

We have a couple cherry trees on our property and this year they were loaded with big tart cherries. After baking 4 pies and a cobbler this week I was looking for something new. This recipe is fantastic!
I substituted the canned cherry pie filling for 2 cups of pitted fresh cherries with 3/4 C. sugar and 1 T. flour stirred in. Then I used a slotted spoon to ladel the cherries over the crumb mixture to avoid getting something too sloppy. It turned out perfect. Fast, and easy enough that my 4 yr. old daughter could even help. This one's a keeper!

This was too floury for me.  I like a sweet crumble and decided it would be great if you halved the flour and used more butter and/or sugars.

Would you believe I made this recipe with fresh peaches?!?  It turned out great!  Sprinkled a little sugar and cinnamon on the peaches first.  Homemade dessert, VERY fast!  I highly recommend this recipe.

I just tried this with great results. I made the following alterations: I used  a refrigerated pie crust for the bottom crust in a 9inch pie plate. I used two cans of cherry filling (one lite and one no sugar). For the crumble, I used whole wheat pastry flour and put  all of it on top of the cherries. Baked for about the recommended amount of time. It's very good!

Outstanding dessert!  I stirred in a teaspoon of almond flavoring to the cherries and sprinkled a handful of sliced almonds with the crumb mixture
before topping the cherries.  Thanks Debbie

I didn't think anything could be better than my cherry crisp recipe until I tried this one.  It adds more of the delicious topping to the bottom.  What a wonderful idea.  We really enjoyed it warm with ice cream or milk.  I'll be using this recipe from now on.  Thanks.

This was good, and very easy. I'd add some pecans or some other chopped nut to the crumb mixture to give it a little more crunch next time.

This was very good! The only thing I did different was add a little bit more brown sugar so it wouldn't be too doughy. Turned out really good, my family loved it!!!  We had it with some vanilla icecream so it was just wonderful!!

It was good - but not great.  I thought the crumb topping was a bit bland. I am going to look for a different crumble type cherry pie.  It was not bad though and If I had the ingredients on hand - I would make it - but I would not go out of my way.  Good family dessert - but nothing to swoon over.

Finally tried this after it sat in my recipe box for 4 years! I can only say I wish I had tried it sooner. No more cherry pie for me - it's Cherry Crumble all the way! Everyone loved it. The texture is fantastic, the taste simply amazing, and making it was a snap.

This is my go-to dessert recipe. I'm not a fan of pie crust so I make this when my husband is craving cherry pie. I often use whole wheat flour along with the oatmeal bumps up the nutrition a bit. Works great with any pie filling, and my sister has used a mixture of frozen berries as well.

We LOVE this recipe, we also use it with Strawberries or Peaches (for fresh fruit use 2 cups diced fruit, 2/3 cup sugar & 1tbsp flour).
We also make extra crumble for the top because we love it so much.

I needed a way to use up all the sour cherries on my tree, and gave this a try, making my usual homemade pie filling.  My guests thought it was good.  I found it just a little bland.  I may try it again and add some sliced almonds to the topping. I did bake the crust a bit before adding the remaining  ingredients to keep the bottom from becoming soggy.  Thanks for a good recipe.

this was great. I used 2 cups fresh pitted cherries, combined with 2/3 cup sugar and a tsp. of lemon juice, and after mashing cherries in sauce pan, added some corn starch to thicken and put it all in. I only used 1 cup flour and used 1/3 cup brown sugar in the topping/crust. Very easy and tasty recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for one thing: I used fresh pitted cherries and not the canned stuff. I think this made the filling VERY DRY! I tried to fix it up as another reviewer mentioned (adding flour and lemon juice) but it did not work. I have no idea what I should have done to make the filling more soft and moist (like the canned stuff) but i was sorely disappointed.

I would suggest doubling the amount of crust mixture. We prefer ours to be balances out a bit more. 
I love this recipe because it is pretty universal. Add whatever fruit mix you would like.
Regardless - serve with lemon sorbet. It's the best.

This was so yummy! I accidently used quick rolled oats, but it still turned out really well. I used about half the flour though, the first time I used the amount called for and it was all I tasted. I also added a bit more sugar since I used fresh cherries and it cut the tartness.

Great easy recipe.  I made a few changes.  I put a touch of almond extract and vanilla extract in cherry filling and added some chopped pecans to the bottom crust.  It was great and I would highly suggest warming before serving.  It taste so much better warm.

Very easy to make. I added a little more butter (2tbsp) and sugar (2tbsp) plus a little under 1/4 cup coconut and 3tbsp of sour cream to the cherries. So So good for the munchies.

This definitely needs to be served with ice cream.  It's more of a topping than a dessert that can stand on its own.  If you're expecting a bar cookie (sort of like a lemon bar), this isn't it.  My family ate it, but no one was crazy about it.

This was a huge hit on Mother's Day!  I doubled the recipe so I could make in a big oval dish and used 4 cups of frozen cherries which I first defrosted.  I cut the brown sugar for the dough down to about 4 Tbs. (personal preference) and then lightly dusted the defrosted cherries with sifted flour and and about a Tbs of sugar because the cherries were pretty sweet on their own. This was incredibly easy to make.  I really like that you just press the dough into the pan and don't have to roll out pie dough.  I"m going to try it with blueberries next, I may never fool around with pie crust again!  Thanks Debbie!!!

I've made a few different crumble recipes off of this site, but this is the best.  The bottom layer was a nice touch.  Cutting butter can be a pain, which is why I liked this method.  I made an apple crumble because I had some to get rid of but will definitely try a cherry one next time.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a nice quick dessert and a great way to use the cherry pie filling I've had sitting in my pantry for too long.  Most of my family does not usually like cherries, but they actually enjoyed this.

Made this for a sick friend and she loved it! I used a little more brown sugar, added a little cinnamon, and used old fashioned oatmeal in place of rolled oats. Smelled heavenly!

I loved this recipe. I did make some changes. I doubled the recipe and added 10 tablespoons of brown sugar. I also did not press it down firmly to the bottom. I just left it crumbled, put the cherries on top and crumble on top of cherries. It was sooooo good. Next time i will add pecans.

Tripled the crumble and put 1/3 rd. On bottom of dish. I used 2 cans of cherry pie filling( tart cherries) and put the double layer on top. Baked it around 15 minutes longer( depending on your container your using and it was fantastic. My sis loves the crumble. Thanks for the recipe

This was excellent and several told me to "keep this recipe."  I doubled the recipe to fill a 9 x 13 pan.  I added about 1/2 - 1 tsp almond extract to the cherry filling.  I added about 2 tbl more of butter to the topping.  It was sooooo good!  Topped with whipped cream

I have been looking for a one of a kind cherry cobbler recipe for years and after making this amazing recipe I have found it!! A million thanks to the poster!! It is so delicious and super easy to make. I am beyond pleased :)). I did add a little bit of white sugar to the flour oat mixture because I like mine on the sweeter side. Someone also mentioned adding a bit of almond flavoring and almond slivers which is a great idea which I'll try next time.

I have made this 4 times with fresh cherries, with different modifications along the way. The original was excellent, but I found it to be too sweet, and prefer my version! I kept cutting the sugar until the last time I made it, for a family dinner; it received raves and I think I've reached perfection! For the flour and oats, I use 3/4 cups whole wheat flour and 7/8 cups rolled oats. I replaced the brown sugar with 4 tbsp succanat (dehydrated sugar cane with molasses remaining). I left the salt as is, but added 1 tbsp cinnamon to the dough and 1 tbsp cinnamon to the pitted fresh cherries.
Thanks for the great recipe!

I was looking for a streusel topping recipe and found this one.  Instead of cherry pie filling I made the super easy Blueberry Breakfast Sauce off this site. After I put the sauce on top of the bottom crumble I added about 1 cup of fresh blueberries before topping it with the rest of the crumble.  So delish! I made it again with the blueberries and added a couple of peeled, chopped nectarines.  One day I might even try it with the cherry pie filling.

I didn't have rolled oats, so I used the Just Bunches cereal and it gave me the crunch I needed with the crumble.  It is a great recipe and got great reviews from the bff.

I made the "crumble" exactly as stated, spooned it into the bottom of 6 ramekins, topped with cherry mixture and sprinkled the rest of the crumble on top.  I am still scraping the crumble mixture out of the bottom of my Pyrex.  It got very hard and it was just not sweet enough at all.  I think there needed to be some white sugar added.  I will not make this again.

This was so good! Instead of cherry pie filling you can use fresh cherries, first you pit them  and add 1/4 a cup of sugar. My family even bought fresh cherries for this dessert!

Sooooo easy and soooo good.  I used a little over 2 cups of fresh Wisconsin cherries, which were slightly tart.  I added 1/2 cup sugar and 1TLB flour to the cherries (I wanted to preserve the tartness).  I also added a few dashes of Allspice to the crumble mix.  The juxtaposition of tart cherries and sweet crumble was just perfect!  Everyone loved it!

Very tasty recipe and easy to make, I made it with my son and it took just a few minutes.  We added chopped hazlenuts to the dry mix and it added a nice taste.  Try it with whipped cream or ice cream.  I would like to try this recipe again sampling a different fruit but it's a keeper!

This gets 5 stars for easy to make and 4 stars for flavor.  I also used fresh pie (sour) cherries.  I had 3 c of those and tossed appx 1/2 c of sugar and 1 T of flour to the cherries before I put them on the crust.  The bottom crust worked out great and held together nicely when I dished out the cobbler.  I think it could have used more cherries next time though.

This was so good.  I only had cherry crumble once when I was little and this recipe tastes exactly like how I remembered it.  Yum.  I doubled the recipe and it turned out good.  A little on the sweet side.  Next time I'll try a lowersugar cherry filling, or maybe apple filling.  Got tons of compliments!  Try this recipe.

I used drained canned tart cherries in place of cherry pie filling. I thought it was delicious. A little more tart, a little less sweet.

I made it exactly like the recipe, but for adding almond flavoring to the cherries.  Husband loved it, but I wished the bottom wasn't as soggy. Perhaps cooking the bottom crust for a short time  might help.  I will be trying again as I want something different to serve with my thanksgiving pies.

This is a simple recipe and real tasty! Easy to make for a quick dessert. Only thing I did different was use less flour, a bit more brown sugar, and added some chopped pecans. Will definitely make this again

This is one of my favorite recipes. I found it years ago when I first downloaded the app after I moved out. I wanted something easy and good to try- and I found this! I make it almost every every 3 weeks for my significant other and I. I cut down the brown sugar from 6 tablespoons to 3 and also just use a whole stick of butter. Same great result every time and you can never tell I’ve added more butter and lessened the brown sugar.

I’ve been making this dish since I found it a few years ago on here. I add couple shakes more of oats and just use a full stick of butter. That way it’s no so floury and it tastes great. I love this cherry crumble. It’s become a staple for every holiday.

This was quick and simple. Flavor was fabulous. I followed some of the other suggestions and added a bit more brown sugar and cut flour back to 1 c. Also added chopped nuts  into the remainder crumb mixture for the top. It was a big hit.

Love this recipe for the crust and topping. I have not made it with cherries yet. We live strawberry rhubarb combinations, so that is what we have utilized. Made it last night with strawberry, rhubarb, and blueberries - what ever was fresh and in the frig. I put about 2 cups of fruit into a sauce pan with about 2/3 cup sugar and heat to be a reduction (bring to a slow boil for a little bit.) then I added about 2 Tbl of flour to the reduction. Poured the hot reduction on the crust, covered and baked as the recipe calls for. very Yummy. A favorite at home and the office.

Delicious! Easy to make and a treat to eat. One of my favorites using the sour cherries we picked over the summer.  I made a double batch of the cherry pie filling using the recipe on this site but reduced the sugar in half.

I made this as a special treat for my husband and son. I did admittedly make some changes. I omitted the flour and used 2 cups of quick oats instead. Used an entire stick of butter in the crust. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg and a splash of vanilla and almond extracts. I mixed all of the crust ingredients together. (I did partially melt the butter first. ) I put a layer of crust in the bottom of a well greased 8 x 8 baking dish. I layered a can of no sugar added cherry pie filling on top. Then I sprinkled that with chopped walnuts followed by the rest of the crumble crust mixture. I baked it for about 45 minutes at 375. It turned out great! I think almost any canned or fresh fruit would work well with this base recipe. :)

This is a great recipe,  I doubled the crust for thicker layers on both bottom and top. I also add some chopped walnuts to the crust and topping. Really easy to make and perfect for a quick fix!

Doubled the recipe for a pot luck.  It turned out great!  Added a teaspoon of almond flavoring to the two cans of pie filling and then added some almonds to the top crumble.  It was a hit!

I was looking for a smaller version of the tart cherry crumb "pie" my mum used to make for my birthday. This is not it. On my second try, I  made it with one cup flour, I cup oatmeal , 6 Tbsp. brown sugar I , tsp. cinnamon. I cut the cold butter in by hand. I did add I/2 tsp each of almond and vanilla extract to a no-added sugar can of cherry pie filling. I  covered the 8x8" foil pan, baked for 30 min @ 350, then uncovered for another 15 min. It firmed up some at room temp, but I like it cold, so I put it in the fridge . Plenty sweet, the topping , so the filling doesn't need to be. It's not quite Mum's; but then, it never is, is it?

This was a perfect. Simple dessert for the family. I doubled the recipe. Mine was not dry, nor was there too much crust. I added extra oatmeal n sugar to the top and sprayed with cooking spray. I am looking forward to trying this again only with frozen or fresh cherries.

To make this gluten friendly, I substituted almond flour for the all purpose flour.  It turned out yummy. The almond flavor actually complimented the cherries well.

Great recipe!  Just the right amount of sweet. Great alternative to cherry pie and very easy make. The only thing I would say is there was too much flour. I added a few tablespoons of vegetable oil to even it out.

Made this tonight for my family and we all agree that this is a keeper. I made it exactly as written but for one small addition... I added a Tbsp of lime juice to the cherry pie filling and mixed it together before pouring it onto the oats mixture. I like "sweet" but I also like a touch of "tart" in my crisps.

We used strawberries instead of cherries - more to my kids taste - and it turned out quite good!

So delicious! I doubled the recipe, added a tsp of almond extract, some sliced almonds on the top and subbed some almond meal for the flour. I made it three times in two weeks!

My first review!   I didn't use cherries, instead opting for frozen raspberries, blueberries and strawberries. I also added a bit of sugar and cinnamon to the berries and doubled the recipe. This recipe is absolutely delicious, but make sure you taste as you go. Some reviewers are stating their final product was less than stellar, and to the nay-sayers I would have to ask: Did you taste the topping as you made it and before baking? Because I found myself tweaking to my personal preferences.   Try it!

Turned out really good, goes great with vanilla ice cream! I'd reccommend doubling the recipe if you are feeding more than 3 though.

What I like about this recipe is that it’s homemade, easy, fast, and taste great!  This can be whipped up in 10 minutes, shoved into the oven prior to preparation of dinner and by the time you are ready for dessert…ta-da, a warm treat ready to be served with ice-cream and coffee.

Turned out really well. I used a pie tin and used the splenda brown sugar and no sugar added cherry pie filling. A nice crunchy texture to it and my husband really enjoyed it even after a few days.

Pretty yummy! And sooooo easy to make. Just a little too tart for me so I think next time I'll even try to make it with a different fruit.

I thought this was really boring.  After trying it, I melted 1/3 stick of  butter, added a little sugar and a lot of cinnamon, and drizzled it over the entire dish.  It saved the dessert - boosted it up to a 4.5.

I thought this was very yummy.  I used 2 cups of fresh cherries, plus 2/3 cup sugar and 1 tbsp of flour.  I thought my filling was a wee bit too tart and my crumble a wee bit too sweet, so I would probably adjust those slightly.  Very yummy though.

I added chopped pecans, shredded coconut, 1 TSP allspice, and 2 extra TBSP butter to the dough. I also used lite cherry filling. These changes gave the crumble terrific flavor. I am going to try apple filling next. Possibly two cans for more fruit.

My mother had just baked a store bought cherry crumble but becuase of the sugar content I couldn't have any.  I used no sugar added cherry pie filling and this turned out awesome!  The buttery crust was so great.  Definitely a keeper!

I substituted frozen pie cherries and added a bit more sugar but this was a great fast dessert.  I'll definitely make it again.
