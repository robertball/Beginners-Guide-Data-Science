Great starter recipe!!  I felt like it needed a little something so I added 8 oz. of blue cheese crumbles.  I also used chopped hazelnuts to roll it in.  Terrific.

Easy & delicious! No one will ever know there are only 3 ingredients - until you share this awesome recipe. I always make copies to share whenever I make this for a party, because I am always asked for the recipe. My husband hides the left over portion in the fridge so he doesn't have to share! I have rolled the ball in both chopped walnuts and chopped pecans. Both turned out very nice.

This recipe just tastes like creamy peanut butter. If you are going to make this make sure you make the balls really small and serve with savoury biscuits.

This is very easy to make and tastes very good, but I found it a little too salty even after it had been refrigerated overnight. I will make it again and decrease the ranch dressing mix.

Good but kind of hard for scooping, try adding sour cream to soften.

Delicious! The key to this recipe is to make it the day before you are gonna need it. When I first mixed it up and tried it, I was not impressed, but after letting it sit in the fridge overnight it was wonderful. I rolled mine in crushed walnuts. For as simple as this was to put together, it was really yummy. A definite keeper~! Thanks for sharing. :)
