This recipe absolutely rocks and was a breeze to prepare. My wife is an anti-lamb eater, yet she absolutely loved it. Prepared with roasted trio of potatoes, parsnips, and turnip root made for a two dish meal that was superb. We combined it with a Rioja Spanish Red Wine and it was the highlight of our meal selection for the week. A definate recommendation for any lamb nay-sayers.

P.S. I altered the marinade to include fresh parley, and substituted sea salt while allowing it to marinade for 24 hours.

I made this tonight and enjoyed it very much, although I omitted the salt and cut back on the olive oil a bit. The flavor was perfect: Just a background lilt of lemon to cut the meaty/fatty taste of the lamb, and a pleasant sharpness (also in the background) of rosemary. In other words, the flavors of the marinade didn't overcome the taste of the lamb, but instead played a supporting role to it and heightened all its best parts. I'll definitely be making this again.

I thought this was pretty good. The instructions are really exact to. I had 1.8 lbs of lamb chop loins, and wished I would have doubled the marinade especially the garlic. It seemed to just coat the meat. I used the olive oil option and just finely chopped some dried rosemary. The only thing I left out was the lemon rind as I find it to strong in most recipes. I broiled them on a foil lined sheet making pan clean-up easy. However, it did get my broiler quite dirty & smokey, for some reason, even though they weren't greasy. Maybe, covering them at the beginning would help with that.

Oh my, this recipe is amazing! I've made this recipe so many times now and it turns out every time. The flavor is amazing and the lamb comes out tender, juicy and infused with lemon and herbs every time. I like to marinate them for 2 hours max, then grill them. If you're looking for a great, easy and flavorful lamb chop recipe, look no further.

It was ok, but a bit bland for my tastes.  First taste was strong w/lemon, but then the next was mostly plain lamb.  The other spices were lost - I may try it with fresh spices instead.

WOW!!! I made this dish for Samhain (Celtic New Year/AKA Halloween) My husband and I loved it! I served it with bread and a variety of cheeses. I didnt use the grated lemon peel. Flavor was rich and succulent! I'm planning on trying this with venison.

Really good. Borrowed the lemon dijon sauce from the cambells soup kitchen recipe and that gave a tangy finish.

This made a tasty midweek meal and was quick to prepare. I marinated the chops overnight and fried them instead of broiling. I will no doubt make this again. Thankyou Mildred.

Fantastic flavor! The marinade would be good with chicken or pork also.  Next time, I will definately cut back on the olive oil though.

This is the best Lamb recipe I've ever had.  I decided to make it today, Valentines Day, for my family and it was a huge hit!   I'm really not into the whole mint taste in a few other recipes I've tried.  This one doesn't call for mint so I was eager to try it.  I'm glad I did!  It was so tasty and savory tender.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I made this recipe twice last week it was so good! We used Icelandic lamb. Added a pinch of orange zest to substitute lemon zest. 1st time we marinated for 2.5 hours, second time was overnight. Make sure the proportions for seasoning are exact as that can make a big difference with your lamb. When marinating, also ensure the mixture is evenly distributed.

This recipe reminds me of the lamb chops my husband and I get at the greek restaurants.  We were so impressed with the flavor.  As we ate them we sprinkled fresh lemon juice and salt on them.  This is a dish I will make for special occasions!!

great recipe! The flavors were so good, and I'd reccomend it to anyone who wants to make some good lamb. There's only one change in the recipe I'd make-- I prefer to sear the lamb on a pan to get the lamb nice and crispy

This recipe is simple and it always comes out beautifully. No changes are needed for this recipe, but I've noticed the longer it marinates, the better it tastes. It tastes so good with rice and fresh green beans and my kids love it.

This recipe reminds me of my favorite lamb chop recipe "Limey Lamb Chops" from "The Florida Cookbook".  The juice and zest of a Persian lime, combined with melted butter, minced garlic clove, and a blend of thyme, marjoram, ginger herbs was used as a basting sauce when broiling fresh lamb chops.  That particular combination worked well to neutralize the fatty mutton taste, while enhancing the overall flavor of the lamb chops.

Excellent results with this recipe - I marinated my chops for about 4 hrs and baked them at 400F for an hour.  I topped them with potatoes and carrots and wrapped the whole with foil.  My husband loved them!  This will certainly become a favourite.

Made this for my fiance for his birthday dinner along with a few other recipes.  He is very picky but he and I both loved this.  Incredible flavor and I only got to marinade it for two hours.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe several times.  The marinade is my go-to recipe for grilled lamb chops.  Do not be tempted to add additional lemon or you will have too much of a good thing.  Having deviated once - I stick to the recipe.  You can't go wrong with this.  Love it!  Thanks for sharing,
