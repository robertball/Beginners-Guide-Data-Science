This dish was great! I followed the recipe exactly the way it is and I was so happy with the results. The corn was great in there too. It was my first time making rajas and my husband said they were delish! I felt so proud of myself. Serve with a side of beans and warm torillas for a full dinner. Provecho!

I have an abundance of poblano peppers in my garden (a veggie we are pretty new to), so I was looking for some new ways to eat them when I came across this recipe.   Our entire family LOVED it!!!  We just finished eating, and I already have requests for it again.  My husband raved about it, something he almost never does, even about his favorite dishes. This dish is not too hot, something I appreciated.  The corn balances the flavor of the peppers very nicely, and the sauce really cools down the hotness of the peppers. I *almost* made this exact to the recipe...there were a couple slight changes.  First, I couldn't find Mexican crema, so I made my own (1 part sour cream to 4 parts light cream).  Also, I only used about half the called for amount of cream cheese.  It was perfect.  I think (for us) the full amount would have been too much. We served this as a topping over chicken breasts that were salted, peppered, and cooked in a skillet, in butter and garlic.  Delicious!!!

Boy, oh, boy - this was the perfect recipe.  I am newly married to a Mexican and although I am of Mexican heritage, I don't know much about Latin cuisine.  But to my advantage, I love to eat and explore.  Last weekend, I ate tamales de rajas.  I loved this and this made me think.  Although, I didn't want to attempt tamales, I wanted to incorporate rajas into my cooking.

I found this recipe and to make empanadas.  I used the same basic recipe without adding corn. 
I made the empandada dough added a chuck of Queso Fresco and the rajas to the center and processed with traditional emapanadas.  My husband loved this.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.  Because of this recipe, my husband will be taking this to his co-workers tomorrow to "show off" my cooking skills. AR is my secret - you make me look good.  Thanks

Great. I did what I always do with my Mexican recipes, and added 1 smoked poblano in adobo, and some cilantro. Love it. Next time, I will add some pepperjack cheese and reduce the cream cheese.

Delicious!!! These rajas are so authentic. I had not had these in years and I had them for the first time this year when I went on vacation to Guadalajara, Mexico. These taste just like those. Sooo good!! I look forward to making them and can hardly wait until I do.

I had purchased some Poblanos b/c they were on sale and wanted to do something different with them.  I was just thinking "dip" when I made it, but after I made it (it was thicker than I expected) it hit me to add some chicken and made some enchiladas!  I also added some jalapenos for some heat (Poblanos don't have "heat") and some SW seasoning.  I made a simple cream sauce (using the Poblanos, chopped) topped it with some cheese and it was FANTASTIC!!  Great for something different!  Thank you for the recipe!!

This are good! But my poblanos were not spicy at all! :(  If you want them spicy you might want to try adding a couple serranos when roasting the chile, didn't use the griddle just put them under the broiler for couple min. just turn them over half way, I only used 1/4 of a cup of cream cheese in my opinion I don't think it needs the whole package unless you want them really creamy.Thanks Gema!

Followed the recipe exactly. It came out as a gwampy mess for a side dish. As a dip, fair. Didn't have much flavor.  I think as a side dish, it would be very good just using the crema and not the cream cheese. As for a dip, one star is too much.

Very Good! My first time roasting peppers, and the skin was really hard to get off!!! The only changes I might make next time might be to add chicken to make it a more rounded out meal for tortillas. I also think this would be great as more of a dip if the peppers were cut into bite size pieces instead of strips. Idk what I did wrong with the roasting of the peppers, but I may just saute them next time!!!

This is basically the same recipe I was given by this lovely lady who ran the kitchen in a little hole in the wall buffet style kitchen we came across in San Diego. Her rajas were fabulous and she overhead me raving about them and wondering how they were made and she came out and told me. She said giving the poblanos a good charring to peel but especially for flavor was the key and not to skip on the chicken bouillon.  We love this stuff and make it every time we know we'll have the grill going so we can char the peppers.

Hint, you can char, peel, slice and freeze your poblanos so you can make this in a jiffy on a weeknight. Just pull them out of the freezer in the morning and they're defrosted enough by dinner to add to your pan.

My husband and I are huge fans of poblano peppers so I was looking up recipes and came across this one. Decided to give it a go. I made it exact to the recipe and let me tell you IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! The only problem I had was peeling the skin after roasting them. But it was well worth it! I fried some potatoes with it and we put it all in tortillas and it was a huge hit! And we have plenty left for tomorrow! Such a great recipe that will be going into my permanent rotation!

Absolutely delicious!  I've made many recipes from this website, but this is my first comment/review. I've made this recipe so many times that I feel I owe a review.  If you like poblano peppers and anything creamy, then chances are you will love this recipe.  My husband, who is from Mexico City, was pretty impressed the first time I made it, and so was I!  It has made its way into our meal rotation.  Now when I make it, i use regular sour cream because that's what we have on hand and only use half a pack of cream cheese instead of a whole. Another thing I love about this recipe is this is a dish that you can make ahead and tastes great the next day!

When I went to make this I realized I had no cream cheese. So, I left it out and upped the Mexican cream to 3/4 of a cup. Came out DELICIOUS!! We will be having this again soon.

I love this recipe as a side dish i use butter instead of oil and cut the cream cheese to half.  Sometimes i also use it as a bed for pork chops yummy

This recipe was delicious. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it. I added in a jalapeno to make it spicy and have added chicken strips to turn it a one-dish meal served with tortillas.
