It's my recipe, of course I love it.  Some quick notes: a jar of Tostitos Monterey Jack Queso dip (in the chip aisle) works great for the sauce.  Also, depending on the size of your tortillas, sometimes a larger baking dish works better.  Enjoy!

Oh man. I just made this recipe as a gift for my brother, who doesn't cook, and my mother, who just started radiation treatment for breast cancer and is too tired to cook. I doubled it and sampled an enchilada for myself, and it's one of the best things I've ever made off this website. I followed it to the letter. It's got the perfect amount of "kick" to it. The filling was easy to make. The enchiladas were easy to put together. I don't think I could have asked for anything more!

We really liked this - with a few tweaks it could be perfect!  Next time I'll try adding jalapenos or chiles as we thought it could use just a little more kick.

These were fabulous and SUPER easy!  I made my own white cheese sauce because I did not have any jarred sauce on hand, and it was still delicious.  I also put some re-fried beans in the same baking dish and it made it a great one-dish meal.  I will definatley be making them again!

Ridiculous. The only enchilada I would use the word "decadent" to describe. I used a 9x13" pan though, and stuffed 6 very fat enchiladas in it. As an added toping, I spread some remaining filling on top, followed with a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese and a thin layer of bread crumbs to give it a nice baked crust that added some nice crunchy texture.

I have made these several times.  The first time as written and way too bland.  After that I add 1/2 package of taco seasoning mix and that totally changes and adds a lot of flavor. I sautee the chicken in olive oil with McCormicks N'Orleans cajun seasoning and cut into pieces.  I spray my pan with pan and don't put the sauce in the bottom.  I place the sauce on top and the last few minutes sprinkle some shredded cheese on top.  My hubby requests at least weekly.  With those changes definitely a 5 star recipe!

Love it!!! used the queso suggested, and it was fabulous. Uses low fat/no fat sour cream/cream cheese/tortillas and it still tasted great.  Will make again & again.

I'm sorry, but my hubs and I didn't care for this at all. :( Your recipe definitely earns points for being easy to throw together, but is barely worth 2 stars tastewise. The queso was off-putting, there was too much of it and the enchilada filling was excessively creamy. Every bite was mushy and artificial tasting (it goes without saying that pre-processed ingredients are convenient but tasteless). Maybe these will float your boat, but it certainly didn't ours. Thanks anyways, LARANEFF.

Loved the recipe, but I tried it with low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream (i could taste the difference-wont't try that again).  Also, I haven't found the white queso that I love so much at Habanero's.  If I can find that, this will be perfect

These were exactly as the recipe stated: easy and delicious. I did use low fat cream cheese, simply for less calorie content, and it still tasted amazing. I ended up with slightly more filling than I had tortillas (I was only cooking for two), so I poured the remaining filling over the top of the enchiladas, and then added shredded cheese over the top of that. SO good, very rich!

this was AWESOME. I signed up for an account just to rate this. I prefer corn tortillas over flour... it made this recipe feel a little bit heathier when eating it lol. instead of rooling them, I just layered corn tortillas at the bottom and on top, then I put sauce on top and sprinkled the shredded cheese on top (and didnt put it in the middle cuz i forgot to) it was awesome. yummmmmyyy...

Very good and super easy! I followed the recipe exactly but halfway through cooking sprinkled more shredded cheese on top. I also used whole wheat tortillas, fat free cream cheese, and fat free sour cream and you could not tell the difference.

These are great!  I was actually able to make 8 of them using thick tortillas, and they had plenty of filling.  I'd recommend using a bigger dish, as I could only fit 5 enchiladas in the 8x8 size.

This is one of those recipes where it depends on what brands you use/what you like.  I used Tostitos Monteray Jack Queso, a rotisserie chicken and a brand of green enchilada sauce I'd not tried but trusted.  Easy weeknight meal I'd absolutely do again - even posted it on my facebook status! Thank you for a great recipe.

These enchiladas are super easy and super good. I used a 13 x 9 pan and in the place of the green salsa I used half green salsa mixed with regular enchilada sauce. Also- I added some chopped onion. When there was about 5 minutes left I topped the dish with a light layer of the Mexican blend cheese and a sprinkling of cilantro- very yummy. I think next time I will add more chicken- there was a little too much tortilla going on and this will balance it out. I served with black beans and had a plate with jalapenos, tomatoes, and onions for toppings.

This was the most AMAZING enchilada recipe I have ever tried. I doubled the recipe and instead of using green salsa, I cooked up a bag of frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, chopped them fine and mixed that in. Also used one 10 oz can of chicken and 3 pre-grilled chicken breasts(chopped up fine). It had the most awesome taste and texture! Everyone loved it, DEFINITE keeper!!! The vegetables added a nice touch of color too.

delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I cooked chicken breasts on the stove top and shredded/cut up into pieces. I also added 1-2 small spoonfuls of black beans in the tortilla before i added the chicken/sour cream mixture. My picky son (who claims he doesnt like beans) LOVED these. My husband ate the leftovers for lunch the next night and he never eats leftovers. Mine made 8 large tortillas.

Don't let it's appearance fool you!  Although it lacks in color and appears bland, this recipe is packed with flavor.  It easily makes 8 tortillas for a 9X13 casserole dish.  Lots of filling.  I used a jar of store brand white salsa con queso for the topping and it was easy and delicious.  For an added touch and pleasing presentation, I topped with shredded leaf lettuce and a bit of red salsa and sour cream. Definately a do again.

Fabulous! I didn't have green salsa so I used enchilada sauce. I also put the enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan and then put a little queso, topped it with 8 enchiladas in a 9x13 pan and then used more enchilada sauce and queso. Was delicious!

I used leftover shredded chicken breasts instead of the packaged precooked chicken, and I added sauteed onion, a couple cans of green chiles, and some splashes of RedHot hot sauce to the chicken filling - and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  It turned out excellent, and was a very flavorful dish.  My husband and my kids loved it too.  I will definatly be making this one again!

Quick, easy and tasty.  I used 4 cheese alfredo sauce and store bought roasted chicken. Made it as a casserole.  It was a hit with my coworkers and already had to give out the recipe a few times. I will try putting rice and beans next time.

Real kid pleaser! Everyone enjoyed it. I had to use a 13x9" baking pan, though. No way they would fit in an 8x8. I used fresh chicken breast that I roasted and then chopped. That packaged stuff is too expensive.

This was extremely good, but very rich.  I'm not sure that its worth the calories.  I added a little red pepper, and some cumin.

Awesome!! My 3-year-old even scarfed it down! I did grill my own chicken, used reduced fat cream cheese, and used whole wheat tortillas to make it a little bit healthier. This recipe will be a must for Mexican food night for our family.

This was so easy, & tasted good, but after I ate it I felt gross because its so fattening. So if you want something yummy you'll love this. If you want something healthy eat something else.

Yummy!! Thank you for this recipe! It's so easy (the best kind : ) and really, really good! Everyone loved them. I came back to print recipe requests and decided I needed to leave a review (not something I normally do). I needed to make a lot for a fellowship luncheon. I just chged the serving size from 6 to 28, and followed to the T. I think it ended up making 42 enchiladas! Anyway, it was the rave and I thank you...definitely a keeper!!

Very rich but worth it..... I added Black beans as a filler to make them a little more hearty. I also add sour cream to the filling to thin it out a little bit.... my husband loves them and request almost too often :)

I didn't change a thing (except for using the leftover chicken in the ROAST STICKY CHICKEN-ROTISSERIE STYLE recipe for the chicken), this was a HUGE hit in our house, which includes some very picky eaters. This has become a staple recipe for us & is great enough to serve to guests. Wish I could give it 6 stars :-)

Easy and good! I added a bit of shredded cheese on top and used chopped green chilis instead of green salsa (all the green salsa I found contained MSG) Next time, I will use less of the Queso dip, but overall a great recipe.

This is a really good recipe, the only changes I made were I shredded the chicken instead of cubes and I used corn tortillas. My husband is very picky about mexixcan food and he enjoyed it, even taking the leftovers for lunch!

Floured tortillas with canned cheese sauce dumped on them?  Against my better judgment I made this. It's not terrible. It's just kind of a lazy recipe and taste like a lazy recipe.

(Note: this is very mild - for more pop get more green chilies and layer them in the tortillas with the meat sauce) I made this recipe with the "White Cheese Sauce" from this site and it was AMAZING!  My 4 picky kids (10, 9 and 7 yr old twins: who often will boycott dinner if they even THINK they won't like it) loved it and were begging for more.  Even my very "sensitive" 10 yr old who cannot tolerate even the slightest bit of spice was snorking down and gulping the water, lol!  I doubled it so we could have enough for a second meal(for a family of 6) and wasn't left with enough leftovers to fill a plate, barely.  I admit, I am a bad one for tweaking a recipe, based on reviews, and then reviewing the original one based on my changes (the same thing I roll my eyes at other reviewers doing, lol!) BUT, this one I actually did not change, other than using my own previously cooked and frozen chicken meat, and making my own Queso sauce (the aforementioned one from this site) just because I like to use real food with fewer additives when possible. Oh, and I added fresh chopped cilantro in with the meat mixture. (My 7 yr old daughter just informed me that she's taking some of the enchiladas to school with her for lunch tomorrow, even.)  Next time I will cut out the meat, and add in tomatoes and black beans, for a wonderfully satisfying meatless meal.

Sorry, not a fan. Very easy to throw together but as another reviewer stated I also felt The queso was off-putting. I also felt the texture was mushy and artificial and salty tasting due to all the processed ingredients. Just felt there was a little too much fat going on between the cream cheese, sour cream, cheese & queso and all of them together was not to my liking.  I much prefer the spinach enchiladas from this site.

Super easy!  It all tasted good until I added the queso dip.  As someone previously said, it does artificiall especially after all the work I put into it.  I did tweak it some BEFORE adding the queso.  I slow cooked my chicken breasts all day then shredded it.

My husband loved it. I substituted red salsa and shredded the chicken as I don't like chunks of chicken. I used a can of mushroom soup diluted with 1/2 can of milk instead of the white cheese sauce. The enchiladas were creamy and very tasty.  Loved it!!

A really delicious enchilada. The homemade white cheese sauce gave it a much better flavor than the similar recipes I've made with a can of cream soup.

I made these last night and everybody liked them.  I used 2 cups of Mexican cheese blend and then about 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar.  I didn't use the packages of chicken, instead I cooked a whole chicken and used half the meat since I doubled the recipe. The rest is tonight's chicken and homemade noodles.  I found Monteray Jack white cheese sauce near the salsas in the grocery store and it was delicious.  I will definitely make it again.  The 11 year old made nachos later with some of the remaining chicken and the rest of the cheese sauce!

This recipe turned out great! My family loved it. I made my own white cheese sauce to pour over the top, YUM!! Very easy and a great week night meal! I did make one change and instead of green salsa, I used regular green enchilada sauce! very good!

This is a great easy recipe. I made it for my family and they loved it. I teach a cooking class for a group of youth at my church and they loved it also and have made it for their families.  I used roasted chicken from the store and went exactly by the recipe the first time.  I will try different versions next time also.

Delicious! I took another reviewers advice and combined rice and beans and put it over the sauce on the bottom of the pan as a side dish. Turned out great.

We loved this recipe.  The Hubbie said it was better then any mexican restaurant.  I had to change two things... Queso Dip and Rotisserie Chicken.  First I couldn't find Queso Dip so I made my own with Mexican Cheese and milk- very thick and rich. And I used a Rotisserie Chicken also.  It was fast and easy adding great flavor to the filling.  We will be making these again.  YUMMY!  Thanks Lisa!

I hate to be negative, but I felt disgusting eating these. They are so heavy. My husband, however, loved them. He will be finishing the rest of the pan himself.

These chicken enchiladas are not only easy, but they are DELICIOUS!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used the Monterey Jack queso (which I found in the chip aisle in the grocery store).  Thanks for the recipe.  It has become a definate keeper at my house.

Pretty good and very easy too make. REALLY rich though. The only change I made (accidently) was letting them stay in the oven too long. Gave it a nice little crunch on the outside.

This has become a favorite of my family. Take caution with the sauce...try to get the mildest that you can find. The jalapenos seen to get warmer once cooked. A little spicy for the children but they still clean their plates. It is that good.

This was okay, but not great.  It seemed to lack some "zip."  I followed the recipe exactly but think I should have modified it to make it a little zesty/spicy.

Not fantastic, but passable.  It was too contrived w/ the pre-made white cheese sauce on top -- I used Tostito's brand as recommended.  Without the tortillas & with shredded chicken, would have been good as a chip dip...but not as enchiladas.

Very easy recipe, and delicious!  I'd suggest to put your corn tortillas in a ziplock or airtight container, and microwave them for 30 seconds before you attempt to roll them. Otherwise you'll end up with torn tortillas and a messy counter :)

Easy and so good! Used a can of rotel instead of the green salsa because that’s what I had on hand! Will be rotating this recipe in my week night dinners.

Great with some tweaking. Use cream of chicken soup instead of cheese sauce and use (warmed) corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. Your family will love it!

It was very good I made some minor changes as well, I bought jalapeño cream cheese and made my own chicken seasoned it with taco seasoning and green chilies and onion. And put diced green chilies in the mixture. The husband and children approve therefore I do!

I did add some additional spices - garlic powder, onion powder, and white pepper. These are easy and delicious!! My guests have loved them. Be sure to spray the dish you put them in even when putting some of the queso sauce under the enchiladas.

This is simple and delicious. I made a couple minor tweaks and a mistake and it was still great. My wife isn't a big mexican food fan, but she loved it. I'll definitely make it again. 

The tweaks: I used corn tortillas instead of flour because I like them better. You will likely get about eight enchiladas out of this recipe if you use corn tortillas because they're smaller than flour. I would also microwave a stack of them for 30 seconds under a paper towel to make them easier to roll without breaking. I also added some taco seasoning to the filling on the advice of another reviewer. I recommend both. 

The mistake: I forgot to mix in the shredded cheese with the filling, so I ended up just covering the top with sharp cheddar. It made a nice cheesy crust on top that didn't burn, so I would do that again. Next time I'm going to add some shredded monterey jack to the filling as well. 

Did I mention that this recipe is very easy to make? Try it.

This was so easy, and so, SO good.  The only change I made was to use my own baked seasoned chicken breasts instead of the packaged since that was what I had on hand. This is a great recipe for those days when you just don't feel like cooking.

I made my own cheese filling and of course added a few odd and end additions to make it how my family would like it.  I added green chilies and garlic and onions.  I also use all fresh ingredients when ever possible.  I also used jalapenos a few times which really makes it great !  :)

My whole family loved this recipe, it is a keeper for sure. The only changes I made was I made my own Monterey Jack Queso, I felt it would be cheesier and creamier than the stuff bought in the store. One of my daughters is gluten free so she was able to eat the chicken mixture so we placed that in a corn tortilla for her and just sprinkled cheese over that and baked, but i am sure if your whole family id gluten free you can find a substitute for flour to thicken the Queso sauce. This is most defiantly a keeper.

This was an exceptionally good recipe. I cooked my own chicken though, because I don't like the pre-cooked chicken. I seasoned it with seasoned salt, ground cumin and pepper. I used the Tostitoes Monterrey Jack queso dip and it provided wonderful flavor and heat. Also I used fat free cream cheese and lite sour cream...couldn't tell the difference. Served with Rotel tomatoes and green chilies, shredded lettuce, and Spanish rice. I will definitely be making this again.

I made a batch of these for work and one for home and both have already asked for more. I didnt have white cheese sauce available so i used regular queso and mixed in the extra green salsa, was delicious. I have the white queso this time and cant wait to see how it comes out!!

This was quite good and very easy! I used my own cut-up chicken though, not the packaged kind. I also added a bit of salsa to the white cheese sauce/queso dip, to make it go further and for added spice. I will definitely make this again....super when you are short on time!

Excellent and very filling.  I cubed and then fried chicken breast in butter (seasoned chicken with Soul Seasoning).  I used regular salsa, a pizza blend of cheese, and low fat sour cream because that is what i had on hand.  Everything else was as directed.  I only wish i would have added cooked rice to the bottom of the pan before adding the rolled enchiladas.  My husband said that this is a new favorite.

Made these for a friend and I for something different than red Enchiladas. So yummy we ate the whole pan, just us which is VERY unusual. White Queso was difficult to find though.

These were fabulous.  I made them for my parents and they loved them.  I made 2 of them with low carb tortillas cause my dad and I are restarting Atkins and they were still every bit as good. Thanks for the recipe.
