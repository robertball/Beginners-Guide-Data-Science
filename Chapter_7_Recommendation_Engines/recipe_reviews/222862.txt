Family LOVED the cilantro lime butter for this recipe! Had plenty of butter left over, so I wrapped it in parchment paper, rolled into a "log" and saran wrapped it to freeze. Going to try this butter on steaks and other foods!

We love corn prepared on the grill.  This butter gave the corn a delicious fresh taste.  We also used the leftover butter on some garlic bread and grilled fish.  Thanks, BritanyRachelle for sharing your recipe.  It is a winner in our house!

This was delicious but it did need some salt and pepper.  The corn was nice and sweet but with the addition of the lime juice and cayenne gave it a bit of heat and tartness that just worked really well with the sweet corn.  Will definately make this again!

I only give it a four because I only used the butter part of.  I took the husk off, wrapped in foil and threw it on the grill.

I made this using bottled lime juice instead of fresh and thought it was amazing. Perfect amount for the corn too.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  So easy to make and like other posters I had plenty left over.  Just put it in the freezer (wrapped) and got it out of the freezer whenever we grilled corn on the cob.  Fantastic!

I followed this recipe exactly and thought it was very bland really didn't taste the  lime at all IF I make it again I would at least triple the lime maybe also use so zest to ramp it up

I used to live in South Texas close to the Mexico border and this brings back those crazy days of running across the border to shop, drink, and stop at an elote stand to get some corn.  It taste almost the same! The only difference was that they used mayonnaise instead of butter and tamarido or lots of chille seasoning.  I loved this recipe just the way it is, the butter is amazing and really good on skirt steak! Thanks!
