I love this recipe, but I turn it upside down.  I spray the casserole dish with "pam," and then spread the corned beef first(i've even used worthington's vegetarian corned beef.) then, i layer with the sauerkraut and salad dressing mixture.  top that with plenty of swiss cheese.  then top it with cubed rye bread, that has either been buttered, or sprayed with "pam." when the rye bread topping is toasted, the casserole is done.  great solution for those who did not like the soggy bread at the bottom.

Very good, rich. Here's how I tweaked it. I scaled the recipe to make 1/2. I spread the bread on the bottom of an 11X7 pan. Then in a large bowl, I mixed 14 oz. can drained kraut, 3/4 c cubed cheese, 1/2 lb. shredded corned beef & 8 oz. bottle of 1000 Is. dressing. Poured that over the bread cubes, covered with foil & baked. Topped with remaining cheese & baked 10 min longer. Perfect.

This one, according to my husband...ROCKED! Essentially, it's like the sandwich, only layered and baked. One change I made since I was making it for people I didn't know very well, was instead of rye bread, I purchased at my local grocer an "Asiago Cheese Loaf" I think any firm bread would be great, but the cheese bread, along with the other ingredients, were a perfect match. Husband, says,"Put this one into the rotation" High praise indeed! :) Also, it was so rich, that I think that next time I can substitute Low Cal 1000 Island, and I know he won't notice!

Very tasty! If you love Reuben sandwhiches, you will truly love this casserole. I did the two-layer approach, layering the ingredients twice, with great results. Do err on the side of *more* dressing and cheese than the recipe calls for to achieve a moist result. I also used thousand-island...super tasty. It *is* an expensive recipe. I found though that the portions are awfully generous: I scaled the recipe back to 4 portions and I still fed a hungry man, myself, and had 2 giant lunches leftover. (BTW, I find it's great reheated...just make sure to reheat in the oven, not microwave so the bread doesn't get soggy).

This was excellent.  My husband and I both loved it.  The only thing I might do different the next time is add more thousand island dressing.  I think I would double the amount.  This recipe is so easy and much less messy than traditional Reuben sandwiches.

I love Reubens but, sometimes they're a pain to make. I like this recipe because it mimics the taste, if not the essence of a Reuben sandwich.

I made this twice before posting my comments --- both times in an 11x7 casserole dish and scaling down the ingredients (e.g., 1/2 lb corned beef instead of 1 lb, etc.)

TOAST YOUR BREAD! Otherwise, it will come out soggy. What I did was to cut up my bread and put it into the casserole dish, then put the dish into the oven while it was warming up.

I drained, but did not rinse my sourkraut. I think that this give a bit more flavor to the dish.

I used Thousand Island dressing (instead of Russian) both times. It still turned out great.

Enjoy!

This was delish!  My hubby devoured it.  I toasted the bread cubes on the advice of previous reviews, and the bread ended up being one of the tastiest parts.  I also used 1000 Island dressing, and more than 3/4 Cup -- I gave it a good drizzle over the top to lightly but evenly coat it.  The only thing I would do different would be to get the cheese right -- I thought I bought a block of swiss, but noticed while I was grating it that I had picked up sharp cheddar by mistake.  It still came out awesome, but the swiss would be even better.  Mmmmm.  My husband asked me to put this in regular menu rotation.

Updated to add:  I've made this a couple more times now, and with the swiss cheese, which was better as I expected.  This dish is a great hit with our family!

Definately a keeper!  My husband and I both liked it.  But the bread was soggy (except for the edges in the pan), may toast it first or use croutons.  I used marble rye bread.  I made it low fat with fat free thousand island dressing and low fat cheese and it was still very tasty.  Next time I will try Russian Dressing and Turkey!.~~Thanks Monica for sharing!

I thought this was very good. My husband really liked it. He even packed it for is lunch the next day, and he doesn't usually even take a lunch! I used Thousand Island dressing and increased the amount to about 1 cup. It's very easy and it doesn't take long to cook. You can still have a good, hot meal on those extremely busy days. Next time I make this,I would like to try it with a mustard dressing as mentioned in one of the reviews. Thanks for the recipe!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, THIS RECIPE. This is one of our favorite dinners. Have made this several times. I usually buy a loaf of soft rye, cut 1/2 into cubes, lightly toast them with a drizzle of olive oil, then put cubes under broiler. I add about a bottle of Ken's Russian. Tried Thousand Island dressing, but I think Russian tastes so much better. Also, if you can find shredded swiss it works better than the slices. I cover the dish with the non stick aluminum foil. Saves the headache of having your cheese stick to the foil. I like to serve this with the Taste of Home's Creamy Coleslaw recipe also found on Allrecipes. Superb!!!

This receipe was really good, and quick, it tasted just like a Rueben Sandwich, so if you like Rueben Sandwiches, you must try this one.  First, I would like to agree with the other reviewers that this recipe is EXPENSIVE.  I paid $10.15 just for the corned beef.  Total cost of meal was approximately $30.00.  I initially purchased a corned beef brisket and begin cooking it until I read the recipe and it called for corned beef deli meat.  And just a side note, the corned beef brisket takes FOREVER to cook, and I don’t think it would work as well as the deli meat.  I listened to the other reviewer’s suggestions about the soggy bread, and decided to make a few changes.  I spread the bread with butter and toasted in the oven, which made it extremely hard.  I also layered the casserole in the following matter:  The toasted rye, corned beef, sauerkraut, thousand island dressing, Swiss cheese, and repeated the layering, and placed crumbled rye/pumpernickel bread on top of the casserole, sprinkle with no-salt butter. I also used canned sauerkraut.  I drained it really good, and even squeezed the sauerkraut by hand to squeeze the access water outof it.  When I baked the casserole, the bread remained crispy throughout the entire casserole.  The only change I would make is to spray the bread with oil spray and not use actual butter, because the casserole was kind of greasy.

I listened to other reviewers and used a 1/2 lb of corned beef and 1,000 island dressing.  I also sprayed the dish & put the meat at the bottom, put a mix of the saerkraut & dressing next, then I put all the cheese on, on the top I put the rye bread (5 slices) and sprayed the bread with pam.  I cooked with tin foil for 20 mins and uncovered for 10.  It turned out beautiful.  If you love reubens, you'll love this!

Excellent! Based on other reviews, I made it upside down and toasted the bread before putting it on the top layer.  I put the corned beef on the bottom, then sauerkraut, then 1000 Island dressing, then Swiss cheese, then toasted rye bread cubes.  Sprayed I can't believe it's not butter spray generously on the bread cubes.  Definitely a keeper.  Use cheese and dressing generously.

I made this for a potluck.  I used my 6 qt. oval crockpot and it came out great.  Everyone said that it was the best hotdish.  I toasted the bread first and then added the other ingredients. I did use thousand island dressing instead of the russian and used more dressing than was stated. Also put the cheese in with the other ingredients and turned the crockpot on low. It was ready in a couple of hours. Thanks for this wonderful, easy recipe.

This was great for the crockpot family get-together! Everyone loved it. I used a full loaf of 'swirl' rye, 1-1/2 lbs of sliced deli corned beef (cut in strips), 1 quart sauerkraut(drained not rinsed), 16 oz. Thousand Island dressing, and 1 lb. of sliced Swiss Cheese. Spray the crock with cooking spray. I made two layers of each (in the order I've given). I prepared the night before the shindig and refrigerated so I could start cooking it at 8am. In the morning I cooked on high for 1/2-hour then turned to low for 4-hours. It was still warm at our destination 1-1/2 hours later and perfect for serving. A great hit! And soooo easy! A keeper for get-togethers!

Much faster and easier that making Reuben Sandwiches.  Was nicely surprised that my son enjoyed it.  A little dry, will add more dressing.

My husband and father really loved this! I did make some changes to it tho. I mixed the sauerkraut, corned beef, and the 1000 island dressing together in a bowl. I sprayed the pan w/Pam, put the mixture in the pan and spread the swiss cheese on top. Then I put the bread on top. I left the bread out for 8 hours so it got a little crusty. I covered the pan w/foil put in the oven for 20 minutes, take it out and put some more cheese on it then throw it back in the oven for another 10 minutes.

This was very quick and easy.  The only thing I did different was to put the corned beef on the bread before the sauerkraut.  This helped the bread from getting soggy.

AWESOME, EASY & QUICK dish! I love reuben sandwiches and this is just like it but quicker & easier. Everyone's taste are different..so next time I may add more cheese (only used 1 1/4 c..didn't have enough), I'd add a little more bread and a tad more dressing. It was a little too dry for me only because I use a ton of mayo on reg. sandwiches. I would highly recommend this recipe even if you don't like saurkraut!

My husband loves this recipe, thinks it ties for one of his all time favorites. I made it with the bread on the bottom one time, and I thought it tasted better. My husband preferred it without the bread on the bottom. So now we make a split plan to satisfy both of us.

This is awesome!!  Absolutely wonderful. If you like Reuben sandwiches--make this!! I wish I had made this years ago. I followed the recipe to a 'T'. I used sauerkraut in a bag (Boar's Head) because it is so much better than canned. Layered the sauerkraut on top of the cubed rye, corned beef on top of that, 1000 Island dressing and the swiss. So, so good! I had leftovers for lunch today and it was fabulous. A keeper.

This was a great dish!! Even my picky kids ate this!! I did take the advice of other reviewers and put the meat in first then sauerkraut, then dressing (I used Thousand Island), and then cheese, and finally the bread cubes. I had to use sliced Swiss cheese, as it was what I had on hand. It worked great!! I will definitely make this again!! Thanks for sharing!

This was EXCELLENT!! I did follow the suggestion of assembling in reverse order to avoid the soggy cust, I placed the corn beef on the bottom of a casserole dish sprayed with Pam followed by the sourekraut then the dressing and shredded swiss cheese on top then buttered bread cubes, I used pumpernickel bread. I baked in a 400 degree oven for 25 minutes and it was perfect.

What can I say, yummy.  Myself, my bf and his brother (who never tried kraut before) enjoyed it.  I toasted the bread as suggested in another review and layered it bread-meat-kraut-dressing-cheese.  I also didn't rinse the kraut, just squeezed out the excess brine. It turned out great.  The bread was a little dry and I think by adding just a bit of melted butter to the cubes next time would do the trick.

I love this recipe.  Very easy and fast to make.  I used pumpernickel bread instead of rye and I used thousand island dressing as well.  I used more dressing and more cheese also!  Loved it!!!!

I have made this recipe several times and each time I get rave reviews! I make this for the folks who come into our community center and have even double the amount I make to 50 servings. Folks always ask for seconds!  Thanks for this recipe. This is definitely a keeper.

I work full-time and needed a dish for a pot-luck dinner at church on a work night.  This recipe was excellent!  Fast, easy & tasty - it got rave reviews from the rest of the group.  It was a great change from the usual "lasagna" and "taco casserole" on the buffet.  I prepared all the ingredients the night before and just tossed them together and baked after work.  I liked the Russian dressing - just like the "original" Reuben sandwich!

This was the best - I HATE cooking, but hunger for something other than fast food drove me to start.  I tried the two layer suggestion with 1 & 1/2 cups of dressing with Mozz instead of Swiss and it was delish!  4 *easy* ingredients and I have a fantastic meal to last me all week.  Yum! Definitely keeping this recipe.

I only give it 4 stars b/c I modified the recipe as other users suggested.  I had the deli shave the corned beef and then I mixed it with the sauerkraut, 2 cups of Swiss, and a 16 oz. bottle of Thousand Island.  I spread that in the pan and then topped it with the Rye cubes and 2 more cups of Swiss (we're a cheese family.)  I thought it was great!  It didn't require as much work as assembling each sandwich and was easier for my 4 year old to eat.

PERFECT way to use up a leftover corned beef dinner. I replaced the sauerkraut with chopped cooked cabbage , then drizzled it with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Then everything else as written and it was SO good.

My husband and I both loved this. I'll definitely make this one again. It was great as is, but next time I might use a couple of pieces more bread and maybe half the sauerkraut just to suit my own taste.

This is so great! So simple! Ive passed this recipe on to many friends and family and they all love it. I used 1000 island dressing, because that's what Im used to, and my aunt added mustard instead of dressing, more like a hot pastrami, and it was wonderful too. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Great substitute for the sandwich!  Here are the changes I made thanks to other reviews . . . 1. I made half of the recipe since it was just me eating it - I used a 9X9 square glass pan and it was perfect! 2. The upside-down method worked really well - you spray the pan with cooking spray, add the meat, kraut, dressing, cheese, and THEN the bread. 3. The bread should be sprayed with cooking spray as well. I thought maybe tossing it with olive oil would have worked nicely too. Also, I roughly chopped up the meat to make it easier to scoop out of the pan later. 4. I used reduced-fat 1000 Island dressing and used a bit more than half since I like the flavor. 5. Season the bread with PEPPER and NO MORE salt!!! The corned beef and kraut are salty enough! 6. I baked for about 25 minutes uncovered and then served it with a crisp green vegetable :)  ***Addendum***  I have now made this recipe many times! 1. Tossed quite a few cubes of bread in olive oil and just threw them on top of the casserole.  The bread shrinks when it bakes so feel free to pile them on there. 2. I accidentally bought pastrami and it turned out just fine!

Awesome!!  The whole family loved it & it smelled so good while it was cooking.  I took the advice of others and toasted the bread in the oven while it was preheating and also placed the corned beef over the bread and then topped it with the sauerkraut.  The brad was not soggy at all!  Thanks for a great recipe & an easy way to make Reubens!

This was really delicious but I will tweak it a bit next time.  Instead of only one layer I will have two layers of bread, meat, kraut and extra dressing.  It was a bit dry so I recommend more dressing.  Other than that, this recipe is definately a keeper.

It was dry and not cohesive.  We added 1 c of water, used 1 1/2 c of thousand island instead, and mixed 1/2 the cheese into the casserole.  We mixed all the ingredients, with the exception of 1 c of cheese and spread it into a greased cake pan.  Then topped it with 1 c of cheese.  Making the changes I'd give it a 4-star, but know that I've had better.

We love this and have made several times.  I put the meat on the bottom, then sauerkraut, 1,000-island dressing, and top with bread cubes lightly tossed with melted butter.  I bake for about 15 minutes until the bread gets crispy, then add grated swiss and bake until the cheese melts.  I usually end by broiling the cheese for a minute or two.  Yummy.

I enjoyed this but next time would make a couple changes. First I would chop up the corned beef so it was easier to serve. Then I would not rinse the sauerkraut since I like that flavor. I did rinse it here and it was too bland for my taste. But I LOVE reubans so would make it again.

This was excellant and super easy.  I used lowfat 1,000 Island dressing and would have used lowfat cheese if the grocery store had it in stock.  But, the lowfat dressing did not compromise the taste all.

This is a keeper!  All you need to do to prevent this dish from becoming soggy is to thoroughly rinse and DRAIN the sauerkraut.  I use a wire mesh  colander and place it over a bowl for the kraut to drain while I fix the remaining ingredients.  I also layer in this order:  bread, meat, kraut, dressing, cheese.  It's perfect!  (I also like to use unsliced rye bread when I can find it.)

Absolutely fantastic!  This is my first review of a recipe, even though I use so many from this site. My hubby who "hates casseroles" loved this one. I used leftover corned beef and I can't wait to make it again!  I toasted the rye bread cubes first, and then followed the recipe as directed.

Very good, unbelievably easy.  I used pumpernickle bread and only 8 ounces of sauerkraut.  We don't like casseroles that have a soupy consistency, so this was fine as is.  The melted swiss on top was fabulous.

Expensive recipe...total cost for meal $16.11. Will need to adjust a few things next time, will toast the bread first and use more cheese, omit russian dressing (good flavor) but try 1000 island like the sandwich is served when eating out. teenage son did not care for daughter loved.

Very yummy! I made it the upside down way as one of the reviews recommended. I halved the recipe and i tossed the bread cubes in 3 tbs. melted butter.

This is really good!  However, I still prefer to just make the sandwiches.  And you can't beat homemade sauerkraut in this recipe if you can get your hands on some!

Making a sandwich is far better than turning the whole thing into a pile of slop.  Just make yourself a Reuben.  I thought this would be really great, but it's actually only just this side of edible.

This really does taste like a Reuben sandwich!  I subbed in thousand island dressing for the Russian style.  I did find myself missing having a sandwich though.  It was odd to eat this "taste" with a fork instead of in your hands.

A little dry - the next time I will use more salad dressing.  Also, there was not enough sauerkraut relative to the large amount of corn beef.

AWESOME! I used fresh corned beef (cooked for 2.5 hours) instead of deli sliced. It was fabulous. A great, easy meal. And if you use natural bread and dressing, it isn't unhealthy.

I have been making this for years and we love it! I spray my dish with cooking spray before layering the ingredients. Sometimes I'll layer everything on the bottom and toss the bread w/ a little melted butter and put them on top that way the bread gets nice and toasty. Just like the sandwich, only easier to assemble and cook! :)

Wow! If I could give more than 5* I would!!  When I took the leftovers to work for lunch the next day, people followed me around sniffing my lunch and begging for the recipe!!  Since my favorite part of the sandwich is the corned beef and sauerkraut, I put a layer of 1/2 the corned beef, then layer 1/2 the kraut, then repeat so they really get mixed together.  I also spray my rye cubed with butter spray so they crisp up with some flavor! What an awesome recipe!!!  I'm going to try it next in the crock pot for easy ready to eat dinner when I get home!

This was SOooooo good!  I have wanted to make a Reuben Casserole for years.  I read quite a few reviews and modified very little.  I had a large chunk of roast leftover so I upped the quantities.  I used 1# of bread, laid the slices out on a cookie sheet and put in the 400 oven for about 3 or so minutes until toasted.  Meanwhile I put a 32oz. jar of sauerkraut, drained but not rinsed, into the 9x13" casserole.  Hub did find Russian dressing (Wishbone at a Safeway) and poured the whole 16oz. bottle on the sauerkraut, mixed it up and spread it out.  Put the shredded corned beef over that then topped it with 2c. shredded Swiss.  Broke the toasted bread into pieces and spread them over the top.  It was fantastic, so easy and tasty BUT it was not very attractive with the bread on top so next time I'll take another 1-2c. shredded Swiss and put it on top.  Also, since the bread is on top, I might try to cut a step and try baking it before the bread layer for 15 min. then toasting torn up pieces at that point on top with the final cheese and bake for another 10 min. (always looking for the easiest way).  I baked it all uncovered with great results.  Thank you, it was worth the wait!!!

I hate to say it but I just didn't enjoy this like I thought I would.  We love reubens, and this sounded fantastic but it kind of fell short of my expectations.  It was a little dry despite the fact that I used more dressing than was called for.  My biggest complaint, however, was it's lack of "krautiness".  If I made this again I would use two cans.  As it was, I used one can, and did not rinse.

I did a family taste test & layed half according to the recipe, although I used thousand island dressing & didn't spray the aluminum foil with Pam.  The other half, I made with reviewer suggestions by spraying the pan with Pam 1st & then layering it with corned beef, sauerkraut, thousand island dressing, Swiss cheese & lightly toasted rye bread cubes on top (still with the aluminum foil on top).  They were both good but the preference was for the one with the bread cubes on top.  As my family doesn't like corned beef as much as I do, I'm going to try it as a turkey reuben casserole next.  I think this would be a good recipe for leftover Thanksgiving turkey too.

This seemed even better the next day, but it was exactly what I was looking for.  Satisfied my reuben craving.  Followed other reviewers advice and...
Sprayed casserole dish with "pam,"  spread the corned beef first then layer with the sauerkraut and salad dressing mixture, then swiss cheese.  Top it with bread, that has either been buttered or sprayed with "pam."  
When the rye bread topping is toasted, the casserole is done

Excellent !!!  After reading some of the reviews which said the bread was soggy, I decided to try something different. I had a loaf of light rye bread on hand, so that morning I cubed it and layered it on a large cookie sheet, then just put it in the oven (not turned on of course) all day to dry out a bit.  That evening I put a layer of the bread cubes in a large baking pan sprayed with "pam", then half of the kraut, corned beef & cheese. I spread some homemade thousand isle over that and then repeated the layers. I had a few bread cubes left, so I put them over top and sprayed them with "pam".  I baked it, covered with foil at 350 for 30 min. , then uncovered for an additional 10 min. It was awesome, it had a great texture and was very filling. We had a lot left over, so I'm going to try freezing it in single portion sizes for work lunches. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is one of my husbands favorite dishes.  Go figure, it's probably one of the easiest and least time consuming recipes I have! I make it as is, with another reviewers suggestion to put the dish with the bread in the oven while it's preheating. I also add some mustard to the 1000 Island dressing, to tone down some of the sweetness.

This recipe was ok.  It turned out just fine and we ate it, but it is not as good as the original sandwich, which I love.  Maybe it was the texture, but next time, I'll just make the sandwiches.

Everyone loved this recipe. I used Thousand Island because I could not find Russian in the store. I switched the layers so the sauerkraut was on the bottom and bread cubes on top.

Good flavors but make sure you rinse the sauerkraut well to get rid of the salt. I layered it different than the recipe states but otherwise didn't change the recipe. I put the kraut on the bottom, then corned beef and dressing, then cheese and topped with rye bread crumbs. I processed the bread in my food processer and sprinkled on the top so they toast by themselves. I melted 2 tablespoons of butter and drizzled on the bread crumbs. Nice way to make reubens.

This was great. I toasted the bread before cubing as I can't stand soggy bread, used leftover corn beef, and 1000 island dressing. I also used the renolds release foil so I didn't have to spray anything. Anyhow- it was great. Hubby told me three times how much he liked it. That is a big deal for him!

I love Reuben sandwiches, and this recipe was great.  I like my sandwiches with a lot of thousand island dressing so I used quite a bit more than called for and I also put it under the broil just until the cheese started to brown.  Tasted great, thanks!

My family, especially my husband, loved this casserole!  It had just the right ruben flavor.  I changed the recipe a little by putting bread cubes on top and bottom of the casserole, but next time I would only put them on top.  There seemed to be too much bread with both.  Other than that, this recipe was a smashing hit.  My husband requested it at least once a week.

This is a treat and it got raves from my husband.  I had about half a loaf of the small cocktail size pumpernickel rye left over from another use. I used that and layered all in a rectangular 3 qt. casserole dish lined with the non-stick foil. I broke the bread squares in half. Bread, beef, cheese, sauerkraut, dressing, repeat, and then end with a little more bread.  I used a scant cup of thousand island dressing, about 10 oz. of sliced cheese cut in strips, and about 1/2 lb. of beef. I also put a little melted butter on the bread layers.  I didn't use the full 16 oz. of sauerkraut but I think it would have been as good if I had gone ahead and used it all. 

Cooked covered with a glass lid for 30 minutes and then uncovered and added final layer of cheese and cooked 10 more minutes. 

This is a perfect recipe for taking the ingredients and "eyeballing" it to your own satisfaction.

Delicious! I followed some other suggestions by using Thousand Island dressing, and putting the corned beef on top of the bread… then sauerkraut. I can’t wait to make it again! Thanks, Monica!

This was good and easy based on a few changes.  I too toasted the bread (dark rye) in olive oil.  I used Bavarian sweet sauerkraut,1000 Island Dressing and shredded swiss cheese.  3/4 lb of meat was plenty.

This is a great recipe! I take it to potlucks in March and everyone wants the recipe.  I do have one problem.   The bread really sticks to the bottom of the baking dish.   Next time I will remember to grease the dish and hope tha helps.   I also us 1000 Island Dressing instead of Russian Dressing which is difficult to find here.

Didn't use as much corned beef - used closer to 1/2 lb and there was still a lot.  Also used low fat dressing and I did toast the bread before layering and it turned out pretty good.

I am REALLY shocked after making this - especially because everyone else loved it.  My husband (who LOVES Reubens) didn't like it - and he likes ANY thing with meat and cheese.  This is the ONLY recipe on this site that ever turned out strange for me.  Obviously, it tasted like a reuben, minus the slices of bread.  The bread cubes were really weird, so we ended up picking them out. The reuben casserole might be too much of a stretch for traditional Reuben lovers.  Since there are leftovers, we're going to just use everything BUT the bread cubes for regular sandwiches.

Even my dh who hates saurkraut liked this dish. I toasted my bread beforehand as suggested by previous raters and it wasn't mushy at all. I finished off the leftovers the next day and they were just as good as the day before.

My boyfriend can't cook at all.  I was looking for a simple recipe that he could make, but that would still produce an outcome that would be proud of.  This was FANTASTIC.  I love Reubens.  I can't wait to have this again.  This has officially become one of "his" recipes.

Update... My boyfriend has made this recipe 2x since my original review, and it is still great.  We use 1000 island as the dressing.  One reviewer said that pasta made it dry.  What pasta?

Great casserole! It really tasted alot like a reuben sandwich.  I substituted Pumpernickel, that I put on the top of my casserole so the bread wouldnt be mushy, then sprinkled some shredded mozzarella on top.  I cubed some swiss cheese with the meat, sauerkraut and dressing and mixed it together rather than layering. I like an even mixture and this turned out great. I used about a half bottle of 1000 island dressing too. Thanks for the great recipe !

With a little bit of variation, this turned out to be a really good dish! I layered the saurkraut, corned beef and Thousand Island dressing.

WOW! This is one of the best things I ever made!  Like others suggested, I toasted the bread first.  I put four cubed slices on the bottom of a small oval casserole dish.  I layered it with thin slices of deli corned beef, a mixture of saurkraut (sp?) and Russian dressing, slices of Swiss cheese, and then repeated all the layers again.  I used an 8oz. bottle of dressing and a 14 oz. can of saurkraut.  I then followed the cooking time and temperature.  I will definately make this again!

We used pastrami (no leftover corned beef) and followed other reviews in toasting the bread.  Will layer some bread on the bottom and some on the top the next time.  Quick and easy.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! It had great flavor and it was so easy to make.  
I cut the Rye bread into larger chunks so they really had a nice chewy/crunchy texture.  I also added  extra 1000 island dressing, but cut the sauerkraut in half.
Definitely a keeper!
Thank you so much for a great meal.

I thought this recipe was good, but not as good as I expected.  Taking the advice of other reviewers, I also used Thousand Island dressing and added extra.  I added a layer of toasted Rye Bread cubes on the top too, and then sprinkled the cheese on.  This worked great, as the top layer was nice and crunchy.  Next time, I would eliminate the bottom layer altogether.  Even with toasted bread, the bottom was just too soggy for me.

YUMMY!!  I have been a long-time lover of reuben sanwiches and this dish did not disappoint!  It was the perfect blend of ingredients and was so flavorful!  I did substitute 1000 Island dressing for the Russian.  I will most definitely make this as often as possible.

We really liked this casserole, even my 2 year old son!  I cannot have any refined sugar, so I used a sugarfree, calorie free Russian dressing, and it was still great!  I will definitely be making this one again!

This is so good- it's one of my husband's favorite meals.  It is so easy to put together.  The only negative is that it doesn't taste as good reheated the next day- the bread gets too soggy.

Super easy.  I made my own russian dressing, but could have made it even easier by buying a bottle.  This recipe was devoured by my family.  My 10 yr old wanted 3 servings! This will be my "go to" for next St. Paddy's day and whenever we are in the mood for a Rueben.  I put the bread cubes in my stoneware pan while I pre-heated the oven and it made them slightly crunchy - great.  I may have not made enough dressing because I felt it could have used a touch more.

I used a creamy russian dressing recipe I found on this site and I was quite fond of the dish as a whole. However, the hubby wasn't too impressed. He said it didn't taste too much like a rueben to him so I would recommend using more sauerkraut than the recipe calls for so it tastes more authentic.

This was a nice change for our family's supper.  Quick & easy.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I layered it upside down as another reviewer suggested, which made for a nice crusty top.  I used both light rye and pumpernickel bread.  Will definitely be making this again soon.  Unfortunately, I forgot to take a photo before it was all eaten up.  Thanks for submitting!

I followed the recipe to the letter. The bread was so soggy on the bottom it was just gross. With corned beef at $8.00 a pound, I won't make this again.

My husband loved this. I baked the crumbs first like I read in other ratings. It is a keeper. The only problem will be trying to find corn beef when it isn't in season. Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

Did not have sliced deli meat.  So we used a can of corn beef instead.  I turned out yummy.  I enjoyed how the rye bread was able to crisp in the bottom.  I was sure it would get soggy, but it didn't.  I also forgot to cover the casserole in foil while it cooked.  It still turned out great.

I'm not very impressed at all with this recipe.  I served it at a holiday gathering and although it seemed well recieved, I found it to be too mushy even though I toasted the bread first.  Flavor was just OK.  I won't be making this one again.

This recipe is exactly like the one I use to make this casserole at home, and I find it to be one of the quickest meals I can throw together.  Instead of putting the cheese on top, I instead butter the tops of the slices of marble rye, and place the cheese under it.  The rye crisps up and gives a nice presentation, the cheese melts into the casserole, and I don't have to do anything with it while it bakes - I essentially pop it in for 30 minutes and I'm done.

We prepared this recipe for an Oktoberfest celebration and everyone who tried it loved it. One lady came back to tell the chef that it was the best thing she had ever eaten in her life! My husband tried a sample of it that I took home & told me to ask our chef if he would consider marrying him. It will definitely be back on our menus here at the retirement community where I work....& it will be on our home menus, too! Great recipe!

I thought this recipe was wonderful, i followed the instructions to a T except i did not "cube" the bread, i left it at whole slices. i also TOASTED the bread. a must!! and i put another layer of toast on the top. it made the whole thing very crispy and crunchy. i will absolutely make this easy recipe again and again.

My husband loves Reuben Sandwiches ... this is a great alternative and a good way to use that leftover corned beef. There are only two of us so next time I'll make half a recipe. I toasted the bread first as others suggested ... good choice. It would be helpful to have a measurement for the amount of bread instead of number of slices since bread varies in size.  I used 5 large slices of dark rye bread and it was way too much bread for the rest of the ingredients.

This was very good. I cut the recipe in half, and used homemade Thousand Island dressing instead of Russian. I also toasted the rye bread cubes on the stovetop, per previous reviews. I also used Reynold's Release, instead of coating foil with non-stick pan spray. It had good flavor, smelled great, and was very comforting on a late fall evening.

What's not to like?  I won't rinse the kraut next time because the bread cubes were a little dry.  You can't really make a reuben 'healthy', but I tried to lighten it up a little by using about half of the corned beef called for in the recipe & tried lite dressing.  Still really good!

This recipe is wonderful - - - -  and oh so easy!!  I used a sweet bavarian sauerkraut (in a jar), and about 12 oz. of sliced baby swiss cheese, as I couldn't find shredded in my grocery store.  It was so good!!!!! I was hesitant to make this at first, but I am so glad that I did it!

Thank you Monica!  My husband and I thought this was very good. I forgot to check the reviews before I made it, but I used Thousand Island dressing anyway! And I must have drained the saurkraut enough because it definitely was not soggy.  All in all, I must say, it was quite tasty! I think the heat has a way of blending of the tastes together. You gave life to an old sandwich! I will definitely make this again, my husband (who is the primary cooker of the family) REALLY enjoyed this. My daughter, who will be 5, didn't have as much enthusiasm, though. She picked on the corned beef before I made the casserole. After reading the reviews, I'm thinking this is not a "kiddie" kind of meal, maybe if I use hotdogs...hmmmm.

I had great luck with this recipe. Combining some other cooks suggestions and a couple of my own, here is how I prepared it. I put the bread cubes in an 11x7 pan and put the pan in a cold oven and while it heated to 400 it allowed the bread to toast a bit.(I stirred the cubes half way through the heating) I used left-over corned beef that I cubed and sprinkled over the bread, then I mixed one cup of dressing with the sauerkraut(well drained is important) and spread over the corned beef. Finished off per recipe. My family loved it. A keeper in our house.

Love this recipe especially the day after St. Patrick's. Read several reviews and the tips were very helpful. I toasted the bread and cut into cubes. Layered the bottom of a sprayed 9 X 13. Mixed all the remaining ingredients with 1/2 of the cheese. Made it easier to assemble than layers. Put the mixture on top of the cubes and baked per the original recipe.  Topped with the other 1/2 of the cheese for the last 10-15 minutes. Let it sit for 10 minutes before cutting so it stays together.

Expensive but looks ten times better than the originals picture.

Used shredded saurkraut that comes in a bag.
Used store brand thousand island-used 1 cup.
Used rye swirl bread- 6 pieces cubed on bottom, 4 slices cubed on top.

Sprayed pam on bottom of casserole. Layered bread, saurkraut, dressing,cheese, then bread. Sprayed pam on top bread layer. Sprayed pam on foil side down. Covered dish and baked at 400 for 30-35 minutes. 

Was a hit!

I love this recipe.  I used 1000 Island instead of Russian because Russian sounded too sweet and 1000 Island is what they normally use on the sandwich.  If you like Reubens, you'll love this.

Added extra sauce, less meat, toasted the bread, and this was delicious. This did almost taste exactly like the sandwich. Especially nice if you have young kids; you can just make this up quick and then throw it in the oven whenever you want.

Wife loves this recipe. We just use pastrami, personal preference over corned beef, and cut down on the dressing as it can get pretty soggy. The toasted rye on top is excellent and the wife requests this often.

Made this for Dinner tonight I buttered the bottom and sides of my baking dish and it gave a nice crunch to the bread cubes. Super easy and quick to make.

Great recipet if you like the sandwich.  Like a lot of people, I made little croutons out of the marble rye bread, put those on the bottom with sliced swiss cheese (to form a "barrier" so the bread doesn't get soggy) then topped with meat, the sauerkraut, and dressing, then repeated the layers, ending with bread croutons. I personally prefer a rueben made with pastrami, so I used high-quality deli meat, cut into smaller peices, and LOVED it.   I've also made it with leftovers from a corned beef brisket roast.  Either way is good.   Easier to eat than a sandwich, and BTW, leftovers are just fine in the microwave if you make an effort to not put the wet ingredients directly on top of the bread.

We liked this a lot and it used up the remainder of my corned beef from St. Patrick's Day (I always cook a round instead of brisket so it's a LOT leaner).  I didn't change a thing.  My grocery store offered dark rye, light rye, Jewish rye and Russian rye so I opted for the Russian rye because of the Russian salad dressing--ha!  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

My mom had a can (12 oz) of corned beef, a 16-oz can of Bavarian kraut, and 6 thick slices of bakery rye bread to use up, so I used that the first time I made it. It was very good, but it's even better with real deli corned beef. I use a couple more slices of the regular thin rye. It makes great leftovers to heat in the microwave. You can serve thousand island dressing on the table for those who like more (I don't, personally, but have family members who do).

When I made this casserole, I made a homemade russian salad dressing (a recipe and a half), then I layered the corned beef, sauerkraut and cheese with s little of the salad dressing in between each layer. I used homemade rye bread crumbs on the top and drizzled butter over the crumbs. The whole family loved it! I'm going to make this again really soon.

The whole family liked this!  I scaled the serving size to 4 and made in a 9x 13 baking dish. I also made this upside-down, putting the corn beef on the bottom.  I used the full can of kraut and an 8 oz bottle of low fat thousand island plus 1/2 lb of sliced Swiss cheese. I placed the slices (not cubes) of rye bread on top and sprayed with butter spray.  I followed the cooking directions and the bread got nice and toasty.

This was pretty good.  Here is how I did it based on other reviews.  I decided to layer it as others did, but taking in to account that others felt the need to add more dressing (which I also used 1000 isle) I wanted to  make sure the dressing was evenly distributed so I decided to mix the kraut, cut up CB, and the dressing in a bowl.  Then I put this mixture into the Pam sprayed pan.  (I also forgot to rinse the kraut which I would highly recommend)  I cubed the rye bread for the top, and tossed it with squeezable butter.  Didn’t look like enough bread, so I did 3 more slices the same way and put the butter-cubed bread on top.  I did just a hit & miss of Pam Butter spray also once the bread was in the pan.  I sprayed the foil too, but didn’t need to as my ingredients didn’t touch it.  Once it baked for 20 minutes and I removed the foil, the bread wasn’t very toasty, so I baked an additional 5 minutes uncovered.  Then I topped with thin sliced Swiss cheese, 8 slices.  We  enjoyed it very much.  The kids wouldn’t go near it, but I will fix it again for DH and myself.

this was very good.  I didn't use tangy enough sauerkraut for my tastes so next time I will make sure I do.  Also I think cottage cheese would be good so I am going to try that next time too.  Overall this was GREAT!

I made this to use up our St. Pat's corned beef.  I chopped the corned beef, and used pumpernickel and thousand island.  This recipe makes a huge amount--I just eyeballed it and made enough to use up my leftovers, certainly not a pound each of meat and kraut.  I never thought of making a casserole out of a sandwich!  It was pretty good!

This is one of the tastiest casseroles I have ever made!  Follow the suggestions and layer the casserole backwards - it cooks so much better.  I am always looking for casseroles to make as hubby works nights in the ER and has to bring a quick and easy dinner - he loves this one!

This was very good. I like how it tastes like a Reuben, yet is much less messy. I did cut up the corn beef into smaller, bite size pieces, for ease of consuming and used Thousand Island dressing vs Russian. Hubby LOVED it and so did I. Great leftovers too. This one is now in my recipe box.

If you like Reubens, you will LOVE this!  We will be making this as one of our regulars, even the kids liked it.  I'm going to bring a pan of it to a function at work, so I'm going to double the recipe and relayer it twice.  Thanks!

I more or less halved the recipe (used a 6 oz. package of sliced corned beef).  It was pretty good but didn't quite have the Reuben taste I was hoping for--that I blame on my home-made Russian dressing.  I'll probably use 1000 Island next time unless I can find a creamy Russian.  I followed the recipe and the bread cubes were soft but not mushy with a few crisp bits.  I squeezed the kraut to get out excess water after rinsing and used seriously stale rye bread!  My husband isn't a fan of sauerkraut, but he pronounced it good.

I put the casserole together the night before so I inverted the recipe (the bread was on top).  I used leftover Guinness Corned Beef and Cottage Cheese Bread I which is really dense and both recipes are from this site.  I also used Thousand Island Dressing vs. Russian.  This is much better than the corned beef/noodle recipes.  I would first use the leftovers for a sandwich, then this recipe and the last resort would be a noodle recipes.

I made this with the leftover corned beef from St Paddy's Day last Tuesday - good way to use those left-overs, after you have had them a couple nights already.  Used the "Russian Style Creamy Dressing" from this site, and toasted the bread cubes before-hand.  Made a layer of bread cubes, saurkraut, beef, dressing, and second layer of cubes.  Added the cheese after the first 20 minutes of cooking.  I love reuben sandwiches, but now I love this even better - don't have to worry about it falling apart when you try to eat it, and it seemed a little less fatty, since no butter/margarine was used to grill the sandwich.  Thanks for another great addition to the recipe box!

I made this last night. My husband and I both enjoy reubens so thought it would be a good dish. My husband did not like it at all, the sourkraute was way to overpowering for him. Maybe if I had used only half the amount of the kraute it would have been better. Not sure if I'll ever try this again with a few tweeks.

I had to use pastrami because the store didn't have corned beef. I used more thousand island dressing then called for after reading other reviews,next time I am going to use the amount called for,because it would have been perfect. This is a quick and easy very good meal. I don't have alot of time to cook but its hard to find good fast dishes this is definitional one of them! My husband and I both liked it and I think with the amount of dressing called for we would have loved it! Will make again!

Hubby liked this, but I didn't care much for it, and our 2-year-old just picked at it. Perhaps if I were more a fan of the Reuben sandwich, I would have found this casserole more appealing. But I found it greasy and too tart, and I followed the recipe to a T. Maybe better with a different type of dressing? Probably won't make this again.

Absolutely fantastic.  I substituted Thousand Island dressing.  Other than that - followed the recipe exactly.  Easy to freeze the leftovers.

Yum!!  I used 1,000 Island dressing instead of Russian and followed other reviewer's advice on topping the casserole with rye as well as lining the bottom.  It's not the prettiest dish in the world, but it tastes GREAT!!!

Followed the recipe almost to a T.  It was pretty good although my kids weren't too thrilled with it.  My husband really liked it but thought it needed some mustard.  I toasted some rye bread cubes and topped the casserole with them so it wouldn't be so soggy.  Turn out good. Super simple to make.  Not sure I would make it again since the kids wouldn't eat it.  I did find it a tiny bit salty.  Not sure why.  I forgot to rinse the sauerkraut.  Not sure if that had anything to do with it.

this recipe was awesome!! My husband and I loved it. The only thing i did different was use thousand island dressing instead of the russian style and i also used way more than what the recipe called for. So if you make this recipe make sure you use more than 3/4 cup.

The rye bread became soggy and ruined the casserole.  I wish I would have read the review that suggested toasting the bread first.  That might have made it better.

I'm lukewarm on this recipe.  Mostly, I'm turned off by the rye bread cubes.  They stayed dry and never soaked anything up, nor crisped.  Maybe it would be better if the rye cubes were made into croutons first, sauteed until crisp and thrown on top, instead of on bottom?  It's just too dry for a casserole, I think.

Keeper! In response to another review, I had my boyfriend rinse the sour kraut before I got home so it would have time to dry. However, he may have rinsed it out too much because we missed the sour in the kraut which ended up making the corned beef quite dominating. Reviews indicated that alot of people chose 1000 Island over Russian, so I split an inmaginary line down the middle of my pan in order see for ourselves. We both agreed that the best part was the part that had both dressings on it.  I toasted the bread first w/PAM in the preheating oven to prevent sogginess, but when I layered the casserole, I didn't quite cover a bit of the bread around the edges which left me with a couple of bites that were hard as a rock!

This recipe was ok, but not great.  The pasta made it dry, even though I added the juice from the saurkraut as extra.  I may try it again with some changes, because my hubby sort of liked it.  I think it has potential with a few changes, mostly the moisture.

OK, but we would rather have an actual Reuben sandwich, as long it we have all the ingredients anyway. Also prefer Thousand Island to Russian dressing for Reuben stuff.

We LOVE reubens but I must have done something wrong with this recipe.   Maybe my bread wasn't really good NY rye...it's hard to get here in Tennesse! I wouldn't toast it again if I made this again.  I think I also overdid the 1000 island dressing and it was too much.      My husband ate it and said it was ok, even took it to work the next day, but it isn't my favorite recipe this time around.   Sorry.  We are trying the chicken reuben tonight...I'll have to rate that one after we try it!

Really good!  And quick and easy to prepare.  If you like Reuben sandwiches, you've got to try this.  I did use the fresh, bagged sauerkraut rather than canned, though.  And also leftover corned beef rather than deli corned beef.  I'm sure it would be good with the deli corned beef, too.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and put the bread crumbs on top.  It was delicious that first night when it came out of the oven!  I used hot Mr. Mustard as a side-sauce.  However, this was way too expensive.  The meat alone costs $7.50!

I did not like this dish very much and neither did my husband.  He just ate the corned beef and pushed aside the mushy bread. The taste of the Rye bread is very overwelming, maybe better with sourdough.

I liked it very much, but I think the idea of toasting the bread would make it better.  I used low fat cheese, and lean corned beef - and it tasted just fine.  I also added mushrooms and green onion - it added some filler and tasted great.

This is delicious! My husband asked why we’ve never made it before!!!
For Vegetarians:  I made  1/2 of the dish vegetarian by replacing the corned beef  with fresh spinach and little diced onion, then followed recipe exactly.
The other half was made with corned beef exactly as stated.
I did toast the bread cubes in the oven while it was preheating as suggested by another reviewer.
 It was delicious.
THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR DELICIOUS RECIPE!!!

I loved this casserole.  I spread sauerkraut on bottom,  put layer of torn up deli corned beef (1/2 lb), and layered half and half mayo and chili sauce with sweet pickle relish for dressing and baked for 20 min.  Then the last 10 minutes I put toasted cubed rye bread and Swiss cheese over top.

great recipe so glad I forked out the cash. accidentally bought bavarian souerkraut which I wasn't too stoked on so I even had to go back to the store . . so worth it tho.

helpful tips: 4oz swiss cheese is grated into 2 cups.
2x cheese and 1.5x dressing.
toast bread beforehand for 15 min at 350F.
layered with bread, meat, souerkraut, dressing then swiss cheese; then repeated once.

next time: asiago bread and rye

My husband loves Reuben sandwiches, hard to find around here.  I on the other do not like sauerkrat....but...made this up, except...    1)  did not use bread, used tortilla to roll ingredients into , saved cheese  for top   2)cooked about 15 min   3) topped with cheese and cooked another 5-10m
We both thought it was good, will make again.

Perfect!  I did use real corned beef...I used the slow cooker and once it was done I followed the recipe exactly.  I did drain the sauerkraut and found the bread did not get mushy at all.  I would make again and I liked using the real corned beef!

Made this for the first time for a potluck and received rave reviews! Even noticed a few going back for seconds. I did use thousand island dressing and about 1/4 pound more meat. My husband loves it too. Definitely will make this again.

Was good but I think I will try it with Thousand Island dressing next time. I used Marble Rye bread from the bakery and it worked really well. I also used a packaged corn beef brisket that I cooked on the stove and then broke apart for in the recipe.

This is not a cheap dish, but it was easy and tasted great .  I did toast torn-up bread first, and probably used 1 cup of dressing. 
As good or better as leftovers.  Loved it!

THIS recipe was just ok, made it once before following this to the T. Made it today with some tweaks and it was perfection. Used marbled rye, toasted in the oven first, I doubled the dressing and used thousand island. Didnt rinse the sauerkraut, and used 20 oz canned drained really well. Also added a bit of spicey brown mustard. Its extremely filling, and would have been quick to make if I didnt have to shred the swiss myself (thanks walmart smh). Hubby and our 1, 2, and 6 year old girls devoured it.

Made this..,. And it came out delicious.  I did toast the bread first and butter the bottom of the pan.  I also layered the meat, sauerkraut, dressing twice with a layer cheese in the middle.  This came out perfect.  Better than making the sandwiches individually.  Will placed this recipe in the cookbook of favorites for the family.

This recipe was a definite  hit!  I was concerned about all the reviews about soggy bread, but I had absolutely no problems. I did follow a few of the tweaks others had posted. I diced up the loaf of marbled rye bread (My husband had me leave him a couple of slices so he could make a sandwich while waiting for dinner ??) and let it sit in the pan to air dry (like stuffing). When putting together the casserole, I layered the bread in the bottom of the baking dish thick enough where I couldn’t see the dish through it, reserving some for the top of the casserole.  I spread on half of the meat (I had cut a heavy pound into bite sized strips) on the bread, then half of the pint of drained & squeezed sauerkraut,  then evenly spread/ parred on a heavy half cup of thousand island dressing (probably around 2/3), then 1-1 1/2c of cheese. I then spread  on the rest of the meat, sauerkraut, and dressing (same amounts as the first layer).   I sprinkled the remaining bread on the top of the casserole, covered, and baked as directed, including removing foil and adding/baking the 2 C. of Swiss cheese. It came out perfectly.  Served with dill pickles, garlic rounds w/cheese dip, and coleslaw, it was a great meal. I wondered about adding  a bit more dressing next time, but my husband vetoed it. My sister in law said maybe so. I decided to make it exactly this way in the future and just putting a little pitcher of more dressing on the table for those who want it saucier.  I was asked for the re

I love Reubens! This was terrific. I make my own rye bread and thousand island dressing (FYI, known as Russian dressing in some parts of the US.) I used leftover corned beef, toasted the rye bread, and made two layers of everything in my Ninja slow cooker, 3 hours on low, 1/2 hour on high. It definitely needed more dressing but that didn't detract from the taste. Next time I won't drain the sauerkraut so well.

I reversed order of casserole items to avoid soggy bread. However simple croutons would have made the trick.  For this dish, rye bread does nothing for recipe so save time & money by using croutons.  While it tasted good, if you want a Reuben, go make a sandwich.

This was so so good!!!  The only changes I made were extra swiss and extra thousand islands, also I put the bread on the top and brushed it with butter.  Thanks to all the reviewers tips. 
 Turned out perfect and I will never make this the normal way again!!

My family liked this casserole but it was better with a few changes.  We added a bag of egg noodles and and a full bottle of thousand island dressing to the mix. We did not add the bread to the bottom, but rather toasted it in the toaster, then made crumbs in the food processor.  We added some butter and sprinkled the bread mixture over the top.  It ends up being a nice hearty casserole!

Make sure your deli corned beef is  lean, there is nothing worse than biting into fat and gristle. I have them chip it and then I cut it up in smaller pieces and mix it with my sauerkraut and thousand Island dressing and put in a casserole dish sprayed with Pam. on top of that I add shredded Swiss cheese. I cut my Rye bread into crouton size pieces ,toast them in the oven and cover the casserole with them, drizzling them with a little bit of melted butter. Cover with foil bake, then right   before it is done cooking I sprinkle with a little bit more Swiss cheese and bake until it is melted.

I would make this again.  I did add more sauerkraut , just drained but didn't rinse it.  I also used Thousand Island and more than it called for.

The only thing I did differently from the original recipe was that I didn't rinse the sauerkraut.  It's a quick and easy recipe that tastes just like a Reuben sandwich. My husband and I both loved it and I'll be making it again.

We loved it! I did make changes, though. I mixed it all in a bowl and then put it into the casserole dish. I also used a mixture of pastrami and corned beef, and I buttered the bread before I cubed it. ;) We are making this again next week for Super Bowl Sunday.

Flavors were good. Just not what we expected.  Used Thousand Island dressing.  Expensive to make also. Will keep in my favorite list and try it again.

Yes! Making this for the 3rd time. I use good quality deli corned beef & toss some thin dill pickle strips on that layer. I added a sprinkle of the sauerkraut juice & a little brown mustard to the dressing (a personal preference). Ground up caraway seeds skattered on the rye kicks up the flavor. The swiss can be sliced & cut into strips if you like.  You can make ahead, storing without the dressing for a few hours - adding before baking & addition of cheese. It does NOT disappoint real reuben lovers!

I toasted the cubed rye bread (nearly a loaf), used TI dressing (about 14 oz) and used pastrami instead of corned beef. I layered the ingredients (2 layers) - rye, kraut, pastrami, TI dressing, and Swiss cheese. It turned out wonderful!

This recipe was really good. My husband thought it could use a little more dressing,  so I'll probably do that next time. We substituted pastrami for the corned beef because hubby doesn't like corned beef. It was tasty with the added bonus of being quick and easy to assemble.

I have made this with my St. Patty's Day leftovers which included potatoes and cabbage. I follow the recipe with the following changes. For the rye bread, I butter and cube wheat bread and toast it in a pan with caraway seeds and garlic. I drain but do not rinse the sauerkraut. I'm sure I use more than a cup of Russian dressing. My version of Russian dressing is ketchup, mayo, vineger, sugar, garlic and hot sauce. It's a wonderful caserole.

My husband liked this. I did the upside down thing to have the crispy bread on top! I used pumpernickel bread. I also used the thousand island dressing. Added more sauerkraut & cheese. I am not crazy about  the meat but my husband loves meat. I got nice lean slices from the deli & cut them in strips. Not too thin slices. It is a nice change of menu & is easy with easy clean up! Be sure to drain the sauerkraut or it will be soupy.

Try cutting the bread cubes in 1\4 to1/2 cubes. Then toast on a sheet pan . Place toasted cubes on bottom of casserole. This give more stability. Also you could try melting  a thin layer of sliced Swiss over the cubes to form a moisture barrier. Layer.(...BE SURE SOURKRAUT IS VERY WLL DRAINED.)

This was outstanding. My boys and husband loved it. The only difference, in the way I made it, was I used crockpot corned beef, thousand island dressing, half provolone and half Swiss cheese. (Because sometimes Swiss cheese can over power the other flavor's.)

Very rich! Very good. Shredded left over St Paddy days corn beef, added half again as much sauerkraut, doubled the cheese,  toasted the cubed bread crumbs and increased the  Russian dressing to a cup (drizzled even more on top).  Mixed all together and placed in crock pot on low for a couple hours. Yummy!

I have never had such mixed feelings about a food. When I first took it out of the oven bites that had a small amount of sauerkraut were amazing. Yet there were some bites with way too much (my own fault) which were horrible. 
I will likely make it again, but with half the amount of sauerkraut and more dressing.
Tip: I toasted my bread and dried my sauerkraut and did not have soggy bread.

I made this exactly as recipe states.  I think it was ok, but not nearly as good as the sandwich itself.  In fact, given the ingredients, I think I'd rather make the sandwich next time, only I would have used thousand island dressing.

This was excellent.  Reubens are one of my favorite sandwiches, so this was nice to have something a little different for dinner.  

The only thing I did different was melted butter and tossed the bread crumbs in it, the put them on top to get crispy.  So good!!

This was just like a Reuben.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and inverted the casserole so the bread was on top and the meat on the bottom.  Make sure to bake long enough so the bread stays toasted (a little toasting won't do it or it will get soggy faster).  I will make this again. It is easy, quick and good.

I made this for The first time today, I took the advice of another reviewer and toasted the bread in fear that the bread would be soggy. I drained the sourkrout with no reserve. I assembled as directed and found it was a bit dry, I think it needed some juice from the sourkrout (maybe) it was good everyone liked it.. It was just short of something. I think it's a fun recipe and I would try to make it again, and maybe follow another's reviewer and make it in reverse order?.

We Loved it! Made it in the Crock Pot for 5 hours on low, and layered it like lasagna. Toast (cut to fit), meat, Kraut, cheese, 1,000 Island dressing, repeat. I did rinse and drain the kraut. It turned out great, and is going on our make again list.

Very easy, very good! The one thing that I changed, was that i put the bread on the TOP (on top of the cheese) rather than the bottom. The bread cubes got a little bit toasted, and wrer similar to croutons! Also, I had the dressing on the side.

This is a good recipe, and one which is easily tweaked to conform to your personal notion of what a Reuben should be.

I tried it with the Russian dressing (Wishbone red) and that was good.  I've always known a Reuben to have Thousand Islands, and I'll try that next time.

Corned beef is not always readily available in the deli, and pastrami can make a good substitute.  In a pinch, my guess is that cutting up hot dogs would work, and might help those who find that this recipe is expensive (I didn't think it was all that expensive).

I did toast the bread cubes and drained and pressed the kraut (but did not rinse, that would be a mistake!).  Next time I will use less cheese and dressing, and more kraut, to suit my tastes.  I think it is too rich with all the cheese and dressing, but then this wasn't meant to be a health food recipe.

This is very good and something that I had many years ago.  I was happy to come across this recipe here and it was just as good as the one I had growing up.

If you love Reubens, you're going to really like this casserole.  My kids didn't love it, but they don't like Reubens either.  I thought this was delicious!  Yum!

This was great!  It was so EASY!  I think it could have used JUST a little less cheese - and I used the 1000 Island as suggested.

Loved this-I used pumpernickel instead, as I prefer it ovver rye, and it was great.  This could definitely be served as an appetizer too.

I used the thousand island dressing also and we LOVED it.  I'll try it with Russian dressing next time.  Either way, this is a keeper.

This recipe was ok.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and layered the toasted rye bread on top (just under the cheese).  It was flavorful, but quite dry.  I served extra thousand island dressing on the side.  I had 3 adults and 5 children for dinner.  The adults thought it was ok, but none of the kids (5 to 1 year old) would really touch anything but the corned beef.  I will probably try it again although I would only put sauerkraut in half the dish (for adults) and add more corned beef.

I followed other rater's advice of putting the bread cubes on the top, then adding the cheese at the end as directed in the recipe.  My dh loved it, my kids weren't as thrilled.  I liked it and reuben is not one of my favorites.  Will make it again.

Everybody LOVED this recipe, except my 2 year old, but I"m sure most young kids don't like sauerkraut. I toasted the bread first, and did two layers in a 2 qt casserole dish, including the cheese and baking about 1/2 hour. My husband added horseradish to his. We will definitely have this again when corned beef goes on sale.

What a great way to use leftovers! I did as another reviewer suggested, and layered this upside down.  I will make this again.  Thanks Monica!
