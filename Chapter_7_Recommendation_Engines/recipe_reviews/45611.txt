Hi, I posted this recipe...just wanted to add, I use WishBone Italian dressing and also black beans which can substitute for the black-eyed peas (I usually do one of each if I can, but sometimes the black-eyed peas are hard to find). This is ALWAYS a huge hit, people ask me over and over to make it, you can adjust the spice level and even kids love it!

This was so delicious and easy to make! We  had to omit the avacado (they were unripe)  and added 1/2 c. of fresh chopped cilantro - served them with Fritos Scoops and everyone thought it was fantastic!

This was a big hit. I used one can of black eyed peas and one can of black beans. Next time I will use more pepper or jalapeno to give it a little more kick. I also used more avacado than what was called for.

Delightful as is.  The medley of ingredients were appetizing looking and delicious!  I may mash up the black-eyed peas (only) in the food processor next time to see if it's a little more traditional dip-like.  Fantastic way to eat beans (peas).  Happy New Year!

"The Best"! Try this one - you'll like it. If by some miracle you have any left over, experiement with some of your favorite add-ins like a bit of shredded meat, a spoonful of sour.  cream, chopped black olives and stuff into a corn tortilla or pita for lunch. Thanks Kim.

It was great even though I left out the peas and jalapenos...and I just used regular pepper.

Liked this recipe, but I wonder if it would be better warm? Be sure to rinse the beans well, or else the colors don't stand out as well. I used this for the "good luck" black-eyed pea portion of a new year's party menu.

Made a half recipe of this today and it tasted so good. I made one change. I used black beans because I didn't have any black eyed peas on hand. I put the mixture on top French bread that I cut on the bias, toasted under the broiler. Rubbed half a head of garlic against  each piece and then brushed just a bit of EVOO on it. Made a wonderful topping for brochette. I'll keep this one for future use for sure!

I make mine without the italian dressing. When chilled the oil in the dressing congeals. To the black-eyed peas you add one finely chopped onion, a couple of tomatoes diced small, fresh not canned, I can of Ro-Tel Mexican flavor (this is the lime seasoned Ro-Tel) 1 jalapeno minced. If your mouth is tender make your jalapeno sans seeds. Do NOT drain the can of Ro-Tel, the juices in it take the place of the dressing for moisture, 1 small bunch of cilantro chopped medium-fine. Avocado chopped medium-fine is a good addition.

Very good. I made this recipe for teh 2008 superbowl and it was a hit! Everyone was asking me "what's in this?" "where did you get this recipe?" and much more. One thing I would like to add though is to use 1 can of black beans, and 1 can of black-eyed peas instead of just 2 cans of black-eyed peas. Also, let this recipe sit in the fridge for atleast 3 hours to let all the juices come together. Then, right before serving add teh avacodo.

This was wonderful and very light and fresh tasting.  I couldn't find black eyed peas, so I used black beans, and added some fresh cilantro.  This dip would be even more beautiful with some corn added in!

Great as is! But I add a dash of lime juice, fresh corn (EXCELLENT addition), one can of black beans & one black eyed peas (instead of 2 blk eye peas), and a red and yellow pepper. I also cut back on the dressing by about half and use a red onion. Summer time favorite!!

Very tasty, and I only eat black-eyed peas because it is "required" in my family to eat them every New Year's Day!  My family loved it, too.  The only change I made was to squeeze half a lemon on the avocado to keep it from turning brown.

Just made this dip this afternoon and loved it.  I am taking this to a bike ride get together.  I picked this one due to no mayo or anything else to spoil in the heat.  I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of blackeyed peas.  Added some garlic and fresh squeezed lime.  A must.  I will make this again and again.

It was delicious, but I tinkered with it a little bit to suit my own tastes.  I omitted the jalepeno, and added a can of drained sweet corn and a small can of drained, sliced olives.  Excellent!  Everyone wanted to know how I came up with such a great recipe!

This was excellent; quickly wiped out at work, and the recipe was requested by many.  I made a few changes- I substituted one can of black beans for one of the black eyed peas, used one can of Ro-Tel and one can of chili-ready tomatoes in place of fresh because I can't find good winter tomatoes here, and added cumin.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe, and even 6 days later it's still quite tasty.
I made up a burrito with leftovers, and even my EXTREMELY picky 15 month old keeps coming up to me with mouth open for more.  Here's how I did it:
I took a tortilla, and tore up a slice of cheese and placed 1/4 of it in small pieces down one edge of the tortilla, with the rest near the middle.  Microwave 15 seconds to soften.  Take 2 T. of the caviar and use a slotted spoon to drain the extra liquid off, and put down the middle of the tortilla.  Microwave 30 seconds, add a bit of sour cream, and roll up burrito-style, using the cheese along the edge to seal at the end.  YUM!

After reading the reviews, I made a few changes-used black beans, Rotel and added corn, and we think this dish is yummy!  Next time I will add some minced garlic and cilantro to the mix as well, but this dish is easy and delicious.  Perfect party food!  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Kim!

Maybe this could be a better tasting recipe with the absolute best tasting italian salad dressing. I used Kraft, maybe with a premium dressing it would be better. A market near us makes this basically the same, and it was a whole lot better............

Great, easy recipe.  Also forgiving- I have made many adjustments to it over time, depending on what was in season/in my pantry.  This usually gets eaten before the party is over!  If you must make it ahead of time, to keep the avocados from turning brown cover the bowl w/ a plate or plastic wrap which lays directly on the salad.  This limits contact with air, which contributes to the oxidation and brown discoloration of avacados

This is a really good base recipe.  I omitted the avocado & jalapeno, and added a can of corn & about 1/3 cup fresh cilantro.  Also, I used the packet of zesty Good Seasons and made my own italian dressing, after reading another review.  Wonderful taste, but it can come out a little soupy.  Be sure to drain your beans, and next time I think instead of just pouring the 8 oz. of dressing in, I'll add it slowly, stirring between pours to see how the amount of dressing I'm adding in is affecting the 'soupiness'.  I'm guessing it probably only really needs maybe 4-5 oz.  Other than that, GREAT recipe!  I had some with tortilla chips, and later put a few spoonfuls into a whole wheat pita!  Thanks for the recipe Kim!  (P.S. I've never used that Good Seasons type of dressing before -- it's excellent!  So much better than bottled Italian!)

I was skeptical about the Italian dressing, but this was SO good.  I let it marinate overnight without, then drained the excess dressing and added the avacado right before the party...it was a big hit!

When I went to store on New Year's Day they were out of canned black eyed peas, so I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen peas instead.  I put them in a pot of salted water, brought them to a boil, and then reduced to a simmer and simmered for 30 minutes.  Then I drained them, and added everything but the avocado.  I also added cilantro and green onion.  I was also afraid that I couldn't chop the jalapeno fine enough and I wanted the heat and flavor without anyone getting a chunk of jalapeno, so I blended the chopped jalapeno with the cup of salad dressing, and it also seemed to thicken the salad dressing a little, and reduce the "soupiness" others talked about.

This was a favorite dip at our Neighborhood New Year's Eve Party.  I found the recipe and pulled all the ingredients out, but my husband put it together.  I am not sure if he used too much Italian dressing, but I would use less to make it less soupy.  The flavor was outstanding and just wonderful blend of seasoning on the taste buds.

Excellent.  I added a little corn and some fresh parsley.  It got rave reviews and was the hit of the party.

Excellent variation on Texas Caviar. I didn't have Italian dressing, so I omitted that and instead added the juice of one lime, salt and pepper, a couple tablespoons of cilantro and some garlic. Next time, I'm going to try some orange juice instead of lime, because that always brightens up avocado. As with salsas, it's best to let this rest for 15-20 minutes before serving to let the flavors meld a little bit.

Although I make a lot of changes to this recipe, this is still the recipe I come back to as a starting point when I make my Texas Caviar.

First of all, we use black beans instead of black eyed peas. I often use canned tomatoes, sometimes rotel. We add some cilantro, a little cumin, and some garlic powder. Throw in some corn!

I make this about once a week and my family loves it. Sometimes that is our main dish on a busy weekend night, everyone nibbles at will.

This is great with "Scoops" tortilla chips.

This dip is wonderful! Took it to a New Years Eve party and was a huge hit! The longer its in the fridge the better it is. Made it in the am to take that night. I served it with scoop Fritos, Flax tortilla chips, and Blue Corn tortilla chips. I was looking for variety and all three worked perfectly. This wonderful "salsa" would be fantastic with grilled chicken or a meaty fish like grouper or Mahi. Very light and super flavorful!

I thought this version tasted like I was eating Italian Dressing and the avocados turn to mush too fast. I much prefer a dressing made from vinegar, sugar, salt & pepper, Save your avocados for guacamole!

This appetizer was a hit with the ladies at my Easter dinner.  My recipe differed slightly in that it used black beans instead of black eyed peas, and mexican style corn.  But most of the other ingredients were the same.  I served it with Tortilla scoops.  The ladies were eating it with a spoon right from the bowl.  Thanks, Kim!

i've made this several times and everyone raves about it!  Instead of 2 cans of black beans, I only put 1 but I add 1 can of corn.  Also, I only add the dressing just enough to coat everything.  Otherwise it gets too mushy.

I like black eyed peas and if you do also, you will like this dip/or rather salsa.  It was not the hit I hoped for at my New Years party but I think it is because black eyed peas are an acquired taste. This recipe is delicious though, and I ate it up.

I made this to take to a New Year's Eve party.  It was scrumptious!  I took the suggestion of Kim and used the Wishbone Italian Dressing.  I used one can of Bush's Blackeyed Peas and one can of Bush's Black Beans.  I was a tiny bit heavy handed with the cayene pepper, so needless to say it was cha-cha-cha Hot! The next time I will use a lighter dusting...lol  This recipe was enjoyed by all.  Before going home my friends requested a copy of this recipe.  Thanks Kim for such a simple, easy, tasty recipe.

This is so awesome--I usually double the recipe because it disappears so fast! I do add a finely minced habanero in addition to a little red and green jalapeno  because we like the spice (and the colors are beautiful!). I make it in a stainless steel serving bowl so it stays nice and cold while folks are eating it.

This was the hit of my party! Everyone wanted this recipe! I did substitute Low cal Ital. dressing by mixing it half and half with regular Italian. Also, did not know th wear gloves when I chopped the Jalapeno peppers which caused my fingers to burn a bit. My Mexican guest clued me in on this tip and also told me if you want it hotter include some of the veins from the Jalapeno as this is where the hot comes from in the Jalapeno. Definitely a winner!!

My family liked this recipe a lot. I may go a little lighter on the Italian dressing next time. I don't think it needed the entire 8 oz. I also don't do so well with the hot peppers, so I went for a milder poblano. Thanks so much for sharing! I would have never thought to use black-eyed peas in a dip like this, but they were great!!!

Took this to a girls night at my sister in laws house.  Everyone loved it.  I substituted apple cider vinegar and EVOO in place of the italian dressing and black beans in place of black eyed peas.  Very good, will definitely make again.

Healthy awesome dip. I didn't have tomatoes as they are out of season for good tomatoes so used a can of diced tomatoes and drained the juice (save that for another recipe). I used a can of green chili peppers and only 1/2 cup of Italian dressing and it was very nice. Yes, I used 1 can of black-eyed peas and 1 can of black beans which makes it more colorful and fun. Make sure you drain and rinse these first. I had some red pepper also so I added about 1/4 cup of chopped red peppers. Great.

I am not from the south and don't care for black-eyed peas. That said...   the reviews enticed me to make it for Bunko. I had some for dinner and was already hoping for some tomorrows lunch. It initially looks like you've made alot! Bunko girls loved it and needless to say there wasn't a drop to  save for my lunch!!!! Loved how fresh it was. Next time I will try the Wish bone Fat Free dressing just to see if it can still taste soooo good and be sooo good for us!

This turned out really nice...I used one can of chick peas and one of kidney beans because that's what I had, also used a balsamic vinagrette instead of regular Italian.  I made this for a quick dinner and everyone enjoyed it.

I made this for my office potluck. I used a mixed of black beans and red beans instead of black eye peas. I made it the night before without the avocado then added it in right before serving. I didn't like the soupiness so I used a slotted spoon before I served it to get the juices out. And ...It turned out delicious!!

Spicy and sweet! I really enjoyed this. I used fat-free italian dressing and added a bunch of cilantro that I chopped up. This is good with or without the avocados. If using the avocado, pour some lime juice over it before adding it to the mixture so it doesn't brown up right away. Served with tortilla chips.

Made this recently for a BBQ and it was quite a hit. It does make quite a bit. I might halve the recipe next time. I also added the juice of one lime. Seemed like it needed a little citrus flavor.

I added some cilantro and a splash of lime, and used about two ounces of Italian dressing.  This will become a staple.

So easy that when I was done making it I was disappointed, sure it couldn't live up to the rave reviews.  Never happier to be so wrong!  This was delicious!  I'm not a fan of jalepeno or avocado, but even I couldn't stop eating it!  I served it Bruchetta-style, and that worked well.  Next time I'll do tortilla chips.

I was absolutely surprised by this one!  I've heard of this kind of recipe before but was afraid to try it because I remember not liking black-eyed peas when I was a kid.  But, boy, I couldn't stop eating this one!  I did substite 1 can of the peas for 1 can of black beans.  It was a great taste.  Thanks for getting my taste buds to be more adventurous, Kim!

Not bad, easy to put together.  It was a little bland for us so I added some cyanne pepper and put another handful of jalapenos in along with some banana peppers.  Next time I'll add a can of corn!  took it to the office and it was gone!

I love this and I HATE black-eyed peas!
The only change I made was the addition of a few cloves of finely minced garlic.
I really hate black-eyed peas!  As a Southerner, I feel compelled to eat them on New Year's Day for luck and have long sought a recipe that made the dreaded peas somewhat palatable.  I made a second batch of this a few days after New Year's Day (the first was long gone!) and I ate it as a salad.  YUM!  Black-eyed peas aren't just for New Year's anymore!

OMG...this is absolutely wonderful!  I've made this several times, using either black-eyed peas alone or a combo with black beans.  Only other change was to add fresh chopped cilantro!  A definite keeper-Thanks!

This was absolutely amazing. I was really hesitant because I usually only make things that contain somekind of cheese!  I made this exactly as described in the recipe. The only one thing I did different was after it was made, I transferred everything to a new bowl and got rid of a lot of the extra liquid. It was still a little watery when people were scraping the bowl, but it was definitely a hit. Thanks for such a great recipe. I'll definitely make again.

This dip was so easy and so good!  It makes a lot, but holds over well, if by some miracle it's not all gone the first time you serve it.  I used one can of black-eyed peas and one can of black beans and it came out perfect.  All the people at the party raved over it and I had several requests for the recipe.

Quick and easy and perfect for a potluck.  I made everything but the avocados the night before my office potluck and then added them in the morning.  It was great because it gave me a little extra time to ripen the avocados.

This was super easy and really good! I didn't even know I liked black eyed peas. I would recommend less dressing; I will try 3/4 c. next time. I used 3 California avocadoes and it was still a little bit too much liquid. (I will also look for a healthier dressing alternative as the oil is the only un-healthy part of this recipe).  I used a can of diced green chilies instead of jalapenos, only because it was cheaper and easier. I added a dash of lemon juice to keep the avocado from turning.

I got busy during the party and actually forgot to put this out.  Much to my surprise, it kept really well overnight and was delicious the next day.  

Of course it is delicious with Fritos Scoops, but it is also great with whole grain crackers.

I wasn't sure about this recipe, I think because of the Italian dressing, but it got such great reviews I decided to try it.  It was wonderful!  I love the avocado in it.  I did use one can of black beans and one can black-eyed peas and I added cilantro.  I made it for a potluck and everyone loved it.  This will replace my other recipe for bean dip which was much more time consuming.  Thank you for the great recipe!

After being introduced to this recipe at a Christmas Party last year, I fell in love with it.  I made it last New Year's and again this year.  I can't eat the cayenne peper or jalapeno pepper - so to help preserve the flavor issue I use a can of Rotel tomatoes instead (of course, I have to use the mild ones).  I also do not use quite as much Italian dressing as the recipe calls for . . . I go by taste.

This was ok but I think a really huge part of whether you will like this or not is the type of Italian dressing you use.  I used regular Wishbone Italian and the resulting dip was almost sweet.  It really needs a very vinegary, tangy Italian dressing to make it work (IMHO).  I was making this for a crowd so I took it easy on the cayenne, but I kept adding more to the leftovers to help liven it up and counteract the sweetness of the dressing.  I also used 1 can black eyes peas (in the canned vegetable section of my grocery store if you are having trouble finding them) and 1 black beans.  Good, makes a ton, people liked it, but it would have been much better with a different dressing.  I will definitely try again.  update: tried again with good seasons dressing made from a packet.  Was better but I think it may just need straight vinegar and oil, heavy on the vinegar.

Used this for a fundraiser event a few years ago.  We won out of about 20 appetizers. Make it a lot for get togethers and the bowl is always empty at the end of the evening. Excellent recipe, but in the winter I use canned diced tomatoes.  Wish I could give t more than 5 stars.

Followed the recipe exactly as written for a potluck at work. I made everything the night before then added the avocado when I got to work just before serving. It was a major hit! I'll be making this for a long time to come.

I made this last night for my husband and myself, and we could not get enough. It is DELICIOUS! I have made similar salads but this one was unique with the black-eyed peas and the avocado. The only variations I made were to use one can black-eyed peas and one of black beans (as the recipe submitter mentioned in their review), and we added some fresh cilantro (about 1/2 c) as another reviewer suggested b/c we are big cilantro fans.

I wish I could give this 10 stars....you feel like you are eating health-from-a-garden, and yet, sneaking an incredible-it-has-to=be-bad-for=you snack! I make this often, and it makes a lot...thre is never any left. It takes time to prepare, because of all the chopping and such.  I tend to leave out the jalapeno and rely on the cayenne for just a hint of hot. I also add a chopped,sweet, red bell pepper and crisp sweet white corn.  I make Good Season Italian dressing, which tastes so much better and is better, for you and I add chopped cilantro and a fresh lime squeezed over the top. Thanks you for this recipe! I love it!

Yummy recipe.  I substituted a can of black beans and a can of sweet corn for the black-eyed peas and added about 1/2 cup chopped red bell peppers.  My husband can't keep his hands off it.

Excellent recipe.  I was a little leery of the Italian dressing, and I only used about half of what the recipe called for, but the flavor of the ingredients together was great.  We are Weight Watchers, so I used a fat-free Italian dressing, and will definitely make this again.

I totally tweeked this recipe, only because I had cherry tomatoes and didn't want to chop up tiny tomatoes.  I made recipe as posted, except I used cherry tomatoes, omitted the jalapeno peppers (because I was serving it to my kids), and added mozzerella pieces and black olives.  This was more of a spoon/fork salad for us than a dip.  Didn't matter...it was fantastic!!  We served this on New Year's Eve and loved it!

Delicious! Made this for New Years Eve with the Black Eyed-Peas. It was exceptional! I added some fresh cilantro and eyeballed the dressing to lightly coat. I also added a spritz of lime juice. Will make this over & over again!

I thought this had a very good taste, but it was a little bit too soupy for my taste.  Next time I would probably cut back on the italian dressing a bit and add some lime juice and corn to make it a little prettier.

Oh Yummo!

I used one can of black beans and one of the black eyed peas, jarred jalapenos since the FDA currently has the ban on fresh ones, and reduced fat Kraft zesty italian dressing and this is really one awesome recipe.  I left out the cayenne and it had just enough kick without making you reach for water.  Definitely a pot-luck type dip and we'll be making it again!

Hubby loves spicy anything. He said this was so good. He nearly finished half the bowl as soon as I made it. It goes without saying this is a staple. The only change I made was use Rotel mild tomatoes/chilies as I forgot to get some at the grocery store.

This was ok, nothing special. As one of the reviewers mentioned, it all depends on the Italian dressing you use.

Excellent, and a big hit on New Year's Day. I used a can of drained chopped tomatoes as I couldn't find fresh tomatoes that were suitable. Added a little chopped green pepper and a small can of corn.  Cut back on the heat by  reducing the jalapenos and skipping the cayenne. I'll be making this one again, for sure! Thanks!

I found the dip to be too sweet with the italian dressing I used, so I drained most of it, added a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and added a few crushed garlic cloves.  Delicious!  Next time I may try a "zesty" italian.

Not what I was expecting. I guess I thought it would be more like a bean salsa but the flavors just weren't there. Don't get me wrong - this dish is good - just not what I was looking for. Maybe if I add some cilantro it will be better.

Made this for a neighborhood picnic yesterday.  There was NOT ONE DROP LEFT!! Used 1 can black eyed peas, 1 can black beans and added a can of whole kernel corn, and Rotel in lieu of onions, tomatoes and jalapenas.  (just being lazy).  It is DELICIOUS. easy to make, healthy and great for a warm summer night picnic.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper!!

A favorite in our household!  We use black beans, not black eyed peas; add frozen corn, and often minced red and green peppers.  We also add the Italian dressing slowly, until all ingredients are melded but it's not soupy.  Add the avocado just before serving, and we use Frito's scoops.  Even our  son makes this for his friends in college, it's his signature dish.  Excellent recipe and can be infinitely varied depending upon what ingredients you have available and your preferences.

Happy New Year 2016! Woke up this morning and, with coffee in hand and the Rose Parade playing, decided I'd make something with black eyed peas. Had MOST of the ingredients on hand for this recipe, so decided to go with it. Had to be a teensy bit creative: with only 1 can of peas, I halved the recipe. Added about 1/2 c. of fresh cilantro, chopped down to 1/4 c., and had to substitute Greek oil and vinegar salad dressing. To me, avocados make a dish go a bit flat without salt, so I added a bit of that as well (and that may be why lompoc sheri thought the taste was a little lacking). Still absolutely delicious even with my changes. Keeper!!!

We make this every year around the New Year since black eyed peas are said to be good luck.  I make it exactly as written, it's a hit at every party & I always have friends requesting the recipe. Fresh, healthy & holds well in the fridge so you can gradually put out more during your party.  Yum!

My 5, 14, and 16 year-olds wolfed this down and asked for more.  Quick to make and rich with flavor.
