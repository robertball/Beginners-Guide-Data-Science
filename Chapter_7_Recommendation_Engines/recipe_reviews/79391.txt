Great idea!  I removed the pulp from the rind after the 7 days and went ahead and julienned it then. I got almost a half pint jar which will probably last me less time than its shelf life!  Couldn't bring myself to discard the pulp though...I used a little of it in a martini. Very good. I used the rest in a marinade. Equally great results!

Just a tip, use Meyer lemons, they taste sooooo much better. Also, lightly rinse the lemons before using to take off some of the salt.

I must say that these are definitely an acquired taste but after a while they grow on you and do give dishes that extra little something. I sprinkled into some spicy beef stir fry and it tasted lovely.

Simple & tasty way to use my bumper crop of lemons. The intensity of the mellowed rind is wonderful in so many dishes and I love to use the juice/oil for salad dressings and mrinades. Like many others, I rinse the lemons before using.

I substituted boiling water in lieu of olive oil.  Worked great.  I use the pulp in martinis.  They are a lovely sweet/salty substitute for an olive!

I made this using only one lemon just to try out the recipe. Didn't even use the finished product for a couple of weeks. But, Wow! What a great flavor addition for rice or chicken! Basmati rice made with pieces of these lemon strips, garlic, ginger and a little lemon juice - just delicious. Adds a nice spark of flavor to everything else I've tried it in. As another reviewer suggested, I cut out the white pith after final curing and rinsed them, so they're ready to go right out of the container. A great little recipe trick -  easy to prepare but so worth it.

We spend the winter in Az.  I make these lemons all the time.  They are great in chicken and fish dishes.  Also potatoes and other veggies.

I leave out the oil . The Mediterranean version doesn’t use oil and I like it more. These are great with chicken, soup, any type of dish where salt and lemon are used.

I have used these lemons for years when I make my grandson’s favorite dish-Marrakech Chicken. I use the inside pulp, shave off the pith, and thinly sit the peel. It’s really flavors the Marrakech to a tasty dish for all. I’m making it as a Christmas present this year to my adventurous family members.
