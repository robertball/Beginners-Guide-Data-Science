This recipe gets an 'A' for effort. Adding the tapioca and soy lecithin help give it some body, which is what homemade versions typically lack- I'm thrilled it doesn't use carrageenan. My soy lecithin is in granule form, so I pulverized it before adding to the blender. The tapioca will settle some, so give it a good shake before serving. Thank you for the recipe.
