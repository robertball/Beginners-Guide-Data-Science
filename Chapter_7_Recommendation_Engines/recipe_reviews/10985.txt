We love these snacks. Sometimes, I vary this up and use Reese's peanut butter chips or either dark or semi sweet chips in place of the butterscotch chips. It's all a matter of what you like or have on hand. The kids LOVE to make these. NOTE: I rarely keep wax paper on hand, I just drop them on tin foil.

I have been making these for 13 years.  They are my husband's favorite dessert.  SO easy and wonderful!!  At Easter, I make them deeper around the edges, with a depression in the middle  and put 3 small jellybeans in the center.  They look like small birds nests.  Really cute!!

The best haystacks recipe! Be careful about the amount of peanut butter--it will still taste great, but may get sticky.

This was my first time making Haystacks and they turned out great!!! I didn't have a double boiler, so I melted my butterscotch chips & peanut butter in the microwave. I've made this recipe twice in the last 2 weeks. Second time, I doubled it.  Wonderful!

Unbelievably simple and delicious.  After tasting at a cookie swap, I immediately looked up the recipe.  I followed others' advice and flattened mine a little to make easier to bite.  Had to chill mine to get them to totally harden, but I doubled the recipe and may have gone heavy on the peanut butter.  Will DEFINATELY make again!

Love this recipe! My mom has been making these for Christmas for as long as I can remember. However, I have never had them with peanuts before...she always mixes in M&M's instead. SO GOOD! Also, be sure you let the peanut butter and butterscotch cool just a little before adding in the M&M's or they will melt. The recipe she gave me was 1 12 oz package of butterscotch chips, 2/3 cup peanut butter, 1 cup M&M's and 3 oz can of chow mein. I buy a little more than 3 oz's and just add until it looks good. :)

Tastes great every time.  Great use for the organic peanut butter that has separated and is now a big peanut blob at the bottom of the jar.

Different flavor and very easy to make (no longer than 30 minutes). Adds variety to cookie platters with no baking necessary. I use 1 can (5oz) of noodles, 1 bag (11oz) of butterscotch chips and 1 cup of peanuts which makes up to 50 stacks. I've also made "sticks and stones" on this website with pretzels, chocolate and butterscotch chips, peanuts, peanut butter and raisins which is also very quick and simple, great for those who love chocolate covered pretzels, and tastes a lot like a Chunky candy bar.

Wow these are great. Easy to make. Made them for a Christmas Cookie Exchange.Had people calling and asking for the recipe. If you like the combination of sweet and salty this is the one for you. Will be making these again and again.

So easy!  I had these as a child and Christmas spirit had me craving them this year.  I don't have a double boiler so I microwaved on high for 1 minute stirring every 20 seconds...perfect!

I learned how to make this in Home Economics class when I was 12 years old (I'm now 44 going on 45), so I know this is an old recipe, but definitely an old favorite!  It's like you just made your own candy!  LOVE IT!!!

These are very good, but they are fabulous if you make them with shoestring potato chips!  The potato chips are not as hard as the noodles.

Quick, easy and DELISH!!  I do find if I crumple the chow mein noodles a bit they are easier to bite.  If left long they can be a bit tricky to get in your mouth and become a little messy to eat.

This is a base I use to make my Haystacks. I omit the peanuts and sometimes no peanut butter and use dark chocolate chips to cut the sweetness of the butterscotch. I use 1 cup per chips and 1/4 to 1/2 cup peanut butter when I do add it, they are awesome!

Quick, easy, and tasty! I switched out the chow mein noodles for Fiber One cereal. Can't taste the difference and adds a little nutrition.

Very simple and suprisingly addictive. Sweet, salty and crunchy.   My husband eats the entire batch within a day.  Honestly, I can't make it often because it is dangerous to have around....you know what I mean?

WOW!! This was super easy and super tasty! I made 6 dozen of these in less than an hour for a cookie exchange.  Even the health nut told me in confidence she ate every single one on her drive home!  Multiple people asked about the recipe! I let one student have one to try and she was begging for more!  Did half with salted peanuts and half with M&M's.

I made these today with chocolate chips instead of butterscotch.  I made them in just 7 minutes, which is awesome!  They didn't set up as well as I was hoping they would though-even after an hour in the freezer, they were still sticky to the touch.  I think it's the real peanut butter.  I read some different recipes for this online and found some that just use peanut butter chips along with the chocolate chips and I think that might work out a bit better.  These were still quite tasty though, both my husband and I enjoyed the flavor and texture.  We might make these again, but probably with modifications so they are less gooey.

I really enjoyed these!  Sooo easy to make but I did end up having to refrigerate to get them to set- which really wasn't a problem.  I usually make these with chocolate but these were a great alternative!

Perfect as written or add in 1/2 cup mini marshmallows for variation.  Yum, going to make another batch within 24 hrs of the first batch!  Melted in microwave, which is a low wattage small one, for less than 2 minutes stirring every 15 seconds.

absolutely delicious.  amazing texture and taste.  easy to make, don't need to modify the recipe at all.  you can do it all in one big microwavible bowl to save clean up.  when it's all mixed, keep mixing it once in a while - the peanuts are heavier and they sink to the bottom

This recipe produced a wonderful tasting and looking haystack.  However, I was only able to make 16 small, flattened haystacks (flattened for ease of getting one's teeth into it!) using the measurements listed.  I would at least double this recipe in order to make the mess worth it!

This is one of my favorites recipes that I always make for a party.  It is so easy to make.  I made it for the Super Bowl party that I attended and within 20 minutes it was gone.  Everyone loves this recipe.  I am always asked for the recipe. The only part I do not like about this recipe is that it is very sticky when you put it on the wax paper with a fork to set.  Other than that it is quite easy.  You will not go wrong this delicious recipe.

Someone made these for us a few years ago and when I tripped across this recipe, I made them instantly and we handed them out with our Christmas cookies.  At Christmas, it was an easy project to make with my nephew and my daughter and they enjoyed "cooking" something together.  They are really sweet so I might try tweaking these a little more to appeal to more than just the kids.

Everyone always loves these, especially the kids.  These are great to make when you have little assistants wanting to help!  I basically double this recipe, using a whole bag of chips (11 oz.), 2 cans of noodles (5 oz. each) a whole cup of creamy peanut butter and a whole cup of peanuts which I coarsely chop.  They always turn out great and everyone wants the recipe.  Enjoy!

All i had on hand was crunchy peanut butter, and it worked out well.  Neither my toddler, husband, or I were fond of these.  They lacked in flavor for me.

I had exactly one cup butterscotch chips and did not know what to do with them.  Made this and added one cup of mini marshmallows and left out the nuts because I did not have any. Yummy treats.

These are SOOOO GOOOOD! My friend in highschool taught me these, but without the peanuts. I sometimes prefer them without so I make a double batch, half with, half without peanuts. OH-MY-GOD GOOD.

After getting tired of trying 5 star recipes that are actually 1 to 3 star recipes, I decided to make this old favorite.  My mom made these when I was a kid, SOOO GOOD, and best of all, VERY, VERY easy to make!  My husband's eyes lit up when he tried one, kids loved them.  This one is a quick, delicious, reliable standby.

These were easy to make, but be sure you have lots of room in your fridge to chill them! (Or set them in the snow outside, like I did!)  Delicious!

These were okay. Didn't love them, didn't hate them. Followed the recipe to a T, but they seemed to be a bit salty for some reason.

Made this recipe for Christmas at work and then had to make again for New Year's! Everyone loved them! I took another's advice and used the Fiber One cereal and came out better. If you want less mess and more consistent size use mini muffin papers on cookie sheet.

My family loves this! It's as simple as it gets and is great just as the recipe calls for but I like to add about a tablespoon of brown sugar for a maple taste. And then right before the noodles I stir in a teaspoon of my madagascar gold rum homemade vanilla. I've learned recently how to make my own vanilla and wow that's easy and great. And lastly I sometimes use all rice noodles instead of chow mein.

I followed the recipe and it wouldn't set up.  I took the "haystacks" and tried pressing them into a cake pan to cut and that didn't work. I then tried adding more dry ingredients and that didn't help.  I finally put everything in a big bowl, added powdered sugar, shook it all up and turned them into muddy buddy's.

These bring back such memories.  Easy peasy when you use the microwave.  It only took about 50 seconds and it was ready.  Put them on a sheet pan and into the freezer.  Had our little desserts in about 15 minutes.  My kind of recipe!

Cheap, simple, easy. But, be careful how you store them...they are really temperature sensitive! :) If you're out of the noodles, you can use pretzels, too.

I love these. I modified the recipe a bit though. Used 1/4th cup crunchy peanut butter, 1/4th cup nutella, 1/2 cup butterscotch and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Soooooo good without being overly sweet.

Oooh, these were not good. They were SUUPER SWEEET! Only change I made was using a plain rice cereal instead of chow mein noodles. The peanut butter and butterscotch coating just hurt my teeth upon tasting it. I made a 1/2 recipe and got 10 with a cookie scoop. I couldn't even finish one, because of the sweetness. I tried a Fiber One version with chocolate and PB and they were pretty good. Maybe, it was the butterscotch chips.

LOVE.  This has been a life-long staple for Father's Day, Christmas, and any other event which I visit my Dad. He's completely mad over these, and actually hides them from others, metering them out daily.  We call these either katydids or haystacks, but either way we call them DELICIOUS.

Love these!  Very simple to make.  I make one batch following this recipe and then make a second batch leaving out the peanut butter and adding 1 cup choc. chips to the butterscotch.  This makes more coating than the original recipe so I bump up the peanuts to 2 cups along with the 2 cups of chow mein noodles.  Very easy and versatile recipe.  Thanks!

I love the flavor of the cookie, no doubt about that but i found the chow mein noodles to be way too hard! Making it difficult to chew the cookie, hurts the teeth sometimes.. and im a young female with strong teeth, so ya..    i think i might try with the same recipe next time with oats, nuts, and maybe corn flakes. No noodles.!

I love this recipe! It's such a yummy and traditional thing to make for Christmas and it's so easy too! I did everything as the recipe states except for adding mini marshmellows after the chow mein to stretch the recipe farther. There was plenty of the butterscotch/peanut butter mixture to cover everything completely.  Delicious, easy and inexpensive, now that 's a good combination!!

This recipe comes with two warnings: 1) it doesn't make nearly enough and 2) if you decide to set them by placing them on cookie sheets in the cold winter air, even plastic wrap will not deter squirrels from eating several of them. I'm serious. They're lucky they're so cute - I was not happy to find little bite marks and missing pieces! Anyway, they're divine and super easy, and they taste just like the ones my aunts always made when I was little. Woohoo!

This was an easy recipe to accomplish and everyone liked them. I would take a guess and say that this isn't for people who do not really like butterscotch to begin with. The crunch of the noodles worked so well with the pb and butterscotch. This one is worth me revisiting again. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved these little morsels. Will try peanut butter chips next time or as others did, add rice krispies or marshmallows, just so I can keep making them. Update - I made them again with an equal mix of peanuts, rice kripies and pretzel sticks. YUM

Good and Easy! My youngest son loves to help me make these and my two older sons love to help eat 'em.  These are just like the ones my Mom and I would make when I was a kid.

Just right.  Had them ready in minutes after putting them in the freezer.  Next time I will probably replace the peanuts with something else.  Maybe M&Ms?

I found this after I made some chocolate haystacks from this site that did not turn out and these came out completely different!  They were DELICIOUS and everyone loved them!  They were so easy to make and everyone was delighted to bring some home.

I used to make these as a child. I don't remember if I got the recipe out of class for a food/craft day, or if I found them in one of my children's cookbooks. Either way, they're easy to throw together and fun for children because they look like a pile of twigs. you could even use chocolate instead of butterscotch on Halloween to create creepy muddy bones (obviously use melted white chocolate and 'paint' the 'bones').

They're so easy to make, nice and cruncy, and they keep for a long time. I like to make them and shove them in a jar, or give them out to people. It's kind of a funny little recipe that you look at and think, "Wow, that's boring," but really, it's a nice treat when you don't want to bake anything spectacular.

Cute! They did resemble little haystacks. Super easy to make and DH seemed to like these. A bit rich though, so make them small. Great for a quick munchie without heating up the kitchen on a hot summer night. I made these and chocolate chow mein clusters, out of the two I preferred the chocolate while DH prefered these. Thanks Carole for sharing this so we could try.

Killer recipe - FANTASTIC!! I was skeptical but we loved this recipe better than the Haystacks II recipe with semi-sweet chips....love the recipe just the way it is!  My stister-in-law has shared this recipe with her friends in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Very easy. I love butterscotch! Even DH enjoyed them. I broke up the noodles a bit. Probably would a little more next time. I didn’t measure the noodles. Just added till it looked good. Will make again.

These are delicious but they never set up and remained sticky. No one seemed to mind though! I doubled the recipe but was very careful with my measurements . I will cut down on the peanut butter next time.

I grew up on these, but with shoestring potatoes instead of chow mein noodles. My kids grew up on them too. What memories!

When I was a teenager a customer used to make some of this for us and it was soooooo good. For years I tried to figure out how she made it.  I made this and it tastes exactly like hers!  It is so delicious!  I will definitely make it again.

I didn't want to give a lower star rating and lower the overall rating because I think it's a good start but I had some issues.  My haystacks only lost their stickiness and set up when they are cold (right out of the fridge).  At room temperature they were sticky and fell apart so instead of using butterscotch chips next time I am going to experiment with making it with a sugar syrup cooked to soft-crack or hard-crack stage and a vanilla or butterscotch extract. 

I didn't have salted peanuts so I used chunky peanut butter and added a light sprinkling of coarse salt over assembled stacks and I loved them but my husband needed a little chocolate  so I melted a few Reese's pb cups and drizzled that on half of the batch.  

Also, having experience with making a chocolate version of these for decades I know that too much peanut butter mixture could make loose stacks or waste a lot if it drips off as it sets so instead of dumping all of my noodles into my peanut butter mix I put some noodles in a pie plate and spooned some pb mixture over them and tossed and assembled them on Silpat mats in small batches.  Also, some of my noodles were quite long so I had to break them in order to make bite sized stacks.

Last note on versatility of this mix, I ended up only using 1/2 of the PB mixture for haystacks so I used the rest as a sort of PB Ganache over a peanut butter pie and it was delish (though if I do it again I'll cut down on the sugar in my regular PB Pie recipe b/c it kicked up t

A very quick and easy recipe.  Took less than 30 minutes from start to finish.  These delicious haystacks are perfect when you need to bring  something to a bake sale, office party or pot luck and have little time to make something.  Will definitely make them again.

An old fave I haven't had since I was young.  This is the perfect recipe for Haystacks!   Here are my little tweaks:
1.Little less peanut butter.  Easily overpowers the butterscotch.
2. Added some sweetened coconut. Added a great texure!
3. Crushed the noodles a litte to make them easier to eat.  Pressed them down just a little too.
Thank You for posting this!

Very simple as most people have stated.  I omitted the peanuts and added about 1/2 cup additional noodles.  

I microwaved* the morsels and the peanut butter for about 3 minutes on power 4. I stirred for about a minute and microwaved again for about 20 seconds to get the lumps out.

You also may want to add some baking paraffin in order to keep them together or from melting as quickly.

Made  this as is and it's great.  I did add a few more peanuts.  I have a similar recipe and this one is good too.   Great for those of us who like butterscotch.  My kitchen was warm so I stuck the wax paper lined sheet with them on it, in the fridge for a while to harden.  In the winter room temp would probably be fine.

Yum!  I made these around Christmas time.  I did not have peanuts on hand but did have walnuts.  I just chopped them coarsly and mixed them in.  So yummy!!!  

Tip: I was such a novice and bought the wrong kind of chow mein.  I bought the uncooked kind.  You need to by the already cooked crispy kind that are brown in color.

Came out yummy but peanut butter flavor wasn't as prominent as I hoped. Will try to adjust amounts to improve this, but still was difficult not to eat more than one at a time!

I've made these in the past, but that recipe was nowhere to be found in my archive so I looked to All Recipes for a replacement one. While these were easy and very tasty, they did not "set up" well and need to be refrigerated after about a half hour on the serving table or they get wet and loose, which was not the case with ones I've made in the past. I did not alter the recipe; in fact, purchased non-reduced fat peanut butter just for this (we usually use reduced fat kind). I was disappointed as I made them to give as gifts for my co-workers didn't like having to ask them to put their gifts in the fridge until they left for the day... If any one has a solution as to what I may have done wrong or how to correct this, I'd love to know! Thanks!

Delicious and oh, so easy!  I didn't bother with a double boiler but used a heavy pan and low heat.   I made them once with organic peanut butter and once with Jif. The organic took longer to set up, but did eventually do so.

These are really good, but kind of sticky/gooey.  Next time I am going to add a few more morsels, more peanuts, noodles and slightly less peanut butter.  I stored them in the refrigerator and that helped.  The candy is very good though.  Thanks for sharing.

First time making the recipe and it was very easy.  I decided to make a double recipe and the only thing that I changed was eliminating 1/4 cup of peanut butter.  They setup just fine and tasted delicious!  I had leftover Chinese fortune cookies so I just removed the fortune and dipped in the peanut butter and butterscotch mixture and it was also tasted great.

I really didn't think I would like these, myself but they were fantastic! I typically don't like stuff w/peanuts or PB much.... Used these "haystacks" for my daughters 1st B-day party theme for a barn yard bash!!!!

These are really good.  I doubled the recipe.  Think I used a bit too much peanut butter, but after setting overnight they hardened up and although a little messy to eat my kids loved them!!! I will make again!!! Thanks for the great recipe!!
Update** I made these again and formed little bird nests and put little candy egg gum inside for Easter this year.  We gave these out to the neighborhood kids and they were a great hit. Several Mothers asked for the recipe!!

I didn't have chow mein noodles, so I subs corn flakes. I had to give them away cause I couldn't stop eating them. 

A winner!

Put in more butterscotch chips, and less peanut butter--much better, and holds together much better too!

This recipe brought back childhood memories that I will now share with my daughter!  I have a helpful toddler so the simplicity of this recipe was great.  I used chunky peanut butter instead of the extra peanuts because that's what I had on hand and it worked out great.  Thanks!

Very tasty, but the peanut butter seems to make the haystacks sticky and not set up very well.  Will probably make haystacks minus the peanut butter next time.

I used to have these as a kid in girl scouts and I loved them! I made them the other day and they were awesome, I made myself sick. Thank you so much for the recipe! The only thing I would change is to either increase the amount of butterscotch chips or decrease the amount of peanut butter, because they never quite firmed completely.

These are so delicious! The butterscotch and the peanutbutter make a good mix. The kids love them! They were gone within a day or so. So easy to make! Very quick and easy snack.

Easy, awesome, a favorite among women. I added mini marshmellows towards the end, right before dropping them onto the wax paper. This way the mellows are still pretty whole. Took these to a womens Bible study -- EVERYONE asked for the recipe.

I made this but had to change one thing which I thought everyone might like to know because it actually worked. I didnt have butterscotch chips so I used 1 bag of white morsels instead. Delicous!

So simple & a great addition to Holiday baking.  I omit the peanuts from mine because of personal preference but we always get compliments from people asking what those "delicious, peanut butter, crunchyn things" were.

FABULOUS  This is the best recipe ever created and it doesn't seem like it would be when you read the ingredients. When you eat one you are unsure; you eat a second one and then you just can't quit until you are sick. They are great.

I think it definitely needs more peanuts. I was disappointed. With that addition, it would probably be at least 4 stars.

I couldn't stop eating them. They were fabulous. The only complaint I had was that mine had to be kept consistently refrigerated in order to stay firm. 
I'd make them again.

Sooo easy to make and delicious.  Reminds me of holidays as a child.  I had almost forgotten how good these treats are.
