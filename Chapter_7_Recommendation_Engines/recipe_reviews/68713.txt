EXCELLENT. I had 6 bananas to try to use up and I put 4 in this recipe instead of 2, which made for a thicker cheesecake. It probably could've been made in a 10" instead of a 9" pan. Because it was about to overflow, I cooked it in a water bath at 300F for 90 min and it came out without a crack (and didn't overflow!) Topped it with the Banana Butter Icing from this website, and was delicious.

Fabulous recipe! hyatttm included every step to prepare this cheesecake, making it easier for anyone who has never before tried to make a cheesecake. It came out perfect, the best consistency of any I’ve made! 
I was a bit intimidated by the topping recipe, but I’m glad I tried it. It was easier than I expected, came out perfect, and completely changed the experience of eating this delicious dessert. The cheesecake itself is very rich and dense, but the topping adds a light creaminess that allows you to come up for air and then dive back into that intoxicating richness. 
Banana flavor was not overpowering, but definitely present. 
Everyone loves it! I will make this again and again.

Everyone raved about this cheesecake. I did make a few changes just to the topping.  1. I added sliced banana on top of the cake. 2. I was not happy with the topping so I improvised with 1 small box banana cream pudding add 3/4 cup milk and 1/2 tub of Fat Free cool whip. I mixed pudding and milk folded in topping and put on top of banana slices using a cake decorating tips.

If you like bananas and banana desserts, you will love this cheesecake.  I only made the crust and the cheesecake (no topping) and used 4 bananas and no banana liqueur.  Before serving, I topped the cheesecake with a layer of caramel and sprinkled with ground walnuts.  Perfect.

this was amazing! Everyone loved it and thought it was delicious. I did make some changes though. Very minor however. I put 5 bananas in the cheesecake mixture in order to make it thicker. Also I used crushed pecan sandies and melted butter as the crust, instead of vanilla wafers and nuts. I did not use a water bath, and my cheesecake came out wonderfully still, with no cracks. I put a layer of sliced bananas on top of the cheesecake after it cooled over night. Topped with the whipped topping and topped that with crushed pecan sandies. It was delicious!

Excellent.  Everyone, about 15 people, absolutely loved it.  The only change I made was to use vanilla bean instead of extract in the topping.  To do this you have to cook the bean with the milk and strain it for any bean strings before adding to the the egg yolk mixture.  I too found the topping to be a bit runny but it did set up once it was chilled through.

Everyone raved about this cheesecake I made a few changes I added 3 bananas and instead of the topping listed I made banana pudding mixed with about half a container of whipped cream. I spead that over the top and then with a star tip I put little dollops of whipped cream and sprinkled vanilla wafer crumbs over the top. It was amazingly good. I will def be making this again.

Delicious! Softer/mushier than baked cheesecakes usually are, which is how I like it. I used graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers because that's what I had available. Like another reviewer suggested, I used the banana butter icing recipe on this site as topping to avoid the unflavored gelatin and heavy cream. I will be making this again!

This is an outstanding cheesecake. The only change I made to the recipe was in the crust due a personal preference. I just buttered the pan and rolled vanilla wafer crumbs around the inside of the pan till it was lightly coated and didn't bake the crust. Cake got rave reviews from about 25 people.

This cheesecake is a great idea. I used 1 cup of pureed banana in place of the sour cream, as they have the same moisture content. This made a nice, thick, and banana flavored cheesecake. I did not have any banana liqueur, so I am sure that the flavor would have been even better with that.  I would make a few changes the next time I made this. I would add a double layer of vanilla wafers and greatly reduce the amount of whipped cream in the topping. I felt like I could not taste the pudding after folding in the whipped cream. Also, I would add pieces of walnuts somewhere else in the cheesecake because they are not that noticeable in the crust. Overall, a great recipe-it was devoured at a potluck I went to.

I made this cheesecake yesterday. If you follow the instructions exactly as it is written, you will get good results. The base came out perfect with a great taste and the texture of a New York style cheesecake. I am not going to try the topping as I will make a heavy whipping cream frosting for it and cover the top and sides. I will put a cherry on top. Perfect cheesecake. Thank you.

I decided to try this out only with the cheesecake base, to see if the flavor was what I was looking for, before I messed with the topping.  The flavor was good, but the texture didn't seem like cheesecake to me.  The banana made it less smooth and creamy than I'd prefer, although it could have been that I didn't mash the banana smooth enough. Not exactly what I'm looking for.

So after reading all of the reviews (all of them excellent), I decided to go with some past advice and add something different.  I used 4 bananas, NO banana liqueur OR sour cream. I used 1 can of sweetened condensed milk. I use a water bath, but all of my cheesecakes start out in a 550 F. deg oven, the top of the springform pan covered loosely with a sheet of foil (to prevent the top from darkening). Bake for 12 minutes, then drop temp to 200 F degrees for 75 minutes. Allow to cool in oven with it off and door open. Topped off with homemade whipped cream and fresh banana slices. Chocolate drizzle is optional. Bang1 Bang! it was a Grand Slam.

Super recipe. I made it in my foods class last week, however had to change the recipe up a bit because the school (of course) wouldn't allow the banana liquor. We looked around in the kitchen for something else banana...but couldn't find anything. So we used some almond extract. Still tasted good. Ill definitely make this recipe again WITH the liquor. =)

Excellent!  I made this for a bridal shower (the bride-to-be loves bananas) and it was a hit with all the guests.  However, I had challenges with the topping ... is the gelatin mixture supposed to be cool, cold or set?  I used it cold (not set) and mixed it into my whipped topping ... which then became very soft, almost liquid.  I stuck this in the freezer to chill it again and after some time, was able to spread it on the cheesecake.  It tasted fine, looked fine ... but I am still confused if there is a better way to make the final topping.  However, anyone who loves bananas and cheesecake will enjoy this dessert!

We just didn't like this very much.  The texture came out much softer than other cheesecakes I have made, tasted not-quite-done.  It was quite labor intensive to make, and no one felt it was worth the effort.

My niece requested a banana cheesecake for her birthday after trying one at The Cheesecake Factory.  The bananas I used were very large and I was afraid it would be too much liquid, but, it was fine and had great banana flavor since there was so much fresh banana.  I also used 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/2 tsp. banana extract instead of the liquor to avoid alcohol. Based on the reviews the topping was runny for so many people, so, I looked online and found a cheesecake factory banana cheesecake copycat recipe and used the bavarian cream from that recipe on top of the cheesecake. The base of this recipe though was wonderful!  Softer than a traditional NY cheesecake, but, the flavor was good and I would make it again.  I was concerned about the cooking time because this is a very thick cheesecake, but, I cooked it according to the directions and it was perfect! Just be sure to follow the directions and don't open the door to take a peak!  It was also a great tip to run the knife around the edges when you take the cheesecake out of the oven before it cools so it doesn't crack as it cools.

this is an awesome cheesecake. I used a cup of pureed banana in place of sour cream. I made the banana frosting recipe from this site, but, it was so sweet, I added 6 oz cream cheese to it, it was perfect frosting, topped the cheesecake with crushed vanilla wafers. LOVED IT!  If you like bananas, you will love this cheesecake.

I used 4 bananas in this recipe...the topping was a pain because it took so long to thicken, the only thing I recommend is baking the cake longer than 45 minutes, about half an hour longer. I say that because the cake was not a firm consistency, too loose and creamy....but it is scrumptious!

It was good. But I didn't think it was good enough for all the effort and time it took to make. My husband did love it though! I think it might be better if there were chuncks of bananas through it.

Absolutely loved it.  Reminded me of Cheesecake Factory.  The only thing I changed was I added more vanilla wafers (almost tripled the original portion) and took the walnuts out of the recipe.

I actually made it a while back and followed it exactly, except I used banana extract instead of liqueur. It turned out perfect and was very good. I will make it again when I crave banana cream pie turned up to 11!

I came back to the recipe, because I have a habit of using established recipes as templates for other experimental recipes. I created a triple berry cheesecake with dark chocolate ganache using this as my template, and it turned out delicious. So, I'm writing it down for future reference. I just needed to look up some details.

I make this all the time and the first time I had made it my mom said that it wouldn't come out right but it was perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly. I only let the cheesecake chill for about four hours and that was not enough. The cheesecake did not set properly and kind of fell apart. This should definitely chill overnight. Other than that, the flavor was good.

It was great. I changed the ground walnuts to pecans. And next time when I make it I'm going to cut the whipped topping stuff in half.

Because both my wife and I are Celiac we removed the flour and we also didn't do the "custard" topping. We used GF vanilla wafers and regular whipped cream. It was awesome! Great recipe!

If your people love bananas,  make this!  I was a little worried that I overbaked it at first because it was browned more than what I was used to.  But it was completely fine.  It’s a little creamier than a regular cheesecake because of the bananas.  I followed a variation on the topping that I saw in the comments section using banana pudding and cool whip.  I put whole cookies around the edges when I was don and sprinkled crumbs in the middle.  Delicious!

This ended up tasting good but was not worth the time it took. Cake took 3 hours to bake, topping took more time to assemble than cake (not including baking time). Will not make this again.

I came across this recipe to use up some bananas & so glad I did. It is delicious & so easy to follow the recipe. It did take me 2 days to make including chilling but well worth it.

This is not for someone who is an inexperienced baker. It is a bit complicated. and has to be done in stages. It has a good flavor but the topping that is put on after the cheesecake has set up., must set on top for at least 4 hours otherwise when you cut the cake and take it out of the cheesecake pan the topping slides down the cake and falls off, and this is very messy when cutting and serving. I don't think I'll make it again.

This tasted just delicious. I used fat free graham crackers and fat free cream cheese, and you couldn't tell! I was unable to find unflavored gelatin, so I used some strawberry-banana gelatin and although it made the cream pink, it was great!! Easy to make!
