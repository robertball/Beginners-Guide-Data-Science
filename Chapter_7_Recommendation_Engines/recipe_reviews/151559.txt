My kids love this recipe. The only modification that I make to it is that I use cream of mushroom soup instead.

I tried the recipe last night for a very picky husband (he's not a fan of broccoli). Very great recipe! I changed a few things. I boiled 2 decent size chicken breast for approx. 30 mins. (didn't want to be too mushy) I used 1-Campbell's Cheedar Cheese soup 1-Campbell's Cream of Chicken and 1-Campbell's Broccoli Cheese Soup. mixed w/ milk. Everything else I followed. You may need to use more melted butter along with the bread crums b/c it got solid after stirring. Next time I'll just pour the melted butter over the cheese then sprinkle the bread crumbs last. Other than those small tweaks...it was very tasty! And the hubby was very pleased--I can gauge him by asking can I add this to my recipe book?!? He responded definetly!;-)

This was good comfort food. I doctored by lining pan with cooked wild rice before adding chicken/soup/broccoli. Also topped with shredded parmsan and cheddar.

This was GREAT! I would add another can of soup to make the chicken a little juicier. I used stove top for the bread crumbs and it was DELICIOUS!

Very good...my boyfriend who can be hard to please with casseroles even loved it. My changes: cooked (I boiled) 2 chicken breasts and cut them up and sprinkled with garlic parsley salt. In the broccoli cheese soup mixture I only added a splash of milk and about 3/4 cup light mayo and sprinkled garlic salt in the mixture. The garlic salt makes all the difference! Yum!

I really liked this recipe. The only thing that I did differently is I cooked some spaghetti noodles and after that was finished I mixed it in with the broccoli and the chicken with the soup. My boyfriend really liked it. He packed some up for our lunch at work. He is pretty picky so this is definately going to be a recurring recipe in my house.

I found this by doing an ingredient search of chicken broccoli and cheese. I wanted something a little different. I had everything I needed for this one so I made it. BIG hit!!!!!! My two daughters one of whom gets "tired" of having chicken practically inhaled it and told me i HAVE to make this again!! I served it with egg noodles and some biscuits.

I gave this two stars instead of one because it does have possibilities but mine was awful. The recipe does say to cook the chicken but fresh broccoli needs to be precooked until crisp-tender and it doesn't tell you that. It came out raw and the whole thing went into the trash.

Pretty good. I used left over chicken rather than canned. And instead of bread crumbs I topped it with French's Fried Onions. I don't normally like to make things with canned/pre-made ingredients but this was easy fast and filling. I served it on top of egg noodles.

This is quite good! I used the suggested amount of broccoli and chicken but added a can of cheddar soup along with the broccoli cheddar soup. Be sure to add the milk to the soup before pouring into the dish. And be liberal with the cheese on top. I served on top of noodles and it was delicious for everyone--even the kids!

This was one of my favorite meals that my mom made for us growing up. I now make it for my family and we all LOVE it! It's great for potlucks too. The recipe my mom passed down to me calls for 2 cans of creamed soup (I usually use cream of mushroom but any of them are good!) and we also add 1 C of mayonnaise and 1 tsp of currie powder. I will try this recipe using 1% milk instead of the mayo because it would reduce fat/calories. I might not even notice the difference. It's FANTASTIC!

This was delish! I only gave 4 stars since I changed the recipe a bit. Instead of boiling the chicken I sauteed it in olive oil with onions and garlic. Also blanched and seasoned the broccoli (hubby doesn't like crunchy veggies). I put the chicken and broccoli in the pan first put in some leftover white rice and seasoned with pepper and a touch of salt. I thought 1 can of soup would be too dry so i used 2 and upped the milk to 2/3 cup. I put on the cheese then topped with panko bread crumbs (enough to cover the pan) and drizzled with butter. It was a huge success! The panko made the top super crunchy and delicious. Next time I will add a bit more cheese on top and mix the filling together since the soup didn't reach the bottom in some spots. Definitely making this again!

I used a few of the for-mentioned ideas and ate a pretty good dinner. First I lined the dish with white rice that I boiled in chicken broth instead of water. Then I added the boiled chicken and steamed broccoli. I added enough sharp cheddar until it looked yummy and poured creamy mushroom soup (with a tbsp of mayonnaise) over the top. Instead of breadcrumbs I crushed seasoned veggie crackers on top and then just a pinch of each salt and pepper. It was YUMMY and my boyfriend is taking the rest for lunch tomorrow.

A little bland! Next time I will steam the broccoli for a bit first since my husband likes it a bit softer then the final product. Also I doubled the bread crumbs (not butter) and next time I will double the cheese.

Well I have to say as a general rule I don't like casseroles but I really liked this one. It's quick and simple and has a really good flavor. I happened to have left over turkey I'd smoked a couple days before and used that yummmm. Do I lose smoker man points for saying "yummmm"? A couple things I suggest. To the condensed soup add 1/2 cup milk and a bit of dry mustard and/or garlic powder. Use sharp cheddar on top and a bit more than a half cup. A little cracked black pepper on top goes nice.

Absolutely loved it! It came out so creamy and cheesy! However just this dish alone wasn't enough for dinner. My husband and I found ourselves hungry a few hours later. Maybe next time I'll put this over some rice or just make a salad to go with it. It also works great the next day as a leftover lunch. I will definitely be making this again! (This is great for low carb eaters too!!)

Really easy recipe for a quick dinner. I finely chopped the cooked broccoli and combined the chicken broccoli soup and milk before adding to the pan. This gave the mixture a chance to "cook" for a few minutes so that it could thicken & not be runny/soupy. Instead of using breadcrumbs I used crushed up Kellogs Corn Flakes cereal. This added a nice crunch to the top of the mix which my family loved! Definitely recommend. Served w/ rice to make it more of a meal.

I have been making this for years it is a great way to use up left over chicken or turkey but I only use frozen broccoli I usually double the recipe and then the next day have it as leftovers with a salad. Great.

Quick easy and just the thing for a cool fall night when you need some comfort food! I "cheesed it up" by using nacho cheese soup used dry bread crumbs minus the butter added just a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese on top of the finished product. Mmmmm!

I recently made this dish exactly as it is except for I added a half can more of the soup so it could completely cover the chicken and broccoli and it came out good. My husband is a very picky eater and he enjoyed it and even asked for seconds. The only thing I might do different next time is add more bread crumbs because they give the dish a little more crunch!

I highly recommend this recipe to anyone! It's simple quick and tastes great. I have made this as is but I've found I've made it better by adding 1 tsp of garlic and curry powder to the chicken when cooking it. I also use extra bread crumbs and cream lf mushroom soup instead.

It was delicious!! I pan fried the chicken to cook it before putting it in the pan to bake and seasoned it and it was amazing! I also used frozen broccoli and put it into a sandwich bag and microwaved it after it was thawed to steam it and that was great! I would definitely recommend this recipe though I haven't tried others for chicken divan..

The broccoli turned to mush. I'm thinking boiling the chicken lightly steaming the broccoli mixing all together and broiling for a few minutes would give this dish a better texture and not kill the vegetable.

Great recipe for reusing leftovers. I had roasted chicken and potatoes the night before so I used them up in this dish with frozen broccoli. I microwaved the frozen broccoli first but didn't cook it all the way - just enough to defrost it so I could pour off the water. I added garlic powder and black pepper to the soup and milk mixture but no salt because I thought the soup had enough salt already. Finally I'm sure I used more cheese and breadcrumbs than the recipe called for but I used enough to cover the whole dish. I wouldn't make it for company but it was a tasty way to re-use last night's dinner.

This is a hit and has been since I first started making it back in 1996. I had relatives from Denmark and they even took the french bread that was served with the meal and wiped the casserole dish clean! Tonight I am making the dish to almost done let it cool then encrusting in filo dough and baking until golden brown.

Excellent! I used left over turkey. But I added a can of cheddar cheese soup and additional milk for more sauce. I also sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil and butter. Added the soups and milk. Stired until smooth. Then poured over the broccoli and turkey. Yum! Yum!

I love how fast and easy this is! I used cream of mushroom soup because that was all I had on hand and didn't use any butter. Sprinkled black pepper garlic powder and paprika on top. I'll be making this again!

I like this recipe as-is but this is also a great foundation recipe that can be customized based on what you have on hand. The last time I made this I used turkey broccoli cauliflower and red roasted peppers. I also added garlic powder and lots of black pepper and topped it with buttered breadcrumbs. Very good recipe.

Turned out great! I used 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup and 1/2 can of Cream of Mushroom along with an already cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store that I pulled meat from. Super easy and so delicious!

This is a staple in our house! The kids love it. I have substituted chicken for the beef with good results. I make my own creamy base instead of the cream of broccoli can soup. If you play around with the amount you will end up with more juices. We always serve over rice.

This was simple to make and enjoyed by all..... Even my broccoli-hating son managed to finish his portion! It lost a star because of 2 things from the original recipe....... 1) One can of soup definitely does not go far enough! Use 2 cans with appropriate proportions of milk to thin it. 2) As so many reviewers commented that it was bland I added garlic.... 1 tsp mixed in with the 2 cans of soup before putting it in the casserole dish. Last note: I used frozen broccoli as this is easier and avoided complaints about under-done broccoli.

Made this for dinner tonight... so good! I used frozen broccoli instead of fresh only because it's what I had. This recipe is not for a Southerner I don't believe -- 1/2 cup of cheese? That's nonsense! I used a little over a cup and added in mozzarella for color. Also used cream of mushroom soup since it was all we had and bumped the bread up from 2 tablespoons to a large handful to make it crunchier. Absolutely loved this. Great way to use up Christmas dinner turkey!

This is one of those dishes I remember from growing up. I did make some slight changes; I cooked the chicken breasts in the oven boiled chicken not very appealing. Used frozen broccoli that I par cooked in the microwave also used cream of chicken soup because that is what I had on hand(will try with the broccoli cheddar soup next time). I also added a pinch of nutmeg you can't really taste it but it adds a little something.

I made this and it was amazing! I used the recommended soup as well as the Campbell's "Chicken & Mushroom" soup. I also put a layer of cooked rice on the bottom of the pan. I didn't use the butter and just sprinkled the bread crumbs on top of the dish before popping it in the oven. It came out amazing! It was tasty and healthy. Will definitely make this again. It has become a favorite for me.

This dish was very easy and inexpensive to make. As a stay at home mom to a 5 month old it was also quick so I was able to make it during nap time. I had it on top of a bed of Angel Hair pasta. My family and I LOVED it. I will keep it in rotation when considering dinner ideas.

So easy and delicious! I read the reviews on here so I made just a couple modifications. I did use broccoli cheese soup but I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup. So then I added just a tad bit more milk. I didn't have bread crumbs so I just sprinkled some crumbled crackers on top. My husband doesn't like TOO much cheese so I didn't put the 1/2 cup in the mix but I did sprinkle a tiny bit on top with the crumbs. My husband is a picky eater and he loved it!

This was an amazing family friendly recipe. My family loved it even my picky older daughter. I made only a few small changes: I felt it needed seasoning so I added some salt pepper and sage (great with the chicken). I also increased the chicken broccoli (I used frozen) and sauce mixture to fill the casserole dish I wanted to use. I made it lower fat by using chicken breasts low fat soup low fat cheese 1% milk and Becel.

I made this for the second time last night. I followed the recipe to the letter the first time. This time I used a can of cream of chicken soup too. I also added a cup of cooked rice. I mixed the broccoli soup and rice together before putting in my dish. After putting on the cheese I topped it with Japanese style panko. I served crusty Italian bread with it. It was good the first time I made it and even better the second time. Thanks for this recipe and all the advice on AR.

Excellent! I first layered two pouches of already cooked brown and wild rice medley to the bottom of the 9x13 baking dish. Then doubled the recipe and used 1 can of broccoli cheese mixed with 1 can of cream of mushroom with a little garlic powder pepper and smoked paprika; I used whole milk. And instead of just adding broccoli I used frozen mixed vegetables that included broccoli cauliflower and carrots which had been thawed slightly under cool water. I used a bit more cheese (sharp cheddar) than called for because we love it! I tripled the crumb topping (instead of doubling) and perhaps next time will add more as dh thought it really added a delicious final touch. We think the Italian Style Panko makes for a crunchier topping than other similar seasoned crumbs. It went into the oven for 30 minutes at 400 degrees and came out delicious! This easy recipe is joining the dinner rotation.:)

This recipe was good but not great. It is easy and on nights when my husband is incharge of dinner this works. However I found it to be bland uninventive and lacking so I spiced it up with some potatos that I cubed and boiled till they split nicely with a fork chopped a quarter of an onion and threw it in. I also added some Mexican Velvetta for a zing. It was good and it worked for a cold day. I will probably make it again but I prefer something with a little more flavor.

I used closer to 3 cups of chicken and added 2 packages of Rice a Roni broccoli and cheese flavor (already made) and an extra 1/3 cup milk. I used frozen broccoli and just mixed it in still frozen. I also used French's fried onions instead of bread crumbs cause that's all I had. Tunred out very good. Will make again.

Not great I would have partially precooked the broccoli plus the sauce was bland and uninspiring. Definitely needed some sherry or something to make the sauce more complex. I wouldn t recommend as presented.

This recipe is great. I mix the shredded cheese into the soup/milk mixture and then stir it into the chicken and broccoli so everything is coated. I skip the bread crumbs and bake the casserole dish covered with foil. It always turns out delicious and you can use chicken or turkey and fresh or frozen broccoli. I don't pre-cook or thaw the broccoli. Always a hit and easy to throw together.

The only thing I changed was to add a bit more cheese and some leftover French fried onions I had. It was so easy and very good. I season my chicken with a garlic based seasoning to add flavor. I think it would have been too bland without that.

I left out the bread crumbs and used whipping cream instead of milk to cut carbs. My husband and I love it and we've added this recipe to our regular dinner rotation!

I thought this was so yummy! I served mine over buttered noodles and substituted the bread crumbs for fried onions on top. It was really good and even my kids approved:)

This was delicious! I did precook the broccoli for about 5 minutes in the microwave before putting the casserole together. I also used Panko bread crumbs with butter for the topping. Very crunchy and very good! I doubled the recipe and used one can cream of broccoli and one can cheddar cheese soup. It was great! I will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

I remember my mom making this for us growing up and decided to make it for dinner tonight...it was still yummy! I did use healthy request cream of mushroom soup b/c this was a last minute decision and that's all I had but it worked great. Also I agree with the others that said to either cook the broccoli first or use frozen broccoli. That's the way my mom always did it and that's the way I did it tonight. To keep it on the healthy side I also used light butter and whole wheat breadcrumbs for the topping. I seasoned my chicken before baking it in the oven w/ salt pepper and garlic powder which added a nice flavor to the casserole. The family enjoyed this and it was a nice change from the usual chicken recipes. Thanks for sharing.:)

I made this tonight but I did change a few things. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. I used 2 cans of cream of broccoli soup mixed with 1 cup of milk. I used two bags of frozen broccoli. I put each bag in a gallon ziploc bag that I punched a fork into to let air escape while I microwaved for 4 minutes. Then added the broccoli to the soup mixture. I boiled a package of egg noddles and added them to the bottom of the greased pan. Topped the egg noodles with the broccoli and soup mixture. Next I covered that with 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese. For an added texture I doubled the panko breadcrumbs and margarine and baked as directed. It was delicious!! My picky kids even gave it two thumbs up and said they would eat it again! The only thing I might change from my alteration is that I would add another can of soup to the egg noodles before putting them in the bottom of the pan. YUMMY!!

Pretty easy and basic. I used boiled chicken thighs and added garlic. Recipe needs salt and pepper. I also added Parmesan cheese. All in all it was good. With a couple tweaks you can make it an excellent quick meal!
