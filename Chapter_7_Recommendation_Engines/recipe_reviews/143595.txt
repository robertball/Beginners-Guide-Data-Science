This was a nice recipe, similar to those in restaurants. For my personal tastes, I added a couple garlic cloves, some fresh ginger, sesame oil, more honey, and used rice vinager in place of white.

This is a great & delicious miso salad dressing.  I, too, substituted rice wine vinegar for the distilled white vinegar.  I also doubled the honey.  I added grated ginger.  It's the bomb.

This was a good recipe. It was very close to the sushi restaurant down the street. I realized this was missing the peanut taste to my favorite dressing, so I added a 1T of peanut butter and it seemed to do the trick. I think it would have been better if it called for peanut oil instead of veggie oil and since I had already made it, the peanut butter was a quick fix. I would make it again.

Very good!!!  I halved the recipe and added extra honey, used rice vinegar instead of white.  I used a variety of salad greens and poured the dressing on, then sprinkled sesame seeds and mandarin oranges over the top.  We'll be making this again.  Thank you!

Great dressing!  I added about a tablespoon of ginger and it really gave it some kick, also I used half cup canola oil and half a cup great olive oil and doubled the honey.  It tastes great without the ginger, but I am a huge ginger fan.  For those that want a bit of a peanuty taste, you can use 1/3 cup peanut oil, 1/3 vegetable and 1/3 olive.  I just added some chopped pistachios on top of my salad and I got a great crunch and taste from the nuts!  Overall, great simple tasty salad dressing.  Thanks

I didn't have white vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar and it worked fine.  I made about 1/4 the recipe, and added a bit more honey and some more water to make it not so thick.  Delicious, will definitely make again!

Yum!  I made a much smaller portion of this, and used a little more vinegar than the scale down would have called for.  I didnt have honey and left it out, and it was still awesome.  And I used olive oil cause i have a lot in the house.  This is restaurant delicious.

This is so yummy!  To make it taste more like my fave sushi bar salad dressing, I finely chopped the onion in my food processor and added a squeeze of fresh orange juice and about 1/2 tsp grated ginger.  To thicken it up for veggie dip, I blended tofu into it and added a bit more of the lemon and ginger.

I made this almost as directed.  Like a few others I added a clove of garlic and fresh ginger (a nub about the size of a garlic clove).  Used Rice Wine Vinegar instead of white.  It tastes exactly like what I get on a side salad at a Japanese restaurant.  Quite tasty.  A little packs a big punch.  I'll be making this again too!

Too watery. Other than that nice flavor but I did add a little toasted sesame oil. I'll try again without the water.

Yummy!  I made it with 1/3 c sesame oil and 2/3 c vegetable oil, which gave it a bit of a nutty flavor but didn't overpower the miso.  I also grated some fresh ginger into it, and have been enjoying it ever since!

This dressing is too watery. The taste is good, but watered down. Next time I will add water as needed.

Instead of vegetable oil, I used 1/2 c of sesame oil and 1/2 c of peanut oil. I also added a few drops of toasted sesame oil, which can be quite strong so I was careful with the amount. I grated some ginger into the dressing, too. Those were the only modifications I made. Great dressing.
