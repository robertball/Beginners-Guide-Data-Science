Exactly what the title says. Made this but substituted 2 minced cloves of fresh garlic for garlic salt, and added some previously-cooked chicken.

Delicious!

Very GOOD!  Easy, quick and healthy!  I had to use the "green jarred" parmaesan cheese and it was good, but for sure next time I will use freshly grated parmesan.  I served this with Braised Balsamic Chicken recipe.  Will make again.

I cook my spinach this way all the time but do not cover it. I heat the O oil with a tsp of butter for flavor, saute a chopped clove of garlic in the oil mixture, add the spinach, add a few pinches of kosher salt & fresh cracked pepper, continue sauteing till spinach has barely wilted, then squeeze the juice of 1/2 small lemon over all.  Stir gently to distribute the lemon juice, remove from heat. Sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan or asiago cheese.

This would have been really good... but seriously, that is wayyyy too much garlic salt for us. I *halved* the amount and it was still really salty. Next time I will use garlic powder and just a tiny dash of salt. Thanks :)

This is a great way to cook spinach. I grew up eating it popeye style- out of a can all watery with butter. Lol! This is so good and healthy! I used minced garlic and fresh spinach from the roadstand. You just pile it up in the skillet and it cooks down with just a little olive oil like cabbage. So good!5/6 UPDATE- Last night i made this again but with fresh garlic sliced very thin-even better!

This was fantastic!  I will always make spinach like this from now on.  When I read the recipe, I thought 10 mins would be too long and make the spinach mushy, but it was perfect.  I used 2 cloves of chopped fresh garlic (instead of the salt) and added that as soon as the oil heated up, and then sauteed it for about 1 minute to release the flavor before I added the spinach.  My husband who hates the "spinach" flavor of this vegetable, ate his whole serving for once.

Really easy and great flavor! Instead of garlic salt I used fresh garlic and added a little sea salt. It was perfect over spaghetti.

Deeeelicious spinach side!  I sauteed with 4 cloves of fresh garlic, chopped, instead of using garlic salt, and let my family add the parm to their individual portions.  Great recipe~ thanks Denee! =)

This is really good. Used fresh garlic and freshly grated Parmesan.  10 ounces of spinach cooks down to a little over 1 serving.  Need a lot more spinach for multiple servings.

This was so easy! Thanks! Hubby asked for seconds (not fan of spinach). I did use fresh minced garlic in place of the garlic salt. Delish!!

Ten minutes is far too long to cook this!  Add the spinach a handful at a time, quickly tossing with tongs and adding another handful as the spinach wilts. Eliminate the garlic salt and use fresh minced garlic toward the end (so as not to burn it) for best flavor.

This was a perfect way to use up 2 bags of fresh organic spinach! Added 1 Tablespoon of minced garlic to the olive oil. Used Hymilayan Sea Salt instead of garlic salt. Delicious!

this recipe is delicious.  only downside is that i ate the whole thing myself....4 super tiny servings.  looks like a lot when you throw the whole bag in the pan...but it shrinks down so much.  good thing i'm the only one who likes spinach in the house :)  anyway if you're looking to make 4 decent sized servings, you should definitely double the recipe.

I had no idea that Sauteed Spinach was so easy! I was a little scared to use all of the spinach I had so I only made a half-batch. I couldn't believe how much it shrank down, so next time I will just go for it. I also added quartered white mushrooms and liked the combination, left out the parmesean cheese and sprinkled some fresh lemon juice on after cooking. A tasty, fast, healthy dish.

I give this recipe 5 stars not just because of the taste, but because it hits my other high-priority criteria for a 5-star recipe: tasty, inexpensive, healthy, and fast!  The first time I made it exactly as recipe states. Second time I sauteed some minced garlic (also from a jar) with some thinly sliced onions, then dumped in all the spinach.   didn't have fresh grated Parmesan so I used the "green-jarred" stuff another reviewer mentioned. I sprinkled in the just before serving so it would "melt' and not be gritty.  Kids still loved it. I'm grateful for quick and easy recipes like this one, as I try to transition to a healthier lifestyle for my family and me.

Simple & perfect!  Thank you for the recipe!  I used 1 clove fresh sliced garlic tossed into the oil before the spinach, & a pinch of sea salt sprinkled on after the spinach starts to wilt, instead of the garlic salt.  We loved it!  Sauteed spinach is such a quick, healthy, & beautiful side dish.  :)

It is not that much more work to use fresh sliced garlic, so that's what I did. I used three cloves and let it cook in the oil before adding the spinach.  When the garlic pieces started to sizzle, I added the spinach leaves and salt.

Used 2 small garlic cloves instead of garlic salt and it was perfect. Should have used more fresh spinach as I forgot how much it shrinks. Will definitely make again. So quick and healthy!

Way too much garlic salt. I cut down to 1/2 tsp and it still was a bit too much. Garlic powder or fresh garlic would be a better choice and then add just a pinch of salt

Just needed the actual cooking instructions, and this was perfect. WAAAAAAY TOO SALTY though. I literally used half the amount of salt and we could barely eat it. Next time I'll just use a dash of salt and some garlic cloves, or even just some salted butter.
Thank you! :)

This recipe was simple and very tasty. I used minced garlic in olive oil instead of garlic salt. I felt the parmesan cheese would give it a little kick and I was right. Delicious!  Thank you for sharing.

I didn't care for the very oily taste and texture of this dish.  Perhaps sauteeing the spinach in butter would work better.  I used garlic powder and a little bit of salt instead of garlic salt.

This is a great recipe especially  for people who like a lot of salt . I chose to leave salt out since I don't and it was fine for me. Wonderful, in fact. I did use a clove of fresh garlic. Thanks so much for the recipe! I have never cooked spinach before, just ate it raw in salads.If I hadn't seen this recipe I probably still would not have cooked it. I will now!

4 stars because fresh garlic is better.  Sauteed garlic in oil, sprinkled with sea salt. Balsamic is critical!

An average way to eat it, but still tastes good. Add feta if you don't have parmesan.

Way too salty!  Sprinkle a little salt and some garlic powder.  Also, 10 oz of spinach looks big in the pan, but after cooking, there is no way it could serve 4 people.  With less salt, I will try again.

I followed other reviewers and replaced the garlic salt with a clove of fresh minced garlic, sauteed a bit before adding the spinach. Watch the salt, though...after it's all concentrated and wilted down, the few turns of ground salt I added was a bit too much. It was easy, tasty and fast...will definitely make again.

Made it exactly the way the recipe stated. It tasted so salty, we could not eat it. I ended up throwing the whole thing away. I even used less garlic salt. I was so upset

The cooking method is fine but it is WAY too much garlic salt.  I was in a hurry and did not read the critical reviews like I normally do.  I had half the amount of spinach so I halved the garlic salt but I should've at least quartered it.  After the fact I notice that most of the high reviews say that they used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt (they didn't follow the recipe).  Even my husband who is a salt fiend and adds salt to everything thought it was way to salty.

This was so good I can't even stop thinking about it. Sauteed two cloves of minced garlic in the heated oil, after a minute I added about 8 oz spinach (about half of a big container from Sam's), a few turns each of freshly ground pepper and sea salt, covered for 5 minutes as directed, tossed around, covered and cooked for another five minutes and then sprinkled some shaved parm on there. So. Freaking. Good. This amount was enough for my husband, 4 year old (who took one bite, said it was delicious and didn't touch it again) and me. After dinner, I scraped all the crispy little pieces of spinach stuck to the pan and ate them - fantastic! If only I could figure out a way to get it all crisped up like that. As it is, still delicious. Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

Exactly as title says--quick and easy, and very tasty. Totally no hassle. Used minced garlic (the kind in the glass jar) instead of garlic salt and used enough olive oil to fully coat the frying pan, which was more than 1 tbsp. Also added a little onion salt. Also, used shredded Parmesan that you buy in the bag like other shredded cheeses. Husband (not a veggie lover) and  6 year old child both liked it too.

Easy, healthy and yummy. I sprinkled garlic powder instead of using that much garlic salt. I also skipped the parmesan cheese. Maybe next time I will add it. Paired it with steak and mushrooms.

We didn't like this alot, but I think, like others had done, using fresh garlic would be really good. Also, 1 bag of spinach isn't alot once it's cooked, I'd use 2-3 bags of it if you have 4-5 people who love spinach :)

easy, quick and delicious side dish. I used organic spinach, which quickly cooked down in 1 T olive oil. I then added one fresh garlic, chopped. I did not use any garlic salt. After reading what other reviewers wrote, I decided to use a little sprinkle sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. I love spinach and this had such great flavor. I wish I had more spinach but next time I can always double up.  This complimented my, "Alaskan Salmon Bake with Pecan Coating," and "Mushroom Rice," from this website. I will use this recipe again in the future.

Yum!  I made this with fresh garlic sliced super thin.  I added a little garlic salt halfway through cooking.  Also, I cooked for about 7 minutes because I like my spinach to be on the fresher side.

This is a very easy recipe, and I like the idea of combining olive oil, garlic, spinach, and parmesan. However, it is much too salty for me (and I love both garlic and salt!) I almost could not finish it. Granted I did not use the entire bag of spinach (almost) - but I also only used one tsp of garlic salt. I think next time I will cut way back on the garlic salt or use fresh garlic as others have suggested.

This is one of my favorite quick and easy weeknight meals.  Only change I made was fresh garlic substituted for garlic salt.  Serve it alongside or over top of jasmine rice with a little soy sauce and it is Heaven!

What a great recipe.  I'm so glad I found it. I can't tell you how many times I've tossed out open bags of spinach because I didn't get it used up before it went bad.  This is so quick, easy, and tasty that I no longer have an excuse to let my spinach go bad.

Oh my gosh!  Probably the best and most flavorful spinach I have ever had.  Loved the garlic flavor, although I had to sub garlic powder and salt in place of teh garlic salt.  My new spinach recipe, for sure.

Very yummy and easy!  Followed the recipe exactly, just did it on the grill instead of the stove (since the grill was already fired up, and it was too hot to heat up the kitchen).  Put the spinach in a big pan, and put it on the top rack of the grill.  Definately use "real" parm cheese!  Thank you!

Great way to use up bagged spinach that was about to go bad. I topped it with grated Emmentauler cheese (sp?). I loved this but my kids, who aren't spinach lovers, didn't. I'll make it again next time they're away!

We loved this and will make it many times again! I substituted the garlic salt with two cloves crushed garlic and a couple shakes of sea salt. In the future I may skip the salt altogether, the Parmesan will be plenty of salt for our taste. Excellent!

This recipe had a lot of potential, but it was insanely salty. I didn't even get to add the parmesan because the garlic salt was too much, and cheese on top of that could have caused someone to OD on salt. I will probably attempt this again, but with the tiniest fraction of the garlic salt and a bit more olive oil.

Recipes that are fast and easy are always great, but like others have mentioned, this one is ridiculously salty as written. Managed to salvage it by rinsing it several times with water before adding the cheese. Next time I'll cook some garlic in the oil before adding the spinach,  then add salt to taste. If using garlic salt, I'd suggest starting with half the suggested amount and go from there.

You must try adding a 1/4 cup of Dry Sherry to this during the last few mins.  It's delicious.

Since spinach has a natural tangy taste, I made sure not to over do it with spices. I used minced garlic, 1 table spoon of olive oil, and garlic powder because I didn't have garlic salt. I watch my salt intake, therefore, I used only a pinch of salt. It was very good. I used a 10oz. bag of fresh spinach, which doesn't amount to very much once it is sautéed. You may need two bags if you are cooking for around 4 people. I cooked this for my husband and I and we ate all of it at once, because when it's sautéed it withers. This dish is good and I will make it again and again.

I have prepared spinach this way for years.  Only difference is using fresh garlic near the end (as naples 34102 has already suggested) and giving it a dash or two (according to your heat preference)of red pepper flakes. Fast, easy and delicious!  Thanks Denee!

Salt overboard!
Couldn't eat this as it was so salty and I only put 1 Tsp of the garlic salt in!
I will try this again with fresh garlic and a little sea salt, but as written you can't eat this.

The first time, I made it as is and it was delicious!! I had forgotten that the amount of cooked spinach is about a fourth of what you wash! So I quickly made more and used fresh minced garlic instead of powder. Just as delicious!

This is an Excellent recipe, however for people who keep calling this "healthy"  It NOT!  One TBSP of oil has 15 grams of fat. Please remember that.

I loved this recipe. I did like the other reviewers suggested and used a clove of fresh garlic, salt and pepper to taste. I chopped the garlic fine and sauteed it in the olive oil before adding the spinach.  I had been looking for a recipe that was similar to one of my favorite restaurants and this came as close to it as possible.

Easy, healthy, delish!
The 2nd time I made this I thought it was way too salty and I did not even add the full amt of garlic salt called for.  I also checked it after the first 5 min on med heat and it was browning so I put it on low heat for the last 5 min so it wouldn't be burned.

This was so salty we could hardly eat it the first time, so after I cut the salt, this was amazingly delicious. I was used to canned mushy watery Popeye spinach before and all of us were surprised how much we liked this dish. I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt and just sprinkled a little kosher salt on. Timing was perfect too. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great!  I followed other users advice and used fresh garlic and sauteed it in the pan with the olive oil before adding the spinach.  I typically don't like cooked spinach because its bland but this had lots of flavor - I will be making this again soon for sure!

Loved the taste but too salty for us.  I also made the mistake of leaving the spinach in the pan and adding the cheese there.  It needs to be drained first or moved to a separate serving dish, then add the cheese.  Overall very good though.  Next time I will use fresh garlic or garlic powder and add salt separately.  Thanks!

This has been around for years. It is the basis of most Italian veggie recipes, especially Brocoli Rabe. I use Olive Oil and lots of sliced garlic. I add cannellini beans and saute all for 2 minutes. Then I add a whole bag of fresh bay spinach leaves and toss. Let simmer until spinach is wilted.

I used real minced garlic instead of the salt and skipped on the parmesan to save calories and this was delicious.  I also added a little bit of pepper.

Great recipe.  I used a 6 oz bag and it made 2 servings (I think a 10 oz bag would make about 3 servings).

Very good and easy recipe. I sauteed the spinach with real minced garlic, a dash of salt, and also added sun-dried tomatoes. I put this over turkey burgers and sprinkled shaved parmesan cheese on top. Exactly what I had envisioned! Healthy too!

Great recipe. I agree with other reviews, it didn't need to cook nearly as long as the recipe said. I also found it salty and will cut the salt by about 1/2 next time, but it was really good!

Quite good and very simple. Thanks for the recipe. I found I had to saute the spinach for less than the recommended time as I prefer it to be more lighly sauteed than mushy. Ingredient combo, however, was perfect! Again, simple and delicious. Thanks!

SO easy, and very tasty! The spinach was not dry at all.  It was a little too salty with the amount of garlic salt suggested. I'd cut it in half next time. We will definitely be using this recipe very often!

My family and I are in the midst of a diet change, so we are adding veggies to atleast one meal a day.  This was awesome.  It was scarfed down by a 3, 9, 10 and two 30 year olds.  I loved the simplicity and flavor.  I think it would even be great without the cheese.  You won't have to threaten anyone to get these greens eaten.

This was so yummy it made my face hurt! I read others say it was too salty so I used garlic powder & my own judgement of how much salt to add. This dish made my wife love me more!

I'm about to cook it again & this time I'm going to use cream cheese. I might wind up with a mess but I bet it will be a delicious mess.

I should've read the reviews before I made it.  It would have been excellent if the garlic salt was substituted for garlic powder or cloves.  Other than that, I actually cooked it in less than 10 minutes.  Next time I make it, I will implement the changes.

I used 2tsp of olive oil and 1tsp of butter. Instead of garlic salt I used minced garlic, with a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cooked for 5m. 10m is too long, I was weary it'll be mushy and brown. Sprinkled a little shredded parmesan just to taste.

I liked it; I had portabella mushrooms and fried those first, then added the greens and garlic and topped with parmesan, salt, and pepper at the end.  I would remake this item.  It was a good side.

Easy enough to make. I served it with the Easy Garlic Lemon Scallops on top, so the sauce served for both. I always forget how much spinach shrinks, so it was good I kept the rest of the container nearby to add it in as the original full pot cooked down. Yum.

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was quick and easy.  I thought the garlic salt and Parmesan was a bit too much sodium.   I’m trying it again but will eliminate the garlic salt and use a little Garlic Powder instead along with the Parmesan.

Way too much garlic for my family. None of us could eat it after the first bite. Next time I’ll use a glove of garlic and a touch of salt.

Really easy with ingredients you have on hand. I made it pretty much as written. Added a touch of corn oil to the EVOO since I used a crushed garlic clove instead of the garlic salt (so the glove wouldn't burn). It didn't need the Parmesan although I think it would add a good flavor. I used the spinach to serve as a bed for the teriyaki pork loin I had prepared. It was really good.

This was the first time I made sauteed spinach. It was so simple because it uses ingredients I already had on hand, and it was delicious! Even my husband, who is a bit fussy with "different" vegetables, enjoyed it!

I wish I would have read the reviews, way too much garlic salt. I would say a dash of garlic salt to start and then season to taste. Some got a little over done. One kid wouldn't eat it because it tasted like mushrooms to him, which I kind of agree with, but I love mushrooms. Good, easy recipe!

I made it!  Delicious and really very simple.  I do not use salt (of any kind), but added some minced garlic.  I will be adding this to my repertoire of weekly meals since it is so tasty and a breeze to make!

I cut the garlic salt to 1 tsp, it was still a little salty for my taste, but my husband liked it. Overall it was a good way to make fresh spinach.

First time I made it: I am not a fan of garlic salt and prefer garlic alone, so next time I make this I will do that. Other than that it was good. 

The second time I made it: I must not have pushed submit or something because I did not see my note from last time. Waaaaay too salty. I was at least smarter the previous time to not put as much garlic salt; I didn't listen to my better judgment this time. We weren't able to eat it. I hope to be able to mix it into something to save it. I am not sure if it is a typo or what in the recipe. If I make it again, I would like to use fresh garlic.

This was amazing! I only sprinkled the garlic salt on so I didn't use that much. It's been hard to find vegetables that isn't potatoes or carrots my husband likes, spinach is one he'll eat mixed into things... He loved it and was sad I only made just enough, he tried stealing mine!! LOL My kid's even enjoyed it. I'm definitely make this again and more of it!!!

I used about 1-1/2 bags of spinach and a couple of shakes of garlic/herb salt - cooked up nicely but was way too salty.  Will make again with less salt.

I thought this was great!  I did sliced fresh garlic and a couple of pinches of kosher salt instead of garlic salt.  I also used 18 oz. of spinach and added a bit of butter to the olive oil for the saute', as I knew it would cook way down. We will definitely make this again!

Too salty.  Would use garlic powder and perhaps a touch of salt.

Simple and delicious. I only let the spinach saute for about 5 min, and it was cooked to my liking. I used two garlic cloves and didn't add them until the spinach was cooking for a few minutes. Topped with some sea salt, black pepper and a tad of parmesan cheese. Nice as part of a light supper on a hot night. Thanks Denee!

I had fresh spinach and didn't know what to do with it.  I found this recipe and it was delicious, I did use fresh garlic and kosher salt.  It is a keeper.

Wayyy to salty, even though I used half garlic salt and half garlic powder. Fresh garlic is really the only option in this, I'd say.

I tossed my baby spinach in garlic-infused olive oil so the leaves would be more evenly coated once in the saute pan. I also splashed in a little seasoned vinegar, garlic powder and a pinch of sea salt. I found 10 minutes was too long for the texture I wanted, so next time, I'll simply heat through (4-5 minutes). I added this spinach, along with some roasted cherry tomatoes, into pesto-tossed angel hair pasta and topped with parmesan cheese. Delish! Will make again with my modifications.

This was really good, but too much garlic salt for our liking!  Next time I will use fresh garlic and if I don't have some on hand, will 1/2 the garlic salt.  Overall, very excited for an easy fresh spinach recipe. Will double next time as well!  Thank you.

I just made this and it was great.  But I think next time I will use fresh spinach.  I used the steam-in-bag frozen spinach and it's so mushy.  I used minced garlic, mixed it in the olive oil (used more than the suggested 1 tbls) added the cooked spinach, then salt and parm cheese.  I then transferred it to a plate and then I scooped the insides of a baked potato out (after topping it with margarine, salt & pepper and letting the margarine melt into the potato) and mashed it up and added it to the spinach plate, mixed it all up, threw in pine nuts, added more parm cheese, mixed it all and topped with additional parm cheese, it was out of this world. It's my new dish to eat while I'm dieting.

Delicious and easy EXCEPT for being way too salty. Next time, I will either use only about 1/2 tsp. garlic salt, or fresh garlic, as others have. (Could the amount in the recipe be wrong?)

Quick, easy and delish!  Heated the oil over medium and threw in minced garlic from the jar.  Added the bag of spinach and covered it for 5 minutes.  Mixed it up, covered for another 5 minutes and then added grated parmesan cheese.  So good!!

I may have done something wrong with this one but my spinach turned out bitter and it needed some salt and pepper. I will try this again just because my husband and I generally love spinach. The parmesan was a wonderful addition to the spinach.

this was a great place to start but had too much oil for me..i used fresh garlic and just added salt and pepper..next time i will use less oil and add red pepper flakes to the garlic and olive oil..but the cheese does add alot of flavor to the spinach..thank you for the recipe!

Really enjoyed it, but will scale back a bit on the olive oil next time as it was a bit too much for my tastes.

I love this type of recipe.  Not only does it taste good but if you eat lots you don't feel guilty because it is good for you. I used frozen spinach becasue that's what I had on hand but I know that fresh spinach would make this recipe 100 times better (especially baby spinach).  I also used fresh garlic instead of the powdered garlic salt and I used kosher salt.  I will definately make this recipe again.

Fast and easy.  I did not have to cook it quite as long as the recipe stated.  I sprinkled mine with some crumbled feta cheese instead of parmesean.  Yum!

As a former "junk food junkie" (lol), I'm making sure that I incorporate veggies into pretty much every meal.  And this (gasp) has to be one of the BEST sides that i have cooked.  easy, fast & yum- there's garlic!  i did alter my version just a little.  i put a teaspoon of dried minced garlic and just a little garlic salt.  Yaaaaay!!!

I'm not really a spinach fan, but hubby is. I needed a really quick recipe to make for supper and found this one. Since we had a bag of spinach in the fridge, I figured I'd try it.   Wow.. I wish I'd made more. Hubby hasn't stopped talking about what a great recipe this is yet, and I also like it. It's one that we'll definitely keep and have again - soon! Thanks for posting this.

This would be very good, but the garlic salt gave it an odd, gritty texture. I think next time I might try fresh, crushed garlic to eliminate the grit.

I love spinach and this is very simple and good!  Spinach basically cooks to nothing, so use at least 16 ounces for two people!

Definitely quick and easy. I used tomato and garlic seasoning since I didnt' have garlic salt. We also added extra olive oil. Keep in mind this doesn't make a lot. A 10 oz bag of spinach is only 2.5 servings max, usually, but it comfortably fed two of us.

Way to go with this recipe!  It just doesn't get any easier than this.  Since I have to control my sodium intake, I used 1 clove of garlic put through the garlic press, sauteed for about 45 seconds before I added the spinach.  I added a pinch of kosher salt and a sprinkling of nutmeg when I stirred it.  The dish was done in less than 10 minutes.  Super side, very tasty!

Yummy!  I used real minced garlic and nutmeg (thanks earlier reviewers) and to my surprise my young children ate it.  I never thought I'd see that day.

Major overdose of salt and that is even after using less than 1/2 of the amount that recipe called for (due to reader reviews).  At most, I would use a pinch of salt, along with fresh garlic slices (thin).  I might try this again and eliminate the salt completely and only use salt at the table.  Additionally, after the garlic is sauteed, the spinach only needs to cook for a couple of minutes.

Very easy and tasted great! I used to stir fry my spinach with a bit of cooking oil and chopped garlic but it always had that spinach-y taste that I didn't like and not suprisingly I never bought spinach very often. Will certainly be eating spinach a lot more from now. Thanks.

I think this preparation is just so-so. And one 10 oz bag of spinach was hardly enough for me and my husband, so I don't know where the "four servings" came from. If you're making this for a family, definitely double the recipe.

Delicious and this from a non-Spinach lover. I served mine with pasta so I didn't use the cheese because put cheese on the pasta, but I can see how this would be really good and had never thought of it before. Had some leftover bacon from night before and I crumbled it in for the oil, this was pretty dang tasty too. Only thing was my spinach shrunk tons and was all cooked in about...3 minutes, not ten.
