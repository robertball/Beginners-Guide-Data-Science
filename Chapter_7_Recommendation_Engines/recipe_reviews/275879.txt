I have made half a recipe twice now, both times using the exact ingredients called for.  The first time it didn't work for me at all, but the second time I had success.  Let me explain.  The first time I followed the directions as written except that when I checked them after the first 15 minutes of baking at 400 degrees, they were already overcooked!!  So the next day I followed the way I have usually made yeast rolls:  I let the dough rise for about half an hour before I separated them into the mini-pie tins. (The first time I made 9 buns, but they were so small that my hamburger meat would not have fit.  The second time I made the half recipe into 6 buns, and they were a great size.)  Then I let them rise in the oven with only the oven light on for about half an hour.  I then used an egg wash before sprinkling with sesame seeds (so that they would stay on this time).  I baked them at 375 degrees for about 17 minutes and they were perfectly done.  .  The gluten-free part of my family was grateful for their hamburgers with actual yeast buns!!  So I am giving this just an OK if you follow the recipe but I'd have given them a 5 if I used my own directions.

I rated this a 4, even though I haven't tried it yet, because I have a question: Are the pie tins necessary, or could you just shape the dough into circles on a cookie sheet? If so, would the oven temperature or baking time change? Thank you. I can't wait to try these for my GF husband!
