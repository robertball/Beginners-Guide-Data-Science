I made double the recipe and used frozen peas and served it over basmati rice, it was delicious! even my 2 picky eater sisters loved it!

NOTE: If you are using fresh peas they might take very long to cook because of the acidity of the tomatoes so you could either boil them first abit then add them in or use frozen peas that have been soaked in hot water for abit!

Love this recipe.  Peas are a big favorite, as are Indian dishes.  I used frozen peas and was very careful not to overcook.  I like things spicy, so I did add a little more heat, but not so much that I covered the sweetness of the peas.

Delicious and Easy!  Everyone enjoyed it.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I had to use canned diced tomoatoes since the tomatoes at the vegetable store weren't good - but now I know that the recipe can accommodate either fresh or canned.  Another thing I found - we had some left over today - I tasted it cold and the and the flavors had blended in even more.  This is a recipe I know I can do a day ahead now and serve cold during the summer.  Thanks Gayathri!

Great simple dish, and a nice way to use the abundant harvest of fresh peas.  I'm sure frozen would work as well.  I used double the coconut milk, and still thought I needed a bit more liquid, so added a splash of vegetable broth.  Served it over coconut rice (basmati rice cooked in coconut milk and turmeric) and it was great.

I really enjoyed this dish, but I took others' advice and added more coconut milk and I also used pure chile pepper powder and added more. I, too, used frozen peas, and it worked out great.

For a pound of peas, I would have preferred about double the amount of sauce that these measurements yielded. Though the recipe calls for a pound of pea PODS, which might have yielded a half pound of actual peas... sadly I didn't note that before pouring an entire pound bag of peas in. (yes, I used frozen.)  The spice mix smelled fantastic when I started cooking, but it really didn't translate into a good flavor, or at least not as good as it smelled.

Great recipe.  I love curries, but was never able to get this "Indian Restaurant Food Flavor" into my veggie curries.  Well, this one did it... I think it was the cinnamon.  I replace the chili powder with mild curry, though, cause I have a little boy who can't eat too spicy.  Still, super recipe!!!!

I doubled or tripled the spices (didn't really measure).  I also added about 1/2 tsp of dried dill.  I used a 540ml canned tomatoes and a 398ml can of peas.   Once it had simmered for a bit, i thickened it with about a 1/4cup of cornstarch.

I didn't think this turned out right...it was flavorless at first so I doubled the coconut milk and spices and it still wasn't very good.

This was okay.  Very simple to make, but not nearly as flavourful as I was expecting.  I did use about 1 tsp cinnamon since I didn't have a cinnamon stick, and I used frozen peas.  I added about 1tbsp curry powder.  I don't think I'll make this again.

Easy to fix and good taste. I used frozen peas and ended up adding about twice the quantity of coconut milk than suggested in order to get some flavor. Perhaps I should try another brand.

Really lovely! I had to use vegetable oil because I didn't have ginger oil, and frozen peas. I also reduced the chili to 1/8 teaspoon (after scaling down to 1 serving). This was fantastic with chappatis!

We had to use frozen peas instead of fresh, but this still turned out well.  Fresh, authentic flavor; delicious over jasmine or basmati rice.

Turned out great. Very easy and makes for an unusual side dish. I made it for a turkey dinner and it was a big hit, so much nicer than just some boiled carrots!

Big hit! I used canned roasted tomatoes and frozen peas. Make sure to thaw the frozen peas and drain well beforehand.

What a great and easy recipe for peas! I used what I had in my pantry (ground cinnamon, no stick, etc.), including Rotel in lieu of chopped tomatoes -- which was a great substitution, by the way... This is a great use of stuff I typically keep around the house. Thanks.

Great flavor, but be careful of overcooking the peas.  Mine came out a little mushy.
