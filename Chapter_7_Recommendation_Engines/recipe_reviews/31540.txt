Here is the problem with this recipe as written -- it should be 1 Tablespoon FRESH thyme OR 1 teaspoon dried. Dried herbs are much stronger. I thought this was fabulous modified, though!

This is not the recipe that I submitted.  The recipe does not need this much thyme.

This is really good! I caramelized onions and added some minced garlice with the butter and then added the rice.I finished off with some paramsan cheese and it was fantastic! The cheese really went well with the lemon! My picky bf simply adores it!

Simple goodness.  Quiet and understated, and the perfect side dish for "Tilapia Scampi," also from this site.  Did not measure precisely, but to my own tastes.

Awesome. As another reviewer suggested, if using dried herbs, it will be 1 tsp as opposed to 1 tbsp. Goes great with the Chicken Piccata (also from this website).  Will maybe use jasmine rice next time.

Terrific recipe with some slight modifications!  I increased lemon to 3-4 tbl, reduced thyme to 1 tsp, added 1 tsp onion powder and some fresh garlic.  My DH devoured everything left in the pan!  I served it with salmon and the lemon was a great accompaniment.  Thanks so much!

This is a keeper - Hubby loved it.  It isn't real lemony - you could add lemon zest to up the flavor but we really liked this as is.  I did use fresh thyme - 4 -5 sprigs.  Delicious and light!

This recipe is just a nice, fluffy white rice with a VERY strong Thyme flavor.  I doubt I will make it again. I like thyme but it was too much and too plain.

This was good AFTER I made additions to it.  At first, I didn't like it too much at all, but then I added some crushed garlic & some fresh chopped parsley and it started to grow on me.  I will make this again, but with my additions & some chopped carrots and maybe using brown rice.  Thanks Lyn!

This is a fantastic  recipe. Reduce the thyme a bit otherwise add basil which is what I normally do. This rice has a great, light flavor to it and I make this frequently in  my home. I like to add fresh cracked pepper to the top of mine just before serving. Be careful not to add too much lemon or it could ruin the recipe. I doubled this, recently, and took it to a barbeque and everyone wanted to know what the recipe was.

I think the key to this recipe is determining the right amount of lemon juice to add.  Too little and you can't taste any lemon flavor; too much and it gives the rice an unpleasant sour taste.  I've found that 3-4 tablespoons works best for me.  I also prefer using fresh thyme rather than dried for this recipe.

Great side dish that easy to prepare and doesn't require a ton of ingredients!  I cut the dried thyme back to 1 tsp., added a little salt and pepper along with some lemon zest.  Overall, very tasty!

Very tasty. It reminded me of rice pilaf from a fancy restaurant. With that being said, I read quite a few reviews first. The first mentioned that the 1 Tblsp. of thyme should be fresh thyme or 1 tsp. of dried. The 5 star reviews seemed to come from people who added the thyme to taste. So, I did that also. I decided to go with 1/4 tsp. dried. It seemed to be the perfect amount and the lemon still shined though which was a complaint of some others. Anymore than the 1/4 tsp. to me would have been way too much. I also did use my own broth. I served the rice with broiled flank steak. It made for a delicious meal tonight. Note: my rating is based purely on the reduced thyme version I made.

This recipe is delicious IF you make modifications.  I added much more lemon juice (the juice of 2 lemons) and instead of thyme I used Italian seasonings.  I make this "modified" version all the time and it is delicious.

This rice is exceptional.  I made some minor additions and substitutions:  First, I used basmati instead of white rice; I added a little more butter to the saucepan and briefly saut√©ed 1/2 c. chopped onion before adding and cooking the rice; I used only 3/4 tsp. dried, crushed thyme (I felt using more would be too overpowering); and, finally, I finished it with a little grated Parmesan.  This was the perfect accompaniment to my Chicken Piccata.  Next time I make this I may add some finely grated lemon zest to give it an even more lemony zing.

I ONLY make rice in the rice cooker nowadays because it always turns out perfect. But I added the chicken broth, FRESH thyme and lemon juice to the cooker and it came out fabulous =)

Rice was good. I wish I could give it a five star but because I cooked this on a gas stove and it got a little brownish to black it was hard to tell the taste. It was fluffy and I could smell the aroma of lemon and thyme.

This is a 5 star side dish once you change the amount of dried thyme to 1 tsp.  We absolutely loved it!  The Hubster said he would eat this rice again and again and again.  I used the juice of one lemon and it was the perfect amount for us, so just eyeball it!  Always looking for new ways to use the lemons from the lemon tree, so thank you so much for this recipe!  :)

I'd give this five stars but I didn't follow it exactly. I added about 1/3 cup of frozen sweet peas and some salt and pepper.  I used a bullion cube and water instead of broth, BUT I loved this! I served it with homemade chicken tenders for a quick and easy dinner for two.  If I have company I can see this being served with grilled salmon and grilled corn on the cob!  Awesome way to dress up boring white rice other than soy sauce! and the ingredients are usually in my pantry already

Awesome!  I'm always on the lookout for a rice dish that is versatile AND yummy.  I haven't found many.  THIS is definitely one though!  I love it and I'm sure I'll be using it frequently.  Tonight I served it with salmon, but can see it side-lining chicken, pork, other types of fish, and even beef.

This is a nice recipe - after reading other people's comments, I reduced the thyme to one tsp.  The flavor wasn't too strong.  I liked it.

Made this a couple of days ago to compliment baked fish. It was very good, thanks! I will make again. My SIL gave me some fresh thyme and I used that instead of the dried. Ease of preparation, had all the ingredients on hand. Might have needed a little salt included in the prep. Thanks for the recipe!

I think this is delicious when you use the original recipe amount of 1 tsp. of dried thyme or 1 T. of fresh thyme.  I always use vegetable broth instead of chicken, since I am vegetarian.  I added a little garlic to the butter, as well, and doubled the lemon juice.  I have made this with brown rice and with a wild rice blend; both were excellent.

A great start.  I also minced onions, sauted with garlic, and then used sticky rice.  Added fresh thyme (retrieved from storage in freezer) and served with garish of green onion.  Took the rice from the pot, used a small bowl and then inverted the rice, from the bowl onto the plate for a great restaurant-style presentation.

Greate recipe. Doubled the lime, reduced the thyme and we all were fine :-)

Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I saw that people were saying there was a typo in the ingredient list - 1 tsp of thyme instead of 1 tb - and corrected for that. It turned out awesome! It tastes like a heavy-rice version of my home made chicken soup. Probably because of the thyme. I think I'll make it frequently for my family, but I'll make it with brown rice for myself to get a nice rich taste.
The recipe is great on it's own, but it also is open for easy and delicious tinkering options. A good dish to throw in bits of leftover veggies or chicken.

My husband loved this recipe and generally getting him to eat something that isn't really bad for you is difficult.  I added some garlic with the rice right right in the beginning and stirred constantly to keep that from burning.  At the very I added about 2 teas to a tablespoon of parmesan cheese.  It added a great salty flavor.

Cut the tbsp. of thyme down to a tsp. and added garlic. I served this with leftover Braised Pork Ragu from the night before. Complimented it very well.

Read the reviews and only added 1 TEASPOON of thyme. I was out of broth so i made some out of chicken bouillon cubes and water. I also added some sauted onion and garlic with the butter. It turned out great. We topped with parmesan cheese. So delicious!

This recipe was good.  Next time, I will use less thyme and more lemon.  My husband and I enjoyed this recipe with mint chicken submitted by TXGIRLSX3.  Will make this again.

nice idea, especially with wild rice.  i give it 3 stars because i made a lot of changes - wild instead of white rice, dill instead of thyme, and then followed the liquid amounts on the wild rice package.  the end result was good and went well with the baked salmon dijon, also on allrecipes.

What a wonderful change from plain white rice.  I served this with fresh dover sole and it was delicious.  I sauteed the rice with two cloves of pressed garlic, used fresh thyme and 2 cups of vegetable broth.   The rice came out perfect.  This one's a keeper.

Delicious and easy to make.  Other than using 1 tsp of dried thyme instead of 1 tbsp of thyme, I made the recipe as is.

I made this as recipe calls except I reduced dried thyme to 1 tsp instead, as I knew a Tbsp would be too much.  Flavor was good enough to try again but I think I'll add a little garlic next time as that is a staple to most recipes in my house.  I'll also try adding a little more lemon so that it can be tasted.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Everyone is right--1 TEASPOON of dried thyme is just right. I liked the basic flavor of this rice, but I definitely found myself wanting more lemon taste (As it was, I did 1.5x what the recipe calls for). I'd definitely make this again, but I wouldn't be quite so citrus-shy.

Loved it! Did make a few alterations: used gluten free rice and Earth Balance butter (can't have dairy), and added lemon zest from the whole lemon. Drastically changes the taste! You got to try with lemon zest!!

I did not find the flavor of this dish appetizing at all. Also, using only 14.5 oz. of liquid leaves the rice firm and the thyme (I used only 1 tsp. dried) overwhelmed any lemon flavor.

It was average....but I can't really say since i followed what other people said and just used 1 tsp dried thyme rather than 1 tbsp dried thyme, since I thought that was just a typo of fresh instead of thyme. And definitely saute some onions/garlic cloves before adding in the rice, it will taste a lot nicer

This was ok.  I read the reviews and only used 1 tsp. thyme.  I couldn't really taste the lemon in this.  It was easy to do though.  I used brown rice, just increased cooking time to around 40 minutes.

This tastes so good for the small amount of work required.... I just throw everything in the pot and stir, no harder than making regular white rice! The chicken broth & lemon flavor the rice so nicely and the thyme is perfect. I serve this with chicken and seafood dishes all the time as a side, it's always a hit. Doesnt do too bad reheated the next day with the leftovers, either! Thanks!

This is a nice recipe.  I served it with fish and the family ate it all.  I doubled the amount of lemon juice and it still wasn't as lemony as I would have liked it to be.  I think I'll add some lemon zest next time.

Used Trader Joe‚Äôs brown jasmine rice (1 Cup)  and 2 cups chicken broth (reduced sodium). Used fresh thyme and fresh lemon juice. Loved the flavour that browning the rice gave it! Will make it again! Thank you!

4 stars for taste, 5 stars for ease! I make this all the time with brown rice, and I use canola oil instead of butter for a dairy free recipe.

I like the flavors involved, but I think it becomes five stars when you add a bit more lemon and cut the dried thyme down to 1 tsp. rather than 1 tbsp. (as others have mentioned). cooking up some diced onion and some garlic in the butter before adding the rice might be a good idea, too.

This was great!! I followed it as stated (except for the required change of 1 tsp vs 1 tbsp thyme) - though I used brown 10 min rice and reduced the time - it was very very good. I will be making it again!

Really nice, my rice did turn out a bit mushy but it was still tasty.  Would also cut down on the butter at the beginning.  Found it a tad too greasy when eating.  Also needs more lemon juice.  Will be making again.

Made this last night to go with a chicken dish! Only difference was I put in the the rice cooker to cook. Other than that I and the fact that I used fresh thyme I followed the recipe to a T. It is to die for! Will be making this again!

Very easy in a rice cooker and flavorful. When the rice is finished in the pan, add it and all remaining ingredients to the rice cooker. Cooks in about 20 minutes. I reduced the thyme to 1/2t and it seems the right amount.

I thought it was great, I did not have chicken stock so I used vegetable broth instead, more on that in a minute.  Outside of that the only other thing I did different was add the zest from the lemon in the begining and as pointed out in previous reviews used a tsp. of dried thyme.  Now as for the vegetable broth I don't think a dish like this needed the extra flavor, next time I make this (which will be soon) I am going to use water and let the lemon and thyme flavors shine through.  Overall I served it with steamed artichokes and it was simply fantastic!

If you have a rice cooker, use it for this recipe!!

I only gave 4/5 stars because it needed modifications.  I used 1 Tbs. of dillweed instead of thyme, and 3-4 Tbs. of lemon juice.  Threw all ingrediants in rice cooker, flip the switch and let the cooker do its thing.  The rice came out with a slightly sticky texture in which I love, but overall I will definitely will be using this one again!!

Made exactly as written, and the thyme is pretty overpowering. Still, we liked it. Will make again, but with half the thyme.

I made this, but with a few adjustments. First, I used lime juice instead of lemon; secondly, I substituted cilantro for the thyme, because I am not big on thyme. Fantastic! Definitely will make this again! Also, this would make a great bast for a lot of the cold rice salads served so often in the summer! Yum-thanks!

Very nice twist on steamed rice to go with our grilled chicken.  I seasoned it up a little more before serving with some garlic and onion powder.  This was wonderful the next day with some grated Italian cheese blend and Italian seasoning stirred in.  Love the lemon!

I thought it was great. I made it as a sidedish to a heavily flavored chicken dish so the lite flavor was a perfect compliment.

This was just OK for me...though that may be because I used basmati rice. I doubled the lemon & it still didn't have a very strong lemon flavor. I also decreased the thyme & increased the cook time since I was using basmati. I'll try this again using white rice & see if I don't like it better that way...thanks for letting me try it though.

The thyme in the rice was extremely overpowering and I couldn't even taste the lemon. If I do try it again, I'll cut back the thyme to 1 teaspoon and add more lemon juice.

I made this side dish with some modifications, and my husband really enjoyed it that way. First, I served the rice with steak, so I used beef broth instead of chicken.  I also sauteed 1 large clove of minced garlic in about 2 tbsp of olive oil before adding the rice. Finally, I cut down the quantity of thyme to about 1 tsp and increased the lemon juice to about 3 tbsp. If you enjoy lightly flavored rice, then this is a nice side.

I will make this again but try some of the other poster's ideas for making it more flavorful.  It was good but a little bit bland.  I would have given it 3 stars, but since my kids ate it, it deserves 4.  I plan on using more lemon, some garlic, and italian seasoning next time.  I also wondered about using olive oil instead of the butter when sauteeing the rice.

i thought it was awful.  The thyme was too woody. got in our teeth, and, didn't go well at all with the rice, and there was not a very lemony taste, despite extra lemon.  I will never make this again, and prolly never make lemon, or thyme rice again aither.

I really like this recipe but with a few touch ups. The first time I made the rice I found the thyme a little overwhelming so the next time I made it I cut back. I also added about a half teaspoon of garlic powder. Overall though, I really enjoyed this recipe and will continue to use it.

This did not go over too well in my house.  My husband gagged and said it was terrible, my son ate about half of his, I had a few helpings, but I like most any rice.  It was a little too strong on the thyme I think.  My other children wouldn't touch it.  (They said it smelled bad)

We did not like it at all. It was very bland,I even added garlic and extra lemon juice, to no avail. We all ate a couple of bites and threw away the rest. It made the kitchen full of a wonderful aroma, but that's about it. Too bad,it really sounded great.

Instead of using lemon and Thyme separately I  used fresh Lemon Thyme from my garden and it came out delicious!! Fresh herbs will always have a much better taste than dried!

I made this recipe exactly as written. I used dried thyme. It turned out fantastic and was a welcomed change from our usual white rice.

This is VERY good! The only thing I changed was to add 1/2 of a  garlic clove crushed, and some pine nuts. I made this as a side dish to accompany the Lemon Chicken Piccata also from this site - delicious meal!

I was going to add garlic while frying the rice in butter but forgot. I definitely think it would be tasty. I used water instead of broth and it turned out good although broth would be better! The thyme was not over powering and I added just a tbs. Thanks for the recipe!

This rice was great! The lemon and thyme add wonderful flavor to this, and the rice cooker makes this so simple. I did only add 1 tsp of thyme rather than 1 T. I did follow the rest of the recipe and only put in 1 T. of lemon juice, and thought it could have used more of that. Next time I make this I will add more lemon. All five of us ate this, and liked it so I'm sure it will be made again. Especially since this rice would go with just about any entree (we had it with baked salmon tonight). Thank you for the recipe, LASUG!

I made it this past weekend. I heeded the advise of using only 1 tsp instead of 1 tblsp of dried thyme. It was excellent and enjoyed by all. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe.  Used 1 tsp of dried thyme.  Added some garlic, some fresh ground black pepper and used unsalted butter.  Absolutely delicious.

With the adjustment for dried vs. fresh thyme, this is amazing. I upped my lemon juice to 3 Tbsp.  I sauteed a bit of garlic in the butter and rice on the stove top, then put everything into my rice cooker.  Perfection.

Easy to make and delicious!

Two things I did differently. I rinsed the rice before cooking &
I made it in a rice cooker instead of a saucepan. 

It came out great, and I'll definitely be making this dish again.

I actually really liked this, but I made it in the rice cooker--just turned it on cook to melt the butter, and I used 2 tablespoons of fresh thyme . . .I thought that is what it had said, and I just kept trimming the thyme.  Doesn't really matter, as I have loads of it!  Hubs wasn't even turned off by the lemon flavor, and he's very picky when it comes down to lemon flavor in food. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty, I added a bit more lemon juice to suit our taste and definitely cut the amount of thyme (as everyone else has said). Very easy, will definitely make again.

Great recipe, a perfect compliment to the Murgh Kari curry off this site, I did think the portion size is on the small size, if this is to feed 4 good eaters.  Next time I think I will double the recipe to feed my family of 4.  Only used 1 teaspoon of dried thyme.

This rice is nice!  I only used 1 tsp. thyme.  Don't skip the browning of the rice, I think it really adds something to the flavor.  My rice came out fluffy with a light flavor.  Great as a side to fish!

1 tsp thyme is plenty.  I doubled the lemon juice because we like lemon; but it still needs something.  Good recipe to fool around with.

I used brown rice instead of white and it worked very well - just add ten to fifteen minutes to the simmering time.

I decreased the thyme as others suggested and added a little more lemon juice and I also added garlic and chopped onions to the broth.  Make sure you bring it to a boil before you cover and simmer or it will not be cooked all the way after 20 minutes.  It was really good and easy and I will probably never make plain rice again!

Here's a tip for fantastic presentation: In the broth, put a few drops of yellow food colour before adding. The rice really gets a lovely colour and when I garnished it with dried parsely flakes, it looked amazing!

We love this rice.  Great recipe (with obvious reduction in the thyme as noted by several here including the original chef).  I use medium grain rice for a sticky type of rice.  And, as someone else suggested, I invert a bowl full of rice on a plate or into another bowl for a nice presentation.

I liked this rice a lot - I used brown rice, fresh thyme and bottled lemon juice and it definetely gave it a really nice flavor. I served it with chicken flavored with thyme with a lemon sauce. It all went together really well.

Very very yummy rice, when you are in the mood for something more than sticky white rice.  Mostly it was the broth that gave it the flavor (I used 1 T FRESH thyme and more than 1 T fresh lemon juice and couldn't taste them), but I liked it.  If you have a meat-and-potatoes husband like me, I can assure you he will enjoy it.  :)

Very light and fluffy. I will REDUCE the amount of Thyme to 1 teaspoon. I used low sodium chicken stock and had to sprinkle some salt on the finish product. However, Thank you sooo much for sharing. This is truly a nice touch to plain boring white rice. I will add this to my rotation.

This was delicious. I am lucky enough to have found a lemon thyme plant, so I used fresh lemon thyme from my backyard (about 1 1/2 tbsp), plus about 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice. This wa a lovely side dish, and I will make it often. Thanks you!

This rice was very good & everyone at the table enjoyed it.  The only modification made to the recipe was that I added in an extra tbs of butter when browning the rice.  Enjoyed the nice subtle taste of lemon in with the rice...thanks for sharing!  :)

Nice! Started off with browning some garlic with the butter. Also, added the thyme when the rice was halfway done, and the lemon almost at the end so that there's more flavor. Have made it repeatedly. Was very good with Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken from this site.

This was a decent recipe to compliment the chicken. Cooking it in a skillet makes reduces your cooking time and makes things much easier.

wow, WAY too much dry thyme! Should've read the reviews! I thought it was too much, so I didn't add near as much, but still too strong! 1 teaspoon probably would work, (or 1tblsp  fresh as reviewed)

It would probably be a good thing to modify this recipe page to clarify!

I did not care for this recipe.  One tablespoon dried thyme is probably four times more what one should use...I love strong flavors but this was too much even for me! I ended mixing up some spinach into the mix to make it more palatable, but I will not be making this again, or if I do I will use fresh thyme instead.

I followed other suggestions to use only a teaspoon of dried thyme and the thyme still overpowered the rice.

i like rice and lemon but this recipe wasn't that good so i had to make it my own. instead of boiling the rice in plain water i boiled it in chicken stock or you can use broth which ever one you like. then instead of the teaspoon or tablespoon use one sprig of fresh tyme and put it in the broth with the rice and take the stick out when done. i seen that on rachel ray, and it worked out great. thanks rachel. try it you will enjoy!

Very subtle nice lemon flavor.  Used it as a way to spice up some plain rice I was making as a side dish.  My boyfriend also said he liked it, which doesn't happen much.

This was really good.  I also added 1 tsp of onion powder, and only added about 3/4 tsp of dried thyme.  I was almost out of lemon juice, so I used 1 Tbsp of lemon juice and 2 1/2 Tbsp of lime juice.  Everyone loved it.  My husband said it would be great with dill instead of thyme and served with fish.

I really liked this. I made some changes other reviewers had made.

1 - I used more lemon juice - about 2.5 Tbsp (but I wasn't too exact with that). 2 - I used a random amount of thyme - just eyeballed it - and it was fresh thyme. 3 - I added a bit of garlic powder.

This seemed to take a really long time to cook, but I think it was just my warped pan. Really tasty! I'd make it again.

This rice was very good, but the thyme was just a little too strong for my liking.  Next time I make it I'll either lessen the amount of thyme (maybe by 1/2) or just skip it altogether.  Even so, it was still tasty and goes wonderfully with the Chicken with Lime Butter sauce recipe that can also be found on this site.

If there was a lower score than 1 star, that's what I would give this recipe.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  It didn't smell as good as what I hoped, and it looked even worse.  Everyone in my household looked in the pot and said no way would they eat it because it didn't look or smell appetizing at all.  So, it went in the trash.

This recipe was fabulous!  The flavors were subtle but so good.  I used fresh thyme instead of dried and used just a dash of garlic powder (as per another reviewer's suggestion).  My whole family was sad I hadn't doubled the recipe.  An instant favorite!

If you really like the flavor of thyme, and I mean REALLY like it, then this is the recipe for you. If you kinda like it, look for something else. I made this for a family who just had a baby and served it with a whole chicken. When I taste-tested it, I was really dissapointed and almost didn't take it. I didn't think the four kids would like it. Actually come to think of it, I never got a thank you. Maybe they REALLY didn't like it.

This was really good. I'm on a diet and trying to reduce the sauces etc, that I use, and this worked really well. The rice was flavorful without being overwhelming. I served this with the Charbroiled Salmon recipe here, it worked out very well. I made extra to take to school the next day, and it warmed up just fine.

Light, clean, flavorful. Perfect rice I was looking for. I could see that the amount of thyme might be too much for some, but take note and adjust next time. There will be many more next times for this recipe in our household. Thanks Lyn! :)

I added an extra 1/2 cup of cauliflower broth as I don't like my rice too try.  Any kind of broth that you have would work, I'm sure, like cabbage or broccoli broth.  I did use fresh thyme.

This is a great rice recipe, after making it the second time I decided to cut back on the thyme.  Very savory!
