The name had me. ...What if I could have McDonalds at home?
I first followed the recipe word for word...which ended in burned fries. ( 5-7 minutes for second cook is way too long)
The second batch I watched much closer, cooking only about 2-3 minutes.
The taste was a little too sweet for me , but over all a nice change for homemade fries,  and did remind me a bit of McD's fries.

I thought I would give this recipe a try because of the Mc Donald's claim and because in my own recipe I use sugar water so I thought what the heck I'll give the added corn syrup a try too. I follow the recipe precisely as written. I was disappointed. They were overly sweet.
