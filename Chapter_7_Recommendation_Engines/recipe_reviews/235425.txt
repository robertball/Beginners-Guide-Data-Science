I made this with a pumpkin instead (because that is all I had, frozen since Halloween), and no lime zest (didn't have any on hand), but otherwise followed the recipe. It turned out delicious! What a great way to use up pumpkins after carving them! Will make it again. Even my hubby who had low expectations and no compliments at first agreed it was "rather good" when I caught him at second helping (and maybe third or fourth)! :) Thank you for sharing!

This is so incredibly easy and I was curious about the flavor combination with the lime cream, but admit I didn’t have high expectations.  I’m glad to say I was wrong.  This is delicious and the lime cream is a wonderful compliment to the butternut squash.  The only changes I made were to use my homemade chicken broth because I think it gives added depth of flavor, and processed the soup with my immersion blender.  I’ll be making this again soon.

I didn't do the lime cream exactly because my fiance doesn't like sour cream and it was just for the two of us. Instead I added a random amount of lime juice directly to the soup, and just added plain sour cream to my bowl-- it was great. I did add more garlic than the recipe called for, and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. I'll be making this again.

This soup was easy to make, and delicious. I made it according to the recipe, other than adding about 1/2 cup of coconut water after pureeing it to thin it a bit. This is 4 relatively small servings of soup, not the huge bowls that  many soup recipes call a serving. I used my immersion blender to puree it, rather than the regular blender, which is so much easier. Next time, I might add some herbs, thyme and parsley, perhaps, and maybe a bit of lime right into the soup. Thanks

Our family loved it!  The lime cream sets it apart as exceptional. The only change I made was to add milk to the soup at the end, because it was a bit thick.

My husband and I really liked curried butternut squash soup. The lime was a nice touch. I used chicken broth instead of  beef and added 1/2 teaspoon of Thai red curry paste because my husband likes things spicy, but it is a great recipe with out the addition of the curry paste. It was so easy to make - a keeper.

Yum!  I did need to need more broth, nearly twice as much as indicated, so I increased the spices by 50% as well - I think I had a very large squash.  The second time I added about 1/ cup coconut milk that happened to be sitting in the fridge, and it was great.

I loved it. Maybe my squash was extra large, but I added about twice as much broth and I used chicken broth. I am very generous with my spices and being a little short on curry, I added Garam Masala and extra salt and pepper. It was great.
