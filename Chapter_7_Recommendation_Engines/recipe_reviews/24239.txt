I'm Vietnamese so I was impressed when I saw such a great version of one of my favorite dishes.  For those of you who are willing to add a bit more effort to make the rolls even that much more "authentic" here are some suggestions:  along with the shrimp, add some boiled pork that's thinly sliced. As well as some sprouts, shredded carrot and a long thinly sliced piece of cucumber.  

And for an easy and excellent peanut dipping sauce, mix 1 part crunchy peanut butter to 2 parts hoisin sauce.  Whisk over medium heat until blended, adding a few splashes of water to make the sauce less thick.  This sauce truly MAKES the dish!  Hope this was helpful!

This was so similar to a cooking class recipe that I lost that I just had to try it.  I simplified the recipe by mixing the softened rice noodles with fish sauce (for flavor), and omitting the basil and mint.  I added grated fresh carrots to the rolls for extra color and flavor.  One of the tips I learned in the cooking class was to layer the ingredients for color and a good presentation.  On the bottom end of the softened wrapper, place a leaf of lettuce, cut into two pieces, so that it lies flat.  Top with shredded carrots, then rice noodles, then cilantro leaves.  Just above this stack of ingredients, lay the split shrimp in a line.  By doing this, the shrimp will be visible through the transparent wrapper, when the rolls are served.  Diagonally slice off the uneven ends of the roll, and make a diagonal cut through the roll, dividing it into two pieces.  By doing this, the beautiful green, orange, and white fillings are displayed.  

I served my rolls with a peanut dipping sauce.  It was very, very good!  The next day, I mixed the leftover rice noodles with fish sauce, shredded carrots, cooked shrimp, cilantro, peanut sauce, and chopped lettuce for a tasty and easy cold main dish.

These fresh spring rolls are delicious!  Don't be intimidated by the rice paper wrappers.  Soak them one at a time in warm water until they are JUST soft then remove it to a paper towel and fill.  The wrap will continue to soften.  By the time you are finished adding the ingredients, it will be ready to roll. If you don't have ALL the ingredients called for in this recipe, please don't let that stop you from using what you do have and enjoying every bite.

Spring rolls are my absolute favorite Vietnamese food.  Apparently, people have different versions of the dipping sauce.  In our family (and yes, we're Vietnamese), we make a peanut-hoisin dipping sauce.  We NEVER use a fish sauce for spring rolls.  In a sauce pan, heat up one can of coconut soda (don't worry if you can't find this, I've subbed a can of 7-up or Sprite with the same result albeit with a slightly different taste), about 3 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter, and about 6 tablespoons of hoisin sauce.  Whisk until all the peanut butter melts.  Simmer.  (Taste it & add more hoisin or peanut butter to suite your tastebuds.)  Put a tablespoon of cornstarch into a mug, add water, & mix.  Slowly add this to the simmering pot to thicken the sauce to your desired consistency - the sauce should have a consistency like gravy.  This will make lots of sauce.  Cool before serving.  Top with crushed peanuts.  In our family, 8 spring rolls does NOT equal 8 servings.  Seriously, we each eat 3-4 of these as a meal.   So that's enough sauce for everyone (well, sometimes, because some of us like the sauce so much, we practically drink the sauce!) UPDATED NOTE:  I made 40 of these today for our party.  When we make lots of these, it helps to take all the greens and chop it all up together; then I can grab 1 handful and get all the veggies at once.  Also, we use slivered cucumbers - adds an extra crunch. Cucumber slices + peanut-hoisin sauce = heaven!  Trust me on that one.

Brought this to a neighborhood gathering and simplified it since I only had a few minutes to get it ready.  I bought the rice vermicelli and rice wrappers at the local asian store.  I also found rib eye very thinly sliced which is usually used for Korean bulgogi.  I marinated the beef in the soy and ginger rib eye marinade I also found on this website (I added more soy sauce and red pepper to the original recipe to add a bit of kick to it.)  Instead of getting all the different herbs, I grabbed a fancy salad mix with baby spinach, arugula and radicchio.  I stirfried the beef, boiled the water for the vermicelli and then saved that same hot water to put the rice wrappers in one by one to soften.  These rolls disppeared first off the picnic table - perfect for a warm summer evening.  So many people asked me for the recipe and they couldn't believe that I did this all within half an hour!

So delicious!

If unable to find Thai basil, just add more cilantro and mint.

Method for softening Rice Paper:  alternate between sheets of wet paper towels.  Within 3 minutes they will be soft enough to handle but not so soft that they disintegrate.

Method for rolling:When rolling, don't start by covering the contents then pulling in.  Rather, cover half the contents, then pull in and roll.  This makes them firmer, and a lot easier to eat.

These rolls were great the same day I made them.  They still tasted good the next day, but they started to get a little sticky.  If you are serving them to company, make them fresh.

An explosion of flavour!
My suggestions:
Soak the rice 'Angel Hair' noodles in hot water until soft and white, if you boil them, they turn out soggy. Rinse the noodles in cold water, drain and they are done. Don't chop the herbs up, use whole leaves. Too easy to use too much if it's all chopped up. People have teeth! They can chew!
The wrappers need to be simply dipped into warm water, one at a time, and taken out. Place on a clean, plastic cutting board. They will still be hard. Do not fret! By the time you have put the ingredients on, they will have softened up!
Think of the centre of the rice paper wrapper as the 'top' of the finished roll. Place six shrimp halves (or sliced chicken, pork or tofu pieces) pink side down in a horizontal line. Around this place 6-10 cilantro leaves flat on the wrapper so they show through. On top of the shrimp/meat/tofu place the mint leaves and the basil leaves. Then an oblong nest of noodles. Then some shredded carrot and mung bean sprouts. (Forget the lettuce.) Finally some paper-thin slices of unpeeled English (hothouse) cucumber. You will have a manageable shape that is easier to roll. Roll up as you would do a burrito. Beautiful!
I use a dipping sauce that is 2 parts smooth peanut butter, 1 part Hoisin sauce, whizzed with 4-6 cloves fresh garlic, a splodge of chili-garlic sauce, a lot of fresh lime juice and a bit of cold water to thin out.
Note! These ''Rouleaux de Printemps'' are NEVER deep-fat fried!

I believe you are missing a few things, but it's ok overall. Carrot or jicama or even daikon for crunch is much needed in your recipe. I would double the shrimp in your rolls, so every bite has some shrimp in it. Also, your hoisin based sauce is the more appropriate one, but you should add some peanut butter and water to it, to give it better depth of flavor. The hoisin by itself can be a bit overpowering.

These came out so pretty! Unless you have monster prawns, I'd double or triple the shrimp (you need 2-3 per roll of the 20-per-pound shrimp). My grocery store (Kroger) sells rounds of pre-made cocktail shrimp, which made this very easy. Didn't use the lettuce, but varied the herbs and carrots. Suggestions: try not to overload with noodles (and I added soy sauce when cooking those for flavor); you're slicing the shrimp lengthwise; and the tea kettle of hot water worked great to keep the wrapping water hot. I think some of the folks having problems with tearing wrappers may have been leaving the wrapper in the water until it is soft. It really, really only needs to be submerged and pulled out immediately--I promise. It will get softer as it sits. Also, I had better luck wrapping by putting the ingredients in a neat shrimp-down pile off center of the round wrapper. Fold up the two short ends, and tuck their corners into the ingredients (you're looking for a rounded edge, not a square one like in gift wrapping), then use the shorter of the long sides to wrap over the ingredients and the longer one to pull them all together. The fish sauce was great (oh, but that smell); didn't get around to the hoisin.

This is a really simple recipe. I added grated carrots and bean sprouts and used tofu rather than shrimp. Also, I added a spoonful of peanut butter to the hoisin dipping sauce. Everything turned out great.

Fabulous.  Make sure you use Thai basil (also known as Siam basil or licorice basil in some places).  It makes all the difference.  Everything about this recipe is authentic and delicious.  This is my all-time favorite Vietnamese/Thai appetizer.

Excellent taste and they make a pleasing presentation with the colorful filling.  I did have trouble making the rolls tight and uniform at first, but will practice more.  I had one left over and saved it in waxed paper overnight in the fridge.  It was even better.  Not mushy at all.

I am vietnamese and had this numberous times. I simplify and yet keep it authentic with a few twists to this version. As another reviewer noted, must add boiled pork cut thin. for greens I used a prebagged/prewashed mixed green salad bag from the grocery store. cilantro is a must, as well as a cucumber and celery spear. celery may be about a 5th or so of a standard piece of celery.As well as a strand or two of green onion running the length of the roll. As far as the hoisin, we always added lime and fresh chili to the hoisin and then topped with toasted crushed peanuts. WE NEVER served it with fish sauce. Might be a my family thing, but even when I order these from the local restaurants they only serve it with Hoisin the way I mentioned. Great basic recipe. Great light lunch/dinner not just an appetizer.

Super yummy and very easy to make! The most time-consuming part was chopping the fresh herbs, but other than that, was a breeze to make. Just like eating at a resturant!

I don't know if I should credit the original recipe, however I found the SAUCE recipe from one of the reviews and it was a great sauce. 1 part peanut butter to 2 parts hoisin sauce, mix over low heat, thin it out with water.

These are beyond amazing... I was SO nervous to try them and have had a really difficult time finding rice paper.  For those of you who are novice kitchenistas like myself, they are not in the refrigerated section! They come in a stack of squares, similar to a stiff paper. My husband and I went to an asian food store to find them and I almost missed them!! The clerk didn't understand what I was looking for, and I was so happy to stumble upon them on my way out! Also, I was lucky enough to meet a seasoned expert at the asian food store and almost bought the wrong fish sauce. According to your taste, some are much more anchovy friendly, and smell substantially worse.  I am SO glad I asked the gal in front of me... she helped me pick a different one, and the sauce did not smell fishy at all (I HATE the smell of fish). "Tiparos" was the fish sauce the nice lady recommended FYI :-)  Also, I was confused on how to wrap the rolls... The rice paper called "Three Ladies Brand" has a diagram on the back on how to do it, and by the fourth roll, they looked just like the rolls I order at my favorite restaurant.  Last, I love peanut sauce, and decided to look for another recipe. Found a really easy and absolutely amazing recipe! Just Hoisin Sauce, Crunchy Peanut Butter... Microwave for 45 seconds, then add water to make it creamy.  I could have licked the bowl!! Enjoy! I will be making them again next week :-)

I never knew mint could be so tasty in a dish!  Excellent rolls accompanied by excellent sauces!  I loved the advice of mixing 1 Tbsp of peanut butter with the 3 Tbsp Hoisin - heat it up and yummy!

I mix the fish sauce combo and hoisin and chopped nuts all together, then add some peanut butter as well. To send to school for lunch I roll them into parchment paper, keeps them from sticking together and maintains moisture level.

TIPS: You don't need warm water in a bowl, make it easy for yourself. Hold the wrapper under the faucet for one second; Lay on a wet towel and assemble (the wrapper will soften up immediately) Be careful to buy the wrappers made of rice, don't buy the wrappers that look like white like flour or are made with flour - these are the wrong ones and are for making fried eggrolls. 99 Ranch Market has them in the Vietnamese section of their stores. You can add whatever ingredients you want, but using basil, mint, or cilantro are key to the unique taste of these rolls. Don't overstuff the roll, these are delicate, and much easier to roll when not over-filled especially if you want to use a dipping sauce. You don't want these looking like burritos! After wrapping, slice them in half on a diagonal slice (much prettier). Dipping sauce: I bought thick teriyaki sauce, added a "little" crunchy peanut butter, and thinly sliced green onions. Rolling the wrappers: Easy to do but takes practice, and you'll be an expert after a few tries. Take these to a party, and everyone will go ga-ga over them and think you're a genius.

This is a light and refreshing meal. I didn't use vermicelli (substituted it with mixed rice), and made mine vegetarian by leaving out the shrimp. I stuffed the spring rolls with thin tomato slices, yellow bell pepper, carrots, mint leaves and lettuce.

The rice wrappers are tricky to work with, but really - just give them a quick dip in borderline hot water and then start adding your ingredients in. The rice wrapper will get softer as you go along. Make sure you have a sharp knife when cutting the spring rolls because otherwise they will fall apart or get squashed. Oh, and one last thing, I mixed 2 parts hoisin sauce to 1 part smooth peanut butter and zapped it in the microwave to heat up instead of on the stove. It's less of a mess this way.

I like this recipe and will make it again. Thanks!

Brilliant. Just like the local here. TIP.....when I make them I get a big deepish plate and boil the kettle and put the rice paper in. Takes only 10 seconds or so to soften. Fish out of hot water and put on to a teatowel and work with that. At the same time Im working with one I put another paper in....and so on until the water is far too cold. Also I use avocardo, beansprouts, julienne carrots, prawns tossed in mayo, mint, corrieander (cilantro) and fine angel hair like noodles....mmmm

I adore Vietnamese Fresh Spring Rolls.  The first time I ever had them was with marinated beef rather than shrimp and served in a make-it-yourself fashion with all of these incredients plus bean spouts so each person could customize it to their liking.  Scrambled egg also makes a nice ingredient and I like to use lettuce that is crispy.

Finally!  I was trying to make these by 'memory' from the ones I have at the Vietnamese restaurants, but they kept falling apart!  Dipping the rice paper one at a time was the trick!  These are so easy and inexpensive to make.  I usually use a satay sauce, though...I make it by mixing peanut butter, hoisin sauce, a dash of soy sauce and a little broth for consistency (or onion and garlic powders and water).

These are sooo good.  There are so many ways to be creative with this recipe - but it's perfect as it is too.  Whatever you do, don't overfill them or you'll have a mess like I did... until I figured out what was doing wrong.

Great recipe! Once I got the hang of it, these rolls came together quickly. If you haven't worked with these delicate wrappers before...make sure to plan that the first four or five won't be very pretty! Instead of lettuce, I used some angel hair shredded cabbage and added shredded carrots for  more color. I used bean sprouts in the filling as well. The dipping sauce was excellent.

this was so very good! I did change mine a little to fit my taste. I added the boiled pork (its a must for us) and I also did shredded carrots and bean sprouts. I left out the mint because we are just not a fan of it. The second time I made these I did much better at wrapping them. My boyfriend is half Vietnamese and he said he would think I was Asian with how good I did the second time, lol! I found that if I put the stuff more to one side, then roll it, it held together better. Also, just run the rice paper under warm water just till it is flexible, then I put a little bowl of water to dip my fingers in to moisten it where needed, when needed. Oh and I also made the sauce with 1 part crunchy peanut butter and 2 parts Hoisin sauce, and it was very yummy! My daughter, who is part Vietnamese just said she loves me the most because I can make them now :), if it was up to her, she would eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Thanks so much for the recipe!! :) I will probably make these for the rest of my life!

I've made these several times and they always get rave reviews.  Last night I took them to an appetizer Cook Off and was thrilled to be announced the Taste winner!! This group is very sophisticated and the other selections were amazing so I was so surprised. I got so many compliments on the Hoisin Peanut sauce and also brought Sweet Chili Thai sauce from this site, using only half the sugar. Both were a big hit! I add carrots like so many here but also take all the herbs and mix them together so it's easier to layer on during assembly. More than one person asked if I bought the rolls- this recipe is that good. Thank you so much - I am always so excited to find something interesting, different and delicious and this is it! Don't get frustrated, at first rolling it can be difficult but gets easier each time.

I always make these without vermicelli, but I add in julienned carrots, spring onions and blanched glass noodles. For the sauce, try frying a small shallot in a little oil until brown, then add in rice wine vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil, and thin out with a tbsp of water. Toasted sesame seeds is also a good idea.

VERY IMPORTANT: there are 2 kinds of spring roll wrappers! DO NOT get the kind made of wheat flour from the freezer section that look like egg roll wrappers! Rice wrappers are thin, clear, and feel just like a dry noodle. In fact, the asian store I went to stocked the wrappers in the noodle aisle.   You just have to moisten the wrapper in hot water. It will feel hard but by the time you layer the ingredients it will have softened.   Great recipe! I thought the herbs were a little strong. I would have preferred more lettuce. I also added shredded carrot and thinly sliced cucumbers. Made a huge difference.

Despite the amount of grumbling and cursing that accompanied my attempts to make pretty rolls, these turned out quite well and tasted a lot like the rolls at my favourite Vietnamese restaurant (note to self, do not use old cheap rice paper wrappers for future efforts.. structural integrity is key for a proper roll!)
I made the rolls pretty much as per the recipe, but had to omit the cilantro as the store was out.  I also added a bit of shredded carrot for extra colour and sweetness, bean sprouts for crunch and tossed the cooked vermicelli with some of the fish sauce/lime juice sauce for added flavour.  
Very tasty, though I must admit not quite worth the amount of effort needed to assemble if it's just a regular dinner, hence the four stars instead of five.  Definitely a keeper if you're looking to impress some guests...  I'll probably make some for my next summer BBQ.

Just like you would order in a Vietnamese restaurant.  The wrapper needs at least 1 minute to soften (I kept a kettle of boiled water nearby to keep the water hot) you can feel by the texture when it's ready.  Once my kids saw what I was doing they took over so these rolls aren't too difficult to make!  We used shrimp, basil, cilantro and slivered cucumber - skipped the lettuce.  Dipped in hoisin sauce mixed with a tbsp of ALMOND butter due daughters peanut allergy. Yummy!

If it was possible to give this recipe six stars I would! It is fabulous AND very, very easy to prepare.  I did not prepare the fish sauce/lime/chili dipping sauce because I cannot stomach the smell of fish sauce.  The hoisin/peanut sauce is good enough to eat with a spoon. Try this recipe... you will not be disappointed.

These were great. I used grilled pork instead of shrimp (b/c its what i had). Also, I tried both dipping sauces and they were excellent! I did add a bit more chili sauce, though, as we found it not spicy enough. Thanks Paula.

These are so good.  And the suggestions from other cooks are excellent.  My idea, to make life easier for the cook, is to have all ingredients available and have each person "roll their own".  This is what we do with tacos and it works with spring rolls too.  That way, they can be individualized and the guests have the fun of making their own spring roll.

This is similar to a recipe I always make but here are the differences.  I do not use Thai Basil, I also add sliced boiled pork (about two slices per roll).  For the Hoisin sauce, this is what I do.  I take about 1 or 2 garlic cloves (chopped) and saute it in a little bit of oil until it is slightly brown.  I then add the hoisin sauce in and saute that very quickly and then add a little bit of water to dilute the consistency a little bit so that it is not too thick and not too runny.  This makes a better dipping sauce then just Hoisin sauce alone which has a pretty thick/strong taste.

Yum! I had no time or energy for shrimp, so I subbed in some rare roast beef from the deli counter, doused in soy sauce. Delicious and way easier.

I have been very fortunate to have lived with a Vietnamese family for a year and then my sister married a Vietnamese gentleman.  Vietnamese food is awesome and Spring Rolls are my favorite!  Every Vietnamese shop has a different take and their own 'secret' ingredient when I visit cities.  This recipe is very authentic, but as every Italian has their own 'perfect' sauce, every Vietnamese mother has her own 'perfect' recipe for Spring Rolls. It's time consuming but worth every minute!

Never Again!  The next time I want to eat these delicious rolls, I will search out a Vietnamese restaurant. It would be easier, take less time and probably cost less in the long run.

This is NOT something you can make at home unless you have training.  First of all, the rice wrappers cannot be found in most grocery stores, and as there are no Asian food stores in my vicinity, I had to make a trip into New York.  I only found one kind of wrapper and while they were rice, they were not 8.5 inches.  Working with them, was like working with spider webs dipped in jello.

As to the vermicelli...."2 oz."???This is a joke.  Rice  vermicelli come in a stiff bundle (package size 8 oz.) that like a bale of hay or raffia, cannot be broken easily.  Once they are cooked (I had to dump the whole thing into hot water to break them up) it required tongs and scissors to break them up, so the idea of "put a few" on the roll is ridiculous.

All in all (not counting time to go into the city to purchase ingrediens) I spent 4 frustrating hours trying to make these.  Like I said, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS AT HOME.  Perhaps a video would be helpful, as well as a more realistic recipe.

These were amazing! I love the homemade sauce. I put much more lime juice in it, and made the garlic chili sauce from scratch, as well as the hoisin sauce, since I will be moving soon and didn't want to buy huge jars of either. I added more mint, basil and cilantro than the recipe called for as well, and it came out wonderful!

Excellent recipe.  I had problems with rolling and ended up using two wrappers for a couple. I am going to try to use a bambo sushi roll mat next time and see if that helps. Do not oversoak the wrapper, only a second in water and that should be enough. It softens as you work with it.

I'll give these three stars for easy and healthy recipe; We were not accustomed to Vietnamese rolls; Ihad a hard time finding the rice wrappers but after three stores I found them; they are not in the refridgerated section since they are sold dry.  The rice wrapper has a sticky/stretchy consistency and texture that wasn't appetizing to me.   I  also thought all three of the fresh herbs were a bit much but since the shrimp is bland I guess it needs it.   I added some shredded carrot and seasoned shrimp with salt and pepper.  I didn't lke the sauces in the recipe and threw them away; we used spicy cocktail sauce instead.

I was a bit underwhelmed by these spring rolls. I thought the herbs were a bit overpowering, because there's otherwise not a lot of flavor in there. I suppose the sauces are supposed to add flavor, but I think spring rolls should be able to stand on their own, and these don't.  Also, unrelated to my rating since it was my mistake, note that these tend not to keep very well even when refrigerated. Only make enough for what you'll eat right then!

My all time fave, you can substitute sliced chicken or thinly sliced pork, or beef, we prefer to cook them on a hot griddle in the middle of the table in a little butter(really enhances the flavor) very quickly.  A little tip is to put the lettuce down FIRST then the noodles, then the meat.  That lets the  freshly cooked meat juices drain into the noodles, and the lettuce keeps the hot juices from melting thru the wrap so it doesnt fall apart.  Also thinly sliced cucumbers make it AMAZING!..

These were a huge hit at a pot-luck I went to.  I cooked the shrimp in some of the hoisin sauce and it tasted great.  Also, I'd recomend to get the round rice wraps instead of the square--they are easier to wrap.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love these rice paper rolls. At my local Vietnamese restaurant they are called "Fun Rolls" because the fresh ingredients, dipping sauce, rice paper and a bowl of hot water are brought out to your table and you wrap them yourself! I prefer them with a lighter dipping sauce made with 1/4 cup of water, 2 tablespoons fish sauce, 1 tablespoon lime juice, 1 tablespoon sugar and a touch of fresh crushed garlic; divine.

These taste EXACTLY like the ones I order from the restaurants. I've made them a couple times a week for the past month... my mom LOVES them! The first time I made them, I found Thai basil at an Asian grocery store but all the times after that, I bought regular basil from any grocery store and it worked just fine. Adding extra cilantro doesn't quite give it the same flavor so for them to taste more authentic, be sure to use regular basil. I also added shredded carrots and julienned cucumber for added color and crunch. One additional hint as to rolling them up: with the lettuce on the far side, fold up the side closest to you over the ingredients, then fold both the uncovered sides towards the center. Lastly, using the lettuce to hold everything steady, continue rolling the spring roll up towards the top of the wrapper and voila... perfectly rolled spring rolls!

For the dipping sauce: 2 parts water, 1 part fishsauce,  1 part peanut butter, 1 part lemon juice, splash of sesame oil, very thinly sliced red peppers, palmsugar or (maple) syrup to taste, handful of chopped coriander. 
For a cheap version: use surimi instead of shrimps.
For a lo-carb version: leave out the noodles and add carrot, bean sprouts, cucumber, bell pepper and  tofu,

very good flavors. I didn't use the vermicelli, and also used some pork instead of shrimp. Easy to follow instructions, and the hot water method for the wrappers definitely works better. i used the dipping sauce from Fresh Spring Rolls with Thai Dipping Sauce.

I don't give many recipes 5 stars, but this is a keeper!  Didn't have mint or Thai basil, put matchstick carrots and cucumbers in, worked out great. The sauce is just like a restaurant we used to eat at.  If you like vietnamese spring rolls, look no further.

Fresh and delicious!
For those that do not like the strong taste of cilantro- you can leave it out altogether or just play around with the amount of mint & basil that you add. I also added avocado, cucumber & matchstick carrots. Also I made a simple dipping sauce with Hoison sauce, water & crunchy peanut butter

balance is crucial, I feel, for this recipe...getting the amount of cilantro and noodles to have the right taste is something I haven't quite figured out yet...

WOW! What an awesome recipe- and very versatile...read some suggestions from other reviewers and added cucumber, also some shredded carrot and radish. Yummy! Thanks for the advice on dipping the rice wrappers until just soft- worked perfectly. Thanks Paula for the great recipe!

I finally got around to making these and can say that they are worth the effort.  I took the advise of another reviewer and copied a local thai restaurant and added a few more fillings. I added cilantro, mint, cucumber, carrot, lettuce, rice noodles, fried tofu, alfalfa sprouts. Delicious.  I did not have much trouble rolling the rice wrappers as I followed others advice and wet them for only a second. They will soften more as time goes by. I served with hoisin/peanut butter sauce, and 2 other dipping sauces from other spring roll recipes I got from this website.   Will make again they do require quite a bit of effort but well worth it. YUMMY!

I've made these a couple of times and they are so good, just like the Vietnamese restaurant we used to go to in St. Paul (Hoa Bien).  A few changes I make include omitting the mint, using regular basil from my garden, adding shredded carrot, and increasing the amount of shrimp.  While I love the spring rolls, none of us cared for the sauces.  I have to keep looking for the perfect peanut sauce.

This is an excellent, fresh recipe. I've been a fan of Vietnamese spring rolls for more then 10 years, and have looked everywhere for tasty, light rolls. These actually surpass some of the restaurants I've eaten at. I made the recipe exactly as written. I did not make the Hoisin and Peanut Sauce, but that fish sauce is absolutely incredible. It does need some type of thickener though to really stick to the rolls. These took some practice getting the rolling right without actually destroying the rice paper. I recommend that people buy a few extra rice papers since you're guaranteed to rip at least a couple trying to roll them up.

These were terrific.  I added finely sliced cucumbers (julienned) for extra freshness and crunch, yum!  I did not chop the herbs but layed them flat on the wrapper so when the spring roll is done, the leaves show thourgh the rice wrapper.  It looks great.  I need a bit of practice to roll them up so they stay nice and tight, but the taste was wonderfull.  I used my own recipe for a dipping sauce (on this site: "The best thai peanut sauce".)  I added more coconut milk and some water to the dipping sauce to make it thinner in order to dip.
Thanks for this recipe

This recipe is the greatest!!!  I have always wanted to make these every since I had them at a resturant called Chop Sticks here in Richmond, VA.  They are so light and refreshing.  They are also easy to make.  The flavors meld together so nicely.  I add a little Oyster Sauce for added flavor and I use the small Salad Shrimp.  I will be making these every week.

As a family we all got into "race" of who could roll the best, which made the rolling everyones job instead of just mine, and it worked out GREAT! The sauces were EXACT!! If you like more of the Thai sauce, add a rounded tablespoon of peanut butter to the hoisin sauce. We made all three.

These were a big hit at a neighborhood party. Very fresh & everyone favorably commented they weren't deep-fried. Suggest making sure all ingredients are dry; too much water (noodles) can leave rolls soggy. Suggest 30 min refrigeration. LOVED the 1st sauce!

I have made this recipe a few times now and it is superb! Be sure not to overcook the vermicelli. If very thin my mother taught me to drop in boiling water, immediately after 2-3 minutes (extra minute if thicker) quickly drain and rinse in cold water. This will yield vermicelli that will not be sticky and a little bite. I made one other substitution which is to use Red leaf lettuce. I clean it and remove the ribs from the lettuce. I get rave reviews each time I make these, people asking for my version of the recipe. The fish sauce recipe provided is really good and authentic. You can halve it though, I feel I have a lot left over for a recipe this size. I made these recently for a friend who couldn't have gluten, and used the San-J Thai peanut sauce for dipping instead of hoisin sauce, and it was a very good substitute to make this recipe completely gluten free.

Two meat variations: I've made this recipe pan frying chicken breast strips marinated with San-J Asian BBQ sauce (gluten free), and another time with pork strips marinated/sprinkled with Chinese Five Spice powder then pan-fry. These pair well with the fish sauce dipping sauce.

My mom and I always go to a local, family owned Vietnamese resturant and get spring rolls and have always talked about thrying to make them and with this recipes help, we were able to!

I made these spring rolls exactly as directed, but made my own peanut sauce for dipping from the Indonesian Satay recipe from this site. These taste just like the ones I get at a local Thai house and are so easy to make!

The garlic chile sauce is the best. I make the recipe on bean sprouts in a bowl (skip the the rice wrappers) with all the fixings and it's exceptional.

This was a nice change from the norm and I love how the flavors compliment each other. Two small tweaks: I used 3 tsp fish sauce instead of 4 tsp and used 3:1 ratio of hoisin and peanut butter. I also added sprouts, cucumber sticks, shredded carrot and pork as suggested. I spread the hoisin sauce in the roll and dipped in the the other sauce.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was easier than I thought, and it came out great! As some have pointed out, definitely do not leave the rice paper in the water too long! It softens more as you work with it. Also, I used bacon instead of shrimp and that was delicious! I had some leftover and the next day, the wrappers were very hard. I just took the contents out and re-wrapped them in new wrappers and they were as good as fresh! Yum!

I've been wanting to make these for a while now.  This recipe came out very well and seems to be pretty close to what I've had in Vietnamese restaurants!  Healthy, tasty and not too hard to make.  Plus kids love the rice wrappers which start out sort of like clear plastic discs and turn floppy and elasticy when you dip them in hot water!  (bonus - they are only 2 points each on WW)  You can use other meat - I used chicken since my husband doesn't eat shrimp.  Also cucumber slivers and carrot shreds are sometimes used.

I made these for a family get together this week and wow, were they a hit!  Delightfully fresh tasting and after a short learning curve with the wrappers ( They worked best when I just dipped them quickly in water and wrapped very quickly too), very easy to make. It is very imporant to have all your fillers ready before you wrap. (I used shrimp, noodles, cucumber, spicy bean sprouts, mint and cilantro)  My only problem was that the finished wraps were slighty sticky so I served them on a large platter on a bed of lettuce leaves so they wouldn't stick together and my guests could pick up a lettuce leaf with the wrap if they didn't like the tactile stickiness. I used a ginger teriaki dipping sauce. The presentation was beautiful with the pink shrimp and the bright green mint leaves glowing through the translucent wrappers. Thanks Paula!

I found it helpful to soak the mint if you are not picking it off your own plants.  Fresh mint from the store is a little dry.  I also threw in about a 1/2 tsp of rice wine vinegar into the rice it gives it a more authentic taste.  These were fantastic, for me anyways.

These were fantastic! I bought 1lb of the 40-50 count cooked shrimp(on sale) and just put 2 or 3 in each roll instead of cutting up. I also added thin, stick-sliced cucumbers and shredded carrots. I used fresh basil and cilantro from my garden and no mint. Served them with the garlic fish sauce recipe and also the hoison/peanut butter sauce listed in one of the reviews. My pool party guests raved about them. They are a tasty light and healthy appetizer. They do take a little time to make but well worth the effort. I made mine the morning of the party and covered them with wax paper  in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

The fish sauce dipping sauce is exactly what I was looking for.  Tastes just like Vietnamese restaurants.  I have read that the brand of fish sauce used will make a big difference.  Some of the very inexpensive ones are too -- well -- fishy. 
Thanks so much for the sauce recipe.  Can't wait to actually make the spring rolls.  I bought a gallon container plant of Thai Basil today at Whole Foods.
Day Two -Made the spring rolls for dinner.  
Very good.  Served with the sauce made with fish sauce and also The Best Thai Peanut Sauce from this site. The best tip I read on wrapping these is to roll them tightly and if one gets a hole to just roll a second wrapper around the spring roll.  I think the herbs are great.  I also added shredded carrot, a litle green onion, cumcumber, and a few drops of fish sauce to each roll. I forgot the lettuce.  oh, well -- they were still great. :)

I've always loved fresh spring rolls but never got around to making them myself.  We were attending a party, and since I happened to have the necessary ingredients, I thought I'd quickly "throw" them together.  Turns out the wrappers were a lot trickier than I imagined, so the end result was an authentic tasting, but not authentic looking roll.  I'll be making these again.  With practice, I'm sure I'll get the rolls a lot tighter. Thanks Paula, for a great recipe!

I'm Vietnamese so I eat these all the time.  I'm vegetarian so my mother makes a different variety.  It has vegetarian ham, clear vermicelli noodles, tofu, and roast rice powder tossed together.  Then that mixture is rolled with the other ingredients instead of shrimp.

These are fantastic! Fresh and light. It took a couple tries to get the rolling down. They were as good, maybe better, than my favorite restraunt's rolls. I added bean sprouts for some extra crunch but followed every thing else exactly. Will definitely make again and again.

Tasty! A word about fish sauce, though: there are two kinds of Vietnamese fish sauce. One has a thick, pinkish-beige sediment in it and one is brown and clear. Get the clear brown one! Also, some of the mint leaves I used were a little tough. Next time I'll just use little young ones.

Sooo good! There's something about the combination of fresh herbs with the noodles and shrimp that made this divine. This tastes just like the spring rolls I order at my favourite Vietnamese restaurant (maybe even a little better!). It's so refreshing and the perfect accompaniment to a summer meal. Thanks!

I used egg rolls and fried them instead of spring rolls because I could not find them in the grocery store.

The fresh herbs were wonderful in the roll, and the recipie for the fish sauce dipping sauce was incredible.  Highly recomment the sauce!

Been making this recipe for years.  I leave out the basil and add more cilantro (love cilantro) and have always used napa cabbage instead of lettuce.   I  mix the napa cabbage with the mint and cilantro before layering.  The napa just seems to give them more crunch.  They are great appetizers with a Chinese dish and very light and refreshing!

The recipe was a great! I couldn't find the thai basil and DID NOT include the mint.  I made it with the mint/cilantro and the mint was overpowering.  I made the remaining wraps with the only cilantro.  I used other reviews and excluded the lettuce.  Instead I used carrots, beansprouts, cucumber, and celery.  I made my sauce with 1/4 cup of soy sauce, honey, and rice wine vinegar.  I made a few the day before but I wasn't able to use them because the outside dried out.  Best if made the same day. The next time I make them, I will probably cook the rice vermicelli in a vegetable or chicken broth to add an additional layer of flavor. My guests loved them!

This was great! I'm so excited to know how to make these myself! I did add cucumber strips, shredded carrots, and bean sprouts. I didn't have basil or lettuce handy, but these made a decent small meal for my husband and me. Will probably taste even better with the Thai basil next time.

I live in Hawaii and have eaten these from several different places, so I know what I like and what it should taste like.  This was good, I omitted the fish sauce, (too salty), the ingredients, which included, the noodles, lettuce, julienned carrots and japanese cucumbers, a dash of hoisin sauce (or sauce of your liking), topped with a little more noodles. Just remember to put your shrimp, then your mint leaves on top of shrimp first so they look beautiful after you've wrapped them.  I made the peanut sauce I got from the food network site. (Peanut dipping sauce needs to be experimented with). Many of the friends that ate it liked it without sauce. Yay!! I did it! Thanks for your recipe, I wasn't sure of the type of wrapper (the name) or the type of rice noodles to use and you took the guesswork out of it. I feel like an expert now. :)

Tastes like what you get at restaurants!  Forgot the lettuce and added shredded carrots.  Only made hoisin dipping sauce.  Took a little practice to assemble but fairly easy once you get the hang of it .  FYI rice vermicelli was called cellophane noodles at my grocery store. Thanks for sharing!!

Fabulous recipe (more of a method then a recipe). I didn't follow the directions for vermicelli preparation, rather I let them soak in boiled water for about 10 minutes and they came out nicely. Added cucumber & carrots to the roll and I highly recommend everyone does that too. The fish sauce was terrific, for hoisin sauce, I used Kats11 recipe of PB & hoisin, thinned out with water. I put the soaked wrapper on wet paper towel so it didn't stick to anything. The first roll didn't come out good but once I got the hang of quick rolling - it was a snap. Will make again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I used cellophane (mung bean) noodles rather than rice noodles.  Substituted julienned sticks of imitation crab for shrimp.  Next time I would probably either cut back on the mint or substitute another herb.  Added julienned carrot and cucumber.  Served with a spicy peanut sauce for dipping.  Will definitely make again!

Frickin' AMAZING!!  And so much fun for the family to make the way each person wanted!  We often order these from our local Vietnamese restaurants, and they have always looked rather complicated.  Even after reading this recipe, I was skeptical about my ability to make them, but they turned out great!  Water for rice paper didn't even need to be warm, but as others cautioned...they just need a dip, not a long soak.  We made them with the basic items from the recipe (except the basil because we didn't have it and the lettuce because we had enough other ingredients), but we also mixed and matched some additional ingredients for fun/variety.  We used leftover ground turkey (from the Asian Lettuce Wraps recipe on this site), jalepenos, bean sprouts, julienned carrots and cucumber slices.  For the dip, we only used a hoisin/peanut butter/chopped cashew mix.  Can't wait to make them for my next party!!

These were great! We used to go to a little Vietnamese place and always ordered these.  When we moved I was convinced I had to try to make these at home.  I could not find Thai basil so I had to leave that out.  These were still really good, so if you can't find Thai basil, don't worry! The sauces were spot on! My husband loves the fish sauce and I love the peanut sauce, so this was perfect.  Thank you so much for a fantastic recipe, I will be making these again and again!

The sauces are fabulous. I made these with saifun mung bean threads, cucumber, cilantro, green onions (white part chopped and greens laid lengthwise), and broccoli slaw from a bag! Couldn't have been easier and I am a very basic cook! Everything was available in my local supermarket.....so delicious, healthy, and no cooking! even the bean threads just required soaking for a minute in boiled water.

It might not be fair to rate this given that I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but the end result was great.  I used a store-bought thai peanut sauce for convenience, and added to the inside of the roll so these would be easy to take to lunch. I used half a pound of shrimp, split lengthwise and layered across the wrapper.  I stored them in a plastic container with a barely damp paper towel on the bottom.  Thanks for sharing.

I didn’t use the fish sauce and I made my own dipping sauce.  Great recipe. Not difficult.  It takes a little practice to get the rolling down.  The great thing about this is that you can add any of your favorite items to the spring roll.  We love to use our Thai basil from our garden and load up the roll with that, fresh mint, a bit of spring salad mix, some matchstick carrots and thinly sliced red pepper.   As you eat it, you feel like you are eating something good for you.  I made extra so we can have it on hand as a quick and healthy snack.

Love, love, love! I've been paying $4 for 2 little spring rolls at my favorite Vietnamese restaurant, now I can make them myself for a fraction of the cost and they are DELICIOUS! Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe...now if I can just learn to wrap my rolls a bit more tightly!  :c)

OMG - these are called Nime Chow at all the Asian restaurants here in RI and they're one of my absolute favorites!  Perfect for a hot summer night.  This is a delicious recipe and it's pretty darned close to the recipe from my favorite Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese place...YUM!

These were very good.  The only change I made was leaving the mint out and left the shrimp whole.  They need to be eaten the day you make them.  The ones I had left over did not save well. Both sauces were very good also.

I didn't have any peanuts, so I used chunky peanut butter on the lettuce pieces I wrapped inside the roll.  These were excellent.  They are even better than some I've had in Vietnamese restaurants.

Great recipe, very simple to make and very fresh tasting.  To even make it simpler you can skip the sauce use your own choice for variety.

This was so good!  I made it vegetarian and it was a hit with the kids and husband.  I did like the version of using chunky peanut butter instead of the chopped peanuts.

This was absolutely amazing! I cannot believe I made this. This is one of my favorite foods. These were just like a good Thai restaurant's. And the homemade sauce was GREAT. Here's my tip: Put LOTS of fresh herbs into the spring rolls, that's what gives them the trademark flavor. I will absolutely make this for any party I throw!

Ive made this recipe a couple times and just feel like it needs some tweaking with the shrimp. I feel like there is some flavor missing with the shrimp. Ive tried using siracha and/or rice vinegar. Any suggestions?

Made these twice now.  First time I used pork and subbed rice for the noodles, good!  I did shrimp this time and the noodles, still good!  I used regular basil, added sprouts & cucumber.  I used the hot water from the noodles to soften the wrapper.  I wrapped much better this time than the first... Oh, and I also found fish sauce and do a few splashes of that before rolling up.  I would like a much tighter roll, so I will practice that for next time.  Thanks!

These are excellent! I add thinly sliced cucumber and shredded carrot to this. The fresh basil and cilantro really add so much flavor. I find that 2 medium sized shrimp work perfect for these. I serve them as a salad sometimes and we love them dipped in a Thai Peanut Sauce. Yum!

Awesome!!! I simplified this by just using vermicelli, cooked chicken cut into strips, cilantro and bean sprouts wrapped in rice paper.  I also used the sauce suggested by another reviewer of 2 parts Hoisan sauce to one part peanut butter.  Tons of compliments on this one.

I make this again and again.  I find it a bit strong with the mint and basil.  If I use basil I use a small amount and I slice it thin.     I marinade the shrimp in garlic, a drop of sesame oil and lemon juice before I cook them.  When I cook the shrimp I steam it in a steamer.  This is always a hit at every party.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I loved these spring rolls...they tasted just like the one's at our favorite Vietnamese restaurant! Unfortunately I didn't have mint or Thai basil. And instead of the sauce I put together a peanut sauce/Siracha mix which was excellent! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent rolls! I added chives and also used some avocado slices. When wetting the rice paper, I'd suggest getting it to *just* al dente THEN taking it out to roll - keeps it's shape better and it will soften up more while you are rolling with it.

I made these last summer and have started again this year.  You taste unique flavors with each bite.  Nice and light for snacks or entertaining. The peanut sauce is the final touch of flavor that makes you want one more for the road.

I used home grown mint in the recipe and did not like the rolls much. So then I left out the mint in remaining rolls and for me, the rolls were so much better.  I love basil and cilantro and added lots of both.  The first dipping sauce tasted great but I also thought the rolls were much better with a peanut/satay sauce. 5 stars plus without mint and the addition of peanut sauce.

Didn't really care for this, for all the effort of prep and finding the ingredients, the final product wasn't all that fantastic taste wise. I liked the texture and aroma of the herbs, but was really lacking in flavor.
I made the shrimp ones with the addition of crisp blanched asparagus, shredded carrots and sprouts.
And I made another lot with marinated thin pork slices which helped with the flavor aspect.
My favorite part was the 1st sauce, without the sauce the rolls would have been barely edible. The final product did look really cool though, I wouldn't make this again unless it was for a fancy party or something. 
It was a good light meal, very fitting for a hot afternoon.

Great recipe to build from.  I usually make long, thin egg rolls and put them in with the other ingredients.  The egg roll adds a crunchy texture that puts it over the top.  Another dipping sauce that I use is chili with fish sauce.  With a mortar and pestal, crush 2-3 cloves of garlic with a tablespoon of sugar and a tablespoon of chopped cilantro.  Once combined in a paste like consistency, add 2-3 tablespoons of fish sauce (good kind).  Add juice of 2 limes and 1/2 teaspoon of chili paste.  You can play around with the amounts of each ingredient to your liking.  I use green lettuce or red lettuce.  No need to chop the herbs, just remove the leaf from the stem.  Also for that added flavor, add thinly sliced banana blossoms in the spring roll.  Yum!!  Thanks for the post.

These are great. I added shredded carrots and cucumber matchsticks, and omitted the mint. Love the fish sauce. The hoisin is too thick and sweet for my taste.

I've been making these for years and love them.  Some tips I've learned: not all rice paper wraps are created equal, try different brands; shrimp can be cut/split down the center to make go further; mint is so delicious, I use whole leaves; dry ingredients inside help make the rolling easier; must dip them in something (all sauces mentioned here sound great!) otherwise they taste bland; can't beat how healthy they are!!  YUM!

AMAZING!  Just dip the rice papers in the hot water for a second--they will soften by the time you need to wrap them. I made these for a party and they were inhaled...a keeper.

I obviously bought the wrong wrappers.  Made from wheat, not rice.  Therefore, they were dough-y after I wrapped them.  So I brushed with olive oil and baked them.  They still turned out really good.  However, the fish sauce is fabulous!  I now know my favorite viet restaraunt's secret sauce!  Don't let the fish sauce scare you; in this mixture it's not fishy at all.  And the spicy chili paste isn't hot at all, just flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll be trying this again when I can find rice wrappers!

Very good!  I recomend going easy on the herbs, they are a little over powering.  You have to make sure they are very dry and let them dry a bit more so you can spread them easily in the roll.  When dipping the rice paper, just run it through the bowl of water, do not let it sit or else the texture will be lost.  Even if it feels a bit firm, it will soften once it sits a minute.

Tasty. But the basil/mint/cilantro mixture was kinda nasty and unnecessary. Shred some carrots and toss them in there. Its better that way.

I added ingredients like some of the others.  I used bean sprouts, chopped green onion, grated carrot and left out the mint. I love mint, but didn't have any. The prep took a little longer than anticipated, so my husband and I stood in the kitchen and ate them up as was I wrapping them. On a hot day, when it is over 100 degrees, these are a delight!  Totally worth all the prep time.  I used cooked seasoned chicken instead of shrimp the last time I made these.  We dipped them in Tai peanut dessing with soy sauce, rice wine, and a little sesame oil.

The freshness of these spring rolls is outstanding,  alot of different textures going on here, served with a little pickled ginger on the side is a nice palate cleaner.

I think next time I will add chopped peanut to the rolls. I wasn't super impressed with either of the sauces. Also, I added shredded carrot and sliced scallions. A pretty good recipe, Thanks!

Just made this for my sister's wedding reception on July 3.   They were amazing.   I modified the recipe to make a vegetarian version.  Left out the cilantro as I'm not a big fan.   I cut some english cucumber into julienne strips and grated some carrot.  Also added some avocado to some of them.  Sprinkled the veggies with some lime juice.  I tried the hoisin-peanut sauce that someone else had recommended.  It was a bit bland so I spiced it up with some garlic, lots of tabasco sauce, lime juice and a few drops of sesame oil.  Also used a thai chili dipping sauce.  Not big on the fish sauce idea!  All in all the recipe was great, everyone loved them.  I did find that the wrappers were too delicate, I had to double them as they kept tearing.  The veggies were poking holes in them. Next time I will chop them smaller.  I just wish I had noticed the serving conversion option, as I had to make a lot of them so just guessed when making 6 batches.  I ended up with a lot of leftover veggies and noodles.  Will definitely make these again!

I didn't like this at all.  Maybe I added too many herbs.  The mint was just too strong for my taste.

I was intimidated to make these, but tried, and was impressed with how easy they 
really are. I added seedless matchstick sliced cucumber, more shrimp, and reg. basil.
Great, but something was missing.....not quite like the restaurant quality i hoped for. 
Any suggestions??

I've had a vietnamese dish named buns (boons). Anyway, since then I've remembered the ingredients but didn't know how to make the fish sauce (named nuoc mam). I found a recipe but when I made it, it didn't taste anything like the restaurant. So, I decided that was the best I could do, then decided to see if I could do spring rolls. I got your recipe and saw the fish sauce and couldn't believe it. I've looked all over this web site for it. Anyway, I made it and it was just like the one I'd eaten before. I poured the other out. I didn't have all the ingredients for the spring rolls, although I will soon. I'm just glad I looked for them. Thanks

this was awesome! I used pulled pork seasoned with Asian spices bc of my seafood allergy. my family went bananas. the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was bc no one told me how hard wrapping was going to be... but I made it through. will try with other ingredients!!

I enjoyed this, and my diet club guests did too. A refreshing treat and a reminder that food that's low in calories can be exciting (Unless you're a strict meat and potatoes person. In that case you probably want to steer away from this.). No reason to not give it 5 stars. Plus, it's a dish that showcases herbs in my garden that can take work but 
sometimes go ignored.

This was a hit and I've made it twice.  Takes a while to assemble, a little labor intensive.  I used the 2 parts hoisin sauce, 1 part peanut butter sauce as one reviewer suggested and it was delicious-I wasn't about to spend the time it takes making the sauce from the recipe but I'm sure they were good as well.

These taste fabulous. Your family will be hooked on them. I used to buy these when I lived up north and my whole family loved them. I am now in an area where there is not much Asian food around to purchase, and I missed being able to buy these. Now I can make them!

I make these often, sometimes I add baked tofu or veggie meats so we can make a meal out of them. I like to juliene my vegetables and jicama. You can put just about anything in the wraps

These are awesome! I used chicken breast cut into long strips. The added cucumber and carrots make it really yummy. I like them short, fat and tight. The fatter it is and shorter it is, I have found that it is easy to keep it really tight as you roll them. I don't like a long, floppy & loose roll! 

One tip for the wrappers: add hot water to a pie pan and then dip each individual wrapper in the water for a few seconds. It's a good way to get it wet but not too wet.

I can't wait to make these again! I see lots of potential to try new combos!

These were so good!  I've always loved them in resturaunts, but assumed they were difficult to make.  Now I know they aren't!  I did use pre-cooked shrimp and dipping sauce from a jar, but used the best quality that I could find.  This made it a quick and easy, fresh treat.  My husband didn't like the mint, but they'd still be great without it.

Still having trouble getting the fold down, but, other than that, these are very easy. I would like to add pork next time.  The chili fish sauce is delicious.

The recipe for the dipping sauce is the best!  It tastes just like the sauce I used to get with spring rolls at a Vietnamese restaurant that I used to go to years ago!

I love these! I only use the veggies though because I don't like shrimp. I like the hoisin sauce for dipping best. The tricky part is learning how to roll it all up in the rice wrapper. I'm still getting the hang of it, but the tighter you can wrap the better they will be, and make sure you don't put the filling to close to the edge because it'll make your life difficult.

My hubby made these tonight and they were delicious.  It would have been nice to have more specific instructions about how much of each herb to use.  He made a couple changes...we didn't have vermicelli so used soba noodles instead.  Also, he added thin slices of oriental fish cakes to each roll to complement the shrimp.  A great light meal!

I didn't think it would be this easy to replicate spring rolls. Delicious! I left out the shrimp and basil and added cucumbers; I used buckwheat vermicelli in place of the rice vermicelli. I didn't have chili sauce so I substituted white vinegar (not as much of a stretch as you might think - chili sauce is basically tomato sauce, vinegar, sugar and spices.) The sauce came out really thin so in the future I think I will mix some corn starch into the water before mixing with the rest of the ingredients. I made a double batch of the sauce and I'm glad I did. My wife said I should make them again. She's been saying that a lot recently, thanks allrecipes :P

Excellent.  I added julienne carrots, and did one reviewer's 2 parts hoisin/1 part peanut butter (with h20 to thin) sauce instead, but followed everything else.  Delicious.  Only thing I'd like in the future is cucumber and tofu.  I smiled the whole time I ate it!

This recipe is okay. basically followed it except that for lettuce I used Butter lettuce. Also, besdies the lettuce I mixed the fillings into a bowl and added a spicy mayo sauce (1/2 cup mayo, 1/4 cup chili garlic sauce and 1/4 cup brown sugar). My friends all rave about this and request it for every gathering!!! Also, you can add up to a 1/2 chili sauce if you like things REALLY spicy...

Excellent sauce!  I will sometimes substitute chicken for the shrimp and I also like to use fresh carrots, bean sprouts, and scallions. It's always a crowd pleaser, a great summer dish.

These were just meh... Nothing really exceptional about them and my boyfriend thought the mint was a little strange in there. (Tho I didn't mind it too much.) These were pretty bland and felt like they were truly missing something. Tho they weren't *bad* I doubt I will use this recipe again if I make these.

I like the versatility of this recipe. I have used all manner of meats and veggies. Today, I made them with leftover pork tenderloin, sliced thin, with cooked asparagus, grated carrots, cilantro and mango. Dipped in hoison sauce/peanut butter sauce. Sooooo good!

These are AWESOME!  Following others' suggestions, I held the dry spring roll wrapper under the tap for a second each side and worked on a wet dish cloth to assemble.  You can use practically any salad-type filling for these.  In fact, I think we will use salad dressing for our dipping sauces next time.  Did not care for the fish sauce.  The hoisin was good.  I also used Trader Joe's Sweet Chili Sauce which was very good on these.  I am going to make these fresh on some mornings to put in my pre-schooler's lunch box.  She loved them!

Really delicious. I doubled the salad ingredients (mint, basil, cilantro) and really piled it on. I'd also recommend making more of the sauces.  I tripled the recipes so I'd have enough to put each person's serving in an individual ramekin so they could 'double dip'...because they are so good!

Fantastic recipe~
A few suggestions-
1) Thai Basil isn't necessary. Any basil will do
2) while the dipping sauce is very good, and easier version is simply hoisin sauce, siracha, and a tad bit of peanut butter (crunchy is best)
3) make sure you have a few extra rice paper wrappers around. It will take a few tries to get used to the wrapping
4) Double up on the shrimp (why not?! That's why you make it at home!)

Really good, just like the thai restaurants.  We bought peanut sauce in a jar, but the fish sauce recipe was light and flavorful.  Would be a great party food.

Make this recipe vegetarian by using boiled eggs cut into quarters lengthwise instead of shrimp.  I buy pre-made sauce that doesn't contain fish.

Loved it! I like to use rotisserie chicken shreds in place of the shrimp sometimes and it's delicious. I like both dips but I like the fish sauce/lime dip a bit more than the peanut/hoisin dip. So full of flavor!

This would have been much better had I cut out at least half of the cilantro, if not all.  The cilantro was too overpowering in this dish.  I found a satay peanut sauce recipe that was excellent with these.  I would make again, minus the cilantro.

I loved these spring rolls. They were so fresh and flavorful! The only reason they didnt get the 5 stars was because they were time consuming. It was my first attempt to work with some of the ingredients so that might have slowed me down. I will certainly try this recipe again.

These were really good. I used shredded carrots as well, and substituted a poached, boneless/skinless  chicken breast, sliced and tossed with a little fish sauce.

Everyone's favorite at the office pot luck.  I did add grated carrot, omitted the basil (couldn't find it) and put two full shrimp in each roll.  I also followed another reviewers' advice and made the peanut sauce out of 1 part crunchy peanut butter to 2 parts hoisin sauce - it totally makes the dish. Next time I won't bother with the other sauce.

I thought these were great.  I used raw tofu instead of shrimp and instead of the sauce recipe given, I made a peanut sauce by mixing some peanut butter and soy sauce together.  Fantastic!

Great basic recipe. When I make these I lay the sofitened wrappers on a damp tea towel. This makes it MUCH easier to roll them up real tight. Also can use rice noodles from Asian section of grocery. Love this dish!

These tasted fantastic. As per other reviews and personal taste did not use the mint or the cilantro. I added bean sprouts, other than that followed exactly. I also used the sauces, must haves :) I find that boiling the noodles makes them soggy, so I soak the noodles in very warm water for 10 minutes and they always come out perfect. I do this with all rice noodles. Excellent recipe, thank you

I tried this recipe and it didn't work so well.  After I rolled them and they sat for a few minutes, they stuck to the plate and fell apart when I tried to eat them.  The mint was also very overpowering.

I made these for a picnic.  It was my first time working with rice paper and it was suprisingly easy!  These were devoured and I had great compliments from everyone.  I did leave out the peanuts from the hoisen sauce due to allergies.  Also, next time I would reduce the mint as I found it a bit overpowering.

This is an excellent recipe. I served it at a ladies cocktail party and it was a huge hit. I didn't care for the two sauces alone.  I found that by mixing two parts of the hoisen/peanut sauce to approximately 1 part of the fish/lime sauce I got a dipping sauce that I preferred.

This was fun to make and tasted great!  Next time I will omit the rice vermicelli.  Changes :  I included shredded carrots, increased the amount of shrimp, decreased the amount of cilantro, and I used the peanut butter/hoisin sauce recommended by the #1 positive reviewer...easy to do and was a hit!

This was excellent and the notes from the other ratings helped me a lot with putting it all together.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding diced cucumber and diced avocado.  I couldn’t find the basil required so I just omitted it.  It was delicious but the sauces (or similar sauces) are a must, or it is bland.  It is best served the same day, as I had some left over and the side with more layers got a little chewy as leftovers but that didn’t stop us from devouring them.  I will make this again.

My guests and I really enjoyed this recipe. I modified it by changing the vermicelli to cucumber to accommodate the needs of a diabetic and a guest on the Keto diet.

I will definitely make it again and would love recipes for oriental sauces that are sugar free.

Vietnamese summer rolls are the epitomy of simple and delicious.   I've been making them for quite a while and am always interested in adding new ingredients.   I did revert back to an old favorite dipping sauce recipe, basically peanut butter, hoisin sauce, rice wine vinegar and some crushed peanuts.

Make these atleast once a week, they are really tasty and pretty easy once you've done em a few times. I like to make mine a little different though, don't use noodles ( don't like em), and use more veggies; carrots, cucumber, bean sprouts and radishes are my fav. Serve with a healthier spicy peanut dipping sauce for an easy delicious and healthy lunch or light dinner

These spring rolls are just like the ones I get at a local restaurant.  I did add some shredded carrot, as suggested by other reviewers.  Despite watching a You Tube video or two about how to roll these, I struggled a bit with rolling them. Mine looked a bit lopsided and loose but that's the not fault of the recipe!  I'm sure that a tightly rolled and uniform looking spring roll takes practice. Great recipe! Thanks!

I have been looking for a recipe like this and I can't wait to try it! Paula, I appreciate that you put 2 dipping sauces with the recipe. The hubs is severely allergic to peanuts so the other sauce can be used for him. I do have a question. Is there any other nut you could mix with the hosin sauce that would taste good?

Easy to make once you get the hang of working with the wraps. They soften up pretty quickly. Also, these don't keep that well (roll wrap gets hard). So either eat them all right away. Or wrap them in the fridge in a damp paper towel and saran wrap.

These are really good except they needed an additional added crunch, so I addd shredded carrots and julienned sliced cucumber (without seeds). Thai basil is very difficult to find unless you are fortunate enough to live near an Asian market that carries fresh herbs. So I added 1/2 again as much cilantro and touch ore mint. The peanut sauce has much more flavor if you combine and warm together s1 part crunchy peanut butter to 2 part hoisen sauce. These can be made vegetarian as is, or you can add cooked shrimp for a wonderful variation.

I added some shredded carrot but otherwise kept the rolls the same. I used chunky peanut butter in place of the peanuts in the sauce (as others have mentioned) And I liked the fish sauce dip as well!

I made this recipe for a large party and it was a hit.  I did make adjustments though, I left out the mint and had no basil so it was just cilantro for herbs.  I also added carrots and cucumber.  I made the fish sauce and thought it was great (I haven't had these before so I don't know whats "right".  I liked the fish sauce with the rolls.  I also followed the other peanut sauce...2 parts hoisin to 1 part PB and I added some lime juice and garlic chili sauce to it.  Will definitely make these again

Warning: Don't put these on a paper plate! I learned the hard way that the wrapper sticks to it and they rip open when you pick them to eat! Don't let the wet wrappers touch each either! 
I made this today and it was good, but bland. While it was easy to make, it was time consuming to put it together. I added cucumbers and carrots. I used regular basil since I couldn't find the Thai variety. It was really good looking, but my only qualm is that it needs more flavor in the noodles.
The sauces were good too.

This tasted just like our favorite Vietnamese resteraunt. I also added carrots and cucumber for crunch. I used regular basil but think the thai basil has a much better flavorWe had a few issues with the rice paper wrapper but figured it out. It was a fun family dinner. The sauce with crunchy peanut butter and hoisin sauce was great!

I absolutely love this recipe, I added Alvarado in mine and did not use cilantro. Everyone loved them and they were gone in minutes with request to make more. These will definitely make an appearance to the weekly dinner menu. For the dips, I also served a sweet Thai chili sauce for options. Simple, fresh and so amazing.

This was so simple my five year old was able to assemble the rolls with just a little guidance! It was healthful and yummy with a few additions. I followed the advice of reviewer Kats11 and made a sauce of 1 part peanut butter to two parts Hoisin. I ended up sprinkling a tiny bit of Stevia in it to be sure my kids would eat it. Turned out they liked the rolls without a dipping sauce, but my husband and I loved them with. My husband insists the addition of Siracha makes everything better! Added julienne carrots too. Yum!

Just like the restaurant, except I need to work on rolling! I made the sauce differently as others recommended - 1/3 cup crunchy peanut butter, 2/3 cup hoisin sauce, 2 cloves garlic, juice of 1 lime and prob. about 1/2 cup of water to thin out. I also added julienne carrot and cucumber as suggested, and didn't use Thai basil, as I didn't want to bother looking for it. I doubled the recipe and the fam gobbled them down. Another great dinner for hot days!

I love Vietnamese rolls!  I usually use cucumbers as my base instead of vermicelli and have never used basil, but this is delicious.  Good sauces too--a  nice change from the sweet chili sauce I usually use.

Great spring roll. Its very fresh, super healthy and 2-3 of these could be a full entree. Great option for the health conscious! Even though it has vermicelli, its such a small amount in each roll that its still low carb. I used bib lettuce and also added shredded carrots and diced jalapenos. I also omitted the mint.

Love theses and love the versitility of what you can put in them...when I want something really tasteful but without a ton of meat, I eat these veggie style.  They are still wonderful - esp. with the fish sauce for dipping.  You cannot beat mint, basil, and cilantro.  I also usually squeeze a lemon wedge onto the filling before closing it - so yummy!

I have made this several times, didn't change a thing & they are fantastic! I grew up in the city where all types of food were plentiful, I now live in a rural area & had to figure out how to make a lot of things for myself! These are definitely winners!

Fabulous! I hosted a dinner party where we assembled these together as an ice breaker activity. I prepped all the vegetables (including shredded carrots and julienned cucumber) and fillings ahead of time, and everyone rolled their own rolls, choosing whatever they wanted. I made the sauce from the recipe (yum!), as well as the 2 parts hoisin, 1 part peanut butter sauce recommended by another reviewer. It was a hit! Everyone was very enthusiastic. I will definitely do them as a party activity again.

Fun to make with others - even more fun to eat.   These were really delicious.   Have to remember that they are not meant to "stuffed".

It takes some practice to get the spring rolls wrapped up, but it's well worth the effort!  I added tiny strips of carrot and red and yellow peppers for color.  Make both dipping sauces - they are both delicious and very different from each other.  These spring rolls are light, refreshing, and healthy!  Highly recommended!

These tasted so fresh and healthy. Couldn't find Thai basil, so used normal basil, which probably changed the flavour a lot, but they still were delicious.

Great recipe. You can be creative with these. I used chicken instead of shrimp. I added spring onions and diced jalepenos, and used cabbage instead of lettuce. My local store didn't have Thai basil, so I skipped that, and it was fine. Whatever veggies you have on hand, you can throw in. They're awesome.

I'm rating this recipe based on the sprill rolls only and not the dipping sauces (as I didn't have those ingredients on hand).  I really loved these and the most important ingredient is the Thai basil.  I can only find this at an Asian market, so these are a special occassion for us.  I made a few changes to match my local Vietnamese restaurant.  I left out the mint but added more fresh veggies such as carrots and cucumber.  I really like the texture and flavor these add.  My husband prefers a chicken satay version of these (made with chicken, satay sauce, and cilantro), but I prefer these.  Either way, this is a satisfying and healthy dinner.

We thought these tasted a lot like the spring rolls we've enjoyed in Vietnamese restaurants, except more minty.  I put in some cucumber slices and bean sprouts.  I was surprised at how easy the rice wrappers were to work with.  This would make such a nice hors d'oeuvre for many occasions. I was wondering, do you really have to chop the herbs and lettuce though?

These were pretty delicious and very easy to make. I made them as appetizers for a summer meal and put them in the fridge a few hours before the guests arrived and simple pulled them out when the dinner was beginning.  I withheld the cilantro because I find that cilantro is too overpowering. I didn't have all the ingredients for the dipping sauce, so I made my own of sesame oil, hoison sauce, and fresh lime juice (and it was amazing).

Spring rolls just like in the restaurants!  I use a different peanut sauce recipe though - it calls for peanut butter, hoisin sauce, lemon juice, and sugar (hoisin sauce is much too strong on its own).  Thanks for the recipe!

These were really good.  I did change a bit to suit our taste.  First I did not put mint(next time i will) and I added cucumber and carrots and did not put the shrimp in as I was having these for a side.  Rolling these were easier than I thought it would be.  I used bought the square wraps my mistake but they worked just fine.  I rolled them on the diamond.  I placed some of the filling towards the bottom and rolled once and then tucked the two sides in and rolled the rest.  They came out pretty tight.  I will be make these A LOT and use different veggies....the sky is the limit...oh yea I dipped these in peanut sauce. YUMMY

I think the flavor of these was good, they weren't that hard to make (I'm not sure why people are having difficulty with the wrappers, just don't get them too wet) but the texture was very off-putting for me.  I think they would be much better with more vegetables and fewer noodles.  It was just too squishy, squeamy for my liking.  I Like the idea that others have mentioned of using sprouts instead of the noodles.  I might try that next time.

This recipe is delicious without any adjustments! They are just like the fresh spring rolls that I used to get at a favorite Vietnamese restaurant when I lived in LA. Rolling the rice paper is a little tricky, but  it just takes a little practice. These are a great appetizer & will pleasantly suprise your guests if you are entertaining!

One of the things I love about making these is that you can use almost any fillings that suit your needs. After trying these in a Vietnamese restaurant, we made them at home with leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I have also used broccoli slaw, mixed baby greens, imitation crab, or leftover roasted chicken. Sometimes I substitute brown rice for the vermicelli. Mint and Thai basil aren't always available, but I always use cilantro. Also, these need sauce like salad needs dressing, and hoisin is our favorite.

These were great, and the sauces do make the dish. We followed the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and pan-fried thinly sliced sirloin w red pepper flakes, garlic, etc. and added to the rolls with the shrimp.

These are absolutely perfect. I followed the advice of others and added shredded carrots and cucumber. Didn't do cilantro and mint. The basil was good enough. The sauces were surprisingly authentic as well.

Terrific basic recipe.  I use a bag of cabbage coleslaw and one of broccoli coleslaw.  I add the mint leaves and cilentro into the mix.  I also add some  green onions.  Now, I add all this into a processor and do a few quick chops for a good mix and handy to use.  Next time I'll add some crab meat.  After the mix, I'll add some olive oil and hosin sauce and toss.  Then, into the microwave for about a minute and a half.  On a damp rice wrap I'll but a strip of peanut butter.  On the strip of peaunut butter I'll lay some thin strips of red bell peppers and some bean sprouts.  Then, spoon my coleslaw mixture onto it along with some lettuce leaves.  Roll it and munch away.

OMG!!! These were so good and so easy to make. I don't like peanut sauce so I didn't make it but the fish sauce was so good. I have tried to make it before and it didn't come out and it was so good and easy to make will definitely make again and again.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe and added cucumber & carrot.  Didn't use the fish sauce, did the one part SMOOTH peanut butter & one part hoisin sauce.  No mint.  Fun to make but will take some practice with wrapping!

I absolutely loved the dipping sauce!  I order these all of the time when I go out for Pho, but your sauce was what put this over the top tonight.  I didn't have any limes so I used lemon juice, but it turned out great.  Thank you for the recipe!

Tasted great if not a little plain; I tried the hoisen sauce because I have no use for a lot of fish sauce. I did also add the boiled pork like some suggested and also cucumber because it gives it a more refreshing taste. For the sauce, I added a little sugar and lime juice .

Eat as soon as you make them because rice paper will get hard if not moist enough. With good quality ingredients, these taste very good.

Yum! I love these at the restaurants and was very happy with how they turned out!  We used firm tofu slices instead of shrimp, and next time I'd cut back the portion of mint a bit.  But, the FRESH herbs were delightful and I love the texture of the rice vermicelli (rice sticks in our grocery story) and the wraps.  Yum.  Thanks!

These were amazingly delicious. I added julienne carrots and napa cabbage instead of lettuce.  Also, the sweet garlic chili sauce was great.  I didn't use fish sauce and it wasn't missed.  I added fresh squeezed lime juice to the hoisin sauce to take away some of the sweetness.  Everyone loved them.

Really good! I didn't know how to roll them so that took a little practice-- and I made the mistake of cutting out the vermicelli noodles (trying to cut my starch intake) so they were to vegetable-y. but if i hadn't done that these would be great. 

i added chopped cashews into the sauce and added soy sauce, just a touch. didn't use fish sauce so it was totally vegan. we were amazed at how good the sauce was!

ADD MORE SHRIMP!  We used more basil than mint this took away the chalky taste of the mint.  And used bean sprouts instead of lettuce this gave it a better texture and a little more bitterness. The second time we made it we doubled the shrimp and it was excellent!

Simply amazing. The recommendation for sauce thats two parts hoisin to one part chunky peanut butter was superb. My husband loved it, even without the shrimp(we don't eat shrimp). He assumed it had pork but never missed it with the sauce to eat along with the rolls.

Wow!  All these years I've been ordering fresh spring rolls in restaurants and didn't realize how simple they really are!  I made a big batch of these (2 dozen rolls + both sauces) for a pot luck party, and they were a HUGE hit.  Recommend highly!!

I hate when people make a million changes and then rate the recipe---BUT I'm going to do the same.  I changed a lot according to my own tastes and I'm giving this a five because it's a great base recipe that can be changed using what you like.

My friends and I made these last night(just the rolls, no sauce).  All of us really enjoyed them, however they did take a little bit of time and space to make.  You definitely want to make them ahead if possible.

A good recipe.  Be sure to NOT get the tapioca wrappers as they are much harder to work with.  Besides that, these are a real crowd pleaser and very fresh tasting.

I had to go to a speciality shop to get the ingredients, but these tasted great and were fun to make!  I had these in a Vietnamese restaurant in Florida and in a restaurant in Paris and could never find them anywhere else!  I'm happy now that I can make them on my own with this recipe.

the trick to wrapping without tearing the delicate wrappers is to halve 4 more wrappers, soften them one at a time and place it on top of the whole wrapper so that 1/2 of the whole wrapper is double layered.  So essentially you have one whole layer topped by 1/2 layer. Then place the rest of the ingredients and wrap as usual.

Great recipe, everybody loved it! My taste buds barely noticed the shrimp so next time I'll just leave them out (or you could put more). I also added shredded carrot. The wrappers were a little hard to do since you had to continually keep the dipping water warm, and as a first timer you have to guess when they're done.

Great recipe! I found it easy to set up an assembly line of ingredients starting with the wrappers and the bowl of hot water to make these efficiently. Like others, I only used the hoisin-peanut sauce; the other (fish) sauce is more appropriate for the fried variety.

I added a little fish sauce, sugar and lime juice to my noodles and served it with the hoisin sauce with peanut butter. ( I did heat this on the stove and added a little water as another reviewer suggested.)  I left out the lettuce as the rolls I have had usually don't include it.  These were really, really good.  My only problem was rolling them nice and tight.  I think not overfilling them and practice are the only solution there!  Very nice and light, a perfect compliment to any Vietnamese or Thai dish.

I used left over cooked chicken breast instead of prawns for this. Turned out very yummy especially when dipped in sweet chili sauce. A great light summer meal or lunch.

Yum Yum. Very refreshing appetizer. Love the Hoisin sauce but wasn't too keen on the other sauce. Instead I mixed some chili-garlic sauce, vinegar and sugar and warmed it then let the mixture cool. Add a little bit of salt, delicious!

Added carrots as other posters suggested. I also added broccoli. Put hoisin sauce right in each roll. This works well! Served alone. I ate 4 rolls to feel satisfied. I’m 5’2” and 125 lb. I hope this helps you calculate servings! Would be very good served with soup.

YUMMY!!! I always order these when they are available and was thrilled to make them quickly, easily and very little cost (I do usually have all the Asian sauces etc on hand at my house). The sauces were also easy and super tasted!

Thank you for a great recipe!

Great recipe, however video shows raw shrimp.  Remember to use cooked shrimp as listed in recipe.

Very good!! But I doubled almost everything! Used way more shrimp and added cucumber , avocado, bean sprouts. For the sauce I followed the suggestions and made one part peanut butter, 2 parts hoisin sauce. Added sesame seeds, lime juice and a few squirts of sirachi !! Perfection!

I am made exactly as directed and they were delicious! To save time after chopping the basil, cilantro,mint and lettuce, I combined them in one bowl prior to adding to the rolls.

I used both lettuce and cabbage because I wanted to add crunch.  Added bean sprouts & thinly sliced carrots.  I would also cut back on the water in the dipping sauce.  Loved it.  It’s so good.  I’ve made it about three more times since I first posted a review.

These were awesome and the sauce was great. I added only half the amount of lime juice since it was already pretty tart. I also made a peanut dipping sauce which was just 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup hoisin sauce and agave to taste (for sweetness and more liquid texture).

We're too uncoordinated to wrap it in the rice wrappers so we used bib lettuce.  DELICIOUS!  Great flavor with less work.

Follow the directions on the package for the rice vermicelli and rice wrappers. First sauce was gross so I added sugar until it tasted better then a splash of hot pepper oil mixed well then delicious. The spring rolls are worth the time but the directions are a bit off.

Very Good. The peanut sauce was the best. I used almost the same amount of peanut butter and hoisin sauce, but more hoisin sauce along with some chopped up peanuts plus water and heated it for just a big. I would plan for 3 pieces of shrimp per roll. My only problem was I tried to put too much in. I used noodles, lettuce, basil, small chopped carrots.

I tried my hand at Vietnamese spring rolls. This version is vegan and all rice paper and noodles. I substituted tofu for shrimp. I like cooked tofu and fried up a box - that was a mess. It took me this batch to figure out the workflow.

I'm sorry I have to give this a low rating.  I love Asian food and I wanted to love this but it was just bland, bland, bland, even with all the herbs fresh from my garden.  The rice paper was incredibly sticky and just impossible to eat without the whole thing falling apart.  There must be a way to ameliorate the stickiness but neither the recipe nor the comments provided an answer.  I can't recommend this recipe and I won't be making it again.  I hope I can find another way to use up the rice paper.

I used only cilantro, shrimp, green onions and noodles and it turned out amazing. 

Turn out a quick peanut sauce using a small amount of the fish sauce, water, sweet chili sauce, peanut butter and crushed peanuts and a bit of fresh cracked pepper! It's really easy and makes for incredible dipping sauce for chicken satay as well.

Exactly like those you get at Pho Grand, in south St. Louis. We didn't care for the "thick" sauce. The thin sauce is DA BOMB!

Super simple and not too much work! I did add pork and avocado to mine. I will work harder on the wrappers next time to get them a little tighter and I will buy larger shrimp than I did. Great recipe!

We enjoyed making these spring rolls. We mixed it up a bit by adding chopped pistachios to the soy sauce.

My first try ever at these and went fantastic.
I didn't have the exact ingredients but the video was great at the art of rolling and what to use.  I'm hopefully to find the exact ingredients soon.  Either way this is the recipe that has introduced my family to the Fresh Spring Rolls - thank you!

These were good, and look nice. They did fall apart a bit when eating them. It takes some time to put them together, but that was a fun project with my son.

Fantastic recipe! My family just wolfed it down!!  The prep was lengthy, but that's Asian food for ya.  The review that included the peanut sauce (crunchy peanut butter and hoisin) was the perfect sauce. We liked the one included in this recipe, but mostly just ate the rolls with the peanut sauce.  Use good quality PB, like Trader Joes. YUM!!!

This is the first recipe I tried for spring rolls and loved it. One thing I changed was using two wrappers for each spring roll. If you have a problem with wrappers tearing on you, double them up. It made no difference in taste or consistency in mine.

I also used Chinese cabbage in place of lettuce simply because I needed to use it up. Also, parsley can be substituted for cilantro. If you like cilantro, it's the better choice, but if, like me, it tastes soapy, go ahead and try parsley.

Very nicely made video. :-) I did think it seemed a little funny to hear what sounded like Mexican themed music in the background. The bowls for the sauce are cute, I have the same ones in a dinnerware set I purchased in Boston in Chinatown 17 years ago. They're hard to find. Okay, on with commentary about the spring rolls. The Hoison sauce threw me off a bit, and I'm Italian, lol. That didn't look traditional for peanut sauce. As someone else said, the peanut sauce makes this dish. I will definitely try the other sauce, it looked really good. I would also leave my cilantro leaves whole; looks prettier inside the roll. I would not chop up the basil quite so fine either. Although the wraps are easy enough to find, showing the product in it's packaging would be helpful to newbies. :-)

These were so good. I left out the lettuce and added julienned carrots and cucumbers. I didn't have any hoison sauce so I found a recipe on line and made that homemade. We had them for lunch today and they were a big hit!

This was a fun recipe to try, and even my very picky kids liked it!  I added shredded carrots to the rolls.  I added fresh ground peanut butter to the hoisin sauce.  We will definitely be making this again, especially now that I have a bunch of dry spring roll wrappers in my pantry!

These were very easy (the rolling took a little bit of practice at first), though because I used a lot of chopped/sliced veggies they took a long time to make. Including all of my prep time, I spent almost an hour and a half making a dozen and a half rolls. I made the peanut sauce per the top ranked helpful comment, which was delicious and easy. The rolls and sauce were a big hit when I took them to a friend's place for our girls' night in. Delicious and guilt free (half of us know each other from the gym, haha).

Nothing is wrong with the recipe, but the name. Please don't call the soft fresh roll is the spring roll. Spring roll is fried and crispy. This may be called summer roll.

These turned out very good and I will certainly make them again.  I think everyone changes this recipe since you can put anything you want in spring rolls.  I marinated some chicken breast peaces in teriyaki sauce overnight and cooked it in a wok.  I also used some pickled radish, onion, rice, avacado and cilantro.  I was surprised at how great the mint tasted in these.  It sounded a little strange but I was pleasantly surprised. One thing I found it that you only want to get the rice sheets wet once.  They will continue to soften as you add your ingredients before folding.

Everyone at our party loved the spring rolls. I added julienned carrots and cucumber and took someone else's suggestion for the dipping sauce by mixing peanut butter and hoisin together. Other than my poor wrapping skills they turned out great. ??

Wonderful-  impressed the bridge girls- added peanut butter to the sauce (a must) and only used cilantro for fresh herbs.
They look really impressive but are not hard to make

This was super simple and very easy to assemble! Perfect combination to mimick what you would get at a traditional restaurant. They held together well and tasted great. 

Only reason for 4 stars- the dipping sauce was not that great. It honestly tasted more like fish sauce than you could even tell there was 3 entire tablespoons of sugar in it. And it was entirely just a runny, gross mess of a "sauce". I would suggest sticking to the hoisin sauce recipe you can look up easily on Google. This sauce was the only downfall in what is otherwise spot-on for spring rolls!

I love these!  But, for the dipping sauce I combine two store-bought salad dressings -- Lite House Ginger and a Sesame dressing, half and half, plus a few tablespoons of crunchy peanut butter.  The Sesame dressing is one that Costco previously sold, Feast from the East.  You can purchase this online but it is pretty expensive.  I now use one made by Panera for the sesame taste.

The wrapper is quite difficult to make right so that throws the recipe a little bit. I tried to get supermarket wrapper for time purposes but it showed in the taste, it didn't taste like a vietnamese restaurant springroll. Mostly its a good basic recipe for the roll, but the result was just ok.

I've made these afew times as appetizers and for a quick lunch.  They are easy and a good way to use up herbs & veggies!  I've added different combos of veggies depending on what we have onhand.  I have a julienne peeler that makes shredding a bit easier.  The hardest part is prepping the vegetables.  I used carrots, red cabbage, cucumber, green onion, red bell pepper and rice noodles.  Served with a peanut-ginger hoisin sauce.  Spiced with Siracha, lime juice and garlic thinned with warm water..

I'm Vietnamese and have been eating 'goi cuon' or spring rolls since I was a kid. I made these with the addition of boiled pork cut into slices and pieces of a hardboiled egg. Also, I added a slice of cucumber for crunch and a sliver of green onion lengthwise to each roll. I used 4 medium shrimps per roll and always place the shrimp on the paper first. This is for presentation because it should be seen underneath the rice paper afterwards.

These rolls have the best great flavor and pretty easy to make. I used teriyaki pork I soaked over night and baked the next day! They can be a little hard to roll but it's worth the extra time. My family said they were way better than store bought ones! Fresh is the best way to go with these! So happy I tried this recipe very tasty!

I live in North Dakota, so lemongrass is hard to come by, but even without, it's still a wonderful recipe! They are so worth the effort. I used some of Kats11's suggestions, and also added ground peanuts to the rolls (not authentic, I just love them that way.)

I made it with shrimp and I also made these with canned chicken. The best....I used a little oil after I made each one so they wouldn't stick together. Delicious

Turned out great!. An easy way to soften the rice wrapper is place wrappers one at a time in a pie plate that has enough warm tap water in it to cover rice wrapper. Let soak 15-30 seconds or until it's pliable  enough to roll. I find different brands have various soaking times so just keep checking it until softened. I often make these on warmer days makes a delicious refreshing lunch.

These are delicious and healthy (except for the homemade Thai peanut sauce I made for dipping.) The combo of mint, basil and cilantro lends such a crisp, fresh taste. We filled with cucumber and carrots strips in addition to the other ingredients. Yum!

This was great.  I did add some carrot and cucumber for crunch and left out the lettuce.  It was so "fresh" tasting - healthy!  Will definitely make again.

These were delicious! I loved them with the lime fish sauce. My husband loved them with the peanut-hosin sauce. For the hosin sauce I used 1 heaping tbsp peanut butter, 2 tbsp hosin sauce and chopped 1 tbsp of roasted peanuts, added some water to thin it a bit. Then, heated it in the microwave for 40 sec. To the rolls I added bean sprouts, julienned  carrots, sliced cucumber and boiled 1/2 pd thinly sliced pork in a  mixture of soy sauce water and pepper to flavor the meat. Then salted and peppered the pork immediately after removing from the water. I also used 3 halves of shrimp per roll instead of 2 and also used 3 slices of pork per roll. These are so fresh tasting its amazing. Make sure to use the fresh herbs! It makes these pop.

These are great! I soaked the noodles for an hour in cold water before I boiled them for one minute. Next time I will add more Thai basil. Huge hit! The sauces are a must as well.

Great recipe.  Even though I simplified it a bit the spring rolls turned out AMAZING! My local grocery store does not carry Thai Basil so I just didn't include it. I also seasoned the shrimp with a tiny bit of salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Also, adding cucumber to the roll gives it great crunch and flavor.  I don't understand why the 2 different dipping sauces were included in this recipe. Every time I've ever had Vietnamese Spring Rolls they've come with peanut dipping sauce. I followed previous reviewer's advice and made a dipping sauce using 2 parts hoisin to 1 part peanut butter, with a little bit of water. I also added a bit of sriracha to the sauce and it was INCREDIBLE! My new favorite peanut dipping sauce recipe. Wow!!  All-in-all I was extremely satisfied with the final product. I don't think I'll ever order out for these again!

One of our favorite meals to "shake things up" from the normal "american" meals we tend to eat.  Its about a easy as tacos to make and served the same.  A fun one and we all love it - even the kids!

Delicious!! This is one of my favourite recipes. Since the all recipes website changed I think I lost some of my notes-the sauce tasted different - so next time I think I will try using half water, half rice vinegar for the "sauce" instead of 2 tbs water. Other than that I love it as is, but it does benefit from some shredded carrot and long and thin slices of cucumber. As another reviewer suggested, I like to make peanut sauce with 1 part peanut butter, 2 parts hoisin. SO DELICIOUS!!!

I had a lot of trouble getting my rolls to look right, but I'm sure that's something that would come with practice. The rolls were delicious and fresh, perfect for dinner on a hot summer day. I took some of the other reviewers' advice and added some melted peanut butter to the hoisin sauce, and that was so good that we were fighting over it. Neither of us really cared for the fish sauce based sauce though, so I won't make that one again.

Loved these fresh spring rolls its my first time making them and they turned out great. Made them at lunch time while my wife was walking the dogs and they were ready when she returned. I made 8 and she devoured 6 and said she loved them, I loved them too. It is great praise from her as she is Thai and we eat Asian food all the time. Thanks for the recipe.

I was worried I'd ruin these and the rice paper took me two rolls before I got the hang of it.  This was a great starter and has opened me up to a whole new world of cooking!  I made them for lunches using all sorts of differnt fillers and they have been quite a hit with my husband.

Excellent took a little longer than stated especially for my 1st time.
They turned out great. I took the advise from Kats11 for her peanut sauce and OMG the combination was amazing thank you!. I also added red peppers, carrots and cucumber.

I loved the combination of herbs--they made it taste fresh and summery. Four stars, very good, but five stars with carrot and cucumber for crunch and the peanut butter/hoisin mixture for dipping as other reviewers suggested. My wrapping technique-- I put the shrimp next to the veggie/noodle mixture, rolled once to cover the veggies, folded in the corners, rolled the rest of the way over the shrimp.

These were so wonderful....the only extra thing I added was chopped water chestnuts...and we also had spring roll plum sauce as an extra choice.

Very easy and delicious. I didn't have cilantro and still tasted good. I also just used a peanut butter dressing instead of the dips on this recipe since I didn't have all the ingredients handy.

This is yummy with peanut sauce for deeping.  But it is called Rice wrap and Spring roll is the deep fry roll one.

These were tasty. Especially since I cooked the shrimp on the BBQ. A bit time consuming to prep and assemble so I haven't made them since. Pretty good for family time in the kitchen.

Not overly difficult, but the clear sauce simply lacked any noticeable flavor. I think that the quarter cup of water may have diluted the flavor.  The actual rolls were surprisingly easy...after botching the first three...but the only saving grace to this was the hoisin sauce and peanut dip. 

The clear dipping sauce bombed. Flavorless.

Great basic recipe.  I often incorporate variations like using browned tofu in place of the shrimp or skipping one or two of the herbs if I don't have them on hand and they always come out well.

very good. The ones I have had in the restaurant had carrot in them. Next time I will add the carrot...I think it needs both the added crunch against the soft noodle for texture and the color.  The wrapper dipping: after the first couple I got the hang of how long to keep it in the water by feel...when the water was hot it was very short but as the water cooled a bit I had to hold it in longer.I also found on the first couple that I had trouble with the rice wrapped sticking when I rolled it,but if I put a bit of water on a plate and put the wrapper on a wet plate while rolling it did not stick and tear the wrapper.  On the sauce: overall very good though I personally do not like fish sauce so I subsituted oyster sauce which I personally like all better. My daughter liked them but she does not like cilantro so asked the next time I make them without it.

Payoff for hunting down the ingredients, for the prep time and effort, was minimal.  Sorry to say, the flavors werent very satisfying either; the stuffing seemed too sparse; was my first time working with rice wrappers, but did not turn out as expected.  Dissapointed with meal.  Happy to know this worked for so many others.  Just not my personal cup of tea I suppose.  Now off to find other recipes to use up all my leftover ingredients! ;)

Excellent sauces.  DH ended up mixing the two of them together.  It is quite the technique though to fold them....I think we are trying to over stuff them most of the time.  Thank you for sharing.

I love this recipe, they taste delicious and are fun to make.  The only change I made was to the spicy sauce because I personally don't like fish sauce so I only added a very small amount of it.  I also like you can change it up and make it your own.

Good, but I think would be better with more veggies like cucumber, carrots...anything. It just doesn't have as much taste as I thought it would. Will make again but maybe try adding a few more vegetables to the mix. Thanks!

I always order spring rolls at Vietamese restaurants but I don't see why I'd ever need to again. These are amazing. You can make them your own by adding other ingredients you like, but this recipes is PERFECT. The sauce is great.

The perfect simple Vietnamese fresh spring roll! I added other ingredients to my tastes such as shredded carrots and cucumber. I also tried this recipe with chicken instead of the traditional shrimp and it was great! This is a very versatile recipe!

I found these tricky to put together but loved the flavor of the end result. The rice papers are difficult to work with so I'm hesitant to dive right into another batch. The advice of other reviewers are helpful and a thai sauce side works well.

Made this twice in as many weeks. I've tried it as written and have also added rice noodles and shredded carrot to the filling.  Both ways were yummy and I'm looking forward to trying other variations in the future. It can be a bit labor intensive but the end result is quite rewarding.  Especially if you invite someone special to help in the kitchen.

Very good recipe.  This is one recipe that you can omit or add additional items such as stated in one of the review below.  I personally love to add cucumber to my rolls. I normally add sliced baked chicken or bbq pork to kick this up a notch.

not bad... they were out of rice wraps at the supermarket, so I used the egg wraps and made it unhealthy by frying it.  Very nice with the first dipping sauce.

WOW!  I have always loved these but been afriad to try them, I always thought they looked hard!  Very easy!  I didn't find Garlic Chili Sauce, so I used Sweet Thai Chili Sauce.  I didn't have any of the mint or Thai Basil.  I used 4 pieces of shrimp (2 on bottom, 2 on top)cut in half lenght wise, cilantro, matchstick carrots, a cole slaw cabbage mix, and bean thread noddles.  YUMMMMMMY!!  I LOVE the fish sauce, I made it up before starting anything else and put it in the fridge, its GREAT!  I am SO glad I tried these and very GLAD I have enough to make more this week!!  Easy recipe to follow!!
Also....I have made egg rolls in the past and personally feel RICE PAPER is MUCH easier to work with than Egg Roll Wrappers, they are very stretchy, and the best tip is take them out of the water, a bit before they are soft, they get softer while you are working!  I am ready for my DH to get home, I tested 1/2 of one and am ready for more..lol.

Just like the real thing that I usually buy.  Both sauces are good with them.  A little tricky to roll..maybe it's just me. But well worth the time.

I have always loved these, but have had to go to a restaurant to get them. Thanks so much for showing me I can make them myself, and I think mine were just as yummy as at my favorite Vietnamese Restaurant. It did take some practice rolling them. I suggest wrap them tight; you would think they tear easily but they don't. I wrapped them at the ends first so that all the good ingredients wouldn't slide out. Also, I did not have the basil required in the recipe so I used regular fresh basil and it worked out well. The fish sauce was yummy but I will omit it next time b/c it kind of makes the rolls soggy.

LOVE this recipe. I use tofu instead of shrimp, although I bet the shrimpe is tasty. I also put grated carrot and cucumber in there as well. It's time consuming to prepare and make--but I usually do a double batch so they at least last the day! YUM! What a great way to get fresh, nutrious, raw veggies and herbs.

This is a great recipe but the carrot part that someone says is wrong, I've never been to a restaurant that had carrots in it, only the fake ones do, all the authentic ones don't have it.

Great dish I've enjoyed in restaurants.  I like the herbs used in this version, although I don't use Thai basil cause I don't know where to get it yet - I use a little extra mint and cilantro.  I didn't like the fish sauce dip (though I do like it at restaurants), but thought the hoisin-peanut mix was great! Sometimes I add chopped cucumber.

This style of spring roll is a relative unknown in these parts and we served them at a party. Instant hit. The fish-sauce dipping sauce is great.

if its Vietnamese Spring Rolls you want, this is the recipe. Like other stated, Thai Basil is an important component. You can add/change up the veggies and meat easily. The fish sauce dip is great, its replacing a different sauce I generally make. The best part, soo very healthy and great on a hot day!

Thank you!! I finally found the fish sauce for these rolls, my mom make these all the time.  However, whenever I ask her how to make the fish sauce, she says, "a pinch of this and that".  I could never perfect it.  Now that I stumble upon this, it is perfect every time! I can finally enjoy spring rolls with great sauce!

I enjoyed these, the wet towel trick does work as someone mentioned in their review.  I agree the mint was a little to strong.  But overall I was pleased and will make these again..I tried the sauces and liked them too!

The fish sauce was too overwhelming (both scent and taste).  And I'm the type of person who loves pretty much everything and has an iron stomach.   The rolls themselves were ok  - I think they needed more ingredients on the inside.  Carrots definitely, and maybe twice the vermicelli.  I mixed 2 T hoisin and 1 T smooth peanut butter and then mixed in enough water to thin it out.  This was the BEST part!  I will not make this again.

A great, low cal snack.  I found these easier to make than expected.  Another reviewer is right, don't over-soak your rice wrappers.  I used a cookie sheet with a little warm water in it, layed the wrapper in it, flipped it, and let it drip.  Only about 1/2 second on each side.  I don't particularly like the hoisen (I made it 2 parts hoisen to 1 part PB).  its a little to sweet for such a light food.  I will try this with the other sauce tomarrow.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Make sure to go easy on the mint and basil...it may overpower the other flavors. As a tip, I would coat the shrimp in oyster & soy sauce for some flavor.

These spring rolls were AWESOME and not too hard to make.  Next time, I will use less cilantro - I really don't care for the taste.  I also recommend the hoisin sauce/peanut mix.  I liked this one MUCH better than the fish sauce blend.

I think I will try using fresh veggies next time instead of shrimp... the shrimp just didn't do much for me in these rolls. Otherwise a very yummy recipe! Easy to make too!

Wonderful recipe. So fresh and original in taste. I wish the wrappers were a little more tasty, but that has nothing to do with the recipe itself. I have made this 3 times now.
