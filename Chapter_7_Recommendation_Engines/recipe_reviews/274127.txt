6.19.19  Half-cup biscuits are HUGE and they certainly did spread out, so don't place too closely on the baking sheet.  They're way too big for us, but that’s easy enough to fix.  Next time, I’m going to measure out some 1/3 cup and 1/4 cup and see which one we like better.  Had to cook about 5 additional minutes for them to be done.  Don't skip the paprika, that really helps the biscuit's eye appeal  The biscuit is fairly flat, but the flavor is very good, texture a bit heavy and just a little doughy, but we liked them well enough to make again.  And oh my, are they ever to easy to make.
