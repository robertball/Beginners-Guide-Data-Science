This lasagna was delicious and easy!  I did make a few minor changes though.  First, I used ground beef instead of breakfast sausage, because that's what I had.  I used an 8 oz package of oven ready lasagna noodles and omitted the water from the recipe.  I made extra cottage cheese/sour cream mixture and added extra parsley.  I will make it like this every time, it was so good (and I've never been a big fan of lasagna)!  Thanks for the recipe.

After slaving (and hating) making traditional lasagne for years, I finally don't mind making it!Use a good quality italian sausage and it turns out even better.  Also low-fat/fat-free sour cream and cheeses works fine.

This is a great recipe.  I am only 15 years old and it was very easy for me to prepare and everyone loved it.

I made a few changes and it turned out great. I sauted one small chopped onion and used ground beef instead of sausage. I think next time I'll use sausage and beef. I added diced fire roasted tomatoes, and substituted shredded Italian mixed cheese for the mozzarella and parmesan cheese. I also substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese. It was yummy. I didn't use the boiling water, but took a tip from another to wet the dry noodles completely with water and made sure they were completely covered with sauce and cheese. Worked like a dream. It's fun to personalize!

Just as it says.  Super simple and easy and it tasted really good considering the amount of effort in the prep.  I followed the recipe exactly and I will make this again adding some more flavor/spices next time.

We did not care for the breakfast sausage or the cottage cheese in this recipe;  was quick and easy but also taste like a quick and easy recipe; will stick to my time consuming recipe.

I was always "afraid" to make lasagna, but this recipe is amazing. It's simple and you may easily change the ingredients to your liking. My husband and I loved this!

My family loved it! I accidentally did this with "oven ready" lasagna noodles and omitted the 1 cup water and it was perfect.  I have avoided lasagna for over a year because of it being so labor intensive...not any more! Thanks, Sarah.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I seasoned the cottage cheese/sour cream mixture with salt and fresh ground pepper. I totally forgot to add parsley, but it still turned out yummy. After adding the jar of sauce to the meat, I swirled the water in there to get every last bit out and added it to the meat mixture. I think this will be even better with the addition of spinach and various cheeses and I won't forget the parsley next time! I'll keep this one for sure!

My family loves this recipe. I normally double it and freeze the second batch for a quick dinner later.   DH doesn't care for all that sausage, so I normally substitute half ground beef and half sausage cooked together.

You can't beat this for ease! I have been making it for years, but always use low fat ricotta in place of the cottage cheese.

The beauty of this recipe is that Missy gave us a base to work off of. The first time I made it, I followed it to a "T". The second time I used beef ravioli, the leftover sauce with meat from the first effort and provolone cheese instead of mozzarella. My next effort will be a mixture of leftover raviolis from the first meals, new sauce and cheese will be chef's choice. We were very impressed with both times we have had it and am already looking forward to the next meal. Thanks, Missy!

This is a very good recipe.  I used a sausage pasta sauce so in addition to the sausage already in the lasagna it was a little overwhelming, but very good nonetheless.  I also added some ground red pepper to the pasta sauce to give it a little kick, which I hughly suggest.  Enjoy!

I used hamburger instead of sausage and added lots of spices cuz we like it spicy.  I used no boil noodles and omitted the water.  It was good but my husband said it needed more sauce.  Will make again and use more sauce, regular lasagna noodles and add water to the sauce instead of pouring around the edges.

THIS recipe is always a hit whenever I make it.  I usually use spicy pork sausage to give it some kick. I use lowfat cottage cheese and lowfat sour cream sometimes to cut down on the fat. you can't even tell the difference.
I've made this plenty of times and will continue to make it!! :)

Good and easy recipe.  I added the water to the sauce after it was warmed up instead of pouring it around the edges - it cooked the noodles and didn't pool on the top.  Spicy Italian sausage added more flavor.  I will definately save this recipe!

I've been making this for 4 years after I found this recipe on Allrecipes.  Everyone enjoys it and it is soooooooooooo easy!  No alterations needed.  Just keep in mind it won't be ready till about 1.5 hours after you put it in the oven.  Plan ahead.

Boy, did this ever sound like something I needed to make after a day at work!!
I was waaaaay to tired and had just happened to buy a package of no cook lasagna.  I thought it was  just ok.  I undercooked it initially, and needless to say, that was bad, but even after cooking it longer, I found the spices to be lacking.( I actually pulled up some of the layers and added fresh minced garlic and basil.  I too used a sweet italian sausage and a ground beef mixture as the meat layer, which next time I will season when cooking as I usually do. I also reduced the amount of water as previously suggested and the consistency was fine.

Five Star all the way.   This was too simple to be this delicious.  I knew I had all the ingredients to make this, but when I got home I discovered that my box of lasagna noodles was only an 8 oz.  So I cut the recipe in half (for the most part) and baked it in a 9 x 9 dish.  It turned out wonderful.  This is being added to my favorites.  Whoever thought week day lasagna could be so quick and tasty?  Thank you Sarah for sharing this one!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe the sour cream really makes it special I add 2 beaten eggs and 1/2cup parmesan cheese to the cottage cheese mix  So good! No need to boil the noodles and so much more flavor as it bakes the noodles absorbs the flavors The secret is to add 2/3 to 1 cup water and then let it stand 15-20 minutes! can add  Italian sausage, ground beef  mushrooms, you like I usually make my own sauce when I make this recipe we like more sauce than called for

This didn't turn out very well for me.  I used Italian sausage as suggested in another review, but the taste was still pretty bland.  Also, I had to cook it for about 45 minutes longer and move it up to 400.

Excellent Sunday afternoon bake-Sunday evening (and several lunches afterwards) enjoy recipe. Easy to make, delicious to enjoy. Substitute one pound medium italian sausage instead of the brown-and-serve, and you will not be disappointed.

This was a great recipe for easy lasagna.  Being a vegetarian I omitted the meat and used a 24 oz. tub of small curd cottage cheese ~ instead of the 16 oz called for.  I also used a little more mozzarella cheese and two regular sized jars of pasta sauce.  I really like this recipe and will probably tweak it just a bit and make it again for sure.  My husband thought three and 1/2 stars but I think four and 1/2.  I have a feeling this will be even better reheated. Thanks!

This is a very easy and delicious recipe. I did follow the measurements for the ingredients exactly as specified and found out that there was not enough meat sauce to cover a 9x13 pan, and there  was way to many noodles. I used a 9x9 the next time and it worked just fine. I also used ground beef and added some chopped onion.  My family loves this lasagna and it's so easy!

Very good recipe.  Needs some modification, though.  Leave out the water.  Add extra sauce, plenty more.  And I used Bertolli's sauce with sausage flavor.

I really liked this recipe.  It was super easy to put together and tasted great!  I left out the water altogether (by accident....i forgot it! lol) and it turned out just as good for me without it.  I'll continue to use this recipe in the future when i make lasagna.

This was a great recipe.  The only reason I did not give this recipe 5 stars, is I think there was too much water.  When I pulled it out of the oven, I literally had a mini lake on top of the lasagna.  I had to soak it all up!  But, other than decreasing the amount of water added, I loved this!  Thanks!
