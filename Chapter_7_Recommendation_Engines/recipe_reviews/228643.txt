This recipe is ok.  I found another recipe that recommended broiling them for 2 min per side before boiling.  It makes a huge difference in the quality of the bagel.  The crust that is formed during broiling helps it hold up when boiling.  I tried it both ways.  Though both are edible, the one that was broiled first was much better!!

I love Montreal bagels so I was hoping for a similar bagel. There is some similarity, but still did not hit the mark for my dream bagels. I would add less salt to the boiling water next time. Thanks for sharing Chef John!

These were fun!  They are a little different then what we are used to, but they are very flavorful and I could see doing some different things with them in the future....poppy seed, garlic, cheese toppings.  My only complaint is you would need to make them the night before in order to enjoy them in the morning....makes you really appreciate neighborhood bakeries! :)

First, 1 lb of bread flour is a little over 3 cups. The bagels were very good and my family loved them. My modifications were minor...  I did broil the bagels (on high, middle rack) for 2 min per side before boiling since the dough seemed a little wet.  I boiled with 2 tablespoons of sugar (no salt) because I wanted to top with garlic salt and Parmesan. Instead of an egg wash, I used olive oil. My family lives them and requests them all the time.

I made these more like Montreal-style bagels by adding sugar to the dough and rolling the dough into ropes and hand forming the bagels by joining the ends.  Delicious!

Never made bagels before and these were excellent!  1 lb of bread flour was about 3-1/2 cups, but did add a bit more as they were still a bit too moist.  Next time, I'd use less salt in the water bath and adjust by adding more honey.  

It is important to make sure your baking sheet is prepared with parchment as once you do the egg wash they will otherwise stick (even with some cornmeal.  I forgot to do this on one sheet (whoops), but got them off while they were still hot.  

Next time I may experiment by adding cheeses or changing using half wheat flour to "attempt" to add some more nutrition to the bagel.

Very tasty, but I'm from Argentina and this was the first time I made them because I've never eaten bagels and I wanted to try them. But I love bread and I thought that these were very good. I recommned adding a little bit more of salt, I added 2 tsp. I made them with all-purpose flour and they turned out good, I just let the dough proof a bit longer just in case.

This has instantly replaced my old and more complicated recipe.
I changed the serving to 12 and made 10 of them with cinnamon and raisins.
Only problem was I put 2 trays in the oven at once, so it took forever to bake. I changed them up and down; took them out and put back in… tortured the recipe. Surprisingly, they came out perfect.
Love from Istanbul, Enjoy!

Amazing!  I've been trying a lot of bagel recipes lately and this is by far the best one.  I've made it twice, once following the recipe exactly and the second time I added a bit of molasses and honey to the dough before the mixing.   Both great.  The texture of these bagels is amazing.  By far the most developed flavor of any "3 hour" bagel.  Chef John, your recipes have never failed us.

The flavor was very good and would have been better had I some sesame seeds or poppy seeds. Couldn't find them so MUST have used them up and forgotten.
I know he said they were CHEWY, and boy he was right, I tried one without toasting and it was really tough. I even had a HARD time cutting them, but once they were toasted, YUMMY and CRUNCHY. I gave some to a friend and she too found them hard to cut, but delicious after toasting. I'm going to try again hoping to not have them not so tough the next time.

Excellent recipe, easy to make. My suggestion would be to let it rise longer than the 30 minute rest as it is stated in the recipe. We are in China and bagels are hard to come by so this was perfect. Our friends love them as well.

I loved it so much and I have made it 4 different times. My family and my friends love them. I suggest boiling for one minute per side not two it gives the bagels a more chewy texture. I LOVED IT SO MUCH!

I made this in my bread maker and baked it as a loaf.  I added 1/4 cup agave syrup to add the sweetness missed from the boiling stage.

It made a beautiful bread.  Sweet, chewy, tender texture.  Delicious bagel taste.

I doubled the recipe and halved again the number of bagels (so originally 8 is now 12) - yielded larger bagels great for sandwiches!

First attempt at bagels and I used this recipe. Never buying bagels again! They were the perfect bagel! I put 1 tbsp dried minced onion and garlic in the dough and topped with salt and sesame/ poppy seeds. I had to shorten the time to only 15 min in my old oven so be sure to keep an eye on them. Highly reccomend this recipe.

These were so easy and I loved that I could use my KitchenAid mixer easily for these. My daughter requested them with Parmesan, fiesta cheese, and sesame seeds. Delicious!

These were not bad, but I just did not get the crispness that was shown in the video, but I am no pro so that may explain it.  But, in retrospect the bagels made a mean sandwich so can't complain!!! Thanks Chef John for another fantastic recipe!!!!!!

let the dough rise overnight instead of just an hour and a half. Didn't have sesame  seeds, so I sauteed chopped onion and garlic and topped with that.

They are chewy, and letting the dough rise longer made a rich tasting bagel. These are great tasting, and the instructions are the easiest to follow for a stand mixer, at least out of all the bagel recipes I checked.

before boiling, for me, this yielded 6- 3oz bagels, and 2- 3.5 oz bagels.

If you are looking to make homemade bagels these check all the boxes.

They didn't rise as much and took longer to do so than I thought they would, but it was 14° here today! I didn't have cornmeal or parchment paper, so I used vegetable oil spray on the baking sheet. Definitely recommend drying the bagels a bit on a wire rack after boiling them. I used egg wash and made 4 Everythings and 4 Parm/Reggiano bagels. Set the timer for 20 minutes because my oven runs a bit hot. They were baked perfectly in about 23 minutes

Easy to make. Tastes great. Next time I will cut the dough into 8  pieces.  6 Pieces results are very big bagels.  Might also try an egg wash before placing in oven to get a bit of a crust.

I ended up making just a few modifications to this recipe and it ended up just like the bagels I wound buy from a tiny hole in the wall Jewish bakery in New Jersey! I added   4 teaspoons of honey and only 2 teaspoons of salt to the water. Also, I like smaller bagels for portion control so I made mine only 1.5 ounces each instead of 3 ounces. Boiled each 20 seconds per side and baked them 25 minutes. Perfection!!

I've made other bagel recipes before successfully but unfortunately this recipe just didn't work well for me.  The bagels were quite dense.  They were edible, especially toasted, but this is not a recipe I would repeat.

Made a double batch. Girlfriend doesn't like crunchy bagels so I made half chewy and half crunchy. Very good either way.

I followed this recipe to a T and they were terrible.  They were tough, not flavorfuls at all, and salty.

These bagels kicked store bought bagel's butt! I used high gluten flour and add some  diastatic malt powder. Topped them with poppy seeds. Chef John, you are my hero!

My daughter and I decided to make these for Easter brunch. They were not only easy but they tasted great too. My favorite bagel place bagels are “Everything” and “Jalapeno-Cheese”.  I was able to create both easily. Before baking I just used the egg wash as a glue for the Everything bagel toppings. For the Jalapeno Cheese bagel, I crumbled pepper jack cheese around the top (after egg wash) then added sliced fresh jalapenos on top of the cheese with a little more egg wash to help them stick before baking. These were FANTASTIC! This week I’m going to make cinnamon and honey.  Thank you again Chef John!

Yum!  I made these for the family and they inhaled them.  Even the plain have more flavor than any specialty store.  So then I made them for a teen swim team and they came back for seconds and thirds.  You know a recipe is a success when you can serve it to a crowd!  To speed things up, I combined steps 1 & 2 in a bread machine on standard cycle without any noticeable loss in flavor or texture .

Just made these wonderful bagels. Didn't change a thing. Varied the toppings, and they were a huge success! Thank you Chef John! Perfect New York bagels with less dough (although some did rise a bit more than others).

We don't have a bagel bakery where we live, and the supermarket doesn't carry garlic bagels, which are my husband's favorite. This recipe was so simple, I'm kicking myself for not trying to make them myself earlier. I put minced fresh garlic on half of them on the egg wash stage, and they were heartily approved. The non-garlic half were approved by me ^_^

Made these last night.  Excellent.  Now Chef John, if I want to add raisins and cinnamon, exactly how much would I use and when do I add?

Very easy and very delicious. Its worth trying to try making your own bagels.  I've tried it with real maple syrup instead of honey for a slightly different taste.

Awesome, these are well worth it and not nearly as painful as making other bagels. I made this recipe with half whole wheat flour the second time around - yummy!! Thank you so much for this recipe!!
