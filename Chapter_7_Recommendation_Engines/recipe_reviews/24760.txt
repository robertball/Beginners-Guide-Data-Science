To cut time and cleanup I stir fry the onion and cabbage together then add the cooked pasta, soy sauce and seasonings and heat. Works just as well it doesn't heat the kitchen and saves alot of time.

This was a very good way to eat cabbage.After reading previous reviews I also cooked my cabbage with the onions. It came out so sweet. I did add an extra tablespoon of soy sauce and I think it needed it.I was hankering for some good cabbage and this took care of it.

I love cabbage and pasta! The only reason I gave this four stars is because I think that the baking step is unneccesary. I baked this for 30 minutes at 400 degrees rather than 450 and some of the pasta came out crispy. But all in all this was great! I liked the addition of the soy sauce.

To make this recipe a bit easier to put togeather, I boiled the cabbage and the pasta (I used pasta shells)in the same pot, and I didn't saute the onions (less fat). I also added some frozen peas and garlic to the mix. Yummy.

This is a favorite in our home.  We sometimes add Kiebasa for a simple and fun "one-dish meal"  Thanks for this recipe.

This was awesome. I chopped the cabbage very coarsely, used rotini instead of spaghetti, used half of a large onion, and added one small can of mushrooms (drained) and about a cup of frozen peas. I cooked the cabbage for maybe 8 minutes and I sauteed the onion and mushrooms in 2 TBS of butter instead of oil. Oh, and I added just under a pound of kielbasa, diced, into the pan with the onion and fried it up a little before combining everything. I used more like 4 TBS of soy sauce and I only baked it for maybe 15 minutes. The only problem I had is that the pasta dried out a bit while it was baking. Next time, I might omit that step entirely. But it was really good! Thanks so much for sharing, Auntie Elmo!

I really like this one.  It reminds me of a Hungarian dish I grew up with that had cabbage fried in bacon fat, with pasta shells & lots of black pepper.  This achieves the same flavor in a much healthier way.  The only problem I had with this is the spaghetti.  In an unbroken state it is very difficult to mix evenly with the cabbage.  I will use shells or rotini next time, or break the spaghetti in thirds.  This is a definite keeper.

When I saw this recipe, I thought, "What a weird combination of ingredients. Cabbage, onion, spaghetti, and soy sauce? That can't possibly be good!" But I made it anyway because of the good reviews and was amazed to find out these flavors all go together wonderfully to create an easy, tasty, economical dish! My only changes were using one onion instead of two (my husband doesn't like onion) and adding polish sausage. I will definitely make this again!

I took the advice of previous reviews and cooked the cabbage for about 10 minutes and then added in the noodles in the same pot.  I also used 3 tbs of soy sauce (which it DEFINITELY needed) and cut up some hotdogs into the mix before baking.  My 3 children (ages 3 to 6) LOVED it!!!  It was a big hit with my husband too.

At first bite, I wasn't sure, but this dish really grows on you.  I decided I love it.  The only problem is that you use sooo many dishes to prepare it which is amazing since there are so few ingredients. In spite of this, I WILL have this again!

I was looking for a recipe that was similar but different from my mom's recipe (since I constantly use my mom's noodles and cabbage recipe).  I think I will stick with mom's and not try to mess up a good thing...to me this dish was bland.

This is pretty bland but did expect that since basically only spaghetti, cabbage and onions. But, it is a good way to get cabbage into your diet as it is soooo good for you.  Will make this periodically.

This recipe is ok.  I think the cabbage needs to be stir fried with the onions or something to add a little more flavor.

I use this recipe alot when I am interested in having cabbage.  I really enjoy how cabbage gets a sweet flavor when cooked instead of being so tart.  I haven't actually put this in the oven and usually add a package of seasoning from chicken lo-mein to mine.  It is really good.

I really liked this recipe but I done a few things different. I added strips of leftover ham and a little more soy. I sauted the cabbage and onions together. I didnt use the whole head of cabbage because I thought it was going to be too much. I think it would of been much better if I would have. And I didnt bake in the oven. But overall I liked it.

Great side dish. It's different and flavorful and my kids loved it. I boiled the cabbage and pasta together to save cleaning a pot. I also used rotini pasta rather than spaghetti for prettier presentation.

Granted, I didn't follow the instructions... I'm still giving it only 4 stars. Don't stir-fry this people. I read one of the comments and tried to stir fry this meal instead of boiling the cabbage, and cooking it in the oven. It just didn't turn out the way its supposed to. I added sausage, which tasted great, and I could tell this recipe had potential... but stir-frying this is not a good idea.

Pretty good. I added a little butter to the olive oil so as not to oxidize it. Right at the end, I mixed in a couple of ounces of cream.  And I added about a cup of mixed Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. I took it to a large cast party for a play with 100 kids 8-18 and their families, a double recipe of it, and didn't get much of it back.

I found this recipe when searching for a dish my friend who lives in Ethiopia could make with easily obtained/common ingredients.  It was pretty good, but I ended up adding a little more soy sauce, crushed red pepper flakes and a dash of maple syrup to give it an Asian sweet/spicy flavor.  I might add some ginger the next time around.  Per others' recommendations, I also sauteed the cabbage and onion together while the spaghetti was cooking and I did not bake it in the oven at all.

Great for a low fat, low cholesterol diet. Used other reviews suggestion and sauteed the onion and cabbage in the same pan. For those not on a low fat, low cholesterol diet add some Kiebasa.
