Oh these are really good! I did use apple sauce for the oil. I didn't realize I had used the last of my oil when I made brownies. But I loved it with the apple sauce so I'll probably do that from now on. I used Cream Cheese Frosting II on this site for the frosting because its one of my faves. Thanks for the recipe I will be making these again.

These tasty and moist, but quite dense.  Perhaps I worked the batter for too long?

I used my leftover candied yams and cut the sugar to half a cup since the yams were already sweet. These cupcakes are beyond amazing. Fluffy, moist and full of flavor! Thanks for an amazing recipe!

Deeee-licious!  I don't even like yams (I made these for someone else), but after trying these I was hooked.  So moist, perfect balance of sweetness, great frosting recipe, too.  Without the frosting, 4-star review, with frosting, a 5.  4.5 overall

I made these for last thanksgiving, and I'm pretty sure I ate more of them than my family did. It takes some patience with the sweet potato's but its worth it.

It did not taste like sweet potatoes. It was more like a spice cake. Overall it was ok.

Light and fluffy. Not too sweet. Veggies in cupcake form. What could be better.
