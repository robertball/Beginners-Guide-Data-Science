These cookies turned out awesome- but I made a lot of changes. Before adding the zucchini I let it sit with some salt for 30 mins to get the extra moisture out, but that made my batter was too dry so I added another egg. Then I used pumpkin pie spice instead of straight cloves, and with the raisins I tossed in a handful each of pumpkin seeds, pecan pieces and coconut. I ended up with about 4 dozen soft, perfectly golden and very tasty cookies. I may never make them again though, because I can't stop eating them.

YUM!!  Such a great recipe!  But make sure to double it if you want a lot of cookies.  The cloves and cinnamon added just the right flavor.

Bravo on this cookie recipe, Deb C!  I would not have thought of adding cloves to an oatmeal cookie, but it turned out to be absolutely delicious!  I love the fact that I can hide a vege in my husband's cookies (yes, kids come in all ages).  The only thing that was a little odd is that my cookies did not spread out - they stayed mounded, but that could be because I used gluten-free flour.  Other than the GF flour substitution, I made these exactly to instructions, and will definitely make them again.  A not-too-sweet, very tasty, all around great cookie!

Made a few modifications to these delicious cookies.  Sub'd out 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 3/4 c AP, 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c butter, and 2/3 c milk chocolate chips for the raisins.  

Wasn't sure how they were going to come out.  The dough had a weird consistency but they baked out great.   Didn't really spread in the baking and came out very cake like.  Brought them to work and everyone complained I didn't make more.  

Will make again, and again.

I thought these were great, but they didn't really fly with the kids. I made 1/2 with raisins and 1/2 with choc. chips and even the choc. chip ones didn't get rave reviews. But, I loved them! A little bit of a strange texture and didn't keep that well, past a couple days. I think I would make these again to serve fresh if I was hosting a tea/coffee at my house.

YUM!   I made these cookies for Hubby for Father's Day as oatmeal is his favorite cookie.  I did not plant zucchini this year but my friend gifted me some when I had her and her hubby for dinner.  The only thing I did different was to not remove the moisture from the zucchini because I was using parchment paper and did not grease the baking sheet.  We found these cookies very flavorful, delicious, and perfectly moist.  They are like a cross between a cookie and a muffin.  Perfect with a cup of coffee.  Just the right size.  I will definitely make these again the next time I am gifted more zucchini.  Thank you Deb C for sharing such a YUMMY recipe!

Cakey cookies are not my favorite, but I need to use up some of my yellow squash, so decided to try these and so glad I did! Other than yellow squash instead of zucchini and golden raisins I made no changes, these are a nice tasty cookie treat. Thank you Deb C!

I had a good feeling about these cookies even before I baked them.  The spicy cake like texture combined with oats and in my case the addition of a few mini chocolate chips made for a very good cookie.  The cloves are key for me in this recipe…I did add a pinch of salt and tried to squeeze out some moisture from the zucchini…. I wish I made a double batch…. Next time!!!

I made these cookies at the last minute trying to use the last of some grated zucchini  I was using to make bread. my husband said he guessed they were ok. I think he liked them a little more than that as they all disappeared over night. the only change I made was to omit the cloves.

These were so light and airy, not too sweet. Very yummy. Made no changes and plan to make them again soon.

Aside from doubling it (which  I recommend) I changed nothing.  They make a soft cakelike cookie and were loved by everyone lucky enough to get some.

Spicy Zucchini Oatmeal Cookie Haiku: "The taste was quite good, but baked up like 'muffin top', breakfast or dessert?" Recipe submitter says to drop these by rounded Teaspoonfuls which wasn't at all possible at all due to the sticky, clumpy oat-ey texture w/ the zucchini and raisins (oh, incidentally, I used 1/4 c. raisin, 1/4 c. chocolate chip) so I made mine into rather large balls, which baked into what I can only describe as resembling a muffin top. Many other reviews mention it being cakey, which is absolutely true so I found that these veered more towards a breakfast treat. To make these breast-feeding-friendly, I also added 1 TB brewer's yeast, 1 TB wheat germ, and half coconut oil for the butter. Very tasty right out of the oven yum yum!

good oatmeal raisin cookies - nice to use up all this extra zucchini
A double batch makes about 45 cookies of a reasonable size. They freeze really well.

First I doubled the recipe  
I added 1/2 tsp of salt. Extra cinnamon. Extra vanilla   I used 1/2 c butter with 1/2 c shortening. I used Old Fashion Oats and   No raisins for grandkids, but Grammie got extra in hers!  Turned out amazing. Yummy!

Made for a potluck at my school with garden zucchini. I doubled the zucchini, didn't squeeze out any excess water (they were nice and moist and fluffy), added a bit of salt, semisweet morsels instead of raisins, and some walnuts. Would be good with butterscotch chips, too. Very good. Was the first dessert gone and many asked for recipe.
