Triple-dog-dare by ~S~. Awesome idea. I made a few preference changes. Made my own graham crust. Adjusted the recipe to make "9 servings," which made one decently filled 10-inch springform. Used a little more than the full amount of bacon for 9 servings, but cut it into bite-size pieces for managability - glad I did. Used canned pumpkin cuz I had some. Omitted the allspice & clove cuz I don't care for it so much. The rest of the recipe was made as directed - and it is delicious. This particular recipe may not be for you, but it sounds way weirder than it tastes. And pumpkin and bacon absolutely DO go together - there are many, many recipes that support it. Thanks for the recipe - I'm going to do one of these at Thanksgiving! :)

Pumpkin does indeed pair well with bacon, and any other pork product you might like to try.  Just remember to cut the sweetness and spices, or your pie will taste like dessert with bacon=yuk.  We omitted the vanilla extract, ginger, and cloves, and cut the brown sugar to 1/2cup, and half/half to 2/3cup to make pie less jiggly.  Added some chopped onion-to your own taste-and a 1/4tsp. nutmeg.  My sons ate it all at one sitting. You can subs. shredded cheese for some of the cream cheese called for , maybe 3/4 cup, haven't tried it yet.  Thanks Crawford for this versatile and tasty combination!

It was great. The texture of the pie was wonderful.  Sometimes the pumpkin is a bit... quivery. (Which, if you love quivery pumpkin pie, this may not be the recipe for you) This was more solid and delicious.  Rave reviews. I will make this again!

okay, we just tried it, and it was good!!! (we added cool whip to the top. see below)  i followed the recipe exactly (cutting it in half though, for one pie instead of two) except for the pumpkin. i just used 1/4 can of pumpkin instead of cubed pumpkin. we also cut the bacon into bite-sized bits to place in the pie, rather than 7 whole strips. everything else i kept the same, and it turned out yummy. my husband and i both felt it needed to be a bit sweeter though to match the salty bacon. overall the flavor of the pie was more savory, rather than balanced between sweet and savory.   we added cool whip to the top and that gave it the right amount of sweetness that it needed before having to tweak the recipe :) overall though, it was good!!! :D very interesting flavor combo and we liked it!

I cheated (a little). I used the canned pumpkin mix and a frozen pie crust. However, I went all out on the bacon! I bought some fresh bacon from my grocer's meat department and chopped it up into small bits. I cooked it for just a few minutes before I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar all over the bacon bits. I cooked them until they were dark and sticky. I sprinkled the "candied bacon" around the outer edge of the pie then baked it. In hindsight I would have cooked the pie somewhat before adding the bacon to make it more of a topping than part of the pie mixture. My family was apprehensive at first but after one bite they were sold!! I'll be doing this again next year!!!

I did not care for this recipe! Bacon and pumpkin is not a good combination! TRUST ME! It was so embarassing to serve this to my new boyfriend.

This was interesting and delicious.  Definitely worth it to find maple cured bacon, which isn't the most common type you'll find at the grocery.  If I make this again I will use half as much bacon, though -- it was a bit overwhelming.

This is great as is.  I do at times mix it up a little by adding lots of chipotle powder.

Really wonderful. I did not use All Spice (only because I am so not a fan) and I would crisp up Bacon for the top and add when completely done cooking pie. They get too dark for my taste/liking.

Loved this idea!  I've had this recipe saved for years and haven't had the crowd to brave making it in case it didn't go over well.  Made it this year at Easter, and while there were some afraid to try it, the more adventurous really enjoyed it.  I cut the recipe in half to make one pie.  I liked the dense filling, with the cream cheese, but I personally found this over-spiced for my tastes.  I'll try it again with less pie spices.  I did crumble most of the bacon inside the pie before baking, then topped with more crumbled bacon around the edges.  Will try again, and serve with maple flavored whipped cream.  Thanks for sharing!

I chopped the cooked bacon and sprinkled over the top the last 10 min. of baking, otherwise I think it would have burned.  Served with real cream whipped with sugar and maple flavoring.  Rave reviews from those who tried it!

Meh. We didn't care for this. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good enough to make again. We did add the whipped topping after the first taste. That helped, but it just wasn't "to die for" like I expected.
