This is now a family favorite. Quite simple to make and a very tasty and hearty meal. The only change I make is that I haven't been able to find fresh cayenne peppers at the stores I usually shop at, so I substitute ground cayenne instead. Thank you for another winner, Chef John.

Hubby gave this a “10” on a scale of 1-10. He loved it and his favorite food is hot dogs. Easy, simple to put together, forgiving of adaptation and tasty. I made a couple of changes based on what I had available and food allergies. I used natural uncured turkey hot dogs, omitted the poblano and brown sugar, used chili sauce for ketchup, and regular yellow mustard for Dijon. This is a definite make again and will probably make it to the regular rotation. Anyone will like this that likes simple fare, hot dogs, soup, limited ingredients or a quick meal. Thanks for submitting.

Made exactly as stated.  Didn't like, won't make again.  It wasn't inedible, which is why it gets 2 stars.

Only change I made was to add yellow bell pepper I had in the fridge.  Made this especially for my husband who loves hotdogs, and he really liked it - I preferred to just eat he bean soup part.  Thanks Chef John for another good one!

Simple and delicious!  I made mine without the dogs and with vegetable stock for a vegan dish and it was wonderful!  This will be added to my regulars.

I made no changes whatever. Used poblano pepper.  Used beef franks from one of the mail order steak purveyors. Not quite Wagu, but reasonably close. Beats heck out of any other franks & beans!  Without the franks , this would be great bean soup. With vegetable broth rather than chicken, would probably be a  great vegetarian bean soup. Many layers of flavor. Will make again!

Billionaires Franks & Beans Haiku: "I felt like a dork, for thinking this to be good. Good, but not great." I really didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did (I was really making it for the kiddos) but it turns out the big kiddo (DH) and baby (14mo) loved this best, while me and the in between kiddo (8yo) and her friends weren't blown away. I used Boars Head hot dogs (figured if the main protein "star" of the dish was hot dog then I'd better use a good quality one!) and the only sub that I had to make was a bell and a cubanelle for the poblano. I liked that mashing some of the beans along the edge of the pot made it thicken up even more so that it was nice and goopy and just right for scooping onto pieces of toast.

In lieu of poblano and cayenne, I used equal amounts of green and red bell peppers...and just a dash of chili powder, because I was not sure what the heat factor, spice-wise of a poblano & cayenne pepper pile would be. This was easy, and, for me, at least, it was helpful to view Chef John's how-to video. Besides being entertaining, the video via C.J. gives you permission to play things by ear, a bit. DH liked this, actually voicing (in WORDS) his approval vs. the more subtle grunt approvals, or the ever uninspiring "I ate it, didn't I?" compliments.

Just made it and loved it. Didn't have chicken broth so I used one cup beef broth and 1 cup water.  Next time I'm going to try diced bacon in it.

I made it almost exactly as the recipe says, I didn't however have any cayenne peppers, so I use a little cayenne pepper spice. It was VERY good, my husband loved it (he can be picky) its not hard, its not time consuming, but it is delicious. This is going into the rotation!

The next time I will use three cans of cannellini beans and mashing the third can before adding also just two cups of chicken broth you can always add more plus cut the cayenne pepper in half

Oh my gosh, this is so good.

Made with dry pinto beans, smoked beef kielbasa, ordinary  prepared mustard, 2 c chicken broth. 
No poblano, cayenne, green onions. 
Zucchini instead of celery.
No browning, so no butter: just threw it all in the pot.
Didn't mash the beans.
Serve over brown rice for a complete protein.

This came out great! Left out the pepper as my lids don’t like any kind of pepper. So so good. Will keep this and make again. Everyone loved it with a loaf of fresh bread! ;)

Too much hot dog.  If I made this again, I’d cut back on the dogs, and up the beans and veggies.

Another Chef John hit! We love this! My kids are always excited when I say I am making Billionaire Beans and I always double the recipe in order to have enough for leftovers. The only change I make is to add a southeast brand of sausage called Conecuh Sausage from Bessemer, AL instead of hot dogs.

I didn't have any Pepper, so I just left it off. It was very good, a nice easy meal and a change from just a regular hot dog. Will definitely make it again.

I can’t see wasting a good hotdog in a pot of beans.  So, I started with 2 pounds of smoked sausage sliced into 3/4”- 1” thick.   I also sautéed finely chopped celery, freshly minced garlic and chopped onion in olive oil rather than butter.  When the veggies were “clear” I added the smoked sausage rounds.  Other than those changes, I doubled the recipe for a large family dinner.  Oh, I did use Splenda brown sugar., and next time, I will add 1 pound of fresh sliced mushrooms to the sautée mix.   Try it.  I think that you will like it.

Good recipe, will make again. Anonymous misread the recipe. It says to use FRESH poblano pepper and FRESH cayenne. The dried spice aisle products are much hotter. No wonder it was too caliente for her!

DH LOVED IT as did the neighbor bachelor!!!! I did substitute 13oz. 3 pepper sausage from HEB for the hot dogs and didn't have any fresh cayenne so used 1tsp. of powdered cayenne.  Smokin'n hot and sooooo good.  Next time I would add another can of beans to make it a little thicker.  If I were feeding the grandkids I'd probably use hotdogs for a milder meal.  Served with fresh warm cornbread.  Yummy.

This was tasty and surprisingly kid approved despite the visible veggies. I left everything pretty much the same except I substituted red and green peppers for the poblano and the cayenne, and I added one more can of beans. It was great and I will likely make it again.

Fantastic! I cut the recipe in half, didn't have the fresh cayenne but was using Pinto beans with jalapeno (undrained).  Threw in red bell for color. Used Nathan's Angus Dogs and beef broth....because I was cooking with beef. When I started to smash the beans to thicken the broth I still wanted beans...so I drained a can of cannellini and added that with extra broth. I was heavy handed with the mustard, ketchup, etc..from the start so didn't feel anything was suffering. So it was more like an hour of simmering. Turned out great, all was well, and man was happy! Will do again!! Thanks Chef!

I made it with two changes: High quality beef hot dogs, but not all the way to kobe beef, and a touch of molasses instead of brown sugar. The ketchup flavor was too strong - the dish was overly sweet and overly acidic (and I'd even left out some sugar by using molasses instead of brown sugar!). I used a very flavorful ketchup, and I think it might have been overpowering (despite using the amount called for). Two stars because I can eat it, but I definitely didn't like it.

This is yummy, yummy, yummy! My little apartment was filled with the aroma this dish gave off.  I used two different types of hotdogs; Oscar Meyer lean uncured beef franks, and Greenfield uncured smoked pork dogs. I liked the flavor of the smoked pork dogs better so next time I will use Greenfield all the way. I couldn't find fresh cayenne peppers so I was forced to use 1/2 teaspoon of the ground stuff. I made the error of not testing to see if the vegetables were tender before adding the rest of the ingredients so the celery was a bit crunchy. So..don't forget to test this as it does take away from the experience! The flavor was scrumptious and was super filling. Chef John sure is making this one happy household!

It's amazing. Nothing fancy but yet it is fancy (per the name). Very easy to make and everyone here loves it.

Just kind of so-so.  to much work for the end result, pork and beans with hotdogs, would have sufficed.  I used the best franks I could possibly buy (Applegate Farms), and even pressure cooked my beans.  I was just looking for something different, and it sure was different. Leftovers the next day did not look appealing, so it went down the drain.

I substituted cayenne for ground fresh chili paste (what I had available) and chives in place of green onions. My husband and I both liked it but it was to spicy for my son (17 months). To be honest I could have used less sweet and more spice. I think I will only use half a tbl. Spoon of brown sugar next time and replace the celery stalk with a sprinkle of celery salt. Altogether it had many bold flavors and was cheap and quick to make.

I thought this was good but family members did not care for it.  Made as written but will probably not make again.

I don't know what i did wrong but this recipes calls for 2 tablespoons of cayenne pepper or other hot pepper  so I used ONE tablespoon of red pepper flakes and the dish is unedible.  I like hot food but 2 TBLS was too much.  I only used 1 and no one could eat it because it was so hot.  I think it might have been okay with 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes but no where near 2 tablespoons of anything that hot.

Hubby liked this more than I did.  For me it was just OK - I used high quality all beef hot dogs, which made it OK for me but nothing to write home about.
