I was looking forward to replicating the delicious pureed vegetable soup I'd had in the pubs in Ireland this summer but this recipe didn't work for me.

I'm sorry, none my family liked this. I followed to a T and just after I saw the sage amount I questioned myself whether to add or not to add? I added it, because the submitter says 3 TBSPs....but I think it's wrong. The sage is way way over powering and pungent, and you could taste the sweetness of the carrots over it, which made it rather a weird soup that was in-edible. Sorry...not something I'd make or recommend again.

Easy  to prepare from easy ingredients. Have made this for guests  who all enjoyed it.  After making it several times now, I would recommend adding some butter with the olive oil, and reducung the sage to 2 tablespoons
