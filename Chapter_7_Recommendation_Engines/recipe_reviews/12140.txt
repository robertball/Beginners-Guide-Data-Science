WOW! We are picky! Hubby and I just got back from vacation and he loved the chocolate pie at dinner one evening.  I tried some recipes and they turned out with a brownie texture, tried others and they were basically perked up pudding...But this recipe was IT!  (Even better than the restaurant's!!! 
I made a homemade crust, doubled the vanilla and instead of a 12 ounce can of evap milk, I used 10 ounces.  --(2) 5 ounce cans, used granulated sugar which quickly dissolved. Not runny or grainy or lumpy.   170 pound hubby ate 1 1/4 pies in 24 hour time span! LOL

Hubby and I agreed to give this two stars, only because it was a beautiful pie to LOOK at. Everything came together as it should and the cooking directions couldn't have been more accurate. Unfortunately, this pie is only worth the picture one could take of it.   Weird texture, hard to describe, but somewhere between pudding and  brownies and failing at both.  While it looked like it would be chocolatey, it was not--in fact there was very little flavor at all, just simply like eating sugary mush. A major disappointment, as it looked so good we really were looking forward to our chocolate pie for dessert.

In response to the posting before mine. You do use granulated sugar. Do not use confectionary/powdered sugar or it will be a mess. I think the mistake that user made was she didn’t cook the mixture enough or stir it enough while it heated. I used granulated sugar and I heated my mixture before adding the egg. It was very smooth. I did make the mistake of not letting my chocolate mixture cool enough before adding the eggs though. So make sure your mixture is cool enough to add the egg. I went ahead and baked my pies though. With the strands of cooked egg throughout my chocolate mixture, but it still came out perfect! It was not runny and very smooth, and no one noticed any egg. I couldn’t even find it myself. This is a very good chocolate pie. I will make it again =)

I noticed a lot of readers were making a mistake with the recipe and they seem to be the ones giving this recipe a lower rating.  If you read the instructions you see that you are NOT supposed to heat the mixture until after everything is all mixed together.  Some were talking about hardened pieces of egg, etc.  Do not add the eggs after heating.  Mix it all before and heat it all at the same time.  Then you will have this turn out as it should.

Perfect recipe that cannot fail if it is followed exactly as written.  To avoid spilling the pie filling while carrying the filled pie plate to the overn, you can fill the pie plate after setting it in position on the oven rack.  Also, watch the meringue careful as when it starts to turn golden it happens quickly.  Mine baked perfectly and set at 40 minutes.  Try this recipe.  You can't go wrong!

My family members are chocoholics - so I've made countless chocolate baked goods over the years.  I found the chocolate filling bland and uneventful. I was looking for a rich, creamy chocolate filling.  This missed the mark.

I think our oven is a bit off because it took about twice as long as it should have for this pie to bake. When it finally came out of the oven and the meringue was done, it was delicious and recieved rave reviews. It's very rich and sweet; don't attempt unless you have 2-3 hours to kill, though!

I love this pie and so does my family. It is a Thanksgiving staple going on 4 years now. It is true - its not a brownie pie - its not a pudding pie; it is almost like chess, but different. Changes/Tips: 1. make sure you use granulated sugar not powdered 2. cut back the sugar to 1.5 cups 3. I have never done the heating part of it - I just throw it all in a blender and push blend - works perfectly each and every time 4. I have not tried the egg mixture for the topping - I prefer cool whip, but that is personal taste.  I might try it this year. The cool whip is a little messier though 5. This is very rich - have coffee or milk on hand and ENJOY

My father in law who has terminal Liver Cancer had mentioned he would love to have some Chocolate pie like his mother used to make. I'm far from the Make a wish foundation in my venture but was determined to try to fulfill his wish for Fathers day.   I sifted all my flour and Hershey’s Cocoa ingredients. I placed them in a mixing bowl. I used granulated sugar. Yes, Just basic old fashioned sugar.  I then mixed the wet ingredients, butter, milk and eggs together with a whisk and slowly added it to the dry on a med speed until it was all mixed. I then added it to a sauce pan on a low med heat attentive to stir until the little pea size pieces of butter were melted. I then placed my pie crust on a perforated pizza pan in the preheated oven and poured the mix into the shell & baked for 45 min & added meringue & browned the top. I let it cool for an hour and then in the refrigerator it went for a suggested 24 hours. Do plan ahead and let it cool a long time. This pie was exactly what I thought it should be & was NOT in any way like a brownie, nor mushy pudding.  It was chocolate pie! It was very moist, but held its shape when cut. It did not run at all.  It was smooth on the tongue and no grit. It was just chocolaty and sweet enough for everyone at my table and my eighty five year old father in law said “oh man this is like my mom used to make!”  I was so very happy that I didn’t pay attention to the negative banter and trusted the recipe exactly as it was.  I will bake again!

This is my daughter's favorite pie. I love the fact I don't have to stand at the stove stirring and stirring forever. It has the best taste as well. Thanks for sending it in.

For me, this was way too sweet even when I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. The sweetness was so overpowering, that the chocolate flavor simply disappear. I wouldn't try this recipe again.

This was too sweet for me. That could be my fault, though. I might try with a different cocoa powder next time. But, I could never get the middle to stop wiggling. I cooked and cooked and cooked....probably an extra 50 minutes. Also, ANY recipe calling for a Meringue topping should include an ALL CAPS WARNING which states:  BE SURE NOT TO GET EVEN THE SLIGHTEST AMOUNT OF YOLK IN YOUR EGG WHITES.....the fat will cause you to have to beat your egg whites OVERNIGHT....and they STILL won't stiffin!!! (My attempt at humor here!)  But seriously, I wish I would've known this little tidbit first. Would've saved my right arm from vibrating for 2 hours following this pie-making experience.

I consider myself an experienced cook and an awesome follower of directions, so I don't think that the results of this recipe were any fault of my own. I followed the directions exactly and didn't have any problems with the eggs cooking while whisking or anything else--I cooked it over med-low heat the whole time and it looked great. Fast forward a few hours after baking when my husband and I cut into this for Christmas dinner. It is almost like a cross between a brownie pie and a pudding pie without being great at either.

Overall i was hoping for a better pie.  I did everything I was supposed to do and it came out runny.  My family did not enjoy it
this pie because it was too sweet.  One good thing that I have to say about this pie is that it looked great.

You know how some pies "run" when you cut into them?  NOT this one!  This was picture perfect!  It really was one of the prettiest pies I ever made.  It was good and fudgy too!  I was very impressed.  I will for sure make this one again!

This was well-received at my father's birthday party. I made two of them, one right after the other (not both at once as doubling the filling on pies sometimes gives weird results). The pictures are misleading here. The first 3-4 pictures show a chocolate cream pie, like from a Betty Crocker cookbook. The remaining pies show a standard chess pie. I was hoping for the former, but my result was the latter. However, we like chess pie, so that was mostly ok. I thought the filling too sweet; my sister thought it was too bitter (too rich, maybe); another person thought it was too chocolatey; I thought it wasn't chocolatey enough. Just mixed reviews all the way around, and I think it's because people have different expectations. The review from naples34102 is spot on. The texture is NOT like what is pictured above, and is in fact more of a chess pie--like a brownie and a pudding mixed together, not like custard pie. (Lemon meringue is the best example--chocolate cream pie and lemon meringue pie have the exact same texture. This pie does NOT have that specific texture.) Again, there's nothing wrong with this pie, it tastes pretty good. It just isn't what I thought I was making! Thanks for the recipe Bev, my dad, the birthday boy, enjoyed this chocolate pie :)

I made the pie and found it to be too sweet,
too sweet for the meringue, and more like a
brownie taste.  Several members of my family
tried it and did not like it.  I will not make
again. Sorry.

I read the reviews before baking and decided to decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup in the pie and 1/2 cup in the meringue.  It was wonderful.  I have already been told I will have to make it again.  I was surprised at how easy it was to make.  I was a bit worried because when I poured it in the shell it was so runny.  I couldn't believe how thick it turned out.  Best Chocolate pie I have ever made.  Thanks for the recipe!!

The top meringue is not enough to cover the pie and to thin once baked.  The sweet factor is a bit extreme

I followed the recipe down to the letter, and it was WAAAY to sweet! I was looking for something with a similar consistency but not as overpoweringly sweet. Also, when I refrigerated it, it got to about the consistency of concrete-you'll want to let it sit out a little bit before cutting and consuming.

This chocolate pie is a definite five-star. 
The meringue didn't quite turn out nice, and instead it turned out to be some spongey
substance, which was tasteless and odourless. I might substitute the meringue with whipped cream,clotted cream or custard for my next try. This is was fantastic, it was a hit.

I followed one reviewers suggestion and reduced the sugar teo 1.5 cups.  It was still way to sweet for us (and we like sweet). What I will say that I will definately make this again with less sugar (1 cup).  It did not get runny, it was a perfect consistancy and a good chocolate flavor.  I have never made a meringue pie before. My mother in law brings one every Thanksgiving and bless her heart it is always runny. So when mine came out so good I was really surprised.  I owe it to the recipe.   One trick I read about is make sure you put the meringue on the hot pie (this helps cook the bottom of the meringue even before it hits the oven) and seal the pie edges with the meringue (the meringue needs to touch the edges of the crust) or it will weep (little beads of syrup come through the meringue when it is done baking and cooling due to moisture getting in from the exposed pudding).  Thanks for posting!!! I just may make the chocolate pie next Thanksgiving~!

Made it tonight and it turned out perfect BUT tastes like BROWNIE MIX. You should eat it with ice cream instead of meringue. I used granulated sugar and the whole 12oz. can evaporated milk.

I only gave this four stars because the texture is a little odd.  However, it's delicious.  I'm lactose intolerant, so I tried substituting unsweetened almond milk, original, and adding one tbsp cornstarch.  Set up beautifully!  A dense fudgy chocolate pie, rich and sweet.

This was kind of a disaster. The meringue did not work out at all...it seemed perfectly browned on the outside but it soon started to weep after I took it out, then promptly deflated.  But even after taking off the meringue, the chocolate pie itself wasn't good either...it was like pudding in a pie shell, and not at all worth the effort.  I will never make this again.

This pie came out great even though I didn't follow the directions very well. I mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and not on the stove so they didn't get any heat.  Then I put the mixture in the refrigerator for a couple of hours because I didn't have time to finish the pie.  Later, I baked it for more than an hour and it was still bubbling.  Since I had to leave the house before it was done, I turned off the stove and left the pie in the oven hoping that it would thicken, because otherwise my husband's birthday pie would be a flop.  About 1 1/2 hours later, I took the pie out of oven and had it for dessert.  It was great.  Somehow, the bottom of the pie carmelize adding a lovely texture and flavor to the pie and the crust wasn't even burnt.  I will try making this pie two more times - once to make it the right way and a second time to try to duplicate my first attempt.

I made this pie last night and my family totally loved it!The only thing different that I will do next time is use a shallower pie crust. After reading some of the other reviews, I doubled the ingredients for a deep dish pie crust and meringue.However, this pie is so decadently rich and delicious, that all but the most die-hard chocoholics will be satisfied with a very small slice.I think small slices will be easier to serve with a shallower pie.I also add a handfull of chocolate chips to the pie before baking and I mixed the chocolate filling in the cuisinart using Wondra flour.Thank you for this recipe!

Chocolate pie is usually not my first choice but the chocolate pie is the best, I make it every holiday. The first time I made it it was gone within an hour and I had to make two more, my family loved it that much! It is the perfect consistency of chocolate and meringue, and the chocolate is amazing, it is rich though.

My son asked Me to bring two Chocolate Pies over for Thanksgiving. I picked this recipe. I followed the directions exactly as written. His Mother (the EX) and everyone else raved about how good these pies were. The Ex actually thought I bought the pies from a bakery. Thank You, and yes I will make again. For those who heat the filling before adding the egg. You can take 1/4 cup or so of the hot filling and slowly mix into the eggs. Then pour the egg mixture into the hot filling. This will prevent the egg pieces from floating in the filling. However it is easier just to follow the recipe, and add the eggs to the filling before heating.

I am baking this pie at the moment. It says to bake for 35-40 minutes or until it doesn't "wobble". Well after 65 minutes it is still wobbling and still in the oven. Thinking this is a joke and is going to taste a little like burnt choc. Frustrating!!!!!!

I thought this pie was great. I have no idea why all the negative reviews. Do not bake this pie longer as directed. It may wiggle while still hot in the oven, but once it cools a bit, it's fine. Next time I make this pie, I plan to cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups. It was a bit sweet for my taste.

OMG, is this a rich chocolate treat! Be sure to cook the pie mixture (on medium heat) long enough to melt the butter otherwise the sugar won't be dissolved. My meringue wasn't very pretty as this was the first time I've ever made it, but that's on me. I wasn't sure how long it would take the meringue to turn golden brown - I think it took about 25 minutes. I will definitely be making this pie again!!!!!

This recipe was just a disaster. The consistency of the pie itself was not good. The taste wasn't good. The topping didn't even begin to turn out. After researching, I read that you need 1/4 sugar per egg white. This recipe called for 4 egg whites with 1/4 of sugar. There were no soft peaks, and there definitely were not any hard peaks. It was just a mess. Even if I would have left the topping off, it still wouldn't have been good.

I was actually disappointed in this pie. For starters, it was too sweet (and I like sweet), and the consistency was not right. I love to bake chocolate desserts, but this is one dessert that won't be finished, and not made again.

Very disappointing after seeing some of the positive reviews!  This pie is just too sweet, and too thick, for our tastes.  I regret not taking the advice of others and using milk instead of evaported milk....that might have reduced the sweetness and enhanced the texture.  Not likely to try this again!

This recipe is way too sweet and dense.  I even added 4 ounces of cream cheese to cut down on the sweetness, but with not much luck.  1 1/2 cups of sugar or even less should be plenty of sugar.  I think I also would have preferred it with whole milk instead of evaporated milk, and half as much butter.  If you are trying to watch what you eat, watch out for this one!

A little too much of a dark chocolate taste for me but it was still easy to make and the texture was good. I'll ease up on the cocoa powder next time for my own preferences.  I didn't start to heat it up until everything was in it but the butter, so it took about 50 minutes to firm up in my oven. When I saw it was going to take a while to firm I wrapped the crust in aluminum foil to it wouldnt burn. I chilled it overnight and it it was very firm.  Easing up on the cocoa powder is my only change if you aren't a fan of dark chocolate. The process works great.

This pie is so easy to make, and tastes great.  It bakes in about an hour total, and my family and I ate it about 2 hours later.  Tastes best chilled.

Wanted to make a chocolate pie for an upcoming potluck. I always test new things on my family and close friends first. This was aweful. Out of 7 people who tried it, no one like it. Tasted like cocoa powder and not the yummy creamy chocolate like I am used to in a good chocolate pie. Ended up finding a recipe that called for bakers chocolate and that was a hit.

I tried this pie with very high hopes. I have baked my whole life, and I have never been able to make my grandmas chocolate pie. I tried this recipe and it is not to my liking. Texture is off, more like a under baked brownie then a pie. I would have been better off making it with cook and serve pudding then this. Luckily I had all the ingredients on hand and I didnt have to make a store run for it. I would not recommend and now i have to search for another recipe

Rich, decadent, delicious. Will make again!! Was excellent with an easy flaky crust recipe found on the site. Substituted the evaporated milk with half&half. Added cream of tartar to my meringue. And most excitingly used my own homemade vanilla extract and fresh farm eggs. Thanks!

Not great - Not bad either. Just not worth the calories. My husband thought the same thing. It's a weird consistency - sort of like slimy brownies or lumpy pudding - anyway I won't be making this again. It is better after it has been refrigerated (improves the consistency a bit) - and instead of the meringue - add some ice cream on top. It makes it a lot tastier.

Easy as pie to make! (Sorry, I had to do it.)  I would consider myself a novice and this pie came out beautifully.  Beware. It is very, very sweet. Someone suggested using less sugar and I think I will do that next time (1.5 cups instead of 2 cups). I also used 5 heaping TBS of cocoa because several had complained of it not being chocolate-ly enough.  Will definitely make this again.

This is the best chocolate pie I have ever ate! I made it for a friend's birthday and she loved it. It was also a huge hit at Thanksgiving. It did take about 45 minutes for it to not to wobble. I hate meringue so I topped it with cool whip!

I thought this pie was delicious and so did my family.  The filling is much like a Chocolate Chess Pie recipe that I have, but adding the meringue on top, took it up another notch.  Also, I have so much trouble making cream pies because the pie crust shrinks up on me when baked first.  Baking the filling in the unbaked pie crust worked perfectly.  I did not use the meringue recipe attached to this recipe, but substituted it with the Meringue II recipe from this site, which is an excellent recipe too.

I skipped the mirangue part.  The flavor of the chocolate part was great, but the texture was odd. The edges were like brownies, while the center was like pudding..even after baking it for the full length of time.  I could not figure out which texture was the "right" one.  After being in the fridge, the pudding-like center set very well and was great.

This is a relatively quick and easy recipe for a nice pie that looks great.I gave it 4 stars because I think it an be improved. I prefer a richer darker chocolate that's less sweet.

This pie was good but very, very sweet. Tasted like fudge. I added all but the yolks and butter to the sauce pan at once.  I then mixed in the yolks and then the butter and turned on the stove and cooked it on medium-low until the butter melted. After 40 minutes of cooking it still jiggled so I cooked it another 10 minutes.  It came out perfect. Very creamy like pudding. Not at all grainy like other pies that I have had. I plan to make this again but I'll definitely cut back on the sugar.

This pie was delicious! When I first cooked it, I tasted it warm and did not care for it but never having tasted chocolate pie before, that might be the right taste. I made the mistake of sitting it out to cool and when I tried it later I was still unimpressed. However, I found the problem the next day after sticking it in the fridge overnight. It was so delicious after refrigeration. The filling was just creamy and sweet and yummy! One very picky family member said it was extremely good, so that came as a big compliment. It was devoured pretty quickly, now I'm craving it again!

One recipe fills a deep dish pie crust.  Baked this one again this year, 2010, and again it was wonderful.  I let it cook a little past the recommended point and it was perfect.  
This is THE Pie!  I am not a big Chocolate pie fan and my mother-in-law Always makes Chocolate pies for the holidays and Everybody in the family just raves over her pies.  I like her pies OK.  However, I got voted to make the Chocolate pies this year.  After doing a lot of recipe research, I ended up trying this recipe and the one titled Chocolate Pie I.  Well, this one is by far my favorite.  The other one, "Chocolate Pie I" is more like the one my mother-in-law makes - more like a pudding-type filling.  But this recipe is just like a beautiful pie you would see in a bakery window.  The flavor is great and the texture is great.  Hope you try it.

My neighbors son-in-law just got back from Iraq on Friday. We had a big BBQ for him yesterday and I made this pie to take over there.  Everyone loved the pie and people were asking for the recipe. I did not put the meringue on I just put some cool whip on. Thanks for the recipe!!

It's the prettiest pie i've made so far, but it didn't taste well. 2 stars for looks, 1 star cause one of the things that went bad was my pastry being too fat. But i doubt that would account for all the taste. I might try again some day with other pastry, but i don't think so tho...

The first time I made this a couple of years ago, I used 2% milk because I was out of canned. It was good but a little runny, so I just redid this following directions. Very fudgelike, very rich, not pudding like at all. My husband liked this pie, but we prefer a more pudding type filling inside and this was too dense and fudgy for what we were expecting. Don't make substitutions on this one, it's great as written but just did not make our favorites. Thanks!

I really liked this pie! I've been looking for a chocolate meringue pie for a long time and this one is good! I didn't have evaporated milk so I used 1 1/2 cups regular milk and I did not find that it mattered. I would recommend putting the pie in the refrigerator to chill because my husband and I were overly anxious to try it and ate it when it was still a little warm and it just didn't taste as well as the next morning when it had chilled (I made it at night so you don't have to wait all night for yours, just a few hours...). Anyways, I will make this again!

This pie was excellent.  I had 2 graham cracker crusts that I needed to use.  This recipe made two pies with the smaller crusts.  They were a hit!!

Great pie - we sliced it when it was still hot, and it did not run at all.  I baked it 40 min before adding the meringue, then about 15 min after that to turn the meringue golden brown

This pie was good but the chocolate was not creamy and a little too rich.  I'll keep looking for the perfect chocolate pie recipe.

Great pie!  The meringue didn't turn out well, but I think that's because I'm a spaz in the kitchen.  The pie is delicious without the meringue too!

This was fantastic! I made it for someone very special in my life and I tried a tiny piece this morning and it was wonderful. I did cook it longer also...about 50 minutes and it came out perfect and I had no problem with the merigune...you just have to know the technique for making it otherwise...it will not turn out. This pie was definitely perfection! Thank you  :)

I am a relative pie novice...I have never made a decent crust, and haven't had much luck with meringue, either.  So, it was with trepidation that I attempted this recipe, and only because my husband's grandmother used to make chocolate meringue pie for his birthday and he wanted it.  I am happy to report that it turned out GREAT!!  The crust was flaky, the chocolate was delicious (and not runny), and the meringue was gorgeous.  I did use half the sugar the recipe calls for, and I used the Betty Crocker meringue recipe instead (3 egg whites at room temp, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp cream of tartar, and 6 tbsp sugar).  I also brushed the pie crust with egg white before I filled it.  I used the Best Pie Crust Ever recipe from this site.  My husband said it was one of the best pies he's ever tasted!!  Thanks, Diana!

we didn't care for the meringue part, although I had to put candied cherries on top for my kid especially requested it and the result was pretty enough, but the filling is heavenly, it does not turn out runny at all and you can't leave it alone...

Fantastic!!  The recipe as given makes more than will fit in a pie crust, so if you double the recipe given you can make three pies.  Sprinkle some nutmeg on top of the whipped cream when you serve it and it makes even better.  Have made this several times and will make it again!

This pie tasted very good, although I did have a problem like another reviewer with getting one to set properly.  I made two of them (at the same time) and one turned out beautifully and the other was just a plate of fudgy soup-still tasted good but not real impressive to look at, let alone serve! The one that did turn out well tasted and looked delicious though, so I will keep this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought it was good. My mother and grandmother thought it was too sweet, but that is easily remedied. I'm not a big canned milk fan, so next time I think I would use cream and less sugar

This is the best chocolate pie I have ever made.  It is the only one I've ever made that isn't runny!  I did add a few semi-chocolate chips to it.  However, it is very rich (not too swwet, but rich) so could only eat a little piece at one sitting.  I decreased sugar to 1 3/4 cups, which was plenty for us.

This was very good.  Mine wasn't runny at all.  My husband has never had this type of pie before (I guess they don't make it in England) and he ate half of it in one night.  Will make again.

Chocolate pie has always been the hardest item for me to make.  I am a baker, have been for a very long time, I found this and I do have to say it is one of the best ones I have tried.  Quick, simple and delecious.

Yummy!  This recipe was so good and such a pretty pie.  It was a little too rich for us, so next time I think I will cut back the sugar like the other girls.  Thanks for a great recipe.

It came out runny.  I did everything it said do.  I bake all the time and didn't do anything but what it said do.  Plus, the top burnt and was only in for 35 minutes.

I put all the ingredients in a blender, processed it for maybe a minute and poured it in a pie shell!!! It came out wonderful and so creamy. It was a big hit with my family and friends. So much so that I was asked to bake more for a church bake sale.

This pie did not go over well with any of my family.  It was too sweet and brownie like.  I was also unsure how long to bake it.  The recipe did not state this except to say "when it no longer wobbles".  I found it frustrating to have to keep checking and not having some idea of how long it might take. It would be nice to have a range of time so you can then begin checking it at the minimum time. I guess this just wasn't what I was expecting it to be.

I thought this pie was wonderful! The recipe made two regular sized pies and I used Cool Whip on top of one and meringue on top of the other and the Cool Whip topped one was a hit!  I will definite use this as my new chocolate pie recipe.

Anyone that could eat this pie as written, has one heck of a sweet tooth. Two cups of sugar for 11/2 cups of milk! I wouldn't put that much sugar in 3 cups of milk! All you need for this recipe is 3/4 cup.

This was a great pie, and my first meringue too.
I have a stick blender with only one speed, which is kind of high. I found that it did a great job beating the meringue until it was thick and fluffy. I shared this pie with some friends, and we all liked it. Maybe not a 5-star recipe, but definitely at least 4!

Very good recipe, I added a whipped cream topping instead of the mirrangue because I needed the oven for anther dish. The pie was so simple, but soooo good. I made two, one for Christmas Eve and one for Christmas day. This pie wasa big hit at both parties! Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

My family loves this pie. It is as close as we've found to a chocolate pie we used to eat at Ollie's BBQ in Birmingham, AL. I had searched for a recipe for something similar since it closed years ago. So happy to have found this. Thanks!

Yes, it is quite sweet, more than it needs to be. When I make it again I'll reduce the sugar to about one cup. However, the texture when complete is terrific, very creamy. I put all the dry ingredients, yolks, and evaporated milk in the pan.

I cooked this today and just ate my first piece, I absolutely loved it. Tasted like fudge. No pudding texture which I hate in a chocolate pie.. this is a keeper for me.

This pie is easy and tastes like a homemade pie should. I agree with other reviews do not HEAT until all ingredients are added. Not runny or no egg "pieces".. Good while still warm or room temp.

Filling tasted nothing like chocolate, just an overly sweet thick mass. Had to bake it for almost an hour. Not making this again.

I made this pie yesterday (exactly like the recipe stated) and it was great.  Very sweet, but that didn't keep it from disappearing.  To top the pie, I used the "Never Fail Merengue" recipe from this site (which is also awesome) and it looked like it could have been photographed for a magazine cover!  If you rated this pie poorly, then you did something other than follow the directions because it was perfect just the way its written.  If I were to change anything, it would be a little less sugar - nothing else!!  Ummm ummmm good ........

My husband's favorite pie is chocolate!  I had promised to make him one, but could not locate my mother's recipe.  I found this one and decided to give it a try, since it seemed pretty close to the way my mom made chocolate pie.  The pie is really good!  My husband ate two pieces at one sitting!  The recipe is simple to follow and turns out well!

This recipe is delicious. The only thing I did differently was to add an extra teaspoon of vanilla. I put all the dry ingredients in a pot on the stove and mixed well. Then I added the milk, vanilla, and beaten eggs. I then added the butter and turned the heat to medium. After the butter was completely melted, I poured the mixture into the pie shell and baked for 40 minutes. I then added the merengue and baked for 10 more minutes. This was a fantastic pie and my family loved it!!

I just made this and it's so delicious and wonderful! It's really easy too. I made my own meringue the way I usually do(with cream of tarter & vanilla) and it came together perfect.I will be taking this one to Thanksgiving dinner this year!

I thought this was great, very simple and it turned out well for me. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate, but even with adding an extra tbsp of cocoa (after consulting with my 5y.o. niece) it wasn't too strong or too sweet.
 I didn't feel like making a pie crust so I used a simple shortbread crust and it complimented it nicely. Not having to roll out dough is always a plus :) Otherwise I followed the directions exactly, and the texture was awesome, very smooth and creamy, but not a pudding. 
Due to my own inexperience I had some problems with the meringue, but I've done my research and I know what I did wrong, and I'll definitely be making this again!

Wow! I made this pie for hubby's birthday and I was a bit nervous because he does NOT have a big sweet tooth; he's the type to eat a bite of a candy bar and be totally content. However, when he tried it, he LOVED IT and so did I! I read many of the reviews before hand and because of hubby's sweet tooth (or lack there of) I decided to go with only 1.5 C sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla. It turned out great. I'm making another one tonight! Oh! And we topped it with whipped cream [:

The flavor is very good but the cooking temp or time must be off. I cooked for 50 mins and it came out runny even after cooling in the fridge :( Still going to eat it, but has more of a pudding consistency.

OK I have never written a review about anything before-but just had to! I {made this last night for my husband-{his aunt usually makes him chocolate pies}- he woke me up at midnight and told me its the best chocolate pie he has EVER had! Wow!  Now that's a compliment! I have never eaten chocolate pie or meringue(sheltered I know!!) but tasted it this morning and it was pretty darn good! I followed the directions exactly-the only difference was my cooking time seem to go almost an hour-not sure why-could be altitude or who knows... but it turned out perfect!  I did add a few pinches of "creme of tartar" to the meringue and it really fluffed it up! MAKE THIS PIE!! You will LOVE IT!

Loved the recipe so did everyone that had some. It came out so pretty, yes its a very rich chocolate but if cooked just right its perfect. I also use grandulated sugar and put 1tsp of vanilla extract in the topping (it was by accident, i was not paying attention to the bowl i was using lol but it turned out great). Just used a store bought pie crust. I would like to try it with a pastry crust though. May not have as crunchy of a crust. Will make it again though. My hubby loved it.

Hey, the recipe doesn't say anything about "cooling" the mixture before adding eggs, although past years pies I made did require that.  I rated it just so I could comment to forewarn others, but it's in the oven right now and I'm hoping all goes well.  I hope if the cooling was necessary, that the recipe is corrected.  Also, it says to only heat until butter melts, but others said to heat before doing so.  What's what?

This is a wonderful recipe.  To make this fit my taste I decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup and reduce the cocoa by one tbsp.

I made this for my Mom, who loves chocolate pie and she really liked it.  I know if it's good if my husband goes back for seconds and he did. It'll be a staple at family get-togethers now. It was easy to make, did take longer to cook than the directions.  I expected the meringue to be difficult but it was easy!

This was really good.  We didn't really care for the meringue but I think we are just not meringue people. Will make again but will try a different topping...whipped cream or marshmallow topping

I can't understand the bad reviews for this pie. As far as old fashion chocolate pies go, this is probably the riches and ceramist I've ever tasted.  It WILL, look like a brownie on top when you bake it, (which is covered by the meringue), but the filling is this wonderful homemade pudding. 

My only complaint,  as in most chocolate pie,  is that they tend to be too sweet. They all call for 2 cups of sugar, (breaks down to 1/4 per regular serving, plus the sugar in the meringue). 

I recommend reducing to 1 1/2 cups,  and adding 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a dash of nutmeg.

I had no end to trouble with this recipe!! I baked it over an hour and not only did it not get solid, it overflowed all over my oven!! I'm not a beginning baker by any stretch. I have no idea what happened. Followed the recipe to a "t".

This is my husbands favorite pie, I use a store bought graham cracker crust that I baste with egg white and bake for about 8minutes before putting the filling in.  Yummy!!!!

My family loved this pie. It is not like a cream pie if that is what others who are scoring it low are looking for. This pie is thick and very rich and very chocolatey with lots of meringe. This pie is what I remember from my southern chilhood.

Delicious!!!!  I was a little nervous about the reviews saying it didn't have much flavor just super sweet, so I added a little more cocoa and vanilla.  I also used slightly less than the full 12 oz. of evap milk.  It turned out perfectly!!!

This is one of the best and easiest chocolate pies I have ever eaten.  We make it with the No Roll Pie Crust II from this site.  My 11 year old daughter loves to make this, because it is so simple and everyone loves it.  The only change we make is we use 2 - 5 oz cans of evaporated milk instead of the 12 oz can.  It always turns out perfectly and there is never any left to take home.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  It's the only chocolate pie we make anymore.

This pie is simply wonderful. It was easy to make and turned out just like a good chocolate pie is supposed to.  If you like those quick chocolate pudding style "chocolate pies" then this one isn't for you.  This is the real deal.  Great pie.

I thought this pie was excellent! The consistency was soft and fudgey, like a good chocolate pie should be!  Reminds me of the one my granny used to make.  I had to bake quite a bit longer than 40 minutes, but it was worth the wait - and even better the second day!

Very good pie. Extremly sweet though. You gotta love chocolate to eat this and still in moderation. It took twice as long to cook as the directions stated but perhaps because I used 2% milk instead of condinsed.

Yum! This pie is delicious. I couldn't wait for it to cool to try it! I had to strain the chocolate mixture before pouring it into the pie shell because I had a lot of cocoa lumps. Other than that, everything went smoothly by following the recipe directions exactly. I baked the meringue for 15 minutes at 350 degrees but from looking at this video (http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/How-to-Make-Lemon-Meringue-Pie-Video/Detail.aspx) and reading an article on meringues on this site, it looks like it might be better to bake it for a shorter amount of time at a higher temperature. Very easy and delicious! Enjoy!

I can't thank you enough for sharing this wonderful recipe.  This is the DEFINITIVE chocolate pie in all respects.  I've tried dozens of recipes, and nothing has even come close to this.  I have pie lovers in my family, and they went wild for this.  Great stuff.

I made this pie for Easter and it was a huge hit! My family loved it and I can honestly say that there was no left overs. I didn't have a problem like some of the others with left over filling. I used a 9 inch deep dish pie. Homemade crust is the best. The texture is different than what you are use to with chocolate pie. It is not like a pudding. It reminds me kind of like the inside of a truffle. Very smooth and creamy.

It was good and everyone seemed to like it, but it wasn't what I think of when I think of a creamy, chocolate pie.  It tasted exactly like cocoa that has been sweetened.  I guess I was thinking more of a pudding pie?  I will keep searching.

This pie came out extremely tasty!
It was a big hit with my family members. I made this recipe with a pie crust made from scratch, using a the " Best Pie Crust Ever" recipe from this website. I would recommend definitely adding more salt in the pie crust, because the chocolate is extremely rich and sweet! Also a little less sugar in the chocolate if you're on a sugar diet. I didn't make the meringue, because it just seemed too much for a time-span of 2 hours. Also, I used cake flour for the chocolate filling and it turned out smooth and pleasant.
To add a little bit more zing, I recommend adding a buttercream frosting on top of the cake.

I had put the ingredients into a blender. I cut back the sugar , used cool whip and increased cooking time about 15 minutes. I had varied comments about this pie from work -  was too sweet , wasnt sweet enough, loved it, too rich ... It depends on your taste. My kids loved it and I think its great.

I love this pie because it looks gorgeous and tastes absolutely decadent.  I've made it at least five times, and it set every time but once.  The key is the meringue topping.  I put it in the oven for three minutes, turn it, and check it once every minute after that until it's perfectly golden.  It gets positively rave reviews, and it has a distinct advantage over other made-from-scratch pies in that you don't have to make a lattice top.

If this recipe doesn't work out for you, it is because you didn't follow the directions.  It was wonderful!  I have made it four times now and presented it at my Board of Trustees meeting for their dessert.  I got rave reviews and it will be my number one Chocolate Pie now.  The only variation in this recipe, is I had to let it bake for 45 minutes instead of 40 minutes.

You would not believe what a disaster trying to make this recipe was!

I grab all my ingredients from the supermarket on my way home, but I forget to get the evaporated milk - had to drive all the way back. Get home, go to print the recipe out, my printer is out of black ink!! So I write it out by hand only to discover that Im almost out of cocoa powder. BAH HUM BUG! Im not diving all the way back to the supermarket again, so I decide just to use a mixture of Milo, chocolate chips and the little cocoa powder I had... Is someone up there trying to tell me something?

Thank you SO much for this recipe!!! I've been searching for a chocolate pie like this for so long- one that doesn't require endless stirring & cooking to thicken up & one that doesn't run or spread when you cut it. My family doesn't like meringue, so we just use whipped topping. YUM!!! It's incredible how perfect it comes out in spite of it being so runny when you pour it in.

My family loved it--although I'll cut down on the sugar a bit next time because it was a bit too rich for me.  But if you like chocolate and want a pie that looks good even after it is cut---try this pie.  Thanks for posting it!

This was very easy to make. I used the refigerated
pie dough,whip cream for the topping and shaved chocolate curls over the top. It was very good and rich. Everyone one at the party loved it.
I did have to dump the mixture out of the saucepan and wisk it to get the flour lumps out.
Would recommend to anyone who loves chocolate!

This is a very good pie.  It is very rich and
well deserving of 5 stars.  It cut
very well and is not running.
However, only one thing that I would think
about changing is using less sugar in
the meringue.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a sugary disgusting mush. All I could taste was a weird sweet then a weird chocolate after taste. Only good thing was the picture I was able to take. I'll never make this one again.

I would not call this a chocolate pie, but I'm no expert.  To me it taste good but like a brownie in pie crust.  It definitely got eaten.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe! I made a few changes - had no evaporated milk so substituted 8oz whole milk and 4 oz half and half. Added a dash of salt to dry ingredients, lowered sugar to 1.5 c, mixed beaten yolks with milks for easier adding. Stirred continuously during the heating process, and waited to add the butter till the mixture had heated up just a bit so stirring in would be easier. I’d also recommend adding the butter in pieces.  Added vanilla to chocolate after removing from heat. Pie set right at 45 minutes, as recipe states. For the meringue, added dash of salt at beginning of mixing, added sugar by the tablespoon slowly during process, also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Add the meringue onto the hot pie immediately after pulling from the oven or you risk the meringue weeping. When removing from oven after meringue has set, leave out about an hour before placing in the fridge to cool completely.
 The end result was beautiful and delicious! I’ve seen some reviews stating the pie had no flavor.  The added salt and vanilla helped, but the pie is VERY chocolatey so I’m unsure why anyone would say tasteless. As far as any issue with texture, mine came out very smooth. I would think any grainy or chunky issues would be from the heating process and suggest, as other reviewers have, that you mix all ingredients together before the slow heating process and stir continuously while heating. This will ensure a very smooth consistency. The pie is richer than a normal pudding

It took me a few days to get up the courage to make this for a couple of reasons. After reading the reviews about the eggs, I was scared mine would end up scrambled plus I have never made meringue. I finally made it last night and boy was it a hit! I followed the recipe exactly except I did take a tip from one review and added a little bit of vanilla when I was making the meringue. I also cut my butter into pats because I thought it would melt faster and give the eggs less time to scramble.It looked beautiful and tasted great. I'm already thinking about Christmas functions I can make it for.

I almost disqualify myself from rating this one. I made 3 mistakes. I used 5 egg yokes instead of 4 on accident. Then I messed up the timer on my clock and did not get it set right. So I just eyeballed this to when it no longer jiggled.

Next I messed up on the meringue, so I left that off. I am very happy I left this off because it would have covered up a great crust. The top of the pie had a very nice crispy crust on it which was Awesome.

Sometimes accidents are the best!

I also used a little extra cocoa by about 2 table spoons. When the pie came out, it was very very good. A little over cooked, but still very moist and chocolatleee.

I will for sure make this pie again. Next time, I will keep the extra egg yoke and cook it a little less time.

I made this pie today for Father’s Day lunch. While I had never made a chocolate pie like this before with cooking the filling in the oven rather than on the stovetop , it was very good and actually easier.   The consistency was a little fudgier  but I will definitely make this again.  For the reviewers who said it had no flavor add a pinch of salt I always use a pinch in desserts.  I’m going to have some right now.

Very good! This was enough filling for two pie crusts. It was exactly as my grandma made it. This is a typical southern chocolate pie! 
I added a little vanilla to the meringue and it was a hit!

This pie was amazing. I used dark unsweetened Herseys cocoa instead of the traditional cocoa and friends raved on it. The dark chocolate set it over the top.

Yeah that was pretty bad. I make a lot of pies & am a huge chocoholic .... this pie was pretty rough. The chocolate was so rich it over powered everything. I was sick by the third bit. Do your self a favor and find a recipe that mixes cream into the chocolate so it’s not so intense.

This pie is delicious. I would recommend serving it with a nice berry sauce, made slightly tart with lemon juice. When chilled, the pie becomes so incredibly deliciously chewy. Serve the pie with berry sauce a la mode or a la NOT mode. Either way is delicious. The only problem I had is that the filling took about 50 minutes to firm up. I was using a different oven than our own, so if need be I will change my rating accordingly.

It was really good texture-wise but a little too sweet for me.  I may give it another try but will try to adjust the sugar.  I think it might be better with whipped topping instead of meringue.

WAY TOO SWEET!!! Everything went fine with the prep, no problems with the baking, the meringue was the proper sweetness, but the filling was so sweet that it overpowered the cocoa powder.  If I make this again I will cut the sugar down to one cup--just enough to sweeten the cocoa powder.  My husband said that he, "felt hit in the head with sugar."  It only took me an hour total, but I do feel bad about wasting the ingredients on something so sweet

Amazing pie. Reminded me of my favorite pie at Dangerously Delicious Pies in DC....the Baltimore Bomb. Note both times I've made it it took at least 20-30 minutes more time to bake and "not be wobbly". I also made it without the meringue and it was superb.

Fantastic and so easy to make!! My kids always like the chocolate pie at a local bakery. When I couldn't order in time for Christmas made this one.  This pie is so much better I will never order another one again.  Used whipped cream instead of meringue.

Our grandmother died earlier this year and I needed a choc pie recipe since she was our choc pie maker.  I had read reviews and some were negative and mostly those were saying that this is more like pudding or fudge.  Here’s my opinion:the instructions didn’t mention anything about needing to let the pie cool before covering it to take somewhere. I needed to transport this pie and browned the meringue and after taking it from oven I immediately covered it and put in vehicle as I was pressed for time. I think I needed to let it cool back down before serving Bc the pie turned into liquid.  But once I got it to where we were going and it cooled back off, it stiffened back up. 
 I made this into two pie shells rather than one deep dish. I prepared exactly as recipe called for only heating to melt the butter and poured equally into two gently prebaked shells. I baked for about 30 mins and removed and let cool completely. Then made the meringue.  I used four egg white per pie.  So I used 8 whites total.  I spooned onto the pies and put back in oven on 350.   Maybe here I should’ve put on broil or maybe used a torch.  But it was after baking that the pies liquified again.  

They taste wonderful and I will keep this recipe as my go to choc pie recipe.

So this was the first time I ever made a chocolate pie. Turned out great. Reminded me of chocolate pie I had as a kid. Not a fan of pudding Chocolate Pie. However, I cooked the pie for about 55 minutes in the oven, it wasn't until then that the pie was not wobbly.  I also opted for the gram pie crush in stead of the traditional pie crust the recipe calls for. Cooking it longer made the pie crust really hard to cut, but if you make it a day ahead of time and give the pie time to rest, the crust will absorb the sugars from the filling and slice easily.

I've made this no-fail, always delicious pie many times since it originally appeared around 2001. Now, due to my granddaughter's celiac disease, I had the need to modify it in order to make it gluten free. Guess what? Even better! I used a "King Arthur Flour" gluten-free (rice flour & potato starch) pie crust from Walmart (my second use of this incredible tasty, flaky pie crust) and used CORN STARCH instead of flour in the pie filling (use a little more than half as much corn starch as flour -- a heaping 1/8 cup corn starch total). The pie was just a tad wobbly when I took it out of the oven and cooled to perfection. Another important modification that guarantees perfect results: mix your ingredients in a mixing bowl and just-melt the butter in the microwave before adding it into the mix (watch it and remove from heat before it is all melted and stir-melt the rest so that it is NOT piping hot) then slowly add it into the mix so as not to cook the egg in the mixture). THEN pour it into the crust and bake. Mine cook 45 minutes to perfection, and in an oven where "center of oven" for me (the position most recipes recommend fr everything) was a tad higher than center. I loved the rave reviews the recipe garnered - from non-celiac guests as well!

I am not going to lie. I have been making chocolate pies every Thanksgiving for almost 40 years. I was skeptical of a pie where you did not cook the pudding on the stove top. I have made this pie several times now and it always comes out creamy and perfect. My family loves it!

I made this exactly as recipe is written except for decreasing the sugar a tiny bit as other reviews suggested.  I followed the technique exactly and was looking for this to be a blue ribbon winner.  But there is something weird about this pie both in taste and texture. I won't be going back for a second slice or making it again.  It's overly sweet and not a creamy chocolate taste (looks somewhat like a brownie). Maybe  I'm just used to my Jello brand cook and serve chocolate pie which I make often and it's so much easier than this.  I was out of the mix so thought this would be a really good choice.   Very disappointed.

Turned out great. Used fresh whipped cream topping by whipping heavy cream and a little sugar instead of meringue. Topped it off with colored sprinkles.

Wow!  Great pie :) I've never had chocolate pie before (I know, shocking!) and this didn't disappoint.  It was extremely rich, and as someone who's favorite snack isn't chocolate, I was surprised at how much I liked this pie.  We paired it with vanilla ice cream and it was a great after dinner treat

This is amazing.  BUT it's not a light fluffy mousse pie.  This is thick almost like a chocolate cheese cake.  I made no changes.  Combine everything but but butter before heating.  And it did take forever to cook.  A loooong time.  I only added freshed whip cream and no meringue.

So easy and the family loves it!  I followed directions to the letter the first time.  I added 1 1/2 Tablespoons cocoa the rest of the times to rich up the chocolate flavor and cut the sugar.  This pie turns out perfect every time!

I am a HUGE chocolate pie fan, but this was my first attempt at making one. Oh Em Gee, this is an amazing pie!!!!

Took a little longer than expected to bake (almost an hour), but the texture is simply perfect, and the flavor - wow.

I’ve pick up the tradition of making chocolate pie from my husbands aunt that passed away a few years ago. The entire extended family says it tastes just like hers. It’s now one of my go-to pies for any occasion.

This pie is awesome! I've made it several times and it's fantastic. It's rich and fudgy. This is my 4th year making it for Thanksgiving, and my brother-in-law requests it for his birthday and Father's Day every year!

Great pie! Came out wonderfully, lovely texture, rich and so pretty. However, it did need to bake longer than suggested to set. I lowered the heat so as to not burn the crust and let it bake an extra 20 minutes. 
Next time I will cut the sugar by half -- I found that the sweetness overpowered the chocolate flavor. I also subbed in coconut evaporated milk (it was what I had on hand) and it still came out fine!

I never care about recipes. I usually just make whatever comes up near the top of a google search. But this chocolate pie was so good, it caused  me to create this account (which I never do) so that I could keep up with the recipe. Ive made this pie 8-10 times over the last 3 years and everyone thinks its some kind of pie magic.  Seriously... never runny... perfect every time.

Being low on milk for my other Chocolate pie recipe I said what the heck lets try it since I did have condense milk on hand. The texture was like a brownie but you could feel and taste the sugar crystals with in. I should have gone out and got milk and made the pie I normally make.

So I made this for my family last night and it turned out ok. The only recommendation for the future is use only half the sugar needed for the chocolate mixture. It was so sweet no one could eat it. The texture was perfect, just way too sweet.

So, so sweet.... definitely not for me.  The texture was like how others described - sort of like a raw brownie.  But even if the texture was perfect, there is way too much sugar.  Won't make again.

I only used 1 cup of sugar and did heaping tablespoons of cocoa. I also followed the recipe and didn't heat until everything was in the mixture. The meringue took about 12 minutes to brown. The texture was thicker than I thought it would be but was delicious. My nephews gave it 5 stars.

I have been trying to make a good chocolate pie  for months. This recipe did it! We ate it while it was warm and it was out of this world good. My family who normally does not like meringue loved this one.  My search is over now that I have found this recipe.

I dunno who Bev is, but I like her! I've made this pie  several times over the last three years or so and it never disappoints. I've only made minor changes like increasing the number of egg whites for bigger meringue or guestimating the vanilla. This pie is the best chocolate pie my family has tasted.

It took much longer than 35-45 min.  It makes enough to put into a deep dish.   Might try two regular pie crusts instead

Exceptional pie. Just follow the recipe and don't cook the filling on high, just put it on the lowest setting and take your time in letting the butter melt.  Every person in the house loved it!

I made the for my father at his request for Easter dinner dessert. His Mom was a farmers wife and a great cook. I had never made a pie of this kind and selected to All Recipes for my pie. Everyone raved at Joe good it was and my dad had to get another "sliver" piece it was that good! Big hit at our house. Thanks

This reminds me of the chocolate pie of my childhood. While it's certainly decadent, it's not overly sweet. It is quite different than a chocolate cream pie in that the custard is thick and dense rather than pudding-like. The sweetness of the custard is balanced by the saltiness of a traditional pie crust and meringue instead of overly sweet cookie or graham crust and whipping cream. I followed the directions exactly except that I passed the custard through a sieve upon pouring it into the pie shell. I will definitely make this again!

Love this pie. Been looking for this recipe for a while. I added extra vanilla to. And I put the meringue on when the pie was almost done so the middle was still slightly wobbly. Baked an extra 13 minutes and there you go. Oh and for a deeper chocolate flavor an extra tbsp or two of chocolate. Yummy   so good

I have made this pie several times and it always turns out good.  I am out of condensed milk today, so I'm going to try it with regular milk and see how it turns out.  The only negative I have is that sometimes it needs to cook a little longer to get the perfect consistency.  I'm sure this is probably an oven issue as opposed to a recipe issue.

I made the recipe exactly as written, and it looked beautiful as I took it out of the oven.  But I did NOT like the chocolate flavor.  About 8 of us had a piece and we all agreed that the chocolate had a funky taste.  Sorry, but this recipe is not a keeper for me!

This Pie is fantastic!!   Like other reviewers, I cut back a bit on the sugar and I cooked the pie just over an hour as opposed to the 35-40 minutes listed in the recipe.   The pie was one of the best, if not the best pie I have eaten.   I made this pie to take to a Thanksgiving dinner because I am not a huge pumpkin pie fan.  The pie was gobbled up in a flash and the pumpkin pies barely were touched.   I liked it so much that I made another one right after Thanksgiving because I only had one small piece.  I highly recommend this pie, but you do need a bit of patience because it does take a while to cook.

I baked it for an extra 15 minutes, but it didn't firm up. I hoped once it was cool it would set but the texture was gelatinous, almost slimey. The taste was way too sweet and not chocolatey enough. The kids liked it but I will be looking for another recipe.

It's not bad, just not my cup of tea.  I was looking for a more pudding like chocolate pie.

Great recipe. I did pour the filling through a screen to get rid of a few little lumps. Was so beautiful coming out of the oven with the meringue. Will be making this pie again soon. So much better than store bought pie. Thank you!

Love it.  It's just like the one my Mom made when I was growing up, except she would spread some peanut butter on the crust before baking.

AWESOME! My family loved it! I didn't change a thing, which is unusual for me. It's the perfect texture and richness. I will look no further for a chocolate pie recipe, I've found the one I will use over and over! I expect this pie will  be in high demand, and it's so easy to make. Thank you for sharing!!

I swear it seems more than not, people have to gripe and complain about everything including pie recipes. I made this for the first time for my mom. It turned out really pretty. I used a whisk to stir the pie filling in the saucepan. It was creamy pouring into the pie shell. Me and my roomate were licking the pot afterwards lol! I will say I added about 7 mins more to cooking the pie.I was still "wobbly" after 40mins. Came out very pretty as well as the merinque. my family has always used my grandma's chocolate pie recipe. But its MIA. I wrote this one down in my recipe book. This will be made LOTS more. Well done! :)

I've made this pie several times we really like it. It's very close to what my grandmother used to make. The only change I make is reduce the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cup. It's just enough sweet that way, you don't miss the sugar at all.

Easy, excellent pie.  I read several reviews and debated making this because of the negative comments.  Glad I tried it and will make it again.  It had the creaminess that I was hoping for there was no grittiness or brownie like consistency.  I don't know what others did to have that problem.

Except for a little too sweet, this pie is to die for.  I am not a chocolate pie eater but when I made it for my husband I did taste it and it was like chocolate fudge between crust and merange.

I made this chocolate pie recipe and it was the first chocolate pie I had ever made.  It was so easy and so delicious.  My husband is a pie lover and he was amazed at how good it was.  I will make this the family favorite chocolate pie.

Yum!  This was amazing!  Make sure you blend the egg yolks in before heating the mixture.  I used 10 ounces of evaporated milk instead of 12 ounces.  Also I used 1/3 cup of cocoa (which is 6 tbsp) just because it was easier than measuring out 5 tablespoons.  ;-)  This is my favorite chocolate pie recipe that I keep coming back to.  Wonderful!

I made this for Christmas and everyone said it was the best chocolate pie ever!  You do have to follow the recipe and make sure to not cook it on the stove but just melt the butter and then cook it in the oven.  Also use the best cocoa available.

Silky, creamy smooth chocolate deliciousness! First chocolate pie I've ever made, but it won't be the last!  Used Special Dark cocoa.  
Followed the recipe exactly.  Mix everything into the sauce pan, THEN turn on the medium heat and stir til butter is melted - the pie filling is silky smooth.

This is a great, delicious, simple recipe. Use a lard crust to balance out the sweet and (as recommended below) granulated sugar you really mix in and don't add heat too early. Absolutely delicious

Excellent pie filling...just need to add another 1 T flour for thicker pie that doesn't fall apart. I used whipped cream with vanilla bean instead of meringue.

I have made this pie at least 20 times and it NEVER fails. Those saying it doesn't set up should pay attention to the direction that says it should be baked until it is no longer wobbly. This is a SOUTHERN CLASSIC that my grandmother made for years.  I have 2 of them in the oven now and I am certain that they will be as delicious as all of the others I have made.

I made this tonight. I would like to thank Stephanie for her suggestion to use 1 1/2 cup sugar and to blend everything together in the blender. I also added 1/2 tsp salt to the mixture. It was super easy.  The texture of the pie was similar to pumpkin pie.

This pie was delicious. The pie had a real nice chocolate taste to it! The egg whites made alot of meringue so I wouldn't add all of it on there. Definitely will make again.

This pie is awesome! My family is not a big fan of meringue so I made the pie without it and added cool whip on top when I served it. I will be making this many many more times.

It was really good! It was my first time making this recipe and I have to say it was quite time consuming but excellent! Instead of pie crust I opted for more of a cheesecake crust using crushed biscuits, butter and cocoa. I also couldn't find any evaporated milk so I used whipping cream instead (probably about 1 1/4 c). Other than that, I followed the recipe as shown and it was perfect. Maybe next time I'll go for more meringue though!

As described, the filling is not "runny" - it's disagreeable in texture, appearance and flavor. The only chocolate characteristic it possesses is in color. I'm not an amateur, nor particularly fussy, but this one needs to go back to the test kitchen!

This pie is great! I made it pretty much by the recipe, with just a few changes.  I mixed everything in my saucepan (adding an extra tbsp of cocoa) and cooked it on the stove until it starting boiling. (about 5-8 min) Poured it in the crust and baked it for exactly 40 min. I also tented my crust edges with foil so it wouldnt brown too much. It came out perfect.  It still had a little wobble to it, but it firmed up as it sat.  I used a tried and true meringue recipe (3 egg whites, 1/4 tsp cream of tarter, and 6 tbsp sugar) it took about 15 min to brown.  It truely is a different consistency than a typical chocolate pie and it is really sweet, but we all thought it was great. (Even my mom who isnt a chocolate pie lover :)

I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  I did let the mixture come to a boil before I added the eggs.  I also added some of the hot mixture to the eggs to bring them up in temp before adding them all to the hot mixture.  This pie is great!  So easy and very yummy!

I have been making this pie for years.  It is a great tasting chocolate pie, but the meringue was never puffy enough and I finally figured out why!!  The sugar measurement is completly off in this recipe.  After some research, I learned that you should have no lesss that 2 Tablespoons of sugar per egg white in a meringue.  There was never enough sugar!  Otherwise,this is a terrific pie that we have been enjoying for almost a decade!

The first time I baked this pie I followed the directions to a T.  The texture was weird and tasted super sweet not chocolatety.  I was determined to make this pie taste good. 2nd try. First off I did only 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 6 tablespoons of chocolate. I also didn't do the meringue topping (I think she didn't want to waste the egg whites). I used cool whip.  Tasted much better.  Also for the stove part I cooked it on low until every bit of sugar was melted and used my mixer with the whisp on the end.  Once all melted together I added the butter melted that than poured in pillsbury pie crust. 3rd try.  Did everything the same as second except for I realized I cooked to hot probably on medium and the yolk started to cook.  I have a feeling this one wont turn out like the second try.  So my suggestions is I would do everything the same as second time but add the egg and butter at the same time.  I think the egg gets cooks to long and that is was gives it a weird texture.

Tried this for the first time last night. It came out perfect.  I recommend sifting your chocolate as mine was a bit lumpy for some reason.  
I also cooked mine about 5 minutes longer. I am in Texas where it is hot and humid. 
I didn't add meringue, as we like fresh and cold cool whip or land or lakes cool whip from the can.  
It came together very well and the taste is just right.

Found this recipe here several years ago and it has become my family's favorite chocolate pie.  In fact, it's my standard contribution to our family Thanksgiving dinner.  Very rich, but perfect for chocolate lovers.

It gets 3 stars because it's pretty and edible. But the taste is decent at best. It's too sweet and has a brownie-like texture. It may have been because all I had was self-rising flour and used 10oz of evaporated milk. Anyhow, I may try it again when I get the right kind of flour. Then we'll see.

Very good, I used a mixer for everything before putting it on the stove to heat. I had to cook for about 45 minutes plus about 6 for the meringue, so my frozen store-bought pie crust was overcooked.

This is honestly the BEST chocolate pie I have ever had.  The reviews are spot on regarding the texture of the pie - between a brownie and normal pudding type pie.  Amazing!  Be sure to allow time for it to set after baking.  We served pretty quickly after removing from the oven and it was very runny.  Much better the next day after it had been in the frig and "set".

The pie is beautiful and has nice chocolate flavor however it was too sweet for us.  My husband asked if I made it from a mix. (Yes, he’s still alive.)  He thought it tasted processed.  That may be because it was so sweet.  Also, my baking time was substantially more than 40 minutes.

WOW!!!!!  This pie is easy and amazing. Just what I had been looking for. Definitely should have used a deep dish crust. I used a regular sized pie crust and ended up with leftover filling.  Also makes a lot of meringue.

Delicious! I was looking for an easy chocolate pie recipe for my 12 year old son to make and am thrilled I ran across this one. We followed the recipe exactly except we skipped any topping. I agree that it is very rich but that means it goes farther. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great pie!!   Big hit with my friend for Valentine's Day.  Rich and not overly sweet.  I added dark chocolate pieces to the pie before baking and then sprinkled finely chopped dark chocolate over the meringue after it was lightly browned and let them melt.  Yummy.

I first made this pie a couple years ago. It is now a must have for Christmas. It is always the first pie to go when I make it. I love the chocolatety taste that it has. I dont understand how some of the reviews say it doesnt have that taste. This year though I am trying a different merigne topping that I use on a cupcake reciepe I have. Hopefully it's just as good, if not better.

We made two pies for Thanksgiving!  IT WAS AWESOME!  This is a must try recipe.  It tasted great!  We did not change a thing but the cooking time.  We had to cook it for around 1 hour.  Worth the extra time!!  Enjoy!

Best pie ever!!!!!  It is like a pie that Ollie's Barbecue in Birmingham, Ala had.  This is NOT a milk chocolate pie.  It is fudge-like (in flavor), brownie-like (in flavor) and fabulous.  The only thing you need to do is cut the pieces half the size of normal.  It is very rich and satisfying.  It turned out looking exactly like the picture.  I left a gathering with an empty pie plate.  I am still hearing the great comments.  What luck that I found this.

Wow! I don't see how anyone could give this pie a bad rating. It has been my favorite for years, made exactly as stated no changes made.

I have been looking for this recipe EVERYWHERE! However, I could not find evaporated milk at the store where I live. The first time I made it I tried condensed milk instead. (If you do this, be sure to use less sugar.) This made the chocolate thicker. The next time I tried 1/2 cup of milk, and it worked perfectly! It tastes like my grandmother's recipe. Thank you so much!

This pie does have an unusual consistency, but it was good.  I cut the sugar to 1 CUP, and I HIGHLY recommend doing that.  One cup was plenty, esp. if you top with sweetend whipped cream, as I did. (To me, this pie did not lend itself to a meringue topping.)  I cannot imagine putting the full amount of sugar - it would be horribly sweet.  I also added 2 T extra cocoa and used 3 yolks instead of 4.  I recommend my changes :) - it was very good.

Love this pie!  The recipe was easy to follow and the pie was beautiful and tasty!  This is not a jello pudding/cool whip pie.  The chocolate filling has brownie-like texture and sweetness.  Will make this again.

Fantastic Chocolate Pie. On my first attempt I did not make sure that the Meringue sealed to the edge. This is very important so pay close attention to that. This pie is exactly what I crave when I want a chocolate pie.

I made this for Christmas and my mother-in-law said it was better than her mother's pie.  My husband is begging me to make another one.  My son said this was the best chocolate pie he has ever had in his mouth.  I didn't get to try it, because it was gone in a flash, but based on praise it gets five stars.  Looked beautiful too.

My 5 year old daughter wants to marry this pie, and have babies.   I asked her if she would eat them and she said yes.  This is a very good chocolate pie.  I'm not a fan of this type  of thing, but I can tell it was very good. I rarely cook or bake and made this recipe because my 5 year old was begging me for some chocolate pie for weeks.   I  love merengue but it's so tricky to make.  I worked it a little too much and end up with marshmellow fluff instead of merengue.  I think that was in part because my mixer is quite crappy.    Thanks for the recipe and all the wonderful reviews.

There's a long standing recipe in my family for chocolate pie. I have asked my mom for it 2 years ago. My divorced husband loves and requests me to make it every holiday possible. This year it was more than begging. Well I did get the recipe, but it was runny every time. I think My mother intentionally gave me the wrong amounts. I know how to put it all together, but I really think she wanted to remain the famous one for the perfect pie. Thank you Beverly for this one. I will be making it tomorrow. Whisk me luck!!!

If you are looking for a "pudding" pie - this is NOT it.  This is a thick chocolate pie that is so creamy and YUMMY!  I was surprised when I poured it into the crust that it set up - but it did and it was GREAT!  I am making 2 more this weekend.  Thank you Bev, your pie is delicious!

We made this for a family function and because I had so much to do, I had my husband make it.  He does not cook, much less bake and with a minimal amount of guidance, it came out beautifully!  I use a high quality cocoa powder and this was very chocolatey.  I was really hoping there would be some leftovers as most of the family prefer fruit desserts, but all I had was an empty pie plate...no one could believe my husband made it either!  Very simple recipe and incredibly good!

Made this for an aunt that requested chocolate pie.  I'd never made one before, so I really was nervous.  This pie was delicious, and it passed her test!  It did take a lot longer than 35-40 minutes to bake until it was not "wobbly" (maybe because I had a casserole baking as well) but it finally got to that point-I thought I'd ruined it because it looked dry, but I put the meringue on anyway and when it was all done, it was beautiful.  We ate it while it was still warm, and it was not runny, and it was not dry, just a delicious chocolate pie.  I'll be making it again!

This pie was super easy to make and for the most part was a success. It was a bit too sweet for my taste so the next time I make it I'll cut down on the sugar. Overall though I think it's a good recipe.

This is awesome. My first homemade chocolate pie and it was delicious and set perfectly. I took advice from other reviewers and cooked the cocoa, sugar, evap milk mixture for prob 10-15 minutes just before boiling, and then let it cool quite a bit before adding the eggs. The mixture barely fit into a regular pie shell. It baked 40 minutes and was perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

Well, my husband, who is a chocolate fanatic, actually said this had too much chocolate!  It's the first time I've ever heard him say that.  It's also too sweet for me, a sugar fanatic!  So use caution.

This recipe was so simple to make, and it contained ingredients that I always have on hand.  Great pantry dessert to make for unexpected guests.

BUT...I had to cook it for 55 minutes rather than what the recipe called for.  Unfortunately, I had my meringue ready to go after 35 minutes and during the 20 minute wait for the pie, it got very grainy and thick -- probably because I made the mistake of attempting meringue on a rainy day.

Anyway, I will definitely make this again...and again....and again....and again...

Very rich!  Great reviews from family.  It needed a little longer in my oven to set up (5 more minutes).  Also, I used a little corn starch and vanilla in the meringe, which also worked well.  I'm already getting requests to make another!

This was just what I was looking for. Creamy and very chocolaty but not to heavy.

I never have made a chocolate pie before, but I have to say that this is amazing. I didn't think that it was to rich, and I love the texture of the pie, not to thick but not pudding either. I was a little nervous about it being runny but it wasn't a problem...perfect

The filling tasted pretty good, but the meringue failed completely.  Total baking time was not included, so I had to check up on it constantly.

This is one of the best chocolate pies I have every had.  It's easy and nice to cut it without all the water left in the dish.  I'm thinking it's so good because of all the sugar :)  Thanks for submitting, it's really good and always a hit.

Great texture, rich taste.  I did make a homemade crust, and still had too much filling-maybe should try a 9.5 inch pie pan instead next time.

This has to be the "Best and Easiest" home-made chocolate pie ever. My entire family requests it and so do my friends. If we are invited anywhere this is the dessert to take. Super...thanks for sharing it with the rest of us.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was gone before I knew it!  I managed to save myself a little slice and I thought it turned out wonderful.  I will definitely make this again for Christmas per my youngest son's request.

Three years ago my boyfriend requested a chocolate pie for his birthday.  I found this recipe and decided to try it.  He LOVED it and I can't tell you how many times I've made it since then.  We just recently got married this past June and I know this recipe will become and old family favorite.

I don't know who Bev is, but she makes good pie!

I have already rated this pie but reading the low reviews I wondered about the strange brownie-like texture some mentioned. When you add the butter to melt in the chocolate mixture it needs to be done on low heat -- no bubbles!!The recipe does not say cook it; just melt the butter.  It takes a little bit longer to do it but might make a difference.

I cooked this pie FOREVER, but it was still very "wobbly" when I removed it from the oven, yet a thick, almost burned crust had developed on top of the chocolate filling and the crust's edges were very done.  It did not run, but the top was a bit overdone....I wonder if my oven is not heating evenly? Will try this again in a different oven...

This was my first attempt at making chocolate pie ever..and I love it!! I did not follow the recipe exactly....I only had 2 small cans of evap. milk so I used a small amount of regular  milk to make up the difference, and it came out just fine.  I have never made meringue before either....but my mixer came with a cook-book and I looked up directions to make that and, the meringue came out beautifully.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I have made this pie several times and it has turned out great every single time. The one thing I do different is I leave out the meringue topping. It's easy to make and has always been a big hit.

This is the best chocolate pie ever!!!  I used a crust with crisco and the pie was not runny at all.  I did cook it a little longer than the recipe said, maybe 7 minutes or so.  It did not last long around my house with 3 boys, a husband, and me being pregnant.  Thank you so much!!!  I will make this over and over.

This is a very good chocolate pie. Very rich tasting. I served it at a dinner party and got rave reviews. However, I changed the meringue recipe to one which calls for cream of tarter in the recipe. NOTE: Make sure you cook the "custard" long enough or this will just turn out as a runny mess.

I made this pie for a bbq we were having.  I timed making my meringue according to the time that was given for the pie to bake..big mistake.  After checking at 35 minutes and then @ 40 minutes I started to panic and came back to read the reviews again.  I let the pie bake for almost an HOUR and it was finally ready for the meringue.  So my meringue turned out a little flat this time, but it was a good pie regardless.  Sweet so a little goes a long way :)

I made this for my husband's family (from the South) and they thought it was very good.  I did find it was VERY runny, but since MOST chocolate pies are...no one really cared...but that all it all it was a good pie.

I tried this pie at Thanksgiving and it got away!  My family loved it and has asked me to bring it to Christmas Dinner!  I am really starting to make home made cakes/pies and I can tell you, for a starter, this is a good one!  Also, I cut back on the sugar by 1/2 for the pie and meringue, I may cut a little more.  GREAT PIE!

This pie was delicious!  It was exactly what I was looking for.  From reading prvious reviews, I decreased the sugar by 1/2 c. and it was great.  Thank you for the recipe.

Fantastic chocolate pie!  I am thrilled to have the recipe.  I did half the sugar and it turned out perfectly.  Super easy. We ate it hot with whipped cream on top.

Not the traditional chocolate pie recipe I was looking for, but it was good.  I did cut back the sugar in the pie and meringue by 1/2 cup and it was sweet enough.  Had a thick texture, not sure if it was supposed to or I had cooked it too long.

This was the first pie I've made that actually turned out good. I did decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup in both the filling and the meringue.

I was searching for a chocolate pie recipe, of the ones I tested this was by far my favorite.  It is creamy, fudgy and not overly chocolatey - just perfect.  It is the only chocolate pie I will make from now on.  P.S.  I did not add the meringue just a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  We adore this recipe - thanks!

I thought this pie was pretty good. I decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup in the pie and only used 1/3 in the meringue, and still found it pretty sweet. My son liked it, he said it tasted like chocolate Malt-O-meal.

I've been using this as my quick and easy recipe and it's wonderful every time I use it. I've learned to cut back on the sugar on the topping though.

I have been making this pie for my husband for a few months.  We found it to be too sweet, but once I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup for the pie and 1/2 cup for the meringue, WE LOVE IT.

This is the best chocolate pie I have ever had.  It is easy to make and tastes great.  You can cut it with a knife and no spoons are needed.
