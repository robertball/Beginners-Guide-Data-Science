This is amazing. I know some people hate to see changes, but here it is, with the basics left totally intact... Used regular low sodium Vigo brand rice (yellow, saffron flavor), but any rice will really do. I gave a healthy shake of ancho chile and chipotle pepper powder to it. Again, you can do this or not, or add whatever you want or not - could be cayenne, chili powder, dash of turmeric (oops, did that), cumin, garlic, onion powder. Point is, it's a perfect builder or leave as is, spice as needed or desired. Light cream cheese 2nd to last layer, light cheddar, and  finally, the spicy panko bread crumbs.  These can also be tweaked. You know how it goes, fattier is always gonna taste better, but it can still be amazing tweaked down. But the panko bread crumbs shouldn't be left out. Regular crumbs will be a downgrade.

Had to substitute whole wheat ritz cracker crumbs for the panko crumbs (I forgot at home) which were difficult to find at the few and far between grocery stores because we were so far up in the mountains.  They worked great and the peppers were yummy!  I might have blanched the peppers or used a little olive oil on them before cooking them but it wasn't absolutely neccesary.

These were great. I made them even easier by not adding the cilantro or taco seasoning.  I didn't have any. Used about a  1/3 - 1/2  cup of leftover (sushi) rice for 8 pepper halves. Just sprayed the cookie sheet, didn't need parchment paper. Added a bit of paprika to bread crumbs for more color. Thanks for this quick tasty recipe.

Another wonderful way to enjoy a jalapeño popper.  My jalapeños were SUPER hot and I did de-seed and de-membrane them.   I appreciated the easy of making these and how filling and hardy they are.  We all enjoyed the panko topping as it added another dimension to the popper.  Thanks mis7up, for your creation of this recipe.  I still have some filling left and 6 more super-hot jalapeños.  I will keep the glass of milk close by!

I bought 8 really large jalapenos and had enough filling for all of them.  The panko that was on top of the jalapenos didn't brown as well as the ones that fell onto the parchment paper so I sprinkled those on top after the baking time.  Perfect appys for football season.  Thank you miss7up!

I love these! I made these as written using long grain rice but with cheddar and mozzarella (no Mexican mix over here) then made up a batch using Scotch Bonnets and leftover Mexican rice. What a nice, versatile recipe. Thanks Mis7up for your recipe.

I made these exactly as written. I think we would have liked them more if there was more cream cheese and a LITTLE bit less rice. I think next time I would do 8oz cream cheese and half the breading. Otherwise, great twist on stuffed peppers! The filling was easy to use and rice was simple to make with Uncle Ben's ready rice! I love these pouches! Thank you for the recipe! Our family loves stuffed peppers.

I made these with the Uncle Ben's Ready Rice Whole Grain Brown and added a bit more Mexican blend cheese and they turned out great. I will admit that I let them cook a few minutes longer and then stuck them under the broiler in the end because I like my cheese so brown that it could nearly be considered burnt. Jalapeno's and cheese are two of my favorite combo's. Thanks for the recipe miss7up!

I admit I was trying to use up some ingredients I had on hand, but I was pretty close to the measurements in the recipe.  I think because I love cheese, I would have preferred more Mexican blend cheese and a little less of the cream cheese, but it was still really good.  We enjoyed it.
