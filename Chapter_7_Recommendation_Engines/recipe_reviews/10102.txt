these turned out great!!  I used the proportions given, but added the milk and extract right after creaming the butter and suga together.  I also added just a little lemon extrach to brighten the flavor a touch.  I then put the finished dough immediately in a ziploc bag, cut a fairly large tip and piped the dough onto my cookie sheet.  Got them in my tummy faster and definitely a keeper!

I made these because I didn't have enough store bought vanilla wafers for banana pudding.  These are wonderful.  I also piped the dough onto the cookie sheet.  The cookies were crisper when I baked them at 375.

Delicious, crispy, buttery little cookies! I followed the recipe exactly. However, after chilling the dough for several hours, I found that it was far too sticky to roll out, even with parchment paper or a bit of extra flour. So, like previous posters, I whipped out my pastry bag and piped out the dough directly onto the cookie sheet. It took a bit more work that way, but the result was a few batches of delicious cookies which tasted exactly like vanilla wafers should. Perfect afternoon snack for my kids and their friends, who could not stop munching them.

I don't think the name Vanilla Wafers is fitting. I was looking for a light snack cookie. These taste good (hence the 5 star rating) but not what I was expecting. These are sweeter and taste a little egg-y to me. My husband said they taste like Christmas Butter Cookies. I followed the ideas of other reviewers and piped these on to the cookie sheet right after mixing and it worked out really well.

I read through reviews for some great tips prior to making these. Several complained they are eggy. I omitted one egg for this recipe. The only other change to ingredients that I made was adding an extra half teaspoon or so of vanilla extract. After chilling, I simply rolled pieces of dough with my hands, as with any other cookie. I pinched off bits that were about a rounded teaspoon. After placing on the sheet, I slightly flattened each with my palm. I baked for about 10 minutes at 375 instead of 400. This assured they were slightly crunchy on the top without being overly browned. These are tasty little cookies. Worked great for banana pudding but I'd eat them as is!

I tried this recipe because I made 2 types of 'Homemade Vanilla Extract' from this site.  One was made with vodka and one with bourbon.  After curing for 6 months it was time to try it out.  I chose this recipe because I could split the recipe and try both types of vanilla with the same recipe.  The results were a great, crisp little cookie.  The dough was very soft so I did not chill for the 1-2 hours, instead I put it in a decorator tube and squeezed it out on the cookie sheet, lined with parchment paper.  No matter what tip I tried the cookies had the same result.  A nice little round cookie with a smooth top.  I got 7 dozen cookies with this recipe.  I froze a bag of them to try a banana pudding recipe with them.  My family really liked this cookie and I know I will make them again.

Easy to make and oh so delicious! Best of all, even though these are still a sugary treat, they don't have the hydrogenated oil and all the rest of the junk I can't pronounce that is found in store wafers.

These were very good. I did have a hard time getting them crispy on top & had to play with the temp & time a little.

5 stars for taste, 4 stars for because of the extra step of having to pipe the cookies. Taste better than store bought.

Thank you HOURGLASSCAT! Definitely sticky, but rolling the dough into balls and smashing them into greaseproof paper on a tray definitely worked! Literally foolproof recipe, if you check the oven every so often until the tops begin to turn brown.

Made recipe as written. I did pipe from a bag instead of refrigerating as others suggested. It made 72 wafers. They turned out so good, light and crispy and very tasty. I was wanting to make a different dessert that called for wafers but I  didn't have any. I have never made them before so I looked this recipe up and thought I would give it a try. I may never buy Nilla Wafers again! I can't wait to make banana pudding with these.

I needed vanilla wafers to for my chocolate rum balls. I just made a sheet of them for this recipe because I was going to grind them up. Recipe was perfect. Incidentally, I use the recipe for Chocolate Rum Balls from this site.

These are soft and chewy, not hard and crispy like the vanilla wafers you buy at a grocery store, in my opinion, they're much better!

I took others advice and piped these (out of a freezer bag) right after the batter was done mixing.  I didn't count, but I got at least 4 dozen out of these, probably more.  I put some in the freezer because I don't think I'll need the whole batch for my no bake banana pudding dessert!
