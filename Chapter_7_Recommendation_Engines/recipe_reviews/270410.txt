The quiche part was fantastic - the sweet potato on the bottom was a bit too sweet for our taste. Will “savory up” the sweet potato part next time.

Everyone loved this and it was perfect for my daughter who is gluten free!  I used lima beans, fresh corn and spinach.  I didn't use mascarpone bc I didn't have it on hand so I used jack cheese, cheddar and any other kind I could find, 6 eggs and half and half and baked it in a greased 8 x 8 pan. for an hour.  It was delicious hot or room temp.  Should have taken a pic because it was picture perfect!
