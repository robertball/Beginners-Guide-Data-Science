A good basic cookie, a little heavy on the salt. If your cookies come out  flat it is most likely due to over mixing. Cream butter and sugar until very light and fluffy 4 or 5 mins. if  you like. Add the dry ingredients and mix by hand just 'till blended.  Your cookies will always stay nice and full.  Over baking can also cause your cookies to flatten out.  Cookies will continue to bake after taken from the oven so don't over do it.

I did as suggested in other reviews and increased the flour by 1/2 cup and baking soda by 1/2 tablespoon, cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. This made the absolutely best cookies ever!! I made them this afternoon thinking they'd last the rest of the week. No way! Between my husband and two children, they'll be gone by tomorrow night. They're fantastic. I'll make these alot!

I have made this recipe several times now and just had to come back and write a review. After one batch this became the favorite cookie among friends and family. I add a 1/2 cup more oats and use a mix of chocolate anf butterscotch chips. One other tip - chill the mix for 2 hours prior to baking and the cookies won't spread. FANTASTIC!

This is a really good cookie. Would have given it 5 stars, but did need to increase the flour to 1 3/4 cup and baking soda to 1 teaspoon. If you use margarine or salted butter, DEcrease the salt to 1/4 tsp or just omit altogether. Salt that is suggested in cookie recipes are generally listed for bakers who use UNsalted butter. This made 36 good sized cookies. I chilled the dough for around 30 minutes, due to reading o thers having spreading problems. I made them a tad larger than a 'normal' sized cookie. I did an experiment and baked these (with above changes) at 350 for 12 minutes, they spread too much, became too brown around the edges and were only chewy in the dead center. Next batch I baked at 350 for 10 minutes, then 11, and finally to 12...because anything under 12 the center was still quite doughy but at 12 they spread quite a bit and were more thin and crispy than soft or chewy. At 325, 12 minutes cookies were too raw and any longer and the center would get overbaked. I then set the oven up to 335, yes 335, and baked for 12 minutes. PERFECTO. Results were: the cookie was softer, only very edges were crisp, center was soft and still slightly puffy. My suggestions would be to add about 1/2 cup more flour, and the full tsp of baking soda (you can not taste it and it does not produce a cake like cookie by any means), if you're kitchen is warm- chill the dough for 30 minutes to an hour and bake for the 12 minutes at 335. This is my new oatmeal cookie. Thanks Dr Amy!!

These cookies are AMAZING.  I have not met one person who did not like them...

I change the recipe a bit and use 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce (healthier, plus it makes the cookies more chewy).  Also, I use more flour (1 and 1/2 cups) and don't include nuts.  

GREAT recipe!

Good, but the cookie ended up flat, I added 1/4 cup more flour, 1/2 teaspoon more baking soda, and 1/2 tsp less salt the second time and they came out perfect! YOu must do these adjustments or you will probably have a flat cookie.

Can't give this recipe 5 stars because it took several changes to get the AMAZING cookies that were the final result. My husband is a "cookie monster" & said these very well may be the best cookies ever. Here's what I changed: 1) Added 1/2 extra cup flour (for a grand total of 1 and 3/4 cup flour). 2) Cut the salt down to less than 1/2 teaspoon 3)I increased the baking soda by half a teaspoon for a grand total of one FULL teaspoon baking soda 4)Used about 3/4 cup Cape Cod dried cranberries and half a bag of Hershey's milk chocolate chips. 5)I whipped the butter and sugar until VERY light and fluffy. 6) After mixing the rest of the batter I stuck the bowl of batter into the freezer for about ten minutes before baking. I used a cookie dough scoop to make rounded ice cream scoop shapes of dough on the cookie sheet (which I lined with a Silpat baking sheet). 7) I cooked them at 335 until they still looked like they needed another minute or two -- looked a little wet still and when tapped with a finger on top they "deflated" a little. 8) I took them out of the oven and left them on the cookie sheet for about two to five minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Note: I put the dough into the fridge between batches so it stayed firm. No spreading took place during baking. The day after baking these they remain super chewy and moist. PERFECTION. Good enough to give with Christmas cookie assortment. UPDATE: Add cinnamon!

This was such an awful cookie! I followed the ingredients To the EXACT! the cookies were extremely flat, didnt taste too good, and the edges burnt since the cookie turned so flat. I would most definately never make these cookies again. I made 42 cookies and it turned into 3 large flat cookie slabs, and after about 10 minutes, the cookies outsides were too hard.

Excellent, excellent recipe!  I've tried several oatmeal cookie recipes and this one definitely is the best.  Kudos to the creator.  I did modify it a bit because I'm always looking for shortcuts.  Instead of doing the individual cookie thing I baked the recipe in 2 cake pans at 350 for about 25-30 minutes and the bars came out totally yummy!  This one is a definite keeper!

I altered the recipe by adding 1/4 cup more flour, 1/2 tsp. more baking soda, and 1/2 tsp. LESS salt. I also made it more "healthy" by substituting 1/2 cup of the butter with 1/2 cup applesauce, and also by replacing one of the eggs with 2 egg whites. I did add about 1/3 - 1/2 cup more oats b/c it was a little too wet. My family LOVED them! They are yummy!!

Great cookie recipe! Modified it as others have by using 1-1/2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and chilled the dough for a couple hours. They didn't last too long on the rack because when I wasn't looking, my boyfriend kept stealing them.

Oh my, oh my - these are TO die for! Now that I've made them several times, here's how they turn out the best:
* set butter and eggs out so they are room temp. before using
* make sure you mix the 2nd set of ingredients seperate from the sugar/butter mixture
* add a 1/2 cup more flour
* add a dash of cinnamon
* cut the vanilla to 1 tsp.
* cut the salt to 1/2 tsp 
* use the highest quality chocolate chips
* once ingredients are all together, stir JUST until mixed
* drop into taller piles on cookie sheet
Woah . Yum!

Read the modifications & made these - THEY CAME OUT PERFECT!!!  1) Cookies can be runny when you use ALL butter (it has such a low melting point) so I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco (i used plain - but butter crisco works too) 2) do not use an electric mixer!!!! it breaks everything down WAY TOO MUCH.... just use a wooden or large metal spoon to mix... and mix it JUST enough.... gentle! 3) after the wet ingredients ... PUT IN THE OATMEAL (i used 1/2 quick oats and 1/2 real oats because the quick oats break down). still, the oats stirred into the wet ingredients sop up any moisture 4) used pecan instead of walnuts - they aren't bitter. put them in next before the flour also so they get mixed in well with the batter. IF YOU DO NOT USE NUTS - ADD 1/4 c. MORE FLOUR!! 5) then put in the flour and soda/salt - I use the same proportion of salt and soda and they come out great - 1/2 t. each 6) chocolate chips last - 1 c. is a good amount and mix barely until mixed.  SECRET FOR BAKING: if you bake them immediately, then 335 for 12 minutes.  If you put them in the frig - 350 for 13 minutes. 7) LAST BIG SECRET:  The recipe calls for letting them rest on the hot baking sheet for 5 minutes - DO THAT!!! IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT!!!  Yummmmmm!

Haha! So I can't help but laugh because, yes, these cookies are very good, but with the reviewers modifications this recipe is nearly identical to the one on the Quaker Oats lid. I wanted to try a new recipe and when I got to the oats part, I peeked at the tried and true recipe on the canister and with the recommended addition of 1/2 c. flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and cutting the salt in half...the only difference is that this recipe has double the vanilla. Still good, but not worth wading through the reviews to come to the same recipe as most folks have in their cupboard.

These were good, but not exceptional. Not so crazy delicious I'll remember them and make them again.  The cookies are chewy, in keeping with their title, but for some reason they were a little short on flavor. While I made these exactly as the recipe directs, I don't necessarily have any suggestions on how to make them better except, perhaps, to increase the white sugar by a half cup.  I have to admit I'm a little confused as to the rock star status of this recipe.  Granted, it turns out well, but at the end of the day it's still a dependable recipe for an average cookie.

these cookies are veeeeeeeeeery good, but if you dont modifie it as other reviewers say, you probably will have a flat cookie.. so the ingredients that you should change are: flour, use 1 3/4 cups. baking soda, use 1 teaspoon. salt, only 1/2 teaspoon. If using salted butter, omit the salt.
Update: I made these again and I cant believe how happy they make people LOL. Just wanted to say that the batter will seem very tough and hard.. but they come out very soft and chewy!
If you want a chewy cookie let them cool on the cookie sheet 5 minutes, if you want a crispier cookie let them cool 1 minute! there is an article called perfect cookies on this site, its very helpful

Love this recipe! However, I prefer whole or old-fashioned oats and made the following modifications: 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening.  1 1/2 cups flour. 2 cups chocolate chips. Everything else I left the same. 

Whole oats do not absord as much moisture as quick oats which is why I changed things a little. They were FABULOUS this way.

LISTEN TO THE MODIFICATIONS EVERYONE IS SAYING TO DO! I have made these cookies multiple times but they came out as the biggest hit when I increased the flour by 1/2 cup, the baking soda by 1/2 tablespoon, cut the salt to 1/2 tsp, and instead of 1 cup of chocolate chips I just added the entire bag. They were simply PERFECT and have never had such a good response to them from family and friends as this modified version. Excellent!

I have to say that although these cookies were buttery and very good tasting, it is NOT what the other reviewers have rated it.  You shouldn't have to modify a recipe to make it better...it should be as is.  I go for recipes that are rated good to excellent, and this one was rated excellant.  It is almost too buttery, and the dough runs together when it cooks.  The cooking time takes longer than it states, and since it runs, the edges burn.  They don't come off the pan, and I have a BIG slump of cracked cookie pieces that are carmelized and definately not a five star rating.  The recipe needs a little less butter and more flour.

I've been making these cookies for years, and for some reason never rated them.  These are PHENOMENAL.  Probably the best homemade cookies I've ever made.  I follow the recipe exactly with the exception of adding the walnuts.  My only suggestion is, if you are using salted butter, be sure to omit the extra salt.  It's not necessary to use salt at all in that case, and in fact, they'll turn out to be too salty if you do.  Also, if you really want them to be chewy and soft, be sure to take them out while they still look slightly undercooked. Cookies that are golden brown always become hard after they cool down.  If you're like me and you only like soft cookies, take them out while they're still a little bit gooey.  Once they cool off, they'll firm up a bit, but still be soft.

I thought these were great.  And unlike others, I really didn't think it needed any modifications.  It really DID seem like the dough/batter was just "wrong", it looked wrong, felt wrong, and seemed like it would never become a cookie, because it was just a blob of oatmeal coated in stuff and didn't have much cohesion at all.  I DID have a huge urge to modify it (and adding more flour was my top compulsion), but I resisted.  Once baked they were perfect. I think the key is to get them out at the right time.  12 minutes in my oven (notoriously under-powered) was quite undercooked, so I had to go 13-14 minutes to have them turn out right.  Just know your oven, and adjust accordingly, that's my best advice.  At least make them un-tweaked once so you know what you're changing.  IF I were going to change anything next time it would probably be a little less sugar and (gasp) I'd omit the chocolate chips.  I just loved the nutty earthy oatmeal of this cookie and wanted less distraction from it.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.  Edited to add: This works absolutely fine with old fashioned oats.  We don't use quick oats in my family, so that's all we had, and all we wanted, and it turned out perfect, fine and yummy.

I would have rated this recipe with 5 stars, but since the 5 star result took a little recipe tweaking I took it down a notch. I used an additional 1/2 cup of flour, substituted organic Irish style oats for the instant, cut the salt in half and chilled the dough before baking. The results were a chewy, evenly baked and well formed cookie that disappeared post haste. This makes my weekly cookie rotation.

Good, but I prefer Beth's Spicy Oatmeal Raisin cookies because it has all those spicy flavors.  This one was a bit plainer.  I followed other's advice about adding 1/4 to 1/2 extra flour (I added 1/3), and I'm glad I did.  The texture was perfect with the added flour.

OMG!  Excellent!  I took everyone's suggestions and they came out amazing.  Cut the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Use 1 tsp. baking soda, 1 1/2 c. flour, 2 c. oats, 1 c. milk choc chips and 1 c. semi chips.  Add 1 tsp. cinnamon. 325 degrees for 11 mins.  They come out soft but set once taken out.  No spreading.  AWESOME!!

Absolutely delicious!  I substituted butter flavored crisco for the butter, and used 1 3/4 cups of chocolate chunks, as well as regular rolled oats.  Definitely a keeper!  Also watch the time - 9-10 minutes did it for mine.

This was my first cookie recipe as an adult (ha!) I'm getting rave reviews on these and my sister even told me I could enter these in a contest. First try I omitted the walnuts and I added an extra cup of chocolate chips & a few heaping teaspoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. I used big mounds of dough on the 12x17 ungreased sheet (12 cookies on the sheet @ a time).I made these again yesterday, this time making the mounds smaller on the sheet (20 cookies @ a time).Used the recipe as is, then split the dough in half: in one I used a cup of walnuts & a cup of chocolate chips: they came out SO GOOD. In the other I used a cup of Reece's Pieces for hubby & he said (with a mouthful of cookie) "mmph...good job hon!"

My cookies ended up baking for about 17 minutes @ 325. Cooled on the pan for a couple minutes. The bigger cookies needed a full 5, the smaller ones could be taken off almost immediately.
No problems with runny dough, but the reece's pieces cookies looked flatter like they WANTED to run, but didnt.
When mixing the dough, I first creamed the butter and sugars etc & put all the dry ingredients into a re-sealable baggy. I ground up 2.5 cups of the rolled oats and left the other 1/2 whole & added that to the dry ingredients in the baggy too, shook it all up, THEN added the dry ingredients to the wet ones. Mixed only until incorporated.
The dough stayed in the frige in between batches.
I will DEFINATELY make these again!

Really are VERY good cookies, and I've been a baker all my life, so I'm pretty picky about my baked goods!  Used F. Foodie. advice and increase flour to 1 3/4 cup and baking soda to 1 tsp, halve the salt.  (Use unsalted butter, as you always should with baking.)  Funny enough, 335 for 12 min really did work!  Trust the recipe...they will not look done....but let them sit on the pan for 5 minutes before you remove them.  Your taste buds (but perhaps not your hips) will thank you!

I made two batches of these cookies four days ago, and I am very impressed. The cookies are still as soft and chewy as when they came out of the oven, and they've been stored in an open plastic bag.  I definitely will be making these again and again!

I thought these were okay - certainly not the best cookie I've ever had.  If I made them again, I'd probably substitute margarine for the butter - my cookies spread WAY too much - they were all over the cookie sheet.  I also thought they were way too salty - would cut the salt in half.

Quick, easy, and delicious! (From cabinet to oven in under 1.5 Meat Loaf songs.) 

I followed other suggestions, changing flour to 1 1/2 cups (1/2 of which was wheat), salt to 1/2 tsp, and baking soda to 1 tsp. They didn't spread at all and turned out puffy, chewy, and perfect!

These cookies are wonderful.  I was looking for a chewy recipe and this is it.  I added 1 cup toffee pieces instead of the nuts.  Took some to work today and they were gone in minutes.  My co-workers are asking for more!

These cookies were okay, they have the potential to be amazing and some of the better chocolate chip cookies I've eaten. I followed this recipe exactly (other than halfing it) and was disappointed because of the saltiness, they didn't seem too flat to me, just salty. This recipe has 2941 reviews with a 4.5 star rating, so I was a little annoyed that after I made this recipe and read the reviews almost every single 4 and 5 star review had changed the flour and salt. Please people rate these recipes as they are written, because in all honestly this recipe is not worth 4.5 stars as is. Is it that hard to rate a recipe as it is and then write in your review changes that are needed to make it a better recipe?

I went along with the general consensus of reviewers and added a bit more flour and baking soda.  The texture- soo soft and chewy even two days later- deserves 10 stars.  But the taste- 2, maybe 3 stars.  They were really bland.  Maybe I'll add some cinnamon to the dry mixture next time?  Or even more vanilla?  The taste was just nothing special :(

Not nearly enough flour, burnt to a crisp on the bottom while still raw in the center. Made the mistake of not reading the reviews and just trusting the star-rating. I don't know why people rate it a 5 star when they have to modify everything to make it work

I followed the recipe exactly and found that my cookies didn't spread at all. They were tasty, but kept the original shape of the spoon I used to put them on the cookie sheet. Next time I might make them into round balls and press them so they have more of a cookie shape.

I absolutely love this recipe!!  Possibly the best cookies ever.  I found it a couple months ago and I have already made it several times.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, ommitting the walnuts, and they came out PERFECT every time. Unfortunately, this most recent time I followed the advice of adding 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp less salt and they were not nearly as good.  I always thought mine were fluffy and chewy, but this time they were flat, and my husband said he preferred them a little saltier like the times before.  Next time I will do the exact measurements again.

This is very good base recipe.  For those complaining it's too salty-try 1/2 tsp salt instead of 1 tsp salt.  I follow this general rule with cookies: anytime a recipe calls for 1/2 tsp of baking soda or baking powder, that's the same amount of salt I add.  Also, it does start out slightly runny, but just space your dough drops to give room for baking -once they bake they will be perfect.  I always pull my cookies out about 30 sec-1min before they are actually done, and then let them cool a few min before moving them and they are always perfect.  I suggest adding about 1/2 cup more choc chips and also 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a dash or two of nutmeg for a little kick.  Another killer thing to add is some shredded coconut for a change up.  For butter- I use just plain old country crock and it's delicious everytime. Another thing you can do is substitute baking powder for the soda and it will bake your cookies up a little more.  And if this has too much oats for you-try 2 1/2 cups instead of 3 and just add a touch more flour.  Another great change up-try half butterscotch or peanut butter chips and half choc chips.
     that's all my tips for this rockin recipe!

I was short 1/2 cup of oats and these turned out flat, and crispy around the edges (much like the previous reviewer).  I used raisins instead of the chips and they were pretty good.  Thanks Doc!

I loved these cookies after a little tweaking. I have found that cooking these at 375 for about 10 minutes kept them from falling apart so much. I also replaced the chocolate chips with a bag of Sunkist Goldens and Cherries (Golden raisins and cherries) and they were EXCELLENT! They are already gone and I made them last night!

Love this recipe - extra chewy!  Based on other people's comments, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour - I may bump it up even a bit more next time, as they did spread a bit more than I wanted.

As with any recipe her, I always read the reviews first.  I increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups, increased the baking soda to 1 tsp., decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. since I used salted butter and decreased the vanilla to 1 tsp. I ALWAYS bake a small batch of cookies when I am making a recipe for the first time.  I am glad I did.  I baked 6 cookies and let them cool.  I went back to the mix and added a pinch more salt, and about 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  Due to family preference, I did not add any nuts.  I just tried one this morning with my coffee, the before and after cookie.  I must say the after cookie has much more flavor.  Texture of the cookie is great the next day.  Will probably make these again with my modifications.

Best ever! Made them with craisins instead of choc chips (although I would do the chips next time!) They are still chewy days later, although not too many are left! I refrigerated the dough before baking as suggested by others, as well as took the suggestions to decrease salt to 1/4 tsp, increase flour to 1 1/2 cups, soda to 1 tsp and add cinnamon. We thought we might try them another time with coconut and craisins too! Thanks for a keeper!

This is just the kind of oatmeal cookie I enjoy eating (chewy, nuts, chocolate), but I just made these and was VERY disappointed. I agree completely with MAMAMIA03... they were too buttery and ran on my pans.  They got too brown before the center was done.  I had to scrape them off.  They fall apart.  I added nutmeg and cinnamon to my recipe.  I added more flour to the last batch I put in the oven, but it didn't help the consistency.  Terrible cookies, great ice cream topping.  A waste of ingredients.

They're good, but not as oatmeal-ly as I was looking for. We actually enjoyed the cookie dough raw than eating it baked. :)

Delicious cookie, but BEWARE. Recipe doesn't say, but you need heaping TABLESPOONS to form, not teaspoons. That's why one reader said it made an enormous amount. Also, you need to bake longer, or at higher temperature. Cookies are not done 12 minutes at 325 degrees. Don't let this stop you. Cookies have fabulous flavor. I did not have quick-cooking oats, so I processed regular oats for 10 seconds in food processor. It also might be a good idea to chill dough for about 10 minutes in fridge before or after molding in order to avoid undue spreading when baking. And cool on sheet a full five minutes before removing cookies to rack. Sounds like lots of work, but really are fairly easy to make. And definitely worth it -- wonderful texture and flavor.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and increased the flour to 1 3/4 cup and the baking soda to 1 tsp. With those changes, this is a 5 star recipe, but as written, only about a 4. Everyone LOVED these cookies. I used about 2 cups old-fashioned oats and 1 cup of quick-cooking oats as I didn't have enough quick-cooking oats. I've never had Beatrice'e Excellent Oatmeal cookies, but these reminded me of Great Harvest Bread Company's Oatmeal cookies which are absolutely fabulous (though their cookies do not have chocolate chips). Oh, and based upon personal preference, I did not add the walnuts. This recipe (with the changes) is a keeper!

These were great cookies.  I made them by dropped spoonfull the first night and then rolled up and refrigerated the leftover dough and sliced them up in the morning and they were much better consistency when done that way so from now on i will roll this dough and slice.  Excellent!

People are overcomplicating this with all the changes. I just added 1/4 c flour and used chunks instead of chips. These cookies got rave reviews from every single person who had one. (though most had more than one!)

Great cookies!  I've made these several times following the recipe exacty, but omitting the walnuts and adding more chocolate chips, and they're great.  These cookies are so chewy.  I actually made them last night and I was short on the oatmeal - I had just under 2 1/2 cups.  The cookies still turned out fine, but spread out a little more while baking than before.  Try these!  If you like chocolate chips and oatmeal, you'll like these cookies.

Dr Amy give up your doctoring and just bake cookies. This recipe is pure ambrosia. I took the libety of modifying a little..hope u don't mind. I used craisins,coconut and pecans. But your recipe was the best part. Cookies are moist and so chewy. Delicious. In a rating of 1-5 this is a 10.

They were pretty good i gotta admit.. but a little runny, really flat and instead of cookies, it turned into one really big flat cookie cake. I suppose more flour will help make the cookies stand a little better and a bit more baking soda too. overall, they were pretty good.. they just needed a few minor tweeks.. :)

These were delicious! I only made them on Wednesday, but there are only 2 left in the cookie jar today (two days later). I didn't have any nuts, so I just doubled the amount of chocolate chips (I used milk chocolate chips). They turned out GREAT! And, yes, I would also bake them at 350 and cool the dough a bit before baking. Otherwise, these cookies were awesome!

Not to be a poop or anything, but I had problems with this recipe. Although it was good and all that, the amount of cookies that this recipe made was enormous. I also question the amount of butter and or flour as well. Seems to me that this recipe had been doubled and something amiss? I think that there should have been probably half of the butter and/or 1 cup of flour more. Maybe there was a type-O? But the taste was good of course, just that the cookies ran all over place and not really chewy at all.

GO, MAKE THESE RIGHT NOW! This was my first time making any type of oatmeal cookies from scratch. I followed the directions, but made a half batch and altered the recipe based on reviews to 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 1/4 tsp salt (next time I will make the full batch with 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp salt). I baked for 14 minutes at 325, let sit on the cookie sheet for 5, and then as soon as they were off the sheets, they magically disappeared! Everyone in my family LOVES these! Maybe it's a good thing I didn't make the full batch, or I would still be eating them :) OH ALSO, IF YOU ONLY HAVE TRADITIONAL NON-QUICK OATS, put them in a food processer for a few seconds and voila, instant oats!

These were great. I only had old fashioned oats but they still turned out great. Only change would be next time to reduce salt to 1/2 tsp. 
I made these again and this time I added dry cherries, chopped walnuts, white chocolate chips and regular chips. They turned out fabulous!

I always use non hydrogenated margarine. I found some dark Belgium chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate. I broke the chocolate into large chunks and tossed them in the dough. OMG! Yum! I'm definitely keeping this recipe! :D

I am adding to my original review below...
I have made these for months now as stated on the recipe with no spreading...until last week...because I over softened the butter and did not chill for five minutes the cookie dough.  For low carb version see below and sub oat flour and whole wheat flour for white flour. 
Original post
This is always something that has confused me, how can you rate a recipe when you didn't make it as it was listed?  I made this exactly like the recipe called for and they were great, friends and family loved them!  I also made them as a low carb offering using half whole wheat flour half white flour, splenda brown sugar and An all natural agave based no cal sweetner for the sugar.  Truvia or one of the others.   They are obviously different but family and friends thought they were great and the trade off was not that much.  I always put cookie dough on the sheet and then in fridge (5 min)  to set up to help with spreading I will now try all the other suggestions...but this recipe as is is my rating!

Brought these to a party and they were a hit! Took advice of others and increased flour 1/2 cup and increased baking soda to 1 tsp.--I don't think the cookies would have turned out otherwise.

an excellent oatmeal cookie recipe!  one tip that i have found to be true after having more batches of cookies than i care to admit to having "spread" or get very flat and crispy:  when it says to use "softened butter," make sure it really is softened.  i take two sticks of butter from the refrigerator and microwave them for 30 seconds.. this way they are *just starting* to melt.  and then there are no problems with the cookies spreading.  if your butter is too cold, it melts when you bake the cookie, thus you have cookies that "spread," or come out flat and crispy.
note:  the only change i had to make is to bake at 350° instead of 325°.

This is my go-to cookie recipe. They come out perfectly and are crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. I let them sit in the refrigerator for aout 1/2 an hour or else they go a bit flat. I added 2 cups chocolate( 1 white and 1 semi-sweet) chips instead of 1 cup chips and 1 walnuts. This made them so delicious! I also added less salt than it called for, about 1/4 teaspoon.

Made these tonight with some help from the reviews and my Recipe Exchange chickens. I used all brown sugar, a teaspoon of soda, omitted the nuts and added coconut and a tiny bit of cinnamon. Left the salt at 1tsp since I was using unsalted butter. I made larger cookies, so my cooking time was a bit longer. Otherwise, followed the recipe. The flavor is great, nice and chewy texture, no problems with excessive spreading or sticking. Thanks for the recipe, I'll use it again!

I have been making cookie for fifteen years and I have become very selective about which recipes I use and prefer to just wing it and create my own, however, last year I got married and recived the allrecipes cookbook for a gift and I made this cookies and my husband melted. He prefers them with butterscotch chips and no walnuts which translates roughly to 12oz of chips in stead of 8 to make up the bulk. He, and now all of his friends, love love love these cookies, I highly reccomend them. My only caution is that if you are like me and like to tweak recipes and bake times, don't. The "chewy" of these cookies is a result of the low oven temp and the sitting on the pan for the 5 extra minutes. Enjoy!!!

My grandmother actually asked me for the recipe for this one! I make this for little kids so I omit the nuts and add coconut flakes.  I also used 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 butter to cut down on the sat. fat and used 1/2 white whole wheat flour.  I'm make them all the time.

Best oatmeal cookie I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly but did have to use pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had. I used mini-chocolate chips too. My recommendations are to follow the recipe exactly; do not cut the salt since the salt/sweet contrast is what makes them good. Also use real butter and use a nonstick pan or wax paper but don't spray extra grease on. They're the best and I bake a lot of cookies. They also have a tollhouse flavor to them.

I made these cookies exactly as stated in the recipe and they were delicious.  If you are having problems with the cookies spreading, your dough has probably gotten too warm.  Try putting it in the fridge between batches.  Thanks Amy!

Very good.  Followed advice and upped the flour to 1 1/2 cups, and the baking soda to 1 teaspoon.  Kept the salt at 1 teaspoon cuz I use unsalted butter.  Also used 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavored crisco - We are not big on nuts in cookies so we subbed extra chips - the swirled with white chocolate kind - the other cup semi sweet.  Did not park in the fridge at all and had no problems with spreading issues.  About 12 minutes later perfect!  Crispy on the outside, chewy inside.

I followed a few reviewers before and made some changes also adding 1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 tsp more baking soda and substituted 1 cup butter with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening, which makes cookies more chewy and fluffy less flat.  With these changes the cookies were great, the only other thing I would add is more spice, needed some cinnamon and nutmeg.

These cookies are AWESOME.  I ahve been looking and looking for a good oatmeal cookie recipe since they are my husband's favorite.  I made about 4 dozen and they were gone in no time.  Make sure to use real butter, they are much better than if using margarine.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Being vegan, I used vegan egg replacer, but the recipe turned out excellent! They were thick, chewy, and full of good suprises. I might add a bit of cinnamon next time I make them. I also used Sucanat instead of light brown sugar.

These are absolutely to die for! If you're looking for a chewy cookie, this is the one.  I actually took recommendations from other reviews and used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c.  applesauce; also added 1/4 c. flour and 1/2 t. extra baking soda so they didn't flatten.  Just a tip... you need to make the dough-balls pretty big because they don't rise that much.  Otherwise you'll have some tiny (but yummy!) cookies. :)

I made these today.  I have Type 2 Diabetes, so I used Splenda instead of sugar and sugar-free chocolate chips.  They are A.W.E.S.O.M.E. and I highly recommend them if you are watching your sugar intake.

Due to most reviews saying the cookies spread a lot I added 1/4 extra flour. And due to people saying cookies were flat I added 1 teaspoon baking soda instead of 1/2. I like old fashion oats instead of quick oats because they are stiffer so I used 1 cup old fashion and 2 quick oats. I baked the cookies at 350 degrees because first batch came out pale. Excellent cookies I will make again with my changes.

Perfection. As stated by others, I decreased the salt to half a teaspoon and increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups. I also used half a tablespoon of baking soda. I then baked at 335 for 10 minutes. They were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. They had such a nice balanced flavor! My search for the perfect recipes ends here!

I love oatmeal cookies with chocolate chips and this recipe fits the bill.  I'm a Dietitian so I modified this recipe to make it a bit healthier without losing the yummy goodness.  I cut the butter by 1/4 C and used applesauce in it's place.  Also, I used only 3/4 C brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar.  I left out the salt like others recommended with the buttered salt and I used 3/4 C all purpose flour and 1/2C whole wheat flour in place of the full amount of flour.  I didn't change the eggs, but you can use 2 egg whites in place of 1 whole egg to cut some of the fat/cholesterol.
Anyhow, long story short....MY FAMILY LOVED THESE COOKIES and this recipe is a keeper even with the substitutions.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

It's been a few years since I made these cookies and now I can't have much sugar. I substituted the sugar and brown sugar with splenda and splenda brown sugar blend and they still turned out amazing!!!!

Okay, I think it is appropriate for me to share that I NEVER have a "cookie baking experience" turn out to my benefit. My downfall always ends up being flat, spread out cookies on the cookie sheet. As a result, they immediately go in the trash bin (not fair for me, or the cookies!). However, after reading other's reviews and making some additions to this recipe (i.e. more flour, baking soda, & oats), for the first time my cookies actually turned out! And, when I say turned out...they turned out amazing. I'm excited to share this recipe and the result of my first positive "cookie baking experience" w my friends and family. Thank you, thank you, thank you for the recipe and the great reviews!

If you hand mix and refrigerate your batter before spooning it onto your pan, the butter will harden up just a tad and create super light fluffy cookies!!

This recipe was amazing. I made quite a few changes, though, since I've started using it.
I put the cookie dough on baking paper, it prevents the cookies from spreading and burning around the edges.
I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.
I added 1/2 C of flour and didn't decrease the oats.
I took salt out of the recipe (I use salted butter...if you use unsalted, then only use 1/2 tsp salt).

I got nothing but rave reviews of these cookies. I did make the changes that other review made and glad I did. I took these to a pot luck and I couldn't take the chance of them not coming our right. They were chewy even the next day without a cover put on. I also added dried cherries to the batter omitted the nuts..mmmm good!

I enjoyed these. I made them as is, except substituted white chocolate chips for the regular chocolate chips and added a dash of cinnamon. They had chewy centers, crisp edges, and didn't spread much like others complained of. I also don't understand the reviews claiming these are too salty, I kept the salt as called for and thought it was perfect. Don't use salted butter or salted nuts and your cookie won't come out tasting overly salty!

A few people had added more flour and a few other ingredients. I followed their suggestions and ended up with more of a cake-like cookie than what I usually prefer. However, they were still gone very quickly and tasted delicious!

Also added 1/2 cup flour and cut salt o 1/2 t. Seems to be just the right amount. Did not need to refrigerate dough. If you have excessive spreading, it is likely due to overmixing or using quick cooking oats. They are basically already cooked so quickly turn to mush. I made these with old fashioned oats. They hold their shape much better and are chewier too.

These were very good. I took everyone's advice and added 1/4 cup of flour and reduced the salt a little. Next time I will also reduce the vanilla - possibly because I used real vanilla but it was very overpowering. The cookies didn't spread too much, stayed wonderfully soft, and had a good flavour. Will make again with adjustments. Thanks!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had!  I made a batch with white chocolate chip and a batch with raisins.    The cookie remains really chewy which I love.  I will definately make these again.

TO DIE FOR!i have made this twice within a week already and ready to go on my third. i was affraid of the spreading that people mentioned so i added the extra flour and baking soda and put in fridge for at least 30 min.i also put a whole bag of milk chocolate chips in and no nuts. i took one reviewers suggestion since it seemed they did some extrensive testing to bake at 335F for 12 min. the first batch i did i droped the batter onto the cookie sheet and out 8 to a sheet and baked at 335 for 12 min and they turned out to be about 2-2 1/2" diameter. which made for a 5 bite cookie :)it made 36 this size cookie. they didnt last long cause they were soooo good. The second batch i rolled them into inch balls or so( it made a two bite cookie) and have 12 to a sheet and baked them at 335 for 12min. and they second half baked them  for 11 min which made a chewer cookie. this size made about 60 or so cookies.

I did as many people suggested and adjusted to 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. I also cut the vanilla down to 1 teaspoon. And because many people said that "something" was missing, I decided to add 1-1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon (to the butter, sugar, and brown sugar mixture).   mmmm they taste good!! nice and fluffy even after being taken out of the oven for a bit. They're nice and chewy and have just the right amount of oatmeal in them. you can taste a hint, a very small hint of cinnamon, which gives it some nice extra flavor! I might add maybe 1/4 or 1/2 more chocolate chips, but it's not a big deal since these cookies are sweet enough!

Read a lot of review and settled for the suggestions made by Fervent Frugal Foodie.  I made the right decision.  They were excellent!  Here are the three small changes:  1 3/4 cup of flour, 1 tsp of baking soda and cook them at a 335 degree oven for 12 minutes.  I didn't have trouble with spreading, crumbling or any other cookie problems.  They were just perfect!

I baked for 12 minutes, and not a minute longer! They were perfect. Only thing I changed was to not use walnuts. I also refrigerated my dough for a bit because it was pretty sticky.

I followed the modifications to use 1/2 more cup of flour and cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp. I also added 1 cup of toffee bits. They were a hit at the party and office.

These were pretty good. I wasn't crazy for them and this recipe won't be something I make again. I'm more of a fan of the crisp cookie, and this was too soft for me. But the name does says CHEWY, so I should have known!

I made these last night and they taste great warm out of the oven (I like mine this way.). The only problem is that the dough was very dry is that suppose to happen. I read other reveiws and tried not to over mix the batter and added 1/2 cup more flour. The cookie was great the next morning but a little dry and crunchy. But I will make this cookie again and try not to over mix it again. Thanks for the recipe!Update*** I figured out that I was making the cookies too small and they tended to be dry but since making them bigger they taste awesome. I glad I didn't give up on this recipe.

Delicious!  I also increased the flour by 1/4 cup and baking soda by 1/2 teaspoon, and cut the salt to 1/4 tsp as recommended.  A very moist cookie, and it freezes well.  We made these on a Sunday in Lent and because we gave up sweets during the week, we froze them and then pulled a few out each Saturday night/Sunday and microwaved them (about 10 seconds/cookie).  Very good with ice-cream!

This recipe is AMAZING. I made it to simply be slightly healthier than regular chocolate chip cookies. Little did I know that these would turn out to be five times better than plain chocolate chip cookies! It's like a combination between oatmeal cookies and chocolate chip cookies. It's the basic toll-house dough with oats, and it's the perfect balance and combination. I excluded the nuts, and the recipes is just as amazing. This is now my boyfriend and mine's favorite kind of cookie that I bake!

These are pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly, and had no problems with spreading or thin cookies.  IN fact, they stayed so fat and round, I had to flatten the rest of the batch with a glass before baking.  Good way to use up some ingredients.

I've made these cookies at least 20 times since I found this recipe last summer. Absolutely great! Everyone who has had them have said that they are the best chocolate chip oatmeal cookies they've EVER had!

Just a few suggestions: Half the amount of salt. I'm not saying this as a matter of preference. 1 teaspoon is too much and ends up making them taste like salted cookies. 
The best kind of butter to use is unsalted sweet cream butter. Never make the mistake of substituting margarine for the butter or they will turn out very oily. 

Also, depending on how powerful your oven is, the baking time is between 10 - 12 minutes at 325 degrees -- no more, no less! If you let them stay for a minute over 12, they will not be as chewy.

These cookies were good. I used butter flavored shortening for half of the butter, used regular oats and switched the amounts of baking soda (1 tsp) and salt (1/2 tsp). (Even with cutting the salt, I could still taste it so I'll probably use 1/4 tsp next time!) In half of the batter, I added a big spoonful of (about 1/4 cup) peanut butter. I didn't have any problem with spreading, but maybe that's because I used regular oats and the batter was thicker? I only baked for 10 minutes; enough time to get browned around the edges but still a little gooey in the middle. Then I let them cool for 2 minutes on the sheet before removing to a rack. Both batches of cookies turned out well - nice and chewy - and I thought the addition of nuts gave it that little extra "something". Will make these again!

Wow.  This is the first batch of cookies I've ever had to throw out.  I don't know what went wrong.  I followed the recipe to a t.  After 12 minutes they really didn't look done.  I let them cool 5 minutes on the sheet as the recipe stated, and then I couldn't even get them off the cookie sheet.  I tried putting one sheet back in the oven to see if cooking longer would solve the problem, nope.

Excellent cookie!  I did add 1/2 cup more flour and upped the baking soda to 1 tsp and cut the salt down to 1/2.  I threw in extra chocolate chips also.  I was hessitant about nuts and didn't put nuts in until last batch.  Added some peacans.  That was the best of the lot.  Made about 4 dozen delicious cookies.

THESE ARE THE BEST!  My hubby is not much of a dessert fan but he LOVES these, and so does everybody else! Mine have a slightly crisp outer shell, and are chewy inside, they bake up nice and fat!  I cut down on the salt, used regular rolled oats ( I don't like quick-cook oats for baking) and  I used a mixture of 1/2 choc chips and 1/2 chopped toffee bars, like Skor or Heath.  This gives them a nice buttery, carmel-y richness, enhancing the depth of flavors in the cookie.  I used a large ice cream scoop to measure them out and bake them at 350 degrees for about 12-14 minutes.  PERFECT EVERY TIME!

Mmmkay, you don't need to add more ingredients and you don't have to freeze the dough for two hours. I would suggest putting in 1/4-1/2 cup more oats. (Yummy!)

Obviously you have to take in the climate and humidity, so perhaps the woman who added more flour lives in a humid climate and the one who suggested freezing it for two hours lives in an overly hot climate. If either of those apply to you, please do use thier suggestions!

With that said, if you just use an ice cream scooper to scoop your dough onto the sheet, it might help with the shaping. Also, if you worry about speading, just 10 to 15 minutes in the freezer does it just fine. 

Hope this helps!

Made these yesterday and brought them to work ( I work at a police department in New York) to test the recipe out on the connisseurs of cookies (the cops) to see if they would be worth making for my boyfriend.  They loved them. I received several marriage proposals, and heard several times that they were the best cookies ever.  The whole batch was gone in 10 minutes.  Other goodies brought in by others usually last at least several hours.  I followed the recommendations of several posters and upped the flour by 1/2 cup, upped the baking soda to 1tsp and reduced the salt.  Great recipe Dr. Amy, can't wait to make them for my boyfriend.  I know he'll love them.

My family loves these cookies.  We usually make a double batch and roll 1/2 of batter into a log, wrap in plastic and foil and freeze.  Then we have our own slice and bake cookies.  Try adding pecans too, they're great!

very disappointing.  These were NOT chewy, didnt have enough chocolate chips. In the past I have used Betty Crocker oatmeal chocolate chip cookie mix with good results. This recipe definitely was not worth the time or effort. I am going back to the mix!

The taste was GREAT! But as other reviewers have mentioned they turn out a bit flat if you do not make the following ADJUSTMENTS: 1/4 cup more flour, 1/2 teaspoon more baking soda, and 1/4 tsp less salt, and then freeze/chill the dough for about an hour before you place them on your cookie sheets.

Man! These cookies are D-licious. Underbake them just a bit to keep them extra chewy.

This is a bad recipe.  The cookies stuck to the baking sheet, and then they were hard, airy and breaking apart the moment you touched/bit into them.  - make at your own risk!

Fantastic! I always had failed at Chocolate Chip Cookies and somehow I succeeded here! My hubby LOVED them! 
A few things I did(recipe still tasted great, for those of you who are health-conscious out there)

-used splenda brown sugar blend to sub for brown sugar
-used light butter and melted it prior to creaming it with the sugar reccommended(I find that I tend to lose a lot of butter when I try to just let it out and soften)
-used splenda sugar blend for baking to sub for white sugar
-used less nuts than recipe reccommended 
-added a little bit of coconut

RECIPE was great, hubby loved it!

I made these last night and I'm still eating them! I did do what other reviewers said and only added 1/2 tsp.salt. I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon (I love Mexican chocolate)and a whole bag (2 cups?)of semi sweet choc. chips instead of the 1 cup that is called for. Yummy- perfect with a cup of milk. With these around I get my whole days calcium b/c I'm always eating them and drinking milk!!!

UPDATE 12/2006: I just made 2 batches of this to give away for xmas treats. I forgot I made these last year and put in the 1 tspn.of salt. My first batch was made with Guittard semi-sweet chips (I guess a good brand made with real vanilla and chocolate). I baked these at 12 minutes and they came out GREAT. My second batch I used a generic brand chip (made with artificial vanilla!) and overcooked the cookies in my first pan by 3 minutes. HORRIBLE!!! They were way too salty. Now I know why some reviews said this cookie is salty- don't overcook it AND use a good chip. Even without overcooking, my second batch made with the generic choc. chips weren't as good as my first batch and too salty for my taste. What a waste b/c now I can't wrap these up as presents! It pays to get good ingredients!

I've made these cookies twice now and they usually turn out great. There's a fine line between cooking them just right and over-doing it, but if done correctly they're nice and crisp and sweet around the outside and when you get to the middle where all the chewiness and chocolate is...yum. I like them better without the walnuts and per the advice of the other reviewers I made them with just a dash of salt. The oats are essential for the texture, so don't forget them!

These were as excellent as advertised though after reading some of the other reviews I, too, halved the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and they had the perfect saltiness. Maybe the 1 teaspoon is if you are using unsalted butter.  The other change I made was chopping the 3 cups of oats in my minichop so my kids would be more likely to eat them (a healthier alternative to reg. choc chips) and they did!!!

This recipe was fabulous!!!!  My husband and I LOVE these cookies.  I used the suggestion from the other reviews of using 1 1/2 c flour 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp of salt and the cookies came out awsome.  They are chewy and delicious. Defenitely satisfied my sweet tooth.  They are a must try!!!

Very good choc chip cookie.  I made the same adjustments as others did by adding the extra flour and baking soda.  They needing cooling on cookie sheet about 3 minutes before removing to wire rack.  Ungreased pan made removal of cookies difficult.  I used parchment paper on the remainder of the pans.   A definite keeper recipe.

I made several cookies from this site recently. Everyone went nuts over this recipe. I wouldn't change a thing; however, the batter I refrigerated for few days turned out the best.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Yum! These were the first oatmeal cookies I've ever made, so I only made
half a batch to give it a try, and I regret not having made more. They were
gone so quickly at the Polish 3rd May constitution' barbeque that I went to.
The amount of flour was perfect and they did not come out flat at all, contrary 
to what others have written.. Will definitely make them again!

Came out great.  Easy to make.  I love the combination of oatmeal and chocolate chips, and this recipe makes it easy.  I think I stirred it a lot more than the recipe says, because I used a Kitchenaid mixer and left it stirring while preparing the dry ingredients.  Kept using a spatula to clean the sides, too.

I made these cookies as written with the exception of the nuts. Several people made the comment that they were too salty. Next time I will reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. Other than that, these were awesome! I did have to bake mine longer than 12 minutes but I just kept checking on them till they were done to my satisfaction. I think I make bigger cookies than the poster.

Wonderful recipe!  My family is Gluten Free so I subbed out regular flour with Robin Hood GF flour and added 1tsp of Xantham Gum.  Cooked for 17min at 325 degrees.  Yummy!

Wow, what a fantastic cookie!  I followed what other reviewers suggested and added a 1/2 cup of flour and an extra 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  Before I add the dry ingredients to the wet, I always whisk or sift them together.  I also made sure to stir until combined and no more.  They were all baked at the recommended temperature for 12 minutes, no more no less, and cooled for 5 minutes on the pan (don't worry if they look too soft, they'll get more chewy while cooling on the pan).  The first batch were a bit flat, though the subsquent batches that had a chance to cool in the fridge kept their rounded shape a bit better - both looked and tasted great either way, so don't necessarily worry about chilling your dough.  The cookies were slightly brown on the bottom and soft in the middle with a perfect chewy factor.  Awesome recipe.

Very good cookie , but needed some tweaks as other reviewers have mentioned. I used 1 c unsalted butter so I did need to use 1/2 tsp salt, increased baking soda to 1 tsp, increased flour to 1 3/4 c whole wheat flour.  I creamed butter and sugar until good and fluffy then added eggs and vanilla, then flour, salt, and baking soda. Oats 3 c, walnuts 1 c and chocolate chips 3/4 c, can be folded in or mixed on low briefly.  I also added 3/4 c craisins because my family loves them.  I refrigerated  the dough for 30 min and baked at 335 for 12 min. This produced a nice lofty soft cookie.  I have made the above revised version of this recipe many times with great success. The only problem is that the cookies disappear too quick. :-)

These were excelllent, but I'm giving them only four stars because you do need to follow other reviews. 
1) Add 1/2 c. flour
2) Triple the baking soda
3) Halve the salt

I also suggest just baking until the edges are done and let the middles finish once you remove from the oven- that will leave you with a chewy cookie!

Good cookie, but too salty.  And, that was after I cut the salt back to 3/4 tsp.  I would make these again, but only use a scant 1/2 teaspoon salt.  I did love the fact that they were thick and chewy though!

I followed the suggestions of others and increased the flour, soda, and oats by 1/2 cup. I also only used 1/4 t salt since I always use margarine.  Two reasons I noticed for the cookie spreading too much in my first batch was not letting it chill long enough and not enough oats. A trick I learned several years ago is to only bake one sheet at a time and once you transfer the cookies put the sheet in the freezer for a minute. This will keep the dough from spreading before it gets in the oven. The taste and texture is perfect!

Good cookies...but flour amounts really depend on conditions.   I read a ton of reviews and followed others advice to up the flour by 1/2 C and baking sodaby 1/2 tsp.  I really wish I hadn't.  The cookies would have been perfect without it.  As they are they taste nice but are like balls of cookie and didn't spread at all.  So maker beware when upping flour.

These were great - I did add the extra 1/2 cup flour and decrease salt to 1/2 tsp - I also added about another 1/4-1/2 cup chocolate chips. :) I did the first 2 dozen drop style but did the last of them rolled in my hands and flattened a little to get the shape I was looking for. They are very good! The flavor and texture are really nice, and they definitely hit the spot with a big glass of milk!

These turned out perfectly and were incredibly easy.  Really, really good. I didn't change a thing.  I liked the slight hint of salt in the flavor and the texture was excellent.  Don't overmix and err on the side of under-baking.  They'll still look wet on the top when they're finished, and just a little brown on the edges.

Wow!! I think that is up there with the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies i have ever had!! I made some minor adjustments to it however. I cut the salt to 1/2 just as people recommended. I used milk chocolate chips instead of the semisweet and I baked the cookies for 13 minutes instead of 12 because they came out a little too doughy at 12 but perfect at 13!! Great Recipe! I love it and at the same time they are too good and i couldn't stop eating them!

Made these cookies while I made dinner last night and shared with my mother-in-law, sister, and coworkers.  They were enjoyed by all.  I only had about a half cup of chocolate chips left in the cupboard so I also threw in some white choc chips and peanut butter chips.  That was the only change I made.   I watched them bake and noticed the bottom edges browning so I ended up taking them out of the oven before they looked done on top.  But that ended up being perfect timing.  Not too much spread and not crisp.  Just soft and chewy and perfect.

Cookies are great! But I did substitute a few things....
put in 2 cups of flour instead of what it say and also 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla and 1 extra egg and since I'm divaticula and cannot have nuts I put raisins in along with some butterscotch morsels..added another teaspoon of baking soda...took out the salt altogether and...remember the commercial "everythings better with blue bonnet on it" So I used Blue bonnet margarine which already has plenty salt in it. I also added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and some nutmeg too...chewy and delicious! ... Oh by the way I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown sugar and sugar substitute instead of real sugar...still delicious!

Really great cookie! I used others suggestions by adding an additional 1/2 cup flour, additional 1/2 tablespoon baking soda, and decreasing the salt to 1/2 tsp. I baked them for 11 min and it was perfect i allowed them to cool for one minute before placing them on the cooling rack this recipe made about 40 cookies so i was really happy about that! I will be making these again!

This was a favorite with my family and neighbors! I did make the modifications recommended, increasing the flour to 1 and 3/4 C, halving the salt, and increasing cooking temp to 335. Great with some white chocolate chips mixed in too!

Perfect recipe. Added a bit more oatmeal than required and some cinnamon. Walnuts are a great addition as well, as would pretty much any nut or chocolate.

These were great! Only changes I made: I added about 3/4 c butterscotch chips and 3/4 cup chocolate chips, and I left out the nuts (per my kids' request). I also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup Smart Balance Lite. I used 1 egg and 1/4 C Egg beaters. I also found I needed to bake them 14 minutes. They are awesome. Thanks!

I added a dash of nutmeg and some cinnamon.  I also doubled the amount of vanilla since i had vanilla flavoring instead of extract.  The cookies are soft but the oats keep a hardness from the unbalanced ratio of oats to dough.

Perfect cookie - tastes just like Potbelly's, which I love. I followed others suggestions and added 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 tbsp more baking soda, also cut salt down to 1/2 tsp. Froze the dough as recommended - however, think it through - form the dough into balls before freezing...quite difficult to do after :) Ended up with perfect cookies - my sister and her fiance just ate a dozen between them!

Really good.  Cookies came out flat.  Next time I will mix them a little less, add a little more flour and chill the dough for 30 min before cooking as the other reviews suggested.  They didnt seem to salty to me. I used margarine.

Great cookies! I made these with cinnamon chips instead of chocolate and they were great. Dough freezes well too--I made them into balls and froze them on a cookie sheet, then transferred them to a freezer bag. Cook them right from the freezer--just for a couple of extra minutes.

This is the cookie recipe I've been looking for my whole life!  I've made this recipe three times now.  The first two times the cookies came out soft and chewy and very tasty.  I did take the advice of some reviews and added a 1/2 cup more flour, doubled the baking soda, and decreased the salt by half.  I also placed the batter in the fridge for 30 mins before baking to decrease spreading/flat cookies.  The 3rd time I followed the recipe exactly without the modification and the result...disappointment.  The cookies spread (even though I placed the batter in the fridge for 1/2 hr).  They weren't the same cookies...they weren't as good.  As a result, I will continue to bake them with the modifications.  Follow the modifications and these are Wonderful cookies!  Everyone who tried them thought so too and consequently they disappeared in no time, and left friends asking when I plan on making more :)

Really good, quick and easy. I add in 1/2 C shredded coconut and instead of chocolate chips I just coarsely cut up a chocolate bar. Drop the batter onto cookie sheets then put in the fridge for an hour - they'll hold their shape a lot better.

I really wanted these cookies to be amazing, but they actually turned out somewhat tasteless and cakey. I split the difference on the extra flour that many of the other reviewers recommended (extra 1/4 cup), did the whole 1 tsp of baking soda, some salt, but otherwise followed the recipe. I chilled the dough for aprox 20 minutes and had no problems with spreading (the cakey texture was quite the opposite). I probably won't make these again, but if I did I would add something for flavor- maybe peanut butter- and the original amount of flour. The consistency also masked the texture of the oats.

Great basic recipe in no time at all! I only had 2 cups of oats and I just went with it... they didn't turn out beautiful, but they have a great lacy texture that just melts in your mouth and the brown sugar caramelizes. YUM!

Excellent recipe!  I substituted 1 cup of butterscotch chips for the chopped walnuts and they turned out great.  Also, I take them off of the pan almost immediately, taking care to remove them carefully with a flexible spatula...less sticking that way.  Will definitely make these again!

good cookies- taste like old fashioned oatmeal cookies :). Followed advice of others and increased flour and baking soda. I also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder and had no trouble with spreading.

Delicious cookies, my family went nuts for them.  I made the mistake of using half butter/half shortening to keep the cookies from being flat, but the shortening affected the flavor somewhat. Everyone still loved them, but next time I will stick with butter and just add more flour.

These were delish!! I substituted whole wheat flour and used all brown sugar instead of brown and white sugar, and they turned out wonderful and not too sweet.  Probably a little healthier too :-)

Great Cookies! Perfectly Chewy baking at 350-375 for exactly 11 minutes. I also added raisins and extra oatmeal, but followed the recipe. Can't wait to make these again!

YUM!!! These were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I did not have any problem w/ speading or flat cookies. Actually, they didn't spread at all and I did not refrigerate the dough before baking. Didn't feel like waiting. I did take the advice of others and made a few small changes. Increased flour to 1 3/4c, baking soda to 1 tsp, and brown sugar to 1 1/4c. I cut out the white sugar and nuts. Added cinnamon. I made half w/ chocolate chips and half w/ raisins. I liked the raisins best but both VERY YUMMY!

Very good recipe, I've added extra chocolate chips instead of nuts, and used 1/4 c of bread flour instead of all purpose flour.   Butter can be reduced, I found that if you half the butter and just add an egg white instead, it turns out wonderfully.

These cookies are the best thing in the world as long as you make them right and cut the salt way down (1/8 teaspoon), add 1/2 C more flour and 1/2 Tablespoon more baking soda!  Make sure to barely mix the dry ingredients to the wet and they will be nice and fluffy!  Everyone loves these!

GREAT recipe, but needed tweaking. Too much butter=flat cookies. My changes: Addl 1/2 flour AND 1/4 cup oats. Double the baking soda to 1 tsp. Double the vanilla to 4 tsp. Used butterscotch chips instead of walnuts. Mix until ingredients are barely combined. Baked at 325 for 11 minutes in an electric oven. The cookies were thick, chewy, with a lightly browned crust and moist insides...so good!

A very delicious cookie! My whole family loved this recipe. I followed the few adjustments, such as adding 1/2 cup more flour and increasing Baking Soda to 1 teaspoon. I used regular stick butter so I omitted the salt all together. I added about a 1/4 cup more chocolate chips (cause i love chocolate) and added Almond Pieces, instead of chopped Walnuts (Just something about the flavor of chocolate and almonds, it does something for me ^_^). I set my oven to 335 F and the times varied cause I made my cookies a tad bit bigger. Times were no less than 14 mins and no more than 17 mins. I just kept a close eye on them until they were a very light golden brown on the edges and tops. They came out chewy and moist, Perfect, absolutely PERFECT :D Again, Delicious Cookies!

I LOVE THIS RECEPIE!!!  And so does EVERYONE I give these awesome Chewy Cookies.  I have tried soooo many cookie reciepies and this is a keeper!  These cookies resemble those pricey cookies you will find in the bakery section at you local foodchain... but the best part is that you will spend wayyy less making them and yeald 3 dozen nice sized cookies.   I wouldnt recemend freezing these ones, they loose the chewyness after frozen.  Make sure if you make these awesome cookies you watch them in the oven and not let them get too brown..a nice light brown is perfect.  Thanks for the recepie!!!

Tone down the salt a little bit.  There's plenty!  Next time try the 1/2 butter, 1/2 applesauce route.

I decided to try this recipe after seeing all the amazing reviews, but was admittedly a little nervous of the few bad ones. I have to jump on the bandwagon and say that this is by far the best chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried in a long time. I stayed almost completely true to how it's written, though I did omit the walnuts and add a dash of cinnamon. I found that cooking for 13-14 minutes and leaving on the sheet for 3-4 minutes after removing from the oven provided the most ideal crunchy-on-the-inside but soft-on-the-inside texture. I highly recommend giving these a try.

Really yummy cookie! I followed other reviewers' suggestions regarding the extra oats, flour and baking soda, and reducing the amt of salt. I also omitted the walnuts and used mini chocolate chips.  I tried baking a batch after refrigerating the dough for about an hour vs. a batch of room temperature dough. I must say the refrigerated dough held its shape better and didn't turn out as flat as the room temp. version. I also increased the bake time to 14 min. at 325 deg which resulted in good edges but still chewy centers. This was a hit with my kids and their friends so this is a keeper for me! Thank you!

Same with everyone else, I upped the flour to 1 3/4 c, baking soda to 1 tsp, and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. When it's first out of the oven, it looks uncooked. Don't be fooled! When I roll my dough into balls they form a fuller cookie.

These are my new favorite cookies!  Thanks so much for the recipe.    Here are the modifications I made:  * eliminate salt if using salted butter  * use 1.5 cups flour  * use 1 tsp baking soda  * They come out nice and chewy with 2 cups oats; they are crunchier with 3 cups oats  * I used 2 cups of chocolate instead of one (1 cup milk chocolate chips, 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, 1/2 cup Heath bar chips)  * I roll them into balls and/or chill them for 2 hours before baking to prevent spreading.  Best cookies ever!  -- Laura

Well, these were ok.  Hubby liked them much more then I did.  I thought they were a little bland and almost cakelike.  I think it was missing something.... maybe cinnimon?  Will try again.

I have been making this recipe for years now, and it is a favorite.  It is the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I use.  The only changes I have made are to use half butter and half butter flavored shortening.  In my humid climate, it seems to make the cookies hold up a little better. I play with this recipe all of the time - sometimes using half white flour and half wheat, sometimes substituting white chocolate chips and Craisins for the chocolate chips.  I have added coconut and macadamia nuts, and even chopped up extra dark chocolate and added it (that was a favorite!). Truly - there is no way to go wrong with this recipe!!

first off, if anyone gave this recipe a bad review, they obviously messed something up. secondly, I have modified this recipe into my ultimate cookie, which I have guarded for going on 5 years now. this is a great recipe to start from. (hint: try substituting almond extract for vanilla extract)

This is better than the Quaker recipe, especially if you follow the tips from others. Increasing the flour and baking powder make the cookies soft and chewy. I use 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup dried cranberries. I also added some cinnamon and cloves as I like a spice oatmeal cookie. Next time I will increase salt to 1 teaspoon to counter the sweetness of the white chocolate. They are nice and soft though. I will use this recipe all the time now.

These are great little guys! Yum! As you can see from the photo, modifications to the add-ins, including: PB chips, cinnamon chips, white chocolate chips, and golden raisins. The only other modification came up as the first batch was flat... ***Save yourself the trouble: add the extra flour, I ended up adding in the extra 1/2 cup and it made the difference.

Great recipe! As others did, increased flour- to just shy of 1-1/2 cups. Also increased the baking soda to 1 tsp. I used a full bag of chocolate chips (2 cups) in addition to the pecans. I have made this recipe a few times, and this was the best modification. The result... YUMMY, chewy, chocolaty, crunchy cookies!!!

These cookies are absolutely wonderful... I used mini m&m's instead of chocolate chips (since I didn't have any) and also added shredded coconut. Other than that I did not make any alterations to the recipe. I baked my cookies for about 15 - 16 minutes and they were nicely browned and crunchy. Excellent! I will definitely be offering to make these for the next party I am invited two. Two thumbs up to the chef!

I made these when I was trying to get rid of some instant oatmeal that I had for a while and they turned out FABULOUS!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the flour by 1/2 cup, increased the baking soda by 1/2 Tablespoon, and cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon.  I also used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips.  These were gone by the end of the day!

Some of mine came out a little flat the first time, as others have mentioned.  I refrigerated the dough for about a half hour and made sure not to over-beat the next time around and these fluffy cookies were YUM.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe except I didn't have walnuts and I really liked these cookies. I made these again and I followed some reviewers suggestions to add flour and baking soda and use less salt.  Again I don't have walnuts but these cookies turned out more like balls and were very floury and thick. I much preferred the original recipe.

Finally a basic Oatmeal cookie recipe that turns out chewy & moist and not flat. I followed the tips on refrigerating the dough for a couple of hours before baking. Instead of 1 1/4 cup of white flour I used 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup of oat flour. I also added 2 tbsp of flax seed flour, an extra 1/4 of oats and omitted the nuts adding raisins instead. Mixed with my kitchen aid mixer and scooped with a cookie dough scooper. It made perfect little cookies that didn't spread. Thanks so much for my new standard Oatmeal cookie. Oh...i also deleted all nuts, used 1/2 cup choc chips and 1/2 cup of raisins. I also strongly recommend only half the salt.

Melba here, 
I am enjoying one of these chewy cookies AS WE SPEAK! They are a little too warm for me to get the full flavor, but I just couldn't contain myself! I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and a touch more baking soda and the consistency is just peachy. A real winner. However, I urge you to use old fashioned oats and not rolled oats. 

Best, 
Melba

ps: be sure to check out Grandma Pat's Casserole recipe! its a 5 star success!

This recipe holds true to it's name CHEWY! I used one of my foodies advice and used all brown sugar and 1 tsp baking soda. My hubby requested that I make oatmeal cookies and me not being an oatmeal lover tried this. He loved them!!! I will be making these again. Also don't bake them any longer then it says..that gives it the chewy texture.

I followed this recipe exactly, only omitting the walnuts, and the cookies were still soft and chewy the next day! For those who don't have the same good luck, try my grandmother's trick. Store "hard" cookies in a sealed container, along with a piece of fresh bread, several hours or overnight. When you remove the bread, the cookies will have absorbed its moisture and be soft again. Voila!

I thought this recipe was awful. I followed the recipe exactly, no substitutions.  I had a hard time getting them off the cookie sheet - they were falling apart since the dough was sortof runny and the finished product didn't seem to "stick" together in cookie form. I ended up with chewy cookie pieces/crumbles (which I suppose were tasty). Waste of time and energy.

I omitted the nuts and added a cup of extra chocolate chips instead. My cookies were great -- but they were 'soft' rather than 'chewy'. Still a great cookie though.

I increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups, but kept the baking soda at 1/2 t, as I hate cakey cookies. The cookies were crispy and chewy and very good, except for a slight aftertaste that I think was due to too much vanilla.  Next time I will reduce the vanilla to 1 t.  My son, who won't go near anything with oatmeal in it, gobbled them up!

These are my new favorite cookie! I did make the alterations the other reviewers suggested... more flour & baking soda, less salt.  However, I just couldn't justify making an oatmeal cookie without adding spices so I also added 1 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/8 t clove, 1/8 t nutmeg, and 1/8 t ginger. These cookies were in no way flat and they stayed together very well while remaining chewey. Thanks for the recipe!

For a recipie that has over 760 ratings and almost 5 stars I was shocked at how poor these cookies turned out!  The taste was pretty bland, no spices to add warmth to the flavor and the cookies just crumbled into a pile of pieces.  Definetly not something you would want to give away - how embarassing to have the cookie just fall apart when you pick it up!  I refridgerated the last batch before cooking after reading some reviews and trying to save this sad dough.  These cookies turned out okay, but if this is required to make the cookies stay together, then it needs to be part of the recipe.  Enough complaining, I did not like them and will not make again.

Delicious!  This is the first cookie recipe I've made that I was happy with the consistency.  I did alter the recipe slightly at the suggestion of other posts.  I increased the flour by 1/2 cup, increased the baking soda by 1/2 tablespoon, and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp.  And, since we aren't fans of nuts, I replaced the cup of walnuts with an extra cup of chocolate chips.  Marvelous!!  I've also tried the recipe with adding some coconut.  This is a fantastic recipe and easy to adjust to different tastes.

P-E-R-F-E-C-T!! I didn't change a thing and they came out great!  I read other reviews about them coming out flat but not mine!  They were thick, chunky and moist.  My kids and hubby devoured 'em!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good!  I also increased the flour and baking soda.  Flour to 1 1/2 cups and baking soda to 1 tsp.  I also decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp, all modifications per other reviewers.  They were chewy, but not flat this way.

OMG!!  This recipe is pretty much perfect.  I put in a whole bag of chocolate chips.  I added about 1/4-1/3 cup flour and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and cut the salt in half--as others have suggested.  I had NOOOO problems with the cookies flattening!  Don't be scared away by the negative reviews!

These turned out great! Excellent chewiness, just right amount of sweetness. I took advice of other cooks and I added 1/4 c. flour, 1/2 tsp. baking soda, decreased salt by 1/2 tsp. I didn't use chocolate, I used butterscotch chips in half this recipe, and dried cranberries & walnuts in the other half. Delicious and a keeper for sure. Thanks!

Great Cookie Recipe....I modified it just a bit though I used 1 cup of Buterscotch Chips and 1 cup of Chocolate chips.  I used old fashioned oats in place of the quick cookie type.

YUM! They were soft and chewy, just like the name says :>) I like how they didn't get all flat and crispy like most of the oatmeal recipes i have tried.  They really don't look done when you take them out of the oven, but after they sit for a few minutes they firm up.  The dough was really good to eat too :>)

I love my old Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies, but this recipe intrigued me.

Wow!! What have I been missing?-These!  These are FANTASTIC! Thank you DR AMY!

They didn't spread and were perfect.  I used my large metal baking sheets with unbleached parchment paper.  I used the Pampered Chef small scoop and baked at 325 for 11 minutes (I let the oven come to temperature and then let it sit for an additional 10 minutes - for even baking... NEVER put in the first batch of cookies as soon as the oven beeps)

I tweaked it with some suggestions previously mentioned and added some of my own:
I do not let the butter soften.  I leave it out for 10-15 minutes, let it remain firm and whip it for 6-8 minutes.  The heat from the beaters is more than enough to make it light and creamy- I find it is less greasy this way.
I used 1 1/2 C. flour, 1 t. baking soda, 2 shakes of the salt shaker and 3 1/2 cup of ground quick oats (I used my cuisinart and grinded the oats to a gritty powder).
I did not use nuts- added extra handfuls of chocolate chips.  I only had the semi-sweet on hand, I think milk chocolate would make these even better

My son (who likes all of my cookies loved these).. his best friend- one of the pickiest 4 year olds I have ever met (is there another 4 year old who doesn't like pizza?? I don't think so!) also loved them.  That is a testiment in itself!

I will definately make these over and over!  My new favorite, hand-me-down recipe!

These cookies are very, very good.  I substituted chocolate covered raisins for the chips and left out the walnuts.  I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 Crisco, which makes them softer and chewier.  Great recipe!

The best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.  I'm not a big oatmeal cookie fan, but these are fantastic.  I made them just as the recipe instructed, except I left out the walnuts, since I didn't have any on hand.  These are great!  Make some for your dad or husband.  :)

These were so good, I did an entire post on them at my food blog.

HONESTLY?  Worst oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever tried.  I have a great recipe, but this one had such high marks that I thought I'd try it.  NO GOOD!  I guess if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  This didn't have nearly enough flour...especially for the ratio of oats.  Never again will I follow this recipe!

wasn't what i expected.  i followed the recipie exactly and i wasn't too impressed.  it was too salty and too much oatmeal.  if i make this recipie again i would reduce the amount of salt and reduce the amount of oatmeal.

Great recipe! I can't get enough of this cookie.  It was simple to make and quick and easy.  I used raisins instead of chocolate chips, made sure to plump them up in hot water first.  I also added 1/4 cup more flour and a dash of cinnamon.  Instead of using quick cooking oats I used rolled oats, it's what I had on hand and the cookies are still great and chewy!! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

The only change I made to this recipe was replaced nuts with extra chips... These cookies were way too dry; it takes almost like a no-bake cookiw (which is not my personal preference).

I'd give this 10++ stars if I could. I just KNEW I screwed this up...had the wrong oats (not the quick cooking) forgot to add in the eggs and vanilla till after everything else was mixed (too many things going on at once, lol) and after all of that - these cookies were still the BEST that I have ever had. I will make and share these cookies over and over again. Thanks for a wonderful new favorite recipe!!!!!

I took these to work and everyone went nuts over them! They weren't very chewy and I am going to play with the recipie a little to make them stay softer longer. Overall, they were FANTASTIC! Very easy to make! Thanks for sharing. They do take a little longer to bake and watch the salt. I took everyone's advice and cut the salt to 1/2 a tsp. Next time I would cut it to 1/4 tsp.

This is the recipe I have been searching years for.  They have the perfect brown sugar flavor, I couldn't stay out of the raw dough.  I lined my cookie sheets with foil and just a light spray for easy clean up. I used just 1/4 tsp. of salt and   baked them for 15 minutes.PERFECT!

MMMMMM!!! These are so good! I doubled the amount of chocolate chips and skipped the walnuts since we didn't have any.  They were just a little salty though, so next time I make these, I'll only use 1/2 tsp. salt. I did forget to add the vanilla, but we didn't miss it, unless the missing vanilla accentuated the saltiness.  The texture of these cookies is perfect, just the right amount of chewiness. Be sure to use an ungreased baking sheet...I missed that important little piece of information and my first batch came out thin when I sprayed the sheet with cooking spray.

These cookies were excellent. I too added more chocolate chips and cut the oats by 1/4 of a cup. I did not bake mine too dark (like they show on the pictures) and turned out crispy and chewy. One thing my husband likes is to put them in the microwave for 20 seconds before eating them; this makes them extra soft and chewy and with the chocolate chips soft and runny. My 11 year old son told me tonight, "Mom, you are becoming a dessert expert!", after trying them. Thumbs up!

...My very first five-star rating!  TA-DA!!  Well done, Amy.  I used multigrain flakes, all brown sugar (makes cookies chewier, and gives more flavor), chunks of Ghirardelli white chocolate, dried sour cherries and cranberries, and toasted macadamia nuts.  The Missus likes her cookies more "chunk" than "cookie"... and chewy in the middle, with crispy edges.  I made large cookies (maybe 1/4 C. or so of batter), and baked them at 350 for 10 (?) minutes.  Yum, yum, yum... I think these are the new "taking cookies to the bike race" offering.  So many opportunities... peanut butter and milk chocolate hunks; dried cranberries, sour cherries, apricots, allspice, and hazelnuts; almond butter and shaved dark chocolate!!!  My, my...

I use to go crazy over Mrs. Field's choc. chip oatmeal cookies but NOT ANYMORE. I have tried and rated several cookies here 5 starts but this one stands out. Flavor, texture and appearance not to mention the aroma. It has it all.

One word - Yumm-o!!!  I used the modifications that others suggested with an extra 1/4 cup of flour and half tsp of salt and 1 tsp of baking soda and they were awesome.  I even had to substitute some extra white sugar because I was short on brown and they were still the best oatmeal cookies ever.  The best part was They made about 4 1/2 dozen which is a whole dozen more than the recipe said.  Thanks Dr Amy!!

I followed others suggestions and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp, increased flour by 1/2 cup and I added 1 tsp. baking powder.  I didn't have enough chocolate chips in the house, so I threw in some butterscotch chips also.  Everyone loved them - some said they were the best cookies they've ever had.  Thank you, Dr Amy!

I am a poor poor college student and love to cook a little too much.  I didn't want to bother my mother to ask  for her recipe for oatmeal cookies (wich I can never seem to get right), and decided to try this one. OOOO boy! Now I can brag that I can make better oatmeal cookies than her! Very easy to make, turned out perfectly-I'm trying my hardest to stop my dorm neighbors from stealing them. I have to lock the door and/or carry the bowl of cookies with me if I leave the room and people are in it; Otherwise I would never get to eat them! I added a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon and a few more chocolate chips-they were incredible!!

I made this recipe for my co-workers and friends and they loved it!  I did make the modifications as suggested by another baker... 1/4c more flour, 1/2 tspn more baking soda and 1/2 tspn less salt.  Also, don't overcook!  To keep them especially fresh for a few days, I wrapped each one in saran wrap and it did the trick!  One of my friends ate 12 of these cookies the first day!  Yummy!!

This sounded like the perfect oatmeal cookie recipe, but they were a bit of a disappointment.  I thought they were dry and not that chewy.  I don't think I'll be making these again.

A perfect blend of two of my all-time favorite cookies.  I used a small cookie scoop to put them on the tray so the job went really fast.  They were a little small, more like bite size, but each one is really very filling.

I finally found a cookie recipe I truly LOVE and enjoy making!  Easy and delicious!  I didn't have any nuts so I just doubled the amount of chocolate chips - YUMMY!  Baked for 13 minutes instead of 12 and they came out PERFECT!  Chewy and not cakey!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were the best!  MY son went back for 2 more cookies.  He would have grabbed more if I hadn't hidden them.  We baked these for a camping trip on Thursday, and they were gone before we left Friday morning.  HA!

Awesome cookies! I also baked them at 350 for about 11 minutes.  I put in chocolate peanut-butter chips and pecans.

Really good recipe. I didn't have walnuts, so I left those out and used 1.5 cups of chocolate chips instead. Other people said the cookies spread too much, so I refrigerated the dough for 15 minutes before baking and put it back in the fridge between batches. Cookies came out perfectly and are still nice and soft 2 days later.

I browned the butter first. Gives it a much more caramel-like taste. I also chilled it overnight to help the oils in the butter and chocolate mesh into the dough. Richer flavour. Yum,

This recipe was amazing!!! Was a little skeptical to make them after reading the bad reviews but honestly, I did not change a thing and these were so plump and chewy and delish! The only thing I can offer to those who said they were flat, don't over mix and chill the dough a bit before baking. I guarantee you they will be perfection!

The cookies were all right. They looked appealing out of the oven. I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of cutting back the salt, as I used salted butter. The texture was hearty and chewy. But the taste was bland, making them an overall disappointment. I waited to try them again the following day, as some cookies need a little time to develop their best flavor. Still felt the same. Sorry to have to say, in all honesty, just not worth the time, electricity or calories.

I made these cookies yesterday and we absolutely loved them!! They came out very moist! I think this recipe was perfect. I didn't have "quick oats" and used old fashioned oatmeal instead. They still came out great! My husband just loves them! Problem is....so do I. I will be using this recipe ALL the time from now on. Maybe use raisins, or craisins, or other dry fruit, but staying close to this recipe. Thank you!!

I am allergic to eggs so instead of egg I added 1/4 cup of water and a splash of oil.  
I also followed other suggestions to add 1/2 cup more flour and used 1tsp baking soda.
I rolled the dough into balls and slightly flatten them and had to bake them for about 15mins.
Turned out great.

I thought this recipe was great as is. I didn't have a problem with flat cookies like some of the others, however i did stir as little as possible.

The only issue I had was that I had to increase the temp to 340F and the time to 15 minutes. But we just bought a new house and this could be an issue with the ovens that I am still not too familiar with. This is only my second time baking in them! I only mention it in case I'm not the only one...

Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are a favourite to all. Except those who don't like oatmeal cookies, and in that case I say, "More for me!" I've made them as the recipe says and they are great, just if you use salted butter don't add the extra salt as it calls for in the recipe or they'll be a little too salty. One substitution I've made which turns out awesome is I put coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, they are even better! Which I didn't think possible but somehow it is. Either way with brown or coconut sugar they are good. This is the only chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe I will probably ever use for the rest of my days, or at least into the near future. Highly recommended!!

TOO MUCH BUTTER COOKIES SPREAD AND ARE BROWN AND MORE OF A CRISPIER COOKIE PLUS TOO MUCH SALT. RECIPE IS FOR UNSALTED BUTTER AND THE RECIPE FORGOT TO OMIT THAT OR THE WRITER PUT THE INCORRECT AMOUNT OF SALT. WANTED TO MAKE COOKIES FOR MY KID BEFORE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.  WHEN A COOKIE SPREADS TOO MUCH THAT MEANS IT HAS TOO MUCH BUTTER. YOU CAN FIX IT BY ADDING MORE FLOUR BUT, I DONT HAVE TIME TO CORRECT THIS RECIPE WANTED COOKIES FOR TONIGHT. HAVE TO REDO.

have made this twice so far.  the first time followed the recipe exactly, nice but a bit flat.  then read some of the reviews and took on board cutting out the salt, adding more flour etc.  then rolled the mix into a sausage in cling film and placed in the fridge.  so easy to slice them into rounds and gently flatten onto baking sheet.  perfect and of a more consistent size.  my grandsons loved them and everyone else who have tried them. they don't last very long in my house! may try them with hazelnuts next time.

Good, basic oatmeal cookie recipe. Be careful not to over mix the dough: cookie dough should be mixed just until the ingredients are incorporated. Do not use a mixer after the flour has been added. Use a big ol' wooden spoon. I find using baking powder(about 1/2 tsp) along with the baking soda will help puff up the cookies, too.

looking for the best chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe? this would be the one! so soft, tasty and not too too sweet. Recommend this recipe to anyone. Made these the other day for my family and boyfriend and they all seem to like them. Just remember not too over cook or make them too small, as they will be crunchy and hard.

I really loved this recipe.  I was looking for a good, chewy oatmeal cookie that would allow for some add-ins and that's exactly what I got.  I made them exactly as stated, and ended up with 49 nice sized cookies.  I followed the basic recipe to the T, but changed the add-ins: 1c semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1c toasted almond slivers, and 1c dried cherries.  I also used almond extract instead of vanilla, to emphasize the almond flavor.  With the additions, since chocolate and cherries are both a little sweet, I felt that the amount of salt was good.  However if you're just making a basic oatmeal cookie, you will want to cut down on the salt.  Also, if your cookies are coming out flat and burning it is likely because you are over mixing (or over creaming), or because your dough has gotten too wet or too warm ... all of these things can thin out your dough and create a flatter cookie.  I'm happy to say that mine turned out great.  I did end up having to cook mine for 15 minutes, rather than the stated 12 minutes, because for my oven 12min was just not enough.  So many things can go wrong with baking, even the temperature outside plays a part in how your items turn out.  If you didn't get a good result the first time, you might want to try again rather than just throw this recipe out.

Great recipe! I altered the recipe by adding a total of 1 3/4 cup flour, and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. I used unsalted butter. When mixing the cookies I beat the wet ingredients until light and fluffy, then I added my flour mix along with the oats and chocolate chips at the same time and stirred them together just until mixed. I baked them at 335 degrees for 12 minutes. They turned out super chewy and not flat at all! A+++ cookies with the altered recipe.

GREAT RECIPE! Read through some of the reviews - Added 1/2 tsp more baking soda, cut the salt back to a dash, and cut back the white sugar to 1/4 cup. Cookies were a bit flat, but were chewy in the middle and crisp on the outside. I will definitely keep this recipe for future use! Thank you!

My family thought these were awesome!  The only thing I did different from the recipe was what many others suggested.  I increased the flour to 1 3/4C and 1 tsp of baking soda.  Great recipe!!!

We found them a little salty if you use salted butter.

Made these cookies exactly like the recipe, except for substituting pecans for walnuts.  I made them really big and probably got about 32 cookies (baked them for 13 minutes).  They are soft and delicious, and they look great!! We love them and will definitely make them again...soon!

After the changes recommended by other reviews these cookies were pretty yummy. Especially the second day. I added 1 3/4 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp.

This is a very good basic recipe. I added at least a teaspoon of cinnamon, a large handful of dried cranberries, a 1/4 of ground flax, and 1/4 less white sugar. My cookies had a nice shape - not at all flat.  Next time I will cut back on the butter by substituting apple sauce as someone else suggested.

Wonderful tasting recipe with a real chewy texture, my boys loved these!  the cookies were flatter than I watned, but I have read reviews now and I will try chilling the dough for 2 hours prior to baking.

We used milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet, otherwise, I followed the recipe right on.

Will be making many more times to come!

These are wonderful cookies! I've made them about 10 times for my family and friends. They can't get enough of them. I do cut the salt in half (I've tried it both ways - too salty as written), add the half cup of flour and increase baking soda to a full tsp. With these modifications, the cookies are never flat or runny. They are addicting. Be sure you have some nice cold milk in the fridge...it's the perfect pairing!

I made this recipe last night and it turned out amazing! I did some changes per other's reviews with adding 1/2 c more flour, 1/2 tsp more baking soda, 1/2 tsp LESS salt.  I also did some changes per my own taste buds by grating about a small navel orange zest (this totally makes the cookies!!), 1 tsp cinnamon, and added flax seed so I don't feel so guilty! :)

Thanks to all who suggested chilling the dough. I put mine in the freezer while the oven was preheating and that seemed to do the trick. I thought the amount of salt was fine assuming you are using UNSALTED butter and not salted or margarine. These turned out nice and chewy!

Really liked this recipe, but it came out a little dry on my first run. I like chewy cookies, so for round two, I added 4 tblsp of raspberry jam. It takes delicious, and the flavors don't fight each other at all. Very nice!

First of all, thanks for the recipe.  I loosely followed the recipe because I used salted butter and did not add extra salt or nuts.  I also put in twice as much vanilla extract and added cinnamon to make them a bit spicier.  

I know that this is often regarded as incorrect, but for this recipe, I melted the butter down a bit more than usual before I creamed it with the sugar and extract.  In fact, the butter was a bit warm and very soft when I creamed it with the brown and white sugar.  I know that this is basic, but mix only one egg in at a time after that.  The result was a heavenly, and very light butter/sugar mixture.  I also mixed the baking soda into the flour with a fork so that it was evenly distributed before mixing everything together. 

I then chilled the mixture for ten minutes and rolled my cookies into walnut sized balls (or slightly larger).  I feel like this helped to keep the cookies aloft when they were baking.  The first batch baked for 12 minutes at 325 were a bit gooey in the middle so I let them finish cooking on the pan. I actually think that when they cooled, the 12 minute cookies turned out just fine.  The cookies I tried for 13-14 minutes were perfectly acceptable, but a bit too dry the next day.  I have not tried the extra flour or baking soda, but I think that it would definitely give the cookies a bit more body, if that's what you are into.

I have made cookies for YEARS! NEVER have I stirred the flour mix into the egg/sugar mix till now - OMGosh - I could not believe how they held their shape!! I just figured that was more work than I cared to do and that it was the "butter" that was causing them to spread...even after refrigerating. I refuse to use margarine..not healthy!! This recipe is great - but not out of the norm - so I'm thinking it must have been the "stirring by hand"?? Will now try with other recipes. 
SO - a BIG THANKS to the author - but also to the reviewers that made comments about not using the mixer....I FINALLY LISTENED!!

I increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups and the baking soda to 1 teaspon, as some reviewers have suggested. I also put the mixture in the fridge for about an hour before spooning it onto cookie sheets. The cookies did not flatten--huzzah! However, these cookies only remain chewy while they're still warm. After that, they get kind of hard and crunchy.

These cookies were chewy and were not flat but they just didn't wow either my husband or I. The flavour was okay but lacked that good flavour that you get from a cookie that has been browned a little with the edges a little brown and crunchy. Thanks anyway!

Fantastic followed advice and added a little more baking soda and 40grams more flour and only half a teaspoon of salt,didn't have any walnuts so used all choc chips, the best cookies I have ever made I don't think I will find a recipe to beat this, next time I will try them with dried cranberries and choc chip.

I have made this recipe a dozen times and they are the closest thing to the perfect chocolate chip oatmeal cookie I've ever had! They are my go-to - without fail, they are moist, slightly crispy around the edges, and full of flavor. The only slight modifications I make are as follows: I don't ever buy white flour or white sugar so in their place in the recipe I use raw sugar and unbleached 100% whole wheat flour (I'm partial to King Arthur brand). I also halve the salt to 1/2 tsp and because I like a cookie that's not 'fluffy' I leave the flour and baking soda as is even though many reviewers add more. Perfection! I eat a whole food, primarily plant based, minimally refined, minimally processed, diet most of the time.... but every once and a while you just have to have a "splurge" item and these cookies are absolutely it for me. Yum! Thanks for a great recipe!

Follow the tips and these were wonderful!! Increases flour to 11/2 cups, increase baking soda to 1 tsp, added half tsp cinnamon and only 1tsp real vanilla. Only used half tsp salt. Used only 2cups quick oats. I added 1 tsp molasses. Split the cookie dough and made one with choc chips and the other with pecans & golden raisins. Refrigerated dough 30 mins before and baked on parchment paper in my electric oven on 345, 9-10 mins. Do not over cook them! Cool full 5 mins before placing on cooling rack. Keep dough in fridg. 1 also added 1/4 tsp baking powder. Slightly under cook them. They were a Hugh hit. Very soft and chewy and great flavor, a keeper! Make them a bit bigger cause they do shrink a bit, they spread a little not a super thick cookie, but I like how they turned out. Only used the mixer for the butter and sugars and eggs, then mixed with spatula, don't over beat the dough. Will make these again and again! Thanks!

This was a great recipe, I made this for a sick friend in the hospital and he's demanding more! I did try a couple myself...I did notice a huge difference from when I stuck them in the fridge for an hour. The first ones came out pretty flat, so I decided to use the fridge suggestion and it was like a different cookie, very pretty! I used two cups of flour and increased the baking soda to 1 teaspoon. This was terrific, will be making again!

Combining tips from other reviews, I used 1 1/2 C flour, 3/4 t soda, 1/8 t salt, chilled the dough for 1 hour and baked at 335 for 12 minutes. Even though I only used raisins (no nuts or choc chips) the consistency was perfect. YAY!

I made these for my Pharm Tech class at UEI.  I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown, used 1.5 tsp of vanilla (not 2 tsp), added 1 tsp cinnamon, added 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening into the batter and left out the walnuts (in case any of my classmates should be allergic to nuts).  The 1st batch took 30 min cooking @ 325F, so my 2nd batch I cooked at 350F and they cooked in 20 min.  I just ate one from the 1st batch and it was very good!  I will update this comment with how my classmates liked them, later today.

I made these for my daughter's preschool graduation picnic and they are SUBLIME!  That's not a word I normally use.  However, they somehow managed to stick to my guaranteed-not-to-stick airbake non-stick cookie pans.  That's alright, though, because the broken ones don't have any calories, right?  RIGHT?

Great recipe! I did follow other reviewers and added 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and less salt by 1/2 tsp. I also mixed by hand as I mixed most of my cookies by hand. I find using a hand mixer or food processor makes the batter too funny, and cookie batter should be more firm. This recipe totally worked and I don't think the 1/2 tsp additional of baking soda is necessary as long as you mix it by hand. You won't need to refrigerate either! Cookies came out nicely, not flat at all.

I substituted half of the butter for applesauce like another reviewer recommended. I also baked at 335 for about 13 minutes (added an extra minute because I let the dough sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes.)

This recipe on its own is delicious! The butter makes them spread out thin, just let them cool 5-10 minutes before taking them off the pan. (I use a silicone baking mat for cookies; well worth the $9 I spent - easy cleanup and easy to remove.) Instead of walnuts, I added about 3/4 pecans but grinded them up in a food processor first. The pecans made them taste great all around w/out big chunks of nuts. I've made 3 batches now, but I use less butter than the recipe calls for (about 1.5 cups). They still taste supreme even if your measurements aren't exact. My notes aside, these cookies are amazing and you won't be able to eat just one, or two...! Thanks Panthera!

Followed advice and used more flour and baking soda, refrigerated the mix.  Still they were pretty flat but chewy and delicious.  I will use this recipe again.

My husband and I LOVED these cookies! I took another person's advice and used less salt (like a quarter teaspoon). I didn't have any nuts on hand but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I made smaller sized cookies, yielded 4.5 dozen! They baked chewy on the inside and just slightly crisp on the outside. This will be my base recipe for cookies from no on. Oatmeal raisin next!

These cookies as they stand in this recipe are not to my liking. They came out SO flat. I also had to keep them in there for 17 minutes because they were raw and watery after 12 (and I keep my cooking stone in the oven as it preheats). I took them out at 17 because they were starting to burn on the sides but the middle was still raw. They were so unreasonably sticky I had to scrape of the cooking stone when I finally got the cookies off. Then they fell through the cooling racking into a pile of crumbs. A pile of crumbs that tasted bland. Luckily, I thought the salt was too much just reading the recipe and hadn't put that much in.

So I scrolled down to read the reviews (which I would have done sooner if I realized that the 5 star rating was so unjustly given) and saw that everyone was adding flour to the recipe to make it passable. So I did, and more baking soda, and more sugar, and a little cinnamon, and now the cookies are only kind of blah. 

Do not make these.

I cannot explain how amazing these turned out! I followed others advice and added more baking soda and flour. I also dumped random amounts of baking items from pantry: whole bag of white choc. chips, whole bag walnuts, half bag of toffee chips. I chilled the dough before baking as other suggested at 335 deg. for 12 min. They stayed big and did not flatten out at all and everyone gushed over them. My advice: read the reviews and take these other smart ladies advice...then MAKE THESE!!

The BEST oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted. I followed the advice from the reviews and added 1/4 c. flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda. I omitted the nuts and chocolate chips. The cooking time is about right; the cookies should come out of the oven when their centers still look raw and are only stable around the edges. Let them cool on the baking trays (I use parchment paper or silicone baking mats). These are so delicious and chewy- I promise!
UPDATE: I tried Beth's Spicy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, which were even better! They were the same recipe as my modifications to this one, except baked at a higher temperature so they wouldn't spread as much.

Fantastic! I omitted the nuts (personal preference) and baked for 15 minutes instead of 12 and they are amazing. I dont know why everyone else is having to add more flour but mine turned out great! Thanks for sharing this recipe! Def will make this my "go to" oatmeal cookie recipe :)

These cookies are pretty good... I read some of the other reviews on this recipe and decided to add the additional 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp of baking soda because I was nervous and didn't want to mess them up when everyone clearly says it helps. I would say, try the original recipe how it is first before you do this because the cookies TASTE good but they didn't really take on a real cookie shape. They look like little scones to me! I thought they would flatten down but they kept their glob shape. :( I had my husband try the cookie and the first thing he said was there is WAY too much vanilla! I told him out of all the reviews no one complained about vanilla and it was just his imagination.

This recipe was amazing! My best friend showed it to me and I fell in love. Best cookies I've ever tasted. Next time I would like to try half white chocolate chips and half chocolate to see what happens, but definitely a keeper!

Oh my, I've baked many recipes from this site with great success but I must have missed something on this one.  I found it far too salty even after I cut the salt in half, I did as others suggested and used 1 1/2 cups of flour but except for the taste of the chocolate chips I found the cookie very bland.

I have made these cookies a few times and what has worked best for me is baking them for 15min, I used unsalted butter, added a 1/4 more of flour and I used dark brown sugar. They came out perfect!! Super delicious,  thanks for sharing :-)

Perfectly chewy cookie. I only used 2 cups of oats. Salt amount is okay in recipe. They puff up in the oven but settle down while cooling.Taste amazing! Still very chewy after cooling down all the way.

Absolutely amazing cookies. I took the advice of some of the other posts. I used 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp salt. I also didn't put the walnuts in. Also, I cooled the mixture before baking. They turned out great!!!

Great recipe! As some other reviewers suggested I omitted the salt since I used salted butter, other than that I stuck to the recipe. Husband gobbled them up and now I'm baking some more tonight.

I used 1 cup of wole wheat flour and 
3/4 cup of white flour
3/4 teaspoon of baking soda
1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon
1 dash of nutmeg
a little less than 1/4 teaspoon of salt
Smart Balance Butter
1 regular egg and 1 egg white

I made bigger cookies and they were thick, didnt spread far and fluffy not hard
These were healthier than most

I only gave a 4 because my cookies did not turn out like the picture, despite my having followed the recipe.  They still tasted very good.  I will make again.

So good! I made changes most recommended like I did 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda and I let the dough sit in the fridge for an hour or so. I also left out the nuts because no one in our house likes them. I do think because this recipe has so much butter in it, the cooling of the dough in the fridge really helped the cookies stay chewy and not flatten out too much when baked. I also did dark chocolate chips because thats all I had on hand. These really were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I have ever made! Thanks :)

Changes made:1 cup white flour and 3/4 cup wheat flour; 2 cups of choc chips; added about 1/2 cup of milled flax seed. I chilled the batter for 20 min prior to baking and needed to bake for approx 15min (otherwise too raw) which resulted in chewy and delicious cookies.  Next time I will omit the salt all together, as I used salted butter.

These cookies were definitely deicious!  I did what some of the reviews said to do about adding 1/2 cup of four and upping the baking soda to 1 tablespoon.  I also added cinnamon and split the batter into two and did half without chocolate chips, they were great both ways.  These cookies stayed moist and chewy and will be my go to oatmeal cookie for now on!!!

I love these just as they are, and also when I want a richer less puffy oatmealy cookie I just use 2 cups oats instead of 3 and they are butterier and like a different cookie.

OK - I know it's a preference - but here is what I did to make the recipe how we like it:
Change 1 cup butter to 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening, as others have done - flour is now 1 1/2 cups, baking soda is 1 tsp, and salt is 1/2 tsp.

Why do people give this 5 stars? This is the problem with the internet--people will say anything is 5 stars just because they made it and it isn't poisonous. Do not make this recipe! 

Even with adding flour, less salt, the recipe is fundamentally flawed (they are not chewy, they taste flat and bland). These "cookies" are more bread or cake-like. Not real cookies.

Tasty....but tooooo chewy to the point they stuck to the cookies sheet.  I used regular oats and maybe quick oats would have kept them together.

Yummy! I had to make a couple of changes:  used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup butter. used wheat flour instead of white. used raw sugar for both white and brown sugars. also increased baking soda to 1 tsp and omitted the salt. cooked bottom tray for 13 minutes, middle tray for 16 minutes and top tray for 20 minutes. cookies are delicious. ate some warm, put some in fridge, and put some in a ziploc in freezer. you can pull the ones from the fridge or freezer and eat immediately (no thawing required). they taste good all three ways. thanks for an awesome recipe!

I made these cookies as written and they were delicious!  I refrigerated the dough for a while, which firmed it up.  I spoon dropped them and they turned out just fine.

I made this recipe Friday night before the hurricane was due to hit S. Jersey. I wanted something healthy around. The recipe was great. I did change it up somewhat. used King Arthur's white whole wheat flour. Used raw sugar and a tad of honey, and cinnamon. Used half butter and half shortning, and as always added peanut butter. Everyone loved them. They are almost gone

I love this recipe! I do make a few changes to make it "healthier", though, without sacrificing taste. I only add 1/3 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar then supplement 1/2 a cup of Stevia. I don't need all that much chocolate, just enough to taste, so I add just 1/2 a cup. I also put 1/2 tsp salt instead of 1.

Love these.  If you haven't tried the Whole Foods Brand Mini Dark Chocolate Chunks, try them in this recipe.  To die for!  The first time I made these I used unsalted butter and got a crunchier cookie (my preference).  The next time I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter because we were out of regular butter.  This resulted in a chewier cookie (the kids' preference).  Either way they are a winner.  And BTW, hubby just likes chocolate chip cookies, so both versions were to his liking ; ) !!!

My husband who doesn't like cookies LOVED it. I did add a little extra flour and oats like some reviewers suggested. But I think the suggested full tsp of baking soda might be too much for sensitive folks like me. My hubby didn't taste it but I did. Will try again with less baking soda.

I gave the recipe as written 4 stars because of the previous reviewers changes, but the end result 5 stars! I feel that the extra flour and baking soda necessary.  I however, I only reduced the salt by 1/4 tsp.  I found this to be a good amount; any more may have been too much salt.  I also added a 1/2 c. more of chocolate chips.  I also upped the oven temp. to 350, and baked for the written 12 min.  You can tell they are done when the edges are just starting to turn a light golden brown.  

With these additions, I also found it helpful to chill the dough for an hour before putting onto a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet.  Another helpful tip is to flatten the balls of dough slightly because they don't flatten as well on their own.  

Overall, a very yummy cookie...chewy yet soft and fluffy!

Yummy, chewy, and perfect. :) I followed the recommended modifications and added sour cream for moisture--just yummy. Love the vanilla-y taste.

I've made these cookies dozens of times and didn't have to modify recipe except to sub pecans for the walnuts. They are always crispy on the outside and chewy inside. My kids, my kids friends, everyone who tries these loves them. Wonderful!!

So... I am giving this recipe a 5 star with my revisions. You must use 1 3/4 cup flour, 1 tsp of baking soda and cut the salt in half to 1/2tsp.  Also, for a twist, I added 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate and 1/2 cup butterscotch morsels.  I also scooped with an ice cream scooper onto baking sheet and because the cookies were larger (due to spooning with the ice cream scooper), I baked on 335 degrees for 16 minutes. They are going to look like they are not done but they are. Be sure to let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes after removing them from the oven.  Super good!

A great oatmeal choc chip cookie recipe.  I didn't alter the ingredients at all, but on the recommendation of another chilled the dough for about 30-45 min before baking the second round and this helped keep their shape so they weren't flat as others reported.  Great flavor, incredibly moist and chewy!

I was looking for an easy recipe for cookies since I am a beginner baker. These were easy enough that even my 4-year-old helped. And they turned out delicious. Chewy but not greasy, not too flat and not too puffy. Really good!

Cookies tasted great, although they tend to fall apart and are quite flat.  Most likely my fault since I halved the recipe and used egg substitute.

VERY MOIST!! This is my favorite type of cookie and it is the first time I found myself fawning over the other ingredients rather than the chocolate! I can't believe that is even possible. If I can make these regularly then I'll open my chocolate stash to the public!

Veryyy yummy cookies. I increased the flour and baking soda and decreased the salt, as reccommended by @Fervent Frugal Foodie and others. FFF recommended a bake time of 335 for 12 min, which is what I tried but they still came out very doughy in the middle. My cookies tend to be on the large side, so that was probably why. I had to cook for 13-15 mins depending on each batch. In the end, very yummy recipe.
Edit: I also did not use nuts.

Best cookie recipe ever! I used the suggestions of 1 1/2 c. flour and 1 tsp baking soda. I also only use 3/4 c. brown sugar and nix the white sugar completely - then add 1/2 c. more dark chocolate chips. I prefer a lighter sweetness in the dough so the chocolate flavor really comes through.

I added another half cup of flour, decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp & increased the baking soda to 1 full tsp. My husband & his friend came in & had a bunch of them with their coffee & his buddy asked if he could have the recipe for his wife & also for  few cookies to bring home for her & their little girl to try cause he thought they were so yummy.

This is my first review! I signed up just to review this recipe!! :)

I am health conscious so I modified this slightly.... I used brown sugar in place of the white, replaced the all-purpose flour with white whole wheat flour, and semisweet chocolate chips with 86% cacao Ghirardelli chocolate. I chopped the chocolate into chunks, and omitted the walnuts because I didn't have any.  I also added in a 1/2 tsp of baking powder and baked them for 14 minutes so the cookies are less dense and not doughy.

This is our favorite cookie. I make it several times a month for my family. My husband, who doesn't have a terrible sweet tooth, is constantly asking me to makes these! I have also given them to friends when I cook a meal for them. I can't tell you how many times I've been asked to share the recipe. The only 2 things I've changed: 1) I use White Whole Wheat Flour, 2) I usually omit the walnuts (b/c my husband prefers it that way). I don't ever cook/bake with AP flour, so I don't know how different it tastes. All I know is that WWW Flour is AWESOME!

It was a little too salty, but still delicious! I subbed 3/4c applesauce and 1/4c vegetable oil for the butter, used only 1/2c sugar in the raw, and added 1c sweetened shredded coconut.

Fantastic cookies!  I might add a tsp of cinnamon for variety to this recipe though, just on occasion. We cut the salt in half as others suggested.  Also, we upped the temp to 350, because it was taking too long (>15 minutes) at 325.

These are great! I made my cookies pretty big, so I only got about 1 1/2 dozen. I baked them at the same temp and for the same amount of time, and they turned out really soft and chewy. Probably a little under done actually, but they're so good that way!

I used old-fashioned oats, which I pulsed in the food processor for 5 or 6 times.  They made a more uniform cookie with the same chewiness and great taste.  I also used slightly less sugar.  Leave plenty of space in between the cookies before you bake them.

Delish! Followed others tips, and used 1 1/3 c. white flour and 2/3 c. wheat flour. I did increase the baking soda, and reduced the salt, but I would go back to 1 tsp. when I make again, esp. since I used unsalted butter (that could be the difference). 

We used Valentine M&M's in half the batch, which made for a pretty cookie. I used parchment on my cookie sheets and let them sit when they were done to set and they came out perfect!

Great cookies!  After reading previous reviews I made the following changes.  
1 3/4 cups flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
I made half with dried cranberries and raisins and other half with choc. chips and toffee bits.  Both were great but I preferred the c.chip/toffee bits and my husband preferred the raisin/cranberry combo.  I made them into balls and froze then I can take out as many as I want to cook.  They didn't flatten out too much doing it this way plus I added 1/2 cup more flour than recipe called for.
Will make often, loved them!  Thanks Panthera!

I followed others' suggestions (as to salt and baking soda) and mine came out too fluffy and cake-like. Next time I would decrease salt but leave the lower amt of baking soda. I also used gluten-free plain flour, so that may have affected the finished product. Overall, quite tasty, but I prefer a chewier cookie.

I've been looking for a recipe like this! I did my research and scrolled down through the comments and reviews.  I baked these today for the first time, and took the multiple advice of increasing the flour (I used 1 3/4 cups) and baking soda (to 1 tsp), and decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp.  I also omitted the nuts, my son has a no-nut policy at his school.  So now these are the perfect addition to his lunch box!  Finally, I baked at 335 for 13 minutes, perfect.  They came out of the oven looking undercooked, but I left them on the pans for 5-10 mins to cool, and they ended up soft, chewy and perfect.  This is now my standard oatmeal cookie recipe!

I followed the modified recipe with more flour, more baking soda and less salt and these were absolutely delicious!  I added a few more chocolate chips only because I am a chocolate lover.  I was going to freeze half of the dough, but once I tried the first cookie, I knew I had to cook it all because the first batch will be gone in a heartbeat.  I only got 3 dozen from the batch since I made my cookies a little larger therefore I had to cook them for a few minutes longer.  This recipe is a keeper!

excellent!!  I try to stay a tiny bit healthy so I used half butter and half coconut oil and half whole wheat flour half regular flour (up it to 2 cups and also doubled baking soda).  These were SO good!  Used a melon scoper to get perfect little balls of dough and they made perfectly circle cookies.  NO idea how some people ended up with flat cookies.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were good.  Listened to the other readers and added the extra 1/2 cup of flour and the full tsp of baking soda.  Then threw them in the freezer for almost an hour before baking.  Got nice little round puffballs of goodness!

I have no idea what the rest of you are doing, I made this recipe exactly as it says and my cookies turned out Perfect! They are not flat they are not to salty and I didnt have a problem with the dough being to runny at all. They are delicous and wonderful they came out of the oven perfect, I did however bake them on a pampered chef cooking stone so maybe that is the trick (?)

EXCELLENT. I substituted raisins for the walnuts and used milk-chocolate chips because that's what I had. I had a cookie straight from the oven and was pretty disappointed. I had one a couple hours later and...WOW. So good!! My go-to oatmeal cookie recipe now!

I used some recommendations from reviews: 1 3/4 c. flour, 1 tsp. bk. soda, no salt.  I omitted the nuts and used half butter and half shortening.  I baked at 335 for 12 minutes.  They turned out perfectly thick and chewy, not dry at all!  I chilled the dough for the first few trays but left the bowl on the counter after that, didn't seem to make a difference for me, no spreading problems either way.  I doubled the recipe and it was a bit hard to mix by hand but not too bad, the doubled recip/e fit in my big mixing bowl.  Made again 8/16/11 with all butter, turned out great!

THESE COOKIES ARE AMAZING! My boyfriend loves them too. I took others' tips: 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking soda. I used whole wheat pastry flour and substituted half a cup of butter for half a cup of coconut oil (delicious and is better for your metabolism and cholesterol- try it)!

Great chewy cookie! 5 stars with these few changes. First time I made these I followed the recipe and loved the texture, yet I found them too salty. I just finished baking them for the second time, (last batch is still cooling on  the wire rack) and I've already eaten three. Here are the changes I have made. 1- no salt. 2- Used apple sauce instead of butter. Had I had any fructose left I would have substituted it for the sugar. In any recipe that calls for sugar, you can substitute it by using half the amount of fructose. You'll never know the difference. My sweetaholic hubby doesn't know I cut the fat and the sweet from his treats. Fructose can be found in a natural food/health store.

Delicious!! This recipe is perfect as written. The only difference: I used wheat flour in place of all-purpose flour. Upon taking out of the oven, the cookies are chewy and slightly crisp around the edges. Wonderful.

These are great cookies.  Hubby just emailed me from work to tell me how much he loves them.  I replaced the nuts with another cup of chocolate chips.  I baked them on insulated cookies sheets, which means I had to increase the baking time to about 16 minutes.  They came out wonderfully chewy and very chocolaty with those extra chips!

These are pretty good! I tried to make them a bit "healthier" as some others did. My adjustments: 1/2 cup butter with 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 cup white flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, used all brown sugar, only 1/2 tsp of salt, no nuts, 1 cup 60% cocoa  chips and 1 cup white choc chips, and refrigerated the dough for 3 hours before baking. Lots of adjustments, but they are yummy! My 8 year old loves them!

This is a great recipe that everyone in my family loved. We cooked half on a textured single layer cookie sheet, and the other half on a smooth, insulated (two layer) cookie sheet. The ones on the single sheet came out perfect, whereas those on the insulated sheet flattened out and got crumbly on the edges, making them hard to get off the sheet. Great recipe! Glad to have found it!

i love this oatmeal cookie recipe!  i followed other reviewer suggestions:  add 1/2c more flour and 1/2 tsp more baking soda.  make sure to mix in the flour mixture, oatmeal and choco chips by hand so that the cookie stays fluffy and doesn't flatten out.  a definite keeper...so yummy :)

Best cookies ever!!!! Seriously!! I love making these!! I divide the recipe in half so I don't have too many because I would just eat them ALL myself.   I like how these cookies are not super rich or overly sweet.  I use whole wheat flour and Old Fashioned Oats. YUMMMMMMYYY!!

These cookies are so tasty! I only changed a few things- I added 1/2 c extra flour, 1/2 teaspoon more baking soda, I cut the salt in half, and I sued 1/4 cup extra of dark choc morsels. 12 min baking and they were perfect!

I made these to the 't' as far as the dough goes.  I used half butterscotch chips and half semi-sweet.  I also ommitted the walnuts as my husband doesn't like them.  I used a medium cookie scoop and baked 14 minutes, rotating the sheet after seven minutes.  They were VERY good in both flavor and consistency.  Thank you for the recipe, it's a keeper.

The perfect chocolate chip oatmeal cookie.  The edges bake up a little crispy, while the middle stays soft and chewy.  This is my go to recipe for oatmeal cookies.  I even use this and add in some cinnamon and raisins for a spicier version.  Great recipe that I will use over and over!

So so good!  I didn't need to add extra flour or baking soda as some reviews suggested. But next time I'll bake them for just 10 minutes since we like them a bit more soft and goey. Will definitely make again!

This recipe turned out great my parents and family really enjoyed them. I used maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal with pecans instead of the regular oats, Because the oatmeal had sugar already in it I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup (instead of 1c) and I reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup(instead of 1/2c). I used mini chocolate chips rather then  the regular sized.

I made these per the recipe, but omitted the nuts.  I really liked the balance of brown sugar and regular sugar.  I loved the texture, although my second batch spread much more, and therefore were thinner/crisper, even though I put the dough in the fridge between batches.  I got three dozen big cookies.  Next time, I would add more chocolate chips - at least 1 1/2 cups, or maybe just the whole bag (can you have too many chips?  I don't think so).  I might also add just a little cinnamon next time.

Awesome cookie recipe. I have to say this has to be truly one of the best oatmeal cookie recipes I have come across. The cookie is chewy but a little crisp and delicate on the outside. I made exactly as the recipe except for one minor change of using 1/2 of a bag of dark chocolate chips. I wanted oatmeal to be the star of the cookie.  These will disappear fast so you might want to double your recipe.

Hubby LOVES chocolate chip oatmeal cookies and he loved this one. The recipe made about half the amount it stated and we didn't make them big. I cooked one batch for 14 minutes because they didn't look done and another batch for 12 minutes and the ones that cooked 12 minutes were perfect. We didn't change a single thing ingredient wise. We made some the other day and are already making some more. They are yummy!

These cookies turned out terribly!  Little did I know that the reviewers all had their own "little" suggestions.  You know, like add another whole cup of flour, take out ALL the salt, add another cup of oats, etc.  This recipe is a waste of time as written.  The cookies spread out to about 3 times their original diameter and they were only about 1/4 inch thick.

This was a great recipe. I used 1 and 1/2 cup of flour after reading suggestions. I also substituted 1/2 cup of butter for 1/2 cup of applesauce, so I think it needed more like 14 minutes to bake.

Wonderful recipe! I've tried so many Oatmeal cookie recipes and this one is it. I made a few changes as suggested...I added 1/4 cup of flour to the mixture and I only used 1/4 tsp of salt because I used salted butter. My cookies weren't flat but the color wasn't as pretty as I wanted it to be. I baked it for 11 minutes and it was still soft and chewy after. This recipe is highly recommended!

I have now made this recipe three times, and it is flawless every time, super yummy, and my kids and husband devour these in less than two days every time.  I did what several others suggested, decreasing salt to 1/2 tsp., adding 1/2 T of baking soda, and 1/2 cup flour and that makes them quite round.  I also use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco.  They aren't too sweet, but are just right, and I like that they have oatmeal in them which at least has some nutritional value in the fiber.  Excellent recipe!

Wonderful oatmeal flavor. I followed the necessary changes that were recommended by reviewers. I made these twice. The first time I felt they were almost too salty, but not unbearably salty. Originally I used salted butter and a dash of salt, but I decided to try them again. This time with less salt, I still used salted butter but didn't add any additional salt. I added raisins and subtracted the nuts--they were delicious! You can eat many of these without tiring of them. Furthermore, they're very easy to make. I highly recommend these.

Yum! I've made these 3 times so far, and they've been perfect everytime! The only adjustments I made were to lower the salt to 1/4 tea (I used salted butter as well), and up the baking soda to 1 tea.

I love this recipe, it's so like an old family one (that I don't seem to have a copy of).  I made alterations because my family is vegan and ubber healthy.  Instead of butter I used the same amount of virgin coconut oil. I used 1 cup of xylitol instead of the white and brown sugar (and it was plenty sweet). Instead of eggs I used 1 tbsl ground flax beat with 3 tbls warm water (per egg). And instead of all purpose flour I had spelt (or kamut I can't remember) flour that I used and it worked beautifully.  This cookies went over awesome with my vegan family and are now one of my friends family favorite as well, and they aren't even vegan!  Great recipe.  Thank you so much!

yum!  normally I have to cut out some sugar and some chips because I don't like excessively sweet cookies. this one is just right. I added the extra flour and baking soda as others suggested.  1 3/4 flour, 1 tsp baking soda. baked at 335 for 12 min and they came out great!  then I got lazy and put in 2 trays at the same time and got the flat cookies everyone talked about. so my advice is to bake one sheet at a time and rotate 2 sheets so you aren't putting raw dough on a hot sheet.

Best cookie probably EVER!  Made according to recipe, wonderful.  On subsequent efforts made minor modifications - 1/2 butter and 1/2 Crisco shortenning (less spread) and doubled chocolate chips.  Coworker calls them crack cookies, because eating one makes you want to keep eating them until they're gone and go looking for more.

Tasted good...  recipe, not so good.    The dough was sticky and I had to add waaay more flour than called for.  If I hadn't they wouldn't have turned out.    I had to give only 3 because the recipe couldnt' be made as written.

My 12 year old daughter made these with me and she loved them!  Perfect recipe. I did however reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp.

Yummy!  The cookies looked a little under-cooked, so I cooked them longer the first time...BIG MISTAKE!!!   Follow the recipe to the T!

Best cookie recipe I've tried so far!  I substituted a large portion of the butter for peanut butter and the result was fantastic!

I followed the advice of the other reviewers, and increased the baking soda. I increased flour by 1/4c and grinded down 1/2c oats in a mini food chopper to add to the flour. I think it really made a huge difference in the texture and taste of the cookie! Sticking the dough in the fridge really helps out a lot with the spreading.

I LOVED these cookies, I did roll and then press them with a fork for aesthetic appeal. The only change I made was I used half the amount of salt. They were delicious and soft even days after I baked them! Definitely a keep for my recipe book!

Excellent! My mom taught me if you have trouble with cookies spreading, change your fats source slightly. I used 1/2 c salted butter softened and 1/4 c canola oil.  The rest of the recipe I left untouched, except for doing 1 tsp baking soda as others recommended, and lessening the amount of walnuts to about 2/3 c, since my hubby isn't terribly fond of nuts.  I baked them at 335 for 13 min and they came out gorgeous - perfectly chewy, slightly crisp on the outside, and no crazy spreading (didn't have to refrigerate the dough either, this way!).  Just lovely!  Definitely a new family fave. :-)  Thanks!!

Tasty oatmeal cookie!  My whole family loved them.  We hardly had any left after they cooled completely because everyone kept coming back for another.  They were chewy and delicious.  I followed others advice and added 1/2 c. extra flour, 1/2 tsp. extra baking soda and cut the salt to about 1/4 tsp. I live in humid part of Texas so my cookies tend to spread out more when I use only butter so I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening.  This seems to make my cookies stand up better.  I made my cookies about 2 inches each (so it made more than the stated 3 1/2 dozen).  I baked them at 325 degrees for 10 min to get cookies that stayed soft & chewy even after they cooled down and did not spread out flat.  They looked underdone when I took them out of the oven but I left them on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.  They turned out perfectly!  I will be making these again soon.

I halved the salt and doubled the baking soda.  I used mini choc chips as that is what I happened to have, and added some chopped up Hershey Symphony milk chocolate (1/3 cup).  My coworkers gobbled them up!

These cookies call for way too much salt! I was not very impressed. I left out the nuts and used dark chocolate chips. Honestly, I would not use this recipe again.

The cookies are amazing. Instead of all purpose I used self raising by mistake, still came delicous. The only problem is that you just cannot stop eating. I also substituted choc chips with chopped toblerone. My son loved them!!!!!!

A really good oatmeal cookie. I increase the oats by 1/2 cup and used spelt flour since we have a wheat allergy. Chilled in fridge for 1/2 hour before baking. Baked at 350 for 12 minutes

Excellent! I'm very picky about my cookies and this one is the best so far other than the classic Chipits recipe. I cut the salt in half and sub more choc chips for the nuts - personal preference. I also bake at 350 for 10 min. which gives them a crunchy outside and soft inside.

Wow!! These cookies are awesome! I followed the recipe for the most part, but made a few changes. As others have suggested, I cut the amount of salt in half because I used salted butter. This is a great suggestion. I did not use walnuts, but instead doubled the chocolate chips to 2 cups. Also, I used a food processor to grind the oats down a bit. This gave the cookies a smoother texture, and also helped them not to spread so much, as others have complained about. Overall, a really great tasting cookie!! Thanks for sharing!

We loved them!  I too added 1 3/4 flour and 1 tsp baking soda like everyone recommended.  I live above 6000 feet and they didn't deflate like most cookies do here.  I also added dried cranberries and it really balanced the choc. chips nicely.  My picky husband loved them and asked for more :)

very good cookie...we made a few modifications from others suggestions...increased flour using 1c all purpose and 3/4c whole wheat flour, increased baking soda to 1tsp total and decreased salt to 1/2tsp total; we also substituted 1/2 c of butter with applesauce and didn't add nuts. We refrigerated for 1/2 hour before baking and baked at 335 for 13 minutes. They came out perfectly.

These were pretty good although not as soft as I would have liked.  Maybe I didn't soften the butter long enough.  I omitted the nuts and added about a handful each of Hersheys Kisses (the baking ones) and butterscotch chips.  Yummy!!!

I truly enjoyed this cookie.  I added the extra flour and baking soda.  They came out looking like cake cookies, but when I tasted them, they were awesome!!! Thanks for sharing (oh and I left out the nuts and choc chips as I had none on hand but yummy)

OMG!!  This recipe is fantastic!  I did take some other reviewers advice and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour (total added was 1 1/2 cups), added one teaspoon of Soda total and I used unsalted butter.  I also chilled the dough slightly before baking. I didn't add nuts b/c we're not big fans so added an extra 1/2 cup of chips instead.  I cooked them at 335F for 12 minutes each and they came out perfectly!!  Some of the cookies I allowed to cool longer on the baking sheets so they weren't soo chewy (for my husband) and pulled some off nearly right away to cool them on the racks, soo unbelievably good.  This will definitely be my new chocolate chip cookie.

You can use normal oats if you don't have quick-cooking, just add a little more liquid.

Super moist cookies! Brought them to work and they were gone in no time. I have been looking for a recipe with oats, chocolate chips AND walnuts and this is THE one. Easy to make, perfect baking time. I wouldn't change a thing  :)  yummers

A good recipe but nothing special.  I added the extra 1/2 cup of flour and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp (like other posters suggested).

I read reviews and added the suggested extra flour.  Also, thought I had chocolate chips, but did not.  Substituted Cinnamon chips I found in the pantry........MMMMMMmmmm, good!  I may make them like that all the time!  These stayed moist for a week (before they were gone) stored in only a plastic coffee can.  Delicious -- thank-you for the new recipe!

Definitely a keeper!  I made a few adjustments.  I prefer dark brown sugar in my cookies.  I also used 3/4 cup white flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat.  I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp.  These won't last long!

I will always use this recipe to make chocolate chip cookies from now on!  Very Yummy, just right.  I put about 2/3 of the oats in the blender before adding to the mixing bowl because I do not keep quick oats on hand.  This worked well.

I love this recipe.  I have modified it to make it healthier.  I use part white flour, wheat flour and wheat germ.  I use rolled oats and Smart Balance Stick Butter.  They are still wonderful.  In fact, the Smart Balance Butter Sticks hold the shape better.  Just remember to chill the dough for at least 1 hour before baking.  I love to have these as a quick after-school snack.  Therefore, I usually make the full recipe.  I chill the dough, drop out cookies, stick in the freezer for 1 hour and then stick them unbaked in a large ziploc bag.  Just bake for 14-16 minutes when frozen.  They also hold their shape better too!  These have been a staple in my pregnancy, hence the need to make them a little bit healthier!!!

The cookies turned out great! I reduced the white sugar by half and since I didn't have any walnuts on hand, I only used chocolate chips. Will definitely make it again! My dad, who usually doesn't try anything that I make, gobbled them down as soon as they were out of the oven! Thanks for the great recipe. :)

These cookies are stupidly addictive.  It's like my family has never had cookies before.  I made a half batch last night, and there is none left.  Making another half batch now.  Afraid that if I made a whole batch, that they, too,  would all be gone before morning, and that can't be good for us.  UPDATE:  I made these again with the additional flour as suggested by others--we didn't like it.  Stick to the original recipe and you won't be disappointed.

This recipe turned out great! I'm giving it 4 stars because I did make slight changes.  First, even though it doesn't specify, you have to cream the butter and sugar till it's really fluffy.  This will help make your cookies puffy.  I only made a half recipe, but used a little more flour than was stated.  (It was only about 2 T more for half, about 1/4 c. extra if I would have made a full recipe.)  Lastly, I changed the baking soda to baking powder.  Baking soda helps to raise acid ingredients like buttermilk, and this recipe doesn't have acid ingredients.    Also, I used whole grain hot cereal from Trader Joe's, which looks like oatmeal, but has different grains, like rye, barley, oats, and wheat, just to add more texture.  As a hot cereal, it is chewier and heartier, so I wanted to see if it would add those characteristics to a cookie, too.  The mix was stiff and dry-ish.  I scooped out large balls of dough, and flattened the tops with the palm of my hand, just to help them along.  I baked them at 350 for about 12 minutes, noticed that the tops weren't browning as fast as the bottom, and put them one rack higher than the middle to finish cooking.  I was afraid that 325 would dry them out by the time they were browned.  Hope this helps.

Best Cookie Recipe I've EVER Made! I only did half the chocolate chips, but added 1/2 c. butterscotch chips for additional flavor! So delicious! I also made the slight motifications suggested: 1 1/2 c. flour, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. baking soda. I made the dough the day before baking, so I had to increase the cooking time to 16 min. when I did bake them--and they turned out perfect! A definite keeper!

These are best oatmeal cookies ever. Mine weren't flat and hardly spread at all. They are big and chewy. Great with chocolate chips or raisins.

These cookies are awesome! Like previous reviewers, I increased the flour to 1 3/4 cup, the baking soda to 1 tsp and omitted the salt. I did not put walnuts in it because we don't do well with nuts, so instead I put 2 cups of chocolate chunks. I also just put the entire batch into a 9X11 cake pan and baked them for about 23-24 minutes and cut them into bars. They are fabulous, and I will make them many more times!

Added almond extract and it's the best cookie recipe ever! I also love to freeze them as they don't really "freeze" but get super cold and are an excellent summer treat! Definitely try it with almond extract, even if only in 1/2 the batter - it's a great addition!

I did as others recommended by upping the flour to 1 3/4 cups and the baking soda to 1/2 tbl; however, I only had old fashioned oatmeal on hand (no quick cooking).  So, I used 2 cups (since the oat is bigger).  They turned out INCREDIBLE!!!!  Love, love, love them!!!  Oh, I also upped the vanilla to 3 tsp, but I always add more - vanilla lover here.  Anyway, thanks so much for a fabulous recipe and for the reviews that were super helpful!

I'm usually awful at making cookies from scratch but this recipe came out absolutely perfect for me. If you don't want your cookies to spread, you do not have to change the recipe by adding flour or oatmeal. To keep the cookies super thick, just chill the dough before baking and make sure your cookie sheet is at room temperature or colder. I experimented with baking these cookies in different ways and my personal favorite is with cold dough on a hot cookie sheet. That combo kept the centers thick and chewy but allowed the edges to spread a bit while baking so they got a little crispy.

This recipe was easy, and very yummy.  I used butter flavored vege. shortening, instead of the butter.  I cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, upped the chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups, and added 1/4 teaspoon baking powder.  I mixed the dough by traditional bowl and spoon method (not in a mixer) and let the dough chill for the time it took to preheat the oven (about 10 minutes).    I baked them on ungreased fiberglass baking mats.I had no problem with the cookies spreading.  I'll make these again.

I have made these cookies so many times the recipe is now memorized. The only changes I have made are the following: Unsalted Butter, Milk Chocolate chips(the entire bag), No Nuts and I bake them for 18 minutes. The cookies NEVER last 24 hours.

A great cookie!

I made the same changes as previous reviewers (extra 1/4C flour, 1/2t baking soda) and used and extra cup of choco chips instead of the walnuts.

I will use this recipe again. Thanks!

I think I've found "my" cookie, these are exactly what I want...buttery, chocolatey, brown sugar, chewy, not too sweet and great texture. It loses a star only because of the modifications needed to the original recipe: Reading all the reviews, I did as suggested and used 1.5 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, and 0.5 tsp salt. Also, I only had 0.5 cup diced walnuts, and mini-chocolate chips. Baked for 13-14 minutes at 325. Really perfect. I think I'm done looking.

I added 3 mashed bananas and 1/2 c. extra oatmeal. I kept the dough in the fridge and only baked as we wanted them. However, when I made the last batch, there were a couple of cookies left over. Surprisingly, I thought they were better the next day than they were fresh out of the oven. They stayed moist and chewy---just how I like them!!

Very yummy oatmeal choc chip cookies!!  I do recommend following a few variations: add a little more flour, baking soda, chocolate chips and one Tbsp of milk.  My recipe seemed to lack in oatmeal. I would recommend adding a little more than 3 cups.

Great, classic cookie. I thought it tasted similar to Quaker's recipe. I used almond extract instead of vanilla and cranberries instead of chocolate chips...I love this variation.

YUM! I've been using the same chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe for 15 years (we call them cowboy cookies), but thought I would try a new one. So glad I did! These cookies are chewy, moist, and almost gone.  :) I made a few minor changes...used all brown sugar, less salt (just a shake), added a whole tsp of soda and a half of baking powder. I'm going to throw out my old recipe! Thank you!!

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe that I have found.  One tip I learned that works really well is to add 1 tablespoon of whole milk to the recipe...it helps make the cookies fluffy instead of flat!  Thanks...my husband LOVES them!

I wanted to review this recipe again because I've made more changes to make them healthier. I halfed the recipe this time because I only wanted a few cookies in the house, since I live by myself! I used all whole wheat flour, a 1/2 cup splenda and a 1/4 cup brown sugar. They are delicious!

These were good but not my favorite - I followed the recipe, but I think maybe I should have used all brown sugar like other reviewers.  My cookies were soft but not exactly chewy, and maybe more brown sugar would have made them chewier?  Still, a very good and tasty recipe.  I did have to up the temperature to 350 to get them to cook all the way through and get some decent color on the tops without burning the bottoms.

Loved them. Usually can't get oatmeal and chewy to come together, but these did. I also made them using whole wheat flour and Splenda blend sugar, and they were still great.

I thought they were good, but my family went totally crazy over these.
These were gone in one day. 
These have been requested at least twice a week since I first made them 2 months ago. 

I followed the recipe exactly.

Very good cookies. I think I overbaked them a little bit. They still looked way under cooked, but if you wait for them to look lightly brown on top they aren't chewy anymore. Next time I will know to make sure they look a little under done and then they will finish cooking outside the oven. Great recipe though.

We really enjoyed these cookies, and they were very soft and moist. I took the advice of others and added half the amount of salt to the batter, and added a tablespoon of warm water to the baking soda to dissolve before adding. They are excellent and came out right on the first attempt, the cookies didn't crumble or come out dry. Make sure the oats are the minute oats, they are smaller, not the regular oats or else they will come out dry and won't cook thoroughly.

This is the second time I've made up this recipe with some modifications and these cookies are just delicious!  I increased flour to 1 1/2 cups, increased baking soda to 1 tsp. and decreased salt to 1/2 tsp.  I can't keep these around!

These cookies had excellent flavor but they turned out to be very dry. I am not sure why as I followedthe recipe to the letter but they came out dry and crumbly. Perhaps a package of instant vanilla pudding would have helped. Will try that next time.

AMAZING cookies. I did change it a bit, as suggested i added and extra 1/2 cup of flour and of oats, omitted the salt(i had to use salted butter), and added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I refridgerated the cookies for a half hour so the wouldn't spread and baked them for 12 minutes at 350 degrees. They turned out PERFECT. Soft and chewy and delicious. I would love to try adding cinnamon or nutmeg next time, i love spicy chocolate. Make these! and enjoy!

These cookies are great! I have made over 15 batches now.  I definately suggest adding more baking soda and about 1/2 C more flour to the recipe so the cookies don't flatten out.  The Ghirardelli 60% Cacao chocolate chips are the best.  For a twist on things, substitute 1 C chopped/dried apples for the chocolate chips.  Add Cinnamon, Cloves, and Ginger for a spiced apple oatmeal cookie - they are delicious.  Or, add two cups of your favorite trail mix in place of the chocolate chips and walnuts.  Have fun with this recipe - you can't go wrong.

I was very happy with them. I added a tsp of cinnamon and subed 1cup whole wheat flour and 1/2c of all purpose. I made the change to add 1/2 tsp if baking soda and decrease salt by 1/2 tsp.  I didn't need to refridgerate them before baking they were not flat at all, just don't over mix.  Thanks for the recipe

I've followed dozens of cookie recipes from this site, and this recipe is in my top five. I don't deviate from the instructions except for using 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I bake them for just 12 minutes, and they come out perfectly every time.

This is the second time I've made these and the third time I've eaten them (sis made the first batch). They are awesome!!!

Few modifications: used whole wheat flour and 2.5 cups of oats. 

Last time there were too many oats but that may just be my poor mixing skills...

;)

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe

One of my favorites!  I fix the flattening problem by popping the bowl of dough in the fridge for 10-15 minutes before rolling them into balls.  This firms up that melting butter in the dough so it holds together a little better during the baking process.  I NEVER have problems when I do that. In fact, I have to flatten the little balls with a spatula first to keep them from coming out too round.  I will continue to make these over and over again!

With the suggestions of others (1/2 cup more flour & 1/2 tsp more baking soda & 1/2 tsp LESS of salt) these came out great.  I didn't have any vanilla extract so I threw in some brandy.  Very tasty!

Best Oatmeal Choc Chip Cookies ever. My husband and son devour them every time I make them.  My mom's tip: Store in an air-tight container with 1 slice of bread!  This will keep the cookies soft FOREVER!

Delicious! I was forced to make some odd substitutions but these cookies still turned out great! I didn’t have enough butter on hand so I used butter-flavored Crisco instead. (I added 6 tsp of water to the Crisco before I creamed it with the sugars.) I also discovered I didn’t have enough oatmeal so I used about 1 and a half cups of regular oatmeal and then I emptied 2 packs of instant apple-cinnamon breakfast oatmeal into a colander, shook out the apple-cinnamon flavoring, and added that oatmeal (along with its dried apples) to the mix. I was pretty sure the cookies were going to be mediocre at best, but WOW. They really turned out great. I will make these again and again. I will probably keep the Crisco in place of the butter, but I will double check my supply of oatmeal before I start baking next time

Probably the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. I love that they stay chewy. Just remember to use SOFTENED butter not melted butter, it makes the cookies runny. I found that out the hard way.

I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed.  After the recommended cooking time the cookies were not nearly baked enough.  I switched to convection on my oven and baked them for 8 minutes.  They were then chewy on the inside.  Still, not a great recipe and would not make again.  MUCH prefer the recipe on the side of the Old Mill oats package for oatmeal raisin (sub the choc chips for the raisins).

One of the best cookies EVER!!  I added 1 cup of peanut butter chips in place of the walnuts and the cookies tasted like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cookie!  I now have to make these all the time for family and friends and have been asked for the recipe numerous times.  A+++

I would have given it 5 stars because my parents and friends love these! they are slightly crisp around the edges and soft in the center. However, I took off one star because they were not as good as i expected. I didn't have chocolate chips on hand, so i used raisins and made a more traditional cookie. Also I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Overall, a great, no-fail recipe.

I was just going through my recipe box and realized I'd never rated this recipe.  My husband requests these cookies at least weekly, and I have the recipe memorized as a result.  His friends sometimes even call to find out if there are cookies in the house and decide whether to visit accordingly.  I do bake them at 300 rather than 325 to prevent the bottoms from getting too brown before the cookie itself is done, but that's probably due to my ancient oven and not a reflection on the recipe.

Fabulous recipe.  The trick is to refrigerate the dough for at least a couple of hours before baking, and roll the dough into neat balls to bake.  I substituted heath bar bits for chocolate chips.  When done this way, these were the best cookies I have ever made, and I make a lot of cookies.

Used UNsalted butter, added the extra flour and soda as well as 1tsp of cornstarch (to make'em extra chewy).  Wonderfull everytime!

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added a bit more flour and baking soda, and these came out delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe. *Updated edit: I tried making this with only whole wheat flour (in the past I mixed in a bit of whole wheat to regular all-purpose), and they didn't taste right. They had a strange, salty aftertaste. I strongly suggest using either regular all-purpose or a 50/50 blend with whole wheat or it will not come out properly. I didn't have an issue with flat cookies -- in fact, I had to flatten them with a wooden spoon before baking and they came out fine.

Absolutely my favourite cookie recipe!  I have made a few modifications:
I use 100% whole wheat flour instead of white flour and for a variation I have used butterscotch chips with pecans instead of chocolate chips and walnuts.  Both ways are great!  PS:  I have found with the whole wheat flour the cookie does not flatten

I almost didn't make this recipe because I read some not so good reviews. Boy I am glad I made them anyway.  They are delicious!  I only had 3/4 c. butter but it didn't seem to matter.  The one thing I did differently than usual was I did not let the butter get too soft. Just soft enough to mix but not melty at all. I think that helped the cookie to stay puffy and chewy.  I also did reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. because I use salted butter and I used dark chocolate chips.  YUMMY!  My kids LOVE these!

Great recipe.  My variation on it was putting in only 2 cups oatmeal - that seemed just right. Next time I'll try adding a bit more baking soda. My cookies weren't flat exactly, but they could have been fluffier. Overall though, the cookies taste great!

Great chewy cookie recipe! My aunt loves 'em. I only used 1/2 cup of stick butter (by accident initially), but they still tasted fantastic (and healthier, too!).

My DH rated this one, as per usual.  But this time he said I need to cut back on the oatmeal (2 c.) and increase the chocolate chips.  Otherwise he did like them, just not thee best.

Awesome cookies!  And I have a hard time finding cookies I like.  If you use butter flavor crisco instead of butter or margarine, you won't have that spreading problem.  The cookies stay in a uniform shape and are still chewy.  I made the following changes based on other reviews:  1 1/2 C. flour, 1 t. baking soda, 3/4 t. salt.  I added about 1/2 cup more oats (I used the old fashioned kind), 3/4 c. chocolate chips, 1/2 c. rice crispies, and 1/4 C.  coconut--my family loves coconut and omitted the nuts because I didn't have any...I would try pecans instead of walnuts because I think walnuts have a funny taste sometimes. I will definately make these over and over!

Okay my 8 year old and I just made these cookies and they were awesome, perfecect, good, super-wondeful(her words)! They were really easy and came out soft and chewy. They look a little underdone when they are ready...but trust the timing, to keep them chewy you can't overcook them! Thanks for the great recipe!

The kids LOVED these. I reduce the salt as suggested by other reviewers. I also increased the chocolate chips -- hey, why not eh? ;-) -- and omitted nuts. They were gone in a day and our children are very popular on the street. :-)

This recipe was great! I have alot of chocolate chip and oatmeal cookie recipies and this one is the best. To make my cookies a little more moist I added a teaspoon of lemon juice and of course I had to add a cup of cranberries!

These cookies are good.  Mine turned out almost too soft and chewy, though.  I used M&Ms instead of chocolate chips (because I had a big bag I wanted to get rid of) and I didn't use any kind of nuts.  They tasted pretty salty too.  Maybe my butter was a bit to soft or something, but mine were kind of flat and falling apart.  I followed the recipe exactly other than my two alterations.  Any ideas?

I'm not too generous with my five stars.  I only give them if the recipe is AMAZING.  Folks, these cookies are AMAZING!!!  Absolutely perfect.  I did omit the nuts and add another cup of chips (I used a whole bag, actually), and believe it or not, I was out of vanilla, so I used butter flavoring instead.  I also cooked them for about 16 minutes.  They were not even close to being done at 12.  They spread out just enough, the edges were delicately crispy and the inside chewy!  MMMMMMM. I don't like to review a recipe if I've changed it too much, but I had to write about these.  They are great!  My cookie jar is very, very happy right now.  Thanks for the recipe, Dr Amy!!!!

This tastes exactly like a cookie I've been paying $2/cookie for at a local bakery.  They're easy and SO good.  Recipe makes a ton so make sure you have friends to share them with.  I used 1 cup regular chocolate chips and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips and got rave reviews from everyone.  These will be my new go-to cookie!

These are really good cookies. I did, however, make some changes to fit our tastes. I added extra vanilla (1 Tbsp), 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg (next time I might add a little extra of thse to spices as I really like a spiced oatmal cookie). I didn't feel like chocolate, so I used currants (1 cup) instead (half way through making the cookies I realized that I was out of rasins. oops!) I poured boiling water over them and let them stand 10 mins before sraining them and adding them to the dough. They got nice and soft and went nicely with the chewy cookie. I'm not a big walnut fan, so I used slivered almonds instead. Really good! Added a nice crunch. I might actually add a tsp of almond extract next time, I think it would really bring all the flavors together nicley. Anyway, they turned out really well. I made them last night, and there are only 2 cookies left tonight, and it's just the 2 of us! *LoL* My boyfriend is the cookie monster, I swear.
Thank you for this tasty recipe. I'll deffinetly be making it again!

When our huge family of cooks makes cookies no toll house will do it must be OATMEAL chocolate chip. This one is nearly perfect. I think next time I will add a few spices. This recipes is the perfect base for any added items like raison, any flavor chip or nut. AWESOME
My daugher found that the best way to achieve a moist cookie was to let the cookie just barely brown and let the set till cooled. THANKS

Excellent!!! Instead of the nuts, I just added raisins.  Yummy!  Moist and Chewy, just the way a cookie should be.  I will make these again and again.  I only put a dash of salt too, and they were fine.

I had to modify this recipe just a little bit because I didn't have any brown sugar, had to use white sugar with a little bit of honey instead.  They didn't bake up quite right but they tasted unbelievable, they were so yummy.  I can't wait to try this recipe again, using the brown sugar.  Thanks for the yummy cookie recipe!

I also altered a bit by using 2 cups of old fashioned oats and I used semi sweet and white choc. by Ghiradelli and it was great.  My first batch was very thin so I switched from my usual alluminum uncoated air cooled cookie sheet to one that was coated with dark teflon and the second and third batch were perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I added 1/4 cup all natural peanut butter, 1/3 cup long coconut & less sugar. I also had to cook mine about 14/15 minutes. These cookies stay nice and plump:)

I also tried this recipe, because my husband is not big in to desserts.  These cookies did not last long.  Within 48 hours they were gone.  A must try for anyone who loves soft chocolate chip cookies.  Also, because I have little children,  I didn't want the nuts, so I doubled up on the chocolate chips, what a great chocolate fix.

Delicious. I have to say, I am quite a hard critic of recipes and usually like to tweak recipes to make them better (in my opinion :) ) I followed this recipe to a tee and was pleasantly surprised. Just fabulous. I only made two tiny alterations. I added some raisin, which added a nice sweet flavor in some bites and I found, with my oven, I needed to turn up the heat a little. Amy, these are great.

These cookies freaking rock!!!
Every time I make oatmeal cookies they end up thin and flat...but these were quite the opposite!
They were fluffy and the perfect combination of chewy and crunchy...I was absolutely amazed!
I made half a batch with raisins and the other half with chocolate chips...they were loved by all!
Which is pretty tough seeing as there are 8 people to please in our house!
I will definitely make these again!!!!
Thank you soooo much for the recipe, you rock!

An excellent cookie!!  Not the "best" cookie I've ever tasted but this recipe is definitely a keeper.  I love chewy cookies and this cookie is definitely chewy!!  I took the advice of others and only used 2 cups of oatmeal and 1/2 tsp. salt and they came out great.  I really do think that 3 cups oatmeal would be WAY too much.  I used one whole 12 oz. bag of chocolate chips instead of just one cup.  I think next time I'll stick to the recipe and use only one cup because a whole bag is too much, for my taste.  If you like a lot of chocolate chips in your cookies, though, go for 12 oz. instead of one cup!!!

I must have done something wrong. I followed the recipe to the letter and all I ended up with was a crystalline sprawl on my baking sheet. Very disappointing.

This recipe does turn out very well!  Tip:  Do not use a mixer and do not cream the butter.  Make this entire recipe with a wooden spoon. I think this makes cookies puff up too much and then colapse after cooking, making them less chewy!

WOW awesome recipe. I always use baking stones to bake my cookies, so i added a few more minutes to the cooking time.  about 15-18 mins total.  They also freeze well. I portioned out the cookie dough on a cookie sheet and froze them for about an hour then put them in a freezer bag.  also you may want to add a minute or 2 if the dough is frozen.  hope this helps...THANKS for a great recipe!

Delicious! Made these today and wish I had found this recipe earlier! I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening. Added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, omitted the walnuts. The dough was extremely easy to work. I think that you could do a lot of variations with this recipe, it is so good! Thank you!

Very Tasty!  I made the cookies following the recipe exactly, and they came out wonderfully.  The only thing I would suggest is leaving them in the oven for more like 13 to 14 minutes.

Hi, I checked the difference in the type of oats and found the following info: quick oats = quick-cooking oats = quick oatmeal = quick-cooking oatmeal = easy oats    Notes:   These are thin flakes of oatmeal that cook up in about three or four minutes.  They're a good choice for oatmeal cookies.   Substitutes:  rolled oats (More nutritious and chewy, takes longer to cook. If substituting rolled oats for quick oats in a cookie recipe, consider refrigerating the dough for 20 minutes before baking-- otherwise the cookies may become too flat and thin) OR instant oats (This contains additional flavorings, and is less chewy. It also takes less time to cook)

Overall, these cookies were very tasty and filling. However, I wouldn't say they were "chewy". They were a snack and even a great quick breakfast. Instead of using only a cup of chocolate chips, I used the whole bag.

I took everyone elses suggestions and used 1 teaspoon of baking soda and 1 1/2 cup of flour.  I also only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Next time I will only use 2 1/2 cups of oats and add another 1/4 cup of flour.  The recipe is rich and delicious!

These cookies are wonderful!  They turned out chewy and NOT flat at all.  I did change a few things.  Here it is:  added 1/2 c. extra flour, 1/2 tsp. extra of baking soda, 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening (rather than full cup of butter) and also added coconut.  Last thing, I put my dough in fridge for one hour and in between baking.  They are soooo good!

Love this recipe, so do my kids. We made the following changes: used Crisco instead of butter, almond extract instead of vanilla, added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1/2 tsp. salt, old fashioned oats for quick cooking, 1 1/2 cups walnuts, 2 cups chocolate chips. We use an ice cream scoop to get cookies onto parchment paper and bake for 13-15 minutes. Makes big, thick cookies that DO NOT spread too much. One is often enough. We bake 2 dozen and freeze 2 dozen 'balls' for quick and easy treats. All around, a truly great cookie base. Thanks.

Great recipe. These are the best oatmeal cookies I've had in a long time.  I followed the other reviewers' instructions by increasing flour to 
1 1/2 c., baking soda to 1 tsp. and decreasing salt to 1/2 tsp.  I used salted butter in my recipe also.  Not sure if this makes a difference to the recipe, but I sifted the flour, baking soda and salt together and I pulsed the oatmeal in the food processor before adding it to the mix(following a suggestion from another recipe).  If you like raisins with your oatmeal cookies, these taste absolutely delicious with golden raisins.

I made these and I got mixed reviews.  I thought they were good and chewy however I usually make a more traditional c.c cookie that is softer.  However I kept the recipe and will make again.

M-m-m-m! Awesome! I omited the walnuts and added:  1 cup white choc. chips, 1 cup chopped macadamia nuts, 1 cup dried cranberries, to the 1 cup of semi-sweet choc. chips!  There was so much "stuff" in them that I had to shape balls and squeeze them together because they were falling apart!  But once they were baked...YUMMY!!!!!!  THANK YOU, Dr. Amy!

Good recipe, I followed the advice of using more flour and baking soda and less salt, it didn't specify whether to use a teaspoon or tablespoon to drop the batter with, so in the first batch the cookies turned out huge! The second time I made it I used raisins in half the batter and used a teaspoon to drop the batter... I still didn't manage to get the 3 1/2 dozen cookies though. Any way good recipe, better with the modifications.

I am going to give this recipe another try with 1/4C more flour, 1/2tsp more baking soda and refrigerating the dough for a bit.  When I made them they really spread and needed a lot more cooking time than the recipe states.  I used 1 cup raisins instead of the nuts. They were good, just flat and hard to transfer to the cooling rack.

Excellent cookies!  I can't stop eating them.  I did add an entire bag of chocolate chip cookies rather than just one cup.  Even though I love chocolate, it's a bit much, so next time I will add just the one cup.  It's very important to let them sit on the cookie sheet for awhile before moving them to the wire rack!  They taste even better the second day . . . and the third . . . and the fourth, etc.

The walnuts! The walnuts gave the cookie an irresistable taste. Absolutely delicious. At first, I thought they tasted horrid. But they weren't very cooled. But the cookies surprisingly stayed chewy by the next day and the taste was incomparable to any other cookie I've tasted (at least very recently).

Everyone absolutely loved this recipe!!!  Very moist and chewy.  I plan on making them again, next time using raisins.  This will become one of my "classic" recipes.

I've made them before and I'll make them again!  They are easy to make and easy to eat.  I use the medium cookie scoop for these.

These were great!They were a little flatter then I prefer. But that could have been my fault. Anyway the flavor was great and they were very moist. Also very simple to make. I used extra choclate chips.

This is the best recipe I've ever looked! The cookies turned out to be moist and soft inside and a bit crispy outside. This was what I just wanted! I used butter instead of shortening, but the cookies were still excellent!!!Thanks for sharing.

I made these for a football party and everyone raved about them.  One couple found them during dinner and couldn't wait for dessert to be served.  They told everyone how chewy and good they were and the cookies were nearly gone in an hour.

These are REALLY delicious.  I ran out of oatmeal after about 2 1/4 cups, so the cookie flattened out considerably and was crispy around the edges.  I will try the raisin suggestion next.  Thanks!

I use this recipe all the time it is absolutey easy, fun, fast and delicious. It's great with frosting on top of them and you can also make them into cookie squares by flattenning the dough and keeping it together instead of seperating it, kind of like brownies.

Great oatmeal cookie recipe.  We don't like walnuts, so I substituted an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Very good.

i made one batch and they were gone in ONE day.   so the next time i made 4 different batches using different kinds of puddings and cake mixesand chips.  everyone agreed the bananna pudding, yellow cake mix and peanut butter chips was "blow you away" yummy!  we're calling them "peanut butter and bananna elvis cookies"
thanks for the recipe!  i have a feeling i'll be using this one for the rest of my life!

These were the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. Chewy just the way i like em. My younger brothers gobbled them up. They were gone in less than 24hours! however, i accidentally thought the recipe said 3 eggs, so i added 1 too many eggs. they still tasted delicious though, but i had to increase the cook time.

The cookies were good and chewy, but needed a higher temp and more flour as they flattened quite a bit.

I cooked these at 325 for 13 minutes and they came out just right! Used heaping teaspoons full.  I made these for a special occasion so I used pecans, left out the chocolate chips and substituted 1/2 c chopped dried apricots and 1/2 c craisans. Fanstastic!

Scrumptious, totally enjoyable seeing as I'm hard to please with cookies. I prefer crunchy cookies and find most are too moist for me. This recipe has the best of both, moist in the middle and crunchie on the edges. I cooked them for about 15 mins, though that could have more to do with my oven then anything, and leaving them on the tray to cool COMPLETELY seems to alleviate any problems with breaking up.

I followed the advice from other reviews and increased flour by 1/2 cup and baking soda by 1/2 teaspoon, decreased salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I refrigerated the dough, also. Cookies came out perfect! So delicious!!

awesome cookie. crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. read the reviews and made the following changes.  

1. used half cup butter, half cut shortening. 2. increased baking soda to 1 teaspoon. 3. decreased salt to 1/2 teaspoon (used salted butter). 4. increased oatmeal to 3 1/2 cups. 5. created spoonfuls and put batter in the freezer for 10 minutes.

place balls on the cookie sheet and smash just little. bake at 325 degrees for 13-15 minutes. (took it out when tops were golden brown)

don't forget the last step. leave on the cookie sheet for a few minutes after taking out of the oven. this is key.

Delicious cookies but flatter than a pancake and impossible to transfer to the cooling rack (even after waiting the recommended 5 mins for transfer). They basically fell apart and I had to eat a lot of the scraps (lol). After 2 pans of flat cookies, I decided to put the rest of the dough in the fridge. I’m pretty sure the creator left this step out because I’ve made oatmeal chocolate chip cookies before and the dough was refrigerated 30 mins before cooking. Well it worked!  The chilled dough cane out like a normal cookie. Please update this recipe for people like me that don’t read the comments until AFTER their cookies are in the oven... looking flatter than a pancake.

I think these are fantastic as is and gosh darn are they good!  Don’t over bake!  This is truly one of those recipes that you cool on the pan for a bit and they set up nicely.  Crispy outside and chewy inside.  It’s a very thick, stiff dough so get your muscles ready! :)

I first made these a couple of years ago and my brother really loved them. He called them 'the little drops of heaven'! And this year I made these again with the my kids and they enjoyed the process. The taste was awesome as before. This recipe is a keeper. I used toasted peanuts as that's what I had, and reduced sugar by about a quarter cup.

Very good. Light, fluffy and delicious. As with other posters I added a a bit more flour (1/4 cup) and used about 1 tsp of baking soda. and only 1/2 tsp of salt. Turned out well. My wife and daughter approved.

I followed the directions exactly.  They came out absolutely perfect.  No need to change a thing.  I think it’s kind of unfair to rate something after altering the recipe, so I follow recipe as written.  After that I may make changes and add tips.  My second batch I experimented by making the recipe as written. Then adding 1cup of raisins and pecans instead of walnuts,  the cookies were amazing.

Very good! A little too sweet for my family so I would cut the half cup white sugar and just leave the 1 cup brown sugar. I also used whole wheat flour and my family loved them after the sugar cut. Sooo chewy and delicious!!!!

I cannot stress enough how important it is to READ THE REVIEWS.   Many people are providing useful tips that could save you hours of frustration and prevent you from wasting your ingredients.  For example, many people said to increase the flour and decrease the salt and that's exactly what I did.  My cookies came out  great !!  Also, please remember that all ovens are not created equal.  In fact, Cook's Illustrated Magazine tested oven temperatures and found that while set to the  same temperature, the internal temperature of different ovens can vary by as much as 90 degrees!!  You can't always follow the recipe as stated and expect  perfect results. I had to bake my cookies at 350 for 10 minutes to get the results I wanted.  So take the time to read the reviews and remember that  you may still have to make some adjustments.  Don't give up on a recipe after one bad experience because with a few adjustments you might find a gem that you will love for a lifetime.

These made a pretty good cookie. Many reviewers reported a flat cookie. Common causes of too-flat cookies include: Baking on too low of a temperature (I noticed this recipe said 325 instead of the more common 350); not enough flour - I added an extra 1/4 cup; and the butter is too warm when it hits the oven (this is why chilling the dough before baking may help); ineffective leavening due to unreactive baking soda / powder. Baking soda is alkaline (basic), and needs some sort of acid (e.g. cream of tartar, lemon juice, vinegar, etc) in the recipe to cause the cookie to rise ( acid + base = chemical reaction when mixed with wet ingredients). Vanilla extract is a weak acid, though perhaps not acidic enough to cause the desired chemical reaction in this recipe. I suspect this is why reviewers who doubled the baking soda, with double the usual amount of vanilla, had better results. 

I substituted 1/2 tsp. baking powder (which is essentially a mixture of acid and base that is activated when wet) for the soda with good results. 

As well I baked my cookies for 9 minutes at 350 to ensure they were soft and chewy.

I made these cookies using the changes people have suggested and it was amazing!  My sister brought them to work and people went nuts over them.
Changes made: 1 and 3/4 of flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking soda, and 2 tsp of vanilla extract. I also refrigerated the dough for 30 mins and then kept it in the fridge between baking batches.
Baked at 335 degrees for 13 minutes. This kept them soft and chewy on the inside with slightly crispy edges.

My whole family loved this recipe. I did as suggested in other reviews and increased the flour by 1/2 cup and baking soda by 1/2 tablespoon, cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. I would probably increase the flour a little more next time, since they were still a little flat, but the flavor and texture was delicious! I used chopped up a chopped up dark chocolate bar, milk chips, and a chopped milk Ghirardelli bar that added to the flavor. Yum!

Cookies are excellent! Nice and fluffy with just the right mix of chewy and a little crisp. I increased the flour by 1/2 cup, increased baking soda to double and cut salt by half. This proved to be perfect little change for an absolutely delicious cookie!

These cookies are the awesome!I am a single guy and nobody ever believes I actually made them from scratch. I made all the suggested changes and they turned out great!  One thing I didn't understand...I baked some test cookies first before I baked any big batches. Through trial and error I had the oven to 345 for 13 mins before they turned out right. Then I find out that nearly every other cookie recipe on earth calls for 350....so why does this recipe say 325 degrees? At that temp these cookies turned out horribly goopy. But hey that was just my experience. Still a great recipe!

Okay I haven't even made the cookie yet and everyone is saying to add more flour and baking soda. 
If you should know, yes flour adds stability but baking soda adds spread of the cookie (if you add too much.
If you want less spread and more of a stable round cookie, don't put as much sugar. 
Sugar melts and makes the cookie spread and then when it dries, the sugar crystallizes which makes it crunchy. 
This recipe should be followed and you should end with a thin chewy cookie with crunchy sides. 
This is no regular fluffy oatmeal cookie.  
I love this recipe how it is.

Oh man!! Awesome.. Reviews were soo helpful..added the 1/2 c flour, added the 1/2 t soda, cut the salt, fridged the dough, baked for 11 only...I may never bother with another cookie recipe. I used duck eggs and they translate to "more" so I'd prob use 3 if I had to use regular. I did use nuts..cashews! ,..yum!!..too busy munching to take a pic but you know what? They look pretty too!

I followed RCBA320's lead and swapped out 1/2 cup butter for 1/2 cup apple sauce, added an extra 1/4 cup flour to the original recipe, and omitted nuts. I also reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. after reading the reviews above. I added in some chocolate chunks too because I didn't quite have a whole cup of chips. I ended up with a very moist, dense, and chocolatey cookie.

This is my go-to cookie recipe. These are always a hit at home and when I share them. A friend told me "This is what a cookie is supposed to be like!" The secret to a rounder cookie is I prep the dough first, then put it in the freezer while I preheat the oven (about 10 minutes). Cold dough is key! I then use a melon baller and make however many I need at the time and store the remaining dough in a tupperware in the fridge so it's easily accessible and quick to bake. These bake perfectly at 325 for 12 minutes in my gas oven. With the small melon baller I have, this recipe makes about 5 dozen cookies consistently. Oh, and I always skip the nuts.

Made these this morning but omitted the walnuts and added cinnamon. Half I made with chocolate chocolate chips and the other half I made with raisins. Best oatmeal cookies EVER! I'll certainly be making them again!

it makes a nice chewy cookie with the extra bit of flour and baking soda that was recommended by everyone else.  I kept batter in refrigerator between batches.

Very good, following several reviewers' recommendations: went slightly 'heavy' on the sugars (didn't quite level the measuring cups) since I think cookies need to be sweet, increased flour to 1 1/2 cups, decreased salt to 1/2 tsp. (using salted butter still), increased baking soda to 1 tsp., and increased chocolate chips to about 1 1/2 cups.  I had to bake a bit longer, but think I overdid it maybe by a minute.  I have the rest of the batch frozen in dough balls so we'll be able to bake up just a few as needed.  Nice chewy cookie!  EDIT 9/26/18  Tonight I added in about  1 to 1 1/2 cups of raisens... YUM!!!

This is one of those recipes that make me wonder why I ever buy store-bought cookies. Under 45 mins from the time I said 'I wish I had a cookie' to when I actually ate the first one. Easy. Good. Mine didn't come out flat - I did roll them into 1" balls rather than drop. I didn't do anything else different other than halve the recipe and take out walnuts, because I didn't have any. 

It isn't a mindblowingly adventurous recipe (no sriracha-pesto-lemon zest), but if you're looking for an easy, basic, quick and yummy cookie, here it is.

This is really good. I used 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 butter in place of all butter, semi sweet chocochips instead of normal ones, carbquick instead of real flour and omitted the white sugar & walnuts entirely. Delicious!

I loved this recipe. Other than cutting back on the amount of sugar, which I do with all recipes, I followed the instructions. The result was a cookie with a crispy edge and chewy middle. The chocolate didn't overwhelm the cookie and the flavors were perfect. This is the first oatmeal cookie I've made in years that I might actually make again sometime. ***I just made these with candied orange peel instead of walnuts. So good!

As written, 4 stars.  With changes as suggested by others, a solid 5 stars.  Go with 1-3/4 cups flour, 2 teaspoons baking soda, and reduce salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  Excellent cookie.  Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.

Yep, these cookies came out flat. I reduced the amount of butter to 3/4, and all was good. If you want to make 'em even better, try this: ditch the vanilla and use a shot of kahlua... gives the cookies a touch of coffee flavor. Also, ditch the walnuts and use Rice Krispies instead... in fact reduce the oatmeal to two cups and use two whole cups of Rice Krispies. Now you have the best cookies ever.

These are delicious! Having read the reviews, I added 1/2 cup of more flour as suggested by some bakers. I did not find this to be good, as then the cookie did not spread as well. So next time I will stay with the 1 1/4 cup of flour. I used pecans instead of walnuts, but that is my preference.

Great recipe! I made it just as written, and they came out wonderfully; no problems with flat cookies. Maybe the flat cookies resulted from using margarine instead of butter? This is my new favorite chocolate chip oatmeal cookie!

THis was agood start, but it lacked a lot of flavor.   made oatmeal cookies many, many years ago.  It was my mother's recipe that got lost when she died. after more than 50 years, I decided to recreate the recipe.  I remember some of the key ingredients and after about 8 tries, I got a very good Oatmeal, Raisin, Walnut cookie.  The big secret in making the cookie is the use of a combination of spices.  I use 1 t. ground cinnamon, 1/2 t. ground ginger, 1/2 t. ground nutmeg and  1/4 t. ground cloves.   I also use both baking soda and baking powder.  I use buttermilk, 1 egg and 1 egg yolk and half of the flour is bread flower.  I guarantee that cookie is a winner.  If you want the recipe, send me an e-mail.

This has quickly become my favorite cookie recipe! Everyone loves them! I too adjusted the recipe by increasing the flour by 1/2 cup and the baking soda to 2 tsp instead of just 1.  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I baked at 350 for 13 mins(My oven is old so no idea how accurate)and they came out perfect.

I almost didn't try this recipe because of lots of the reviews having to alter the recipe, but I did with the alterations. I am so glad I did try this!  I did 1 3/4 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon salt (i used salted butter though). I didn't have walnuts, but I had 1/2 cup of dates that I was trying to use up so I threw them in. I make these for my husband and kids because I feel a little less guilty about having cookies around when they have all those oats!

I followed some of the advise and increased the flour, baking soda and reduced the salt. Also in lack of walnuts used pecans and I used regular old fashion oats. They came out amazing. I was making these for my husband because I'm not a big fan of oatmeal cookies but these are to die for. We're fighting to who eats the last one.
1 3/4 cup flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt.

I was craving chocolate sans the guilt, so I was really excited to finally try this recipe out!  I cut the recipe in half, used whole wheat flour instead (wanted to feel the least guilt possible lol), used Rob's Red Mill Muesli to kick it up a notch instead of regular oatmeal, and did not use chopped walnuts since there are a whole bunch of nuts in the Muesli.  Scooped the dough into little balls and froze before baking then placed them onto parchment paper (for the gooey center).  It seemed like it took forever for these to bake, so I ended up raising the temperature to 350 which seemed to do the trick.  I then let them cool on a wire rack and placed in a sealed container.  Brought them into work two days later and they were still SO soft!  They taste so different/just as good/maybe better cooled a couple days later!  I am shocked that this "healthier" version tasted this good.

GREAT recipe!  Use UNSALTED butter so they're not too salty...unless you like that.  I also used mini chips so that they were not overly sweet.  Buttery, chewy and well balanced cookie that got devoured as soon as I took them out of the oven!

I LOVE this recipe. It is the only oatmeal choc chip cookie recipe I will make. I follow the recipe exactly and always produce perfect, delicious cookies. I sometimes leave out the walnuts and the cookies still turn out great. The recipe also doubles very nicely.

Made this recipe but modified it a little.  I used 1 cup of mashed bananas and 1/4 cup of butter for the fat.  Also, I used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar only and they were amazing. Just the right amount of sweetness. Very soft and chewy.

I have made these, and many others. These are my favorite to date. Some complain about the salt content but I feel that brings out the flavor of the oats. I feel like im having a comforting bowl of oatmeal.Love it.

These cookies are delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup flour (I did not include nuts).  Also, I let the dough rest in the fridge for a few hours before baking.  A 1.5 tbsp scoop made 36 cookies. Thank you, Panthera, for this fantastic recipe!

Ok, after reading the reviews I was a bit apprehensive about making these, but my family wanted oatmeal cookies so I dug in. I was not in the mood to bake at all, but I just decided to hurry and get it over with. I messed up, I forgot the vanilla extract and had already mixed in some flour mix. Ok, so I put the extract in and mixed it up, then started with the flour mix again, then I remembered I forgot the eggs. I had almost all of the flour mix added when I added the eggs. I told my family not to expect much, added the eggs, the remaining flour mix, the chocolate chips and oats. These cookies could not have been better!! They taste awesome, they did not flatten out, just could not ask for a better cookie! I tried my best to mess them up, but this recipe was just too good!

Very good! I was afraid the cookies would be too flat and not chewy, but that was not a problem. I substituted the eggs for applesauce and butter with oil, due to my son's allergies. It still came out great. Thank you for a new favorite cookie recipe!

Just made these, and have to say, I used unsalted butter so they needed a little extra salt anyway, and the recipe turned out fine except for one thing. It did need a bit more flour (about 1/4 cup more) and I bumped the oven up from 325 to 350, and cooked them about 14 minutes. The first batch before making these changes came out a bit like a gooey granola bar, but still yummy! Now they are like a true cookie. :) I think it's a really good recipe, actually, all things considering.

Delicious!!! I made these once and will be making again. I think I've found my basic go to recipe. I followed other suggestions by adding more flour (I like to use semi-whole wheat). I didn't have baking soda (hard to find in France) so used double the amount of baking powder. I also like to add a mix of spices, usually 1/2 teaspoon each of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger. Usually when I make cookies I like to set the dough in the fridge for about half an hour. They turn out less flat. I also like to make little balls of dough and then freeze them. That way I won't eat all the cookies in one sitting and can cook a few at a time when my little chocolate lover requests cookies (my other son wants nothing to do with chocolate or cookies, so it doesn't make sense for me to make a whole batch). Next time, I want to add raisins in with the chocolate.

Wonderful recipe! I was looking for something to take to a group and this is great. I used Stevia in the Raw as a substitute for the white sugar and half all purpose flour/half spelt flour. This is delish!!!

here's a helpful trick for when letting cookies cool. give them a few seconds to cool after coming right out of the oven put paper towels on the wire rack. so the paper towel will soak up the excess oil from the cookies.

I made these tonight, but increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups per other reviews. I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil. I tossed in a cup of chunky peanut butter (hubby is peanut butter lover) and they came out delicious. I will definitely makes these again.

This recipe is my family's favorite cookie. I have made this recipe many times. I then tweeked it to our liking.  You should follow recipe as it says, then next time you can week it or just make recipe as is, which is wonderful.  Try adding the chocolate ( I use mini chips) but not the whole amount that recipe calls foe, then to nake the difference, I also add mint chips. Delish!!!!!

I followed the directions as written.  I only had white whole wheat flour and they were still delicious.  I was worried about the salt.  The dough tasted salty but the cookie was perfect when baked.  I used unsalted butter which may have helped.  i placed balls 1 1/2 inches apart and they had plenty of room to spread. I am at a higher elevation so I had to work with oven temp a bit.  14minutes @335 worked for me.  Enjoy.  I have been looking for this recipe for some time now.  Thanks!

I followed the other reviews and also increased flour to 1 3/4 cup and baking soda to 1 tsp. and decreased salt to 1/2 tsp. and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  I also used 1/2 c of butter AND 1/2 cup SHORTENING. I found that this makes the cookies fluffy. I chilled dough for 30 min. and then roll dough into 1 inch balls. I baked at 330 degrees for about 14 minutes. They came out AMAZING!  They are the perfect shape and are nice and chewy!  My boys all loved them!

I was running low on chocolate chips, so I substituted the rest with dried blueberries which turned into a wonderful chocolatey-blueberry delight!! I was also low on butter, so I substituted the remaining portion with olive oil, and used golden sugar instead of brown - still turned out great! However, I did have it in the over for 21 minutes instead of 12... maybe my scoops are a touch too big :)

This recipe is delicious. I personally love big chewy cookies, and if you do I found that if you roll your dough into cylinders and then bake it makes the cookies more tall and not as crunchy. You want a thin crunchy one? Than you should roll the dough into a ball and flatten down, but if you do this you should only bake 6 on the pan. These are definitely a crowd pleaser and I will make these over and over again!

Very good! Added 1 1/2 cups of flour instead, as someone suggested.  Make sure you bake for the full 12 minutes suggested, and not a minute longer, as this makes a difference in the chewiness.

A little too salty but overall really soft, chewy and good. I baked them for 15 minutes vs the suggested 12 to be fully cooked

These were great cookies. I followed this recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results. The cookies were nice and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy inside, just how we like them.

Excellent with a few alterations. Like the other reviewers, I found it best to add 1/2 cup of flour and reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. In addition, I felt like the first batch of cookies was missing something, so I turned to my oatmeal raisin cookie recipes and decided to add in 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. The cinnamon just adds a savory flavor to the cookies and makes them POP! I really enjoy soft, chewy cookies so I usually bake mine a few minutes less than the baking time in recipes. For these cookies, I found 8 - 9 minutes at 350 degrees to be the "sweet spot." As with any cookie, keeping them sealed tightly in a cool, dry location is the key to freshness. I also tend to add a slice of bread to maintain moisture. With the alterations, these didn't last long at our house!

I increased the flour by a 1/4 cup and reduced the baking soda by a 1/4 teaspoon. I also put half semi-sweet chocolate and half white chocolate chips and added about 1/3 cup of craisins. I call them my Black, White and Red Oatmeal Cookies! They were a huge hit at the office! Note: I had to raise the temp of my oven to 350 and it took about 20-25 minutes to cook; probably because the cookies were a little denser and didn't flatten as much as the original recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I've used it several times now and they've turned out great each time.  I've made a couple of modifications, one being I added 1/3 c more oatmeal and another time I added finely chopped walnuts and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. They're so good, I can even use them as bribes for my staff.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I have made it several times now and gotten tons of compliments each time. I did modify it very slightly by decreasing the salt to 1/2 tsp (the first time I made them they were just a bit too salty for our taste) and I use my "secret" ingredient of using only Guittard Milk Chocolate chips. But other than those personal taste substitutions, they are perfect! I also wanted to add my personal tip: chill your cookie dough for an hour if you can, then loosely shape into a balls and flatten them bit with your hand when you put them on the cookie sheet. This will prevent your cookies from flattening out and still give them a substantial "middle" worth biting into!

Took the suggestion of some of the others. I added a 1/4 cup more flour, doubled the baking soda, and halved the salt. I then refrigerated the dough for about an hour before baking. Turned out great!

I followed the comments by increasing flour 1/2c, cutting the salt in half and doubling the baking powder. I also omit the walnuts and double the chocolate chips. These are so delicious! They've made me obsessed with rolled oats. Chewy and soft but the oats make it crunchy at the same time. Yum yum yum have made three times in the last 2 weeks and will continue making them because they are so good!

I made these last night and I thought they were just OK. Pretty average oatmeal cookie definitely nowhere near the best oatmeal cookie ever. After reading a lot of these reviews it seems the people who loved this recipe so much changed quite a few things. They aren't really rating the recipe as is and rating a revised recipe. If the revised recipe is so much better someone please post that recipe instead! I would not make these cookies again I would try a different recipe next time.

Yum! Used shortening for butter (what I had on hand) and skipped nuts (didn't have any). Also added a dash of cinnamon, 1/2c flour and 1tsp baking soda as per other reviews. Baked mine exactly 12min @ 335 for perfectly crispy edges and chewy middles :) definitely a keeper!

These are absolutely delicious! you can totally add whatever you want to them too. I put trail mix in mine :) i gave four stars because for some reason, they didnt spread out. Im a "flat cookie" lover, but theyre still really good.

I tried this cookie and it was AMAZING! I made it during a baking competition with my friend and won! ?? I'm not sure if it was the oven or I did something wrong, but they took 25 minutes. Did this happen to anyone else?

This was my first time making this recipe and I absolutely loved it. Not only was it simple and easy to do, allowing me to get all my kids involved for a fun family baking night, but it was so delicious. Tomorrow we plan to make a few more batches to deliver to friends and family for the holiday season.

Really good cookie.  Easy to make.  No issues that were mentioned on the least positive posts (some said too much butter?  When is there ever too much butter, lol).  They do appear to be undercooked when taken out but they continue to back and become chewy cookies that are hard to resist.

I just made this recipe and had to leave a review....... One word, AMAZING!!!! I have never been good at baking cookies. They usually end of like mini hockey pucks. Not these. They came out delicious, gooey and super easy to make. The only change I made was using 1/2 teaspoon of salt and I kept them in for 14 min instead of the recommended 12 but I think it depends on the individual oven. Devouring them as we speak ;)

Did not like this cookie AT ALL. They did not flatten out, but they were bland and almost overly "chewy".

This was a very good recipe. The only thing that I changed about it was the amount if salt. I put half a teaspoon instead of a whole. Overall very scrumptious! :)

Made this and changed only a few things. Used on stick butter and 1/2 cup Apple sauce instead of two sticks of butter. 1 3/4 cup flour, 2tea baking soda, 1/2 tea salt, and no nuts so my 14month old could eat them. Yummy!!!

Delicious! Made the recipe as is, except cut back on the amount of salt (only used a dash) and used milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet. They turned out great! Soft and chewy, and the perfect amount of sweetness. Will definitely be making these again!

I made a few modifications, as suggested by other reviewers. I added 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 tsp of baking soda and only used 1/2 tsp of salt. I didn't use nuts and may have been generous with the chocolate chips (maybe 1/4 cup). For my oven, I only baked for 10 minutes and I used cooking spray because someone said theirs stuck, but I'm not sure it was needed. They were delicious! Made them for a girls cross country party and they were GONE; I had to hide a couple or I wouldn't have gotten any. Definitely will make these again!

I made the recipe as written and it either needs more flour or needs to chill before baking because these spread way too much. The recipe says to use an ungreased cookie sheet. These stuck terribly. And one cup of chocolate chips was not enough.

I wish I could rate this with zero stars. I am an avid baker and know what I am about in the kitchen, however this cookie recipe completely embarrassed me. I was looking for a great oatmeal cookie recipe and thought I had found it judging by the great reviews, but was clearly mistaken. I baked two sheets of cookies and ended up with two solid "sheets" of cookies....so disappointed and embarrassed.

This recipe made a great cookie! I added 1/4 cup flour and cut the salt in half, also I added 1/4 cup extra chocolate chips to make them extra chocolately. They turned out great, isn't flatten too much and ended up perfectly chewy with a little crisp around the edges!

these cookies are really really good.  I took the advice from others and added 1/2 c flour and 1/2 t baking soda. I also had to increase the cooking time by 4 minutes and they were really good!  next Time I will reduce the salt to 1/2 t because I use margarine.  I will also try the 1/2 c butter and 1\2 c applesauce version. this will be my go to recipe for my favorite type of cookies.

Too little flour and baking soda, the first dozen I baked were awful, luckily cookies can be forgiving. After I saw how far they were spreading and not rising, I read the comments. I tossed some more flour and baking soda into the dough.....I test baked one at 340 degrees (350 baked the edges too fast) and yes, it rose and stayed together.

I read reviews and  added 1/4 cup flour ,and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda; used only 1/2 teaspoon salt
Used milk chocolate chips; the cookies went fast!
These freeze very well; I reuse Kool Whip plastic tubs which will hold enough for a nice plate of the cookies.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed. The only thing I did differently was add my own favorites, 1 cup of butterscotch chips, handful of raisins & sliced almonds. I didn't have any walnuts so I substituted with sliced almonds.  When cookies were in the oven I started reading some of the reviews and noticed all the variations. My main concern was the salt! When I decided to make oatmeal cookies I saw that this recipe had a lot of stars and began making them because I had most of the ingredients on hand. Then realized as I was reading that many had issues on the cookies flattening and thus resulting in different variations. Many review talked about too much salt. I did not have any issues as I did make them exactly as instructed...including the salt and my butter had salt. Thank goodness they came out fantastic!  Baking with the right pans/ cookie sheets makes all the difference on your final results. I baked these cookies at 325*  I started timer for 10 min because every oven is different and I can usually tell by sight if they need to bake longer, but I always start with minimum time then continue checking every 2 min until ready. Then set cookies on cool racks immediately after.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing Panthera ;p

Like others, my first batch came out like pancakes.  I added another 1/4 cup of flour and 1 tsp of baking POWDER.  This alteration changed them perfectly to great cookies.  Due to there being a full cup of butter, I think the recipe needs more flour.

These came out ok.  Way too much tweaking for my taste. I followed the advice of others and increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups, and baking soda to 1 tsp.  I refrigerated the dough prior to baking.  When I baked them at 325 for 12 minutes they were no where near done, so I increased the temp to 350 and baked for about 15 minutes.  I thought the dough was quite dry and found that flattening out the dough when it was placed on the cookie sheet made for a better looking cookie and not so dense.  These are VERY FILLING!!  I'm a big cookie lover, and one was definitely enough for me.

A pretty good oatmeal cookie as written. Much better with the modifications mentioned by most reviewers.

Like others here, I added an additional 1/2 cup of flour and doubled the baking soda. I also didn't add nuts so I added a few more chocolate chips. RAVE REVIEWS!

Best cookies I've ever had! All I had was salted butter so I used 1/2 tsp salt instead of 1 tsp. Also, I used less sugar (1/4 cup white [except I used raw cane] and 3/4 packed brown). I probably didn't even need that much. I cooked them for 10 minutes instead of 12 and they're perfect. Crispy on the outside, soft in the middle.

All I can say is WOW! My family loved these cookies. My husband could not believe how good these cookies turned out. In the words of my five year old "ummm these are reallt good." I enjoyed making these cookies and eating them. I can't wait to make them again.

This was my very first time to bake cookies and I'm glad I had landed on this recipe because everyone loved its crispy-on-the-outside-chewy-on-the-inside texture! My daughter and I loved doing the recipe together and it's now our official favorite oatmeal choco chip cookie recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I gave the recipe 4 stars as it is written, but I think it is 5 with the changes I made. I followed others' suggestions and used 1 3/4 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp salt.  I used 1 cup wheat flour and 3/4 cup white flour, and I think I'll try all wheat flour next time. I also omitted the walnuts and added a 2nd cup of chocolate chips. I'm a chocolate lover, and 1 cup just didn't seem to be enough. I refrigerated the dough overnight, and baked them the next day for 14 minutes at 325. They were absolutely perfect. They hardly spread at all and rose up thick and chewy. I made them fairly small. I used a cookie scoop that is a little more than a tablespoon, and the cookies spread to about a 2 inch diameter and were 3/4 to 1 inch thick. Delicious! Everyone raved about them.

I have finally found the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. Recipe is great as is but truly amazing if you increase the flour/oats by 1/4 to 1/2 cup, half the salt, and double the baking soda.

This recipe came out perfect!  They are a good combination of crunchy and chewy.  I baked at 300 degrees because I do not want the bottoms to become too brown and it seemed to work perfectly for the same amount of time.

These tasted really good, but were pretty flat. I think it needed more flour, as in up the flour to about 2 cups. I also upped the baking temperature to 350 in hopes they would not flatten out as much and that did help.

I just made these cookies for my daughter.  I made only one change and that was to omit the walnuts and replace them with a cup of toasted coconut. These are excellent, thanks for the great recipe!

Mine turned out great! I didn't alter it except i only did a pinch of salt, and they ended up moist fluffy. They aren't a very sweet cookie, but still got many compliments on them.

Like others I added an extra 1/2 cup flour, used 1/2 t salt and 1 t baking soda. I also used old fashioned oats which gave it a chewier texture that I really enjoyed. The kicker though is I added a 1/2 t of cinnamon which made them over the top delicious! My husband inhaled them. I highly recommend this recipe

TOOOOO SWEET when I followed the recipe exactly, and came out flat. I added more flour as did most people, doubled the baking soda and added half a tsp of baking powder, NO SALT, used salted butter instead (another try I used no salt and regular butter and it was fine), also added more oatmeal to make the dough tougher (I like a dense cookie), and replaced the nuts with toffee. Now, every time I share these with clients and friends, they ask me where I ordered them from or if I could make a batch for them.

So good!  We added cinnamon to these as well as white chocolate chips and they are to die for :) Not one person whose tried them has said otherwise.  Mmm, thank you! We never altered anything else and they don't end up flat.  Just perfect!

I changed this around a little bit with a mistake that ended up being awesome! Decrease vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp and add 1/2 tsp of Almond Extract. Decrease salt to 1/2 tsp and added another 1/4 C. flour. I also used Dark Brown Sugar instead of light. The cookies turned out amazing with the Almond extract. They were the favorites of the two batches.

YUM!  My husband, who, admittedly, probably never met a cookie he didn't like absolutely RAVED about these.  They are so moist, tender and delicious.  The oatmeal lends a great texture and interest to a beloved flavor.  Thank you!
ADDENDUM 3/10/14:  My son, who is pretty much an anti-connoisseur when it comes to foods (i.e., thinks "Oreos" are the best cookies on the planet) told me "These cookies are the BEST!  Even better than OREOS!"

I modified theses cookies a little. I used 2 cups of oatmeal, and additional 1/2 cup of flour, and and additional 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I didn't have any walnuts so went I without them.  I ended up with a really great cookie. A little thicker than the original, and a little more chocolatey. They melt in you mouth!!!

Great recipe! I exchanged the butter for coconut oil and added shredded coconut and butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips! They were fantastic!

This recipe was definitely a hit with the kiddies! I did roll the dough into balls and placed them on the cookie sheets. This prevented from them getting all flat. They came out chewy and perfect!

I've made these cookies several times, we love them. The only thing I changed was the baking powder - 1 tsp instead of 1/2 tsp. Mix the butter and sugar really fluffy for a slightly lighter dough. Bake a normal size cookie only 12 minutes, they won't look brown on top, but they will stay chewy inside.

My husband made these tonight, they were amazing. He used white chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate(It's what we had in the pantry). I think the white chocolate really made them better. I will definitely be making these again.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1/4c. flour 1/2 tsp baking soda and used only 1/2 tsp salt. I also omitted the nuts. They turned out amazing!!! At twelve minutes they don't look fully cooked but resist the urge to let them go a few more minutes. Take them out and let them sit on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes. They finish cooking and are soo good. Lightly crispy around the edges and chewy, soft on the inside, they were exactly what I was looking for!

Today i m making a healthier version, so i m ok with replacing my butter, so not as fragrant as butter cookies. As usual, I reduced the sugar , used two pinch of salt, my butter was hard so replaced with margarine- was jus taking a bet with this. Again less margarine. No prob with flour perhaps cos already reduced other ingredients. Did not really measure the nuts n choc chips. used watever i had, as long as the dough looks good. Cookie not flat cos dough was too difficult to mix towards e end, ended using my hands, n my 3 year old had her hands on too! My version tasted more like an oatmeal cookie, with touches of walnuts n yummy choc chips. Oh n I used Quaker instant oats. Love it as its not very sweet for a snack n slightly chewy.

This recipe is delicious. Chewy and yummy. The only thing I altered was reducing the salt by half, otherwise I followed everything exactly. I did not have any issue with flat cookies or overcooked cookies or any of the other issues people have complained of. They were addictive, and I'm about to make a second batch.

These are easy and delicious. I did not change any ingredients. To prevent them from going flat, I avoided over mixing by stirring in the dry ingredients with a wooden spoon.

I made the changes that the others suggested - 1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 teaspoon more baking soda, and 1/2 a teaspoon less salt. It was good, but still a little over sweet. I think I would have liked some spices in it - cinnamon and something else, not sure what though :) Overall a nice recipe though and I would recommend it!

These are great.  I halved the recipe.  Only changes I made were adding cranberries (in place of nuts) and white chocolate chips (in place of chocolate chips).  I had an Ocean Spray cranberry and white chocolate cookie recipe, but I didn't like the texture of them.  These were much more to my liking.   I also added 1/8 cup extra flour (for a halved recipe, as suggested) and melted the butter before (wanted them chewier), and omitted the salt (used salted butter).   I let them sit over night in the fridge.  Cooked for 12 minutes @ 350.   They were not flat. They were chewy with slightly crispy ends. It made 2 dozen delicious cookies.

This recipe will become a staple for us. Did what others suggested. Took the flour to 1 ¾ cups, baking soda to 1 tsp but added my favorite spices: 2 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg and 1 tsp each of gr. cloves and allspice and raisins. Made them 2 hours ago and only a dozen remain. Thanks for the great base recipe.

I just made these about an hour ago, and they turned out great! They are so soft, they almost seem undercooked at just 12 minutes, but once they sit a bit they get more firm. 

Like some reviewers said, I made the modification of 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt. I also used a mix of white and semisweet chocolate chips. Even though the recipe calls for an ungreased baking sheet, I think it would work better with a little no-stick spray. I had a little trouble there, anyway. Excellent recipe! I will be making them again.

UPDATE: I had to give 5 stars. These cookies are the bomb! They stay super soft and moist. If you layer them in a container, place a paper towel between layers so they won't stick together.

This was a great recipe! I did make a few changes, mostly because I didn't have walnuts, and I didn't quite have 3 cups of oats, so I used 2 3/4 cups of oats, and then increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups instead and it worked out great! I only used a pinch of salt instead of the recommend amount and it was fine. They didn't flatten out at all and were crisp on the outside and chewy inside. I'd definitely make these again!

Easy recipe for a great tasting cookie. I added 2/3 cup chocolate chips, 2/3 cup craisins and 2/3 cup pecans. I also baked them a little longer than recipe required, which was good right out of the oven, but when it sat over night it became a little dry.

Everyone loved these! The only changes I made were increasing the flour to 1 3/4 c and omitting the walnuts because I was out. I made 20 LARGE cookies and baked them for 20 minutes a batch. They were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Delicious!

Wonderful! Reduced the salt by 1/2tsp, added 1/2tsp soda. Creamed butter and sugars then added dry ingredients by hand mixing. Kept the batter chilled for a while, turned out perfect! We also have tried add-ins such as toffee bits and coconut and they come out wonderful. A delicious and versatile cookie!

These cookies were awesome! I followed the reviews and added 1/2 cup of flour & 1/2 tsp of baking soda and omitted the salt as I used salted butter and they turned out awesome. They were soft and chewy and gobbled up by me, my husband and toddler daughter. I will be making these over & over!

We love these cookies! After reading the reviews and experimenting, I made a few changes. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, I increased the flour to 1 and 3/4 cups (1 cup white and 3/4 cup whole wheat), decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp and the rolled oats to 2 cups. I also use 1 tsp baking powder instead of soda, which began as a mistake, but I liked the result. I always chill the dough for a little while, and roll it into balls to cook it. I love all the vanilla.

I read the other reviews and also put my own spin on the recipe. I increased the flour by 1/4 cup. I use self rising flour so didn't add any additional salt or baking powder. I added 1/2 cup of shredded coconut. I substituted honey powder for the white sugar. I used Trader Joe's quick cook steel cut oats. They were incredible!

I made these today for a family dinner this evening. Oh my, Oh my. DEEEElish. I'd originally been looking for oatmeal raisin cookie recipe. However, going thru my pantry I discovered I'd had dried blueberries instead, and low and behold, dear hubby had once again raided my bakery pantry of every nut in site. Oh well. so I replaced nuts w dried blueberries, and kept everything else as it.. Yummmmmmy. thanks so much for this recipe

DELICIOUS!!  Followed what others suggested- added 1/2 c flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda (per recipe), and the cookies came out perfect. I had to double the recipe, as just making just 1 would not be enough to feed 3 cookie-hungry kids and a husband who is the same  ;)  I also used a small ice cream scoop so the cookies came out evenly sized.  Will definitely be making these again

Super yummy cookies. A great success every time I bake them. If you want a healthier version  that still yummy, use wheat flour and no white sugar. I sometimes mix in a little flax seed :)

Fantastic, wouldn't change a thing.  Try to keep to the baking time, despite them looking uncooked - this is what makes them so chewy.

I was really disappointed by these. I made all of the adjustments that everyone recommended - more flour, more baking soda, beating the sugar butter for a long time and then just hand mixing in the dry ingredients - and my cookies still flatten out and were overcooked around the edges. I added even more flour (over what all of the comments suggested) with each batch and they got a bit better, but they just weren't that good. I love oatmeal and chocolate cookies and was really disappointed by this recipe.

This is a keeper! Great cookie! My first batch ended up a little flat but the rest were fine. I would recommend reading the reviews and adding a little more flour and baking soda. And don't overmix. I used milk chocolate chips since that's what I had on hand.

I made these cookies with the recommended changes and they were great just out of the oven (after cooling)! I would add more chocolate chips though, because there was plenty of crunch with the oatmeal and the walnuts, but it should be balanced out with gooey chocolate. Nothing wrong with that, right? :)

Halved the recipe and excluded the walnuts and chocolate chips because I didn't have them and seriously...this cookie was insanely delicious. They werent too flat either. Next time I will make the whole amount and bring them in to work because this deliciousness is too good not to share.

I bake cookies a lot for my husband, he's a chocolate chip cookie fanatic. I tried these to change it up a bit. FANTASTIC. I halved the salt, added 1/2 more oats and used dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet and whole wheat flour instead of white flour. My attempt at making them healthier. I always refrigerate my cookie dough for at least a few hours (and up to 24). This keeps the cookies from getting too flat. Yum! I've made a half recipe of these too. Worked out great and kept me from over snacking.

I love this recipe.  They didn't turn out flat as some people stated.  The only change I made was another 1/4 c of flour and more chocolate chips (cuz you always need more chocolate).  I had a request for chewy oatmeal chip cookies and that is what I ended up with.  Will make again!

Love this recipe!! Substituted coconut sugar for both the white and brown sugar; substituted flaked coconut for the walnuts. I increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups and the baking soda to 1 teaspoon. I let the eggs and butter come to room temperature before using and used parchment paper over a chilled cookie sheet. Will definitely make again!!

This was a great cookie recipe.  I'm not much of a baker, but gave this a shot.  I'm pleasantly suprised how good they came out.  Followed the recipe to a T, except on the salt addition I only added a couple of dashes, due to using salted butter. Plus, replaced flour with wheat flour. This recipe is a keeper.

I've made this a couple times now, and It is supperrr delicious! Although I did minimize the amounts of sugar because it was kind of too sweet the first time i made it.  I also added in some white chocolate morsels as well and they taste really delicious! Nice and chewy when cooled off.

I thought I scaled this recipe for half the original amount, but said 24 cookies, I should have realized I made a mistake when it came up with some odd measurements. How does 2 eggs become 1 1/4, 3 cups oatmeal become 1 2/3 and 1 cup walnuts become 2/3 plus 1 T and 1 tsp?  So I changed those to the proper amounts.  I did leave the others the way they had been scaled by the computer.  They are very tasty and didn't go flat at all.  In fact, they were a little fatter than I thought they should be.  They were very tasty and we enjoyed them.  I may try them again just as oatmeal walnut and add a bit of cinnamon.

I make them with Dark Chocolate Chips and Whole Wheat flour - so I feel like I'm indulging yet being healthy!  I made them for a work-Holiday party and my boss was shocked he had 5 in less than 10 min!!

I have made this recipe a lot over the last few months and everyone who eats them just RAVES over them. I make them to the T of the recipe and they always turn out delicious. If your cookies turn out flat, try adding a little more flour and don't make the scoops on the cookie sheet as large. Regardless of whether mine puff out or flatten, my friends still devour them as though it were their last meal on earth.

Boy are these GREAT!  I thought I was in trouble when I saw 3 cups of oatmeal and only 1 cup of chocolate chips--but my whole family thought they were delicious!  I did follow the advise of those who suggested adding more flour and soda.  I also dumped in another 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  They are truly outstanding!

Great recipe! I was making cookies for a party and accidentally ran low on supplies. So, I searched for a recipe that would help me stretch what I had and I stumbled across this recipe. The oatmeal enabled me to make a much larger batch than I would have of regular chocolate chip cookies. The cookies were a hit! I've made them again since; I don't always have the same results (sometimes they are flatter than other times) but they are always delicious and popular. I've omitted the walnuts each time I've made them.

These have a very good texture and taste. They will please both the chocolate chip cookie lover and the oatmeal cookie lover as they are a cross between the two cookies. However, they are a bit sweet for my taste with the chocolate chips. I will definitely use this recipe again but I will put in the classic raisins instead of the chocolate chips.

This was simply the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe that I have EVER made!  My picky toddlers LOVED them and so did my husband and I.  I slightly altered the recipe with things others recommended.  I increased it to a tsp of baking soda and heaping 1 1/2 cups flour.  I also used a heaping cup of chocolate chunks instead of chips.   This recipe will remain in my collection for a very long time!  Thank you!

These are good but I agrees with everyone else. There is too much SALT in this recipe. I can slightly taste it in the cookies. I will cut it in half next time. I also used Old Fashion Oats and it worked just fine. 325 degrees for 12 minutes is NOT enough cook time!! They are still raw. I cooked mine for 15-17min at 325 degrees and they turned out perfect!

I'd been looking for a oatmeal chocolate chip recipe with an end result that tasted something like the wonderful cookies that were made at a school I went to many years ago. This is that recipe. I was initially skeptical about the amount of oats the recipe called for but after an attempt with significantly less oats, the original amount is absolutely necessary for the best tasting cookies.

These were good cookies - I made them tonight for a friend's birthday. While there was nothing wrong with the taste, the cookies weren't exceptional, either. Nothing really special in the flavor... I also found that the texture was much better when I increased the cooking time by 2 to 3 minutes. The cookies came out crisp on the edges rather than crumbly, which was an improvement since mine were pretty flat. I might try these again with added spices or with other reviewers' adjustments. Thanks for a good basic recipe!

Made this recipe minus the nuts and it was delicious. Since all I had on hand was salted butter I reduced the amount of salt by half. I put the batter in the fridge for about 1/2 an hr (because I had something else baking) and they were so yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

Too salty, but I guess I could have used unsalted butter. Texture was great, but for a little extra crisp, I added a few minutes to the cooking time here in the Rocky Mountains. Thank You for sharing this recipe. Next time I will use less salt, & more sugars.

I also changed the recipe and added more flour and oats. I was nervous when the dough was a little runny/sticky, but the dough rises in the oven and they end up having a very nice shape.

These came out chewy and were pretty good. It was my first time baking oatmeal cookies. I followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the portion of baking soda and flour. I also used applesauce in place of half of the butter and omitted 30g of sugar since I did a batch with raisins and the other with dark chocolate chips. I find that the addition of fruit or chocolate allows me to reduce the sugar called for in a recipe, but this is a personal preference.

Fabulous little cookies! I used butterscotch chips instead of walnuts but otherwise followed the instructions as written, they turned out beautifully! Most likely to become a holiday staple in our home!

Made these with what I had on hand which required a few substitutions, but they turned out great. I used half butter/half Crisco and old fashioned oats rather than quick oats. I also mixed butterscotch chips with chocoate using up what was in the cupboard. Will need to put these in the freezer or else they will all be gone by tomorrow.

Based on recommendations, I increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups, and the baking soda to 1 tsp. Otherwise I followed this exactly and they were wonderful!  If you are looking for a thick chunky cookie, this is it!

Good recipe base, but I made a few changes to cater to my dairy-free guests and these cookies came out fabulous! Like the others, I used 1.5cups flour, 1t baking soda, and cut the salt to 1/2t. Instead of the butter I used 1/2cup shortening and 1/2cup applesauce and added 1t cinnamon. You can get dairy-free chocolate chips at specialty food stores too. I ate one of these cookies and couldn't believe how delicious they were!

These cookies are great! I make them so much and they always come out perfect. The only thing I've done to change them is put the dough in the fridge for a few hours or overnight, and I roll the dough  into a ball, and then flatten it into a disk. I still cook them for 12 minutes, and they are no flatter when I take them out then they were when I put them in.

These are amazing cookies!  We've made them just as the recipe suggested and have gone through several batches already.

WONDERFUL flavor but more crisp than chewy.  Good if you like a crisper cookie.  Definitely flatten balls before baking, these don't spread.  Will make again!

Fantastic recipe!  Baked my first batch today and it turned out wonderfully.  Followed the suggestion of 1 tsp of baking soda, cutting the salt to 1/2 tsp and 1 3/4 C of flour.  I didn't have brown sugar so I used 1 1/2 C total of white sugar with 2 1/2 Tblsp of molasses.  It gave it a nice dark color.  Not a fan of nuts so used 2 C of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  DELICIOUS!

I wish I had read the reviews before making these!  Definitely a 5 star recipe if not for the salt!  These were way too salty, next time I will reduce the salt by half.  Other than that they are great - I used the amount of flour and baking soda listed in the recipe and the cookies came out soft and chewy and rose perfectly.

My husband gives this recipe 10 stars out of 5!  The cookies are a little crisp on the outside, soft and chewy inside.  Delicious with or without nuts. I omitted the salt (I rarely add it to desserts).  Following the suggestions of others, I use 1 tsp baking soda, 1-1/2 cups flour, chilled a bit before baking, and baked at 335.  I baked my first tray for 13 minutes, but 12 makes an even better texture- leaving the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes finishes the cooking nicely.

We used whole wheat flour, and salted butter, and white chocolate chips: they came out AMAZING!  Chewey, sweet and lightly salty!  Ours baked for 17 minutes, as we made larger sized cookies.  Fast, easy, and delicious.

It's a great recipe overall as it produces a good oatmeal cookie. You can tweak the ratio of the add ins like the chocolate and coconut (omitted the nuts) to suit your tastes. I would recommend keeping the total volume of the add ins the same.

My own changes:
-used 1.5 sticks of butter
-chilled the dough for 30 mins (or overnight even) to produce a chubbier cookie

oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are by far my favorite cookie ever. this recipe is so simple and the cookies turned out delicious. i omitted the nuts since my bf doesn't like nuts in anything but i will make some with nuts eventually for myself. great recipe will use over again and again and again.

Fantastic!  Naturally we had a few changes.  Didn't add chocolate chips.  Added 2 cups of freshly grated coconut plus the coconut water from it.  Chopped 6 dates small and tossed in. Used pecans in place of walnuts, and used 2 cups of large oats in place of 3 cups of quick-cook oats.  All of the changes because this was what was in the house, but omg, fantastic!!  Thank you Panthera, fabulous recipe :)

These were so easy to make and such a hit! I took someone's suggestion and added another half a cup of oats, and cut down on the salt to 1/2 tsp, left the batter in the fridge for  about 15 minutes prior to baking and the cookies came out perfectly 12 min later. And I don't even know just how many batches it made - 3 1/2? My boyfriend probably inhaled 7 cookies in a matter of minutes and claims not to be a 'sweets person.' But you could have fooled me. Another friend couldn't believe I made them and couldn't stop complimenting. I will definitely be making these as a 'go to' cookie when the inspiration strikes again.

These needed 15+ minutes to bake, at 350 degrees. The first batch was raw still at 12 minutes at 325. Other than that, these were OK.

These are absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS! I've made them at least 5 times now, and all my coworkers and students are "nuts" about them! :)

Fun Variant: Substitute 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips for 1/2 cup chocolate chips for a tasty twist on this already fabulous recipe!

As suggested by others I increased the the flour by 1/2 cup, increased the baking soda by 1/2 tsp, and cut the salt by 1/2 tsp. I also used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. unsalted butter. I used a bag of milk chocolate chips and no walnuts. I baked at 335 degrees for 12 minutes and they were wonderful. I left them on the baking sheets after I took them out of the oven for an additional 5 minutes. Perfect! Will definitely bake them again!

Excellent Cookie that did not go flat.  I did reduce the salt ( i do in most recipe's ) and increased the baking soda but left the flour alone.  They had great texture and cooked nicely without falling.  I will next time try changing it up and adding cranberries and orange zest or maybe dried apricot and apple pie spice :)

These are really good!  I realized a bit late that I only had half the called for butter, so I added some applesauce and no nuts but other than that I followed the directions.  Mine came out really round, not flat at all, but very good. Oh, and I halved the salt.  It doesn't need it.  The only thing is that I got no where near 42 cookies.  More like 28 and they weren't huge.  I can't imagine a cup of nuts made that much difference.

Here's what I did based on some of the comments I read: I used 1 1/2 C of Whole Wheat flour instead of white (gotta have something good in a cookie); cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon; increased soda to 1 tsp. and set the oven at 375. the recipe made about 48 delicious cookies that did not spread. I baked for just over 12 min. because I perfer my cookes a bit crunchy vs chewy. Someone suggested adding coconut- I think I will try doing this next time.
Good recipe- will definatly make again.

Followed the directions exactly and they turned out PERFECT. However I did add a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and did not have the nuts to add. Then with the oats I did grind them down in my food processor, this is the ultimate trick! I also tried to make balls on the tray to get that perfect shape, put the dough in the fridge for a few minutes to get it hard. This is my go to cookie recipe.

I'd rate as 4.5 out of 5.  Just added more baking soda and omitted salt as others suggested since my butter is salted.  Baked at 325 for 12 minutes.  They rose nicely, didn't run, chewy, perfect!  I omitted nuts for friends with allergies.  Overall, a keeper!  Awesome.

This is in reference to some concerns I've seen in the reviews.  For the butter lovers:  If you use salted butter, only use 1/2 tsp. of salt in the recipe because a stick of salted butter has 1/4 tsp. of salt in it  already.  Also, if you don't want your cookies to spread out, don't use butter.... use shortening.  Butter has a very low melting point and the cookies spread out before the binding takes place.  Shortening makes higher, more full, chewy cookies.  Hope this helps.  By the way, loved the cookies.

I did not care for this recipe. I see other people also had to alter this recipe. Take it down and stop wasting people's time. Chewy? More like FLAT AND HARD!

Phenomenal cookies! Beware! Very addicting :)
I added 1/4 cup flour (2 cups total) and 1/2 tsp. baking soda (1 tsp. total). I also took out 1/2 tsp. salt (1/2 tsp. total). These were delicious!

I, too, refrigerated the dough before baking and they did not flatten which I liked. They were moist and chewy which I also liked but they did not have enough flavor for me. I did not add the connamon as suggested by some so might try this again and do that. They needed something more for the flavor to get bumped up.

Didn't come out that good.  Very hard and also didn't flatten out much at all.  I will maybe try again with a lower oven setting and less time.

I was trying to get rid of all the leftover holiday baking ingredients and knew I had the perfect pantry for this particular cookie. My husband and I had to hang onto the countertop when we decided to sample a cookie straight from the cookie sheet. Delicious! Super easy recipe that delivers a tantalizing treat to your tastebuds. I used about half of the recommended salt and 2.5 cups of oats.  I made sure not to overmix to avoid getting a flat cookie. I also used baking powder vs. baking soda (not sure what the big difference is). I came out with "perky cookies," and not a single flat cookie in the bunch. Enjoy!

5/5 if you follow other users' suggestions about altering the flour, salt, and baking soda.  Salt is not necessary if you use regularly salted butter (add just a pinch if using unsalted butter).  I made mine gluten-free  - replaced the flour in the recipe (using sugggestion of 1 3/4 cups) using two flour blends: 1 cup of white rice flour/tapioca flour/potato startch/ blend and 3/4 cup brown rice flour/garbanza bean flour/tapioca flour/potatoe starch blend. Remember to add xanthum gum (3/4 tsp) if making these GF.

I am making these now and so far they are fabulous!! My adjustments were to use 1 tsp of baking powder instead of soda(by accident, oops), I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and oatmeal, I only used a dash of salt, I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, a package of dried cranberries, and a bag of white chocolate chips.  I will say I probably used too many chocolate chips. Next time, will use only 1/2 a bag.  I made them into small balls and they are not spreading much. They are staying very high. My kids tried them and LOVE them.  They are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, at least for now.  We'll see how they hold up.  Because I rolled them in small 1 inch balls, I was able to get 104 cookies.  I like to make them small for the cookie trays.  Hope this helps!!  Enjoy!!

Excellent recipe.  Excellent cookie.  Tried two changes for a more healthy cookie:  used 1 1/2 cups of Sucanat sugar in place of the white and brown sugar, and used Spelt flour in place of white flour.

Amazing. Read the comments about this being too salty after I'd already made my dough, but the salt felt right to me. I was out of white flour and used all wheat. Left the walnuts out. Divine, divine.

Delicious. I used coconut instead of walnuts since I didn't have, and i'll do that again. I followed someone's advise about the baking soda, but won't do that again. 1 tsp was too much and I could taste it, and my cookies didn't flatten out at all.

These cookies were fabulous!  It makes a big batch and I gave half away or I would've eaten them all myself!  They got rave reviews from kids and adults alike.  I followed a few adjustments... increased the flour and the soda and decreased the salt.  Baked at 335 for 12 minutes and....fabulous!

My favourite oatmeal cookie recipe yet! I followed the other suggestions to increase baking soda to 1tsp, and increase flour to 1 3/4 cup. I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's all I had, but I toasted them first which gives a richer flavour. I also mildly chopped the chocolate chips so pieces aren't as huge and the chocolate flavour is more subtle in the cookies. I reduced the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup also; I find 1 cup too sweet. 

The first time I made these, friends came over the day after and all of the cookies disappeared! They are a hit!

I followed some of the suggestions to change the recipe but I didn't like the way they came out.  They were rather bland so I added a little cinnamon but they were still just so-so.  It may have been user error so I might try again at some point.

I made these today for the first time. They are for Thanksgiving, so I didn't have time to mess them up. I noticed Everyone's review said they adjusted the flour. So I tweaked the recipe to 1 1/2 cups of flour. I also added about 1/3 cup extra oats. The cookies came out perfect! They rose great and are very tasty. The next time I make these though, I will use milk chocolate chips. I think the semisweet ones did not taste as good with the oats as milk chocolate would have. I will be making these again!

I found these cookies too cake-like. I read other reviewers suggestions of increasing flour to 1 1/2 cup flour and decreasing the salt. I didn't increase the baking soda, so maybe that would have made a difference too. Not my favorite-probably will not make again.

I'm so sad.  These taste great but they came out flat as a pancake.  I followed the directions and only deviated from the recipe by what was recommended from others: I added another 1/2 cup of flour and used a full teaspoon of baking soda. I also cut out the salt because I used salted butter.  I'm not a wiz in the kitchen so I was bummed when they didnt come out as lovely as I had read from others.  Still, I'm sure my husband will still eat them up!

These are amazing, maybe the best cookies I ever made! They have the perfect amount of everything. They didn't flatten out at all for me, possibly because I mixed them completely by hand. I also added about 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Will definitely be making these again!

Great cookie!! I had no problems at all with the recipe. I followed the steps and ingredients exactly, and my cookies didn't turn out flat like other reviewers said. Just scoop heaping spoons on the baking sheet, don't flatten them, and they will be perfectly baked after 12 minutes :-)

These were so good! I added half cup extra flour and half teaspoon of baking soda and reduced salt as other reviews suggested. I also added half tsp of cinnamon and used pecans instead of walnuts because that's all I had. I made half without chocolate chips. I can't decide which I liked better! So good. My three year old loved them too!

I made this recipe (minus salt, used 1/2 Earth Balance and 1/2 coconut oil, and a little less sugar) substituting 1 1/4 cups of Bella gluten free all purpose flour mix for the flour. They turned out awesome!!! Gluten Free and Dairy Free!!

I would love to do 4.5 stars, because this recipe is THAT good. Almost perfect. I added 1tsp of cinnamon (a must in oatmeal for me). Also, after I saw how loose the batter was before i added the oats, I did add 1/4c more flour and 1/4 tsp baking soda, with those additions & bumping temp up to 335 they were PERFECT. After the 1st batch (which was a gift), i immediately made a second for my family. The only difference was, I used 2 sticks of margarine, because of dairy allergy, 2nd batch was 1 stick butter and 1 stick margarine. That was the only difference, and they totally FLATTENED OUT. Very dissapointing! So, butter totally made the difference, had to refrigerate the dough and turn the oven down. They did taste great flat, I just prefer a more rounded cookie.

Just made these and they're pretty good. Many people are complaining that these cookies came out flat. Mine were not flat at all. I mixed in the oats and let the mix sit while I chopped up the walnuts. I think that made the difference In the end result. Enjoy.

Amazing! I cut the amount of brown sugar almost in half, used only a pinch of salt, and added more flower like suggested by others. I didn't use nuts, just chocolate and oats. (I blended the oats to get a more smooth texture). They turned out amazing! I will make these again for sure. They were a huge hit with my family.

Came out kinda flat, next time I'll add 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and no salt and it should come out fine. Had to cook an extra 5-10 minutes though, don't actually do 'heaping spoonfuls'.

These are just what I was looking for, a chewy cookie just crisp on the edges. I substituted pecans for the walnuts and added a 1/3 cup of coconut.

This is a really good cookie. I don't understand what's wrong with a flat cookie. It's really good just the way the recipe is written.  Out of necessity I changed some stuff. Didn't have brown sugar, subbed granulated plus molasses. Didn't have walnuts, subbed pistachios. Didn't have plain oatmeal, subbed apple cinnamon oatmeal. It's all good :-)

I made this recipe for a house full off finicky- cookie lovers. I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour as well as an extra 1/2 tsp of baking soda and the recipe turned out ABSOLUTLY PERFECT!!  I would also like to recomend some cooling time in the fridge to keep the dough from spreading too much. Mine were perfectly round and chewy!

I followed the directions mostly but didn't use nuts, doubled the chocolate chips, and used Splenda instead of the white sugar and the only thing that didn't work out well for me was the cooking directions.  I tried to put the dough on in heaping spoonfuls for 12 minutes at 325 but they came out a bit doughey.  After the first batch I made my spoonfuls smaller, upped the temp to 350 and left them in for 15 minutes.  Those batches came out much better.  Because of this it gets four stars.  Good recipe and definitely usable with these changes.

Love this recipe!!! Easy, quick and delicious. My kids don't like nuts, so I use 2 cups of mini chocolate chips. Makes a great chocolate to cookie ratio.  :)

These cookies are delicious...I took the advice of others and increased the flour to 1 3/4c, the baking soda to 1 tsp, and the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I also used 1/2 cup pecans, and 1/2 cup walnuts instead of the full 1 cup walnuts.  Subsitituted 1 cup butter flavored Crisco Baking Stick instead of Butter, so the flavor would still be there but with 50% less saturated fat. Baked them for 12 minutes at 335 deg.  Used a mini ice-cream scooper and rolled into balls before placing on baking sheet covered with parchement paper. These are fantastic! Will definitely make again.

Amazing!  I took the suggestions about adding more flour and baking soda, then decreasing the salt.  Turned out great!  Took them to work and they were gone in less than an hour.

wow these were amazing! But I used others' suggestions and upped the flour to 1 3/4 cup, upped the baking powder to 1 tsp, and lessened the salt to 1/2 tsp. I omitted the walnuts cause I didn't have any but these came out soooooooooo good. I think 13-14 minutes bake time is better because mine came out a little underdone.

super super yummy. omitted the nuts & used 1.5 cups wheat flour and 1 tsp. baking soda (per other reviews). used baking splenda instead of white sugar. also put the whole bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips (about 2 cups instead of the 1 cup that is called for). hubby is in love with these cookies!! this will be my go-to recipe for chocolate chip oatmeal cookies from now on!

This recipe turned out really dry.  I didn't think they were very good.  The next day they seemed better than when first out of the oven which seems odd to me.  I wouldn't recommend these.

Yum! I followed the suggestions to increase the flour, salt, and baking soda amounts.  The cookies came out thick, soft, and soooo good.  Next time, I'll put in the whole bag of choc chips.  Great recipe

These cookies are amazing, and should be given 5 stars, but I made some changes as others suggested. I added 1/4c flour, and omitted the salt (because my butter is salted). I also used old fashioned oats, as I didn't have any quick-cook oats. But my cookies turned out *perfectly*- soft and chewy and a little crunchy around the edges. And they did not flatten out at all- make sure you mix the wet ingredients with the blender for 4-5 mins, and only *just* incorporate the dry ingredients. I threw my dough in the fridge until I had time to bake them, and I am so so so glad with how they turned out. This will be the only oatmeal chocolate chip cookie I ever make again!

Great recipe! I've never made oatmeal cookies before but after a friend made the same recipe and liked them, I decided to give them a try for my boyfriend's birthday. He doesn't love super sweet deserts and cookies, and I don't like nuts, so I doubled the chocolate chip amount and used dark chocolate. Sneaked 1 cookie in the oven before I make the entire batch tomorrow  and it turned otu great! I followed other suggestions and added a 1/2 cup of flour and a 1/2 tsp of baking soda. I don't know what they would have been like without this adjustment, but I loved them with it! I think next time I might use 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 dark chocolate chips, but overall an easy great recipe!

These are soft and chewy!  I did make some changes.  I omitted the salt, used baking powder instead if soda and added a bit of cinnamon.  I also left out the walnuts and added extra chocolate chips.  The result were nice fluffy, soft cookies!  Definitely will make again!

Delicious! Used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, added a dash of cinnamon, added about 1/4 cup of ground flax, used only 1/2 cup of butter and substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the rest of the butter.  Will be making regularly!

Really nice cookies, found they needed a bit longer in the oven as didn't seem cooked enough after 12mins. I didn't have the problem with over spreading that other reviewers mentioned but I used standard rolled oats rather than the finer quick cook oats.

I made a half batch and, other than omitting the nuts, followed the recipe exactly.  These cookies were insanely delicious...perfectly moist, chewy, and flavorful.  I did think they were a bit heavy on the salt (and I used unsalted butter), but I *like* being able to taste a bit of salt in most cookies.  If you don't, you could probably halve the amount and be okay.

I feel a bit sheepish...I wanted to wait a few days so I could include the cookies' longevity in my review.  As I said, I made a half batch, and it was just for my husband and me, and, well...the cookies didn't last more than a few hours in our home.  Whoops!  :)

Was looking for something reminiscent of childhood..this is a great recipe.. I put !/2 shortening and 1/2 butter..flattens them out a bit, but if you chill the dough for an hour before baking they hold their shape much nicer.

Excellent recipe! The only things I modified were the amount of chocolate chips (1/2 cup more), the time to bake (14 minutes instead of 12), I didn't have vanilla extract so I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract, I used Filbert nuts instead of walnuts and I skipped the eggs and added the vegan version instead and used 1/4 cup of apple sauce x2. I also used Earth Balance Buttery Sticks instead of real butter. These were so delicious and very chewy!

Very solid cookie when you just want the basics.  I followed everyone's advice and added extra flour and baking soda.  Delish!  They weren't flat and they stayed chewy.  I'm not sure they will be my go-to cookie but I will be keeping the recipe.

This cookie was excellent.  Very easy to make, didn't even have to use my mixer.  They were chewy that night and what was left went into the fridge and they were nice and crunchy!  Used half of salt and did 2 cups of flour.

If you follow this recipe exactly you will get delicious cookies. I like to modify the recipe a little. I cook at 335 and use extra dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet.

These were really good! I halfed the batch but added more then half of the chocolate chips. I then stuck the batter in the freezer for 5 minutes to firm up. Then used a 1/4 a cup measurement to scoop them on the pan. Also I baked them for 17 minutes instead of 12. (:

These were delicious!  I made them almost exactly to recipe except I added a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon because oatmeal cookies just taste better with it to me.  I did chill the dough for an hour or so before baking.  I did not have any issues with the cookies spreading out thin.  And do make sure you let them cool on the sheets as the recipe tells you to do.  It makes the difference between beautiful chewy cookies, and a crumbled mess.

phenomenal cookie. fluffy with a crispy bottom with a moist chewy center. i used half light/half dark brown sugar because i ran out of light, and used pecans in lieu of walnuts. after reading other reviews,  i made sure not to over mix the dough, mixing for a total of 2-3 minutes all inclusive.  did heaping tablespoons which didn't spread too much, stayed thick and moist. because of this, i baked for 13 minutes instead of 12 and they turned out excellent!  thank you for this recipe!

I read some reviews before trying these cookies out... added 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup oats, 1/2 tsp baking soda and only used 1/2 tsp salt, and made sure not to over mix. I also chilled the dough for 2 hours. The cookies were PERFECT! They didn't flatten AT ALL, were nice and chewy, and tasted fantastic! I used half a cup of semi sweet chips, and then chopped up two Dairy Milk chocolate bars. Incredible!

First of all, I made the following alterations:
1/2 tsp. sea salt
1/2 cup olive oil (I didn't have enough butter!)
11.5 oz. MILK chocolate chips (1 bag)
Bake 18 minutes

Secondly, this recipe is awesome! 

I'm surprised that some people had trouble with spreading (altitude maybe?) because my batter was so thick that I had to roll up my sleeves and work the last cup of oatmeal and chocolate chips in by hand; there was no way the stuff would stir. In the oven, the cookies did not spread at all, but rather puffed up a bit.

I'm pretty sensitive to things that are too salty, so even though I didn't use butter, I still cut Panthera's amount of salt in half per other reviewers' recommendations.

I'm sampling a cookie right now, and it's chewy, perfectly proportioned, and not too dense/heavy. I'm a "dunker" and it's great dipped in milk...it gets soft, but doesn't fall apart which is something I was worried about since the cookies are a bit on the crumbly side. Glorious.

The flavor is amazing. As long as you don't use a SUPER strong/aromatic/olive-y olive oil, you can't even tell that there's no butter. Even if you do use strong EVOO (like I did) you can taste it very slightly but it's not unpleasant...it's interesting and doesn't take away from the awesomeness at all! In fact, at first I wasn't so sure, but other cookie connoisseurs who sampled olive oil cookies actually preferred them over the cookies with butter!

All in all (even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly)...A+!

I took zestygirl's advice and altered the recipe, I added about 3/4 c less oats as well. They are very yummy, still a little salty, next time I may try only 1/4 tsp of salt, and they needed about 15-17 min in my oven. All in all a nice easy cookie!

note to self: make recipe as written by author BEFORE being so blazen (stupidly presumptuous??) by switching things up according to various reviews.
i immediately added the 1/4 more cup of flour since everyone said that the dough was too wet and the cookies too flat - possibly a bad idea since the resulting cookie was a touch too crumbly.
anyway, the cookies taste GREAT and i def had no problem with a flat product; if anything, they spread out too little.
i put raisins in instead of chocolate (had no choco on hand) and used unsalted butter, so that the tsp of added salt is perfect, not overpowering.
really good and next time i'll try them exactly as written, although perhaps hiking the temperature up to 350?
thanks for a yummy cookie.

I used an extra 1/2 cup flour (whole wheat) and 1 tsp soda as suggested by others.  Next time I will use only 1/4 cup extra four.  I also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce to cut calories.  I omitted the walnuts (personal peference).  I tried some with raisins and would recommend sticking with chocolate chips.  Next time I will add an extra 1/2 choc chips and cut down the oats by a heaping 1/4 cup.  Mine turned out so thick and didn't flatten at all.

I increased the flour by a half cup and the baking soda by a 1/2 tbsp as others suggested and decreased the salt.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (highly recommend) and left the nuts out.   I used a bag of milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  I also put the dough in the refrigerator, and then let the cookies finish cooking for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet once I took them out of the oven.  They turned out perfect!  This recipes also doubles well.  I froze the extra cookie dough and then when making my next batch, I let the dough defrost for about 20 minutes on the counter.  I then cut up the dough and rolled into balls.  It had to cook for 14 min instead of 12, but the frozen dough turned out to make the the best cookies I ever had.  Really can't even describe how good these cookies are.

Very yummy!  I followed some of the advice of the other reviewers by adding the extra flour, baking soda, using apple sauce in place of half the butter and omitting the salt.  We were out of choc chips, so I ran a bag of hershey kisses through the food processor.  My input...I chilled the wet mixture while making the dry mix and chopping the choc.  Because of the small amount chilling, it chilled extremely well and quickly.  I also returned the bowl to the frig during each baking time.  Also, like one reviewer, I set the oven at 325.  They turned out perfectly and taste healthy enough to let my one year have a few as well.

The absolute BEST oatmeal cookies ever!  Like some others, I also added the extra 1/2 cup of flour and extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  I followed Marie C.'s directions and creamed the butter and sugar 4-1/2 minutes, and then stirred the dry ingredients in by hand.  For the chocolate chips, I used 1-1/2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1-1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips, and omitted the nuts.  I used a large scooper (the one I use for making muffins) to scoop the dough onto my baking sheets, and baked them at 335 degrees for 15 minutes.  They came out fluffier than any oatmeal cookie I've ever made!  It only made 33 large cookies, but they are fabulous!

These were pretty tasty!  I followed the other reviews and increased the flour and baking soda and subbed raisins instead of walnuts.  Delicious!  I think I might decrease the sugar a tad next time to compensate for the sweetness of the raisins.

Just ok.  Turned out a little flat (even after I placed dough in fridge.)  Added 1 tsp of baking soda, instead of 1/2.  And added another 1/4 cup of flour.

I gave this 4 stars because it needed modifications.  I used - an extra 1/4 cup of flour, and a full tsp. of baking soda like the recomendations.     I tried this recipie 2x. The first time, I used softened butter as per the recipie. They were good, but they were VERY thick, took 18 minutes to bake, and did'nt stay chewy.   The secont time, I melted the butter.  The cookies flattened into proper cookie shape, and they've stayed wonderfully chewy!  Moral of this story, MELT THE BUTTER!

I, too, followed the recipe. I'm not one to adjust without first giving the original a go. Whoops. They were flat, crunchy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and relatively tasteless. I don't think I can make enough adjustments to this recipe.

I wouldn't say it was the best oatmeal cookie I've ever had, but it was quite good, especially for having a high oat content.  I halved the recipe, but kept the proportions the same (except the salt, but I always cut the salt by half in basically any cookie recipe I make).  No problems with flatness at all.  I creamed the butter & sugar really, really well (about 5 minutes), then just mixed enough to combine when adding flour/soda/salt, oats & chips.  I also omitted nuts due to an allergy in the family.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the flour by 1/2 cup, baking soda by a 1/2T, and decreased the salt to 1/2tsp.  Also made sure to cream butter, sugar, and eggs together until fluffy before hand-stirring dry ingredients in.  After baking for exactly 12 min I removed cookies immediately from baking sheet...waiting for 5 min would've left them overdone.  Also, I chilled the dough in the fridge in between filling baking sheets, this seemed to help keep from spreading.  Easy recipe with a great balanced flavor and good texture!

Fabulous! Followed others' suggestions and added extra 1/2 c flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda. My kitchen tends toward cold (62F - what can I say, it's a drafty house!!) so I didn't bother refrigerating the dough and all was well.

Very good, will make again. Only had dark brown sugar, used 3/4 c. brown sugar, 3/4c. white sugar. Increased flour by 1/2 cup, decreased salt to 1/2 t. and increased soda to 1 t. as other reviewers suggested. Used raisins and pecans. May add cinnamon next time, just a pinch. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Too much oatmeal, not enough flour so I decreased the oatmeal to 2 cups and increased the flour to 1 and a half cups. The "fixed" batch turned out much better!

Do not listen to the people saying to add more flour!!  As someone else suggested, simply chill the dough around 2 hrs to prevent flat, crispy cookies.   I added the 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda y'all suggested, and reduced the salt... Luckily, I tested the batch by making 6 cookies and storing the rest, because they smacked of that gross flour taste. I had to add another 1/2 stick of butter and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to get them back to tasting like cookies!   Once I added the extra butter and sugar, though, they were delicious! They were anything but flat, and stayed chewy unlike many other oatmeal cookies I've attempted.

These cookies are delicious and easy to make. Some adjustments I made: - 4 teaspoons of vanilla extract for stronger vanilla flavour - Reduced salt to 3/4 of a teaspoon as they were slightly salty - No walnuts for allergy reasons - Used milk chocolate chips or reduced the amount of semisweet chocolate chips added as 1 cup made the cookies too sweet and overpowered the taste of the cookie - Let cookie cool for 10+ minutes. Will cause cookie to stay moist and chewier longer.   Great recipe. Fun to play around with ingredients. Always a sellout at parties.

Our new favorite cookie.  Very good.  I added almost 2 cups of half flour and half wheat flour, and also added 1/2 cup coconut and some honey. They were not flat at all.

These cookies taste great!  I only gave them 4 stars because I took other people's advice and increased the flour and decreased the oatmeal and salt.  The cookies spread out during baking so I will chill the dough before baking next time (and there will be a next time!)

I think this was one of the best oatmeal cookie recipes I have ever baked. They turned out perfect and were chewy, I seperated my batch and used walnuts and raisins, heath baking bits/pecans, and butterscotch chips making four different cookies.

I followed the recipe exact, and the cookies just spread out completely flat into a puddle, and when cooled separated and fell apart.  I was disappointed... I usually have great success with recipes.  Definitely needs more flour I would say.

These cookies are THE BEST, and have been my go-to recipe for years - the oatmeal makes them hearty and not too sweet, and yet people can't stop snacking on them! As everyone mentions, adjusting the recipe helps make light, rising cookies: increase to 1.75 C flour and 1 t baking soda, reduce to 1/2 t salt, don't overmix. I also add 1/2 t cinnamon - gives it an extra intrigue. Now if only I could find a way to reduce all the butter and have them be just as good!

Holy hell.  These are amazing. They taste exactly like oatmeal chocolate chip cookies should.  I think this might be exactly my grandmother's recipe - love flavor included.  I added the extra 1/2 cup of flour, put 2 tsp of baking soda and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp like others suggested.

Tried this cookie recipe and it was a hit! Added white chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate and they were perfect! Also added dried cranberries to half the batch and they were delicious, very moist! My husband who doesn't eat sweets, loved them! The half batch that I added the dried cranberries to baked better (not so flat)than the half that did not have the dried fruit. Next time I'll add cranberries again or may try adding more flour if I don't add the cranberries so they don't bake so flat!

Delicious!  Turned out thick and chewy!  Added 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and refrigerated the dough over night - I think the chilled dough really kept them from spreading and thinning.  A keeper!

Baked at 335 for 12mins. Tastes good, but I'll chill the dough next time in hopes they will less cake-like.

As written, these weren't very good.  They were very thin.  However, after reading some reviews, I used 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp. salt, and added about 3/4 cup more flour.  Additionally, I increased the temperature to 350 and baked them for 14-15 minutes.  They came out PERFECT this way.  Soft and chewy!

These were just "Okay" they needed more cinnamon.  Personally I like the recipe on back of the Nestle toll house bag better.

Very yummy cookies. I also altered the recipe by using 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon salt (I used salted butter). I added chocolate chips and some leftover white chocolate chips I had kicking around. I think they taste great and have a nice consistency. My boyfriend likes them too so that's always a bonus!

not bad.  they didn't rise at all, though I am at high altitude, so that could have been the reason.  I did use extra flour and less salt and the flavor was just right.  I also used old fashioned oats chopped in a food processor instead of quick oats.

I modified this recipe to take to a nut free facility. I used 1 Cup Dark Chocolate Chips and 1 Cup White Chocolate Chips.  I also increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups and increased the soda to 1 tsp. I decreased the salt slightly.  My husband said these were the best cookies he's ever had!  Perfect texture!

Num! First of all, I halved the recipe because that is alot of cookies! Reduced butter by about 1 TBS, omitted white sugar altogether, doubled the baking soda, and halved the salt. My cookies are not flat (like some reviewers struggled with) and while the chocolate chips make them sweet, they are not overly sweet (because I ommitted the white sugar). These are perfecto!

I had to substitute cake flour for the all purpose, since I started making these and then realized I was out of flour.  They came out dry, and I'm guessing it was because of the flour.  They taste great though, so I'll have to try them again and make sure I have enough flour before I start next time!

Very very good.  The right amount of chewy to crispness.  Now I was out of flour so I used whole wheat, but that was the only change.  Loved them

I LOVE this recipe! I "healthified" it by cutting the butter in half and substituting 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I used all brown sugar rather than brown and white sugar and I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and they still turned out great! I did use a little extra baking soda and cooked them for about 16 minutes instead of 12. They are definitely dense cookies so they don't rise much, but they still taste great!

Best cookie ever!!!  I only changed one thing.  A trick I learned on another chocolate chip cookie recipe...I disolved the baking soda in a teaspoon of hot water and mixed in the wet ingredients.  It really makes a difference.

To cut back on the fat I used 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and only 1/2 cup of butter.  I also only put in 3/4 cup of brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of Splenda. I didn't have any rolled oats so instead I used 4 pkgs of Maple and Brown Sugar instant oatmeal.  The cookies were a HUGE hit!

These were so moist and delicious! I followed other's advice and added additional flour and baking powder, and made one additional change myself. As I was creaming the butter and went to add the sugar, I realized I was almost out of brown sugar, so I used 1/2 cup of brown suar and a whole cup of white sugar - came out great!

I love this cookie.  It is extremely delish!  Instead of adding extra flour, I add some ground flax seed for added Fiber & Omega 3's!!  And I also lighten up the salt by about a half.

These a  good . i wouldn't say knock your socks off good but they are good . The recipe does not yield 42 cookies unless you make them really small . i would cut the salt in half next time . I added cinnamon to mine and put the mixture on parchment paper and rolled into 2 dough logs and popped them into the freezer for 10 min . Then sliced and baked . the baking time was the same . But they didn't come out flat and were chewy :)

The first time I made these, I folllowed the recipe exactly, I noticed I had to add about 5 mins. of baking time and they came out great and were chewy. The next time I made these, I added more chocolate chips (~2 cups); very good. Thank you for an easy recipe.

Tasted great and were chewy.  I would have rated it 5 stars, but they came out flat and there weren't near enough chocolate chips for my liking.  Next time I'll add more oatmeal/flour and chips.

These turned out well, but didn't spread out nearly as much as I'd hoped. They taste great though, and to appease my cookie-monster husband I eliminated the nuts and doubled the chocolate chips. I also increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 tbsps, but I always do that with chocolate chip cookies, we love vanilla!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  The cookies come out so fluffy and tasty.  This recipe has definitely made it into my Recipe Box.  I did decrease the amount of salt to 1/2 teaspoon though.  Seemed like a lot of salt for this type of cookie.  Also, I allowed the mixture to chill over night in the fridge and baked then the next morning.  They didn't spread like some of the other reviewers claimed and I think that may have something to do with it. Fantastic cookie, tastes great!  I don't think these will last more than one day!  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

I didn't change a thing about the recipe and they turned out perfectly! I made small cookies (1 heaped teaspoon) and it took about 10 minutes in the oven. I also found that popping them into the fridge for about 30 minutes beforehand (and between batches) prevented them from spreading. I loved the saltiness, but as others have said, omit the salt if you don't like salty cookies and are using salted butter.

These had a really good flavor but my cookies went SO FLAT.  It was ridiculous actually.  And I did NOT over-mix.  I will definitely be making again only freezing my dough first, because the flavor was so good I think they will be excellent next time.

The texture of this cookie is fantastic and chewy.  I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips.  All other ingredients I followed exactly and it turned out amazing.  Yummy.

Before making these cookies, I read some of the reviews, so right off the bat I added the extra baking soda and flour, and cut the salt in half. The first batch that I put in the oven came out really gooey, which is yummy, but they were a little underdone. I didn't want to over bake them though, so on the next batch, I turned up the temp. to 335 (for 12 min.) as someone else had suggested. These turned out better. Gooey in the middle, but not too under done, crispy around the edges and PURE joy to eat! The first batch fell a bit, but they are still very yummy! They are a little wet, so I wanted to add a little more oats, but I had just enough for 3 cups, so I couldn't add anymore, but they still turned out YUMMY! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them!! Would like to try them with applesauce next time. :-)

Ok, I made a batch as directed in the recipes directions exactly which turned out runny/flat like some of the other reviews.  I also made one the rest of them like the other reviewers suggested with extra flour/baking soda/chilling for 2 hours/in the oven for 10mins per batch-which turned out with fantastic results!  Sooo good fresh out of the oven with a big ole glass of milk!

The cookies were excellent.  I followed the recipe but left out the nuts.  Can't wait to make again because the family loved them.

These things are the REAL DEAL. Do as others have said and refrigerate them. I used the non-quick-style of oat and it probably wasn't as good. I went nuts over the nuts. These were seriously on point.

used whole wheat instead of all-purpose flour and reese's peanut butter chips instead of walnuts and they turned out great. I probably would leave them in for an extra 1 or 2 minutes so the bottom crisps up a tiny bit more - they weren't holding together when I went to remove them. Def will make this again and again

the BEST chewy cookie! I agreed with others and added 1/2 cup more flour and oats and 1/2 tsp of baking soda and reduced the salt by half.  We refrained from adding nuts.. the cookies were gone in no time flat!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  We're making a double batch tonight... weight watchers here I come!

Wow, these are some pretty good cookies. I made them for my local garden walk and LOVED them. However, I did run into a few things, I love my cookies cooked and soft but not crunchy, and I found that my cookies came out looking like that but the bottoms were still really crunchy. Also, this is NOT a good recipe to put into the refridgerator for a few hours before you bake, because while I was waiting for my cookies to bake I found that the oats in the dough, seed to absorb some of the moisture in the cookies, so I would advise to make the cookies as soon as you make the dough. You may also notice that, like I did, the batter is really loose and unformed, I would NOT recommend adding more flour because my cookies already turned out a bit dry. However, these are among my favorite cookies. YUM, YUM!!

Great Cookies! I added 3/4 cup flour because the batter was a little too thin still. I didn't add the salt, this recipe doesn't need it, it has plenty of flavor without. Great recipe, I have been using it for a very long time.

I took some of the other reviewer's suggestions and added 1/4 c. of extra flour, another 1/2 tsp of soda and just a pinch of salt since I used salted butter. If you bake at 335 for 12 mins, they come out perfect! I'm not a big oatmeal cookie fan, but these were good and my husband at almost half of the batch within 30 minutes - they're that good. Next time, I think I will try adding more vanilla though or using half light brown, half dark brown sugar.

wow so i'm really just an aspiring baker who usually ends up with average results but really, these were delicious. sooo delicious. i cut the salt in half like i read and kept the flour the same. yes, the cookies flatten a little so i'll try more next time. i used lindt milk chocolate chunks, which tasted incredibly creamy and good in these cookies.  WILL MAKE AGAIN!

I also increased the flour and baking soda, and reduced the salt, as suggested. I have made this recipe several times and I always make two batches. This is my favorite cookie recipe. My friend likes them with butterscotch chips, so sometimes I do half and half, which is also very good! You won't be disappointed with this recipe.

THESE ARE AMAZING!  The dough was so delicious (and that is coming from someone who is not a big fan of cookie dough) that I didn't even want to bake them!   I read some reviews and made the following changes:  - I beat the wet ingredients for a LONG time, to make the dough fluffy - I was a little heavy-handed with the vanilla - I added and extra 1/2 cup of oats - I refrigerated dough for 2 hours before baking   Perfection.

AWESOME recipe!!! This is my favourite cookie recipe, and I get wonderful comments on them all the time! I omit the walnuts, and sometimes I use milk chocolate chips instead..or I mix white chocolate chips/semisweet/milk chocolate in, which also tastes great. I also don't add the salt-I found them really really salty plus we are trying to stay away from salt.. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I think these cookies turned out to be some of the best cookies I've ever made!  This is the second time that I've made them, and I only changed one thing this time.  The amount of salt.  I like my cookies salty, and sweet...but these were just the teeniest bit too salty.   I reduced the amount of salt from one full tsp, to just below full. Not a huge difference, but I liked the taste much more.  I'm so glad I stumbled on to this recipe!!!

These cookies are the perfect consistency and have the right amount of oatmeal and choc chips. In between batches, I put the dough in the freezer to firm up and had no issues with flattening. I used unsalted butter and they were still a tad too salty. Next time I will reduce the salt and add cinnamon. There was a little something missing and I think some spice would make these exceptional. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good basic recipe.  I live in Denver so to compensate for altitude I added 1/2 an egg and added a pinch less baking soda, and baked at 325 instead of 350.  After tasting the batter and before cooking, I also added a few tablespoons of peanut butter, and a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon.  They turned out AMAZING!  I think a lot of different delicious combinations can be made with this recipe.

These cookies are the BEST oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I've ever made but only after I took the other suggestions of reducing the vanilla to 1 tsp. and salt to 1/2 tsp. and increasing baking soda to 1 tsp. and flour to 1 1/2 cups and baking at 340 degrees for 12 minutes. I also added 1/3 c. unsweetened coconut and used pecans instead of walnuts. Yummy!

Interesting story: My son came to me and asked me why there aren't any potato chips crushed up in cookies. I thought that was a mighty good question because potato chips+chocolate is made of win. So, I picked this recipe to be my guinea pig. We made minor changes, cut the recipe in half, ground the oatmeal down in my blender to make a "flour" consistancy, used "chunk" Hershey's chips and subbed crushed potato chips in place of the nuts. Really simple changes and oh, my. Was it good! And to show my son that yes, it can be done. Great thing about the ground up oatmeal? It kind of takes on a nutty consistancy so it seems like oatmeal but you're mind and mouth thinks it's nuts. This was a good recipe to use.

I used 1-1/2 cups flour and 1 tsp baking soda, only a pinch of salt (I used Smart Balance, so I didn't think it needed too much salt), and I didn't over mix the dough. I also added about 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the flour/baking soda mixture before I combined it with the sugar/butter/egg/vanilla mixture. After baking them I feel like 3 cups of oats might have been too much, but they are still really good regardless. Apparently 335 degrees for 12 minutes worked perfectly. The oats really give the cookie substance, so they aren't flat at all. They are divine!

I love chocolate chip oatmeal, but this was pretty tasteless and too many quick oats. I think less oats and change to regular oats would improve the recipe, but for now, I'll look for a better recipe. 3/7: OK, my kids love this (ugh) and have requested this to be made again. I changed the rating to a 3 with their input.

One word: Amazingly ultra-fantastic.  Easily the best cookie I've ever made and possibly the best I've ever eaten.  Used unsalted butter.  Took the advice of one poster and grinded a cup of the oatmeal (in a food processor) to flour consistency.  And, as almost everyone else, used 1-3/4 cup flour, 1-1/2 tspn baking soda, and half-teaspoon salt.  Admittedly, I went with 3 tspn of Vanilla.  Also, no nuts so we did 1-1/2 cups chocolate chips.  Really, really, really good cookie.

Bloody SPECTACULAR I say! Honest to God, these are the very best oatmeal cookies I've ever made, and my family obviously thinks so too.... a whole batch of 48 cookies disappeared literally over night!

Good, but the recipe on the back of the famous oatmeal maker canister IS better.  However, this recipe has less steps, and is much faster to make.  So I guess it depends on how much time you have vs. how good of a cookie you want in the end.  I substituted 1/2 the butter for applesauce, creamed all the sugars with the butter first before adding eggs. I changed the amount of flour, baking soda, salt and oats like the other reviewers.  Also, the tip about chilling the dough for 15-30 minutes prior to putting on the baking sheets was a GREAT idea!  Enjoy!

I didn't have the spreading issue that many mentioned. The flavor was very bland even with an extra tsp of vanilla. I think there's too much oatmeal which made them too cakey for my taste. The men of the house sugggested I never make them again...and if they don't like a cookie, it's a pretty sad cookie.

Delicious Cookies!  I didn't have the spreading problem that some of you did, maybe because I cook on stoneware.  The salt is definately an issue though.  I'll be sure to half it next time!  I'm also not a big fan of nuts so I left them out and increased the chips (I used PB Cchip) a bit!

Ugh! should have stuck to the original recipe.  I'm so annoyed.  In the mood for a oatmeal chocolate cookie and came across this recipe.  It had great reviews but was it for the original or the 500 different "modifications" of the same recipe.  After reading the reviews I decided to change the amount of flour to 1 3/4 cups as several reviewers suggest and it turned out to be a big oaty mess.  Not enough butter to hold it together.  I tried to salvage the rest of the dough by adding a little more butter and sugar to the dry oats and turned it out in a square baking pan instead of drop cookies.  I'm not a scientist so we'll see if I was able to save them or if I end up tossing it all.  Lesson learned, when baking don't trust the modifications.

There were the worst cookies I have ever tasted.  It had way to much salt and even too much sugar.  I had three trays that went into the oven.  I tried to change my technique with each, but they were all bad.  The cookie's on the first tray would not stay together even after cooling.  After cooking for 13 minutes, I felt like I was eating cookie dough, which I do not like.  The second tray I cooked for 15 minutes, the cookies flattened out and did not come of the the tray at all.  So the 2 tray ended up with no cookies, just crumbles.  The 3rd tray was the same as the first.  I would throw them out, but I have to provide a snack for a preschool class and I don't have enough time to make another dessert.  Kids usually don't care.  But I was disgusted buy the taste.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before making it.  Big mistake, it was 4.5 stars so I trusted it.

Wonderfully delicious, chewy cookies. I followed others advice, and increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups and the baking soda to 1 teaspoon. I also added about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon for an added depth of flavor. Baked at 325 degrees for approx. 14 minutes. Amazing!

I made these for Christmas gifts.  Everyone raved about them and said they were the best cookies they had ever eaten.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and used a little less salt.  To keep the cookies from flattening out, make sure the butter is room temperature before attempting to make batter.

These cookies were pretty good. I cut the ingredient list in half. They were enough to feed 4 hungry people. These cookies expand while they're in the oven so be careful to not put them too close to eachother. These should be cooled for at least an hour to two hours.

BEST cookie I have ever eaten. I went through a phase in 2007-2008 where I made this cookie nearly every week. There is nothing I would change about it, although make sure you bake them for the EXACT amount of time listed as these cookies taste best when they are super gooey. I have shared these with many different people and a lot of my not oatmeal loving classmates adore these cookies. They are very simple and child friendly, but be warned - super addicting! I definitely recommend these to anyone with any amount of cooking experience. 5 stars for sure!!!

this is by far the worst cookie recipe I've ever made!! very poor spread and no flavour! I made a 2nd batch with the adjustments mentioned and we'll soon see how they turn out! I'm very disappointed. I guess I won't wow anyone this holiday season with my baking!! nothing but high calorie balls of nothingness :(

I made these last night, and they were GREAT! I loved them! Definitely going in my recipe book!  **NOTE: I did take the suggestions on other and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp because I used salted butter, and increased the flour 1/2 cup, and used about 2 tsp of baking soda.

Just made these and they are fantastic!!  I added 1/4 cup more flour, 1/2 tsp more baking soda, and omitted the nuts (personal preference).  They took longer than 12 min to bake, closer to 15 or so, so I would suggest watching them carefully after the 12 min mark.  They do keep cooking a bit after taking them out of the oven, but they would have been too raw at the 12 min mark.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were pretty good. The dough was really good, but the cookies tasted just like the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I usually make. I will be sticking with my regular recipe.

I made this recipe almost exactly as provided (except that I cut everything by half for a smaller batch, and used melted butter instead of soft).  It's a great cookie recipe!  Mine didn't spread more than I would have expected and they came out tender, chewy and delicious!

Fantastic! I replaced the walnuts with shredded coconut and used both white and dark chocolate, and threw in a teaspoon of Hazelnut flavor, it was seriously the best cookie I've ever made!

I followed the other reviews and increased the flour to 1 3/4 cup and the baking soda to 1 teaspoon. I left out the salt completely since I used margarine. I also lowered the temp to 355 and cooked for 13 minutes. They came out perfect! Thanks for the awesome recipe and the very helpful reviews!

This was just ok. The flavour wasn't spectacular. It could use some coconut maybe? I think there was a bit too much oatmeal because my cookies were a bit dry. Not the best I've tasted by far.

Delicious! Very chewy and very oat-ey.  I did make a couple changes though: I read other reviews and halved the salt I also replace 1/2 a cup of flour with 1/2 a cup of ground flax to add to the oatiness and make them a little bit healthier. The chocolate did a good job at making the cookie taste like a treat.    Next time I'm going to try using half the butter and using some applesauce...

I made these last night for my bible study group and they got rave reviews. Usually people will eat like one cookie and people were eating 2 or 3. I added pumpkin pie spice, just to spice it up a little bit. Overall, they are amazing. They even asked me to bring refreshments again for next time (this time I just did it on a whim). THanks!

These were definitely one of the best cookies I have ever had! I followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups and baking soda to 1 tsp. I also changed the cooking temperature to 335 degrees, added more chocolate chips and refrigerated the dough for about an hour before baking and in between batches. The cookies came out soft and chewy after 12-13 minutes. I will definitely use this recipe again!

My husband says these are his favorite cookies.  They really are delicious.  Be cautious with the salt though.  And definitely place them in the fridge to keep them from spreading when you bake.

I made these today and all but six are gone!!!! They were a huge hit and I didn't change a thing! They are the exact cookie that I used to make years ago from recipe handed down from an elderly friend, unfortunately that written recipe was lost...and now has been found! These cookies, baked as instructed, were soft and moist (for as long as they lasted!) Because ovens differ, I increased the bake time by 2 minutes. They turned out perfectly browned around the edges but still soft and chewy!

I did the recipe almost to a T - the only modifications I made was to add 1/4tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of ground cloves. I used one cup of milk chocolate chips and no nuts and they're great!

I liked this recipe.  I did make some alterations:  I used a scant cup of brown sugar and no wht sugar.  I always cut the sugar in cookie recipes.  I used dried blueberries and chopped macadamia nuts.  I will try it with raisins next time.  I may put some mini chocolate chips as well, if I do, I may cut the sugar to 3/4 brown sugar only.    Thank you.

These turned out perfect for me. The only thing I changed was I didn't add the nuts. They didn't go flat, they had wonderful texture and flavor, and the dough was super yummy(thats the best part right?!?). All around great.

These are BY FAR the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had.  I made the adjustments as others recommended: 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup shortening, 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp salt and cinnamon (just sprinkled it in).  I also refrigerated the dough for 30 minutes prior to baking.  Super moist and not dry.  I did not add nuts and doubled the chips but I know this would have been excellent with both.  Definitely keeping in my recipe box!  Thanks so much!!!  I have a feeling we'll be eating a lot more oatmeal cookies this fall & winter.

These cookies are one of the best I have ever had!! I did cut down on the salt to 1/2 tsp. I like walnuts but they are good without them too.  I made 1/2 the batch with and 1/2 without. If you are looking for a great cookie recipe then you found it!

Awesome cookies!  I added 1 cup of shredded coconut and it was delish.  I also cranked the oven temp up to 350 in order for them to be finished in 10 minutes.

I used 2 c. chocolate chips instead of any walnuts.  I baked them longer than 12 minutes since they seemed gooey when I checked them, but maybe I should have pulled them out at 12 because they seemed dry to me a day or 2 later.

I liked this cookie. I read and tried other bakers suggestions. I added the extra 1/4 C. of flour and decreased the salt by half. Probably could have cut even more of it out. I also added another 1/4 C. of chocolate chips. They baked up nice and tall and had a nice balance of crispy edges and chewy center. I would make this cookie again.

These were really fantastic cookies.  I too added the extra 1/2 cup flour, but other than that, I stuck with the original recipe. They made the perfect snack to tote to work and to the gym.

Absolutely addictive even without the walnuts! After reading some reviews, I decided to omit the salt. To make them easier to handle, I refrigerated the dough for 2 hours and then rolled it into walnut sized balls and squashed slightly, I baked them for 15 min at 150C. Perfect! Next time I may add some cinnamon...

WOW! Every person that has tried these cookies has told me that these are AWESOME! These cookies are honestly the BEST cookies you could ever have. My dad absolutely loves these cookies. Thank you So much for this recipe. Will definetly make again Suggestion: You NEED to cut the salt in half or more because these are very salty. Also, be careful NOT to overbake these or they really don't taste good.  Other than that, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

VERY VERY VERY good! I used unsalted butter, increased flour by another 1/2 cup, and increased baking soda an additional 1/2 teaspoon, based on reviews. Omitted nuts, but will add next time for one rockin' good cookie! If you don't add nuts, try adding **just a few** more choc chips to avoid some "blank" bites. Definitely use semi-sweet because it's a sweet-tasting cookie overall. Due to some comments on spreading, I put the dough in the fridge between batches... even though spreading wasn't an issue on the first batch. After great success with this oatmeal version, I don't think I'll make the regular choc chip cookie ever again - oatmeal really makes a satisfying cookie! This is my new cookie standard! THANKS!

Great recipe but I did add 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup oats, 1 tsp almond extract, fresh ground nutmeg, cinnamon, reeses pieces, white chocolate chips, and 1/2 tsp baking soda. Then I dipped half of the cookie in melted chocolate and sprinkled homemade granola on top. Hubby says they are the best cookies he has ever eaten. Co-workers to my kids teachers have requested them. So yummy!

I use this every time I make cookies now and everyone loves them (especially my husband)! I've just barely modified it- no nuts, 2cups chocolate chips and 2cups oats. I split it into thirds- make one batch, put another in the fridge and another in the freezer. I add a bit more time in the oven if they're still cold.

This is an amazing recipe!! I read the comments before and added an extra cup of flour and a bit more baking soda, I also cut down on the salt, only adding 1/4 tsp.  the only recomendation I have is to cut the amount of chocolate chips down to 1/2~3/4 cup so they don't over power the cookies.  Everyone loves them!

These turned out great, but I did end up making some modifications. I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp., added 1 1/4 tsp. of baking soda instead of the suggested 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 cup of apple sauce to replace 1/2 cup butter, and I added an additional quarter cup of whole wheat flour to the original 1 1/4 cup of flour. I was very pleased with the outcome of these, and I definitely will be making these again! I may add 1/2 of Splenda to replace the 1/2 cup of white sugar next time.

These were very good, but I think I might use 1 C white sugar instead of 1/2 C, since I like my cookies a little sweeter. Otherwise, they were quite tasty!

I did as others suggested and increased the flour to 1 3/4 cup and baking soda to 1 tsp while decreasing the salt to 1/2 tsp.  The cookies turned out the perfect texture, and the flavor is rich.  Everybody loved them.  The only semi-complaint I have is that they are much sweeter than I had anticipated for oatmeal cookies.  Still delicious- just not what I expected at first.

Excatly the cookie I was trying to create!! I did decrease the salt by half and increased the flour by 1/2 cup, and put the batter in the freezer for 30 mins before baking. Also I used a full bag of chocolate chips.

We took the advice of other reviewers but they still didn't turn out great. I think this recipe, as it stands, unfortunately, is a lemon. If you have to make that many adjustments, there's something wrong, you know?

Turned out great with the following changes as others suggested: used 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 3/4 cup flour. Mixed the dry & wet ingredients together with a spatula. The cookies did not spread at all. My mom says to bake 1 cookie 1st when trying a new recipe so you can make adjustments before you bake a bunch. HTH!!

I have been looking for a really good oatmeal cookie recipe that did not turn out flat, and I think I may have found it!  The previous reviews with tips to prevent cookies from going flat really helped; thank you!

Not chewy. I wasted al ot of dough because these were thin and crispy. I think they need more flour personally. Wanted to try something new because I didn't have everything I needed for mine. I learned the hard way just to run out to the store and get what I need to make mine.

These are great, i had to make them 3 times this week because they got eaten up so quickly. i hate spooning out cookies so i just split the batter into 2 pans and baked for around 20- 25 minutes, and cut them while they're still warm. also i added flax seeds instead of nuts bc its all i had and they were delish!

Healthier Option: Did recommended adjustments, then subsituted spenda brown sugar and dark chocolate chips. Lastly add 1/2 cup of milled flax seed and 1/2 cup wheat germ. My kids loved loved them!

Needs more vanilla and more chocolate, but otherwise, perfect consistency! I followed these suggestions which helped the cookies hold their shape while cooking and stay soft: 1 3/4 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, stir together oats, flour, baking soda, salt, chocolate chips and stir in dry mixture with wet ingredients. I had to cook mine for 14-15 minutes so that they were completely cooked, but that usually depends on the oven. Definitely give this recipe a try if you like oatmeal chocolate chip cookies!

LOVE THEM!!  I just made them and my son told me "Mom those are delicious cookies, they are great!"  I did a full tsp of baking soda.  Hand mix in the oats and chocolate, Mine did not flatten out.  Also be sure your sheet is nice and cool before you bake your next batch.  I do have a silpat liner on my  baking sheets, so I had to reduce my bake time 2 mins.  They were so good, I need to go get another.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe was FANTASTIC!!!! I changed a few things just to add kick. I used 1 3/4 C of flour. I also added 1/2tsp. cinnnamon. I added an extra 1/4 C of choc. chips for more chocolate and I put in 1/2 C of finely chopped pecans. They baked up perfect! I did let them sit on stone for about 3 minutes after I took them out of the oven. My family LOVED them!!!

Absolutely the best Oatmeal cookie EVER!! I have been searching for this type of chewy cookie for a long time. I put raisins in my second batch. I really cannot uderstand how one reader found them gross. She must have made a mistake. I followed the recipe to the tee and my whole family ate the up!! Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed FFF's instructions (Frugal Foodie) and they turned out GREAT.  My Mother, a 75 yr old who is "never wrong" pronounced the cookies "just yummy".  I have another "favorite full proof recipe".

I don't know WHAT I did wrong, but these turned out very flat and crispy!  I've been trying a lot of chocolate chipe cookie recipes on here and found that this was my least favorite.  The cookie tasted great but the texture and the look were NOT appealing!

Delish,especially if you like chewy, gooey cookies! Will definately make again. Like the other reviewers, I used 1-1/2 C. flour and 1 teas. soda. Very similar to the Quaker Oats recipe.

I set out trying to find a recipe that would be as close to Kashi's Oatmeal Dark Chocolate Chip Cookies as possible.   BINGO!!! I found it!  NOTE: I took the advice of other reviewers and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour, omitted the salt (used salted butter), and increased the baking soda to 1 tsp.  Also, I added one cup of chopped pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference)and used 1 cup of Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate chips.  As the dough is very thick and bulky to work with, stirring it was next to impossible. So I slid on a pair of plastic gloves and kneaded the dough by hand (it is important not to over stir this batter). Worked like a charm!  I imagined when I took the first batch out of the oven they were going to be good. After I tasted one, I knew for sure.  Very good cookie, nice and crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.

quite good.  added 1/2cup flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking soda, and subtracted 1/2 tsp salt.  omitted walnuts.  maybe would have added a little more chocolate chips.

AWESOME. I had to add about a 1/2 cup more flour to it. And I refrigerated the batter that had to sit out while the others baked. I love this recipe. I have made it 4xs already.

Good Recipe, except it's almost identical to the Quaker Oatmeal on the top of their lid.  With everyone's changes that are suggested it's identical minus the cinnamon.

This was great as is - I didn't change anything - not too sweet or too salty.  Mine only made 35, but I made them larger is all.  Will definitely make them again.

everyone said they were good, but as my own worst critic, i feel like i could have changed the recipe a little to make it less bland. i'm sure i'll make it again, but probably add some cinnamon for a more spicy flavor.

I agree with some of the other reviews, too salty for me and I live with the salt shaker! I adjusted the batter for the remainder by adding more flour and it seemed to help. I would either use unsalted better next time or leave out the additional salt!  Overall great cookies - hubby will love them when he gets home from work (if there are any left)

Yummy, these hit the spot. I prefer oatmeal raisin cookies, but hubby was asking for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. They've held up nicely as well, still nice and chewy after 3 days.

Very good recipe.  I also modified and used 1 1/2 cups flour although I think it would have been fine without the extra.  Perfect amount of chocolate chips in the cookies. Husband absolutely loved them.  I will make this recipe again.

The best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie by far!  I did NOT add the extra flour, but I did increase the baking soda to 1 tsp and bake them at 350, instead of 325.  They turned out perfect and did not spread at all...crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Great flavour!

I followed the recipe exactly and did the recommended updates adding another 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 tsp bakig soda. Cookie lacked a key ingredient TASTE. They hadvirtually no flavor. So I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon 3/4 cup of rasins, a tsp of pumpkin spice, another 1/2 cup of brown sugar and approx 2tablspoons of soy milk and I think they are much better but I would not recommend these cookies.   I found not enough flavor and a very dense texture, adding my fix-ups helped but too much work for no wow factor...

These are great! I followed the recipe to the letter with two small changes. I only had dark chocolate chipsand I added an extra 1/2 a cup of these and I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I also used a number 50 scoop( baking will know what I am talking about) and I yielded about 60 cookies. These turned out wonderfully soft and chewy and not flat and hard like others have stated. I will be making these again. Thanks for sharing!

I tried this recipe the other day and the cookies were AMAZING. I followed ZestyGirl30's tip and added 1/4 cup more flour, 1/2 teaspoon more baking soda, and half the salt and they turned out to be honestly one of the best cookies i've ever had.

Very delicious. I used 1 3/4 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and added half a teaspoon of cinnomin and nutmeg. I skipped the walnuts and chocolate chips and added a cup of raisins. Best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had. :D

btw, when I pulled them out of the oven they still didn't LOOK done after 15 minutes, but after they'd rested a minute they were perfect. I may have had to cook mine longer because I had left the batter in the refrigerator overnight.

I omitted the nuts and added another half cup of chocolate chips. The cooking time was perfect for these. They looked underdone, but set up in a few minutes. Everybody loved them and I keep getting requests for more. I think they have so much more depth and texture than regular chocolate chip cookies.

Delicious, but incredibly FLAT. I even took people's advice and added a quarter cup more flour and extra soda, but they still turned out flat. I loved the taste though, so I guess I would try them again with even more flour...perhaps baking powder will help too?

These cookies have become a favourite among my friends and family. They always turn out moist and chewy, and are eaten up right away!

This isn't my favorite chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe, but they're okay. I made the modifications others swore by, and I'm only satisfied.

I was pleased the cookies stayed so moist and chewy.  I intentionally put them in a container and let a few sit for two days just to see how they did--still wonderful and getting praise from my kids.  Well done.

Great Recipe!  I did add 1/4 cup flour as others have suggested. I have made this *many* times and the flour definitely helps.  We use this as a base recipe and make variations every time we make it (i.e. adding coconut, varying the chips, varying the types of nuts, etc.) Our favorite way to enjoy this recipe - use 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup milk choc chips instead of the 1 cup chocolate chips.  Then sub peanuts for the nuts called for. Delicious!! This is a great recipe!

These cookies are amazing.  The cookie dough is even better.  I probably consumed 4 cookies worth of dough waiting for the first batch to bake.  The only pitfall to this wonderfully delicious recipe is the salt.  1 tsp is wayyy too much salt.  I could actually taste the salt in the baked cookies.  I would suggest cutting the salt down  by 1/4 or even by 1/2.  All in all SO GOOD!!!

Good cookies.  In addition to the changes about increasing the flour and baking soda, and decreasing the salt, I also added 1/4 cup more oats and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon - yummy!

I'm making these for a church event tomorrow but I goofed and was going to make the oatmeal choc. coconut chewy cookies instead which I made last week and were fabulous.  I had added some nutmeg to these as I did the others as well and used milk choc. chips instead of semi-sweet which is the norm. but I loved the way they melted and tasted.  The big thing was to make the cookies into bar form! I sprayed a 9x13 glass baking dish and spread the dough in that and baked aprox. 23 min. or until toothpick comes out without dough on it, only the melted chocolate! I didn't know how these were going to turn out but there isn't much of a difference in recipes. Now that i've tasted them, I have to be honest which is why we review, but I like the other cookie a bit better.  These are good, just not as good as the ones i made last week.

A very comforting cookie -- yum!  I used regular oats, and also added extra flour, baking soda and vanilla.  I chilled the dough all afternoon in the fridge.  They turned out addictively well!

I substituted 1/4 cup cocoa powder for 1/4 cup of the flour for double chocolaty-ness! These cookies were HUGE, they definitely need to be spaced a few inches apart on the cookie sheet (I use a silpat) and they don't need to be "heaping spoonfuls" ping pong sized dough balls will work if you want more normal sized cookies. As long as you don't over-mix these come out delicious (and I don't even like oatmeal) I will be buying extra butter next time I go to the market just for these cookies.

I usually adapt recipes, but after reading too many suggestions to change this recipe I decided to follow it almost exactly. They were delicious!!! The only changes I made were to preheat the oven to 350 instead of 325, and I added about a half a cup of chopped almonds.  I live at high altitude, and they still worked out wonderfully. They were the hit of a party I recently had. YUMMY!

Followed the common mods: Upping the flour by 1/2 cup / baking soda up 1/2 tbs / cut salt to 1/2 tsp.  Incorporated mrab03's peanut butter idea. Then, I come to find I have a bit short of 1.5 cups of old fashioned oats and 3/4 bag of MINI chocolate chips... Cooked at 335 (per Fervent Frugal Foodie's suggestion) for 13 minutes, and let sit on sheets for five.   Even though these have deviated from the recipe, they are SO GOOD!  Next time, though:  I'll make sure I have the right amount of oats.

I followed the suggestion to reduce the salt and add more baking soda.  However, the cookies tasted too strong of baking soda and gave my husband and I terrible indigestion.  Stick to the original recipe and maybe add less baking soda.

Delicious!

I added flour like the other reviews suggested, I also used 30 percent less chocolate chips (there were still plenty, and I didn't have quick cooking oats but I had old fashioned oats (the large kind) so I put in 2 cups instead of 3. Instead of white sugar I used splenda (use a little less if you use splenda) and i threw in an extra pinch of baking soda.  And lastly I didn't use any salt because I used salted butter.

I baked the cookies for 10 minutes, cooled them on the pan for exactly 5 and they came out the perfect consistency.  They didn't flatten out, were soft, and just plain perfect.

Love them! totally making them again.

My boyfriend LOVES these cookies.  I split the batter in half before adding chocolate chips and add raisins to his half and the chocolate chips to mine.  He's always so excited when I make these.

These are awesome!  Ours still turned out flat even though we followed other reviews and increased flour, baking soda and decreased the salt but we didn't care cause they still tasted awesome.  I even got my husband to help out!  It was interesting because he made our cookies huge but thats ok we had fun!

I made these for my boyfriend who's in Ohio for the summer!  I was worried that they would dry out or fall apart when I mailed them, but he said they mailed perfectly and that he and his mom can't stop eating them!  And my mom and sister were fighting over the leftovers!  All I did differently was add white chocolate chips.  Great recipe!

This was a great cookie recipe.  I didn't have any problems with flat cookies.  I did everything exactly as the recipe called for but I did chill the cookie dough for about 30 minutes prior to baking and they look awesome.  I would probably add more chocolate chips to the recipe.

These are awesome cookies. I made them for my husband and for his Dad for father's day and they loved them to death!

I did half the salt and in the freezer for about 30 mins and they came out perfect!

We really love these cookies.

A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.!!!! 
Yummy! With these slight changes, these turned out so delicious. Use 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavored crisco, add 1/4 cup more flour, 1/2 tsp more soda and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. I used a pampered chef cookie scoop (medium) and they were perfect!! Now, so I don't eat them all!!!

Can I give 10 stars? Please? 

I read most of the reviews and took some of the suggestions and this really is a 10 star cookie. I used butter-flavored shortening and butter, both sugars, AP flour, whole wheat flour and some wheat germ to equal 2 cups. 3 cups of old fashioned oats, vanilla, 1 t baking soda and 1/2 t salt, 3 eggs, pumpkin pie spice,   dried cranberries. I am allergic to nuts so I omitted those and the chips, next time I may add the chips though. Perfectly chewy cookies.

I followed the additional tips in the reviews and this cookie was certainly the best I've ever tasted.  I brought them to work and everyone was floored at the taste of them.  They also kept for many days in a plastic ziploc bag!!

This recipe is great!! I used two cups of chocolate covered rasins instead of chocolate chips and omitted the nuts. They really turned out good. I also swapped the butter for shortening. I will make this agian.

These were great they were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I added mint chocolate chips the second time and they didn't last long, it's a nice change!

Yum! My husband and kids loved these. I found that I needed to bake them for about 14-15 minutes though. In my oven, 12 minutes wasn't enough.

This is a good all around cookie recipe. As far as them turning out flat, I found that putting my finished dough into the fridge for 15 minutes before firing in the oven  kept them standing up nicely.

I received so many compliments about these cookies!  I took others' recommendations of increasing the flour  and adding an extra half tsp. of baking soda.  I used an extra cup of chocolate chips and refridgerated the dough for about an hour.  The results were amazing!  Yum!

AMAZING FLAVOR!!! I even took some over to the neighbors and they requested more. I followed the recipe exactly and made the cookies a little smaller then suggested. The only complaint I recieved was from my dad, who stated the cookies had a weird after-taste. We all agree that it was just his tastebuds since no one else tasted anything other than a moist and scrumptious cookie! :)

I've made these twice now and think they are the best oatmeal cookies ever!  The first time I made them I followed advise from other reviews and they were perfect.  This last time they came out a little flat cause I didn't follow all the suggestions.  So here's what to do: make sure to beat the sugars and butter for about 4 minutes and then mix all the rest by hand and not too much so the cookies won't flatten and become hard.  Add about 1/8 cup more flour and I added more choc. chips and no nuts.  Make sure the cookies are not too big, about 1 1/2 inch ball and don't over bake them (that can make them hard too).  This should give you a perfect cookies that you can't stop eating.

I added a 1/4 more flour based on other reviews and it worked out perfectly. I also added about a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to add some flavor.
The cookies are nice and soft and have a great taste. I would definitely make these again.

My husband loved these cookies.  I thought they could have a little more something, so next time I'm going to try to add a scoop of peanut butter.  

I didn't have the problem of flat cookies as other peopel mentioned, but I didn't follow the instuctions exactly.  I wasn't paying attention and added all the wet ingredients (sugars, butter, egg, and vanilla) before creaming.  Plus I took the mixer to high (got the switches mixed up) so I really had a fluffy wet mixture before adding the dry ingredients.  The dough didn't seem wet enough.  I thought that there might have been too much oats, but the results were excellent.  I did cook them for about 14 minutes - since they didn't seem done at 12 minutes.

I'll definitely make them again.

Just whipped up a batch and they are so yummy... I added 1/4 more flour like another reviewer suggested and increased the baking soda just a pinch..  They taste wonderful. I did roll these into balls instead of just dropping them on the pan.. Makes the cookies very uniform in size that way.

Great recipe! Just like my grandmother used to make. I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to give the cookies a little spice, and they turned out fantastic. The recipe yields about 4 dozen cookies, so I halved the recipe last time I made them. I would definitely recommend making these for your friends and family. My boyfriend and his roommates gobbled them all up within an hour of leaving the oven!

I thought these cookies were great!  I read some of the reviews before I made them, sooo what I did... is use 1/4c more flour, 1/2tsp more baking soda, no salt butter and put them in the frig for 2 hours before I cooked them.  Came out perfect!  My husband brought some into work and everyone loved them!  Thank you!

I must have done something wrong because these completely flattened out on me and were crispy.  They had wonderful flavor though which is why I am still giving them 5 stars.  I am going to try again and see if I missed something.

Followed the recipe almost exactly (baked for 13 min instead of 12) and they turned out excellent for a novice baker.  They are slightly crispy on the outside and nice and chewy in the middle.  Make sure to store them in tupperware so they stay that way.  Next time I might even add more walnuts.

when you look at how many reviews there are for this recipe you will know that there is NO need to look for a different cookie recipe.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and increased the flour,soda,choc and added a tablespoon of milk.  Also,I toasted some slivered almonds and left out the walnuts.  WOW GOOD---forgot to mention one thing, I scraped a vanilla bean instead of the extract...really good flavour

Need to refrigerate the dough before dishing out. I live at a 6500' or so, and I increased the soda and flour a little. Some where slightly puffy towards the end. Okay recipe, but needs something, just not sure what. Maybe another half cup of chocolate chips and maybe use minis.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added the additional 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp. baking soda, and cut the salt to 1/2 a tsp.  I omitted the nuts because my kids prefer them without. 

These were beyond fabulous.  A tiny bit crunchy on the edges and chewy in the middle.  A perfect blend of chocolate and oatmeal.  YUM!!!

This is my new favorite cookie!  Everyone who has tried them likes them a lot, and I'm playing with adapting it as a vegan cookie.

These were great!  I made them with pecans and a mix semi-sweet and white chocolate chips.  I only baked them for 10 minutes and they stayed chewy.  Definitely a keeper.

Wow!  These cookies are wonderful... they didn't turn out flat at all.  They didn't look quite done after 12 minutes, so I left them in for two additional  minutes, which ended up being perfect for me - every oven is different. The cookies were a great combination of crispy toward the edges but soft and chewy in the middle.  I sadly didn't have any walnuts, so I addes about 1/2 C.  Heath toffee bits, which were delicious.  I can't wait to try them with walnuts next time.  This is yet another great allrecipes find!

Excellent! I've been making these for 3 months now with minor alterations and my husband & his surfing buddy love them! His surf buddy says I could sell them! My alterations: I use "Can't believe it's not butter"-light, reduce flour to barely 1 cup, increase quick oats slightly, use at lease 1 cup each of walnuts and white & milk choc chips and/or chunks.

I enjoyed these but they were a little dry. I added extra flour and baking soda like suggested above which made them look great. My second batch I added 1/2 cup apple sauce, 1/2 stick extra butter and a dash of cinnamon. They tasted much better!

I'm eating one of these as I write--can't keep my hands off them.  These cookies are wonderful!  I followed the recipe as written (except I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. since I only had salted butter on hand & omitted the nuts), & they turned out great.  I didn't have any problem with them being flat.  Great recipe!

the basics of this recipe delivered as promised for a chewy oatmeal cookie and with the changes recommended to add extra flower and baking soda these cookies were not flat at all. Instead of chocolate chips, though, I used chopped dates, dried apricots, white chocolate chips and pecans, as my original search for a "chewy" otameal cookie was always with the intent of using these other add-in ingredients. This is a good recipe to alter to add what ever you fancy.

My husband LOVED these cookies!  I used whole wheat flour in place of the regular flour and found that I needed to bake up to 20 minutes on Airbake sheets.  I did chill the dough - the end result were delicious cookies that I am already making again!

I'm giving this 5 stars because I believe if I had enough oatmeal, these would have been perfect.  I didn't have quite enough oatmeal so they were thin.  I also subbed raisins for the chocolate chips as hubby doesn't care for the chocolate in oatmeal cookies.

Nearly impossible to mess these up. I took the suggestion of adding a little more flour and added a little less sugar and they turned out wonderfully. I also used part chocolate chips and part cinnamon chips. Wonderful!

Best cookie ever! I made these cookies the other day and they did not last long. I did not have to modify anything. I rolled these into little balls and put on my cookie sheet and they were perfect! I am going to make these for my son's Christmas party. Thanks for a GREAT recipe. :)

Great cookies, nice and chewy.  I would double the semisweet chips if you are looking for more of a chocolatey taste.  I got the regular size morsels, I think the mini morsels would do better next time I make these.

These cookies are soft, chewy, and have quickly become my go-to recipe for baked goods. I made the recipe exactly as described, but I refrigerated the batter for 15 minutes before baking, and I cooked for 14 minutes instead of 12 (at 12 minutes they still looked a bit raw). I am very pleased with the results and would recommend these to anyone looking to impress friends or family!

I am only giving this three stars because I do not think that oatmeal and chocolate chip go together. I will stick with oatmeal cinnamon raisin. A match made in heaven. Also, this cookie was on the dry crumbly side, I would recommend using a little less oats. Otherwise palatable. We did eat them all.

This is by far one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes I've ever tasted!  I used to make the Mrs. Field's chocolate chip oatmeal cookies, but not any more!  I've found a definate keeper.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Great recipe.  Some major modifications: only used 1/2 stick butter and added 1 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup flaxseed.  Also left out the nuts.  Next time I plan on reducing the sugar a bit, but they turned out great and better for you!  My husband hates sweets but liked them so much he ended up eating 6 cookies!  I love sweets and they definitely satisfy any sweet/chocolate craving.

Excellent oatmeal cookie recipe! My whole family loves these. I made a couple of simple adjustments to the recipe. 

1. reduce the sugar; 3/4c. brown and 1/4c white sugar

2. Reduce chocolate chips (to about 1/2c)

3. Add 1/2 - 3/4 c dried cranberries

The mix of chocolate and cranberries is fantastic and gives the cookie a boost of colour!

We did not like these at all. They are flat.  They are too crispy.  The excessive amount of brown sugar, coupled with too much oatmeal, and too little flour makes you chew as if you are eating a crispy chocolate caramel; it is so chewy (as per the title, I suppose, but not what I envisioned when I read chewy).  If you like soft and moist cookies that taste like they are fresh from the oven, then choose a different recipe.

These turned out really well.  I made one major mistake and did not cut the salt in half as suggested by members.  Too salty.  I did follow the other suggestions of more flour and baking soda.

These cookies are wonderful!  I did have to make a couple of substitutions - pecans for walnuts b/c that's all I had.  I also had to use all brown sugar because I was out of white.  They were still great.  I can't wait to make them again!

Really great cookies. I did as others suggested and increased the flour by 1/2 cup and the baking soda by 1/2 teaspoon. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon; it gave a very subtle, essential taste that blended perfectly with the oatmeal and chocolate chips, making a warm, delicious cookie. I love the recipe.

This recipe turned out perfectly.  My husband likes thicker more rounded cookies so like the other posts said I put the dough in the fridge for 15 minutes before baking.   I also used pecans in lieu of walnuts as I like their flavor better.

These cookies are fabulous!  I increased the flour by 1/2 cup, increased baking soda by 1/2 teaspoon and decreased salt by 1/2, as suggested by other reviewers and they turned out perfectly.  Mine took longer than 12 minutes to bake.  I used one full bag of semi sweet chocolate chips and 1 full bag of Reese's Peanut Butter chips and they taste amazing.  These were really easy to make and turned out perfectly! I rolled the batter into balls and flattened them slightly.  Thanks for such a great recipe, Dr. Amy, and thanks to everyone for their helpful reviews/comments.

Very easy to make and very tasty. I did not think I would like the combination but I did. This is going in my book and many recipes do not make it to my book.

These cookies came out very well! I was a little uneasy when I read some of the reviews, but there was no spreading problem at all and they're not too salty whatsoever. I too had the feeling that they looked undercooked, but they ended up tasting great (I snagged one off the sheet before letting them cool!) Just to note: I live in Denver and modified the cooking slightly to accomodate the high altitude. I kicked the oven up to 350F instead of 325F and left the cookies in for 15 mins instead of 12. I also have some handy cookie sheets that 'prevent burning' which could help as well ;)

I have made these cookies twice now...once with semi-sweet choc chips, and once I added white chocolate chips. These are the best cookies I have ever had! I made them for my co-workers and they ate them all in an hour! I always keep all the ingredients on hand just in case my husband needs a treat. I did modify it as others said with more flour and a lil less baking soda. They came out perfect!

This is an awesome recipe!!! My first ever cookie that isn't overly sweet or salty or flat and crunchy.  I followed the other suggestions and also the half portion for oatmeal and other half for shredded coconut.  I did not have vanilla extract, but did use the caramel syrup from a bottle!!  Drizzled it on top of the butter (from fridge popped into oven for 30 secs) and the sugar mixture.  I did however have this Wholesome organic cane sugar?  So with this, you usually have to use more to acquire the 'american sweet' taste, but did not do that, stuck with the measurements and came out perfectly.  I popped mine in after mixing everything, so maybe for those whose are flat, the butter may have sat too long outside?  I've had this problem with other recipes when I forget how long the butter is out.  So now I just pop it in the microwave for 30 secs if it's 2 sticks, one stick I think 10-15 secs, depending on the microwave.  Anyway, babbling too much here, but thank you for this recipe, and thank everyone for their suggestions, it worked out!!!  Love this website! :)

Love these. Refigerating them did the trick to keep them from flattening. Also, i like to add more chips. They are good with pecans instead of walnuts too.

What did I do wrong? I cooked them for the specified time, and they're gooey and gross. Tastes bland. I tried adding a minute to the cooking time, and I ended up scraping blacked chunks off my cookie sheets. What a waste of good chocolate chips and walnuts and an afternoon. Would NOT recommend. At all.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but they turned out to be flat and totally gooey. I followed other's advice by increasing the amount of flour and baking soda, but they basically fell apart when you tried to pick them up. Other than the mess, they tasted wonderful.

This is WAY better than the recipe on the quaker box!  It has more of that hearty oat feel.  I didn't use walnuts in mine so I just added extra chips.  I made them again with raisins instead of chips and they were even more amazing!  Thanks for this recipe!

These were great!  I only give it a four because I had to change the ingredients like everyone else (1 3/4 c flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 t salt).  I also added an extra cup of chocolate chips and raisins instead of nuts...these are yummy!  I also had to refrigerate the dough for a couple hours, but they worked out great after that.

The best--I broke my whole lab's diet when I took a plate to our weekly lab meeting.  No one could resist them.  Perfectly chewy and not too sweet...just how I like them.

I followed other reader's advice and decreased salt to 1/2 tsp, increased BS to 3/4, used a scan 3 cups of oatmeal.  I added cinnamon (1tsp) and a whole bag of chocolate chips.  For half the recipe, I added raisins and pecans. Very yummy.  

however, today, the cookies are a little drier than I would like. I suggest you decrease the baking/cooling time some to your personal preference.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I just made them with my 3 yr old daughter. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and I added 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and only put in 2 cups of oatmeal.

I'll make these again!

Yu-hu-hum!  Way good.  Mine turned out a little on the thin side-- maybe use colder butter next time?  Excellent, chewy, nutty type of texture.

Definitely a keeper, though I did double the baking soda, added a 1/2 cup of coconut and my baking time was only 9-10 min. Cookies turned out perfect, chocolaty, chewy and so easy!

A good recipe, but I made some adjustments. Used 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1.5 c. flour, 2 c. oats, 1 c. milk chocolate chunks (Hershey's), and 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips. Added 1 tsp. cinnamon as well. Baked for about 14 minutes.

These were so goood.  I added an additional 1/4 cup of flour and doubled the baking soda as previous reviewers had suggested.  I also refridgerated the dough for around an hour prior to baking.  The result 48 cookies gone in two days!!  My whole family loved them.  I think I may try these with craisins instead of chocolate chips sometime.

These cookies are great!  I've tried using different combinations of nute, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and M&Ms and they are all equally fabulous.  I didn't have quick oats one of the times so I used plain old-fashioned oatmeal, and it worked fine.  I recommend using the changes that other reviews recommend regarding the flour, baking soda, and salt.  Also, there is no need to chill your dough unless you melt your butter.  The cookies will not spread.

OH MY GOD!  This cookies are the most amazing things you will ever eat!  They don't often make too many actual cookies because we always end up eating the batter right out of the bowl.  My roommates always ask when I'm going to make the next batch so they can be ready with a spoon and a big glass of cold milk!  Whoever came up with this one, I salute you!  And don't be afraid to add in anything extra.  We love chocolate so extra chips or chopped chocolate bars are an added bonus.  This recipe is definitely going to be passed on to many people!!

Delightful! My husband says he prefers a flatter cookie so next time I will probably cut back on the baking soda a little and flatten the dough out. But the taste and texture were supurb. I didn't use chocolate chips, just raisins. THey are great plain.

This is a wonderful recipe! :D  I did cut out all the white sugar and 1/2 stick of the butter. I also added dried cranberries, sweetened-shredded coconut, chopped dates and a little cinnamon. Everyone has loved the cookies.

Best cookies I've ever made! and they are easy to make, too. Followed some suggestions of 1 and 1/2 cup flour,  1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp baking soda. Also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 2/3 cup coconut. Turned out perfectly!

This is a great and easy cookie...  I was in the mood for the cookie that is based on an urban legend (a recipe that I believe is on this site)--much more complicated, but similar in taste to this one.  Actually, this is a really close (not quite as rich) and very easy version.  Thanks!

I didn't find these cookies chewy, but they were still good.  I'm not sure if I made my cookies too big, but I had to bake them for 14 min.  They were still a little raw at 12, but maybe that's what makes them chewy.  I increased the flour (1 1/4 white & 1/2 c whole wheat), soda, and reduced salt as suggested. I also added 2 Tbsp ground Flax Seed and omitted the nuts.  I loved the vanilla flavour in the cookies.  I'm used to adding spices to my oatmeal cookies, so these were different for us but good.  UPDATE: I was disappointed with the cookies the next day.  They turned hard and dry - "granola like". I tried this recipe again, but reduced the flour (put in 1 1/3 cups - 1 c white and 1/3 c wh. wheat) and added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 2 dashes of ground cloves, and kept the soda at 1 tsp. and again added flax seed.  They turned out much better and baked perfectly at 12 min. Anymore than 1 1/2 cups flour, I think is just too much.  The dough was very hard to mix the first time.  Hooray they're chewy!

Yummy and chewy! Great recipe. Another way to prevent flatness is to reduce the amount of butter. Try using 2/3 cup of butter instead of 1 cup. I also used only 1 egg. I kept the other ingredients the same. The cookies turned out amazingly tasty and chewy. No flatness.

These cookies are fantastic!  I used Butter-Flavored Crisco instead of butter b/c everytime I use butter my cookies seem to turn out flat.  They turned out wonderful.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I made these yesterday and they are delicious!!  I added mini choc chips, craisins, and raisins.  I also took the advise of others and increased the flour to 1 1/2 c. and baking soda to 1 teaspoon.  I think this is the type of recipe you can add almost anything you prefer to the basic recipe and it would still be great.  Thanks Amy!

Very good cookie. I added 1cup of chocolate chips because we love chocolate here. I also didn't add the nuts. I also ued a tbsp to make them all even and under baked them as advised from previous reviews, very soft when coming out of the oven but they firm up a little after sitting for a little. VERY GOOD!!!

The cookies did not come out as chewy as I would have liked them, but my friends really enjoyed them.  Will try making them again and decrease the cooking time a minute or two.  Other than that, the cookie had a great taste and baked nicely.

I had lost my other chewy cc oatmeal cookies recipe so last night I reserched and found this recipe.  After reading all the reviews I decided to give it a try, and really HAPPY that I did.  Frist, I used 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 tsp of baking soda, and 1 tsp of cinnamon, and a whole bag of milk chocolate chips(Guittard the BEST)no salt at all because my butter was salted already.  I am DIABETIC so I always use Sugar Blend from Splenda and Brown Sugar from Splenda also.  I didn't use nuts.  I used my small cookie scooper from pamper cheff, and baked them at 325 degrees for 11 MINUTES, let them rest for a minute in the sheet and then transfered them to the rack.  My husband love warm cookies so he ate like 4 right away. I ate 1 and was really impress with the flavor.  But this morning I try one and WOW they are THE BEST CHEWY CC OATMEAL COOKIE EVER! They are soft and so chewy.  I love them!!!  My best tip don't overcook them if you want them to be chewy.  So far my best cookie ever, ENJOY!

The dough was incredible, but i dont know about after it came out of the oven. I did the alterations of 1/4 c more flour, 1/2 more baking powder, and 1/2 tbs less salt. They smell great, but are flat. I tried to cool the dough hopeing it would fluff them up a bit, but i think i was too late. I will definatly give this recipe another try because they did taste pretty great, but a little too much oatmeal..

Overall, they did taste good and VERY chewy... it was great.

Loved them!! I took the advice of other reviewers and added more of the flour and more of the baking soda. They needed a ew more minutes in the oven as well. Didn't add nuts and only added 3/4 cup of Chocolate chips.I may use the mini chips next time. Awesome cookie!

This was good. My cookies came out very thin though...did I do something wrong? I added some cinnamon (not sure how much, I did not measure) and more chocolate chips. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exact. Cookies take about 15 minutes to bake in my oven. Made 4 dozen BIG cookies. Not sure why they came out thin, but they are very good!!! The dough was amazing, I could not stop eating it. :)

My husband and I agree that our old reliable recipe from Betty Crocker cookbook is a lot better than this one.  He says:  too much oatmeal makes them chewy, but not good chewy.  I say:  not flavorful enough.
They're fine, but I won't make these again.

These were good, but I think they'd make better granola bars.  They weren't chewy at all.  I added a little extra flour and baking powder.  Next time, I'm going to make it in a brownie pan, cut it and separate it shortly after taking it out of the oven, then have it as bars/biscotti.

I am wondering what I did wrong, as everyone had great results for the most part with this recipe.  I did double it, and I am pretty sure my calculations were right.  I got through a few trays of them, and they were flatter than pancakes, so I added another tsp of Baking Soda and that made them hold their shape better.  Next time I will not double the recipe and we will see what happens.  Had a good taste, just fell apart and they were very thin.

I have been looking for a good chewy oatmeal cc cookie recipe because most recipes out there are for crisp cookies.  Well, these were great!  I made them exactly per the recipe, except I didn't have walnuts, so I just left them out.  They truly are soft and chewy and they definitely got a thumbs up from my husband.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 1/2 vegan margarine and 1/2 applesauce, evaporated cane juice for the white sugar, and egg substitute.  Then, instead of nuts, I used soaked raisins and chocolate chips.  I also added cinnamon to the dry mixture.  This was a really good base recipe, easily veganized and something I will definately make again.  I'm thinking next time dried cherries, walnuts, and dark chocolate chips will be good.  Thanks :)

I thought these were very good.  They have a great texture.  I omitted the nuts and next time I will add more choc chips.

These were yum and chewy with a great texture. I used dark chocolate choc chips, but I think milk chocolate would have been better. My boyfriend absolutely devoured these (if I had used milk chocolate I probably would have too!)

Very yummy cookies-but did some fine tuning.  I did add an extra 1/4 cup flour and an extra 1/2 tsp baking soda.  In this hot weather-cookies tend to flatten easier so I added an extra 1/4 tsp baking powder to that as well(if it's not humid I would leave out the powder).  Picture perfect shape to these cookies.  I also left out the nuts and added an extra cup of chips.  I  blended my oatmeal into powder-that's my taste preference- it comes out sooo good when you do that-sometimes oatmeal leaves a weird crunch that I don't like in my oatmeal chocolate chips.  I do think if you don't up the flour and baking soda-you will be left with some flat cookies.. The end taste is fabulous.  12 min is perfect cooking time-they do look a little undercooked but rest assured they are not!

This recipe makes a great cookie.  However, I did make a couple of minor changes.  I put half of the oatmeal in the blender and turned it into a powder, then added that to the flour mixture.  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and a scant 1/2 cup of rice krispies.  The results were fantastic!  Entering them in the State Fair competition - wish me luck!

These were pretty good. Had a weird after taste..don't know if it's the salt, baking soda or walnuts. Anyhow..my husband and kids ate them up. It is a time consuming cookie as far as baking time vs batches goes.

This recipe was great!!  I took the tip from others to reduce the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp.  I also reduced the amount of oatmeal to 2 cups instead of three.  I used dark brown sugar, peanut butter chips, and peanuts...so it really makes them peanut butter cookies, but they were SO great!!  It'll be my recipe for oatmeal anykind of chip cookie!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Wow, I really think these may be the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  I've made so many different recipes for oatmeal cookies, but there's something special about this one, I just can't figure out what it is!  They're perfectly moist and have a special, perfect taste.  I used butter flavoured shortening instead of butter, used salted peanuts for the nuts, and omitted the salt.  I also subbed 1/4 c wheat germ for the same amount of the flour.  Absolutely delicious.  This is my new oatmeal cookies recipe!

Excellent!
I use whole wheat flour, flaxseeds, and carob chips instead of the suggested ingredients. Turned out very very tasty - can't even tell you used "healthy" ingredients

These cookies really are good, which make them a five star recipe, but they are not unsusually delicious. Most oatmeal cookies I make taste very similar. I guess an oatmeal cookie is an oatmeal cookie! hehe

Darn, I don't know when I am going to learn to read the reviews before trying.  I have to agree these are okay and much too salty.  Not bad, just definitely not worth the raving reviews.

I made these cookies and they turned out awesome! At first, when I took them out of the oven, I thought they weren't done yet, but then I let them sit for about 5-10 minutes and they were done. Thank you for the great recipe!

Incredible cookies!  I used regular oats in place of the quick-cooking kind and added a teaspoon of cinnamon, but otherwise made as directed.  There will definitely be a next time for these babies!

I would like to give this recipe 5 stars however, it doesn't live up to it's name -- they're not 'chewy'.  Infact, they taste like unbaked cookies -- they taste like cookie dough.  I'm not certain they cooked all the way through; I even let them cook a little longer in the oven and on the cookie sheet but it didn't help.  The recipe says 'heaping spoonful' but with what size spoon?  For the record, I am no novice baker.  I would love for this recipe to turn out right -- any ideas?  I want to give this recipe 5 stars -- please help.  Thanks.

We love this recipe! Since finding this one, I've tried a few others, but my husband always says "Why didn't you make the good one?". I also substituted coconut for the nuts (as other reviews suggested) and it adds a nice flavor and chewiness.

pretty good. i followed others peoples suggestions with halving the salt and adding a bit more flour and baking soda.
we actually didn't like the chocolate chips in them and will use raisins next time but that's just our preference.

Awesome! In 10 minutes they were slightly golden in the bottom but otherwise looked undercooked, however, when cooled down they were nice and chewy just the way i like them. These were so easy to make, they need NO alterations unless you want more chocolate ...if anything, i would put more walnuts because i love them but they are perfect just the way they are. Absolutely LOVED them.

These are great! I've been making them for about a year and they always turn out perfect. I don't usually add the walnuts, but do add a bit of cinnamon and sometimes substitute some of the chocolate chips for butterscotch chips. My boyfriend loves them!

These are a nice chewy cookie, just what I was looking for. I followed the directions and they turned out perfect. I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts and used milk chocolate chips. I also put in a few raisins in half of the batch. I put the cookies in the fridge for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before putting them in the oven so they wouldn't spread out as much. I think I left them in the oven a minute longer too. I will be making these cookies again!

Tough one to rate... for me, they were only so, so. I baked some of them for 15 minutes (as some people suggested) - but I felt they were too dry. 12 minutes seemed better to me - they looked undone at first, but cooled to a good consistancy. Some spread - some didn't... don't know why! The Fire Academy recruits LOVED them, though. They said these were the best cookies so far (I make different recipes every week for the class). So - there it is!

These were pretty good.  Not the best cookies I've ever had, but they are very good.  Right out of the oven, I wasn't too impressed with the taste or texture of the cookies, but after sitting overnight, they seemed to taste better.  One thing, when you take them out of the oven, they don't look done, but if you let them sit on the cookie sheet for about 10 minutes, they firm up.

Excellent cookie- not too sweet. Use more or less oatmeal, depending on what kind of cookie consistency you like. The cooking time is more like 15 min. Delicious!

These are the best oatmeal cookies ever.  I omitted the nuts and used tiny semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Next time I need to make a double batch as these went very, very fast!!

I made half a batch without the walnuts.  Absolutely wonderful.  I thought they were undercooked at first but when you leave them on the sheet for the extra 5 minutes they cook a little further and firm up a bit allowing you to remove them.  This is my oatmeal cookie recipe!!

I made a mistake and mixed the ingredients on the stovetop.  The heat from the oven melted the chocolate chips, which made the cookies look and taste more chocolatey.  They were a hit!!  These will be made again for sure!

These are the best cookies ever, they do not last long in my house. The only thing i alter is i am allergic to nuts so i omit the walnuts and add extra chocolate chips, they are delicous.

I doubled the recipe and decided to transfer my dough from the mixer to a bowl to add the nuts and chips.  It was very difficult to mix by hand, so in the future I'll stick to the original recipe and do it all in the mixer.  I used an 1/8 cup scoop and with a double recipe ended up with 62 cookies.  I had to cook mine for close to 18 minutes. The cookies were delicious.  I took them to a church function and everyone loved them.  They're easy to make and as long as you use a mixer easy to work with.  We will definately be adding this to our recipe box!

Fantastic!  I'm making them again tonight!  I leave out the nuts.  I took some into work, and they went totally crazy for them!!!  Great cookie recipe, and you won't be disappointed.

A+ Excellent cookie! I had only old fashioned oats, which worked perfectly, and made them a little bigger so I baked them a little longer. Just so darn good!! Thank you for a new favorite!

Followed recipe except I added about a 1/2 cup more choc chips.  If you don't like a super dense cookie, cut down on the oatmeal about 1 cup.  Otherwise, turned out lovely.

Look no further for a great oatmeal cookie recipe -- this is the one! I did as others, and used only 1/2 teaspoon salt. I also omitted the walnuts, and used a bit more than a cup (11 ounces) of peanut butter/chocolate swirl chips. They are divine!

The only modification I made was using 1/2 cup white choc chips and 1/2 cup choc chips, and broke up a Hershey's bar I had.  Also, I used parchment paper, it really makes it easier for removing them.  Thanks for the recipe - it's definately a keeper!

Execellent cookie, I added coconut and some trail mix instead of walnuts and it turned out fantastic...they didn't last a full day even though it makes a lot of cookies.

OMG!!! This is the best cookie I have ever made! I never get good results with oatmeal cookies, and these are perfect. I had to stop myself from eating the whole first batch! I reduced the salt, to about 1.5 teaspoon. Other than that, this recipe is perfection!

Per other reviewers, I roasted the walnuts before chopping and adding them, and used 1/2 tsp salt. The walnuts added a really nutty, buttery flavor, melding nicely with the brown sugar and butter flavors. I thought the cookies were really good.

These were quite good indeed.  I'd always tried to wing it when adding oatmeal and the proportions in this recipe hit the right balance.  I'd consider perhaps toasting (then cooling) the nuts a bit before chopping and adding.  It made 2 1/2 dozen for me.

Great texture and taste but too salty.  I doubled the recipe and it was just to much salt.  I can tell that without the extra salt they'll be delicious though!

I made these for my family tonight and they were wonderful! I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt (like some others reccomended) and 1 1/2 cups semi sweet choc chips because we don't like nuts in our cookies. They were great and definitely something I will make again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Very good cookie!!!  My batch only made about 2 dozen though.  If you make a bigger cookie, like I did, than the cooking time might have to be a few minutes longer.  I cooked mine for 15 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. Cookies are delicious and chewy. I also added only half the salt and that was enough. I was out of walnuts, so I used 1/2 cup of raisins. It turned out great. Next time I will try adding the 1/2 cup of PB like someone said on another review. Sounded yummy! *****

Love, love, love these cookies.  I took advice from a few of the other reviews and added only 1/2 a tsp of salt, and only 2 cups of quick oats (although truth be told, I could've just as easily gone with 3, I just didn't have enough).  I made these for my brother and his housemates as a housewarming gift, and replaced the walnuts with 3/4 of a cup of Skor toffee chunks, and added an extra 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, because everybody likes more chocolate!! These chocolate toffee cookies were a bit hit, and I will definitely be making them again in other variations...thanks for the great recipe, Dr. Amy!

I was very happy to see that this recipe wasn't for a 'cake-like' cookie.  My cookies stayed moist and chewy.  I made a few alterations.  I only added 2 c. oats.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I used mini-choco. chips and 1/4 c. of flaxseed.

This recipe was great.  Nice, chewy delicious cookies!  I boiled a 1/2 of raisins and added them to the dough as well as a few dashes of cinnamon and the tiniest bit of nutmeg.  Next time I might use less salt, but overall, a wonderful recipe!

For a yummy change try Kaulha instead of vanilla extract and chopped hazelnuts (easily found at Trader Joes) instead of walnuts! We always add 2 cups of chocolate chips too! Next time I make it I'm going to try adding a cup of peanut butter, then it will be all of my families favorite cookies in one!

I have made these a few times and they are a favorite in my house.  I don't always get the amount that the recipie says, usually just over 2 dozen.  I also don't use the amount of oatmeal called for.  I did at first but they were to crumbly, so I now use 2 to 
2 1/2 cups of oatmeal and they work out great.

Very Chewy and good.  Don't stack them though, they will get stuck together.

i brought these to a luncheon and they were  a huge hit !   i, personally, wasn't crazy about these cookies.  they weren't as chewy as i expected.  they were soft, though.   next time i'll probably add more chocolate chips.

These turned out great!  I've been looking for a good Oatmeal Cookie Recipe, so I'm excited to have finally found one!  I did, however, add more oats, because my husband loves them that way.  I do recommend a longer cooking time, since 12 minutes left the middles not quite cooked all the way.  After that was altered, they were wonderful!

Really delicious. Mine didn't come out as moist as others have said, but they were somewhat moist and wonderfully crunchy. I used regular (not quick) oatmeal, which may be a bit drier, but for those who are wondering, it didn't really cause any problem. Would recommend throwing in some craisins (or, for those of you who can stomach them, raisins) for additional zip and to help with the moisture. Probably added more chips than called for, but how can that be wrong? Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies are simply delicious.  I added twice the chocolate chips, omitted the nuts, added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon and used half butter flavored shortening in place of 1 cup butter per other reviewers suggestions.  I will try omitting the cinnamon next time for a change.  Thanks for such a simple yet tasty recipe Dr. Amy!

This recipe was excellent. I'm a bit confused why some had trouble with the consistency of these cookies. These cookies are easy to make, set up great and and tasted wonderful. The only difference I made was I cut the salt to 1/2 a tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.

Delicious and chewy! I've never been a big fan of oatmeal but my husband wanted some. BUT this recipe rocks. I was not prepared for the vast amount of spread that the cookies did and I did have trouble getting them off the sheets. Is this normal for oatmeal cookies? I will definitely try to perfect my baking techniques for this recipe. Do try it.

These cookies are fantastic!!!  i can't understand how so many others had difficulties with this recipe.  i followed it to the letter (okay one change - i substituted pnut butter chips for the walnuts because, well, i don't really like walnuts and who doesn't like peanut butter and chocolate?!?!?)  anyway, they turned out beautifully!  the batter was not runny.  i didn't have to refrigerate it.  i didn't add any more flour.  the recipe is perfect AS IS!!  i was a little nervous trying this recipe because, even tho so many people sang its praises, a fair number complained as well.  
this recipe is GREAT!!!  2 thumbs up for Dr. Amy!!

These were good, even without the walnuts, but I think they could use a bit of cinnamon and that would really make them stand out.

Wonderful! I cut the recipe in half and used margarine and whole wheat flour. 15 mins. Great taste and with a good balance of oatmeal and chocolate. Thanks!
*I made this again with a mixer and they were awfully flat. The next time by hand was much better

This recipe was 'okay'. The dough turned out very sticky- possibly not enough oatmeal. 1 t. is WAY to much salt- it overwells the rest of the flavor. 
I would recomend Bobbies Oatmeal Cookies (also off this site)- they turned out WONDERFUL!

I've made these cookies for years now (they're also called Cowboy Cookies).  I toast pecans in a little butter and add them (cooled) with the chocolate chips.  I also add about a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Yummy.

Great cookies.  I took reviewers' suggestions and used half butter/half shortening, 1 1/2 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda.  Chilled the batter overnight.  They came out perfect!  Thanks.

I took the other reviewers advice and added extra flour and baking soda.  Added cinnamon too.  Last night I used Crisco instead of butter. Did not turn out chewy and soft.  Today I tried it with butter and came out great.

Added a heaping tsp. of baking soda which was a bit too much.  Added extra flour.  Omitted chocolate chips at the request of the kids.  Used butter flavored Crisco.  I will make these again and decrease the baking soda.  Wonderful texture and flavor.  Remember to chill the dough and use cool baking sheets to decrease "spreading".

I've been making these awesome cookies for a couple years now and they taste great! To make the recipe a little less fattening I use 1c fat free Nancy's yogurt instead of 1c butter. You can always substitute butter and yougurt 1 to 1. Sometimes, I'll use 1/2c of raisins and 1/2c choc chips too! Yummmmmy!

My ALL TIME FAVORITE oatmeal chocolate chip cookie!  I use this as a base for lots of cookies.  Dried cranberries and white chocolate chunk, peanut butter chips, mini m&ms, etc.  AWESOME!!!

I felt there was too much oatmeal in the recipe and it made them crunchy when they baked instead of chewy.  The taste is good, but they get crumbly and hard when they cool.

Very nice recipe, but be prepared for a very sweet cookie. I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon because there are no spices at all in the recipe. Yummy!

The cookies looked underbaked to me at 12 minutes, so my first dozen was a little crispy. I took a chance and removed the 2nd dozen at 12 minutes - as they cool, the outsides firm up nicely. 

Thanks, Dr. Amy!

These cookies are fabulous! They make an ordinary chocolate chip cookie extra delicious. My favorite cookies prior to experimenting with these were the regular chocolate chip cookies, however, I think I will never make a regular one again. Any cookie lover will fall in love again with a taste of this cookie.

With the following MODIFICATIONS, these cookies were the BEST!!  
 
In addition to the complete recipe with walnuts, choc chips, baking soda, etc. I added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 cup more flour, 1/3 cup shredded sweetened coconut, 2 Tbsp more white sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Sifted the dry ingredients.  
 
Pulsed 2 cups of the 3 cups of oatmeal in the food processor for about 4 seconds.  This gave it a slightly finer, more traditional texture but it was still chewy and delicious.

Excellent cookie!  I made it exactly as stated, except I used pecans.  They turned out wonderful.  I sent them to work with my husband, and he said they went crazy over them - gone in an hour.  Next time, I will try the extra flour & will use walnuts.  A definite keeper!

By far the best oatmeal cookie I have had.  I to used 1 1/2 cups of flour.  No need to search for another chocolate chip oatmeal cookie again.  I followed the cooking instructions exactly that resulting in a very chewy cookie.  I split the recipe in hald and put 1 cup milk chocolate chips in one half and 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup dried cranberries in the other.  They were amazing.  My daughter loves smarties so I will try some with that next time.

I just tried this recipe last night for my husband's late Father's day surprise! He absolutely loves them! I added a little more chocolate chips to the mix because he loves chocolate!

Personally, I never seen or heard of this recipe but, my husband had this type of cookie that was bought in stores. Thanks to you, he LOVES these cookies WAAAY MORE than the "store" ones!

These cookies are heavenly. I would've never thought to combine oatmeal and chocolate chips - and NEVER walnuts. These are a big change from my usual cookies I make. I used milk chocolate chips instead to produce a milder flavor in the cookie. I will definitely be making these again.

Very easy to make.  Make sure that the spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet are heaping - they'll taste much better.  Also, my oven cooked them perfectly in 8 minutes so keep an eye on them.

these are the greatest cookies.  my daughter is allergic to nuts so i substitute 
the 1 cup of nuts with 1/4 cup raisins and 1/4 cup of dried cranberries.  i also
bake them at 350 degrees (convection oven).  these cookies are not too sweet.

It might have been me since I am kind of a beginner but this just didn't work. The batter was thin, cookies flat and really didn't have much flavor. Nobody wanted and threw out the whole batch.

A good cookie, but not the best I've made. The first sheet I made with heaping tablespoons, and they came out dry and puffy, not chewy at all. So, the next sheet I made I practically doubled the amount of dough per "drop" and flattened them slightly before baking. This made a MUCH better cookie - flatter, larger, and chewy like (I'm assuming) they're supposed to be!  :)

A perfect recipe. You can not buy cookies this good in the store.  These are great.  I used pecans because my husband hates walnuts.

I made a double batch of these cookies tonight, and they are delicious!  I did find, like some other reviewers, that 12 minutes at 325 degrees wasn't enough cooking time, so I baked them at 350 and they came out great.  Very chewy, great texture... YUMMMMMM!

These great cookies scream for raisins which make them all the more fantastic. I omitted the chocolate chips and walnuts and replaced them  with 1 1/2 c raisins and 1/2 c of butterscotch chips.

This is a terrific recipe.  I used a little more oats (about 1/2 cup) and more chips (about 1/2 cup).  I also made a few cookies without any chips at all, and they were great!  Great consistency, chewy, not too sweet.  Perfect cookie!

Great recipe!  I was majorly craving this type of cookie and Iv'e had this recipe in my box for a while now.  They turned out perfectly.  Soft & crispy at the same time.  I did add more chocolate chips and three tablespoons of cocoa powder.  I have one complaint, but it can easily be fixed.  The recipe was scaled to make 42 cookies and this recipe made exactly half that!  I didn't make overly large cookies so i'm not sure why this happened, but I'll simply change the scaled recipe amount next time, and there will be a next time!

These are the best chocolate chip oatmeal cookies ever!! And trust me, I am picky when it comes to cookies. The cookies were very chewy without being "cake-like".  I made them extra big so I didn't get as much as the recipe says. Everyone who tried them were in awe!

This is a fantastic cookie!  It's easy to make, chewy, and delicious!  My husband just loved them, he must have had atleast four or five in one sitting! The only thing I would change next time is that I'd add more chocolate chips, my husband agress too!

I have made these cookies at least a half dozen times and I keep getting requests for them at work and at home.  I followed the helpful hints and cut out the salt and increased the flour and baking soda, to 1 3/4 cups and 1 teaspoon, respectively.  and I bake them at 335 for 12min exactly , no matter what color they are I take them out .They are always chewy and delicious. (Thank you Fervent Foodie!)  I add ground flaxseed (so I can call them healthier) and sometimes I do a half of cup of raisins and a half a cup of chocolate chips.  (I love raisins in oatmeal cookies).  I definitely chill the dough at least a half an hour and they never spread, in fact, I have to smush them a little if I don't want them to look like haystacks.  Either way they re chewy and delish.

Didn’t work well the GF flour and flax eggs. They didn’t stick together well and came out crispy. Would likely not make again.

Taste was outstanding!  I baked it on a Silpat as well as an ungreased pan.  There was no difference in the texture.  I, tried it at 350° for 12 minutes and it was a tad more crispy.  Liked the cookie anyway.

I read the reviews before making these. I cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon and increased the flour by 1/2 c. Then I put down wax paper and put flour on it and rolled into a 2 inch roll and cut them with a bench knife about  3/4 inch thick. I baked them longer. They turned out good. I took pics but there is no place to upload here. Oh almost forgot, I used chpped pecans instead of walnuts

Cut the 1/2 cup white sugar and only used the 1 cup of brown. 

I just think most cookie recipes use WAAAAY too much sugar. They were still good and still plenty sweet.

Great texture. I added 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda like other reviewers said. I found that they were a tad salty though and I used unsalted butter and not a whole tsp of salt. I would half the salt next time. Other wise they’re great.

These were delicious!  I made them just as the recipe was written, except  for the addition of 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.    I had no trouble with the cookie dough spreading.  Definitely a keeper.

Followed the others reviews plus added some cinnamon. They are a good chewy cookie but seems to be missing some “ump”.

This has been my go-to cookie recipe for years! I started baking them for my boyfriend in our tiny Seattle apartment at least 12 years ago. Because of the author's description, we coined them "boyfriend cookies" and still call them by this to this day - I just made them last week, in fact. My "boyfriend" and I have now been happily married for over 10 years, and baking these cookies every so often just might have a tiny part in that. Our children love them too! Thank you!

I am only giving this a 3 star. They were ok. I made the recipe with the modification of extra 1/2 cup flour and baking soda. I would make again but would make the original recipe. I do prefer a flatter cookie and these tasted good just were like pucks

A bit disappointing from the reviews. And if you make the batter, use it right away. It does not come out well after an hour of refrigeration before baking.

I used a little coconut sugar, maybe a 1/4 cup brown sugar. Added chopped dates, raisins, dried cherries, coconut, and lots of walnuts & pecans. Oh yes some flax seed. These cookies were crispies on outside and chewy on inside. Delicious. I had a couple for breakfast with coffee.

supper delicious, chew, and very popular!
one if the secret to the taste, the butter should be room temperature, and the chocolate chip should be Hershies Semi Sweet.

So super sweet and buttery. Not that that’s a bad thing! If you’re looking for a healthier oatmeal cookie recipe, go look elsewhere. I cut the white sugar in half, but next time I would skip it all together. It’s too dang sweet. I would also do one stick butter and sub the other stock with applesauce to keep up a chunkier consistency.

I made this as written, except I halved the recipe. Oh, I used regular oats, not quick cooking. 
There's a lot to like about this cookie, its rich in flavor, chewy, crispy. It did spread quite a lot, making a thin cookie, which my mother loves. 
I baked one batch true to the recipe, then chilled the dough while waiting for the first tray to back. I also added about a tablespoon and a half of extra flour. Those cookies still spread, but slightly less. 
So next time, I might try bread flour (it absorbs more liquid) I'll use quick cooking oats (again, they absorb more liquid) and will chill the dough before baking. Hopefully that'll give me the chewy, crisp cookie without it looking like a dinner plate. :) 
And I will make it again, overall, its one of the best cookie recipes I've tried.

I followed the recipe but had to use bread flour because I was out of all purpose and I also added just a tiny splash of almond extract (very small amount since almond is SO strong). The cookies came out so chewy and delicious. I had no issues with spreading, but I also used bread flour which would help with that issue.  I baked half off immediately and am chilling the rest for later.

Made this many times...today is the first time i changed it. I had a bag of cranberries left from Christmas that i didnt use so i boiled them in sugar until they split..mashed them slightly, drained them and spread on a cookie sheet and baked them at 225 until they were "raiseny". I added these instead of walnuts and used extra dark chocolate baking chips to counteract the extra sugar ...amazing!

I replaced the nuts with Reese's chip and extended the time from 12 minutes to 15 minutes. Everyone who's tried my cookies absolutely loved them! The combination of the chocolate & peanut butter really sold it.

Excellent Recipe- I completely melted the butter on stove and lightly caramalized it. I used salted butter, so I did not add any additional salt. I chilled overnight in the refrigerator as well.

This recipe is almost identical to the one on the inside of the Quaker Oats container lid, except the recipe on the container coincidentally includes all the suggested modifications that are listed in the reviews. More flour, more baking soda, less salt.

I added extra chocolate chips and walnuts and 3 eggs instead of 2.  The cookies tasted pretty good but next time I make use this recipe I plan to use a full cup of sugar. The cookies were good but lacked the sweetness raisins provide in an oatmeal cookie. Great recipe.

The best Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies I've ever made/tasted. It took a little bit longer than the 12 min (maybe 15 min.).  They were delicious.

Had to add 3 additional eggs to make the oats wet and cling together. Made 18 servings of good sized cookies.

Tasted good, might have to tweak the butter though as it was a bit too much.

I followed the directions exactly and they turned out delicious . I wish I would have read the reviews earlier I then would have put the oatmeal cookie in the fridge before cooking it .I forgot that little trick. I did put it on parchment paper the first batch and I think that was a mistake because they didn't brown, but still delicious.

Wonderful recipe! I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the dry flour mixture before mixing wet and dry. I used mini chocolate chips in half the dough and raisins in the other half. The first batch went in the oven as soon as the dough was made, but the other batches had to wait 30 minutes or so before going in and they came out thicker than the first batch that did not rest before baking. There was one ball of dough that I rolled in my hands instead of just dropping on the parchment paper and it came out looking smoother than the others that were dropped with a spoon.

OMG, so yummy! I followed the advice to increase the flour by 1/2 cup, baking soda by 1/2 teaspoon, and decreased the salt by 1/2 teaspoon. Also substituted 1 cup Craisins (soaked in hot water to plump) + 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. To die for!!! Chewy, moist, and stayed plump when cooking. Definitely making these many times more!

These cookies are AMAZING!   I modified slightly by adding in some chopped pecans along with the chopped walnuts and I also added in Reese Peanut Butter Chips along with the Nestle Milk Chocolate chips.   DELICIOUS!     Will definitely be making these again.

I made a double batch and was unsure that all the dry ingredients wouldn't be too much, but the dough was absolutely perfect! Very buttery taste, very nice consistency. I didn't have to adjust the time or temperature at all and it baked to a lovely golden brown.

These cookies turned out great! I had to use two baking sheets because they made about 16 huge cookies. They baked for about 15 minutes in the oven instead of 12 like the recipe stated.

These were exactly what my man wanted! He had great memories of his grandmothers oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and this recipe did not disappoint! I followed others advise and added 1/2 cup of flour and a full teaspoon of baking soda. I chilled the dough and used a cookie scoop so they were all the same size.

Mmmmmmm.... Yummmmmmmy! What an amazing recipe. The whole family loves these! Everyone was able to put their own spin on their dough. Plain, dried cranberries, cinnamon and nutmeg, chocolate chips plain and with walnuts. There are so many combinations and they are all so good.

This cookie recipe was overall really good but it is a bit sweet so I recommend putting a bit less sugar. I also added 1 teaspoon of baking soda and it made the cookies nice and fluffy. I would recommend it to a friend

Perfectly delicious! I made a few edits after reading other reviews and to please the kids. I added and extra 1/4 flour, only 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 C salted butter + 1/4 C unsalted butter, 1 tsp baking soda + 1/2 tsp baking powder, no nuts, and I used 10 oz dark chocolate chips. I blended the oats in the food processor for the smoother texture the kids prefer. Yum!

I did not add the white sugar, Just personal preference, seemed like too much sugar. Also used pecans instead of walnuts and baked them in a 9 x 13 pan for bars. Very happy with the recipe.

I made the recipe as is and found it delicious but with a bit too much oatmeal.  I feel a more even split between oatmeal and flour will be perfect.  I am currently trying 1cup less oatmeal and 3/4-1 cup more flour to see the difference.

Delicious.  Instead of walnuts, I add raisins.  Pure heaven!  I get asked for the recipe wherever I take them.  YEs, over stirring will make them flat.  Stir just until its mixed...no longer.

I made these cookies exactly as written.  They turned out perfectly.  I did not have any issue with them spreading too much.  I did not flatten dough before baking and baked them only the 12 minutes called for in the recipe.

Followed suggestions from others: 1.75 cups flour and 1 tsp baking soda. Also added a dash of cinnamon. Baked at 350 for 14 minutes to a light golden, slightly under baked finish :). I like that they aren’t as sweet as other cookies!

Agreed the original recipe is a bit sticky and they end up flat. But they are slightly crisp on the bottom an soft on the top like I like. Second time I added too much flour. ?? So I recommend doing 1.5 cups of flour if you don't mind them flattish.

this is a very good cookie recipe. My cookies turned out nice and plump.. however a tad dry(I blame it on myself). I followed instructions from another review to not over beat the ingredients. VERY GOOD COOKIES!

This is my signature cookie recipe with the following edits: add 1/3 of dried cranberries for contrast and tartness and reduce milk chocolate chips from 1c to 3/4c and add 3/4c of white chocolate chips. Kitchen stinky goodness.

We loved these so much! I did the recipe but heaping cups of flour, overflowing brown sugar as well, a little extra salt and vanilla. I baked a bit extra, which is just how we prefer them In our house!
I do this with all my cookies. Extra flour to add chewiness, brown sugar, salt, and vanilla for taste. I prefer Watkins baking vanilla. Best cookies!

This is absolutely my favorite chewy chocolate chip cookies recipe. The only thing I changed was baked them for 13 minutes. All ingredient amounts I followed the recipe for. They are flavorful and SO chewy. They are flatter - but I expected that with the amount of oatmeal in it. So delicious!

I used vegan margarine instead of butter. I added dark chocolate chips instead of the other kind. I used whole-wheat flour instead of white flour. I omitted the vanilla extract because I don't believe in extract. Lastly, I omitted the walnuts because I don't consider walnuts to be truthful.  I also used an ice cream scoop to make giant cookies instead of small ones. They were delicious! Perfect recipe.

These cookies turned out nice, only thing is you have to watch them so they don't burn. I even added a cup of dried, sweet cranberries instead of walnuts, very nice flavor profile indeed.

I live in a high altitude city; did make suggested changes: 1/4 c additional oats; 1/2 c flour; 1/2 T baking soda; only 1/2 t salt. 1/2 batch simply chocolate chip; 1/2 batch chocolate chip/butterscotch chip. Yummy!

I modified the recipe to match my pantry emptying activity. That meant using one cup of self-rising flour, half cup almond flour, a little turbinado sugar with the brown sugar and white sugar, a cup of and a half of walnuts and pecans, and a cup and a half of chocolate chips. you can't skip on the chocolate chips! I used my KitchenAid for the entire thing and refrigerated the dough for maybe 20 minutes That was after my melted butter disaster. they turned out super yummy, and it's probably a good thing I didn't find this recipe earlier because my husband and I already need to lose weight!

I made these once, and they were so good!! Everyone loved them! They were so soft that they fell apart though. So it was a while jumbled mess in the Ziploc bag, but no one cared that they had to eat it with a spoon lol it was that good!

Amazing! I’ve always gotten compliments on these cookies. I love how walnuts go with chocolate but I never even thought about adding them to chocolate chip cookies. My mom doesn’t like eating too much chocolate, so when I make her cookies, I swap out the walnuts and chocolate chips for sliced almonds, c craisins, and coconut flakes. She loves them!

For those of you getting flat cookies it may be a couple of things you are doing.  Salt is necessary in this recipe for the chemical levening process with baking soda.  If you have cut out or reduced the salt that may be the problem.
Also, don’t bake the dough immediately after making it.  The butter is too soft and melts too quickly in the oven leaving you with flat cookies.  Put the dough in the fridge for a few hours (or overnight) before baking and you will have delicious fluffy cookies!
This recipe is wonderful as is and I like a little hint of salt in the dough.  I think it adds layers to the flavor to balance the sweetness.

If you’re trying to make big cookies, don’t use this recipe. If you’re trying to make small, chewy cookies, ok, use this recipe. Your cookies will be flat because the recipe calls for a butt-load of butter. So much butter. So much butter that it made me think I was about to make 50 cookies, but then I looked at the other quantities  of ingredients and just thought that maybe I’d slipped and hit my head and had forgotten how to make cookies. So I followed the ingredients and prep and yeah, I mean, it’s too much butter. HOWEVER, these are chewy, oatmeal, chocolate chip cookies... so, no one lied.

These cookies turned out pretty good. They taste really good, and aren't too sweet. However, some of the cookies fell apart even after baking for 12 minutes and about 10 minutes of cooling, so I would bake them for a few minutes longer.

The cookies were great. They didn’t brown on top like I expected but that may have been my camper oven problem.

It was overall a good recipe, but there were a few problems. They were really flat, which I usually don't mind, but the edges were slightly burned, and the texture was weird. I tried some things the reviews said,the but nonetheless, they still turned out flat. I would still make this again though.

After reading the reviews, I also added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and increased the b. Soda to 1/2 tbsp. I omitted the walnuts and added 1 cup of flaked coconut. The cookies were awesome...definitely a keeper!!

I accidentally used thick cut oats instead of quick-cooking oats, which made the cookies chewy but a little bit more chunky.  Everyone loved them.

I baked in a convection oven so cookies came out chewy inside and crispy on the outside. I also used 65% chocolate chips.  Delicious.

Made this cookie for today’s 4th of July block party. After reading several of the reviews, I added another 1/2 c.of flour and another 1/2 tsp. do baking soda. Also, instead of all butter, I put in half butter and half shortening. I did not experience flat cookies at all. Increased the temperature to 350. Baked some on convection and some regular bake. Both types turned out fine. Perhaps the convection cookies rose a little more.

All in all, they are very moist and chewy with a great flavor, and I would make them again!

This was very good. I did have to cook them a lot longer than 12 mins, but maybe I made them too big? Otherwise, they were tasty and not flat at all as other reviewers have said.

OK...glad (but really) that I read a lot of the reviews before starting these.  I mainly followed Erin's post as I'd been thinking I'd maybe need to chill the dough before baking.  There was a Sunset world's best chocolate chip cookie some years back that was similar to this (and had cinnamon!); dough was chilled for several hours first.  Didn't have enough fridge room to do that -- 4th of July coming up, etc.  So I stuck it in the freezer for a few minutes. Did bake them for 12 minutes, although they wouldn't have come off the Silpat well at that point so I let them set a few minutes.  They spread VERY LITTLE (and I used a couple tbsp of dough for each).  Which is sort of surprising considering the large amount of butter!  The verdict?  They're GOOD -- will definitely make again!

Made them! Reeeally sweet! My husband and I love adding new ingredients to recipes so we added mini mallows! Really good idea except if the mallow ends up on the bottom of the cookie, it sticks to the pan. Better to not incorporate mallows into the batter but garnish on top before putting in the oven! Better try next time! Also, 12 minutes is just right. Accidentally left them in a little longer and they are CRISPY! So don’t leave in as long if you like softer cookies.

Excellent! Made only one (1) change. Instead of butter, I used coconut oil! Absolutely delicious, soft and chewy. My whole family loved it. Easy to make too.

I substituted almonds and added shredded coconut to these cookies, but the base of this cookie is amazing! Cook for less time, you get chewy cookies. Bake them too long (like I did the first time) they turn into almost like a big granola bar. Win win!

Everyone in my house was complaining that I was making oatmeal cookies. My husband said ‘I never met an oatmeal cookie that I liked’. I never did either. But guess what!!! We all loved them!!!! I didn’t use nuts or cinnamon. I doubled the amount of chocolate chips in place of the nuts. My youngest likes it better than store bought cookie dough! Woo hooo!!!

For the first time ever I failed to read the reviews so my cookies came out super flat and didn't taste very good.  If I try them again I'll add the extra flour and not over beat them.

I followed the recipe, except I ran out of vanilla, so I substituted almond flavoring. I did chill dough for about an hour and then baked cookies at 335 for 12 minutes. They are delicious! My husband kept murmuring yum while eating them.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and added 1/2 cup more flour, doubled the baking soda and halved the salt. I used rolled oats instead of quick oats and these came out amazing. I also divided the dough in half into 2 bowls before adding the chocolate chips, then added the chips to one bowl, then for my hubby who "doesn't like chocolate" I used reese's peanut butter chips instead in the other bowl with half.

I made this exactly as written though I used a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips and eliminated the nuts due to nut allergy.  I followed a previous suggestion to bake at 335 for 12 minutes after the first tray at 325 for 14 minutes where still not done.  The result was a chewy cookie.  Love them

I omitted the nuts and made 9 large cookies on 1 sheet.  You have to keep an eye on the time for the next batches.  The 1st batch was perfect, but the next batches were a little crunchy.  I am making another batch right now!

Used cut up mini eggs instead of chocolate chips, cranberries instead of walnuts, rolled into 1 inch balls, slightly flattened with a spoon and baked at 375 for 10 to 12 minutes. Came out well.

I prepared this recipe pretty much as is since I did not check any reviews before making it. I instinctively used 1/2 tsp of salt and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. As for everything else I used the ingredients in the proportions stated. I think the outcome was awesome. The flavor and texture were both excellent and as someone mentioned, it is a pretty basic cookie recipe. I like the fact that it has oatmeal which I love. It makes for a twist in the chocolate chip cookie with the extra fiber of the oatmeal. I absolutely love it and will definitely make it again. Now my recommendations: Watch for the oven temperature and baking time. Follow both as the recipe states. The cookies will continue cooking after been taken out of the oven.  Don't over bake nor put them in an oven that is too hot this will spread your cookie without fail. It is also important to be careful with the temperature of the butter. A butter that is too soft is already too warm for this recipe yielding a spread cookie. The remnant heat of a cookie sheet renders a spread cookie. To prevent this, let cookie sheets completely cool off after removing the cookies from them. A quick way to cool off cookie sheets is by sprinkling the back of the sheet with cold water using the sprinkler of the sink. Set it aside far from the heat and put the next batch in another sheet while the first cools off. This is valid for dark or light colored baking sheets. This trick also works if you use silicone mats on your cookie sh

I made these just about exactly as written in the recipe. I ground the oats in my coffee grinder (I don’t like lumpy oats in my cookies).  I baked them 14 minutes which is two minutes longer and they still didnt brown enough.  But they tasted yummy and my family loved them!

I followed the recipe exactly (except that I added 1/2 a cup coconut, and only added 2 1/2 cups oats because I REALLY wanted coconut), and they turned out beautifully! Tasty, chewy, and dangerously “moreish.” I had no problem with them flattening too much, and for those that did, your butter may have been a bit TOO soft. I would not change a thing with this recipe (other than adding my beloved coconut), and will be using it as my “go to.” Thank goodness it makes so many because I cannot stop eating them!

Delicious batter, fairly good baked cookie, crazy flat. The reviews with 4-5 stars but making all kinds of adjustments to fix the recipe to turn out a proper cookie are too generous! Keep looking for a better recipe...

Love these cookies.  I used mini m&m's instead of chocolate chips, no nuts. and 1 tsp of vanilla bean paste and 1 tsp pure vanilla extract.  My cookies were quite large, I used an ice cream scoop to measure them out.  I ended up having to bake them for about 20 to 25 minutes at the suggested temp. of 325°.   I got 20 large cookies out of the batter, next time I might use a smaller scoop.   These are staying in my recipe list.

Love it! I adapt it to be gluten free. Used 3 flours:- 1/2 coconut, 1/2 lentil, 1/4 white rice. And less sugar.  And 1/4  more butter. So u can take teaspoon full batter and roll it a bit. Tastes fabulous. Thanks

This are wonderful, made with the small tweaks noted by various reviewers: added 3/4 cup more flour, used salted butter and reduced salt to 1/2 tsp; used old-fashioned rolled oats rather than quick-cooking, chilled the dough for 2 hours before baking and baked at 335 for 12 minutes.  GREAT texture and flavor!

Mine didn't spread at all!  I ended up flattening them a bit before baking.  I added hemp seeds and ground flax seed...like 2 heaping tablespoons.  I wish I had raisins.  I also added cinnamon. I didn't have brown sugar so I used coconut sugar.  I thought they were very good!

These cookies tasted just like my grandma used to make. I followed the suggested instructions of adding the extra flour and baking soda, as well as leaving out salt when using salted butter. I also used the cook temperature of 335 F for 12 minutes and letting cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring them  to a cookie rack. Perfection!

I made a couple of minor changes as mentioned by other reviewers; flour and salt increased slightly.  What I want to. mention is that I mixed the ingredients one evening, refrigerated the dough overnight and made the cookies in the morning after bringing the dough to room temp.  They came out just perfect.  Also in forming the cookie, I scooped up the dough with my hands, formed a ball, put onto the cookie sheet and then flattened it with my hand to a 3 inch diameter.  They spread a bit in coking at 325f  but retained their shape nicely.
I’ll make these again. Thank you for the recipe.

Very likely the best cookie I have ever tasted. Made a batch for work, and they disappeared almost as fast as the batch at home when my 3 year old tasted them.

I'm currently making another double batch with 2.5 cups of semisweet chips. 
I'm going to hide half of them and then find a way to burn 1000 extra calories every day.

Maybe it's a good thing a tree fell in my backyard...

Excellent recipe! I followed many other reviewers warning not to over-mix this! I also followed some suggestions to reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, added 1/2 cup of flour, and added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Definitely one of the best cookie recipes I have ever come across.

My grandchildren love these oatmeal cookies. I make some with and some without chocolate chips to please all palates. They are always a winner.

These are delicious.  I did have to bake them at 350 degrees though.  Otherwise, the recipe was spot on.  It could just be my oven also.  Don't be discouraged at all.  I'll be putting this recipe in my file for sure.

What did I do? They melted down in oven to one big  blob! The only thing I can guess is that I got cold baking soda out of fridge. Also, at 7000 elevation. Feedback welcome.

I didn’t have quick cooking oats, only thick cut so I put the entire 3 cups into the food processor and broke them down.  I also used gheardelli dark choc chips.  Very good

I made a half batch. Changes to original recipe based on comments by others - increased flour to 3/4 cup (or to 1 1/2 cups for full recipe), used demerara sugar instead of light brown, and 1 cup old fashioned oats plus 1/2 cup quick oats. Increased soda to 1 tsp for 1/2 batch. Increased walnuts and chocolate chips by a bit. Decreased salt because I used salted butter. Dropped by tablespoon. Increased cooking time by 2 to 3 minutes until bottoms were light brown. Made 24 good sized cookies. My cookies did not spread Maybe a little sweet for my taste but it's a cookie. Very nice. I like a good oatmeal cookie with nuts and these are very tasty.

This is a very good recipe. I used an equal split of whole wheat flour and unbleached flour. I also added 1/4 cup more of chocolate chips and this time around I split the chips into butterscotch and dark chocolate. Baked these for 13 minutes instead of 12 and they were perfect. Crunchy and chewy all at the same time.

So incredibly average. Not the worst cookies, but not worth the effort. If you are gonna make these I would agree adding the extra flour and baking soda as stated in other comments, but honestly it’s not worth it.

I read the reviews as I usually do and I did follow the suggestions to add 1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 tsp more baking soda and I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I chilled the dough for about 1 1/2 hours but it was pretty hard to scoop.  Next time I will chill the dough only 30 minutes.  I baked the cookies at 335 degrees for 12 minutes, but when I looked at them, I thought they looked a little too raw in the middle, so I baked them for an additional 2 minutes.  I left them on the cookie sheet for the 5 minutes, then put them on wax paper.  They were pretty chewy, but I think next time I will try baking them for just the 12 minutes.   They were really good!  Everbody at our superbowl party loved them!  I may also half the recipe next time because this made about 5-6 dozen medium sized cookies!

I've made this recipe over and over again. Each time, everyone raves about it. (So much that people demand the recipe.)
I've considered leaving the cookies in the oven a bit longer, however they firm up when they cool, so I think the recommended baking time is correct.

I read a lot of reviews before I made these and used some of the advice given. I followed the recipe exactly as is although I didn't use nuts and I added 2 tbsp brewers yeast and 2 tbsp flaxseeds to make them LACTATION COOKIES. I then cooked them for 12 mins at 335 as many suggested

I had to make some changes, due to an unexpected shortage of oatmeal. One cup of oatmeal was subbed for a half cup of flax meal. I also used a half cup of whole wheat flour incorporated with the regular flour. I am happy with the cookie's consistency! My last fun change was to use half chocolate, half cinnamon chips.

These were just ok. The salt amount is excessive and they came out salty. The spread a bit much too, but I also think it was due to the salt even tho I added more baking soda. I would try again with the comment suggestions

Overall pretty good.  I did add the extra half cup flour as many had recommended but the cookies were still missing something.  My son suggested a bit of cinnamon and so I sprinkled some into the batter I had not yet baked and it definitely helped.

It's funny, I followed the recipe exactly because everybody was saying how they needed more flour and baking soda or else the cookies would be flat. I wanted flat, chewy cookies so I didn't do any modifications and, wouldn't you know it, mine came out exactly as the recipe intended.
The cookies are OK but nothing special.

It's so good! I will definitely make it again. I changed the original recipe a little bit, because I only had 1 cup of quick oatmeal. I increased the flour from 1 1/4 cups to 1 1/2 cups. I also added 1 teaspoon of water when mixing all the ingredients.

I did alter the recipe a little bit--making it with dark chocolate chips, coconut, dried cranberries, and pecans, but the base recipe makes a really great soft cookie!

This cookie was awesome, but I had to add 1/4 cup more of flour.  It makes a lot too. It is the perfect consistency of a chewy cookie. We will make these again.

modified recipe using gluten-free flour and coconut flour, more brown sugar than white, and omitted nuts due to allergy issue. Moist and chewy.  Made approximately 60 1 inch cookies.

Delicious and hearty! I did as other reviewers suggested and increased the baking soda to 1 tsp. For personal preference I increased it to 1.5 cups each of chocolate chips and walnuts to make a heartier cookie.  I also adjusted the baking temp to 350 degrees for 10 mins, removing them from the sheet to cool immediately after taking them from the oven. They came out perfectly chunky with chips & nuts and moist on the inside and crisp on the outside. 10/10!

Not sure what’s wrong with this recipe. I followed it to a T.  Should’ve read the reviews first.  Completely 
Spread out flat like those “lace” cookies.  
I rolled the whole flat mess and made a log that looked like . REALLY!!  Then I cut into little logs. 
The taste was good but NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE!!

I cut the recipe in half on my first attempt at baking these for a cookie exchange; they were a hit! Kids, husband, co-workers loves them! I did find them just a tad bit heavy on the salt so may reduce the salt to half on the next round! Overall great recipe!

Delicious cookie!  I used a tad less sugar and a tad more vanilla).    Love the oatmeal, gives it such a nice texture.  The resulting cookie is not overly sweet, but very satisfying.
I use milk chocolate chips because that's my personal preference.  Great cookie!!

Yum! Took a few suggestions (1.5 cup of flour, 1 tsp of baking soda) I also added cranberries and cinnamon. The recipe doesn’t need it, just like the flavor. This is hands down the best oatmeal cookie recipe I’ve found!

I'm not sure how mine came out so different from everyone else's, but they did. They came out flat and crispy. Not chewy at all. And yes, I followed the recipe to a T.  And in my opinion, there was just way too much oatmeal. I like mine too taste like a cookie not a breakfast crisp. There is so much oatmeal, I felt like someone took a bowl of my breakfast, added chocolate chips and baked it. I couldn't find my usually recipe, so I thought I'd give this one a try. I'm sorry I did. The entire batch went into the trash  : (

Would definitely make it again, but may decrease oats as it seemed a little too much.  Others have increased flour, I may try that & see if the dough firms up a little more & makes the finished cookie a little fluffier.  I also doubled up on the chocolate chips, because really, there is no such thing as too much chocolate.  =)

I followed the directions exactly, they were very flat  and seemed to have way too much butter in them… I would recommend one and a half sticks of butter instead of two ... they look nothing like the picture ... I would classify this cookie more as a lacy cookie crisp

Excellent! We all loved these cookies! I used rolled oats, instead of quick cooking and instead of any nuts I added an extra cup of chocolate chips. Since some of the reviews said to add more flour, I did so, but only 1/8 cup extra. They turned out perfect!

bomb diggity. I find these bake better when I make them into little pucks and take them out to set early, rather then little balls on the pan. Try with any form of chocolate or Nut  you like and will taste amazing.

Made these with no changes to the recipe, but I did have to leave real quick after making the dough so it went in the fridge for about 20-30 mins before I cooked them.  Came out chewy and delicious!  Actually made them for my BF work and all his co-workers ask me to make them every time I go in there.

this cooking is AMAZING!!! I added 1/4 cup flour as suggested and leave out the salt since I used salted butter. I used half quick cooking oats and half rolled oats for texture and it turns out great. My family, colleagues even my daughter loves it.

Amazing cookie based recipe.  4 stars due to number of alterations. Cream the butter & sugar for 3-5 minutes. I used salted butter, so did not add salt. I also added half a cup more of both the oats and four. I added mini m&ms.  There was no spreading or overcooked edges.

These are delicious and came out great for me. Not at all flat. I absolutely followed the recipe except I also added a cup of dried cranberries and used rolled oats instead of quick ones. I also cooked in a slightly cooler oven 300 degree convection for about an extra 5 minutes. Didn't really time that, just took them out when they looked ready. I lined the cookie sheets with baking parchment. I will  definitely make again!

I should have trusted my gut when I saw to preheat at 325.  Most cookies are higher.  They were far from done at 12 minutes, so  I cranked up the temp to 375 and then had to babysit them and check every couple of minutes.  It took almost twice as long and the cookies spread too much.  They taste good, but the recipe is wrong.  I'll go back to my regular but ho-hum recipe.

Love these! I read other reviews before making these and decided to add an additional 1/4 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp of baking soda. I did not decrease the salt, as my husband and I like salty cookies and I used unsalted butter. I didn't think they tasted too salty. Will definitely make again!

Made some modifications:

Subbed margarine for 1/2 the butter 
Subbed 1/2 whole wheat flour
Added entire bag (12oz) of chocolate chips

I really enjoyed this recipe! I failed to mix properly after adding oats/nuts/chocolate, so the last 4 or 5 cookies were dry, but still edible.  I will probably reduced flour by 2T next time, but there will definitely be a next time!

I used a big scoop for my cookies- cookies without oats usually take about 16 minutes. These cookies took.lser to 20 on 325.

Gosh, I did not have any problem with these cookies flattening. in fact, mine were quite fluffy. I'm attributing this to luck and I used room temperature butter; I didnt cheat for once. I gave this four stars because it's simple and good. I added cinnamon because I enjoy it.

These were so good!! I increased the flour to 1.5 cups total and halved the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I used a ice cream scoop instead of a normal spoon to make them a little bigger and doubled the cooking time. I was going to freeze half but they were all gone in a couple of days. Yumm!!!

This was a fairly easy chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe. I did increase the flour to 1 3/4 cups +1/2 cup at the end, just b4 scooping them on to the cookie sheets. Found it to be too wet. My first batch spread too thin & ended up burnt. No good. Adding the last 1/2 cup made them much better. They are fluffy & super yummy. I also added 2 cups of oats vs 3 cups. That's a personal choice. Will make them again!!!!

I followed recipe but the salt taste is a bit overwhelming. I would suggest 1/2 teaspoon. Also they came out more like a crumble granola then a chewy cookie. Taste good, just would have liked it to stick together more like a cookie. Thank you.

Flat and salty. Seems like the amounts for the baking soda and salt got mixed up. Will try using 1tsp baking soda and 1/2tsp salt next time. I think people should give honest ratings and honest stars. Don’t give above three stars to a recipe that needs major changes!! We busy cooks need to help each other out. Looks like LOTS of people wasted precious time, money, and food on a recipe that was not tried and tested by the author. I’m sure it was an honest mistake on the part of he author, but after SOOOOO MANY reviews saying the SAME THING, you would think the author would edit it? I made the mistake of choosing this recipe based on the 4.5 star rating, without reading any reviews. After disappointing my family with a lousy batch of cookies, I went back and read some reviews. I was SHOCKED to see how many people gave it four stars even though their first batch sucked!! C’mon people!! Watch out for your fellow cookie lovers!! Give it one or two stars and be honest!! Nobody is benefitting from an undeserved four or five star rating on this recipe!! I had to wash a sink full of dishes and I wasted several dollars on the ingredients for this!! No fair.

Like everyone else, added 1/2 c of flour, increased baking soda to 1 tsp, decreased salt to 1/2 tsp. I didn't add walnuts or chocolate chips, 'cause I just didn't have any. I replaced half the butter with unsweetened applesauce. And I added several heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter, as well as a pinch of nutmeg and a good bit of cinnamon.
Put the batter in the fridge for a while. Baked them at 350 for 13 min and then let them sit on the pan for five min before moving to a cooling rack.
These cookies were PRIME. Delicious, moist, chewy, and didn't spread at all.
Although, it's not really the original recipe anymore. At all. But with these variations, the cookies were bomb. :)

I followed the recipe exactly, since I only read the reviews after I had one sheet in the oven already.  Mine turned out really well!  They were chewy and evenly browned.  I did whisk the eggs, one at a time, into the butter really well.  Maybe that helped them not flatten out, as someone suggested.  
Definitely would make again.  Next time I would be tempted to add more oats but I wouldn't want to risk messing it up.  I think little skor bits or chocolate and caramel chips with pecans pieces would be super good!  Then again, that would be a whole other cookie.  Lol.  
Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe for years but my cookies always came out rather flat and not "chewy". Yesterday I read some of the reviews, which I should have done years ago, and finally got my puffy cookies!!! Like so many said, increase the flour, the baking soda and it's helpful to use half butter and half shortening and to chill the dough. I have no idea why I never read the reviews before but I'm sure glad I did yesterday because these cookies turned out perfect!! Oh, and I always bake everything at 350 but today I baked at 325 like the recipe said and maybe that was part of the problem before. Whatever, I'm very happy with this recipe!!

Always a hit in a gathering. I minimize the sugar for the kids and because my husband doesn’t care for sweet things. He can never have enough of these cookies. Tweeking  it to fit your tests buds is key. I don’t add the white sugar and I use dark chocolate chips I also use 3/4 the recommended butter and cook it for 13 mins in the oven it gives the outside oats a nice brown color and it’s just perfect for us.

THis is a special recipe.  As a rule, chocchip cookies are not my favorite but this recipe might change my mind.  This is unfortunate because I usually make Choco chip cookies so I don't eat them.  It's a very balanced cookie, great texture, love the nuttiness and oats really balances out the sweet chocolate. My changes include: 1/2cup chopped pecans, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 cup dark choco chunks, 1/2 cup semisweet, reduced the salt by half because I used salted Kerrygold butter, used all old fashioned oats because that's what I had, chilled the dough at least two hours.  I also weigh all my  dry ingredients.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  Looking forward to making this again.

This was the easiest cookie recipe I have ever worked with and I have been baking for five decades.  It is also the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe.  The only thing I would do differently the next time is make the cookies smaller.   I think I made them bigger than they should be.  I did read some of the reviews about cookies that tasted too salty and cookies that spread out and burned while baking.  I learned a long time ago never to use butter when making cookies, salted or unsalted, because that's what happened to my batch of cookies and all I had was a giant mess of crumbs.  After that I went back to my old standby of Imperial margarine.  In all of these years I have never had a recipe go wrong when I used Imperial.  With regards to the salt, I just checked the package and it says that 1 tbsp has only 105mg of sodium.  I followed this recipe exactly and used the full amount of salt and my cookies do not taste salty.  Also, it is interesting that in the recipe for chocolate chip cookies on the back of the Imperial box, there is no salt listed.

My boyfriend said these are the best cookies he has ever had! I loved them too! I did add 1/3 cup extra flour, half the salt because I used salted butter, and I used Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips with extra 1/2 cup dark chocolate melting wafers. Definitely don't over mix so they aren't flat! I also had to cook 3 extras minutes because I made them pretty big  but they were perfect! Also use parchment paper underneath instead of aluminum foil whenever possible because of aluminum link to alzheimer's and dementia.

Made it with an extra cup of chocolate chips instead of nuts, and the chips I used were mini.  Everyone raved over them and no one was able to eat just 1 or 2, they  couldn't keep their hands off.  I'll definitely be making these again.

This is one of the best oatmeal cookie recipes I have tried. I didn’t have walnuts so I increased the chocolate chips. I also had one stick of butter left from baking all morning so I used shortening for the difference. Put in fridge for a half hour prior to baking and in between batches baking. Baking temp and time a little different because of my oven but other than that, Perfection !!

I made as is except I added 1 tsp cinnamon and omitted the nuts so i can put them in my son'd daycare lunch box. They do cook flat and at first, i thought they didn't look like most cookies do when the timer went off so i cooked them for a further 2 mins. They still looked a little under done but i took them out anyway as the edges were browning and left to cool for 15 mins before i thought they were solidified enough as they are very soft and chewy.  The end result is a nice chewy consistency and good flavor. I dropped 1 tbsp full scoops and got about 48 cookies. I gave this recipe 4 stars because it does need a few adjustments to make it better. Easy to make too!

These are great! My husband and I recently started to eat for our blood type, (A and O) which is very restrictive with lectins and macro food groups ... this recipe was easily modified - rice flour for reg flour and almond butter in lieu of reg butter, with a few tablespoons of apple juice for moisture.  That also makes it gluten-free!  Delicious and healthy. 
If there’s anyone else out there following the blood type eating plan, I’d love to have a whole section for it!

We made this using extra baking soda and less salt, as others have recommended. The flavor and texture are very very good! We found, though, that they needed a whole extra cup of flour for the cookies to hold their shape.  It also helped to chill the dough before baking. If you make these, and add extra flour until the dough can hold a ball shape.

Delicious cookies! I read the concerns about spreading, so I put my cookie sheets into the freezer when I took the butter out to let it come to room temperature. I also chilled the batter for a half hour before scooping onto parchment paper. My cookies are chewy & delicious and did not over spread.

My family enjoyed but I didn’t think they had much flavor. Texture-wise, I think they turned out ok. 

We live at high altitude (7,000ft) so I added 2Tbsp of flour, upped the temp 5*, and cooked an extra 3 min for a total cook time of 15 min. 

My hand up was really not enough taste. Maybe I’ll try to add some cinn or other spices next time and give it another go. Perhaps dark brown sugar for more molasses taste...

Very good cookie. I needed to add 1/2 C flour and 1/2 t baking soda. I also added 1 t pumpkin  pie spice for flavor. I omitted the nuts as we have allergies in the house. Turned out soft and yummy.

I baked this bath in two cycles.
• I baked ½ the dough following  the instructions exactly as written. The  cookies spread massively because the dough wasn't cold. They also took 15-16 minutes to bake because of the lower temp.
• I refrigerated the dough, and baked the remaining ½ the next day. I raised the temp to 350°. They baked for 11 minutes and were perfect. Family loved them. The recipe is a keeper!

I am one to only tell the truth, and I just want to share with you my experience. 
When I was making this, I was watching the video at the same time. I used the same ingredients as instructed, and the entire time,  my recipe did not look as thick as the one on the video. I do not believe their recipe on the video was the same as the one we were making because mine wasn't as thick. I have  had a hard time with cookies, and this one looked super simple and nice, but it didn't turn out how I expected. 

They didn't taste that sweet, almost salty even. They were too fluffy, as well as flat. I am not over exaggerating or trying to be negative, I want to know why out cookies don't turn out just like yours? Do you purposely give us a bad recipe?

OK, so made these cookies with all of the recommended adjustments, including the pre-cooking chill strategy.  Just gave a few to the mattress delivery guys and they actually came back to knock on the door to tell me that "they are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had .... and I'm an oatmeal cookie guy!".  I guess they're a keeper :)

I made these according to the recipe (except one slight modification - I used regular oats and pulsed them in a food processor because I didn’t have small quick oats) and I have to say these are quite delicious!

Family loved them, were all gone the next day. Only gave 4 stars cause I didnt follow recipe exactly. Used 1/4 cup less flour, doubled the baking soda and substituted coconut for the nuts. 
That made it 5 stars, sister said best cookie she ever had.  Definitely will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies are perfect! Making them for the second time in 4 days right now! They are definitely not flat for me. I used a regular cheap dark cookie sheet and a scoop to make my cookies and the butter was slightly cooler than room temperature as I saw lots of reviews saying they were a little flat and I have had no issues. My husband devoured a half dozen in less than 5 minutes after arriving home from work and my kids who hate nuts did not notice the walnuts!

I have been making this recipe for years. Overtime I have changed it a bit. I substituted the walnuts for a cup of peanut butter that I mix in before the flour mixture. I also prefer using a 1/2 c of regular choco chips and a 1/2 c mini choco chips.

Mine took almost 14 minutes, but turned out perfect.
I omitted the walnuts and substituted unsweetened coconut. I also did half semi-sweet/ half milk chocolate chips.
Will definitely be my go-to cookies!

These was a great recipe. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers including adding 1/2 cup extra of flour and using whole 1 tsp of baking soda and cut the salt to a little less that 1/2 tsp. I personally added 1tsp of expresso powder and 1 tsp of cinnamon. I used a combo of chocolate chips and 60% dark chocolate bar that I chopped in to pieces that I happen have left over of from a precious cookie recipe. I did not chill and i just spoon dropped on the cookie sheet. Baked at 325F for about 12 min. They turned out pretty good and never went flat. Not too sweet. Thanks to the other reviewers for the suggestions.

This is a really good recipe, my only edit was to add more chocolate chips (but then, we really like chocolate chips!). They were a little salty so next time I will read the reviews and reduce the amount of salt.

Crispy on edges and soft, gooey in the middle.  Must be watched closely or they'll over bake.    12 minutes in a preheated oven was best!

DON'T ADD THE EXTRA FLOUR.  I'm always happy to take a helpful tip, but I must say that this recipe with 1/2 cup of extra flour and extra baking soda is too dry and thick and the cookies come out more like cake.  Just make the recipe as it is.

Yes, I plan on making it again. I only had steel cut oats on hand and they added great structure and thickness to the cookie. I used 2 cups of steel cut rather than the 3 cup recommendation for quick oats. Perhaps switching the oats will help everyone with the flat cookie dilemma. Also I too increased the flour to 1 3/4 cup and baking soda to  1 tsp.

Unlike most of the reviewers, I didn't change the amount of flour in the mix (though I did initially change the amount of salt). I subbed mini M&Ms for walnuts and mixed in both mini and regular semi sweet chocolate chips. The first batch I made burned on the bottom and tasted quite flat. I added cinnamon and coffee grounds (to taste) and refrigerated my dough for 2 hours before baking the next round. They came out PERFECT!! The coffee and cinnamon adds depth to the cookies (and there are a LOT of oats that need flavor boosting in this recipe). I would totally make it again keeping with the cinnamon and coffee (and maybe some nutmeg next time!)

this recipie calls for way too much salt and not a high enough bake temperature resulting in cookies that melt into puddles, come out raw then burn on the outside. tasty, if you're using this recipie, lower the salt to 1/2 tsp and make the baking temp 350.

A previous reviewer is right: the suggested modifications make it the Quaker recipe, though the Quaker recipe is cooked at a higher, shorter temperature. I prefer this cooking temperature and did make the flour, salt, baking soda changes previously suggested.

I made these cookies as directed and we loved them! They were crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside - just the way I like it! I especially liked the walnuts in them.

I just made these wonderful cookies. Very tasty and filling. I only used  1/2 teaspoon salt because I only have sea salt. I used butterscotch chips because thats also what i had on hand. Again they were very good. This recipe made me 47- 3" cookies. They were flat but I like them that way.

Followed the recipe with the following exceptions, added 1 tsp nutmeg powder, 1 tsp cinnamon powder, used organic dark brown sugar instead of light brown, substituted walnuts with pecans and chilled the dough for 30 mins before scooping. Used a 1.5 tbsp scoop to make 54 cookies. Mine cooked for 18 mins but remained nice and round and not flat at all. Took it out when it was slightly hard on top. The result was a slightly crispy outer layer with a moist and chewy center. Absolute perfection! Half the cookies were gone in 20 mins and had to hide the rest away from kids and husband. Thank you so much for this recipe, definitely making this many more times.

I combined this recipe with the baked caramel-apple frenchtoast recipe. Adding a few ingredients, omitting some and reducing others. I used less than half the amount of cream cheese, added sliced apples and pairs to cover the top, mixed chopped up ones, along with chopped pecans and whole raisins that I microwaved with water before hand so they would be juicy and plump. This recipe is easy and fun to adjust to your own liking.

I made the first batch without reading other reviewers suggestions so they came out a bit flat and waaay too soft! I quickly added an extra 1/4 c of flour and 1/2 c of quick oats to the remaining dough, baked at 345 for 11 mins, leaving them to rest on the hot cookie sheet for 5 minutes after baking. These adjustments resulted in firm, chewy, perfectly baked cookies. I will definitely reduce the salt by 1/2 next time as I found it to be a bit much. I also omitted the nuts and stuck to chocolate chips only. This one is going in my recipe box!

I wasn’t in love with them - I think they could use more flour and fewer/less oats  and a little less salt. They’re edible though.

Would totally make it again BUT I increased the flour by 1/2 cup, baking soda by 1/2 tbsp, and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. Also I added way more chocolate chips! This is a big batch so 1 cup isn't enough.

Hmm I did not see the reviews beforehand and I made this on a whim. 1 TEASPOON of salt has always been too much for cookie batter, so I opted to do a few pinches. I'm glad I did. I wasn't sure about 2 whole cups of oats, so I only did 3. My batter was not runny. The butter was softened, not melted down, so I'm not sure why others were so wet. My cookies are VERY light and after cooling fall apart easily, but I'm not complaining. I did not want mine very thick. I also used a single cup of unsweetened apple sauce to replace the eggs and slightly less white sugar (the applesauce is sweet tasting so not as much sugar is needed). I did not increase my flour. 

If your batter is runny, don't over mix. But also, freezing for 5-10 minutes beforehand thickens the batter. If you freeze overnight, it needs to thaw but if you freeze for a few minutes it's good to go in the oven right away. I like to make a single batch and save the batter in the freezer for another time. 

Overall, I think everyone modifies cookie recipes to their own liking naturally. Some people want their's healthier, sweeter, thicker, thinner, etc. The reviews didn't lead me to modify. I just do that on my own :)  I think it's a great recipe to experiment with to make your own. I will probably do future modifications for fun, not because the recipe is bad. Quite the contrary. These cookies are YUMMY.

I’ve made these cookies many times.  They are a favourite in our house.  I like the salt amount a bit of a sweet and salty flavour!  Yum!

Great oatmeal cookies! They taste very grainy and wholesome. I did not put the whole 1/2 cup of white sugar in. I don't like my cookies too sweet. I think the chocolate chips make up for that cup of sugar.

These cookies were a hit at home and at the office - sweet, chewy deliciousness.  I did change it a bit by decreasing the salt to just a pinch, but only because I did not have the baking soda.  I only had baking powder, so I doubled the baking powder and decreased the salt to just a pinch.  Also, I did not have walnuts so I used chopped pecans.  These were wonderful - especially warm. I will definitely make these again.

Really great. But not exactly nutritious. Rather than putting 1 1/4 cup of all purpose flour I used 1/2 cup of all purpose flour and 1 cup of wheat bran. I also only used 1/4 cup of white sugar rather than 1/2 cup. Cookies came out super moist and delicious. Would definitely recommend.

I made this recipe with the plan of baking the whole batch but I ran out of time.  I put the dough in the refrigerator for a couple of hours and then baked them when I got home.  They were fantastic and my family loved them!  The only change I would make is one of personal taste; I would decrease the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.   Very good and very adaptable recipe!

I increased the flour, added in raisins, decreased the chocolate chips, and decreased the sugar. Turned into excellent, traditional oatmeal cookies. I'll make them again.

Everyone else seemed to like these cookies alright, but I thought they were incredibly bland. They were also very flat. I kept the dough in the fridge while the first batch was baking, and increased the temperature to 350 on the second batch, and the texture was better and they were not as flat. But overall they did not turn out very good.

This was a great base cookie recipe! We are a GF house so I'm always looking for good basic recipes to convert. 

Just in case anyone else is looking for a tasty GF cookie recipe I will share my conversion notes below.

Notes:
Sub 1 1/4 flour for 1 1/4 fine almond flour. 
Add in  2 TBS flax meal to help it hold together. 
Use and additional 1/2 tsp baking soda for lift.
Scoop a scant TBS per cookie and this will help with spreading and consistency.
Bake for 15-17 min as almond flour has more moisture.

Coincidentally, I was out of chocolate chips so I used raisons and added a pinch of cinnamon.  Next time I will try to use a bit less sugar as they were a touch too sweet fo my taste.

These are a big hit! I made them for friends and again for a bake sale. I did not add any walnuts and increased the chocolate chips by about a 1/2 cup. I am going to try to make a low sugar batch with splenda for my Dad later.

I had no issues with my cookies spreading to much. Softened the butter(don’t melt it!). I used salted butter, reduced standard salt by 1/2 tsp. If you like a lot of chocolate then use the whole cup. If not, reduce by 1/2 c. If you do like the lots of chocolate, halfway through the cooking, add a light sprinkle of rock sea salt. Yum!

Great cookies.  The batch was big enough I managed to freeze about 2 dozen cookie dough balls for later use.  I cannot stop eating them.

I used half a cup of honey rather than white sugar just for kicks and a table spoon of cinnamon. Mine tured out a little too cooked for my liking. I would cook them a bit longer unless you like crispy cookies

This cookie came out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They came out nice and chewy.  I had to double check the baking soda because many recipes call for powder.  Delicious and I will definitely make again!

My daughter asked to make cookies and she chose this recipe. Usually I double check the reviews but today I didn't, that was a mistake. She made this recipe as written but used gluten free flour. The recipe as written does not turn out. At 325 for 12 minutes, we had raw cookies. I bumped up the temp to 350 and at 12 minutes pulled the next batches. I did not want to over bake (the first batch was baked longer and was crispy on the edges). The later batches just fell apart after cooling. I need to try this cookie again with the alterations that are in the reviews, as written I would never make again.

These cookies are the best I have made in a while.  After reading the reviews, I decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp; and I added 1/2 cup coconut (left over from Christmas baking).   I chilled the dough before baking.  Excellent.

This is an excellent recipe. Instructions are spot on, and the results are bakery level. Chewy on the inside and crispy around the edges.  Put this one in your "go to " recipe book.

These were great.  I used Pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I had and they worked fine.  Best chocolate chip cookies I ever had.  And they feel heathy.

Made exactly ONE change to this recipe, I left out the chips because I didn't have any...and these were really underwhelming for such a highly rated recipe. 
They came out of my oven very flat and meh tasting. They weren't so bad that I tossed them, but I won't make them again

Life long baker and cookie maker here, adding my first note because these came out as the BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever made or tasted. I really wanted to share!I took the advice of some earlier reviews as well as making my own adjustments: -increased flour by ½ cup -increased baking soda by ½ tsp -reduced salt to ½ tsp -removed the walnuts and chocolate chips -added 2/3 cup dried blueberries.   -added 2 bars (1.45oz each) of dark chocolate, hand chopped into chip-size chunks -covered dough and chilled in refrigerator overnight -rolled into ¾ to 1 inch size balls; kept dough balls in refrigerator until ready to bake and between batches -baked 15-18 minutes at 325. Yoda would say: “My new favorite cookies, these are!”

Use a total of 3 1/2 cups of oats, and increase the baking soda to 1 teaspoon.   Decrease salt to half a teaspoon.  This makes perfect cookie.  I chill the dough for at least 30 minutes to an hour. This helps prevent the cookie from spreading.

Easy and great tasting oatmeal cookie recipe. One recommendation I have is to cut the salt measurement by half. Otherwise, as stated - chewy cookie, great texture, good taste.

I read a number of the most recent reviews and followed their advice.  I increased flour (1 1/2+ cups), decreased salt to 1/4 tsp, increased baking soda to 1 tsp.  I also creamed the initial ingredients for about 5 minutes and then did not over stir flour mixture. I used dark choc chips, walnuts and added craisins.  I experimented with chilling dough vs. not - found no difference.  Lastly, I cooked at 375 for about 10 min.  Crispy on outside, chewy inside.  Yielded 5 WOWs and 3 Holy Cows from my husband - so I'm keeping this recipe!!

Used 2/3 whole wheat flour. Had to substitute 3x baking powder because we didn't have any baking soda. Added a bit more oats, no walnuts, extra chocolate chips (dark chocolate). Turned out pretty good. Took an extra minute or two in the oven.

I followed the recipe but they have to bake on the bottom rack in order for them not to flatten out. Nice and chewy though and great flavor.

SO SALTY!! I made this because the overall rating was so high, but couldn't believe how awful they tasted! I then looked at the reviews and realized that almost everyone who had given 4 or 5 stars changed the ratios of flour, baking soda and salt, and even sometimes butter. I'm not sure why they thought this receipe deserved 5 stars when they had to make so many changes, it was very misleading! Won't make this again, that's for sure!

I added 1/2 cup flour and halved the salt! I also creamed the butter and sugar for 5 minutes and had no problems with sinking! They were great! I baked at 325 convection for 11 minutes!

This recipe is heaven on earth. I used 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and a teaspoon of baking soda. I also put around 1-2 tablespoons of milk in when I was creaming, which really helps with the chewiness. They did come out a little flat, but that's not a huge deal for me. They are so yummy!

Someone in my office made these and they were delicious! 
My attempt was NOT successful at all!! I followed the instructions down to the bone! the batter was delicious but the final product not so much. 
My cookies flattened out like pancakes (too much butter causes this). 
Once cooled they were rock solid!
And my chocolate chips didn't melt at all. 

I would try again with less butter & chocolate chips.
And definitely will chill  my batter before it bakes.

I can never seem to get this recipe to stay thick, but people rave about the flavor. I trade the walnuts for cranberries. Even though they flatten out, they stay chewy and soft.

I also used the recommendations for 1 3/4 c. flour, 1 tsp. b. spda, 1/2 tsp. salt & baked them at 350 deg for 12 minutes. I also chilled the dough for about 30 minutes. They were fantastic. Will definitely make again.

I needed to adjust my review,as it was posted prematurely.  This year I experimented....I used 3/4c butter and 1/4c crisco, I added an extra1/2 c flour, I used 1 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp salt.  I also used 2c quick oats and 1c old fashioned oats.  I use a small ice cream scoop to shape cookies, it’s about 2 tbsp per cookie.  Bake at 335 for 15 to 16 min.

Love this recipe. Even my son who is fussy loved it. I used this recipe and turned it into a gluten free cookies. My daughter can’t have wheat, and  my friends. So used gluten free flour and gluten free rolled oats. You may need to add 1/2 cup more flour, but try and see how moist the dough is first before you add this in. Also I chilled this dough for an hour ( I did it overnight) so that the oatmeal soaks up some of the excess moisture. Check your dough to feel the texture. If you have high humidity it will have an affect on your baking.

made it the way the recipe is the first time. Some found them too sweet. The second batch I made with ~1/2 cup less sugar (split between white and brown sugar) and added about 3/4 cup of cranberries to add a different taste.
Really like them either way, personally! They were less chewy the second time.

These are great cookies. My family loves them. I accidentally doubled the amount of vanilla the recipe calls for but it I think we like them better this way.

I tried other people's recommendations and used 1 3/4 cups flour, 1.5 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce, refrigerated the batter for an hour, shaped the cookie dough into disks and baked at 325 for 16 minutes instead of 12. Perfect!! I will definitely make again!!

I just finished making these cookies and they turned out perfect.  I don't know what I did special, but my cookies turned out thick and chewy.  The only thing that I did differently was I left them in the oven for quite a bit longer than the recipe states. I think that just depends on your oven and how it heats things.  Was super easy and they look great.

Follow the recipe, they turn out perfect! Make sure to not bake them too long. I personally leave salt out of my baking since I use salted butter (that's enough for me). And I reduced the vanilla the second time I made them by about 1/4 tsp. 
This recipe doubles easily. Had to keep these in the freezer so my family didn't devour them in one sitting!!

Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! 

I would give this recipe 6 stars out of 5. It was beyond delicious and I really really mean that. I was in the middle of baking it and realized we were fresh out of chocolate chips so I put walnuts in it (I crushed them to smithereens just because I typically don't eat walnuts...like ever...so I wanted to hardly taste them). :)
I am baking them again today and in fact will be taking them to surprise a family from church (I first made it a little over 2 weeks ago). These are celestial cookies!

I will definitely make this recipe again!  I made it exactly as the directions indicate. I don't know why some reviewers had complaints - they turned out great.  Not too flat, not to salty, as some others said.  I took them to a church function and had a few requests for the recipe!    Next time, I will add more chocolate chips since we like a lot.  And I may try replacing some of the white sugar with more brown sugar to make them even chewier.

We followed this recipe in a free association baking style - more the spirit than the letter. They turned out great. Chewy. Chocolatey. Did not flatten dramatically, but we live in a very humid environ which may be a factor.

I'd give a 5 for flavor.
I found they were under cooked and too flat.
I put the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes, made the drops smaller and increased my baking time to 15 minutes.
and this time I halved the walnuts and added raisins.
they eventually turned out after a few tweaks.

So I followed the recipe exactly, it was my first time baking these and I really wanted to see how they got before making changes. I really liked them but I will be tweaking the recipe a little. 

In Mexico we don't have brown sugar so I used muscovado sugar (the msugar I have wasn't the right consistency so when creaming butter with sugar the granules were still pretty present - I will purchase a different msugar that has a closer consistency to the traditional light brown sugar and see if I can get more fluff). 

My honest opinion...delicious cookies with the base recipe however I think I'm going to reduce the sugar a little (these got sooo sweet and I used the recipe amount of salt and salted butter LOL). 

Will be trying again soon.

I made these cookies in a time crunch and they were delicious! I added dark chocolate chips and put parchment paper onto the baking sheet as I find that helps evenly cook the cookies. They were amazing and so quick and simple. I kept them in there for 12 min exactly using bake (not fan forced bake) and it was the perfect time.

Very good cookies overall. They were tasty and chewy and lived up to my expectations. I added an additiolal 1/4c of flour and and doubled the amount of baking soda. I then decreased the amout of salt by 1/2tsp. I added an additional 1 1/2tsp of cinnamon as well as raisins instead of the suggested toppings. Although they tasted really good, they were way too sweet (the same day). However, the next day, the sweetness kind of reduced (might as well depend on the temperature of the cookies).  I'd also like to add that they didn't turn out to be anywhere near flat as many said, I smashed the dough balls down before putting them in the oven by the way.
Excellent recipe!

DELICIOUS! Not sure what others were doing that caused theirs to fall flat but these turned out perfect. I did use parchment paper on the cookie sheet and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. I did use rolled oats as that's what we have in the house and  threw in some golden raisins just because I like raisins in my oatmeal cookies.

I used shortening instead of butter (as I do in all of my cookies).  After the first pan I increased the temperature to 350 degrees. Good cookie, nice texture.  This recipe will be added to my cookie rotation.  Thank you for another good cookie recipe.

Added the recommended extra 1/2c flour & 1/2t baking soda - Refrigerated the dough for an hour so they didn't flatten out soo much.  Taste really good!

New go-to recipe!  About 100x better than standard chocolate chip cookies. Here are my changes based on comments:
1. Increase the flour by 1/2c.
2. Half the salt
3. Half the vanilla
4. Mix-ins: I split the dough in half before the mix-ins and then did 1 cup of cranberries in half and then 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips in the other half. I didn't have nuts but almonds with the cranberries and a little orange zest would be amazing pretty sure.
12min at 350, cooling on the pan is what worked best for me. They were even better after the dough chilled for ~24h.

I made these today, great cookies! Used unsalted butter, room temp., a extra half cup of flour, extra 1/2 tsp of baking soda, Quaker quick cook steel cut oats, and 1 1/4 C total of bitter sweet chocolate, semi sweet and milk chocolate chips, 1 tsp cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg, plus the walnuts, and other ingredients as directed. Baked 335 for 12 mins, let set on baking sheet for five mins, then removed to wire rack. Next time would use slightly less salt. Excellent flavor, consistency. Would make again!

I made 1 simple change to the recipe that took it from a very good recipe to an amazing recipe! Instead of just 1 cup of walnuts I added about 4 cups, and these turned out to be some of the best cookies I've ever had. I received numerous pleas from everyone to make many more batches. 

I made the cookies rather large, so I did have to alter the cooking temperature and time a bit to somewhere around 300-325 degrees. I got about 9 cookies out of the entire recipe. Also, for forming the cookies I treated them basically like a hamburger patty. I pinched off a large ball of dough; flattened it into a patty; and then used the inside of my thumb and forefinger around the outer edge to even it out.

Lastly, I just wanted to mention that the few people who had difficulty with this recipe... I'm sorry, but they just can't cook. The recipe is fine, and the cookies are delicious.

This recipe is SOOOO good! Skipped the chocolate chips because I didn't have any at hand, and lowered the sugar to 1 cup of just brown sugar. My husband loved these and wanted to have them every day, and my kids...well they keep asking for more. I got 28 chewy perfect delicious cookies that only lasted 2 days! Can't wait to make more!

only additions I made were 1/2 cup more of flour and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Grand kids were insatiable. morning (pre-breakfast), morning snack, afternoon snack and dessert. Salt made it superlative. Negative reviewer must realize that for even cities 50 miles away have different results because of elevation and suppliers. Have to adjust ingredients with every move.

Tasty good, but visually unappealing. I read a few of the reviews and suggestions, but they turned out really flat and downright ugly. Luckily my toddler doesn't care if they're pretty as long as they're tasty.

The taste of these cookies is awesome and they do not contain extravagant amounts of sugar.
I followed the recipe exactly, except I used spelt flour instead of white flour, which really does not make a big difference.
My cookies were not flat at all, as other reviewers had complained.
I think the trick is in the MAKING, not the INGREDIENTS.
You should thoroughly whisk the wet ingredients for a good amount of time, until they become fluffy. Make sure you give it a good whisk between each egg.
When you add the last part (oats, choc chips, etc) CHURN them in lightly until just mixed well enough, don't overdo it.

Ohhh my god. Perfect recipe as is! I wouldn't change a thing. They were chewy and delicious. I let mine sit on the baking sheet 2-3 minutes after cooking before moving to another piece of parchment on the table and that was PERFECT.

Delicious and loved by all in our family.  I would prefer a bit more healthy options though.  We did use whole wheat flour with no adverse effects and next time will try swapping other ingredients to see if they also work well...

Turned out amazing! I did half with chocolate chips and half with golden raisins and both were delicious. I used an additional 1/2 C Oats and about 1/3 Tsp more baking soda, I also halved the salt (I used salted butter). I refrigerated the batter a couple hours before baking and they are perfect!

I don't like my cookies too sweet so I omitted the white sugar. Also I forgot to thaw the butter so I cut it into small pieces and blended with the sugar. The chemistry is a little different with soft butter. But the cookies didn't turn out chewy but just nice and hard! It was just as delicious!

The cookies taste great but there is too much butter and too little flour. The first time I tried this recipe the cookies melted flat because of the butter so I added another 1/3 cup of flour or so and that prevented them from melting.

Delicious! Chewy and moist, buttery and sweet. I modified the original recipe by halving the salt, cutting the sugar to 1/3 and adding an extra cup flour and extra half teaspoon of baking soda. Plus some extra choc chips. Turned out perfect and enough for easily 35 larger cookies.

As advised, I increased the flour. I would also  decrease the salt as well. Additionally, I would bake these slightly underdone next time as they continue to bake for several minutes once out of oven. A great, dependable  cookie recipe. I took the cookies camping and most were gone.

Best recipe ever! i have made these multiple times and they always come out delicious. i found that using a silicone baking mat helped not making the bottom of the cookie too crispy, but  instead caramelized the sugar giving it a chewy texture.

Great cookie. Sadly, my cookies turned out af bit flat and they tasted a bit plain because I substituted the chocolate with white chocolate. I'm sure the cookies would have been absolutely amazing if only I had followed the recipe precisely.

These cookies were terrible. I had the butter already softened for fear of overmixing the batter. These cookies were runny, wouldn't firm up and were gummy. I even checked in case I didn't put enough flour in the batch! There is a Betty Crocker recipe that I prefer, those always come out soft and delicious.

I made a double batch and used 1 Cup butter and 1 cup shortening.  I didn't change anything else, but I did chill the dough for about an hour and had no problem with spreading.

Loved it.  Based on reviews, I added 1/2-1/4 cup more flour, increased baking soda by another .5 tbsp.  I used almond milk, and large chocolate chips.  Size doesn't matter: I made goblin-sized cookies and also kid-sized ones, I hand pressed my last 5 that went into the oven.  All the cookies turned out.  I had them in for about 5-6 min. longer than recommended.  
Amount was enough for at least 24 standard sized cookies, I think.  I had so many cookies, I shared some with two neighbour-friends.  Quite proud of the professional cookie maker -like results.  Yes, I'd buy these in a store.  They were that good.  I'd like to make them again, soon?!!

I did not love the recipe the first time I made it. These cookies are overdone when cooked this long in my experience. I prefer two small tweaks: omit the chocolate chips and add extra walnuts, and cook for only 8-10 minutes.

Really great! But I made a few adjustments because I was rotating two pans. Bake for 18 minutes at 335 on parchment paper. I also used a small ice-cream scoop  for shape. 

		1 cup butter, softened -
		1 cup packed light brown sugar -
		1/2 cup white sugar -
		2 eggs - 
		2 teaspoons vanilla extract -
		1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour -
		1 teaspoon baking soda -
		1/2 teaspoon salt -		
		3 cups quick-cooking oats -
		1 cup semisweet chocolate chips -

A good cookie. As suggested by other reviewers, I increased the oats and flour by half cup and the baking soda by half teaspoon. Instead of butter, I used butter Crisco. Since I didn't have a full cup of walnuts, I included a half cup of pecans.  I baked them at 335 for 12 minutes. With oatmeal, I have a hard time keeping the dough together, a drawback for me. They're not a total replacement for a typical chocolate chip cookie.

A really delicious and chewy cookie! I consider myself a good baker and I will definitely make this recipe again. I did as other bakers suggested and increased flour to 1-1/2 cups, increased baking soda to 1 tsp. and decreased salt to 1/2 tsp. I also increased temp. to 335 for 14 minutes.

Is this even an accurate review if I changed up some elements? Either way, this is a good recipe, but I think there is too much salt. I already added it before reading the other reviews, but I would recommend reducing the salt level by half, as other reviewers have mentioned. I also added 1/4 cup more flour and doubled the baking soda. I was worried there was too much oatmeal, but it was the perfect amount! Other than the slightly salty aftertaste, this cookie was great. Next time, I might try reducing the sugar and substituting the butter for applesauce, but this is definitely a recipe I'd use again.

When I first decided to make this recipe I found out that I didn't have enough plain chocolate chips. Luckily I had both butterscotch and white chocolate chips. So, I put all the types of chocolate chips together into the batter and the cookies taste amazing. Science then I always make these cookies with chocolate, white chocolate and butterscotch chips.

Will make again.  I followed the recipe with one exception, I used old fashioned rolled oats.  That's what I eat, so that's what I had.  The first  dozen baked were flat and a little lacey, the second was a little better, but then, the next  cookies baked were thicker and looked like the picture.  The next time I make these, I will allow the dough to rest.  I think the quick oats allow for quick hydration, but the old fashioned needs a hour to completely hydrate. So essentially my first few sheets pans of cookies were too wet.

Great recipe! I substituted caramel flavoring for vanilla and used 1 cup fewer oats (because they weren't the quick cook kind) and they turned out wonderfully. I also drizzled with milk and white chocolate for decoration (and additional chocolate content). I'm calling it "black tie affair."

Great recipe!! Soft and chewy! Not a fan of walnuts in cookies, so I left them out, but added a cup of coconut! SO GOOD!!
Also, I used milk chocolate instead of semi sweet.

These are delicious. Having made oatmeal cookies before, I found chilling them for 20 min before baking prevented the flat cookie.  I did not put in any nuts,  so my kids could take them to school. Otherwise I followed the recipe and we love them. Thanks for sharing.

I make these all the time and I always get people freaking out about how good they are. I almost know the recipe by heart now! I follow it exactly but I never put the walnuts in. If you don't have brown sugar, you can use all white sugar and add 1 rounded TBSP of molasses. This is THE BEST RECIPE. I would never try another oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe because these are pure perfection! Try are good warm, cold from the fridge, and they freeze well!

Loved it... I did what some other commenters did.. replaced half the butter with applesauce... then I also lessened the sugar a bit, around 20% less... the cookies didn't flatten at all, in fact they remained the same shape they were in when I scooped them in heaping spoonfuls onto the tray.

The only change I made was instead of butter, I used lard that I rendered myself.  The flavor is a bit different, but I enjoy it. 

Regarding the cookies spreading out too thin, I did not have that problem. Mine puffed up a bit too much, so I just flattened them a bit with the spatula when they came out of the oven, then let them sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes, as the recipe states. To keep cookies from spreading too thin, I reserve 1/4 to 1/2 of the flour, and add that as the very last ingredient, working it in with my hands. Another mistake I've made regarding this is I have reflexively greased the cookie sheet, without noticing the recipe said UNgreased.

Some of my favorite cookies! Gathered from other popular comments: Cream butter and sugar until very light and fluffy 4 or 5 mins.  Increase the flour to 1 3/4 cup and baking soda to 1 teaspoon.  I left out the walnuts. Set the oven to 335 and bake for 12 minutes. Use the middle cookie scoop.

I absolutely LOVED the cookies, and the little bit of walnuts in it added a yummy taste to the oatmeal and chocolate chips. It was hard to eat just one cookie after my mom finished making these yummy cookies!!!

As other reviewers suggested, I increased the flour and baking soda.  I halved the recipe, so I used 1/2 tsp baking soda and 3/4 cups flour.  I removed the cookies from the oven at the 11 minute mark and they were a perfect golden brown and perfectly chewy.

Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are my favorite type of cookie, and I've tried several recipes, but none have turned out very well.  These cookies were perfect.  I finally found my go-to oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe!

I liked it - did add another 1/4 cup of flour as recommended. Mixed 2 cups of quick oats with 1 cup of whole oats because I lake the texture mix up. Also a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as I like the flavor it adds. Would make again.

I followed the advice of others, increasing the flour to 1 3/4 C, the baking soda to 1 teaspoon and decreasing the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I refrigerated the batter in between baking the batches. This cookie came out beautiful. I'm a big fan of brown sugar but recognize the balance given by adding the white. Chewy, crunchy and perfectly balanced. Not too sweet at all.  Five star all the way once I made the changes but in all fairness I did not try make them according the the original recipe.

I've baked two batches of chocolate-chip cookies a while ago. It was delicious! I have made baking or no-baking required cookies previously. This was definitely the best of them. No more buying chocolate-chip cookies from stores for me. As I often do, I have customized this recipe, too. I used 1 and 1/2 cups of generic brand of old fashioned oats flour which I made in my Vitamix in 30 seconds instead of using all purpose flour. I have used a tbsp of ground flaxseeds and a tsp of nutritional yeast, and a cup of oats with 1/2 cup of ON Whey Protein powder to have less guilt. I work out regularly and I do crave for sugar from time to time particularly when I am having a cup of coffee or tea. Also, I swapped white sugar with 9 packets of sweet n'low (1/2 cup of white sugar is equal to 12 packets of SnL) though I intentionally used less since I find chocolate-chip cookies sold in stores too sweet. I have also used 1 tsp of almond extract and about 2 ounces of 72% dark chocolate (I used a mortal&pestle after I crushed it by hand) since I did not have chocolate chips or vanilla extract at home at the time. Based on my previous experience, I think I will continue using dark chocolate instead of chocolate chips. The result is much better. I kept it 15 minutes in the oven. Both batches of 19 pieces of large cookies came out great, a little soft, chewy but crispy -crunchy and not flat. Though, I'd like to say that I'll reduce the amount of salt next time by a qtr of a teaspoon at least.

These are great cookies, the best I made. I followed the helpful previous advices and changed for a bit HEALTHIER version. So the overall changes are:
Flour: replaced with whole wheat and used 1.5 cup
1 tea spon baking soda
1/2 tea spoon salt
Sugar: used only 1 cup packed dark brown sugar, omitted the 1/2 cup white 
Added cinamon
Froze the dough 10 minutes beforw baking
Baked 12 minutes at 335 and let it cool on the baking pan

The result is very tasty,  chewy and mildly sweet cookis that my family LOVED

Thank you for a great recipe!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it worked perfectly fine. I listened to what some people said about over mixing and it worked! I made it once before and they came out really flat so I was discouraged but this time it turned out way better!

Excellent tasting and super soft and chewy. I like salty stuff so the salt is fine for me because I added a lot of chocolate chips. But make sure to grease your pan despite it saying untreated or else your cookies will get stuck! Super delicious and definitely will make again!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! It is the first oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe that stays soft for hours. Hooray! I did as recommended by previous bakers, increasing flour by 1/2 cup, increasing baking soda by 1/2 tablespoon, and decreasing salt by 1/2 teaspoon. Made a big difference. This is the second time I have made this recipe, and I'm sure I will do so again! Especially since my husband told me for the first time, "Wow, these cookies are good! And so soft!" :)

So I have to admit I modified this somewhat by doing 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 raisins.  I also had to leave out the walnuts.  But these are chewy and really tasty.

These were great. I added an additional 1/2c flour and 1/2 tsp baking sofa as suggested by other reviewers. I also stuck it in the fridge after mixing for about 40 minutes. They did not spread for me. Love the fridge trick. Thank you for sharing!

My kids and husband loves these cookies and they are a family favorite.  I also put them in the freezer for 15 mins, to help them form better and scoop the dough out with an ice cream scoop, so it's all the same size.  I promise you will love this recipe and so will your family.

I love this recipe, but would love to add raisins to it. Just not sure if I can just add them, or I need to modify other ingredients to add the raisins. Any idea?

Best cookies I've ever had! Had to make a double batch again as soon as the first batch was all gone.

I took other reviewers' advice, and increased flour to 1-3/4 cup and baking soda to 1 tsp, decreased salt to 1/2 tsp (I used unsalted butter). Make sure to refrigerate the dough before baking, and then they won't spread at all.

I followed the recipe , cutting back on the salt as many suggested.  I did not overmix .  The first tray out of the oven were very dry.  So I cut back the time to a little over 10 minutes for the next batch.  That helped but they were stll dry and not chewy.  I will not make again.

These came out dry and didn't have a chewy, gooey texture as expected. 
They didn't flatten at all during cooking so they came out like thumbprints. 
I followed the recipe exactly as posted. 
I won't make them again.

These are pretty good! 4 starts because I cut the sugar down (it asks for a lot!!!) and the cook time was way off for me. 8 minutes pretty much burned mine but 5/6 minutes was perfect. They do brown on the outside and are nice and moist on the inside. They also keep their shape which is nice.

I thought this was just an average cookie.  The flavor was bland, but the texture and everything else was fine.  I probably won't make this recipe again.

My family has me make these regularly. They are amazing. We use a large cookie scooper which makes for a more humped cookie and locks in more softness.

These are delicious.  This is the second time I've made this and I didn't have issues with the recipe, although I always use a combo of butter and crisco so maybe that makes all the difference.  They are just yummy and I'd like to think healthy with all the oats in it :).  Try refrigerating the dough for at least an hour if you have problems with spreading.

These cookies do not spread a lot, which was nice.  I used a scoop to put them on the baking sheet and they held their shape very well.  Also because of the nuts in the recipe (i used pecans I had left over from another recipe) I would add less salt.    I cooked them for 14 min at 325.  Delicious.

These are very good cookies, when a few modifications are made. 

At the advice of previous reviews I: cut the salt in half, doubled the baking soda, added 1/2 cup of flour. 

I also: added a full tbsp of vanilla (vs the 2/3 tbsp in the recipe), cut the walnuts to 3/4 a cup, added 3/4 cup of chopped dried cherries, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.

I almost always refrigerate cookie dough before baking, but this dough held up fine when I baked it right away.

I've made these a few times now and both times were delicious and loved by all. 
I always use unsalted butter when baking. 
First time, the wrong cookie sheet and followed the recipe to the t. 
Baking time had to be extended by more than 5 min but still turned out amazing!
Second time: everyone wants to buy them from me lol. Increased flour by ¼ cup. Increased baking soda by ½ teaspoon. Decreased salt by ¼ teaspoon. 
A nice heaping tablespoon on the cookie sheet. 
Baked for 13 min. 
Delish.

I made only two small changes - I used half margarine and half butter instead of all butter, as I always do this when I make chocolate chip cookies, it's just a personal preference.  I also cream the butter and sugars very well, until its light and fluffy.  The other change is I baked them at 340 degrees.  325 just seemed too low.  I think next time I'll try 350  as that's the temp I usually use for these kind of cookies.  At 340 degrees, they baked up to lovely chewy perfection with nice light brown bottoms in 16 minutes in my propane gas oven (we live kind of in the middle of nowhere boondocks,  so we have propane).   I used the quick cooking oats.   These cookies were so darn good!  My husband and I really enjoyed them so much.  They were moist, chewy and had just the right sweetness.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, it's a keeper!

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding the nuts. The cookies turned out delicious. My oven runs a little cool so I left them in a few minutes longer but kept an eye on them to make sure that they didn't burn.

Skipped the walnuts but other than that followed the recipe as written.  They were excellent. Did have to bake mine a bit longer. Would use this recipe again.

Cookies turned out very good and stayed soft days after. The only change I made was adding a package of vanilla instant pudding.

Without an electric or hand mixer, but using a locally made, hand-carved wooden spoon to combine the ingredients, I made these delicious chocolate chip oatmeal cookies

This is the best cookie recipe I have ever used. Not just best oatmeal recipe but best cookie. The only suggestions I have are to use real butter (Margarine is still good but real butter puts these over the top) and to pull them out at exactly 12 minutes. They may not look quite done, but they are. Also to refrigerate the batter for about 20 minutes before cooking, they come out a little fluffier.

Excellent cookies! I omitted the nuts because I don't like them, and I increased the flour by 1/4 cup, doubled the baking soda and increased the chocolate chips by a half cup. I also had to bake them for abut 15 minutes in my oven.

This is a terrible recipe.  How can anyone give it 5 stars when  by the comments, everyone had to modify it to add another half-cup of flour?  I followed this recipe exactly, and the cookies were flat and sticky, they are also overly sweet, masking any oatmeal taste.  Also had to increase the temp because at 325 they just wouldn't cook enough to eat.

I have looked for a GOOD oatmeal chocolate chip cookie for a long time. I am a good cook but not a good baker. I read the reviews and did this. I increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups, Used 1 tsp of baking soda and 1/4 tsp of salt because I used salted butter. I also cut the butter to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup apple sauce.  I mixed the oats, flour, baking soda and salt together then added them gradually to the wet ingredients. I let the eggs get to room temp before mixing them into the batter. I baked them at 335 degrees for 12 minutes.  They are YUMMY!!!

These cookies are so good! I took another reviewers advice and increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups and the baking soda to 1 teaspoon. My daughter is allergic to walnuts so I left those out. I didn't have quick cooking oats but the old fashioned oats I used gave the cookies a great texture. Will add these to my cookie exchange arsenal.

They're ok. The taste is fine but the texture was just not what I was looking for. I'll admit that I used oil instead of butter but they were too crumbly and didn't bind well.

I made a few changes to this recipe. #1 I added 1 more t of vanilla, #2 I used pecans (because in Louisiana they grow for free in my yard, and are delicious, #3 I used half white chocolate chips, and half chocolate chips because I love white chocolate. These cookies were AMAZING! I will no doubt use this recipe again.

Very good cookies and everyone loved them. I added a couple dashes of cinnamon because oatmeal and cinnamon are soulmates. I made one batch with nuts and the other with chocolate chips. I'll be making these again soon!

I used white chocolate chips because I didn't have milk or semi sweet ones and to compensate for the sweetness, I added a tiny bit more salt than was necessary. I also microwaved the butter too much so it was  between melted and softened and my cookies turned out amazing (I prefer undercooked cookies). I would also recommend mixing the dry ingredients before adding it to the butter mixture. I forgot to do so so the salt isn't evenly distributed. I baked them for 12 mins, the edges were crispy  and the middle was soft

Did my Christmas baking today; I did as other Reviewers suggested, upped the flour by 1/2C and the baking soda by 1/2 tsp, creamed/beat the butter and sugars longer than suggested and mixed the dry ingredients by hand. I used a cookie scoop to drop them onto nonstick foil lined pans and baked until lightly browned. Daughter doesn't care for raisins or nuts, so I used Ghirardelli's semi sweet chocolate chips. As you can see, the cookies are in various stages of light brown deliciousness. Daughter ate one still warm from the oven and said they're very good; that's big coming from a teen who doesn't care for oatmeal cookies! Thank you for sharing. This is my go to recipe for oatmeal cookies.

Made it exactly as the recipe said. I had to cook them for a bit longer although this was probably due to having a small sheet and larger cookies. They came out amazing, everyone in my family loved them. Very delicious!

This is my absolute favorite cookie recipe, I've been making it for years! 

I do change it up a TINY bit though to make it perfect:
1. I nix the walnuts and just add extra chocolate chips (white chocolate, dark chocolate, semi-sweet mmmm)
2. I use course salt, this adds an amazing salty sweet taste.
3. I ALWAYS refrigerate or even freeze the dough before cooking, for at least an hour. This ensures they don't flatten out too much.

I've gotten so many compliments on these cookies, they have an amazing, unique flavor and the texture is amazing, chewy and delicious.

It's a really great recipe. The only thing I changed was adding more chocolate chips. I also put a pan of water in the oven while baking them to keep the cookies moist.

These cookies are a huge hit. I make cookies every year for Christmas and give them as gifts. My friends and family love them. I didn't change anything about the recipe. It's perfect as it is for me.

Very easy to make and tasted great.  I ended up leaving the cookies in for 13 minutes as opposed to 12.  Also, I used 2.5c of oats instead of 3 and did not include walnuts.

Just so-so but maybe because I took others' suggestions and increased flour and baking soda and decreased salt. Just tasted bland to me. Will not be making again.

I'm surprised this recipe has such a high rating. I was very disappointed in how they turned out. They spread a lot, got hard on the edges and stayed goopy in the middle. The taste was fine, but I couldn't serve them because they looked awful.

I made it exactly like the recipe ... and they are not good, undercooked, and tasted strange. My daughters liked them because ... there's sugar involved. Won't make again.

Delicious, one of my favorite cookies!  I did cut down on the walnuts by half.  I followed the recipe exactly (apart from the walnuts) and didn't have a problem with them flattening out.  I did cook two sheet trays at the same time and on parchment paper.  I let the cookies cool on the trays, because they looked underdone, they turned out perfect!

Made these cookies to the exact measurements and they came out horrible! They came out super soft, and dull. I added more chocolate chips and baked them longer and what came out was a super crunchy-over-sugary dry piece of dirt. Do not recommend this recipe! I have baked many cookies and many other recipes and this is by far the worst one.

Rewriting my review since I hit Enter before finishing... These are delicious!  I made them with only two changes. 1) Subbed more chocolate chips for the walnuts. We just don't care for the nuts in most cookies. 2) I greased my cookie sheets because I didn't trust my sheets. Lol  I'm not sure why some had their cookies go flat, or their dough was too wet. I assumed it should be more wet since it's a chewy cookie. I uploaded a side by side photo of two separate baked batches from the same dough. My lighter ones were in 13 minutes, cooled a bit longer than five on the sheet.  The darker were 14 minutes with almost no cooling time. Both are yummy but 13 minutes worked best for my preference.

I don't see what all the fuss is about with these cookies. I followed the recipe to a T. The cookies came out undercooked... as in mostly raw. And the other reviewers are right, the dough is really salty. Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are wonderful, but this specific recipe is not.

This is the cookie that got me eating cookies again. I fell in love with it as made by the local coop , they call them WCCO cookies, and looked for the recipe.  These fit the ingredients and are equally as wonderful.  I made a half batch and only cut the white sugar and chocolate chips.  They are chewy, gooey when warm and rich without being too sweet.  I might put some coconut in the next batch.  Thanks so much for sharing this.

I made the recipe to the exact proptions... my feeling is they were more like a granola bar( dry and hard)... perhaps will add more butter and an extra egg nextime.plus the recipe called for two cups of chocolate chips...I should have put the whole bag in!

Had trouble on the first batch because the cookies flattened out. On the second batch I turned the oven temp to 375 and timer to 10-12 min and that allowed the cookies to rise. Great tasting recipe

I scaled to 28 servings as I only had 2 cups of rolled oats. Doubled the vanilla and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. Used mini m&ms for the chocolate chips and walnuts. My son and his friends enjoyed them.

After reading most all of the comments, I made this cookie recipe with: 1 cup salted butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1-1/2 cup flour, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1/2 tsp. salt, 3 tsp. vanilla extract, no nuts, 12 oz. pkg. semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2-1/2 cups quick cook oats.

The mixture was a bit dry which is why I put only 2-1/2 cup instead of 3 cups of oats.  I put the mixture in the freezer for about 10 minutes.  I lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper.  I scooped out the dough using a small cookie scoop (similar to an ice cream scoop), I pressed each cookie dough lightly before baking.  

After many people were complaining of the cookie dough running together while baking, I thought it best to freeze for a bit, after the first batch it was unnecessary.  Matter of fact, had I not pressed the dough down slightly they might not have spread out much.

The cookies were moist & chewy, great tasting!  I only gave it 4 stars because I had to make a few modifications.

Loved this, they are coming out of the oven now and they aren't likely to last! A little crunch but still soft.  I agree with cutting back the salt.  I used unsalted butter and only 1/2 t of salt, but I did increase the the baking soda to 1t and the flour to 1 3/4.  I needed to bake mine a little longer to get them just golden brown before coming out of the oven so others may want to adjust that timing if they use the recommended 325 degree setting. Enjoy!!!!!

This is the BEST recipe ever!! I don't change a thing and bake it for the exact length of time the recipe calls for. With that said..... I am now breastfeeding and I turned these into lactation cookies, I added flaxseed because that's pretty much the only difference between these and lactation cookies. I love switching it up and adding coconut. I just can't even say enough good things about this recipe. Do everything the exact same way and you will love it. I DO leave the walnuts out because I'm allergic but I have used pecans and it was great but I usually just leave nuts out.

Amazing cookies, but there is some room for improvement in the recipe. instead of "heaping spoonfuls" use small handfuls (they tend to expand a lot in the oven) and raise the temperature from 325° to 350°. unless of course you like your cookies to be huge and undercooked.

This is a GREAT recipe! I use sweet cream, unsalted butter and it gives them that gourmet flavor! I did have to make some adjustments. I use 2 1/2 c flour, 1 tsp baking soda and only 1/4 tsp salt. I also use 1 1/2 c dark chocolate chips! I have not had a problem with flat cookies! I spread the dough in a 9x13 pan and cook for approximately 30 min. It makes about 3 dozen cookies (with one or two left over for the baker!) Also, it is a forgiving recipe! I misread the amounts of brown and white sugar so ended up adding 1/2 c too much! They turned out fine!

Made 24 large cookies so they took more time to cook. 16 minutes, and they were perfect, soft and chewy. Will definitely make these again.

I used the metric conversion and wonder if that changed things. They were a bit too salty, perhaps because I also had salted butter, and turned out pretty flat - and I definitely didn't over mix. If anything, I undermixed.

This was amazing! I used a small melon baller for the size and they turned out perfectly. The only thing I didn't add was the nuts as I didn't have any on hand. They are almost all gone after a day. Will make again for sure.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!  These are great!  My "secrets" are:  take dough and make it into the balls you plan to cook.  THEN,  put them in the freezer about 30 minutes.  THEN bake them as directed   They are PERFECT!  Crisp, chewy and all the stuff you want want when you bake a cookie.  Do this and you won't fail with this recipe. I did double the walnuts.....  I love walnuts! :)

These are nice chewy  cookies. I followed recipe as written except I did not add nuts and used 1/4 cup of whole grain white flour in place of regular flour.  My cookies raised nicely. The only change I would make to the cookie would be to slightly decrease salt.

I did read some of the reviews and added more with flour , oatmeal & baking soda and less on salt. The cookies came out flat and I like my cookies thicker. Next time I make it, I'll use crisco instead of butter.

WOWOWOWOWOWOWOW! These are the best cookies I've ever tasted. I brought them to work, and my coworkers couldn't get enough. I used unsalted butter, so I put a teaspoon of salt, like the recipe suggests. However, next time I make these, I will use half a teaspoon of salt like some other reviewers suggested. I also increased the flour by half a cup and increased the baking soda by half a tablespoon. Remember not to over-mix. My cookies came out perrrrfect. I had to leave them in the oven for a bit longer than 12 minutes. You have to keep an eye on them — you'll know when they're ready!

It was really great! Chewy as expected. They turned out slightly salty and so I'd suggest for salt-free butter instead of just "butter" on the ingredients list. Alternatively, don't add in the salt.

I followed the recipe but made the modificiation that almost everyone mentioned (not over mixing, increasing flour to 1-3/4 cup, using 1 teasp vanilla, 1 teasp cinninmon and 1/2 teasp salt as well as chilling dough first and setting oven to 335 degress and baking for 12 minutes and letting cool on cookie sheet for 5 min before removing. I got hard dry overly sweet bland lumpsthat never spread nor did the chocolate chips melt. I'm very disappointed. Usually when I make cookies they turn out well. I'm never using this recipe again.

These are some pretty satisfying cookies. I followed the recipe as written. My critiques are that they have a little too much butter for me and the cookie part is a little lacking in flavor other than butter. I think next time I will try cutting down on the butter and swapping in some applesauce. Maybe that will solve both problems of personal taste. However, my boyfriend just loves them and has devoured half in a day. 
I did not have a problem with the cookies flattening out too much. I would recommend chilling the dough for an hour or two before baking to prevent that.

A great cookie, if you know how to make it right. Its a little too much salt so half a teaspoon would be better. You don't want to over mix, but overall, a really tasty cookie.

This is my absolute favorite recipe. It's also my husbands favorite. The only changes I make are  increasing the flor by 1/4 cup and substituted  half the flour with whole wheat and decreasing the brown sugar by 1/3 cup...don't need too but I am trying to add more healthy .  You can use a mix of raisins and chocolate chips or butterscotch or white chocolate or cranberries .. Always amazing. When they come out of the oven they might look a bit underdone...not so they cook in their own heat and are always fabulous. Makes 4 dozen cookies and freeze well.

One note:  dont store these in an air tight container or they get very soft (and not a good soft).

I wish I could write my own note for this recipe and not post a rating because I am recently very irritated about all the great ratings for some recipes but when you look at the reviews the recipe is changed.  GRrrr!  But now that is what is happening here.    I think allrecipes.com needs to address this issue and that may help with the reviews/ratings.  

Great recipe.  As with every singe recipe I make, I always use less sugar so i used 3/4 cu. brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar.  I used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 c. of applesauce, 1 1/2 cups flour although 1 1/4 cups probably wouldve been fine, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. baking soda, and no walnuts.  I cooked it on convection for approximately 17 minutes! (My daughter used big, round spoonfuls!)

Excellent cookie, although I made several changes to make it closer to a favourite recipe of my M-I-L's:  1 1/4 cups butter, no walnuts, 1 cup coconut, only 1 1/4 cup quick oats. Cookie is flat, chewy and delish!

Didn't have light brown sugar - used dark; Didn't have enough nuts so only used about 1/2 finely chopped; made it late so refrigerated until the next morning - turned out great.  Chewy center with crisp outside.

Fantastic! Mine did not flatten out, they turned out delicious. I changed the temp from 325 to 375. For 9-10 min and because I didn't have enough butter on hand I used crisco.

Best I've had! I did need to add 5 minutes to get theme to Brown nicely, but that's probably my old oven.

Great cookies, I did modify the recipe a little by adding 1/2 cup more flour, 1 cup chocolate chips & 1/2 cup m&ms. They were very moist, chewy, & fat, they didn't spread out flat like some of the other reviews stated.  They were absolutely awesome!!

I made this and I measured everything.  They seemed to fall flat badly. 

Maybe I did over mix...hard to know what that looks like.  I will try this one more time and follow some tips of others.  :|

Ok this recipe will create a monster. It's SO delicious (and I added PEANUT BUTTER!!) Followed the previous recs of +1/2c flour, + 1/2t baking soda, and -1/2t salt and HIGHLY recommend doing the same. Also, I know it's satisfying to beat ingredients until uber smooth, but just don't do that when you beat in the eggs. Add 1, beat it for about 5-8 seconds, add the next and repeat. After setting the mixer aside, this is where I added in the PB... When you add vanilla, take about 2T PB (I used creamy but crunchy would be fun/tasty) and just GENTLY stir it on in until it is combined with the rest. When you mix in the flour, salt and baking soda mixture, just nicely mix it in. Don't look for the white to disappear. Of course I was generous with my oat and choc chip measurements, but who's counting? I baked these bad boys on parchment paper (after consuming about 1 cookie's worth of dough- oops!!) and they cooked evenly/ clean up was a sinch. I've made these cookies 3x and have cooked them about 13 mins each time. Maybe my oven doesn't get as hot, unsure about that but just use your baker's common sense!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made.  I love a cookie with pecans and chocolate chip.  I did follow another reviewer and did the 1 3/4 cup flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt since I used salted butter.  I  only used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil (which I use all the time).  I did cook at 335 degrees and after the recommended 12 minutes, felt they were too doughy in the center,  I cooked them 2 more minutes and let them cool completely on the cookie sheet.  They were perfect.  I posted a picture of my finished product.

I am a picky cookie lover, I like them chewy and soft. I followed the recipe with only 2 adjustments. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and increased flour to 1.5 cups. I made heaping tablespoon cookies and baked them for 12 min at 335. They were absolutely perfect. I loved the extra vanilla and the generous salt saved me from adding the extra sprinkle at the end.

These cookies taste amazing! I modified the recipe, though. Instead of the walnuts, I put in 2 cups of raisins. I was afraid that the batter was too thin, so I gradually added more flour until I liked the consistency. In my oven, I ended up cooking 7 minutes on each side (I turned them around so they got an even cook). Everyone in my family loved them! Next time, I will be adding peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips and then putting in blackberries, as well. I'm so excited!! Great recipe. I would strongly recommend this!

I added about a cup more flour to the recipe I originally doubled, and they turned out looking like a cookie instead of a buttery pancake.  If you do make them, they taste great just add about a half cup more flour or so that it isn't too sticky when you roll them into a ball.

I used half a cup whole wheat flour, and a cup and half rice flour, and 2.25 cups of oats  so same total amount of dry ingredients just in different proportions , and I added another half a cup of brown sugar cuz the original recipe wasn't sweet enough for me or my family. it turned out more chewy inside and more crispy outside than the usual recipe :D

Delicious cookie!  I added a little ground flaxseed and walnuts to amp up the yum but no other additions.  I tried baking these cookies at 350 degrees for approximately 12 mins...the result was a slightly crispier outside but a soft and chewy inside!  Delicious and hard to resist, this is my go to oatmeal cookie recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I read a lot of the reviews and decided to go with adding the little extra flour, baking soda & less salt. Here's what I did...all the other ingredients I kept the same measurement. I used 1 3/4 c. of flour, 1 tsp baking soda & 1/4 tsp salt. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp all spice. I creamed the butter and sugars just until combined (not light and fluffy). I followed the directions on combining the rest of the ingredients. The oven at 325, I scooped out portions with a cookie scoop, placed on parchment paper lined baking sheets and placed in fridge for about 1/2 hr. I baked for 12-13 min. The cookies didn't flatten out or spread to much, they weren't gooey on the inside, they were firm on the outside and good texture on the inside. I use steel cut oats for my cookies. The flavor was balanced with the sweetness and the spices I used. In my baking I usually bring my eggs and butter to room temp, but this time I took the butter out of the fridge and microwaved for about 10 seconds to just soften it. If the butter is too soft, then the cookies will spread. I like this recipe and will keep the changes I made. I hope this helps everyone!

Came out very well. Didn't add any white sugar and thought the result was still sweet enough (for me).  Everyone loved the cookies and these are not the preferred 'healthy' snack in our house.

These cookies were a huge hit with my husband and I and our 5 children. They are SO good! My kids are begging me to make them again and have even chosen them as our 'cookie of the year' to make for Santa. I did follow some of the recommendations in the comments using more flour, salted butter but no additional salt, and a little more baking soda. I can't review without those changes, because I never tried making them exactly as the recipe suggests. For me 335 degrees and 11 minutes worked perfect.

I have been searching for a real "Chewy"  oatmeal chocolate chip cookie and I believe I have just found it! Made this the other day and thought I would make it healthier by omitting the butter and replacing with applesauce, worked great, but like I said it turned out very chewy and that is what I was after.

I have never been a big fan of oatmeal cookies. I always found them too dry. Well move over my cookie favorite, there is a new cookie in town. 
Wow, I have to say these cookies are hard to stop eating. Soooo... good. They are very easy to make and will be in my home often.  Great recipe!

I only used half the salt and added 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 tsp. baking soda. Also, I used room temperature eggs and tried not to over mix. They came out great, the whole family loved them! This will be my new go-to chocolate chip oatmeal cookies, will definitely make them again!

I made this last night. They turned out great! I made the changes that were suggested in the reviews (extra half cup flour, extra half teaspoon baking soda, and extra oats), I also added raisins. After I made the batter, I put it in the fridge for 30 minutes. I used a heaping tablespoon for each cookie...32 in all and cookies were perfect, not flat at all.

Awesome cookies!! Soft and chewy with lots of great texture and flavor. I used salted butter so I decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp, and after reading other reviews I increased the flour to 1 3/4 cup and the baking soda to 1 tsp. I chilled the dough for a couple of hours before baking, so had to increase the baking time slightly, to 13 minutes. The cookies still looked gooey in the center when I took them out, but firmed up nicely during cooling. Even my 12 year old, who HATES oatmeal, can't get enough of these cookies. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Added more flour and baking soda like the others, but overall this cookie is not at the top of my list. Probably wont make again.

They were scorched on the bottom, I lowered the temperature to 300 and moved my oven rack from just below the middle to the second slot from the top to finish baking them.  The second batch cooked better at 300 for about 17min (light golden edges and bottom).  The flavour is good.  Mine didn't crumble apart,  I think this was because I formed them into balls, rather than loosely spooning them onto the pan.

I followed the advice and added flour, powder and put less salt and they were perfect! I didn't add the nuts though because I was making them for the office and there are so many people with nut allergies that I thought it would be safer.
I'm still not sure what the chocolate chips do for the oatmeal though because I always find that the oatmeal taste is stronger than the chocolate but they were good!

I increased the flour to 1 3/4 and the baking soda to 1 tsp as recommended.  I used unsalted butter, but it was still a little salty, so I'll halve the salt next go round.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp ground cloves.  Doubled the nuts and halved the choco chips (just for our personal taste).  SO. GOOD.   And even better the next day.  Perfect toothsome chewy texture.  I chilled half the dough and didn't chill the other half.  Didn't notice a big difference in spread or texture.  Very easy to make, will def be making these again.

These cookies are so addictive!  I used 2 cups of oats instead of the three it called for .  I also didn't have any walnuts on hand so I added Reece's mini peanut butter cups.  Just took about 8 or 10 and put them in the food processor before adding to the mix.  The cookies did come out on the flat side but still moist and delicious.  I also drizzled them with Nutella.  I plan on making them again and again!

This is a great recipe! I would recommend adding at least 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon. Also, make sure to spray your pans heavily or these cookies will stick. I made half with raisins & the other half with chocolate chips & they all turned out. They taste delicious heated up with coffee in the morning!

I don't like changing recipes and then reviewing but we have to (my wife has dairy allergies and is very sensitive to gluten).  We subbed out vegan chocolate chips, gluten free flour and also vegan margarine in this recipe (you have to be careful with the vegan margarine though - some are too watery).  Turned out very well.  My wife loved them.  We do use eggs (she's slightly allergic to them) but you could sub out easily flax seed blended with water or an egg replacer to be truly vegan and gluten free.

I've made these many times now with no real changes. I've used white or whole wheat flour - with and without walnuts and exchanged chunks for the morsels. You just can't do it wrong! Love, love these cookies and my husband can hardly wait for them to come out of the oven. I like that they don't spread too much and can't really comment on the timing because I always monitor that. Oven temps vary so much from heat type to oven size to altitude, I mean...really. Any baker knows you can't just say 12 minutes and expect that to be correct every time! Anyway, try them - I highly recommend.

Absolutely love this cookie!! I have been looking for a good oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe for a while! I think the quick oats make all the difference.. they make the cookie chewy, but not as big and bulky as old fashioned oats. I read the other reviews about  the dough being flat or gloppy, I just added a quarter cup more flour, and cut the salt in half, and they came out perfect; thick and chewy! One extra tip: I used 80% vegetable oil margarine sticks, and you would never know that it had no butter in it. Make sure to get the 80% sticks, anything less doesn't work. This cookie is going in my recipe book permanently!

Tweeked the recipe by using virgin coconut oil instead of butter and cooking for 10 min instead of 12. No flat cookies and no burnt edges.

I followed the recipe and my only addition was a half-teaspoon corn starch (something I add to all my cookies to help them puff up nicely); otherwise, I made no changes and I used a large cookie dough scoop and had 14 dough balls which I chilled in the fridge for 2 hours. I baked them for 10 minutes on two sheets with parchment paper on them, let them cool 10 minutes and transferred to cooling racks. They were still slightly gooey in the centers when removed from the oven. You DO NOT WANT these cookies over baked. I cannot stress this enough or you will have hard cookies when cooled. The cookies stayed puffed up, were tender and gooey in the centers but just slightly crisped around the edges. My granddaughters and their friends said they were the best ever!  Will definitely use this again. Yes, there are changes I can do to make it more healthy for my husband and I but made as written - they are just perfect the way that they are.  I will add that putting the mounds of cookie dough (not the bowl of dough) in the fridge for at least two hours will guarantee the nice thick puffy cookie that we all desire and not a flat one when cooled. Be sure to let them cool on the pan as advised so that they hold together when transferred to a cooling rack. Love these!  YUM!!!

Made this tonight. Second batch is in the oven. I did add more flour, less salt and a tad more baking soda as other reviews suggested. Also, creamed butter sugar  mixture for 5 minutes. Cookies came out light, fluffy, and not over overwhelmingly sweet. Family enjoyed the first batch that are now gone.

The best oatmeal raisin cookie ever! I will say a long long time ago I came across a recipe online on a forum or blog, and have never found that recipe again. They were the ultimate ultimate...but since that recipe has long been lost, and I have tried every other recipe...these now hold the title. My other favorite cookie is "The best big fat chewy chocolate chip cookie" from here. I took a cake decorating class and can do fancy cakes and such...and because of that little fact, coupled with these recipes, family, friends, co-workers lol they have all said I should be a baker! Little do they know....

This cookie is sooo good! I cut the recipe in half and i had 13 cookiese. The only modification i made is to use coconut oil instead of butter and i didn't add walnuts. I baked it on 325 degrees for 12 mins as per the instruction but it was still really doughy so i put it in the oven for another 8 minutes and it was the perfect softness.

I made it almost exactly the same except that I only used 3/4 cup brown sugar and omitted the white sugar. then I added 1/2 cup chocolate. So yummy!

These deserve 5 stars. Do be careful on the timing of them. I took them to work and people said they were the best cookie they'd ever had.  I like that they have a little less sugar than other recipes, too.  will be my new go-to cookie.

I have made this a number of times and it is one of the better choc chip cookie recipes with oatmeal (sometimes we do w/o oatmeal depends on what we feel like)

I LOVE it.  We cut white sugar to 1/4 c. instead of 1/2 and my girls don't like walnuts so no nuts. 

We cooked with convection at 300 for 12 min on parchment paper.  PERFECTION!

Made as described in instructions. No problems.  Thick batter, flattened down with spoon, very little spreading.  Crisp and chewy. Kids loved them.

Wonderful alternative to standard regular chocolate chip cookies.  Nice to add some healthy ingredients like oats and walnuts to an all American Treat none of us are ever going to give up!!

These are unbelievably good.  I only variate  from the recipe a tad because I always melt 1/2 the butter to give any cookie the best gooey/crunchiness..  On the last batch I replaced white chocolate chips and added about 1/3 cup semi-sweet.  I think using the same chocolates, especially semi, overpowers the taste.

These cookies turned out amazing, but I can't give it 5 stars because I made several modifications: I used half unsalted butter and half shortening. I increased the flour to 1-1/2 cups (most reviews say to use 1-3/4, so I'm not sure if that would have made them turn out even better), increased the baking soda to 1 tsp, and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. I also left out the walnuts and added extra chocolate chips. I then chilled  the batter in the freezer for about an hour. Since the dough was hard, I rolled them into balls instead of dropping by the spoonful, which just made them come out more round. I baked them at 350 degrees for 12-13 minutes.

These are delicious.  I personally use less butter but I don't think it makes much difference. However, I would never bake them at 325. that's much too low. They come out perfectly at 350. My oven is not old nor is it broken either. Just thought people should know.

My go-to recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip--every batch I've made is usually gone within twenty or so minutes after the initial baking (depending on whom I'm making them for), and each time the cookies turn out with the same quality (even in doubled or tripled batches!).

The only recipe I've made over and over. I use gluten-free flour and I've used splenda brown sugar before also. All work beautifully. The only thing is that I usually let them cook a little longer.

Used about 1/4 cup finely ground oat bran along with the cup flour. These came out VERY delicate and chewy (they flatten quite a bit when cooked). Husband LOVED them. I made them special - he loves oatmeal walnut cookies so he is a connoisseur. LOVED them.

Horrible recipe.  I want to follow a 4-5 star recipe without making changes and it should be great. I had to throw most of these cookies out as they fell apart. Way to soft and tasted like nothing special.

These spread and were very flat. And 325 degrees is not hot enough as they were undercooked at 12 minutes. I ended up increasing to 350.

I discovered this trick by accident. Add the oats-chips-nuts to the wet mixture before the flour mixture and mix with your hands. This  prevents your cookies from flattening in the oven.. I don't know how or why it works, it just does. Your cookies will come out of the oven the same shape they went in with. I used half salted butter and half vegetable shortening and chilled the dough for 45 min.

I am giving it 4 stars because I modified it a bit. Because our family needs to cut down on salt, I used half a teaspoon of salt substitute .. and instead of using nuts, I used raisins.

These were just the most tasty and chewy cookie I've had in a long time.  The only alternation I did was add 1/2 a cup of raisins.   Now, I made three dozen cookies last night.  Today, I'm lucky to have 13 cookies left.  The family loved it and I will be making it again.

I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was good, but the cookies were really dry and "oat-y", as if the oats didn't the the moisture they needed. This is the second time I've had this result with two different brands of oats. Anyone have an idea why?

Yummy...I did decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp, and increased the chocolate chips a bit in lieu of no nuts.  Don't over-stir was good advice from a previous commenter.

This recipe was great. I wanted something to satisfy my oat meal chocolate chip cookies craving so this hit the spot! I picked this recipe because it said its a real man charmer haha! And my husband is a picky snob. 
I DID HAVE TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THIS RECIPE! 
I used one stick of butter no two! Two sticks just seems disgusting!

I've made it many times and will certainly be making it many more!
I make it gluten free by changing the flour to a cup of white rice flour and a quarter cup of cornstarch, and it is delicious. Nobody can tell it's gluten free! 
I use a bit less salt and about half the sugar and it's plently sweet for me that way.

The only change I made was using Chopped cashews instead of walnuts. This turned out awesome!

Great recipe. Before I made these I read over many of the reviews and combined a few suggestions. 

I added 1/2 cup more of oatmeal and only used 1/4 teaspoon of salt since I was using salted butter. I also chilled my dough, I do that for every cookie dough and it does make a difference. Also I did a combo of white/milk chocolate chips.

Happy Baking everyone!

These cookies turned out well.  I like having the oatmeal in them.  I found the cook time needed to be increased.  I also agree that 1/2 tsp salt is adequate.  Overall, good.  I would make them again.

I usually read the comments before i make a recipe and i don't understand all the critics of this one.  I followed the recipe as written and they turned out to be the most delicious oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.  The only thing i do differently is to chill the dough and roll it into little balls.  Let them bake at 350 for 12 minutes and they'll be perfect

1st batch- very sweet, flavorful 
2nd batch- lightly sweet + milk 1/4 c + flour 1/4 c for structure and consistency 


*15 mins is plenty of cooking time for light browning- I gloss the cooking sheet with vegetable oil to allow the cookies to come off the cooking sheet a little more easier. 

*The salt takes away from the sweetness, definitely a good contrast to the flavors. Cranberries would be a great way to suit this contrast as well. 

These cookies were very flavorful and fluffy. I made sure to only mix the ingredients enough to absorb the dry ingredients. First, separating the dry and wet ingredients. Then, mixing the dry ingredients  before adding the wet ingredients. I also found it helpful to add about a 1/4 cup milk to make the cookies more moist. I leveled that mixture with flour to get the  right consistency that I desired. In the second batch, I eased up on the sugar and only used brown sugar to flavor the cookies. I also placed the cookie dough into the fridge for the dough to become more solid.

* I think its very important not to over mix the dough as this can cause the cookies to lose structure during the cooking process and even become flat.

After reading the other reviews I stacked my cookies so they we fluffier & not flat.  I baked them for 8min as my oven runs hot. I also dislike cinnamon so I didnt add any.  They turned out great.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

The cookies were a good consistency, more cakey then chewy but not flat. Very bland flavor, I would add much more vanilla and some spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg. I think I'll look for a better recipe, but this might make a good foundation for a fine oatmeal cookie.

These cookies are wonderful!  Used the same batter to make oatmeal choc chip & oatmeal raisin. I did make a few minor changes:
I used 1 3/4c flour, 1/2tsp salt, and baked on 335 for 10 minutes. I did chill my dough for about 10-15 min in the fridge.  Cookies came out chewy and crispy at the ends. I will definitely make these again.

I did add a bit more flour as some recommended, I think it would have been ok with out it added, would have been more chewy.  But it was a very good recipe that i plan on using again and again.

I make this recipe for work a lot. I have a few vegetarian and vegan friends.  I changed out the egg for applesauce.  One egg equals 1/4 c applesauce.  I also used a vegan margarine and raw sugar. Also used vegan dark chocolate chips.   Comes out good every time!

Overall, this is a good cookie recipe but I couldn't give it 5 stars since it needs to be modified. The cookies were pretty salty so I will use half of the recommended salt next time.

Just what I was looking for.  A chewy, chocolatey piece of deliciousness.  Didn't have walnuts, used chopped pecans instead.  Great for my tea break!

I followed the recipe as is but omitted the walnuts and used dark chocolate chips. Turned out great, but I think the walnuts would've been even better.

Add 2 Tbsp milk. Used 1/2 c Crisco and 1/2 c butter instead of all butter and chilled dough before baking. These were perfect!!

These are by far the best oatmeal cookies I've tried in awhile. I followed directions and only added a splash of milk at the end to get a softer dough. They turned out  very good and my hubby loved them!

The best occc's I've ever made.  The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5, is the lack of cc's in the recipe.  C'mon, we can do better!  I doubled it up to 2 cups and threw in a tsp of cinnamon.

This is my third time making these cookies. The first time I made them, someone told me they were so good that I could sell them! I followed the recipe exactly the way it was written. EXCEPT for, I did not have brown sugar, so I substituted with one cup of white sugar and one and one half tablespoon of molasses,in place of brown sugar. Perfect!

I made no changes except to exchange chopped macadamia nuts for walnuts
The cookies are neither soft, nor flat as in the photo
They are hard clumps. Second batch in the oven, I flattened with a fork.  Still crunchy...I so wanted soft ones!

They were absolutely okay. Maybe I was expecting too much. I found it worked better to not leave them on the pan to cool for 5 minutes, they were much easier to remove if you did it right away. Makes a lot, be ready!

Made these with dark chocolate chips. The heavy salt in this recipe pairs with the bittersweet chocolate to make this a neighborhood adult favorite.

These cookies are so good! Chewy and not overly sweet. I noted the reviews and halved the salt. I also substituted the chocolate chips for rice krispies cereal for a little crunch. To top it off, I sprinkled some cinnamon on top before baking them. Great recipe!

Made it for a class project and would SO make it again. I left the recipe as is and I didn't have any issues. It made  20 good sized cookies. I didn't have any problems with it being flat but I did pr Se it down onto the sheet after rolling it into a little ball. Amazing recipe!

For a few years now, this has been my go-to recipe for Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies.  I follow the previously posted recommendation to cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. and add 1Tbsp baking soda and add 1/2 cup flour.  I also chill the dough before baking.  With these adjustments, I give these cookies a 5 star rating.  LOVE. THESE.

This is the second time I made this recipe. We are chewy cookie connoisseurs! Changed a couple of things. Melt the butter! Liquify it. Add the sugar and mix the tar out of it. Set in fridge for 5 min while you mix the dry ingredients together. Take out the wet mix and add the eggs, vanilla, and 1 tbsp of maple syrup. Mix the tar out of it again. Add your flour mixture. Tar mix. It should be slightly runny. Fold in the oats. I added a whole bag of milk chocolate chips and did not add any walnuts. Chill in fridge for 10-15 . Tbsp drop these lovelies onto the sheet. I get 8 per standard sheet.  Put that mix back in fridge. Cook for 12 min exactly.  Cool for 5 min on sheet. Transfer to cooling rack. They are extra chewy and my husband ate 30 cookies in less than a day. They go fast.

Darn good cookie. Forget the walnuts and raisins, throw in a cup (or more if you're a chocoholic) of chocolate chips. Raise the temp to 350 and let her rip for 12 - 13 mins. No offense to the raisin/nut peeps, I just dig on some chocos in these beauties.

I made this recently and before I could get the cookies onto the cooling rack, half of them were eaten. Delicious, soft, melt in your mouth. The only thing I modified was the amount of oats - reduced the amount from 3 cups to 2 as the batter was stiff enough. Didn't  miss the extra cup.

Zero changes.  Comes out perfect everytime.  I bake on parchment and make the cookies about 2 tsp batter.  Even though it makes a lot of cookies, I usually double and freeze half.  I have made this recipe at least 10 times.  My family's favorite.

Taste is very good, BUT after following other reviewers suggestions (1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 tsp more baking soda,  1/2 LESS salt, added cinnamon, and baked at 335),  my cookies didn't spread AT ALL... they stayed in little heaps.  They also taste a bit dry.  I wish I had tried the recipe in its original form before changing it around!

This is the best cookie recipe I've ever tried.  If I could, I'd give it 10 stars.  I followed the recipe except for the sugar.  I used brown instead of white and cut it by 1/4 cup.  Yummy!

I used unsweetened coconut from Red Mill- and I don't ever use table salt- just sea salt!  I like it! I feel like  there was something that was missing- but I can't figure it out- maybe shoulda used sweetened coconut! Idk- mine came out chewy- and I mad big fat ones not small spoon sized- I did tablespoon dollops!

Love these! I used mini m&m's instead of chocolate chips and they turned out great! I followed the review that added the 1/2 cup of flour and did the full tsp of baking powder. I also used 1/4 tsp of salt and substituted margarine. I baked for 14 minutes at 335, but, my oven is wonky so I recommend watching your first batch and go from there. So good. My husband is a cookie snob and he liked them too!

I use Himalayan Pink Salt as my salt. I have been baking since I was a child so I chalk this up to experience, my cookies were perfect, not too salty, rounded and chewy, not flat at all.

I will most certainly keep this recipe for a favorite!  I like the taste as well as texture.  I did use pecans instead of walnuts, and I only had milk chocolate chips on hand.  No problem.  I do make a similar recipe using dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips.  That one is on my keeper listing as well.

as other reviews have advised me i increased the flour by half a cup and baking soda by a half teaspoon, and then cut the salt to a half teaspoon. as well as this i added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe. they turned out amazing and the whole family loved them - my aunt even insisted i pack some for her to take home!

The flavor of the cookie was good but they didn't bake well. They were flat & no matter what I tried they were either too done or too raw. I tried others suggestions with the second batch by adding more flour and baking soda but it didn't help much.

Recipe was easy, I made them with Gluten Free flour and oatmeal. I also subbed out chocolate chips with chocolate covered raisins.  These are OK, I prefer my oatmeal cookies with a little more substance, thicker.  I guess I would add more oatmeal next time.

I followed other people's suggestion and increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups and increased the baking soda to 1 tsp.  I also left out the salt because I was using salted butter.    I stuck them in my freezer for a half hour before baking.  I did have to bake them for a few extra minutes but they turned out really good.

Every cookie came out perfectly!  I opted to add the extra flour and baking soda and decrease the salt. I portioned the dough using a # 100 scoop and baked them for 11 minutes. 
Thank you for a great tasting recipe. Will most definitely make it again.

my whole family raved! I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. and (accidentally) added another 1/4 cup of flour to the recipe.  I have an old oven so I never know what results it will give me and so I decided to change it to 350 F and baked it for 20 minutes, rotating the baking sheet on the 10 min. mark.  My cookies came out slightly crisp on the top but moist at the bottom.  It is on the very sweet side and maybe I will try changing the sugar proportions next time.  Overall, good recipe.

I wish I had just dug out my old, tried and true oatmeal cookie recipe!  I also need to make sure and read reviews EVERY time, instead of once in awhile.  These oatmeal cookies are so flat, and the flavor is fine, but honestly, there are so many good oatmeal cookie recipes out there; no need to doctor this one, just find a different one!

My kids loved these!  I did, however, tweak as follows:  I used one-half cup butter and one-half cup shortening.  I also added a cup of dried cranberries.  I also refrigerated the dough for 10 minutes each time before adding spoonfuls to the sheets for baking- this and the shortening avoided getting a "flat" cookie.  Finally, I had to bake them for 15-16 minutes, but they were great.

Oh. My Goodness! I am so glad I found this recipe!!! I wanted to make Oatmeal cookies so badly, but I wanted something chewy, I wasn't sure about adding the chocolate chips at first, but so glad I did! Though I forgot the Vanilla, this is still a delicious cookie!!! Will be making lots of these during the months to come to send as gifts to family and friends. Thank you for sharing!

I love this cookie recipe. It's my go-to recipe. I  use salted butter, and decrease the added salt to 1/2 tsp, also I decrease the chocolate chips and use mini semi-sweet ones and they're perfect! The perfect chewy chocolatey cookie!

Disaster twice in a row. 

First time I blamed it on the oven temperature of 325. The cookies were runny and stuck like glue to the pan. Second time I increased the heat to 350 and still they stuck and were not quite done in the 12 minutes, and they still stuck. Also they fall apart even after letting them dry on a rack for two hours

Followed recipe exactly except used pecans instead of walnuts. Toasted pecans in oven first, topped cookies before banking with a couple of chocolate chips and pecans. Delicious!

Cookies are decent but not my favorite oatmeal cookies.  I used both a slipmat and parchment paper (separately) and found that the oven needs to be set to 350 degrees for a proper cook.  I prefer a soft cookie but at 325 the cookies were so soft they were falling through the wire cooling rack.

These were fantastic!   The only substitution I made was to use Butter Flavored Crisco in place of butter, which I do in all my cookies.  I baked them in a 9x13 pan for 25 minutes, and they made perfect bars.   Even the non-oatmeal-eating husband liked them, which says a lot.

Delicious dough. However, I followed the instructions as listed, and the cookies were still kind of "too soft" at the time listed. I needed to bake them another 8 minutes. Definitely need more time for higher elevations.

Update: The recipe listed above was a bit too salty and the cookies were REALLY flat and fell apart. Read the other reviews and modify the basic recipe (and if at higher altitude, add a half a cup more flour and maybe one more egg).

My favorite recipe (so far) for my favorite cookies. I've been tinkering with adding a combo of regular and coconut flour ... adds a different flavor that I love.  Last batch was 50/50 white and coconut flour and delicious.  I use unsalted butter and a scant tsp salt.  These freeze amazingly well - just leave them out for a few minutes before eating.

I made these cookies sans the chocolate chips and walnuts. They were very plain, however still tasty. The cooking time was right on the money. I highly recommend butter as the recipe suggests instead the of margarine (which I used) for taste and consistency. I also think real oats might provide a better consistency than quick oats which gave a somewhat gluey texture. Overall, a very easy recipe to make.

I made these yesterday and they turned out perfect. I followed the recipe exactly as stated, including the exact ingredients. They were very moist and chewy and delicious...they were not at all flat. They had perfect shape and texture. The only thing is that I found them a bit too sweet for my taste, so I'll be adjusting that next time I make them. But this recipe as is, is a great recipe and I will be using it again...it is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've made so far...I will just play with the sweetness aspect, but again that is personal taste and not a problem with the recipe.

These cookies were amazing, definitely making them again. I substituted the walnuts for almonds because I didn't have any walnuts and they came out great. I highly recommend this recipe.

Terrific recipe! I too altered it a bit. I do not like nuts, so i didnt add them but i used 2 cups of choc. Chips. Also i increased the butter a few tbsp. And that kept the cookies soft. I use a 1.5 inch cookie scoop and my cookies didnt get flat! You just gotta cook them a little longer (15-17 minutes).

These were not the chewy cookies I was hoping for. Although it was still a decent cookie, it was not chewy at all. In fact, the cookies were crumbly and basically fell apart second day. It was also a bit cakey for my taste.

The only thing i changes was the chocolate chips and nuts.  I didn't add any nuts.  I ran out of chocolate chips so i had to use butterscotch chips instead, i have to say it was fantastic!

Tried this recipe but for some reason the dough was really dry. The cookies never flattened out. 3 cups of oats seemed to be too much with the nuts and flour.

I have made this cookie as written and with a few minor modifications and it is delicious either way.  I substituted the eggs for 2tbsp ground flax and 6tbsp of water and instead of using 1 1/4 cups of all purpose flour I used 1 cup all purpose and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour.

These cookies were excellent and buttery I followed direction I didn't modify at all. I think the ones saying it didn't turn out right maybe your butter is way to soft which can make your cookie go flate but this recipe is perfect as written !

I followed the recipe exactly minus the nuts. I also used kosher salt because that is all I have. I changed the cooking time from 12 mins to 18 mins because they were not cooked through at 12 mins however they were still very chewy at 18 mins. Needless to say the kids loved them and ate them all within 24 hours. Will make again.

Good recipe. This cookie baked thin and just chewy enough with a little crisp on the edges - and is tasty.  I use salted butter, so used only 1/2 tsp salt.  Knowing the amount of brown sugar and butter used will help the cookies spread quite a bit, I baked 6 at a time on the cookie sheet - using a heaping kitchen tablespoon size.  The spread was about 3 1/2 inches which made for a perfect sized cookie ice cream sandwich which was dessert for our cookout get-together. I would use this cookie recipe again for cookie sandwiches, but not if I needed a bulk of cookies for casual eating munching. Thanks!

I enjoyed this cookie so much!  My new favorite cookie.  I would have given it 5 stars if I hadn't had to make some changes to the recipe.  I reduced the salt and increased the flour and the baking powder, just like other other reviewers suggested.  Make sure to really cream the butter and sugar well.  Then don't over mix everything else.  I also refrigerated the dough for a few hours before baking.  They were super good.

OH MY GOODNESS!! These are delicious, light and gooey. I added butterscotch chips and they are over the top. My only problem was that they are very heavy with oats. Way too many oats. Also I did applesauce and butter, instead of just butter, and I did 1 3/4 cups of flour, 1 tsp. of Baking Soda, and only 1/2 tsp. of salt and they are delicious.

Before making these cookies I looked through the reviews and accordingly made a couple of changes. I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 cup flour, used no salt because I was using salted butter. I baked at 335 degrees Fahrenheit for 12 minutes. However,  the first batch turned out very dry and so I added 1/4 cup water and the second batch turned out perfect!! At 335 degrees the cookies baked to perfection and the water added just the right amount of moisture!! If I was to make these again, I would NOT add as much flour, possibly just 1/4 cup extra. I also added raisins because I absolutely love oatmeal&raisins  :33

My husband LOVED these...he told me these are his favorite of always and the next day he said they were amazing. I halfed the recipe and made 35 cookies. Only change I made was to swap the amounts of the walnuts and chocolate chips. I will have to make these again!

I have been making these cookies for years now and have just recently been adventurous enough to change them up (a little). I only use 1 cup of light brown sugar (loosely packed), no white sugar at all and 3/4 cup of choc chips. They spread a bit but still have some bulk to them and have a bit of crunch on the outside while still being soft on the inside. Delish!

I use parchment paper for easy cleanup and even browning. Excellent! Letting cool 5mins on cookie sheet is key to chewy cookie that doesn't fall apart before cool. ??

This is going to be my go to oatmeal cookie, I just know it. The cookies were fat and soft and chewy. I ended up cooking them for a 2 minutes longer (14 minutes) in an oven that was 160 degrees rather than 165 as I was concerned about the bottoms and edges browning too much. The only thing I did to change the recipe was add more chocolate and I substituted the cup of walnuts for a cup of raw peanuts instead. The cookies turned out great.

Great cookies! Made it with a few changes inspired by other reviews. I increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups, reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, since I used salted butter. I omitted the nuts since my family are not fans.  I put the cookie dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes before baking. Finally, through a few tries, I found that baking the cookies at 335 degrees for 18 minutes worked best for me.

I read many reviews on this recipe before trying, however I felt that I should follow the actual recipe first to leave a ligit review. The only part of the recipe I changed was I omitted the nuts, because I didn't have any. The first cookie batch came out very flat and at 325 degrees for 12 minutes, underbaked. As the first batch cooked I put the remaining dough into the freezer to chill. The second batch I increased the heat to 335 degrees (per a previous reviewer's suggestion) and cooked for 12 minutes. they were a tiny bit better but not much. The cookies although flat did taste really good warm from the oven but would not last over 30 minutes before becoming very, very crunchy. My verdict is 3 stars as written. I would not serve these to anyone without adjustments.

As previous reviewer's suggested I will increase the flour, and the baking soda as well as chill the dough. With the changes the results are fabulous and worth 5 stars!

I followed this recipe almost to the exact. The only thing I didn't do was add a teaspoon of salt. I never add the amount of salt a recipe calls for. I just sprinkled in a little. Mixed the wet ingredients with a hand mixer and then mixed in the dry ingredients to that with a mixer. The oatmeal, chocolate chips and walnuts I mixed in by hand. The recipe says to drop by spoonfuls but I rolled them into balls and then flattened them out a bit. I also cooked for 15 minutes instead of twelve. They did not come out flat. They were absolutely delicious. I'm not normally an oatmeal cookie lover but I am embarrassed to admit I ate five of these almost immediately after baking. I was so pleased With this recipe I even took some down to my neighbor. This is most definitely a keeper recipe for me.

I really liked these, I followed the directions exactly. I used a melon baller and the first batch was actually  too round so I flattened them slightly for the second batch. I had no issues with flat cookies. Next time, I will halve the salt and throw in a bit of cinnamon.

This cookie recipe is delicious and worth every star. I forgot to read the reviews, so they did turn out flat, very much like a chewy lace cookie. I'm taking them to a potluck so I made a recipe and a half and I got LOTS of cookies. I did substitute quick steel-cut oats for more texture and used Baker's semisweet chocolate chunks too. Halfway through baking I did  chill the rest of the dough and that helped, but next time I will add more flour and baking soda to help them rise more.

These are my favorite cookies. they're super chewy and not to sweet with the oatmeal. I replace the nits with bacon! just make the bacon with brown sugar sprinkled over for ten minutes, flip and cook for another 5 min at 400. then let cool and crumble into the dough with chocolate chips. soooooo good!

My family loved these cookies. The only thing I changed was omitting the nuts and adding a few more chocolate chips. You could taste the salt in them, but I thought it gave them a sort of chocolatey sea salt flavor that is so popular.

Have been making this for a while now and I'll keep coming back to this recipe! Everyone loves them!
I cut the salt a bit, add a bit more flour, leave out the nuts (husband doesn't like them) and sometimes double the chips. 
This time I left out the nuts and added a cup of natural chunky peanut butter and wow! Outstanding!!!!

Came out perfect!  I looked at reviews and changed these ingredients: 2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, no salt, 1 tsp vanilla, some cinnamon, 2 1/2 cups old fashioned  oatmeal.  Put the batter in the fridge for a bit and in between cookies baking. Scooped batter with mini ice cream scooper.   If the batter was colder 12 minute bake time is best.  Next time I will let the butter soften at room temperature and not let it melt.  Then I will experiment with how much flour I will need.  This time the butter melted and might be why I needed so much more flour.  I also used a 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar.

Amazing! Made Exactly as written- I think the cook time is correct even though it looks doughy it will harden enough to make a chewy cookie with the 5min wait time.

I felt this cookie recipe lacked in flavor and turned out super dry. I didn't make any changes and followed general good cookie baking guides, don't over-work batter etc. The cookies looked pretty, but they were just bland and dry.

I didn't find these too different from the recipe under the lid in the oats for Oatmeal Raisin cookies. I merely swap the raisins for chocolate chips. Not bad,  but this has a lot more butter and other stuff. I think it's better to just make the recipe under the lid. Maybe I made it wrong, I don't know.

These are good- I omitted the salt altogether, cut out the white sugar , added an extra 1/2 cup of choc chips and only 2 cups of oatmeal.  My family rated them 8/10. :)

I loved this easy recipe. Mine came out perfect as per the recipe instructions.  I didn't adjust anything.  Oatmeal cookies are suppose to be flat, not a mound.  I added raisins and coconut to half the batter and Skor bits and walnuts to the other.  Both are excellent.

The best cookie recipe I've tried so far!  I add a ton of walnuts, sometimes flax seeds or chia seeds, and chocolate chips.  Soooo sooo good!

Awesome recipe!!!!!! I refrigerated the dough. All of my ingredients were cold except the butter. I left out the salt. I made them with white chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, butterscotch chips, dates and little toffey bits. I make these for my dad. These are my go to cookies. i make them all the time. They are amazing!!!
I used rum instead of vanilla with lots of dates  along with cinnamon ginger cloves and nutmeg...FABULOUS

Not enough baking soda!  Increase it to 1 tsp.  That should do it.  Also, might want to add about 1/2 cup more flour and 1/4 a cup more sugar...

This is such an amazing, perfect recipe! The cookies were super soft and chewy. However, i do agree that they would have been better with less salt, but otherwise perfect!

I mixed everything by hand, no electric mixer and had to substitute vanilla powder for extract. The cookies were definitely not flat, probably from the hand mixing, and were a nice chewy texture. My husband and guests loved them and they were all gone in 2 days!

I have used this recipe as is and modified by adding different ingredients. All the people I work with love them, I like the recipe.  I have added dried cranberries and exchanged the walnuts for macadamia nuts.  I also refrigerate the dough for a couple of hours before making the cookies.

I just made these cookies and I am SO disappointed!! :( they came out suuuuper flat and just stuck to the pan even though I used cooking spray- I tried to make the balls smaller and they still expanded to flat flat "cookies". I have a huge plate of broken crisp flat chunks of oatmeal "cookies"...I am so disappointed I can't believe it! I never make cookies too so I was making them as a treat for my husband and I. I really wanted soft thick cookies...what a bummer

I loved these cookies...chewy with lots of texture. I didn't have quick cooking oats so I just added regular oats with all the dry ingredients and blitzed it up a bit in the food processor. Will def make these again thanks!

These were fabulous. I followed the advise of other reviews and made these changes: 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt. I also omitted the walnuts. Definitely a keeper!

Made this recipe just using a little less salt as suggested by others. By the high ratings I was expecting something very outrageous. I made this for one of my desserts for Thanksgiving yesterday and I can honestly say they are the WORST cookies I have ever ever had!! I was so embarrassed!

Excellent recipe. i modified slightly by using a muffin tin (non-stick). i put a thin layer of cookie dough, then put a FunSize Hershey bar down, then covered with thin layer of cookie dough. it filled each muffin mold about 1/2-3/4, don't put too much in.

They stay chewy and EVERY bite has chocolate. plus it is easier to mix without the chips. i probably increased the vanilla by a touch, i like vanilla.

So good! Best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies me and my family have ever had! I made the modifications suggested (1/3-1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 tbsp more baking soda, cut the salt in half) and they turned out perfectly! Don't over mix and you should get an amazing result!

The flavor was great however they were flat and not as chewy as I'd hoped. Worth trying again and maybe I'll under bake them just a bit.

Since l found this recipe, l have used it to bake five separate batches and have yet to screw one up. I love a simple recipe  such as this, that gives you repeatable predictably delicious results, perfect for those sweet tooth driven cookie baking binges. My family loves these and look forward to my random acts of cookie. I follow the recipe but use the large oats and Hershey Mini milk chocolate chips. I also add a half teaspoon of cinnamon and for the raison lovers, l substitute raisins for chocolate chips. l was told that these were the best cookies that l have baked by my chief taste testers, whose  opinions l trust after subjecting them to countless "try these", and "what do you thinks". Thumbs up !!!

1tsp. Salt ruined my recipe.had to double to fix it. Maybe change 1tsp to 1/2. And the cookies were flat.

These cookies are not too bad. I followed the recipe exact. As others stated, they are too salty. I suggest only adding 1/2 tsp of salt. My cookies did not turn out flat, bc I made sure to soften my butter at room temperature (not microwave). Also, I freeze my dough while letting the oven preheat.  I also suggest cooking at 350 degrees for 14 minutes then leave them on pan for 5 minutes as recipe suggests. My second and third pan turned out better by longer cooking time. Hope this helps.

These cookies were tasty, but not soft and chewy! I took the advise of everyone on here to increase flour and baking soda.

Delicious! Could use a tad less salt if you are sensitive, but otherwise these are fantastic.  I made them exactly the recipe suggest. I'll admit, I was a little nervous after reading some of reviews saying that the recipe needed more oats. I feared the cookies wouldn't turn out well because the dough did seem a little loose.  However, I went ahead and popped the first batch into the oven to bake. Then my nervousness took over and added more oats to the 2nd half of the dough. I needed the cookies for a party at my daughters school and really needed them to turn out.  After the first batch (exactly as written) was finished, I baked the second batch (with a little more oats). Then I did a taste test with my family and EVERYONE, (including me) preferred the cookies made exactly as the recipe is written.  Took off one star for the slight saltiness of this recipe, but these cookies are super delicious anyway.

The only modifications I made were to cut the salt in half, just based on instinct and other reviews, and added a dash of cinnamon.  These were great!  The kids loved them, the hubby and I loved them too!  Make sure not to over mix the dry ingredients in to the wet , otherwise you will end up with a flat over cooked cookie, instead of the thick and chewy version that came for a proper mix. Will definitely make again.

I've made these several times and have loved them each time. In an attempt to get the cookies even more chewy and soft, I melted the butter before creaming it with sugar, used dark brown sugar instead of the light and used 1 egg + 1 egg yolk instead of both eggs. I also followed others' suggestions to increase the flour and baking soda and decrease the salt a bit. They turned out delicious. I leave out the nuts and put the dough in the freezer between batches. (I've never had the problem of the cookies going flat.)

These cookies are AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I used UNSALTED butter and the salt called for in the recipe and they were perfect. Absolutely scrumptious. So much so, I couldn't stop eating them! These are probably the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. Thank you for sharing the recipe, PANTHERA!

I didn't really care for the chocolate in these oatmeal cookies, but I like the cookie itself, so I think I will try it again with raisins or dried cranberries. Baking time was perfect. Not salty to me.

Love this cookie!! Unlike some others I really liked the 1tsp salt- great flavor and it didn't feel overwhelming at all. I also used white whole wheat flour (1.5 cups instead of 1.25), 1 tsp baking soda, omitted walnuts, and refrigerated the dough overnight before shaping them into thick discs to bake. Turned out great and was highly complimented by friends!! Had to keep some leftovers for myself.

These are amazing!
I baked them pretty much exact to the recipe...but

I ommited the salt, because I use salted butter, and I added another 1/2 Cup of flour, and another 1/2 Teaspoon of baking soda.

I bake my cookies on a metal pizza pan actyally, round one with holes.

No brown bottoms!

These are fantastic cookies, I just made them today and there are only a dozen and a half left. I added more flour, baking soda and chocolate chip. I didn't add nuts I want these for school lunches and I also didn't add the salt, didn't need it cause my butter was salted. Very good cookie

I substituted baking soda for baking powder. I never put the amount of salt that the recipe calls for. My cookies came out rather fluffy and nice. Good recipe but add baking powder in the mix to make them less flat.

I've made these cookies a million times.  In my opinion there is no need to change the recipe at all.  I bake almost every night...cookies, pies, cakes....and my husband loves these cookies.  I always have this cookie dough in my freezer for unexpected guests. Just make sure to not bake them too long. Otherwise they will be way too hard.

I have made this recipe several times and just love these cookies!  My Mom always made her chocolate chip cookies with oats and these take me back to a cherished time in my childhood!  I did cut back on the chips as I only like a hint of the chocolate taste.  I chop the walnuts very fine and love the underlying walnut flavor.

I tried this recipe as-is minus the nuts.  Not thinking I didn't account for that when adding the flour which I kept at 1 1/4 cups.  This led to 15 minute cook time and a crumbly cookie.  Certainly not in-edible by any means but aesthetically and transportationally deficient. As for as flat cookies go, overmixing is the cause.  I have come to cream my butter and sugar in a mixer, then use a wooden spoon and hand mix the rest of the way. I never have a flat cookie anymore

Nice and easy recipe. Was able to make about 60 small cookies in an hour and a half. I didn't have any of the issues people talked about (spreading too much or being too salty.) The baking time was also perfect! Chewy on the inside! Delicious!

So delicious! I made them nice and chewy by adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour and an extra 1/2 tbs of baking soda. I also cut down the salt like others have suggested. Made them today and the hubby loves them so much that I doubt they will last till tomorrow

Not sure why there are negative reviews. If your cookies are flat it's because you've over mixed the dough. Stand mixers are notorious for over mixing. I use my hand held mixer for cookies to avoid this problem. Additionally, if you chill your dough for at least half an hour or until it is firm, you'll get a more compact cookie. I used a hand mixer and did not chill the dough and mine came out perfect. I used the small dough scoop from BB&B and it made four dozen perfect. I think you get more compact cookies when you use a scoop instead of a spoon. My family loved the cookies. I might cut out some of the salt next time. I did not add nuts due to my son's braces. Next time I might try adding half chocolate chip and half butterscotch chips. Great recipe!

I thought these were pretty good. My only issue is they are a little sweet. They remind me a bit of the oatmeal cookies on the popular oatmeal box, but with chocolate and walnuts. They bake up nicely. I made 1/2 recipe and got 29 cookies. I baked them on parchment paper and portioned with a cookie scoop. They took 17 minutes to bake. ty

Delicious! I don't like salty cookies so I only used half the salt that it calls for but I did everything else exactly as it says to and they turned out perfect! They didn't flatten out like some say they do. Maybe I mixed just the right amount. :)

Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are my absolute favorite.  I've used this recipe dozens of times and my cookies are always a hit.  This recipe is better than my grandma's and that woman can BAKE! 

Also, extremely happy this website updated so you can check off ingredients as you go like other recipe sites :) 

I substitute  the semi-sweet with dark chocolate & also use Splenda instead of sugar.  & I don't use nuts. Ew!
Sometimes I throw in some coconut & it is WONDERFUL.

Sooooo I see a lot of people stating their cookies ended up flat ----> reasoning behind it is either you greased the baking sheet or cooked them on a stick free pan or you live at a crazy altitude.  These cookies need high friction on the bottom so they don't collapse and fall flat so cook them on a regular cookie sheet without oil/butter.  Flavoring wise they are ok but missing cinnamon .... I'm saddened because I attempted to save them by dusting with cinnamon but it's not the same, now it tastes like a snickerdoodle with chocolate chips. Fail

I helped this recipe out a little bit by adding 1/4 cup more flour, and just a couple pinches more of baking soda, and a lot LESS salt (based on the previous comments and ratings), and the cookies turned out awesome!I highly recommend adding more chocolate chips though ;) just for the hell of it

The cookies turned out delicious. However, I followed other
reviews and added 1/2 cup more flour, but it was unnecessary; the cookie dough turned out harder than I wanted and barely spread during baking. Next time ill try them without adding extra flour or only adding 1/4 cup

I'm at a high altitude, so they came out more crunchy than soft, but they are still wonderfully delicious. I used a little less than a cup of chocolate chips and added a little less of a cup of raisins. Other than using a bit less flour to accommodate for the high altitude, nothing else needs to be changed. Definitely try adding raisins... it's amazing!

Yummy taste, but these absolutely need the extra 1/2 cup of flour that others have called for. I went back and stirred in an extra 1/4 cup into the remaining dough after I made the first half batch, and they turned out much better. I guess if you want a thin, almost lacy cookie, this is fine the way it is written.

Loved it! The cookies are much fluffier than my usual recipe and I think part of it is because I actually followed the directions about mixing things separately. Recommend only baking for 10 mins though (that might be a high altitude thing though - we're at 4000 ft).

This recipe was absolutely amazing! Best cookies I have ever made, I did follow suggestions by other reviews and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and decreased the salt by 1/2 a teaspoon and they turned out great, will definitely be using this recipe again in the future.

I followed the recipe measurements exactly minus the nuts and they turned out great. I did add a couple of dashes of cinnamon. I made them bigger and they came out nice and chewy and not at all flat.

I did gluten free!!! replaced the 1 1/4 cup of flour with about 3/4 cup of coconut flour and they turned out amazing, you wouldn't even know they were gluten free. I will add a little less sugar next time though they were a little sweet for me.

These turned out amazing. As it so happened, I only had 1 stick of butter (1/2 c.), so I used shortening for the remainder.

I followed this recipe 100% and my cookies turned out perfect! I did not change anything except that I left out the walnuts. My cookies were not flat, they were full, crunchy outside, chewy inside! Absolutely perfect!

I made these cookies tonight and they turned out great! I added 1/4 cup more of flour. I also mixed the butter, sugar's and eggs for a long time....walked away and did other things and let the mixer do it's magic! Then I refrigerated them for an hour, baked at 350 instead of 325 for 12 minutes and they were delish!

Yummy!!  The only modifications I made were to substitute 1/4 cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour, and used 2 cups of chocolate chips and omitted the walnuts.  I felt like they needed a little more than 12 minutes in my oven... more like 12.5 or 13.  Super good cookies.  I made them to share with my daughter's kindergarten class for her birthday.  All the kids seemed to love them.  Will definitely be making these again.

I am making a version of these now, but using gluten free flour and replacing the oats with 2 cups cooked quinoa and one cup unsweetened coconut. Also I only had a half cup of chocolate chips so I added a half cup of raisins and a teaspoon of cinnamon. I have used this recipe exactly as it is written a few times and they are great. I'm looking forward to see how my variation works out! 
12 mins later.... Yumm they turned out great, I forgot to mention I also lined the cookie sheet with parchment paper!

Making these right now. Not having a problem with them spreading too much, I fact I wish they would have been flatter. I did change things a bit though so that could have made the difference. 
I used half butter and half coconut oil. I used sucralose Brown Sugar blend and splenda in place of some of the sugar. The flavor is great as is.

These cookies are amazing!!!!  I usually cut the sugar in all baked goods and this one was no different.  It does not need the entire amount of sugar.  Also, I used half white whole wheat flour and it is undetectable.  The best tip I have for cookies though is to refrigerate the dough for 24 hours AFTER mixing and BEFORE baking.  The next day I pull the dough out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter until it softens up a bit. I know it is hard to wait, usually one bakes cookies when a craving has struck:)  However, try it once and you will be a convert!  The cookies flavor intensify and deepen making a truly superb treat!

I also altered this by increasing baking soda to 1 tsp, flour to 1 1/2 cups and less salt 1/2 tsp.  I also changed the chocolate chips to white chocolate chips and kept the craisins and added macadamia nuts in lieu of walnuts.  They were delicious.

I've been making these cookies for about 2 yrs and love them. I always swap the brown sugar and white sugar and let the batter sit in the fridge for about an hour before I bake them. I sometimes add a cup of peanut butter when I have a craving and they are incredible!

I've been making these for years, and now I'm coming back for a review - these are wonderful cookies! Whenever there's a social event my friends will actually approach me and ask that I bring "those oatmeal cookies" I make. They're always a hit.
I like to replace the walnuts with craisins, sometimes I also add white chocolate chips.
Only problem is that their not fail-proof - sometimes they'll come out flat or too hard.

Very good! Made this cookie about three times. Compliments were perfect not too sweet but still satisfies and they liked the fact that I choose to make it a thick cookie by creating the ball but not pressing it down but a little. Only thing I added was approximately a tablespoon of ground flaxseed. I'm getting ready to make these right now

These are terrific!  I made them with white whole wheat flour and whole oats (not quick), so I was worried about the texture, but they were perfect.  I threw in an extra 1/4 cup flour and rolled the dough slightly and they did not flatten AT ALL.  I also love how many this recipe made!  Cookies all night long!!

These are my new "go to" chocolate chip cookie.  I put in 1 tsp of baking soda and chopped the nuts in a chopper so they were very fine.  I snuck the nuts past my picky kids and they love the cookies!  I think the finely chopped nuts gives a great texture.  My cookies were not flat at all, in fact, quite fluffy and thick!  YUM!

I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the flour by 1/2 cup, increased the baking soda to 1 tsp, and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp.  With these changes, the cookies turned out perfect.  My husband absolutely loved them!  I also added 1 cup of butterscotch chips and 1 cup of cinnamon chips instead of chocolate chips.  So scrumptious!

I love this recipe! I made a batch last night and between 6 people they were gone by this evening.

My roommate doesn't like too much sweet so I leave out the white sugar, and reduce the chocolate chips. I also mash a banana and add it into the wet ingredients. I didn't have any baking soda last night so I substituted with 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and they turned out fine. 

I also always bake them for an extra minute or two. 14 is my magic number.

I just made these. We are snowed in and I wanted a treat. Didn't have any chocolate chips, so I increased the walnuts. Cut out the white sugar as well. Eleven minutes to perfection. Nice crisp-soft texture.

I made a mistake and followed the advice of other people and added the 1/2 c extra flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda.  The cookies did not spread out.  The batter was so dry they kept the shape of the scoop I used before I put them in the oven. I had to flatten them out near the end to get them into the round shape.  If you add more flour don't add much.  I don't know if you would want to add more baking soda. I'll have to try these again later on and see what works best.

These are great cookies and always get rave reviews. I read reviews and added the 1/2 c of flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda. I usually split the batter into two bowls, in one  I add the chocolate chips and the other raisins and nuts. This way everyone in the house is happy :-)

These cookies did turn out to be flavourful.  I made the suggested changes of adding 1/4 cup more flour, less salt and soda, but found they were quite high, hard and dry.  Next time I would not make any adjustments.  They were so-so.

While these tasted good, they were a flat, lacey mess. I added the extra flour like some reviewers suggested, but I won't try these again. I'll look for a recipe that holds up AND tastes good.

Did what others said and increased the flour by 1/2 cup and the baking soda by 1/2 tablespoon as well as cutting the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Delicious!

Way too salty! I followed exactly and the consisentacey was fine.  However, 1 tsp of salt is way too much. I wish I read the reviews before I made these.

These were definitely edible, though I expected more after the great reviews.  My brother even commented that they tasted like 'diet cookies'.  I will add less oats next time (maybe 1.5-2 cups) since I think that made them dry tasting and less sweet.  I had no problem with the shape, but did let the dough chill for about 2 hours and added more flour and baking soda, as others suggested.  I didn't cut the salt because I used unsalted butter.  Because they didn't flatten much, I had to cook them much longer (close to 20 minutes) and used wax paper.  I tried all the different cooking variations as another reviewer did, but none of them were long enough.  The tops and bottoms were a perfect color and never browned, so it was hard to gauge when I should take them out.  I don't mind a 'doughy' center, so I'm trying a batch now on lesser time.

I have made these gluten-free dairy-free nut-free and low sugar.

Here is my variations
Replace butter with ½ cup ghee and ½ cup applesauce. Replace white and brown sugar with 3/4 cup Turbinado sugar or sugar in the raw. I have used as little as 1/2 cup and they still taste good. I have replaced the wheat flour with oat flour before to make a gluten-free cookie and they turned out great. Rice flour did not work very well. I used 1 teaspoon baking soda & ½ teaspoon salt plus 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I always add an additional 1/2 oats. I like to use 1 cup chopped pecans instead of walnuts but I have also left the nuts out entirely  and  I have also substituted sunflower seeds. I prefer to make my cookies dairy-free by using 1 cup raisins instead of using chocolate.

I also baked at 375 degree F for 15 minutes

This recipe is amazing! I did change it up a little. I followed Fervent Frugal Foodie's advice and added 1/2 more flour and 1 full teaspoon of baking soda. I substituted the butter for margarine because I read somewhere that margarine makes it chewier instead of crispier. But remember, if you decide to use margarine, completely skip the salt. I baked it at 335 degrees F and about 18 minutes. I guess I was greedy and wanted to make them all giant cookies. Nonetheless, they're amazing! Thanks for the recipe!

Holy Cow! These cookies were ridiculously delicious. I made them with my students (we didn't get all the ingredients in or in the right order, but it didn't seem to matter) this afternoon as holiday treats for our secret santa endeavor and they were such a hit that we're planning to make them again after the holidays. Thanks!

These were alright, nothing special.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did use dark chocolate chips and chopped pecans instead of walnuts though.  The recipe made 51 cookies.  I'll be giving away a lot to "friends" at work.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I took 'Fervent Frugal Foodie's' advice on the flour and baking soda. Also omitted the salt as I used salted butter. Only change I made was that I dropped the temperature to 325 F as I have a convection oven. This is a great cookie batter. Definitely must try this one!

Pretty good. I did modify the recipe a bit, based off my own experience and other's reviews. I use unsalted butter so I left the salt as is. Used 1/4 cup more flour, added an extra 1/2 tsp baking soda, a dash of cinnamon, no nuts, and more chocolate chips (milk chocolate). I refrigerated the dough for about an hour.(I have 2 toddlers and a 6 month old baby. I have to do things in stages.) Baked at 325 for about 13 minutes for my oven. Turned out not too puffy, not too flat with the perfect crispy edges and chewy center. I will make these again. Hope this helps. :)

Was delicious just as described. Only substitution I made was using wheat flour in place of white flour. I topped it with ice cream and hot caramel. Yum!

These came out small and puffy but were chewy and delicious! I used twice as many chocolate chips and more chopped walnuts (I like lots of chunks). You probably could cut back on the salt a bit.

Awesome with following changes SO EASY! Mixed all in Kitchenaid SO QUICK! I used 1 3/4 cup flour and 1 tsp baking soda. First batch only 1/2 cup butter NO SPREADING 2nd batch (used white chocolate chips and cranberries) used full cup of butter and the cookies spread so if you want cookies to spread use full cup butter if prefer thicker cookie use 1/2 cup.  In both cases place dough in fridge for minimum 45 minutes for easier handling. I then just used my 2" cookie scoop! You have to try white chocolate and cranberry I dont even like cranberries and I couldn't stop eating these. NOTE*** Soak craisins in hot water for 10 minutes dry off with paper towel before adding to dough. Enjoy!

This is the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever tried. I followed the advise of others and kept mixing to a minimum. They didn't go flat and were nice and chewy. My husband even liked them and he doesn't eat sweets.

I took some of others suggestions such as using brown sugar and white sugar.  Creamed the butter with sugar for 4-5 min etc.  These cookies were just average in my opinion.  They weren't bad at all but didn't make me say "wow!" either....  I think I like the Beth's oatmeal cookies from this site the best.

First time to make this chewy cookie and followed this recipe to a tee. Will use 1/2 tsp less salt as others have suggested. Otherwise, my family n friends enjoyed it.

I made these cookies using our kitchenaid mixer, we didn't have an issue with flat cookies, they were perfect in size. We did however need to turn up our oven a bit and leave the cookies in a tad longer because they came out pretty under cooked at the original temp and time, but that could be our ovens fault! We tried not to overcook them because we definitely didn't want hard oatmeal cookies once they cooled. These were delicious. Chewy! I put in extra chips to make them more chocolately (another handful). I didn't think they were too salty, I think it gives it a nice added flavor to counterbalance all the sweet. Great recipe! thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe a few times now, altering it slightly each time with flour, soda and salt. I will not ever use it again. I will say that it is certainly chewy, but more of a huge square than a nice shaped/looking cookie you could put on a plate. Most disappointing.

Not bad, but not great either. The only changes I made were I used half the amount of salt and no nuts. They are chewy but lack flavor. Not very sweat either. I wished I'd added all the salt. That might have helped with the flavor issue. They did flatten out a bit in the oven. I used a cookie scooper. I even hand mixed the ingredients after mixing the butter, sugar, and eggs.

These were fantastic. I omitted the walnuts and halved the salt per another reviewer's recommendation. My daughter usually likes straight up chocolate chip. She asked me to bake again soon. I love seeing all of the variations from other reviewers. Looking forward to baking a batch for daughter's soccer team!

I followed the tips that was suggested by others here (more baking soda, more flour, less salt), but was slightly disappointed in the results. They are chewy-ish, but feel like they are a bit too tough. Next time around I will make sure I use less flour and see how it goes.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and didnt have any problems with cookies flattening out.  What I did was (using a electric mixer) mix sugars and butter and then mix in the eggs and vanilla.  Still using the electric mixer, I added the flour mixture slowly into the wet.  Then mixed by hand the chips, oatmeal and walnuts. I did not use a spoon to put cookies onto sheet.  I used my hands to form balls about 1 1/2".  A little sticky granted, but once you have the right amount, wash your hands and the water will make it easier to form the balls correctly.  The cookies were left on the cookie sheet lined with parchment paper for about 10 mins.  Also, because these were ball shaped, the cookies dont have dark or crispy edges, they simply have a beautiful golden colour all over, and bake throughout evenly.

This recipe is great. I've tried many cookie recipes throughout the years and always had some issues; not this time. I added 1/4 cup more flour and less sugar. Baking time ant temperature are just right. We all liked them very much and i will definitely make them again.

These are the best cookies that I have ever made!! I've made them several times and they'e worked every time. I followed the exact recipe, no additions, except I didn't put walnuts in them. My family begs me to make them all the time they were so good :) When I've made them I've never had the flat cookie or burnt cookie problem. They are just chewy and delicious. :D I also use old fashioned oats. It makes the cookies much fatter but harder to stir. Also, I add a little bit more chocolate chips to make it more chocolaty.

This is by far everyone's favourtie oatmeal chocolate chip cookie! I've now made it three times. Each time I also add diced up cranberries. Other times I've also added chopped walnuts or pecans. Wow! 
If you double the batch, you end up with about 80 cookies if the cookies balls are a little less that a tablespoon each - which I recommend because I bake my cookies at 350 degrees. Also, doesn't matter what pan I use (stone ware or regular cookie pan) it takes about 17 minutes - and then I let them cool Perfect every time!!

This is the recipe I use every time...everyone loves them! I skip the nuts and add peanut butter or butterscotch chips, just because i think they make every cookie better. Recently I used whole wheat flour because that's what I had handy and it made them even better! If you use a Silpat everyone will think you're a baking genius.

This is a great basic recipe. After reading the reviews, I cut the salt by 1/4 teaspoon, added 1/4 cup flour, used butter-flavored shortening so the cookies wouldn't spread too much and become flat, used 1 teaspoon each of baking soda and baking powder. I used 2 1/2 cups quick cooking oats instead of 3 cups because I was afraid the dough would be too thick with the shortening and the extra nuts and chocolate chips I like to add. These cookies came out perfectly chewy with just the right amount of crunch on the edge. They stayed soft even after they cooled. I will be adding this one to my go-to recipe box.

I was looking for a kind of healthy cookie and these turned out to be a great option! I made a few changes: substitute coconut oil for the butter, used only brown sugar (1 1/3 c), a little more flour (1.5 c), doubled the baking soda (1 tsp) and reduced the salt (1/4 tsp).  I used natural rolled oats (not the quick cooking ones) and liked them a lot! On the first batch I forgot the chocolate chips and we really liked them, so maybe sometimes I will leave those out on purpose.  Oh, and half of the recipe made 16 cookies, Thanks for the recipe!

I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could. These aren't pretty cookies, but they are definitely delicious! They also came together really quickly, and all of the ingredients are pantry staples, always a plus in my book. When I pulled them out of the oven they looked underbaked to me, but I left them on the cookie sheets as directed and they came out perfectly chewy.

Love it :) Super easy, this is our go-to cookie recipe. My 2 yr old helps me. So we are never 100% exact on the measurements but they still turn out AWESOME. CHANGES: we don't use nuts, I use about half of the salt it calls for. The first time I followed the recipe exactly (except the nuts) and the cookies were really good but after 2 or so I realized they were WAAAAAY too salty. (I do use UNSALTED butter in my baking, but they were just too too salty the way its written).

I would have given 5 stars but I found them sickly sweet. Yes, I know they are chocolate chip cookies but I'm betting the sugar could be halved. I didn't have any issues with them turning out flat,  in fact they were beautiful and for the first time I got exactly as many cookies as the recipe said I would.  Perfect baking time instructions as well.. I will do these again, with less sugar next time. This is a terrific cookie recipe. :)

These cookies were good.  I took the advice of others and increased the four 1/2 cup, baking soda 1/2 tsp, and used no salt since I used salted butter.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  I put the dough in the freezer for 10 min. I baked them on pampered chef baking stones.  I heated the stones before putting the cookie dough on them.  I baked at 335 for 12 min then let them sit on the stone for 5 min before moving them to a cooling rack.  These cookies did not spread at all with the above modifications.  I had to flatten them down about half way through the baking time.  The taste is good.  I wouldn't say they are fantastic, but I will make them again.

A favourite in our house. One suggestion my mom gave me and it made a world of difference....cut the brown sugar to half cup and add a package of vanilla pudding mix. Makes the cookies chewy and divine!! Enjoy ;)

Delicious cookies.... I just put a tad less sugar in than the recipe called for as I usually find cookie recipes too sweet. Used one and a quarter cups and they came out great.

Excellent recipe, super quick and easy! :) Can easily be changed up by adding in your own favorites such as raisins, almonds etc. I like to crush up candy bars and mix them in instead of chocolate chips. Freeze the chocolate bars then put them in a ziploc and beat them up with a rolling pin before adding them.

This was an okay recipe, but the flavors just didn't "wow" me. The cookies seemed bland and just average. By all means I'm not a professional but in the eyes of an avid baker, they just were not worth the calories.

These cookies were really good! My family loved them! However the cooking was a little bit confusing. After twelve minutes, the cookies looked wet and a bit doughy still. I didn't realize that that is what they were supposed to look like and ended up being cooked just fine! For anyone who runs into this problem too, don't worry, they turned out really good!

Wayyyy salty! You could definitely cut out the salt altogether and I actually experimented with this recipe and had my friends as taste testers. You can try substituting the chocolate chips with butterscotch chips, the flavors go with the oatmeal better. People liked mine better when I made this substitution also try cutting the butter down with applesauce.

Terrific cookies! Easy to fix, I made a few minor changes...as others suggested I upped the baking soda to 1 tsp., flour to 1 1/2 cups and I also used 1/2 and 1/2 white and whole wheat flour (just to get a little whole grain) and to get my uber-picky 8 year old daughter to be more likely to try them, I increased the chocolate bits to 1 1/2 cups. I really think they would have turned out fine with the original amount of flour though. I think if you follow the recipe directions closely they should turn out as expected. I wonder if some of those that had problems didn't cream the butter and sugars well enough?...I even accidentally put the salt in with the butter-sugar mixture and it didn't hurt a thing. Oh, couple of tips...keep dough heaped up on pan, don't flatten it out any, and do NOT over-bake! The cookies will set up after taking out of the oven. 12 minutes worked for me. My daughter is one of the pickiest eaters this side of the Mississippi River and she ate 4 at one time, and would have had more if I'd let her! My husband raved as well. I think this one is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

Made a half batch of these, and I've really loved them. They're not flat, the right amount of puffy and chewy, but I feel like something's missing. There's no pizzazz in this recipe. It's a crowd-pleaser, for sure, but it's not quite perfect.

I tried this recipe by only omitting the nuts, and it was fantastic. The cookies were soft, but chewy with just the right amount of oats. I can't tell if I enjoy eating the batter (I know, raw eggs...) or the warm cookies more! Thanks for the recipe :)

Delicious! the dough is delicious and addicting, too!seriously, i could eat the whole bowl of just dough! I took the advice in the comments and I added 1/2 cup more flour,
 1 teaspoon baking soda instead of 1/2 tsp.,
 and baked 13 min. at 335 degrees
 farenheight.I decreased the salt to
 1/2 tsp. because I used salted butter .

You really have to love walnuts to like this recipe. The texture was perfect, but I thought that the walnuts were too overpowering and not enough chocolate chips.

This is perfect.  Just do not press down the cookie before cooking it.  Make it exactly as it says and leave it into a round heap on the cookie sheet. Ovens vary, so like mine, you may need a bit more cooking time, but that's all.  It will bake perfectly into an adorable cookie.  I promise!

This was a pretty good base, but I had to change a few things. I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, and I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, (they had no flavor otherwise). I also added 1 cup of raisins and omitted the chocolate chips and the nuts, (only because I was out)! They did come out chewy and yummy, but you have to really watch the cooking time, cuz even slightly over-cooked and you'll have a hard cookie on you hands. Also, if they're coming out flat, it may be due to over-mixing. Thanks for the recipe!

Used 1 3/4 cup flour, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp salt (used salted butter).  Also reduced oats to 2 cups (because I ran out).  Turned out AWESOME!!!!!   Cookie is halfway between a chocolate chip cookie and an oatmeal cookie, rather than being an oatmeal cookie with chocolate chips.  Tried baking on a baking stone that wasn't preheated - didn't work at all.  Cookies spread out a lot.  Used a light colored pan (not a dark non-stick pan) and the cookies turned out wonderfully after about 11 minutes at about 325°, or maybe a little over that temp (but who knows how accurate my oven is).  Tried chilling the dough, but that only seems to make the baking time take longer.  Turns out just as good without chilling the dough.  Five star rating if you make it my way, no idea if you make it as originally recipe calls for.

Really great recipe, they came out very chewy.  I left out the chocolate and walnuts and they were still a BIG hit!  This is the first time I have baked cookies that came out this chewy.  Definately going to make these again.

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I haver ever used. I now use it as a base for all kinds of cookies but adding in dried fruit/berries & changing the nut. The family favorite is cherry almond. Yum! I always have some in the freezer waiting to be popped in the oven.

I made these today, for the 2nd time and I just don't get it - my kids and hubby love them but I find them bland and almost tasteless (normally I enjoy oatmeal cookies too).  I chilled the dough for 2 hrs before baking and I had no problems with them spreading. The batter stuck together well and I even pressed them down lightly before baking. I added the extra 1/2 C. flour, extra baking soda and also cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp. To lower the fat I used 2/3 C. butter and 1/3 applesauce. I gave it 4 stars because everyone else enjoyed them, but I don't think I will make them again.

Amazing!! My kids are not much on walnuts so we just added more chocolate chips. Not only do my kids ask for them but my HUSBAND asks for them!! They are now a family FAVORITE!! Everyone actually asks for these now instead of Chocolate chip cookies, so hey we made a switch for a healthier option lol THANK YOU for this recipe!!

These cookies turned out fantastic!! Chewy and tasty...I probably did not put the amount of salt in as recipe said as I usually just add what I think.  I also substituted a 1/4 c of the flour with Kamut flour.  Did NOT change the flavour at all.  Both kids and Husband loved them....Definitely will make them again.  
PS...They did NOT go flat!

Very good cookies! I used to eat these growing up, we called them cowboy cookies. Followed advice from other reviewers, increased flour and baking soda and cut salt in half...perfect and delicious. Mine didn't spread at all when I baked them. I refrigerated the dough for 30 minutes before scooping them onto trays and it worked beautifully. They were thick and soft and chewy. Yummy! Thanks for this recipe!

I have made these about 10 times now...but I add Chia seeds!  The extra crunch is loved my my family and friends and they ask for them to be baked nonstop!  About to make another batch right now.  Just a T or more will do it:)  I never measure my salt, so what looks right seems to be the key...never have them be too salty yet!

This is the best base oatmeal cookie recipe I have tried to date! I used sweet spices in mine (to taste) because that is how our family likes our oatmeal cookies. I also used dark chocolate covered raisins, and they were great! But I think you could use any combination of add-ins (raisins, cranberries, spices, and various flavors of chocolate chips/chunks) and they would be delicious. It is the way the rest of the cookie bakes up that makes them fantastic! Happy baking! :)

Yum! I followed the recipe as written and they are delicious!  I did allow my cookie sheets to cool in between batches and kept the dough in the fridge; I had no problems with spreading.  This is my 1st attempt at oatmeal cookies...and it won't be my last!  :-)

I took the advice of others and added more flour and baking soda and cut down on the salt. I also added a 1/4 more butter and that made them the consistency that I like in my cookies.

I used 1 1/2 C of Brown sugar no white sugar, 1 1/2 C flour, 2 C oats, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 egg, a dash of salt, unsalted butter. I changed this recipe quite a bit got great cookies I like the brown sugar better since I didn't use white sugar I only used 1 tsp of vanilla. I think anymore oats would have made these way to crispy I like my cookies chewy they baked up great, a  crisp edge chewy inside and done inside. Baked at 350 for 10-12 min. my oven bakes hot. I only gave 3 stars since I changed this recipe up so much. I added not quite a cup of chocolate chips no nuts I can't have nuts. Anymore than 3/4 C choc. chips would have been too much. the cookies have plenty of chocolate chips throughout. Great starting point recipe I've lost my go to recipe for oatmeal cookies this with all my changes is now my new one. Play with it and make it your own. Oh also my cookies didn't flatten and I didn't have to put the mix in the fridge it's very cold in OH my kitchen is cool. The recipe without changes I'd call Oatmeal Crisp Cookies since I think they would be very crispy and flatter. Just my opinion I've made oatmeal crisps this sounds very much like that recipe. I made all my changes from reading all the other comments thanks everyone.

I loved this recipe! Instead of white flour, I substituted whole wheat flour.  I didn't have any baking soda, so I substituted 3 tsp of baking powder instead, also adding 1/2 cup vanilla yorgurt, and a dash of nutmeg. These cookies were fluffy and soft and so good to eat!@! Delish!!

They turned out great; in-laws loved them.  I baked them for 10 mins and they were nice - soft & chewy.  Really really recommend this recipe!  I added a touch of cinnamon - personal taste.  Would work well with raisins instead of chocolate chips too.

I just finished making these!!
Amaaazing! Delicious! Chewy! and just Fantastic!

I did however follow another users advice by adding 1/2 more cup of flour, reducing salt by half and adding 1tsp baking soda instead to 1/2.

and from my side, i did add 1tsp of cinnamon! 
The fragrance was just wonderful all over the kitchen. And it just adds this very small hint of cinnamon you cannot really taste it but it just makes the smell wonderful.
Recommend it all the way if you want to add some healthy oatmeals to your tasty sweet snacks!

These were/are fab. I love the fact that they actually stay soft once cooked and stored - awesome. The only thing was I had to cook mine almost 15-20 minutes- I think that may be because I used heaping 2 tablespoon and put them in balls instead of plops like the recipe says. Oh well- still super good!!

I've made these and a few variations of this recipe, many times.  Hubby & I love them.  I mix the oatmeal, chocolate chips and dried cranberries (or cherries) in by hand then refrigerate the mixture before scooping onto my cookie sheet. This eliminates the flattening out, too.

I did what several people suggested adding 1/4 cup more flour less salt and more  baking soda. The cookies were too floury tasting,not very sweet,even with added dried cranberries. They did not spread out at all. Finally, on subsequent pans I pressed on them a bit. Disappointing recipe. Had hoped for fabulous as some promised. Would not make again.

As the original recipe reads, it is pretty good.  The flavor is nice, but my cookies did come out very flat.  In fact I  made cookie bars out of the remaining batter. I would agree with other users by increasing the amount of flour by 1/2 cup and not over mix.  I think over mixing caused my issues.

This is an absolutely excellent recipe. I make this with Earth Balance spread instead of butter since my daughter has a dairy allergy.  I have also made them with butter and have to say that they are actually even better with the earth balance though the recipe is just fantastic as written!  Highly recommended!

Made it exactly as written and I'm glad I did!  They are a flatter cookie that is light and chewy with a slightly crispy edge.  The flavour and texture is great!  I would think adding more flour would make them more dense.

The only thing I changed in this recipe is the amount of salt I added. I had a feeling 1 tsp would be too much so I just added a couple of quick shakes. Other than that, I followed the recipe with no adjustments and the result was really great. These are soft and chewy and have a great flavour. I used an ice cream scoop to place my cookies on the baking sheet and ended up with 32 cookies.

Okay so aside from having to alter the recipe they weren't to bad. I put 1 3/4c flour rather than 1 1/4c, also I put 1 teaspoon of baking soda rather than 1/2 and I left out the salt and nuts. rather than dropping them I rolled them into (rather large) balls and baked them for 14mins rather than 12 to adjust for the the size (I like my cookies big and puffy rather than small and flat). They turned out not to bad, the outside was crunchy, not from being over cooked but from the way the recipe is I suppose. the inside was still nice and chewy but that might change after they cool completely. If I use this recipe again I will be using less chocolate chips as I found there were just way to many in this recipe after they were baked.

Soooooo good!  Didn't modify much. Just did bag of chocolate chips and omitted nuts.  When adding in dry ingredients stir in with spoon only until all JUST mixed in. Then same with the oats and chocolate chips. Don't over mix.  My cookie sheets happened to be ice cold so perhaps that helped. Baked for 12 minutes at 335 and then watched for a couple of minutes longer. Let sit 5 minutes. I could eat an entire dozen right now!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Definitely my top choice for oatmeal!

I can't give 5 stars to this receipe since I altered it quite a bit as suggested by other users. I increased the flour to 1.5 cups, reduced salt to 1/2 tsp. and to cut some of the fat, replaced 1/4 cup of the butter with applesauce. I also used old fashioned oats which probably was the biggest alteration. I cooled the dough for 10 mins in the fridge before I baked and then rolled it into balls before baking. I didn't have any trouble with flattening, in fact, I wish they were flatter! I also split the batch into half choc. chip/walnut and the other was cranberry/orange (added clementine zest). Good but not my forever recipe.

I usually read some reviews before trying a recipe. I didn't this time but really should've. I made them as listed and they are way too salty. Ugh! I was so looking forward to some good Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies. Might try again with some of the suggested changes.

I decreased the amount of oats by half a cup, and upped the amount of chocolate chips by half a cup.  Could have probably even used more chocolate chips.

These cookies are yummy. For some reason, a couple of my cookies flattened out while baking but the others remained in the shape of dough balls! They baked nicely though and taste really good. Not like a normal oatmeal cookie - I can't quite pinpoint what it is that makes them different, but I do like them and will definitely make again, maybe with a few modifications!

I only rated this recipe 3 stars because I was wanting a cookie that flattened and since everyone was saying they did I figured I'd try it out but my cookies stayed  round mounds instead of flattening.  The taste of the cookie was good.  It seems no matter which recipe I try I can not get my cookies to flatten!  Very frustrating!

Just made these awesome cookies... When I mentioned that I would be making oatmeal chocolate chip cookies instead of the traditional chocolate chip cookies, my husband grumbled a little, but he was pleasantly surprised. A few people mentioned a great tip: add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 cup of flour to prevent them from coming out flat. The cookies do come out of the oven looking a little pale on top, but once they're cool, they look great!

Santa (aka my husband) requested oatmeal chocolate chip cookies this year. He absolutely raved about these. I took some to my sister in law's on Christmas Day and she and her daughter both loved them as well. They were a little salty to me but that may have been my fault. I measured over the bowl and I think I got a bit too much. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. My husband demanded I save this recipe so j will definitely be making these again :)

Made this recipe, making the changes recommended.  I increased the flour to 1 3/4C, 1 tsp baking soda and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I used one cup of milk chocolate chips, 1/2C white chocolate chips, and added a can of tart cherries.  The cook time ended up being 15 minutes a batch.  They are super soft and delicious!  May consider dark chocolate chunks and cherries or craisins next time.

I love these cookies and so does my family. I made the recipe exactly the way it says and they turned out perfectly. If you over mix the dough you will get flat cookies. Other than that LOVE IT!!! will try making it with applesauce for some healthier cookies. Thanks for the amazing recipe.

My siblings and I all LOVE this type of cookie! I am not a master chef, although you would think I am when I used this recipe! My cookies were not flat although, I tend to mix things until all the lumps are out (I'm a bit of a perfectionist in that manner).  I'm keeping this one.  I did what many reviewers suggested by lessening the salt and increasing the flower.

This recipe is PERFECT!  The only change I made, after reading other reviews, was to use 1 3/4 cup of flour.  I also added shredded coconut, my favorite ingredient in oatmeal cookies!  But this will forever be my go to recipe for oatmeal cookies!  :)

This recipe worked very well. Besides the fact that I only creamed 1/2 cup of butter into the recipe and then had to go back and melt and mix in the other 1/2 cup after all the ingredients were already mixed in. But it still worked out fine.

If you like peanut butter, add a cup of it to the recipe and bake for an extra minute.

OMG - I added 2 Tbs of all natural peanut butter and some white chocolate chips to the recipe - these are buttery delicious goodness! (I added the 1/2 C flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, & reduced the salt as others had recommended. I also increased the temp to 350, since these were not cooking so well in my oven at 325).

Great recipe and I actually loved the saltiness of it!  Usually oatmeal cookies are too sweet for me.  These were very good and buttery.  In place of walnuts and chocolate chips I added 2 cups raisins.  My dad and hubby kept raving and mom was impressed with how quick they were to make.  Definitely a keeper!

Maybe I'm the only one, but thru trial and error over the years, I found the way to keep the cookies (all cookies) full and not flat, is to use almost cold butter. Yes it takes longer to mix the sugar in, but well worth it. If you use butter that is too room temp, the butter is runny, and when you put it in the oven, it liquifies almost. Chunky semi-cold butter works great! Hope this helps some who want to test it.

Flat undercooked cookie as written. Needs more leavening (baking soda) and less fat (butter,) Needs serious tweaking.

I followed the recipe exactly, and added 1/2 cup of M&Ms and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.

Very chewy and yummy... I think it can be sweeter tho.  Next time, I think I'll try adding more sugar.

I think the proportions on this recipe are all wrong. For a whole cup of butter(2 sticks), there isn't enough flour. As is, you end up with a flat greasy mess! You need to add up to another whole cup of flour and a bit more baking soda to get them to rise up and be puffy like a cookie should be. They were not the most flavorful either. Something is missing....

easy tasty recipe. Perfect for oats lovers. I added a mix of semi sweet chocolate chips and some milk chocolate chunks. Mine seemed to be still raw after 12 min of baking especially at the bottom, so I kept it for another 2 mins and it was perfect after the 5 mins rest.

Recipe is similar to 'Best Chocolate Chip cookie' in AllRecipes, except for the extra added oatmeal and lesser white sugar. The cookies turned out better than I expected! Really chewy, really tasty. I am able to make ~50 pieces of this cookie by halfing all the measurements in the recipe. Must try!

These were amazing.  My husband is not a raver about cookies, but he raved about these!

They did spread a tiny bit too much, so I'll refrigerate before baking next time.

Yummy! After reading other reviews I added 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder and refrigerated the dough after mixing so they wouldn't be flat. To add my own special touch I used big chunky chocolate chips,added 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, added zest from 3/4 of an orange and 1 tsp cinnamon. A complete success!!

I just tried this recipe yesterday and was very pleased.  The cookie doesn't hold together well unless you refrigerate it for awhile after they come out of the oven.  Another reviewer had suggested this.  I also cut back a little on the white sugar , changed the baking soda to 1 teaspoon and 1/2 t of salt as was suggested.  This is a keeper.

The best cookie I have ever made!  (with a few changes) After reading other reviews I used unsalted butter, 1/2tsp salt, 1-3/4 c flour and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Baked at 335deg for 12 min, & let cool for 5 on the cookie sheet just like the recipe said.  They are the perfect Oatmeal chocolate chip cookie -- chewy & delicious!

I made these but they did not level at all and kind of dry and heavy.   I followed the directions for mixing exactly.  I did, however, double the recipe, but not the walnuts nor the baking soda, and only increased the salt by half.  After the first few trays, I increased the temp to 350 to make  sure they were even cooking, because that is how little they changed.  I would try them again, since overall it is a fairly common recipe, but I would like them with more chocolate chips (which are barely detectable) and 'chewy" - which is why I used this recipe - so I am hoping to figure out how to make them a little softer.

I tried this recipe last weekend.  It is the best cookie EVER.  I added a few raisins because I like raisins.  The cookie was crunchy and chewy all at the same time.  I couldn't understand the reviews that said this cookie was the worst ever.  These people probably made a few mistakes in their measurements or something.  I recommend this recipe to any cookie lover.  I am definitely storing this recipe in my cookbook.

I followed the suggestions of others to add flour and baking soda.  First time I made them and they were wonderful.

I followed the 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt rule, and these turned out great.  I also used old fashioned oatmeal, and increased the chips by 2, using milk chocolate and butterscotch chips.  WIN!!!

Really good cookie. Added a bit more oats, left out the nuts and added raisins. Putting the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes helps the cookies from spreading in the oven. I rolled the dough into balls about the size of golf balls and then flattened them with my fingers. This helped to keep them a uniform size. Will be making these again this weekend, they are that good.

these cookies are amazing. I used smart balance butter which is half real butter and half canola oil to cut down on some of the fat. The salt in the recipe really comes through to give that sweet/salty taste. I also used mini- chocolate chips because that's what I had. My husband and my family ate all of them in one night! I will definately make these again ASAP!

all I can say is...BEAUTIFUL! I halved the recipe (because it's just me and my friend) and I only put in half the amount of sugar requried, and the result was that I could taste the cookie sooooo much more! Really a delicious cookie :)

I've made this recipe with my niece and we both agree that it is an excellent cookie. We decided to pulverized old fashioned oats because we did not have enough quick-cooking oats and the they turned out great. This is an easy recipe to make with kids and the results are reliably good.

I found this recipe to be super heavy on the salt so I added just a pinch and it turned out to be beautiful! I also added 1/3c raisins and 1/4c of Wheat Germ and it was the perfect (healthy) cookie!!!

Overall, these cookies were 'just okay'!  I followed the entire recipe including directions- however, they came out incredibly dry!! I was slightly disappointed due to them not turning out "chewy" or "moist".  I brought them to a Thanksgiving Feast a few people tried them- overall, you can tell they were NOT a hit....when, all of the goodies were being eaten except the cookies. :(

This is a fantastic cookie.  I modified by using JulesAM's suggestions AND I added a cup of butterscotch chips as well.  They cooked beautifully and I'm no pro.  I took them to work and they were absolutely inhaled.  :o)  Success.

Cookies turned out perfect!  They are the best cookies I've ever made!  I used the tips in the reviews of adding 1/2 c. more flour, 1/2 tsp more baking soda & half the amount of salt.  Creamed butter & sugar together until fluffy, then added eggs & vanilla.  I sifted the dry ingredients into the mixture & stirred until just incorporated, then folded in chocolate chips, walnuts and oats.  I made rather large cookies & cooked for approx. 16 minutes.  They are soft, chewy & delicious!!!!!

This is great, they take about 15-16 minutes in my oven and I also use en extra 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. I do not use the walnuts, but add in more chocolate chips. They come out very soft and delicious.

These cookies are so yummy and easy to make. I brought them to work one day, and everyone loved them. Follow other reviews suggestions about increasing the flour and baking soda, you will have yummy cookies in 1hour. To make them a little bit more healthy, I only used half of the brown sugar and white sugar, and substituted 1/2 of the  flour with 1/2 cup of wheat flour.

These are great! I only put 1 stick of butter in and substituted apple sauce w a bit of oil (3/1 ratio) for the other 1/2. I also added some flour because the batter just seemed a bit too runny. They were nice and moist, somewhat cake-like, and not flat and crispy. Very good.

I have made this recipe three times now and realized that I have only been using 1 stick of butter instead of a cup which would be two sticks and my cookies come out perfect so maybe that is a typo in the recipe. This time I am going to use a cup of toffee bars leftover from halloween instead of chocolate chips!

Very good; the changes mentioned by others are necessary: add 1/2 c flour (although if you scoop flour from the container the amt in the recipe will probably be right.  Scooping packs flour and you end up with more.  If you stir flour and spoon into the measuring cup you will have to add the 1/2 cup.)  Use 1 tsp soda and only 1/2 tsp salt if using salted butter.  I found that these brown faster on a cookie sheet lined with parchment than on a silpat mat; let stand 5 min after baking on silpat, only 2 to 2.5 minutes on parchment.
This is a very good basic chewy oatmeal cookie and can be varied with any kind of chips, nuts, or dried fruit.

OMG!! I just saw this recipe the other day and did not have any butter nor vanilla.  So I subsituded butter with applesauce, and vanilla with a teaspoon of lemon zest and and 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice.  I added nutmeg and cinnimon andIt turned out really really great.  I also used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate.
Just heavenly and yummy.

I went to my sister in law's house and she gave me some oatmeal chocolate chip cookies she made from a box so it inspired me to make them from scratch. I followed the other reviews and put in 1/4 more flower and /14 more baking powder (didn't have any baking soda) and they came out great. I wanted to make larger cookies so I let these cook for at-least 14 minutes and they came out chewy and were full of flavor. THanks so much.

This recipe turned out beautifully! I also made the suggested changes, flour to 1 3/4 cup, baking soda to 1 teaspoon and salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I made them in large tablespoon fulls and onto a greased cookie sheet. I baked them at 335 degrees for about 14 minutes. I started out at 8 minutes, checked them and then added 2 minutes each time they didn't seem done. When they were done I let them sit for a few minutes before I took them off the cookie sheet. Perfect perfect cookies, picture perfect!

I don't bake cookies a lot, however, I made these for my 5 young grandkids and they went absolutely crazy over them.  I do not believe they ever ate any other cookie that enthusiastically.  They did not last long!

Great cookie. I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (1/2 cup) in place of br sugar and no nuts. Increased baking time to 20 min .  Perfect! My husband loved them. I like them a little crispier.

I just baked these cookies and I have to say they are very good.  I don't really understand why all the changes with flour, salt, soda etc...  I followed the recipe and it has worked perfect.  You want your butter cold and just starting to soften.  I used regular rolled oats which may have made a difference in the runnyness some had problems with.  As far as the bland complaint, it is an oatmeal cookie so it is more of a wholesome nutty flavor.  I do not like cinnamon in my chocolate and nothing worse than biting into an oatmeal cookie that has what you think is chocolate chips to find it's actually raisins.  That being said, you could add more vanilla and even cherries would be great.  Anything to your taste actually.  Great basic oatmeal cookie recipe.  Thank you for posting it.

I substituted the flour for spelt flour (and a little oat flour), added a little xantham gum powder (to help the non-gluten flours); chips for dark chocolate chips. THEY'RE AWESOME! Only issue was cooking time. They took about 20 mins. at 325 degrees. I don't know why - maybe the different flour I used...? Next time I'd probably increase the flour and decrease the sugar. Hearty - Yum!

In this recipe I added a half cup more flour and used a suggustion of doing a half stick of butter and a 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I will probably use the regular recipe next time... My cookies are too flour tasting and won't spread.

Really good cookies. I over cooked the first 2 batches thinking they weren't done. The last batch I cooked according to recipe and they turned out great! Follow the recipe! Even if they don't look done in the oven, they will finish cooking on the pan for 5 min. I had to use whole wheat flour since i was out of all purpose. Still turned out pretty good.

Used the extra flour and soda as previous reviews suggested. Did not refrigerate.... Rolled into balls before placing in oven, they Came out soo fluffy first round I had to smoosh all the others down so they actually looked like cookies and not some weird brownie thing... Won't be using the extra flour or soda next go around. I kept the 1 tsp of salt and I think they taste yummy- rich! Soft and chewy just like their name describes! Reminds me of the central market cookies

These were pretty good. I halved the recipe, omitted the walnuts and salt, used Smart Balance instead of butter, and added 1/2 a mashed banana. I added a bit more flour and baking soda as per the reviews, but the dough seemed a bit dry and needed to add a tiny bit of (soy) milk to make it more balanced. I had no problems with spreading and baked them a bit longer than suggested since I made large cookies. Actually my favorite part of the recipe is the hint of banana that I added- it's a really nice touch. In fact, I wouldn't make these without the added banana. Overall, I enjoyed them and would make them again.

Delicious!  The whole family loved them.  I didn't have quick cooking oats so I took old fashioned and ran them through the blender for a bit to make them smaller.

My 3 year old and I had a lot of fun making these.  And the whole family enjoyed eating them.  They were very good.  However, our favorite chocolate chip recipe is still Nestle Toll house's, and our favorite oatmeal cookie recipe is still Nestle Toll house's 'oatmeal scotchies' recipe.  I think if I make these again I will add 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and add some butter scotch chips to better suit our taste. But this is a great recipe as is.  Thanks for sharing!

loved these. I don't like walnuts, but did add milk chocolate chips instead.

The only thing I changed was the amount of flour 2 cups instead of 1 1/4 and added about 3/4 bag of milk choc chips.
I wanted more of a cookie than a plain flat oatmeal cookie. 
I did refrigerate the dough for 2 hours as someone recommended and used a tablespoon per cookie. 

My brother doesn't like oatmeal, but definitely gobbled these up while still hot!

Followed recipe exactly and put in freezer overnight. Perhaps this isn't a good dough to freeze, because these ended up flat and dry. Tried playing around with oven temperature, but no good.

Absolutely phenomenal. The best cookie I've ever made. I added and extra half cup of flour as many suggested. I opted for larger cookies and thus needed to do them for about 13-14 minutes in the oven, but the advice to leave on the cookie sheet for five minutes before moving to the cooling rack is paramount. I refrigerated the dough while I was waiting for the first half of the batch to bake, but did not refrigerate for a separate half hour. I took them to a group picnic and they FLEW. My partner was mad when I came home without leftovers.

A definite winner with my four kids. I've made these cookies several times according to the recipe (well, okay I do omit the walnuts per my kids' requests and put dough in fridge to chill for about and hour before baking) and they turn out perfect. I get about 42 cookies (heaping teaspoon, rolled in ball and slightly smushed down). Last made a batch 24 hours ago and only two left now.

These are very good, soft cookies. I made them even better by replacing 1/2 of the butter with peanut butter (1 stick of butter plus 1/2 c. peanut butter). Next time, I'll even put more peanut butter than that!

I am sure the recipe would be fantastic as it is, but I don't usually bake with butter. I substituted Crisco, halved the salt and added an extra half tsp of baking soda. I also only used 2.5 cups of oats and I do NOT like nuts in my cookies. They are chewy in the middle with just enough crunch on the outside. I added m&ms, choco chips or raisins. All worked very well! Delicious!

Fantastic recipe. I have made this as is over 30 times as well as with variations. My boyfriend likes a less crispy cookie/more healthy one so I will add a mashed banana or a small container of apple sauce(snack size for kids lunches) and it creates a really nice "puffy" cookie too! Great work!

This recipe was so good! It also made me feel better that there was so much oatmeal in it, as well as walnuts- maybe a titch more healthy??! :)

My family loved it. I do think it needs less oats and more chocolate chips. Other than that, they're pretty good. :D

While the dough tasted fantastic, the cookies came out less than optimal, though I followed the recipe precisely.  I used silpats, but they spread out all over so that they were quite thin.  That's never happened to me before with silpats and it's not how I like my cookies...I'd rather they were thicker with more substance.

Like others, I do 1 3/4 c. flour, and 3/4 tsp. baking soda, plus 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I leave out the walnuts, but use 1/2 c. dessicated coconut instead. Everyone loves them!

This is a very good oatmeal cookie.  Excellent texture and color.  I did not vary the recipe except I used milk chocolate morsels as the store was out of semi-sweet.  These have a slightly more salty taste, more vanilla flavor, and the buttery flavor is prominent.  I have tasted what I consider slightly better Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, hence the four rating.

I took the suggestion and added 1/2 cup more of flour and 1/2 tsp more of baking soda. Added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 1/2 milk chocolate chips instead of walnuts and used mini whole grain oats. I didn't have a baking sheet so I turned the oven down to 300 degrees and used aluminum foil - 12 minutes was PERFECTION. They don't expand or flatten so put them on the foil in the shape you want them to come out. Phenom - and the boyfriend loved them too!

These are delicious!  I made half the recipe, following everything exactly and they turned out great!  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and instead of walnuts I used Skor toffee bits (about 1/3 cup).  They took about 14 minutes to bake and came out soft and chewy.  Perfect texture for an oatmeal cookie!

Myself and my family love these cookies. They are moist and chewy. I substitute whole wheat flour and pecans and after I bake them I let them rest on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes before cooling on a rack. They are delicious. I have also used Splenda for the sugar on a few batches. Either way they are great.

Perfect! crunchy on the edges and chewy in the center.  The key is to not work the dough too much, chill and not over bake. Thanks, great cookies!

I was sooo excited to make these as I'm a huge oats fanatic! I found that my wet ingredients were not thick enough and I did take the suggestion of adding the extra flour and baking soda and reducing salt. My cookies are Airy like and aren't solid all over. They are airy or holey all over and I find it weird! I just bought some like this at a deli and they were perfect so I looked this up and went for it. I must say mine are nothing like theirs in consistency as well as taste. I think most cookies in this house don't turn out well. I think it's the overall humidity in the kitchen itself. I think it's ventilation and humidity. So much for that! They weren't terrible, just weird.

These came out delicious...I made a few changes and I'm glad that I did.  I didnt want 42 cookies so I decreased the recipe down to 21 cookies and the measurements were spot on.  I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown sugar and I used roasted, salted almonds instead of walnuts.  I crushed the almonds in a plastic bag using a meat mallet.  Finally, instead of butter I used a crisco butter flavored baking stick and for chocolate I used a Russell Stover chocolate bunny left from easter that I cut up into chunks.  The batter seemed dry but I went with it and shaped the cookies into balls and then placed them on the cookie sheet to bake...they were PERFECT!!!

Wow, these were amazing! Fantastic recipe - I did make the suggested changes with the soda + flour... I hate to change a recipe, but those were minor changes and I think it made the cookies perfect... and these cookies are just to die for. I took them out of the oven a bit ago and they were the perfect texture - soft and chewy! BIG time YUM! :D

I like to add cinnamon and substitute coconut for the walnuts but I have made them according to the recipe as well and they are great either way! They also freeze well which is great since this recipes is for a rather large batch.

I made these over the weekend and they were a HUGE hit. I did add extra baking soda and flour as suggested by others. And also I recommend refrigerating the dough for atleast an hour....you get a better consistency this way. Overall, I'm very happy with the results and will defy be making these again!

Love this cookie, make it with white chocolate. Handy tip..when the batter is combined, put into large freezer bag and squeeze together. Then put onto parchment paper and roll out with parchment paper on top, then take a cookie cutter and cut equal cookies...my boss asked me the other day if they were store bought cookies, they were all so even....

These were okay but really needed the fridge time to hold together and not get too flat in the oven. Nice buttery taste but not much 'body' to the dough. More like sweet buttery oats but maybe that is what the baker was looking for.

Very yummy but it took me a little while to find the perfect size to put on the cookie sheet. I took the suggestions from the comments below about the different amounts of flour and baking powder and they turned out great!

I usually do NOT like oatmeal cookies. These were awesome. I only baked them for 11 min, omitted the nuts and made them slightly smaller than a tablespoon.

Really good cokies. I had to modify it quite a bit for what I had on hand. I used Aunt Jemima pancake mix instead of the dry ingredients, I used all white sugar (actually a splenda/sugar mix) and a couple tablespoons of maple syrup because I didn't have brown sugar or molasses and left out the walnuts. But they turned out very yummy. I'm definitely saving the recipe.

I really love flat cookies (vs. fluffy) and that's what I was hoping for with this recipe. Mine didn't turn out flat at all, but they were pretty delicious and the chewy texture was great. They got rave reviews from my coworkers.

This is the perfect starter recipe, I made 5 dozen and I could have made at least 8, they all would have been gone!  I did tweak these as I like more puffy cake like cookies, I didn't like the others reduce the baking powder, but I did reduce the salt to about half.  I also added about a cup of extra flour.  They came out WONDERFUL!  This is one of those go to recipes that I will keep forever!

These are sooo good with the modifiers that most people suggested:  extra 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda and less salt by 1/2 teaspoon.  I used raisins instead of walnuts, about 1,1/2 cups to 2 cups of raisins.  It is really really good with the raisins and chocolate chips.

I thought this recipe was perfect, the only change I made was I used crisco since I had very little butter. I split the batch in half and added raisin to one and mini chocolate chips to the other. They tasted great and they were not flat.

I followed the suggestion of increasing the flour and baking soda / decreasing the salt. I also used a full bag of chocolate chips. Great cookies!!! Soft & chewy. Good texture. Next time I think I may add a bit of cinnamon. I only gave it 4 start because the original recipe had to be altered, but with the alterations - 5 stars!

I only gave it four because of the frequency of reviews with flat hard cookies and i went right ahead and used the increases as most did- 1 tsp baking soda and 1 1/2 cups flour - i omitted salt all together because i used salted butter. The outcome was great- chewy, oaty chocolaty heaven. I baked other recipes listed in this catagory that dont measure up to these ones at all!

I just took my first batch out the oven and the cookies taste amazing ! I'm only 24 and don't have too much experience with baking, you I've been back and fourth about making them. This morning I finally got the courage and I'm glad i did! I used others suggestions and used 1 1/2 flour, and 1tsb baking soda. I omitted the salt since i used salted butter and added 2tsb cinnomon. I had no walnuts so i stuck with just ghirardelli chocolate chips. So good ! Even my 4 year old likes them !

i left out the salt and the vanilla(i was out). added 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 tsp more baking soda, left out nuts, used mini chocolate chips instead of reg. and added about 6 scoops/teaspoons of cocoa powder... they arent running at all, wont expand so def shape or flatten before putting in oven if u want. they are soooooo good. not too sweet(and im usually a huge sugar person, but these are perfect), perfect crunch to chewy ratio, great with some ice cold milk :) everyone loves them!

These cookies were awful!!!!!  I followed the recipe to a tee as printed and they totally crumbled and fell apart.  The taste is good, but the cookies totally fell apart.  I've never had that happen with a cookie before.

This is the first ever homemade cookie that came out right and tasted great. I did what everyone else did I added 1 3/4 cups flour, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tablespoon of baking powder cooked it at the temp it said and time. They didn't look done to me but 12 mins is enough! They were super yummy!

I really enjoyed this recipe. However, my first batch came out very flat, so I followed the advice of adding 1/4 cup extra flour, and they came out perfectly!!! Soft and chewy and very yummy! I gave it 4 stars because I really think you should change it to 1 1/2 cups flour. The modified version is 5 stars though:)

These cookies were de-licious! They`re by far my favourite oatmeal cookie, but with some slight adjustments. Instead of using half cup white sugar, I used brown sugar for all the amounts, and decreased the salt to just added a pinch. Many have complained that the cookie turned out flat, but if you mix it until just incorporated, it will turn out nice and full. lastly, I also turned the temperature down to 340 degrees, i think this give it sort of a cruchy outside, but a softer inside..mmmm...melt in your mouth! Thanks for such sharing such a delicious recipe, definately worth keeping, my family loves it, and great for beginners!

These cookies are great. I wanted something sweet to make for a snack and these cookies were a great option.

Everybody loved these so much we have to make triple batches. Thank goodness I have a 16 year old with a good arm to mix in all those oats. Just remember to toast the nuts before hand, it really improves their flavor.

The taste was really good, but I gave it four stars because they spread in the oven way beyond a normal spread. I added extra flour and baking soda like the previous reviewers suggested, I chilled the dough for two hours before using, and I made tall stacks vs cookie balls (trick my grandma taught me years ago lol) and they still spread. I think maybe next time I'll use a half stick or a stick less butter and see if that helps. Very good though, will definitely try again to perfect this.

I have used this recipe many times and each time the cookies turn out great! Although I use shredded unsweetened coconuts instead of the nuts. These cookies are so yummy! This is definitely my go to recipe; it's so easy and quick!

Will probably not be using this recipe again.  The cookies stuck to the cookie sheet.  So I ended up with a crumbly mess!!   I set the temp correctly and I have a nice Wilton cookie sheet...i don't know what happened but very disappointed.

Great cookies! Don't overbake and take the advice on increasing the Flour/soda and reducing the salt. Even the batter is delish. Enjoy!

After trying many different oatmeal cookies looking for the perfect chewy cookie I finally found this one! Sometimes I make with chocolate chips, but mostly I make them without.  I do add some cinnamon and nutmeg because I like some spice in my oatmeal cookies.  Perfect!

Chewy, delicious, and tasty, these cookies are the perfect desert. For puffier cookies, make fatter balls (don't flatten at all) and cook for longer, like around 16 minutes. Yum!

This recipe turned out some delicious cookies! It was my first time baking oatmeal cookies but the recipe was easy to follow. I did add 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more oats, and increased the making soda to 1 teaspoon. The cookies did not spread and were soft and chewy.

Great basic recipe. I encourage experimentation. For instance, instead of extra flower, add a small bag of crushed plain potato chips. The extra salt is awesome. Or split the nuts between walnuts and macadamias. Or toss in some butterscotch chips and shredded coconut. Or to add the raisins back in but preserve the chocolate, use 2 cups of raisinettes. Any combination (or all) of the above is delicious.

A great twist on a traditional cookie. I increased the flour by 1/2c. and the baking soda by 1/2tsp. I refridgerated my dough for about a half hour and my cookies were perfect. I also omitted the nuts.

These cookies are awesome!  Crispy on the bottom, chewy on top.  I omitted the walnuts and added an extra cup of chocolate chips.  I also used about 1/4 cup additional flour in my batter.  They came out perfect...chewy and gooey.

I have made these several times and have always been a hit. My only issue is the last two times I made them they come out darker with a reddish/brownish tint but still taste great. I thought that maybe it was the vanilla, but I made sure I measured correctly this last time and the cookies came out the same.  I'm stumped, anyone have any answers to what it could be?

These were great! I changed it around by using packets of instant oatmeal that nobody seemed interested in eating. I also chopped up granola bars that weren't eaten and added them instead of chocolate chips. YUMMY1

An excellent recipe! For no nuts, I just drop the walnuts and add in the remaining amount in chocolate chips (works out to approx. 1 bag). Makes for a melty, but still mostly solid, cookie.

These are very good cookies! I used butter-flavor Crisco only because I had some I needed to use, and left out the walnuts because I don't like them. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with cookies that were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. YUM!

These are my absolute favorite cookies, and everyone who eats them loves them as well!  They are a perfect chewy cookie!  It is also really easy to make a smaller batch if you don't want the 42 the recipe calls for.  The only thing I changed was to double the vanilla.  **DO NOT OVERMIX -- a lot of people mix forever and their cookies turn out bad.  **DO NOT OVERBAKE -- they should still be soft on the cookie sheet when they come out of the oven -- let them cool a few minutes on the sheet then transfer to wire racks to finish.

I loved these. I didn't have a problem with the recipe at all - made it just as written but omitted nuts. My only trouble was that I couldn't stop eating them! Also they didn't look done after 12 minutes, but I took them out anyway and they were cooked perfectly, just not brown.

FANTASTIC!!!!  Didn't change a thing.  The key to this recipe is to not over mix the dough.  Once the dry ingredients are added, just mix until uniform.  The result is a wonderfully moist, yet crisp cookie!

At first I scored the recipe 3 stars and that was after eating the cookie warm.  I ate one a day later and it was SUPER!!!!!

BTW: Increasing the baking soda and flour are definitely needed.

Perfect. I didn't change anything other than leaving them in a few minutes longer (they still looked a bit raw after 12 min). They were a HUGE hit with the fam and I will be using this recipe over and over.

I almost cringed when I read 'a good basic cookie' in the reviews. This cookie is so complex and delicious I found that rather offensive. I followed the recipe to a T (with the exception of replacing a small part of the chocolate and walnuts with sultana raisins) and they came out pretty much the best cookies I had ever had. 

They are sweet, with a hint of saltiness, chewy oatmealy goodness, complex walnut flavor and rich chocolate chunks. I did leave them in the oven for an extra 3 minutes (the temperature was running a little low though). I was tempted to put them in even longer because they weren't exactly crispy but I read in the reviews that they keep on baking even after being removed from the oven and my gosh, after they'd cooled down they were perfectly crunchy on the outside and wonderfully chewy on the inside. Love them!

This was my first time making this recipe. I made the following changes: omitted the walnuts, increased the chocolate chips to about 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups, and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. (1 tsp. seemed like too much). They were AMAZING!! I love chewy cookies. These are made with all butter and are not crispy...c h e w y. :) Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I added 1/4 C. flour, 1/2 t. b. soda, and decreased the amount of salt to 1/4 t.  Half batch was made with walnuts and the other half without.  They were so good either way and disappeared quickly!  I am not a huge fan of chocolate chip cookies, but I loved these!

This is a pretty good recipe when you make it as an oatmeal raisin cookie.  I did the recipe exact other than I pressed down the dough when I put it on the cookie sheet because I don't like rounded cookies and these absolutely don't go flat.  I also omitted the walnuts and of course the chocolate chips. I then added 1 tsp. of cinnamon.

Although I haven't made these cookies yet, I can tell its a great recipe.  When I make it, it will only have one (1) cup of sugar.  1/2 c white and 1/2 brown.  Tomorrow is my baking day.  Thanks for a great cookie.

I really enjoy these cookies!...I have been trying to perfect my choc.chip cookie for the longest time...these cookies came out chewy with a soft underlying crisp beneath....perfect with a tall glass of milk. I used the entire batch of cookie dough to bake!...In the past, I would throw the remainder after baking just a dozen because i'm a tough critic!Thanks for the recipe and Happy baking everyone!

Not the greatest recipe... I followed the exact recipe and they turned out flat; they were also far too sweet for my taste... the sweetness I found took away from the oatmeal+cinnamon+nutmeg combination. I would need to make too many modifications to the recipe to rate it higher.

I thought these were ok, but way too much oatmeal in them and not enough chocolate chips. Perhaps it's just my own preference, not sure. I followed other suggestions and added 1/2c flour, bumped the baking soda to 1tsp and only used 1/2 tsp of salt. I baked for 12mins at 325 and they were raw in the middle. I bumped it up to 350 for another 6 mins and they were over cooked. I'd have to say that maybe 10mins at 350 would work better. I prefer the Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies I, By: Sheryl Juergensen. They are by far a better cookie.

I hope I'm not the only one here that thinks this is not sweet enough. Since I refuse to be beaten, I made it again. This time, I doubled the sugar and added a teaspoon of pumpkin spice. It's definitely better the second time around with the additions.

Really good, but I didn't have any chocolate chips so I made just oatmeal cookies instead. To spice up the more plain cookies I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a bit of peanut butter to give it a nutty flavor. They turned our really well, nice and moist, I will definitely make them again!

These are delicious!  Following other reviews, I increased the flour to 1.75 C  and the baking soda to .75 tsp, and I omitted the salt.  I also added the zest from an orange and the cookies have such a nice flavor.  Thank you!

Pretty good recipe.  I didn't have any problems with flat cookies.  Mine were not big and puffy  like in some of the pictures either, they looked like cookies from a gourmet shop.  I did change the recipe a little to add some whole wheat flour (don't worry, they still taste good).  I did 1 cup all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1 tsp baking soda & 1/2 tsp salt.  I brought my eggs to room tempurature before adding in and used an ice cream scoop to scoop cookie dough (I like them big).  Only put 5 cookies to a sheet.  Flatten just a little with hand then add a few more chocolate chips on top for aesthetics.  I baked in a 345 degree convection oven for 10 minutes, switching shelves halfway through.  Cookies came out very pretty.  As long as your pans are not already hot when you put the dough on them the cookies should not spread at all.

These cookies were excellent.  I used 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 butterscotch chips based off of someone's review but felt that the butterscotch chips were a little overpowering... I'll definitely try all chocolate chips next time!

These are great!!! I am always in search of the perfect chocolate chip cookie and these come close. I made the recipe as written, except I used a mix of bittersweet chocolate chips and butterscotch chips, and chopped cinnamon-coated pecans because I did not have walnuts on hand.  I think chopped almonds would also be a great complement. The flavors are excellent, although my cookies did spread a little (large cookies at 13+ minutes), so I will try some adjustments next time.

I love this recipe! Measurements were perfect in my opinion, although I changed the recipe to include oatmeal, craisins, coconut, and walnuts instead of chocolate chips so maybe that's why I didnt have to adjust the flour.

Made these when I had some friends over and they are now a new favorite.  I'm baking some today as my daughter is coming home from college.  Hopefully, she will take most home for her housemates or I will eat them all and need to spend many hours at the gym to burn off the calories....but it will be well worth it.

This is a good recipe. I made the mistake of following the suggestions to increase the flour and baking soda. I'm not sure why anyone was having trouble with it being too thin. Mine would not spread at all. After the first batch, I started rolling them and pressing them flat and they turned out much better but still tasted a little floury. I'm going to try this recipe again without the changes.

Alight folks...
I was stoked about these cookies after a marvelous dinner. Went to the store, got the goods. Baked and ready. Tasted them. Terrible. Taste like a morning biscuit...so very bland. I followed the directions perfectly. The appearance and smell, ehh, nice. So bad I had to write a review. I suggest adding more salt, a bit of cinnamon and using old fashion oats and maybe even more sugar? Alright, my two cents. Glad my guests were forgiving.

Organic version: I made this with cane sugar instead (a tiny bit less than suggested) and a quarter teaspoon of molasses. I upped the flour by a 1/4 cup and doubled the baking soda, but used unsalted butter so the amount of salt in the original recipe was perfect. I did as Fervent Frugal Foodie did by cooking @ 335 for 12 min after chilling the dough in the fridge. 
These cookies kick! Seriously. My husband has been hooked on some expensive $10 for six cookies but says these are better, so I'll be saving some cash, too.

Very good!
I even had to substitute the butter for 1/2 margarine and 1/2 shortening b/c I was low on supplies and they still turned out really well. I also doubled the chocolate chips :)

These are insanely good, though I make them without walnuts as I am not a huge fan of that particular nut.

Really brilliant cookies, don't need to change anything.  For those complaining they turn out flat, I suggest you make bigger cookies. One reviewer said they made 48 cookies on a tray and it turned into one giant cookie.  At the size I make them, it only makes 24 cookies but they are fabulous.  Also down squish them down with a fork or similar, I leave them as big towering balls of dough and they turn into wonderful cookies.

I almost used pecans but decided to stick to the recipe & I'm glad I did the smell of the walnuts was heavenly.  Be sure to evenly distribute the nuts & choc chips.

THE BEST! but I add cried blueberries, white chocolate chips,and cinnamon. I use organic sugar instead of white and brown (same amounts), I use 2 Tablespoons of vanilla(we love vanilla),1/2 cup of walnuts, and 1/2 a cup of pecans,and for some reason Im thinking I may have used 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder too...but I cant remember. I always modify and print my way out and add it to a seperate book. Anyway these are great this way but I love the added blueberries and white chocolate. I wish I could find vanilla chips instead.

Like other users, added 1 tablespoon of baking soda and increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups. Turned out perfect! We use 60% chocolate chips in this and it turns out chewy and fantastic every single time! Plus all the oatmeal in it makes it super wonderful!

These were good, but mine only needed 10 minutes. They were burnt at 12, but maybe it's just my oven. It's best to take cookies out when they're puffy and look like they might be slightly underdone. I did add an extra 1/4 cup of flour, doubled the soda, and halved the salt. I'm not sure that these modifications really make a whole lot of difference, except for maybe the soda. The original recipe is probably fine, though if I were to make these again, I would add some extra chocolate chips.

There was nothing spectacular about this cookie.  Not bad, but not great.  Just an average cookie.  I didn't have the trouble that others did with it spreading.  I followed recipe exactly, except I cut the salt in half.
I will note that I am sure they will all get eaten, though!  ;)

This is the best choc chip oatmeal cookie ever!  I used Smart Balance butter, added a little flour and peanut butter.  If you follow the cool down method exactly, the cookie will turn out light and of perfect consistency.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I make them a bit larger for my four kids and I split the batch in half to make one half chocolate chip and the other half raisin for my husband.  They are an all around hit.

Fabulous cookies.  I baked them one or two minutes longer than suggested because they were still too soft after 12 minutes.  Delicious!  Will definitely keep this recipe handy for future reference.

SO GOOD.  I read a few reviews about the salt being a tad heavy, in my opinion I love the saltiness contrasting with the chocolate. Mmmmm. :]  I zilched the walnuts and instead added raisins. This is definitely a keeper.

These cookies flattened into puddles for me too. Too much butter. I am going to take the butter down to 3/4 C, up the flour by 1/4 C, up the soda to 1t, and take the oats down to 2 C. I'm also going to cook them at 350. That should do the trick.

I really like these. I did changed flour/baking powder/salt measurements, as other reviewers recommended. I also substituted raisins for the walnuts, as I am not a fan of nuts in cookies. They came out sweet, but not too sweet and dense. I will definitely make these again!

This is the absolute best cookie recipe I have ever made! I reduced the baking time to 10 mins because of my oven and did not let them stay on the pan for 5 minutes, straight to the cooling rack.  I also substituted butterscotch chips for the walnuts because we don't like walnuts.  These are delicious!

Yum yum yum!!  Used 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening and about doubled the chocolate chips.  Used rolled oats and no walnuts and they were wonderful.  Better then my normal recipe.  Need to add wheat germ and flax next time.

These cookies are wonderful.....mine did not get too flat either and I used all ingredients except for using 1 cup of regular oats because I did not have enough quick oats.....the time that it takes to bake at 325 did take longer than 12 minutes probably because ovens vary but they ended up very tasty and very good.

These are a major favorite in my house. I follow the recipe almost exactly but sometimes switch it up from walnuts to almonds or coconut, depending on what I have in the pantry.  I also only add a dash of salt. I've made these cookies half a dozen times and will keep doing so. I even gave some to my neighbors who just loved them.

Delicious!!! I just pulled the last batch out of the oven, and these cookies are amazing.  I took a few suggestions from other reviews.  I used 1-3/4 cups of flour, 1 tsp of baking soda, 1/2 the salt.  Wonderful recipe! Thank you so much for sharing!!

These were yummy and had a lovely chewy centre with a ever so slightly crisp edge. I'm giving 4 stars because like other reviewers I had to increase the flour. Next time I make these I'll probably leave out the walnuts because although I normally enjoy walnuts, their nutty/herby taste didn't go with the chocolate of the cookie.

Excellent cookie and I'm not much of a baker - chewy and easy to make! Just make sure you use fast-cooking oats and not the slow cooking ones or else they turn out much toughers.

These are the most amazing things i've ever made!  So easy and delicious, i'm making them right now for the second time in three days.  I took advice from a few other posts, I added more flour and baking soda, I mixed the butter and sugars for awhile until very light and fluffy and hand mixed the rest. Then baked on 335 for around 13 minutes watching very closely.  PERFECT!  Just barley brown on the bottom, moist and chewy in the middle and the oats make it very hearty.  I think the amount of salt is perfect, I love the mix of saltiness with chocolate (which i added a little extra).  The walnuts give it a great crunch and flavor. I had to pat them into more disk shapes rather than balls as they held their shape and didn't flatten out at all.  Thank you so much Panthera and to the others for posting your tips!

Excellent recipe! The best cookies I've made. The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar. I used only 1/2 cup brown sugar (trying to avoid too much of it because of my toddler) and they were perfect!

These cookies were excellent, with a few changes.  I used 1 cup all purpose flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1 tspn baking soda, 1/2 tspn salt, and 3 cups of regular oatmeal, pulsed a few times in the food processor.  I baked at 335F for 12 minutes and flattened the cookies a bit before putting them in the oven.  These are amazing, albeit a bit buttery/greasy (but that's kind of what makes them so good!).

I'm a spontaneous baker, so I never have the butter softened or the eggs at room temperature.  Here's what I did:  pretty much melted the butter in the microwave, beat the heck out of it with the sugars, then added the eggs right out of the fridge.  I had no trouble with spreading cookies.  I also did 1 and 1/2 cups of flour and 1 tsp. baking soda.  Great recipe!

Four and a half stars because my husband really liked them - but I had to make a few changes. Firstly - did no one think that three cups of quick oats was overkill? I used half that amount and it was still plenty "oaty." I did increase the flour to 1 3/4 cups, and increased the baking soda to one tsp. I wish I hadn't decreased the salt, because with unsalted butter a full tsp. would have been fine. Oh, I also added a dash of ground cinnamon and omitted the nuts. I added 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips in addition to the 2 cups of semi-sweet. Took one reviewer's advice and baked at 335 degrees for 12 minutes and they came out perfect: chewy and soft with crisp edges and golden bottoms.

Okay. I'm not totally sold on this recipe. If you get a bite without a chocolate chip in it, there's pretty much no flavour. The texture isn't awesome, and they didn't spread out at all. I followed what other reviewers suggested, adding that extra little bit of flour and baking soda, and I also added some cinnamon and vanilla... and there was still zero flavour in the non-chocolate-chip part.

Delicious cookie!  I made them exactly as recommended exept I used Butter Flavored Crisco.  I didn't over mix and I chilled them for a few hours before cooking.  The consistency was perfect in my opinion, not too soft not too crisp, and plump.  I thought they were even better the next day out of the fridge.  Thank you :)

Delicious!  We used cinnamon and chocolate chips, reduced the salt and omitted the walnuts.  Yum!  Thanks Panthera!

The first batch I did, I added the extra half a cup of flour and half a tablespoon of baking soda. It came out ok, but too crunchy, like the oats didn't cook long enough.  2nd batch I added applesauce instead of half a cup of splenda( for the sugar) and it came out chewy & fluffy. Looks really professional. lol  I like the applesauce in it, makes a big difference.

I made these according to the modifications recommended by others. I used whole wheat flour and increased it to 1 3/4c., 2 tsp baking soda, and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. These cookies came out unbelievable. I brought them to the gym with me and they were gone before I knew it. Truly the best cookie recipe I have ever made!

For the flour I used 3/4 cup of regular flour, and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, and I also decreased the oatmeal to 2 cups and added 1 cup of coconut.  Cookies are so good!

I substituted whole wheat flour for white flour and used flax seed meal instead of half the butter it calls for.  I substituted butterscotch chips for walnuts... YUM!

Ok, heres review #1,817...OMG, like this needs another one? Anyway, I read a quite a few reviews and here's what I did a bit differently. 1/2 C each butter & shortening, 1 C brn sugar only, 1/2 AP and 1/2 whole wheat flour, only used 2-1/2 cups quick cooking oats (ground up 1/2 C of it). 1/2 tsp salt & 1 tsp baking soda. Used same amount of nuts and ch chips (Hersheys). I also added 1/3 C of rehydrated dried cherries, roughly chopped. My batter was pretty dry (probably due to using wheat flour). Dough sat in the frige overnight (w/clear wrap pressed on top) due to starting late in the evening. I let the dough come back to room temp next morning and had to add a tblsp of water as it was still pretty dry. Anyway, did the 335 degree oven and because I made my cookies bigger (size of golf ball, pressed down some) I cooked for 15 minutes or until edges just started to brown. They turned out exactly like I wanted - moist, tender, chewy and not sick sweet. Oh, I did add 1 tsp cinnamon & 1/2 t ea nutmeg, grnd coriander and allspice. Don't know how well they will keep as I just baked these today. Update: cookies were just as good 4 days later.

Absolutely delicious!!!! I'd How could anyone not love this recipe?? Well of course unless you don't like cookies.  I have to disagree with the users that said this is too much salt.  The salt gives these cookies the wonderful combination of sweet with a faint hint of saltiness that I just love.  My family ate this up and it has quickly become a new family favorite and I can't wait to show this off during the holidays!  Highly recommended recipe!!!

I have used this recipe since I found it about two years ago...always a BIG hit! These cookies are terrific! I do cut back on the salt and sometimes refrigerate the batter before cooking. Sometimes I don't...I love these warm and gooey! Great recipe...Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe! I had a cookie recipe that I had been happy with for years, but I decided to try something new and was very happy with the result.  These cookies are chewy, moist, and look great!

You have to make very small cookies for it to make 3 1/2 dzn. They are tasty though. I cooked mine for 13-14 min. 12 min they were too runny.

like other users i used 1 1/2 cup flour, no salt, and a little more baking soda.  used 3/4C milk choc chips, and added 1 skinless apple -cored, peeled and cut into very small pieces. cooked in two small cake pans for 30 mins at 350degrees- let cool. cut into bars and then drizzled a little milk choc over the top of the bars.  sent them to my daughters preschool to share.  Everyone loved.  thanks for the recipe!  i managed to turn it into an apple oatmeal choc cookie bar.  super moist and fantastic!!!  :D

Absolutely the best oatmeal cookie thus far. I added 1 1/3-1 1/2 cup of flour instead of the 1 1/4 cup. Added a pinch of salt (1 tsp. is too much/if using salted butter you don't need extra salt required) baked at 325 for 13 min.  Perfect!!

I love these cookies so much!! My little sister just made a batch, and they're simply delicious. After reading the previous comments, she knew to add 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, then decrease amount of salt. I would totally reccomend this recipe. What a great rainy day snack!!

I love them!! They came out perfect. I cut the butter in half, increaded the brown sugar by 1/2 a cup and cut out the white sugar completely. Also i added 1/4 cup of honey to replace the white sugar. Couldnt notice the difference andtasted great!!!

These cookies are amazing. I have made them time and time again and they are always a hit. I did change one thing.. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce. Instead of a full cup of butter. It cuts down the calories and keeps them moist..you can't even taste the apple flavor. YUM!

The only thing I changed was left out the walnuts (hubby is allergic) and used white chocolate chips and these turned out perfect.  I have tried several chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipes and this is by far my favorite.  This is definitely in my favorites.  Thank you!

This is a Blue Ribbon recipe for sure!! Every place I have ever taken these cookies, people ask for the recipe or "who made these?" It's simple and delicious. I followed the suggestion of cutting the sugar and have also experimented with using dried blueberries and yogurt chips (in place of chocolate chips). Excellent!

These are excellent! The funny thing is that I wanted flat, crisp cookies which is what I expected after reading the complaining reviews that these went flat in the oven.  But mine didn't go flat at all, they barely spread!  I used an ice cream scoop to portion, baked on parchment at 335 (as another review suggested) for 12 minutes and they were perfect.  They were puffy and undercooked looking when I took them out, but once they cooled on the cookie sheet they fell and were perfectly chewy in the middle and barely crisp at the edges.

I pretty much followed the recipe except that I lessened the salt by half and baked at 335 for 12 minutes as one reviewer suggested.  Cookies turned out perfectly baked and my family enjoyed them.

Perfect every time.  I didn't change a thing.  I did notice that if my mixture got too warm between batches, the cookies spread a little too much.  Also, they continue to firm up when they are resting out of the oven on the baking sheet.

Perfection!!!  I cut the recipe in half, cut the salt in half, and only had 1 cup oats (opposed to 1.5).  Just used a little bit more flour and they turned out amazing.  I had to bake them for more like 15 minutes till they were done.  This made about 15 cookies.

Very good recipe.  I took the suggestion of the last person and added 1/2 cup additional oatmeal although I'm not really sure that it was needed.  I used double choc chips and no nuts.  I did not think it needed more flour (as previous comments suggested), I also thought the salt level was perfect (although I did use more chocolate and I like my baked goods to have a salty bite).  I baked mine a little longer, 14 minutes.  It's a keeper!

These were very good. I added a little cinnamon to my third tray & they were even better. Lovely recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

I can't believe I forgot to rate these cookies. Let me just say that these are BY FAR the BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever eaten!!!! I did the same as others and upped the flour,baking soda, and decreased the salt. This is my favorite cookie recipe now!!! have been making them for almost a year!!

Good cookie but only gave it 4 stars because they came out thin and I like my chocolate chip oatmeal cookies chewy and fluffy-like. I did use 1/2 cup of flour more, as well as more baking soda and less salt  as others suggested, but next time I make these I will use 1 cup of flour extra.

I took the advice on the 1/2 cup apple sauce in place of 1/2 c butter. Also went with more flour, more baking soda, more salt since I used unsalted butter, a little more oats and baked at 335 degrees but had to go 15 minutes instead of the suggested 12 to get a good product. Slight variation is I also added craisins just because we love em! Cookies turned out very nice and probably won't last long!

YUM!  These came out perfect.  I actually made half the batch as plain oatmeal for myself - and they are delicious - and the other half choco chip - which hubby loved.  About the amount of salt, I made sure to use UNsalted butter and could barely taste the salt in the finished product, but if you don't like a hint of salt, I might cut it down.

Too much salt!  Cut it in half, and you should be much better.  I ended up baking them for 13 minutes per tray, and they cooled while they finished baking.  Wonderful cookies, but modify the salt!

I made these yesterday without the walnuts. The first bath that I did turned out flat and crunchy. They were not bad but not that good either. I got tired of baking them so I put them in the fridge over night. I just baked another batch with cold cookie dough, and it turned out fluffy and yummy. I still don't get the chewiness that they are supposed to have. Overall this is a okay recipe, I think if I were to make these again I would add more flour

These were great! I used pecans instead of walnuts. The first batch came out soupy so I added more oats instead of flour. I did, however, up the baking soda like other reviewers suggested. I also used old fashioned oats instead of quick-cooking oats. Everyone loved them, and these are my favorite kind of cookies!

These cookies were great.  I made a few changes to the recipe: I used 1/2 cup of margarine and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce, I used splenda for both sugars, added 1/2 cup more of flour (I also used all wholewheat flour) I added 1/2 tsp of baking soda and only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt I also left out the walnuts . . . The Cookies turned out great and I had NO problem with them spreading at all!  With these cookies being a hit I have to issues to the kids having a couple of them knowing that they are a healthier version.  ; )

Love this! I've made it 3 times this week. Definitely not good for my waistline.... hmmm... One of the times I made it with reeces pieces because the person I made it for was allergic to chocolate- and of course it was delicious! I'm a fan of plain cookie dough too :)

I've been searching a long time for a really good Chewy Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and now I've found it...thanks very much! I took the advice of others and made the couple minor additions of flour and baking soda and they were perfect. My family loved them!! :)

I was making these and opening up the oatmeal and notice it's the same recipe on the lid! Quaker has 1 1/2 cups of flour.

I adjusted the floor to 1 3/4 cups and the baking soda to 1 teaspoon. Then I chilled in the fridge overnight, and baked at 335. PERFECT OATMEAL CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE!!! (I also added peanut butter chips to mix with the chocolate). So delish and perfect spreading.

I made my first batch of these cookies about 30 minutes ago and they are pretty awesome! The only things that I did alter were the baking time and the flour. I upped the baking time to 15-17 min - I wanted the cookies a bit firmer since I have so many to bake don't want to wait 5 minutes for them to cool and helps them to really brown. I also used rice flour in lieu of the all-purpose and the taste is great :-) None of these cookies are flat (unlike the unfortunate experiences of others) and I don't know why that would be but maybe my modifications will help someone else.

Wonderful! Since finding this recipe, I have made it several times, for company as well, and the results are perfect and very tasty each time.   Tiny clarification - since the first time, I've been using unsalted butter. Salted butter, on top of the added salt, leads to very salty cookies.

These were really good, I liked the high ratio of oats to flour.  Used 1 c raisins instead of the walnuts and choc chips. I did not add salt.

These are pretty good, a little dry.  I actually ended up using the cookies to make ice cream sandwhiches and just put them in the freezer in foil.  They tasted great that way.

Yum! I made them according to the recipe but made the cookies a little larger and added cooking time since i thought they were a little running at the 12 minute mark...and burned the bottoms!  oops!  still delicious though!

I thought they were great! I did add 1/2 tsp more of baking soda to help them puff up but other than that I left them unchanged. I will definitely make these again.

I really really liked this cookie.  I didn't have enough vanilla (was short 1/2 teaspoon) but it turned out delicious anyway.  Also, I cooked for 14 minutes and let cool on the pan for 4 minutes.  Great recipe.

Tried this cookie and it came out really good. Made a few alterations though. I did not add the white sugar part and added pecans instead of walnuts. So the cookie turned out to be just barely sweet. Skipping white sugar was my way of making it a guilt free cookie. I refrigerated the dough prior to baking them which was unnecessary in my case since the cookie did not spread at all after baking (it was very thick). You may not have to refrigerate if you have spring like weather I guess.

I baked these cookies for a friend and they turned out well.  Had no problem with flatness.  Took the following suggestions: Added 1/4 cup extra flour Added 1/2 tsp extra baking soda Chilled the dough for about 20-30 min before baking  I'm happy that I added the walnuts - I thought at first I might leave them out.  They add a nice texture.  Give it a 4 because it does need "something."  I thought at first more vanilla but maybe it is more chocolate chips.  Will try it again and see if I can improve it.

I'm an experienced baker and these are some of the weirdest cookies I've ever made.  The taste isn't that objectionable - though there's too much vanilla by 1/2-1 tsp - but the tooth is terrible.  I took many of the other suggestions (increase flour to 1 1/2 c, increase baking soda, decrease salt, increase oven temp to 235, chill dough) and they still came out overly chewy, not quite done tasting and just odd all around.  There are definitely much better oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipes out there to find!

I adjusted the measurements of the things ppl listed and my cookies still came out flat. :( I even chilled them for a hour and a half before baking. I'm not very happy with the way they turned out. I did 335 for 12 min and they looked totally raw so I changed it to 14-15 min. They looked fluffy when they came out but as they cool on the baking sheet for the 5 min they just go totally flat. I don't know what I did wrong. I wish they would have turned out fluffy and soft instead of flat and crispy. Sad.  Won't be making these again.

Readthe comments!! I baked these cookies exactly to the recipe and they spread so much you end up with flat little chocolate oatmeal wafers. Add the extra flour and baking soda and try chilling the dough before hand. I still gave this a few stars because they do taste good. I think with the adjustments you'd end up with a four or five star cookie!

made with all ingredients as specified - too much sugar - drop the white sugar all together. cut the salt in half. Texture was nice - cake-like as opposed to crispy. Used a medium (1.5" ice cream scoop) and timed took about 20 min to cook. Good taste - better if I cut the sugar.

So delicious! I was out of brown sugar so I replaced with 1 1/4 cup white sugar. I also only use whole wheat flour. Cook best if you keep them to a 1 1/2 inch size when scooping on cookie sheet. Oh and I mixed with a fork no blender. Came out soft in center, crunchy on the outside.

I changed it a tiny bit, I don't like salt so I didn't put any salt in and I put a tablespoon of very very strong coffee with the vanilla. Delish!

Near-perfect.  Chewy, hearty, rich, extremely satisfying.  The only modifications I made were slight; I omitted the white sugar and used the same amount more of brown sugar, baked for about 20 minutes instead of 12, and added a dash of cinnamon.  So good.

I am always on a quest for the perfect chocolate chip cookie.  I may have found it!  I subbed Butter-flavored Crisco + 6 tsp. water for the butter, and I used dark brown sugar instead of light.  I upped the flour to 1 1/2 cups, reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, and omitted the walnuts.  Also added some extra chocolate chips.  YUM!!!!  Absurdly good.  My family went crazy for them!

Not trying to be critical - this recipe almost identical to Quaker Oatmeal Recipte on the canister.  It's a great recipe.

I was a little worried about these when they came out of the oven as they seemed to be uncooked in the middle but after sitting they were great.  You definitely have to let them rest for 5 mins on baking sheet though, usually I skip this step but in this case I don't think one should.  I kept the recipe the same but did not use walnuts, not a fave, and added in some Heath chips.  Very yummy dough raw too!  We make again.  Thanks for recipe.

I made these cookies for my friends and they couldn't have disappeared faster! The only additions I made was an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and another 1/2 cup of oats, and I left the cookies in for fifteen minutes, not twelve. This is a fantastic recipe!

This recipe is wonderful. I followed the adjustments-- 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt and I kept the flour at 1 1/4 C  and my cookies turned out wonderfully!! I also used salted butter and used an extra splash of vanilla. This will forever be my best chocolate chip cookie recipe!!

I  took another reviewers advice and baked the cookies at 335 degrees, for about 9 minutes. They were still raw in the middle but cooled to perfection. Baking them for the 12 minutes made them too crispy, not burnt but crispy. I used margerine and did cut down the salt to 3/4 of a tsp aand no nuts. Its still pretty salty so 1/4-1/2 tsp would probably be better. The flavor definately shows up the next day. (kept in a covered container)

A fabulous cookie! I did as others suggested, increased the flour and baking soda and decreased the salt. I also added raisins as I had no walnuts. It's important not to mix the dough too much, just until a ball sticks together in your hand. I rolled them into balls and flattened each one slightly, and they didn't spread at all; also, it's important to leave them on the pan for 5 minutes after they come out of the oven, as the recipe suggests, otherwise they do fall apart. So be patient! It is so totally worth it!

This recipe is fantastic!  This will definitely be my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I did as other's suggested and increased the flour to 1 3/4 C. flour, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp baking soda.  I baked them at 325 F for 14 minutes (I set the timer at 10 minutes, they were very underdone.  Set it for 2 more minutes, still not done, set them for another 2, and they were perfect).  A must try cookie.

they were too salty, but they are soft and chewy. I added some cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg to give it a hint of flavor. I probably wont make these again though

Great, great great! I'll never make plain chocolate chip cookies again.   My tips: Do as the other reviews said and up the flour and baking soda and used less salt. And I always use an extra splash of vanilla. When making these, I accidentally, I ran out of time 1/2 way thru baking these, so I put the 2nd 1/2 in the fridge. The next day I took it out to bake. The dough was a little crumbly, but I wet my hands and then pushed the dough together in my palm. These cookies were noticeably better than the 1st half. So if you have time, refridgerate! They're great either way though.

AMAZING! Took advice from reviews and added the extra 1/4 cup of flour and also added the 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Next time I would also leave out the salt if you are using salted butter! Baking time for me took longer then 12 minutes! I used 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips and then 1/2 a cup of butterscotch chips....Perfect!!!!!! I will be making these again and again and again!

Yum yum cookies! Thanks for the recipe and tips from other reviews. I did what most people suggested and added an extra 1/2 tsp. baking soda, 1/4 cup a flour, and only 1/2 tsp salt. I also changed the brown sugar to organic sucanat and the regular sugar to turbinado sugar (raw cane sugar), and used Guittard brand real milk chocolate chips as well, oh and organic unsalted butter. They turned out delicious!!! I live in a higher altitude so cooking for 12 minutes at 325 degrees was perfect. I will definitely be passing this recipe on and making them time and time again. Thanks!

Excellent recipe! No need for any modfications.  If your cookies tend to turn out "flat" try using cold butter and beating it to soften.

Wow!!! These are fab!!. I made them as written- except the nuts (no nuts at school,...) so I added 1/2c raisins + 1/2c (or so) coconut instead- and I really think they may be the best cookies I have made- they stay soft and chewy in the middle- and kept well in an airtight container for about a week (who am I kidding- they didn't last a week)?

I halved the recipe, as it's just the hubs and I but as other suggested, I added a little extra flour and baking soda as my cookies generally turn out too flat.  These were delicious and I could tell myself they were healthier since there was oatmeal and I used some wheat flour ;)

This recipe is really, really yummy if adjusted.  I gleaned the information from a previous poster, and added a few twists of my own.  The adjustments to the original recipe is as follows:  I used 1 egg, and 2 egg whites instead of 2 eggs  I used 1/2 cup of apple sauce, and 1/2 cup of butter instead of 2 sticks of butter  I used 1 teaspoon of baking soda instead of a half of a teaspoon  I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup of white flour instead of 1 and 1/4 cups of white flour  I used 1/2 cup of splenda instead of 1/2 cup of sugar  I added 1/4 cup of extra oats, and I used Old Fashioned Oats  Finally, I used a combination of semi-sweet and milk choc. chips...However, next time I'm going to use 1/2 crushed dark chocolate, and 1/2 semi-sweet....  Also, I think raisens would be awesome instead of chocolate chips!  I know there are alot of edits, but they sure came out excellent!!!

These were fantastic and the best oatmeal chocolate cookies I have made to date.  I used unsalted butter, added a few dashes of cinnamon and froze the dough for about 20 minutes prior to rolling them up into almost 2 spoonfuls worth of balls.  I cooked for 12 minutes in a convection oven and let it cook for about 5 minutes on the pan after removal.  The dough was still slightly undercooked in the middle, which was fantastic.  Thank you for sharing!

I made these today and they were just what I was looking for.  I used soft margarine in place of the butter as I didn't have any on hand and they were still wonderful!  Thanks for a super recipe, my family loves them!

these came out perfect!  I added 1/2 cup flour & 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1 tbsp of molasses.  I refrigerated the dough.  They cooked perfect - not flat. And chewy in the middle.

I really liked this cookie! A little heavy on the oats but it totally made me feel like I was eating a healthy dessert rather than an unhealthy one! Also, my boyfriend is a total chewy cookie lover and he couldn't stop eating them! Totally idiot-proof too!

I love this recipe and so does everyone I've shared my cookies with! Last night I substituted raisins for the chocolate chips, and while they baked I thought, 'Shoot. I probably should've added some cinnamon.' But even without some cinnamon, the raisin version was just as fantastic as the chocolate chip version! And somehow, they're even better the next day! Yum!

Tasty, but there is an issue with spreading, as mentioned in many of the other reviews. I tried refrigerating the dough, but that hardly helps the cause. You will have to make adjustments. This recipe is actually nearly identical to the recipe that comes on the underside lid of the Quaker Oats canister. The only difference, but clearly an important one, is the amount of flour that is added to the mixture. The result is a well-formed cookie. A touch too crisp on the edges for my taste, so I developed a technique that helps keep softness uniformly throughout the cookie.  My preference is to turn off the oven ever so slightly on the early side. I open the oven door to let the hot air out, then shut the door and let the residual heat finish baking the cookies. After letting them cool and set, you're left with a deliciously soft, yummy treat.

These cookies are really great; I actually added a 1/2 cup of coconut flakes to the original recipe and they came out awesome. I also find that if you bake them at 350 degrees they come out fuller than when you bake them at 325 degrees. But it could just be my oven. Toodles and Happy baking!  Best, ~Vero

This is certainly a fine recipe and the cookies are delicious, however, they are not "Chocolate Chip Cookies" with Oatmeal.  They are "Oatmeal Cookies" with Chocolate Chips.  If you are looking for a Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe, this is not it.

After omitting salt and refrigerating before baking, my cookies came out as delicious little puddles of batter with lumps of chocolate, oatmeal, and walnuts in them.  Very chewy to the point of falling apart when picked up.  With so many positive reviews I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I'll probably keep looking for a recipe that works the first time I try it.

This has been a staple of my holiday cookie gifts for several years now.  I am not a fan of walnuts so I added more chocolate chips.  Next time, I'll try a combination of chocolate and butterscotch chips.  I make my batter and chill it before baking.  I also try to remember to get it back in the fridge in between batches to keep it chilled.

I love these cookies. I made a batch last night and brought them to work and everyone has raved about them all day! I am not sure if it is just my oven but I have to cook them for about 13 minutes instead of 12 and then they are perfect.

These were unbelievable and very chewy. Some people mentioned that they did not include walnuts, but finely chopped walnuts added a perfect crunch and great nutty flavor. I will DEFINITELY make them again!

Good cookie, but definately will not gt 42 in a batch.  Used heaping spoonfulls and maybe I'll get 32 - although I don't see why some people needed to add more flour or baking soda.  I didn't have walnuts so I might try this again with the nuts, and a little less salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe. The dough can hold lots more add-ins. I used 1 c. shortening + 2 TBL water instead of butter, 2 3/4 c oats, 1 c pecans. Then chopped some block Ghiradelli's chocolate, dark, semi-sweet and white (any combination) and added til the dough said 'uncle'. Also increased the vanilla to 1 TBL. They dissappear so be sure to freeze some for later! Another tasty version is to toast the walnuts before adding.

Alright, these cookies have never failed to impress. I've been making them for years now - but I'm allergic to nuts and thus enforce my choice on everyone around me (when it comes to my cooking) and happily leave them out of recipes. I substituted the nut amount with 1/2 cup more choc chips and 1/2 cup more oatmeal. This is one recipe I didn't use nut substitutes eg cornflakes, puffed rice etc. The cookies have always turned out great and have been a hit at potlucks, parties and at home. At 12 - 14 minutes of baking i end up with a crispy edged cookie with a chewy center. I added blue food colouring to a set and ended up with nice green cookies. Helped keep unwanted hands out of the cookie jar.

Brought these to a co-worker after her grandfather passed away and she loved them. I've always loved oatmeal cookies but I thought that these turned out a little bit more cakey than I would normally like. Tasted great though, thanks :)

Great cookies. Would have given 5 stars if they weren't so salty. I would suggest cutting the salt in half.

Delicious!  My family's not big on salt so I took the advise of one of the reviewer and reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, next batch will reduce a little more, to a 1/3 teaspoon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I make these cookies without the nuts.  They're the best cookies I've ever eaten! I always have to send them to work with my husband, or I'll eat the whole batch!

Added 1 T. Amaretto to recipe; otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Ended up doubling batch to have enough to eat now and freeze for later.  This has become our new Chocolate Oatmeal Cookie recipe.  Thank you!

These are fantastic!  Per the other reviewers, I used 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt.  Mine needed to bake for ~14-15 minutes.

Like the other reviewers, I added about a 1/4 cup flour and doubled the baking soda. Other tips, making sure the butter is soft before mixing it with the sugar. I also put the dough in the fridge to set for about an hour before baking it. I won a cookie baking contest at my work with this recipe!

I love this recipe! Only, I cut the sugar by half and used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and I think I actually like this better because you can appreciate the sweetness of the chocolate chips better this way. I've made a couple batches for my friends and they also liked them too!

Delicious.  Adding a little extra flour helps add structure to the cookie.  I substituted pecans for the walnuts and that seems to work just as well.

The only thing I changed about this cookie is the amount of oats, I added about 1/2 cup less.  It's just a personal preference.

This is the ONLY recipe I use for Choc Chip Oatmeal Cookies.  They are absolutely delicious.  I took them to a party a few weeks ago and one of the guys took the bag and carried it around with him all night!  Everyone else had to beg for a cookie.  I like to cook them at 350 until they're pretty brown.  Wonderful recipe - so glad I stumbled across it.

not only did my family love these cookies right out of the oven but I mailed some to my boyfriend in Hawaii and he loved them even after a week of being stuck in a slow mail process. I followed other reviewer's advice, and added more flour, baking soda and cinnimon, I also reduced the salt

One of the best oatmeal cookies I've made to date.  My changes: used egg substitute due to allergy, and only used 1 cup brown sugar (no white) which was plenty!  Can't imagine them with more sugar.

My husband loves these!  I can only bake a few and have to freeze the rest of the batter for later, otherwise he would eat these all day.  The batter does freeze well.  I roll in wax paper to tube shape so it is easy to slice and bake.  I followed other reviews to add 1/2c flour and reduce salt.

These turned out great despite my crappy microwave oven (175c)! I added 1/2 cup of flour as suggested, and only used 1/2 tsp of salt as suggested by other reviewers.  The texture was alright. It was a bit on the sweet side, so I will try reducing the sugar next time.  I kept it 4 stars due to the sweetness and alterations.

Just made these cookies. They came out very well. Flattened a bit but didn't become hard. Only things I did differently was omit the nuts, decrease the salt by half and only bake for 10 min. Other than that, this recipe is very good and simple... so not sure what everyone is complaining about. Watch your cookies so they don't over cook...

My first sheet flattened but the other sheets of cookies were fine. I cooked them only 10 minutes. 12 would be over-cooked in my oven. Maybe could have added another 1/4 c of flour. Lastly, I used 2 c of choc chips. Most recipes call for 2. One cup definitely wouldn’t be enough for me. Other than this, it’s a great, chewy cookie!

My first time making oatmeal cookies, and I'm VERY pleased with them! I followed the other reviewers' modifications and used a 1/2 cup more flour, a 1/2 tsp more baking soda, and I used margarine so I eliminated the salt altogether, although a pinch wouldn't have hurt.  DEFINITELY refrig the dough at least 30 minutes, I did, and my cookies didn't spread much at all. In fact I put half the dough in the fridge overnight and this morning's batch tastes the best! I also cooked them a touch over 12 mins on 325 - maybe 14? OVERALL - FABULOUS!!! Thank you SO much for the recipe.

Perfect and delicious.  Just the exact right amount of oatmeal! Gonna try substituting dried cherries for chocolate chips, just for kicks.

Easy enough to make, just not a lot of flavor.  My kids sure did enjoy them though.

I really wanted to like it, but I didn't think it had flavor at all.  I thought you could really taste the butter a lot.

Four stars because I did not add any nuts, just chocolate chips and oats. Next time I will add either crushed walnuts or pecans. Still very delicious and very chewy! Yields a lot more than other recipes I've tried; depends on how big or small you make them. All in all, a terrific cookie I will definitely make again!

This is an excellent cookie. I took other's advice and upped the amount of flour and baking soda, plus added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon. I put the dough in the refrigerator for a couple of hours after mixing. These were a big hit!

Super good cookie. I only had one egg and left out the nuts. I also would not use all the salt it calls for. Will make again for sure.

This turned out perfect. I followed the advice of some of the reviewers by doing the following, increasing the flour by 1/2 a cup, decreasing the salt by 1/2 tsp and increasing the baking soda by 1/2 tsp.  My husband and kids, who are  not big fans of oatmeal raisin cookies, ate the whole batch in no time.  I have to make more tonight.  Thank you.

5 Stars when you add ~1T cinnamon. This is very close to a Nestle recipe that I have used for years. My changes that worked: 2c. flour, 1t. baking soda, 1/2t. salt, milk chocolate & peanut butter chips (yummo!), I chilled the dough between batches, and baked for 14 min. Always satisfying when you find a keeper recipe!

I have a very picky 10 year old.  She hates breakfast.  She won't eat eggs or bread or milk.  So you can imagine breakfast can be a war zone.  So instead of a poptart she gets these cookies, yes for breakfast.  It has oats, nuts, eggs which is good for her and I add dark chocolate chips which are also better for her.  It helps make breakfast more tolerable.  Thanks for the recipe

My family went nuts over these, but I found them a bit dry. Next time I'll use only 2.5 cups of oats. I also followed other reviewers' advice and used 1.5 c. of flour, 1 tsp. baking soda and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp.

Delicious! I followed the suggestions to cut the salt down to 1/2 t, added 1/2 c of flour and increased the baking soda to 1 t.  I also substituted 1/2 c of applesauce for half of the butter.  Super moist, and super yummy!

The BEST cookies I've ever made.  After reading reviews I did improvise though.  Added 1/2 cup more flour and used raisins instead of chocolate.  I am making them again tonight but with butterscotch morsels.

I did add the full tsp of baking soda, and 1/4 cup extra flour. I refrigerated for several hours, cooked 12 minutes at 335 and they came out perfect. It's day two and they are still chewy, yet crisp on the outside. This recipe is a keeper. Oh, and we used white chocolate chips in 1/3, gold raisins in 1/3 and semi-sweet chocolate chunks in a 1/3. The raisin are my favorite, but all are good.

Awesome cookies!  I followed the others advice and cut salt to 1/2 tsp and increased baking soda to 1 tsp.  Also used 1/4 C extra flour.  Did not chill first, but did keep the batter in the fridge while each sheet was in the oven. They can out high and didn't spread at all!

I love this recipe! The cookies came out chewy and moist. I stuck to the recipe, but added an entire bag of chocolate chips (I love chocolate!). I had to up the cook time to about 20mins a batch, but that is neither here nor there.   This was my very first time ever making cookies completely from scratch, and I couldn't have picked a better recipe to start out on. I daresay this is almost fail proof if you stick to the directions and watch the cook time.

These are amazing!! I took some of the suggestions in other reviews, and changed the amount of flour to 1 3/4 cups, and I decreased the amount of oats to 2 1/2 cups. I also used chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips. I also baked them for 16 minutes instead of 12 because they needed a bit longer in the oven. Great recipe! My husband loves this recipe!

I love this recipe. I hadn't made it in awhile due to dieting. I made it today but I changed a few things and it worked out great. I did the flour and baking soda increase but I didn't rolled oats so I used Quaker instant and I substituted with 1/2 of the sugar being reg and the other 1/2 I used Twin sugar (1st time baking with it so I wanted to use reg sugar also) and I also used about 1/2 cup chocolate chips(husband doesn't like too many). They turned out great just chewier i think.

I as well followed others by increasing the flour and soda. However I also added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the mix. I proceeded to roll the dough into balls and they all are beautiful and perfect!So glad I perfected this one at only 21 years of age!

This is similar to my grandmother's basic recipe. Her recipe has more flour, (1/2 cup) more baking soda (1/2  teasp. more), and more sugar (1/2 cup more brown).   A great basic idea that can be used w/other added ingredients.

Absolutely delicious, and perfectly chewy. I would recomend adding maybe 1/2 cup flour and a bit more baking soda. These are PERFECT cookies for EVERYONE!

I made this exactly as is but my cookies were very flat (I should have read more reviews).  However, my husband says he likes his cookies flat and crispy instead of soft and chewy so I guess it was a success!

I made these with the suggested modifications (add 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda and subtract 1/2 tsp salt) and refrigerated the balls of dough before baking.  They came out fabulous -- crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.

Loved the cookie! I varied it by adding cinnamon chips with the choc. chips and no nuts. It was a bit flat, but next time I'll take the advice and chill the batter (as it's a warm 86 degrees F today). One more tip, I had to remove them immediately from the pan or else they stuck. The taste was terrific!

GREAT! I made these today and it turned out fabulous. I did a no-no and kinda changed the recipe but only SLIGHTLY. I subbed 1/2 cup of oatmeal for 1/2 cup ground flax seed, and chopped up an easter bunny into chunks instead of chips, and used a cup of real salted butter but didnt add the salt it called for. Turned out FANTASTIC! Not too salty or anything!

We loved this recipe. I did add a tad more flour and a tad more oatmeal. J would rather less oatmeal. I baked them for 11 min. They didn't spread out to much if i make them bigger i need to bake them 12 min.

This is a great cookie recipe!  I did take suggestions from others and made a few changes. I used 1 tsp baking soda, 1 1/2 c flour (1 3/4 cup was a little much for me), omitted the salt because I used salted butter, and 1 1/2-2 cups of chocolate chips (we like our cookies chocolatey!).  I also usually leave out the nuts, and refrigerate the dough for an hour or so before baking so they don't get flat.  I always use this recipe when making cookies...my family loves them!  Thanks for the recipe!

instead of chocolate chips in the cookie, I put dove dark chocolate ice cream topping on top of the cookies just before I bake them. I use pecans instead of walnuts.

Even though I made a few changes, the overall recipe is excellent. I followed a few of the suggestions; 335 degrees for 12 minutes - perfect, 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp. baking soda and 1/2 tsp. salt. I put the oats in the food processor and blended them to a coarse flour texture and used milk chocolate chips. Refrigerate for a couple of hours and they do not spread. Made them yesterday and they are still like they were after they cooled. Not rock hard. Thanks for a great recipe.

Oh yeah... GREAT recipe. I made a half recipe, and for some reason I wanted a "double chocolate" cookie, so to make the batter chocolate, I added a 1/4 cup of cocoa and tablespoon of vegetable oil to the batch. So if you use the full recipe, might want to double that.  Otherwise, the cookie didn't last 24 hours.

I am making the last few batches of these right now, and I had bf taste them.  He liked them--just thought they were undercooked.  I made the dough last night and refrigerated overnight, though--not bc I thought these cookies need that but bc I was too tired to bake the cookies last night!  They are easy and he liked them.  The baking time really depends on your oven and how chilled your dough is.  Directly into the oven and 12 min probably would've been fine, but my cookies are needing 16 min each.  They do flatten a bit on the cookie sheet, which is fine.  I actually like flat cookies--they stack better, and that's good for the bake sale I'm making them for.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS!  Revisions::: lessened the salt and increased the baking soda a bit (as suggested by other reviewers)... and added 1/4th tsp of cinnamon. The cinnamon really added a very nice, subtle taste. No walnuts for me-- just chocolate chips. Just before baking, I thought that my dough was still a bit too wet, so I added another 1/4th cup of oats just to be safe. Note: these cookies really flatten out in the oven.  Cookies turned out wonderfully. My boyfriend and I ate the entire batched in less than 48 hours. So so good.

These were really good, with the following modifications:  Omitted the walnuts, increased flour to 1 3/4c, increased bs to 1 tsp.  decreased salt to 1/2tsp.  I used old fashioned rolled oats instead of quick, and used the smart balance 50/50 blend sticks.   Chilled the dough for 30 min.  Baked the 1st batch at 325, for 20 min, the second batch at 350 for 12 min.  Neither batch really flattened out, but the second batch was definitely "puffier".  Will make again, and will add 1/2 c more choc chips.

These were "ok"...they do flatten out as other reviewers mentioned, but overall are a very good oatmeal cookie.  I increased the flour by 1/4 cup, reduced the salt and increased the baking soda by 1/2 tsp respectively.

I am giving this rating based on the recipe, not based on altering the recipe after reading a hundred reviews.  These cookies tasted good, but I needed to add a few minutes to the baking time.  I let the cookies on the pan for five or more minutes to cool, but these things still fell apart and we will be eating the crumbs with spoons. The only thing I did differently was omit the nuts (I have a one year old and there are nut allergies in the family) and only use 1/2 tsp salt - and I don't believe those changes caused the cookies to fall apart on me or the baking time to be wrong.  I think I will be trying some of the other highly rated chocolate chip cookie recipes on this site before using this one again.

I absolutely love this recipe with the modifications suggested by ( Fervent Frugal Foodie ) I also used large flaked oats (not the instant kind!) and MINI semi sweet choco chips and added 2 or more large tblspoons of peanut butter to creamed mixture(just because i love a hint of peanut in everything). These baked at 335 for 12 minutes were unbelievabley good. They are chewy and extremely sweet so I would suggest if you don't like sweet cookies to leave out half a cup of sugar - be it brown or white.  I didn't add any salt either because of the peanut butter and butter i used was salted.  I tried making these cookies right a way and with dough that sat in the fridge and i couldnt tell a difference either way.  I also made my cookies farely large and squished them down a bit after they came out of the oven which for me worked fine! My 2 year old LOVES these oaty cookies.  I am going to try making them next time with 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2butter and minus a 1/2c of sugar :)!! THANKS FOR THESE .. This is my new MAIN oatmeal cookie!

These cookies taste wonderful, and mine did not turn out flat at all. Just make sure to cream your butter extremely well. I do agree that the recipe could use more flour and baking soda, and I like the idea of half butter/ half apple sauce. I personally did not feel like they were too salty. I had to cook them twice as long, but that was my only complaint.

Very good cookies. I agree with the others, up your flour by 1/2 cup, a dash of extra baking soda, and don't add that much salt.  I found that overmixing was a bad idea, so I combined the chocolate chips and oats before I added it to the batter.

These are AMAZING.  The only substitution I made was to just double the nuts and leave out the chocolate chips.  They are SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!  I have made them about 8 times in the 2 months since I found them.  Tip:  You MUST use Quick Oats.  Old fashioned oats don't absorb the moisture of the batter as quickly and they come out flat.  YOU MUST MAKE THESE TODAY!! :-)

Super awsome. But again I also added, 1/2 cups more flour, 1/2 tsp more backing soda, and 1/2 tsp less salt. Amazing.  Plus, instead of walnuts I snuck in 1/2 cup of cranberrys, the kids didnt even notice. :)

These were the best cookies I have ever made.  I have made these twice in 2 days.  I did not alter the recipe.  I used unsalted butter (the recipe did not speciify). The first batch into the oven came out nice and round, soft and chewy.  Perfect.  The last batch into the oven was even more so.  I suppose that it may have something to do with the instant oatmeal absorbing some moisture over time before baking. I did not have any problems with the cookies not holding shape or being thin.

I used stick margerine instead of butter.  I was told that these cookies were "heavenly".  I have made them several times and they are always a hit!

My family loves these. Only change I made to the ingredients was to increase the baking soda to 1 teaspoon. I baked at 350 degrees after chilling the dough for 30 minutes.

This is the best cookie recipe!!!  I made these cookies for my husband a year ago and it's still is favorite cookie!  They are easy to make.  Make sure to use a mixer to blend the sugars, butter and eggs.  I didn't use a hand mixer once and the cookies were very difficult to spoon on the pan and weren't as chewy.

Cakey and disappointing.  If you like cookies with a proper crunchy shell and a chewy center these are not you're cookie.

Very good!  I increased the flour by 1/2 cup and the baking soda by 1/2 tsp and added 1/4 tsp baking powder.  I also chilled the dough prior to baking.  This recipe will be in regular rotation for my baking.

These cookies get 5 stars from the whole family. I, like many others have made a few modifications. 4 modifications actually. The first is I use Crisco Butter flavored shortening in the same measurement. The second is I use President's Choice Chocolate chips. They don't have any dairy in them so my son have them. (Milk allergy) The third is I double the amount of chocolate chips. Yum! And lastly, the fourth thing is I bake them on a stoneware pan for 16 minutes at 325 degrees.  I also use a medium sized ice cream type scoop to make uniform cookies. I get 15 cookies per pan and 3 pans so 45 cookies per batch.

These are great!  I used old fashioned oats instead of quick, and milk chocolate chips (my husband prefers them), and they turned out fabulous.  Very hearty and just the right sweetness.

These are great.  I normally don't like oatmeal cookies, but with these you almost can't taste the oatmeal, they just are really chewy.  I used 1 cup butter flavored Crisco + 2 Tbsp. water instead of butter.  I left out the walnuts and had to bake mine for almost 20 minutes at 325 and then left on cookie sheet for anohter 10 minutes.  Made 26 medium-sized cookies.

I made these and they were probably the best cookies I've ever made.  I didn't have walnuts, though, so I used about a cup of coconut. It makes them extra chewy and delicious. Perfect cookies.

I did not like how this recipe turned out. Although they were very  chewy, the batter thinned out while baking, leaving oat and chocolate lumps sitting of a pool of batter. Maybe others will have better luck.

Asesome! My adult boys really liked them. I would recommend cutting back on the sugar if you are using semi-sweet chocolate chips. Maybe reduce it by 1/4 cup.

Wow! These cookies are great! Especially right out of the oven! I did take the other reviewrs advice and increase the flour to 1 3/4 cups and baking soda to 1 tsp. After baking the first batch I found that the best temp to bake these at was 340 for 14 minutes. I highly suggest leaving the cookies on the sheet for at a minimum of 5 minutes. This is a fantastic recipe and I will keep it in my favorites! Thanks so much for sharing it!!

Nice light and chewy cookies.  I omitted the white sugar altogether since my husband and I don't like anything TOO sweet.  Also used dark chocolate chips for the same reason.  And reducing the salt to 3/4 of a teaspoon worked out JUST PERFECT (with unsalted butter!).  Yummy!

Awesome Oatmeal cookies!! These cookies are very soft and cooking them at 325 instead of the standard 350 was what really made these puppies chewy and not hard. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made these the first time and they turned out perfectly. Now, the past few times, they don't spread out at all. They cook in almost the exact same shape they were when I put them on the cookie sheet. I tried to use a bit less oatmeal.  I love their flavor.

I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, non-packed. I also used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour + 3/4 cup all-purpose flour to increase the whole grains. I put the dough in the frig to chill for about an hour before baking--they turned out perfectly...not too flat and perfectly chewy. I would definitely use the old-fashioned oats for really chewy cookies (using instant oats would probably decrease the chewiness). These were yummy. Everyone calls them granola bar cookies b/c they're so oat-y. Yum!

Ok - the flat cookies are a result of the oats!  I have now made this recipe 5x and everyone loved them until, today - when I used a Safeway brand of oats.  I had been using the Target brand prior and shall go back to that for all future recipes.  Watch the oats - they can ruin the whole thing.

I liked that this recipe is easy on the flour.  I was careful not to overbeat--as soon as dry ingredients get incorporated, stop the mixer!  I used mini chocolate chips and sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  Next time, I want to add coconut and caramel to the mini chips & almonds.  Very chewy and delicious.

Great recipe! Only change I made was adding a little more vanilla (which I do with all my oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies). Just finished the last batch in the oven and can't wait to eat them with some vanilla icecream! My husband has already snatched a few to dunk in a glass of milk.

I omitted the salt completely, and substituted dark chocolate chips and dried cherries.  People went NUTS over these cookies....they were phenomenal!!!!! I also used regular Quaker Oats (not the quick-cooking variety), and I baked them at 325 for 15 minutes (they were too undercooked at 12). I had no problems with the cookies spreading.  They were the perfect size.  They didn't burn at all and they were SUPER soft and yummy.

The perfect chewy, gooey cookie!  I listened to the other reviews and added more flour, baking soda and vanilla.... so so good.  I baked some for a new neighbor, my co-op class and had extra's for my cookie loving husband, mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

I had sworn off making cookies as I am the Queen of making them spread thin.  I followed the suggestions of adding a 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda...baked them at 335 degrees for 12 minutes and they are awesome!  Thank you for giving me my confidence back!!

Really great cookie. I took the suggestions in the other comments and upped the flour and baking soda and because I used salted butter I omitted the salt. Very easy to make and super yummy.

Pretty good.  I didn't have any nuts so I subbed raisins.  Only complaint was they were too sweet, probably because of the raisins.  Will reduce the sugar next time and make a double batch so I will have plenty for the freezer.

Wonderfully chewy and delish with the proposed changes: +1/2c flour, +1/2 teaspoon baking soda, -1/2 teaspoon salt. I also doubled the vanilla like I do for chocolate chip cookies per cookie advice on this site. A keeper recipe for sure

It's more like 4.5. I think I may have followed too many different advices. I used about half butter, half apple butter, didn't use any white sugar at all, increased flour by 1/4 cup more, and oats by the same amount. I used full tsp of baking soda in total, and half choc. chips and half skor caramel bits. Chilled the dough for 30 mins, and baked at 335 for 12 mins as suggested by one reviewer. Turned out pretty good, but not chewy....more soft. Maybe I made them too big, or should have just gone with 1/2 tsp of baking soda next time. Still pretty good.

Fantastic cookies! Be sure to not over mix, beat butter and sugars well then do the rest by hand. VERY important!! I added more  chocolate chips (by about 1/2 c.) and had to increase the baking time by a few minutes (old electric oven!) but they are really easy, great tasting cookies!

I made this recipe as it is written--I was in a big hurry for a cookie/chocolate fix.  I agree with most of the reviews.  If you are using salted butter, reduce the added salt to half, add a little more flour.  These cookies did work for me with an adjustment in cooking time.  I cooked them for 13 minutes instead of 12 and left them on the cookie sheet for an additional 5 minutes.  I ate, and ate these cookies, there is something addictive about them.

Great cookies.  Only changes I made were to add white chocolate chips and m&ms for the kids.  I'm sure these are just as awesome with chocolate chips.  I halved this recipe with no problems.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very nice texture - chewy-ish on inside and crunchy just on the outside. The walnuts (when ground into very small pieces) at a nice touch to the recipe - no one would know they're in the cookies! And there are just enough chips to enjoy a sweet cholatey flavor without being overwhelmed. The oats give a good bite to the cookie - almost a crunch. My favorite oatmeal cookie recipe with choc chips by far!

These are the best cookies I've ever had, and everyone who I've made them for agrees! Awesome recipe, thanks!

I tried these again, and subbed canned pumpkin for the cup of butter, and mixed in about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, and they came out delicious!

These taste really great, but they're pretty flat and stuck together. Would be great if you're having a really bad week and don't mind picking up several stuck-together cookies and taking a bite.

I used fresh ground spelt flour for the white (1/4 more per 1 c white) and sucanut sugar or white, a tad more baking soda and fresh flaked oatmeal and what you get are the best good for you choc chip oatmeal cookie!!! My husband loved them and told me not to mess with his favorite cookie.  He likes them this way too and they are good for you too (as good as dessert can get)  Try it!!!

Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies are my favorite.  I have tried many recipes and this one is the best.  I followed the advice of increasing the flour to 1 3/4 cups and the baking soda to 1 tsp. and they were perfect.  I like to use dark chocolate chips.  They are sinful!

My husband loves oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and I've tried many different recipes. I tried this one the other day and he says that it's been the best! I even like them and I don't care much for oatmeal cookies. The cook got it right! Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved making these cookies! I made them last year for my book club cookie exchange and the members loved them. I got a request later in the week to make another batch of cookies. I found them easy to make and delicious.

Fabulous recipe!!! I didn't change a thing except to raise the temperature on my oven just a tiny little bit to about 335 degrees. Many reviewers didn't like that these cookies are rather flat, but that's exactly the way I like my cookies. These are nice and soft with some crispness around the edges. Awesome flavor! Perfect!

I used salted butter, but decreased the amount of salt by 1/4 teaspoon. made rather large balls placed directly on a pan without spraying it first. Bake for 12 minutes exactly, let sit on the pan for 5 minutes and they turned out perfectly! I also changed from chocolate chips to chopped chocolate. they were a good thickness, chewy all the way around, and absolutely delicious! My roommates loved them too!

this really is a great recipe -- it was so helpful to read what everyone said about adding more baking soda, omitting salt, adding more flour, and adding more oats -- I did all that but also added some cinnamon and added cranberries and used "dark" chocolate chips.  335 degrees is right on for a temp!

a very beginner cook, here, speaking!
This recipe was good...and would've been better...if only I added Baking Soda/Powder!
Yes, that's right, I'm ashamed to say, that I made the cookies [following the total instructions, originally written down], without any Baking Powder...Though it's not risen up ... and I found the batter a bit dry to work with... like when I put down a spoon full it would fall apart right away..beside that,it's a good cookie overall...And I'll definately make it again, when I have the time and baking soda !

These cookies were sooo good!!
I did add more flour, but in the end I found that my mixture was too dry so I added a splash of milk.
I will make these again for sure!!! They were a great texture and really hit the spot!!

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!! The first time I made them I didn't change a thing. They turned out very yummy. Just to see what everyone was raving about with the changes, I added more flour and baking soda and decreased the amount of salt. They are so, so, so good! I usually bake them for 14 mins instead of 12. Best Oatmeal chocolate chip cookie you will find! Look no further!

These were EXCELLENT. I'm not a big fan of oatmeal cookies but these are very tasty. I just wanted to mention that I made a batch with the popular recommendations (increased Flour 1/2c, Baking soda 1/2tsp and decreased salt by 1/2tsp) these cookies were light and fluffy. Whereas the original recipe (only change was decreased salt) produced a little flatter and moist/chewy cookies. The taste was very yummy either way.

Not sure if I did something wrong or not.  Flavor was good, but they turned out crumbly and difficult to get off sheet.  Baking time seemed too short as well.

Chewy and delicious! I also added an extra 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 Tbsp baking powder, and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. I usually use the recipe listed on the Quaker Oat's lid, but these are far superior!  Definitely worth a try.

THis recipe came out great. I modified it slightly by using only brown sugar instead of brown and white. I also used Hazelnuts in place of walnuts and I took a chocolate bar and chunked it up instead of chips. Made for a great chocolatie oatmealie suprise!

If you like oatmeal, you'll love this cookie! As other users suggested I added 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda. I didn't, however, omit the salt because I used unsalted butter. If using salted butter, it is best to decrease or omit salt altogether. I halved the batch and made one with white chocolate chips and cranberries, and the other with milk chocolate chips and walnuts. Both were equally great! No need to refrigerate dough, and baked exactly per recipe instructions. Cookie came out perfectly puffy, and not flat as others suggested.

The best cookie recipe!  I had a recipe similar to this one but somewhere over the years missplaced it.  With the adjustments that others made to the baking soda, salt,& all-purpose flour it turned out just like my old recipe.  Thak you.  In additon to the about adjusments I put my oats in the blender & a milk chocloate bar and grind them up slightly before adding to the mix.  I like the texture. The milk chocolate just gives it that little extra.  Thank you.  Delicious recipe!

WOW! These cookies are fabulous and easy to make. I let the dough sit in the fridge for 4 hours and they didn't spread at all. I also used 1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 t. more baking powder and 1/2 less t of salt. They are perfect and my family gobbled them up.

This recipe is not as good as stated. I increased the flour and soda as per past recipe users, but it comes out like a cake cookie which is NOT a real cookie. YUK! It should be soft and almost doughy. Like ones you get at REAL bakeries. Where are those recipes??

I couldn't find my coveted oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe, so I decided to try this one. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, they are delicious & chewy and so yummy.  Next time for my husband's sake I may cut the nuts back to 1/2 cup as that was his only complaint.

These were really good.  They had great flavor (2 t. vanilla).  I loved the nuts in them- I used pecans.  I got rave reviews from those that ate them.  I will make them again. 
And leave the salt!  I love salted cookies- I didn't think it was too much at all.

These cookies taste great! My cookies were not flat, but they were very crumbly. I baked them for the specified time, but added two minutes since they were very wet in the middle after the initial 12 minutes of bake time. My husband loves how they taste, but they are pretty messy. Not sure I'll use this again.

Maybe it's because I live at a high altitude and in a dry climate, but I didn't have to add more flour to this recipe. I was, however, very careful not to overmix. Generally a pretty good cookie. Thanks!

I never usually review recipes from this site because I always change it up a bit and feel guilty rating my version of it.. but this cookie is the exception!!!! Hands down the best cookie I have found to date!!! Cooling the dough is a must unless you like flat hard cookies. However if you are like me and cant help but to put a little bitty spin on this rec add some ground cinnamon-YUMMY!!!

I'd have given these a 5-star rating, but since I messed with the recipe a bit (I added a 1/4 cup of flour and an extra 1/2 tsp. of baking soda as per other reviewers suggestions), I'm only giving a 4. But these are awesome cookies, with the modifications I used! They're chewy, chocolatey and quick and easy to make. I'll make them again!

I've made this many many times and every time they disappeared quickly!! My boyfriend loves them a lot! I've used 3/8 cup of honey instead of white sugar, and used about 1/4 cup more of chocolate chips and walnut. The honey makes them even chewier!!

this is a good recipe but you will be tempted to add flour to make the dough less sticky. I've done this twice without thinking and the cookies don't spread. So next time I will not add the flour and they'll probably be better.

I made these cookies just as the recipe states except I did chill the dough in the refrigerator for about 1 1/2 hours because I tend to cook flat cookies otherwise.  I thought the cookies were very good, and they were a big hit with my boyfriend.  This is certainly a recipe I will hold onto.

Yummy I love these!  I had to add about a tablespoon more of flour but not that much.  They were very tasty and good.  I changed the baking time to 350 for about 15 minutes.  I added raisins and chocolate chips and they were sooooooo good.

This is the *perfect* oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe!! My teenage daughter agrees!! Minor changes: I substituted milk chocolate chips, used 1 Tbsp Mexican vanilla, and used regular rolled oats. Simply wonderful!! Oh, and I added the eggs *two* at a time?! Gasp?!

All my friends and family rave about this recipe.  As suggested by other reviewers, I often increase the flour, plus I tend to use unsalted butter since salted butter and the recommended amount of salt tends to be a bit too salty for my personal taste.  I also add about 1/2 cup more oats to keep them from going flat.

Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are my favorite and these are perfect. I usually put them in for about 15 minutes at 325 and they come out great. Family loves them. The batter is also delicious!  So oaty!

Ok 325 for 12 minutes was waaaaayyy off for me, and I've got a new oven that works very well. I did the second batch at 375 for 10 minutes and got MUCH better results with a crisp yet chewy cookie. After trying it by the recipe the first time (I always do), the second time I added 1/2 cup cinnamon chips and 1 cup coconut. It was splendiferous! Great recipe, just needed a little tweaking. Thanks!

This is my fail-safe oatmeal cookie recipe.  I learned quickly to make them when I'm home alone, or they're gone before the last tray even has a chance to cool x)
  
Due to some allergies in my family I omit the nuts, and double the chocolate chips.
Other than that the only change I make is the addition of a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter.  They don't -need- it, I just really like the extra flavour.
I live in a dry climate, and am very pleased that they don't dry out like crazy as so many other cookie recipes do.

Great recipe.  I have made it hundreds of times by now I'm sure.  Every time we're in charge of desert for potluck functions I make a large batch and never have any to bring home by the end of the night.

Great cookies! I modified it slightly by using 1/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup golden crisco. I also found I needed to cook them a bit longer - 15 min. Last if you are not a walnut fan, pecans work great too!

I did the changes, and my cookies still ended up flat. I used caramel bits though, so I think that is the reason. They are super yummy!

I cut the recipe in 1/2, used rolled oats (because that's what I had on hand), and put the dough in the freezer for 20min. They pretty much kept their shape...maybe I'll use instant oats next time. Other than that, they were good.

These are excellent.  Because of these cookies, my husband has made the switch from reg ch. chip cookies to oatmeal!  I made these for my coworkers and they loved them.  Even my friend who refuses to eat anything 'healthy' ate it, loved it, then I told her there was oatmeal in it.  She was surprised.  These are great.

Yummy cookie!  I used half shortening, half butter (unsalted), half whole wheat flour, and regular oats.  I also decreased the salt to 1/2 t. and used raisins instead of nuts.  Hubby raved about them.

A great chewy cookie recipe.  My husband found them a little on the bitter side so next time I make them I might use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

Fantastic! I made this recipe for a housewarming party, and I sent some with my husband to work. Everyone loved this cookie! This cookie is great especially if you like soft cookies. The nuts add just the right amount of crunch.

Delicious cookies. Really good. The only problem is that they haren as they cool. They were great while they were still warm after coming out of the oven but when cooled they became difficult to chew. Try warming them up for 5 minutes in the oven before eating them they should be OK.
To avoid flat cookis. I shape the dough into a messy ball and put them on the cookie sheet. the shape came out excellent. More vanilla for me.
I used pecans instead of walnuts so they were not too salty as some people complained.
Will probably make them again but always serve them warm.

These are delicious!  As recommended, I added 1/2 cup more of Oatmeal.  Also, I substituted whole wheat flour and about 2 tablespoons of bran for the white flour.  Normally I would use ground flax for a nutty flavour, but I was out.  I didn't have walnuts, so I ground about 1/4 cup of roasted almonds and toasted 1 cup of coconut.  I used about 1 1/4 cup of Hersey dark chocolate chips and threw in a handful of raisins.  I was thinking these would be amazing with dried cherries.  Next time I will cut down the salt and add walnuts instead. Thanks!

I've made these cookies twice....the first time I was afraid of them being flat, so I added 1/4 cup extra flour as suggested by another reviewer....they were not quite "drop" consistency, the dough was very dry and almost crumbly.  But the end result was great!  The second time I made them according to the recipe and they turn out FLAT!!  So I really liked the taste....I will be making these again and maybe try to find a happy medium with the additional flour.

These cookies are amazing!  The only thing I changed is that I chilled the cookie dough for an hour before baking to prevent spreading.  This is a delicious and simple recipe that I will definitely use again.

My husband is the picky cookie guy and he LOVED these! When I was making these cookies I only had 2 1/2 cups of oats but they still turned out awesome. I added 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 tsp more baking soda. They were not flat at all! I also rolled the dough into little balls before baking them and I think helped them not be so flat. I baked them for about 2 additional minutes or until they were more golden brown too. They were so chewy and soft! I loved this recipe. ( It replaced my regular old chocolate chip recipe!)

These are wonderful!  This is my 3rd time making these cookies and they get better each time.  I did follow some advice from other reviewers and added 1/2 cup more flour and refrigerated my dough.  I made rather large cookies so I ended up with about half as many.  These cookies are a huge hit!

Nice and moist!  I didn't add the walnuts but did add double the amount of chocolate chips.  Yum.  It's also good with 2 cups of raisins, some nutmeg and cinnamon.

I've been looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe so I tried this one!  It's great!  I love biting into the chocolate chips instead of raisins for a change.  I only needed a few cookies so I halved the recipe and everything worked fine.  I made large cookies and cooked them just a little longer than the 12 minutes stated in the recipe.  I'll certainly use this recipe again and again!

These are very nice cookies.  My husband loved them. I didn't have choc. chips, but I had white choc. chips and used those. I like raisins and will try adding them next time, didn't have any this time.  The last time I made cookies I burnt the bottom on some (most) This time I put the rack on the second highest position (one up from the middle in my oven)and not a burnt cookie in the bunch. the recipe doesn't state what size spoon to use so I used the tea spoons that you use for sugar in your morning coffee and ended up getting about 80 cookies. approximate because it was hard to count as they kept disappearing Defiantly making these again also I didn't have light brown sugar but did have dark brown and used that.  My cookies didn't spread very much, perhaps thats why. PS my brown sugar had turned hard, put it in the micro for 30 sec.and it was fine

These cookies came out perfectly.  I made one change, though.  My 2 yr old is not a nut fan, so I sustituted the cup of nuts for an extra cup of chocolate chips- YUM!!!  They are not runny or flat, and they stayed chewy- AWESOME!!

Followed recipe as written, except had dark brown sugar on hand not light. Not much of a baker so don't know the difference. Just know the recipe turned out some darn good cookies.

These turned out very hard, not chewy and soft like I imagined. I didn't use real butter, I wonder if that is the cause. They were not the sweetest cookie, either, although that was a selling point for allowing my toddlers to eat them!

This recipe is so easy to follow and the finished product is great.  I did sprinke in some nutmeg and cinnamon while after the vanilla which made it even better, I think.  I also cooked them for 15 minutes since my cookies were kind of thick.  My son could not stop eating the cookie dough by itself, even that was good.  This recipe is a keeper.

I love these cookies!  I made them again yesterday for a super bowl party and they were a hit with everone.  I do add just a touch of cinnamon and also took a previous reviewer's suggestion to add both chocolate and butterscotch chips.  They turn out perfectly every time.

These cookies were really good, we omitted the nuts and added a little coconut, and refridgerated the dough as suggested in other reviews. Next time I make them all my husband suggested would be to add a some apple bits into the dough...should be good. Thanks for this one.

An absolutely delicious recipe.  

I was initially a bit concerned that the cookies would spread, as I followed "Nancyartist's" advice and reduced the flour, which left me with a fairly thin batter (before the oats and chips).  However, no problems with spreading whatsoever!  I skipped the wal-nuts and compensated with extra chocolate chips.

The texture of the cookie was perfect.  I will be making these again.

My 11 year old daughter said this is her "favorite cookie".  I doubled it as we have 4 kids who love cookies.  I added about 1/4 c. flax seed and 1/4 c. wheat germ and lessoned the oatmeal by 1/2 c.  Delish!

A friend and I made these cookies for her boyfriend serving in Iraq as a Valentine's day mailing.  They turned out ABSOLUTELY perfect!  I had a favorite cookie, but these were so great, I may have to make this my new favorite!  I will definetely be saving this one.  (We had to bake ours for 15 minutes however... so if you have big spoonfulls, try cooking a little bit longer.)

this is a great recipe but i knocked off a star because i definitely wouldn't call them chewy.  they are a nice soft/crumbly texture - not crisp or chewy.  to ease my guilt, i cut the sugars exactly in half and replaced 1/4c flour with 1/4c flaxmeal.  i also cut the chips in half.  my family didn't even notice and loved the cookies!  they taste just as good and become a healthy snack instead of a guilty conscience.
i used a tablespoon measure to scoop the dough and then flattened them out (they don't do this on their own).  it made 2inch diameter cookies - 50 cookies total.

I made these as suggested by others and added more flour, baking soda and less salt.  I thought they came out a little dry.  They tasted ok but I thought they were missing something.  I don't know what everyone is raving about!!  I am going to stick to just plain chocolate chip cookies instead without the oatmeal.

These were the most delicious cookies I think I've ever made!  My husband mixed the wet ingredients, I did the dry.  We used a liquid measuring cup (all we had), were slightly over on some things, and slightly short on others.  These cookies turned out wonderfully, didn't spread, and we absolutely love them!  A fairly straight-forward, simple cookie.  Delicious.

We followed the recipe, but they didn't come out as well as we had hoped.  They were very flat, so we had to triple up the cookies after taking them out of the oven to make a regular size cookie :)  Thanks for sharing, but I don't think I will be making these again.

These are very good cookies. I'm not over the moon about them, but I really like them. I used used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose. I also increased the oats to 3 1/2 c. and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. as some reviewers suggested. I doubled the chocolate chips because I omitted the walnuts.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. I didn't have any trouble with them spreading.  In fact, next time I make them, I will probably flatten them a bit on the cookie sheet before I put them in the oven. These are VERY rich cookies (2 sticks of butter!!!). I think the next time I make them I will substitute a half cup of the butter for 1/2c. of applesauce. I might also cut back on the sugar a bit too. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good.
I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the nuts and added 1/2 cup coconut.
I'll make them again.
They spread a lot.  They are very sweet so next time I might cut down a bit on the sugar.

This is a really great cookie recipe. However, noting the changes other members made, I am listing mine. Not having any brown sugar on hand, I substituted 1 1/2 tablespoons of molasses, increased the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups; used unsalted butter; did not change the amount of salt in recipe; toasted my walnuts first; used a couple of drops of walnut flavoring; used a 1/4 cup measure to determine the amount of dough so cookies would be large. Made 26 cookies. Delicious!

Excellent flavor, but they did come out flat. I had to bake them for 15 minutes because at 12, they were just gooey dough. Overall, they're delicious and I'll make them again.

These will blow you away. The flavor is perfect by adding about 1 teaspoon cinnamon for the cinnamon raisin alternative. For the chocolate chip, just add one- half teaspoon of cinnamon. Also add one-half cup more of flour + oats. Freezing these before baking is a must so they bake successfully. Also for the raisin kind, add coconut. The temp can be raised to 350 for 12-13 minutes.

I think the issue with the recipe (cookies flattening out, etc) is that it says to bake at 325 - every other chocolate chip cookie seems to be at 375.

These cookies rock!  I used 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tps. baking soda & 1/2 tsp. salt I used 2 cups M & M's instead of chocolate chips & nuts.  These are the perfect oatmeal cookie!

These were amazing.  Everyone loved them.  I omitted the nuts and made 1/2 of the batter with chocolate chips and 1/2 without.  My kids and I prefer them without the chocolate chips.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great cookie!  I have never baked this type cookie before, and it is unique enough to be memorable among the regular classics.  This cookie also stayed soft and chewy days after baking.  Great cookie (used the recommended adjustments).  Will definitely make again!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Great recipe. I followed the directions to a tee. My first batch came out real flat, so I refridgerated the rest of the dough. I had my second batch last night and they were all gone in minutes-prettier and more apealing than the first batch.

Fantastic!  Definitely let these cool completely before trying to remove from the cookie sheet.

I substituted a couple Tbs. of rum for the vanilla and it gave it a wonderful aroma and taste.

Absolutely cracked the code with this recipe.  This recipe (as modified with the user comments) provides an absolutely perfect and chewy oatmeal cookie.  The family loved them.  I am probably going to add a bit of cinnamon next time.

I made these cookies over the weekend, and they are now my favorite cookie!  Even my husband, who's not a chocolate fan, says these cookies are awesome!
I love how they stay so moist.  The only change I made was adding a bit of cinnamon.  Great cookie!

i did what all the other review articles suggested and added the extra flour, baking soda and a little less salt. i baked these cookies as xmas gifts for co-workers and they LOVED them. i loved them/love them (i still have 5 left) too. it made about 4 dozen cookies (more than the recipe says) - they are, if i dare say, the best cookies i've ever had.

YUM. enjoy!

Very, very good, received rave reviews but I agree that the cookies were flat.  The next time I make them I will follow the other review advice to add more flour and less salt.

Delish! My batch made 6 dozen medium sized cookies! Our Church Youth Group gobbled them up in minutes!!! I did omit the nuts and baked for 13 minutes, and they were still great! Recipe is a real keeper!

I am on a search for good butterscotch oatmeal cookies for my husband. I did not like to top rated recipe for them so I tried these and changed out the chips. I found both recipes made very crispy cookies. These were a little better though. I would love to find a softer texture recipe, but maybe that's not possible with oatmeal!

I found this recipe after my husband's request to make a chocolate chip cookie like "Dad's Chewy Chocolate Chip" store brand.  This cookie came as close as possible.  
I did change a could of things. I did as previous mentioned with regards to the flour, baking soda and salt adjustments.  In addition, I added baking powder (equalling to the same amount of baking soda, ie:  1 tsp powder for 1 tsp soda).  Living at a higher elevation, this allowed my cooking to finish flat.  
Since I didn't have walnuts, I began using coconut instead.  The cookies came out perfect each time.  He loves them and I've already have made 12 doz since the beginning of the year for him.  And secretly, I love them too!  This is an excellent recipe for anyone who wants a soft good tasting chocolate chip cookie.

This is by far the BEST cookie recipe ever. I did try the variation that others suggested, and I about ate the 1st dozen before I could get more in the oven! I added some raisins and pecans along with chocolate chips. They were just fabulous!

My kids and all their friends love this recipe.  If anyone finds the recipe too soft, try using whole oatmeal flakes, or just add 1/2 cup more oatmeal. I use more oatmeal in mine and lessen the sugar by half if I am making batches for the kids to take to school for parties.  The teachers appreciate the lower sugar content and the kids never notice.  The chocolate chips more than makeup for it.  Best cookies ever!

I don't bake very often, but these cookies made me look like I do!  They were great!  I took another review's advice and used half chocolate chips and half chopped up heath bar.  I took them to Thanksgiving and they were a big hit.  Very easy to make.  Like other reviewers I added 1/4 cup of flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, halfed the salt and let the dough set in the frig for 15 minutes.  Great recipe!

This is a very good and simple recipe.  Especially for the first-time bakers.  I would suggest changing the baking time to 10 minutes instead of 12 -- because the cookies still cook as they cool, and you definitely don't want them to get hard.  Great recipe!

These were the best.  I was asked to bake some oatmeal raisin cookies and thought I would give this recipe a try.  I added 3/4 cup raisins, 1/4 tsp mixed spice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and left out the nuts.  They were soft and chewy and delicious.  I also added 1/4 cup extra flour as suggested by other reviewers - they didn't go flat at all.

Fantastic! My boyfriend loves these and practically demands I make them for him to take to work, since he coworkers seem to ask for them repeatedly. I add a dash of cinnamon and 1/4 cup flour, just to keep them soft and fluffier. Love them! :)

Excellent. I used the suggested alterations and they were definitely not flat. I did not have to refrigerate the batter at all. Next time, I will increase the chips to 1 1/2 c. and try the butterscotch suggestion. So yummy!

These were really good.  I followed the advice of others and added 1/2 of flour, 1/2 tsp of baking soda and reduced the salt by a 1/2 tsp.  I think the next time I make this recipe, I will follow it as is and not make the changes to it.  It turned out a little cakey with all that extra flour.  I'll come back and edit my review after I make them as is next time.

Great recipe!
I only made half the batch, and changed it accordingly. I also took the other members advice and adjusted it by adding a little extra flour and oats, and baking powder. I also added raisins.
The only adjustment Id make is to lower the amount of suger abit, maybe by 1/4 of a cup because they are quite sweet.

This recipe gets gobbled up every time I make it! When I made them though I didn't have regular oatmeal so I used brown sugar and cinnamon oatmeal ( the cinnamon does the trick).

GREAT base recipe, wonderful chewy texture!

Around the holidays try making these with dried cranberries ("craisins") and Nestle's green and red white chocolate morsels.   Also great with caramel chips for a different flavor.

REALLY good, kids and adults alike go nuts for them, they are gone in a day.

5 Stars. Amazing recipe; Everyone loved them!

Modified slightly to accommodate our taste: 2 C. oats, left out the walnuts.

The best chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe!

This recipe was awesome! The cookies were not too sweet so that highlighted the taste of the chocolate chips. I also love how chewy they turned out to be! They were chewy but, unlike the commercially-sold chewy cookies, they held their shape. I've them SO many times already and, each time I do and I let someone try them, they keep asking me to make more! Thanks for posting this recipe ;)

Great recipe! I tripled it and made huge monster cookies with about 5 lbs of candy bits - they sold like crazy at our school bake sale! I made the modifications on flour/etc that everyone else suggested... one batch I ran out of oats and they came out really flat.

Outstanding! These are our go-to dessert. Everyone loves them. I've found that extra brown sugar and vanilla really make them extra tasty. I cut out the walnuts and use 1 cup of chocolate chips. 1/2 cup isn't enough.

I use stoneware for all my baking and find baking them for 10 minute and then allowing them to rest on the stone while another set bakes works best.  If I bake them on the stone for 12 minutes, they get a little too crispy.

These cookies are so so so good. I didn't like them on the first day though. Better on the second or third day, although I'm not sure why. This is now one of my favorite bake ahead of time recipes. They also freeze very well.

I don't know if I can legitimately rate these, since I didn't actually *bake* them, per se...  But if the dough is any indication (which of course it is), these are very, very tasty!  What can I say, I've always liked dough better than when it is cooked...and I had a cookie dough craving that I could finally indulge, since I'm not pregnant anymore!  :)  (and no, I didn't eat the whole thing!)

Reading the other reviews i decided to use 1.5 cups flour and i cooked them for 14 minutes and they came out fine. They seemed a little too oatmealy for my taste. But they were very good. My boyfriend tells me oh I hate oatmeal. But he took one anyways, and then another, and another.... so I guess they were good!

These cookies are great. I personally prefer less sugar, and milk chocolate chips. All who have tried these really like them. Nice and chewy, thanks for the good recipe :)

Wonderful! Even my husband loved them - and he is NOT a fan of oatmeal in cookies. I did as others suggested - increasing flour by 1/2 cup and increasing baking soda by 1/2 teaspoon.

I messed up and added 1/2 C white sugar to much and these still came out good.  I did make the adjustments by adding 1/4 C flour, 1/2 t baking soda, and cut the salt by 1/2 t.  I put the dough in the fridge for a few min before I starting cooking and they turned out perfect!

I added the suggested flour and baking soda as suggested, but I found these cookies to be a little too dense, I think I would prefer them with less oatmeal perhaps?  Also, about half of mine got burnt but I think that could be blamed on the fact that I am living abroad in Chile and cooked some in a wood stove and the others in an oven that doesn't seem to have any temperature gauge!!

For the record, this is the first bad review I have ever given. I bake cookies at least twice a week, and by judging on the rating and amount of reviews I thought that this was a great recipe to try. I did the changes of the flour, soda and refridgeration as all the reviewers suggested(never been steered wrong with review tips)...however, my cookies were puffy and not at all "chewy". Very cakey and fluffy, not at all what I was wanting. SOOOOO dissapointed. Apparently I will have to try them without making the changes. Sorry, first time dissapointed with the reviews on ALLRECIPES

I made the changes...adding half a cup of flour and more baking soda and it worked very well. I find it much easier to chill for a bit in the fridge then roll them into balls. They turn out much more round. This is my boyfriends FAVOURITE cookie ever and mine as well

These cookies were so good.  My husband and daughter loved them too.  Just the kind of cookie I was looking for.  I also followed advice of other reviews and added half a cup more flour and 1/2 tsp. more baking soda.  They were the perfect texture, not thin at all.  I also added 1 cup more of chocolate chips because we love chocolate and I didn't think 1 cup was enough.  I will definetly make these again.  They are still soft the day after too.

I made a couple of alterations, some my own fault, but I could tell the cookie was going to be awesome!  I had a ripe banana sitting in front of me so I thought I would add that, but should've taken out the 1/2c sugar for the banana. Then I added 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of coconut in replace of walnuts cause I hate walnuts, and I added the whole thing of chocolate chips because I used mini chocolate chips.  The cookie was AWESOME...I definatly recommend the banana if you like that flavour, don't put in the raisins though lol, and take out the 1/2 cup of white sugar if you're going to put the banana in.  But VERY good.................Oct 2009 Ok I was looking to make a cookie with a little girl Im taking care of, I didn't even look in my recipe box.  So I found this one in the search and hadn't realized that I had reviewed and made this cooking before.  This time I used only chocolate chips, big ones, little ones, milk ones, semi sweet ones, and I used 2 cups of them because I still don't like Walnuts!  I used 1/2 cup applesauce and only 1/2 cup of butter, added 1/4 c of flour and 1/3c of oats.  This cookies tastes good, however I feel it tastes more like a granola bar then a cookie, still good. I wouldn't say it's the best cookie I've ever eaten in my life, but they were pretty decent.  Thanks for sharing...again!

These are our new favorite chocolate chip cookie! I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 C. more flour and 1/2 t. more baking soda. I have made these 3 times now. We love how the inside is soft and chewy and the outside is crispy. I also like how they aren't flat, but not too cakey, just right! Thanks for a great recipe Dr. Amy

So delicious! To make them extra moist I subbed half the butter with 1/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup cream cheese. I also added a little cinnamon to the flour mixture. Yum!!!

This was the first time I have made oatmeal cookies, and these are a keeper!  My husband isn't big on cookies but he devoured four cookies as soon as I took them out of the oven!  I will be making these again and again.

Yummy!! added an additional 1/4 cup cinnamon, 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate  chips a pinch of baking soda, only 1/2 cooking oats, only 1/2 granola (i didn't have enough oats) and a sprinkle of walnuts. Refrigerated it for 30 minutes and they came out perfect! next time i'll try adding some applesauce to make it a little healthier.

PERFECT cookie!!
the only thing i modified was i slightly melted the butter-- it helped keep the cookie together after baking... i even made a 2nd batch, decreased the white sugar to 1/4 cup and it didnt affect the taste!!!
used mini-chips and was even better!!  i dont prefer nuts in my oatmeal cookie.. THANKS for sharing!!

The only change I made to this recipe was to half it and I omitted the nuts.  As for the taste they were great!  But like a few other reviewers they were flat and fell apart easily.  Next time I think I will add a little more flour.

These cookies are so good!  The only change I made was to omit the walnuts.  I make half with just chocolate chips and half with raisins because my husband and I differ on which is better.  I didn't have the problem with the cookies turning out flat and have made these a few times.  I will definitely continue to make these cookies!

I have used this recipe so many times.  I switch out different chips, butterscotch, vanilla and even cinnamon chips.  They always turn out great and my husband's co-workers think I am a great baker because of these.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness, theses are so good. I generally don't like cookies but I find myself craving these constantly. I have made some modifications but only to lower the fat. I used half light olive oil and half apple sauce instead of the butter, used only a 1/4 cup of white sugar and substituted splenda brown sugar blend for the brown sugar. I liked them even more, they are very moist. I also used pecans instead of walnuts and next time will substitute raisins for the chocolate chips. Thank you so much for the amazing recipe I will be sharing them for years to come!!

What a disappointment this recipe turned out to be. They were as flat as a pancake! Unfortunately, I realized far too late that the recipe is certainly short on flour for structure. So if you do attempt this recipe, add more flour (.25 - .5 cup). Otherwise, you'll end up eating your cookies with a fork...in a bowl.

Fantastic Cookie, I have to say this is the best Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie Ever. I do a lot of baking and have tried many different oatmeal cookies but this one is Fantastic.I make a double batch to share some with family the rest gets stored in the refrig. so I can have hot cookies whenever I want or need something quick to have with guests. This is a big hit with my family and me, thanks for a Great recipe.

Followed the recipe as written except the nuts and it was delicious. I like a chewy cookie and this fits the bill!The only problem was resisting eating the dough!I printed this out to make it a keeper!

I just finished making a batch of these cookies and they turned out beautifully. They stayed almost the same shape after baking as they did raw on the cookie sheet. For those having problems with flat cookies, make sure you do not use melted butter or a butter substitute that contains water as this will make your cookies spread. In trying to make a healthier cookie I used 1/2c crunchy unsalted peanut butter and substituted 3/4c unbleached flour and 3/4c oat flour (you can find this in the organic section of your store)for the regular white flour. I omitted the white sugar and used all brown. This made a not too sweet cookie. Very good.

Good recipe.  I used 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 butter, 1 1/2 c. flour, 3 1/4 oats, 1 t. baking soda as suggested in some reviews. In other words, it just needs a little bit more flour, or a little less butter.

The best oatmeal cookies ever!  I brought it to work one day and I got comments like "Phenomenal," "Excellent!!"  I read the reviews and I followed some suggestions - I only used 2/3 cup of butter and only one egg.  Very easy to make!

I made these for my friends band and the band loved them.

The first batch of cookies were flat and crunchy, so I took JulieSam's advice.

The second batch of cookies were perfect !

Now, I make them for the band every time I see them.

I think this is the best oatmeal chocolate chip recipe. I followed in exactly (cut in half) and had some great cookies!! I set the timer and did exactly as the recipe called for, nice moist cookie, but held together.

followed recipes with some mods from other reviewers. I used 2 1/2 cups of flour, 1/2tsp of salt. Also added a small packet of instant coffee. Bake time is about 15 minutes. Came out crispy on the edges and chewy, but next day is soft and chewy. It was really good a bit too sweet, will reduce sugar next time. Thanks for sharing.

The only substitution I made was that I used whole wheat flour and these cookies turned out way too dry. I only baked them for 8 minutes in my oven and turned out soft while warm but then hardened to the consistency of granola bars once cooled. Too dry and crunchy. Will try again using all purpose flour although I'm not very optomistic.

I didn't have a recipe for chocolate chip oatmeal cookies so I decided to try the internet.  I am very glad I did.  These cookies were excellent.  Even the oven temperature was perfect for my oven.  They came out perfect.  Slightly crispy on the outside but very chewy and moist on the inside.  I will definately make them again without modifying anything.

I made a half batch of this recipe to try out on my students in my Foods Class.  These were 13 and 14 year olds who demolished the cookies I offered.  I also took some home to my 11 and 13 year old.  They loved the cookies and were fighting for more.  My husband didn't like them, but he hates oatmeal cookies.  I think it's a childhood thing.  Kids tested, mother approved.  I had to use 1/2 cup of old fashioned oats since I ran out of quick cooking.  They still tasted great and for a person who is hypoglycemic, they didn't make me sleepy.

My first try and they turned out great!  The texture and taste was definitely to my standards of a good tasting oatmeal cookie.  The only variation I added was 1 tsp of cinnamon.

Wonderful!  I made these in three ways: the original recipe; then I omitted the walnuts and chocolate chips and added toffee chips, coconut, and pecans; then on another batch I ommitted the chocolate chips for raisins.  All three came out WONDERFUL!

i served these at a party and EVERYBODY loved them (toddlers and adults alike).  only change i made was to leave out 1/2 cup of oatmeal.  they weren't exactly chewy, but they were much softer than the standard cookie.  this is definitely going to be my standard oatmeal chocolate chip recipe.

WOW!!! This IS THE BEST COOKIE EVER!!!! I thought it was good. My sister is alergic to nuts, so I baked them without the chocolate chips and the nuts. For her ofcourse. But I also added tons of diffrent chocolate chips and coconut. I also added marshmallows, I haven't tried them yet but I sure hope they are really good. Well ttyl.

These were really good, but they could use more flour, more baking soda, and less salt. At first i didn't add the chocolate chips, instead I made them without, they were just as good. If you are a Choc-o-holic, I added coconut, milk chocolate & Carmel swirled, Real Semi-Sweet & White Chocolate swirled, milk chocolate, and peanut butter chocolate chip. They were delicious and very rich. I myself could only eat 2 at the most. So that does tell you that they may last a very long time. With all the extra stuff, it made about 36 cookies. They are a lot bigger and more fluffy, the do taste really, really, really good though. Oh Yah, DO NOT DOUBLE THEM, IN A KITCHEN AID MIXING BOWL ANYWAY. IT WILL OVERFLOW.

Okay I had one scoop of dough left, so guess what, I added MARSHMALLOWS!!!!!!! It looked soooo good, it has the marshmallows sitting in thee middle of the cookie.

These are AWESOME - I make them per the instructions but omit the nuts (allergy)and double the chips. I use bittersweet chocolate chips from Trader Joe's (no milk) and they are absolutely amazing. When I know my son isn't eating them sometimes I will use half milk chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips...YUM!

YUMMY...YUM...YUM...YUM
My son's friends came over to our house yesterday and they are all chololate chip cookies fans.  I tried this recipe for the first time (with some changes as recommended by other viewers - I added 1/4 cup all purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon, I also added 1 cup of chopped dates instead of walnuts) and they just loved it.  It was crisp outside and soft in the center when we had it yesterday. I had it this morning, and it was so chewy the way I like! I just did not want to stop eating!  What a D-Li-Cious cookies!!!
Will definitely use this recipe and share with other cookies lovers.  Thanks for sharing!

I just finished making these cookies. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out excellent! I read some of the bad reviews and those people must have done something wrong. Mine were chewy and not flat at all. I cooked them for 13 minutes.

well i can't really tell how these cookies came out because my friend whose ONLY JOB it was to time the cookies, didn't take them out on time and they were too overdone. we will make this recipe again when we have more time and they should come out better and softer!  however, my friends still enjoyed dunking these in some milk!

This is the BEST oatmal cookies ever! The only thing is the original recipe is too sweet so I omitted the white sugar all together.  Turned out great after that.

Pretty good. I thought they needed more salt and maybe some cinnamon, but I'll try that next time.  The texture was good.  I used 3/4 of the butter that was called for and substituted applesauce for the rest.  I added about 2 additional Tbsp flour per other recommendations.

i love this recipe, and have made it many times. I love how the cookies don't change shape after you bake them and i love how they're not too sweet. I use less butter than the recipe calls for (1/2-3/4 cup)and i use the salted kind so i skip the teaspoon salt. I also use baby oats and raisins for these. they're SO good. thanks man =P

These came out great, I added a cup of raisins and I think it would have been better with just a bit less walnuts, but still great and the family loved them.

We make these cookies instead of regular toll house cookies. They are the best. I make half the flour whole wheat, and add some wheat germ too. Slightly healthy, but still sweet and chewy cookies. Don't overbake though, or they are really hard. A standard in our house.

This is the first recipe I tried from this site, and it's why I keep coming back.  

I was having an intense craving for a cookie I used to get while in uni. and couldn't find anything similar until I tried this (substituting shaved almonds for the walnuts).  Now, my cravings can be assuaged, and all my co-workers are hooked!

Delicious!  I added a little cinnamon and served the cookies with vanilla icecream.  It was excellent!  It reminded my boyfriend and I of the Ben and Jerry's Oatmeal Cookie Chocolate Chip Icecream.  Next time I will only add two cups of oatmeal as 3 cups seemed like a little too much.  Thanks for sharing thiss great recipe!!!

I am baking this right now and just tried one from the first batch. Ohh My GoD! Like Janice in "Friends" would say. hehe. Sooo Good! I made this with rolled oats instead of quick cooking oats, and followed the recipe exactly just the way it is! Why would you want to change it? =) It's definitely replacing my Nestle oatmeal chocolate chip cookies recipe. YumM!

These cookies were just okay for me. Mine didn't come out "chewy" like other reviewers, but they did have a nice soft texture, although they were a little on the dry side. The taste was good though. I'll probably try them again, maybe reducing the amount of oats next time.

Tried these cookies today and turned out excellent. The only change I made was scaling down the quantity to half. My kids loved them. Guess will have to make entire quantity next time. Will also substitute flour with whole wheat flour and try. Thanks a ton, Dr. Amy!

These were good.  They were definitely chewy and soft, but a little salty for my taste.  I used unsalted butter and I would decrease the salt next time.

Some of the best cookies I've ever made. I used 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, all brown sugar, and added 2 Tbsp. of my leftover brewed coffee from this a.m., and used raisins instead of walnuts. Fabulous!

So good!  Followed recipe as is except that I ground the oatmeal and added about a 1/2 cup extra chocolate chunks.  Made half w/o walnuts and half with.  Both were delicious.  Will definitely make these again.

This was one of the best cookies I've made.  My son loved it and it is so easy to make it healthier by using whole wheat flour instead of white and unrefined sugar instead of white sugar.  I also added 3/4 cup of dried cranberries.  Absolutely delicious!

These were delicious!  Added 1/4 tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp, and it turned out perfect.

WOW!!!  My daughter will finally be happy with the healthy cookie I put in her lunch box!!  Used whole wheat flower and added 1/4 cup of flax seeds.  YUMMY.  They don't look ready when you pull them out of the oven, but they are by time they've cooled off.

i've made these about 50 times--they're always amazing. i think the secret is in the amount of vanilla. sometimes i add a quarter cup of flax seeds with the choc.chips/raisins for extra homey flavor and omega 3s.

Quite good, but not perfect.  The only change that I made to the recipe was to grind the oatmeal in a blender before adding it.  Another change that I should have made was to decrease the salt.  Even after 16 minutes in the oven, my cookies never browned.  So they just don't look very nice.  But they taste very good (other than slightly too much salt).

I just finished baking a batch of these cookies.  I made slight variations to the recipe: reduced the butter slightly and substituted 1 1/2 cup quick cook oats and 1 1/2 cup old fashioned oats instead of the 3 cups of quick cook oats and I added a touch of cinnamon.  I baked the cookies for 12 minutes and removed them at that time, even though they appeared to be underdone.  To my surprise, they were completely cooked.  I did not notice the spreading problem that others mentioned, but that is probably because I reduced the butter to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup.  Overall, not a bad cookie.  I would reduce the salt in the next go around - these are a little on the salty side.  I'm sure I will not have any problem getting rid of them - my neighbors will love them :)  Thanks for the recipe!

I took Marie C.'s advice and watched my mixing time.  I also added extra flour and baking soda and ommitted the nuts.  These cookies are excellent and with the minor changes, didn't spread too much.  I'm very happy with this recipe.  Thanks for submitting it!

These cookies are sooo yummy. I used egg whites and a butter/margarine blend and they came out perfectly. These cookies spread when baked so make sure you space them out well on your baking sheet.

Keeping it real here, the texture and depth of these cookies is outstanding. I used half butter, half margarine, added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp of baking soda and refrigerated my dough and the texture was perfect! I did add extra milk chocolate chips. I'd recommend anyone do this.  I only had 1/2 cup of pecans, and that was plenty. For my last 2 batches, I added raisins and cinnamon, and those turned out the best. I may make these again, but they are definitely not my all-time favorite cookies. Had better, had worse.

these were fantastic!  i made mine with earth balance (vegan buttery spread) and used just under 1 cup of spelt flour (it is a bit heavier then all purpose flour).  i used large flake oats instead of quick oats as well.  i also used about a 1/2 brown sugar and just under a 1/2 cup white sugar. i also added 1/2 tsp baking soda and decreased the salt by 1/2 teaspoon.  so basically i changed the whole thing, ha, ha! everyone loved them, even though i tried to "health them up" :)

This is an amazingly good recipe! My family ate all of them the first night I made them. I thought I would add little variation so the next time I substituted white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts, SOOOO GOOD! I will definitely keep this recipe, now a staple in my kitchen!

this was a very good recipe, however i made a few minor adjustments. i followed some of the suggestions of a few other readers and they came out perfect. i scaled it down to 24 and had enough for pretty good size cookies. i used all brown sugar to give it more flavor, i used 2 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. i actually baked @ 375 for 10 minutes and they came out perfect. my family and co-workers loved them. this is definitely a keeper!

Made these cookies the other night and couldn't resist them.  Had to send them to work with my husband just so I wouldn't eat them.  I used milk chocolate chips and pecans as that is what I had, and they were awesome.  So chewy and yummy!

The only change I made to this recipe is I used pecans instead of walnuts (my choice). Texture: the cookies were soft and chewy. Taste: the cookies were a little disappointing. I expected it to be fancy restaurant quality. Changes: Next time, I will probably add chocolate bar pieces.

These are fantastic.  I used unsalted butter and took out the walnuts.  I did add about a Tsp. of Almond extract and about a 1/4 c. of chocolate chips.  These were so good though.  I will make them again.  I think I cooked them for 14 min. b/c they were not finished at 12 min.  Thank you!

After reading the 600+ rave reviews of this recipe, I decided to try it out with my five year old son, who wanted to make our usual peanut butter-chocolate chip cookies. I should have given in to his request. 

These cookies are not bad, but they don't live up to whatever quality everyone else touted. They are ever so slightly salty (and I halved the salt as recommended with salted butter). They are not terribly chewy, and are simply not as satisfying as you would expect a chocolate chip cookie to be. 

I'm going to stick to my old stand-by peanut butter-chocolate chip cookies and keep raisins in my oatmeals. Then everyone will be happy.

Made these cookies an hour ago and it is fantastic!!! I follow the recipe exactly except added an additional cup of mini chocolate chips in place of the nuts since my family does not like nuts.

These were awesome, not as chewy as I thought but my cookies took 20 minutes to cook not 12.  I also would reccomend for those who love chocolate use normal size chocolate chips.  I used a bag of mini chips and it just does not taste as chocolatey as regular chips.

These cookies are easy and excellent.  I used an entire bag of mini semi sweet chocolate chips, about 1/2 cup of coconut, and nuts.  Delicious!

I've made these cookies twice this week already.  They're awesome.  I suggest cutting the salt in half if you use regular butter (as opposed to unsalted butter).

Very tasty. They spread a lot so make sure to leave room on sheet. They also do better will more bitter chips not milk chocolate which is what I used.

I made these for my boyfriend the other night, and he really liked them. I substituted Splenda for the white sugar, which I usually do for my baking. I expected them to be a little chewier, but they were still good. To make cookies really chewy you need a higher brown sugar to white sugar ratio.

I baked these cookies for a pot-luck, however not a lot of people found it appealing, so only a few actually tried it. All the people who did tried it thought it was very good and asked me if they could take some on the way home.

These cookies are soft and chewy and very tasty, and they have the perfect crinkly tops that you see on bakery cookies.  I'm always looking for an awesome chocolate chip cookie recipe, and I think I've finally found one!  It's a keeper.  Thanks so much.

Great oatmeal cookies.  I added about 1/4 cup less of the white sugar, and only 3/4 cup of butter.  The cookies were still moist and flavorful.  I also cooked them for about 3 minutes longer.

If I could, I would give these 10 stars! Everyone loved them. I made a whole batch and they were gone within 24 hours! I added only half the salt as others mentioned, other than that I followed the recipe exactly (except I may have "accidentally" doubled the chocolate chips :o). These were perfect! Very, very yummy and not at all too "oaty" in my opinion.

These cookies are SUPERB! These are my boyfriend's favourite cookies and my entire family LOVES them! I've made them a number of different times using milk choc chips and milk choc chips and chopped almonds. Some variations I always make each time - always use egg whites intead of whole eggs, I triple the amount of vanilla, add about 1/8-1/4 more oats, reduce the white sugar by about 1/8 of a cup and I flatten the cookies with my fingers a bit before baking since they don't tend to spread.
They are fantastic each and every time, guaranteed!

I cannot say enough good things about these cookies.  I added mini m&m baking pieces and they turned out fabulously.  My friends and boyfriends all said that these are the best oatmeal cookies that they have ever tried.  Will be my go to cookie recipe.  Thanks!

Excellent!! I've made these A LOT and shared the recipe. They are wonderful and as promised, are soft and chewy even the day after - they don't last longer than that in our house. :)  The ONLY oatmeal choc chip recipe you need.

i'm writing the review now so that i don't have to see and be tempted by these yummy cookies.  no major modifications - just  broke up a bar of bitter chocolate (chips are hard to come by here) and reduced the salt, as suggested.  the first batch spread out more than i would've liked.  i'll definitely be making these again.

These cookies are pretty good.  Not the best I've ever had, but good for an oatmeal cookie.  I also replaced the nuts with chocolate chips.  They did have to bake for almost 20 min., though.  Maybe they were too big or something, but they were nowhere near done at 12 min.  They are still soft and chewy, though.  The neighborhood kids ate them up!

Good cookies.  I made them with Splenda and EggBeaters.  They still came out yummy.  I liked them, but may not be a big oatmeal cookie fan, because they didn't blow me away.

Delicious, I didn't have any walnuts so I added a few more choc. chips and had to add a few minutes to the baking time.  I will be making these again, and again and again.......

Really yummy and chewy, and really sweet too.  I might even cut down the sugar by maybe 1/4 cup next time.  I left out the nuts and replaced them with another cup of chocolate chips, and used 3/4 cup wheat flour and 1/2 of all-purpose in an attempt to make them a bit healthier!  Ha!  They turned out great.

This is great.  I actually made six grain cookies out of it because I didn't have any rolled oats.  I used a six grain muesli mix.  I just ground it fine in the blender.  The cookies were great and even a little healthy.  I'll make it the same way again.

These cookies are truly the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. They're sooo chewy. Instead of white flour I added an equal amount of whole wheat and also some chunks of dark chocolate. Will make again.

soo chewy and tasty!  the first time i baked them they were around the suggested time of 12 min. but the other 2 batches i've need more around 14-16 min. especially for like a golden brown color.  Also i think 1tsp of salt is too prominent.  i used 1 tsp of kosher salt (b/c of flakes vs. crystals/grain-like; less volume) and made the flavor more subtle but i guess u can use like less table salt also.

A few too many oats for my own personal liking. I think the next time I would try this recipe with 1/2 the amount of oats and 1/2 the amount of walnuts.

Yum! Cookies came out chewy with a nice brown sugar flavor. Dough was SO good (tasted better than the baked end result!).  I kept recipe the same, except decreased salt (to 1/2 tsp, based on previous reviews), used 1 1/2 c chocolate chunks instead of 1 cup chips, and used only 1/2 chopped walnuts.   Did seem like it was missing something (maybe some cinnamon or another spice?).  My cookie sheets were looking a bit tired after all the holiday baking so lined with foil & used cooking spray ~ came out great with the 12 min cooking time (and the 5 min rest period).  Will make again but tinker a bit with spices to hopefully make a 5 star cookie next time.

This recipe is very good, but of course I had to add my own personal touches.

Firstly, I have read some reviews of the cookies coming out flat.  I think this is caused by the 325 oven, not the ingredients.  My first batch came out flat at 325, so I upped the temp to 350 and they came out perfectly.  Baking at 325 melts the butter before the cookies set and begin to brown and that's what flattens them out.

The only other tweaks I made was ditching the walnuts and doubling the chocolate chunks to 2 cups (a whole bag of chips).  I also add a teaspoon of cinnamon when adding the vanilla.  I love the combo of cinnamon and chocolate, and with the oats it really makes for a delicious, soul warming cookie.

I wanted a good oatmeal recipe and saw the great reviews this one received.  I omitted the chocolate chips and added 1 cup raisins instead. The cookies are excellent.  As for the salt.  I only used half tsp at first and thought the extra salt would give them that extra something.  I added more salt and that was it! Very much like the oatmeal cookies from North Market in Columbus OH if you've ever had those.  I no longer live there so this was a great find for me.
Enjoy!

These taste good and have a nice texture (very hearty) but I had to cook them WAY longer than the suggested 12 minutes. More like 20+. They were not browned at all and were basically fell apart on picking them up even after waiting 5 minutes.

Very good.  I did have to change the cooking time to 14 minutes though..at 12 minutes they still came out raw on top.  My daughter just came by and stole one and she that they were great.

These are not only delicious but they turn out perfectly beautiful cookies, no matter what size you bake. I used unbleached all-purpose flour and used a whole bag of chocolate chips. We like a lot of chocolate and really this was just the right amount; any less would have been too little. Thanks for a keeper recipe!

What can I say?  I hardly changed a thing, just cut back a little on the salt because of what others said.  I don't think it would have made any difference.

Oh yeah, they need to cook a lot longer than 12 minutes, at least in my oven.  But the results were across the board 5 STARS from the whole family!

These cookies are 5 stars with 2 slight changes--baking time may be more than 12 minutes, for me it was more like 15, and I prefer more chocolate chips.  I'll probably go with 2 cups of chips next time.  These cookies are the kind that are better the next day than they are fresh out of the oven.  Having said that, the flavor and texture are excellent--a definite keeper for us.

These were fantastic.  I used old-fashioned oats and they are very chewy with lots of texture - just what we love.  The only thing I will use differently next time is to use mini chocolate chips as the chocolate flavor is nice, but I'd like to focus more on the oatmeal and less on the chips.  Thanks Amy!!!  Edited to add: I've made these many, many times and I like that you can vary your ingredients a bit - they are very good (but very moist) with only whole wheat flour.  I now leave the chocolate out entirely and use toasted hazelnuts!!! Mmm

These cookies were extremely well-received.  Thanks for making me look good!  I agree that they're a little bit salty, but the chewy texture (better the second day) was just what I was looking for.  I will make this again, and probably use chocolate chips and raisins and half the salt.  I was even told I should make these to sell at farmer's market.  Thanks again!

I wish I could give this more stars. I bake this for friends, parties, and my mom to take to her workplace. Works like a charm every time. People have dated me for my cookies. Just make sure you know the baking time. Sometimes, the time listed may be a tad too little or too much. But definitely one of THE BEST. For those that don't like a lot of chocolate, there's another cookie here with white chocolate chips and coconut. mmmmm

The flavor was nice, but I found that it lacked body.  Too much empty space in the cookies.  I would increase the flour and add some cornstarch.

I made these for our 4th of July camping trip.  My aunt is so picky about cookies that she rarely likes her own cookies.  However, she absolutely LOVED this recipe!  She ate more than anyone else and raved about it all weekend!!!

Mmmmmm.  Soft and chewy and just plain delicious!  Wonderful flavor, texture...all!!  EDIT:  Tried making these again with some of the tips from the reviews (specifically using 1 3/4 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda and only 1/2 teaspoon salt...and chilling them for 15 minutes before baking).  I thought they tasted the same, but I didn't really feel like there was a difference in the rising so so many reviewer said.  They were still relatively thin cookies, but equally delicious.  I did cook them on parchment paper, which really helps keep them soft/chewy.  They were even as delicious day 2 and still pretty good/soft (although not AS good) day 3, which is a huge plus for me!

very good cookies: I greatly appreciate that they are REALLY chewy and do not get hard and dry after they cool.
I didn't put nuts but mixed the chocolates: half bitter and half milk.
they sure won't get the worse with raisins, I think!

WOW! Just what the Dr. ordered.  Thank you Dr. Amy. Nice chewy consistancy.  This is a 5 star even though I altered a little.  I used dark brown sugar, half the salt due to I used salted butter and I added raisin to this as well.  If baking with a stone its takes about 15 minutes or until slightly golden underneath.  These do not last long people like to gobble these.

I cut the recipe in half, used 1/4 c walnuts, 3/4 c milk chocolate chunks and 1/4 c white chocolate chunks. They were amazing! The best Oatmeal Chocolate cookies I've ever baked!! The next time I bake them though, I think I'll cut back on the oatmeal just a tiny bit. Even my boyfriend, who hates Chocolate chip cookies, ate 3 right out of the oven :-) Thank you Dr Amy!

These cookies were delicious!!! When I scribbled down the recipe, I missed the baking soda in it, and figured that the recipe had called for 1 teaspoon of it, so that's what I added.  Also, I started with 1/2 teaspoon salt, then increased it to 3/4 teaspoon (just for personal preferences).  I spilled some extra vanilla in the dough, so it probably ended up being closer to 1 tablespoon (3 teaspoons) instead of 2 teaspoons. I was out of quick-cooking oats, so I used old-fashioned rolled oats, 3 cups, and it turned out fine.  For the people who are mentioning the batter being really runny, it could be the butter you are using.  In general, I always use real butter in my cookies, which I think makes a big difference.  If you use margarine, though, experts I have read say that you should always look for a margarine with 70% fat in it to bake with, otherwise your cookies will be watery and runny.  Tub margarines are especially prone to this problem, since most of them have less fat than stick margarines. Overall, I found the cookies to be chewy on the inside, crisp around the edges and overall good tasting.  I do sometimes add some cinnamon or some cloves to my oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, but these really did not need them, in my opinion, especially with the extra vanilla I accidentally added.

These were very tasty..but I must have done something wrong because they were very fragile and fell apart easily. I had to store them in the fridge just to keep them from falling apart.

These are excellent cookies!  I made them about double the size suggested, and took them out of the oven when they had just become golden (still pretty uncooked inside), and let them sit on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.  They came out perfectly chewy!

These cookies were so simple to make, yet were full of great taste.  They were a big hit at work and with the family!  The only twist I threw on these cookies were nixing the nuts because I'm not a big nut fan.  Other than that these cookies get my best rating!

I used 2 1/2 cups of raw (not quick-cooking) oats instead of 3 cups, and just over 1 cup of pecans (instead of walnuts). Bake 15 mins at 335 degrees on an air sheet. Crispy outside, chewy inside. EXCELLENT!

This recipe was delicious. I used a 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips and a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet Chocolate Chips. Also, my husband is not a nut fan so I omited the nuts and added a little extra oatmeal instead. They were a very dense, tasty cookie! I'll definatly make them again.

What can I say. It does not smell incredible when I blended evrything in. But my first bit!!! Oh My God !!! This is it! SO soft,chewy, and sweet. A the first place I could not round it together. I am kind of afriad it is too greasy, so I just decide add one cup of oatmeal. But after baking, it is just right.Thank you , Dr Amy!  No wonder you are called as Dr.

These were very good. The only changes I made was that I put about 1/2 cup more chocolate chips and I cooked them for 14 minutes. I will use chopped pecans next time in place of the walnuts since I like them better. I was a bit disappointed from all the rave reviews. These were good cookies but they were not "amazing".

Yum! Made these today with my 4 year old.  We both love them.  Didn't have walnuts, so used pecans. I like feeling like the cookies have some wholesomeness to then from the oats, rather than regular chocolate chip cookies.

I made one batch of these as is, and another with raisins and cinnamon, omitting the chocolate chips and nuts. Both were pretty good. This is just under five stars because I thought there may have been a bit too much oatmeal, which took away from the cookies' appearance. That's a minor complaint, though, and who cares as long as they're tasty?

Absolutley the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I've EVER made! So chewy and the walnuts make it even better. I usually leave them in for 10 minutes instead of 12, because I like my cookies EXTRA chewy. But that's just my personal taste. Will make these over and over again :)

Pretty good flavour, altho I think there's a bit too much salt and oats.  Cooking time was slightly off for me, I cooked them 14 mins otherwise they were a bit raw in the middle.  Didn't use nuts as I was out, and subsituted milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

How is this recipe getting 5 stars??? I had to modify this recipe a few times and STILL didn't "go crazy" over them.  Tried adding spice, and changed the temperature, plus tried throwing the dough in the fridge, ETC. I just have to go with a whole other recipe - Sorry! Tastless and not a real good chewyness... Two stars is generous.

These cookies are easy to make and delicious too!  I'm on a mission to cut out store-bought treats for my kids, so this recipe is a welcome addition to my favorites.  I didn't change a thing, made the whole recipe, cooked half, froze the other half in little balls to be used another time.  Thanks!!!

This is the first highly rated recipe from this site that I have not enjoyed.  I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of omitting the walnuts due to an allergy).  I thought the cookies were rather salty given the fact they were cookies.  Also, they were rather flat.  As I used a brand new box of baking soda, I know that the issue isn't that.  I'll keep looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe.

Beware...These are Dangerous!!! They were so easy to make, and OH SO MEGA-YUMMY!!! My roommates and I could not get enough of them... Really, we just couldn't stop eating them! I used baking powder instead of baking soda, and rolled oats instead of quick ones (didn't have any). Had to bake them a bit longer, but they were amazing! Next time I think i'll add some raisins though...

I really did not like how these cookies turned out. The texture and taste did not equal a 5 star rating in my book. I will stick with my mom's chewy oatmeal cookie recipe for now.

perfect recipe!  Chewy and chunky.  I froze most of them into balls and stored them in freezer bags, they baked up so well.  During the superbowl party I served them towards the end and everyone was wondering when I had time to wip up these awesome cookies!

The best oatmeal cookie I have ever had!!  I followed the recipe to a tee, except I ran out of light brown sugar and had to use about 1/4 c dark brown.  Soft, chewy, and just the right amount of chocolate.  
Thanks Dr Amy!

These were delicious, especially the next day! Very chewy and filling. Maybe use a little less vanilla next time though. I used only half the butter and substituted in a mashed up banana to cut out some fat, they were still very moist! I also skipped the nuts and put in an extra half a cup of choc. chips, mmmmmmmmmmm. Thanks for the recipe!

These were nice, chewy cookies as promised. I used margarine, added a cup of dried cranberries as suggested by another, and omitted the nuts due to allergies.I baked them on my stoneware at 350 for 8-10 minutes until just golden,and let them cool on the sheet for about 5 minutes.

Yummy!!  I was out of oatmeal but substituted Muesli (with raisins this time), left out the walnuts, and added an additional cup of chocolate.  These were great, and the muesli gave it a crispiness that went well with the overall chewiness of the cookie. Mmmmmmmmmmmm!

These are quite good! I added 1/2 cup more chocolate chips-and could probably use another 1/2 cup if you're a chocolate lover like me! My husband and little cousin went nuts over these- I will def. make these again.

THIS IS A GREAT TASTING COOKIE!!!  I modified it slightly and omitted the walnuts and added another 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and WOW!  I baked for 13 minutes and let sit on the cookie sheet for 5 (just like the recipe suggested) and they turned out perfect!  I thought I would miss the cinnamon and didn't at all. I used Hershey's Milk Chocolate Chips which were fabulous in the recipe.  Enjoy, and thank you Dr Amy for submitting such a great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I doubled the recipe, cut down on the salt due to a couple of other reviews saying that the cookies were too salty, substituted raisins for walnuts, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon (use 1/2 teaspoon for original recipe).  I ended up baking for 13 minutes using a dark, non-stick tray... seemed to do the trick!  Thanks!

These are delicious - and so easy to make.  I measured out my ingredients first, and I think it took less than 1/2 hour from start to finish.  I would definitely make these again.

I'm not the best baker, but these turned our yummy! A little too soft, some fell a part but since I made them for the office holiday party, my husband was happy to eat the broken pieces! I also had to omit the nuts, so that may be why.
Otherwise, a nice, moist/soft cookie. Could use a bit of spice (cin.?) though.

I love oatmeal and I love chocolate chip cookies so this was a great combo!!  I added more chocolate chips and didn't add walnuts because I don't like them.  I used dark brown sugar instead of light because that's what I had on hand and I think next time I'll cut down the amount of brown sugar by half or at least by a quarter because it was a bit too sugary but aside from that, it was so soft and chewy.  Really great!

Very good.  Very chewy cookies.  It is a little too sweet for me.  But everyone else at my work place said it is perfect for them.  Cookies were all gone right after I put them out.  Good flavor.  Oh, I have no more chocolate chips, so I use raisins instead.  Please note, I found cake flour would bring the cookies to be more silky taste then all purpose flour.  For future cookies tester, please try it!

This recipe was too salty. My sister and I tried making them for my nephews preschool class and were dissapointed. Perhaps we should have used unsalted butter. Also they were very runny.

These cookies were Great! My boyfriend took them to work with him and the guys loved them. The only thing i did diffrent was sub an extra cup of chocolate chips in place of the walnuts... we just aren't crazy about walnuts. Thank you Dr.Amy.

These were just awesome! My first batch came out a little flat but after refrigerating the rest of the dough, the next couple of batches came out better. There is enough dough to freeze and make more cookies later. Just delicious!

The recipe calls for too much salt- I wonder if the recipe has salt and baking soda amount mixed up.  Too greasy and could possibly need more flour.

The best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I've ever made!  I used mini M&M's that I had bought for another recipe but never used, instead of chocolate chips, and they tasted good and were nice and colorful.

This is a pretty good recipe.  It wasn't exactly what I was looking for though.  I had to increase the baking time to about 18 minutes, otherwise they were too soft and messy. They still turned out quite chewy and soft.  Also, I added white chocolate chips and cranberries instead of semisweet chips and walnuts, which everyone loved.

Very good - Thank you.  I will definately make again.  If you want crunchier cookies increase baking time. If you want chewier, decrease baking time.  The only thing I did different was used 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1-1/4 cup brown - as brown sugar tends to make a shofter cookie.  Also, make sure you leave them to cool on the sheet before you remove them (like she said) or you will have a mess..

Great taste and texture.  I only made a few modifications:  2 c. chocolate chips, no nuts.  Also, baking at 350 degrees. worked better.  325 ended up taking 17 minutes, whereas at 350, they were ready in 12 minutes.

They taste great and are chewy.  Next time, I think I will add some cinnamon for a little extra zing!

Oh man, these taste SOOO good, I am going crazy eating them. Anyway, they were easy to make and they are chewy. They fall apart a bit, but I pretty much expect that with Oatmeal cookies.

I don't know what all the fuss is about for these cookies, but they were way too soft. I made them in heaping spoonfuls like it said to do, but I only left them in for the 12 minutes and they never really set after coming out of the oven. The flavor was good, but I won't be making these again.

This was a great recipe!! Just what I was looking for, even tho I didn't realize I didn't have chocolate chips til I went to find them. I ended up adding a cup and a half of chopped chocolate almond bark, and it was STILL great. I chilled about half the batch overnite because it was getting late, and they came out even better today after rolling the dough into 1-1/2 inch balls and baking for 15 minutes...will definitely make these again!

I liked these cookies alot. If you are looking for just a chewy oatmeal cookie this is not the recipe for you. With the chocolate chips and nuts(I added peanut butter chips instead) you really don't taste much oatmeal. They are great though. The way I made them you have oatmeal, chocolate and peanut butter in the same cookie. Yum!

Next time I will use less oatmeal (maybe 2C), more chocolate chips (1 1/2 C) and cook them 5 minutes longer.  Thank I think they'll be 5 stars!

This was one of the best cookie recipes I have ever made.It is very easy to make and cooks pretty quick.I sugggest if you have a gas stove to set the degrees at 300 instead of 325.

One of the best cookie recipes I have ever come across! The only change I made was to omit the walnuts and add about 1/2 cup of extra chocolate chips. Thought these were excellent...you do have to eat them within a few days though as they started to get dry by the 3rd day!!

I never baked cookies before and these were easy and delicious!! I am not big on oatmeal/chocolate combinations so i just substituted the chips and nuts for raisins, and I also added cinnamon to the recipe. The only thing I would do differently next time is maybe substitute the butter with yogurt or applesauce to make them healthy, as they were VERY buttery cookies.

I have made better chocolate chip oatmeal cookies.  I thought these dried out quickly and were a little too oat-ey for me.  I like a little more dough and a little less oats.

This was great!
I took the total of ingredients added to the cookies (chocolate chips and walnuts) and added that same amount of coconut, milk chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and chopped macadamia nuts. Incredible!

My family and I thought that cookie was pretty bland. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg; they are essentials for oatmeal cookies. Also substituted chocolate chips for butterscoth chip and added raisins. After that, cookie was perfect!

I also modified this recipe slightly. I used 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 tsp baking soda, added a little cinnamon and substituted raisins for the nuts. It's to die for! I left them in the suggested 12 minutes and they turned out perfect. Enjoy! *EDIT* I also put the mixture in the fridge for a bit before baking and while I was cooking a batch.

These cookies are so good!  Crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  I had a lot of white chocolate chips so mixed in white chocolate chips, then divided the dough and added butterscotch chips to half and chocolate chips to the other half.  The butterscotch/white chocolate/oatmeal combination was to die for.

These cookies were very good. Very light and fluffy. Some of them fell apart though.

I used white chocolate chips and it made them very sweet (and very yummy).

Excellent oatmeal cookie recipe... I didn't realize until after I came back to review the recipe that I only used 1/2 cup of butter, and they came out fine.  I put my oatmeal through the food processor to make it finer, I just think it tastes better this way.

I absolutely LOVE these cookies! They are chock full of delicious ingredients; I will never make a plain chocolate chip cookie again! I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, and used 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips ( along with 1/2 cup semisweet chips), I also substituted pecans for the walnuts...YUM! However, I had to bake them longer(14-15 minutes)THANKS DR. AMY!!!

Pretty good, but not fabulous.  I too used 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp salt.  I would use more chocolate chips (maybe 1 1/2 cups).  My husband liked the ones that were more salty (I guess I didn't mix the salt in well enough!).

Very good and chewy.  12 minutes of cooking the cookies don't look ready they still looked wet in the middle and they don't brown easily.  I cooked them for 14 mins.ish.  They were barely brown but they were cooked.  Everyone liked them a lot.  Will make again, I might try substituting yogurt for the butter, which would make them way healthier.  michele, cambridge, ontario

Outstanding cookie with some changes for the chocolate lover...NO NUTS!!!  Used only 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 3/4 cups flour, 2 1/2 cups of oats, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Then added 1 1/2 cups of semisweet choc.chips w/o any nuts instead of 1c chips/1c nuts.  I also scooped hefty tablespoon sized cookies that resulted in 3+ doz. crispy, but soft and chewy cookies.

These cookies are a great and easy snack to make.  I did however make some of my own little tweeks to the recipe.  I did not use any walnuts because I prefer cookies without them.  Next time I would add more chocolate chips because I really love chocolate!  I also tried something with them a few days after baking them.  I put a few in the microwave for about 15 seconds, to make them chewy again (like when they were just baked).  I am definitely going to make these cookies again.

These cookies are the absolute best that I have ever tasted.  It is usually quite difficult to make chewy chocolate chip cookies.  Most of the recipies that I have found, are very difficult and finicky, requiring a lot of work, for mediocre results.  Now that I've tried this recipe, I will never use another one.  Both myself and my boyfriend love these cookies, as well as everyone at my work, and his whole family! I've already passed on the recipe to several other people.  Thanks a bunch!

These cookies are awesome.  I did not have enough chocolate chips, so I added butterscotch chips--which was a nice variation.  They turned out great. My boyfriend told me awhile ago he didn't like oatmeal cookies, but he has been eating a lot of these. Thanks for sharing.

This is one of the best cookies I ever had. I like the others added 1 1/2 cups of flour. I had no nuts, so I used white Chocolate Chips instead. So I had two types of Chocolate in them. They are just so yummy.I know they will do good in my bake sale at work.

My family liked these cookies even though I was not that crazy about them.  I followed the recipe except added chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  The first batch I made too big and had to cook the cookies longer which made them not so soft.  The other batched came out pretty good.  I will make this again if my family askes other wise I'll try something else.

These turned out great. The kids weren't crazy about them ~ as they are not big chocolate chip fans (nor am I).  I decided to give it a try anyways. I had some of the cookies and I did enjoy them. The kids had very little.
None the less, I will keep this recipe for the hubby who gobbled them up.

This was good but I halved the recipe and then lost track of how much extra oats, baking soda and flour to put in to make this work. Ended up putting one extra Tbsp flour, 1/2 cup extra oats, and 1/2 tsp baking POWDER.   Dough didn't spread much and was delicious, but Hubby thought it had a tad too much oats so I'll modify that next time.  Also, for my tastebuds, I'll add 1 tsp allspice or pumpkin spice to it and add a bit more sugar to make up for the extra oats and flour.  I thought the flavor could use just a touch spicing up.

These were great! I also followed the advice to use 1.5 cups of flour, 1/2 t salt and 1 t baking soda. I ran out of vanilla (the horrors!) and was only able to put 1 t in the cookies. It still turned out great! thanks Amy

I have been searching for a good oatmeal cookie recipe and this one is the best I've found so far.  I was hoping for a cookie with more density, but my friends devoured them.  I'll make them again.

Wow, these cookies are really good. Didn't change the recipe but used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet(only had milk chocolate) Just the right chewyness and crunch. Thanks Dr.Amy!

The taste was great, but they spread so much!  Normally, I like a more dense cookie, but we improvised and used these to make the most amazing ice cream cookie sandwiches ever - YUM!!

These cookies were MUCH better the next day than they were right out of the oven.  In the future, I will probably substitute shortening for the butter and add a bit more flour to thicken up the dough.  I found the just-baked cookies to be very gooey, so much so that they didn't even hold a good cookie shape on the pan and turned into little puddles of cookies instead.  However, and they're thoroughly cooled they're quite tasty.

Wonderful! I shaved my own chocolate using baking bars instead of the chips. Very yummy! Husband is used to the clove taste with the store bought cookies, so i will probably add some of some next time.

I tried this first on my boyfriend. He looked at them strangely at first but then devoured the whole batch that day. He loved them! I've since taken them to the office, given them to friends . . . all a success! And I'm not much of a baker, but they think I am.

These cookies are good, I added a little cinnamon to spice it up.  They weren't cake like either and that's good.  Great recipe!

Oh man - this is the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe EVER.  I used a full bag of chocolate chips and added a little cinnamon and they came out perfect!  YUM.
