This was great with one very important addition - I added about 1/4 stick melted butter to the spices, and brushed it on (used 3 bagels).  Baked them at 375 for about 15 minutes - they were just like giant bagel croutons!  Will make again!

Very nice little bagel bites.  I like them crispy and I wanted to make sure the seasonings would stick, so I tossed the bites into a bowl, added some olive oil and tossed until they were coated.  Then I did the same thing with the seasonings (what can I say--I'm lazy and messy and I hate sprinkling things).  It worked perfectly.  5 minutes wasn't crispy enough for me, so I did another 5 for a total of 10 minutes.  10 minutes was almost too long for the smaller and thinner pieces I managed--they were very brown, but very nice and crispy. I used cheese bagels that were about ready to give up the ghost, and they were perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty good, not spicy what so ever, but good.  I sprayed them with butter flavored pam before sprinkling the seasonings on.  They worked great with the BLT dip, and a good way to use up those bagels, thanks Sara!

Yummy snack. I mixed the seasoning and tossed all in a ziplock bag to coat evenly.

Awesome little treat! Plus it's a great way to use up the last of the stale bagels!  These are delicious all by themselves, but are even better with your favorite dip.  Thanks for the great recipe, sal!

Mmmmm. My whole family loved these. I added a pinch of cayene pepper to the spices which added an extra spicyness. Great recipe!

This was a very good snack! I used onion bagels for mine, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. They were finished in exactly 5 minutes, and I had no problem with them holding the spice topping. They had a great flavor, and I'm sure I will make them again and again.

Mmm, these are a great snack, and I always have a freezer full of leftover bagels. My husband asked me to make up a whole bunch so we always have some on hand. My 2 year old daughter loves them too.

Wow! Not too spicey and not bland. We loved these. I, too, thought the melted butter might add another dimension. Thanks Sara!

These were great! Ate them with spinach dip. I added some sesame seeds. Don't know that I would snack on them by themselves, but they made a great dipper.

I really didn't care for this recipe at all. I sprayed some butter flavored cooking spray on the bagels since it seemed like there should be something there for the seasonings to stick to. When all was said and done, there just wasn't much flavor to them, and most of them ended up getting thrown out.

I doubled all the spices EXCEPT the chili powder. To make the spices stick better to the bagels, I threw them in a bowl, drizzled them with EVOO and then sprinkled the spices over the oiled bagel pieces. I then laid them out on a foil lined baking sheet and baked them golden brown. VERY addictive.

I was really disappointed with these. I had a lot of difficulty slicing the bagels thinly - works a little better if the bagels are slightly frozen, but not much. The spicy cheese topping was pretty tasty, but it really didn't melt down nor stick to the bits of bagel; I would definitely recommend mixing in some butter or maybe even a little mayo. Still, there's no way I'll be making these again. Thanks anyway.

You need to make sure to get lots of the seasoning on each piece or it's not very spicy. I omitted the salt and added a touch of cayenne.

These were fantastic! So easy to make and super quick (and cheap). Great little side dish for a big meal. The only things I'd like to mention would be: one-- I'm not sure why these are called "spicy" bagel bites, because they weren't spicy at ALL (and I have a SUPER SUPER low spice tolerance), and two--mine took more like 10 minutes in the oven, but the cook did say until lightly browned, and my oven is terrible. Plus, that's just a preference thing anyway. Anyway, these were super yummy and I will definitely be making them again!
