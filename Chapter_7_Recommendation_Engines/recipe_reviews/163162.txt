Fantastic spring time dish!  It does work best to keep the pot covered when you add the chicken stock and also when you add the remaining ingredients.  This way there is some liquid left when you add the parmesan and you don't need to add any more chicken stock.  I will definately make this again!

Probably my favorite main-dish recipe of all time. I often make it with chicken sausage instead of grilled chicken strips, and it is always such a hit. Sam's Club sells a chicken-spinach sausage that is perfect for this recipe. Enjoy!

This was very easy and very good.  I woud alter next time in a couple of ways - a little red pepper flakes and I would substitute pine nuts for the pecans.  The pecans were interesting but pine nuts seem better suited to the dish.

Really liked this recipe. My husband, who really is picky about his chicken dishes, thought this was great. I did substitute pesto in place of the basil leaves, as I did not have fresh basil and the stuff at the store looked a bit less than fresh. Turned out great. Thanks for a super recipe.

Great dish- family loved it! Used Havarti cheese instead of parmesan- it melts better, and toasted the pecans while I was grilling the chicken

Awesome! Absolutely the best dish we have made from this site. I would not change anything. Next time I might try breaking the pecans up so that I get more in every bite. Also we roasted the pecans in the oven before adding them but it would be good even without the nuts.

Great great dish.  We made it for some friends that are getting married in 4 days.  Very easy to prepare, and very filling.  We doubled the recipe actually, and sent the remainder (which was quite a bit) home with them for the rest of the week so they didn't have to cook.  Yea, it was that much.

The only thing I would do differently is cut down the amount of Penne noodles the recipe calls for.  The dish itself is so good, that you end up looking for a fork full without the noodles.  They work well together, but I will probably use half the noodles next time.

Fabulous!  Quick and easy with great flavor!  Will definitely make again.  Husband and I really liked the addition of the pecans.  You can add any veggies that you like and season it to your individual taste.  We loved it just as is!

this is wonderful!. LOVE IT SO MUCH! I made it once, exactly as written, and it was fantastic.  The next time, due to my limited chicken, I used 1 chicken breast and about 3/4 cup smoked sausage, sliced, and it was amazing with the sausage addition.  This is a wonderful go-to recipe that I am so glad that I found!

I found this recipe to be bland. I actually put a tablespoon of freshly minced garlic and everyone thought it could still use alot more. I also thought some red pepper flakes could have helped. I gradually added the parmesan cheese and it didn't blend in very nicely. I thought the pecans were a nice touch, but they kind of freaked my sister out when she thought it could possibly be a hard piece of chicken. I think the next time I would make it without the chicken, maybe just toss the parmesan on at the end rather than trying to blend it in and definitely add more spices.

We're not big pasta eaters so this recipe was just okay, not great.  I really liked having pecans in the recipe.   If I make it again I will probably use more asparagus and less pasta.

My husband said this recipe was "outstanding!"  I substituted sun-dried tomatoes for the red bell pepper and pine nuts for the pecans because that's what I had on hand, but it made a really good blend of seasonings.  This is a great dish to make if you've got some leftover grilled chicken breasts from another meal.  We'll definitely be making this recipe again and again!

Delicious!  I had 6 people coming for dinner, everyone loved it and most had a second helping!  This was extremely easy to make.  I did add mushrooms and used Farfalle pasta instead of Penne.  I also happened to have quite a bit of leftover chicken that I cooked in the slow cooker the previous night, so I used that instead of the breast strips.  This is a nice, fairly healthy meal that I most certainly will make again.

Classic flavours make a recipe that is simple and satisfying. I would usually order this in a restaurant but now I will make it at home. I used fresh broccoli instead of asparagus and fresh boneless chicken breasts sauteed in garlic instead of the chicken strips.

Really good. I used a 14 oz can of chicken broth instead of a cup and would love to add canned artichoke hearts diced. Also felt a little less pasta would be better. Made a ton!!

This was very good!  I added a lot of fresh veggies because we lacked them over the weekend. ;)  I used asparagus, green beans, baby carrots, spinach.  I used leftover chicken, but didn't have a lot so added a can of black beans for more protein.  My 5 year old twins LOVED it, as did hubby and I.

Delicious and smelled wonderful as it was roasting. I added onions to the body and did not use the butter, just the bacon. Moist and tender. I'll make it again!

Delicious!  I only used one bunch of asparagus this time, but next time I will go ahead and use two like the recipe calls for.  Cayenne pepper on the side for people who like a little heat is a great option also.

This is a great, fresh tasting pasta recipe.  It is especially nice in that it goes together quickly if you do a little chopping ahead.  I forgot to add the pecans. Will add those when we eat the leftovers.

I used chicken the first time I made this recipe, but opted for Italian Turkey Sausage the 2nd time & WOW!! SO GOOD! I wasn't a big fan of the pecans, so I usually leave them out, but that's just my preference. It's a very good recipe as is, and can be tweaked to your liking easily.

This was a good recipe but I made some modifications.  I added about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes and 8oz sliced portobello mushrooms.  Next time I'll wait and sprinkle the cheese after serving.  It all stuck to the spoon and the bottom of the pan.  What a mess! BUT! It was a hit and everyone liked it.  I too added another 1/2 cup broth...I wanted it more saucy.

This was soooo yummy!!!!  I made it tonight when i was the only one home so I wouldn't have to listen to the kids complaining about the asparagus and nuts.  I think the only change I would do next is a little less parm...it was a little too much for me!!!  Very, very tasty!  Thank you for sharing!

Had this for dinner last night and this was very easy to make. I made exactly as directed but next time I will increase the garlic. Like another review, I would like this to be more 'saucy'. Will definitely experiment with that. I will make this often as i believe it is a very good recipe. The pecans really add to the flavor of this recipe. Would not leave them out.

This recipe is a winner!  Both my husband and I loved it.  It makes a large batch so we'll probably have enough for two more meals.  i can't wait to bring it to a potluck supper at church.  Thanks for posting this recipe Julie!

I made this last night for my boyfriend and his    family! Everyone raved about it!! I used red pepper flakes instead of red peppers, also used broccoli instead of asparagus. I did use a whole can of chicken broth like some others suggested. Turned out great! Will for sure make again!

My kids went crazy over this.  I left the pecans out for them but I enjoyed them.  I left out 1/2 cup of the parmesan and think one bunch of asparagus is enough (and keeps the cost down)

This dish is not only delicious - but it's also presents very well. FYI - it's even better the next day (I saved a bit of the pasta water to add before reheating to prevent dryness and it worked like a charm). Definitely a keeper!!!

Wow wow wow.....this was SO good!!!  I ommitted the pecans because we didn't have any and used frozen basil from last year's garden....it was delicious.  I also used 8 oz of pasta and it was just the right amount.  This will be on the menu often!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I NEVER make comments on dishes I try, but this was OUTSTANDING! My husband could not get enough! It makes a good bit-at first I thought that I had made too much pasta, but it turned out just fine adding in the whole box (13 oz box and we used whole wheat). I also did not have any fresh basil on hand, so I used dried basil (about 2-3 tbls) and it was wonderful. This is a definite keeper!

This was delicious. My husband and daughter ask for it all of the time now. A bit of advice- use real parmesan, and don't skip the pecans! This has become one of our favorites.

I made this a while back for my mom. It was nice, but nothing terribly special. The sauce was a bit watery and it needed some additional seasonings.

Well, I had a difficult time with this one, but maybe it was my own fault.  I thought I'd get a head start on dinner and I prepped everything in advance, planning to put it all together just before dinner and re-heat.  I cooked my asparagus and peppers separately and removed them from the pan, because I didn't want them to lose their vibrant color.  I toasted my pecans in a skillet with just a little butter, then gave them a tiny pinch of salt.  I thought I could make the sauce ahead and that's where my problems began.  I added the chicken broth to the pan I had used to saute the red pepper, then the basil and then the parmesan.  I did think this called for an excessive amount of parmesan.  I was using a good quality Parmigiano-Reggiano but it just got stringy and gloppy in the broth, so much so that I ended up straining my broth to get rid of it.  The parm had absorbed a lot of the liquid, so I ended up adding a little over 1/2 cup of additional chicken broth and added a glug of white wine.  I thickened it with a little corn starch and added the rest of the ingredients.  Surprisingly it turned out quite well and I would make it again, but I would add the parmesan after plating as a garnish.

Add more broth (entire 14 oz. can or more). I thickened sauce with cornstarch. Also think it would be good with cashews!

Light tasting, yet very filling (and pretty to look at too). I added mushrooms, but followed the recipe exactly and was quite happy with the results. Makes a LOT of food for just two people. Yum!

LOVED this - it has become a favorite of my boyfriend's. We're not big red pepper or pecan fans - so we make it without. I bake the chicken in aluminum foil with a mixture of butter, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and basil flakes. Much easier to throw it all together and not dirty another plate. Highly recommended!

This was a very hearty and tasty meal.  The only change I would make is add a little more chicken broth with flour (to thicken up the sauce) and replace the pecans with pine nuts.

Very good.  I did make a couple of changes but more  in amounts of measurements.  I did add fresh mushrooms,used chicken thighs, , doubled the broth and would thicken next time with a little cornstarch, only 1 bunch of asparagus.  my personal taste is to under cook veggies because I like a little snap and the asparagus was too cooked for me but my husband loved the aspargus.  He said he would have eaten the rest of the dish by himself if the sauce was thicker.   thank you

Awesome recipe - a hit with kids, big kids and adults alike. Due to cost, I used only once bunch of asparagus and one cup of parmesan, and at the last minute realized I'd forgotten the pecans -- still delicious. Can't rave enough about this recipe! Thank you!

This recipe is Awesome!  However I did make some changes.  I used roasted red peppers, mushrooms and increased the stock to a can and a half.  Of course since the broth was increased the cheese is increased.  Oh yeah then I added sliced smoked sausage, as someone else recommended, which brought out tremendous flavor.  I will definitely make this again and again!!  Thanks for the recipe.

this was a tasty little dish.  very simple especially as i had bought fresh spaghetti.  i added a few mushrooms and more garlic as always and made one and 1/2 times the actual sauce and added a few panko crumbs before adding spaghetti to thicken a bit.  quick dish.

delicious!!!!!!  the only changes I made was to add a 14 oz. can of chicken broth instead of just a cup and I used toasted walnuts instead of pecans because it's what I had on hand.  (I also used whole wheat pasta to make it a little healthier) THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!   This will definitely become a regular in my house - it was so easy to make - easy clean up - and enough leftovers for lunch for me and my boyfriend the next day.  (that's after we both had two servings for dinner because it was SO yummy).   Thank you for this recipe - it's a keeper!!!!

This was awesome! Added the pepper flakes (about 2 tsp), as some suggested and doubled the pepper, freshly ground..This was a huge hit! My husband even asked to take some of the leftovers to work today for lunch!

This was really good. I used dried basil, spaghetti pasta, omitted the pecans, and used only 1 tbsp. of butter. Served the cheese on the side instead of stirred in. Delicious and will be making again!

Wow. Just gorgeous, both to look at and to eat. I did substitute quite a few ingredients, simply to use what I had, but I think the main flavors are close enough to the recipe to warrant a review. I used cheese filled tortellini, sun dried tomatoes instead of red bell pepper, and added artichoke hearts I needed to use up. Added a smidge of red pepper flakes. Used walnuts instead of pecans. Topped with some chopped green onions at the end which worked really well. When simmering the veggies, make sure not to let too much of the stock evaporate, you want that liquid for the sauce. I needed to add a bit of water back in and then covered it. Oh, I used about half the butter. Next time I think a squirt of lemon juice would be perfect. Man this was good.

Oh, I loved this! I found it very easy to make, and delicious.  I used boiled chicken, omitted the salt and cut the cheese down to about 1 C, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Actually, when I pulled out the leftovers to heat the next day, I tasted and decided that I like it even better chilled!  That being the case, I will probably make it with that intent next time and substitute additional olive oil for the butter, to keep it from becoming sticky.  Anyway, hot or cold, it is great!

The more we ate it the more we liked it.  A little bland but overall a keeper.  My husband thought black olives would be good in it.

I must agree with those that said it was bland, I threw in a handful of mixed Italian spices and that helped. I did think that it improved with age, the 3rd day I tried it again and it was pretty tasty.

This is exactly what I was hoping for, delicious. I skipped the pecans because my daughter is allergic to them (I can't imagine what it would taste like with them.) I also added a little extra chicken broth like a previous review suggested and used dried basil, paprika & added some garlic powder. My husband & I both sprinkled extra Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes to our plates. My husband said it was restaurant quality. I will definitely be making this again.

I didn't think this would be very good because there didn't appear to be much of a sauce. Well, I was mistaken because the broth, butter and melted cheese made for a well flavored coating. Not a bread dipping sauce but still tasty.

Using some of your suggestions, I added mushrooms and red pepper flakes for a little heat. Because it's January, I used the pesto rather than basil.  It was terrific!  Next time I might add spinach leaves

Fabulous! Have made it for family and friends a few times and they LOVED it. I use less pasta than called for, and I add the juice of 1/2 lemon to the chicken and veggies.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I have made it twice.  I changed nothing except that instead of grilled chicken, I stir fried 2 diced chicken breasts in my wok for a few minutes, removed them and then added some more canola oil and started with the veggies, adding them to the wok right after I added the penne to the boiling water.  Penne took 12 minutes so the timing worked out perfectly.  Thanks!

A tad bland even after adding crushed red pepper flakes.  I think the sauce needs something.  I read the other reviews and did add more broth.  I also stirred in 3 wedges of Laughing Cow cheese to melt into the hot broth.  Might benefit from a little lemon juice and/or white wine.  We liked it.  I'll make it again.

I did make some changes but suspect this would be great with any number of changes or none at all.  We have one vegetarian, so I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (also added the cooked chicken last so I could serve some without).  I added a little cajun seasoning and a bit of red pepper flakes.  I was pretty liberal with the amounts of ingredients as well as I was fudging a slightly larger batch and I frequently don't measure.  Lastly, I toasted the pecans with some shelled pumpkin seeds that I need to use up.  Rave reviews from all of us.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly like the recipe called for!!!  Its the first time my man said put this on the menu!!!  I added mushrooms and it was sooooo good... I did follow the advice noodles and the only change I would make is like others stir in the parmesan after because it did all stick together which was a bummer... still 5 stars

Amazing.  I only had one bunch of asparagus, but I agree 2 would have been better, I love asparagus.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and tossed them on the grill pan and broke the pecans into pieces.  I didn't have fresh basil I used dry... YUMMY a total keeper

Yeeeeaaaaah! Loved this one. Much more flavorful than i expected it to be! Sauteed the chicken in a little bit of lemon pepper instead of grilling it and went a little lighter on the butter. Amazing flavor!

This pasta was a good one! I thought the sauce was a bit bland first so I added garlic pwder, lots of salt, more basil and bacon bits. Good recipe to start, but for me and my salty tastes, it ended up great. Definately a must try

This was good, not wonderful.  NOTE:  I halved this recipe and it still made enough for Jack, Jenny, and I for one night and then for Jack and I for leftovers.  I already had frozen, grilled chicken tenders so I sliced them up instead of buying grilled chicken strips...although they may have had more flavor.

Due to all the fantastic reviews, I couldn't wait to try this recipe. There were seven of us for dinner and everybody liked it but me.  I thought it tasted like a boring Lean Cuisine.  But the two middle-school age kids gobbled it up.  I'll make it again if somebody requests it.

Good.  Pecans are a must.  Will tweak next time: decrease butter, increase vegetables, thicken sauce w/ cornstarch and add a splash of wine.

This was delicious.  My husband usually doesn't like pasta dishes but he absolutely loved this one.  I've made this a couple of times and changed the proportions of some of the ingredients.  I use 1 1/2 pounds of chicken, half of the pasta and just one bunch of asparagus.

Lovely subtle flavors.I did not use the whole pound of pasta, but everything else was perfect for us.A pound would be fine for a bigger family/group though,great way to stretch that food $, and the dish would still be wonderful. I'm going to try it again with brown rice.We loved this.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars it is that good! In the future I think I might up the amount of veggies because it would be a little better for me...I wonder if I could substitute the noodles with spaghetti squash....just a thought!

This delicious recipe has become our family favotire.  I have a 12 and 19 year old son and they both love it along with my husband.  We use pine nuts instead of the walnuts.  It is very colorful and delicious.  Everytime I cook this for friends I get asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharint it!!

This was an excellent pasta!  It had such a great combination of flavors.....and it was aesthetically pleasing as well!  A couple minor changes I did make, I used closer to 1 bunch of asparagus......and it really was plenty after you cut into 1 inch pieces.  And I chopped 1/2 yellow pepper and 1/2 red pepper instead 1 whole red pepper. This gave it a little more pop in color and flavor.  Last, I chopped the pecans and toasted them before adding.  I definitely recommend doing this!  The pecans are better in every bite rather than having large, random pieces here and there.  Plus, toasting them for a few minutes brings out the flavor.  This pasta was easy and tasted like it came from a restaurant!  I will make again and again!!!

A different and creative dish, but the flavor doesn't have any significant snap to it.  Asparagus is not a strong flavor, nor are pecans.  I think the garlic and basil are lost in the other ingredients.  It's filling but lacks any "wow" factor.

I had to adjusted this recipe for 20 people and it still turned out great.  Everyone raved about it.  I substituted half the Asparagus with Broccoli and added a bit more chicken.  I baked the chicken first since it was too cold to grill outside.  Before the chicken was done, I lightly coated it with a honey and apple cider vinegar sauce and finished baking. Worked out well.

This recipe was pretty good.  I substituted dried basil for fresh and that may be the difference between 4 and 5 starts for me.  We also added red pepper flakes to taste and it gave it a little extra zip.

I really like how light this recipe is. The cheese didn't melt well though. And I added red pepper flakes, because it needed a little oomph. Next time, I will add more red bell pepper, just because I like more veggies.

This was excellent! My husband (big pasta eater) loved it. Had leftovers the next day, but since they were a little dry I added a "Knorr's" Garlic Pasta Sauce over it. So good I may even do that the next time just to make it nice and creamy.

Delicious! My mother made this at my suggestion, and although she had to buy broccoli instead of asparagus (the store had a bad stock of asparagus), it was simply scrumptious. I was worried the pecans would taste odd in here, but they were very very subtle and were a nice touch. I plan on making it again both ways.

My father said this was "the bomb!" I added mushrooms to give a bit more veggie options in the mix, and reduced the penne pasta by half so as not to have as much carbs. 

What I like is that this is a perfect "Farmer's Market" feast. I can purchase a variety of different vegetables, and they will all go well together in the making of this dinner. Really affordable, doesn't take a lot of effort to prepare.

Taste wise this rated 4•s but I had to make some changes . A pound of pasta was way too much! I ended up using half of it and there still wasn’t enough sauce. I added another cup of chicken broth and let it reduce with the pasta in it. I only used 1 bunch of asparagus. And I used 3 certain peppers instead of the bell. They spiced  O a bit more. At the table both if us added freshly ground pepper.

I've made this twice.  I used farfalle and roasted red pepper.  I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper and broke up the pecans and added mushrooms the second time...delish!

I changed this up a little just based on veggies available.  And I also used pine nuts instead of pecans (again, what I have in my pantry and what we like).  I was really  shooting for a little bit of a thicker sauce on the pasta dish since usually we just do garlic and olive oil.  It was good, it added a depth of flavor but I was hoping to get a little thicker of a sauce.  Still good, will use it again.

I loved all the ingredients but thought it was very dry.  I was expecting more of a sauce and it wasn’t there.  I plan to add more chicken broth when it’s reheated to see if that helps.

Very good! Weather prevented grilling the chicken so I used a pan and added some McCormick Montreal Chicken seasoning. Also, a little more garlic then recommended.

I loved the base idea of this recipe. I am always looking to utilize things I already have. I used carrots instead of the pepper and added in tomato. I added in a bit of cream into the broth which made it creamier. Family all enjoyed the dish.

I liked this dish but hubby thought it was just OK.  But if you've read any of my other reviews you know I have the pickiest husband in the world.  Yes, in the world.  Not kidding!   I would make this again.  I didn't have grated parmesan cheese - just shredded and this makes a big difference.  But I still thought it was good!

Great recipe... per other reviewers' suggestion, added red pepper flakes (a few shakes), also had yellow peppers and zucchini on hand, threw those in too.  The dish was easy to prepare and had a nice flavor, will definitely make again.

I halved the recipe since I was only cooking for 2 (husband had 2nds). I added baby bella mushrooms, about a cup, used a whole red pepper, and tripled the garlic (we love garlic).  I used diced rotisserie chicken, added some red pepper flakes, used pine nuts instead of pecans,  and a splash of red wine. Very good, but next time I would thicken the sauce a bit.

We really liked it!  After following the exact recipe we decided it is a great base you could add other things to based on what is in the refrigerator/garden.  It would be good with tomatoes, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, etc.

Yum! I used at least twice as much chicken broth, but otherwise didn't change a thing. This was light and delicious. Don't leave out the pecans! They really made the dish. Also, grilling the chicken instead of baking it really added a lot of flavor.

Four stars as written. FIVE stars with the following adjustments:  added more basil (about 1/2 cup); used toasted pine nuts instead, as pecans seemed odd to me; added 1/4 t red pepper flakes; one additional T of butter; and doubled the garlic.  This is great if you have leftover chicken to use up.  I didn't, so I just cut the raw chicken into strips, seasoned with salt, pepper, & Italian seasoning, and browned it in olive oil.  As written was just a little bland for us, but with these adjustments - YUM!

Instead of starting with oil and garlic, I cooked the veggies in Land O'Lakes Garlic & Herb Sauté Express.  I used two cups of dried bow tie pasta and only 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese.  I also added mushrooms.  It was delicious!

I used dried basil and left out the red peppers since I didn't have any. Also used a combo of fresh grated Parmesan and Romano cheeses. Also used walnuts instead of pecans out of personal preference. Turned out very good.

Tasted great! I'll probably make this next time we have guests. Not the best person for a review because I didn't have enough asparagus, chicken, or noodles  but I attempted anyway and it was actually perfect. Had only 3/4 box of noodles, one batch of asparagus, and two chicken breasts (so maybe 12 oz?).  We love garlic so I doubled that and added a pinch of garlic powder. I honestly thought it was a good proportion anyway, and so did the rest of the family.

I made this over the weekend for a dinner party (doubled the recipe).  I forgot to add the basil and the pecans, but it turned out SO WELL!   I will definitely be making this again soon!  You won't be disappointed!

This recipe was so tasty! Absolutely loved it. I used bow tie pasta, per some reviews. I also used dairy free Parmesan cheese and vegan margarine to accommodate my lactose-intolerant boyfriend.

Absolutely awesome recipe!  Thank you, Julie!!!  I am not very good in the kitchen, so I was so proud this turned out so great!  Based on other reviews, I did add mushrooms, chopped red onions, red and green peppers.  It was visually gorgeous with all the colors!  I sautéed those veggies in a bit of chicken broth.  I also added a hint of Adobo.  I purchased from Whole Foods a block of parmesan cheese, so topping it with freshly grated cheese was delightful!  I am doing the happy dance here!  LOL  This met my goal to have a healthy recipe for lunch or dinner this week.  PS:  The penne pasta I used was organic, but only our bodies will tell the difference.  The taste was just as wonderful!  Again, I cannot thank you and the others who have posted enough!  God bless you and hugs from South Florida.

I omitted the butter (didn't miss it) and increased the pecans to 1 cup and broke them. This was a hit. It made a ton. My favorite part was the pecans, but my husband and daughter didn't like them.

I didn't have pecans and I only used one bunch of asparagus because that was all I had. I did add some thyme and poultry seasoning to the chicken before I mixed it in. It was great my husband loved it too.

This was great!  I made a few changes - we eat low carb, so I used shirataki noodles in the organic isle, and like a few others suggested, I used premade basil pesto.  AMAZING!

I wanted to make this as Paleo-friendly as possible so used Ghee instead of Olive oil and omitted the butter. I didn't have the pre-grilled chicken but just fried up some tenders before sauteing the vegetables. (Removed chicken from the pan & added back at the end.) I used quinoa pasta but followed the recipe otherwise(went light on the parm)and I am eating it as I write this review.  I find it to be light and very flavorful!I did use another reviewer's suggestion and broke up the pecans and lightly toasted them.

I loved it! I didn't have fresh basil so used the basil leave seasoning. To enhance the flavor (I like a little richness/spice) I added a tiny drizzle of black truffle oil and Siracha to my plate and it was AMAZING!

I am already looking forward to making this again. I did marinate the chicken before grilling. Just use your favorite flavor. Did add a small amount of red pepper flakes. Thought 16ozs of pasta was too much. Need to cut back on that. Otherwise, this was fantastic.

Really loved this recipe!
I added a little bit of pasta water to the broth before adding it to the pot to thicken the sauce a bit more
I also added shaved Parmesan instead of grated Parmesan 
My family says the recipe is a keeper.

This was simple and delicious.  I only used half the amount of pasta but kept the other ingredients in proportion.  Using rotisserie chicken made this recipe quick and tender.

This is excellent with the Chicken/Feta/Spinach Sausage suggested by the chef Julie!  I browned and sliced the sausage, set it aside. I also used whole wheat bow-tie pasta, dried basil, only one large bunch asparagus and walnuts (I lightly toasted)plus a full can, 14oz of chicken broth - added some seasoning salt to the broth & veggies for extra punch - this is so tasty and makes a huge bowl full.  This recipe is a definite keeper!  I think the sausage added that extra flavor that some reviewers said was missing!

I didn't have the red pepper on hand, but always serve my pasta dishes on a bed of fresh organic baby spinach...and I add capers! Of course if I have guests that I don't know what they prefer, I ask, duh! That's the message I wish to impart to these reviewers...if you don't like the ingredients move along...don't leave negative comments! It's a waste of time...the nice people to go to the time & trouble to post these, are a gift to us! I do think it's cool that people grade 5 stars & offer a different spin on this site.Thanks, Julie for a great recipe!

Thumbs way up from whole family.  I added more garlic and yellow squash, plus I topped with halved cherry tomatoes.  I also used whole wheat pasta.  Very easy recipe and very good.

I loved this!  I used 1 tbsp dried basil instead of fresh, and the spinach chx sausage from Sam's as another reviewer suggested.  I wanted to use pecans, but turns out the "pecans" I had in the pantry were really walnuts, so I just left out nuts.  It didn't matter.  The only change I would make is less ground pepper.  My 5 yr old did not care for it, but my 17 month old had 3 helpings.

Wonderful recipe!!! Like other reviewers, I halfed the penne. I also halfed the basil. I didn't have asparagus on hand, so I used green beans. I roasted the pecans. Such a great flavor!! Will make again. Thanks for sharing!!

This was SO good! I didn't change a thing, and my 15 yr old step son inhaled 3 portions! Really great flavor with the fresh basil, and pecans. I'll make this again!

This is so tasty!! I used a little extra chicken broth so it wasn't dry and bland, and once I put in the last ingredients I pulled it off heat because I like my vegies a little crisp, but it was outstanding! Thanks for sharing!!

I sautéed the chicken separately in olive oil and garlic and then tossed it in. I followed the rest of the steps exactly and it was delicious. Next time, I'll increase the red pepper, because we really like it.

Just FABULOUS!  I have made this several times, and it just keeps getting better.  The only thing I do differently is that I bake the chicken in olive oil @ 375 for 35 minutes.  This is the perfect amount of time for me to do the all the other prep work.  The chicken comes out so tender and pulls apart into bite size pieces very easily.  Also I only use 1 bunch of asparagus, and it never seems sparse to me.  I love asparagus, but two bunches seems like overkill IMHO.  Also, unless you absolutely hate pecans do not leave them out.  They add something extra special to this recipe that elevates it from good to great.  The pine nuts sound like a good idea too, but the pecans are so good, I haven't wanted to tinker with it.

This recipe was delicious.  I substitued grape tomatos for the red pepper and added 1 lb of raw jumbo shrimp to the boiling pasta for the last three minutes instead of using chicken.  We loved it!

The Pecans were strange and I thought there could be a creamier sauce... not just melted cheese. Not bad though.

Really liked this but felt like it was missing something.  My changes: used whole wheat pasta, half of a green bell pepper, 1 bunch of asparagus, used less pasta, added mushrooms, also used dried basil.  It was a very pretty dish and a great combination of flavors.  Will make again!

It is great to have a flavorful, healthy pasta dish (we use low carb pasta).  Yes, you really need two bunches of asparagus, especially if you use the thing stalks.  I use this great recipe to make three days of different dinners.  Day 1, we have the chicken (cook 6 chicken breasts cut like tenders with seasonings in this recipe)  and have asparagus as the side dish.  Then on day 2, I use the left over chicken (dice it up) and add more asparagus to make this delicious recipe as is.  We serve the pecans and the parmesan on the side so we can later use the leftovers on the third day.  Day 3, take all the left overs put back in the pot and add chicken broth (fat free cream of chicken for more stew-like eating)   and you can add some carrots, etc. if you like in the soup...why not? Serve with biscuits.  Three nights of different dinners  THANK YOU for the recipe.  Great inspiration.

omg! omg! omg!  This stuff was PHENOMINAL!  My boyfriend made this for me in January, next time, he'll make it in the spring. (When asparagus isn't so expensive)  He didn't use pecans.  I'm going to have him try it with g. beans & mushrooms.  I think that anything would be good in this.  It's easy, & YUMMY!  I would recommend this to anybody!

Good dish, very fresh tasting.  I made farfalle and added a bit more butter.  Since I was in hurry I used precooked frozen sliced chicken breast.  Tasted great.  Didn't have any pecans so omitted that.  Will make again

We liked it as did our toddler. I would like to get a little more flavor in it. I used pecorino instead because we had it and omitted the butter. Nice to get a veggie serving in with the pasta. Overall, I'd give it another try.

Good dish...I added a can of diced tomatoes w/basil and balsamic vinegar though (just because it was my preference).  Making it this weekend for some family and based on feedback, will determine if it's a 'keeper' :)

Great recipe!  Light and flavorful.  I usually make two versions, one with chicken for my husband and one without chicken for myself (vegetarian), I also substitute chicken broth for vegetable broth.  Delicious!!!

OMG this was absolutely delicious. My bf and I couldn't stop eating it. I followed some other users advise and used oine nuts instead of pecans and I used lots and lots of garlic. I also added some red pepper flakes.

This was a really easy recipe.   I think it needed more chicken broth and peppers, and when the "sauce" gets transferred it would be best to have a giant bowl put some of the noodles in, a little sauce, etc.  Otherwise it all ends up on the top/bottom.

Amazing!!  My family had seconds and thirds.  Goes great with the light oat bread recipe and fresh fruit.

The ingredients had great flavor but I wish the sauce had been a little "saucier". I'd try this again but with a different sauce.

This was good.  I didn't use pecans and I used whole-wheat pasta.  I could have used more garlic than it called for, but it was still very tasty!!  It was also very colorful with green asparagus and red peppers. :)

This was very good.  Everyone even my kids ate this.  The only thing I changed was I didn't use quite as much pasta and I left out the nuts (my son hates nuts).  Maybe next time I will try with nuts.

WOW - this is a great dish and very easy to prepare. I grilled whole chicken breasts instead of tenderloins because that is what I had on hand. The combination of flavors was great. I will definitely make this one again.

Very good!  Pretty healthy, too.  Kids will eat this one (maybe picking out a veggie or two!)
