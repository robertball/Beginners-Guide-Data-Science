Made as listed ,except was out of red onion, and didn't wait to cook down a full 45 minutes. Probably because of those changes,it needed some seasoning.  So we added an extra TBSP of soy sauce and a little sea salt. Served over Jasmine rice with added toasted almonds and a side medley, of stir-fried veggies. Will be making this one again. Thank you , for sharing.

This was a good dish but not worth all the ingredients to us. I have a better dish with similar ingredients that I cook often that we absolutely love...it's Emeril's (or Doc Chey's) Red Curry Thai Shrimp Noodles. Tho I liked this, the flavors weren't enough to keep me making it.

This was really really good.  I added way more garlic, beef, some grated ginger and lots of hot sauce to the curry itself, but other than that, it was so good as is.  Thanks!
