This is the best dip I've ever tasted. My card club went crazy over it, men and women alike. I put it in a bread bowl with bread and cracked pepper breadsticks to dip, but it's so good, it even tasted great on saltines! Don't serve it ice-cold -- let it soften up before serving. Thanks, Idgie! UPDATE: Tried making it with whipped cream cheese -- it's even creamier! Took it to the staff lounge at school -- it didn't last past 11 a.m.

Family loves it. I add half tub sour cream to make it more spreadable. Take half out for those who like the dip thicker. Use rest of sour cream to mix with the remaining half for those who like to use it with chips, easy to break items, and thinner dip. I have been making this for several years and thought I had rated it in the past. So sorry for delayed review.
