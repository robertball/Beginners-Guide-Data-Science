This is a great pie recipe.  I make homemade pies all the time and this is a keeper.  My only change on this recipe is that the filling ingredients either need to be doubled to make 2 pies or use the amounts listed and only make 1 pie.  The topping amounts are enough for two pies.

This was an awesome recipe---NOTE: I followed this recipe and fit all of it into a 10-in pan.  The recipe says it makes two pies---if I divided it up for two pies, it would not have been very deep.  Also--I doubled the crumbly stuff on top and used mostly almonds instead of walnuts.  The inside of the pie is a little tart and sweet and the topping is sweet--balances it out for a delicious treat!!!  Very unique recipe.

This is a great recipe. I substituted 3 cups of fresh sliced peaches for the raspberries and it was fabulous. I brought it to a party and it was gone in no time. Everyone loved it. Someone even said a pie like this can't be bought in the store. A+++

WOW!  I made two pies ( doulbe the recipe ) for Christmas eve dinner and they were amazing!  We had alot of frozen raspberries in th freeze from this summer, so this was perfect.  The only this I did different was left the nuts out and only because I didnt have any.  I made this recipe again with light sour cream, DO NOT use light, totally ruined it.  I will make this pie over and over again!

Ok, I have made this recipe as is SOOO many times and it's wonderful as is!  However, when I went to make it last week week using the final bag of frozen raspberries from our garden I realized that I did not have enough sour cream, so I made one pie and substituted the sour cream with one eight (8) ounce pkg of cream cheese - OMG!!!  It turned out awesome!  You have to reduce the flour to 2 TBS when you use the cream cheese

Fantastic pie!  The tartness of the raspberries goes so well with the creamy base. I just tried this recipe with cranberries and it rocks. I subbed pecans for the walnuts in the topping and I think next time I might use a pecan crust as well. I will be serving this at Thanksgiving for a new twist.

Wow! Very unique and delicious pie!!  I too, used just 1 10" pie pan (not enough filling for two 9" pies)  I did, however, use 4 cups of berries instead of 3.   (I used blackberries)  I increased the cooking time by 5 - 7 minutes and then added the topping for the regular cooking time.  I willdefinitely make this again  Yummy!

Halved recipe for one pie but used 2 1/2 cups of berries - due to excess in the garden. Don't forget about the topping (I almost did).  Really good custard-like pie. Very easy to make, especially if you use a Pillsbury crust.

Yum. I cut the recipe in half and made one perfectly filled pie. This is not sweet but tart. Loved it. I don't like nuts so I used grape nuts for the topping. I also used reduced fat sour cream. Yummy. Hard to stop eating.

I made this exactly as written, with frozen unsweetened raspberries, and a homemade butter pie crust. YUM! But ... if I had rated it last night (after it had cooled to barely warm) i may have given it a 4. Let it chill ... so much better cold! Raspberry custard pie with a sweet crunchy topping. This recipe made ONE deep dish 9" pie, and baking time was the same. I used all the topping on the one pie, because I like it that way! :) Fabulous and festive, and different than any pie I've had before. Perfect for the holidays!

This recipe is delicious. I added some lemon zest to the filling mixture and it gave it a bright, yummy flavor.

Absolutely a wonderful dessert! I, too, am asked to make this for summer events, and it's become a "signature" dessert. I substitute plain yogurt for some of the sour cream without any effect on the flavor or texture. Use only fresh or premium frozen  (i.e., flash-frozen individual) raspberries.

Oh either my Rasberries were "seedy" or I jsut dont like raspberries..felt like I was biting into sand..but I guess that is not the recipes fault..However..I dont think the topping "goes" with the pie part of this recipe.  Topping is more for a apple pie or peach pie...but just my opinion.

I used a graham cracker crust (pre-made) instead of a regular pie crust.  I followed the recipe as given & had about 2 extra cups of filling, which I put in a bowl and baked along with the pie.  I halved the topping and it was plenty for the pie.  This is a really yummy recipe, and the filling would be the perfect amount for one 10-inch pie crust.

YUMMY! Used a deep pie dish, so I only needed 1 pie crust. I also made the crust more of a streusel, so I added more brown sugar and butter then asked for. I will make this again for sure!

My hubby accidentally left out an entire freezer bag of our last summer's raspberries.  I had to find something to use them for.  I did change the nuts to 50/50 macadamias and cashews.  I'm just not big on pecans and walnuts on pies.   My family loves this pie!  My kids ate it for breakfast (2nd pie on day 3) and said it taste just as good.  One of my boys opted to heat it up, saying he liked it better warm.  I am adding a photo here of the whole pie minus one piece to show that you CAN make two pies from the ingredients.  The pie crusts are deep dish and I think they were filled enough! The only thing I suggest is not taking the pie crust from the freezer until you are ready to fill them.  I took one out, thinking I could make everything quickly and fill the pie crust, but my crust was defrosted before I could fill them.  I realized I would have enough for two pies, so I also used a frozen crust from the freezer.  The defrosted one cooked a little darker and had more of an overcooked taste to the rim.  Family is already telling me we will make this again!

Awesome! The sour cream turns into a custard-like texture which is really great. My pie was quite tart, but I bet that varies depending on your raspberry batch. I used pre-sliced almonds instead of walnuts and they came out great -- really added to the taste. I accidentally baked the filling and topping all at the same time, but it came out looking beautiful -- everyone thought the pie was store-bought! Without altering filling or topping quantities, this yielded one overflowing, delicious, gone-in-five-seconds pie.

Delish!! I used fresh raspberries that I tossed in a little cornstarch and sugar and added it to the pie before adding the cream mixture. It all fit into a 10" deep dish pie crust, but I only used two thirds of the crumble topping. I used oats in the crumble topping rather than nuts as well. Because I used one deep dish pie crust I baked it at 350f degrees for 55 minutes. The tartness of the raspberries went perfect with the sweet topping and creamy texture of the sour cream filling. I liked it better the next day cold out of the fridge then at room temperature after it baked and cooled.

I loved it and so did everybody else... but when I told everybody it was a sour cream pie, they all decided they hated it.  Really?!?  So don't tell people what's in it, otherwise they might not eat it!! (if they are sissies!)

This was quite good.  Nice creamy/tart/sweet combination.  I did replace some of the sour cream with Greek Yogurt.

I am making my seventh Raspberry Sour Cream Pie using this recipe, but this will be the first time I use frozen instead of fresh berries.  I learned to double the crumb topping for each pie so it is enough to cover the entire top of the pie.  It is a hit with everyone who has had a piece!

This is by far the best Raspberry pie I have made.  Half the recipe did perfectly fill a 9 inch pie shell.  I did use more raspberries--almost twice as much as called for.  I also used light sour cream which was just fine.  I have tried this with multiple crusts and my favorite is the shortbread crust recipe on this site in a 9x13 pan with the full recipe to make bars.  Graham cracker crust is good also.

Pies are known to be hard to make. But this is an easy recipe. And a delicious one at that. For being my first attempt at baking a pie (and disregarding some burnt crusts on my part), I'd say this is a good recipe for beginners.

This pie is delicious.  I used Greek yoghurt and because others had said it did not fill two pie shells well, I increased the recipe by 50%.  Did not increase the amounts for the crumb topping - it is a perfect amount for two pies.   Had it with company and it even drew great reviews from my husband who would never make raspberry anything his first choice.  Second pie went in the freezer for next special meal.

I used the filling to make one pie, and make 1/2 the topping to coat it. Wonderful!

This pie turned out pretty tasty even though I forgot the vanilla. I added all the filling to one pie crust or it would have been an incredibly thin pie. When I stirred in the raspberries (tiny wild ones my boyfriend picked in his yard) the entire filling turned pink. I don't know if this is because the raspberries had been frozen for awhile. I would like to try this pie with other berries-and adding the vanilla of course. One last thing- the berries were very tart so I added extra sugar. My boyfriend said it was delicious- which pleased me because I had thought leaving the vanilla out was a fatal flaw.

A real crowd-pleaser! This is special-requested by my family for holidays (although I dont consider it super fancy.) It is best eaten sooner than later though, it gets soggy after a day or 2.

Awesome!!!  I loved this recipe.  The only thing I found was that the filling made only enough for one 9-inch pie. :)

This is an absolutley AMAZING pie!  This is a no fail recipe.  I only made one pie in a deep dish pie plate with no other changes.  I received non-stop compliments with this pie, it's a keeper.

Found this recipe yesterday and made it today.  What a hit with the family!  I used a bag of frozen raspberries (2.5 cups) for one pie and the amount of berries for the filling was just right.  Made a second pie with fresh peaches and added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling.  Just as delicious as the raspberry.  Thinking rhubarb might be good as well.

I'm sorry but we didn't care for this pie.  The sour cream filling overwhelmed the raspberries. There just wasn't much flavor.  I doubt that I will make this again.

I did not even use a pie crust - still awesome!  I increased raspberries to 5 cups - perfect!  Also used greek yogurt in place of all the sour cream - worked just as well and healthier.  This is a keeper.  I will be using this recipe with our cherry plums in a couple of weeks when they ripen.  BTW, I was able to get it all in a large 10" deep-dish pie plate.

This is quite possibly the best pie I have ever made.  It was delicious!  I know it seems like there is not enough filling to fill 2 pies, but when you add the topping it fits a regular pie pan perfectly as it cooks up.  I used slivered almonds.

AWESOME! .  I used fat free sour cream, eggbeaters and whole wheat flour so it would be a bit healthier. I left the nuts out and used white sugar instead of brown because I didn’t have any brown. Also, I know the recipe says it makes 2 pies but it only made one for me. I brought it into work and everyone was crazy about it!

We usually have excess raspberries in late summer and I came across this recipe when looking for a good way to use them up! I have made it at least 25 times. Every time I serve it, everyone asks for the recipe. It is a good one!!!

This was great!  I dont usually like raspberry pie because of all the seeds.  This recipe hides the crunchy seeds by adding a crunchy topping with nuts.  I did use almonds instead of walnuts.  A friend said it was the best pie she has ever had.  We are trying it with blueberries, too.

This is an excellant recipe that my wife and I both loved.  The flavor was awesome and the berries melted in our mouth. 

I did decide to make a batch and a half because of the deep pie shells I had.  I also doubled the crunchy topping because I hate it when there isn't enough crunchies, oh and I accidently bought mixed berries at the store so this was just a little differant.  If there is a picture on this recipe it is one that I submitted.

This was amazing! Made it for Mother's Day, and everyone loved it. Light, fruity and great after a big meal. The reviewers who said just make one were right. I used a 9.5" deep glass pie pan and it was the perfect amount. The topping is enough for two pies. This is going into my permanent collection.

I am using this recipe as a strawberry pie, and I assure you it deserves all the glowing reviews you can read here. I made a few changes, though: my pie crust was cut from a sheet of puff pastry, and the pie doesn't seem to be suffering from it, on the contrary! I had strawberries and not raspberries, I cannot use nuts because of allergies and so I substituted nuts with oats; I baked everything together, whit the streusel already in place; and last but not least, I only had yogurt and not plain at that, but coconut favoured. Well, the combination is said to be stunning, I cannot say why. Definitely a keeper, and as I've showed, a great potentiality!!!

GREAT way to use up the raspberries from the garden!! As written, the recipe makes one very full pie (using a 9" deep dish store bought crust), there might even be a little excess filling that you need to toss, but certainly not enough to fill a second pie crust! I skip the nuts in the topping, but follow everything else exactly.

This is an awesome recipe! The only change I did was to make one pie as the amount quoted was not enough for two I also made a little less of the crumbly top.

Absolutely delicious !!! 10 stars... I only make one pie from recipe, after reading reviews. But I cut the topping in half. Use a larger pie pan, or line your oven, as it will boil over, if you only make one pie. Add 15 mins. to baking time for 1 pie. Everyone wants seconds, and the recipe. Gave the recipe to 2 people today. I use un-thawed raspberries. Going to try canned pears next. Got 2 quarts delivered today from person that had a piece of this raspberry pie last night. Found recipe for almost identical recipe using pears from Allrecipes.com site.  Will do that one next.  LOVE THIS RECIPE..

Love, love, love this pie.  I've made it with my own fresh picked raspberries or blueberries that I freeze during the summer.  I thaw them first and it turns out great every time.  I've also made the topping with pecans instead of walnuts when I didn't have any....still great.  Highly reccommend.  The only thing I change is that I use 4 cups of berries instead of the 3 cups listed in the recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe!

What a scrumptious dessert. Especially soon after it's cooled from the oven. I'm going to try it with a dollop of creme fraiche next time.

I made this in ONE 10" shell and added another cup of berries.  If you made it into two pies, I think they would be pretty shallow.  Also doubled the ingredients for the streusel topping and piled it on high!  It turned out terrific.  Baked 35-40 minutes.  Add a little whipped topping... Yum!

My mom use to make a raspberry pie with heavy cream-- this tastes very similar even though I used low fat sour cream! I didn't make the topping but the filling was very smooth and creamy.  It set very well and was perfect the next day!

This cooked up well & looked delicious but didn't taste the same. As written there was only enough filling for one pie. The filling has too many raspberries (I even reduced them to 2 cups) which makes the flavour too tart & gritty with all the raspberry seeds. I also felt the pastry & the crumble topping combined was too much. Would be better to just do the pastry & filling or cook the filling in individual ramekins and top with the crumble. Doubt I will make again....

Yum, I'll make this again. I used frozen blueberries instead of raspberries. I omitted the walnuts in the topping. I'm giving it 4 stars because it was so flat, there was barely enough filling for the pie. So it wasnt as pretty either. I would probably double or 1 1/2 the filling next time. Worth making though!

WOW !!! This pie was very easy to make and absolutely amazing! In one week, I had to make it 3 times (6pies) to keep up with everyone's demand for it. The top crust is heavenly and definitely something I will use for other pies (such as apple). It tastes great warm and even better cold. If I could rate this higher than 5...I would. For anyone doubting whether to try this recipe.....TRY IT....you'll love it!

Whoever said this was not good pie is crazy. It is by far the best pie I have ever had. It was made with splenda and I couldnt tell at all, we have also made it with regular suger and it tasted just as good. The leftover is just as good as the first slice. Seriously try this pie, you wont be disappointed!!

I loved this recipe! Just enough sugar for the topping and just sweet enough! I thought it could have been a little bit thicker of a pie.

I must admit, I was a little nervous making this as it was my first time making a cream pie, but WOW, what a great recipe. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out beautifully! Took the pie with me when visiting friends and it was gone in minutes! The only change I did was to use almonds for the topping instead of walnuts.

This sounded so yummy, but the finished product was average.  My family each had a slice and the rest has been sitting in the fridge for a week. It was a little too sour.

We love to go raspberry picking every year.  I usually make at least one pie which is always a bit soupy no matter what.  This pie was delicious and not the least bit runny!  I followed others suggestions and just made one 10 inch pie - just right.

This is a wonderful pie that will win you many friends. It is however a ONE pie recipe. We made it in a 10 inch pie pan and it was beautiful. We plan to make another one to take to the family reunion tomorrow. Enjoy!!

It was delicious, but the filling is not enough for two 9 inch pies.  So, after making the recipe, but before baking, I mixed 1 beaten egg, 1 1/2 cups of sour cream, 1/4 cup sugar in a separate bowl.  I  split the filling evenly over the two pies, and used a bowl scraper to slightly mix the white in with the pink of the original filling.  

I baked the pies as directed, but did add about 10 extra minutes to make up for the extra filling.

I thought the topping sounded odd with raspberries, but changed my mind after tasting it and getting rave reviews.

I was impressed with this recipe somewhat, but I didn’t enjoy it as much as everyone else who raved about it.  I did a 50/50 split with blueberries and I doubled the thickness of the filling, so I had some issues with cooking time.  I had to refrigerate it to get it to thicken, but I’m kind of glad I did because everyone seemed to like it better cold.  And the crumble topping I struggled with, but I think my butter cubes weren’t cold enough.  But I definitely want to keep this recipe to try again.

Love this recipe! I prefer scooping the filling into tart shells for individual servings. If you halve this recipe (ie. For 1 pie) it makes apps 12-16 tarts. For friends with nut allergies, I just substitute nuts with oats. Otherwise I use a mix of walnuts and pecans (and throw in some oats as well.. because, why not?). When I'm busy preparing for a dinner party, I make the pies the night before without the topping, place in fridge and add the topping and back just before serving.

Made this tonight for dessert. Just 2 changes: used half the ingredients as I only wanted one pie. Used pecans in the topping instead of walnuts. Made the full amount of topping for 2 pies for my 1 pie. A couple of reviewers felt there wasn't enough filling. When I added the topping it was just the right amount. This pie is outstanding! A little tart, a little sweet. Good consistency in the filling. I will surely make this again.

I made this exactly as written except I used fat free sour cream and it tasted amazing. Made the pie two days in advance and froze it; then on serving day let it thaw for four hours at room temp before serving. It held together well. Brought it to a dinner party where one person said it was the best pie he had ever tasted. A hit!!

I made this for a church event and it was a hit! Everyone asked for the recipe. I used frozen raspberries and exchanged pecans for the walnuts. This made a perfect 10" pie. I will definitely make it again.

When I made the topping, it made it using 1 1/2 times the ingredients. It provided excellent coverage. I also covered the crust with aluminum foil during the last 15minutes to avoid over cooking.

This is a fast and easy pie to make. We were invited to dinner and I only had a couple of hours to make a dessert. Since I had some frozen raspberries I started looking for something quick. THIS was quick and really tasty. I love that it made two pies. You could use ANY kind of fruit in this and my next two pies will have blueberries in them. YUM!

Yum!  After reading other reviews stating there was not enough filling, I decided to use an entire 16 oz container of sour cream - it comes out to be just over 1&1/3 cup anyways. I also added about one more cup of berries. I did not have crushed walnuts, so I just substituted with some quick oats for the topping. I like that the recipe makes two pies, because everyone one loves it and it disappears quickly!

Great recipe! Flavor was great. My only suggestion would be to make an extra half batch of the filling. There isn't quite enough to fill two pie crusts.

This is a great way to use fresh raspberries when you are picking them faster than you can use them.  I followed recipe as written.  It set up like it should--not runny.  The recipe did not quire fill a 9-inch pie shell to the top.  The topping makes the pie more attractive and adds some extra sweetness to offset the tartness of the raspberries.

We loved it!  This is defiantly a go to recipe.  I did use the suggestion of "it makes one pie rather than two".  Because the original recipe says it makes two pie, I almost rated it a 4.  It gets a full 5 stars for flavor.  Was perfect amount of filling for one pie.  Baked in my new Breville Toaster Oven  and raised the shelf "up one" when I put the topping on for 15 minutes.  Perfect.  BTW, Still make full topping recipe for a single pie.

This recipe did NOT make enough to fill two 9-inch pie crusts (if you're making pie in one of those small aluminum tins it would maybe be the right amount). I had to add several extra cups of raspberries to fill the crusts to a reasonable amount. It baked up just fine. Flavor was good and I liked the crumb topping, but this recipe did not blow me away.

Great pie!  Best served warm!  I used two 6 oz tubs of raspberries and more than 3/4 of the filling for just one pie.  I also skipped the walnuts in the topping because I didn't have any and I grated the butter and hand mixed it in because it is so much easier than cutting.

Thumbs up from everyone. One person didnt want to try it because he hates sour cream. I convinced him to try it and he went back for seconds. 
I am planning to use this in a pie baking contest at work this week :)

I love this recipe. I'm getting ready to make it for the third time. The only thing I did differently was to puree and de-seed (using a mesh strainer) the raspberries. The filling is quite homogenous that way (no lumps of raspberry) and tastes great. It is wonderful hot or just out of the fridge. I make a half recipe each time and it is the right amount for one pie. I'm using black raspberries from my garden, and this pie is such a wonderful way to spotlight them.

This is a delicious pie. Chilled, it is very refreshing, not too sweet, just right. I used black raspberries from our yard and it turned out perfect. Raspberries are seedy, so if you don't care for seeds pick another fruit. Everyone liked it. I made one pie, but with smaller pie pans I could have gotten two. I will make this one again - I think fresh cherries would be nice to try. Thanks!

One of my favorite pie recipes! This has been my go-to for the 4th of July, Memorial Day and other summer events, because it's easy, quick and always a favorite. I increase the ingredients by 33% and buy two small bags (the smaller one Walmart sells) of berries instead of measuring them out, and also add a bit more vanilla; other than that, it's perfect. The ingredient ratio change means you can either have three pies, or two deep dish pies (cook at a slightly lower temperature); the recipe as is will NOT make two deep dish pies! I omit the nuts, as I dislike the texture.

You can trade the raspberries out for strawberries or probably other fruit. I'll be trying it with peaches this year, and I imagine blueberries and blackberries would work just as well.

This pie, out of the oven, still warm is the bomb. Like another  reviewer mentioned, I too found the leftover or next day, the pie although tasty, the flavor and consistency was off slightly. I wondered if there was a way to make the pie more dense. Another reviewer mentioned Cream Cheese, because this really is a very delicious pie, I'm going to try that. I wonder about adding quick cooking tapioca. I added a cup is fresh blueberries to mine.

I made the recipe for the pie it was very yummy and my family loved it! 
I did however use a graham cracker crust homemade. I used honey graham crackers about 12 full peices crumbled up in ziplock bag (could use roller)and about 1 stick of butter melted, just pour in bag and mix all up. 
Then I used most for the crust but left some to use to sprinkle on the top of the pie instead of using the brown sugar and flour mixture. Very yummy!

Made this last night and wasn't that thrilled with it.  We ate it warm and thought the texture was weird.  Also, it didn't have much flavor.  I put the pie in the fridge over night and just had some after dinner now (while cold) and it was great.  So much better cold and having sat for 24 hours.  The flavor and texture are really nice now.  I did a graham cracker crust and I think it goes well with it.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts on the topping (personal preference).  Everything else was as in the recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

I thought it was delicious.    I followed the recipe and it just fitted nicely into a 10" tin.  I am going to make it again using other fruit as I just loved the creamy base.  The crumble top was also good.  I don't care for nuts, so may leave them out next time.
There was a post saying that it doesn't do well left over.  I agree.  I made it late in the day, left it out overnight and cut it up fairly early the next morning.  Had a little taste.  Great.  Firm. Later in the day it had turned into a soggy mush.  After putting it into the fridge, it firmed up again and was great.  Does one defrost the frozen rasps or are they put in frozen?
I decided to make it again a week later, got everything ready and rushed out to buy the raspberries.  None in town.  We were having a heatwave and if I want to use the oven it has to  be before 9 am.  Had one peach, one passion fruit , a handful of cherries, 1/4 apple, a couple of dried cranberries, a few frozen rasps and I had my 3 cups of fruit.  It was really very good.  I also discovered that it freezes very well.  There is the same recipe using rhubarb on AR.  Will try that tomorrow.
I want to change my stars to 5, but don't know how.

It was palatable but the flavors just seemed a strange mix. It was good with a fair amount of whipped cream on top!

Delicious! Not the prettiest pie, but a very tasty blend of flavors. I followed the recipe and just omitted nuts, because I didn't have any. As other bakers noted, the filling did not completely fill the 9inch shell, but after the topping was on, it was fine-just not overflowing.

I doubled the recipe and got two FULL pies...  Given I was doubling and my husband only brought home three cups of raspberries, I was short three cups of fruit.... So I added in two cups of mandarin oranges, cut into small 'bits' and one cup of pineapple pieces.  It was delicious -- the mandarin did not over-power the raspberry at all, but seemed to resolve the 'tartness' issue some of the other reviews mentioned.  One note, the pies were so full they took almost 90 minutes to bake until they were firm in the middle.  For the crumble I used ritz crackers instead of grahams -- scrumptious, buttery and 'nutty'....  made a very 'sophisticated' topping for a simple but also sophisticated pie.  The end of both pies were eagerly taken home by guests, at the end of the potluck (darn, now I need to make two more).  I got GREAT comments from everyone who tried it and I was the 'star' of the family potluck.

i took this to a church potluck.  The comments from people who loved it way outlasted the pie--it completely disappeared!  I used a Marie Calender's frozen pie crust on this particular day and got compliments on it also.

This is probably the BEST pie I have ever had.  So, you're probably wondering about only giving it 4 stars.  This recipe would not make 2 pies.  I cut the ingredients in 1/2 to only make 1 pie, and it barely covered the bottom.  I had to add more sour cream, sugar and raspberries.  I left the rest of the ingredients the same.  I also made my own graham crust because I am just not a fan of pie crust.  I will FOR SURE be making this again (possibly tomorrow), but will make the full recipe for 1 pie.

Great recipe!  I had fresh raspberries on hand and was looking for something to make, this was perfect!  I did only make one pie, even though its says it will make two, using a 10 inch pan.  And I like a lot of crumb topping on my pie, so I did use it all for the one pie.  This is a keeper!  So good, perfect for summer!

I made a version of this pie, using blueberries. A half recipe, with less berries than called for, filled a 9 inch pie pan. Excellent! Everyone loved it. I was surprised that it was as rich as a cheesecake. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe- especially the topping!  I used low fat sour cream, and it was still rich tasting.  I made 2, and we ate one and put one in the freezer.  I served that one to company last night and they loved it!  If I bring this anywhere, I'm bringing the recipe too, because I know I'll get asked for it!

Loved by all!!   I  used canned peaches for one and fresh blueberries in another. It over fills one deep dish, but 2  9in. pies wouldn't be full enough. Passed this recipe around on the 4th !!

really really good!! I made it with strawberries instead, and I loved the topping. I think it took more like 40 min untill it was set in middle. I will try it with raspberries when mine are ripe!

This was a huge hit in my family.  I only made one deep-dish pie using Pillsbury pie crust and  maybe only 3/4 of the topping.   It was delicious and beautiful too. This does, though, result in a rich, gorgeous, high, piece of pie and it is very filling.  I cut thinner slices to serve. We tried it both warm and cold and we like it chilled.   Rave reviews and gone in a flash!  Thank you, Cathy.

I love this pie! The only thing I changed was instead of folding the raspberries in, I just stirred it until most of the raspberries were somewhat blended. Tastes great.

Definitely 5 stars for flavor, but I have to give it 4 stars because the proportions are a little off; there was not enough filling to fill a 9-inch pie pan.  With a little tweaking, it would be an absolute winner!

Incredible recipe!  I used the entire filling for just one pie (used the Pastry and Pie Bible cream cheese pie crust recipe--yum!). The tart raspberries definitely keep the pie from being too sweet. The pie looked and tasted awesome!

For a raspberry pie, this sure is tasty.  I used raspberries from our garden and followed the recipe exactly.  Made two pies in one week, both were gone very quickly.  Everyone kept saying how good it was.  Will make again.

although i can't attest to how delicious this is first hand because i am recovering from throat cancer, my husband and all the neighbors raved about this pie. since we found a local raspberry farm and i way overbought, i used two cups and berries. the finished product is both sweet and tart. my husband loved it. thank you for sharing. d

Fabulous!! Followed the recipe, but cut it in half for one pie. It turned out Great! I used fresh raspberries from my yard. Next time I might substitute almonds for the walnuts because of personal taste but otherwise a great recipe :)

What a wonderful recipe! Delicious hot or cold!! Made exactly as directed and over 10 times. The most popular dessert I have ever made, and many, many, many people have fallen in love with it.

This is a special pie.  I, too, halved the recipe for one pie and it turned out great.  I used pecans that I had on hand.  The recipe recommends cooling the pie before serving, but serving it slightly warm enhances the flavor.

This is a really good recipe. This dish is not too sweet or too tangy. It's very refreshing on a summer day.

I made 4 pies with fresh garden raspberries and gave them to friends.  They could not get enough of this pie.  This is a delicious recipe.  I wouldn't change anything.

I made this recipe last summer, and just came across it again. It was wonderful!!! The only think I did differently was I used almonds instead of walnuts. One of my favorite combination's are Raspberry's and Almonds, so this is like the perfect pie for me!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly using 2 small, not deep dish, pie crusts in the pans. It worked perfectly.

My husband said this pie looked good enough to be on the cover of a magazine! It tasted fantastic, too. I made one pie with the ingredients, not two as the recipe calls for. I also sprinkled fresh raspberries on the top of eash slice as I served it, for a little extra flavor -- not that this pie needs it!

Fabulous recipe.  Have made it twice for two different BBQ's and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  Didn't change a thing, it is great the way it is.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow!  This recipe is great. Everyone in my hard to please family loved it.  I added a little cinnamon to the sour cream mixture and the crumb topping.

This was GREAT! I didn't read the reviews first so I only made one pie (half recipe) but I doubled the berries (3-3.5 cups). It came out great! Very yummy and filled the 9 inch pie pan nicely. It set up well for me too. I definitely plan to make it again.

A huge hit at a dinner party.  Loved by kids and adults - my husband said it might be one of the best desserts ever. Served it with whipped cream.  But keep in mind - recipe only makes one pie.

Absolutely delicious. I took these pies to a picnic on Saturday and today, Tuesday, someone came to my office just to say how great the pie was. I did use 2 pints of berries which was more than 3 cups and will probably add another half pint when I make this again.

This tasted alright, but I added a lot more than the amount of berries called for - at least another cup and it just barely came to the top of the rim.

If you like raspberries, than you'll LOVE this pie! It's especially tasty with a dollop of whipped cream on top. Very easy to make, though it did take a while for my pie to "set" completely.

Very, very good pie - our neighbour is a chef and took the recipe to work!  We've made it twice over and have had requests for the recipe, so you know it's a winner.
