My boyfriend and I tried this recipe one night and were surprised.  He's not big on making sauces, but I insisted on trying it anyway.  We used everything but the cornstarch and added instead at the end more Parmesan to thicken the sauce and turned the heat up high.  This thickened it instantly.  We also added spinach to the mushrooms for another healthy vegetable.  We LOVED it! My boyfriend said it was better than the expensive Italian food we go out to.

Very good. Added some cooked, cut-up chicken when liquid was cooking, mixed cornstarch with water first before adding. Instead of just using Italian seasoning I also added oregano, black pepper, parsley, and onion powder. Used penne instead of fettucine. Will probably make this again.

This turned out well with a bit of tweaking. Four mushrooms for six servings?? And like a previous reviewer notes, you've got to mix cornstarch with water or you'll end up with a grainy consistency.

I followed a lot of the reviewers' recommendations, and it tasted great - like at an Italian restaurant.  The tweaks to the original recipe: I used a whole package of mushrooms, white zinfadel (gives a sweeter taste), probably 1 tsp. of oregano, parsley, and onion powder.  To thicken it, I used the cornstarch (mixed with cold water) and parmesan cheese, along with increasing the heat a little.  I also added chunks of cooked chicken and served it over whole wheat angel hair.  I forgot to add the salt, but that way, each family member can add it to taste.  We will definitely have this again!

Sautee'd 3 X mushrooms with fresh garlic and minced shallot, added the wine with veggie broth (I'm vegetarian) and two buck Chuck.  Added some dried sage for a gravy type taste and it was a big hit over farfalle pasta.  Thank You

Only 4 mushrooms??? Using an entire package of fresh mushrooms is a must!  I also add cooked chicken after I saute the mushrooms to make a complete meal.  Adding the cooked pasta to the skillet mixture allows it to absorb all of the good flavors of the sauce.   Delicious!

I thought this was very good. I added an entire 8 oz. carton of mushrooms and actually thought you could even add more. Instead of the dried Italian seasoning I used a cup of fresh thyme. Very tasty.

This recipe was a chance to use my home made chicken stock. I increased the serving size and stuck with the original directions, just adding some shredded chicken meat. What a wonderful, wonderful dinner!

The sauce didn't thicken like it should have so I ended up adding in more cornstarch than the recipe asked for. Also this recipe didn't make enough sauce, and I added a whole package of mushrooms in. I added more chicken stock and white wine to this recipe and it turned out pretty good. I just think the sauce should definitely be doubled for how much pasta there is.

the taste was bland, I added many more mushrooms and there was still just barely enough.  The cornstarch works best if you mix it with a bit of water in a cup and THEN add it to the skillet.  Otherwise, it just forms into lumps.  In my opinion, the recipe as it stands requires too many adjustments to make it worth the effort.

I loved this recipe.  I did add my personal taste to it, but I do that to everything I cook.  That's one of the reasons you cook for yourself. added extra mushrooms onions, spinach, and sliced grape tomatoes.

Tried the sauce last night and WOW.  Served it over Roasted Garlic Asiago Ravioli.  I did add more mushrooms because you can never get enough mushrooms.  I forgot to add the salt and I’m glad I did.  I also didn’t need to add the cornstarch as the sauce thickened on its own.  Will make this again soon.

This recipe is exceptionally good but with a few modifications. As previous reviewers stated, more than 4 mushrooms are needed- I used about 2 cups of various types of mushrooms ( the more variety of mushrooms the better for taste). I also added garlic, fresh thyme and 1/2 cup of cream cheese which made the sauce more creamier.

Really great tasting pasta! Fancy, but cheap, quick, and simple. I bought pre-sliced regular mushrooms to save time and used two packages. I also added a litle more corn starch because it was taking a while, but if youre patient it will thicken up without it!

I've made this a couple of times but, I add chicken use a lot more mushrooms sometimes baby bellas, I double the chicken stock and add a little more white wine and use shredded parmesan in the sauce as well as on top instead of grated. Very good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I doubled this recipes' ingredients so I could use a 1 lb. box of pasta, some cooked rotisserie chicken, 2 pkgs. of mushrooms (baby bellas and white button) and three Tbls. of corn starch mixed with cold water.  It came out delicious and there was plenty of sauce so the pasta had plenty to soak up without being dry.

I added a LOT more butter (probably 1/4 cup) because I also added a large chopped onion, 4X the garlic and a full package of mushrooms. I also put in some cubed chicken breast and added chopped tomatoes at the end. My spices were: a tsp of thyme, 1/2 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp parsley. I only used about a tsp of cornstarch and had a cup total of wine and chicken stock when combined, only. We LOVED it!

My brother-in-law made a similar dish for me 12 years ago and I've been searching for a good recipe ever since. This turned out great!!! The sauce didn't thicken up like I expected but after mixing it with the pasta it worked out just fine. Thank you for posting!

After seeing some dehydrated gourmet mushrooms in Costo, I had an idea. After rehydrating the mushrooms in water, I boiled the pasta in the rehydrated mushroom water. After I boiled the pasta, I reduced the mushroom pasta water to 1 cup and used that water instead of the chicken stock. The flavor of the mushroom and the starch from the pasta made the sauce incredibly flavorful. Threw some red pepper flakes in for heat and a tablespoon of cream cheese and voila - incredible mushroom flavor.

This was pretty good but I didn't like all the italian seasoning. I was thinking it seemed like a lot when I was putting it in and I should have listened to my senses.  I'll maybe make it again, with about half as much.

This was a really good pasta dish and not hard to make at all. I did not have any chicken stock on and so I substituede chicken broth and it was delicious. However I may cut the salt next time. My husband and nearly two year old son both loved it too!

This was great! I agree with other reviewers. I used a lot more than four mushrooms.  I put it on cheese tortelini.  It was a hit with my husband, and all three of my picky kids even ate a little.  We'll fix it again soon, and they'll take to it pretty quick.

this was a great pasta. My husband and friends really enjoyed this sauce. I only added 1/4 cup wine and a whole package of mushrooms. I also added sage, basil, parsley and tarragon. It was very yummy. I will be making this again for sure!!

Great recipe! I agree with the other reviews, use a package of sliced mushrooms and omit the salt.  I added 1/4 cup of grated parmesean cheese to the sauce, right before serving.  I also cooked 1lb of cubed chicken with 1Tbsp Italian seasoning, and added 1Tbsp minced garlic at the end of cooking it.  I added the chicken to the sauce at the end and it was delicious!

Excellent base recipe. Added 8 oz each of baby bella's and white mushrooms, a cooked cut up chicken breast, and substituted fresh Thai basil for the Italian seasoning. Also, used my homemade chicken stock which kicked it a notch. Will make again with my modifications and others suggestions.

This was pretty tasty!  I added a can of (drained) diced tomatoes and some (pre-cooked) italian sausage (actually turkey sausage b/c that's what we prefer) and it made an awesome meal.

i noticed a lot of the reviews mentioning it was a little bland so i added lots of mushrooms of course and prisutto which made it a bit more intresting. turned out really nice but for sure it is on the mild flavorwise. worth trying espishally if you have kids that like things mild

I had made some homemade pasta with basil today ad used this sauce to go with it.  It was very good.  I gave it a four because I used canned mushrooms and white cooking wine because that is what I had on hand.  I will definitely be making this more often.  Thanks for ssharing this recipe.

I loved that most of the ingredients were already staples in my cupboard.  I found this recipe a bit salty.  Next time i will use a low sodium chicken stock and salt to taste as i cook.  i agree that this recipe also needed more mushrooms.  All in all with a little tweeking, i made this a wonderful low-fat sauce with plenty of flavor.  Next time i plan to add shallots.

I really enjoyed this. I had a couple of adjustments to it.  I increased the chicken stock and white wine slightlys to make it a little more thinner.  I also used flour instead of cornstarch and it made no difference.  Once it was done a added about a tablespoon more sour cream to cream it a little more.  I loved it.  I also added more mushrooms then called for.  A keeper.

Used chicken stock from when I  roasted a chicken - it had carrots and onions in it.  It was delicious

This is a great base recipe. I've made it as written, and with multiple variations. My favorite is to add a lot more garlic, stew meat, and fresh cherry/grape tomatoes. As always, when using cornstarch add it to hot water and stir well before adding. As other reviewers have stated, a lot more than 4 mushrooms are needed unless your using the big portabellas. I usually use an 8oz package of baby portabellas and an 8 oz package of mixed mushrooms from Krogers if I'm going all veggie.

Was pretty good. I would suggest halving the Italian season and garlic.

I made some modifications to this recipe.  First, I added a chopped shallot, used vegetable broth and red wine instead of white.  I also used more mushrooms like other reviewers and switched to crimini for a more earthy flavor.  It was very good with the mushroom ravioli that we had with it.

The sauce is very nice, although I did mix the cornstarch with a little 1/2 and 1/2 so that it didn't clump.  I used a pound of mushrooms, not 4.  Because I was in the mood to, I added onions and spinach, but it would still be nice as written - adding more mushrooms of course.

I was in the mood for pasta with mushroom sauce and stumbled across this delightful recipe.  I added extra butter, mushrooms and garlic.  I didn't use chicken broth and replaced it with water.  I used half the wine and added ground red pepper to give it a kick.  I added extra salt.  I added extra cornstarch for thickness.  My preparation turned out too watery so I blended the pasta sauce into a puree.  We have enjoyed this sauce with penne pasta and thin spaghetti (whatever we had in the pantry).  My toddler enjoyed it, too.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Tasty recipe! I added a little bit more cornstarch to thicken the sauce, becuase I used the sauce over baked pork chops.

Edible, but very disapointing. I decreased the salt to 1/2 ts. and Italian seasonings to 1 ts. otherwise but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was VERY thin and needed A LOT more mushrooms. Also, I don't think adding the sour cream and then the cornstarch and then cooking longer is a very good idea. Normally, sour cream is the last thing added. Overall, this tasted like something from a box. My husband and I will not make this again.
