This recipe is very good for fall gatherings.  I had to make some adjustments because whole cranberries were not in stock at my local store, and I used strawberry cream cheese instead of pineapple (allergy), but the changes seemed to work and the appetizer was a hit at my dinner party!!  I would recommend this for any gathering.

Although I had never made this before, decided to bring it to a holiday gathering.  Served it with apples and pears - it was a hit!  Had many requests for the recipe!  Got comments that it was much better with fruit than crackers.

Assuming I did everything right, this dip was horrible.  I must admit that I used crackers only, instead of fruit, which may have some reason. (As other reviews said it was better with the fruit.)  The swiss, which I normally love, was overbearing.  Once you got past the strong taste of the cheese, you hit a dead end...it has no flavor.  Hope you have better luck.

Wow!  This was delightful.  Why would someone rate this with only 3 stars, saying her guests loved it, but she doesn't like Swiss cheese.  If you don't like Swiss cheese, why rate it?  Just feel bad for the person who submitted it.  It is an absolute 5 star - anyone who likes Swiss cheese would love it.  Very different, I just served it at my Euchre card party and it was a hit!!!

This recipe was awesome.  I took it to a gathering last night and had rave reviews!  I had several requests for the recipe. I am a professional chef, and friends always expect great things, and this recipe did not disappoint! This is going in my personal favorites file. Still scratching my head over the negative reviews.
I did make some lowfat changes- I used neufchatel cheese and added my own crushed pineapple and shredded my own low fat swiss.
Thanks for the great recipe.

Great recipe!  I just served this at a party and everyone loved it.  I used tart fruits to dip.  Only change I would make is to chop cranberries first so they are easier to get to with the fruit.  This is a keeper!

A+++ RECIPE!! I made this for an Aloha themed farewell party. Folks LOVED it. I live overseas so do not have access to the fancy cream cheeses that are in grocery stores in the US, so used 1/2 can crushed pineapple (drained) with the cream cheese. I served this with sliced apples and buttery crackers. It was a big hit and I will make it again!

Love this recipe.  It's now famous among my circle of friends and this is the most asked for appetizer at all get togethers.  It's very quick and easy to prepare.  I serve it with wheat thins because it makes for a nice blend of sweet and savory.  You are guaranteed to have people asking this recipe!

I thought this dip was excellent and I was looking for something different..out of the ordinary to serve to a group.  This definitely fit the bill and everyone who tried it seemed to like it, but I have served other dishes with better reception.  I'm giving it a 4 since it wasn't received as well, but I do think it's special.

I never leave such a low rating, but I just don't get it. The swiss cheese gives it such a bitter taste.  The cranberry flavor was overwhelming too.  I also had to cook it an extra 15 minutes and it still was very loose.  Sorry for the negative review, but this isn't for everyone.

Like a fondue without the burner! I added crushed almonds on top and since I had plain cream cheese, I substituted dried pineapple, mango and papaya. Excellent with sliced apples & pears, tasty with crackers.

Although the ingredient combination doesn't sound very good - it is!!  And it is so easy. I received lots of compliments on this dip, although most of us enjoyed it more with crackers and not so much with the apples.  I could not find shredded Swiss so I cut up a block of it into very small cubes - it worked fine.

This was something really different and I was surprised at how good it tasted.  Everyone at the party enjoyed it.  It made a little too much food though.  We dipped crackers in it.

Served this at a baby shower last week with apples and French bread. It's not only easy and delicious, but this dish presents well. I doubled it and served it in a chafing dish. It really looked like something out of a magazine and I'm bummed i didn't snap a pic. Not bad for a girl who can barely boil water!  This is definitely a keeper!

This is so good and diffferent, it is addictive!  I served it with crackers and fruit(apples and pears).  It was a huge hit.  I think next time I may add some nuts to the recipe. Enjoy!

Wonderful recipe!  I added 1/2 dried apricots and 1/2 dried cranberries b/c I didn't have enough cranberries on hand.  But I think I would like it even better w/ just cranberries.  I think the swiss was the perfect counterbalance to the sweetness of the fruit.  I also added just a litte bit of mozzarella, b/c I wanted the cheese to be all melty and stringy when it was warm.  Yum!  Thank you for sharing.

this was unique, I took the advice of others and used apples and pears and instead of crackers used ginger snaps.  I've already shared this one, can't wait for a winter night with a bottle of wine!!

This was an outstanding dish! I used neufchatel cheese, mixed with cream cheese, and hand shredded swiss cheese. Since I didn't have pineapples, I added a mix of chopped can fruit (similar to a fruit cocktail except this was Brazilian) which suited for the sweet taste the pineapple would have given it. Used fresh squeezed orange juice. Baked as directed, and it bubbled with nicely browned edges. Served with fruit and baguettes. It was devoured by friends over for a snow day. Thanks much for a great recipe!!! (Oh, this is a sweet dip, with a bit of savory flavor from the swiss cheese...so it may not suit everyone who are more familiar with cheeseballs and savory dips.)

This was incredible. Even my finicky relatives loved it! I would make it again and again. I didn't find the pineapple with the cream cheese so I just crushed some and added it to cream cheese. This is a permanent item in my recipe box!

This is an excellent recipe--I have had specific requests to bring this to a family event and have been asked for the recipe everytime I serve it!
