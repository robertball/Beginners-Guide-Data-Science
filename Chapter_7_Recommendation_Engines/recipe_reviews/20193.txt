I use this recipe with a little twist. I mix the minced garlic/dill/lemon juice with soft butter. Then drop balls of the butter mixture with onions on the salmon & cook in foil in the oven or BarBQ. I always receive compliments on how moist & tasty the salmon turns out.  Try it you'll love it!!

I made this recipe and the baked salmon II recipe at the same time. the baked salmon was great, full of flavor throughout the salmon. this one was great also but not as full of flavor. a little more bland but still was tasty. you really taste the good flavor of the salmon but with a nice taste on top. the other recipe was more infused in the whole flavor. probably cause the oil it calls for. this is lighter and i will probably make it again. thanx.

Very good we all loved it. I lined the foil with parchment instead of spraying with non stick spray. I also served it with a cold yogurt sauce consisting of plain yogurt, shallots, honey, fresh dill and lemon juice. Adding the scallions after the salmon was fully cooked also added a fresh taste and crunchy texture. Thanks!

This is the best salmon recipe I've ever tried. It is wonderful!! I only used 1 pound of salmon and cooked for the full 25 minutes, added a touch of olive oil, left out the green onions and added a touch of crushed red pepper for spice. I also cut a few slits in the top of the salmon so the flavors would soak through. This hit the nail on the head..turned out amazing.

I thought this was very good --and most importantly, easy. I don't understand why some users are calling it "bland." I like that it's rather mild (but still really tasty!). It doesn't overpower the taste of the salmon. I used dried dill, and squeezed the lemon juice over the fish, rather than topping it with slices, but only because I don't like an overly-lemony flavor and didn't want it to turn out too strong. Good recipe, and very easy!

This was very good.  I didn't have the dill, so I substitued italian spices and I used lemon juice instead of the slices.  It was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  I will be making this again.

This was so easy. You just chop up some dill, green onions and garlic. Top with sliced lemons and bake in the oven. It was my first time making salmon and it couldn't have turned out better. It was so simple yet very flavorful. I paired this with a creamy dill sauce that included lemon juice, green onions and dill. I served this with Broccoli with Lemon Butter sauce.

Excellent salmon recipe.  When my husband saw the salmon sitting on the stove waiting to go into the oven, he took the liberty of sprinkling lots of Montreal Seasoning (i think it was the spicy kind) all over the salmon fillet.  It turned out delicious and of course I used about 15 garlic cloves that I mashed up with my motar and pestle and spread all over the fillet.  I set my oven to low broil instead of 450 degress and it cooked for about 15 to 20 minutes. I cooked my fish on foil but I did not cover it.  My husband then poured a little sake around the outside of the fish when I took it out of the oven.  Needless to say the few changes we made turned out to be successful and we'll certainly rely on this recipe again in the future.  Thanks for sharing.

We were given 9 lbs. of FRESHLY CAUGHT salmon today.  I needed a new recipe & the GARLIC SALMON by far was the best our family has ever eaten. I'd use 2 cloves garlic next time, as the flavor was a bit strong for our 5 year old. Try  with FRENCH FRIED ZUCCHINI STICKS & Dill Rice.  Was wonderful!

This has got to be one of the best salmon dishes ever!!! I was making it for 2 people and used 2 individual salmon fillets. I seasoned them well and used 2 cloves of garlic per fillet. I also squeezed lemon juice over them as well as adding the sliced lemon etc. I was a bit concerned because there was no liquid to really get a steamed effect so i added a few knobs of butter and a slash of white wine to create a good steam and cooked for 20mins. The result was amazing, the parcels came out of the over like ballons so i knew the liquid had worked to steam well. I had also made a creamy dill and lemon sauce which was simple, fresh cream, fresh dill, juice of 1 whole lemon, salt, pepper and white wine, jutt experiment with quantitys and adjust to suit your own taste. i added the juice from the parcels to the sauce before serving so as not to loose any of the salmon flavour. I then served the salmon on a bed of the sauce and accompanied with baby new potatoes, green beans and carrots. I cook alot and like to think i have a high standard of cooking, but this is a dish that is so simple a non confident cook could make it. This recipe is of high restaurant standard and i will definately be using it alot in the future. Salmon is quite a robust fish and can take alot of flavour so you cant really over do it, its all down to personal taste but i would advise trying it!!!! Many thanks for the recipe, its up there in my top favourites!!!!!!

Okay.  Don't really like poached fish.  Salmon seems to lose its distinctive taste cooked this way.  Tried it once.  That was enough.

Great recipe!  Add some julienned veggies on top of the fish (fennel, carrot, celery, onion, etc.) and you have your vegetables in the same packet of foil PLUS they benefit from cooking with the lemon & herbs.  They keep the whole thing moist also.

I can't rate this as I have not tried it yet but it looks delicious.  Just have to comment though - it always amuses me when members give a recipe rave reviews and then I read the comments and they have changed just about everything in the original recipe! I'm going to give this a go but I won't be altering it.

I did as the first reviewer and mixed lemon juice, dill, and garlic into some softened butter and spread that on the salmon. Then I topped with the lemon slices and dill. My salmon was super thick so the flavor was pretty subtle, but this cooking method produced the moistest salmon I've ever made (I can't stand dry or overcooked fish, cooking long depletes the fish of its wonderful flavor!). Again, my salmon was super thick and I only cooked it for the 20 minutes...it was done to perfection!

FINALLY!  EUREKA!  PRAISE THE LORD!  OK, that being said.....I have never and I mean never-ever cooked a decent piece of salmon for hubby.  THIS WAS IT!  WA-LA.....so simple.  BUT, I followed another reviewers suggestion and mixed soft butter w/dill and garlic and brushed lemon juice over it (not TO much) gave it the sea salt and fresh cracked pepper treatment and wrapped in foil and cooked in a HOT oven (450) for 6-7 min. for a "thinner" piece.   Hubby ate the whole piece......head no longer hung in shame here.  THANK YOU for this recipe......needless to say: IT's a KEEPER!

LOVE this easy recipe. I have one important suggestion for this and all salmon recipes: make a few incisions in the salmon skin before baking - this ensures that the juices from the fat in the skin soak through the whole fish, making it juicier, and more flavorful!

I really enjoyed this simple recipe.  However, I did make a couple of changes.  I placed a little oil on the flesh of the salmon.  I scored it so that the seasonings would penetrate the fish.  I rubbed chopped garlic, salt and pepper, and chopped fresh dill on the fish.  Then I squeezed some lemon juice over it, followed by placing some lemon slices on top.  It was a perfect blend of flavors.  I did not use any onions.  When the fish was almost done, I placed a small pat of margarine on top and let it finish cooking.  Delicious!

This is our "go to" recipe for salmon. I have tried many other recipes, but always come back to this one. It really keeps the salmon moist, gives a nice flavor but doesn't overpower the salmon. I've used both fresh and dried dill, fresh lemon or lemon juice out of a bottle and have substituted chopped regular onion for green onion, all work well. If you have salmon with the skin still on one side do this, don't spray the foil on one side and put the skin there, when you pull it out of the oven the skin will stick to the foil and you can easily lift off the salmon. If you like moist not dried out salmon, give this a try! Healthy too, no added oils or fat.

Turned out great! I sprinkled dry dill over garlic and placed lemon slices on top. Didn't have green onions, but I sliced some white onion and put in the foil. Turned out very moist and flavorful!

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day and I must say that it was a hit! I took away one star only because I followed the change that some other reviewers recommended. I mixed the garlic and chopped dill with 2 tbsp butter and a few splashes of lemon juice. I followed the recipe but just spread that mixture on top of the salmon before the lemon slices and dill sprigs. I cooked it a bit longer than 25 minutes. It was delicious. The seasoning didn't over power the fish.The fish was nice and tender. It was just right.

We were slightly disappointed with this recipe, although we did change it up a little bit. I only used a 1/4 tsp of dried dill weed and only 2 cloves of garlic. I mixed the garlic and dill in melted butter and spread it on the salmon, then followed the rest of the recipe. I did not think it had a whole lot of flavor, so maybe I should have followed the recipe closer. However, when I asked my husband if I should make it again, he did say "yes".

My wife loved this one. I loved this one too. Very simple, quick and easy to make. I used Basa instead as I had no Salmon but it's definitely a keeper. Thanks for the simple straight and ez recipe!

Probably the best Salmon recipe I have tried.  I love garlic, so I added two or three more cloves and I doused the Salmon with lemon juice before cooking it.  It was amazing.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I was excited to try this after all of the rave reviews.  I found the overall flavor rather bland and guess in general I prefer my salmon baked to steamed in foil.  Will not make again.  Also, where the lemons touched the garlic, the garlic turned a bluish color and looked like mold, which was not very appealing.

I've been preparing Salmon and Trout using this simple method for 30 years, and it always turns out GREAT! I usually add a couple of pats of butter on top of the fish before crimping the foil closed, this makes it even richer and more flavorful! Works equally well over a campfire or in the oven! YUM!

This was easy and simple to make with on hand ingredients. My kind of entree! Salmon turned out perfectly cooked and very moist. Very garlicky which is just fine with me. Will make again!

This wasn't a big hit with us.  The salmon itself was tender and flaky.  However, I didn't find it terribly flavourful like I had expected it to be...somewhat dissappointing but still edible.  I wouldn't make again though.

A tasty recipe for salmon.  What I love most about this recipe is that you get a lot of delicious flavor without any added fat.  I used Mrs. Dash lemon pepper instead of salt and pepper, and it turned out fine.  I did need to cook it longer than the recommended amount of time.

I loved this recipe!  It was quick and easy and came out delicious.  I didn't cook it with lemon, though, and added Worcestershire sauce instead.  It added a great flavor that my family loved.

Loved it.  Super easy, and my 6 year old and 2 year old sons devoured it. I didn't have fresh dill weed, but just used dried and it was great.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  It was also an easy clean up since it was baked in tin foil.

I've made this a couple of times. First time was as it was written. This last time I used lemon juice and garlic powder. Both were really good. The dill sets it off. This is a keeper.

This was easy and good.  I cooked it on my grill and added capers.  The capers gave it an extra zing.  Maybe someone in an earlier post suggested that but I don't want to read all of them. We lovedit

Absolutely delicious!!  I don't like salmon but I try to fix it once or twice a year in a lame effort to be healthy!  This was so yummy that I had seconds and will be fixing it again soon.  The only thing I didn't add was green onions because I forgot to buy them but I don't think that was a make it or break it ingredient, however I will add it next time.  Thanks for turning me onto salmon Lilio!!

Not good for me.  The green in the dill was sucked out by the lemon and when I removed the lemon slices at the end the dill had turned my garlic lime green.  It looked awful.  I was almost afraid to eat it.  The taste, was not bad.  Would I make it again, no.  Especially if I was making it for company!!!  Not presentable at all.

I made this recipe last night and it was great! Instead of fresh garlic I used minced out of a jar. I use and keep fresh garlic as a standard staple but was in a hurry. Otherwise made it exactly like the recipe, the dill makes these recipes tasty use plenty. I did use parchment paper instead of spraying with oil, as suggested by another reviewer, which ensures the fish does not stick to the tinfoil at all. Simple and good will make again.

Wonderful! I took another reviewers advise and melted one tabespoon garlic butter and added the basil and garlic to it then poured over the salmon. I cooked for 20 minutes and it was perfect. Yum!

I couldn't find fresh dill in the store so I used the dried dill and it still turned out amazing!  I also used a piece of sea bass along with the salmon and it turned out even better.

Giving this four stars only because I did not follow the recipe totally. Did not have fresh lemon or fresh dill on hand so I made a marinade of olive oil, lemon juice, dried dill and cajun seasoning - let this sit for an hour and then baked as directed.  It came out really good - very moist and flavorful.  I have also made this using dried basil which was also very tasty.

This is similar to what I do with my salmon or shark fillets.   It's fast and easy with great results. I love to wrap up individual portions in different pieces of tin foil and just transfer the whole package to the serving plates. Then watch my guests faces when they open their packages at the table.

This was great.  I didn't have any lemons, so I mixed lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and dill and poured it over the salmon to marinade it for about a half hour before.  It was excellent.

I haven't been a big salmon fan in the past, but decided to try to eat more heart healthy fish.  This recipe was quick, easy, and very delicious!  I pretty much followed the exact recipe tailored for two servings, and I wouldn't change it.

I made this for a dinner party and it was fabulous.  I'd never made salmon before and was concerned I'd over cook it. This recipe is impossible to mess up; so easy!  The presentation was great, too, with the lemon slices and dill sprigs on every piece. Very colorful.  I made a sour cream-based dill sauce for dipping, and also served wild rice and salad.  I will make this again!

Very good! I left off the green onions because my boyfriend doesn't like them, and I needed to cook it longer - about 35 minutes (but it was a thick fillet).

Good stuff!  The store I went to did not have any fresh dill, so I used dried dill weed - just sprinkled it on there...  YUM!!  Served it with sauteed veggies.  This will be a regular dish in our home!

The salmon turned out perfect!  Very moist and flavorful, without using butter!  I do question the green onions, but I just took them off after baking.  Served with rice and green beans, great quick and easy meal!

Not the best tasting salmon I ever had! Didn't excite me at all and I love salmon. I get hungry watching bears eat salmon on nature shows. I would cut back on the lemon. The thin part of the fillet absorbed too much of the lemon juice. This recipe needs work but not hopeless.

This was really easy to make, especially when crunched for time. A little unsure about the cooking time, mine needed some more. Also, I would increase the serving size, the amount specified is good for one helping per person, and a small one at that! But bursting with flavor.

This was super easy to prepare.  I loved that there was no clean-up, either!  I used fresh dill from my garden and that added a nice zing to the dish.  I only used one scallion for two fillets, and next time, I'd use 2.  The scallion flavor seemed to get lost.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us, Lilio!

Very nice and moist, but don't assume that because it is in foil it can't be overcooked!
I bought soft butter, mixed with the garlic & dill and spread on the filets - nice extra touch
Will definitely make again

this recipe is very forgiving as how I didn't have the recipe in front of me when I made it missed the garlic and didn't have fresh dill. I used garlic and onion powder and dried dill and it was yummy and easy. Best part, no pan to clean.

I loved this recipe!!  We don't care for salmon that much but this was fantastic.  Added some cherry tomatoes in the foil. Yum.  Now we have plenty left over for salads.  I will use this every time I think of having salmon. Thanks!

I'm not a big fan of fish, but I like salmon if it's prepared properly. This recipe was wonderful and my 14 year old daughter loved it, too.

This was so good that people in my house are still talking about it! It was really easy, and although I forgot the green onions, it was still delicious. I over cooked one by accident making it a little dry, but according to my mom the flavor took away from the dryness of it. Very delicious; I will definitely be making this again!

Cook time was WAY too short.  Ended up broiling for 10 minutes afterwards to try to get salmon done.  Overall this is a ridiculous amount of excess work for very little in the flavor department.  In the future, I would just put salmon, salt/pepper, and chopped dill in a dish, use garlic press to get about 3-4 cloves on there, add scallions and lemon juice - skipping lemon slices and dill sprigs (which don't do much) and broil it 10-15 minutes on Hi without sealing it up in foil or any of that.  Much faster/easier with no loss on flavor.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I cooked for only 15 min and it was done perfectly.  I used a smaller piece of salmon and reduced the ingredients. At 15 mins, the salmon was perfect.  Will add to the food rotation.  My daughter, said it taste like five star restaurant dining.  Husband thought it was very good, but had opted out of salmon tonight due to just coming out of a stomach virus. But he took a taste and liked it and wants to try it again when he feels better...

I would have given it a four and a half if I could.  For as healthy as it was, it was delicious.  I used fresh herbs from the garden.  I think that was key.  fresh ingredients!

This was so good and flavorful!  I didn't have fresh dill so I used dried and I left out the green onions, with those being the only changes I made, I like that this tasted good and was so easy to make and the salmon was juicy instead of dry.  My filets were very thick, but thinner cuts would probably need a lesser cook time.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Fabulous! The seasonings are a perfect compliment to the salmon.  Baking in foil keeps the fish moist and tender.  One of the best salmon dishes I've ever had - wouldn't change a thing!

I can't say how much we loved this salmon! It was fabulous. I followed it exactly like it was written and it turned out so good. I will certainly be making it again. I also love that it is healthy and there's no oil or butter. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow...super SUPER good!  And really easy.  I squeezed a lemon over the fillets, then a tsp of garlic for each, topped with thinly sliced lemon, chives and red onions.  I only cooked 2 fillets, so I cut the oven time by a few minutes.

I added a little lemon juice before setting the lemon slices on top. Added a little extra zing to it, I think. I ate it with some fried soft tofu on the side and I thought it was great. It's an elegant looking dish that you can literally prepare in two minutes or less.

Yum. This is the only way I make salmon and it always comes out great. I use dry dill most of the time and leave out onions sometimes as well. Still really good. I love to make this and roasted tomatoes and have them for lunch the next day, both cold. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm really shocked at how good this recipe is! I put way more onion, garlic and pepper than the recipe called for, but I always do. I also left off the dill because I never use it. For how easy this was to prepare, I would never have guessed it would come out this tasty.

This was absolutely fabulous and so easy to prepare.  I used a bit more of the non-salmon ingredients because I was working with two pieces of salmon totaling 1 1/2 lbs. I needed it to be able to cover both pieces.  I suggest putting the garlic in the food processor, chopping it until it's almost done then throw in the dill. Finish chopping them together then press the dill/garlic mixture onto the surface of the fish.  The lemon slices make sure the tinfoil doesn't press down onto the fish and stick.

I thought that this was going to turn out very bland due to the lack of ingredients, but I loved it.  Nothing over powered the taste of the salmon, yet complimented it very well.

Just wonderful.  Very easy and quick to make.  I added an extra clove of garlic.  Will definitely be making this one again.

This is a good recipe although no salmon I've made in the oven has yet compared to salmon on the grill.  I preheated the oven and it still took 45 minutes for the fish to cook all the way through.  My son and husband siad that they'd rather squeeze lemon juice on the fish rather than have it accumulate on top with the laid-on lemon slices.  I liked that touch, however.   When you make this dish, go heavy on the spices, especially the garlic, dill, and green onion.  That will help it taste good.

I've made this recipe twice and it's turned out great both times.  One of my guests said "You know salmon is cooked well when you can eat the skin and not even notice it."  On the second time, I made a few modifications - I put the salmon directly in a glass pan that had some oil on the bottom to keep the fish from sticking.   I still covered it in foil.  I wasn't able to get fresh dill at the store this time, so I sprinkled dried dill weed on the fish.  It still turned out fantastic.  To present the fish nicely, I recommend using a glass dish, cutting the salmon into single serving pieces, placing a slice of lemon on each piece (this may require more lemon) and a sprig of dill on each lemon.

YUMMY!! I don't really eat a lot of fish. I don't like the "fishy" taste and smell. When I made this dish, I was amazed how wonderful it turned out. I didn't really change much from the recipe. I spread chopped garlic instead of fresh, on the entire fish. and instead of fresh dill, I bought it chopped in a litte seasoning bag. I can't wait to make this dish again........Thanks Lili!!!

This was excellent.  I used dried dill and white onion instead of green onion.  Also added a lot more garlic.  I will definately make this again if I can get my hands on some fresh salmon.

This was a delicious new salmon recipe, great for the oven! I usually like just throwing salmon in the bbq, 'cause it's easy and good, but this was really tasty. I added some dollups of butter on it and it came out fantastic. I e-mailed the recipe to my mom right away. Thanks!

Wow. So easy to prep, to bake, and absolutely delectable. A wonderful and never overpowering mix of garlic, lemon and dill, and in 22 minutes the salmon was perfectly flaky. A real treat

This was excellent - very moist and flaked easily
with a fork.  I sauteed about 5 slices of diced
onion in olive oil with additional minced garlic
and poured on top of the salmon.  I baked in the
oven - very easy.

This was very good -- I loved the fact that the salmon baked in aluminum foil. I used the new non-stick kind, and loosely followed the recipe. My kids don't like chunks of onions or garlic, so I just used some onion & garlic powder, and since I didn't have fresh dill, crushed some dry dill and sprinkled on one side for my husband and me (left the other side "green stuff-less for the kids). I also poured on a bit of Greek salad dressing and rubbed it in, before laying the lemon slices on top. Everyone loved it -- had little leftovers, and clean-up was so easy!

I have made this recipe more than once and it is an easy, low fat treat.  I always use fresh garlic, dried dill (which I rub together to release the flavors) and lemon juice since I always have those ingredients on hand.  However, I have made it with green as well as regular white onions but I recommend using the green onions for taste and presentation.  I usually make it in my toaster oven since I cook for one.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This salmon was o.k. I think the lemon flavor was too over powering, or maybe it is just that I enjoy my salmon cooked on the grill. But it was eaten by the family. Thanks for the recipe.

If your kids like salmon, they will LOVE this dish!  Super easy to prepare.  Mom & Dad love it because it is so tender and has absolutely no oil.  Very healthy.  I found that I needed to cook it a bit longer than indicated.  Watch it closely.

Very tasty recipe. I prepared the salmon as directed (with perhaps a bit more garlic and dill than called for). I placed it on the grill at a low temperature for about 25-30 mins. The end result was very moist. Will definitely make again!

This was great. Just started a new eating plan and this is perfect for it. Not supposed to have salt, and this did not need it after adding a little lemon juice . I probably used much more garlic than called for but I like garlic. Used 6 pre-peeled cloves with a press. I asked my daughter if she wanted a taste and she ate half. I used the tool that allows you to change the number of servings and made a single serving. This was yummy! Well have it at least once every couple of weeks!

My fillet cooked in precisely 20 minutes and clean up was a breeze.  The lemon rind left a slightly bitter taste on the fish so next time I will squeeze fresh lemon juice on top instead of layering with lemon slices.

This is a great recipe. Of course it depends on a few things like your thickness of salmon and your oven. For me, I've made this twice and it was noticeably better with thicker filets - because my oven runs hot I could have easily cooked it for 2-3 minutes less than I did (which was only 18 minutes) when I had thinner filets.
Also, I prefer to use some softened butter and mix in the dill, garlic, and pepper (no extra salt since I had salted butter) and then smear it over the filets, place lemon slices on top and bake wrapped in foil. I've made salmon a few other ways and this is almost foolproof! My fiance and I love it so much! It is better with fresh garlic than the squeeze-bottle pre-chopped kind (no surprise, but it is more noticeable here than with other recipes). And it's actually pretty cheap for cooking salmon, which I appreciate too.

OMG this was great.... I used dried dill weed not fresh.  I added two pats of butter on top of each piece of salmon and lowered the temp to 425.  It was done and I let it rest without opening the foil about 10 minutes.  Perfect and moist!!!

This was really good and the whole family enjoyed it.  At 20 minutes it wasn't quite done and so I went 4 minutes more.  24 minutes put the internal temp. around 155, so it was a little too long.  Fortunately, it wasn't too dry.  Next time I will cook it for 20, pull it out and let it rest in the foil for 5 minutes.  I would have liked the dill to be a little stronger, so next time I'll chop up a little more for sprinkling over the fish.  We ate this with steamed broccoli and "Chef John's (from Food Wishes)" "Braised Black Lentil's" recipe.  Everything was delicious!

It's a little on the bland side. I squeezed more lemon juice on my salmon after it was cooked. Overall it's a nice healthy dish.

This was easy but only okay.  Not sure what went wrong.  I may try with capers next time and see if that helps but this turned out pretty bland.

This salmon was out of this world!  My partner and I gobbled it down within minutes!  And then we wanted more!  So, back to the grocery for more salmon!
Lilio, bring on some more recipes!  Looking forward to it!

I'm a picky fish eater and don't take to any old fish dish. I decided to try this because we had salmon in the freezer we had caught on sale. Easy enough ingredients and preparation on this one. I used dried dill and had some garlic flavored olive oil on hand to coat the foil with. I also added a sprinkling of onion and garlic powder in addition to the real deal. Baked in oven care freely. I was impressed with the results. Even my picky 11 year old went back for more.

Easy, healthy, yummy and inexpensive...can't beat that!  The only change I made was to use Pampered Chef dill seasoning instead of fresh dill.

Great recipe. Did this on the bbq on a pre water soaked cedar plank (2 hrs soaking in sink of water) on med heat until done (tested with fork in the middle for flakiness) Can season board with salt before filet goes on top.  Was delicious!! Tastes great a day later also.

Fresh, easy, healthy and delicious!  This is a great recipe.  Garlic, lemon and dill are perfect flavors for salmon and the cooking method works great.  The salmon was moist and flavorful and we really enjoyed it.

I would use this recipe only to use it for something else, not as a main dish.  It lacks in flavor.  It isn't easy to penetrate the salmon with flavors.  The flavors just sit on top or run under while in the oven.   I believe it would be better on a pan, with butter and lots more lemons (lemon, butter + white wine reduction).    To salvage my expensive piece of atlantic salmon, I topped a spring salad off with a lemon hinted vinaigrette and had it cold for lunch.  It was much better than an entree.

It wasn't bad, but I didn't think the salmon had much flavor.  Will probably try some of the other garlic salmon recipes available on the site.

Amazing recipe.  I had never wrapped in aluminum foil and cooked in oven before.  I will do this from now on anytime I cook salmon in the oven!  It came out just right and SO moist.  The flavor in this recipe was also just delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm a southern girl, felt like it needed some butter. I cooked it for 25min and it was too dry.

This recipe was alright. I don't know that I would ever make it again though. The dill was a bit much for me. I prefer the sweeter tasting salmons.

this salmon is super moist. the foil cooks it perfectly.  i also liked that it was light in flavor but i serve it with some tzatziki sauce on the side just in case someone wants something extra.

This is a hit!The first time i cooked salmon for dinner and was hoping to make it for valentines day, but because i will be working that day so i made this earlier, and it was not a wasted night at all!!! I squeezed lemon on top of the salmon before baking and had it done within 20 minutes. Served it hot with baked potato and boiled green beans.

This was a three star, but after our changes, a 4!    We added red pepper flakes for some zing, and then dipped the salmon in a sauce made of relish and horseraradish sauce.  AWESOME!!!

This was very easy to make and quite tasty!  I added a lot more minced garlic than it called for as I love garlic and omitted the green onions.  This recipe is a keeper!

Yum.  I used lemon pepper in addition to the slices and added more garlic (merely because I love it) also I added sliced roma tomato, which gave it an awesome flavor.  This went over very well, Thanks Lili!

Delicious. It had great flavour and was very moist. I substituted dried dill weed for fresh and bottled lemon juice for the lemon slices, and it turned out great.

This salmon was very moist but it didn't have as much flavor as we'd like.  It tasted best when it was hottest, so dish it out last.

This is a salmon recipe that I'm going to stick with! I added lemon pepper seasoning and it had the perfect blend of tang and spice. My husband doesn't like lemon but he ate this right up. Thanks for a keeper!

This was great and so easy. I didn't have any dill so I used fresh tarragon and it was still very good. The best part was that cooking it in the foil pouch made for easy clean up. Thank you for sharing.

it was good! i would suggest using more garlic and lemon, so it wouldn't be blend. I cooked it at 400 degrees for 35 minutes instead and it came out very moist. I'll make it again, but will use more seasoning next time.

This was probably one of the easiest, most delicious, and healthiest recipes that I have ever made.  I will definitely make it over & over again.  Now there is no excuse to ever say that you have no time to make anything healthy & delicious to eat... it's really that fast & easy.

DH made this for dinner the other night and it was ok.  We both found the fish to be quite tangy (with the combination of lemon, dill and garlic), but DH forgot to add the green onions, so there wasn't really anything to offset the tanginess (although I don't know that the onions would have done much).  We enjoyed the tenderness and juiciness of the fish because of the steaming, but we probably won't make this dish again...there are several other salmon recipes that we prefer much more.

This was easy to make and good.  However I did find it a little dry.  I used pink salmon steaks that I had in my freezer.  I think that may be why they were dry.  Next time I try this I will use a sockeye filet.

Great recipe!  I didn't taste the fishy flavor as I do with some salmon recipes.  I just put one slice of lemon on each piece but I think I would put two round slices on each next time.

To keep this tasting fresh, leave the scallions out of the aluminum package and garnish the fish with them at the end.

Tender and easy to chew (post gastric bypass...gotta chewchewchew everything) but VERY bland. I used a lot more dill than the recipe called for and coated it with garlic and it didn't have much flavor. I drowned mine in the dill sauce (by Lisa) and it was really good with that.

This was pretty good. I did brush the fillets with a little olive oil before adding the remaining ingrediants but otherwise followed recipe. Threw them on the grill for about 15-20 minutes. Made a nice light meal. Only gave four stars because as recipe written they were good but not exceptional. However, I served the fish with the dill sauce submitted by Lisa and the combination was outstanding. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.

After trying the Baked Dijon Salmon recipe on this site, this just didn't stack up.  Overall, it was pretty bland & dry.  I used dry dill instead of fresh.  Maybe it would've helped to use fresh.  It was nothing to brag about.

We really enjoyed this one.  I didn't bother with fresh dill since I didn't have any on hand.  I merely sprinkle the filets with dried dill weed and that was sufficient.  This is easy and I'll make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good, i used dried spices because fresh weren't available. It lacked something.... i cooked it with carrots, onion, and celery for added flavor.  I'll probably use this as the base for my salmon cooking, as i liked the foil method.

This salmon recipe is simply the best.  It turns out fabulous every time!  It is the only recipe I use for salmon.  My hubby and I recently went to a fancy dinner at an upscale restaurant and had salmon.  Hubby leaned over to me and said, "Yours is so much better, honey."  Thank you so much for sharing this fantastic recipe!  I've substituted white onions for the green ones in the recipe when I forgot to buy them, and it turned out fine.  Yum!

This was very good.  I scaled recipe to 2 servings.  I didn't have fresh dill, so used dry.  Also didn't have any foil so I put it in a baking dish and did in the oven.  I added a little white wine also.  I cooked for 20 minutes, but I think next time would only do 15, was more done than I like it.  Will surely make again and will try the foil next time.

I would've given this 2 stars but my husband thought it should get 3. It was very bland. Needed a LOT of black pepper to make it have any zip at all. We will not be making it again. I was disappointed - definitely not a 5 star recipe in my book.

I made this for a potluck dinner at my house - it turned out fabulous - it was moist and delicious and clean up is a snap.  I omitted the green onion since my husband doesn't like onions but it was still flavorful and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very good.  Made a foil tent and put in on the grill.  Greased the foil with a little bit of butter and drizzled some sake (Japanese rice wine) over the top. Very flavorful and so easy.

very easy to make, however it has much more lemon flavor than I expected from just putting the lemons on the top. great if served with rice pilaf!

Since it was my son's birthday and he loves salmon, I thought I'd give this one a try although I'm not a seafood lover.  It was a big hit!  I've never cooked salmon before, but this was so easy.  I put it on the grill with a little extra garlic, lemon slices and dried dill weed. The presentation was beautiful, it was cooked to perfection and the aromas were a delight!  According to my family, this is definitely a make again dinner!

This was such an easy and wonderful recipe. We aren't big salmon fans but are trying to eat more of it, and this was a big winner! I used a whole lemon, and generously used the dill, garlic and green onions, and it turned out great. I also made a sauce with mayo, capers, lemon zest, dill, green onions and lemon juice to dip it in afterwards. We will definitely make this a lot in the future.

The most delicious Salmon I've ever had ! So moist and tender. Cooked perfectly at 25 mins. Because we love garlic, we added more.

Very nice dish. I left out the dill. I also seasoned with garlic salt as well. I threw my asparagus in the foil pack with the salmon, and added butter before closing. Boyfriend and I both loved this dish, super easy clean up!!!

I followed this except for using dried dill as I didn’t have fresh.  My fish was very dry and disappointing.  Have no idea what I did wrong.

So delicious! Made as written except didn’t have dill so just used a Montreal garlic herb spice I had. I did put a few small pats of butter on top of salmon before baking. It came out moist and delicious!

Didn't jab sprigs so just used flakes. Oven temp and time is a bit much. Either decrease temperature or time. Salmon was a bit dry but still a hit.

Really tasty salmon. I used dried dill, otherwise followed the recipe. Except - I added Laurie A’s yogurt-based sauce, and that really put it over the top! My only complaint: despite spraying the foil, I still lost all the skin from the fish. That’s pretty minor, though - wonderful recipe!

This is one of the best salmon recipes I have ever cooked.  It melts in your mouth and has such great flavor!  I used one of the suggestions from another review and made the butter balls with the garlic, dill and lemon juice and it truly is outstanding!

I’ve never had baked salmon, but after discovering this recipe, I will from now on. Delicious! I used what I had on hand which was dried dill, lemon, salt,pepper, & fresh chopped garlic (lots of it because I am a huge garlic lover). Even my picky roommate loved it & had seconds!Definitely a keeper in this household.

Easy to make and delicious. I don't believe it makes 6 serving. We used 1 lb of salmon and split between 2 people and it was amazing.

Made it exactly as written, really liked it, recommended it to a family member (who ended up also making it and really liking it), and have since been using it as my go-to fish recipe. I had previously made Baked Salmon II but I found it a bit too spicy/flavorful (though I can see why some would like it) - I prefer dishes that are more mild so this one - the Garlic Salmon recipe - was perfect.

Nice and quick combination of my favorite ingredient., baked it in a small dish and covered with foil. I served it with oven roasted; quartered red potatoes, baby carrots, diced onion, celery and a mix of seasonings tossed in olive oil. baked for a hour then added the garlic salmon for additional 25 min. Oven to table... Delicious! Thank you for the new ideas for salmon, my favorite.

I make salmon for health reasons only, but my husband and I actually liked this.  Kids said it was so-so, which is a big thumbs up when it comes to salmon.  This recipe is going in the salmon rotation.

This a great recipe for cooking fish for the first time! I did make slight changes since I don't like onions of any type, even though I probably would have liked it if it had them. Instead of the green onions I just add a slight bit of paprika and lemon pepper, very good!

Loved It!! I am not a fish fan and not only is this recipe easy, it tastes GREAT!!! I added shallots and squeezed a little lemon on top prior to putting in the oven... Also added cut little red potatoes and topped it off with green beans.

I put the salmon in aluminum foil in a baking pan, coat with olive oil, sprinkle with garlic slices, chopped green onions, dill, and pepper, seal the aluminum foil, and bake at 450 for 15 minutes.

Delicious I did this recipe like Adrienne twist with mixing the garlic with the butter. I also removed the top foil piece and drizzled honey atop the salmon and cooked for another 5 minutes.

This recipe is delicious and it presents well.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My husband and in-laws love this this dish!!!  My father-in-law declared that it was the best salmon that he has ever had!  I almost always make this dish once a week because it is very easy and my husband loves it.

This was pretty good as this was the first time I have ever had salmon. We are trying to eat healthier and have been eating a lot more fish. The only things I did different were I rubbed butter on foil instead of spray and I also did 4 individual serving foil packets. It was moist and very flavorful. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

It was a little too lemony for my taste, but I plan to do smaller lemon slices next time. It was very easy and delicious!

This recipe rocks! The Salmon is moist and flavorful. You touch it and it just melt! Adding more Thyme gives it more kick and taking out the garlic. Arrange the lemons on top nice and pretty and then add some asparagus for extra goodness!

My husband claimed that this is the best salmon he has ever eaten!  I used the foil method and splenda blend as described by a previous poster.  Delicious!

Delicious!  I used this fish with a brunch dish I made this afternoon: toast a couple of pieces of hearty bread (preferably homemade), spread cream cheese on the toast, top with salmon, a fried egg and salad on the side.  Decadent, filling and a tad bit trashy.

Very tasty I LOVE the lemony and dill flavors mixing together so I tried an expieriment on it the second time. I used dry dill instead of fresh and only lemon juice not the slices,but put slits inside the salmon so that the juices stayed on the salmon. This turned out working really well. The second expireiment was what to have on the side. We tried rice but that didnt work too well so we made roasted potatoes with a greek yogurt dip that had dill in it and that turned out being our #1 side dish. Overall a very tasty moist and good salmon recipe.

This is one of the better salmon recipes, that is on the light side.  Instead of baking this we cooked in foil on the grill for 22 minutes.  We will be using this recipe again, thanks.

This was amazing! I don't usually like salmon very much, but have been trying to eat it more. This was so good. Everyone in my family enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.

Yum yum! This is my new go-to recipe for any kind of fish. I used mahi-mahi, dried dill only, and left out the onions. I also tried the butter suggestion... The bf loved it too!

absolutely excellent. made it for a dinner party and got rave reviews. followed another reviewer's suggestion and made a dill cream sauce to set the salmon on - amazing. also followed her advice to add a few dabs of butter and a splash of wine to each packet to increase the steam factor (as she did, I put each in individual foil packets)

I did marinate the salmon in oil, garlic, and lemon juice for 1/2 hour - 1 hour to give it more flavor. I followed through with the seasoning and I put the salmon on a previously soaked overnight cedar plank then on the bbq for 20 minutes temp. of 350 to 400 degrees F.  No foil necessary.

I loved this recipe. We used chum salmon, because it was cheaper, and I drizzled a little bit of melted butter over before baking. Delicious!!

This was very good.  I used dried dill weed.  When the dill is growing in the garden in the summer, that would make it even better!  Healthy and Delicious

Very good.  The fiance really liked it and he's not a fish person.  I love dill and actually thought it could use a little more.  I'm sure I'll be making this again.

I am not a huge fan of salmon, but this was really good and it couldn't get much easier.  I used about a pound of salmon, but used about the same amount of seasoning and it was very flavorful.  Instead of fresh garlic and dill, I used dried dill and Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic and it was great. My six-year-old daughter loved it and actually had seconds. This is going into my permanent collection.  Thanks!

Why go out when you can eat like this at home?  This salmon is flavorful, tender, --simply delicious!

This turned out perfectly. I used wild salmon and it came out moist, flaky and really flavourful. I will cook all my salmon this way in the future. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was such a refreshing change from the norm.  I used minced garlic from a jar and it came out awesome.  THanks for the recipe.

This was very good and easy to prepare.  The salmon had a great texture and was very moist and I hate to admit it but I loved the "no clean up" part of cooking the fish in foil!  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty salmon. I marinated my salmon overnite and it was very flavorful.  I did use fresh dill and added a little extra garlic ( I used 4 cloves.)  Very good and easy recipe. I will definitely make this again.

This was very easy, and tasted wonderful.  Like many others, I didn't have fresh dill, so I used dry, and the results were great.  Thank you for sharing!

This was not only easy...it was super tasty, simple but delicious.  My husband even loved it and he doesn't usually like fish.  We had lots of left overs and so made sandwiches with it.  Just added a touch of mayo and it tasted absolutey delicious as a sandwich too!  Yum Yum Yum.

This was actually my first time cooking fish at home but this recipe was simple and easy with many ingredients already on hand so I wasn't afraid.  And the dish looks like a work of art with the fresh dill and lemons on top.  I will definitely make again!!  I paired with snap peas and basmati rice.

I've made this salmon several times.  Each time I think it might turn out better than I remember, but it doesn't.  Generally I think this recipe is bland and watery.  I've tried not wrapping it in foil, and that helps with the wateriness.  I don't have any bright ideas for the blandness.

Made this last night.  My husband (lovingly) teased me about the presentation - I told him I couldn't help it!  You cook it like that and it just is that pretty as you take it out of the oven.  Very easy and tasty.  And I thought I only liked salmon raw before trying this!

This recipe was easy and fun to make. Out of the whole meal, it was actually THE EASIEST part. It came out VERY moist. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the flavor. The only changes I made were that I halved the recipe. It still came out great.

This was pretty good. It was the first time I had cooked for my girlfriend so I think she was bias - she claims to have loved it. I think it was a lot like almost any Salmon that you cook.

Excellent salmon!  Made it for my wife and I first wedding anniversary and she thinks I should make it a tradition and make it each anniversary.  The only thing I wondered about was the presentation, it didn't turn out to look as good as some other reviewers have mentioned.  Both the dill and the green onions turned almost black and the lemons of course completely fell apart.  But who cares about presentation...the dish was delicious!  Thank you!

This was a very delicious recipe.  I also basted my salmon with herb flavored butter and skipped the lemon on a few of them, for variety.  My 6 year old couldn't stop eatting cause he kept asking for more "chicken".

Cooked this for my wife last week.  She said it was as good or better than anything we've had in restaurants while dining out.  We really loaded this down with chopped garlic and dill to bring out the flavor of the spices.  Served with steamed broccoli and a salad.  Wonderful!
