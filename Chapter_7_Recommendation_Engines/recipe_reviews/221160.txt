This was good! My husband loved it. Though I must admit that I really braised the chicken, brussel sprouts and potatoes instead of pan roasting. After cooking the bacon, I browned the chicken breasts in the bacon drippings. Then I added about a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan to saute the garlic and added the brussel sprouts, potatoes, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Then I added a little chicken broth  and returned the chicken to the pan. I covered it and put it in the oven to cook at 350 for about 40 minutes and it was perfect. Maybe next time I'll actually pan roast it with the lemon slices. I'm sure it is excellent. Thank you LAMBR for sharing this recipe.

I did as the other reviewer said and braised it.  

- Browned bacon and removed.  
- Browned boneless chicken chicken and removed.   
- Browned garlic with 1 T olive oil.   
- Added brussel sprouts back in and tossed.  
- Added Sweet potatoes diced  since I had no regular potatoes 
- Added lemon juice, salt pepper as per recipe.  
- Put bacon on top.  
- Added chicken back in. 
- Added 2 c chicken stock.  Next time I might do less.   
- Braised for 35 minutes

Sauce was awesome! and everybody ate it surprise dhow much they liked the brussel spouts.   A definite repeat!

Hi, this is my recipe and I would use at least a pound of sprouts not a 1/2 pound. My sons tell me I never cook enough of the sprouts.

I loved this recipe; we love all the ingredients so it made sense that the dish turned out as expected.  One change for next time: omit the sliced lemons on the bottom.  The lemon slices cooked down and it would be overwhelming to get a piece of the cooked rind in a mouthful; that's the only change I will make.  Otherwise, a really great recipe!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because my whole family loved it, and ate it up without complaining!  But I must admit I had no bacon, so I skipped that step and also used drumsticks instead of breasts.  I knew that the drumsticks would cook fast, so I baked at 375 C and cut my potatoes into eighths instead of quarters.  Turned out great!

I only made one little change.  I used the  bacon drippings  as part  replacement of the olive oil and decreased totla dripping/ olive oil to 3 tablessppons.  This is the perfect  dish I was looking for all in one  pan.  I use  my cast iron skillet to cook bacon and then used the sam  skillet to complete the  dish.  Thanks  (I too increased the amout of Brussel sprouts

I followed the recipe to a T and the lemon pith in the bottom of the pan ended up giving them a very bitter taste. And my potatoes didn't cook at that high of a temp, ended up dropping it down to 350 & covering it to finally get them done.  I also had to make a 2nd batch of the lemon garlic sauce to get everything coated well.
It smelled absolutely wonderful cooking though!  I will try it again because it's a great combination of ingredients, but I will not put the lemon on the bottom as called for.  Maybe I'll do like the other reviewers said & just cook everything in the pan together.

like the concept, but my little tweak was that i like my vegetables separate from the rest. stuck to the exact ingredients for the b.s. (but in it's own pan). really liked the sauce but gave it minced garlic, rosemary, and parsley for the chicken & potatoes for just that extra ummph. was totally delicious

I found this recipe while looking for something to do with Brussel Sprouts, which I'd be cooking for the first time. I had everything except the Lemon slices, but other than that I made the dish exactly as written. We loved it! My wife and I thought the Sprouts  were the best tasting thing in the dish.  The flavor of the lemon juice really popped on them. I felt mighty fancy pulling this dish out of the oven, lol! Kinda out of the norm for us but that was the point. Great recipe!

As many others have said the potatoes and sprouts had a very bitter taste from the lemon rind.  We basically had to throw them away.  The chicken was delicious.  Seemed that the temperature was too high (the potatoes were burning).  I took the pan out of the oven at 45 minutes and the chicken was done.

I baked this longer at a lower temperature, and it turned out great. More Brussels sprouts would've made it even better.

Delicious! Based on other reviews, I omitted the sliced lemon and doubled the brussels sprouts. I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts (and therefore reduced the cooking time and temperature slightly). It was perfect -- definitely a keeper!

This was very good! I used boneless chicken breasts and cut the cooking time to 40 min and cooked @ 425 degrees. The other change I made was to omit the lemon slices since the reviews were negative on them. It was a quick and delicious as well as healthy!! Thanks for sharing!

First, I browned chicken thighs in a pan w/ olive oil, then removed to a baking dish after about 10 min. I added some sweet vermouth, and parsley to the drippings/ oli to make a sauce. I par-boiled the sprouts before adding to the Baking dish too. Then I sliced about 1/2 pkg. of mushrooms and added that to the dish. Put it into a 425 oven and loosely covered w/ foil for 45 min. Absolutely delish! Will cook tihs again,
Thanks for the idea!

I had no problem with the lemons burning though I also braised the chicken thighs first so I only cooked my for 45 minutes.  I added green beans, sautéed mushrooms with shallots in a splash of wine and also used 1 pound of Brussels sprouts.

I love this dressing. I have made this both ways with the chicken ( boneless) and without Just veggies) I liked the dressing on the chicken. it reminded me of some of the dishes at the local Greek restaurant.. my husband though prefers his chicken without the dressing, but we both agree the lemon dressing on potatoes tastes like the ones the Greek rest. serves.

I loved this recipe and wouldn't change a thing! If you don't love lemon, don't make it, because it's the perfect mix of flavours exactly as it is. A bonus: the pan cleaned up so easily! Must be a combination of the oil and the lemons in the bottom... I would highly recommend this, and I can't wait to have company, because I will make this and everyone will be suitably impressed I'm sure!!!!

I loved this! Husband and the kids not so much fans of the Brussel sprouts. Don't use two lemons even if you use more chicken. In this case more is not better ;-) not a good weeknight meal. Next time I may try broccoli and make this on a Sunday. Oh and I braised the veggies and the chicken in the bacon grease before loading in the oven pan.

Definitely tasty and a good recipe, but unfortunately the Brussels sprouts and potatoes burned to a crisp. Chicken was excellent, however. Wondering if I should have covered the pan?

Followed the recipe and loved it. Had enough left over since I cook for one, for two dinners after getting home from work.  Going to make it again next week!  I used boneless breasts and it worked perfectly!

This was AMAZING!! I rarely cook bone-in chicken breasts so this was a little different for my family but it was such a hit! I doubled the "sauce" part and cooked extra sprouts and potatoes. The lemon slices cooked down so well my husband ate them along with the rest. Then I tried just making this for a potato/sprout side dish and it was good; but it didn't have the depth of flavor as it did when I cooked it with the chicken and lemon slices. It's a keeper!

This was excellent. I admit I was sceptical at first but I followed what “Mari” said plus added some seasoning. I used a cast iron skillet, cooked bacon and browned chicken in the bacon grease, then cooked the Brussels sprouts, potatoes and garlic. Scattered the lemon slices on top of the potato mixture and then put  the chicken on top and sprinkled the bacon over the chicken. Covered  with foil and baked for 40 minutes. Removed foil and cooked for 5 minutes. It was wonderful! The hubby loved it! Woohoo...score!
Thank you

I made this almost exactly as written but cooked the bacon, and then the whole dish, in an electric cooker using bone-in skin-on leg quarters. Everyone Loved it! Will use more Brussels sprouts next time. A+

Need to quantify the amount of lemon. I used one lemon (juiced) and the entire meal was like sucking on a ripe lemon. Waaaaaay too much. I won't try it again.

I made this for the first time tonight after saving it to favorites months ago.  My husband gave it a 10 and said it looked like a gourmet meal.  My 18-year-old son, who has the palate of a toddler, gave it a thumbs up and even ate the Brussels sprouts.  The only thing I changed was followed reviews of others and braised the Brussels sprouts in the bacon grease.  I also used Meyer lemon cut very thin to line the bottom of the pan.  The lemon was not overpowering or acidic as some other reviewers commented.  Oh, and definitely double the Brussels sprouts!  This is absolutely going into my dinner rotation.

This is delicious! I made a couple of changes - my husband does not like brussels sprouts so I used broccoli.  I did not put the lemons on the bottom and I made an extra batch of the sauce to pour over everything before I put it in the oven.  I used boneless breasts and the broccoli so I set the oven on 400 instead of 450 and it only took about 40 minutes.  

I will definitely make it again and will try braising everything before putting it in the oven next time.  I think I will then cut the temperature to 375 for the 40 minutes.

It was  lot of preperation.  It came out very well.   I used thighs with skin instead of breasts.  I will probably  make it again with the breasts.

We were having a gathering for our whole family...all 17 of us! i marinated the chicken with the lemon marinade and made a separate marinade for the Brussel sprouts and potatoes.  I cooked the chicken in my smoker because we had such a large quantity and cooked the veggies in the oven as directed.  Veggies got a little overcooked.  I probably should have adjusted the cooking temp and time.  Never-the-less....everyone (kids and all) LOVED it!!!

I did not have chicken breasts on hand so I made it with pork chops and frozen, but thawed Brussels sprouts.  The dish was good, but I believe the chicken breasts and fresh Brussels sprouts would be better.  I cooked for 60 minutes which was too long for the chops.  Loved the flavor though and I will make it again.

A dish you can make with little clean up, a favourite throughout the house.  My household likes lemons , I use an extra half of lemon to line the bottom of the dish and garnish the chicken with one slice on top of it with the remaining lemon half.

Didn't change anything, made it exactly as directed. Did not have enough marinade to spoon over the chicken and did not buy enough lemons to make more. But I was able to rub the chicken in the brussel sprouts and potatoes to coat it well enough.  1 hour at 450 degrees was about 10-15 mins too long so next time will check it after 45 mins.  Was really good. Easy to put together and easy to clean up.  So a keeper all around. Thanks.

We enjoyed it. The lemon was great with the sprouts. I could have used a bit more flavor overall. The only change I made was to add a bit of the bacon drippings to the oil/lemon juice mix. I'd eat it again, but it won't be a go-to recipe.

I made  the recipe but found it to be overly lemony and bland for any other flavors.  I will make it again, skip covering the bottom with lemon slices, and I will salt and pepper the sprouts and potatoes , maybe sprinkle with some thyme.  The chicken was great (I seasoned with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and poultry seasoning on top).  Very flavorful.  Also I used chicken thighs and covered the dish with foil after 40 minutes, and turned down to 375 for the last 20 minutes.  The chicken and veggies were perfectly cooked.

I made this with thighs instead of breasts. I also doubled the recipe because I had a large quantity of thighs that had to be used. I found it a little on the lemony side, so next time I will cut the amount of lemon juice in half. Other than that, this was good! I followed the recipe exactly. My chicken was not dry, and everything cooked perfectly in 60 minutes!

I was expecting more flavor, something like Greek cuisine, with the lemon and pepper, but found it quite bland. Cooked it at 350 for an hour and by then the potatoes and sprouts were pretty mushy. Sorry, won't make again.

I liked this recipe.  Baked 45 minutes 425 degrees with 2 large bone-in breasts. I think they would have been overdone cooked any longer. Will definitely make again.

Outstanding and easy. I cooked it in a cast iron skillet in the oven. I used baby red potatoes sliced. I would double the Brussel sprouts because 1/2 a pound doesn't leave many leftovers. I did use only two bone in chicken breast halves because there are only two of us. There's still enough for dinner tomorrow. My husband raved about it. Definitely a keeper and I know it will be done many more times!

This was okay. I appreciated the simple ingredients and the ease of preparation - however I feel like the flavors didn't come together well. I would have preferred more garlic, and I needed a lot more salt and pepper. I didn't care for the lemon sauce on the potatoes, but liked it on the brussels sprouts. I don't think I will make this again as written.

Awesome one skillet meal! I followed others suggestions and skipped the lemon slices-- I only had lemon juice on hand so I used that instead. I also used less oil than it called for, but I was only cooking two chicken breasts so if there had been four thighs like the recipe says, I would probably have needed more. All in all this was great.

I added some sliced onions & fresh mushrooms on top of the brussel sprouts. Needed to add more lemon juice & oil (and some parsley)to have enough for the chicken. I had only 2 strips of bacon in the house & as it turned out that was plenty.  Really tasty. We all enjoyed it. Will make it again for sure.

I omitted the bacon (because I didn't have any), used boneless breasts, new potatoes, and Meyers lemons. It came out great!! Even better the next day.

I made this recipe pretty much as it was.  I had some legs and drumsticks to use up so I substituted those instead.  Directions were a little confusing and I just cooked the bacon in a small skillet and put the chicken in with the roasting pan with the sprouts and potatoes and cooked it up that way.  Came out great.  In the future I would probably increase the sprouts and cut back a little on the potatoes.  The lemon with the sprouts was so good I may just work on a recipe with just lemon sprouts.  Will make again!

This recipe was both delicious and easy to prepare.  Instead of 5 tbsp of olive oil, I used the leftover bacon grease plus the remainder in olive oil similar to what Mari suggested.  I was nervous about a 'too lemony flavour' (based on what other reviewers said) so I used six thin slices and that seemed to be an appropriate flavour.  if you're not keen on lemons, i'd probably leave out the slices.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

I liked how quick this meal was to prepare but next time I would definitely NOT place lemons on the bottom of the baking dish.   I followed this receipe to a T and unfortunately the lemons overwhelmed the brussel sprouts and potatoes.  The chicken turned out fantastic and moist.  I will definitely make this again sans extra lemon. :)
