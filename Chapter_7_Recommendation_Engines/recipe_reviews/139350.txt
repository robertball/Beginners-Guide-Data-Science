This was a unique kind of grilled cheese... and I like unique!You can taste all the different layers of the flavors while your eating it.It tasted like a combination of french toast and grilled cheese. This would probably be a good recipe for a brunch.I followed the recipe exactly. I used a granny smith apple and smoked ham, but the recipe doesn't specify, so you can use whatever you like.

I really liked this! It was different and good! I used green apple and didnt peel it and I used sharp cheddar. Turned out very nice, I'm sure I'll make it again :)

I love these grilled cheese sandwiches. I omit the egg, and simply grill it like a regular grilled cheese, or I bake them in a 400 degree oven if I'm making them for everyone for dinner. I spread a little mayo and brown mustard on my bread and then simply layer ham, sharp cheddar and sometimes monterey jack cheese, and thinly sliced apples. They're delicious, and make a quick lunch or dinner.

So delicious! I didn't add the ham, but the combination of the cheese/apples on a grilled sandwich..yummy! Filling all on it's own or maybe a cup of soup for a heartier dinner.

I was not pleased with how this sandwich turned out.  It was a quick fix for dinner but the taste was not as great as I had anticipated.  I did leave out the mayo and I added oregano so maybe if I had stuck to the original recipe they would have turned out better.

This was pretty good.  I tried it according to the recipe and liked it alright but it seemed bland.  I added some lemon juice to keep the apples from oxidizing and to add some extra flavor and put the leftovers in the fridge for the next day.  Then I tried it wrapped up in a tortilla and baked in the oven until the cheese was melted, omitting the egg dip step.  Definitely better with the lemon juice and tortilla.  Less fat too.

I had to give this recipe 4 stars, but with my alterations, I would rate it 5.  I make this sandwich with thinly sliced, high-quality ham such as Boar's Head.  I use green, pink lady, or gala apples and I never remove the peel.  I then simply layer the ham, apple, and cheese on the bread (I like using bakery bread like a honey wheat), dip in egg, and grill.  I would never chop the ham and add mayo - the sandwich is so delicious and so much better for you without it!

I think you definitely need to use a tart apple for this.  Sometimes I use bacon in place of the ham and saute some red onion and add that to the mix.  Versatile and tasty!

MMMM MMMM GOOD! I didn't even dip it into the egg mixture. Just made it and toasted it up in the pan w/ a pat of butter like a regular grilled cheese. Everyone loved it, especially my 6 yr. old!

Yum! I used soy 'ham' and all-natural canola mayonnaise with granny smith apple and cheddar. This was so good. I debated the mayo, but I love the mayo I used. I would never use 'salad dressing' type spread--but real mayo is delicious on this! I think it would be great on light rye bread as well.

This was a nice little sandwich.  I noticed that there was mention to add milk but milk was not listed in the ingredients. I added about 3 tablespoons. About the same amount you would use when making French toast. Overall I thought the sandwich was tasty but I still felt it needed a little something.  I might try it again and add a little bit of cinnamon. It could also be the apples I chose. I used Fuji apples because that is what I had in the house. I was expecting a little more sweetness from the recipe.

I tried out this grilled cheese not know what to expect. I mean apples with mayo? but, on the other hand, it was AMAZING! I made this grilled cheese using red apples and smoked ham with yarlsburg cheese and chibatta bread. If you want a more crispier bread, skip the milk with egg and just go with the butter. One thing that I have to remember is to cut the apple THINLY. you don't want them too thick or then they will fall out of the bread.

We loved the recipe. The french toast was a nice idea. For a change, we like to omit the mayo, and use drained crushed pineapple in place of the apples.

This was a wonderful sandwich. Being an apple lover I am always ready to try something new. These flavors blended so well together. I think this would also be great made with chicken salad. I will make this often. Thanks for the great recipe.

Not sure about the apples!!
If you don't like the texture of onions, then you wont like the apples in this sandwich. Overall it was good but, my daughter especially won't eat it with the apples.

This was the 1st recipe I ever tried out on allrecipes and I was not a fan. The mayo seemed to overpower the entire sandwich.  Whenever I tell my husband that I am going to try a new dish he always brings up my disastrous first try at making something new because (as I put it) "but it has 4 stars!".  Definitely a less than 1 star meal for my family.

Great sandwich. Next time I would thinly slice the ham and apple instead of cubing them so that it is easier to eat.

I love this recipe! Kids loved every bit of it. Even the little picky one who swore off granny smith apples chomped down on every bite to he end.  Next time I'm going to use less mayo and butter.  I might throw a random bacon steio in there. This sandwich is #1 in our home now beating out even pb&j!
