I am not a fan of biscotti, but my mother loves it and I make it for her.  I am also not a fan of out of the box.  Now after all that I love these and so does my mother.  I made them when the mix first came out.  I was in a hurry at the time.  They do smell wonderful and taste good also.  It is nice to mix something together fast that does taste good for a change.  I still make them from scratch most of the time but do give these a chance.  I think you will like them.

Almost gave this five stars. Might end up changing it if they grow on me. Almost didn't try it because I HATE cake mixes but a friend had shared some with me when she had some extra and I thought I'd give this a try. Mine was carrot cake and I drizzled it with white chocolate. You could probably get pretty creative with the box mixes. I might try out a lemon one.  Also, noticed the directions didn't have instructions to slice the logs before the second baking. I did do that and I don't know how they would've turned out if I hadnt.
