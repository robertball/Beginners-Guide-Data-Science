made the recipe with and without cayenne and love it both ways.  Without cayenne seems to work better with kids, cayenne loved by the adults!  Used purple basil as a milder alternative to Genovese.  Will be making this recipe over and over again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My daughter and I made this for a class project. This was our sample run, before we make it for school. I loved it the way it is, however, my daughter wants to omit the basil and reduce the cayenne for the class bunch. We live in Tennessee and she doesn't think her classmates can handle that much spice. We used the three ounce paper bathroom cups and wooden cocktail forks (purchased at the dollar store) and were able to make 15 mini paletas. The paper can be torn off the frozen paletas when they are ready to be eaten.

It was really delicious! Adults loved with cayanne most. We donÂ´t have fresh and juicy mangos in our country, so I did it with East End Mango Pulp puree. If I  like to be more exact on measurements in the future, please tell me how much pulp or puree do you get from 3 mangos? (then I know how much puree I have to take).

These were so delicious when I was making them that I could barely wait for them to freeze. Delightful and exquisite are the words that come to mind. The basil, salt, and cayenne pepper really elevate the taste of the mango.
