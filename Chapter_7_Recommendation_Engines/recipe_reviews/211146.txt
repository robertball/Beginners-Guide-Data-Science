This was SO GOOD!!!  The flavor combo with all the spices was perfect!!  I didn't have enough dried garlic so I used fresh, and thats the only change!!!  My ham hock had a ton of meat so I cut back on the sausage some.  For newbies, and it's not stated in the recipe, you have to pull your ham hock out near the end and cut off the meat, discard the bones and put the chopped meat back in with the beans.  Great recipe!!!!

Great recipe!!  I did soak the red beans overnight, and I didn't have a ham hock, but other than that, I made this recipe as written.  We all enjoyed this very much!!

Tasty!  My only change was to cook up a small onion in place of the dried onion and I did not use smoked sausage just because I didn't have any.  Otherwise I followed it to a 'T' and it was good.  Maybe could use a little more salt or some hot sauce, but that is a personal preference that can easily be added to this recipe after the fact.  Thanks!

This was a good recipe. I think maybe it would have been better if I'd used fresh garlic and onion. This is definitely the best red beans and rice I've fixed, but I can't say I was blown away by it. I was a little worried that all of the seasoning would be a bit much, but it really blended together nicely. Still searching for the perfect red beans and rice recipe.

After several failed attempts at cooking dry beans, I achieved success with this recipe (probably more technique than this specific recipe, but I followed these directions exactly).  The whole family loved it, which was a nice suprise.

This dish was relatively simple.  I made mine in a crock pot and added sausage and a little bacon rendered for flavor.  When I served it to my family they devoured it!  I was super impressed because we have a cajun background so I knew I was "competing" with some seriously heavy hitters in the red beans and rice department.  Thanks CLFGRL!! Yours rocks!!

Delicious.  I used half the cayenne and red pepper flakes because I was serving it to kids, and I used minced fresh onion and garlic.  The middle-schoolers gobbled it up!  Will definitely make it again and use full pepper amounts for my own family.  Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE A WEEK LATER- made it for the family and this time i did a quick soak (boil then let sit in covered pot for one hour) instead of overnight soak.  Not as good.  Next time I will go back to her directions to soak overnight.  I let this cook over super low heat pretty much all day long.  The longer the better, I think, because it gets thick and rich.   Next time I will also start with half the salt because after that long cooking, the salt was really concentrated, especially with all that sausage.

I loved this.  I used my a little more of my homemade broth and added the rice to cook with the beans and New Mexican chili powder.   Froze great and so good.

Hot Italian sausage. Take small French bread sub rolls and cut them in half. Scoop out the inside part of the roll and refill it with the red beans, rice and sausage. I call it a Cajun ice cream cone and you eat it just like one. Great for those cold Sunday football parties and tailgating at the stadium.

This recipe is awesome. The first time I made it, the entire family enjoyed it, even those who aren't really bean-eaters. Having lived in Louisiana for a couple of years, I can honestly say this tastes truly Cajun. I'm now making it for the second time, and plan to use this recipe often.

Yum, yum!  So good!  I wasn't exactly sure how much water because it just said to cover the beans with water.  And I also wasn't sure if I should simmer covered or uncovered.  5 hours seemed like a long time uncovered.  So, I did the last hour or so covered.  It was really thick the next day (after being refrigerated), but I just added a little water before heating up and it was perfect for my taste.  But, the taste was great!  Thank you!

very good classic recipe. A bit spicy, but I didn't really mind. I used canned beans (2 cans non drained) and cooked on low in a crockpot for about 4 hrs. I also cooked the sausage in a frying pan before adding to the pot about 30 mins before serving. It serves 2-3 people. Double the recipe if you are serving more.

This is a great recipe for a great dish.  When the senior military officer I work for asked for Red Beans and Rice, it had been a long time since I had prepared it, so I refrenced this version. i still have my position, so I keep using it today. the only change I make is that I use fresh onions and garlic. I have used dry and it's just as tasty. Thanks CLFGRL!!

Very good!  I used fresh garlic, added a little thyme and smoked paprika, and left out the sausage.  I smashed some of the beans before serving.  The only thing I will change next time is to add some ham or bacon to add a little more meaty-ness to it.  I served as a side so I didn't want to add sausage and make it overly meaty.

I've been making this for years and I do it in the slow cooker, BUT be sure you boil your red beans for 10 minutes. They are the only bean that cannot be cooked strictly in the slow cooker, they contain a toxin that needs to be boiled out.  Please be safe with your slow cooking, adults could likely stand the dose of toxins with just a bit of tummy discomfort , but you could put a little one in the ER with it.

It was amazing. True southern flavor. I have been searching for a good red beans and rice recipe and this is it. No mention of rice though? I used basmati rice and served the beans on top. Can't wait for leftovers!

This is a good basic quick recipe for red beans and rice.  I prefer fresh garlic (2-3 toes finely chopped), one large onion chopped, and then following the recipe from there.  Remember, do not salt your beans until after they almost fully cooked, otherwise they will not soften as nice as you might like.  The hock is for seasoning.  I have used smoked pork chops, ham shanks or omitted the pork and used a low sodium chicken stock and added a little more smoked sausage near the end of the cooking time.  Happy eating!

Great and easy recipe. I left off the bay leaf because I didn't have any and the cayenne pepper because I'm whimpy.

Great recipe! This was my first time making beans and rice, and it turned out like a charm! Two things I did different, were to use bacon instead of sausage (it was all I had on hand), and I used fresh onion. Hubby absolutely LOVED it, and after we each enjoyed a good helping, I froze the leftovers for future meals (since it's only the two of us at home).

Made it for the second time just now. It was wonderful - spices were just perfect in taste, although I did cut the salt by half for health reasons and substituted  truvia for sugar. Overdid the andouille sausage first time, plan to only add about half the quantity. Followed the recipe pretty much both times though. However, as Clara Peller once said, "Where's the (beef) RICE?!"

Wow- what a fantastic and easy recipe! I agree that the slow process on the stove is the way to go to make this recipe shine. I used goya small pink beans because that's what I had and I used powdered onion because I didn't have any fresh. Still came out fantastic! I had to add water like 3 times just to cover so they wouldn't dry out while cooking. Very delicious and a bit spicey which I love!

Thanks for listing this. I needed to find a good red beans and rice recipe with cumin, and I was pleased to see celery seed listed as well. The proportions of spices are excellent.

I soak the beans overnight, then I put them in the trusty crock pot, set to low, with 4 cups of chicken stock.  I normally add 1 ham hock and some smoked jowls  sliced.  I use 1 onion and one bell pepper and 3 stocks of celery chopped.  I put some dried parsley and if i got it a couple cloves of chopped garlic, if not I use garlic powder.  I normally do not salt until the very end.  I add pepper and Louisiana Hot Sauce and Worcestershire Sauce.  I add the andouille about 1 hour before I am ready to turn off the crock pot normally the 7 hour mark.  I serve this over a scoop of white rice with a nice slice of cornbread on the side.

I had some red beans that needed to be used up, and I've heard a lot about beans and rice, so I thought I would give it a try. I forgot to soak the beans overnight, so I tried to quick soak them, but I didn't do it right. Oh well... I didn't have a ham hock, so I just left that out. I used smoked turkey sausage and it turned out great. The only thing that didn't work was the beans weren't as creamy as I would like, but I think if I soak them overnight and maybe cook them a bit longer, it'll turn out great. I'll definitely make this again!

Loved this....omg it was so flavorful. I did not let the beans soak this long. I boiled in about six cups of water on high for 2-5 mins, removed from heat and let stand for an hour. Also I was quite spicy I would limit the cayenne. But this dish will have you saying, "laissez bon temps rouler."

This is so simple and but tastes like you spent all day on it. It’s so flavorful and not loaded in tomato sauce but has really great flavor! I’ve been making red beans and rice for years but this is by far my favorite recipe for it. I soaked the beans overnight and cut up fresh garlic because I had it and yellow onion and used my instant pot which keeps it from drying out all day! Loved it...

1st time making red beans and rice, and to ever cook dry beans. This came out very delicious! I used tips from other reviewers as well. When I started my pot, I put everything in except for the sausage, fresh onions, and garlic. After a few hrs of simmering, I took my ham hock out and shredded the meat on it, put it back in the pot. Taste tested the beans and adjusted my seasonings. Wish I used two hocks, I didn't realize how little meat there was on it, but that helped me determine how much sausage to use. After I did the ham hock, I sliced andouille sausages in halves and cooked that in a separate pan with diced onions. I like a crisp bite to my sausage, and when they were near done I added the garlic and let that cook down. Then added that to the bean pot with some Tony Chachure's creole seasoning. It came out really salty after the creole seasoning, but I just stirred in a bit more water and let everything simmer for about another 45 mins to settle in. I started my white rice in the meantime. Everything came out so good! I didn't even mashed any beans and it still had a thick bean gravy texture. I'd do this all over again, just with more ham hock meat.

Reminds me of my Grandma's cooking! I haven't tasted her hammocks and red beans for a very long time and I was wanting to find a recipe to bring back the loving memories. This recipe does it! I've made it 4 times now and I with every bite I'm taken back to her dinner table.

I thought I’d try this recipe because people were raving about the seasonings being so good. I know it’s not anywhere near authentic. The celery seed is very overpowering. My husband and I found it to be extremely salty. I’m going to have to stick to my authentic recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it exactly as stated, except I used fresh garlic and onions. I also boiled my ham hock for a couple of hours before I added the beans to really get as much flavor as possible out of it. This is the easiest and most tastiest recipe for red beans and rice.

It turned out very well. I have been eating it for the past couple of days!! I did have cook for a very long time more than the suggest time in the slow cooker to get the thickness of "gravy" that the beans make.

Yum. I added a little oregano and chopped onion.  I also used no salt product to replace salt since I'm on a low salt diet. You could also use the ham seasoning instead of ham in a pinch.  I think I'll go easier on the cayenne pepper next time.   I love it hot but a few people in our family can't handle the heat.  It was really spiced.

It was really good! I used fresh garlic and onion in my recipe. 
There was ham left on the bone but I also put in chorizo sausage instead of the turkey kielbasa. Mine came out fairly spicy because I used a little more cayenne than called for and put some Cajun seasoning in also.
Fantastic recipe, I'd recommend it to everyone!

This was easy to make and turned out great! I used diced onion and minced garlic instead of dried just because I didn't have it. Also, I took the advice from another reviewer and took the meat of the ham hock and discarded the bone after it simmered.  FYI for those of you (myself included) that do not veer from a recipe, especially the first time it's made.  I will definitely be making this again.

Amazing!!! Omitted the red pepper flakes because of my children; it was so good!!!!!!
Update: I have made this numerous times and have reduced the celery seed to 1/4 tsp because it had a mildly bitter aftertaste.

Very tasty! Served 40 guests at a seminar with the food being a Southern theme. I am a California Bay Area girl and have never done Rice and Beans. Thought it might be too spicy, but it was a hit. Cranked up the servings on the recipe to 35. Used pinto beans (personally I don't like red), didn't soak them, used Italian sausage, fresh garlic, diced onion and 1/2 the salt according to the recipe. There were several other bean dishes and tons of other food... there was only 3-4 servings left. Dinner! Delish.

My family loves this recipe. I had never cooked it before this recipe came across my screen. After following it to the letter, I have been able to whip it out pretty quick. The only changes I'd do is the bean type, and the sausages i've used. But that's after some experimenting on my part. Otherwise, thank you for sharing this!
