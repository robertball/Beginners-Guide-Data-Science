I made this dish with 1/2cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup since I wanted to serve it as part of dinner.  My 3 year old daughter is very picky, and I wanted to include carrots in her diet somehow.  She abusolutely loved it.  So did I and my husband. It still tasted like a dessert.  I may make it with even less sugar next time.

I used this recipe as an alternative to pumpkin pie, to use up an enormous yield of garden carrots.  My family loves it.  With fresh carrots, it requires no added sugar.  With older or store-bought carrots, you can add up to 1/2 cup sugar.  Do not add the full 3/4 cup or it will be insanely sweet.

I used less sugar than required as well.  Also, I used pumpkin pie spice (which has cinnamon in it).  I really enjoyed it and I've made several with rave reviews.  This recipe works really well for carrots that are "past their prime" and rubbery.

I have to review this because it has become a family favorite! Both of my kids (5 & 7) love carrot pie, and they cheer when I make it! My family is grain-free and sugar-free, so I've made a few easy adjustments. First, instead of a crust, I just pour the filling into small ramekins and everyone gets their own special serving. Instead of sugar, I substitute 1/2 c. honey, and I use 1/2 c. almond milk instead of the milk. This is a wonderfully sweet treat and a great way to get the kids to eat their veggies!

Excellent recipe, but it's missing a key ingredient. 1/2 tsp ground ginger. This was a desert staple in my house growing up. You can't beat it!

Delicious. I made this mostly as the recipe calls for, but I followed others' advice about adding less sugar. I used only about 1/3 cup. I also made these into "mini pies", by putting the pastry dough into muffin cups and adding enough carrot filling into each until it almost reached the top of the pastry dough. After they were cooked, I let them cool, put them them into a metal tin and severed them cold 2 days later while on a camping trip - everyone loved them!

This pie was ok. It wasn't really what I expected. It has sort of a pumpkin pie taste but with carrots and the blend of those two flavors don't really go well together.

I made this for Xmas everbody seem to like this pie. It tastes like a cross between a pumpkin and carrots.  Spice  is like pumpkin/sweet potato there is a strong carrots flavor. You will take more of a carrots flavor unlike pumpkin/sweet potato which have a more harmonized flavor.

well i just made this, i cut the recipe in half and baked it in a custard cup (no crust).  I was slightly shy a cup of carrots and only used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup milk, the vanilla was closer to a tsp and i added more cinnamon and i added nutmeg, will probably add some ginger or cloves. or pumpkin pie spice for easier baking. I mixed everything together and blended up in the blended. came out smoothe. I baked it for 10 mins at 400 and its cooked about 10-12 mins at 350. Its alot cheaper alternative to pumpkin pie. will definately make again. Thanks alot for the recipe!

I'm in love with this pie and so was everyone else at my dinner table last night.  So much better than pumpkin, in my opinion, and very cost effective.  I added cardamom and cloves to it and used brown sugar instead for a more desserty feel.  I'm not sure if carrot pie is a regional thing, but up here, it took some convincing for my friends to eat it as it had never been seen before.  What a hit!

Delicious! I used 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of the 3/4 cup white sugar. I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and allspice and 1/4 teaspoon ginger. Also, I used a mostly whole-wheat crust and added pecans and a few walnuts to the top of the pie.

I'm late to the party but when helping a friend move; she had all these cans of carrots she was going to trash that was not expired. I like fresh carrots myself but I figured I'd make a pie with them. She laughed at me but I found this recipe and to be honest I used less sugar more spice and vanilla.  I added a bit of lemon just because. Well, we both were surprised because we liked it and so did our friends.  We didn't have milk but there was some heavy cream in the fridge so we used that.  Not exactly low cal, but hey!  we only ate a slice. :-) gonna try it with walnuts or pecans next.

I made this carrot pie last minute for Thanksgiving. It was a huge hit and many people wanted the recipe! Thanks for sharing :) I will post my photos soon. I made it with the easy buttery pie crust recipe that is also on here. This was an easy and fun pie. I made little carrots with the excess dough and put it on the middle of the pie as a decoration! A lot of fun.

YUMMY and so simple. it's all about making sure the carrots are steamed for about 10-15 minutes then you have a very smooth consistency when they are pureed. I added a little bit of pumpkin pie spice along with the other ingredients. YUMMY.

I had never had this type of pie, it seemed odd to make a pie from carrots but it was so good!  Try it!  I will definitely have it again!

Based on other reviews, I made it with only 1/2 cup of sugar and it was perfect! It was still sweet, but not sickeningly so. Our 4 children (ages 10, 8, 7, 2) all loved it and begged for more. This worked well as a after-school treat, a dinner side, or a breakfast side. It had less than a tablespoon of sugar per slice, so I was happy to let my kiddos have seconds.

I used up the rest of the carrots in my fridge, had no idea how many carrots I used but it was enough. It tasted a lot like pumpkin pie but there was a very distinct carrot flavor to it. Everyone liked it.

I love this pie, I have made it several times. My favorite change to it is to use Vanilla Almond Milk instead of regular milk. It adds a slight almond flavor and additional vanilla notes.

I made it in the microwave and i loved it. 5 Star. Tasted like moist roasted sickomode and sounded like Mo Bamba in the microwave cooking. The only thing that wasn't ideal was that it took 45 hours to cook.  Still 5 stars.

Omg yes! I made this on a whim. I accidentally bought a big bag of carrots and had to find recipes to use them up. Saw this and I’d never heard of a carrot pie. But I makes sense now. I mean pumpkin and sweet potato are delicious. So I made this exactly as stated to give it a fair rating. Well I made 1 difference and blended the carrots with milk. Because my blender was too weak to blend without a liquid. Anyway. So delicious. If you like pumpkin and sweet potato pie and candied carrots you can’t go wrong with this recipe. Oh I did use a graham cracker crust I had frozen in the freezer. But that shouldn’t have made a major difference.

It was surprisingly delicious, I did change a few things, 1/2 cup pure maple syrup in place of the sugar, and three cups chopped carrots instead of two, it boiled down to two cups worth.

Wow everyone liked this-even the kids!! Great to have another option for preparing carrots. Even the picky eaters. After reading the reviews, I used less sugar- about 1/3 c.- and it was still very sweet. We were having as a side to chicken dinner - maybe next time I will use no sugar as one of the other reviewers suggested. I also baked individual pies in a muffin pan so reduced cooking time to about 40 min total.

I made this for Epic Pi Day, having never heard of or tasted carrot pie. It was delicious, the whole family loved it! We used 1/2c sugar as others recommended. I also had added 1/3c water while blending the carrots. This led to a gooey pie finish, so I'll instead use the milk for that part when we make this again. Very tasty pie!
