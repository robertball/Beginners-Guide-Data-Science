Really loved these potatoes, super easy and loved the flavor.  I didnt use quite the amount of green pepper, just because we arent really crazy about a strong green pepper taste.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Super easy clean up too . . . will definitely fix again!!!

Fabulous! Loved, loved this recipe ~ everyone did. Made just as written but with 4 green onions for the green pepper. This is reminiscent of scalloped potatoes, but with a very unique and delicious twist. I would use the oven next time, as the sauce leaked out of the (well sealed) foil which made turning the packet impossible, so I had issues with the whole thing sticking terribly to the foil. I would cover my casserole pan the entire time they're in the oven though, as I wouldn't want to compromise the incredible creaminess and flavor of the sauce and potatoes ~  this must be due to the 'steaming' these get in the foil packet. Thanks for submitting a great recipe.

I'm not sure why others found it bland... We thought it was perfect served with "Kickin' Crunchy Oven 'Fried' Chicken". For the sauce I added garlic powder and used a combination of browned flour and all-purpose. Also added sliced mushrooms, red bell pepper and green onions. We sliced the potatoes instead of dicing. We baked it in the oven at 350F for an hour, covered with aluminum foil. We think it might get more kick from some grainy Dijon mustard. EDIT: Made it again, and it's way better! I sauteed about two teaspoons of minced garlic in the butter before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients. I did let the flour lightly brown. I added about one or two tablespoons of grainy (or old-fashioned) Dijon mustard. The sauce will initially taste salty on its own, but once added to the potatoes and whatever other veggies you're using that saltiness will dissipate. It is so good made this way! The second time we cooked in the oven with a roast that was rubbed with Dijonnaise (a combination of Dijon mustard and mayonnaise) and 'All-Around Spice Rub' from AR. We did slice it up as it was not down after an hour then browned the slices in a pan. Moist and juicy, even the next day. YUM.

This was good, and so easy!  I bought the wrong pepper- a red one instead of green, but just used it anyway, and it was good in there.  The potatoes were cooked to perfection in the time stated in the recipe.  The white sauce was easy to make; this one is hard to mess up!

This was the dish Recipe Group chose last week, and my husband and I loved it.  I added garlic powder only because so many reviewers said it needed it.  I baked it, covered, in a 425 degree oven for about 40 minutes.

Made these for Recipe Group. I didn't want to heat the grill up, so cooked them in the oven. They were just ok. Son didn't like them. Wasn't a whole lot of flavor, just kind of bland. I added just a little ivory/red bell pepper, it really came through strong for some reason. Thanks anyway!

Really tasty! I followed the ingredients as is, and would not change a thing. Rather than using the grill, I did these in the oven at 350 for one hour. Our family all loved this potato casserole, thanks for posting the recipe......

We loved these!  I opted to bake them in the oven at 350 degrees and they took longer than 50 minutes to cook through.  I will cook at higher temp next time or try on the grill.  Delicious!!

I didn't have green bells but had some red bell pepper in the garden, but did put in some dried green bell peppers, used red potatoes. I made it in a throw away tin casserole dish on the grill, easier than foil packets. Since I used red potatoes it was done in 35 minutes. Husband topped his with some cheese, I topped mine with some caramelized onions I had made, a nice addition.

This recipe is a keeper. I followed the review suggesting to add garlic to the butter and flour mixture. Also added about 2/3 cup of grated asiago cheese to the sauce. Finally, I cooked in the oven and lined the casserole dish with foil for easy cleanup.

After reading the reviews about this being bland I spiced it up a bit with some garlic and tyme. It was still bland. I might try this again with more aggressive spicing and some spicy sausage as I liked the consistency.

This is easy an versatile, however, we didn't care for the celery seed.  It takes on an odd flavor when heated.  I sprayed the foil with pam and it came off easily.  Also divided the packets in three - easy reheat in the oven or grill if there are left overs.  I would make again without the celery seed.

I made this in the oven as it was a very wet day and I was unable to use the grill. It was a huge hit. I did add some grated cheese to the top and left all other ingredients the same. The celery seed is what gives it that little kick so do not omit it. I turned leftovers into a meal the next day by adding spicy sausage and mushrooms. Yummy yummy!!!

Easy to make. Not as spicy as I would have liked so needed to adjust. I have tried it two ways, in the tin foil turned out perfect. Tried it in a tin pan on the second go around on the grill which did not turn out so well.

My grill is down for the count so I baked this in a 425F oven.  We really didn't care for the green pepper, it seemed to overwhelm everything else.  I would be inclined to omit the green pepper and add different spices if I make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was delicious.

I have a problem however, I cannot follow recipe exactly. I almost made it through this one with no additions or changes. 

First, our grill is a small charcoal grill and there isn't room for meat and potatoes so I needed to cook them in the oven - 180C for about an hour.

I sprayed a glass backing dish, added the potatoes and then sprinkled the top with a garlic heart seasoning, covered with foil and baked for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, I removed the foil, covered the top with shredded cheddar cheese, and baked (uncovered) about 30 minutes more.

There was a small serving spoon left that will go nicely with the one remaining pork chop.

Thanks for a great recipe! I am confident that even without my additions this would be quite tasty! I will definitely make this again!

This called for green bell pepper, but I use the red bell pepper and it was very good too. And it brighten up the color up too.

I made this for the Recipe Exchange Group Recipe for the week of September 6th. This is a fairly classic scalloped potatoes recipe. I use unsalted butter, so for my purposes, I should've added more salt, but failed to do so. I did double the celery seed and seasoned pepper. I chose a Harry & David garlic pepper blend, because I felt like this recipe needed garlic. All in all this isn't bad, but the bell pepper wasn't my favorite in this, and it needed more salt and garlic (for me, anyway). I cooked mine in the oven @400 covered for 35 minutes and 15 minutes uncovered at the end to brown it. Thanks for the recipe, I'd try this again on the grill sometime with additional salt & fresh garlic!

Despite the minced garlic and garlic powder I added, this was still quite bland. I ended up putting sriracha on top to eat it. I think it would have been better with seasoned bread crumbs on top, but I will probably not be trying this recipe again.

I don't know what happened!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY except the potatoes were't done after over an hour on the grill.  Grill thermometer registered 350º during the entire time.  The potatoes weren't all cooked through but the parts that were weren't very good.
