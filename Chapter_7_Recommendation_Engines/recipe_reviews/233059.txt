We were split on this one; half of us loved it, the others thought it was only ok.  Those that love garlic and basil will like these and they were a nice change of pace from the normal beef burger. The garlic was very strong in it and I wish I had used garlic powder instead of fresh. I only used 1 serving of egg beaters, mixed the rest per the recipe and refrigerated for 2 hrs prior to grilling.  The burgers held their shape fine.  Just a general tip, when mixing any type of burgers with add ins (like onions or liquids), refrigerate the mixture a few hours prior to shaping and cooking.  This not only lets the flavors blend together, it also helps the burgers retain their shape.

I traded the horseradish for honey mustard and eliminated the garlic due to allergies. The egg does make very it very moist but I grilled them on foil.  A second time I added 1/4 cup of Gluten free cornflake crumbs to firm the mix. I love this burger!

After adding only 1/4 cup Eggbeaters (not 1/2 cup as specified in the recipe), the meat mixture was so wet that I was afraid it was going to fall through the grates on the grill and be impossible to flip.  I ended up using a grill pan and cooking on top of the stove.  On the positive side, these turkey burgers really do taste good, but honestly, I have to wonder if the egg substitute is even necessary.

1/2 Cup of Eggbeaters was FAR too much!  I would cut that in half, or do as we did and add grated parmesan to the meat mixture.  We also used roasted red peppers instead of tomato, melted fresh mozzarella on the burgers, sliced fresh English cucumber for a little crunch, used fresh Arugula instead of boring plain lettuce and finished it off with aged balsalmic vinegar.  TRULY AMAZING

These burgers are delicious! I added a small amount of breadcrumbs to the meat mixture to help them stay together better on the grill.

this was pretty good.. i sauteed the onions before adding them in.. i used dried basil for the fresh.. left out the horseradish b/c in my experience the flavor diminshes when cooked.. i figured we could add it on the end product.. i upped the soy sauce (not light) to 1.5 tsp and wish i would have done one full tablespoon like i wanted to in the first place.. i'd also double the pepper next time.. i left out the egg substitute (couldn't see the point).. ty for something easy/simple
