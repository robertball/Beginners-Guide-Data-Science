Closest to authentic I've found, even has the actual  darker  more genuine color than the usual bright red restaurant versions.  I do add (4) 1/4" thick fresh ginger coins, smashed and chopped, to the sauce before cooking.  I've even had to make it without the Hoisin sauce (none on hand, and no black bean sauce to make any) , and it still came out great.

You can also use "country style pork ribs" for this - they're nothing more than pork butt (shoulder) cut in ~2 square strips.

For leaner diets, use a pork tenderloin or thick cut boneless pork chops, taking an extra step to brine them before marinading, to keep them moist and juicy.  Also, I find that the soy sauce adds enough salt, you don't need the kosher salt at the end (especially if you've brined the pork first).

For those who don't want (or can't) use a grill for this [I only have a pellet smoker/grill at home, and don't want the smoke flavor], you can still do this quite well in the oven.  To do so, simply use a sheet pan lined with foil or parchment, and lay them out on a lightly greased rack - cooking oil spray is great for this.  Bake at 275º for 2 hours, basting them every 20 minutes with the sauce (6 times), and turning them every other baste (3 times).  Be sure to get the sides when basting.

They will cook better, without the bottoms getting soggy (even with turning), if you raise the rack off of the sheet pan by about 2", either using small drinking glasses or similar, or racks with fold-out legs.  This all

This is a great dish if you are looking for a tasty Chinese style BBQ!  I followed directions as written, leaving out only the cayenne pepper so my 2 year old could eat it.  I marinaded these overnight.  Delicious.  My go-to recipe for Chinese BBQ! Thanks for another hit,  Chef John.

Absolutely great recipe! I used pork tenderloin instead of pork shoulder and I couldn't find five spice powder or star anise at my local supermarket so I substituted allspice with a pinch of ginger.  The results were phenomenal. I do plan on finding some five spice powder for the next time I make this. Because, there WILL be a next time.

I was pleasantly surprised with how good this turned out. While it didn't taste exactly as the bbq pork from Chinatown tastes, it is a more than worthy substitute. I made my marinade with oyster sauce (which is slightly sweeter)  instead of hoisin because I never have hoisin on hand. I did not use dye, and I put about half a cup of sauce to side. With the rest I marinated 3 lbs of country ribs for 24 hours. I baked this at 325 for 2 hours then used the remaining sauce to glaze it every 20 minutes or so until it reached 170. Next time I would put aside more sauce because it was pretty delicious. My kids and I snacked on this plain and kept going back for more. With what we had left I made fried rice and they raved about it. I would definitely do this again. As a Chinese person who grew up on bbq pork, I was very pleased with this. The only changes I might make is to very slightly dial back the 5 spice and  for my personal tastes make it slightly sweeter. Thank you, Chef John! You did great!

I made this as written except for a few small changes: 1) I used country ribs because that's what I had on hand, 2) I did not add additional salt at the end, and 3) did not use any red food coloring. This is a fantastic recipe, the pork came out as I had tasted it in Chinatown.  After boiling the remaining sauce, I used it to baste the ribs several times during the grilling process, and the pork came out red enough without the food dye. The flavor was right on. Thank you Chef John, for another outstanding recipe.

This was AMAZING!!!  My hubby could not stop raving about how delicious it was!  Cut my pork tenderloin into 4 equal pieces and let it marinate for 18 hours before grilling low and slow on the BBQ.  Basted it occasionally with the reserved marinade after I reduced it on the stove.  Sliced it up and served it with fried rice, bok choy and the extra sauce.  Better than store bought or takeout and super easy to make!!  You knocked it out of the park with this one, Chef John!!  Thank you for sharing!!

This was very good! I made some changes since I did not have rice wine, hoisin or cayenne on hand. I used rice wine vinegar, teriyaki and chili powder as substitutes. I also used pork loin and added 1 tsp onion powder. Saved the leftovers for pork fried rice another night.

We loved it!!!  I "Keto-ized" it and had to substitute Japanese 7 spice for the Chinese 5 spice as my supermarket didn't carry the  Chinese 5 spice.  Next time I think I will add some ginger and sesame oil just to tweak it a little bit--but--it was great and will do again.

Loved this! I didn't have as much time to marinate it as i would have liked, but it was still very good. I cooked it in the electric smoker with cherry chips. Nummy!

Family, most of whom are not crazy about pork, absolutely loved this. “You can make this anytime,” was refrain from my wife and daughter. Followed the recipe exactly, except used boneless country ribs in lieu of cutting up a pork shoulder (same cut of meat). Served this with garlic snow peas and chinese fried noodles. Positively delicious!

Made ribs.  No cayenne . Marinated  overnight.  Basted with boiled marinade in 300 degree oven for two hours 
Will add a bit of ginger next time. Delish with fried rice on the side.

This is a third review on this dish.  I have cooked it with three different kinds of pork: shoulder, tenderloin and sirloin.  Going from left or right that is fatty, lean and in between.  I did not indirect cook so the cooking time and appearance is totally different.  Takes about 25 minutes with grill direct at temperature at ~275 as suggested.  The sirloin was the best but took more time to trim.  The marinade for all three was the same.  The shoulder was, for our means, too fatty and with excessive gristle (maybe just the particular cut?), the tenderloin was a bit non-descript and did not taste like pork - just the sauce, and the sirloin (you have to ask your butcher exactly for this cut) was, as the little pig said, just right.  A great combination of tender, flavorful and without the excessive fat.  Disclaimer #1: you do have to do a bit more trimming.  Disclaimer #2: I marinated all three times for 2 days.  Love Chef John's recipes!  This recipe will remain in the often-made list.

This is no doubt the best and easy to follow recipe, even if you don’t have a big green egg grill to do it you can still using the conventional oven at home, don’t have cayenne pepper but go well with chili peppers!!!

This is a good recipe for a BBQ sauce instead of the AH SO sauce I have used. I did slow cook pork in the oven and put under the boiler in the end. Served whice rice and stir-fry onion, peppers, and mushrooms. I would make this again and try grilling next time.

This is my go-to recipe for pork tenderloins. In the winter, I put the tenderloins on a baking rack and bake for about 30-45 minutes. I also don't throw away the marinade - I bring it to a boil and simmer for a few minutes to reduce it and use it as a topping.

Loved this. My husband frequently travels to San Francisco and visits Chinatown while there... he said "this tastes as good as anything I've had in Chinatown". That said, I had a big mess to clean up since it snowed 8" the day this was planned and buried our grill... so I did it in the oven, placing it straight on the oven rack @ 275 with a foil-covered sheet pan on the rack below it. I basted with boiled sauce every 20-30 minutes for 2 hours. Flipping the pork over once mid-way. Cleaning the oven rack was a chore but the pork turned out fantastic with a little char and all. I made plain basmati rice and an Asian coleslaw as side dishes, which worked out well.

It was a really good recipe. I found the Chinese 5 Spice flavor a bit overwhelming though. I will only put in half next time. I chose to cook mine in the smoker, low and slow. My son said he thought it was better than any restaurant bbq pork because he liked the smoked flavor, but agreed it had too much of a licorice flavor and we need to cut down on the five spice next time.

Definitely a keeper!  I didn't have Hoisin so I substituted BBQ sauce and fennel seeds (Google search for alternative), it was a big hit.

It smelled better than it tasted. The only substitution we made was to use rice vinegar instead of sherry because the sherry disappeared before I made the dish. The leftovers did not re-heat well and were rubbery.

It's all in the sauce as the old saying goes. I started making this and found that I did not had any hoisin sauce but found a quick fix with soy sauce, peanut butter and some garlic powder. The barbecue came out moist and very tasty.

It’s a great item to make. The longer they marinate the better they taste. Plus any left overs, make great items to pack up for lunch at work or school.

I've made this twice now. The first time I used pork country ribs, because it was on sale. I used a butt the second time. Both were very good. I did not use pink salt, just regular sea salt (I don't have kosher). I marinaded about 4-5 hours. I can't be bothered with the over-night thing.I also cooked it in the oven. I have not mastered the slow cook BBQ thing yet. I also would not have had time, unless I wanted to eat at 10:00 pm. Great BBQ pork recipe !

This was really good. I liked how it had the right amount of heat and flavor. I used pork tenderloin because I wanted to use it up and it turned out wonderfully. I'll be making this again.

This turn out pretty good.  At first I didn't think I was going to like it.  The marinade  didn't taste right so I added some Orange rind and the juice from the orange.  made it taste better.  they turn out great.

Substituted pork tenderloin for shoulder and used rice vinegar instead of wine vinegar. Flavors were food but will try other recipes fir the sake if comparison.
