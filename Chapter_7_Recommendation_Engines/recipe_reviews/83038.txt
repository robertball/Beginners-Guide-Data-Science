This was some good stuff - nice recipe KeriLee! So nice to see a vegetable side dish with some real creativity and imagination. I preferred to use fresh spinach and garlic, some pepper and, because the artichokes I used were quite small, I left them whole.I did not cook this for 15 minutes though - just a minute or two to wilt the spinach is all it takes.  Great flavor and great eye appeal too.

It was very good.  I used more roasted red peppers and artichoke hearts than in the recipe, since I couldn't find jars the exact same size as specified in the recipe.  I put everything into a casserole dish, put feta cheese on top and baked it for a short while to heat the cheese.  It was very good this way.  I would suggest using a salty ham instead of prosciutto since you cook it anyway and prosciutto is more expensive.

Husband loved this.  I cooked the first time with sauteing the prosciutto to crisp it up and added fresh garlic while I did this.  Next time I want to use fresh spinach!  Thanks for the great idea!

This was a very nice side dish.  Very colorful and tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly.   I think with a little heat, cayenne, or pepper flakes it could make this a 5 star dish.  Thanks for posting the recipe

Incredible!  I made this for 10 of my family members and it was the first thing to go.  The taste is great! I may have added a few more artichokes (just because I love them), other than that, it was perfect!

As suggested by the author, I added cheese to the top - fresh grated Parmesan & as another suggested, I added feta (mine was reduced fat) in the dish. Since I happened to have a 14 oz can of artichoke hearts & no jar of marinated one, I drained those & used extra olive oil & some red wine vinegar to the skillet. Then I followed directions. After removing vegetables from the heat, I stirred in some crumbled feta & transferred all to a baking dish. Topped w/cheese & broiled on Low a few minutes.

This is such a great side dish and so easy to make!  It works well to take along to pot lucks or dinner at a friend's house as well and so far I haven't met anyone who doesn't like it.  My husband isn't usually fond of spinach and even he loves this dish!

It's not often that I find a dish that tastes as good as it looks or the other way around.  This one does.  I made just a few minor changes, though.  To cut down on the fat, I left out the olive oil.  I used bacon instead of prosciutto (my store didn't have it), and used a little of the bacon grease left from cooking the bacon to grease the pan before adding the veggies.  Delicious and filling enough for a light lunch.

I love this as a side dish.  Matter of fact, it could almost be a meal...it's so hearty.  My husband loves it.  It's easy to make and delicious so 5 stars are definitely deserved.  :)

This dish is very quick, easy & colorful. I used a fresh spinach/kale mixture & fresh garlic. My family loves it. Great way to get veggies that everyone loves.

As others said, this truely tastes as good as it looks. I made this along with the Stuffed Valentino Chicken on this site, and my wife, my 11 mo. old, and myself all loved it. Great blend of flavors and it looks great too. It would probably serve well as a filling for chicken breast as well if some cheese was added. Definitely part of our new rotation, and surprisingly inexpensive.

This turned out to be a heavier side than I was expecting.  The prosciutto plus oil, plus marinated artichoke hearts and  roasted red peppers made for a very heavy fat/oil taste.  Otherwise, the flavor was very good.  If I make this again I'll cut back on oil.  Another possibility would be to use frozen artichoke hearts (not marinated in oil) and roast your own red peppers.  It does make for a very colorful salad, it looked very nice.

We did'nt like this at all. It was way too salty, and we felt the artichokes did'nt go well in this dish. Sorry!

Awesome!   I am not much of a cook so when I was given the task of bringing a side dish I thought I was in trouble because I couldn't think of anything interesting....this was delicious and also looked good!

Wonderful recipe and so easy to make a beautiful side dish. Admittedly it's a little heavy due to the olive oil, so either cut some of it out or make sure you aren't pairing it with a lot of other heavy foods, I suppose. I paired it with some garlic crusted chicken for a fantastic meal.

Easy and tasted good.  I only had marinated artichoke hearts and had to sub 1 ounce real bacon bits for the proscuitto but it was still good.  I also added about a half cup of shredded mozzarella.

My family gives this dish 5 stars because the flavors are outstanding!  We used leftovers to fill omlettes for breakfast - YUM!  I really think the spinach could be doubled in this recipe and it would still be just as delicious.

This was really good.  I left out the artichoke hearts because my husband doesn't like them and used turkey bacon.  I will make this again.

We really liked this one. I didn't need much salt with the artichokes and procutto. Yummy.
