Excellent grilled cheese! My husband thinks bacon should be a food group so just about anything with bacon in it he loves and this was no exception. This was definitely a nice twist on regular 'ol grilled cheese and went great with a side of homemade tomato soup! Perfect for a night when you just don't feel like doing a lot of cooking.....

Pretty good. The only things I changed was add a tsp. of garlic powder in with the butter and added sliced tomatoes on the inside of the sandwich. Another change-up from your typical grilled cheese. And you know what I say? Bacon makes darn near everything better!

These were pretty good, but my family asked me to make my normal grilled cheese next time--my husband said the parmesan overpowered the taste of the cheddar. I followed the suggestion of lynniescorner and added some garlic, and I enjoyed that added flavor. Thank you for sharing your recipe, nevadamommy!

My DD wanted to give these sammies 10 stars! They were just terrific:). I didn't have any bacon so I stuffed mine with onions and chilies. I will remember to make these again Nevadamommy. Thank You very much!

This was a nice twist on the standard grilled cheese.  Grown ups and kids both really liked this one.

I had never thought of adding things to the butter on the outside.  I think this made the sandwich beyond the sandwich we had when we were kids.  I took it one step further and added one fresh chopped garlic clove to a double batch. We LOVE garlic.  I didn't have bacon so let them choose which luncheon meat the wanted, if any.  I will definitely make my sandwiches like this from now on!  Great recipe.

after having this, bacon on grilled cheese will be a must!  I used a foccacia bread and added some sliced jalapenos in the mix too.  Yum!

This was the bomb!  My family loved it.  The only change that I made was that I used American Cheese rather than Cheddar just because of personal preference, one slice for each piece of bread, with the bacon in the middle.  Yum!

I wouldn't call this "godlike".  It was fair, the parmesan crust was the best part.

Great flavor. I loved the toasted parmesan cheese taste on this. It was a little dry though and needs a dipping sauce like a marinara.

Tried it with white bread and the family didnt really like new taste of this recipe compared to the classic. Didnt have garlic powder, so I tried using minced garlic.

These were very good. Could have been great without bacon. It was just too rich. I added the garlic to butter mixture and that was gooooooooood.

This sandwich blew my husband's mind! He will not stop talking about it, I showed him how to make it and now it's all he eats. Good with any cheese inside.

LOVED this!  Omitted the bacon and used ham in it's place.  Also, added about 1/2 a clove of garlic to the butter parm-regg mixture.  Absolutely wonderful!  Thanks will make this again and again!

My family loved these!  I had to use ham in place of the bacon though, however, we like bacon so I will make sure I have it the next time I make these.  The cheese on the outside is awesome.  Thanks!

Killer! The parm on the outside took these to another level. I used a combo of extra sharp cheddar and American cheese for a great mix of bite and melt. I can't wait to make these again.

All I added was 3 thinly sliced tomatoes and garlic salt   I usually make chilled cheese sandwich with Jarlsberg cheese, thick cut peppered bacon, and tomato slices. I add the garlic salt to the softened butter.

Very tasty.  I didn't add the bacon, since I was serving with soup.  Used freshly grated parmesan and an extra sharp white cheddar.  My 11 month old even liked it.
