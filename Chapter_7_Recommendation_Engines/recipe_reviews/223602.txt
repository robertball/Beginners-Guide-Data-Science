Wonderful bread bursting with apples!  I cut the recipe in half and used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I also added a generous tsp. of vanilla. I baked it in a 9x5 glass baking dish at 350 for about an hour.  It smelled wonderful and tasted even better - perfect with a cup of tea!

Jillian's style of this recipe was much better then the real thing. When i did it first using the normal recipe i found there wasn't much flavor at all.  But when i used Jillians version i couldn't stop eating it. Still, good recipe.

I also changed it up a bit using Jillian's suggestions however I did not cut the recipe in half. Instead I used 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown and added a tsp. vanilla. I also put both loaves in for 1 hour at 350. I did not use walnuts. Turned out great!

I like it best this way--less fat and cholesterol and it's very good--just finished making it, and I keep wanting to go back for another piece!  BTW, you can substitute zucchini for the apples if you want  for a variation.
APPLE BREAD

3 c. all-purpose flour, 2 t. cinnamon, 1 t. baking soda, 1 t. salt, 1/2 t. baking powder, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 2 eggs, 2 c. sugar, 2 c. finely chopped or shredded peeled apple or unpeeled zucchini, 1/2 c. cooking oil, 1 c. chopped walnuts or pecans, toasted in pan in 350 degree oven for 5 min. (OPTIONAL, but very good, 2 1/2 T. milk (enough to moisten).  Mix eggs, oil, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, baking powder, & soda.  Add flour, apples, milk, nuts.  Mix till all is blended.  Pour into (non-stick if you have them) loaf pans that have been generously sprayed with cooking spray, so bread won't stick.  Sprinkle the top of each loaf with 1 t. sugar.  (Makes a fancy looking wonderful top crust; I do on all my quick bread recipes).  Pour into two 8"x4" loaf pans and bake for about 50 min or til tests done when a toothpick inserted comes out clean.  Over the top goodness, plenty sweet enough, and so much healthier for you with half the fat and 1/3 less cholesterol.  

Also, I used smaller pans (5 3/4" x 3" x 2 1/8"), cause it takes less baking time.  I baked them for 35 - 40 min. or until tested done with toothpick.  Makes 3 to 4 loaves, depending on how high of a loaf you want.  I usu. double this recipe and make 7, so can freeze & give away some.

FANTASTIC!!! With Jillian's modifications: 1/2 the recipe (2 eggs) + 1tsp vanilla extract and half cup white sugar and other half brown sugar. I used 2 cups of roughly chopped apples. I had to add another splash of vegetable oil too. DELICIOUS!!!!!

Okay, I took a bit of all the reviews and made this fabulous bread and as the photo shows, it came out perfect, light and fluffy and moist. Like most I cut the recipe in half and I use 1/2cup whole wheat flour and 1cup+2tbl Swans Down cake flour. Wheat flour is very low in protein resulting in those heavy breads. Cake flour has the highest protein so it compensates for the whole wheat.

I also did the combo of white/brown sugars.
Instead of the oil I used 6 tablespoons melted butter. Again, some protein and not as heavy as oil which makes for a better texture for the leftovers too.
I rough chopped the 2cups of apples then tossed in lemon water to keep them white.
That's why in spite of the wheat flour this bread isn't dark.
I tossed the apples with it's own flour in a colander to keep the chunks suspended in the bread not sink to the bottom.

I sprinkled the dough with a touch of white sugar before tossing in the oven and it gives a nice thin crisp glossy crust but isn't a streusel. Um, I used 3/4 cup rough chopped pecans & 1/4 tsp of vanilla.
Oh, Granny Smith apples.
So, this recipe was really a joint effort with everybody who wrote and as the picture shows it came out pretty, fluffy and light. I put the cup next to it to show the height of the cake.
The adding of the wheat flour really added a lovely sweet wheat taste and I never would have thought of it. Thanks everybody, this tastes great.

The best recipe EVER!  I made two loaves, however, I cut the sugar to 1/3 white and 1/3 brown, used 1 c of whole wheat flour and 2 c all purpose, cut the oil to 3/4 c., and added a crumble top.  It was absolute perfection.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

I made this tonight after purchasing 50 gala apples from someone who was selling fruit as a fundraiser.  As Jillian suggested, I did half white sugar and half brown and added a generous teaspoon of vanilla extract and nutmeg.  It turned out heavenly!  I used an apple corer/peeler tool and chopped the apples into smaller pieces from there.  I didn't puree the apples in a mini food processor like I do for zucchini bread; I left them chunky and it turned out amazing.  I made two loaves as the recipe is written, as a reviewer recommended I baked at 350 F for 1 hour and it was perfect. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe, I will definitely be making this again!

This was really good, I used a mini food processor to chop up the apples, I have a son with food consistency issues and he didn't even know they were there.  I'm making this again today to take to neighbors since we have a bunch of apples leftover from the orchard.

Made this 3 times for my family in the past month - basically our go-to for when our apples aren't being eaten. My dad was definitely impressed with it; it's a frequently requested one as it goes well with coffee. Didn't make any changes and the bread always turns out perfectly! Almost couldn't take a picture every time because it's snarfed down so quickly, but I managed to the last time I made it (last weekend).

My family raved about this bread (and I couldn't get enough of it!).  I used 1c brown sugar, 1c white sugar, 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c apple sauce.  I also used Eggbeaters instead of real eggs.  The bread was quite moist and very tasty.  I am definitely making this one again (and again)!

I, too, followed Jillian's advice to use half white sugar and half brown.  I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla, since she used 1 when she cut the recipe in half.  Since one or two reviewers said it needed cloves or nutmeg, apple pie spice seemed appropriate for this recipe. I used 2 tsp. of McCormick's brand, which contains cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice.  I followed one other reviewer's advice to coat the pan with butter & then dust with cinnamon sugar, which allowed the bread to slide smoothly out of my bundt pan, which another reviewer reminded me to use instead of 2 loaf pans.  There's one thing I'd do differently, as far as the order of ingredients.  The next time I make it, I will save putting in the chopped apples until I've mixed the wet ingredients with the flour mixture.  It was tougher to make sure there were no spots of dry flour in the batter with the flour clinging to the apples and in the spaces in between the chopped apples.  I think it would be easier to fold the chopped apples into the completely moistened batter.  Speaking of wet and dry ingredients -- that apple pie spice?  I mixed it in with the flour, salt & baking soda.  I was just worried it might not dissolve right into the egg and sugar mixture, but I will follow the recipe next time, since the oil that's also part of that mixture should allow the apple pie spice to dissolve just fine.  I would have loved adding the nuts, but my mother doesn't like them.  She is gonna LOVE this yummy bread.

This apple bread is delicious! I made it Jillian style, except that I didn't use the walnuts in the batter. Instead I made a walnut streusel (1/2 cup flour, 1/4 cup each of brown and white sugars, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/4 cup butter, and 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts). I layered half of the streusel in with the batter, and used the rest on top. I will definitely make this again!

To be honest, this is four stars as written, but easily goes up to five stars with a few changes. I used one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar as well as 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. I also bake this at 350 for about an hour in two loaf pans. Wow - sooo delicious!! The last time I made it I added some rum soaked raisins and my family went wild for it. It would be great with walnuts added as well.

It is okay, not really that impressed with it. I tried what reviewer Jillian said and did half brown sugar and half white sugar. Also added vanilla. To me it lacks something. I maybe next time if make add little nutmeg or cloves.

took this to a a potluck and it got rave reviews! since then I have modified this by increasing the apples by a cup (total of 4 cups) and decreased the sugar by half a cup (total of 1.5 cups) and it came out even better (in my opinion and my husbands as well)

I followed Jillian's version and it was great (as I'm sure the original was)!  I hate to waste the peel so I took the peels and blended them (in a smoothie bullet machine but it could be done in any blender) with the sugar/egg mix.  It tasted great and added the nutrients back in.  I also used organic so the peel should have been fine.

This bread is amazing! I took the advice of other reviewers and did 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar. Before baking, I didn't have cooking spray, so I lightly spread butter and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the pans. On top of the bread, I sprinkled walnuts and cinnamon sugar, then baked at 350 for almost an hour.

Turned out moist and delicious!!!

I never review recipes, but had to with this one, it was so good! I made some changes like some of the other reviewers did. Added 1 tsp vanilla. Used half brown and half white sugar, and substituted half of the oil for unsweetened apple sauce. Baked st 350F for just under an hour. I made it last night, and it is almost all gone!

I made some modifications to increase the flavor and healthiness turned out moist and with great flavor. Reduced the sugar to 1 cup and did 1/2 c brown and 1/2 c white sugar. Reduced the oil to 1/2c. Added 1 cup apple sauce as a replacement for the  1/2 c oil. Also added 1/4 c sour cream, 2 tbsp fresh squeezed orange juice and 1 tsp vanilla. Also increased the baking soda to 2 tsp to give a bit more fluffiness and added additional 1/4 c flour due to the other modifications I made. This version turned out moist with great natural flavor and just a good amount of sugar without the overload.

This was delicious.  I did half and half white/brown sugar and added some vanilla.  The crust was absolutely divine.  I made 4 smaller loaves and it took only about an hour to cook.   We will definitely be making this a lot.

This recipe has become a family favorite.  So delicious!!  Everyone loves it especially my kids.  So moist and easy to make.  I always make 1 loaf and with the remaining batter I make it into 12 muffins.  The muffins bake for 35 minutes and turn out perfect!

Very good. Of course, with that list of ingredients, why wouldn't it be?  This bread is certainly a treat as it is more of a cake.  I made four batches and divided each into five mini tins.  Twenty delicious loaves of bread for a nursing home ministry.  I made zero changes to the recipe.  I think the batter would be wonderful baked in a bundt pan and iced with a brown sugar glaze.

Oh my... this is so, so good.  Really, it's absolutely delicious with that cinnamon sweetness and loads of apples.  I bake a lot and my family is quite used to yummy treats but this apple bread really stood out among our favorites.   I too used half brown sugar, half white sugar and added about a teaspoon each of vanilla and  LorAnn's Buttery Sweet Dough emulsion (really yummy stuff!)  Thanks for a great recipe!

Update:   My husband, who is the quiet type, praised this apple bread endlessly!  It's definitely a winner in this house and I've made it about 7 times by now.  I did try baking the whole batch in one 10 x 5 loaf pan but as expected, it got overly brown around the outside while being not quite done in the middle.  Muffins have worked out quite nicely though :)

This is  one of the best apple bread recipes I have baked. I followed Jullian's added suggestions and I used 1.5 to 2 tsp of pure vanilla and I added 1/2tsp nutmeg  1cup white sugar and 1cup  brown sugar. I had pecans on hand so I used them.  I made mini loaves they were perfect. Adjust the cooking time because the pans are small.  Thank You Karla for sharing this wonderful recipe. I have passed this recipe on to other people. They also loved it. I hope you don't take offense to the added ingredients used in your recipe. The basic recipe is what is most important I give all the credit to you.

DELICIOUS! It's even better on the second day once the flavours have settled. I covered my pan with a tea towel and then a plastic bag to keep the moisture in and it made for a wonderfully moist loaf that lasted for a few days.

I also made the adjustments to the recipe of half white sugar-half brown sugar and adding vanilla extract. In the halved recipe, I used 1c whole wheat flour, 1/2c white flour, and I also added 3/4c oats for texture. The oats definitely made it a filling breakfast with a side of tea. Next time, I will replace the oil with apple sauce for a healthier mix.

This smells phenomenal. I did add vanilla as a couple people suggested. I did not check to verify ingredients on hand and had to substitute 1C  of wheat flour to make up the missing all purpose. At first taste I am excited to see how it is cooled down. The slow baking process can only benefit this bread, but, I did not prepare for the time needed adequately.

The only thing I changed was to add 1 tbsp of molasses to this recipe. Some of the photos made the bread seem very light in color. I also decorated it with thin apple slices before baking. The finished bread was a beautiful color with texture from the walnuts, which helped offset the sweetness of the bread. Lovely!

I made this and used Arrowhead Mills all purpose Gluten free flour. It was very crumbly and dry - any suggestions? Other than that it was absolutely delicious, one to keep in the recipe file!

Update: I made it again today (9/20) and added 1 cup applesauce and it gave it enough moisture to make up for the gluten free flour. It was amazing. I also added 2/3 cup dried cranberries. It's already almost gone!!

I took some of the suggestions from Jillian by substituting 1 of the white sugar to brown, vanilla extract, canola oil, and cinnamon applesauce. I ended up doubling the recipe and using 4 diced granny smith apples. This was more than 2 loaves of bread. I ended up using 3 big ramekins for the rest of the batter, which looked like muffins. It makes at least 3 decent size loaves. Had 1/2 of the muffin size one and it was delicious! I may try it with butter when I slice it up. It'll make a great addition to the Apple Cup game tomorrow. Go Huskies!

Absolutely my family's favorite bread I have ever made. Though I believe you can add less sugar. Easy and quick to make. For people who are wondering, three medium apples are about three cups. :) I will be making this again. Thank you!

I hit send before and didn't complete my review. Oh well, here it goes again. I loved this recipe. I made a couple minor changes. I replaced one cup of white sugar with brown sugar. I also added a tablespoon of vanilla extract. Also, instead of using bread pans I used one regular ~8x8 pan and it turned out great! I also added a pinch of extra cinnamon because I just love cinnamon with apples! I went without the nuts, but will try that next time! Delicious!

I have made this recipe several times and loved it every time!  Sometimes I use pears instead of apples.  I think using the white sugar is what gives it that lovely crust.  Everyone that I have shared it with says it tastes like something they would of bought at a hi end coffee shop.  Have tried a couple of different recipes since and nothing compared to this.

I usually make this recipe as written ingredient-wise, and it turns out fantastic!  IF you can keep your family from eating both loaves at once, freeze one to pull out later.  The only thing I change is that I don't peel the apples and also mix everything in one bowl, I just mix together the oil, etc, then throw the flour mixture in on top of that.  Easier when making for breakfast while having the first cup of coffee :)   My  family loves this recipe, and it makes the whole house smell terrific.  Great way to use up apples.

Delicious recipe, but it's only getting 4 stars because I made changes to it. The first thing I changed was the use of vegetable oil. I no longer use vegetable oil, so I used Butter instead. I also refuse to use cooking spray, so I greased my pan with Lard (all natural, and leaves no sticky gunk!). I also followed a previous example (from Jillian) and substituted half of the Sugar with Brown Sugar instead, also adding a Tsp. of Vanilla. These turned out wonderful!

Good apple bread recipe.  I modified it by adding a generous amount of vanilla, swapped brown sugar for white sugar, and butter for oil.  I cut back on both the sugar and butter, as following the recipe's proportions made the bread too sweet and too buttery for my taste.  I wanted it to be delicious, without being too unhealthy.  I cut back both by a third.  The bread was still tasty and moist.  I also used honey crisp apples which might also be why I needed to cut back on the sugar.

Was looking for a recipe that didn't need butter since I only had 3tb and found this.  Was running back and forth from the computer to the kitchen and ended up missing the cinnamon.  Didn't really read the reviews so also missed the vanilla additions, etc.  Not only was it good anyway, I used the last of the apples, sautéed them in the little butter that I did have and brown sugar, added cornstarch to thicken and poured it over the top, letting it sit.  I loved it!  My boyfriend didn't care for it that much, so I took it to work to avoid eating the other two thirds all by myself.  Put it in the break-room and it was GONE! Was really good!!

Delish!  Used Jillian's modifications- Halved the recipe (2 eggs, 2 apples), tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Soo yummy.  I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and think I will add more next time or maybe add some pumpkin pie spice to give it a little more kick. We will definitely be making this again!!

Tasted great!  I cut down the sugar a bit to 1 1/2 cups and cut the oil in half by using 1/2 cup of oil, and 1/2 cup of applesauce! Great snack for the kids!

It leaves much to be desired. Its very bland and dry. I think 90 min for a 9" loaf pan was way too long. I wish I would have checked it after 45 min or an hour. It was like a football, lol. Anyway, I'm going to try again, using some apple pie spice, vanilla and a shorter cooking time. Oh and a lot less sugar, was way too sweet for the type of apples I used.

This is a great way to use up apples that are "past due".  My tweaks, I subbed 2 cups of the white flour with whole wheat flour and shredded the apples. Added a couple dashes of ground nutmeg and a few drops of almond extract. Also used other reviewers suggestions of subbing half of the sugar with brown sugar and adding a tsp vanilla. Baked in one bunt cake pan for 60 minutes at 300 convect. Came out great!

It's okay and with all that white sugar, it still tasted bland. Waste of time to even try again.

This is a pretty versatile recipe .  I used half wheat flour and half all-purpose white flour. I also did half white sugar and half brown sugar ( and sprinkled some on brown sugar on the top to make a sugar glaze taste). Taking a bunch of advice from the reviewers, I also added vanilla,  milk and additional cinnamon.   I tried a loaf just like that and it was beautiful!  I then tried a loaf with a handful of muesli (Bob's Red Mill) and that makes a crunchy breakfast loaf.  Cooling right now is a loaf with some pumpkin mixed in...  I will try to add carrot in the next loafs with she apple.   We have bags and bags of apples and it is cool enough to run my bread maker all day if I have to.  My freezer has space and I have a load of great neighbors that may enjoy some baking. 

I used a food processor and kept the skins on the apple, by the way.

Delish!  I made a few changes:  I used a cup of melted butter (2 sticks) instead of oil, and whole wheat flour instead of white.  I also used a whole lot of apples (probably 4 or 5 cups): a mix of granny smith and mcintosh apples.  And a healthy splash of vanilla extract, a lot of cinnamon, a big pinch of nutmeg and a few shakes of ground ginger.  Enjoy!

I followed the original recipe and it is delicious. Froze one to put out for Thanksgiving. I didnt read the comments and modifications until my loaves were baking. But i think the original is great regardless.

I made this recipe just as it instructs and, I have to say, WOW!!! This is not only the best apple bread recipe I've ever had, but the best fruit bread I've ever had. I used to get tons of compliments on my banana bread, but this one beats it by far.  Thank you, Thank you for such an awesome recipe.  I've made it 3 times in the last month, so my family and friends thank you too! Please, whatever you do, don't try to alter the recipe. You'll be happy you didn't.

My 10 year old daughter loves to bake her own desserts. This was easy enough for her to make on her own and the outcome was awesome. Super moist and a great made from scratch dessert.

This is an amazing recipe... and I tried a bunch of others!  I think because you put the apples in the dry ingredients it makes it better.  I double it and put it into a 9x13 or 10x14 pan and sprinkle chopped candied pecans on top before I bake it, cut it into bars  and everybody loves it!

I've made this twice this week...  I followed some of the reviews.. Added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and substituted 1/2 oil for 1/2 applesauce and half white and brown sugar.. It was good but the next time I made mini loaves for gifts...I doubled the recipe  Added clove and  used more applesauce  (1/4 oil to 3/4 applesauce and then added an additional 1/3 cup applesauce)  now it's better than perfect!!  Very moist and yummy!!  It made 14 mini loaves!!

I really liked it. I cut the recipe in half and only made one loaf. I put a tablespoon or more of oil extra as the batter was a smidge dry. I would maybe add a bit more sugar next time. Overall it was fantastic!1

Delicious! I used gluten free all purpose flour and added a tsp of vanilla. Otherwise no changes. This is a lot more sugar than we should be eating though, so as much as we liked it, it's not something I would make very often.

Very moist sweet bread.  I changed per Jillian with half brown sugar and half white.  I also switched 3/4 of the oil for applesauce.  Added the vanilla and per another reviewer also added 1 tsp. nutmeg as well.  I also doubled up on the cinnamon, not possible to get too much of that!  I used Gala apples chopped, soaked in lemon juice and added at the end of mixing all other ingredients.  Baked at 350 for one hour and came out perfectly done.  I have made this recipe twice now, once with a half recipe and also with two loaves.  The next time I make it I am going to cut the total sugar to 1 1/2 cups (half white and half brown) instead of 2 total cups.  It is very, very sweet with 2 cups.

Made quite a few changes per suggestions from others then a few of my own.
 
Instead of 3 C flower I used 1 C whole wheat and 2 C all purpose.
 
Instead of 1 C oil I used 1/2 C oil and 1/2 applesauce. 

2 C white sugar became 1/2 C white and 1/2 C brown.

 I added a tsp of vanilla extract, 1/4 t nutmeg and a dash of cloves and 1/2 C cinnamon chips.

Baked at 350 instead of 300. Regular  loaf pan took maybe 45 mins. 

I made for a friend who loves apple bread, I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks.

Found this recipe to be wonderful but a bit on the heavy side.  I add unsweetened applesauce to lighten it.  My granddaughters cannot get enough of them.  9 dozen later and gone in less than 48 hours.

Made it  as posted (with gluten free flour) and it was amazing.  Used Mcintosh apples and made as muffins with an extra sprinkle of cinnamon on top.  I diced the apples a little too much, biting into the juicy Apple pieces was the best part so next time I will chop in bigger chunks.

To avoid the oil, I added my home made applebutter, 11/2 cups. I used the walnuts and turned out very moist with a good flavor.  This would be good for peaches and pineapple too.

Delicious! I also used Jillian's changes. It was the first time I ever made apple bread and I will definetly be making it again. After the first bite you want to eat the whole loaf.

I used this recipe, but substituted 1c of whole wheat flour for one of the 3 called for cups, and followed Jillian's recommendation using 1c brown sugar and 1c white sugar- also added 2tsp vanilla. Baked for 1hr at 350 degrees... Didnt use walnuts this time, but maybe next time, I imagine that will be delish! Sooo good, and a great way to use up any apples that are too bruised or sitting around for a little longer than you prefer your fresh apples!

I did not add nuts (personal preference) and halved the recipe to make only one loaf.  Also I took another reviewer's suggestion to use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar; also added a little extra chopped apples.  We were blown away with how good this apple bread was!

The bread tasted terrible. We could taste the oil over everything else. When it was baking it smelled so good but once we cut into it, it was just wrong.

This recipe was really dry and has an odd taste that I can't put my finger on.  The amount of sugar in this recipe is appalling so I cut the sugar in half which could have left the bread dry but at least I saved calories.

This is so good and a great alternative to muffins-the only thing I changed is the nuts.  I used a package of sliced pecans.  I also halved the recipe but won't next time!

The oil gives this bread an off flavor. I was leary of using an entire cup. I will make this again, but replace the oil with butter, yogurt or sour cream. I will not make the recipe again as written, it's barely edible.

This bread is to die for. It was wonderful with white whole-wheat flour, and I substituted half of the white sugar with brown. I also left the peels on the apples and received no complaints. Definitely a favorite with my children and also with my high school students.

If I cut this recipe in half, I would have riots... as is I am thinking I need two more loaf pans to cover all the requests from work and family. Great recipe. Vanilla goes great in this one... as does Raisins. Also, for more of a breakfast bread mix up 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar and a tablespoon of milk in a small bowl and drizzle over top.

I made this as described per the recipe, with only the suggested changes to the sugar and the addition of vanilla (which is why it's four stars instead of five). I didn't half the recipe, but did use one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar. Used 2 tsp generously of vanilla. Baked it at 350 degrees in two loaf pans for an hour, which was perhaps a tad too long (my fault!). But overall, a very delicious homemade apple bread.  Thank you for sharing!

I was truly looking forward to this bread, and it was disappointing. Everyone has their own taste. I thought it was dry and flavorless. I believe it needs more sugar and apples.

Came out tasty! I did half white sugar and half brown sugar, and added a teaspoon of vanilla, per folks' suggestions. I have had more delicious apple cakes/breads, but this is very good.

Followed the recipe and this was delicious.  We tried it when it was warm and it was okay, when it was cold and the next day it was absolutely delicious.  Will be shaving this recipe and making many more times.

This was a GREAT recipe. We had it as a desert and then breakfast the next morning. I tweaked a few things: I cut the recipe in half. Used 3/4 cup wheat flour, 3/4 cup all purpose flour, 2 egg whites with 1 yolk, I had 2 apples and it made about 2 1/3 cup, used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup white sugar, i also had a few pecans and just added that with the walnuts! baked on 350 in a bread pan for about 45 minutes.. Yum! Thanks for this recipe!

Subbed out oil for applesauce and used half white sugar half brown sugar. I didn't like the bread after I first made it, my husband loved it. I froze the second loaf and ate it yesterday, it was much better after it was frozen. I don't know why this is, but it seemed to have better flavor to me. The apple seemed to amalgamate with the bread after it thawed making it AMAZING with my morning coffee.

I also cut it in half, used half white and half brown sugar.  I omitted the cinnamon and it tastes wonderful.  Spray your pan generously as mine stuck.  But this recipe is wonderful. I too added vanilla. :)

I made a few small changes and it was delicious. I halved(ish) the recipe, meaning I put just over half of everything, to accommodate for the oddly-sized dish I used : a 1.5 quart Pyrex casserole. I used half white/half brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and about 3/4 cup more apples than called for. Cooked at 300 for approx. 90 min (maybe a little less, I checked it every 10 minutes after 1 hour). It is so moist yet cooked thoroughly, and it looked so pretty in the cute little pan I used. Will definitely make again!

I followed Jullians suggestions.  But instead of using white sugar I used stevia and 3/4 c brown sugar.  for the flour I used 1 cup of flour and 3 cups almond flour plus 1/4 cup milk.   I am diabetic  so this made it a bit more healthier.

I made this with Jillian's recommendations and it was astounding! I made two loaves and 18 muffins (doubled the recipe).

It hits the spot just right like banana bread but for us that don't like bananas.

Definitely more of a "cake" than a bread.  I used too many apples and it still came out fine too (probably closer to 4 cups or so).

Definitely use the dark brown sugar as half of whats called for, include vanilla, and generous cinnamon.  Also, used almonds, because I had them.  Very yummy.  Pretty in a bundt pan with a sprinkle of powder sugar.  Perfect with morning coffee.

It was extremely dry and flavorless.I even added about a 1/2 of milk to the mixture for additional moisture and it didn’t help.

I have made this 4 times in the last 2 months!! My family LOVES this recipe. The first time I made it I cooked it in a Bundt pan that was two halves of a pumpkin (it was Halloween) once cooked, I spread caramel sauce in between the two layers. This helped “glue” the two pieces of the pumpkin together. It tasted like a caramel apple cake. The next three times I made it exactly as the recipe states except I do use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Otherwise I make no changes. This is absolutely delicious!! Great for breakfast. I always cook in a Bundt pan.

Great recipe! I made a few adjustments to the recipe.... added a 1cp of raisins, added a teaspoon of Vanilla extract, replaced walnuts with pecans, and instead of 2cps of white sugar... I did 1cp of white sugar/ 1cp of brown sugar. The Apple Bread was so moist and yummy!

I made three loaves of apple bread using this recipe and was a bit nervous when it first came out since it looked a bit dry, but let me tell you....IT WAS AMAZING! I brought one loaf to work and it was gone within the hour I put it out. The inside was moist and so good, and I actually prefer this over an apple cake which can be too sweet.

Great recipe! I added some cinnamon sugar and melted butter and sprinkled that on the top before baking and it gives it a nice sugary crust.

Great bread will definitely be making again as well as recommending to others. I only had to bake for little over an hour. So make sure to check it well before the 90 mins.

Mini loaves. Next time I may try adding brown sugar and vanilla as I see in the comments. But this is a good autumn recipe

With some minor changes this recipe can be awesome, just use 1/2 cup brown, and 1/2 cup white sugar, 3 tablespoons of apple sauce, 2 tablespoons veg. Oil, I used allspice 1 tablespoon, and 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon, and chopped up 2 medium Fuji apples, and the bread turned out moist and baked for 52 minutes in my oven- perfecto!!

Everyone loved this bread! I followed Jillian’s advice and used half brown sugar and white sugar. I added more apples( I was trying to use up my frozen from last year) mine were just chopped rough. I also added chopped pecans.  I also cooked 350 for 55 minutes.

I absolutely adore this cake. I like to let it cool and then cover it overnight. It lets the apple flavor permeate, and wow, it's so rich and moist and delicious.

I made first time as is and it was very good.  Then  I made again but substituted half the white sugar with brown sugar and it was even better.  I used a bundt pan and cooked at 300 as recipe called for and for 90 mins and it was cooked perfectly.  Edges and bottom were not over brown like some thick batters tend to get.  Needs absolutely no topping.  So delicious even my 8 year old son could not get enough.  Thanks for sharing.  Will be making again for certain.

Simple and delicious to ring in the holidays.  I made this with Jillians suggestion of 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I made it in mini loaves.  1 recipe is enough for 5 little loaves.  Just enough to send around to the neighbors for Christmas cheer.

I made this today and followed the recipe as it is, except I used 1.5cups of white sugar instead of 2 cups and kept in oven for 60 minutes. It came out very good. I will be making it again soon. Easy and simple recipe for beginner like me.

Loved, loved, loved! Everyone that tried it said it tasted like a coffee cake from a cafe. I added a hefty splash of vanilla and would maybe substitute some of the white sugar for brown next time.

really good - i made it as muffins (24 muffins per batch) - baked for 40 minutes.  I added vanilla & used half brown sugar-- cut a little sugar out of the recipe because i thought it would be too sweet.  (perfect as i made it!)  if anything they could use a dash more baking soda as they were a little flat.  but boy do they taste great!

As with others, I used half brown and half white sugars, vanilla & pecans. I also sprinkled a teaspoon or so over the top of the batter. I was a little concerned because the final mixture was quite stiff and a bit unwieldy to get into the loaf pan, but it turned out just fine. Cooked it at 350 for the full hour. The result was a slightly crunchy top. Next time I make it I’ll double the cinnamon. Very tasty and nice to see chunks of apple when you cut into it. My husband loved it & took a second slice. Very good.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and it's great! I've finally perfected it for our tastes, as one does, but it's an excellent moist bread. It's been the winner this apple season, I'm definitely making more to freeze for the holidays. My own changes...  we like more apples about 5 med apples. Half white, half brown sugar. Sub melted butter for 1/2 the oil. Add 1 tsp vanilla, double the cinnamon, and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Baked at 350, 80min (my oven might be cool).

Excellent recipe. Very moist. To prevent bread from sticking to bottom of pans, after applying nonstick spray, line the bottom of pans with wax paper or parchment paper.

My family loved this apple bread.  I baked it in a Bundt pan.  The only change I made was using chopped pecans instead of chopped walnuts......just a personal preference.  Will be making it for years to come.

Decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups. Added a cup of raisins and it was delicious!! Chose this due to my daughter's current dairy/soy free diet (her breastfeeding baby is allergic) and it made a great birthday 'cake' for her. Making it again today so she can enjoy a sweet treat at my other daughter's birthday party. :)

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with an almost tasteless, but  sweet, loaf.  I checked it after 60 minutes and it was completely baked, so I can't imagine what would have happened if I left it in for 90 minutes as the recipe recommends. I threw away both loaves - a total waste of time and ingredients!

This is a wonderful base recipe. I loved the bread - my mom and daughter loved it even more than I did. However, it wasn't how I like it as written. First, like Jillian, I added vanilla (2.5 tsp) and did half brown sugar and half white sugar. I also added 1/3 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice, and a dash of cloves, as well as an additional 1 tsp cinnamon.  When I was mixing, the batter was much too dry - so I added an additional 1/2 - 3/4 cup applesauce; about half of that was homemade with LOTS of spices. Even with all those additional spices, I would add additional nutmeg, allspice, and cloves the next time I make this. I also used 5 cups of apples rather than the amount listed in the recipe - which was perfect for us. Finally, like other reviewers, I baked at 350 for an hour.  We ate it hot out of the oven and for breakfast the next day. It was better the second day.

This was a yummy bread but somehow was much too dense.  I added a generous amount of applesauce, to reach the consistency I was looking for.   It turned out delicious!

I did sub out all the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  even though the applesauce is unsweetened, there still is sweetness there so reduced sugar content to 1 cup white, 1/2 c. brown. It was perfectly sweet.  Used mac apples because they are one of my favorite apples for baking due to their great flavor.  I left the peel on for color. when i went to set my oven, i was surprised at the 300 degree temp.  I wasn't sure if it was a typo because most sweet breads are usually 350 for 50=60 min.  I set the oven for 350 and baked for 50 min and it was perfect inside and out.  I do like that the batter is thicker; makes the nuts not sink to the bottom.  this will not seem so moist fresh out of the oven; is best if it is made a day ahead for the flavors to meld, and it will become moist.  added some grated nutmeg and about 1/4 tsp cardamom out off personal preference; i love cardamom with apples.  ambivalent to rate it 5 stars simply because of the oven temp as stated in the recipe, as well as maybe as written with the spice measurements, may be a bit too bland for my taste but I did love the finished product.  beautiful top that was slightly crunchy yet the crumb was so moist and with adjustments, was a beautiful flavor.  thanks for sharing.

This bread is  absolutely amazing. I've made other recipes but this is by far the best. I noted some changes by others cooks on all recipes. I did not use oil i used a half cup of melted butter and then 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce. I also used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar. I also added some ginger, a pinch of cloves and extra cinnamon. This recipes makes 2 large loaves of bread and the house smells heavenly.

I made this bread exactly to instruction, except instead of making two loaves I baked in one 9x11 baking pan. This was amazing!! Next time I make it I may try to divide the sugar into both white and brown sugar, but honestly this bread is delish as  is! A great way to use up all those apples my children insisted on picking. =D

I wish I had read the reviews first. While the recipe is fine as stated, it seemed to just be missing something. Next time I will add more cinnamon and use brown sugar instead of white.

I made it as Jillian suggested, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, 2 eggs (I only made a half batch) and I baked it for 1 hour.  It was delicious!  Gonna go make it again (took the other one in to work so now I need one for here at home).

This was delicious!  I served it after the ten minutes in the pan because I like my breads hot.  I added a basic vanilla glaze to the top, and added cinnamon to that to give it that autumn flavor.

I have made it following Jillian's suggestion. It turned out good and tasty. I used muffin baking pan since I don't have the suggested pan resulting to a crispy, feel like cookies top and soft and moist button. I personally liked it.

I followed the recipe and found it to be wonderful. It was very moist on the inside but the top got a little crunchy which was delicious. The apples were soft and tasty. I would definitely make it again!

Always trying to make stuff a bit healthier (and easier).  I used chunky, unsweetened applesauce in this bread.  I also added pecans (which I love) and a bit of nutmeg.

My very picky son who hates nuts absolutely loves this bread. I use pecans that I chop  very fine in the food processor. I also had a little buttermilk to make it a little more moist. I also add 1 tsp of cardamom, which really blends well with the apples and cinnamon.  I also followed the advice of other reviews and mix half brown and half white sugars and some pure vanilla extract. Mm mm Delicious. Everyone at works loves it too.

Love this bread. However, I made a few modifications.  I pureed the apples and added one tablespoon of apple sauce to the puree.  Also, I substituted coconut palm sugar for cane sugar, and coconut oil for vegetable oil.   Very moist and delicious.

First I messed up by combining everything in one bowl. Then I modified it using some suggestions from Jillian on here.  I used 1 glass baking dish (13x9) used butter in place of spray, only 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and about 3 tablespoons of honey and about two tsps of vanilla.  Mine looks crunchy on top sort of like apple streusel probably because of the way I mixed the ingredients but I like it this way.  It reminds me of one of those fancy looking muffins from starbucks.  lll definitely be making this again.

I took the pulp from juicing apples in the vitamix and used that instead of apple chunks, made it into a 9 x 9 inch cake that was super moist.  Added nutmeg and a bit more cinnamon to the recipe big hit with the family.  Husband took a piece everyday to work to have with his lunch.  Will definitely be making this again.

LOVE this recipe!! I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and used 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar, added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and baked the two loaves at 350 for one hour. They came out perfectly! I only had two Macintosh apples and didn't want to waste time peeling them so I didn't. I kept (and devoured) one of the loaves and gave the other to my parents as a housewarming gift. It's a super simple recipe and I definitely recommend it!

An Aplus recipe!!!
Thank you very much for sharing, I did follow whole recipe and took the advice from others . I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. Also was very generous with the vanilla and added just a touch more of oil which made it very moist just like an incredible cake ....

I tried to follow the recipe, but I forgot the cinnamon. I had to sprinkle it on top. However, it still worked because it was good enough to win high honors. I rated it 4 stars because I personally thought it tasted slightly off.

This one is a keeper !  Didn't have enough apples so added a zucchini (grated zucchini and apples).  Subbed Applesauce for 1/2 the oil and baked at 350 degrees for 50 min.  Turned out really good, will make again.

This seems to be a great basic recipe that you can add  your own personal touches to.  I halved the recipe, added a teaspoon of vanilla and topped it lightly with a brown sugar crumb...came out great....it was even better the next day.

I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour. I only used 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Baked at 300 degrees for 1 hour. It wasn't as moist as I would of liked, but very appleby and plenty nutty.

I made a loaf this morning and it's almost all gone!! I cut the recipe in half and put my own touch on it. I used baking powder instead of baking soda, warm water soaked and drained raisins instead of walnuts, tsp vanilla, tsp nutmeg, and two eggs gave it the right amount of moisture. Even with backyard grown red apples the bread still came out sweet!

This was fantastic! I added raisins to the mix along with a dash of ground cloves  and boy, were the results wonderful. For a top 'crust' at the end I sprinkled some white sugar, cinnamon, and just a few pinches of oatmeal for decoration. The crust turned out delicious, nice and sweet though next time I make this I may go down half a cup. It is very sweet. 
Great treat! Lovely to share. Will be making again.

Not very much flavor and the apples don't really pop out very much. I'm going to try this again with some additional components (maybe some vanilla, nutmeg, brown sugar) and more apples.

.

EDIT: I made the recipe again with the following revisions:

-Half brown sugar, half white sugar
-Added just under 1tsp nutmeg
-Added just under 1tsp allspice
-Added about 1tsp vanilla extract
-Sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar
-Used slightly more apple than the recipe calls for
-Used slightly more oil/egg

The result was more moist and much, much more flavorful than the recipe as written.

Made  with the addition of 1 tsp vanilla and half white sugar and half brown sugar.   I sprayed the pans with Pam but it totally stuck to the pan even after cooling 10 min.   Seems to taste fairly good.  Won't be making this again.

Not only did my family LOVE this recipe but I made a loaf for my friend and her family and they too could not get enough.  The subtle sweetness of the apples in a moist delicious bread.  This will definitely be a staple dessert in our house.  Thank you Karla for sharing.

This bread was so amazing and had such great flavor. The only thing I changed was the bake time. It only took me 65-70 min to cook both total. I was advise checking the bread starting at 60 min.

Yummy! My loaves didn't come out half done in the middle, but were just a tad crispy on edges & top.... Perfect. I only had 2 apples on hand so i used rhubarb to make up for what i didn't have. Very good :)

Delicious recipe that made the house smell like Thanksgiving! I subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil, and the bread came out deliciously moist and flavorful! Also, I used four mini loaf pans for part of the recipe and baked for 45-50 minutes.  In my regular loaf pan, it took about 60-65 minutes to bake, rather than 90.

Love, love, love this recipe.  I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 12 white and the 1 tsp vanilla and made it into mini loafs.  It is so good.  A nice alternative when its apple season.

Exceptional.

We omit the walnuts and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. 

It is so worth the effort of baking.

GREAT TASTING APPLE BREAD.  Made it yesterday & halved the recipe, since I thought one loaf would be good enough.  I am sorry I did it, since it is soooo good I have to bake another one.  Used the advise of another reviewer and used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar & added vanilla to the mixture of oil, egg & sugars!
Baked it at 350 for 1 hour.  Absolutely FANTASTIC!

Karla, thank you so much for posting & sharing your recipe.

Great recipe! I followed some of the modifications suggested and made some of my own and it came out wonderful and moist.  I used 2 cups AP flour and 1 cup white whole wheat flour.  I also used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. I added the 1 tsp vanilla extract, as well as a splash of almond extract, and 1/2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg. I upped the apples to about 3.5 cups, roughly chopped (I used Empires, which came out excellent).  Instead of walnuts I used 1 cup finely chopped pecans (personal preference). Lastly, I replaced the vegetable oil with 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/3 cup coconut oil, to make it a bit healthier. You could probably do 3/4 cup apple sauce and just omit the oil altogether, but I think next time I will reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup, as the apple sauce adds sweetness. I may also consider adding a little orange zest on the next batch.  Delicious!

This recipe is lacking some of the flavorings used in classic apple bread.  My mom's recipe, which is definitely not bland, goes back to the 60's and it's exactly the same as above in ingredients and measurements, but it *also* calls for two (2) tsp. vanilla extract and 1 tsp. ground allspice (in addition to the 1 tsp. cinnamon).  Like Jillian's version, it also bakes at 350 for 1 hour.  You may cut the oil back to 3/4 cup and it still is plenty moist.  I don't cut the recipe in half because this cake freezes well and two loaves means one can be frozen and saved for another day.  Why bake twice?

Good starter recipe and great warmed up! Added vanilla and should have added some nutmeg and extra cinnamon for more flavor. I would also add a sugar/crumble topping next time. Overall good recipe but will make modifications above next time I make it.

AMAZING bread! I used the recommended 1 cup white sugar and 1.5 cups brown sugar. I cut up 4 cups of Gala apples but kept them "chunky". We like chunks of apple in our bread. I added them at the very end and beat them into the batter in a mixer for about 45 seconds. I sprinkled the breads with brown sugar before baking them.

I made a few changes that I read in reviews: 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar. I used 1/2 cup oil & 1/2 cup applesauce and I added some nutmeg. This is the best thing I've ver made. The 1st 2 were so good I made 2 more right away.

What a great apple bread recipe. I used half white and brown sugar ( not quite a full cup)Next time I will add vanilla extract. I used my chopper from pampered chef for the apples. It was very good!

Huge hit with my coworkers. They even offered to pay me to make it again! I did make changes though. I thought 2 cups of sugar was excessive (which is why it only got 4 stars)  and used closer to 1 1/4 cups. I also used only 1/2 cup oil and substituted 1/2 cup applesauce. I omitted the walnuts and didn't really measure the apples, it may have been closer to 4 cups.

I used almost 4 cups chopped apples, about 3/4 the oil, and only 1 cup sugar. Added a splash of milk to add moisture while mixing (probably because of the less oil I used). Also used 3/4 c chopped walnuts, and added a sprinkling of nutmeg & cloves. Delicious!

Love it! Might add an extra egg, and also gotta grease those loaf pans really well or the bottom sticks. I personally enjoy nutmeg and vanilla extract added as well.

Amazing bread! I gave it to the Chef at my job who said "this is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Seriously, bread wise it's  #1". 
I did make some minor adjustments as well. Used 1/2 brown sugar and a generous teaspoon of vanilla. About 10 mins before I took it out i spread a butter/cinnamon sugar mixture over the top (generous) and let bake the rest of the way. 
Already made 3 loaves and by demand of my husband "never stop making this".

This recipe calls for way too much sugar. Made it twice.. The first time I made as written... I found that besides the overpowering sweetness it wasn't very flavorful at all. I'm not impressed. The second time around I followed Jillian's suggestions, however, I scaled down the sugar to about a cup and a half.. Next time I'll only use one cup of sugar total.

Great flavor, I took this to a ladies function and everyone asked for the recipe.  I would cook it a little longer and grease and flour the pan the bottom stuck to the pan.

Only changes were half brown sugar, coconut oil instead of vegetable, and pecans instead of walnuts. Topped with recipe from this site "Apple dip" but used as frosting. 1 block cream cheese, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and a tsp vanilla.  BEST Apple bread ever!!!!

Made this twice in last week since I can't seem to hide any for myself! Moist, lusciously delicious! Did tweak a tiny bit by adding 1/8 tsp cloves, fresh nutmeg, and ginger plus 1 tsp vanilla to boost the flavor. I had to cover loosely with foil after 40 min as it Browns quickly at 350. Even lowering to 325 it takes on color fast. Total time 1 hour. This is my new basic go-to for amazing Apple loaf!

I am not a huge apple bread person but this was GREAT!!  Using other reviewer's advise - I used 1 cup dark brown sugar and 1 cup regular sugar and added one healthy tsp of vanilla.  My older son - the junk food machine - loved it so much he wanted to take a piece to school today with his lunch. Almost fell over!

I LOVED this recipe! I didn't have 2 loaf pans so I just used brownie pans instead, and didn't put in the walnuts (because didn't have any) but wow! Massive hit! Especially when they're still warm!  Definitely try this!!!!

This was a great starting point; I did, however, modify it a bit. For one, I had carrots to use, so I omitted one apple and substituted shredded carrot. I also used about 1/3 cup of applesauce in place of one of the eggs and used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar. The bread turned out wonderfully moist and just sweet enough. Good stuff, good stuff.

DELISH!!!  I altered to make it a little healthier. I used 1.5 cups white flour and 1.5 wheat flour. I used 1 cup granulated and 1 cup brown sugar, which did make some hard lumps in the whisking process but was able to get rid of. Used a mix of granny smith and gala apples. Added 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and used 1 whole egg, and four egg whites. I also only have one loaf pan, so I used the remainder batter in a muffin tin and made six large muffins and one loaf! The muffins are done much sooner than the bread, and both are perfect! Awesome with coffee and great for freezing leftovers as well, if you can bare to ration some :)

Whoa - this recipe as stated was cloying and one-dimensional. Cut the sugar in half, sub some whole wheat pastry flour, and perhaps it would be a little better... but as is, really quite awful.

Easy to make; not too dry or too moist. I used 1 1/2 cups sugar total 91/2 white, 1/2 brown) instead of 2 cups, and the final product is, to my taste, still too sweet: if you're unaccustomed to sugar, cut it back even further, as I will do next time I make this.

I added 1 banana chopped into small pieces, only used 2 cups of brown sugar,  1 tsp of pumpkin spice, 1 tsp of vanilla , and 3/4 of oil and 1/4 soy milk. It was so good my family is asking for more. Trying it today for family member who is diabetic: with 1 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp pure powdered stevia. 1/2 oil and 1/2 cup soy milk, and added cranraisens to help with flavor, although it probably doesn't need it..

Tried this recipe Gluten Free today, also using a few suggestions. I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose GF baking flour. I did cut the recipe in half, used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugars. I used about 2 cups diced apples with cinnamon and nutmeg on them (I had these already frozen) as well I used about a teaspoon of nutmeg and a tablespoon of cinnamon in the batter. I also used a half cup brown sugar mixed with a tablespoon cinnamon combined and sprinkled on top of loaf before baking. This came out wonderful. Next time I will use applesauce for half the oil, definitely will add vanilla as suggested and will bake for less time than suggested. Very good and this recipe is a keeper. Thanks to Karla for posting this recipe.

I tried this tonight. It turned out great. Made two changes , used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar and baked at 350 for 65 mins. I was scared seeing the gooey batter since I am a novice at baking. However was so proud at the end when two intact loaves dropped out of my baking pans. I cut one and tasted it, amazing. Can't wait to have my hubby and kids try it in the morning.

Not bad, but a little bland on taste for me. I will prepare it again and use more cinnamon, add some brown sugar and a little nutmeg to bring out the apple flavor.

I kept same quantity, 1/3 brown sugar - in lieu of all white (it was all I had) added vanilla, more apples and plenty of cinnamon. Wished I'd had nuts. It didn't turn out like the pictures and the consistency was more like a cobbler type bread - crispy on the outside and moist and thick on the inside.  The batter was very thick and that concerned me at the time. I even double checked the recipe to make sure I hadn't over one the sugar.   I baked on 350 but turned down to 300 when I checked and the outside was hard and crispy.  I only used one oblong glass dish because the batter was so thick it all fit nicely in the dish. I suspect this is why it was crispy on the outside and maybe not fully cooked on the inside?   My daughter loved it and it was really good - just not what I expected.  I hope it freezes well - I made this mainly to have with my coffee in the morning.  Any ideas?

I made this bread last night and it was delicious! I don't normally change the ingredients on a new recipe but I took someone's advice and did 1/2 brown sugar and it was wonderful! I will definitely keep this recipe!

I cut the sugar in half and used one cup of sugar and one cup of molasses. I only had to use half a cup of oil and the bread was very moist. I love the way the molasses makes it taste.

I just made this and it is really good. I normally don't like very sweet things so I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cup. I would like to make this for someone who has to watch her sugar intake. I will try using a sugar substitute instead.

I cut the recipe in half (using 2 eggs) and 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  It turned out GREAT!  I baked it in mini loaves for 45 minutes.  I'll be making this again!

I used 2c white flour, 1/2c whole wheat flour, 1/2c oats
Instead of 2 c white sugar, I used 1c maple syrup + 1/4 c white sugar + 1/4 c brown sugar
And instead of 1c oil, I used 2 overripe bananas + 1/4 c apple cider + 1/3 c oil

I made one loaf (75 min) and one dozen muffins (35 min)

It came out completely moist and delicious! A nice lightness to it, appley, great texture. Even though I cut the sugar down by 1/2 c, it was very sweet. I have a sweet tooth, so I liked it, but I think you could cut it down even more. Of course, the maple syrup is very sweet, and the bananas also contributed extra sugars. I will definitely be making this again!!

Easy and delicious. Moist texture, sweet but not too sweet. I reduced the salt to 1/4 teaspoon & it was still yummy.  Will make this again.

I made some big changes, but this is a wonderful starting point. I used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups old fashioned oats instead of 3 cups of ap flour. Also replaced the 2 cups sugar w just 1 cup pure maple syrup. Replaced most of the oil w unsweetened apple sauce (added about 2T oil and topped the remainder of the cup w apple sauce). I also used raw hemp seeds instead of walnuts. Oh, and added some vanilla. Yes, I know, lots of changes. I baked both loaves at 350 for an hour and they were absolutely amazing. Will make this again and again.

Great recipe.  I made it with 2/3 cup of white and 2/3 cup brown sugar. I used 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup olive oil. Probably could use all coconut oil to make a healthy alternative.

This is a wonderful recipe! Bread is moist and very tasty. Plus it's simple and doesn't take to much time to prep and it's easy for the little ones to help with. I made it the way the recipe intends for it to be made but I made one with walnuts and one without. Both equally yummy! This is my new favorite.

Once I make this bread I can't stay out of it. I will never look for another apple bread recipe ever again. It usually takes 3 small to medium apples to yield 1 cup. NOTE: I increased the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. I know it doesn't seem like much of a difference but I can tell and I like it better.

I had to make do with what was on hand, so I cut the recipe in half.  I also added a tsp of ginger powder, a tbsp of cocoa powder, and a banana that I mashed up in the blender.  I also tried to puree the apple but it was still a little chunky.  It added quite a nice texture, though.  It fit well into a round 9-inch pan.  I like adding vanilla ice cream with it, too.

I read other reviews and so I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and this was delicious.  This is going into my recipe box and will be used anytime I have leftover apples.

I'm eating it right now!!! Pretty amazing! I also halved the recipe, did 1/2 white, 1/2 brown, and added a teaspoon of vanilla. To make it a little more healthy (since I have NO self control), I subbed applesauce for the oil, and egg whites for the eggs. It's very moist, and super delicious. Also, I skipped the nuts. Would rate it 5 stars, but I think it needs a streusel topping. Will definitely make again!!!

I made this today with some apples we picked last weekend and it came out great. I did use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and added about a tsp of vanilla. My husband and son loved it. Easy and delicious!

This is the tastiest and easiest apple bread. I made it along with my kids other favorite peanut butter banana bread, and they picked this one over the other. I also shared the recipe with my sister and her kids loved it too. It is moist, sweat and delicious.
