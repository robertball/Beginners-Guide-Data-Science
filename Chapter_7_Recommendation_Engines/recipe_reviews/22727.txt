Forget the rest...this IS the best. If you buy that yellow sludge from the grocery store labeled "Eggnog", you should be ashamed!!! This eggnog is truly a cut above them all, it is thick, rich, creamy and absolutely luscious. I served this to my guests last Christmas and everyone BEGGED for more. I had to come back this year to find the recipe again. Not necessarily the easiest to make, but WELL worth every effort. A new tradition has been added to my household. Thank you, Henry VG...who EVER you are!!!

Mix the egg yolk mixture into the egg white mixture, not the other way around.  Do it slowly and don't be too careful about the folding.  it'll work and the beaten eggwhites won't float.  We all enjoyed it a great deal, though it makes way more than 20 servings!

Awesome! The king of all eggnog recipes. Delicious, and really brightens the spirtit ;). Highly recommended for any holiday party, but keep the children far...far away from the bowl. 
This is a very sweet recipe. You might have to cut the sugar a little bit.

This recipe was far from what I expected.  It didn't even taste like eggnog!  More like cream with way too much rum.  The rum definitly overpowered the recipe, and I would suggest that you use a lot less then called for.  I must have done something wrong, because the whipped cream and egg whites settled at the top and it would not mix in for the life of me.  I guess I'm sticking to the store bought, a lot easier and a lot less time consuming.

This recipe is pretty good... a little thick for my liking, but what do I know, I'm the type who always bought mine at the store.  Fairly easy to make, just use good rum...

This is a very good recipe most excellent.... There are a few minor changes that I used (as a personal preference) I cut the milk in half and added that much more cream I whipped all the cream to a hard peak just prior to serving and folded them into the whipped egg whites (also stiff peaked) the flavor is fantastic the changes I made only made it thicker (our family likes to eat their egg nog) 
This is a most excellent recipe!!  :O)

This was great. Living in the Nederlands it's not possible to get any eggnog here so this recipe was a god sent, even my mother liked it. Thanks for this great recipe. P.S. do scale this recipe down as this does make more than 20 servings.

This is a very rich and very delicious treat!  I swapped the white rum for Captain Morgan and add a touch of vanilla, the two compliment one another and add a different kind of sweet to the mix.

Pair it with some gingerbread cookies and you'll be in holiday heaven!

By the way, the rum has enough alcohol in it, that it will kill anything potentially harmful in the raw eggs.

Excellent. Many members of my family had only tasted store bought eggnog and loved this. I used a diluted rum since many people did not want a high alcohol drink

I have tried quite a few of the recipes for eggnog on here and this one is the best!  Now, we can have eggnog anytime of the year. I just used two quarts of whole milk and it came out great.  I don't like really thick eggnog. The egg whites thickened it out nicely also but not too much.  And I omitted the rum. :p

The Eggnog of Eggnog's!  This recipe is fantastic if you want "REAL" Eggnog.  Thick, rich and creamy, you'll be going back for more. I have made this recipe several years now and our guest have loved it so much they ask for the recipe.

Over the years I have tweaked the recipe and have these suggestions.
250ml of Jagermeister to the mix to make ULTRA Extreme Eggnog.   Spiced Rum works well in place of the White Rum.

Definitely a big hit! The perfect amount of kick, plus so creamy and delish! I did change it up a bit by really working the cream and half and half with an emulsion blender. I wanted it thick and rich, so having the heavy cream more dense was absolutely perfect! I also chilled it for about an hour after it was done so that no one was tempted to add ice to it. Great recipe, will be making it again!!

This is definitely 'The Best'.
As for Poopsie79:  Yours didn't turn out as expected because you used 'netmeg' instead of 'nutmeg'.  Everyone knows netmeg is too bitter.  :-)

You can stop your eggnog recipe search here. This recipe is absolutely delicious. It's not for the faint of heart...it's rich & thick & so very good. I made it virgin without the alcohol, so that the entire family could enjoy it. I followed the recipe only adding a splash of vanilla and a bit more nutmeg...to suit my family's taste. If you love eggnog like we love eggnog then this is the recipe for you!

I used Captain Morgan Spiced Rum because I had it in stock.  This is by far and away the best eggnog I have ever had.  It is so rich you can serve it as a desert.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.

I’m not sure what  POOPSIE79 made but this was almost too thick. I cut the rum to 2 cups as a whole bottle would have been too much alcohol for our taste. It tasted great the way it was but something seemed to be missing so I added some cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. It was fantastic. I will make it again.

This just didn't work for me. I followed the recipe as written and came up with a foamy drink that was overpowered with rum. I served this at a party last night and it went untouched.

I have made this the last 2 Years at Christmas.  I am making it again this year. I do not use as much rum as they call for.  It is like drinking dessert.  It is great.
