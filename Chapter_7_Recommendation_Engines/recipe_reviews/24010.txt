This is a wonderful recipe! It's almost exactly like the Chicken Marsala at my favorite restaurant. I make this when I want a delicious, elegant meal and serve it with wild rice and a nice bottle of wine. I always triple the sauce, which is easily done using an 8 oz carton of cream and 1 cup of marsala wine, leaving out the milk. Also, I use double the mushrooms and I use sweet onions instead of green. I simmer it longer till the sauce reduces and thickens to my liking. The cream is the key in this recipe, I can't imagine a chicken marsala recipe without cream in the sauce. I love to make this for guests, it gets raves and I look like a gourmet cook!

Good basic recipe, however it's better to pound the chicken first-I put it in a plastic ziplock bag and pound it until thin- dredge in flour(I add garlic powder to the flour)cook in olive oil and butter until golden brown, add the marsala followed by the cream(I use half n half). I never use the onions it changes the flavor too much.  I do use roasted garlic sea salt and lemon pepper for seasoning.  This recipe calls for equal parts of marsala and cream but in my opinion it needs more marsala and much less cream for a caramel color and richer flavor.  With the bits from the cooked chicken and flour the sauce cooks down and thickens.  Add capers and voila! I double the sauce and serve over angel hair pasta.  Keep in mind it needs to be served right away. Buen Apetito!   =^..^=

Our catering business needed an easy, quick Chicken recipe. This one was a hit and the automatic conversion to serve 100 was great. We grilled the chicken the day before the event. Next day we made the sauce (the smell was incredible), poured it over the chicken and baked for about one hour at 350 until warmed through. This recipe looked impressive and served beautifully from chaffing dishes. We'll definitely do this again!

I love this recipe. I doubled wine and eliminated the cream and milk and replaced with evaporated milk (also doubled). I used 8 oz. of mushrooms and served the sauce over linguine. The flavor is fantastic. This is a great meal to serve guests!

Is it impossible to make an easy gourmet dinner in a flash during the weekday?  Not with this recipe!!!  Wow!  That is all I have to say.  Again, I am a purist and usually do the recipes as they are written the first time around.  The recipe was definitely very good as is and deserves all the stars.  If and only if you decide to “augment” it, here are my suggestions:
1- Lightly dredge the chicken in flour before sautéing it.  It gives it a little crust which I like.
2- Remove the chicken from the skillet and reserve in a plate before step #2, and only put back the chicken after adding the cream in step #3.  This will ensure that the chicken is still tender.
3- Triple the sauce (i.e. 1 cup of Marsala and 1 cup of cream)!!!  It is the best attribute of the recipe!  Since there will already be a lot of cream, you don’t need the milk.  I just omit it now.
4- Make sure you take the time to cook down the Marsala wine, which is why it should be boiled for 2 to 4 minutes as per step #3.  Marsala is a nice fortified wine but can be a little overpowering for kids and people that don’t especially appreciate alcohol.
That being said, I’ve served this over pasta, rice, and mashed vegetables and I’ve only had rave reviews.
Thanks Sal!

Love it, love it! I too double or triple the sauce so that we can have extra for pasta.  The only change I made, was to use evaporated milk instead of cream.  Every little bit of calorie and fat cutting counts.  In this case as in many when you use the evaporated milk in place of creams and regular milk products, you get all of the creaminess and not so much of the fat. It is also a real $$ saver. If you have champagne taste but only have beer budget, you will like this substitute. I promise!

Very tasty - the cream makes the difference!  Modifications I made...(1) pounded the chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness as is traditionally done with chicken marsala; and (2)after cooking the chicken over MEDIUM heat, I put it aside on a plate while cooking the mushrooms to avoid over cooking.  Then added the chicken back in before adding the marsala wine.

The same night I made this Chicken Marsala for family, I also made a different one from this site for me. In a side by side taste test, this one was definitely richer because of the cream. The one I made for myself had no cream. The flavor on both was way out of this world. Because of the cream sauce, the presentation was prettier on this one. I will use this recipe for guests and the other Marsala for my family dinners. Both recipes are perfectly flavored.Thanks for sharing Sara.

Yummy and easy! My husband loved this recipe! I doubled the sauce and added some flour to thicken it at the end. Nice flavor without being too overpowering! I will make this again.

Loved it! Chicken Marsala is one of my favorite dishes and I have been searching for a good recipe.  My husband loved too.  This was easy and tasted great.  I tripled the sauce and it was perfect.

I thought this recipe was easy and delicious.  I added a little bit more Marsala wine and I was careful not to overcook the chicken.  It turned out to be tasty and quick.

This was really good.  But I do recommend:  Cooking the chicken in butter or olive oil/or both.  I would then go ahead and cook the mushrooms.  I would triple the sauce recipe also.  I loved it but I wanted more sauce!

I used this recipe as a base and changed a few things around to make it healthier.  Instead of using heavy cream and milk I used low fat half and half. I also sprinkled a a little bit of Gorgonzola cheese on top, delicious!

I browned 2 shallots, a package of sliced mushroom and 1 lbs of organic skinless, boneless chicken thighs, sliced (they dont dry out like breasts) Added 500mls heavy cream, 1/4 cup Marsala wine, 1 cube frozen parsley and 2 tsp dried thyme, salt & pepper and simmer for 20-25 mins until thickened, served over rice- without a doubt- the best I've ever made!

I had always wanted to try Chicken Marsala and finally used this recipe and my family loved in and came back for my meager left overs. The recipe is simple and easy to follow and it will become the go to dinner when I need something tasty and quick. I placed the partially cooked chicken over cooked rice and poured the sauce and sauteed mushrooms over it all and baked for another 20 minutes. The chicken was tender and divine but I could have eaten just the rice and sauce and been happy. Excellent

This recipe was wonderful, however I omitted the green onions, which I thought would take away sweetness from the sauce and I breaded my chicken breasts {panko breadcrumbs} which held the thick sauce even better! My family loved it!

FYI: It's better to use the real Marsala wine instead of the Marsala cooking wine that they sell. It has a much intense flavor.

Mmmmm... we loved this recipe! I would say 4 1/2 stars! I made a few minor adjustments after reading the reviews. I tripled the sauce and couldn't imagine using less. I used all heavy cream instead of the milk. I also added slightly more wine while cooking. Before I sauteed the chicken, I soaked it in a marinade of green onions, marsala wine and some garlic salt and italian seasonings. I think it added to the tastiness of the chicken. I served this over penne pasta! Really good!

This was really good and really easy! My husband (who didn't want me to make it because he thought he didn't like chicken marsala) loved it! I followed some other reviewer's tips and made a couple minor adjustments. I pounded the chicken breasts flat in a plastic bag, then shook in another plastic bag to coat with flour and garlic powder. I sauteed chicken in olive oil. I made about three times the amount of sauce (so we'd have enough to put over rice also). I used sweet onions instead of green onions, omitted milk, and used about twice as much marsala as cream. Will try with fat free half/half next time to reduce fat.

The Marsala was delicious and I will definitely make it again! I did use some of CatCanCook's suggestions regarding pounding and dredging the chicken (with flour and garlic powder).  Like CatCanCook I cooked the meat in the skillet with olive oil and butter. I also agree with her comments regarding more Marsla and less cream/milk a must! I was working with the ingredients I had on hand and was able to substitute fat-free evaporated milk instead of cream/milk (very good). The sauce is so yummy it needs to be doubled or tripled just to have extra to go over the pasta!!! Yummy!

I love chicken marsala. This was the first time making it and found it easy. I loved this recipe but will probably make sause thicker next time. A friend of my daughter was over and said it was "the best chicken". Recipe is a keeper.

Absolutely excellent!  I wanted to lick the pan & my plate afterwards.  I used regular yellow onion, finely diced, since I didn't have green onions.  Also, I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder.  I doubled the sauce and served it over baked potatoes.

Yuck. All I tasted was the cream. This smelled horrible. All I could find in the store was Reese marsela. Maybe it was the marsela that I used. Considering all the great reviews I am surprised that I had such a bad experience with this.

I love the flavor!  Next time, in addition to making more sauce, I will try thickening it with cream of chicken soup so it can cover pasta better.

This recipe was really good, however I didn't make it exactly as described, I didn't have green onions or heavy cream and I pre-cooked my chicken in minced garlic and olive oil and instead of the heavy cream I used a small can of cream of celery soup and whole milk.  My daughter loved it, she had two plates and licked it clean!

Perhaps because I doubled the sauce, but the sauce was very runny.  I think if I make it again I would add some flour to thicken the sauce a bit.  The flavor was good, but not outstanding.  Not sure I will make again.

Fantastic!  I used some sour cream instead of milk because I was out of milk, and I had to use canned mushrooms, but it was still out of this world.  My boyfriend (who is country and likes plain food) raved about it.

It had great flavor, but I prefer a thicker sauce. Next time, I will add cornstarch to thicken the marsala/cream sauce.

5 stars for simplicity and yumminess!!  The two things I look for in a recipe these days!!  Like one of the other viewers I tripled all liquids, so 1 cup marsala, 1 cup hvy cream and just about 1/2 cup milk.  I used a yellow onion instead of green onion cuz that's what I had in the fridge.  I used frozen chicken breasts that had soaked for about an hour(from frozen stage) in a ziplog bag of water w/about a tbl spoon of salt (helps the chicken absorb moisture). Rinsed the chicken and followed the recipe from there.  Perfect creamy sweet chicken marsala!! YUM!!

This recipe was good, although a little more like chicken alfredo than chicken marsala.  But, my family liked it!  I like to fillet my chicken and tenderize it, so the cooking time needs to be much less, otherwise the chicken is quite dry.  I will definitely do this recipe again!

This dish is delicious!  The only change I made was that I pounded the chicken breasts flat.  Whatever you do, don't replace the scallions or leave them out.  They really made the dish smell great!  I served this with brown rice.  There were no leftovers!  A rare event since I have a picky husband and picky son.  I'm already looking forward to making this again this week.  I loved it!

Good basic recipe - I tripled the sauce so there was enough for pasta.  
I thought the one to one ratio of wine to cream is too much -- next time will use less wine (2/3 cups wine to 1 cup cream/milk combo).

This recipe was outstanding.  It was quick and easy.   I dredged my chicken in flour first and knew that the flour would thicken the sauce so I doubled the liquids.  Next time will triple the liquids because we used it as a gravy over long grain rice.

I really liked this recipe. I used a dry marsala wine and as others said, made lots of sauce. I also added more mushrooms and used a yellow onion. Very good on multi-grain pasta. I couldn't stop eating the sauce.

Loved this but this time I had two surprise guests for dinner....4 breast, 6 diners.  I improvised by cutting the chicken into good size pieces without pounding it thinly and followed the directions except tripled the sauce.  I served over mashed and it was filling, stretched great and all were full.  Only did 1/2 and1/2 and it was delish!

Really like this, I made the entire sauce recipes but only used two chicken breasts.  I wanted the extra sauce because I served it over pasta.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because I would have liked the sauce a little thicker as others had mentioned.  I will add a touch of cornstarch next time I make this...and I will be making it again soon, hubby said it was a "do again"

So good and easy! This was my first time cooking with wine. I used other suggestions and put 1 cup of marsala and 8oz of cream. It was just me so I only used one chicken breast cut up into pieces. Loved it and will def make it again!

This was awesome! I coated the chicken in flour & Italian seasonings before cooking.  This helped thicken the sauce and added great flavor to the chicken.  I also added a cup of chopped yellow onion and a couple cloves of chopped garlic.  The sauce had a great flavor.

The BEST and so easy!  I like to use Chicken Tenderloin strips.  Doubled the mushrooms since we love mushrooms.  I tripled the sauce, as another reviewer suggested using an 8 oz carton of cream and 1 cup of marsala wine, leaving out the milk.  Also, coated the chicken with 1/4 cup flour with 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and then sautéed in 1 Tablespoon olive oil and 1 Tablespoon butter. I've added capers too.

Not my favorite.  I like a more golden demi-style glaze and although we doubled the sauce ingredients it still didn't make enough to cover our noodles.  Maybe we did something wrong but we won't be using this recipe again.

I feel guilty leaving this review, but I do it so I can remember what I've made. I did not have heavy cream or Marsala wine, so I did substitutions and that probably changed the test. It was good but not great, will try and make again with the exact ingredients it calls for.

This was delicious.  
I followed the advice of one reviewer who dredged the chicken with flour, and pounded it  in a plastic bag to tenderize it before cooking.
I also removed the chicken from the sauté pan while cooking the mushrooms and making the sauce so as not to over-cook the chicken.
The sauce was delicious, and you won't be sorry if you double (or triple!) the amount.

I made this tonight for dinner and was very pleased. My husband enjoyed it.  It was very easy to make and quick. I served it with mashed potatoes. I definitely will make this again.

Pretty decent, but I like more flavor and more sauce.  I added rosemary, parsley, garlic salt, garlic, and a little flour to thicken the sauce a bit.  I used baby portabellas....yummy!!

Easy 5 stars. I was looking for a recipe which didn't dredge the chicken in flour before sauteing it. I also wanted a thicker sauce than the previous marsala sauces I have had. This was spot on. I used evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream in order to save calories, and I doubled the sauce. This is really a great recipe!

Read through some reviews and made a few changes, but essentially the recipe was the same.  I mixed some salt, pepper, paprika and Italian seasoning in some flour. I cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise, dreadged them in the flour mixture and browned them.  I removed the chicken then sauted the mushrooms, a chopped onion and some minced garlic for about 8 minutes.  I added the Marsala and a little chicken broth to the mushrooms, added the chicken, and simmered for about 20 minutes (while I made some rice) .  I added 1/2 cup half & half instead of the heavy cream and milk and heated through.  Served with long grain and wild rice, broccoli, and clementines. It was a FABULOUS dinner!!!!  Thank you for this recipe.!!!

Delicious!  I did make a few changes per others comments:  I removed the chicken after it browned (kept it warm in the oven) and cooked the sauce separately.  When the sauce was done, I added the chicken back into the skillet and simmered for about 5 minutes. For the sauce - I didn't use cooking Sherry, just Marsala wine.  I doubled the amount of the  Marsala wine (1-1/2 cups) and tripled the mushrooms. I added about 1/2 cup of green onions and some fresh garlic when I was sauteing the mushrooms and then added 1/3 cup of cream to the sauce before putting the chicken back in.  One more thing - it makes a big difference if you pound the chicken thin.

Really good!  I used more wine than the recipe called for.  I just eye-balled how much sauce I wanted and added a little chicken broth to cut the wine taste a bit.  Next time I will add just a little bit of flour or cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I didn't serve it with pasta so I didn't need lots of extra sauce.  Good low-fat recipe.  I will definitely make again!

Thought it was great and easy. I added a bit more cream and milk to make more liquid to pour over.  I placed the chicken on rice that I had cooked in Vegetable broth.  Really loved the flavor for such as easy recipe.  I figure it not to be kid friendly due to the mushrooms and onions.

I loved the taste of this, but I thought the sauce was a little too thin, and the prep/cooking time is much longer than 15 minutes (apiece). But all in all, I will definitely make this recipe again.

Excellent recipe.  I used 1/2 cup sweet onion rather than the green onion, 1 cup marsala wine, 1 cup evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream, and took the chickeon out of the pan while cooking the sauce.  Thanks to the recipe author and all those who provided reviews for substitutions!

I make this often using canola oil or peanut oil. I like conola as it is heart healthy too. It is ez to change this rescipe adding other vegetables like frozen baby peas to it ar last minute to heat thru. Will try using bacon will be good too. Dredging chicken in flour garlic and salt n pepper is good as it will thicken the sauce a little for gravy but it is optional. Making sure chicken pieces are the same size saves on pounding them to make cooking uniform.  I have added fresh basil, thyme and each is really good in this rescipe.

Season chicken with salt and pepper, then dredge chicken in 1/4 cup flour with 1/2 teaspoon garlic power and cook in 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter.  Remove chicken from pan and add a little more olive oil and saute mushrooms with a little garlic.   Add chicken back to pan and add marsala and cream.

An easy and delicious meal.  I grabbed sweet Marsala wine AFTER reading the recipie & thought I'd screw this up, but it worked out just as well, if not better.  Did not use sherry, or cream or milk either.  The sauce came out excellent, and I read lots of other recipies from other sites before attempting this.  I made Chicken Marsala a long time ago, and for the life of me could not remember what I did, but it did turn out great.  I used 2 cans of mushrooms, drained, and also two tablespoons of bottled minced garlic, plus I diced a medium onion and sautéed all of it in the same pan after doing the chicken.  DO NOT OMIT flouring and frying the chicken--I feel this is key.  I also seasoned the flour with dried Italian seasonings that you can pick up at any grocery store, along with salt and pepper.  DId not season the chicken, since I seasoned the flour, and the whole meal came out excellent.  I served it over spaghetti, and you want to make sure you have enough sauce.  I ended up using the ENTIRE bottle of Marsala wine for 6 chicken breasts, along with a can of chicken broth.  Again, I omitted the cream and milk and sherry and it was restaurant quality.

Easy - yes - but needed to add some butter/olive oil, 1T of cornstarch to thicken and some marjoram & garlic powder.   Original seemed bland and a little watery.   No disrespect to OP at all - just prefer a bit more flavor.

This is a keeper!  Even my Italian girlfriend was impressed with the recipe.  I tweaked it a little bit though.  Here's what I did: I cooked the chicken first and set it aside (I didn't want to over cook it); I doubled the sauce (heavy cream, wine, and milk); added a few dashes of oregano, and added a few teaspoons of grated parmesan cheese.  Once the 'shrooms and green onions were cooked and the sauce was reduced a bit I added the chicken back to the pan.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

It's great for a week night dinner and didn't have time to dredge in flour mixture as some suggested. Instead of pounding down the chicken breast, I used thighs instead. Used chopped yellow onions and sautéed it in half olive oil and couple of tablespoons of butter, then added sliced mushrooms and a little dried oregano, s&p.  Used 1/2C of Marsala wine, cooked & reduced for about 4 min, and then added the 1/3C heavy cream and 1/8C 1% milk, and simmered for 5 min.  Definitely will make again!

Doubled the wine and only used a splash of cream.  Added crushed garlic, used red onion because that's what I had.  Very easy and tasty.  Served with angel hair.  Will definitely make again.

Yum! Yum! Such a great recipe.  I seasoned my chicken before sauteing them. The amount of cream and milk should be adjusted if you prefer a darker marsala as opposed to a lighter one. You will have to spot. I suggest mixing the milk and cream together and only putting half in at a time. I serve this with pasta (plenty of gravy) and veggies. It was a delight.

I cut in half each chicken and pounded them flat. Used sweet onion and chives instead of green onions (I didn't have any). Added slightly more Marsala wine and 1/2 and 1/2. Very good and fast!

I'm not a wonderful cook, but I know my way around the kitchen. This was a very simple recipe that didn't require many ingredients and turned out pretty tasty! I added garlic powder to the chicken before sautéing for some added flavor while also seasoning it with additional salt and pepper. The only change I would make is to I up the portions for the sauce just a bit. I served this over pasta and the recipe didn't yield quite enough sauce to coat the pasta. Otherwise, great recipe and I'll cook it again.

Easy peasy!  If the instructions were more broken up, it would be more clear, but even screwing up the order of operations, it turned out very good.

Delicious! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think it needs quite a bit more sauce. I modified the recipe a bit...After the chicken breasts were sautéed and cooked thoroughly , I removed them and set aside. I then sautéed the mushrooms and scallions in the same skillet, in about a tsp. of butter, before adding the wine and cream. I served over Garlic and Parsley fettuccini. It was a big hit!

Made this recipe for the first time and it was ok found that cooking the chicken until done then adding the wine and cream at the end made the chicken kinda dry and overcooked by the time the sauce thickened up to my liking but i reheated the leftovers the next day and after sitting in sauce overnight it was better then when it was first done

I made this following one of the suggestions of subbing evap. milk in place of the cream and increasing the marsala. This recipe was far too sweet for my likes and lacked flavor and I was disappointed in it. My modifications would be to add fresh garlic cloves and to lower the sweetness somehow...?adding chicken broth and balance out some of the sweetness from the marsala or the milk.

I tripled the recipe to make more sauce. Only problem is the cream- 1 cup of cream was waaay too much, so I assume 1/3 for the original recipe would be way to much. It made it a creamy sauce and it was ok, but it tasted only like cream and we were expecting Marsala.  So yes, we will try this again, but cut the cream down by 1/3.  It wasn't even brown.

I've never tried regular Chicken Marsala but I've loved all the Indian food recipes I've tried so far except this. Perfect recipe in every way- I do not prefer the taste of the wine at all. I'll think of something else to replace it with.

WOW! This was so incredibly easy to make and tasted divine. I pounded out the chicken, which made the chicken extra tender. Coated  them w/flour and sauteed lightly with garlic in olive oil.  Added 1 cup Marsala wine and 8 oz cream for extra sauce. Served it with brown rice and asparagus.  Your friends and family will oooh & aaahhh over this FABULOUS dish. BON APPETIT=)

I made several changes. Firstly using thigh fillets instead of breast as they have a sweeter flavour, coated them in cornflour & mixed herbs then seared them in the pot. I also sauteed diced pancetta with brown onion, & poured the marsala & about a cupful of chicken stock to deglaze, then turned heat to lowe & simmered till half reduced. Finally, instead of cream & milk, I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup (Campbell)to thicken the sauce & give it added body. Served it with mashed potatoes. Hubby & dinner guest loved it, went for seconds. Great!

It was really great, even without the Marsala wine. I didn't have any so I substituted 1 tsp of balsamic vinegar, and added some minced fresh garlic. I also added parmesan and shredded mozzarella to each serving. It was very tasty!
