Really loved this. I had a pound of lean beef and about 1/3 of a pound of higher fat beef so I made this with both of them.  Came out delicious and the veggies being cooked with the meat I think was my favorite part... I had to sub regular carrots that I coarse chopped.  Made the house smell wonderful too
