Absolutely delicious!  I was looking for a sweet potato latkes recipe because I can't have white potatoes due to allergy.  I am so glad I found this and tried this recipe!  I was eating them as I was cooking them and couldn't stop!  Fortunately for others, I did not eat all of them up!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly as it is the first time and made it with dehydrated onion the second time.  I used local (Big Island) purple sweet potatoes  I wasn't sure about the quantity of potatoes to use, so I added the potatoes a dollop at a time to the egg mixture until I had the consistency I wanted.  I made it for the girls at book club when I was making French/Jewish (w/ a local twist) meal.  It was a big hit, I'm glad there were leftovers for the family!

Yum!  I added a little brown sugar as well, the second batch.  A bit hit both ways!

This was a great way to use a sweet potato.  I didn't rinse the grated potato in salt water, and I added Mrs. Dash instead of pepper.  The first four came out a little dark, but all the rest came out great! Served with unsweetened applesauce to balance the sweetness of the potato. A hit!

These turned out delicious!  I did need to add another egg, and maybe half an onion was a little too much for my tastes, but these are personal choices.  For the yogurt topping, I strained the yogurt for a few hours mixed with a little sea salt, cayenne, and fresh parsley -- a rich, creamy, flavorful addition!

Easy to make and yummy!  Make sure the oil doesn't get too hot so they cook all the way through before you flip them.  I didn't add onions and they came out just as good.  Also, I didn't need any extra egg like another reviewer said.  I think it depends on the size of the sweet potato you buy.  Next time I make it I will be adding brown sugar.  I didn't serve mine with yogurt and applesauce and they were just as good.

This is a great recipe.  I used Japanese sweet potatoes, an extra egg and fried in bacon grease-totally awesome.  Next time I will experiment with some herbs.

My husband likes these more than potato latkes. I chose to do sweet potato to avoid all the straining (and they're healthier than potatoes); for that matter, I also used pre-minced onion - great idea! I used three eggs because my sweet potato was really large, but then I had issues with them not binding, so I sprinkled in some matzah meal. I also like the fact that it's more a pan fry than a deep fry - they 're not as horribly (deliciously) greasy as regular latkes. I'll be making these again for the eighth night of Hanukkah!

These turned out quite tasty. Instead of small ones, I just made 4 large latkes. I didnt' want to fry them, so I cooked them on my pancakes griddle for about 5 minutes per side and finished them off in the oven. Great taste!

Easy to make and very tasty. I added one more egg as well as some chopped fresh basil and chopped garlic.. Prior to adding the grated potato to the egg mixture, i microwaved it a few minutes with a few stirs inbetween to make sure it was well cooked. And after forming the patty, I pressed it into a panko/parmesan cheese/salt and pepper mixture. This added good flavor and a yummy crunchy outside. The applesauce idea was great and i squeezed some lemon into the plain yogurt. Will make this again!

Very good!  Because the onion is grated, it kind of caramelizes as it cooks. I did not serve them with sour cream or applesauce - I topped them with poached eggs and let the runny yolks serve as a sauce. So good! This is a simple recipe with basic ingredients....it tastes exactly like what it is and isn't masked by a bunch of unnecessary extras.

Teenage kids loved it! But I did substitute cheddar cheese for the feta. Center was a bit gooey so next time Iâ€™ll make the patties thinner.

I have been making my own version of these for breakfast for ages, but came across this recipe. Mine didn't have grated onion and yum, that really makes them good. Also they are good with ras el hanout to spice them, and cooked in coconut oil.

I did tweak this recipe a little, but it was very tasty! I'm not a huge fan of onions, so I used chopped scallions instead, and I also added some red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese. Overall though, these latkes were delicious!

First attempt at homemade Latkes. I used a full onion and it still seemed undersized compare to the amount of grated sweet potatoes, so I added a 1/4 tsp of onion powder to the mix. It came out yummy. My wife made the standard box mix and the sweet potato version was the favorite by far.

The flavor and texture was perfect, but many latkes fell apart during the frying process. I wonder if the addition of a tablespoon of flour would help, or if perhaps reserving and re-introducing the potato starch might be a good idea?

These were SO simple, and SO tasty! This was my first time making any sort of latkes...and when i found a sweet potato one i was sold! When i make these again, i will skip the rinsing in water part . I went the non traditional route and topped mine with some of my roasted garlic Tzatiki sauce.

Loved these! I also have a potato allergy and have really been missing my potato pancakes but these are awesome! Next time I will try  smaller or dehydrated onions. I had used my cheese grater but found the pieces a bit undercooked maybe due to their size. But we all loved these. Will make them again :)

These were very yummy! I made them exactly as the recipe went except I didn't soak the sweet potatoes I just added a bit of salt. I topped it with chanterelle mushrooms sautÃ©ed with shallots, olive oil and salt and pepper. Add a dollop of sour cream and totally yummy!!!!!!

I loved them, the flavor very good, next time I think I will up the onion just a little and add garlic. There will be many more next times I am sure. easy and fun to make a colorful tasty addition to any dinner. I served these for dinner with baked chicken and broccoli a smashing success.

I saw this recipe in the Allrecipes magazine and thought I'd give it a try.  I found this to be very easy to make; and a nice twist on our regular latkes.

There were great! They added a great twist to the traditional latke. Although they were delicious- we still preferred the traditional latke.
