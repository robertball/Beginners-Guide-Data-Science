This was really easy to make and tastes pretty good!  It's basically a cinnamon swirl bread with some cardamom in the swirl part.  I added a little extra cardamom to it so that flavor would come through a bit more; I wish I had added even more to let it really shine!    Aside from that, as far as directions go, save your butter.  There is no way you'll use a 1/2 cup melted butter putting on the cinnamon mixture.  I'd recommend using 2-3 melted tablespoons and see how far that gets you.  I ended up leaving 2-3 tablespoons of the cinnamon mix out because my bread was already completely covered and I didn't see how more could really fit on.  Go ahead and just dump it on.  The cinnamon ribbon comes out somewhat thin after it's baked, but it's really good!

I made the dough in my bread machine, but formed and baked it as directed. The dough came out great; easy to work with, nice texture, and good taste. I spread on the full 1/2 cup butter, but I agree w/a previous reviewer that it's way too much. 1/4 cup butter would be more than enough. Also, although I really like cardamom, I found it very overpowering to the point of making the bread bitter. I would cut way back on the cardamom also.

I made this for Easter and was a big hit. I had enough for 2 large loaves which surprised me so made one without nuts for kids. Couldn't find pearl sugar so just used some rough table sugar. A keeper.
