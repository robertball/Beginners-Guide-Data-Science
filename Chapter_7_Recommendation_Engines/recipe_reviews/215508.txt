So this site wouldn't let me edit my previous review, so I am posting a second review. When I initially made this, I forgot the parmesan. The next day, I took the left overs and blended them in the food processor, along with the parm to make it into a spread that I ate on crackers. I don't know if it was the parm, the sitting overnight so the flavors blended better, pureeing it, or the addition of the cracker flavor, but it was really good this way!
