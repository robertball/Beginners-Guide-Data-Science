This was delicious! As always, I adjusted the recipe according to what was in the cupboards, i.e. white wine instead of vermouth, small onion inteaad of shallots, double cream not whipping cream. but it made an average roast dinner that much more special. I also roasted the vegetables in the same dish as the chicken; the carrots tasted wonderful! 
I would probably increase the amounts of the sauce if I was making it again, it was so delicious 2 of us had no problem finishing it all off! (recipe for 4 people!) Thank you Denise.

I wanted something simple to make and this was it!!  Not only was it easy, it was absolutely delicious as well.  Since I didn't have vermouth on hand, I sustituted sherry, which wasn't half bad.  I will definately prepare this again and again and again...

I used chicken broth and a little red cooking wine instead of vermouth ( I just do not keep alcohol on hand).  I also seasoned the chicken with a teaspoon each of poultry seasoning, dried rosemary, and dried parsley.  The chicken turned out scrumptious.  THE CRACKED PEPPERCORN SAUCE IS AWESOME!  I had it over mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.

9.4.05 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/56946/roast-chicken-with-cracked-peppercorn-sauce/ ... I couldn't decide if I wanted to make Spicy Rapid Roast Chicken or this - so I combined them, kind of. I used the recipe here with the directions there pretty much. :/ :D Using a 4 & a half pound chicken, I combined a 1/4t salt, 1/4t pepper & 1T olive oil & brushed that on. I put 1/4t salt & 1/4t pepper inside. Since I didn't have shallots, or the desire to go out & try to find some, I subbed 1/4c minced onion & 3 cloves minced garlic with the vermouth. 450 oven for 30 & 400 for 60. It was nicely browned & slightly crispy. Next time, I'll take it off for a bit near the end. It was too salty, too. I'll probably half the amounts I tried. To save calories (big laugh), I used half & half. It tasted good, but didn't thicken. I also didn't feel like crushing peppercorns so used coarse ground black pepper. It was fine. I don't see how a tablespoon of pepper couldn't be a typo. I thought it was 1 tsp so tried 3/4t. Although it didn't thicken for (hot) dinner, it thickened up fine for (cold) lunch. I poured the sauce in with the chicken meat. Next day, it was quite yummy. I added some chicken salad ingredients with chopped apples. 'Put it on French bread & had a good time. :D It was worth waiting a day to have. :)

I love to roast chicken and have tried many different recipes and this ranks at the top! It was SO GOOD! The sauce was outstanding! I served it with smashed potatoes.  My husband couldn't stop! I cooked it in a roasting pan with a tight fitting lid. I think this is much better than foil as it really seals in the moisture. I had PLENTY of drippings left for the gravey. It WAS very salty so next time I will rub the chicken with a very small amount of salt and I think that will fix it.  Also, instead of heavy cream I used fat-free milk.  I heated one cup in the microwave until it was steaming (watch it closely).  I then immediately whisked in about five tbsp flour one at a time and then added this to the reduced drippings.  I got a very smooth gravy which was not too rich.  You're not going to get the thickness this way that you would with heavy cream but it wasn't watery and tasted great and certainly was much more healthy.  I will absolutely make this again. GREAT RECIPE!

This recipe did not work for me. The chicken itself was wonderfuly moist and tender, but the sauce was horrible.  I was excited to try a peppercorn sauce but it just didn't work.  I'll have to try another recipe for the sauce.

This was a great recipe.  I tweaked a bit, substituting white wine for the vermouth and milk thickened with flour for the cream.  I also added a bit of herbs de provence to the chicken.  

The peppercorn sauce was a delicious little gravy, I wish there was more of it!  There will be next time I make this, and there definitely will be a next time.  

I served it with mashed potatoes and peas and some tasty dinner rolls.

This turned out to be very good, but with very subtle flavor, not a big flavor.  I used the usual substitutes: chardonnay wine for Vermouth, and onions for shallots.  After about an hour in the oven, it was a pale chicken with A LOT of watery juice, so I poured most into a saucepan and boiled it down, while continuing to roast the chicken. It did brown up nicely.  I only used a teaspoon of peppercorns, worried that they would turn off certain picky eaters in my family.  I dissolved a teaspoon of flour into half and half before adding to juice -- it thickened up like gravy, which was very good.

Well...  I don't know what to say, other than I think this recipe has some potential.  Vermouth must be salty, because this dish was VERY salty and VERY peppery with 1 Tablespoon of cracked peppercorns (and yes I did crack my own peppercorns).  I didn't hate this, but didn't love it.  The chicken was moist.  I give it 2 stars because I probably won't make it again, but it was edible.  Sorry, I really had high hopes for this recipe, it sounded so good.

Tried this recipe last night and my chicken turned out soooo moist. Every part was seasoned and full of flavor. The cream sauce was an added "palate pleasing" taste. Impressed my mother into thinking I've been taking classes. So easy to prepare. Hope others try this. Side dished mine w/homemade mashed potatoes w/hints of garlic. :-)

Followed the recipe completely. This was just okay for us. I was looking for a good peppercorn sauce, this was just okay. Will not be making this again.

This turned out amazing.  I used chicken stock and white wine for the broth, stuffed the cavity of the bird with fresh rosemary, and sprinkled it inside and out with herbes de provence along with the salt and pepper.  I also basted the chicken while it was baking.  The chicken was unbelievably tender and moist and the sauce was wonderful; my husband was drinking it as soup!

Yum!.. The sauce was wonderful and I used Sherry instead of Vermuth; I did have to thicken it because I used half and half instead of whole cream.  I also took another tip and poured off my liquid into a saucepan and then left the chicken uncovered for the second hour (6lb chicken) to brown the skin.  Really good thanks! :)

This was a really good roasted chicken recipe! i used green onions instead of shallots but other than that i followed the recipe. i did have trouble getting the broth down to 1/2 cup so i had to add some corn starch to thicken the peppercorn sauce. it was really good. will make this again!

The sauce was awesome!  I even used it the next day with the left over chicken to make a pot pie.  I didn't care for the chicken recipe, so I used another. Otherwise, very good.

Chicken was great, sauce didn't work out so well for me as I tried substituting something to reduce the fat grams.

This made a delicious dinner, and with enough for left overs later on in the evening! I didn't have any chicken on hand unfortunately, so I substituted a little more cream and a more time simmering to thicken up a little more. Around room temp the sauce congealed to a near solid with a beautiful texture. Honestly, I don't know if I'd bother to add chicken next time!

Love, loved. No vermouth in my liquor cupboard, so used the chicken broth and white wine suggested; am lactose (and gluten) sensitive, so did a butter and corn starch gravy with poulty seasoning, rosemary, thyme, sea salt and of course cracked pepper. Was moist and delish! (My man really liked it too!)
