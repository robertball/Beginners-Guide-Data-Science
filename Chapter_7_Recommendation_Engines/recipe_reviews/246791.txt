I had never eaten lo mein when I came upon this recipe, so I thought I'd give it a try. I over cooked my veges (my fault), but the flavor was great. The only thing I'd change is to add another tbsp or two of the chile paste.

Doubled initial sauce, should have tripled is since we packed in a lot of vegetables. You can truly use any vegetables you want we used a bag of snap peas, a head of broccoli, a half bag of carrot sticks and a lot of mushrooms. Overall it was very tasty and will make again.

Excellent recipe! I doubled the sauce as others recommended and liked the result. I used lo mein noodles instead of spaghetti. I like them better in this recipe. extremely easy to make!

This has potential but the pork was lacking flavor.  Maybe if it marinated and then when in the slow cooker. I wouldnâ€™t make it again though.

This was easy and tasted yummy.
I used beef tri-tip because it was on sale.   I cooked it for 5 hours on low. (all other instructions the same).
Be sure and double the sauce.  I forgot to do it initially, so I made extra sauce before I put the veggies into the crockpot. I also used whole wheat pasta since we have diabetics in the house.  Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious!  The family loved it.  I added all kinds of fresh veggies.  'Shrooms, baby corn, julienned sweet peppers, broccoli, and more.  The pork was tender and tasty.  I used lo mien noodles.  I used a 4 pound pork roast, and made a bit extra sauce.  There is enough for leftovers.  Great recipe! will make again.
