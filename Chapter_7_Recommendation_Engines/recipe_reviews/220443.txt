Excellent recipe I used dried rice noodles and regular basil instead of Thai.  I used lemon in place of lime and followed the recipe as illustrated.  I was completely surprised how wonderful the flavor of this dish turned out!  Will be making again.

Wow......this recipe is over the top delicious.  I did not have palm sugar so I substituted brown sugar.  I added some broccoli and mushrooms and only 1/2 package of dried wide rice noodles.  If you are not used to using dried noodles, the best thing to do with these rice noodles is to pour boiling water over them and let them sit 3-8 minutes until tender.  Then, drain and let them sit in cold water until you are ready to add them to the pan.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.  I was craving Thai food and was extremely happy to create something so authentic in my own home--for a LOT less money.  I highly recommend using Thai basil in this recipe--it has amazing flavor!

I made this last night because we had some fish sauce and it seemed neat.  It was super salty, but AWESOME.  I did reduce the amount of noodles to 1/2 bag, add carrots instead of red pepper and cilantro instead of basil, but only because that is what I had on hand.  I can't see how you could really mess this up adding/subtracting "chunks" in this recipe because the sauce is so good.

This one is a keeper!  Everyone loved it!  It even rivaled the Pad Kee Mow that I order at my favorite local Thai restaurant.  It was quick, easy and fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have quite enough Thai basil and substituted 1 cup regular basil. It was just the right level of spiciness for me.  I usually order medium at Thai restaurants.

***Also - brand/style of fish sauce can make a huge difference.  I tried Phad Thai with some milky looking fish sauce - it was disgusting.  Squid brand fish sauce is what a Thai friend recommended.  It's a clear brown that is much milder and not scary at all.

Loved it but it was incredibly salty. Made my five year old cry. Would cut the fish sauce and soy sauce in 1/2. Is fairly spicy, which my husband and older son loved.

I made a few minor adjustments- used dried rice noodles, regular sugar, and regular basil.  I used thin rice noodles because that's what I had on hand, but in the future would definitely use wide.  First of all, the flavor was AWESOME!!  But, like pretty much everyone else said, ridiculously salty (and I used reduced sodium soy sauce, too).  The flavor really makes it worth it, but I would love to find a way to cut back on the saltiness of this dish.

Delicious!!  I followed the sauce recipe exactly and that's what makes this so tasty.  I had carrots, mushrooms, bean sprouts and sugar snap peas I needed to use up, so I added those as well as the recipe vegetables.  Used about 2/3 of the noodles because I like things a little saucy.  Next time I'll go a lot lighter with the pepper flakes because it was very hot!  Restaurant quality.

Holy hot!  It was too spicy to eat!  If the pepper was adjusted, this may have been a really good recipe.

Tasted so good...couldn't believe I made it!  I did reduce the fish sauce, soy sauce, red chili flakes and black pepper by half.  Will be making this again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was very flavorful and delicious! I used regular basil (instead of Thai Basil) and white sugar (instead of palm sugar). It couldn't have been better! This recipe is spicy due to the red pepper, so reduce or omit if you don't like spicy food. Cheers!

Super yummy!  I used brown rice noodles, and only 1/2 of what was recommended. Don't forget to add water to thin out the sauce. I substituted sweet chili sauce for the red pepper flakes, because it's less spicy.

This came out really good. I used rehydrated chile peppers instead of the pepper flakes. I couldn't find wide rice noodles so I used Polish egg noodles. Instead of  plain water I added some of the water that I used to rehydrate the chile peppers.  Some brands of fish sauce are more pungent than others. I added a smaller amount than the recipe called for.   I also added a teaspoon of molasses to the sauce.  For the veggies I used sliced green peppers, bean sprouts, mushrooms and sugar snap peas. Thanks for the recipe:)

I made as listed above with half the crushed red pepper and plus 2 small peppers from my garden. Recipe is good in masking the heat but it is WAY TOO SALTY. Not sure which you would need less of... soy sauce, oyster sauce or fish sauce. 1/2 cup of oyster sauce is definitely a lot.

I changed the soy sauce to dark soy sauce and did not have an issue with it being too salty.  I also did not have palm sugar either.  I also added bean sprouts at the end with the other ingredients!  Very good!

A few words of caution about this recipe. We have attempted it twice. I may attempt it a 3rd time, but with significant changes. 1) Fish sauce comes in a wide variety. Don't use the green sewer sludge variety, or you'll be opening windows and apoligizing to neighbors for days. 2) Fish sauce is extremely salty. As the man who runs the local Asian emporium told us, you should never need to use more than a teaspoon - probably a half-teaspoon. Granted, he is from the Phillipines, but he has a valid point. Fish sauce is salty, salty, salty, and ... well, fishy. 3) The proportions, for us, resulted in a very soupy mixture. That may be because we chose to use Sharitaki noodles (zero calories) but if we make this again, we will reduce the vinegar/sauce mixture and double the noodles. Lastly, I'm not sure how many of you keep "palm sugar" on hand. We couldn't find it in any store, so we used light brown sugar. The sweet, salty (although too much with this recipe) and spicy combination was good. Makes us want to search for other Thai recipes.

Very good.  Like some of the suggestions mentioned, it's a bit salty so I halved the oyster and soy sauces.  I also added extra tomatoes and basil.

This was SO yummy!  I subbed in broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and mushrooms for the veggie component and it worked great.  It was even better the next day for lunch leftovers :-)

Easy recipe and very good. Skipped the oyster sauce because I was out and added broccoli and carrots like some others. Also used regular dried basil instead of Thai. I halved the red pepper, deciding we could add more individually if needed and it was list I'll pretty spicy. Easy weekend lunch. Thanks!

We really liked this but like others, found it way too salty. Next time, I will try to add more vinegar, lime juice and sugar to counteract the excessive salt.  Would be 5 star if successful.

Excellent! I used 1/2 the red pepper flakes and found it still too hot for me. I will try less next time. Didn't have Tai basil, used 1 Tablespoon dry basil. The flavors blended beautifully.

I was craving a Thai dish just like this! It was amazing! Just a little bit spicy for my taste, so next time ill use half the amount of red pepper and Serrano. Otherwise, absolutely perfect! I added bean sprouts and broccoli, while also using a different kind of noodle because I like them a little thicker.Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!
