My new favorite way for butter beans !  These would make a great appetizer for happy hour as well, could not stop eating them right out of the skillet!  Messed up and did not print the recipe out and used thyme instead of rosemary...yummy as well.

I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used dried. I realized after I ate it that I had forgotten to add the salt and pepper. Other than that, I followed the recipe, and it was quite good! Very easy and fast, a nice change of pace from plain butter beans heated up. I'm happy to have something new to join my other side dish recipes that I rotate through.

I'm not a fan of canned beans so I made this recipe first as listed but I had used fresh beans which didn't cook properly. The beans came out undercooked but the flavor had so much promise. So i made them again two days later with fresh beans that were hulled and boiled 10 minutes first. OMG amazing! This is now a staple side for us.

I used fresh-frozen Lima’s. My husband only wants them this way now. We loved them!

Delicious. The only thing I didn’t have is white wine vinegar, so I used a splash of red wine vinegar. It worked fine and really enhanced the flavors! I added some left over chopped chicken breast, and it made a really awesome meal! Weight Watcher friendly, I might add!

Wow, I can’t believe the flavor with just a few ingredients and some canned beans.  They almost tasted breaded.  I forgot the vinegar at first, and it still was phenomenal.  A cheap but delicious side, that everyone will want to make.

I used dried rosemary and probably just 2 tbs of oil and it was FANTASTIC. My 7 yr old called them disgusting but she isn't used to eating butter beans so I don't trust her judgment.

I added chopped onion and sliced cremini mushrooms to the beans right at the beginning so they fried and browned at the same time. I had no white wine vinegar so used rice vinegar.  I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It was a very tasty side dish to some leftover roast beef.

These were outstanding!!!  Had I understood how good they are, I would have tripled the recipe!!!   Got to use my fresh rosemary from the garden.   Mmmmmm

Oh, as an afterthought I threw in just a few cherry tomatoes to use them up.   Extra deliciousness and I would do it again  but not needed.

This was suprisingly good. I had some butter beans  left from a recipe. Wanted to keep it WW friendly so I used a little less oil. I decided to skp the vinager because I was taking it to work the next day,. I will make again. Kept eating them while they were in the sklllet.
