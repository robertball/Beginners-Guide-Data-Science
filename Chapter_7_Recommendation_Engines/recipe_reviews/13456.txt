Wonderful combination.  First stuff the celery, THEN cut it into pieces.  Easier & quicker.

This was a hit!  There was nary a piece left after the party.  I did take earlier reviewer's suggestion and doubled the nuts to 1/2 c chopped walnuts.  I can see where that made a difference.  Would definitely make again.  Thanks, Linda.

I absolutely loved this dip, both with celery and crackers.  The problem is that none of the pickier eaters in our group would even touch it.  The walnuts seemed to totally soften, so there was no 'crunch' - maybe pecans would work better.  Also, if you aren't crazy about the flavor of green olives, then go much lighter on them or sub. black olives, because it does get intense.  But wow - what a great dip!

This was a bit hit. We used fat free sour cream and the imitation cream cheese (starts with an "n") with 1/3 less fat, and we upped the amount of walnuts to 1/2 cup. Very tasty, and great on celery and crackers! Will make this again for parties.

These are great! It is a nice change of pace as an appetizer. I put chopped nuts on top of the celery - I haveeven just served the spread on crackers and skipped the celery when I ran out of time.

This is better than the black-olive-only recipe I was familiar with as a child. The flavor bursts into your mouth. One suggestion - boost the walnut count a little.

My family wasn't crazy about this recipe and we all thought it lacked flavor.  It was easy and my daughters (12 & 9) had fun making it.  Next time, I will add more walnuts and maybe some garlic powder.

I made these for Thanksgiving last night and I was very disappointed. They were utteryly tasteless. I salvaged them by adding some worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, black pepper and a bit of Marmite (I am South African and love the stuff. Most Americans hate it so I didn't publicize it). It tasted vastly improved but I would NOT make this again.

It's easier to cut the celery stalks into bite sized pieces after they have been stuffed with the filling.

I thought this was okay.  Nothing fancy.  It definately goes better as an appetizer than a side dish.  I might make it again for parties.

I had to give this high marks because I am not a stuffed celery lover but I had this limp celery that I wanted to use up and having a party to take something to... why not try it?  So I cut off the bottom of the wilted celery stalks and left them in water overnight. The result, fresh celery ideal for stuffing. I may have over-measured the olives and walnuts but the recipe came out great.  I liked it a lot.

A smart snack - a much healthier alternative than other, less smart, snacks I tend to grab.  Very tasty, non-boring way to get a fat fix without feeling deprived, because you've cut out the bad-for-you (but addictingly delicious) carbs.  I gave it a shot of hot sauce and, since I had them available, threw in some ripe black olives along with the green. Lots of flavor and lots of texture is what makes this so good.(I think adding some chopped, dried beef would really take this over the top!)

This is a "going home" recipe!  Celery paired with the cream cheese/ sour cream mixture really hit the spot with my favorite cranberry jello dish, along with Christmas leftovers.  When I first made it, I didn't have any olives, and it was tasty w/o them.  In fact, the next time I make the "stuffing," I think I will put in fewer olives.  A friend enjoyed it as a dip with potato chips, and I will eat it on crackers.  I liked the addition of chopped olives with pimintoes, and the color the pimentoes provided.  Thank you, Linda, for posting this "classic."

Great little spread.  Replaced Ranch bottle dressing for the sour cream and pecans for the walnuts.  Made it early in the day to allow flavors to blend.  Great on veg, crackers or as a sandwich spread!

I'm sure it is good, just not gluten free.  Cream cheese has traces of gluten in it.  I will try this using another soft cheese.

After reading some of the reviews stating the recipe was bland, I decided to go ahead and try it. I was pretty sure I could save it if I had to. I went ahead and made it exactly as written and never had to make the first adjustment. I love the texture that the walnuts and the chopped olives gave it and it was nicely seasoned due to the salt and flavor from the olives. I will most definitely make it again!!! Thanks Linda!

I'm giving this 3 stars to be fair, but I really can't stand olives so this spread was just at least stomachable to me, but those at my party who were brave enough to try it said they liked it.  There were still lots left on the plate at the end of the night though, so not a winner for me. I found it super easy to put the spread in a ziplock baggie, seal it, snip of the corner, and squeeze the spread onto each peice that way.  If you hate olives though, I don't recommend this recipe...

I thought it was just ok....kind of bland, almost doubled the amount of green olives to get some taste.  

First time I've been to a party where the food that I brought was leftover after the party was over....how embarassing!

I used jalapeno stuffed green olives and added 2 Tbsps shredded carrot. I completely missed the sour cream. That might assist the "spreadability" so I'll try not to forget next time. My 2yo took to this really quick so I'll be making this again.

My kids love this stuffed celery. They look for it every holiday. The only thing I do different is I leave out the walnuts. Taste best if made a day ahead.

These are easy and fun to make, I would leave out the olive, as I dont' care for the taste.  A splash of mustard or hot sauce would give it a twist.

My grandmother has made stuffed celery for as long as I can remember, so I'm glad to have come across your version Linda.  We left out the walnuts and have also tried stuffing celery with pimento cheese.  Good recipe.

No strings attached!  A recipe from waayback, with a few tweaks - I'd just add that unless you want my Mother to haunt you forever, you better "de-string" that celery really well!!!

Just not my cup of tea - I love green olives but they don't work well with the cream cheese, in my opinion.  Only my son ate this at a recent holiday party we had, the rest went into the garbage.  I will not make it again.

I'm not surprised by other comments that people at parties didn't eat this, it is celery after all. But the spread is good, my husband complained that the celery ruined it.

This is a great snack. Because Im on a super tight budget, walnuts couldn't be used, so I used sunflower seeds, it was very tasty, but made it a bit more salty. I want to try the walnuts and as soon as they are on special, I will!

Great twist on celery sticks, which I love to snack on.  I used all low fat products with awesome results and actually make tons of these up at once, stick them in tupperware in the fridge and then grab them as I need them.  Wonderful healthy snack - thanks much!

No nuts for us and left out the sour cream. Added a couple of tablespoons of olive juice to get a better spread consistency. Economic and delicious retro appetizer.

walnuts and green olives & pimentos – who knew they would go together so well?! the walnuts add a very nice texture and different type of crunch to your stuffed celery. I made 2 batches: the first as the recipe was written which was very good. To the second batch I added 12-15 shakes of Frank’s hot sauce.  I found this to be extra good with the sour cream and cream cheese mix. Both batches went quickly from the snack table!!  Also, the recipe made as written makes a great spread for bagels (I suggest sesame).

My mother used to make celery stuffed with cream cheese mixed with chopped maraschino cherries.  I hadn;t had it in about 40 years and then had it at a dinner in December.  I made it for my family for New Years Eve and they ate every piece!

I've been making this for years. Sometime when I'm feeling crazy I'll leave out the walnuts and add red pepper flakes to give it a kick.This is also very good on bagels.

This was alright, but a bit boring. It needs something else, but I'm not sure what. Thanks anyway.

This is so yummy!  Once I made this, my family gobbled it up and demanded that I make more!  It is also delicious with crackers.

Tasted a little bland at first so I added some lemon zest (about 1 tsp.). I consider myself a minimalist so I loved this recipe. Creamy,crunchy, lemony

I thought these were yummy, particularly for a low carb diet snack. I grew weary of the peanut butter in celery low carb snack (being the one person on earth who is not s fan of peanut butter), and these were a wonderful alternative. God bless the reviewer who recommended to fill an entire stalk before cutting into smaller sticks! I wouldn’t change a thing about this recipe.

It didn't have quite enough flavor to me so I added smoked paprika and coarse ground black pepper to recipe.  It gave it just the right amount of flavor richness needed!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Not sure if there were too many olives or perhaps walnuts but they did not go over very well at the party. I used exact ingredients.

Needed more flavor for our buds.
Added cayenne, onion, apples  & relish .
Used celery sticks & red, yellow,  orange bell pepper slices.
Got that sweet n' spicy flavor. 
Was a huge hit!  Loved it!
This will be a definite go to appetizer.

I used eight ounces neufchatel, forty finely-diced pimento-stuffed green olives (I think my olives were kinda small), coupla tablespoons finely-diced onion,  a few shakes of smoked paprika, mainly for color. Instead of sour cream, which I assumed was for easier spreading, I added some liquid from the olives. After thoroughly mixing, put into a Ziploc bag. In the morning, snip the corner of the bag and pipe into the celery.  Update of 12/06/16 review...ugh...piping did not go well...gonna need to rethink : /

this recipe was just okay it didn't knock my socks off or anything. It was fun for my daughter and I to make together. I added ranch seasoning and salad dressing mix for added flavor. A little hot sauce will help to give it a kick too. I also used more olives then the recipe suggested.

I've been making this recipe for years and years....for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  My only difference is using mayo instead of sour cream and a little olive brine to thin the mixture out.  Otherwise, love this recipe.

My family has made stuffed celery since before I was born! We don't put nuts or sour cream in it. We just use a package of cream cheese, some diced green olives and celery sticks! We usually dust it with paprika powder! Doesn't change the flavor just makes it extra pretty! :)

I made this recipe exactly as it was instructed and it didn't taste very good. First, it was too salty and after the salt all you could taste was cream cheese. :-(

I have made these stuffed celery for YEARS...!!!  These are the best. We always have these for an appetizer before our big meal at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Nice to have at 4th of July outing also..as it's very cool (kept on ice) when it's real hot outside.  Yum..yum...can"t be beat, everyone should try them!!!!  I also use the recipe as written...sometimes with the nuts, sometimes without.

Made this for a family get together and none of us really cared for this recipe. Maybe it was the combination of green olives and nuts. Would not make again.

I'm not fond of green olives.  We sometimes stuff the celery with peanut butter or pimento cheese spread.  I do like cream cheese with chopped nuts in celery.
