Too bad there are not ten stars here. This recipe certainly deserves it! I baked my first ham today for a family gathering. After combing this site for recipes, I chose this one. And am I ever glad I did! My friends whom I consulted on baking my ham kept telling me to use coke instead of beer. I'm glad I didn't listen! This was one of the most delicious hams I have ever tasted. My husband, who does not really care for ham, couldn't keep from eating it while he was slicing it. He said it was "awesome"! You absolutely can't beat how simple this recipe is. Tender, moist and juicy. I can't wait to do this again! Thanks for the great recipe!

This moist and tender ham could not be easier! I used a large, turkey-size oven bag, two bottles of Yuengling, and almost a full can of pineapple slices. Everyone remarked that they'd never eaten such a moist ham. After slicing it, I combined about 1/2 C each of honey, butter, and orange juice and added about 1 tsp. cinnamon, brought to a boil, and poured over the sliced ham. I reheated gently, and it did ont dry out at all. Delicious! I will use this method again!

I made this w/ a spiral ham, and it was DELICIOUS! I've never had such a tender, juicy ham. I used Alaskan Smoked Porter, which was a perfect compliment. I also used a glaze (I wasn't completely convinced that just the beer & pineapple give enough flavor) of 1 cup honey, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup of pineapple juice, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. I brushed on the mixture every 15-20 minutes, and removed the cover at the end to carmelize the glaze. The drippings even made a delicious gravy! Everyone loved it... from now on, I will always cook my ham in beer.

This was EXCELLENT...I halved the recipe and inserted cloves into the ham before baking.  I cooked it at 300 for about 4 hours....it was so tender and was literally falling apart...I used a 9.5 lb ham...HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

I normally don't really care for ham, but this was awesome!  I used a 7.27 lb. brown sugar cured bone-in ham.  Dumped 1 can of beer on it put on an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings and dumped that juice on it too.  I baked it for about 2 1/2 hours (I turned to oven up to 350 for the last 1/2 hour).  I basted it about 5 times while cooking and let it rest for about 15 minutes before carving.  This is by far the best ham I ever made and have probably ever tasted!  I was so moist and tender.  I can't wait to make it again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I cooked this ham for twelve people for a christmas/engagement dinner.  I had never had such a reaction to one of my meals...RAVE REVIEWS! I made a ten lb. ham with three cans of micro beer and added potatoes, celery, and onions to cook (and serve on the side) in the beer/ pineapple juice.  I am going to make this recipe every time i make a ham! MUST TRY!

Great taste and very moist.

I made a half ham and embellished as follows:
Used 1 can chunk pineapple instead of slices.  Put about 1/3 of can juice plus 6-7 chunks in the basting liquid.
Heated the ham to internal temp of 140°F (Removed from oven at about 130°)
Broiled the rest of the chunks to brown them slightly.

Made a sauce of:
- Rest of pinapple juice
- 1/4 c brown sugar
- 1/8 c honey
- 1/4 t cloves, 1/8 t allspice, 1/8 t nutmeg
- Thickened with arrowroot to keep it clear
When this was thick I added the broiled pinapple and the chunks from the baste.  (I did not use any of the baste liquid).  This was a great ham sauce.

I used a pre-cooked ham and 1 can of pineapple juice and 1 can of beer. Cover it and cook approx. 1 hr. My diabetic father-in-law loved it. It seems to remove the salty taste and the ham is SO moist. Everyone loved it. I then take the pineapple slices and saute them in butter and brown sugar and use them to decorate the platter. This has become a huge hit in our family- even with those who previously didn't like ham! This is now our favourite recipe for company and they rave about it.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was one of the best hams I ever had!  The only thing I did differently was baste it a few times with the leftover pineapple juice.  So simple, and so good!

Excellent!!  I was a little reluctant to put pineapples, and being the doe-doe that I am, I bought crushed pinapple instead of sliced, but I'm glad I did, they worked out just as well because I basted every so often.  I used Sam Adams Summer Ale (yum) put it on the grill and it came out great.  Family loved it, thanks Lisa!

We're trying to cut down on our sugar so this was a great find!  I had an 8 lb pre-cooked spiral sliced ham.  I followed the recipe using 1 bottle of lager beer.  It cooked for 2 hours, covered with foil.  The whole family loved it and had seconds and thirds!

20lb ham.  I may have overcooked a little but it ended up being about 5 hours.  I cooked in a turkey bag coated bag with 1 T flour (to prevent bursting) and poured 2 bottles of honey weiss beer.  The ham was sooooo good.  Next time I'll check thermometer more often to prevent over-cooking.

I didn't have a 10lb ham so here's what you should do instead:  -1 can of beer, not 2. You'll have too much juice from the ham and beer -DON'T add in the pineapple juice and rings if you want to be able to make gravy, it will be too sweet -If you want to cook this over night set the oven at 250 degrees for 7 hours -After that, if you want a glaze, take out the juice for the gravy, brush on a glaze of your choice, turn oven higher to 350 and cook for 10-15 minutes.   You'll have an AWESOME ham. Great recipe.  -Also DO NOT use aluminum foil to cover your ham. The salt in the ham will corrode the aluminum while it cooks, though you can still eat it safely, it's just a pain to deal with.

I can't believe how good this was. I was looking for something different other than the traditional brown sugar type ham. I used a small bone-in smoked ham but made it in the crockpot (I am always looking for new ways to use it). I used an apricot beer I had but also used apple cider from another recipe on this site. I put the ham cut side down in the crockpot after trimming off the fat, poured in one beer (only had one beer, but had a gallon of cider), then filled almost to the top with apple cider. I then poured a large can of crushed pineapple over the portion sticking out patting the pineapple on to stick and letting the rest, along with the juice, to fall into the liquid. I cooked on high for the first hour then changed to low for about 6 hours. The ham was very tender and the combination of apricot, apple and pineapple flavoring was so good that I'm glad I didn't add any other seasoning. My company loved it and even the kids came back for seconds. I will definitely be making this again. I've told all my friends about this and they now want to make it too.

everyone said it was the best ham they'd ever had. I've never seen a ham so juicy, when you went to cut it, juice ran out of it. Crazy good! Also, it didn't taste like beer. I used one can crushed pineapple and one bottle imperial pale ale for a 10 lb 1/2 precooked Meijer ham. Baked 4 hours, first 1 hr at 325, then two at 250 and one at 325 to finish heating it up.

I had a precooked spiral cut ham and tried this. I used a rack underneath the ham and poured 2 cans beer in the pan. Put aluminum foil over all and crimped the aluminum foil to the edges of the pan. I only cooked it for 4 hours and the ham was dry and overcooked.

Loved this.  I am NOT a ham fan, but since the rest of the family is, I made an 11-lb ham in my roaster using a can of beer (I think it was Coors Light) and a can of chunk pineapple.  Ours was ready in about 3 hours and was so tender it was pointless trying to cut it into "nice" pieces.  :)  I didn't notice a beer flavor at all, and I'm not a huge fan of beer.

I too am not a huge fan of super-sweet glazed hams: This recipe makes the most moist, juicy ham I've been able to turn out in my kitchen! I just used High Life (Milwaukee girl here), the two cans as specified with a can of pineapple on a 12 pound ham, and will not change one thing. I did cook at 250 for 9 hours to fit my schedule, basting a couple times and browning the skin at 350 for half an hour at the end, and thought that worked just fine too. Thank you SO MUCH for sharing, my boyfriend was in heaven :) ADDED 12/23/09 NOTE: I've made this several times now, always amazing but this time put in a slow cooker: even with just 1 can of beer we found this method of cooking imparted a much stronger beer flavor throughout the meat. I will actually only make this awesome recipe in the oven as stated, and use a different recipe when I need to slow cook the meat.

Okay, I had a 7.5 lb spiral cut, bone-in half ham, (harwood smoked, fully cooked). I utilized fresh pineapple (was on sale). Due to weight difference from recipe; used 1 bottle of Honey wheat beer. Toothpicked on pineapple rings, poured beer (and juice from cutting pineapple) over all. Covered w/HD foil (roaster lid wouldn't fit) and baked at 300 for 3 hours. I lightly sprinkled some of the packet of brn sugar glaze on top (that came w/ham) after 2nd hour but I won't do that again (pineapple adds enough sweetness). I like a little sweet but not overbearing. When I had to turn oven up to 350 for rolls, I uncovered ham, removed pineapple (and 4 cups of excess liquid!), basted ham and baked additional 15 minutes to carmelize a bit. Once out of oven - I let ham sit for 15 minutes (loosely covered) while rolls baked off. Sliced enough ham (for dinner of 4) and it was EXCELLENT. Didn't taste or smell like beer, was moist/tender & not salty at all. I may have gotten all the excess liquid due to type of Ham or baking tightly covered? Thankfully it didn't negatively effect end results but next time I'll loosely cover, baste every 30 mins & bake 15 min per lb @325. I think the addition of beer kept ham very moist. If you end up with dry ham, most likely it got overcooked.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I had never cooked a ham before so this was my first try. I was really intimidated by such a big peice of meat! I am not a huge fan of glazed hams so I was looking for something more subtle. My ham was big, probably 12 pounds, it took about 7 hours to reach the desired temp. I just plopped it in my large cast iron skillet & made a foil tent. Because my ham was bone in with *LOTS* of fat, my ham turned out super juicy and tender! No beer taste whatsoever. I made it for sandwiches for a fishing trip for the weekend but as soon as it came out of the oven we kept picking at it. I served my hot ham & swiss sandwiches on good french bread with Southern Potato Salad from AR. Perfect! I will use this recipe again for sure!

Absolutely wonderful!  My husband isn't a big fan of ham and he insisted that I make this at least once a month.  The ham was so tender and flavourful.  The leftovers were fantastic and tender too, even after reheat.

It tasted great. Surprising that it didnt have much beer taste at all. Love it. I also added a touch of honey, orange juice and some spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.

I used this recipe for Christmas and it was a big hit. I did not have sliced pineapple,all I had was crushed so I made slits in the ham and put some of the crushed with juice in the cuts. It was great. Thanks,

Very good ham!!  The house smelled a bit like there was bread baking due to the beer - this is a good thing!  I baked a 9 lb ham in 1.5 bottles of Leinenkugel Honey Weiss in a roasting bag for 3 hours and it was perfect.  My husband shuddered when I mentioned making ham since he's not a fan of the glazed hams I've made in the past and he LOVED this.  I will be making ham more often now that I have this recipe.

Granted, I probably should not have used an already cooked ham, but the taste of the beer plus the pineapple was not to my liking. I would rather just have a regular ham boiled in water or a brown sugar baked ham. I thought something different would be good but just smelling the pineapple and beer together made me queasy.  Sorry, it's not for us.

I had 30 people coming for Ham dinner following Confirmation worship.  I didn't know how long the service would be and feared dry meat.  I searched the web and found this recipe.  FABULOUS!  Everyone went back for more.  The ham was moist and flavorful.  It's a new favorite!

I do cook with beer, but never thought of cooking ham with it. Well, this was the best Christmas ham I ever made! (I did omit the pineapple) I like the ease of a spiral ham, but it can get dry if your not careful. The beer made it incredibly moist. My family raved about how good it was.

EXCELLENT!!! This is the best Ham that I have ever made, (and better that most I have tasted).  It was  so tasty & so tender.  Will be making again.  Loved freezing and having it days later.

I tried the beer glazed ham, but with a 12.6 lb bone-in ham.  I made the glaze by reducing 2 bottles of homemade porter with a little brown sugar and a little honey, plus about 3 T. plum butter (plum preserves).  I just simmered the glaze while the ham baked (aerobake) at 320 degrees F. (since I wanted to boil off the alcohol so I could use the remaining glaze as a sauce).  I added some water to the pan (kept ham above the pan, on a rack) and glazed every half hour, baking the ham for about 3 hours (internal probe read 155 degrees F).  The glaze blackened nicely, and the ham was juicy and tender.  Lovely.  I will be making this one again.

Easy to prepare and toss in the oven for a crowd.  I was then able to focus on other dishes and visiting.  Turns out moist and doesn't taste like beer.  I did make sure to baste, which I would recommend so it doesn't dry out.  My ham was already fully cooked when I picked it up from the butcher, so I also lowered the temperature to around 250 degrees rather than 350 and cooked for only about 4hrs.

My mom's secret to the best turkey and gravy ever was a can of beer. So I thought I'd give this a try, and it was pretty darn good. I used Black Butte Porter, and skipped the pineapple because my daughter is allergic. The kids asked for seconds with lots of pan drippings on top... Thanks!

Used this for my first ever ham and it turned out to be wonderfully succulent.  I did, like another reviewer, make a honey glaze that I added during the last 45 minutes of cooking.  Thanks!

This was a good recipe but I couldn't taste the  beer or the sweetness from the pineapple. I used a 6.5lb ham and left it in the oven for almost 3 hours. Way too long, the internal temperature was a lot higher than what it should be, which resulted in the ham being a bit dry. Next time I will baste it every 30 minutes and use a meat thermometer so I can take it out when it's at 160-170 degrees.

This ham was absolutely scruptious!  I work in an assisted living facility, and prepared this ham for our annual holiday potluck.
EVERYONE raved about it, and many are still asking me for the recipe.  This makes a very tender, tasty ham.  I will never make a ham without beer again!

@jhp - Definitely not fair to evaluate this recipe for a spiral cut. That's not what this was intended to cook. I find that spiral cut ham is practically designed to be dry - a very different method is required.

This was simple, delicious, and well-timed.

This was great!  I used a 13.25 half shank bone-in ham.  I used a roasting bag as well.  I embellished by rubbing honey mustard on the outside of the ham.  I used a 20 ounce can of pineapple rings, one bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale, diced up 5 red potatoes and 2 onions, placed all of it in the roasting bag and baked at 325 degrees for 3 hours!  Literally fell off the bone. Delish!!!!!

This was great I used an internal meat themometer and it was juicy the next 4 days. Loved it and no beer taste. Whole family and inlaws loved it! I did use a 11 lbs ham and one can of beer.

I didn't make this necessarily as per the recipe, but as a base although my creation came out superb! I used a 6lb. (3kg-ish) boneless toupee-style ham (otherwise known as a spiral ham I believe; it's smoked) so I only needed to cook this at most for 3.5 hours. I lined a roasting pan (with lid) with aluminum foil (I seriously rec'd a disposable pan though). I lay this cut-side down (non-rind side). I made a paste with my homemade bbq/meat seasoning, Dijon mustard and pure grade b (medium) maple syrup. I poured a can of Dr. Pepper and a can of some sort of honey beer over it. Covered (though not completely as the the ham was a little too high to 'seal' the roaster) and let it cook at 325F for 3 hours. As some of the heat/liquid escaped, this allowed the 'sauce' to thicken. Last half hour removed the lid then when done let it rest, while brushing it with the remaining concentrated liquid. Removed netting/plastic-y thingy then cut to serve. This is delicious, not too sweet or too savoury- the right balance of the two. This will be our ham recipe from now on!

This recipe was so easy and turned out great!  I made a few alterations and it turned out great.  I used only a 10 lb ham and cooked it for only 4 hours.  I used a honey based beer and also some cherry juice to baste the ham.  Then we used the leftovers to make a delicious and not too salty gravy to go with the meal!  It was an amazing dish!

I had originally given this recipe only 4 stars when I used it last year, but had to go ahead and boost it up to 5 stars after having made some changes.

First of all, I only had an 8.5 lb ham, and it was spiral cut and smoked. I put the ham AND its juices into a roasting pan.
I used a pint of Guiness and poured that over the ham along with a can of chunk pineapples. I stuck some of the chunks into the ham with toothpicks, covered tightly with foil, and baked at 375 for 2 hours basting every 20 minutes. After 2 hours, I lightly brushed on a packaged glaze, and put the ham back intothe oven uncovered for another 20 minutes. 
I let the ham rest for about 10 minutes before slicing, and it was juicy juicy juicy and delicious!!
The guiness gave a nice, rich taste!

I liked this cooking method. It seemed very moist and tasty. The beer flavor was not noticeable (I used what I had - Hefeweizen). I would recommend not eating the pineapple though. Beer soaked pineapple = not good.

Baking my ham with this recipe for the 2nd time.  Extremely easy, with great reviews!!  We like the old fashioned bone-in hams (approx 25-28 lbs).  We love the taste of ham without the sugary glazes.  Thanks for the posting.

This was our 2005 Christmas Ham recipe.  Awesome!!  Don't really understand why the pineapple rings were attached--except it did make for pretty decoration.  Might try studding with cloves next time.

This made the most flavorful ham I've ever had.  I used the suggestion of a honey/brown sugar glaze and carmelized it at the end.  The ham was so tender it just fell apart.  My family wants me to make it again :)

Quite tasty, though if I make it again, I will use a premium beer.  I added some brown sugar to the top of the ham near the end of its baking time and I'm glad I did.  Also basted about every 1/2 hour.  Carrots and potatoes baked with the ham turned out good.  My husband had seconds and said it was "great".  Leftovers tasted good and were good in casseroles.

I prepared this Ham for a holiday potluck and got huge raves from all our guests.  They were amazed when I told them it was cooked with beer.  The meat was tender, falling off the bone, and very tasty.  I plan to prepare this Ham for my family this Christmas.

This is a good recipe, we made it tonight. My ham was only 10.5lbs. so my cooking time was less. I roasted at 275 for 4hrs. Basting with the pan liquid every hour. Hot, juicy and tender! It was delicious and loved by all.

Like other users I used the pineapple juice from the can as well as 11oz of beer. The only hint of beer flavor you'd get was from the cut side pieces. We used a ginger-honey-wheat hefewiezen and it paired well. 

Would definitely recommend as we'll be making it again for sure.

It was a decent ham, but I'm more looking forward to using the leftovers for salads and sandwiches because it was a little bland as a main course. It definitely needs a mustard sauce or something with it.

This is a difficult recipe for me to rate, as the ham I used was a smoked ham from a boar my husband harvested hunting. The meat from this pig is much drier then the pork you get at the store. This is the first pig he's harvested so I am new at preparing this type meat.) I tried to compensate for this by covering the ham with a glaze I use for all my hams (honey, brown sugar, ground cloves and pineapple juice). The glaze completely covered the ham. I roasted it in a covered roaster just as the recipe said using the beer. I was not sure on the weight of the ham (pkg not marked), so I had to guess on the roasting time. I did use a meat thermometer for internal meat temp. The meat was very dry and chewy. I do not believe it was because the recipe failed, (it provided great flavor)I believe it was because of the cut of meat, so I am giving it 4 stars.

OK, all I could find at the store was an already cooked 4lb boneless ham. I used a quarter of a bottle of beer and a few pinapple slices w/ the juices poured on. I baked the ham, covered, for about 50 minutes @ 325. I uncovered the ham, sprinkled some brown sugar on top and basted the heck out of it. I turned up the heat to 400 and baked for about 20 more minutes, basting a couple more times. The end result was moist and delicious! I can only imagine how this would be if I had actually done it correctly!

As RR would say, this was yum-o. Used a 10 lb hame and baked for 5 hours at a slightly reduced temp, basting occasionally. Ham was falling apart.

I tried this recipe on Christmas, and should have tested it first. The flavor was good, but it was jerky ham, it was so dry and tough. I had 10lb ham, and judging by other posters, I needed to bake it 4 hours. 2 hours into it, it was done and already dry. I basted it several times too.
I might try it again, only maybe try a brown n bag instead, I have good luck with turkeys using a brown n bags.

I made this for Christmas with mixed reviews.  While it was moist, most people did not care for the taste and the gravy from the drippings was not good at all.  I will go back to my old way of baking a ham.  Oh well nothing ventured nothing gained.

As a first time Christmas Dinner host to 15 people and a lover of beer I had to give this recipe a go!  Absolutely without a doubt the most delicious ham ever!  I basted every hour and used Otter Creek Copper Ale (you can find in New England primarily) as it's a robust ale and is perfect to drink while cooking!    Fabulous, I will never forget this Christmas!

I always heard that meats are more tender cooked in beer, but I never thought about using it for ham. Our ham was so tender and just fell apart! Great, easy recipe!

I am a beer drinker, so I thought, OK, beer and ham, what could go wrong.  OMG! This was the BEST ham I have ever had!  I baked the ham in my Mother's  oven baking kettle that has been passed down to me.  The glass lid broke years ago, so I covered the ham with heavy duty aluminum foil.   I put my 7 lb. bone in ham in the pot with a 16 oz can of Budweiser Beer (not my preference, but it was left by a former boyfriend).  I cut up 4 rings of pineapple and put them in with the beer.  Baked at 325 degrees for 3 hours.  I made a baste with the pineapple juice and brown sugar.  Basted every 20 minutes or so.  When I took the ham out of the oven I turned the ham over and let the flat end sit in the juices for 20 minutes, then took it out and put it on a plate.  I could not stop cutting of pieces.  So Good and Super Moist!!  I will definitely share this with friends!

I was going to do a crock pot version of this but it wouldn't fit in (10 lbs bone-in). So I used a stock pot and modified it with whole green beans (frozen) and thick sliced potatoes. I glazed the top of the ham with Hoisen Sauce (about 3 teaspoons) I wanted it to be flavorful and I know potatoes sometimes absorb flavor. Sealed it with aluminum foil, put the lid on that bad boy and voile! (is that the right word?)I had my veggies, starch and meat in one pot. Tender, flavorful, and leftovers will be amazing.

cooked for dinner. only had a 10lb ham. Used the 2 cans of beer I think 1 would have been fine. Everyone liked it, was moist and tender. Will cook again.

I only cooked the ham for about 1 1/2 hours as the ham said maybe could have gone a few minutes longer. but still yummy.

Followed recipe as written and will NEVER cook ham any other way ever again. So easy, so tasty I was sceptical at first but this is by far the easiest and best way to cook a ham I have ever used.

This was a very good and moist ham.  I did use an oven bag so I didn't have to scrub my pan to death.  Everyone who ate it was very surprised that I cooked it with beer and it tasted so great.  I did use a pumpkin beer since  I thought the spices would go with it and it was a hit.

This was an amazingly simple and tasty recipe! I will do this with every ham I make. The only thing I didn't do was add the pineapple because my family doesn't like that extra bit of sweetness, but it still turned out amazing. I cooked an 11 lb ham, cooked it for four hours and basted it every hour.

This is the driest ham I have even eaten.  The flavor was good and I have some black-eyed peas soaking in it right now for tomorrow night's dinner.  I shall not make ham using this method again though.

I can not believe how good this turned out! After reading several reviews of “adjustments,” we opted to not make any and make it as is. We used a 13lb bone in ham, one can of pineapple rings, and dumped the juice on top, and 2 bottles of Sierra Nevada Winter Warmer Lager. We basted it twice during 4 hours of cooking. It was an absolute hit! Melt in your mouth ham, from a non-ham loving family.

I didn't have pineapple rings so I just put chunks over the top and in the pan.  I poked the ham all over with a big fork and poured the beer and juice over the ham.,  I covered with foil and basted it 4 or 5 times during cooking.

It was wonderfully moist and tasty.  Everyone voted thumbs up for this one,

my mother has baked ham using beer and pineapple juice for over 40 years.   The best way to bake it!   DO NOT try it on a spiral sliced ham-will not work the same.   We also score the ham before baking and push whole cloves at the corners.

I'm really glad I tried this very easy, very simple recipe!  It puts a really different twist on ham.  It turned out really really unique is the best way I can put it.  The meat pulled back from the bone and was separating at the fat seams which was fine.  It was really tender, but not mushy which is great.  The strangest part is that the texture of the meat reminded me most like corned beef!  There was no taste of beer (yay!)  It wasn't juicy, but wasn't dry either(I'll cut the time down next time). 

I struggle with saying this made a great ham because it turned out nothing like you would expect ham to be. Never the less, whatever it turned out to be is GREAT!

I always read through the reviews before I try anything, so I opted for diced Gala apples instead of the pineapple and only used one can of Coors light (it's what I had) for a 12 lb. half shank ham.  I baked it in a dark deep roaster with a stream-tight foil tent at 325°/15 min per lb. (per ham directions) basted with pan juices at the 1hr mark only. 

You should really try this, but do so before a presentation to guests so you'll know what you're getting.

This is a great recipe. After trying it as written, we changed it up a little. We used dry cider (Hatchet, Scrumpy's, Blackthorn, Original Sin, the original English version of Strongbow-don't use the malty US version, anything with low sugar content and no malt) and chopped apples instead of pineapple. We cooked it in a slow cooker rather than the oven on both occasions. It was amazing.

Over here, across the state line in MN, I wouldn't have guessed that cooking a bone-in ham in beer would be either a particularly good, or bad, idea.  Personally, I would've gone with neutral, at best.  I was wrong.  I used two cans of beer and a can of mandarin oranges because I didn't have any canned pineapple.  That had to be the least dry ham I've ever made!  And I didn't go crazy basting it either.  I think I might've basted it 3 times total in the 2 1/2 hours it was in the 250° oven.  (9lb. spiral cut ham from Aldi)  Thanks LBMQH!
