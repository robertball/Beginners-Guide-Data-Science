Very good but I added pickling spices instead of just celery seed and turmeric. Liked it better .  I use this to make my tartar sauce. My family likes better than bought tartar sauce.  Gloria

Amazing flavor.  Just the right amount of sour and sweetness.  We added just a little bit more of colored peppers (had a half of one from other recipe from Allrecipes.  I'm loving this recipe source.

I cut this down by A LOT! I used only peppers instead of zucchini mix and I left out the ground turmeric. My whole family loves it!

I doubled the amount of sweet peppers and used all red for a zippy colour. I also doubled the recipe and it made 27 half-pints. Good thing I have a super gigantic canner and had extra lids and rings on hand. This tastes just like the relish my mom used to make in 1965. Quite sweet with a nice tangy finish. Delish with salty meats and I even tried it with tamari-marinated tofu fried in olive oil. Bliss...

Used the basic recipe with small alterations. Added a couple of apples and tomatoes that were getting close to use by date and swapped tumeric for curry powder and added some chilli powder for oomph.  I prefer smooth relish, so I use my stick blender to break down the lumps after 20 minutes of simmering. Tip: Wash  and rinse jars and place in oven at 100 deg C for minimum 15 minutes. Bottle straight to jars as you remove them from the oven.
