Thought they were pretty easy to make, although the crust could have used more oomph.  My husband couldn't get enough.
Made two batches over Thanksgiving weekend and we ended up having dessert one evening with slightly sweetened whipped cream.  We just dipped them in and yum!

Wonderful, light, flakey crust. The chocolate flavor gives these cookies their special compliment to the cream cheese crust.

Not really worth the trouble they took to make.

Tedious to make. Filling was like a dry, bland brownie. Bummer. Crust was ok & I might try it w/a different filling--lemon maybe.

These are DELICIOUS! I added extra cream cheese frosting (obviously w/ a little red, white, and blue food dye for the 4th of July), and, although it made them very rich, it was a fun treat and a surprising hit! Great recipe, ThreeDogKitchen.

I made them without the confectioners sugar and the inside turned out very bland. I just tasted the cocoa and crunch. The shell was also very dry.

I was surprised by the negative reviews.  Pecan Tassies have been a tradition for decades, since my Step Mom discovered them at her cookie exchange.  Ours have jelly in the bottom, and then the plain pecan topping.  When I couldn't find my recipe card, I was thrilled to find this version.  We loved the chocolate, and I will be happy to add them to my Christmas cookie plates!  They are a bit time consuming, but the result is worth the effort.
