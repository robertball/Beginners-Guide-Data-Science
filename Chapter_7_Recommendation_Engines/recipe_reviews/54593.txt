I only browsed the recipe before actually making it and was surprised at the directions.  I was expecting these to be like mini meatloaves and instead they were similar to Polish Mistakes or Barbecue Beef Cups (also on this website).  It would be less mess and easier to prepare to use refrigerated biscuits instead of the bread.

Has definite promise as a keeper here. A little bland for us -- even with adding some garlic salt instead of salt and some sage to the mix. Probably could add a touch of Worcestershire sauce too. Definitely needs the 1.25 lbs of meat, was a little wet still with only 1.12 lbs. Used brown bread instead of white, but loved how it came out on the bottoms! DH didn't even recognize it as slices of bread at first.

This was easy and fun to make. I used the leanest hamburger I could find and highly recommend doing the same. Yes, it was a little bland but easy to perk up with garlic, worchestershire sauce or BBQ sauce added to the mix before baking. I used both W. sauce and BBQ (made two batches) and both were great. Used sliced garlic sour dough bread. It was good but I think I'll try the biscuit thing next time. DO NOT use a honey wheat type bread. I ran out of the sour dough and had two muffins left so used what was on hand...uch! This is really fun to make with a kid. My 13 year old son helped and we had a great time. Thanks for sharing!

As i read thru the recipe I assumed the grease from the uncooked hamburger would be to much. I cooked the hamburger first then followed the recipe. It turned out great!! a keeper

I made this recipe using half the can of soup and added garlic, savory (for lack of sage), and S&P. It tasted fabulous -- all 5 people loved it, including 3-, 6-, and 11-year old kids. The 11-year-old helped me, we had a great time, and it was quite an accomplishment for him (and for me, being a cook who lacks presentation skills!). FABULOUS recipe! Could the hamburger be pre-cooked to reduce the fat? Even with lean meat (7%), they were a bit on the greasy side.

This recipe is GREAT because it's very customizable. I added Worcestershire sauce, lots of minced garlic, bread crumbs, chopped jalape√±os and thyme to the meat mixture. I also sprinkled garlic powder over the slices of bread before putting them in the tin. I didn't find it bland at all. It came out of the muffin pan perfectly and intact. It's perfect with hot sauce. Next time I'll try adding bacon!

I haven't made this yet but I'm excited to with my own meatloaf recipe. Nice change, sounds like I can take one to work for lunch with the leftovers. DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE COMPLAIN OF THE TASTE. Meatloaf is a recipe that we all alter to taste.So make your own and try it in the muffin pan, I am next time!!!!

What a great new recipe for hamburger. I used a 1/2 piece of bread and used 3/4 tsp. of garlic powder and 1 tsp. on A-1.

My husband and I really enjoyed these.  I used brown bread, and found that microwaving the bread for 10 seconds helped mold the bread to the muffin tin.

I made this before looking at the reviews.  It turned out ok.  It did lack a bit of taste and it was a little bit messy.  I think I will try again and spice it up a bit.  Thanks for posting.

I tweaked this recipe and made two separate batches. I used tomato soup instead of Mushroom, cooked the hamburger prior to baking (this way the biscuit/bread won't get soggy from the hamburger grease) with minced garlic instead of onion ( my kids don't like onions). Also added plenty of Italian seasoning, garlic salt, and pepper. One batch I used large biscuits and the other I used Texas toast. Both were excellent, but I have to say I preferred the Texas toast. I got rave reviews from everyone, including my 5,10, and 12 year old who helped me prepare the meal. This will be a permanent part of our family meals, I will recommend this to everyone!

I am giving this a four out of five only because my husband thought they were great. I thought they were too soggy in the end weren't appetixzing to me. I made them exactly as the recipe was written. I did need more butter for the bread but maybe one extra tablespoon

I'm glad I read the reviews before I made this. I decided to use cornbread instead of regular white bread and laid them out on a regular baking pan. I also used tomato soup instead of mushroom - and reduced the amount by just a tad. In addition to the onions, salt and pepper, I added about 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder. I was able to mold the beef into tiny meatloafs and place them on top of the cornbread, reducing the messiness. I added extra sharp cheddar at the last minute, just enough to melt it on top.

The result was a wonderfully easy to make meal just bursting with flavor. The contrast of the meat and cornbread was wonderful - and although they weren't exactly "muffins" all credit goes to this great recipe!

Delicious recipe. I used shredded parmesan cheese and velveta american slices on top instead of the cheddar cheese! Even my 2 yr old loved them! Also, great if you are on a budget.

Very delicious! I used 1/4in thick slices of a Asiago Garlic bread loaf from the New French Bakery and it was buttery and crisp and worked perfectly with the beef flavors.  I used 93% lean ground beef and the egg and 1/2 a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I used onion powder, garlic powder, salt, worcestire sauce and ground pepper.  I sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese on top and baked at 350 for 25 minutes on the bottom rack.  I think the key would be to make sure your oven is preheated, you bake on the bottom rack and your meat is lean (all these things in combination would help to combat sogginess).  Perhaps if your meat is not lean it would work to stir in some breadcrumbs or crushed crackers or oatmeal (traditional meat loaf fillers) to help with the greasiness?  All in all a great base recipe and a fun addition to my recipe base!

This recipe is really good, my husband loves meatloaf and I really don't care for it but this was really good and different. Instead of cream of mushroom soup I used a can of diced tomatoes to make it a little bit healther.

FANTASTIC!  I have made them several times since I discovered it. You might want to slowly add the mushroom soup mix to the ground beef as you mix it so it doesn't get too runny. If the mixture isn't right, the bread will get soggy.

I made a separate gravy to mix in with the cream of mushroom soup.  Brown gravy mix, beef bullion, onion ,garlic salt.  I browned and seasoned the meat first THEN added it all together.  I always make a side batch w/ onions , tomatoes and peppers in the meat mix with these hamburger muffins for the husband.  Cheddar cheese on top of all and bake for 20 mins.  YUMMY :) OH and used crescent rolls instead of bread!

My family LOVED this recipe.  We did use the canned biscuit idea instead of the loaf bread.  I feel that the grease would make the loaf bread a soppy mess, but boy oh boy did they love the recipe with the canned biscuits as the muffin.

So fun to make :)
I butter the bread on one side and microwaved it, made it easier to fit in the muffin pan.  I pre-cooked the hamburger with season salt, pepper and minced onion.  I then mixed it all in a bowl and scooped it in that way-adding sharp cheddar to the top!  For my Husbands batch I added corn, crushed red pepper and green peppers :)  Yummy!

I just made this for dinner & no one was impressed.  I used my regular meatloaf recipe instead of following this one because my family loves my meatloaf.  The bread ruined it.  Everybody picked the bread off after the first few bites.  The bottom part of the bread was soggy & mushy.  The top part of the bread that stuck out over the tops of the muffing tins was to crunchy, almost burned in some spots.  I won't be using bread anymore.  If I try anything like this again, I might try using canned biscuits, like some other reviewers.  My 11 year old daughter suggested using  cornbread, one of her favorite things.  I might see if I can figure a way to do that.

Not bad, but I did alter the recipe a bit.  I didn't have any eggs so I omitted that.  I used about 2lbs of beef instead of 1 1/4lbs, 2T of dried minced onion instead of fresh, and 1 1/2C of shredded cheddar mixed into the beef mixture instead of 3/4C sprinkled on top.  I also added 1T of worcestershire sauce to the beef mixture and a glaze made of 1/2C of ketchup and 1/3C of brown sugar on top of the "muffins."  I really stuffed the muffin cups so I had to bake them a bit longer, almost an hour.  I thought it was ok, kind of like a meatloaf, but the hubby really liked it and even my six year old ate it.  Next time I'll try it with ground turkey(less fat and different flavor) or maybe a bit of bacon mixed in to give it a burger taste.  Not a bad recipe, fun to play with.

These are good for something different. I might make these occasionally but not on a regular basis.  I used onion powder instead of onion.  I was out of cream of mushroom soup so I used a can of golden mushroom that I had.  My bread did not turn out soggy, but I did use very low fat meat to help cut down on the grease.

This has potential.  The bread was rather soggy, so I do not think that is necessary.  Mushroom soup adds a nice start but would probably add some more kick next time.

I used cooking spray instead of butter and healthy recipe fat/sodium reduced soup, wheat bread.
This came out pretty wet, if I made it again, I would only use half the can of soup and definitely lots of garlic and other spices.

I liked it, but more telling was the fact that, of 32 muffins, 27 were eaten by my husband, children, and several of their teenage friends.  One of them yelled up from the basement, "How many of these can we eat?"  In other words, they were a hit!

It's different . I kinda messed up the first batch I was shy with the meat. Also, I wished I waited to add the cheese. The bottom of the first batch was soggy, I use silicone muffin pan . The second batch I didn't butter my bread.  I added more meat. I added spinach and shredded cheese towards the end and it was better.

Instead of cream of mushroom, added about half a can of cream of celery, bbq sauce, ketchup, and garlic powder.  Next time I'll also use onion powder.  I'm not of a fan of onion, so did not add onion to it, like the recipe called for.  It is a good idea (like my boyfriend suggested, as he has made them before) to add the ingredients a little at a time to try to avoid the muffins from getting soggy.  I also cooked them for about 35 minutes, but the bread got a little toastier than I would have liked.  Next time I'll cook them for about 32 minutes.  My daughter loved them and so did my neighbor.  I loved them as well.  They are fun and easy to make. :)

These were pretty good, but it seemed like there was something missing.  I followed the recipe except subbed biscuits for bread and added some garlic powder.  I think that some ketchup would have been a nice addition.

Awesome, recipe. So this is for the gluten free kids/people. I layered the muffin pan started with sweet potatoes, then spinach, the burger and topped with cheese. I put chopped onion and spinach and mixed it in with the ground beef. Cooked for 20 minutes or so. Enjoy

Husband really liked it and has requested it again.  I only made two changes: I used whole wheat bread instead of white and I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. That's because that is what I had on hand. Turned out pretty good. Next time I make it I will use a low carb pita bread to cut down on the carbs.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good.  I like a little more flavor in my recipes, so I tried it again with just a pinch of oregano and about 1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder.  It was fantastic.

I switched it up and did ketchup with sage chili powder garlic and onion powder. Turned out amazing! My 4 year old ate it up and I had seconds.

I did tweak this recipe. I used half slices of bread. I also added garlic, diced green peppers, & panko bread crumbs to the mix. Next time I will add Worcestershire or allegro for additional flavoring. Definitely a keeper for us.

So yummy!  Second time making this and it's a hit with our family.  Easy and fun for the kids to help with buttering the bread and mixing the meat mixture with their hands.  Added some worcestershire sauce and used wheat bread.

I made this recipe last night and it was outstanding. The things I added was I made the meat  like I would meatloaf and used taco seasoned cheddar cheese instead. Also I topped the meat with pieces of bread.

I really liked these. They are good to make when you are getting bored of the same old dinner or don't have much in your kitchen. I did add garlic powder and a meatloaf mix to mine for more flavor because of the other reviews. Super quick to make which is a plus. I will definitely make these again!

Really good.  Did cook the hamburger ahead of time (2 lbs of 93% lean) with the onion, and added bbq sauce, garlic and Worcestershire sauce like reviewers suggested.  Added more bbq sauce to taste before eating.  I'll fix this again....Thanks for the tips, too!!

This was pretty good and my kid had fun helping me make them. I used 90% beef so I had no problems with grease.  I used cooper cheese since I'm not a fan of cheddar and they were so creamy and buttery from the bread.  I'll make them again when her friends come over!

These were really good!  I was having a Valentine's dinner and had a package of  ground beef I needed to use up.  To satisfy both these needs I was looking for a recipe that would qualify as a great party food with ground beef and this was it!  I'm so glad I tried it!  It was a little bland for my liking, but exactly what I was looking for.  It completely saved the day!  thank you so much for sharing!!!  I look forward to making this again :D

Excellent flavor!  I added my own favorite seasoning (Cavender's Greek Seasoning).  The bread was a bit "soggy"; will brown burger, drain and continue with recipe assembly as dictated next time!

I used wholemeal bread instead of white cos that was what I had in hand. The corners of my bread burnt, but aside that, it was good. My nieces thought it was too bland, asked me to do other fillings for next time.

I altered this recipe quite a bit...instead of bread slices, I used pilsbury biscuits from a canister, and for the filling I used browned sausage, cream cheese, chopped/, sauteed scallions and garlic, and topped with the shredded cheddar.  bake 14 minutes, and instant hit with the family!!

This recipe sounded like it would be really good.  But it wasn't- the meat never cooked even though I kept it in the oven for another 1/2 hour. Had to throw the whole thing away.

Excellent recipe.  I made them ahead of time and kept them warm in the oven and they were perfect for when my husband got home.  He is picky and quite enjoyed them.  I then froze to keep for his lunches- great!!  I did add so extra spices to jazz them up a bit- worked great. Thanks

This is a great recipe! The kids love it and it is easy to make. It is great finger food according to the kids and that is important when it comes to eating. I have only made it with 1lb of ground beef and found that it makes them full without over filling.
