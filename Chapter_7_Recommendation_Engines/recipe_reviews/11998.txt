FIrst time I made this it was very bland and didn't have too much sauce to cover the pasta. Second time it was amazing, I made a few revisions. I used marinated artichoke hearts (this is VERY important if you want good flavor) and cooked the garlic and onion in a mix of olive oil and some of the marinade from the artichokes. No butter, didn't need it. I added a six ounce can of tomato paste so there was a good amount of sauce and I used a full cup of feta. I added half the feta when the recipe calls for it, then right before serving I sprinkled the other half on top, covered the pan and let the cheese melt a bit. Second time around the recipe was delicious!

This was so good! The suggestions from other cooks made the recipe perfect! Less pasta is better and using crushed or diced can of tomoatoes instead of a tomato makes it more saucy and less dry. Marinated artichoke hearts and lemon zest added great flavor too. I always use a mixture of olive oil and butter for cooking. A keeper in our recipe box!

My family loved this! They said it tasted like something you might order at The Olive Garden, but even better! The artichokes really add something special to this dish.

This recipe is supposed to serve 4, but the three of us all had two helpings, and there was enough leftover for at least two more.

I made a few changes to the recipe, per several other reviews:

1. I used a whole 10 oz container of fresh cherry tomatoes (chopped in half). I don't think anyone else suggested this, but they went very well with this dish. 

2. I went just a little bit heavier on the spices. 

3. I used about 12 ounces of pasta, which is less than the recipe calls for but still plenty.

4.  I flavored the chicken with salt, pepper and oregano and sauteed it in a mixture of olive oil and butter.  REALLY good!

5. I added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream (per the suggestion of SEVERAL other reviews) right at the end so that the dish didn't turn out too dry.  Delicious!  

Just make sure you have some extra feta cheese to crumble on top at the table.

I made this for dinner on Saturday evening. My husband and I enjoyed it. I did use Marinated Artichoke hearts and used some of the marinade when browning the chicken. It was just OK that night. We had A LOT left over, so we ended up eating it again on Sunday afternoon. I decided to make more sauce as I thought the pasta was a little dry. I used some chicken broth, 2 pats of butter and a splash of heavy cream. I then dumped in the left overs....WOW! Totally great that way. When I make this again, I will make a light cream sauce...it coated the pasta and tasted like it came from an expensive italian restaurant. My daughter and husband (and me!!!) loved it!!!!

I guess to start I will rate this recipe after following suggestions from other reviews...DELICIOUS!  I must thank the first person who decided to use marinated artichoke hearts. I think that's the flavor that carries throughout the entire recipe.  I used 12 ounces pasta, 1 cup onions, extra garlic, 16 ounce can diced tomatoes drained, 1 cup feta, extra lemon juice, plus zest.  Be warned that there is a lot of prep because everything goes in at once, but it is worth the effort.

Awesome - agree with other readers: use 1/2 as much pasta; use marinated artichoke hearts; use ~16 oz. diced marinated toms; DO NOT leave out the lemon

I cubed my chicken up & then put it in a big baggie w/ a little olive oil, oregano, a tad bit of lemon juice & some of the marinade from the  jar of marinaded artichoke hearts I used & let it marinade for a couple of hours.  I also added a bit more marinade as well as about 1/4 cup of pinot grigio when I sauteed the chicken. The chicken pieces had lots of flavor & I am glad I made extra to use in another dish. I cut the pasta in half & then still didn't add all the pasta to the mix. I did do as suggested by reviewers & use a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh & I used a 6 oz. can of marinaded artichoke hearts. I only had a half a cup of feta but I wish I had had some more to sprinkle on top. I served this w/ My Own Famous Stuffed Grape Leaves (from this site) as an appetizer & made Greek Honey Cake (also from this site) for dessert. This was pretty good but I don't think the flavor combos suited my hubby & I...not sure if I'll make it again but thanks for letting me try it!

LOVIN THIS PASTA!!!!!!!!  There was a lot of chopping involved but it was so worth it.  I love garlic so I used about double what the recipe calls for, I also fallowed a few other tips from other reviews.  Not as much pasta as called for, use olive oil instead of butter and use twice the amount of fetta adding 1/2 when the recipe calls for it and the other 1/2 on top in the serving dish.  Next time I will use fresh lemon juice and some lemon zest.  I will definately be makeing this time and time again...Rachel

Delicous combination of flavors, but I thought a bit too much penne for the amount of chicken.  I would reduce the  penne by 1/4 to 1/3.

Loved this recipe, I added fresh mushrooms and left out the artichoke hearts because we don't like them. I will definitely make this recipe again. It was fast and easy!!

Absolutely one of my new favorites!  I added kalamata olives and halved the amount of pasta.  The leftovers were even great.  Be sure that you don't over cook the pasta.  I am totally in love with this recipe and will use it a ton.  Thanks so much!

This is really excellent. Like other reviewers, I used olive oil instead of butter and used less pasta. No time to get to the farmer's market for a fresh tomato and saw nice grape tomatoes at the store so I sliced them in half lengthwise and used them. I also added more garlic since I love it and I added capers. Make sure you use artichoke hearts IN WATER. I think, based on their reviews,  others may have used marinated ones. Noting comments that the dish was dry, after getting the chicken pieces started I covered the pan to cook them through without drying them out. I added chicken stock to the water to cook my pasta (I ususally do for chicken pasta dishes to add flavor) and added some of that pasta water to the dish when I added the pasta. It was not dry at all. Very very good and also good reheated for lunch the next day.

The best chicken pasta we've had!  I had to double the recipe so I simmered the chicken strips in chicken broth and white wine with the onion, garlic and lemon juice.  Also added some red pepper flakes.  Towards the end I added marinated artichoke hearts and some sliced mushrooms.  I waited to crumble the cheese in after the pasta and the sauce was combined.  Also added some fresh chopped basil.  My husband said it was the best chicken he'd ever had, including his own great barbequed!

This is very delicious.  Maybe a tiny bit dry though.  I will use a little less pasta next time and more tomatoes.  I was even able to freeze a couple of portions, and they were just as good when we ate them.  I would definitly recommend this dish.

I used some leftover chicken so I skipped the cooking part, and My tomato was moooooshy so I left that out. I eyeballed the spices and used a lot more feta... LOL basically just used this as a jumping off point - but wow what a point! So good. I added the pasta to the pot w/ the sauce/veggies/chicken and then folded in some fresh baby spinach to wilt and add color. Really fresh and yummy tasting, and very pretty. I think with the tomato and the spinach and maybe some orange sweet pepper, and a big loaf of crusty bread, this'd be an ideal "company meal"

I gave this recipe 5 stars with a few changes. Like most of the other reviewers I used about 3/4 of the pasta and also used marinated artichoke hearts. Instead of using the chopped tomatoes I used marinated sun dried tomatoes (they come in a bottle soaked in olive oil.) I used about 8 pieces, finely chopped. This small change gave a HUGE pop of flavor. I also tossed the pasta in a large mixing bowl with a little of the olive oil from the bottle of sun-dried tomatoes (to alleviate any dryness) and then added the rest of the items from the pan. The whole family loved it, even my 6 year old. We'll definitely be making this again!

WE love this - even my mother-in-law asked for the recipe !!!! I like to add a little fresh or frozen copped spinach & extra tomatoes (also worked with canned diced tomatoes - pour off liquid first).

This was excellent!  As another reviewer recommended I used marinated artichokes and sauteed the onions, garlic and chicken in the liquid from the artichokes.  Instead of a fresh tomato, I used 3 canned plum tomatoes along with some of the juice.  I also added a teaspoon of basil and I doubled the lemon juice.  I omitted the feta because I knew it would not go over well with the kids but all in all, everyone loved this dish and my 1 year old and 2 year old even had seconds!!

I used some of the suggestions from the reviews (marinated artichoke hearts, canned tomato, less pasta) and it was pretty good. The only modification I made the second time we tried the recipe was to decrease the lemon juice by about 1/2 Tbsp.  2 Tbsp. lemon juice was too sour for my taste-- I felt like it overwhelmed the rest of the flavors.

I only used half the pasta but kept the rest of ingredient the same, except the tomato amount, which I doubled.  Both my husband and I liked it a lot.  We love artichokes and feta cheese, so any recipe with these two ingredients can't go wrong.  It looks pretty good too (see photo on my page).

What a DELICIOUS dinner.  We are huge fans of feta cheese and it really complimented this dish.  This recipe comes together very quickly and is bursting with flavor.  Thanks Jennifer for sharing a recipe that has already became a favorite.

Wonderful! I used canned tomatoes (the basil, oregano, and garlic kind) instead of fresh tomato. I took the suggestions of other with the marinated artichoke hearts and i added some of the marinade while cooking the garlic and onions like suggested also. The last change i made was i used tomato and basil feta because it sounded good. Great recipe with the changes and i am sure it would have been wonderful without also

With minor modifications, this was the best quick meal I've made.  Substituted:  Pasta- used whole wheat penne. Onion- yellow instead of red (I think the taste would have been too peppery). Tomato- 5 or 6 sliced cherry tomatos. Low-fat feta- made sauce creamer and meal healthier.  Added- 1/2 cup frozen spinach, thawed Added-marinade from jar of marinated artichoke hearts.

Awesome!  Only thing I did differently was used 8oz of penne and added 8oz of chicken stock at the end to give it a little sauce.  I'll will be making this again real soon...thanks for sharing!

This was fabulous! I followed the advice from earlier reviews and used less pasta (about 12 oz.), marinated artichokes (drained) and a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping a fresh one, which cut down on prep time. I also added feta cheese on top. Everyone who tried it loved it and wanted the recipe. It even reheats well the next day for leftovers!

This was one of the best pastas I have ever had.  I changed the recipe just a little.  I added marinated artichokes and cooked the chicken in a small amount of their juice (which I added to the butter, onions and garlic).  I also used drained canned diced tomatoes.  Finally, at the end I added 1/4 cup of heavy cream which made the sauce just perfect. What a great dish!

I've been making this for my family the past few years, we like it because it has such a different taste than our other meals, the lemon and feta are really great!
Changes made: used 12 oz pkg of penne pasta (still has more pasta than other ingredients), cut chicken into small bite-sized pieces (so they mix in with other ingredients better), instead of a tomato I used a can of diced tomatoes, I added 1/2 the feta while mixing, and 1/2 on top before serving, I also added 1/4 cup green olives.

This was very good.  Also, good with shrimp. The only thing I added was a little Greek seasoning while sauteing the chicken.

Wonderful!!  This is flavorful and easy.  A nice, quick mid-week dinner.  Next time I make it, I will use a little more lemon (I used a Meyer lemon and it didn't have the bite I wanted).  Delicious!

Wow. 
This recipe can only get better with thyme/time...sorry about the pun.
From the reviews I read, I used 3/4 of the penne and doubled everything else. The lemon juice as people said really was the key. The more tomatoes the more sauce you'll get. I also drowned the pasta in ice cold water after it was dente so that it would stop cooking and it keeps its chewy factor. 
And you bet sure as taxes I'll be making this again and again.

What a wonderful combination of flavors.  The artichokes and feta chicken combine to make a mouthwatering recipe.  It's quick and with the pasta, makes a wholesome, nourishing meal.  I make it at least once a month!!

This is a great recipe.  I cut back slightly on the pasta and added in extra feta and two cans of artichoke hearts in water.   Super good.  My son ate the leftovers cold, and it was still delicious.  Give it a try.

Wonderful recipe. I did make a few minor additions: I added chopped frozen spinach and a little chicken stock. Next time I will cut the lemon juice down a bit.

Greek Penne & Chicken Haiku: "Not really my taste. But I loved the artichokes. Quick dish to prepare." I had to use dried parsley due to not having fresh on hand, and I chose to serve the feta for sprinkling on top at the table, rather than stir it in (per the preference of those I was dining with.) Otherwise, I was true to the recipe, and well, I suppose it's a matter of taste, b/c the lemon and oregano seemed to overpower this to me; on the other hand, my husband adored it so much that he later devoured the leftovers cold, standing at the fridge.

What a tasty, quick dish! 
We love feta and it pairs well with the chicken. I had everything on hand and additionally threw in 3 big handfuls of baby spinach for more color, flavor and nutrition. Used delicious grape tomatoes from Costco. I will try the marinated artichokes next time since that sounds good, too.
The amount of pasta can be cut back; I bumped up all the ingredients since I had 2# of breasts but I still didn't use all the penne called for.

This recipe was really easy to follow, and the end result was fantastic! I followed the recommendations and used marinated artichokes and diced tomatoes...I also used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store instead of cooking my own...fantastic! It was even better the next day!

Love this dish!  What great flavor! I made it as written but couldn't fit all the pasta in my skillet so just ended up using about 1/2 of it and I didn't have parsley. I love lemon but my husband doesn't so I don't think I'll get to make this very often but I don't feel that much needs to be changed. I would like to try it without the butter next time to see how that changes the flavor. YUM highly recommend this dish

I LOVEd the flavors in this dish, as did my husband, 17, 4 and 2 year old! I did not have the tomatoes, used macaroni noodles and substituted dried parsly but it was still delicious. It was a little dry for me so I added a little buttermilk to make more "sauce". I'm looking forward to making this again, this time adding the tomatoes and using penne.

My teen daughter said I could feed her this "every day for the rest of my life"! I sauted a chopped red pepper with the onion and garlic (to use it up, and I didn't have the artichokes). Next time I will add canned diced tomatoes, as my family said it could use more tomatoes. Also, I substituted chopped fresh basil for the parsley. It was delicious and hearty and fed a family of four with leftovers for lunch the next day.

Just to keep it authentic Greek I substituted the Feta for standard Goat cheese and got rid of the Tomato idea (only in Italy) and substituted a home made goat's milk type maranara sauce. Fabulous. Harriet Green

This dish was good. I added mushrooms because I had to use them up, and it was a good addition. I really enjoyed the artichokes. I also added an extra tbl of lemon juice. I will make this again.

As I read in the reviews this is a great base recipe.  I added about 1/4 cup of kalamata olives and used marinated hearts as well, I finished with some extra virgin olive oil.  My only complaint is that the chicken did not fit, next time I make this I will go with a quick marinate of the chicken, maybe 30 mins in a lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, & oregano before taking it to the skillet.   Again wonderful recipe thanks!

Delicious!  I used shrimp instead of chicken and cut the pasta in half.  I also added 4 cups of chopped fresh spinach and wilted it slightly at the end.  I also increased the tomatoes and lemon juice and added a little lemon zest.

have to add twice as much tomato and feta than it says to.  Also, have to add marinated artichoke hearts.  It makes all the difference.

Very, very good.  The whole family loved it... even my picky eater.  She just finished up the leftovers for lunch and asked me to make it again SOON.  I incorporated several of the other reviewers suggestions: I cut the pasta back to 12 ounces.  I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained)instead of fresh and marinated artichoke hearts instead of regular.  I sauteed the chicken, onion and garlic in a combination of olive oil, some of the marinade from the artichokes and white wine.  I also added fresh mushrooms and spinach.

Yum!  I made this for dinner tonight and it was so good!  I made a few changes based on other reviews: I used Kalamata olives instead of artichokes (don't like artichokes), I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with their liquid instead of chopped tomatoes, and mixed in about 1/2 cup of tomato-basil feta and let it simmer to make a tomato-cream sauce.  I also used about 12 oz. rotini because I like it better than penne and I think it holds sauce better.  I think using the liquid from the canned tomatoes really helped make a sauce with the cheese and made it more to my liking.  I topped the pasta with more crumbled feta to serve.  All in all, it was fantastic and I look forward to eating the leftovers for the next couple days!

Really good.  I'll make it again.  I added 1/2 cup chicken broth to make it a tad saucier and a little more garlic.  Also added more feta on top to serve.

Fantastic! I added olives (i love them) and half the pasta as suggested. I also used marinated artichokes and substitued marinated sundried tomatoes for fresh (6 halves and diced).  This is not a heavy and/or saucy pasta recipe, which makes it perfect for summer or a light (not to mention quick) meal.  This is so unlike anything else I have made and am really pleased that I gave it a go.  Even the 2 year old liked it (granted he only ate the cheese, chicken and pasta).

I really enjoyed this one. The flavors come together really well. I used marinated artichokes and a little extra feta (personal preference). My only complaint is that there was way too much pasta - a 12 ounce poackage would probably be plenty.

Thanks for posting what turned out to be a very forgiving recipe. I forgot to pick up feta cheese so I added  a couple globs of caesar salad dressing instead (I'm a man. Don't judge me).  I also took the advice from several other reviews and diced and added a pint of tomatoes I canned recently. I also added about a 1/4 cup of the artichoke marinate. Finally, I added a dribble of olive oil to the pasta which I didn't mix in to the dish, but served separately. My family was pretty impressed and rewarded me by doing the dishes.

I tried to following other reviews and I also made some changes since I didn't have some of the ingridents. My husband and kids loved the lemony taste to this.  I used marinated hearts and used all of the juice from them to make it more saucy. Instead of using feta cheese I used crumbled blue cheese since that was all I had on hand and instead of using fresh parsley I used parsley flakes.  The flavor to this recipe was exceptional.  Will make it again.

I didn't stray too far from the original. I subed olive oil for the butter, sweet cherry tomatoes (sliced in half) for the large tomato, and used half the amount of pasta. I noticed that some people felt the need to add more liquid. Halving the pasta creates the perfect ratio of fixings to pasta, and is enough to feed four with leftovers.  I forgot to add the salt, and it was still very flavorful, probably due to the feta. I am adding this to my regular rotation. It is easy and tasty. My 2 year old gobbled it up. Thanks!

The only substitutions I had to make were to use sun dried tomatoes and leftover shredded chicken because that's what I had and this was delicious! My husband and 3yr old loved it, too. Considering using sun dried tomatoes again next time and adding the feta at the very last minute before serving.

This recipe is just like Greek Chicken Pasta on this site, except that it has butter instead of olive oil (less healthy), less oregano (less flavor), and it says that it's 4 servings. From a POUND of pasta? There was so little meat that my husband thought it was a vegetarian dish.

I recommend HALVING the pasta for 4 servings or DOUBLING everything else for 8. 

Also, I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh - it's what I had on hand.

SO easy and really tasty.  Used 1 can diced tomatoes instead of the tomato and saved some of the water to help keep pasta from becoming dry. used fresh parsley and oregano.  Next time will add mushrooms and olives.

I recommend using a can of tomatoes (with about half/quarter of the juice based on the amount of tomato you use). Also, double the feta. Perfecto.

I would have rated this five stars except I think 16 ounces is way too much pasta for this recipe. I will definitely make this again with about half as much pasta. The flavor is really good and my family did enjoy it. Also, this is WAY more than four servings as is!

This was great!! I did add about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of the pasta water just to make it a little more saucy. It was really good this way. Then, I had a happy accident. I left the burner on low while I was eating supper and didn't realize it was still heating away ... when I came back out to the kitchen and discovered it, all the liquid had been absorbed and it was amazing!!! So yummy! A definite keeper with that extra liquid and cooking time! Thanks so much!

This was such an easy dish to make and it turned out awesome! I read previous review and used marinated artichoke hearts and used diced tomatoes.  What i also love about the recipe is that I usually have all the ingredients on hand and don't have to run to the store for anything.  Next time i am thinking about adding kalmata olives to the mix or even some sun dried tomatoes.  I will definitely be making this dish again!!

It's good, but you have to use good feta & the recipe seems a bit over-complicated. But overall, a yummy & filling dish.

This has great flavor! I add some extra feta (my favorite part) and make sure the artichoke hearts are marinated. Eat it all up though because it doesn't keep well.

The flavor of this was fantastic!  However, it was a little dry.  I will definitely be making this again, but I might use some half and half at the end to make it a little more saucy.

Outstanding flavor mix in this dish. But yes, as others have said, use about half as much pasta. (I always allow 2 oz. per serving.) And when you get it all mixed together in the last step, if you think it's a little lacking in "sauce," just add some hot pasta water or hot chicken broth. Oh, and I used cherry tomatoes in place of the chopped tomato, since most grocery store tomatoes are so hard and tasteless.

Added black olives. Next time I am going to try green olives stuffed with garlic next time and simply leave out the garlic. Served with a variety of hummus and thin sliced pita bread.

Really good!  I added a bit more spices and marinated artichoke hearts and more feta cheese and a tiny bit of evaporated milk at the end, as the others mentioned.  It was a quick and easy meal.  It would be good with frozen peas or fresh spinace.

I made this for my family and the guys in my family typically like heavy greasy food. But this was a huge hit. The next day we all made our own variations of the leftovers, we tried it cold, some added lettuce and ranch dressing, or just warmed it up. Good a variety of ways. Loved the artichoke hearts in it and next time will probably add just a few more of those or a pinch more parsley.

I thought this was quite good.  I think next time, I will just use olive oil instead of the butter, as others have suggested (I think it would be just as good).  I put in a chopped tomato and about a cup of canned diced tomatoes as well, so it wouldn't be too dry.   I also added some extra feta.  Good recipe!

Loved this!  I did make a few changes, some because of other comments and others because of what I had on hand.  I did use marinated artichokes and marinated the chicken pieces in the oil for about 60 minutes.  I used a can of diced tomatoes (what I had on hand) and as I didn't have any lemon, I added about a cup of Greek olives, halved.  I think they added the zip that I would have missed without the lemon.  I also added extra feta cheese when serving.  My 14 year old had three helpings!

Very bright tasting. I halved it and I still had 4 servings. I  served it with eggplant and some garlic bread. If you left out the chicken it would make a great vegetarian dish.Thanks for posting

This was amazing! I changed a few things, here is what I did:  -Added a little Olive Oil before addding the chicken. -I used almost 2lbs of Campari tomatoes cut up.  -Mushrooms instead of artichokes -More garlic (because we love it) -Tad more feta -Everything else was as stated in the original recipe!  There was a perfect amount of sauce for us!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe very much!  I followed some other reviewers' advice and used marinated artichoke hearts.  I also used the oil from the artichoke hearts and a splash of olive oil (rather than butter) to saute the garlic, onions, and chicken in.  Since it is the middle of winter, I used diced canned tomatoes rather than fresh and got the kind that are seasoned with basil, oregano, and garlic.  It added a nice touch!  To lighten up a tad I used the Ronzoni Smart Taste penne pasta (more fiber!) and reduced fat feta.  This made 5-6 servings for us and also took a little under 45 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe! I will be adding this one in to my rotation!

I'm a budding cook, and of all the recipes I have made so far, this was my boyfriend's favorite.  It had an incredible amount of flavor, and, as mentioned by other reviewers, made enough food for several people.  I did make a few tiny changes...I doubled the amount of garlic used (I love garlic) and sauteed the onions and garlic in olive oil rather than butter.  I also saved some of the feta cheese to sprinkle on top of the dish after it was completed.  All in all, this made for a delicious meal.  I definitely will be making it again in the future.

I Used the Marinated Artichoke hearts, I merinated the chicken in a olive oil and Thousand Island dressing for about 10 hours ( wanted to use Italian but thought this was close enough) teh only other thing I did differently is to make it a little more creamier I made a Butter/flour Roux and then slowely added some cream and milk about a cup waited for that to thicken and then added the feta cheese leaving about 1/4 cup to sprinkle on top. It was amazing.. will make over and over again.

After tweaking the recipe a bit, I got it to a place where it tasted excellent! To make this recipe less dry, I did add a can of diced tomatoes with the juices and also I added some olive oil to the mixture at the end. 
Becuase it was kind of bland, it also helped to add Mr. Dash's Lemon zest spice . It really gave it the extra kick that it needed. I cooked it in with the chicken and added some to the mixture at the end as well. Next time I will add even more.

This meal was very good. I did not use artichokes, but the rest of the ingredients were quite complementary. I would recommend adding a bit more lemon juice, just to jazz up the flavor. BTW, I'm having the leftovers for lunch today!

This is VERY good, and very easy, so I make it often. Several reviews claim this is too dry if you use fresh tomato, but I haven't had that problem. I don't use the measurements here (I almost NEVER measure anything) so I can't guarantee you won't have that problem, but I'd recommend trying more than 1 tomato, and letting them cook down a little to release juices. I wouldn't recommend using canned tomatoes (whatever style) for this dish as it isn't meant to have a tomato SAUCE, and it would likely take away from the aesthetics, flavor, and texture of the dish. Also, the recipe calls for just plain canned artichokes. I always use marinated artichokes, and the marinade certainly creates depth of flavor, but likely helps with moisture as well.

Followed other suggestions to reduce the amount of pasta and that was an excellent recommendation. Also used marinated artichokes, again great advice. Finally, I used tomato paste vice tomato. All of these added greatly to the recipe. This will be a meal we will have in the future.

Very tasty!  We substituted Italian sausage for the chicken for a change of pace and used olive oil instead of butter.  It definitely needed half the pasta and a little more feta and tomato for our personal preferences.  Side note, don't warm too long after adding the feta, ours melted.  But still very nice dish served with a crisp, green caesar salad.  ENJOY!

This was fantastic. As a lover of both Greek food and pasta, I knew it was going to be a hit, and sure enough, I was right. Didn't have artichoke hearts, but sure enough I found some sundried tomatoes in a jar and used those instead of the regular tomatoes, and added in a can of pitted black olives for that extra Greek feel. Try adding a marinade (such as Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic) to the chicken too for a bit of extra flavour!

Excellent recipe!  However, like others have said, it's a little too dry.  Instead of chopping up a tomato, I added a can of petite diced tomato to get extra liquid.  I also added extra garlic and oregano as my family likes dishes extra flavorful.  And, the recipe calls for too much pasta.  I'd recommend 8-12 ounces instead of 16. I used whole wheat penne to make the recipe even healthier.  I liked that the dish has 2 veggies, lean chicken, dairy, and can have a whole grain.  Very healthy! This is a recipe I'll definitely be making again (just with a few modifications).

Nice recipe, but I made a few changes; I used 2 cans of chopped tomatoes instead of just 1 tomato, and olives instead of artichokes.  I was surprised how creamy the sauce turned out with the feta cheese; very yummy!

Very good!  I used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano instead of chopped tomatoes, marinated artichokes, and an extra 1/2 cup feta sprinkled on top when serving.  Yummy!

My husband found this recipe and we made it this evening.  It's pretty good.  We followed a few of the suggestions - we used a can of diced tomatoes plus we still added a chopped tomato.  We also at the last minute added a can of tomato sauce - we needed more sauce.  We also used a Rotini pasta and only used 12 ounces instead of 16 ounces.  It came out pretty good.  We may try some kalamata olives next time along with artichokes that are marinated instead of in water.  All in all though - very good - I used all of the lemon it called for and didn't feel it was too much - I thought it actually gave it nice light flavor for summer.  It's a keeper.  Quick, easy and good!

This was awesome, I got this today by email from allrecipes and I had to try it.  I usually go by the recipe exactly the first time, but decided that I would do what others recommended. I simmered the chicken in Chicken broth (5 minutes both sides) then I did everything else like it said but instead of tomatoes I used chopped tomatoes and one small 8oz can tomato sauce. I used 16oz box of penne and it was perfect for us, plenty of chicken and pasta. I also put Kalamata olives in instead of Artichokes, my hubby doesn't like them.  This came out perfect!! Thanks so much

There wasn't much sauce to go with the pasta in this recipe, so I added some heavy cream (about 1/4 cup) to the skillet after the chicken was cooked. The cream mellows the flavors and gives the dish some body.

This was a very good recipe.  A lot of chopping, but it was worth it.  I suggest that you add an extra tomato or two.  My 2 year old really liked it.

This recipe was delicious with some of the modifications that were suggested by other reviewers.  I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and added 1/2 cup of half and half to the mixture before adding the penne.  It was super easy to make and will become a regular staple in our dinner menus.

This recipe is fine as it stands!  I don't "sauce" it. The fresh tomato is the "sauce" as in many other fresh tomato recipes.  It is a classic way of serving pasta when good tomatoes are in season.  You are only warming the vegetables.  (Certainly feel free to marinate the chicken and/or artichokes if you want, as this still maintains the basic fresh character of the dish.)  While the dish will taste fine with tomato sauce, you will nevertheless lose the unique  "soul" of this recipe.  Remember it is warmed, it is not a saucy hot dish, which makes it appropriate on a hot summer day.

If you find the pasta dry, toss it in some EVO and a bit of the pasta cooking water before you add the penne to the sauté pan, and perhaps increase the butter or add some additional EVO and cooking liquid to the pan.   Or try adding more tomato.  You may also prefer to use a good brand of diced canned tomatoes (drain most of the liquid), as a compromise.  But it is best if the tomatoes retain as much of their uncooked character as possible, to the point of perhaps adding them at room temperature to each dish just before serving.  The fresh uncooked tomato flavor is a key element.

For blandness, try additional garlic and some basil.

I've been making variations of this for a few years, depending what I have on hand.  I often add extra veg (red and yellow peppers), sometimes crumbled cooked bacon, sometimes pine nuts.  A versatile and yummy recipe.

For me, artichokes hearts were difficult to find. So instead of artichokes hearts, I used Brussels Sprouts and cut them into quarters and also added sliced baby zucchinis. And on the side, I made grilled asparagus :) 

Any little vegetable changes is alright. As long as it compliments the rest of the dish!

I followed the recipe, except I used dried parsley, and left out the artichoke hearts, as I don't really care for them. This dish was alright, but kind of dry. Not sure I'd make again.

I make this according to the recipe, except I add fresh spinach before putting in the tomatoes.  It can be a time saver to use diced tomatoes out of a can, but the fresh taste better.

This was amazing! I used marinated artichokes and put all the ingredients in the Dutch oven cooked on 300 for about 45 minutes and it was done. Oh and I added mushrooms. Made it for the husband for valentines day and he loved it. Definately a keeper!

So good! I would make a small portion because the leftovers don't really work. It leaves it kind of soggy even though it might have been because I added spinach to mine.

I can't imagine making this as is...used marinated artichokes and they provide the majority of flavor here, as long as you go EASY on the lemon juice!  Used grape tomatoes as suggested by others as well.  Also, use some feta IN the skillet but most on top after plating it up.

Excellent!  I tried to make this a little healthier by using olive oil instead of butter; whole wheat penne pasta; more vegetables, such as mushrooms, green and red peppers and black olives.  The flavors were fantastic!  My family wants to see this one on our table again.  Thanks Jennifer!!

Fabulous recipe! I have 6 kids so double the recipe, everyone loved it. It can be a bit of a challenge to find a recipe every child likes and this was a hit. I followed suggestions from the first review and also added chicken broth to the sauce.  I double the recipe & used 1-2 cups of chicken broth. I may add sliced black olives next time.  I cooked 2 boxes of pasta to be safe but only used 1 1/2 boxes. Several had 2 servings, 2 kids & husband had lunch next day too. Thanks for the recipe!!

this recipe rocks!  I added sun-dried tomatoes and a bit of water since the penne tends to soak up the liquid quickly.  I opted out of the onion since the BF doesn't dig onions. Also added more feta when plating up the dish!  DELISH!

healthy and delicious! I used bowtie pasta, canned diced tomatoes and dried parsley as substitutes only because that's what I had on hand and it turned out fabulous.

Good easy dinner.  My family really liked it.  I agree with the others, about using less pasta, more Feta and marinate artichokes.  I only had spinach rotini noodles and halved cherry tomatoes which turned out great.  There were plenty of leftovers which we will enjoy as a cold side salad for lunch.  I will make this again.

As written this is bland and has way too much penne.  I would half the pasta amount.  This is okay as a stand-by recipe.

Love, Love, Love this recipe.   substituted the artichockes with chopped spinach and seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic, black pepper and seasoning salt before sauteeing in olive oil and margerine.  Next time will use canned tomatoes as well as fresh as have been suggested by others.

I too used marinated artichokes, other than that I followed the recipe and thought it was quite tasty. I will follow the advice of others next time and add cream and more feta cheese close to the end.

After reading several reviews this is how I made this recipe. I used 3 minced garlic bulbs and a little extra red onion, cooked them in the skillet with olive oil and a little butter. I only had artichokes in water which worked out fine. Used a can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh tomato. Chopped my frozen boneless skinless chicken tenderloins into bite sized pieces and added to the skillet seasoning them with Lawry seasoning salt. Added rest of ingredients after chicken was cooked and a little more than 1/2 cup of feta cheese, salt and black pepper. Added the cooked penne. Served with extra feta on the top. Excellent flavor. Definitely a keeper.

Great....my 9 year old loved it and even ate the artichokes without noticing them.  I used the marinated ones like people suggested and also added some heavy cream at the end.  Didn't really notice the fresh parsley so probably would just toss some dried in next time for color to avoid chopping that.  Cooked the chicken with the onion and added the garlic to that when the chicken was done.

Tasty recipe. This recipe uses ingredients that I often have in the house already so I will make this again. I used diced canned tomato's, and added green olives. I used 1/2 cup of feta in with the sauce and sprinkled some on top after. I used Italian seasoning and added an extra 1/2 tsp. I would agree that this recipe requires much less pasta then suggested. Overall, good.

This rating is with the revisions.  I did most of the suggestions.  I used 14oz of pasta, marinated artichoke, diced canned tomatoes, and I added a little heavy cream at the end.  I also added my own twist with some zucchini.  It was fabulous!!

This recipe is great I didn't have artichoke hearts so I just added some extra spices to the chicken while it cooked, I also added celery (I love it in everything). I used a large can of diced tomatoes juice and all it helped carry all the flavor through. Great recipe thanks for posting my husband just loves it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish and plan on making this again.  I followed a lot of the advice of other raters - decreased amount of pasta to 8 ozs, used olive oil instead of butter, increased garlic (even added some garlic powder), used a can of diced tomatoes instead of a fresh tomato, added calamata olives, and increased the amount of feta cheese.  I had also purchased heavy cream to add at the end but forgot it and was glad I did - the meal did not need the extra fat.  Great recipe!

My husband called this "a delightful, hearty, complex cacophony of flavors."  When he waxes poetic about food you know it's good!!  Neither of us realized how delicious artichoke hearts are.

SOOO GOOD! I made this tonight minus the artichokes b/c they had spoiled. :( Other then that it came out wonderfully, I did do as some others had suggested by adding in 8oz of tomato sauce. This was so tasty, definitely adding it to our recipe box.

flippin amazing.  made a few changes:  omitted tomatoes, omitted chicken, used 2x as much feta, added fat free half and half to skillet at end of cooking time to make more of a sauce, and then once i had it in the bowls added chopped fresh baby spinach.  it was so incredible & fresh tasting.  thank you so much for the recipe!  we can't wait to make it again!!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe.  It did become dry after the first meal so I'll be following some of the other suggestions and using some cream and diced canned tomatoes instead of fresh. I also added a red pepper which complimented the other flavors nicely. This recipe makes a lot more than it seems like it will, great for lunch leftovers or a second dinner for two.

I made this for the first time for dinner tonight. I used the marinated artichokes as some reviewers suggested - I got them quartered and used them after draining but I think next time I would cut them up a bit. I didn't use tomato since one son hates it...I used broccoli instead (make sure to not overcook it). I doubled the butter and added a couple of TBL of olive oil. The dish came out great and the lemony/butter/garlic mixture tasted (and smelled) very good. I will definitely make this again.

I'm giving this 4 stars because of the changes that I feel need to be made to this recipe to warrant 5 stars.  First as other reviewers noted, adding some chicken broth was a must to moisten the dish.  I also used about 1/8 cup capers which added a punch of flavor (I can't eat onions so needed something to substitute).  Next time I would use canned diced tomatoes with the juice and marinated artichokes.  It was a very tasty dish that we enjoyed but needs some slight tweaking to make it outstanding.

Love the combinations of taste in Greek food! I followed the suggestions of others and enjoyed them. Here's what I added that I would recommend:  Kalamata olives. Especially if you don't have enough or any marinated artichokes on hand. The olive helps carries the flavor and gives it the same "bite" the artichoke does. This is a refreshing dish and my kids went back for seconds. Thanks for suggesting it!

Family loved it!  I changed a few things after viewing several comments.  I used marinated artichoke hearts, some red bell peppers and marinated the chicken in the artichoke liquid. My kids were not sure about the feta so I used Babybel natural cheese instead and sprinked feta at the table.  I liked the suggestion of cooking the pasta in broth so I put a bouillon cube in the pasta water.  Another modification I did was to add about 1/2+ cup of pasta water to make the dish saucier.  I also added some chopped fresh spinach at the very end.

I followed what someone suggested to add some tomato paste to make more of a sauce and to add marinated artichoke hearts. I think the dish was good. it was NOT great..I probably would not make it again. The marinated artichoke hearts made it sour a little.

This was good!  I used half the amount of pasta and artichokes.  I didn't have the specified herbs so I used some fresh basil.

Came out great. Just made some changes. I used crushed red pepper, goat cheese and 1/4 cup of greek yogurt. Made the sauce creamy.

Because I don't care much for canned tomatoes I added a cup of low sodium chicken broth to the mixture due to comments about the sauce being scant.  I also used multi-grain penne. This kept it a healthier choice and it was wonderful.

Being that this is listed under healthy cooking, I am amazed at how many people said they added butter, heavy cream, marinated artichokes, oil, etc.  If you need more sauce, let the butter, onion, & garlic mixture, artichokes(in water) & tomatoes cook down in some chicken broth. Add more flavor and less calories by using more herbs.

Yum! And easy! I made some changes though: used whole wheat penne rigate, used olive oil instead of butter, used a can of barely drained diced tomatoes instead of chopped fresh tomato, threw in a little fresh spinach at the end, and I think I upped the lemon juice a bit. I also used chopped rotisserie chicken meat, which was really delicious here. Try it! It makes the meal so much quicker.

YUMMY, really enjoyed this one!  I had some whole wheat rotini extra in the fridge from a dish a few nights back, so used that instead of the penne.  I left out the onions as we don't really enjoy them too much, quickly sauteed the garlic in a lightly sprayed skillet and added my chicken with some of the artichoke marinade as suggested by others.  The only changes I made were to use 2 plum tomatoes and the zest from about half a lemon - this dish has a really nice (not too overpowering) lemon flavour and I'm glad I added the zest.  I did divide my feta (used light), using half when called for and the rest when serving - excellent!  Next time I make this I will probably omit the artichokes (this was the first time ever trying them) and use lots of fresh mushrooms, mmmmm!

I would only give this recipe 3 stars as written because it comes out rather bland and way too heavy on the pasta.  This does however get 4 stars when done with the recommendations of other reviewers: add 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of tomato sauce, use marinated artichokes and double the amount of feta, onion and garlic but reduce the amount of pasta by 1/2.  We still ended up with 6 very generous serving.

Loved this recipe! Simple to make but a fancy meal. I used marinated artichokes and I used the juice when cooking the onions and garlic. I added extra garlic. I added a can of basil and oregano "flavored" diced tomatoes, with all of the juice. I added extra feta on top of the plate whenever served. 

I served it with pole beans sauteed with onions and garlic in butter. Excellent meal!

This recipe was a great base for what I was looking for.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used only half a package of penne, used canned tomato instead of fresh, which made it very juicy.  I ommitted the onions since my hubby doesn't like them, used marinated artichokes, and added calamate olives. With these alterations, this recipe was perfection!  My husband would not stop raving about it as we ate... even the next day he told me he wants it again very soon!  Thanks for the recipe!

I changed this recipe from Greek to Italian by substituting marinated fresh mozzarella for the feta, olive oil for the butter, and omitting the lemon juice.  Like many of the other reviewers, I used a can of diced tomatoes with basil seasoning.  I prefer to cook with whole wheat penne - it's more flavorful & heart-healthy.  Also, make sure you use fresh herbs and garlic!!  All in all, this is a simple and fresh meal that was enjoyed by all of my guests.

This is pretty good with all the alterations suggested by others.  There is too much pasta so I would cut amount in half as others have mentioned.  I used olive oil with garlic and onion.(as suggested)  I doubled the cheese and tomato and added a can of diced tomatoes. We love cheese and tomatoes around here!!! :) I also used light feta but you have to know which light feta is good because some are tasteless. Pretty yummy.  My husband liked it as well.  I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good.  I also halved the pasta and used olive oil and marinade instead of butter. I also used a can of diced tomatoes which gave it just enough "juice".  Definitely use 1 cup of feta - 1/2 in the pasta and 1/2 on top.  I also put in some Kalamata olives.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this over and over. Its fabulous. The only modification is to double the liquid or it dries up quick. One time I added some low-fat italian dressing to add a little more flavor and sauce. Terrific!

Quick, easy and delicious! I did add an extra 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice, a tbsp of olive oil and dried basil to the "sauce." Very flavorful. I can't believe it is supposed to be 4 servings, though...this is a lot of food!

DH and I both loved this.  Used only 12 oz of pasta.  I added a can of black olives, although something like kalamata would probably be more authentic.  

tip: it gets dry as leftovers, so when reheating add a dash of lemon juice, olive oil and a couple tablespoons of water.  Shake it all around in the storage container to make it saucy again.

I love making this during the week because it is so easy and I generally have all of the ingredients on hand already.  I have made it with and without chicken...and it's great either way.  As others have noted, watch the amount of pasta in here - as stated, I too felt there was way too much.  Thanks!

I made this recipe once as is and L-O-V-E-D it!!!  WOOOPS--that's not true.  I guess I used yellow onion because I didn't have red onion.  But we still loved it.  I'm making it again with a few healthy changes.  I'm taking the advice of some of the readers and using olive oil instead of butter and I'm going to be using whole wheat pasta because it's so much better for you and I think it tastes good.  The serving number is off considerably but I appreciated it because I count on left overs for later.  We had the left overs a couple of times over--stayed good for 2 days.  I'm very thankful for this recipe.  Also, I think this recipe should be skipped if you don't like artichokes.  The artichokes are really what make the dish over-the-top!

This was a huge hit with my family and it was easy to prepare. My only complaint is that the number of servings is not accurate. I followed the original directions for 4 servings and ended up with enough to feed 8.

This dish was really good and tasted fresh (I loved the fresh tomatoes!).  I substituted a small block of fresh mozzarella cheese (cut into cubes) for the Feta and it was fantastic.  Just be sure to add the mozz. just before serving because it melts quikly.  Will definitely be making this again!

This was a pretty easy recipe.  I don't think it was extremely high on flavor, but was light and great for summer.  I used olive oil instead of butter, canned tomatoes instead of fresh and 3 frozen chicken breasts.

Like many reviewers, I used half the amount of pasta; doubled the feta; and used marinated artichoke hearts, finely chopped up.  I also threw in a couple of extra well-ripened roma tomatoes, a couple of splashes of chardonnay, and a tub of shredded parmesan.  Didn't find it too dry as some reviewers said; the juice from the tomatoes, the lemon juice, & the wine gave enough for us.  All-in-all, it is what it says it is...a "stand-by" nice quick meal.  We enjoyed it.  Thanks, Jennifer!

This was excellent.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used marinated artichokes and canned diced tomatoes.  I also halved the amount of pasta but kept everything else the same.  I was only cooking for 2 so even 1/2 box of pasta was alot.  But the leftovers were just as good!

Used 1/2 pkg. of Mini Penne, 14 oz. marinated artichoke hearts, 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes, sliced black olives, No onion, No lemon juice, no spices, just chopped garlic.  AND SHRIMP!  Sauted garlic, butter and shrimp while pasta is cooking.  Added artichoke hearts, tomatoes and chopped olives and 3/4 pkg of feta cheese.  Added drained pasta.  Mixed and cooked till heated through. Delicious.  Next time I will try with Chicken.

This is really good. I followed the suggestions and added 1 can of chopped tomatoes instead of a fresh one, about 1/4 cup of whipping cream omitted the onion (personal preference) and used 1 4oz pkg of Tomato Basil Feta cheese. This makes a lot and was way more than 4 servings but the left overs will be enjoyed. A caution, unless you have a very deep skillet adding the penne to the sauce may be tricky next time I'll mix the sauce and the penne in the serving bowl. My husband thought it was to lemony but I thought it was just right.

This was good and will probably make it again.  I sauteed the onions and garlic in butter AND some olive oil.  I used a can of drained diced tomatoes and substituted the feta for mozzarella.  I added a little chicken broth to make it saucier and topped it with grated Romano.

Fresh and summer flavorings made this a wonderful dish.  I included a can of black olives to add the greek flavor and also sauteed some asparagas that went unnoticed by the kids.

this recipe was delicious. the only thing i did different was to use canned crushed tomatos rather than fresh tomatos. it made it more saucy. it didnt taste too sour to me, but i am very fond of tart and sour things.  i will make this over and over again....yum:)

Very tasty. I used half the amount of pasta, which was whole wheat and added a couple more tomatoes. Was very good. I used flavored sun dried tomato and basil feta, so next time I think I'l add some extra sun dried tomatoes to this.

At first bite, I was dissapointed but the more I ate of it, the better it seemed to taste. I too used a can of diced tomatoes (drained) and added a few TBLS of chicken broth to ensure that the mix wouldn't get "dry" as others have stated. In the end, I liked it and it is healthier than many of the cream-based pastas.

This was quick and easy but too dry even after adding a lot more liquid. My family didn't care for the artichoke but liked the rest of it.

I found a Greek marinade for the chicken - made it in the morning to marinate in the fridge during the day. I also got the marinated artichokes as commenters recommended. Served it to my husband and two guests - instant favorite.

I liked this recipe but thought it was a little bland.  I followed a mixture of the original recipe and some of the suggestions by other reviewers as well as adding a few things of my own.  I do not like artichokes so I did not use them.  I only used 8 oz. of pasta which was plenty.  I used the juice of half a lemon which I think may have been a tad to much.  Doubled the garlic and cubed 2 big chicken breasts.  Used I cup of chicken broth, 1 13 oz can of diced tomatoes in sauce and a couple of splashes of heavy cream which really made the sauce creamy.  I also cut up and slightly steamed a bunch of asparagus and added to the dish towards the end.  I added a little bit pepper flakes in addition to some extra oregano and basil.  It was good but feel it needed a boost of flavor

I make this all the time. Everyone loves it!
I do add 1/2 a cup of heavy whipping cream towards the end because it can be dry. It gives it a wonderful creamy texture and keeps it moist.

I loved this recipe because it gave me another reason to use artichoke hearts & the flavors were such a beautiful medly. I tweeked it a lil, i wanted more sauce & a little more color so i added more parsley & tomato, another 2 tbsp of butter & maybe 1/2 cup of the pasta water i left as a reserve just in case. I love artichoke hearts & had an extra jar so added that too (drained of course) &  a little more lemon juice. The flavors were addictive!!

This recipe was pretty whatever. After we realized that, we turned it into California Chicken Spaghetti (also on this site), which is kind of an advanced version of this one.

I like it. It was nice and light, not saucy or cheesy like a lot if the other pastas I make. Kid loved it the most ate it fast and asked for a second plate instead of dessert!  I made it as is, but I agree it was lacking just needed to a be a little more wet I think. Next time I will probably use 3-4 very ripe tomatoes, and use olive oil instead of butter.

Very good, but I took everyone's suggestions. I used diced tomatoes, marinated artichoke and most of the marinade, doubled the garlic, used a whole onion (oops), and accidentally added some red pepper when I grabbed the wrong bottle (it was still great) and added cream. The sauce tasted great was a bit thin, probably because I didn't have real cream and used half and half.  But it still tasted great so I'm keeping it.

The brine of the capers, combined with the chew of the pasta and the creaminess of the cheese, makes this a very delicious recipe. I recommend.

I found it to have too much pasta per serving and somewhat dry.  I will substitute a box of chopped tomatoes for the one tomato on the next round and cut back on the pasta by maybe one half.

More mixed review from the family.  I would have given it a 4 but the wife and son only went for three.  Got in a hurry and did not measure the lemon so probably added a little too much.  Will try it again when they are not looking and see if I can raise the grade.

Good but had a tangy taste in there that I wasn't as wild about. If I made it again I would try without the lemon juice. I also used extra garlic, a can of tomato paste and sautéed the chicken in some of the marinated artichoke juice. I only used about half the artichoke, I thought it was too much.

love it! so did my husband. we replaced artichokes with garlic stuffed green olives since we don't like artichokes and it was awesome! my husband said it is something we can serve to guests and really worth the cost! the only thing i would like to do next time is double the sauce ingredients! a winner!

This is amazingly good! I made this with the additions suggested by other chefs! I used diced canned tomatoes, and made a cream sauce with about three ounces of cream and two pats of butter when the original recipe was complete. It was even more flavorful the next day for lunch. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe and many thanks to everyone that provided reviews and suggestions!

This dish was enjoyed by everyone. My husband took leftovers to work which he never does. I used two tomatoes since many said the sauce might be dry. No problems with dryness. I did use the marinated artichokes.

I love this recipe. It's become a staple of mine, and buy the ingredients to make it about once every couple of weeks. The only substitution I use is garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. It makes it a little more garlicy without having to let the garlic flavor sit and develop.

I can't believe how quick and easy this was, literally ready to eat in the amount of time it takes to cook pasta noodles.  I used fresh tomato and sun-dried tomato, marinated artichoke hearts and extra red onion, probably extra feta as well.  Will make this again if for no other reason then how incredibly easy it is!

I enjoyed this recipe! I did heed other reviewers advice and added a ton of fresh garlic.  Contrary to what another person said- my left overs kept very well and I ate it for the next three days:) I just added a little more feta, lemon juice, and a little bit of butter.  it was great and EASY!!!!!!:)

My boyfriend and I made this recipe last night. It took a little less time than the original recipe said it would, which was a plus since I did not prep as well as I should have. The dish was not only beautiful, but also was absolutely delicious. I will definitely add it to my recipes box so that we can make it again!

This tasted alright... I think the amount of penne used in this recipe was a little too much for the amount of other ingrediants it had, making it more pasta than anything else...

This is one of my family's most requested recipes.  Chgs include 1/2 lb penne pasta, 4 cloves of garlic, 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of a single chopped tomato, 1T of parsley, and I add a small can of tomato sauce so that we can use to soak up with our garlic bread.  I'm not much of a cook but even I can pull this one off at a 100% success rate.  Try it, you'll love it!

Prepared as wirtten, but thought it was going to be too dry. Added a can of diced tomatoes, then another, then another.  Taste was under spiced and would have been way to dry.  Needs work.

This was pretty decent. I would give it a 3.5 actually. Would have liked more tomato and Feta than the 4oz package I put in there. But then again, I can eat feta like a champ.

This recipe was delicious. The artichoke shines through so make sure to get it fresh if you can at the olive bar.  Changes: I used 50/50 mix of butter/olive oil and added sliced mushrooms when I put the onions and garlic in. I also substituted a white onion for the red on but I'm sure both would be fine.  Also, I only used about 11 oz of penne (2/3-3/4 a package) and used grape tomatoes (sliced in half) instead of a regular tomato.  I will be making this again and again.

This was super yummy!  The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I think if made as is it would be a bit dry.  I did as others reviewers suggested and used marinated artichokes w/all the liquid and also canned diced tomotoes including the liquid as well.  My whole family (including a 2 & 4 year old) liked it which is great!!

This is a great base recipe that can be modified according to what you have on hand. I didn't have all the ingredients so I modified it. First I used lingunie pasta instead of penne. I cooked my chicken breast in the oil from the marinated artichoke hearts and seasoned it with garlic-paprika seasoning. When the chicken was cooked I removed it from the pan and added garlic to saute for about 4 minutes. Then I put the chopped chicken and artichoke hearts in the pan. I added a half cup of white wine and let it reduce. Once reduced (about 8 minutes on med-high) I added a half can of whole black olives and 2 T of capers. I also added 1 T of balsamic vinegar, a dash of chicken bouillon, and 1 T of lemon juice from plastic lemon for flavor. So basically I didn't use butter, onion, tomatoes, feta cheese, or parsley and it still turned out great! I know I made a lot of modifications, but that's what makes this an awesome recipe.. It's veratile! So, bon apetit!

This recipe was delicious! I didn't even think I liked artichoke hearts, feta cheese, and tomatoes. I used wheat penne just to add a little more healthy. Was very simple to make too.

This was very good, but I did follow others' suggestions and used a can of diced tomatoes and adding some heavy cream and cut back on the amount of pasta.  Otherwise I could see where it would be very dry.

I actually make this recipe so much that my husband has been complaining. He's tired of smelling the garlic and basil :) I made this the first time with the artichoke hearts, but haven't after that. Either way is good. I've made it several times without chicken too if I don't have any on hand. My 6 yr old also loves it. I definitely will stick with this recipe and variations of it.

Wonderful flavor!!!! I did take others suggestions and used a can of diced tomatoes istead of a whole tomato. I also used olive oil & some of the marinade from the artichokes to cook the onions, garlic and then added more of the marinade when I added the chicken. It gave it great flavor. I also seasoned the chicken before adding to skillet. If you find it still a little dry, add some of the water used to cooked the penne into the mixture. I didn't need to do this but the water used to cook pasta adds nice flavor and moisture to most pasta sauces. I also doubled the feta and saved half to top the pasta and used only 12 oz of pasta (MAKES PLENTY). My whole family LOVED this dish! It makes WAY more than 4 servings.

This was very good.  I didn't rate it as 5 stars because I am not a big fan of the bright, lemony flavor on pasta.

OMG!!! This was really GOOD. I did change a few things. I used the Feta cheese with the Garlic and Herbs, and I used the canned Diced Tomatoes with Green Pepper & Onion. I had the can of Artichoke in water already and I read other reviews about needing more flavor, that's why I got the seasoned Feta cheese, and then the seasoned Tomatoes. I only used like 3/4 of the Penne Pasta box. It turned out PERFECT!!! My 12 month old daughter ate it!!!!!!! I will be making this again.

Perhaps I set my expectations too high for this dish, but I was not impressed. I took a suggestion to use canned tomatoes, and I wish I would have just used fresh. Overall, it lacked something. I used the entire container of feta in an attempt to give it some kind of flavor. It has the potential to be good, if something is added.

The flavors of this dish were good - but I thought it was really dry.  I even used 3 tomatoes instead of the one it called for.  I also used more feta, a 3.5 oz package of reduced fat.  I served it with balsamic vinegrette to sprinkle on the pasta, and to me that saved the dish.  Just a 3 star for me.

Thanks for sharing! I made this last night and had some leftovers for lunch today. It's really quite good, though I didn't need to add so much lemon juice. I put in only half the suggested amount. Also, I think next time I cook this meal (and there will certainly be a next time!), I will add half the feta in the pan and the other half on the plates.

Very good - although I forgot to buy artichokes, and I'm sure that would have made it even better. Will tweak some more until my family loves it, but a great starting point. Thanks.

My very picky man and I really enjoyed this recipe. The only changes I made were to use three roma tomatoes, olive oil instead of butter, and 3/4 cup of feta. I also added the optional black olives. I am adding this to our regular line up. Thank you Jennifer!

Delicious! I thought this recipe was great--I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars. The only reason I don't give it 5 is because I thought the lemon taste was a tad overpowering. Next time, I'll reduce it by 1/2 tsp or so and it should be perfect. Also followed other reviewers advice and used marinated artichoke hearts as well as diced tomatoes w/italian seasoning instead of a fresh tomato, which made more sauce so I didn't have to reduce the pasta amount.

My husband asked me to bring lunch to him and some of his colleagues  one day.  I made this to rave reviews.  I did do a couple of things differently though.  I added a tomato, used marinated artichokes and added a can of black olives.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks for the keeper.

I was in the mood for a chicken and pasta meal -- imagine my delight when I opened this site and this was the featured recipe.  I also used marinated artichoke hearts and recommend that change.  Leftovers were surprisingly good cold the next day!

My husband rated this a 1, but he doesn't like pasta dishes, so I will give it a 2. We are not artichoke eaters, either (I like them once in awhile), so I left them out. Not big fans, sorry, personal preference.

I took other reveiwers advice.  I added 1 can of diced tomatoes (undrained).  Used olive oil instead of butter to sautee the onions and garlic.  I used less pasta then it called for and I didn't think it was too dry.  Overall I thought this was a great recipe! Thanks!

I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday dinner and everyone raved about it. I did add some extra tomato sauce per another review. I also used marinated artichoke hearts. I will definitely be making this again!

Definitely not saucy enough. Good flavors, though. I added 1/2 can tomato puree, some of the juice from the marinated artichokes, and the juice from another whole lemon, in addition to about 1/4 cup more feta.

This was EXCELLENT!!!
I used less pasta and 1.5 jars of artichoke along with the marinate to make it moist. I reduced the lemon to 1.5 tbsp.

Very nice - followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and the family loved the dish.  My only negative comment about the dish is that it is just not a very attractive dish ...I would not as a result serve it at a dinner party, which is too bad as it tastes soooo good!

My husband and I thought this was an excellent dish. The more feta cheese the better in my opinion! Added canned mushrooms, personal preference. Also took the advice of other reviews and added canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars based on potential, but it deserves 3.5 as written.  The recommended amount of pasta (at a hefty 1/4lb per serving), of course, needs more 'sauce'.  But taking that into consideration and adjusting accordingly, I sauted a diced med-size sweet onion with the garlic in olive oil, then added a can of drained diced tomatoes along with the feta and quartered artichoke hearts (quickly rinsed to rid them of that tinny taste).  Once the lemon juice, oregano and parsley were added, the sauce still needed to be a little 'saucier', so I added some of the pasta water to thicken (used the 'Enhanced Spaghetti' method by WHATS HIS FACE to cook the penne).  This recipe is also substantial enough to serve w/ or w/o the chicken (as I had my portion); a nice change from the heavier tomato-based pasta recipes... will make again with these changes.  Thanks!

I thought that this was a great quick weeknight meal.  I used the fresh tomato and I had some grape tomatoes in the fridge that needed used so I put those in too.  Next time I will use canned.  I can't stand tomato skins in things!  I also used 5 oz of tomato basil feta cheese and fresh basil and cut back on the oregano.  I added an extrs clove of garlic and a whole sweet onion.  This was enjoyed by everyone (my mom said thaqt it tasted like something you would order at a restaurant).  A nice change from a standard pasta dinner.

This was a great pasta dish that both my husband and I really enjoyed. As we are not big fans of artichokes I substituted them with extra tomato. I used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of a fresh chopped one and it was just perfect. It also cut down the prep time. I did take note of some of the other reviews and cut down the amount of pasta I used. It was a great summer pasta that was not too heavy. This is a keeper at my place.

Very good, Jennifer!  I added more lemon juice and feta cheese.  Per other reviews, 16 ounces is way too much pasta!  Cut it in half.  Cheers!

Meal was good but had a little less flavor/spice than we normally like...our 2 year old ate 2 servings though! Less pasta would have been a good idea if we would have read the reviews before we tried it and I will probably add a little white wine to the sauce and marinate the chicken to add a little more flavor if I make it again.

This was awesome!  We left out the artichokes, and substituted cilanto for parsley. The lemon juice made the dish I think.  So light and fresh, perfect for a hot summer night!

I thought it was great and very "Greek" tasting.  I used the 16 oz. penne but doubled everything else. I also substituted roasted red peppers for the tomatos and I added Black olives.  I did add chicken broth also like others have said.  My family loved it and my husband and I get to take it for lunch tomorrow!  YAY!

This was delicious.  I also used half the pasta, kalamata olives, olive oil instead of butter, and a little extra feta on top.  It came out great.  If you do not like olives, it is still very good.  My family loved it.  I served it with a greek salad !

I had planned to BBQ the chicken breasts I had thawed when this recipe appeared in my Inbox, so decided to give it a try.  I used just a tiny bit of butter plus olive oil and a mix of yellow and red onions.  I didn't have penne on hand, so used tiny shell pasta.  Also, we were out of artichokes so had to leave them out.  I also used quite a bit less pasta than called for and had to use dry parsley.  Even with these substitutions and changes, it was EXCELLENT!!

FABULOUS RECIPE!!!! Followed a few of the suggestions of the others:  I added a 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream to make the dish a bit more saucier.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used about 4 tablespoons of dried.  The combinations of the flavors are wonderful in this dish.  Thanks for a great recipe!!  Will definitely make this again.

This was a delicious dish. The only thing I would change would be the amount of pasta. Reducing it by 1/3 would proably be more appropriate. All in all the combination of flavors was excellent.

Wonderful recipe! I was looking for a great lemon-artichoke-chicken recipe. I changed a few things to make it even healthier: 1. I omitted the butter and used olive oil spray instead and 2. I used non-fat feta. The lemon makes the dish, so don't leave it out. I also used 1 T dry parsley instead of fresh. It's a keeper.

The only change I made to the recipe was in response to other reviews, adding the marinated artichokes to the chicken white it cooked. I did use fresh tomatoes but used 2 medium. My husband and I enjoyed this meal

My rating is not based on the original recipe which was probably good but of by using the changes recommended  by others. It was delicious.

I found this recipe about 6 years ago and made it originally for my boyfriend (now husband) who is of Greek heritage. We absolutely love it!  Everyone I've made it for loves it. Fantastic recipe, thank you! My only tweak is to use marinated artichokes and dump in the entire 12 oz. including marinade. I'm just making it now for his birthday dinner.

I made the recipe as stated except I didn't have garlic on hand so I substituted garlic powder.  It was good and I'm sure with fresh garlic it will be even better!  The house smelled wonderful while cooking, however, the recipe tasted a little bland. I will definitely make it again, but will go a little heavier on the spices.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I seasoned the chicken while cooking and added a bit the juice from the kalamata olives . I cut back about a third on the pasta, but next time I will go to half. I used canned diced tomatoes just for speed, but I think halved cherry tomatoes would be even better.

I made this exactly as described. Not much flavor, but if I make it again I’ll add more lemon juice and more garlic and other spices.  Easy enough to make just needs a boost of flavor.

I loved it!  I might use 3/4 tbsp oregano rather than 1 full tbsp. And I added kalamata olives (because I love them)!  Great recipe, and easy to prepare.

A very nice "marriage" of Italian and Greek  Mediterranean  tastes discovered in this WONDERFUL pasta dish!  DO use MARINATED quartered cut artichoke hearts.  It's OK to sub the butter with olive oil AND a tablespoon ( or two ) of the artichoke MARINADE, if you want to amp up that sweet zippy essence of vinegarette.  Use the good Feta cheese with this one---and be liberal with it's use, too!

You know, I liked this.  I followed the recommendations to sautée the garlic and onion in the liquid from the marinated artichoke hearts.  Quite good.

In addition I increased the amount of feta and added as suggested.  Tomato paste was also used with the two Roma tomatoes.  

It was quite good.  I would cut the pasta in half though.  I do not see how this is 4 servings.  More like 8 actually.

I followed the suggestions of other folks and used marinated artichoke hearts, and used one can of diced tomatoes instead of chopped tomatoes.  I also added a small (8 oz.) can of tomato sauce.  Added extra pepper as well because we like our food a little on the spicy side.  It was a huge hit!  I will definitely make it again.

The only change I made was to eliminate the chicken. My daughter is a vegetarian and I wanted a dish that we could both eat. I also used the marinated artichoke hearts. That was a great tip from other users. I'd most definitely make this again. It was delicious and flavorful.

FABULOUS! Agree to use marinated artichokes, lemon zest, capers, white wine and I also used diced tomatoes with oregano & basil.  And of course, a bit more butter :)

This was delicious!  I made it "as is" but did not put in all of the pasta and it made a lot more than 4 servings.  Artichokes are not on our favorites list so I will take another reviewers suggestion and substitute fresh mushrooms next time.  I prefer fresh ingredients, so I will stick with the tomato instead of using canned, but will probably use 2.

I didn't have artichokes  but my garden is full of asparagus so I substituted that.  I'm thinking, artichokes would have been even better but we loved it with the asparagus too.

Having lived in Europe and understanding that pastas are not usually full of sauce, nor overloaded with other ingredients, I did not make any changes.  It was perfect.

We love this but here's what I do. I don't use as much pasta and I added almost a full 14.5 oz can of crushed tomatoes. We don't like artichokes so I left them out. I also added Italian seasoning and a bunch of crushed red peppers. After mixing it all and placing it in bowls I added cut in half cherry tomatoes and topped it all  with more feta. Husband and son eating now and they are happy!

I've made this recipe several times, and it always turns out delicious.  This most recent time, I took some other reviewers' advice and used a can of diced tomatoes rather than an actual tomato (my one complaint about this recipe is that sometimes it turns out kind of dry).  It definitely improved the dish in my opinion, making it much less dry.  But, I also don't like artichokes and have never used them in this dish, so I have no idea how the flavor might be affected if you use the can or artichoke hearts as well.

Great easy dish! One thing though...DO NOT USE IMITATION OR REAL LEMON JUICE AS A SUBSITUTE!!! You have to use a real lemon to get the flavors to pop in your mouth. Great easy dish!

Also thought this recipe was bland-if I try it again, I will follow some of the other suggestions and possibly add spinach.

Used olive oil with the butter to coat the bottom of the pan. Also used a 1/2 cup of white wine with mixing in the garlic and onions. Did not use artichokes. Used 13.5 oz of pasta instead of the 16 oz. Came out great!

This recipe was a hit with the whole family! I made the modifications as suggested by some of the top reviews on this site. I used two 12 oz jars of marinated artichoke hearts, including the liquid from one jar. I also used the juice of one whole lemon instead of only 2 Tbsp, a can (drained) of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and cilantro instead of parsley. Of course, I used a whole container of crumbled Athenos feta...I think it was like a cup and a half. Anyway... it was super tasty and we all loved it!

This was sooooo good! I made a few changes that I thought sounded good - I added some kalamata olives, olive oil instead of butter, twice the amount of feta, and used marinated artichoke hearts. Also, since I am picky about chicken I baked it in the oven and then shredded it into the pasta/veggies mixture at the end (I think baking makes chicken more juicy vs. pan-frying). I also added some extra olives and raw red onions when I served it. I really recommend the kalamata olives because they add a salty acidity that really tastes great with this dish. Thanks for sharing, my husband has insisted that this goes into the "rotation!" :)

I will definitely be making this again! I left out the artichoke hearts, but it was still delicious. I also added just a tiny amount of italian dressing just to give a little extra flavor.  Leftovers are great for lunch too!

So good! After reading other reviews, I made a few modifications. I used 3/4 of the box of penne instead of all of it, I used 1 1/2 large tomatoes to add some juice, I used 6oz of feta, and I added kalamata olives. I also used just a little olive oil in the beginning instead of butter. I didn't find it to be too dry, but I did add just a little of the pasta water to the pot at the end to make sure everything was covered. I used regular canned artichoke hearts, not the marinated like others suggested, and I found them fine. I'm looking forward to the leftovers - I bet it will be great cold too!

This was great!  After reading the reviews I halved the amount of pasta, but followed the recipe the rest of the way, and it turned out great.  I did add a bit of extra feta because we all love it.  I didn't have a problem with the pasta drying out, but will probably try using a can of crushed tomatoes next time, just to try it out.

I thought this was very good but I agree with the other poster that said it didn't have enough sauce to cover the pasta. Next time I increase the ingredients to hopefully make more sauce. I'll also save some feta to top it with at the end because it kinda melts into the sauce and you can't taste it as much as I would have liked. But overall, pretty easy and healthy too.

A fresh, healthy, delicious meal.  I added a little tomato sauce to increase the amount of sauce and of course extra feta.  I also added a whole bag of fresh spinach at the very end and served when just wilted.  Will make again!

My boyfriend and I made this today for dinner.  We followed the recipe as it went.  I should've followed other advice - use less pasta, etc.  After we finished, we thought it was bland and definitely needed something.  We added a little cup of garlic sauce from Papa John's, many shakes of Frank's Red Hot Sauce, and more feta (we used about a full cup of feta).  Then it was much better.  We're definitely going to make this again, but with our revisions.

This recipe is ok, it's a bit on the dry and bland side, but has potential. I recommend adding olive oil and garlic salt.

This is a quick & easy recipe that my husband and I both love! I stuck pretty close to the recipe but omitted the onions.

this was definitely good, and pretty. It tasted very fresh. Instead of adding all the other things everyone else suggested, i just added some sun dried tomato vinagrette dressing. about 1/4 cup. It worked great. But this dish is kind of a lot like pasta salad. So it wasn't really special.

Very good and easy to make dish. The sun-dried tomatoes added some color. Recommendations on reducing pasta amounts and increasing feta cheese were both great.

add calamata olives, and grape tomatoes. DO NOT use tomato paste, it just tastes like spaghetti if you do!

I dont know what I did different.  This honestly the first time I have written a bad review. I did everything by the book and it tasted funky. I think it was the artichokes. I used whole wheat pasta but that should not change anything.

I was very excited about this meal. I was dissapointed by the flavor or lack there of. I added marinated aritchoke hearts to give it more flavor but it did not make a difference. It is a good starting spot but I think it needs more.

Made this tonight - very easy and extremely good.  This actually makes way more than 4 servings. It is good for two nights worth of dinner.  Read some of the reviews and tweak it a little.  It is definately a great dish

My family loved this recipe, the only change I made was to use my Dreamfields low carb pasta . I'm diabetic and it is such a help to me in my quest for lower carb meals. It changes the carb count from 35 digestable carbs for wheat pasta, 40 for reg pasta to 5 digestable carbs per 2 oz serving dry pasta

Very good. I would add another tomato and more artichokes. Also this recipe can feed 6 easy. Eat it all because it is not very good reheated.

Great recipe! Used less pasta than suggested and 1/2 cup extra of feta and drizzled with olive oil right before serving. Might take other suggestions and add some of the artichoke juice during cooking as the recipe is a little dry if prepared according to the recipe. My husband said this is a dish he would order again if at a restaurant!

Very good recipe,we eat this plate mostly as salad or side dish and we cook it with olive oil and not butter,that is why i would disagree with the others who said the sauce is not enough,this plate is meant to be a salad not a full meal.Anyway its tasty.

This turned out really good but you do have to make a lot of adjustments to the original recipe.  Like many others have suggested, I doubled the amount of garlic and oregano, used only a little over half a pound of penne and added a 1/4 cup of cream.  Without the changes, this would been just plain chicken and pasta with no sauce (or flavor) at all. To me adding the cream just helped coat the penne with the seasoning better.  Next time I will use halved cherry tomatoes instead of the chopped tomato.  Both the flavor and the appearance of the tomato were lost when I used the chopped.

This was very good.  I wanted pasta, but something other than the same standard red sauce.  I added only half the pasta listed--for me, the entire package would have been too much pasta, not enough chicken.  I used olive oil instead of butter, and I didn't add artichokes because I forgot them at the store.  This pasta is very tangy with the lemon juice, and a little pungent with the feta cheese.  But my husaband and I both loved it.  I will make again, and next time I will definitely add the artichokes and more tomatoes.

This was amazing!! I kept the serving size for four people so that my roommate and I could have leftovers and I am so glad I did! I did use marinated artichoke hearts and a whole cup of feta for flavor. I turned out so well....I will be making this again! Thanks for the brilliant recipe!

We loved this recipe!  We made a few changes, like some of the other reviewers.  We used half the pasta, and we browned the chicken and deglazed it with 1/4 cup of white wine.  We also added kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and a little more feta cheese.  We'll definitely make this again!

This was delicious. My husband doesn't care for pasta in general, so I gave him a small portion to "try" and he went back for more. I didn't use artichokes either, as we don't care for them. Instead, I added mushrooms and red pepper. Instead of tomato paste/sauce, I used tomato soup and a bit of cream. It did taste like a dish from a restaurant. Easy to prepare and easy to clean up!!

I had a ton of fun making this! I added some pepperocini for some spice and substituted white wine vinegar for lemon juice and it turned out really good! I might add more garlic next time and play with the spices, but the basic recipe allows for a lot of leeway in flavor and ingredients. Thanks Jennifer!

Really delicious basic recipe.  I used no artichokes at all, since my husband wouldn't touch them, but instead added plenty of oregano, 1/2 cup of chicken stock, and 1/2 cup of parmesan to the lemony sauce... then one pat of butter at the very end.  It came out light, creamy and delicious, very flavorful without the marinated artichokes. And of course, you can't go wrong with feta, pasta, chicken, and tomatoes!  :)  A big hit.

Awesome recipe!  I add chopped sun-dried tomatoes and kalamata olives as well.  I also double the amount of feta.  I add the pasta to the sauce pan and cook it for a minute or two with the sauce so it can further absorb the flavors.  My seven and two year olds even loved it!

This was wonderful. What a nice blend of flavors. The lemon adds a nice refreshing zest, which enhances the taste of the feta cheese. I added black olives to my recipe and left out the artichokes since we didn't have any. I also used stewed italian tomatoes in the can since I didn't have any fresh tomatoes. Finally I used the juice from the can of black olives and a bit of cream which added more of a creamy (gravy) texture to the dish. My family prefers pasta dishes with sauce over dry pasta dishes, so I had to do this adjustment to get them to eat it. I also added additional feta cheese at the end. This was awesome and they all just loved it. It is quite addictive and you can't eat just one plate. Yummy!!! Thanks for this QUICK & GOOD recipe.

The recipe looked complicated due to the ingredients, but it actually made up quickly once the veggies were cut. We like garlic, so I used double the amount called for.  I added salt, pepper and Italian seasonings (rather than oregano) to the meat while sauteing, which gave good flavor to the chicken. I used a jar of marinated artichokes (including the marinade)which helped the amount and flavor of the sauce.  I cut up 2 Roma tomatoes and also added about 4 teaspoons of capers.  Sliced grape tomatoes would also be nice.   Next time I might add black olives as well.  I don't think it absolutely needed the feta, but if I use it again, I would add it just before serving.  I served this over whole grain penne.   This dish had really good flavor and it was a quick dish that I will make again.  It would also be terrific with shrimp.  Thanks for a very good recipe.

Great flavor! I do think that this recipe could benefit from a sauce, as it is a bit dry, but it's still very good. I did omit the red onion. Thanks :)

Good, fast and easy! Definitely recommended if you're on a low budget and time. I replaced artichoke hearts with mushrooms as a personal preference and it works just as great.

This was good but a little bland. It needs a sauce. The dish was light but it definitely needs something.

I left out the onion at my boyfriend's request and it might have made the dish less impressive. My father said, "there's something missing." They thought it needed more spice, which I agree. This dish is good if you are looking for something light - a pasta without a thick, heavy sauce.

This recipe is found in the light section, which is why I didn't find other reviewers additions very helpful.  Sure f you add more butter and heavy cream...it's going to taste better.  As is, I found this recipe so bland that we really ate light that night...because it was barely touched.

Very good. I felt like I was eating something healthy for me that actually taste good. I would tone down the lemon the next time around, and it was tough to get my 13 yr old to eat it though, but overall worth making again. :)

I added black olives to this dish and my husband and I loved it.  I can see how some people may not like it because the lemon and spices gives this dish an authentic greek flavor compared to an italian flavor.

This is a quick and easy recipe. Take the other suggestions. Use a can of diced tomatoes slightly drained, add extra garlic and cook the onions with some of the marinade from the artichokes. I also added a dash of the marinade to the pasta noodles before I stirred them in. It is very good for an easy dish.

This was good. I added some pasta water and the juice from the artichokes for some liquid...otherwise it would be dry. Yummy though.

Easy to make, but it was dry. If I make it again I will add some olive oil. The taste was good and the lemon gave it a little zest. Not a big hit with my family, but it's nice to try new recipes.

Great, simple recipe.  I didn't add the artichokes and it was still delicious.  Doubled the garlic, oregano, and feta.

3stars as is, 4 stars with changes.  Very easy to put together and great flavor combinations.
Alterations: Halve the pasta.  Use 1 can of diced tomatoes or 3 tomatoes (not nearly enough).  And bump up the seasoning (but then I tend to like things with some fun flavors).  Oh! the lemon juice is essential!  Will definitely make again, Thanks!

Used 14oz. diced tomatoes instead of fresh, 1 1/2 T. lemon juice, 8 oz. penne (which was more than enough pasta). My husband isn't wild about pasta dishes, but went back for seconds on this one!

This recipe was great, although I did expect it to be more flavorful with all the wonderful ingredients. My mom and aunt loved it though. I used the marinated artichoke hearts, a fresh tomato and an entire box of pasta. I will make this again.

This is fabulous if you follow other review suggestions. I used about 6 oz. pasta, did add some butter to the olive oil and artichoke marinade for saute of onion garlic, used crushed tomatoes seasoned with basil and oregano, no tomato paste and used garlic from the jar rather than fresh. Really no need for salt as it is in canned tomatoes and artichoke marinade. Easy to prepare too.

This was just okay for me.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers.  I used marinated artichokes, and added some of the marinade to the garlic and onion while they were cooking.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes in garlic and olive oil and that didn't seem to really add to the flavor.  There was just something missing.  I liked the mixture of things but there wasn't that punch of flavor I was expecting from all the great ingredients in it.  Might try again changing a few things.

I make this recipe at least once a week.  I live alone, so I adjust the recipe for two servings and take the leftovers to school the next day.  The other teachers in the teacher's lounge ask me all the time what I've got in my tupperware.  I agree that the recipe calls for too much pasta...either lessen the pasta or make more of the sauce.  This is soooo good!!!

Delicious dish! After reading some of the other reviews I added a little bit of the Artichoke marinade while cooking, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was fantastic. It also re-heats well.

This was really good. I put red peppers in it instead of tomatoes, and the sweetness of them blended well with the sour of the Lemon Juice.  I also used the olive oil and put feta on top!

This was excellent! I used fresh cherry tomatoes from my garden, 1 can of diced tomatoes, and reduced the lemon juice a bit as some readers suggested. It was too tomatoey for my boyfriend, but I loved it!

Followed the recipe almost exactly, with the exception of using half olive oil / half butter. I wouldn't think that would make a huge difference overall; and we found this recipe "just ok."

Great recipe! I followed the direction as written and it turned out wonderful.  I have smaller childen and questioned whether they would eat a dish with artichokes.  They inhaled this.  I added shredded parmesan cheese before surving.

A nice recipe. Five-star potential with some changes. I did add a can of tomatoes with the full amount of liquid - there wasn't much sauce even with all of that, if one tomato was used as instructed it would have been really dry. I also really didn't like the lemon in here. I usually love lemon, especially in greek dishes, but I think with all of the feta it just competed too much. I'll probably make this again, it was very quick - thanks for sharing :)

Really well balanced. I will have to add- I did not have all the time in the world to prepare this salad.. so, I added everything as I went along. The canned tomatoes were superb for this dish, I would have not changed a thing. Oh, I did add cilantro because the basil was a little off. but other than that... its was fantastic.

Shared this meal with extended family to mixed reviews. The kids and I liked it, my husband, sister and her boyfriend did not. Still if the kids will eat it, it's a keeper... and one you should try yourself.

This is such a tasty recipe. I added a little chicken broth because my husband thought the lemon juice was too strong, but this is definitely a recipe I'll make again and again. I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!

Delicious and easy to make.  I was happy to have leftovers to take for lunch the next day!  As we were eating it I said that I should have used a can of diced tomatos instead of the fresh tomato so there was a little more liquid - and now I see from the reviews that others said the same thing.  Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  This is definately a keeper!!

As per other reviews, I added 6 oz tomato paste, marinated artichokes, canned diced tomato, and doubled the feta.  I threw in some black olives and halved the pasta.  Sauce base: minced garlic, diced onion, equal parts olive oil and marinated artichoke juice.  Husband loved it.  I'm not terribly crazy about the marinated artichokes, but it was still really good.  Sauce was perfect consistency, but next time I think I'll just go with the butter.  Oh yeah, I used fat free feta...not so sure that was a good choice.  It was a bit rubbery.  Next time, I'll just use regular feta.

Delicious recipe that the whole family enjoyed. Like other reviewers, I recommend cooking with olive oil instead of butter and adding lemon zest and two cans of diced tomatoes instead of one chopped tomato. This gives the dish a much more creamy, satisfying sauce. Also, try adding a teaspoon of honey. :)

This was the first time I tried this recipe.  Very good and easy to make.  I hadn't tasted artichoke hearts before so it was a different taste for me. I didn't have the fresh parsley so used dried.  Glad I tried it.

I thought it was a great base-thank you. I took others advise and added the water from the artichokes, added diced tomatoes (our tomatoes aren't very good yet) and a little less pasta. I also had capers on hand and added those. 

Remember that the longer you cook this after you add the pasta, the more liquid the pasta will soak up, making it seem more dry.

Enjoy!

I really enjoyed this.  Most recipes I change, but this one I didnt (much)... I don't like onions so I omitted those and I added the feta cheese AFTER the pasta was done and in the bowl, but overall I really enjoyed this recipe!

This dish was amazing.  I had to substitute baby peas for the artichoke and capers that I wanted to use (didn't have any in the house).  I seasoned the chicken prior to cooking with garlic salt and paprika.  I added 1 extra clove of garlic as well.  At the end I added some parmesean cheese and about 1 tablespoon of italian dressing, and a pinch of garlic salt (instead of regular salt).  YUM

I used 8 oz of pasta and 1/2 cup of feta to control the calories/carbs.  Even at that, I could easily feed 5-6.  Very tasty and I will make again.

I made this last night for our groups first cook along.  I did make some changes based on other reviewers.  I cooked my chicken in chicken broth and white wine, but still felt the actual chicken lacked flavor, next time I would definitely marinade it.  I also added black olives, used fresh lemon juice, and instead of one tomato (which definitely would not have been enough) I added a can of diced tomatoes.  I used 12 oz of pasta, and actualy used a little more that 1-1/2 lbs of chicken.  Unlike others I did not feel this meal was light at all, maybe it was due to all the chicken I used and I used Rotini instead of Penne (didn't know I was out of Penne)  My hubby and son, didn't care for the artichokes so next time I will make this with more tomato instead.  I was amazed how the feta melted and thickened the sauce nicely and didn't overpower in taste.  I served it with Toasted Garlic Bread also from this site.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, overall it was tasty.

Lynn in Tokyo's pix are awesome and from the photo I noticed how dry this dish looked. After reading the ingredients, I knew why. As written, this was just dry pasta with some chicken and vegies thrown in. In fairness to the recipe, I cooked it as stated, with the exceptions of using less pasta and marinated artichokes. I knew immediately that my gang would not be particularly happy with the dish so I added a can of diced tomatoes, chicken broth, roasted red peppers, broccoli and more seasonings. Even with my additions, hubby and youngest daughter rated it a three. Older daughter and I thought it was a four. I've decided that "Whatshisface" has the right idea by rating a recipe based on what it is and not what you've done to improve on it. Hubby also suggested adding more broth to the leftovers and making soup. Good base Jennifer and I thank you for it, but for us, it really needed some help

this was a snap to prepare.  Perfect for a busy weeknight with homecooked taste. Used EVOO for sautee.  Used a medium whole vidalia sliced, and pounded the chicken down a bit before adding and lastly added garlic to the sautee so as not to burn. (doubled the garlic since garlic lover).  I used white wine in lieu of lemon juice; didn't want it to be too tart with the lemon and tomato.  The wine complimented the other flavors and did come through.  15 oz can of diced tomatoes.  1 tomato did not seem like enough.  Used 8 oz. of mustacchio pasta; 16 oz would have made it way off proportion-wise.  Added fresh chopped basil and 1/2 tsp. oregano, as I am not a real oregano lover.  The feta got lost in the sauce but did help to thicken and make a sauce. Would suggest adding artichokes near the end; mine broke up even though I left them whole and had a can of small size whole hearts.  Added the pasta a little at a time so as not to get it too dry.  Topped w/fresh grated romano.  Very nice light easy meal. Served w/'Mediterranean Olive Bread' from this site which is a perfect compliment to the meal.  The picture provided represents the dish very well.  Thanks for this quick recipe!

Made this tonight, found it to be just ok.  It was easy to prepare, with ingredients I generally have on hand.  It lacked something for me....I did add some broccoli which went pretty well....it wasn't very saucy, maybe the canned tomato would help with that.  My husband said it was a nice light dinner....I might try again with some other reviewers suggestions.  I didn't have parsley, so I used some fresh basil and rosemary which added a nice flavor, and also topped with more feta.  It'll get eaten!

I agree with chefjulie.  My husband liked it but I thought it was dry and bitter.  Not enough of a sauce.

Great!  A nice spicy change from the overly tomato marinara and creamy, white sauces.

This was OK, but not as good as I expected it to be.  I wish it would have had more of a sauce to tie it all together.  My husband thought it was great.

We just finished eating this meal.  It was delicous.  I doubled the recipe but added only 1 1/2 pkgs. pasta.  I also used olive oil instead of butter and topped it off with a couple slices of provolone cheese.  It was very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe

This was very simple to prepare and tasty.  I do think that perhaps a bit more lemon juice is called for.  I think that next time, I may also try a little chicken broth as some of the others recommended.

Wonderful recipe and very easy. I did not find it dry at all. Next time I will add the feta (or maybe some pecorino) after assembling since the half melted feta didn't look very appealing. The lemon juice is what makes this recipe special, so don't skimp. I used the juice of 2 lemons.

An Excellent, Delicious, easy to make dish (especially if you have left over chicken like I did!). I will certainly be sharing this dish with relatives and friends for years to come.

Needs more sauce. Too dry
