I wanted to make this lighter so I used equal amounts of reduced fat mayonnaise, reduced fat sour cream and nonfat greek yogurt. I made this early this morning as I wanted it to sit and really mix the flavors together before dinner. I served sliced red peppers, broccoli flowerettes and carrot chips with this. Quite good! I'll make this again. I think this would be great with some fresh minced garlic and some diced green onion folded in, too.

My mom has made this dip since before I was born and I love it.  If you make it the night before you don't have to rehydrate the onion, just dump it in still dry and hard.  It'll soften just fine.  You can thin it with milk for salad dressing.  For those not in the know, "Beau Monde" is a seasoned salt made by Spice Islands brand.  There is a sub for it here on allrecipes but I've never tried it.  You might want to if Spice Islands brand isn't available in your area.  You could sub a different seasoned salt for it, but it is very strongly flavored so the dip won't be the same (not to say bad, just different).

I've been using a variation of this one for 20 years.  I use minced fresh onion, and I use alot, possibly making a dill onion dip.  Sorry, but I can't even IMAGINE this one served hot.  Beau monde provides salt, so be sure not to add salt if using the beau monde.

I love this recipe. I make this every year and yes, it best made the day before. I follow the recipe exactly and each time it is perfect. I would not change a thing. I keep Beau Monde on hand, this is so good any time of the year!

We've used a version of this for years and LOVE it.  We use chopped green onions in place of the dried and serve it in a pumpernickel bread bowl.  The pumpernickel is also really good with the dip.

I thought this looked like an interesting recipe and tried it for a recent gathering.  The guests loved it.  Many asked for the recipe.  I think it is better hot, rather than cold.

Excellent dip!  Just loved it with fresh veggies.  It reminds me of a recipe I lost a long time ago but have never forgotten.  Can't wait for an excuse to make it again.

This is delicious as a veggie dip. Our favorite veggie was peeled fresh English cucumber spears, but it goes with everything. Instead of dehydrated onions, I used two green onions (white and green parts) finely minced. I had no Beau Monde seasoning, so I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1/4 tsp each of celery seed, salt, sugar, and onion powder. Worked fine. Chilled overnight as directed & that improved the flavor.

Quick, simple and tasty.  I use this for a base for my dried beef rye bowl dip,& I just add 4 oz. of softened cream cheese and 4 oz. dried beef. Wonderful, and not too salty as many recipes are.

This is the best dill dip I have had, I have also used it with salmon on tea sandwiches I made for a shower.  I've had several calls asking for the receipe.  Beau Monde is not at every grocery store, however.

Excellent! Plus you can modify this to make it healthier and lower in fat. I cut back on the mayo (used Hellman's light), opted for fat free plain greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and added 4 oz. of light cream cheese.  I combined all the ingredients and let it set overnight - perfect with cucumbers, carrtos, red peppers, and celery. A really nice snack you don't have to feel guilty about!

My ex-Mother-in-law gave me this recipe in my 20's. Always loved it.  Better with fresh-any-type onion.  Beau Monde is quite similar to Celery Salt, only more tasty.

I love this recipe.  My family and friends thinks it is great.  They all ask for the recipe.  The only think I do differently is - I add a tablespoon of chopped fresh dill weed.  It adds lot of flavor and looks good too.  My husband puts it on his smoked salmon with tomato and capers. He gives it 5 stars as well. Thank you for a great dip.

This is great with chips, veggies or a topping for a baked potato.  When serving I use a round loaf of dark rye bread.  Cut off the top & hollow out the inside. Make the dip, scoop into the loaf of bread & replace the top.  Do this a day ahead so the dip can soak into the bread.  Put the bread from the middle of the loaf in a baggie to keep fresh. When ready to put on the table put the loaf in the middle of a platter & tear the remaining bread into small dipping size pieces & put around the loaf. When the dip gets low you can start tearing the loaf apart. This is the best part because it has been sitting, soaking up the dip!! A family favorite.

Loved it.  I've made dill dip for years but it was never as good as this one.  I think the Beau Monde seasoning is the trick.

This is delicious! I had to substitute seasoning in place of the Beau Monde, but it turned out great! We tried it with baby carrots as well as crackers. My almost 8 year old son really loved it too! :)

I think this is a good basis for the dip, but I ended up adding a bit more mayo for more of a zip. Otherwise it was too sour cream like for my taste. Also, I added a significant larger amount of dill and bit more Beau Monde. It turned out great and just what I was looking for. Great for veggies, but even better in a bread bowl and used to dip bread pieces or crackers in.

My mom has made this ever since I can remember.  It is my favorite dip for fresh vegatables.  However, I use a Tablespoon of fresh, minced, yellow onion.  I typically make it the night before because it is best after refrigeration.

I couldn't find Beau Monde spice in my grocery store, so that had to be omitted. Otherwise, I made as directed and it was a really yummy dip.

Delicious. My mom always served this by spooning the dip into a semi-hollowed out loaf of Rye bread, then she tore the bread she took out into bite-size pieces for dipping (as well as some veggies). Always a big hit.

Absolutely wonderful! I used it with the Almost Beau Monde recipe also found on this site. I didn't have any dried onion so I just used onion powder and it came out wonderful. I'll definately be making this again!

Like another reviewer - long ago remembered and happy to have found!  The best with cukes! With a cup of mayo - I expected to have a mayo taste!

I needed dip for my vegetables and I was out of ranch dressing.  I don't know what Beau Monde dressing is so I just used some cajun seasoning. This is good.
