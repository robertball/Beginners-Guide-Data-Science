I found 2 large morels on my property on Friday and then another one on Saturday and decided to give this recipe a try. I  scaled the recipe back seeing how I only had the 3 mushrooms and I made a couple of changes. The morels could have withstood 450 degrees but the asparagus would have been too done for my liking so I chose 400. The other change was that arugula is not available at my store except for in the spring mix packages which is mostly spinach anyhow so I just used the baby spinach I had on hand. Lets face it, the morels are the star here so it really doesn't matter which lettuce you use. This is a good recipe and one I will make again if I find more shrooms.
