This is DELICIOUS!  A great summer recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to slice the zucchini and squash thickly (maybe 1/2 inch) so that they keep a little bit of crunch to them.  We ate it over egg noodles and everyone enjoyed it.  We froze leftovers and it was just as good after thawing again as it was the first time!

Delicious.  I didn't use the mushrooms to make it more kid-friendly.  Great summer meal.  Thanks!

This is a very delicious dish. I used sweet Italian poultry sausage and did include the carrots and mushrooms. I also added some salt and pepper. It is different enough from my other Italian dishes to be a nice change. Hubby and I really enjoyed it! It is very healthy and a good way to get in the veggies!

As I am vegan, I omitted the meat, used Portabello mushrooms, and served the cheese on the side. It was a huge amount served as the only dish, and every drop was delicious!

I made this as instructed, with the following substitutions/additions: ground italian sausage vs links, addition of a chopped green pepper at the same time as the zucchini, and home-canned tomatoes (plus Italian seasoning and a bit of garlic powder) since I don't keep Italian seasoned tomatoes on hand. My children raved about it, and enjoyed soaking up the broth with garlic toast. It was very easy,  hearty and delicious. There is definitely no need to add any salt, as the tomatoes and sausage add enough on their own.

I liked this - it reminds me of a mexican soup called albondiga (not sure on the spelling) I think I would prefer it with ground beef and more sauce.

This was really delicious, especially with sourdough bread on the side.  I used half the amount of sausage, and that was plenty for us.  I also added two bell peppers.

I have made this stew at least 5 times now and I must say, I can't get tired of it. My wife looks forward to it every time!
 the only thing I haven't changed,  always use the mild Italian sausage.  Some day maybe I will take that step!

This is a favorite at our house and anywhere I serve it except you have to add a jar of spaghetti sauce or it is too dry. Love this recipe!

I made this last night and it was a hit with my family. I had to remove the meat to  have enough room to cook the squash and mushrooms and carrots.  I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce to the tomatoes and served it over spaghetti noodles. I will make this again but probably wont use carrots.

Absolutely delicious.  It was very easy to put together (albeit, a little long on the total cooking time).  I would consider this more of an autumn dish were it not for the squashes involved.  Either way, this is one of those dishes that is fantastic the first time, and the leftovers are even better!

It would have been a 5* if it had more garlic. I used hot Italian  sausage.  We ate it over  quinoa.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I was worried that there wouldn't be enough liquid from the tomatoes due to all of the different ingredients but it turned out to be absolutely perfect. The only variation we made was adding some more cheese mostly because we love cheese but even without it the dish was nothing short of amazing. I would and will happily cook this again.
