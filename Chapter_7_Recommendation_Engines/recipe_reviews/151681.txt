This was quite a hit around here!  I used the "soup ready" cream of mushroom soup that had veggies in it instead of the usual boring stuff and added almost twice as much garlic salt and basil to spice it up.  I used California style frozen veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots.  My husband loved it!

SOOOOOO GOOD! I just tried it tonight and it is a great recipe!. I made some changes, I put a little bit more of milk ( 2% ) for make it less thick; also I put a few of very thin slices of potatoes ( I'm a very big fan of them ); and I used, also, little bit of salt and pepper.. Very nice dinner! And very fast, too. Thank you so much! This is a keeper!.. Monica

This recipe was delicious, and I would defentetly reccomend this to people who aren't the best cooks. It was so easy, even the worst cooks could make it taste delicious!

This was very good. The only change I made was I used FF cream of mushroom soup. I only gave it four stars because it could have been better if it had just a little more flavor. Overall though, great for such as easy dish.

This is a great, quick, yummy meal for a chilly night. I mainly followed the recipe, but I eliminated the bag of frozen veggies (didn't have it on hand) and I added some paprika (about 1/4 tsp) for some extra flavor. This cooked up in about 20-25 minutes--quite a relief after a full day of work! I also made some brown rice and steam-in-the-microwave green beans as my sides, and I sauteed some shitake mushrooms to add to the dish because I can never have too many mushrooms. The chicken was tender, and there was just enough sauce to amply cover the chicken and the rice for everyone. Delicious! This is not the first time I've made this recipe, and it won't be the last.

Not being a fan of cream of mushroom soup I used cream of chicken soup instead.  I like it better.  I used 1 cup of milk because it was too thick.  I have the original magazine recipe dated 1996.
