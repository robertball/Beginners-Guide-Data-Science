I give this 5 stars based on the revisions I made to the orginal recipe.  I finely chopped 1 sweet onion and sauteed it in 1 T of butter. To that I added the items as instructed with the addition of 1/2 C of shredded carrot, 2t of minced garlic, 1 bag of Kraft bacon bits and about 1/4t of pepper.  Also I added more water than what was called for bringing the total to about 3 C.  After the potatoes were cooked soft I used a hand masher and mashed them coarsely in the pan. Now I don't know how it would have turned out if I would have followed the recipe as written but it was really excellant with the revisions.

I did a couple of things differently with this recipe - I did NOT use the potatoes in the au gratin box (somehow it didn't seem right), just cut up a few extra potatoes and threw 'em in.  I used half-and-half instead of cream and threw in a bit extra so that it would have the creamy consistency I liked (less fat, too).  I also used a bit of leftover Velveeta cheese from the "deluxe macaroni" packages.  The verdict?  You can't get better than this.  I was pleasantly shocked (and VERY filled - this soup WILL fill you up, a bit of bread and this is just right for dinner).  Think I'll try adding a bit of diced ham next time.  Wonderful soup.  Thanks, Raymond!

A good recipe!  I read through all of the other reviews and incorporated several of their recommendations.  This is what I would suggest for improvement: (1) Use Half & Half instead of cream - it was a little too rich with the heavy cream, (2) Add sauteed onions/green onions and bacon for extra flavor, (3) Very lightly mash the potatoes before adding the cream/half & half - this gave the potatoes a more uniform appearance since you're using both an au gratin mix (slices)and Yukon Golds (cubed), (4) Season to taste - I used salt & black pepper, and a little bit of cayenne pepper, (5) Garnish with grated cheese, crumbled bacon, and green onions.

This soup was served at our weekly community Soup Night, hosted at our home.  With almost 40 people showing up that night, it was the biggest hit yet!  Requests came all night for the recipe.  We took the advice of another rater and served crumbled bacon and green onions on the side.  Also added a bowl of sour cream for guests to add.  Quite the hit!

This recipe is incredible!  I had to use Four Cheese potatoes instead of Au Gratin since my supermarket didn't have them, and it still turned out great!  I added bacon bits during cooking, along with a few other spices, and I also added a little Velveeta cheese - it's insanely good!  Have to use this recipe at my next get-together =))

This was simple and great.  My boyfriend who is always complaining about sub-par potato soups said it was the best he's had in a long time.  I made a few adjustments/additions: veg broth, small onion (chopped), 6 small garlic cloves (minced), processed the soup in blender, and half cup chopped chives added with the cream.  It was great great great! We almost ate the whole batch btwn the two of us...
Thanks for this recipe.

This recipe is a huge hit with everyone that I make it for. My mother, who is a potato soup fanatic and very picky about it says this is the absolute best potato soup ever. She has even bragged to other people that I make the best potato soup. That is rare (that she would brag to someone about me LOL). I did add a couple things as a preference thing...1) 2-very finely diced celery 2) very finely diced sweet onion 3)fresh grated baby carrots (watch the fingers) 4)half pound of diced fried bacon 5) instead of 2 Yukon golds I used 5-6 idaho potatoes 6) 2-boxes of the au gratin potatoes mix 7) 1 1/2 cups water 8) 1 1/2 cups chicken broth 9) 2 cups heavy cream 10) lots of cracked black pepper 11) 1/2 tsp minced pre-minced garlic  I sauteed the onion and celery in about 2 tbls margarine until translucent then added that to the soup. Yes I made a lot of additions. But the basic recipe of the box of potato mix and other base ingredients I got from this recipe

I took the suggestions from the other reviews started out by sauteing garlic and onions in butter then adding ingredients, and then adding some of my own.  For example, I added chopped bacon and cubed ham. I also tried the mashing technique just to get all the potatoes more uniform.  The soup turned out GREAT and I will make sure I keep this recipe around!

OMG! I made this and it was better than ANY potato soup I have ever had! I deviated a little from the recipe.I sauted a small onion and three cloves of garlic and added that to my pot. I doubled everything, using the mix AND the dried potatoes from the box, added a "broccoli cheddar" packet mix from a rice a roni box,  used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, and added another cup or two of milk. (I also added a couple handfuls of baby carrots coarsely chopped in the beginning.. it added nice color) I lightly mashed everything twords the end and it was FABULOUS! I will be making this OFTEN this winter! THANK YOU! ( i guess mine was kind of a.. cheesy broccoli potato soup.. lol)

Wow, this was really good!  I did alter slightly, I sauted some celery, shredded carrots, onion and garlic in a little olive oil.  I added that to the potato and chicken broth.  I used fat free half and half instead of the heavy cream.  I also used a hand blender for a few dunks in the pot (we like ours kind of chunky). After adding the cream, i did add a few handful of cheddar cheese.  Served with a dollop of Sour cream, bacon bites and cheese.   Everyone raved and I looked like I spent hours slaving!  Thanks!

Raymond Cooper . . . you are a GENIUS!  This recipe was so delicious and easy and my roommate claims this is the best potato soup she's ever had.  The first time I followed the recipe as written except I used 1/2 & 1/2 in lieu of heavy cream because that's all I had.  And I loved it.  Tonight when I made it, I added some Velveeta cheese that I had to use up and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  Each time I fried up some bacon and sprinkled that along with chives on top of each bowl and unfortunately I gobbled it up before I had a chance to take a photo.  Thanks again for a wonderful recipe.

As written tasted like boxed au gratin potato soup - quick and not bad but not great in my opinion. I   sauted celery, green onion and garlic as recommended by others. Then put in au gratin mix, cubed potatoes, white wine and part skim milk and part 1/2 & 1/2. Blended it with my hand blender. Then added the secret ingrediant - Franks hot sauce.  Yum!

Great soup for a quick hearty meal. Because of the use of the au gratin potato box mix and condensed soup it was bit too salty for us. I thought with the addition of water and cream it would lessen/cut the salt taste, but it didn't. When I started to make it I accidentally opened and began using a box of Rosemary and Herb Scalloped potatoes instead. I didn't want to waste the mix and only had 1 can of condensed chicken broth, so I used Swanson chicken broth for ALL complete measure equal to the combined condensed soup & water for this soup. Then in another pot I made the recipe as written for the box of au gratin potatoes. I did use half & half in place of the cream and stirred in 1 T unsalted butter into each. Both my daughter and I liked the Rosemary soup better then the cheesy one. I think because it wasn't as salty with the use of the regular chicken broth vs the condensed. Also the herb flavors were wonderful! It made a very unique soup!

I've always loved the white, creamy potato soup and this homemade version is excellent! I got rave reviews from the family! The only thing was the serving size.. 6 servings would really be half that.. it served two adults and two picky toddlers.

This was delicious and so very easy. I used russets because the gold potatoes at my grocer were not good looking and I used half and half instead of heaby cream to cut the fat and calories a bit. It was still creamy and delicious. This recipe is a keeper that I will make again!

I had my doubts about this recipe. Boy was I wrong. Wow, it is that easy.  I used Trader Joe's Au Gratin Cheese Potatoes mix. The smell was incredible.  Like Raymond stated I needed a little extra water and I added a little extra cream because it simmered for awhile prior to eating. This is a keeper. Incredible!  I also added cheddar cheese, chives and bacon as a topper.

Cooked according to recipe directions, and didn't change or follow other users suggestions.  Soup seemed bland and not very flavorful, although I added some bacon and cheese which was suggested.

Delicious.  Just finished supper and this is what we had.  I only changed a couple of things.  I did not have any chicken stock, so I used two chicken bullion cubes.  Also, I added at the end with the heavy cream one half stick of butter.  Delicious!  Rich, creamy, and VERY filling.  This could be on a menu at a restaurant.

This is the best pot of potato soup I have ever made!  Delicious and very quick.  I used butter herb instant potatoes which gave it even more flair.

Packaged au gratin is good if you want quick, but not quality.  I tried it and like homemade version much better.

The recipe as written is good but it's bland and kind of basic. I like to add celery and onion I've sautéed to soften them up a bit and some garlic. I've also started to used homemade chicken broth as I've found the store bought stuff is just sodium infused nastiness.

This soup was excellent with the following revisions:  I sauteed 1/2 small sweet onion and 2 cloves minced garlic in 2 T butter.  I added the onion and garlic, along with 2 T real bacon pieces, to the potato mixture.  I also used 2 cans low sodium chicken broth and substituted the heavy cream with 2 cups half and half.  I didn't use the potatoes that were in the au gratin mix...and I'm glad I didn't.  The soup was thick and creamy without those extra dried potatoes.

This was really, really good.  Even my picky daughter said so!  I used half milk and half cream (half and half) instead of the heavy cream.  It was still creamy enough.  I think next time I will try using just milk and see how it turns out.  Also...I doubled the recipe and found that it wasn't enough for the 5 of us.  They were still asking for more.  I think next time I will quadruple the recipe.  :)

I cooked exactly as written, boxed potatoes and all.  My husband ranted and raved about this.  It was a nice break from our usually Sunday night sandwiches, and I will definitely make it again.  This recipe is a keeper.

The soup was absolutely delicious and extremely easy to make. If you are looking for something fast, easy, and yet leave an impression this is the soup. I added broccoli for personal taste.

I made this recipe this morning. However, I have not eaten yet. Next time I would not use the box potatoes. I would use regular potatoes. I would rate this 4 stars.

ok, somebody help me out b/c I'm confused. Was I supposed to just add the cheese powder from the instant potatoes, or the whole package - potatoes and all??  I did end up adding the potatoes and wished I hadn't.  The soup was good, but I think it would have been excellent if you leave out the instant potatoes, but use the cheese powder, and double up on the amount of fresh potatoes.  Other than that, this is a good recipe. Thanks!

Very good and super easy! It's just as good and a lot less fattening with half and half, but that's entirely up to personal tastes. I like to top with sour cream and cheddar cheese.

Excellent! What an idea - sometimes I just don't see the forest for the trees and I always do things the way I was taught.  The au gratin mix! the ideas for variations are just rolling through!  I am making this tonight and will update after the family review - I know this is gonna rock though :) UPDATE: EXCELLENT - What a hit! I've requests galore to "PLEASE make again" This Rocks Raymond Cooper :) The family loved it, and I loved it - it was the au gratin mix that gave it the extra special kick for us, since we've always done it the same old fashioned way.  I'm making more to freeze this weekend with some variation, I'm going to add some premade turkey meatballs to some, some creamed corn to some, and some spicy peppers and a touch of hotsauce to what's left :) (thats just for me though :)) Thanks!

delicious!! I used only half the box of au gratin mix, and the cheesy mix made the soup extra cheesy I loved it! It did take about 40 minutes on med heat for the potato to heat through, then I mashed some of the potato cubes. I added shredded cheddar cheese and green onion and plenty of bacon bits and a dollop of sour cream just before serving! yumm!!

Sooo good! Used Idaho baking potatos. Used 3 cups water instead of 1 1/2. Finely cut 1/4 cup onion and cooked with soup. Added garlic salt to taste along with salt and pepper while cooking. Topped with bacon, scallion tops (lots of this) and grated cheese. Otherwise followed original recipe, stirring frequently.  Fast, easy, and really good on cold winter night!

This soup was very very good. I did a couple of variations though: I doubled everything except for the au gratin mix. I added a tiny bit of bacon grease,a handful of cheese at the end, salt and pepper, italian seasoning, half and half instead of cream, and "smashed" some of the potatoes in the pot before serving. We also served topped with shredded cheese and bacon. This tasted just like the restaurant!

This soup was easy to make and delicious.  I used fat free half and half instead of regular and the soup was still creamy and didn't taste low-fat.  I also doubled the water and broth.  I will make this again soon!!

Fabulous and soo easy.  Definitly does not need the full fat cream.  Even Half and Half is a little rich.  WIll try with 2% milk next time.

Excellent soup!  You can use regular chicken broth and substitute either evaporated skim milk or regular milk for the cream with equally good results.  Easy and delicious!

Very good recipe and looking forward to making this all winter.  I had my doubts (instant potatoes??) but I was made a believer.  Very good with scallions, bacon bits and shredded cheese on top.

This receipe was so easy and delicious!! I made a few changes.  I didn't use instant au gratin, I used the old box mix and just let it all simmer. I used fat-free half&half instead of the cream and added a pkg of fresh bacon bits for added zing - the family loved it!!

A nice change from the ordinary potato soup!  I used instant Betty Croker julienne potatos because that was all I had on hand. Also added onions & celery that I cooked in butter before combining ingredients.  Was fantastic this way and I know without my added ingredients it's fantastic too!

Good start recipe... but of course i tweeked some things. I started the same but added 2 cloves minced garlic and a little minced onion. about 20 mins in to cooking i started mashing it a little and added shreaded carrots.  No cream or 1/2 n 1/2 so, i just used milk... im sure not quite as rich as it would be. also added a roll of browned sauage... a complete meal in one! Very tasty! Great for cold nights!

I did not make any changes to the recipe. I garnished it with green onions and shredded cheese.  It was a fantastic soup for a cold, rainy day. My toddler loved it too!

I modified this recipe a little bit, but I think it would have been good as is.  I used two med. sized russet potatoes, a packet of diced ham and some shredded carrots as my "fillers" and used most of a carton of chicken stock plus some water as my base.  At the end I stirred in half and half instead of heavy cream.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I make this often and am excited that the weather has cooled off....soup weather...The only thing different I do is use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. It is absolutely tasty the way it is! On occasion I add some pepper, but our family love it! So quick and easy and delicious!

My DD requested potato soup for dinner; I wanted something quick.  This recipe sure fit the bill.  I used half and half as others suggested and loaded baked potato instant potato mix.  I also put ~2c. of the soup in the blender for a creamier soup.  5 stars from my DD as well!

One of the best soups I've ever made!!  I didn't have au gratins, so followed Cathalain's suggestion and added two extra Yukons and about 2/3 cup of shredded cheddar right into the pot (it dissolved nicely). I used a full quart of water and two big Knorr bouillons, cooked the potatoes until they were nearly soft, then partially mashed them (we like a bit of texture).  Meanwhile I added 1 tsp of garlic powder (to taste) and a few dashes of hot sauce. As the soup simmered, I browned a few slices of bacon and two boneless pork chops that needed used up. I had first cut them into 1/2 inch bits, then when browned I added them to the soup pot. (Next time I may use chopped ham or sausage, or even burger.) At this point you may add more water up to the volume or thickness you prefer, and perhaps stir in more cheese.  If the soup seems too thin, dissolve one or two tbsp of corn starch in cold water, and stir in while the soup is still simmering.  (There is never an excuse for thin soup as long as you have a box of cornstarch on the shelf.) Before serving, I added 1/2 cup of condensed milk and 4 oz of sour cream. This was absolutely one of the most flavorful soups I have ever tasted.  It is basically the recipe provided for us, and I am grateful for it.

The best potato soup I have made. I sauteed some onion, celery, carrot & mushrooms in a small amount of olive oil, then added the potatoes and rest of the ingrediants. Seasoned with garlic salt, fresh ground pepper and a little cayenne. I added some chopped bacon with the cream. Yum, thanks Raymond

I really like this recipe!  I have made it several times and my kids go nuts for it.  I do add just about 1 cup more water and season with salt and pepper.  I serve it topped with shredded colby and monterrey jack cheese and real bacon bits.  It's very quick and easy.

I doubled the batch and enjoyed with rolls and a few leftover biscuits. The hubby took the remainder to work for 4 lunches! He really loved it. I used scalloped potato mix as the au gratin was sold out and it worked wonderfully. I will make this again on my scheduled soup day. I love this recipe.

Awesome recipe!  I took some advice from the other reviews and used Swanson roasted garlic chicken broth.  I topped it with bacon pieces, sour cream, and grated cheddar.  My bunco group loved it, and so did my family!

Thanks for the great and EASY recipe!

I added some chopped onion and garlic to this recipe and thought it was good! I also had to add about two extra cups of water because the soup became too thick. This soup tastes much like a local cafe's soup that my coworkers and I have been trying to duplicate for years!

Raymond, you're a genius! This is one of, if not THE BEST potato soup I've ever had.  I added several handfuls of pre-cooked bacon bits and some freshly chopped scallions. Also added a handful of shredded cheddar right after the cream. I had to add a little more water to cover everything. I wasn't sure about adding the potatoes from the au gratin mix, so I did.  Might not do that next time...a little too many potatoes.  I will be making this again, SOON.  And again, and again, and again!! A meal in itself!

Quick and easy and a real family pleaser! Doubled the recipes and had enough for the next night. At my daughter's suggestion I added steamed carrots and broccli to the soup the next night and was also great all in one bowl meal. Also used only 3/4 C 1/2 &1/2 instead of 1C cream and turned out fine.

This soup went over fairly well, especially considering how easy it was to throw together.  I doubled the recipe, but I think next time I'll double all the liquid ingredients without doubling the potatoes.  That will probably keep it from thickening up so much when warmed over.  All things considered, I'll use this recipe again when something hot and nourishing is called for but time is at a premium.  I'll definitely add the bacon and maybe even some sour cream next time.

Delicious soup!  I followed other advice and skipped the au gratin potato mix.  I added a 1/2 stick butter and used 6 potatoes.  I also crumbled bacon onto the top of each bowl to give extra flavor.  I like seasonings, so I added garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  I think this would be fine without my additions.  I just like to customize my food.  Try this and enjoy!

I make this often. It's simple and absolutely delicious. You can "doctor" it up with anything that sounds yummy to you and it will remain delicious. Can't mess this one up.

I did alter this quite a bit, but was a HUGE hit! I used baked red potatoes, sauted bacon/onion in the saucepan first, added rest & simmered for over an hour and then added a can of evaporated milk and 8oz of sharp cheddar. This will for sure be a new family menu item :O)

WOW.....I have never tasted potato soup as good as this.  I will definitely be making this again.  My kids and husband loved it.  The only things I did differently is I added 1 chopped onion and instead of water, I just used all chicken broth.  I also didn't have au gratin potato mix, so I used macaroni and cheese mix.  It was wonderful!!!

Five stars after I tweaked per reviewers suggestions. I used all real potates and smashed up a cup or so then added back to the soup. I also added shredded cheddar, used milk instead of heavy cream and used additional chicken broth instead of water. I'd like to add a dark beer to this next time. Maybe some bacon per my family's request. Good starting point recipe!

Good for a quick soup.  The reheat was more like eating 'loaded' mashed potatoes, though.  I added bacon as well, plus I used fat free half and half instead of cream.

This is the easiest and creamiest potato soup I have ever made.  I will be throwing out all the old recipies.  The only thing I did was to serve with a sprinkle of Bacon, Shredded Cheddar and Green Onion.  This was even a hit with my 2 year old.

Does anyone ever just follow the recipe?
Well I did and it was good...but to close to just plain old scalloped potatoes...still it was good, but because I like potatoes so much.

I made some slight alterations to this great recipe.  I sauteed 1 celery stalk and 1/2 an onion in 1 tblsp butter.  I also added about 1 tsp of garlic powder.  I replaced the water with chicken broth and used half-n-half in place of the heavy cream.  I also used three medium sized russet potatoes.  Finally, I cooked a slice of Cooks bone-in ham and cubed it.  I added it to the soup right before serving.  I also sprinkled shredded cheese and a dolop of sour cream...DELICIOUS!

I took other reviewers advice and made the following additions: I added  onions and bacon bits. I added garlic, rosemary, pepper(fresh ground), and chives. Subbed evaporated milk for the cream. Doubled the water. It was still very quick and easy!  You could really play with this recipe and make it your own.My family loved it! Thanks for a great weeknight meal.

I added chopped broccoli and a little bit of shredded cheddar and serve with baked bread sticks or in a bread bowl. A great-one pot, no fuss recipe. Easy to reheat the next day too, just add more liquid.

This soup was so good!  And even easier than I imagined it would be - no kidding!  Instead of using 2 Yukon Gold I used 1 large baking potato.  I also used 1 can of regular chicken broth in place of the condensed broth.  Everything worked out fine on both accounts.  Next time I'll add some of the bacon in while the soup is cooking to marry the flavors a bit more, but as is the recipe was definitelly a hit.

I am QUITE impressed with the outcome of this! Both my boyfriend and I love potato soup.  I don't ever cook (I don't have patience); however, this was easy and WONDERFUL!  I didn't use scalloped potatos, nor did I use heavy cream.  I subsituted with half and half and canned milk.  I used 1 can of the garlic chicken broth and 1 can of chicken broth.  I sauteed onions for flavor, but did not garlic.  Since there was already garlic in the broth, I did not want to overdo it.  

I noticed some people who left negatives said it did not have much flavor or it was too runny.  To get rid of the runniness, gradually mix in a mixture of flour and water.  This will thicken it up!  Also remember it will thicken as it cools.  Adding salt, bacon, cheese, and pepper will add wonderful flavor!  Top it off with a little more cheese and chives and you are good to go!  Perfect for the cold weather.  

WONDERFUL!

Great EASY recipe! I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and added about 1/3 cup real "fat free"  bacon bits. Next time I will add carrots and celery for more texture.  Great Recipe for a cold lazy day

Even though I have an amazing gift of doing things backwards in the kitchen (and this was no exception), this soup turned out wonderful.  I used 2% milk and it was delicious.  Also added garlic, green onions and some red.  Got great results and most importantly - kudos.  Thanks!!

I simply LOVE this recipe!!! I have taken it to church potlucks and gotten RAVE REVIEWS!! I made a few "additions" that my family loved!!! I fried 1/2 lb. of bacon and then sauted diced yellow onions in the bacon grease then followed the recipe for the rest of the soup.
For garnish I include the crumbled bacon, green onions and grated cheddar cheese!! It is a meal in and of itself!:-) Double your recipe and freeze half! It's still delicious months later!! Enjoy!

I am a very picky eater and do not like some of the ingredients that I found in other potato soup recipes.  The au gratin mix gives the soup the flavor without adding the ingredients that I don't like.  The soup is one of our new favorites.  My husband asks for it every week.

This is the official soup for all of our church potluck suppers.  There is never any left and it is always a must have! I add just a tiny bit of garlic and put the cooked crumbled bacon in when I begin cooking the soup. Make sure that you keep stirring it from time to time after you add the cream so it doesn't stick. A great recipe!

I, too, used fat free half and half, and it turned out great.  Very easy to make and so satisfying.  Low fat shredded Cheddar and sliced scallions make this the perfect rich and creamy potato soup! A++

My family loved this recipe.  I made one change that made it even easier.  I used pre-packaged peeled and cubed fresh potatos instead of the dehydrated potatoes that came in the box.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I made this soup one day after work, and my family loved it! Even my 18 year old step-son who doesn't like potato soup loved it! I plan to make it again for a big family gathering this weekend!

Excellent! I add the cream during the cooking process and I find that it tastes even better this way. Also I slice the potatoes and find that they cook better.  Either way the recipe is great. Thanks Raymond.

This was very easy to make. I added another potato, one chopped stalk of celery, and about another 1/2 cup of water to cover. Boiled on high for about 15 min, or until potatoes were tender; meanwhile, I sauteed a small onion in butter and added it when I added the milk. Instead of cream, I used 1%, because that's what I had, and it turned out wonderfully. Very filling and delicious!

This soup is simple and easy. I didn't have regular scalloped potatoes but I did have Cheesy Scalloped Potatoes. after everything was cooked through I fished out about a half cup of the diced potatoes and blended the rest in the blender with the cream, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. YUMMMM!!!!!

Very Good!!! I also used half and half instead of heavy cream and some sauted garlic and onion.  Did not use the package of au gratin and added more potatoes and more water.  topped with cheese. Easy and I highly recommend trying this one!

Amazing!  I used a four cheese au gratin mix and it added a great amount of cheese to the soup.  I added a 2 more yukons and 3 cups of water.  I would recommend cooking the yukons first for about 15 minutes then add the au gratin mix.  Next time I will try with broccoli and ham.  I used half and half instead of cream to make it a tad bit healthier.  This will become a go to soup!

I am going to give this recipes 5 stars because it was so simple to make, not very costly and everyone loved it. The only changes I made were using half n half instead of cream and increasing the half n half by 1/2 cup and adding onion, green onion, minced garlic and pepper. YUM!!

So good!  My husband, who hates soup, LOVES this!  And for someone like me, who doesn't get to spend much time in the house due to work, a recipe like this is great because it's easy to make and doesn't require you to stand over the stove for long periods of time to cook it.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  I'm trying to be healthier, so I used 2 cups of skim milk instead of the cup of cream, and fresh broccoli and cauliflower instead of the additional potatoes (I did use the dried potatoes that came with the au gratin mix).  It came out crazy good.  There are tastier recipes out there, but for how easy this is, and how flexible, it deserves 5 stars.

This is amazing! I didn't use the Au Gratin b/c to me that seems like it's not a real potato soup. However, I added the little bit of extra cream ( 1/2 cup) made my own chicken broth ( 2 cups water + 2 cubes of Knox cubes of chicken) and although it's a bit extra watery, it's really really awesome. This is the best one for new beginners, like me. I tried a potato soup before but it turned out disastrous. Perfection.

So easy and so good!  Based on other reviews, I didn't use the au gratin potatoes, but just added extra yellow potatoes.  I also added salt, pepper, and onion and velveeta cheese.  Great Soup!!

Great recipe, very easy to throw together.  Did not have evap milk so I used heavy cream in its place.  I also added some fresh bacon bits 1/2 cup or so, 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and 4-5 pinches of black pepper.  I topped it off with scallions and it was great.

Thanks for sharing =)

This one didn't do it for me. It tasted too much like liquefied potatoes au gratin, rather than a hearty soup.

Aaahh! Good stuff. Did the onion and ham thing as others suggested.  Very tasty. Seconds served all around.

I made this soup for the superbowl for my boyfriend & his friends. It was a big hit! Very heavy au gratin taste so if you are not a fan, don't bother. I topped with crumbled bacon, chives, & cheese. Simple & yummy.

Don't get me wrong, this would have had 5 stars, but it is a good starter recipe and I ended up with something different from this actual recipe.  I added cheese, green chiles, and a few other things.  It was yummy!

So, I encountered some problems when I started making it because I had no potatoes, so I used instant mashed potatoes (4.8oz bag) plus the gratined ones. I ended up adding 1 onion, a tspn of garlic, paprika, celery (no more than a half cup / i do think that green onions would do a better job but i didn't have any :) I had to add almost 4  1/2 c. of water, and I reduced the whipping cream to 1/2 c. And it's still great! I really love that it was really easy and fast to do, just the thing for me!

This soup is simply delicious when prepared exactly as the recipe says. However, at times when I've been especially lazy, I have used a 20oz. package of OreIda frozen potatoes prepared according to the package directions. I just add them when I add the cream. Crisp, crumbled bacon and chopped green onions are a great addition. This is a recipe I use often. We love it!

I'm giving this 4 starts because I fiddled with it a bit. I didn't use the packaged au gratin either and found something called "Scottish Broth" in the grocery store here (I'm overseas)instead of chicken broth. Also, I used about 1/4 c sauteed onions, as well as one clove garlic. Delicious and easy.

Such a delicious and quick soup!  I use extra potatoes for a little more thick soup.  My kids love for me to sprinkle with extra bacon bits and use a dollop of sour cream and grated cheddar cheese and top.  Everyone says it tastes like a baked potato without the work.  Served with a crispy french bread this is the perfect weeknight dinner.

This soup is AWESOME!  I've made it throughout the holidays & it gotten rave reviews each & every time!  I just add carrots, celery, & onions to give it a little color & I've even slow cooked it in a crock pot for parties.  Easy & delicious!

Thank you so much for a great recipe!  My husband and I were searching for a "different" soup that we would both like (I am very picky)...We both loved it and so did our 7 year old.  We told him it was "cheese" soup because "potato" soup didn't sound appealing to him.
We also changed to half & half and we added bacon that we cooked (not imitation bits).
Also, we doubled the recipe and this was great for lunches the next days.
What a keeper!

My husband and I enjoyed this soup very much.  I used chicken stock for the entire liquid base as suggested by another reviewer and put dried, diced onions in the soup as well as some shredded cheese with the heavy cream.  Very tasty!

This is a great soup!  I did like another reviewer said and added fresh bacon bits and chives.  This soup does not last long in my house!  I triple the recipe and it's gone by the next day!  It's a perfect recipe for a chilly day.  Thanks!!!

Ok, after all of the stellar reviews, how could I go wrong?  I thought, I'll just whip this up in the slow cooker...
Big mistake.  After about 1 1/2 hours on low it was cubed potatos & broth.  (My slow cooker cooks very hot, so low is acutally medium high.) Anyway, the creamy, soup texture I was looking for was not there, so I put it into a food processor (which helped).  After adding the cream it started to resemble something edible. So I left it on "warm" for another 2 hours until I needed it.  The liquid cooked out and it had the consistency of grits.  (Being in the south, this turned out not be a bad thing.)  I brought it to church this evening and people actually liked it.  The taste was good, but the consistency was questionable.  That's the reason for only 2 stars. 
I guess I really messed this one up! After wrestling with this one all afternoon I'm naming mine AHHHHGGHH! Potato Soup.

This was terrible. It was watery and with no taste.  After reading the reviews I realized why everyone added strong tasting ingredients (like garlic or sausage).  This soup has no flavor.  I give it one star for easy; I'd give it no stars for flavor.

This is definitely easy and yummy!  It has a little different flavor than the traditional potato soup that I'm used to, but it's definitely just as good in it's own way.  I made a double batch for a party and put it in my slow cooker for 4 hrs. It turned out great!  Everyone loved it. I'll make this one again for sure. It's so easy!!!

I doubled the recipe. Sauted 1 chopped onion in a little olive oil, then added it to the potato mixture. Also added an extra can of chicken broth (used the kind with roasted garlic), 1/2 more water, and some carrots, salt & pepper, & some cayenne pepper.

We will have this a lot this winter!!!!!

EAT UP!

Yum! We just had this for dinner and it was a hit, even with my picky eater. I used two HUGE Idaho potatoes, which was more than enough, surprisingly. After the potatoes and au-gratin mixes had cooked, I added about a cup of diced ham when I added a pint (TWO cups) of cream. This made a LOT...more than enough for 6 hungry people. Will make it again!

Sorry.... did not care for this. Yes it was quick, but I think I'll stick with the tried and true method of making 'Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup' also found on this site. Very bland, watery, very tasteless. My kids, hubby, nor I was impressed.

Great soup!! However, I did make the following changes. I cooked cubed potatoes, broccoli, celery and carrots in canned chicken broth with the au gratin mix. I pureed the veggies but left some of the potatoes cubed. I also used half and half and added spike herbal seasoning. It was a big hit. My 5 year old son loves the potatoe cheese soup at a well known restaurant, now I can make an even better one at home!

I used four potatoes and omitted the potatoes from the au gratin package.  The soup seemed rather bland, so I added about 3 oz of grated mozzarella and 1/8 cup of dried minced onions.  MMmmmm...cheesy!  Three stars because of the original blandness of the recipe.

I fixed it for 25 people, not one bad review! I didn NOT use the potatoes from the au gratin mix, but did add shrimp and corn! I think that I would add ham with it next time! Also, I had boiled the potatoes before, that made it a lot easier!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe. Incredibly easy and so tasty. My husband raved. I added just a little minced onion, salt and pepper. I also think half and half could be used in place of heavy cream. Thanks Raymond! This is a recipe I will use all winter long.

A true family favorite! I usually triple the recipe and add chopped bacon, chives, salt and freshly cracked pepper in to the soup which adds so much flavor that there is never a drop left!

Made the recipe as written for a church event which required all soup submissions to be uniform.  Not surprised that almost all of the 4 and 5 star reviews included major revisions and/or additions to the recipe.  The recipe as written is incredibly bland although it has a large amount of sodium (from the packaged potato mix).  I agree completely with all of the reviewers who suggested adding seasonings, onions and other vegetables, and/or substituting real potatoes for the packaged potatoes, etc.  With these changes the recipe would rate more stars, as others have noted.

ALWAYS A HIT! This soup is not only a favorite for friends and family, it's also easy to make.  I do like to add more Yukon potatoes to the recipe.  On the side, I have grated cheese of various types and real bacon bits for people to top their soup.

Very very good!  I followed the recipe except instead of cream I used the evaporated milk.  I also added onion and garlic and bacon bits.  Then I served it with shredded cheese and bacon bits on top.  I would suggest doubling the recipe because my husband and I ate the entire thing for dinner with no leftovers.

delicious!  i sauteed some onion & garlic first & then added the rest.  used an immersion blender to make it smooth before adding the cream.  (+ used 2 cans of vegetable broth- NOT chicken- to thin a bit) very tasty!

Very good, quick and easy.  I added onion and garlic as suggested.  I also put some salt, pepper and crushed rosemary in the pot.  Topped off with green onions, cheddar and crumbled bacon.  Very good!

Was not impressed with this soup.  Potato Soup is one of my favorites, but this recipe didn't taste that great.  It was quite bland even for potato soup.  With the mess it was to make it and the flavor I will not be making this again.

So simple and so comforting.  As noted by others, I added one half of a large onion, 2 TB minced garlic, and at least 2 more cups of water.  A big hit that I will make again.

This was pretty good. It was easy, but it still tasted a little to much like instant potato mix to me. I sauted 1/2 cup of minced white onion & 1 clove of minced garlic, and then added the rest of the ingredients . I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian & I also had to add about an extra 2.5 cups of water.

Wonderful! Great for a cold winter day. Especially if you don't feel like cooking. This was very easy to make and was great. I used russet potatoes because it's all I had on hand and it tasted just fine. I added scallions just to add some green. I'll double the recipe next time so I'll have plenty left over for the next day. Must TRY!

I have made 2 pots in 2 days.  My 16 year old keeps eating it on me.  This is so simple that I make it in the morning and they have it afterschool.  It only takes 2 minutes to prepare.  Thank you for a quick but delicious soup!!!

I have been making soup for a lot of years and have never used a recipe except as a base.  This is what I did with this recipe, adding celery, onions, grated carrots, salt and pepper. I used half and half for the cream and of course did not measure anything using only taste and sight to decide how much of everything I needed.  The soup was loved by the whole family and with some home made bread was used as a complete supper.

I wasn't so sure about this recipe because it uses an intant potato mix and there are so few ingredients. Based on the high rating, I tried it.  It is fabulous.  I've never been able to say I've made a good potato soup but now I can.  Thank you for such an easy, good tasting soup.

I used roasted garlic flavored Swanson's chicken broth(a can and a half) - delicious-and chopped up an onion and threw that in too. I did mess up a little though. About 10 minutes in I thought it looked too thin and added in another box of augratin potatoes. Big mistake! It thickens up folks, take my word for it. It tastes really good though, my husband and 2 year old liked it too.

I wasn't sure whether to add the potatoes from the instant mix or not, so I did.  I used a larger can of chickenbroth (14.5 oz - Butterball 99% fat free), too.  While the soup tasted wonderful, it was the consistency of scalloped potatoes!  Next time I would double the amount of chicken broth and possibly add more veggies, like carrots and broccoli.

This potato soup is shamefully easy and tastes better than the famous restaurant one! I add an 8oz. pkg. canadian bacon, chopped. A whirl with a immersion blender finishes the soup, which we garnish with chopped scallions and shredded cheddar. Easy enough for a weeknight, yet tastes like a company dish. This is really a must try recipe!

I made this recipe two nights ago for a Soup Party! Everyone loved it, had seconds, and took home the recipe! I gave the left overs to my dad, and he loved it too! Very easy to make! I even used prepackaged Golden potatoes (already cut into cubes.. located near the bagged salads in most supermarkets)... SO SIMPLE and YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe! :)

Wonderful "base" soup!  I doubled the recipe and just served to 5 couples last night and it was THE winner!  "Zuppa Toscana" was the other option and this one was WIPED OUT. (I added a couple of extra potatoes and 1 cup shredded chedder)

Thanks so much!

This soup is absolutely excellent!  I like my soup a little less thick, so I used 14 ounces of chicken broth rather than 10 and also half and half instead of heavy cream.  It's definitely a hit in my newlywed house.  My husband said "you may learn to cook after all"!

Used Idaho potatoes , celery, onion, and carrot diced fine. sautee them and then add chicken stock and potatoes. Used Fat Free half and half and loaded baked potato flakes. Need about a pint and a half of 1/2 and 1/2 and 4 good size potatoes.

The idea is great, but I would nix the instant potatoes next time and just use the cheese mix and gold potatoes. Otherwise it was great and definitely filling. Thanks.

It was super easy. I skipped the au gratin potatoes and just used more russets (I don't have any yukons). I also diced up some ham, threw in maybe 1/4 cup cheddar cheese at the end. I don't use heavy cream, so I mixed 1/3 cup melted butter with 3/4 cup 2% milk, draining excess water beforehand. The texture and consistency is perfect.

I thought it was great.  I read what everyone else added and did the same..a little this and that!  I used a carton of chicken broth and 2 cups of water and did 2 russet potatoes and 2 Yukon potatoes, one carrot chopped up,  and 2 green onions.  Near the end I added crunchy fresh cooked bacon, cayenne pepper (just a dash or two) fresh ground pepper and I used a cup of heavy whipping cream and threw in a small box of Velveeta cheese.  Added bacon on top ... My husband and son LOVED it!  Yes a very heavy "fat free" soup.

This was super yummy on a cold snowy Utah day! The only thing I did different was I added a little onion and used half and half instead of cream.

Super awesome! Four stars because I changed a few things. Following other recommendations I added finely chopped/shredded onion, celery, and carrots sauteed in butter before I added the other ingredients. Tossed in a handful of chopped ham for fantastic flavor! I also pulled a few scoopfuls out, mashed 'em up, and stirred them back in before adding the cream. I bet next time I can add lower-fat stuff and the texture will be just as creamy and delicious! Au gratin, who knew?

It was hard to get the right consistency. I wanted to add more water, but did not because I didn't want the soup to taste watery. I liked how easy it was and the minimal ingredients needed. I think I am going to read through some of the other reviews and see what adjustments they made so I can get it right! Definitely don't forget the cheese, chives and bacon bits on top. Adds such good flavor and texture. My husband and I put some Chalula hot sauce or Tabasco in our individual bowls to add spice :) YUM!

This was very tasty.  I sauteed 1 clove of garlic and half of an onion at the beginning as recommended by other reviewers.  I added bacon bits and green onion at the same time as the cream.  Delicious!

Wow, this was so easy! To cut the fat instead of a cup of heavy cream I used 1/2 cup fat-free half and half, and 1/2 cup skim milk & it was still very creamy. Will definitely make this one again!

I have made this twice and my picky family LOVES it (even my 10 year old). I saute onions and bell peppers in olive oil and then add the ingredients and cook as directed (also use 1/2 and 1/2 like other suggested). I season with salt, pepper and tony Chacheres creole seasoning to taste. Of course being from Mississippi, i serve with hot cornbread. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I just finished eating three helpings of this wonderful recipe.  My wife had two.  I am sitting with a very happy tummy.  I used 14 oz. Swanson garlic season broth, two baked potatos, 1.5 cups of water, sauteed onions, and heavy cream.  All I can say is fantastic.  Also, I recently had a great Potato Soup at Houilahans Resturant.  This recipe is just as good to me.

Very simple and tasty! I added some bacon to the mix, and will try some onions next time. Wasn't sure if I was to add the au gratin potatoes to the mix, so I left them out. Turned out fine without them. :)

Very good for being so easy.  Thanks!  
I used 1/2 and 1/2, and I added the 'extras' like other reviewers suggested too.  I think it would have been to bland without them...sauteed onion, green onions, cooked bacon, salt, pepper, carrots...YUM!

This is some really good soup!  I did make  a couple additions: chopped up 3 slices of bacon and sauted it first, along with a handful of chopped onion.  Then did the rest according to recipe.  Turned out very good.  Thanks!

This turns out as a WONDERFUL baked potato soup. I did add a bit more cubed potato, and used more of a chicken stock rather than broth ( more flavorful)and added a bit more salt and lots of pepper. I put crumbled bacon, chopped scallions, and shredded cheese on the table, so you could add what you wanted. This is a keeper!!

The soup was very liquidy.  I did not know whether or not to add the potatoes from the au gratin mix so I didn't add them.  Maybe if I added those potatoes it would have come out thicker, how I wanted it too.  It wasn't bad but it tasted like a more "watery" potato au gratin.

I used this recipe combined with another I found here. I used the au gratin, chx broth and cream, but used baked potatoes and added 1c. sour cream, 1/2c. grated cheese and 3oz bacon bits. This made a delicious baked potatoe soup!

I made this for a taste test group... along with 3 other recipes..this one won hands down.  I then made it for a ladies fellowship of 300 people, easy to multiple the recipe, it was a success.  I continue to make this for my own family and they love it.

My friends loved this soup- I even messed up when making it and added the cream at the beginning and it came out great.  For special occasions I will use cream...but for every day cooking I will use half and half.  Very rich but worth it!

This is a quick and delicious soup!  We made this for dinner after skiing and everyone (including kids) loved it.  We added crumbled bacon and sauted onion.

Wonderful recipe.  Quick, simple and delicious.  I've been looking for a potato soup recipe that isn't bland.  Tastes a lot like what is served in a national popular restaurant.  I used Idaho potatoes and didn't put in the boxed ones.  Next time I will have to double it, it didn't seem to make enough.

This was very good potato soup.  I used shredded potatoes (hash browns) and it stilled turned out yummy.  It was quite a bit thicker than I like, so I might use more broth next time.  I also fried some bacon and added scallions for garnish.
I will definitely follow the advice of others and use half and half next time.
