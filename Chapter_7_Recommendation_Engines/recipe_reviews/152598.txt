This pie is super easy to pull together.  I made this at a family get together and my brother-in-law couldn't stop eating it! I didn't use a reduced fat crust since that wasn't a concern for us.  I have made this several times now.

My family can't get enough of this pie. My 13 year old nephew asked me to make it for his birthday party.  I normally use 2 bananas to make sure the bottom of the pie crust is completely covered.  I've also switched up the pudding flavors a few times, depending on what we had - Fat Free Sugar Free Cheesecake works well. I also don't use the cinnamon - the first time I made it I forgot to put it in and everyone loved it, so I'd hate to change it on them. All in all, this is a delicious, quick recipe the entire family will love!
