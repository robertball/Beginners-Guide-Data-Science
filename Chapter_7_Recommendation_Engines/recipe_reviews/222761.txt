good flavor but lots of work for no good reason.  I make a very similar Indian rice pudding that just calls for boiling the rice in the coconut milk and milk.  I've made it with arborio rice instead of jasmine and had no problems.  rice did not clump and no butter was needed.  I don't think the butter does anything for this and all the effort doesn't make it taste any better.

This recipe is excellent. I followed the instructions completely with the exception of replacing the mango topping with toasted coconut. 

My only issue, however, is that I felt there wasn't enough flavour. The coconut milk and vanilla extract gave it a lovely undertone but it was very mild. Next time I make it, I will be using coconut extract instead of vanilla extract, and doubling the amount to give it a stronger coconut flavour. Also, I think it would be a good idea to add a splash of rum or kahlua, and perhaps some raisins to make it a tad more authentic.

This is an awesome recipe and it is such a great option for entertaining. My daughter hated rice pudding until I made this now she tells everyone about it. I made this and added a few twists of my own but anyone that wants to impress please make this.

This was WAAAAAY too sweet for my tastes. Also, my rice didn't cook all the way through, so I had crunchy bits in my finished product. I DID like the the coconut milk and vanilla in this recipe, though, so I tried making it again starting with 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice (rather than 3/4 raw) and half the called for sugar and it was AMAZING. Perfect sweetness and consistency.

I made this the lazy way, just added the rice to the boiling milks then let cook approx. 20 min, then followed the recipe there on out.  Very good!  This is a tasty and rich dessert.  I had half of a can of coconut milk left and this was the perfect way to use it up.  Will make again!

This is a great dish! I was hosting an asian-inspired dinner and decided to give this a try as the dessert. . 

I followed the recipe to a T except for the use of mango and 5 spice powder to garnish. Instead of these, I opted for toasted coconut and it was great. My guests, who seemed a little weary of the dessert when I told them what we were having, said that they loved it once the had a bite!

The recipe as is makes 4 small servings.

I would like to add to my other remarks, if allowed.  Some reviewers remarked on the length of time etc.  I don't understand.  It is as though one is making a Bechamel.  Exactly the same process.  But one is not dealing with a roux.  The result is SO delicious.

Best rice pudding I've ever had.
I served it with a generous spoonful of balsamic strawberries and my husband gobbled it up. I plan to make it again and again and even though it is stovetop recipe, I found it easy to putter around the kitchen while it was cooking. Also, I served it in those Asian style square dishes and it was as beautiful as it was tasty.

I tried this recipe for today's breakfast. Hubby and I love it lots!! Only we agreed to make this as special treats once a while because its richness - don't want to get heart-attack :p For daily we'll use basic recipe of rice pudding; milk, rice, salt, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla. 

I made some modification; using pineapple instead of mango since this season mango is still so expensive here! Other than that, I use the rice called 'nasi uduk' from last night's dinner instead of cooking from zero again. The rice I used was cooked with coconut oil already plus some herbs (cloves, bay leaves, and salt) - it's Indonesian style, so I didn't use extra coconut milk anymore..

It turned out well and soooo yummy! Still have a bowl in the fridge for tomorrow's snack or movie time.. :D

I loved this rice pudding!! I remember eating rice pudding a lot as a child and enjoyed it. I am amaze of how great the coconut milk enhances the flavor of this rice pudding. The only other two ingredients I added was a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon to get it more flavor.

This was a delight especially with the secret Chines 5 Spice and mango topping! It does require alot of time by the stove stirring so i suggest proper preparation i.e a glass of fabulous French fruit of the vine!

This was a good idea, I enjoy risotto and rice pudding and this is like a cross between the two. I had the coconut milk but no regular milk, I only had vanilla soy milk but that worked. Didn't need to add much additional sugar because the vanilla soy is sweetened already. Next time I'll use real milk.

You *definitely* don't have to make this risotto-style with constant additions and stirring. Dump milks, rice, sugar, salt into a pot, bring to a boil, barely simmer, uncovered, stirring every 10 minutes, until it reaches your desired consistency. It's delicious and easy that way.

So delicious. I used cream of coconut, since it's what I had on hand. I also added shredded coconut towards the end. It's creamy & delicious. 
However my cook time was almost an hour, & ended adding more milk as needed. But like cheju John said it depends on your preference. Mine came out not so al dente, which is how I like it.

Very nice recipe for Sunday dinner with the family.  Mild flavor but can add a little more taste with just a touch more vanilla extract or by using more coconut milk and less regular milk.  Have recommended it to family and friends alike and all are very pleased with the recipe.

This was time consuming but so worth it.  The mango was a perfect addition.  I love coconut so might, as another review said, double to amount of coconut milk next time.

Jackpot! The result is a delightful, flavourful and very creamy pudding, well worth the time spent.I have made many quick rice puddings before, but was never able to get the same result you would get in a cozy Thai restaurant on Koh Chang island. Well, this recipe with a guidance of the great video gives you a very close resemblance in texture and taste of the product, and lots of pride in making one yourself. Many thanks to Chef John for detailed explanation of the process of cooking rice. I have never seen it done this way before, and loved learning a new way of cooking my rice. I cooked this pudding to take with us to a Vietnamese New year celebration - an Asian dessert was open to my interpretation, and I chose this recipe.

I made it exactly as stated and it was delicious! I had never made rice pudding on the stove before, but it made monitoring how thick it got much easier. I was worried about the coconut flavor being too strong, but it was just the right amount.

This is simply fabulous!  I made a double batch, and didn't have enough coconut milk so I subbed in whipping cream and doubled the vanilla.  At first when I added the sugar I thought it was way too sweet, but the next day it had toned down a bit and is perfect!  I have never made rice pudding on the stove top before, have always made the baked kind, but never again, this is just delicious, creamy and so yummy!  I will never go back to making it in the oven again, if I could rate this higher I would!

Lovely rich flavour.  Will not let it cook as long as the pudding solidified too much.    The sauce should be thinner than you want as it will be firm after being in the refrigerator.  Made the mistake of putting the 5 spice in the pudding rather than the fruit.

What really makes this recipe is the cooking technique. I used this with substitutions to make it dairy free and egg free for a company potluck. It turned out so good everyone enjoyed it. If you are having any trouble with the technique, look up this recipe's video on YouTube.

I used 1 cup coconut milk the first time as the recipe requires, and it turned out a little drier than my preference. So for the second time, I used 1.5 -2 cups coconut milk and I liked the texture a lot better. I used almost half much sugar as recipe calls for as I felt it would be way too sweet. All my family agreed that it was the good sweetness. I didn't have the mango, but I can see how mango and Chinese five-spice could really perfect this dessert. It takes a little TLC babysitting the pot for a long time (definitely longer than 30 minutes) but it is worth the effort. I will definitely make it again. Thank you for the recipe!

I'm in the Philippines where mango is "king" and plentiful.  Followed directions but did not let the pudding cool completely.  Cut up fresh mango for topping and enjoyed a slightly warm, delicious and very satisfying dessert.  Will definitely do this again!!

Great flavour, I substituted a pinch of nutmeg and went a little heavier with the vanilla.

I’d never made rice pudding before. It was a bit time consuming but very simple. The only reason it’s 4 starts instead of 5 is that it’s too sweet for my taste. I’ll definitely be making it agin though just with less sugar next time.

I am not sure what I did wrong, but after an hour of cooking & stirring, I would not call my rice "tender."  The flavor was great - especially after adding the egg yolk.  :)  I will try again, or maybe I will try Chef John's regular Rice Pudding recipe & just use coconut milk....

I doubled the recipe and it turned out great! I didn't have any vanilla, so I used almond extract and doubled it, as per other reviewers. It turned out creamy, thick, and delicious. Great consistency and flavor.

This recipe is not just wrong, it's ridiculously complicated. 1/3 c rice in all that liquid? R U kidding? I used a full can of lite coconut milk (1&3/4 c) plus 1& 1/2 c milk, no butter - there's already 3.5g of fat in the lite coconut milk. So, that's a TOTAL OF 3.5 CUPS LIQUID. Mix all the milk together at once. Add the salt now. Bring to a steam as per directions. Add 3/4 CUP uncooked arborio RICE. Or throw 3/4 CUP OF ARBORIO RICE  in with the milk, cover with a lid and slowly bring to a boil, whatthehell. No butter. Simmer 30 mins. which is too long for arborio rice - it's just mush by then. So use less milk for a TOTAL OF 3.25 CUPS and simmer 20 mins. With The Lid On. Keep the lid on tight for the entire 20 mins. Never take the lid off! Better yet, follow the recipe for Creamy Rice Pudding on this site... Or use day-old rice. Jeez, this recipe is for the birds. Omit the sugar if using shredded sweetened coconut in with the pudding. Use the whole  entire egg including the white as well as the yolk - what a concept! Still NO butter! Add shredded coconut before the COCONUT EXTRACT vs vanilla. And add 3/4 c raisins for crying out loud! Toasted coconut topping instead of, or in addition to, mango or pineapple on top. Add a splash of rum or kaluha.   -  A third of a cup of rice ... jeez! smh Recipe Is Not Worth It!  Creamy Rice Pudding wins.

Delicious! Did everything per chef john's instructions but added toasted coconut flakes in with a little coconut oil rather than the mango on top. I quite enjoyed the stirring process as well! :)

It was decent.  However, I did end up cutting the sugar to make it less sweet.  In my opinion it wasn't worth the time and effort, otherwise I'd give it a five.

Great recipe.

I used 1/2 cup of rice to get a thicker consistency and I used 1-1/2 cups of coconut milk to use a whole can. (I reduced the amount of milk accordingly.)

Because I made this for a Christmas dinner, I added dried cranberries for some color and texture. 

I wouldn't worry about chilling the pudding.  It was great right out of the saucepan.

Followed the recipe entirely. This is the very first time I am making rice pudding without condense milk; not going back to condense milk: this recipe brings the flavours, aromas and smooth taste I love!!

Delicious! I used the whole can of coconut milk (I used lite), and reduced the amount of regular milk accordingly. This is worth the work it takes to make it, and is the best rice pudding I've ever had.

Used mostly coconut milk plus a bit of coconut flavouring. Probably better without the extra flavouring. Also probably better with less sugar.

I only had sushi rice, and as with all the mango recipes I follow, I use rehydrated dried Philippine mangoes instead of American ones. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfectly! I thought I'd screwed it up because it was still a bit soupy and creamy when I took it off the heat, but after 3 hours chilling, it ended up with the nice thick texture I was after.

I added a dash of cardamom and tripled the vanilla! Delicious! I would definitely double the recipe since it takes a lot of slow mixing!

A good base recipe.  I used homemade coconut milk and only 2T of sugar in a double recipe (would be way too sweet with more sugar).  Topped with a dash of cinnamon (no Chinese 5 Spice), and a good teaspoon of homemade vanilla. YUM!

To die for... In my opinion! Don't be shy on salt as it enhances the flavours. It took well over 30 minutes to cook.  However the result was exactly what I was looking for.  I omited the vanilla extract and the five-spice powder.  The mango complements pefectly this pudding. I have had something similar at a Thai restaurant and been craving it eversince! Thank you for the recipe!

I loved this, as I love rice pudding, however, my hubby did not, (he isn't a huge rice pudding man) and my kids turned their nose at it. Although- that meant I got to eat ALL of it! - so no complaints :) 
It was a little more time consuming then I thought it would be.

I'm sorry to pooh-pooh Chef John's recipe, but I tried to make this three times and it never came out. After it was chilled, the rice seemed hard and the pudding did not "set." I tried cooking it longer, until we felt the rice was "done," and it turned into a starchy thick goo.

Ok..great recipe but too many pots and pans needed for such a simple dish. Great idea but I will use less pots and bowls... ;o)
