My boyfriend and I tried this recipe with a few tweaks and we LOVED it. We used cilantro instead of parsley, brown rice instead of white rice and added about 1/4 tsp of cumin. Sooooo good. I have already recommended it to all of my friends!

This meal was very good.  However, since I'm on a low carb diet, I used Taboli instead of white rice.  Still turned out very good.  Make extra stuffing so you can freeze it, then all you need to do is buy more peppers, microwave the stuffing mix, and stuff the peppers again.  Done in like 45 min.

These were delicious!  It calls for 1/2 pound of TVP....I used 1 1/2 Cups dehydrated TVP and rehydrated it before adding it to the mix.  I also added mozzarella and parmesan cheese to the mixture and it was scrumptious!!

Best stuffed peppers I've had!  I suggest Boca brand crumbles and I also used spaghetti sauce. One thing I'd do differently next time is wait to put the cheese on last.

These make a great meal.  I added a 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes to stretch the recipe to 5 peppers and to add a bit of zing.  Shredded cheddar cheese also works in place of the mozzarella.  A very yummy dish!

Not bad but I've had better.  They don't work the second day either which is something I count on with stuffed peppers.  They were mushy the second night.  Won't make these again.

These were by far the best stuffed peppers I have ever had!  I can't wait to make them again!  I followed the recipe and thought it was perfect the way it was!  Next time I will try brown rice to add some fiber!  I actually used a little less tomato sauce than it called for because I didn't want to open another can (I was about 1/4 cup short) and I thought it turned out great!

Substituted 1 cup black beans for the veggie protein and used orange peppers and a little fresh garlic.  Otherwise did exact recipe and it was deelish and looked so professional.  I cut the pepper tops off sitting upright not laying down as in the above picture.  My whole family LOVED it, and I will definitely make again!  I am a vegetarian and it is not always easy to make dishes that we all will eat and that are so satisfying.  My kids kept saying it was like eating a burrito!

HYDROLIZED vegetable protein is the source of glutamate, not Textured Vegetable Protein. TVP is a MEAT SUBSTITUTE. This is a VEGETARIAN alternative.

Delicious.  I used 1 cup black beans as my vegetable protein.  Did need to add a lot of S+P for flavor, but was good when I added the right amount.  I also cut the top off and cooked them upright.  Even my carnivore boyfriend liked them! :) Thanks, will use this recipe again!

textured vegetable protien (TVP) is a nice way to say "soy meal" it i sold in higher end and natural foods grocers. TVP is a substitute for ground meat. TVP has a meat-like texture and absorbs liquid and flavor from what it is cooked in.

This was yummy!  I used cilantro instead of parsley, leftover spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and threw in a can of diced italian seasoned tomatoes about three minutes before I took the stuffing off the stove.  Also, try parboiling the peppers before stuffing: wash and seed, then put the pepper shells into a pot of water and turn on the stove.  Let the water come to a boil then remove the peppers and let cool til you're ready with the stuffing.  The texture is perfect!

this is great i mixed in taco/chilli seasoning into my protein veg & cooked it with sweet yellow onion, mushrooms, and minced fresh garlic. Instead of parsley I used cillantro. I stuffed the peppers & covered them with shredded cheese - then placed them in a plan with a simple garlic spaghetti sauce. It came out awesome! I will make this again.

Excellent!  Used brown rice (heathlier) and cooked it in vegetable broth for more flavor.  To make it     easier I added the onion and peppers to the rice half way through the cooking process.  (used red, yellow, and orange peppers)  When the rice was finished I added the TVP, tomato sauce, fresh herbs (orgango, thyme, parsley), and garlic right into the same pot. I used more tomato sauce since I  did not use the olive oil. I cooked as directed and it came out great.  My meat eating husband loved it. I also used low fat mixure of a mexian blend of chesse on top.  I would highly recommed this reciepe.  It is an easy reciepe to experiment with and add your own touches.

I served these at a dinner party with a few tweaks at it worked out great! I already had a lot of cooked white rice, so I used that. I did not use vegetable protein. I also didn't use half of the bell pepper in the stuffing and made 2 from each pepper. Instead of tomato sauce, I used store-bought spaghetti sauce. I had to bake only for 20 min.

Had no idea what vegetable protein was,lol.  So I just substituted a can of black beans.  They were great and my family loved them!! Will make them this way all the time, since I already have a family Stuffed Pepper recipe that uses ground beef/turkey.  These are a good vegetarian alternative.

I make these a lot, using brown rice, and half peppers as is shown in the photo.  I put half a pepper in a small oven proof dish, and make as many as needed for that meal.  The filling keeps very well in the refrigerator or in the freezer, and the peppers keep in the refrigerator for several days.  If I put the peppers in the freezer, they come out mushy, but I just pile the filling on top and they taste fine.  Just not as crunchy as a fresh pepper would be.

I actually cheated a bit and replaced
the vegetable protein for ground turkey!
(I know... shame on me!)I also added 
some corn and some mexican 
seasoning....very yummy!  My husband and
kids loved it.

This was excellent, I added 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian sausage seasoning (available at a spice shop) when I added the TVP and omitted the parsley used an organic basmati whole grain rice, and everyone loved the flavor  of the dish, this is definitely one to make for company.

We made this following the recipe and it was terrible.  We're not vegetarian, but I don't think even ground beef would have fixed this recipe.  I actually ended up stuffing the last stuffed pepper down the disposal.  What a waste!

I'm sorry to say this recipe was just okay. It needed a lot of salt and pepper to doctor it up. I think if cheese were mixed into the stuffing that would also be helpful. But otherwise it was bland. Won't make again!

Use the same recipe but with red peppers instead(not as tart) and substitute brown rice for a more nutritious meal. I also sauted mushrooms with the onions.

To STEVE02A...
Textured Vegetable Protein (tvp) is merely cereal. I was turned on to it when I was having game meat processed and it was used in place of suet.
any store with a bulk health foods section should have it. its pretty common and not too bad.

Great recipe!  I used chickpeas instead of the TVP and left out the onion.  Will definitely make again and now I have an excuse to get those cute pepper-shaped single-serve ramekins.

Very tasty, filling and healthy if you use brown rice and definitely farmer's market peppers! The recipe calls for 2 cups of tomato sauce, which is a bit much. I also prefer mixing the cheese into the sauce.  It works well with Boca soy crumbles or I suppose you could substitute ground beef or turkey.

This was pretty good. I omitted the vegetable protein and subbed cheddar for the mozzarella. I also added 2 large cloves of garlic minced when sauteing the onions. I also added 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese to the rice mixture.

They were pretty good. I did have to add a lot of spices because they were a little bland.

This was a terrific recipe: filling, easy, and delicious.  Next time I think I'll use more salt/pepper, more tomato sauce, and add some mixed herbs for more flavour.  Even my meat-eating husband loved these!

I often make this with my own tomato sauce, or with colored bell peppers. It's absolutely delicious whatever I do with it though. Simple, yet it always delivers.

Used some other reviewers suggestions such as using a can of beans for protein and 1/4 tsp. of cumin and garlic sautéed with the onion. I will try with some more spices next time.  I used a wild rice blend.  I was quite hungry and thought the peppers looked pretty cooked at 22 min. so I put some cheese (soy cheese for hubby and I) on, turned the oven off and let it set in the warm oven for several minutes.  The peppers turned out to be a bit crispy still which didn't bother me, but I'm guessing they could've used some more cook time.  This is a keeper.

With the changes I made, I give this 5 stars.
I used Quinoa instead of rice.  Quinoa is very low in Cholesterol and Sodium. It is also a good source of Magnesium and Phosphorus, and a very good source of Manganese. One cup has 8.14 grams of protein.  I also used 1/3 cup of taco seasoning, one can of drained and rinsed black peppers and topped the cooked peppers with salsa.  They were delicious and very nutritious!

Good vegetarian main dish. I used brown rice instead of white and good jarred spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and added fresh garlic in with the onions but used everything else as listed. The dish was really good. The next day I sliced the left over pepper and put in a french roll. Tasted just like a meatball sub lol. Thanks!

This was the most bland recipe - ever.  To fix this I added a can of diced tomatoes seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano.  I also added extra Italian seasoning, some garlic, onion powder, celery, crushed red pepper flakes, and used real beef.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Since I didn't have any textured vegetable protein I used ground pork sausage because it has a nice spicy flavor and I thought it would go well with this recipe. It was so delicious, easy, and filling. I will definitely be making again!

I added diced tomatoes to this, as well as a mixture of lentils and barley, which works great as a filler for meatless dishes.  It tasted even better the next day.  Excellent!

this was really good.  I added a clove of garlic and put a little bit of white wine in the bottom of the pan before covering it to bake.  It was delish.  Held really well, had leftovers the next day and the peppers still had texture.

This is a good recipe to start with- but work to customize it! My boyfriend doesn't like tomatoes very much, so instead of adding the tomato sauce, I added about 2 tbsp of ketchup. If it started to get dry in the pan when I was mixing it, I would just add a little chicken stock. I also swaped out the beef for turkey. We like it a little spicy, so I  also added about 2 tbsp of Sirachi (Rooster) Sauce for a nice kick. Also, instead of letting the rice simmer and cook, I chose to use a rice cooker to fully cook the rice, and just stir it in at the end, making sure all of the sauces completely cover the rice. Fairly simple recipe, and delicious. I love stuffed peppers! :-)

I gave four stars b/c I did things different. All in all it was very good. I used red and yellow peppers (sweeter,prettier). I boiled the pepper halfs in water until tender,cooked the rice seperate. I sauted the oinion with a clove of garlic,1/4 tsp of cumin, thyme, oregano then added the tvp and salt and pepper. Stuffed the peppers w/cooked rice,topped with tvp mixture, topped with pasta sauce topped with shredded marble chedder cheese. Cooked until cheese was golden brown. This was the first time I used tvp and everyone liked it.

An instant classic at our house! Our variations have been brown rice and garlic for a starter. Cilantro, cumin,chili powder and some sort of Mexican cheese (asadero or queso fresca) for a Tex-Mex twist. Basil and spaghetti sauce and parmesean for Italian flavor. Our son HATES bell peppers but eats this like it's goin' outta style.

I used this as a base recipe and made some changes. I used green, yellow, and red peppers, ground beef, and 1/2 c. cheddar cheese. I used condensed tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. And I seasoned the filling with some paprika, chili powder, and salt and pepper. Very good and not too time-consuming.

I really like this recipe.  I had problems with the rice not cooking completely, so I started cooking brown rice separately and then mixing in the cooked rice before baking.  This has worked very well.  I also add chopped garlic and use orange and yellow bell peppers instead of green.

I used Morningstar Farms Grillers Burger-Style Recipe Crumbles instead of textured veg. protein for a more authentic taste.  This is a great recipe for vegetarian stuffed peppers, especially as we head into the colder months.

My husband and I couldn't get enough! Will definitely make this again and again. Only changes I made were to use red peppers instead of green. Added some garlic, cumin, and Anaheim peppers and mixed in the mozzarella cheese with the filling :) yummy!! Highly recommend!

We substituted lean ground beef for the textured vegetable protein and used about 3 cups of tomato sauce. We like it saucy. ??. Otherwise delicious!!

This was pretty good. It was the first time I tried these and am pleasantly impressed. I added about half an ounce of red wine vinegar and a sliver of jalapeno to give it some edge.

Textured vegetable protein is a vegetarian substitute for ground beef made from soy. You can find it in the vegetarian section of the refrigerated food aisle it tastes good, or you can just use ground beef I guess.

I found Textured Vegetable Protien (Bob's Red Mill brand) at the bake goods section in my grocery store First time cooking with TVP, Forgot to rehydrate  the stuff before putting in preparation  big mistake! Turn out very dry with no flavor.  Would try again the right way hoping it will would taste better.

These were absolutely fantastic and will definitely be going into our repertoire of menu items:-) I used the Boca Ground Crumbles...and two red plus two green peppers to add a little color. We also did not have white rice, so I used Jasmine rice. Otherwise, left it exactly the same. I will say that the prep time for me was around 50 minutes, but soooo worth it!

Very delish recipe! I made it just like the recipe said and it turned out perfect! I used Morning Star crumbles for the vege protein and you couldn't even tell it wasn't real ground beef. My hubby loved them too and he is a meat kinda guy. Can't wait to make it again soon.

I thought this recipe was really good. My household responded positively to it despite the fact there was no meat. I actually substituted the TVP with black beans and used brown rice. I also added different spices and hot sauces to make the end result a bit spicier. All in all, the meal was well received.

My boyfriend made this dish for the family and it was great.  (Even better the next day).  He used yellow bells, ground turkey and basil instead of tofu and oregano and brown instead of white rice.  We'd love to try it with the tofu next time.

Did NOT use vegetable protein...instead used ground turkey. Added some turmeric, cajun seasoning and saracha sauce to the filling. I also had used three large peppers and ended up needing the same amount of filling ingredients. Overall, good recipe...just add meat if you're not a fan of or have no idea what textured vegetable protein is. haha

This recipe was so delicious! I wasn't quite sure what vegetable protein was so I instead added tofu and it turned out amazing. I didn't have any Mozzarella cheese either so I substituted that with Parmesan cheese and it was still great. I can't wait to make this again!

TVP is crumbled up dried soy something..  anyway, you can get it at Bulk Barn (in Canada) and it is a great substitute for ground beef or turkey.

This was very good, easy to prepare with ingredients on hand. I made this recipe with home grown bell peppers and roma tomatos. I used vegan Chorizo in place of the textured vegetable protein as part of the rice ingredients. The Chorizo was well seasoned so extra seasoning in the rice was not necessary. Great idea for left over rice or bumper crop of bell peppers!

Simple, great veggie stuffed pepper recipe. It is sometimes difficult to find them without meat and the TVP (which by the way stands for Texturized Vegetable Protein and is a vegetarian substitute for meat) adds some substance. Added a couple of extra spices to personalize it a bit but otherwise good stuff. Thanks!

Great recipe!  I made a few minor modifications - mixed in some cheese with the rice mixture, used a can of northern beans instead of TVP, and put a little basil and oregano in the filling.  Will definitely make again!

Delicious, and not too time consuming. I cut the recipe to 1 serving, as nobody in my house is vegetarian but me, and used soy "ground beef" instead of TVP, and it was soooo good. Thanks!

These peppers are absolutely fabulous!  Being that I am not a vegetarian, I added hot Italian sausage in place of the vegetable protein. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. These are just divine!

I used red peppers because I like the flavor.  The TVP really gave it substance and actually tasted pretty good (and I'm not a vegetarian).  You need a lot more tomato sauce so keep some on hand.

This is a terrific, easy recipe! When I told my husband I was making Stuffed Peppers for dinner, he wasn't happy until he tasted these. It was a big hit in our family. We did use spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce because we happened to have some left over from a previous recipe, but I am sure the recipe tastes great with tomato sauce. We have tried other recipes with TVP in them and they tasted horrible, but not here. This recipe has definitely been added to our recipe collection!

I understand vegetable protein for vegans but actually u don't need it for who is not vegan. It should be used chopped onions (cooked in olive oil before adding the ingredients) and dill as well as parsley. I put dried blackcurrant and just a bit cinnamon for the zest as well. For saucepan cooking 1 onion chopped in olive oil until it gets golden color then add washed and clean rice and add a bit hot water it should be  half cooked. after that u can add veggies and dried blackcurrant and 1 spoon of tomato puree as well as spices(thyme,mint,blackpepper,salt)(don't cook rice with blackcurrant it will change the color). then u can fill the peppers with the mixture (can cover with tomato or pepper again)  put in the saucepan and add a bit water mixed with tomato puree again (will be more delicious).Shud be cooked simmer. max 30 min. It shud be eaten cold cos it is with olive oil and doesn't include mince meat. When you serve it you can  add some yoghurt-garlic mix on the top of it if u not vegan. I am a mediterranean person and giving you original recipe. I am not using any measure cos I am doing automatically but wanted to give you an idea. By the way when u choosing peppers in the shop look at the bottom and buy flat ones cos they need to stand when they cooking. Secondly, don't fill the peppers until its full leave 1 cm space  in case of swollen rice. Hope this helps!!

Even my carnivore husband loves this recipe.  For those asking about TVP, it's called "crumbles" by both Boca (c) and Morningstar Farms (c). I've been switching out ground beef for TVP for a while, and it was nice to see a recipe already using it. I used brown rice instead of white and sometimes I use my own marinara.

This was a delicious vegetarian stuffed pepper recipe! I used all of the ingredients except the textured vegetable protein because I couldn't find it in the grocery store; instead, I used stuffing.

I'm not a vegetarian either, but I am cooking for one. We didn't have tofu in our grocery store, so I substituted using black beans, I also added cumin, chili powder and cayenne pepper for a kick. The peppers are currently in the oven and it's making an awesome smell. Thanks for the recipe it was a help.

These are really good. The only thing I changed was I did not have TVP as I live in a small town and no one here carries that, I substituted navy white beans, I precooked them to almost done and precooked the rice to done. I left tops on my peppers, for appearance.

Had some excess bell peppers from the garden and decided to make stuffed bell peppers.  I used ground beef instead of TVP and used garlic spaghetti sauce rather than just tomato sauce and they came out great.  My husband and cousin ate the left over bell peppers and stuffing the next day for lunch and was still as yummy as the night before! Thanks for the great recipe :)

These turned out wonderfully! I didn't have the textured vegetable protein (and to be honest, I don't even know what that is!), but it tasted great without it.

This is great.  I replaed the tomato sauce by condensed tomato soup for added taste.  Textured vegetable proteine also called TVP can be bought at health food stores and at stores like Bulk Barn

I tweaked the recipe by using a product that I recently discovered. It's a "Ground Sausage Style" vegetable protein. Using this sausage alternative, it almost rivaled my mom's recipe I remember eating when I was a child.

Very good recipe! I made it with a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce. Also, I used ground beef instead of TVP.  Added 1/2 tsp of cumin for additional flavor.  These are my husband's favorite as it is something his mom used to make.

I used barley instead of rice, 4 oz of ground beef for protein, and shredded mexican blend cheese vice mozzarella.  I think the recipe would have benefited from some diced jalapenos as well.

This was quite good. I eyeballed the amounts of onion, pepper, oil, and veggie crumbles rather than measure it all out. I also added mushrooms and garlic to the onion/pepper mix. Will have again.

This turned out great. I used a combo of spaghetti sauce and tomato soup instead of tomato sauce and ground turkey instead of TVP, and I mixed the cheese in with the rice mixture.

Im only giving this a 4 because i changed it . I don't like to do that on my first try, but i had red peppers so used them and  i don't like TVP, so i used Morningstarfarms veg burger crumbles. I also went easy on sauce Since becoming a Veg. i haven't had a stuffed pepper. And these were good. It's funny because my husband a meat eater walked in and said it said it smells good in here and he looked at my dinner and said that looks good. He had a steak Next time i'll make them for both of us. THanks for the great idea

Using brown rice was a really easy way to make it a little healthier, and for other veggies, MorningStar has amazing ground crumbles that I added and made this recipe absolutely awesome.

(In response to Q) TVP: I have seen dried in a bag or in the frozen state sold as veggie burger crumbles. It is a good source of protein for vegetarians and fairly bland so it can be used in any recipe you wish, just season to taste.  I recommend using brown rice for the extra nutrients and flavor!

I thought that these were very good.  I used brown rice instead of white and wasn't able to get fresh parsley so I just used the spices I around (which for me usually means garlic salt & all spice sadly).  I also used the boca crumbles as the TVP in the recipe like some other users have.  I stirred in some cheese with the stuffing mixtured to make it extra cheesy because I'm a big fan of cheese.  Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe and I thought it turned out pretty well.  I will probably make these again.  Possibly with real meat next time. (I made them for a vegetarian friend of mine)

It was ok. I used ground turkey instead of the soy protein. My husband liked it, but I'm not much of a fan of green peppers. Plus I didn't find it had much flavor at all.

I've been using Allrecipes for a few years and this recipe was the one that finally got me to register to submit a comment. Delicious!  I added some additional spices, cayenne and cumin, because the filling seemed a little bland, and both hubby and I devoured our portions.  It's healthy, filling, and satisfying.  This recipe will be made often.  Thank you!

pretty good.  i used ground turkey and a can of diced tomatoes in juice seasoned with basil/oregano/garlic.  Still a little bland, next time I think i'll put cheese all the way through it instead of just on the top.

I added a half can of chilis in adobo and it REALLY took this dish to the next level in terms of smoky rich flavor. I can imagine it would be a little bland without the chilis/adobo addition. Topped with cheddar, sour cream, and hot sauce. Will make again with these variations!

These were excellent. I never have parsley so used cilantro.  Really delicious. I used some mushrooms instead of the vegetable protein. My non vegetarian, green pepper hating brother loved them too. Definitely a keeper.

I got 4 rather large peppers but made the stuffing per the recipe except for 1/2 cup of onions sautéed with the beef. Excellent. I’ll do this again!

I followed the recipe and loved it. I only changed the cheese. I used mizithra after they came out of the oven.

Easy to make, filling and satisfying. I couldn’t find textured vegetables, so I used vegetarian crumble intimation meat; the hubs loved it and couldn’t tell the difference from real meat.

I was  looking for a more simple stuff bell pepper recipe. And I found it with this one. What I like I do not have to the bell peppers first. I can just stuff them and put them in the oven.

Really good stuffed peppers.  I used fire roasted tomatoes with some seasonings and cooked them down.  Then poured over the peppers.  Topped with grated Parmesan cheese when I took them out of the oven.  Highly recommend.

I made these tonight. Instead of parsley I used Mrs Dash.  No salt. I also used pepper jack cheese and Italian blend cheese on top. I  used yellow, orange and red bell peppers too. My  son and I loved them. My 10 yr old granddaughter even liked them too.

Easy to make.  Needs a little more flavor.  I think next time I will use more tomato sauce, both in the mixture and on top.

I didn't know what "Texture Vegetable Protein was so I looked it up here it is:     Textured or texturized vegetable protein (TVP), also known as textured soy protein (TSP), soy meat, or soya chunks is a defatted soy flour product, a by-product of extracting soybean oil. It is often used as a meat analogue or meat extender. It is quick to cook, with a protein content comparable to certain meats.

Peppers should have been precooked. They were not tender. Filling overcooked by the time the peppers were tender. Would not recommend.

Amazing. I did make a few changes, some on accident! I used Uncle Bens 90 second microwave white rice and accidentally added the whole package :/ It would have been even better if I hadn't.  I also added some shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture before baking and a sprinkle on top of the mozzarella at the end. All in all this was absolutely delicious - even my 9 yr old who said it was going to be gross cleaned her plate. 10/10 will make again.

Substituted ground beef for the veggie protein and put jalapeno jack cheese on top. Would have been 5 stars, but nowhere did it say to precook the peppers. So glad I did because they came out just right.

This dinner was absolutely yummy!! My kids hate green peppers and this was a hit with them! I changed just a few things such as I did not put the sauce on every 15mins, I just let it bake through, also added added Mozzarella Cheese to them....no words on how yummy! Definitely NO left overs and so, so, so easy to make!!

I added some bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. I would cook these a bit longer if you like your peppers a bit softer. Cooking them in the crockpot is ideal.

This was an easy to make dinner.  I did par boil the peppers so  it did not have to bake as long.  I also added some fresh off the cob corn since it  was in season.  It turned out great.

I use a mix of red, green and orange peppers. Instead of cutting the tops off, I cut them in half.  I accidentally cut a pepper the wrong way, so I fixed it up and sautéed it with the onions. I used Beyond Meat veggie crumbles. They are made from pea protein. I was making these before a concert, so I wanted to shorten the cooking time a bit. I boiled the peppers in salted water for 3 minutes, then put in an ice bath to cool. These came out really good. I'd definitely make them again.

I used jasmine rice and seasoned with garam masala, cumin and tumeric. I also rehydrated the tvp and added in sauteed jalapeños, diced tomatoes and garlic to the onion and pepper mix.

This was a great base recipe but I think it would have been a little bland with out a few changes.  I added a bit of cumin and cayenne pepper when sautéing the veggies, I also added some crushed garlic.  Like others, I used brown rice instead of white.  I mixed in cheese in the mix as well as putting it on top at the very end.  I also mixed in tomato sauce (I used spaghetti sauce).  It was very good.  Very filling and very rich, will probably just make half next time for my family of two.

For four peppers, I would recommend using 1 cup of dehydrated TVP. I hydrated the TVP in 7/8 cup of vegetable broth and it was very yummy.

I used real beef because I had some in the freezer i needed to use at the time. I'll use soy next time. But I would make it again even just based on the other ingredients, amounts suggested and Instructions. I did use orange bell peppers instead if green. Green are too sour to me. I also added a scoop of minced garlic from a jar and a fresh chopped jalapeño.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because of the inattention to the amount of TVP. I like the recipe, however, 8 oz of TVP (weighed on a kitchen scale) would have ruined it.  However, 1 cup,worked fine. After learning that the cup measure is for liquids, I weigh most of my ingredients. So, on my kitchen scale 1 cup of TVP weighed 3 oz. I also mixed 1 cup  shredded cheese into the mixture, and I will sprinkle some on top after baking. I like this recipe for days when I don't want a heavier protein like meat.

This is the first time I've made stuffed peppers and they turned out excellent! I used black beans as another reviewer suggested and it was a great vegetarian meal. My kids and husband just ate the stuffing out of the peppers, but at least I got them to do that!!

I made this for dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  Stuffed peppers was my favorite meal, but since I stopped eating meat I didn't know how to make a substitute.  This does it for me!  I would make a few changes.  Parboil the peppers for a minute or two before stuffing, use marinara sauce (I like Prego) instead of the plain tomato sauce, no salt and Morningstar griller crumbles. I used extra sauce to pour over the peppers.

I used 1 lb of ground beef for 4 peppers, as well as a half can of meat-loaf-tomato-sauce. They turned out well. Next time, I'm adding a little cheese to my beef/rice/onion mix for extra flavor. Tasted great--we're not vegetarians, so these modifications worked for us!

Not being a vegetarian, I used lean ground beef.  I put oregano and garlic in while cooking the meat/onions/peppers.  I also mixed in about 1/4 cup of sharp white cheddar after adding the rice and tomato sauce.  Then topped with sharp white cheddar.  To cut down on cooking time, I steam the peppers in the microwave with a small amount of water in the bottom of the dish, for about 8 minutes.

We are about to eat them but have been sneaking tastes of it before we put it in the oven. So far it's delicious! We used vegetarian chili and added diced tomatoes on top and grated cheddar cheese to some of them. Most of the reviews have been very helpful.

I thought this was a great recipe. I did some tweeking with it and made it less fattening. I used 2% mozzarella and instead of olive oil, I used fat free butter which made it more flavorful. I also added instead of white rice, zattarain's yellow rice. Anyways, overall great recipe... Oh... I also only used one cup of tomato sauce, because I thought it was too much.

Made this recipe Saturday night and made the leftovers today.  Overall this recipe is very delicious and filing.  The things I did different (based on the suggestions of other reviewers) I added fresh chopped cilantro, 1/4 teaspoon of cumin, cooked brown rice and colby jack cheese to the mixture.  I also used a red bell pepper and a pasilla pepper instead of the green bell pepper.  I wouldve used a poblano but couldnt find one at my grocery store.  The pasilla was spicier and my boyfriend loved that one.
