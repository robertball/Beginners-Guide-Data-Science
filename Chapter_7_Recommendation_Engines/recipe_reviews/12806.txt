I am from maryland where we do seafood all the time.  every other night we eat shrimp!!  this recipe was basic and seemed bland so i changed it a bit.   i doubled the cream cheese, used only 1 cup of milk, 2 cups of mayo, no horseradish, 16 ounces of crab, 3/4 tbsp of old bay, and almost 2 cups of cheese for the top.  i didnt out it in the bread dish.  i simply sliced up fresh french bread and we used that to "scoop" it up. i baked it in a 9x13 dish for about 40 minutes.  it was excellent after the changes.....good luck!!

I found it to be "soupy" on my first attempt. I had only mixed the cream cheese, milk, and mayo so I tossed it.  I started again and only used 1/2 c of milk (I figured I could add more if it needed it). I used 16 oz of claw meat which was 1/3 the price of backfin meat and I didn't have to pick shells out. It also added a pretty pinkish-orangish color that was perfect for my fall theme. I used quite a bit more of the Old Bay.  I baked it in an oven dish and skipped the bread bowl and cheese.  It looked beautiful when it was done.  My guests devoured it and everyone asked for the recipe.  Thanks Kristy!

awesome crab dip! i tried it in the bread bowl but liked it much better in a small crock pot because it stayed hot and the cheese stayed melted.  i cut down the cost and used french bread loaf instead of the bread bowl.  the loaf went a lot further.

This crab dip is fantastic!  I've made it twice and both times the party-goers could not get enough of it.  I prefer it with crackers as opposed to bread.  I also found it better if you make it and let it sit in the fridge over night.   The Old Bay seasonings and pepper really seeps through. (I add more Old Bay than the recipe calls for.)

I'm from Maryland, and naturally, LOVE crabs.  I used 1 lb. (16oz) fresh back fin crab meat from the grocery store, and added MUCH more Old Bay ( I seasoned to taste).  I also equally matched the mayo and milk and opted out of the cheese topping.  I cooked this in a dish rather than bread bowl and served w/ french loaf.  I was looking for a good starter crab dip, and this was it!!! EVERYONE who has tried this asks for the recipie...and asks for a repeat appearance! I am now known for my crab dip!

This is a delicious crab dip, however, it can be a little runny.  We always add less milk.

Made this yesterday for a party and EVERYONE asked for the recipe!  Made a few changes: used imitation crab meat (3/4 pound) that I flaked.  For the money, a good decision.  Also added a full teaspoon of Old Bay and a touch of nutmeg.  More flavor, but not a stronger taste.  Made it all the day before (without the cheese) and returned to oven with the cheese for about 1/2 hour right before serving.  Served with garlic/parmesan crackers.  Thank you Kristy for a great recipe.  Made me look like a real cook!

This recipe is good... a few changes can make it even better. It is somewhat runny, so i put in less milk. Also, adding garlic salt or powder adds to the flavor since - although it is delicious - it is slightly bland. More OldBay spice also adds to the flavor. Overall, great recipe!

I found this dish to be bland.  May try it again, using less milk, more crab, and adding some spices. It also needs more color.

This dip is absolutely incredible!!!  Everyone at my party was asking for the recipe and just couldn't stop eating it.  It makes a TON, too! The prep time is rather long, but well worth it.  I added some minced onion because it seemed as though it had to have them.  I highly recommend this for any occasion.  It's good cold, too.  Thanks for sharing this!!!

I agree w/the other ladies here. 1/2 cup of milk is plenty! Anymore and you do get soup..  I used a can of lump crab meat and just shredded up with a fork. I too used a little more Bay Seasoning and also added a touch of onion powder and crushed black pepper. I put it into a shallow baking dish, (to cut down cook time) and sprinkled the shredded chedder on top. It was amazing!!!

This was a fantastic dip!  I cut down on the milk (only used 1 cup) and doubled the cream cheese, mayo and cheddar cheese.  I also added more horseradish and used over 2 tablespoons of old bay.  Everyone at Easter dinner raved about this - I'll definitely make this again.

We all really liked this recipe to start off with, but I have a few suggestions for the next time I make it:  definitely no more than 3/4 cup milk, 1/2 c mayo, add 1/4 c sour cream, 1 whole tsp of old bay and if you LOVE crab, then double the crab.  We did add it to the bread bowl and it was great!

This was a pretty good recipe. Definitely be careful with the Old Bay seasoning. It can be a bit overwhelming. I didn't put in the bread, just left it as a hot dip the first serving. I used the leftovers stuffed in mushrooms and baked in the oven. I really liked it better the second time around, the flavors blended well in the mushrooms.

The flavor of this dip was good. I added about 1/2lb. of fresh king crab meat to this recipe. I also used 1/2 cup of milk, and a lot more old bay. It was a little bland so I added a tbs of worsterchire sauce. Covered it with cheese and baked it in the oven and browned the top. It was a little thin when it was hot. Next time i may try heavy cream or less milk. Overall a good recipe.

I thought the recipe tasted great and all my friends loved it, but it took a long time to make and was very messy! Trying to whip together all the ingredients after I added the milk meant that I spent awhile wiping milk off my cabinets! But the result was wonderful.

I used an equal amount of dry sherry instead of milk, and it was way to soupy.  I ended up using twice the amount of mayo and 8 oz of sour cream. I also mixed the cheese in instead of putting it on top.  After these changes, it was still too soupy, so I added instant potato flakes, which thickened it perfectly.  It turned out so good! Try the potato flakes, it works!

Doubled the crab and 1/2'd the mayo. Even then, the mayo tasted strong.

This recipe is so easy my 15 year old daughter made it.  We left out the bread bowl and served it in an oven proof dish.  We made it again and substituted the Cheddar Cheddar for Almond flakes - just for the last 10 minutes in the oven.  Delicious.  A firm family favourite.

I wanted to love this recipe, but I didn't turn out like I thought it would. I did cut down the milk to 1/2 cup as others recommended and I used aged horseradish white cheddar instead of adding the horseradish separately. I even added 1/2 t. Old Bay for the flavor, but the mayonnaise seemed to be the predominant flavor (I used a good quality name brand, not the cheap stuff). If you like mayo, that's great, but I'm not a fan. I may try making this again but change the ratio of ingredients. There's potential, but it needs a little tweaking.

Thank you for this recipe! This is by far the BEST appetizer I've ever made. It was devoured within 30 minutes. Sooooo GOOD! Very easy to make too! I even had a request to make it again for Christmas, which I did. This recipe has been added to my Party Planning Menu. THANK YOU!

it was exactly what I was looking for when I was trying to create a restaurant-like crab dip. definitely don't be afraid of using lots of Old Bay.. just keep tasting it until it's what you want. I'm not sure how much I used but it was a lot more than 1/8 tsp. Also, it's pretty crucial that you add some garlic powder to this.. I just did it to taste. I cut the milk down to 1/2 cup, and I didn't top it with cheese because it was already so rich. really good.. you should give it a try if you've enjoyed crab dip from a restaurant before.

This recipe is absolutely DELICIOUS! I am so greatful for it! I made it last night, adding chopped celery, scallions, and garlic. I also used a Venetian loaf instead of French. I made it last night for my boyfriend and we finished the whole thing between the two of us. YUM YUM YUM!

I made this with some slight variations according to what ingredients I was lacking.  Was absolutely delicious and there was none leftover.  You've gotta serve this at your next party!

I used a little less than a cup of milk, 3/4 cup of mayo, double the cream cheese. mixed in 1 c of shredded white cheddar cheese and put 1 cup on top. I used 16 oz. of lump crab meat and seasoned the mix with 2.5 tsps. of old bay (I love old bay), a sprinkle of garlic powder and a little bit of black pepper. It turned out amazing!!

I saw that other reviewers thought it was soupy so I only used half cup of milk. And I used half the horseradish because I don't like that flavor much. Also I made this in a pie tin on my traeger BBQ. I know, I know! I changed the recipe big time. But it was yummy. Baguettes chopped up for dipping.

Not a bad recipe, not what I was looking for. I  had to add salt, to get a better taste out of it.
