I wasn't sure how the Caribbean/Asian blend of spices would work. TERRIFIC!! I was pleasantly surprised. I followed this recipe with only a few modifications. I doubled the receipe and cooked 2lbs. of boneless skinless chicken breasts in olive oil with the jerk seasoning. I used frozen stir fry vegetables to save time (2 packages). I also doubled the sauce with 2 jars of Asian plum sauce. Served with brown rice. Absolutely delicious! Will defintely make again, next time I will try with fresh vegetables. My son even ate two servings!

Found this yummy recipe using ingredient search: I was looking for a way to use 4 bell peppers in one dinner. (I doubled this recipe and...bingo!) My husband and I both really liked this. Thanks for the tip on doubling the seasonings; next time I will probably triple what it called for. Also, I had no plum sauce, but a Thai food site I came across suggested watering down apricot jam as a substitute, and that worked for me!

I made this last night for dinner. My family LOVED it! I followed the recipe and it was delicious. I only wish I would have doubled the recipe as my husband was looking for thirds! Thank you.

Good Recipe and quick to make.  I was worried that the two different types of seasonings would not mesh very well.  That is not the case.  The plum sauce adds a little sweetness to the tang of the jerk seasoning and works really well.

I used double the amount of seasoning specified in the recipe to make sure the vegatables and meat were fully coated.

I definitely will make it again.

Delicious!! And so quick and easy! However, be very careful with how much jerk seasoning you use... I underestimated how spicy the jerk was and put too much...my mouth was on fire! I was able to fix it and now I know for next time :) I will definitely make it again!

I used homemade plum sauce.  It was super easy to make and I served over white rice.

Tasty with some nice heat. I'm happy for a new way to use the jerk sauce that seems to sit in my fridge for ages.  I used boneless chicken thighs, and added extra veggies to the stir fry: Celery, carrots and broccoli. I had hoisin sauce on hand and used it in place of the plum sauce, and omitted the peanuts. Yum!

We have made this several times now.  It is absolutely wonderful each time, and you can throw in whatever you have on hand.  I figure if 4 hungry teenagers like it, then it must be good!  A real keeper recipe, and super easy too!

Delicious!! This was soo good, and easy to make. I loved the combination of spicy and sweet. I did make some changes only because I was trying to work with what I had. Instead of jerk seasoning I used Presidents Choice jerk marinade, along with cinnamon and garlic powder. I also added broccoli to the stirfry. I omitted peanuts, only because I didn't have any, but next time I will add them for sure. I will make this again.Thanks!

Unusual flavor combination but very tasty and easy! I suggest marinading the chicken overnight in jerk spices, lemon/lime juice, and soy sauce for extra depth of flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

It was amazing! Such great sweet heat. I didn't have plum sauce so I used sweet chili sauce and added a tablespoon of honey. Tossed in fresh broccoli at the end before adding peppers and onions back in. Left out peanuts (allergy). My husband loved it. My kids thought it was a bit spicy but still ate it all. Will definitely make again.

Writing my first review on this App, after trying, at least 100 different recipes...  This was, simply put, AMAZING!!!!  Excellent mix of flavors and sweet/spicy contrast!!!  We doubled the amount of chicken, so we also doubled the amount of jerk seasoning and plum sauce.  If you’re on the fence about trying this one, get off the fence bro!!  DO IT!!!

Excellent flavor!....couldn’t find plum sauce so used Hoisin instead and it was a great substitute. Might add additional veggies next time such as pea pods or water chestnuts, and will definitely triple the recipe so there are leftovers to be had the next day. Five stars on the YUM meter!

This is my daughter's favorite recipe.  She demands I make it every week.  Changes I made:

- I don't have plum sauce so I use apple juice 

- Add shaved/sticks of carrots to peppers

- Add scrambled eggs at the end 

- Add spicy pepper (jalapeno, poblano, etc.) to chicken

- Served over jasmine rice

First of all, thank you to the person who put this recipe up. It is amazing. My wife is Jamaican so was looking for some jerk recipes and this is top notch. Most people don't realize Jamaica has a large Chinese population (look up Tessanne Chin from "the Voice"), and this is actually an authentic dish according to my wife. I made some slight tweaks because of what I had available and needed to use up and it turned out to be one of the best meals I have ever made. Tweaks: Doubled the recipe except still used only 1 of each pepper. Added 1/2 tsp of garlic salt while cooking peppers. Added four strips of thick cut uncured bacon to the chicken cooking process and removed once cooked (done before the chicken). Marinated the chicken in 3 tsp of Busha Browns jerk spice (wet) for 30 min before cooking along with adding about half the jerk seasoning (dry) during the cooking process. Substituted plum reserves for plum sauce (the sweetness was amazing). And added a 5oz can of water chestnuts at the end when you heat the peppers back up. I saw another review that said it didn't have as much flavor as expected. Based on my experience the flavor almost knocks you out it is so rich and robust!

Fantastic recipe! A real crowd pleaser among a very picky family of nine. The only things I changed, was omitting the peanuts, and instead of sprinkling the jerk spice on top of the chicken and mixing it in, I rubbed each individual piece of chicken with the jerk seasoning and let it sit in the fridge for about twenty minutes before cooking- definitely gives it more kick this way.

Easy to make. Taste like something a chef made in a restaurant. So good. Only regret is that I should have made more

I followed the recipe as is. It turn out very good. I used a different Jerk sauce. 1/2 cup of sesame oil and 1/4 cup of molasses and 2tbs soy sauce, 11/2 tablespoons ground allspice, 4to 6 cloves garlic, 1 to 2 habaneros pepper, 1 bunch of scallions or  1 onions cut up, 1 bunch of fresh thyme or ground, black pepper. combine all ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth. pour into a saucepan and cook over medium heat until the sauce change color about 10 to 15 minute, and then pour over the chicken and vegetables. This is very good and spicy. lot of heat!!! I had it with jasmine rice.

This was the first recipe I ever cooked back when I was a Junior in high school. I'm now two years out of college and this has stayed on rotation as one of my go-to, easy meals. Thanks for this recipe, definitely one of my favorites!

Very good. Couldn't find plum sauce so used watered down apricot preserves, works great. Added more jerk seasoning once everything was mixed and some salt. Delicious!

Used a combo of orange sauce and Jamaican jerk marinade instead of plum sauce.  Will definitely make it again.

We tried this for the first time last night and it was terrific!  I followed the recipe pretty closely...I had more chicken than the recipe called for so I doubled the jerk seasoning and the plum sauce, but other than that followed it to a T.  It was so good that my husband declared it a "keeper" and went back for thirds!  This will be moving to my regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was great! I used a small onion and fresh garlic, and then added broccoli, carrots and zucchini, and more of the jack seasoning on the chicken. Only used one large red pepper, since I had so many other veges and don't particularly care for green peppers. Served over wild rice.  Delicious.  I just wish plum sauce didn't have so much sugar in it. I'll try using half the called-for plum sauce next time. But it's definitely a solid dish.

Great flavor! Added carrots this time and will try broccoli and snap peas in addition next time.
