This recipe immediately appealed to me, and I have to say it was AWESOME. If you have an extra 10 minutes and want to add real depth of flavor, let me tell you what to do... brown the pork chops as instructed but instead of adding the sauce right in, remove the pork chops to a plate and put one small-to-medium onion, sliced in the skillet (add a little more butter to the pan if it's too dry). After one-two minutes, add a container of sliced white mushrooms (has to be fresh, sorry - otherwise skip it). Saute until slightly softened, then add a healthy shot of bourbon or cognac to deglaze the pan (turn off the burner for a second while you do this for safety). Let this cook until the alcohol has pretty much evaporated/been absorbed by the onions and mushrooms. Then add in the liquids as instructed and return the pork chops (including any juices they have released on to the plate) to the pan and finish recipe as instructed.  I had Colman's Mustard Powder in my pantry, which is a very high quality product, so I opted to use this in addition to the dijon mustard to add another layer of mustard flavor. I created a little spice mixture of the lemon pepper, a bit of kosher salt, the mustard powder and some more fresh ground black pepper since mine was a little heavy on the lemon side. I rubbed this on BOTH sides of the pork chops and added it the onions/mushrooms while they softened.  The result was absolutely excellent.

My hubby and 2 yr old twins love this!! Instead of Dijon-style mustard I used honey mustard. I also added a splash of worchestershire sauce to the soup, milk and mustard mixture. I seasoned with seasoned salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. It was delicious!! The worchestershire kept it from being too bland. Next time I'll make it with dijon!!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this meal, it was good and easy to make. I used a grill season on the porkchops and substituted spicy brown mustard for dijon. A key change I made was to use a can of golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom. I also added mushrooms which made for an amazing gravy for the chops and mashed potatoes. Will definitely make this again.

This was yummy, but a little strong.  I think next time I'll use less lemon/pepper and less dijon.  My husband liked it, as well as my daughter (who doesn't like mustard!)

This is a great dish, but needed a few adjustments. When I first made this, I taste tested the soup mixture and didn't care for it. It needed something. So I added 1 tsp of lemon juice and let me tell you, it made a world of difference. Also I use regular mustard instead of Dijon style. But it's super easy, really moist and flavorful and a great recipe!

This is an awesome pork chop recipe!  Not too rich like other cream of mushroom pork chop recipes.  The mustard puts just the right amount of zing.  I didn't have fresh parsley - dried worked fine.  I was worried I should have mixed the soup, milk, and mustard before pouring over the chops, but they mixed fine together right in the pan and cooked up to a nicce gravy consistency.  Will definitely make again.

This was capital F-abulous!!!   I made 2 adjustments:  I followed a prior reviewer's suggestion about using Montreal steak seasoning in place of the lemon pepper.   Also, instead of 1/2 cup milk I used 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup half-n-half -- this made the sauce really creamy and rich and yuuuummm.   (just be careful not to bring it to a complete boil).    Delicious meal with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies!

Made this exactly as written.  Was incredibly easy to make.  The pork chops were so tender, and the sauce was absolutely delicious!  My 2 teenagers loved it!  This recipe is a keeper.

This is a great recipe that's easily made from the staples in your pantry.  It has a rich flavor that can be tweaked to your liking.  I add a little bit of Worchestershire sauce, but that's about all I changed.  It's become a regular in my dinner rotation, and one of my husband's favorites.

I would give this 4.5 if I could. The chops were  tender but without some added spices it would have been bland. My sauce wasn't that creamy but it was my fault- forgot the water. Still good though.

This is a delicious, easy meal that has become one of our staples - my partner and I love it! In our house, getting home late and having something ready in 25 minutes is key to avoiding the 'hangry' symptoms and this certainly fits the bill.

My daughter, who is notoriously picky eater, gave this rave reviews and says "make this again, Mom".  As another reviewer stated, I used Montreal Steak Seasoning on the chops and spicy brown mustard in the gravy.

This was delicious! I sauteed an onion cut into thin half-rings in the butter and a little olive oil for about 5 minutes before I added the pork chops (and didn't add any more butter), so the sauce had nice caramelized onions in it at the end. We had the sauce over rice and a side of steamed snow peas. Our guests loved it too! I had really thick pork chops (maybe an inch instead of 3/4 inch) and the cooking time (possibly with up to an extra five minutes) was great to keep them juicy.

I too substituded the Lemon Pepper for Montreal Steak Seasoning, I also did a few other subsitutuions and WOW amazing!  After browning the pork chops I removed them from the pan and set them aside.  I then added a small diced onion and about 3/4 cup of white wine (vs the milk) and let it reduce down for about 3 min.  I then added the Cream of Mushroom Soup and about 1/4 cup of non fat yogurt, gave that a good stir and added the Pork Chops back, set it to simmer for about 8-10 min.  I will certainly keep this in my saved recipes!!!

This is an excellent dish. I roasted the pork chops instead of doing them on the skillet. I then added the sauce for the last 10 minutes of cooking the pork. I had noodles on the side. My wife loved it.

This was quick and easy which was nice on a work night.  However, I think it needed a bit more mustard so will mostly add more next time.

I must admit that I didn't have high expectations for this one, but it turned out much better than I thought it would!  I made it exactly as written, except I used garlic pepper instead of lemon pepper.  Good but not wonderful. It gets 4 stars since it was super quick and easy.

This was delish!! I did have to cook mine a little longer than suggested. I didn't have any parsley, so I just left that out, and added mushrooms. Yum! Hubby really liked this one a lot.

My son and I loved this recipe.  I followed the instruction with the exception that I used a garlic/herb seasoning, removed the chops after browing, deglazed the pan with water and then threw everything back in and simmered.

We've probably made this recipe half a dozen times now. It's fast and easy for inexperienced cooks like us and has an excellent flavor. We love any recipe that has a cream of mushroom soup base. This is one that is great just as written but can also be modified in any number of ways.

since this was the first time I have made a mustard sauce I served it as a topping for the pork chops. I also added more Dijon mustard. I served it alongside roasted squash and onions and it was a big hit.  Next time I will simmer the chops in the sauce.

Turned out great! I did have to substitute milk with butter, but it still turned out great. Hubby said "You can definitely do that recipe again!"

Made this tonight and it was a big hit!  I had to make a few changes as I didn't have lemon pepper seasoning and no lemon zest - the horror!  So I substituted Montreal Steak Seasoning (1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp coriander, 1/4 tsp dill, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes).  I added onion, 2 splashes of worchestershire sauce, and 1 splash of lemon juice.  I made 6 pork chops instead of 4 but there was plenty of gravy to spare so didn't increase the other ingredients.   I think next time I will saute some mushrooms into it as well!!!  Will be making this often!

Made exactly like recipe stated.  Chops were tender and sauce was delicious.  The second time I added onions and fresh mushrooms with a splash of Worcestershire sauce.   Still delicious and tender.  Used sauce over egg noodles.  This recipe is a winner.

I made this with two differences. Instead of Cream of Mushroom Soup, I used Campbell's Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic Soup. I also used a secondary none pepper lemon seasoning to give the pork chops more of a lemony kick with out so much pepper. I believe this added an extra dimension of flavor to this recipe which I was hoping for. My family loves garlic and herbs seasoning in our food. We were not disappointed.  This was a great recipe.

Quick and easy to make, but neither of us enjoyed eating it. Won't be making again. Hides the taste of the pork chops too much.

I have made this recipe many, many times.  I don't measure when I cook after the initial test.  I would say I add a little more lemon-pepper seasoning and I know I add more Dijon.  This recipe is great with egg noodles or served over rice.  Very easy and very quick.

Super yummy and easy. I added fresh mushrooms to the sauce and served it with mashed potatoes. I did not have lemon pepper seasoning so I used about a 1/4 tsp of pepper and about a tablespoon of lemon juice when I sauteed the chops. Really a great and quick way to make a yummy dinner.

This was a surprisingly good recipe. I did ad some garlic to the butter just for added flavor. I may consider using a little less Mustard next time because the flavor could be overwhelming. All in all, a great, quick recipe.

This recipe was very simple to follow which was great because my daughter is learning to cook and I was looking for something she could make.  Tastewise, it was good but I don't know that it's a recipe that I would make a lot.  None of us finished it on our plates.  It just seemed as though something was missing.  If I were to make it again, I would definitely have to tweak the recipe.

I personally liked the recipe very much-I'm a fan of cream of mushroom soup and love to use it while cooking. My husband on the other hand didn't like it very much. He's not sure what he didn't like about it, since he likes cream sauces too. I might try to make this again to figure out what was the problem and repost my review.

Made as directed except I used chives instead of parsley which went with it nicely. Excellent flavor in the sauce and my wife enjoyed it even though she doesn't like mustard. Will make it again for sure.

This was a great recipe. My husband loved it! They were really easy to make and came out tender and flavorful. I found that they had a very nice crust of flavor on the top because of the browning. Next time I will serve it with some brown rice, too. Thanks!

I normally don't like pork much, but this was really yummy. I didn't have any parsley, but followed the rest and served it with potatoes and broccoli. We'll make it again!

Very good, we grilled the chops and made the sauce on the side in a saucepan.  The sauce also works well over mashed potatoes.  Will def. make again.

This was an easy recipe to make with good flavors. I added fresh mushrooms when I added the sauce and did not use any butter. My husband, 2 year old daughter and I loved this recipe.I gave it 4 stars because I thought that it had a slight taste of the can. Otherwise it was delicious. I also used rice and a mix of frozen veggies.
