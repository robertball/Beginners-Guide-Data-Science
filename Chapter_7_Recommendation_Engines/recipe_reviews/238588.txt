First let me say the only thing I changed in the recipe is that I used 6 ounces of bulk chorizo because that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and technique exactly. This recipe was awesome! I was a little worried about shrimp being overdone at 20 minutes in the oven, it was fine but don't leave it in any longer. Don't skimp on simmering the shells with the broth, this added a lot of flavor! Saffron is pricey but please invest if you can. It does make a difference. The rice in the dish comes out slightly firm, it is not runny or creamy like risotto, it is nice and fluffy. I used a cast iron skillet. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

This base paella recipe was fantastic.  The use of shrimp stock from the skins I think was the most important thing and a technique I'm happy to add to repertoire.  I didn't bother with the saffron and ended up using long grain rice which resulted in a different cooking time.  I also used andouille sausage which I think was perfect.  I will be adding this recipe to my list of dinner meals and will likely add mussels, clams, and squid in the future.

This was the first time I made paella and turned out wonderful! Followed the recipe almost exactly, only used green bell pepper instead of red, and kielbasa sausage for the Spanish chorizo.  
Also, I had to add a little water after taking it out of the oven (but maybe that was because I ended up with a bit less than the 2 cups of prepared broth it calls for in the beginning).  I then covered my pan with its lid and cooked it on low for about 5 minutes, and got those bits of golden caramelized rice Chef John's mentions in the video.  This was really easy for a very tasty meal, and also the cleanup was a breeze :) Thank you, Chef John!
Update: the second & third times I made this (within a month ;) ), I added 1 lb. shoulder pork in pieces (previously cooked in a separate pan and seasoned with salt & pepper).  I also didn't have chicken broth so used water with 1/4 onion, 3 cloves of garlic and 1/2 tsp salt.  I also doubled the saffron (used 1 tsp)., added a handful of green beans and used 1 whole cup of peas, it was delicious!

I have never had Paella before so I am not sure what it is supposed to taste like.  I used both Saffron (more than required) and smoked paprika and found it bland. I didn't change anything else except for the shrimp skins - I didn't have any.  That may be the difference. Other than that everything cooked perfectly with the time given. Overall I will give it a 4 and give it one more go with the shrimp stock.

My whole family loved it! I did use Pepperoni instead of the recipe sausage. I also used 2 lbs of medium shrimp instead of Jumbo shrimp.
I used my regular "Jasmine" white rice and used their required amount of liquid. I think it took a little longer than your time required to soften after baking.  
     The only reason for the changes was I didn't have all of the ingredients.  Ti came out excellent & I will surely make it again

I followed this recipe exactly as written and my rice didn't cook in the time specified and my shrimp was way overcooked. I thought 20 minutes in the oven with shrimp was a little too long. I should have added them in the last 10 minutes of cooking. The flavor was great with the saffron and shrimp tail broth that was made.

We made this recipe for the first time last night!  Since we were unable to purchase jumbo shrimp, we went with 1-1/4 lbs of the smaller ones.  The chorizo we bought was not the kind you can slice, but we made do.  I think the part that really sets this recipe apart is using the shrimp shells in the saffron broth....it just adds more flavor!  We also added some squid rounds.  We managed to get the rice just right, with the nice carmelization on the bottom and a little around the edges.  With the smaller shrimp, we were worried about over-cooking them, so we waited until the last 5 minutes in the oven to add them.  This recipes was the perfect size for our new Lodge carbon paella pan, and we will definitely be cooking this again....maybe adding some more shellfish!  Thanks, Chef John!

Delicious!  Kid's loved it.  I didn't  have fresh shrimp tails, so I just cooked the saffron with garlic cloves, celery leaf and the chicken stock just to give it a bit of a boost of flavor while I warmed the broth.  With food allergies we can't do chorizo, so I sliced sausages instead, and then also cooked 2 cubed chicken breasts (Seasoned with garlic, paprika, salt and pepper).   I cheated with frozen pepper strips, and didn't put the shrimp on until after it came out of the oven.  Also didn't have arborio rice, so I used sushi rice and it was fine.  Just goes to show how versatile this recipe is!   Everyone proclaimed it delicious and my 14 yo (allergic to eggs, dairy, wheat, nuts, soy, corn) proclaimed it one of her new favorite meals and was mad I hadn't ever made it before.  ha!   Oh, and the video from Chef John was hilarious.

I have made this many times and each time it is absolutely perfect.  The only thing I've added on occasion is a cut up chicken breast.  I've used different types of choriza - some spicy some mild.  When using the mild, I cut back on the spicy paprika.  It is a great recipe for a busy weekday dinner meal.

I don't think I have ever made a dish in my life more perfect.  I am a man. I was single for 40 years before I met my wife. I made what sounded good to me. I am 60 years old.  before my wife had a stroke 8 years ago we took turns, I cooked the meals half the time. I have cooked all the meals since then.  The meals that count, that I can take some time with are usually Sunday night.  The store I shop at doesn't sell Saffron, I had to go to a second store to get the saffron. I couldn't fine the arborior rice so I used Jasmine rice.  I have never cooked with saffron or used the shrimp shells to make a stock. I make decent meals every day but this was off the charts .  Thank you.

A great introduction to one of Spain's best dishes. Chef John is a wonderful cooking teacher. I've made this many times to rave reviews. I've added chicken thighs, calamari, and fresh mussels by dividing Chef John's original recipe between two paella pans. Great for social occasions as it feeds a crowd. Have some good crusty bread, bit of wine, and a citrus dessert and your guests will be delighted. Less complicated than 'true' paella recipes, but just about as tasty.

Love this recipe. I didn't have sausage but I had scallops. I used shrimp and scallops and it turned out amazing. Very easy to make. I will definitely make this again. Loved it.

My boyfriend used to dislike it when I made paella (from a box), it was always laking in flavor and either too dry or soggy. Today I tried this one: really easy, just pop it in the oven, and out comes delicious paella! Everyone loved it. Also the instructions video is really funny!

Excellent recipe.  Please note that the instructions for what to do with the paprika aren't among the directions.  I guessed.  REALLY tasty and the timing on the rice was excellent, which is a problem in many other recipes I've tried.  Highly recommended with a white Rioja!

Liked it, and I managed to crust the bottom of the rice, which does add a nice depth of flavor and texture. Used Bomba rice, took a bit longer at the end (covered and cooked about 8 min total). Definitely benefits from the suggested garnishes, which aren't mentioned in the formal recipe, so don't forget those! Needs acidity and fat in particular, so olive oil and lemon. Am interested in trying a more advanced version... are you going to do one, chef?

this is one of my favorite dishes to make. I know a lot of people make substitution but I highly recommend keeping it as is. The proper rice and saffron are really important to get that authentic texture taste and look. I use johnsonville chorizo because I really like the sausage links. if I could find actual chorizo that wasnt bulk I would use that. but the bulk corizo doesnt work nearly as well as a good sausage link. I tried it with clams once but it became too fishy. and as many have mentioned boiling the shells in broth is a must. I have put the shrimp in as directed and a little later another time but either way seemed to work fine. I'm hosting a movie night tomorrow and I know I'm going to blow everyone's socks off with this really delicious meal.

Made it exactly as the recipe describes. Please follow the shrimp shell/saffron part of the recipe it REALLY does make a difference. The flavors are heavenly!

Excellent Recipe! Thank you Chef John for simplifying this dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written and my Paella turned out fantastic. I used a Cast Iron skillet and Used Arborio rice, and did not have any issues with the rice not being done or cooked thoroughly.
This is an excellent quick recipe, next time I may add some shredded chicken, or chicken thighs for a more original dish.

Delicious! I didn’t change a thing. Mine required extra water because the rice wasn’t ready so I added some hot broth, turned off the oven and let it rest for ten minutes. The next time I will add the shrimp at the end so they aren’t cooked so much. Will definitely make again!

I have tried multiple pallea recipes and this is my favorite so far. The broth cooked with the shells and saffron adds a lot of flavor. However, the shrimp were way (!!) overcooked after 20 min in the oven. I should have followed my gut on that one. Next time I will tuck in the shrimp only a few min before the end. Other than that--awesome recipe!

The recipe gets 5 stars, but my execution for a first time does not. Needed larger fresh shrimp (I used frozen) and my family said "More meat!" Need to be very cautious with the cayenne or it becomes just "hot", not flavorful.

So, I made this dish and, it being my first attempt, was not bad. As you can see by my picture, the rice got extra toasted. It wasn't the kind of toasty that one would expect from this particular dish. It was from the fact when I poured my saffron broth into the rice, I had haphazardly poured it straight into the pan causing the rice grains to float to the top. When I placed the pan into the oven, some of the grains was above the broth which dried it out faster. Also, the chicken broth was already seasoned and adding extra salt made it salty.

The first few times I made this amazing dish it was NOT quick or easy! But the flavor explosion that resulted was over the top, so much that I’d start craving it every few weeks. I’ve made it about a dozen times now and it really is easy and quick-ish.

Followed recipe exactly except I also sprinked in some Old Bay seasoning to the shrip shells as they cooked.  Increased 50% (9 servings) and turned out perfect. This is honestly the best paella I have ever had! Complements to the Chef (John)!

I added paprika marinated chicken just before the sausage and lemon zest to final product.  It turned out a little dryer that I expected (but probably due to delay in getting family to sit down to table while it was in final stovetop step).  Still, it was extremely tasty.  Will definitely make it again.

We used our local (AL) Conecuh sausage, added a bit more liquid at the end and stirred all the mostly cooked meat except the shrimp into the rice and then placed the rice around the top, covered and cooked for about the last 7 minutes. It was perfect.

So Paprika was not mentioned in the recipe steps so I threw it in with the onions but would have probably been good sprinkled on top which is where it probably should have been.  Aside from that, I made it exactly as directed and it was perfect!  Best Paella I've made yet!

This was awesome! The only changes  made was to follow the suggestion of others and wait to put the shrimp in until the last ten minutes  and I added chicken. I did forget the cayenne pepper, but that turned out for the better because it was plenty spicy with the chorizo. 

I definitely will be making it again/ Next time I want to try adding other seafood.

I love Chef John’s recipes but this one turned out poorly.  I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed.  The shrimp had no flavor and was rubbery.   The dish tasted more like a cajun dirty rice.

I'd been wanting to make Paella for yeeeeaaaarrrs but I always thought it was a lot of work. This was super easy and tasted so good we polished off everything in one fail swoop. 
I was worried that the rice would be too dry or undercooked (didn't happen) and I was worried the prawns (yes I am Australian) would be tough so yes, ok I waited till the last 10 minutes to throw them in. Worked a treat, will make again... perhaps tomorrow haha!

This was amazing! I made this as written with the exception of adding blue mussels for the last 10 minutes of oven time.  The next time I will add a little grated tomato for a more authentic dish. Thanks, Chef John, for another great recipe.

Chef John this is an absolute Awesome Paella recipe, 1st time made as directed and as you mentioned later recipes, utilized chicken thighs, scallops, mussels and squid we"ve added to change it up as the meal warranted. This cook out I used my Home made chicken broth with the shrimp skin, and saffron....... the broth had rosemary, thyme, cumin, all from another recipe that required par boiled chicken and from this I saved around 12 cups of broth. Anyhow  this paella version had fried crispy calamari, Spanish chorizo and jumbo shrimp, missed out on the fresh mussels oh well next time. Also used both green and red bells with garden fresh green onions. This is always a great recipe, amend as needed then enjoy! Thanks CJ, again a superb recipe!

I really enjoy this quick version. We use andouille sausage as I still have not found any spanish chorizo. In turn that means you have to use a little bit more olive oil because you don't get the same fat off of andouille. We also like to add about a cup of chopped up chicken breast. This recipe is super versatile, quick and easy.

I followed recipe but added clams and mussels at the end. These cooked in broth and were added after rice was cooked.  I used bomba rice and cooked a bit longer than suggested with half a cup more of broth.

Yummmmo!  I made this tonight and followed the recipe as closely as I could with what ingredients I had on hand. I used both red and yellow peppers, no saffron, andouille sausage and fully cooked, tail-on shrimp. I removed and used the tails to season the broth since I did not have stage shells. This recipe tasted better than the paella we had while on vacation recently!  Definitely a keeper and am looking forward to tripling the recipe to serve to guests for Sunday Football.  Thanks Chef John for yet another WINNER!  My family thinks I'm a great cook, but it's really me following many of your great recipes!

Came out good. I added marinated chicken as substitute for half the shrimp. I was wise to use 2 1/2 c broth because there was 2 1/4 c left after boiling with shells for 20 minutes. But the rice still didn't seem quite done so maybe I'll add more broth next time so I can cook it for a few more minutes. Also I diced the red pepper and sautéed it with the meat mixture a little before adding the rice.

This was awesome!! I've made it 3 times, the 2nd time I liked best because, I used Hillshire Farms Cajun sausage insted of a Cajun andouille sausage, that's a bit too spicy for my husband! Great recipe, Altho the recipe itself doesn't say WHEN to add the paprika!?

I made this but combined another recipe.  I added  1 lb. chicken thighs which  I cut into 2 inch strips.  I am also substituted  anduille  sausage.  I am not a great cook and it took me a lot longer to prep everything.  The cooking took longer to because I used a different small grain rice.  The one thing I did do was use saffron because of the expense.  This was a mistake which I think took away from the flavor.  
Everyone enjoyed the meal and there were very little left overs.  I will try this again and be sure to use the saffron.

Excellent recipe as written.  So many people substitute so it's difficult to know when a recipe is good as submitted.  Thank you for sharing.  Our family all loved it "as written".

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I was looking for something that was not terribly difficult but included classic ingredients (namely, saffron).  The shell broth is a great addition to other 'easy' recipes without being complicated or terribly time intensive.  I did notice the paprika was left out of the instructions (unless I just really missed it) so I just added when I stirred the rice in.  Our store was out of regular chorizo so I used ground- my husband and I really liked it as we love chorizo but unfortunately b/c it becomes mixed throughout, the child who doesnt like chorizo wouldn't touch it nor would the one who loves chorizo but hates rice so I won't do that again. Would definitely add chicken & mussels in the future. And next time I'll leave out the three burns on my hand from grabbing the pan handle after taking out of the oven... ugh!

Super easy recipe to make and experiment with.  I made mine with shrimp, sea scallops, clams and cod.  I used Arborio rice.  I served with a fresh salad with a peach Balsamic vinaigrette and toasted banquettes.

I loved this recipe. It was quick and easy. Since I was cooking for  3, I made half recipe. I added extra garlic, smoked paprika, less shrimp and added clams, mussels and calamari. I also followed the video and sauteed the shrimp shells and added chicken stock. Last I added a dash of turmeric for color.

This is a delicious and easy to make recipe. I also added a pound of calamari which added another layer of flavor. I will be making it again.

Leaving out the red peppers it still was a great success. Did not use saffron but substituted Tarragon because of cost, and it was still fine. We did not use the sliced chorizo but the shredded type that mixed with the rice much better.

Delicious, filling, and easy! Modifications: long grain rice, precooked sausage, and chicken broth.  It was perfect! I didn't have to boil off any excess liquid and the flavor was scrumptious!

I was watching Hells Kitchen and Ramsey made a paella. It looked so good I knew  I had to make some. 

This reciepe was easy to follow. I did change a few things: I used italian sausage and added papirika, minced garlic, pepper, and chilie flakes. I also used frozen peas instead of canned. 

My family loved it!!!! Ate the whole pan in one sitting. I can't wait to make it again. Next time I will add more seafood like mussles and maybe even some calamari. 

Thanks Chef John

This was delicious except when I pulled it out of the oven there wasn't any broth left and rice wasn't done. So I added some hot water. It maybe my convection oven runs hot. Also, I added too much salt. But I'm definitely making it again! Thanks Chef John ??

Really good recipe, having never made Paella before I found this one quite easy to follow.
I substituted chicken for the prawns due to a picky 4 yr old but followed everything else as per the recipe. Even the picky one ate it all up.
Served with crispy onions and garlic bread.

This was soooooo good!!  The only thing that I changed was that I used skinless bone in chicken thighs instead of  shrimp (pound per pound) because I don't eat seafood.  I had never had Paella before and now it is one of my favorites!!  I don't have any other recipes to compare it to since I never tried it before but I don't want to.  I can't imagine it being better than this!

I followed the recipe just added salad olives with pimiento, lobster bits and green snow peas.  I also used Mc Cormick Mezcla para Paella (paella rice mix). This is is less costly and has all natural spices, no MSG.  When I made it exactly as the recipe ,it tasted good but this version was a ****** hit.

My daughter had to make a dish for her Spanish class and we tried this recipe, which was fun to make and really tasty.  My usually finicky 17 year old actually ate this and wanted more the next day, if that tells you anything.

We skipped the Saffron, although it would probably be even better with it, but it was still great.  I took leftovers to work the next day and will do that again.  It seems to freeze well too.
