I have made these 3 times in the past 2 months and am getting ready to make them again tomorrow! They are a hit with my family--especially the kids, and I took them to a meal swap where they were a favorite!

I changed the recipe up some... First, I omitted the salt. With the packaged taco seasoning, it didn't need anymore salt. Second, I added a tsp more cumin and used an entire onion. I also use kidney beans instead of pinto and plan to make them with black beans one of these times! I also use olive oil instead of peanut oil in the mixture and for frying. 

As with traditional falfalfel, it's better to add the bread crumbs and let the mixture set at least 30 minutes. Much easier to form and fry! I do not deep fat fry mine, but rather skillet fry and I make patties vs balls.  Also, it has always taken 1 1/2c bread crumbs vs 1 cup. Again, they fry much better when dryer. 

Serve with homemade salsa and you have an incredible meal!  Enjoy! (PS--sometimes I also serve with tortillas, fresh tomatoes and lettuce)!

I wasn't able to deep-fry these, so I just skillet-fried 'em!  Good, especially when served with sour cream and salsa (I *may* have added some green onions on top for color, too.  Hehe.)  The only real change (besides frying technique) was that I used homemade taco seasoning instead of the packet.

I made this mostly as written, using the taco seasoning recipe from this site, cracker crumbs in place of bread crumbs (had to use them up) and added about a cup of pre-cooked quinoa to bulk up the protein and stretch the recipe. They were very good, tho I may have overdone the cayenne a little, because they were a little spicy, and we like spicy food. I'll keep them in my new vegetarian rotation.

I omitted the cayenne and pan-fried them as patties in a little bit of oil. They were excellent, the family loved them! Next time I will serve them on deli rounds with lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado & chipotle mayo.
