I rated it five stars as a great base recipe, though I did make a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand,it still turned out wonderfully. Firstly, I had no Chia seeds. Since I assumed they were an egg replacement, I instead used two eggs (added in with the dry ingredients in the first mixture), and lowered the amount of "buttermilk" by 6tbsp. I say "buttermilk" because I subbed plain yogurt mixed with a bit of whole milk to dilute to buttermilk consistently. Left out sunflower seeds, but added flax seeds. Baked according to directions, but only needed 20 minutes at the lowered temp before it was beautifully done. Great bread, nice consistency. Thanks!

Made this recipe last night. It was DELISH! I only used half the buttermilk, but there you have it. It popped it in the oven on a cookie sheet as a round loaf with a criss cross hatch , did 450 w/ parchment for 10m., then lowered to 390 for 15-20. Perfect little loaf for my batch of Irish stew. My husband loved it, as did I. Thank you for posting!

Love this recipe as we work towards gluten free...delicious and simple. My favorite right now (I’ve never tried it with the prunes as I opt for savory) is to add a good rounded teaspoon or so - I never measure - of dried Italian seasoning right to the grains before grinding; adds a wonderful herbal flavor.  I always make two loaves at a time as the recipe doubles beautifully. Also- try making the batter and letting it” soak “ for the day before baking to increase digest ability ??

I read all the reviews before trying this.  I didn't have a processor, so I used my coffee bean grinder to grind the groats and millet  1/4cup at a time.  Worked great.  Once all the ingredients were mixed, I let the batter sit for 10 minutes in the bowl before putting it in the bread pan.  The batter does not  become the consistency of bread dough, but more like the consistency of a banana loaf.   Baked according to instructions and it worked good.  I'll make it again, and start adding my own creative additions!

I tried this recipe because my daughters fermented recipe didn’t work at this elevation - and it worked! Next time, I will add the buttermilk gradually - because I didn’t, I added 1/2 cup of buckwheat pancake mix. Also, 40 minutes was fine, and next time, I’ll hold off on adding the seeds until it’s mixed and just sit them in - they were ground up in the processing.

This recipe was unfortunately problematic from the start. My friend accidentally poured all of the buttermilk in at once and we realized right away that the amount called for in the recipe was way too much by roughly 3/4 cup. The dough was liquidy. We decided to double the rest of the ingredients (not including buttermilk) and make two loaves from this large batch (one sweet - walnuts, rehydrated dried apricots, and chopped apples; one savory - chopped marinated artichokes, black olives, and jalapeños).

While both loaves tasted nice, they were incredibly dense and didn’t rise much. The cooking time stated was too long (after lowering the temp as called for in the recipe, we only needed 20 more mins). Additionally, although we greased the loaf pan generously, the first loaf still stuck to it. For the next loaf, we lined the pan with parchment paper and it was much better. 

This was time consuming and frustrating. I still want to get a good buckwheat bread in regular rotation, so I’m going to try Googling some recipes instead.

I don't know what the heck I did wrong but the mixture never thickened.  So I added more millet and groat.  Mixture still never thickened.  I put it in the bread pan and baked anyway .  You could eat it, but  just barely.  What could I have done differently?

I'm planning to make this as it looks like a great gluten free bread.  Just a question - could I reduce the amount of buttermilk and replace with something else (e.g. water, nut milk)?  Our family is can only cope with a bit of dairy.  Thanks Uperiju!
