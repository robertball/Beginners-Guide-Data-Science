I voe this recipie! I change it a bit by doign the following: I add garlic that I chop and  fry in olive oil..and put it in the mixture instead of just putting the oil they call for straight in. I use skinless boneless breasts and butterfly them instead the ones with skin. Then I will just roll them and use a toothpick or two to keep them shut! 
I serve it with risotto and salad..it's a great meal!

Wonderful recipe! I used chicken breasts, cut into the middle with poultry knife to form a pocket and stuffed with a mixture of sun-dried tomatoes, grated Parmesan, ricotta, oregano and crushed Triscuit crackers (didn't have walnuts nor breadcrumbs, so I substitute with crushed Triscuit crackers to get the nutty, crunchy taste). At first I was afraid the chicken will dry out within the 45 minutes of baking, but that was not the case at all! Make sure to smother with olive oil, it adds a nice touch of flavor.

Fantastic Recipe!  I also went with the bonless skinless.  And I found that adding a dash of seasoning salt to the top of the chiken after coating witht he olive oil helps the blandness that some of the other user had posted about,  will make this again!!!

I liked the idea of this but didn't have the correct ingredients so I substituted the same amts of: feta instead of ricotta, pine nuts instead of walnuts and basil instead of oregano.  Used seasoned bread crumbs – everything in the recipe measurements.  Ohhh my gosh, best stuffed chicken EVER!  Pounded the chicken very thin so baked at 375 for only 25min before topping each breast with a tbs of reserved stuffing and then broiled another 10 min until it had melted and browned…looked perfect!  Next time I may cut the pine nuts back a bit, I love them but it may be too much for some.  Thanks for an easy great recipe!!!

This recipe was a hit with my entire family--even my 5 yr. old picky eater. I would definately make it again. It's good enough for company for sure! I made some changes based on other reviews and using what I had on hand. Instead of boneless chicken, I used bone-in chicken (which I recommend trying), replaced ricotta for cottage cheese, and used pecans instead of walnuts (chopped fine). Based on other reviews, I sauted 2 garlic cloves in olive oil, added about half to  cheese mixture and used the rest to brush the chicken. After I brushed the chicken with oil, I added salt, pepper, plain bread crumbs, basil, and oregano on top of the chicken. It came out moist and delicious!

This was great, I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and might not next time because it was almost too rich, but came out wonderful.  I also used boneless skinless breasts as I do not like skin and just cut them almost in half and stuffed with mixture and was still very good! Great flavor and the walnuts add a nice crunch.

I used only 4 chicken breasts without skin and baked for 30 minutes in a covered pan and 20 in an uncovered pan.  The results were great.  The stuffing is really delicious.

I took another readers recommendation and did not use the walnuts.  I sauteed garlic in the oil and mixed that into the ricotta mixture.  After stuffing I added the seasoned salt and some bread crumb to the top.  It was great!!! Can't wait to have it again.  Even the kids ate it.

This was hit with my family. What a great way to liven up chicken, which can be so boring! I used skinless breasts, flattened them and secured the stuffing with toothpicks. Everyone agreed that it could have used less oregano and more bake time. But overall, the chicken was moist and tender. The stuffing turned out wonderful. I had a lot left over, so I just sprinkled the rest on top of the breasts and it came out nice and golden brown. Perhaps sun dried tomatoes? Different cheeses? There's so much you could add on to this recipe. I paired tender baby carrots, warm apples, and big crescent rolls with this to make it a meal.

The dish was very bland... I remade it a few days later and added some fresh sauteed spinach and some feta cheese...much better.

I thought this was fine for a clean-the-fridge type meal.  It smelled great and my chicken was plenty moist.  I just felt it needed some sort of sauce, like a light bechamel.  I used 2 chicken breasts cut horizontally into 4 cutlets.  My filling was 1/2 C ricotta, 1/2 C parmesan, 1/4 C panko, 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1 tsp lemon zest, a couple tbsp toasted pine nuts, a couple chopped olives, and one pressed garic clove.  I filled the cutlets with half the filling - reserving the rest for later - and secured the rolls with a toothpick.  I put about a tbsp of olive oil in the bottom of my baking pan, using a brush to spread it around. I placed the rolls in the pan and further brushed the oil onto them.  Salt and pepper over the rolls, then pressed more panko on top.  Baked uncovered at 350 for 30 minutes, then topped with the reserved filling and broiled for 5-10 minutes until nice and toasty. Served with quinoa made with chicken broth and a touch of lemon juice, and tossed with lemon zest, parsley, and toasted pine nuts.

My husband requests this time and time again - a definite keeper for us. I use boneless/skinless breasts, cut them in half, flatten, fill with mixture, roll, and secure with toothpick. Absolutely wonderful!

This was pretty good - I asked my husband and 2 daughters to rate - they said 3.5, 4 and 5, so 4 it is - lol I made minor changes - I used boneless skinless breasts that I slit & filled, used panko instead of bread crumbs, added salt, pepper, sage & garlic to the filling and sprinkled the breasts w/ garlic powder before baking. I would make this again :)

These came out very well.  I used skinless breasts that I then cut open and made a pocket inside.  Very easy to make and good to eat.

This recipe was a winner.  I did think it was a little dry maybe I will not add as much bread crumbs next time.  I may also consider adding some sort of sauce on the side.  Over all a good dish will make again.

I probably would have given this 3 stars, but because this simply was not for me nor my daughter, I gave it two.  I followed the recipe except that I used skinless boneless chicken breast.  Truly they turned out fine.  I guess it just was not what I was expecting.  The filling was kind of dry, not the chicken, it was moist.  My daughter described the filling as "old flour."  The taste is bland.  I probably won't make these again, but for someone else, this recipe maybe perfect.

Didn't care for this one. I followed the recipe exactly. It seemed very bland and dry. If I had to make it again I would substitute the walnuts for pecans.

OK...I changed this up a lot so I'm not sure if my rating should count!  I had some bone-in, skin on chicken breasts that I didn't know what to do with and came across this receipe.  Instead of using the stuffing mixture listed, I opted for traditonal stuffing mix made of 6 slices of bread shredded, 1 stalk of celery finely chopped, 1/4 of a small onion onions finely chopped, 1/2 a granny smith apple finely chopped, 1 tsp sage, 1 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp thyme, 1 egg, splash of milk, salt and pepper to taste.  This was more than enough to fill 2 very large (1 lb) chicken breasts.  I seasoned the skin with salt, pepper, paprika and some oil (butter is prefered though).   I followed the cooking directions and baked at 350 for 1 hour (because they were so huge!).  They were fabulous!!  Thanks for the idea!

Very good, but I tweaked a bit. I forgot to pick up walnuts, so I took it in a differant direction and added spinach and onions to the ricotta cheese.  I had extra stuffing so I threw it on top of the chicken, and it browned wonderfully. Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!!!  I made the filling exactly as the recipe says.  Rolled it up in some butterflied skinless breasts (secured with toothpicks), and brushed with olive oil and garlic powder, because I love garlic.  Baked it a bit hotter, for less time, too.  Served with broccoli and plain rice.  Good enough for company!

Great recipe! I used boneless breasts, cutting them across the center and stuffing between the two halves. They turned out perfect and were loved by everyone.

So delish, but I made some alterations I omitted the walnuts, and as one other reviewer suggested I fried some fresh garlic in the oil and added it to the stuffing mix, and I also sprinkled the chicken when it was in the pan with some italian seasonings.will definitly make again =)

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used boneless, skinless breasts instead on skin ones and I also added a bunch of red potatoes.  I thought this was good, but next time I'll cover it when I put it in the oven.  Mine turned out a little dry.  I'm also surprised that no one has commented on how MUCH stuffing this recipe makes.  I had TOO much of it leftover.  I ended up sprinkling it over the final dish just to utilize more of it.  This recipe is too much stuffing for only 6 boneless chicken breast halves.  Are you sure you didn't mean "6 boneless chicken breasts halved"?  Anyway, will do a little more tweeking next time.

this dish tasted as good as it looked.  I deboned the skin-on breasts myself.  Mixing the stuffing I found it a little dry so added just a bit of milk to help.  Was easy to stuff under the skin and it browned and crisped up nicely.  I didn't think I would like the walnuts but they were perfect for crunch and not strong as walnuts can be.  I might sub pecans sometime.    From some of the reviews I was afraid it might be a little bland so I sprinkled the underside with a light dusting of poultry seasoning and rosemary.  This is great as written but I feel that seasoning the underside really makes it outstanding  Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing!! I dont care too much for ricotta so I subed cream cheese, added the panko to that and a little salt and pepper. Butterflyed the chix, Stuffed, Rolled and secured. I seasoned with salt and pepper, and dusted with a little panko, and then used turkey bacon to wrap around. about 2 per piece. Cooked 425 for 20 min, came out perfect!! Dont forget to add some olive oil to your chicken and cover or itll dry out. Took off the lid and broiled it for another 5 to get it crispy.

This is a fab recipe and so quick and easy - any leftover stuffing is great rolled into balls and baked alongside the chicken breasts. mmmmm! do baste the chicken with oil so prevent drying.

I made this twice and the first time it was too dry. The second time I added bread crumbs only to taste, and stopped when it was a good consistency (at least 1/4C though). I also threw in some freshly cooked spinach, but overall I don't feel the spinach added *too* much, it was still nice. Be careful not to over chop the walnuts because if you ask me it overwhelms the other textures too much when you have as much finely chopped as the recipe calls for. It's also good to spread any extra ricotta/etc filling on top of the chicken before baking.

Tweaked to remove skin... also did not use nuts, but the end result was very tasty, and with a simple spritzing of olive oil over the breadcrumb mixture before baking, we ended up with a very tasty and appetizing main.

Pretty good. I too used the remainder of the stuffing on top of the chicken breasts, used boneless skinless and added more seasonings, salt, pepper and garlic salt. I like that it was simple enough that I had all the ingredients on hand.

Wow! This was chicken was amazing.  I cut pockets into skinless breasts, mashed up cottage cheese in place of ricotta (its what I had on hand) and used olive oil instead of vegetable.  I could only fit about 2/3 of the stuffing inside the chicken, so I sprinkled the rest on top and it came out nice and crispy - a nice contrast to the juicy, tender chicken.

the chicken was very good and filling. I used used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Cooked on 350 for 50 min then let it sit in the oven for 5 min. i dont like nuts  so instead i crumbled up some fancy cheese flavored potatoe chips just to get that crunch.

Wonderful!  I was surprised by the juciness of the chicken...I thought it would surely dry out while baking.  I added fresh parm to the tops for the last 5 min., and it was a huge success.  A real keeper!

If you like ricotta cheese, then you will probably like this recipe a lot.  I am not a fan of it myself and probably should have known better but it sounded so good.  I loved the walnuts, added a nice texture, but the overall taste was a little bland for us.  Also, I would recommend covering the chicken for at least part of the baking time, it seemed too dry.

This recipe was simple and tasted great. I used the same amount of ingredients but instead of 6 chicken breasts, used 4 and really stuffed them.  It was alot more  tasty that way.

I had skinless breasts so pounded them thin then rolled around the filling. It as nice, but I found the filling a tad dry and felt it was missing something. It did go down well with rice and a plum sauce. Might tinker with this one to see if I can improve it.

I'm sorry. I felt that the stuffing was bland and the recipe lacked seasoning.  I added salt and pepper, but it needed something else.  The filling sounded delicious but it didn't come through.  We picked at it and pitched the leftovers.
