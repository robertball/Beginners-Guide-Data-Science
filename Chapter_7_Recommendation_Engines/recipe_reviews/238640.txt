I followed the recipe closely but added the following ingredients: mushrooms, asparagus, sausage, red peppers, green peppers, and spinach. I sautéed the ingredients that I added in olive oil prior to adding. Delicious! And, it heats up well.

Delicious quiche - these are amazing made in muffin tins and you can freeze them and just microwave for breakfast. I lightly cook onion, spinach, ham and mushroom for a really flavorful version. Cooking time is about 45 min if you like them golden on the top in muffin size cups.

I used this recipe for the ratio of eggs to milk/heavy cream.  Also, needed something without a crust.  Easy to add whatever meat you have (bacon and/or sausage), any type of cheese and whatever vegetable I might have...usually leftover broccoli, asparagus or spinach.

I used all 1/2 and 1/2 because that's what I had.  It was great.  Next time, I'll stick with all 1/2 and 1/2 to save a little on the fat.  I did follow another comment.  I added sauteed onions and some spinach to 1/2.  I just layered on top of the cheese and then added the egg mixture to the whole thing.   It was super yummy.  I didn't miss having a crust and love the casserole dish.  It makes breakfast for dinner easier!!

Very delicious! The parmesan bottom gave it a nice buttery taste.  I added spinach and caramelized onions to mine and it was yummy. A very tasty and simple recipe to make! Will definitely make again!

Very good. I added mozzarella cheese and spinach and halved the recipe for 4 people. Excellent!

I dropped a brand new container of a dozen eggs on the floor and was able to recover 11 of them but they wouldn’t last long out of the shell so I decided to make quiche. Never made quiche before so I tried this one since it was “easy”. It was. I skipped the bacon and used 1lb of spicy Italian chicken sausage. I also added mushrooms and some chopped onion to the sausage while browning. I didn’t have any Parmesan cheese but I did have the cheddar cheese so I used that on the bottom of the casserole dish instead. I thought it sounded like way too much cream so I used 1 cup only of half and half and all eleven eggs :-). I also mixed some of the cheese into the eggs AND some spinach. I sprinkled some cheese on top of the sausage, as described in the recipe, then I poured the egg mixture in and topped with more cheese. I ended up only using about 1/2 of the 1lb bag of cheese. More would be too much I thought. It all turned out very, very good and it was very easy.

Great recipe, will make again. I did add veggies to it and it turned out wet.  Did not set ( my bad). Next time if I add veggies I will also add a little flour.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband said it was the best egg bake that I have made thus far. Good flavor. Light and airy. Very easy to make.

I love the egg to cream ratio this recipe uses. The quiche has a nice creamy custardy consistency which is my goal in quiche. No rubbery eggs in this recipe!  Just be careful if you add overly moist ingredients (ie mushrooms, asparagus) your quiche might be watery.

the first time I made this as written, next time I added onions while frying the bacon. Used half mozzarella and half cheddar cheese. Rave reviews. I cook the bacon and sausage the night before so assembly is quick in the morning. Great basic recipe, customize away.

I made two. One with sausage and one with Blackened Salmon. The blackened salmon is great for low carb eaters.

I made a couple of substitutions...I used 2 cups of heavy cream  & 2 cups whole milk. Turkey bacon instead of  pork bacon.  Used mozzarella instead of cheddar cheese and added  sauteed onions, mushrooms and chopped spinach . I also added one half teaspoon of  sea salt &  freshly ground black pepper to the egg mixture. I grated fresh nutmeg on top before I popped it in the oven. Absolutely Delicious!!!

This was delicious!!  I brought it to a brunch today and it was a hit!  I'm single so family and friends are my guinea pigs.  However, I think I will halve the recipe next time as it makes a large amount.  Also, prep time took me longer as I didn't fry the bacon and sausage at the same time.  Great low carb recipe!

Made this once, couldn't find the recipe again and just found it. Making it again in the morning. We love it. I'm planning on adding some onions and green peppers to it this time around. The leftovers will be great for Monday breakfast and lunch.

Delicious!  I had ham on hand so I used that as the meat and left the rest of the recipe the same and it was easy and yummy.

Excellent recipe for a make-ahead breakfast. Just make it the night before and heat it up the next morning. The milks give the eggs the fluffy texture that is really yummy. No salt is needed because the bacon does that part.

Easy to make. Made the entire house smell amazing. Took more than 10 min for my bacon to get crispy. Tastes great! Will definitely use this recipe again.

It was okay. I prefer a denser quiche (more eggs).
