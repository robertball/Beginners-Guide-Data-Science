You have to press the dough hard into a circle because it's crumbly. It doesn't flatten when baked. The flavor is very nice with the hint of coconut. This recipe came in handy because I ran out of butter

No flavor.  I've made lots of different chocolate chip cookie recipes, and this one is not worth saving.  I was excited to use coconut oil, since I love coconut.  Don't bother.

These turned out great. I doubled the recipe and added about a  1/2 cup of milk to moisten them a bit more.

The texture is very grainy and crumbly. Kind of a flat taste.
