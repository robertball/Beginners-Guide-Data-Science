Wow! After reading all of the reviews, I decided to "marinate" my chicken in 1 tbl of oil infused with italian spices & 1 tbl balsamic vinegar. That's how I always do my chicken! I used 2 tlb of the oil from the sundried and 1 tbl plain olive oil to sautee the garlic. I made 1/2 c chicken broth and poured a bit at a time in the pasta to keep moist. To the chicken I added crushed red and sliced artichoke hearts. This tasted exactly like a dish I get at a local Italian Restaurant!  Just awesome.

A wonderful, easy standard in our rotation of meals.  Don't change the ingredients, but I do have a few tips for easy prep: I double this, and put the chicken, sun-dried tomatoes and SDT oil, and all remaining ingredients (except parm and noodles) into 2 large zip lock bags.  I throw 1 bag in the fridge until I'm ready to cook it in the evening, and the other bag goes into the freezer. When I go to make this meal again in the future, I pull out the frozen bag and thaw it which also marinates the meat a the same time.  I heat a pan, dump it in, and it's done even before the noodles!!

Very tasty and quick recipe. I put the chicken,oil from the sun-dried tomatoes, and herbs into a large zip lock bag a marinated it in the refrigerator for an hour before cooking. I also added some red pepper flakes to spice it up.  I made the Garden Herb Loaf from this site to serve with it.  Between the colorful pasta and the pretty herb bread that was a quick braided loaf, it was a beautiful presentation.  Thanks Cindy.

I thought this was very good but to make more of a "sauce", I added chicken broth during the last few minutes of simmering. I probably added about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of broth. I would definitely recommend the oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes as I thought they really added moisture and extra taste!

Very delicious but does not do well
made ahead of time.  The pasta gets
chewy and the chicken gets dry.  

My whole family loves it!!  My brother
is very finicky and he loved it.  
I added artichokes when adding the 
sun dried tomatoes. 

Very Yummy!!!

This was a mouth-watering piece.  The aroma and the combination of flavours is superb. I've made it a few times now and some tips I would sggest to maximize on the deelish-factor are: (i) cut the chicken breasts into small bite-sized pieces and marinate for 30 - 60 minutes in the remaining ingredients (minus the parmesan, of course) and (ii) use sun-dried tomatoes, it punches up the flavour wonderfully and also use the olive oil from these.  A little more oil is better as it is a particularly dry dish.  Enjoy the flavours!A *****

This dish gets too dry if you drain the oil after cooking the chicken. Otherwise full of flavor and delightful.

I give this recipe four stars only because I didn't follow it exactly. I hate sun dried tomatoes, so instead I cooked some fresh chopped spinach. Also, I only had a bag of frozen chicken breasts and no time to thaw, so I baked the chicken with some Italian salad dressing drizzled over the tops. Other than that, I followed everything in the recipe. It was delicious!!!!! First time I've ever had pasta that wasn't slathered in some sort of sauce! Definitely will be making this again.

Very good!  I made it with penne pasta since this is all I had.  I did not have sun dried tomatoes so I did what another reviewer did and added some spinach and also some grape tomatoes halved.  I had some Italian spice mixes that I used in there instead of the oregano and basil.  A little dry after it was mixed, so I added a drizzle of evoo.  Wish I would have had some garlic bread for this!! :)

This was good, and definitely quick, but tasted a little different than what I was expecting. I guess we're used to "wet" pastas and this seemed a little too dry. I used 8 tenderloins rather than breasts, cut them into bite-sized peices and tossed them together with the herbs and let it marinate a while.  The sun-dried tomatoes had a very strong "olive" taste that kind of turned me off.  Maybe it was the brand I bought...I'm not sure.  I added some fresh mushrooms along with the tomatoes and deglazed my pan with some white wine since mine was rather dry.  I also poured in a little half and half to my finished product so it would have a little liquid.  I'm sure the problem lies somewhere on my end and I do not discourage anyone from at least trying this recipe...on the contrary, it has recieved many GOOD reviews and therefore at least deserves a chance.  Glad I gave it a shot.  Thanks Cindy :)

This was very good. I marinated the chicken in olive oil and white wine first. It was a hit, even with my two-year-old. Next time I might add pine nuts.

This was a great recipe.  I was not taught how to cook or make many dishes.  I only know how to make the same 5 dishes and Im sick of it.  I found this recipe and added the chicken broth like the one person said and it was great.  Thanks so much for the help.  We loved it.

I kind of teaked this a little.  I bought some olives and feta mix in oil from the store olive bar.  I cooked the chicken in 4 Tbls of that with a little extra EVOO.  I used already minced garlic in a jar and added a small teaspoon of the oil they are in as well.  Made it with bow-tie pasta.  And when everything was done, I put the pasta in with the chicken and oil, then I added the olive and feta.  Just to add some more cheese, I added a handful of mozzerella.  Everyone loved it.  It was a bit too salty for me though, because I didn't take into consideration for the olives.  I would cut back on the salt if you decide to add them.  It was good though.

Very Good Recipe!   followed the instructions, then added some cream to the chicken mix after adding the tomatoes, and prior to tossing wth the noodles added some fresh chopped spinach!  MMM that was easy and tastie!  The sun dried tomatoes are incredable and gave the dish a deep rich flavor.   Loved it!

Good, but needed more moisture.  Add 1/2-1 cup chicken broth.  Also added pesto.  May use a different pesto sauce.

This is fast becoming a family favorite.  I've used fresh gnocci pasta every time and it's great.  Must be eaten immediately and don't skimp on the oils or it's too dry.  We love it!

Very easy and very good even though I forgot to put the Parmesan on.  I am sure it would have been even better.  Would have given 5 if my kids had liked it.  I will probably still make it again.

I found this VERY salty. I'd be willing to try it again with less salt and perhaps switching brands of sundried tomatoes because it smelled so good cooking and was super fast and easy!

My family LOVES this!  I added 3/4 cup chicken broth, an extra 1/4 cup grated parm. cheese, and used 2 Tbls. EVOO, and 2 Tbls. of the sun-dried tomato oil.  Also used tri-color rotini pasta to give it some color.  Delicious!!  12-Minute Pasta Toss doesn't come close to encompassing the tastiness of this meal.  My family has renamed it "12-Minute Awesome Pasta" instead!

I was in a hurry to make my husband's work lunch and I was relieved when I found this recipe.  It seemed so easy and it was!  I used what I had and these are my changes:  Greenhouse tomato instead of Sun-dried Fresh mozzarella instead of Parmesan Added: diced red onion, drizzled tiny bit of olive oil on completed mixture, while still in pan  My husband just texted me saying how delicious it was!  I know he'll want this again in the future.  It seems pretty kid friendly, too.  Especially with the melty cheese!

4 1/2 stars for taste and 5 stars for how easy it was to make.  All of us really liked it and were surprised how good it was, considering how little time it took to make it.  My toddler, who is usually the last one to finish, I think finished his before my husband and me.  I did similar to what another reviewer did and and marinated the chicken in balsamic vinegar and olive oil and then a couple of dashes of Italian seasoning.  The one thing that definitely needs to be changed is that it really needs some veggies mixed in to enhance the flavor even more and to add texture.  I added mushrooms, but next time I think I will saute some asparagus, onion, some peppers, etc.  I was going to add some chicken broth as several have suggested and didn't because it seemed fine.  By the time I went to serve it, it was just a little dry.  I definitely would recommend incorporating some into the recipe.  In any case, a nice, flavorful and fast one that we will make often.

This really was fantastic, and surprisingly easy. I found this recipe to be perfect as-is. The chicken was delicious and very flavorful without being marinated. I did add more pasta than was called for, and didn't find it to be too dry at all. Just keep in mind that this is not pasta in sauce, this is pasta coated in flavored oil. It's not supposed to be wet, it's just supposed to taste good. Definitely a "make-again" recipe!

A dish a lot like this was a staple for me at college. Great for a quick, simple meal. I never bothered with meat when I cooked it but I do recommend changing up the pastas, favorite is tri-colored rotini or bowties.
The spices are what make this meal and you can throw in whatever you want. I always just used canned tomatoes and they were great. Big tip: Classico makes a fantastic sun-dried tomato pesto. If you can find it, it's tons healthier and lighter than other tomato pestos and definately than regular pestos. I love this stuff. Just stir in a few spoonfuls of it instead of using all that oil.

This was very good, especially with the sun-dried tomatos. I used the multi-grain pasta and added broccoli, which I added to the boiling pasta during the last 5 minutes. Will probably make this again.

Great quick recipe, very good flavor. I can see that it would get dry if you do not eat it right away. It had great flavor.

I love this recipe!  I usually add more vegetables (peppers, zuchini, etc) for more color, and cook it with whole wheat rotini pasta to make it even healthier.  Left overs are great too!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I halved the ingredients and followed the recipe essentially as written. My sun-dried tomatoes were not packed in oil, so I used regular olive oil. I used whole wheat pasta and did not use the (optional) parmesan cheese. The dish was very flavorful and delicious. I am accustomed to more sauce with my pasta so it did seem a little dry. Next time I will follow other suggestions in these reviews and try adding some chicken broth for more liquid and maybe some spinach for nutritional value.

Awesome recipe!  I loved it, and my boyfriend has already request that I make it again.

I used a little bit more oil than called for after realized that there wasn't quite enough to coat all the pasta.  I also added a bit of white cooking wine for a little extra liquid.  I added a chopped zucchini, and next time I'll probably add some chopped red peppers to make it a bit more healthy.

Using the oil packed with the sun dried tomatoes was excellent, and I also doubled the amount of fresh garlic (can never have enough!).  Wonderful, packed with flavor, and makes great leftovers, either hot or cold!

I thought it was ok, but my boyfriend loved it.  I would make this again because its quick and easy.  Maybe next time I'll add some mushrooms and capers to it.
Footnote:  If you really like cheese, add more than the 1/4 cup called for.

The tomatoes in this were terrible. All I could find were plain sundried tomatos, nothing soaking in olive oil. It made it into more of a mediterranean style dish which my husband liked, but I didn't.
It was also rather dry. I'll keep trying it.
I would recommend using fresh basil rather than dried.

With the original recipe, I was ready to rate this as 4 stars.  We discovered, however, that it was far better the second day.  My daughter ate it reheated and I ate it cold and we both thought it was excellent.  So, I suggest you refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to marinate before serving it.

I made this dish when we had our New Years Eve party.  Everyone really liked it.  Two people took the recipe home.  I omitted the sundried tomatoes, because not everyone likes them and my sons kept saying "UUOOOgh" - what are those?  Even when the dish became cold, it was still good.  The next morning, the kids and some of the adults were eating it right out of the fridge.  

If you like more sauce with your pasta, because this doesn't have much, try using straight butter or a nice four cheese sauce.  YUMMY!

This is such a good recipe! I have made it for my family and guests and everyone raves about it.  I add a little more garlic and olive oil with bow tie pasta.  I would recommend this to anyone.  The best part is how quick this can be prepared.

Quick and delicious!! Few changes based on reviews, I marinated 2 chicken breast chopped up in roasted red pepper dressing. I also add steamed broccoli/cauliflower and plum tomatoes with the 1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes. Was very surprised a pasta dish without sauce could be so good and that my family would agree!

I made this for book club last week, and it was a hit!  Make sure you don't forget to chop up the sun dried tomatoes though!  I forgot, so they were huge chunks, which isn't the yummiest thing in the world.  Also, I wouldn't recommend keeping this as leftovers for the next day, unless you leave the sun dried tomatoes out.  They were very dry, and kind of hard the next day around.  The first night was a hit though!  Everyone had really big servings :)

This is an uncomplicated and quickly prepared recipe that has very good flavor.  My mistake was thinking I had another jar of sun-dried tomatoes, which I didn’t, but I had enough for it turned out wonderfully.  If you’re short on time, this is the perfect recipe for you.  Thanks for sharing!

Great MyPlate recipe! Full of flavor and so easy to throw together. I cut the recipe in half for the two of us but used only one very large chicken breast. I used just enough pasta for it to "look right." Perfect!

We thought this was very easy and delicious, too!  I used boneless skinless thighs that I cleaned up of all the fat.  The olive oil I used was rosemary infused, a gift from a good friend.  Be sure to save a little of the pasta water so you can use it to add to the meal once you get it together if you need more moisture.  I think white wine would have worked well, too.  If you didn't have sundried tomatoes, capers would be a great sub, as would marinated artichoke hearts or bottled roasted red peppers.  As you can tell, this lends itself very well indeed to whatever you happen to have on hand!  Thanks for a great meal!

This was a delicious recipe.  I added extra garlic and garlic powder (we tend to like garlic).  It was more of a light sauce, but it still had a good amount of flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

This was fabulous! I cut the recipe in half though bc it was only for 2 people. And I also added a little steamed broccoli.

Success!! My picky 8y/o loved it and even had seconds. I left out the garlic powder though and just added a little more salt. I did use 1/2cup chicken broth to make it a little more moist.

This was really good!  It's not really a "leftovers" type of pasta unless you eat it cold, as it gets very dry!

This is OK.  I think it needs more veggies.  Next time I will add mushrooms and broccoli.  I'll also add more oil once the pasta in mixed in.  I did really like the seasoning for the chicken, but next time I will add more.  I will try it again, I loved that it was light and easy.

Really good but could use a few more veggies for my taste. I added some green onions but next time think I will throw in some mushrooms or green peppers as well. Over all this dish turned out very good and something we will eat again.  I did chose to only toss together the amount we were going to eat to ensure that a reheat would taste better then if all thrown together.

Simple, delicious, elegant meal.  Used whole wheat pasta, cooked marinated chicken on the foreman grill, and used fresh basil in place of dried basil because I had it on hand.  Highly recommended.  Next time I will add a veggie, probably broccoli and maybe pine nuts.

Maybe just me but I thought this was dry.  I added a small amount of olive oil and a handful of chopped roasted red peppers from the jar but still was not impressed.  I used bow tie pasta in place of the rotini.  There are other chicken pasta recipes on this site I like better.

This is delicious if you make it immediately prior to eating it.  I did have to add more oil since the pasta tends to suck up all the moisture.  Will make again and again.

I tried this recipe tonight.  It is a nice light pasta dish.  Next time I will definitely tweek it a bit.  I used the oil from the tomatoes and added red pepper flakes per other reviewers ... otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee.  I thought the tomato flavor was too strong/tart.  Next time I will use less tomatoes and add either spinach or arugula.  The red pepper flakes are a good addition.  This is a good recipe but needs some changes to be great for me.  I will certainly try it again. Thanks for sharing.

We thought this was FANTASTIC! Easy and very flavorful. Do use the olive oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. I skipped the garlic cloves since there was already garlic powder. Even the kids liked it! Something I'll make again and again for us and it'd also be a great dish for company. It's a little different than my usual rotation - so it's great for a change. Tastes like a restaurant meal! I was so excited about it, I sent the recipe to all my friends!

Love it!  This is so simple to make(as the title suggests) and it tastes so good!  Deff use the olive oil from the sun dried tomatoes when you saute the chicken pieces-adds lots of good flavor!  My kids aren't all that into tomatoes, so I put them thru the food processor so that it is super finely chopped and they love the flavor.  Oh, and I also add some more olive oil after the dish is plated(it can be a little dry) and remember to use freshly grated parm-its the best!

Great recipe!  My husband wanted to make dinner on his own last night (he doesn't have much experience with cooking) and he picked this recipe to make.  It turned out delicious!  Next time we'll add a little more olive oil to it, but other than that, we loved this recipe.

I love this recipe.  It is easy and very good.  I often toss in mushrooms when I cook the garlic.  Also tried making it with shrimp and it worked very well.  I cut back on the amount of spices as to not over power the shrimp.

Quick, easy and delicious!  I substituted frozen/thawed cooked shrimp for the chicken and thin spaghetti for the rotini and it turned out great!  With a salad or green veggie, this recipe makes a quick dinner for two that can be on the table in 15 minutes.

Really great recipe and the seasoning is GREAT, so perfect. The only thing was I didn't like was the sun dried tomatoes. I have never had them before and eating them reminded me of eating sun dried prunes (yuck!). In any case that's on me, the recipe is still really good and I will make it again, without the tomatoes.

I had a little trouble posting this review so I apologize if this is a duplication. I suggest adding a few pieces of crispy crumbled up bacon at the end of cooking. It really adds a great new flavor variation to this already delicious recipe. Once I tried it with bacon once, I’ve done it every time since. Give it a shot.

This was boring - I used a my own Italian spice blend instead of the dry ingredients and marinated the chicken as others suggested.  There was no "body" in the sauce - very thin.  Will not repeat this.

I added powdered Parmesan cheese while cooking the chicken, because it will coat the chicken a bit and give it more flavor. I also add the sundried tomatoes a little earlier and used rotini pasta. My super picky kids love this dish. I've added it to our regular rotation.

A very fast and easy delicious dinner. My husband told me it was a "keeper". I followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty, but I will try the suggestions from other reviews next time.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was amazing!! My Husband said it tasted like we were in a Italian Restaurante!! I read a few reviews and took the advice to add 1/2 C chicken broth and a splash of white cooking wine as the chicken and spices were sautéing. I also marinated the chicken with the spices, olive oil and an extra 2 T of the oil from the roasted red tomatoes for about an hour before cooking. I had seconds because this dinner was SO delicious! Better yet, it was so quick and easy to make!! Thank you for the recipe Cindy!

This is a very nice, quick, simple and delicious dinner. I had chicken that I had previously cooked in the freezer.  I did sauté it like the recipes call for and it worked great.  I didn't have rotini pasta on-hand, but I did have small extra-fiber shells.  By using the shells, all the diced sun-dried tomatoes disappeared in to the shells, but the taste was still there, just not the color.  I took Marianne's advice and saved my pasta water.  Once stirring everything together, I added about a cup of the pasta water to the dish for a little more moisture.  I liked how quick this dinner, along with a tossed salad came together. The fresh grated Parmesan cheese was a nice touch to finish off the dish.

This is an easy go-to weeknight dinner.  I dry my own tomatoes from the garden in the summer for use through the fall and winter.  Since I dry my own in a dehydrator, they are not the oil packed type, but it works grreat.  We also grow our own garlic, so we use fresh, not garlic powder, and I freeze pesto and use that for my basil and some of the olive oil.

Great recipe. As a vegetarian I omit the chicken or sub Quorn (faux chicken), and if I happen to have sun dried tomatoes in oil I use that for cooking. Yumm!

This dish was super easy to make and tastes DELICIOUS! My husband is quite the picky eater and he couldn't get enough of it!  The chicken turns out so well with the spices that I've actually started making the chicken like this without the noodles as a separate dish.  I did use garlic infused olive oil as well as regular olive oil, and i added extra garlic bc we love garlic.

This was spectacular.  Like someone else mentioned, I used sun dried tomatoes that were already in oil, then used the oil as the oil to cook with.  Other than that, didn't change anything on the recipe.  At first, I was concerned about it being dry, but if it was a tad dry, it still had tons of flavor so that it didn't matter.  Everything was flavorful.  It was spectacular!!!  Will keep this and make it again!!

This was more like a pasta salad side dish than an entree.  It was good but I wouldn't rave about it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use oregano because I didn't have any.  I also sauteed more olive oil from my sun dried tomatoes jar hoping to give the dish a little more sauce but it was still a bit dry.  I also squeezed a little lemon juice on top when serving because it still tasted bland to me.  I would probably still make it again but not as a main course.

This was really quick and easy.  I added Zesty Italian to the ingredients and soaked the chicken in it before cooking.  I also added some at the end to give the pasta more flavor.  We all loved it!

This is a great recipe!  I like that it's light on the stomach.  I like creamy too, but sometimes it's nice to eat something a little lighter.  Nice, easy recipe that everyone in my home loved!

I tried to make this a vegetarian dish by eliminating the chicken and it really wasn't very good.  You probably need the chicken to give it a little more flavor.

I love this flavor-filled recipe.  I've used chix breast, boneless chix thighs, and white fish at various times.  I add 10 oz box of frozen spinach to offset the strong tomato flavor, leave out the salt, go lighter on the spices, and use some of the juice from soaking the dried tomatoes to moisten the dish.  I also don't toss the pasta with the chix and tomato mixture; I just apportion on the plates.

I want to give it 3 and a half stars!  3 for flavor and 4 for ease!  I needed a recipe that I already had all of the ingredients for and I wanted to have sauceless fettuccini tonight.  It was way easy and pretty tasty.  You do kinda have to eat it right away.  I added the red pepper flakes, more garlic, and 1/2 c. of chicken broth.  I used florentine fettuccini.  Will make again and maybe try to tweak some more spices for more flavor, but give it a try in a pinch!

This was very good and quick.  It didn't have enough flavor for me, so next time I'm going to add broccoli, water chestnuts and other vegetables.

Love this recipe. I just simmered it on low until my husband came home from work. He was leary because it was from the healthy recipes. He really liked it. I will make it again.

Not my favorite dish, I don't think I'd make this again. It was just too plain for us, and I had to add red sauce from a jar just to keep it from drying out by the time it got to the plate.

I used the oil from the Sun-Dried tomatoes and added red pepper flakes. It is very easy and quick to make. It also has any possibilities to customize for personal preferences. I did omit the garlic powder, but I love how fast and simple this recipe really is. Thanks.

I used the breasts from a rotisserie chicken I purchased at costco for this recipe so it would not go to waste.
It shortened the cooking time and carmelized nicely. Great combination of ingredients!  Thanks.

It was good. A little oily for my taste, not so much flavor, but a nice flavor for pasta. This was easy to make, and made for good leftovers.

It was very good and tasty, but my boyfriend and I found it just a touch lacking in texture. I made it again and added sauteed spinach and mushrooms, and mixed it with ricotta cheese instead of parmesan. Yum!

This was very good! I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used the olive oil from the jar of sundried tomatoes. It was wonderful. I like my pasta with more sauce and had planned on adding tomato paste or puree but I was out. I just warmed up some good spaghetti sauce from a can and added it to the individual servings. I cut the recipe in half, as it's just my husband and me. We had PLENTY of leftovers--I plan on mixing the pasta with some more sauce and maybe some mozzarella and putting it in the oven to make a sort of casserole for tomorrow! This is definitely a keeper recipe. You can do so many things with it!

Outstanding dish to make in a hurry. I used sun dried tomatoes in a bag and not oil, then served on whole wheat pasta to make it a healthier choice.

I love this pasta dish. It's easy, delicious, healthy, and my boyfriend loves it when it's my night to cook and I make this. I use, as someone else suggested, the oil from jarred sun-dried tomatoes instead of separate olive oil, and it really flavors the chicken. Great recipe!

My family loved the dish, however, it had too much of a garlic taste.  In the future, I may modify the garlic to two clove and the other spices to 1 teaspoon.  Otherwise, terrific recipe!

Really good! I served with bowties instead of rotini. Will add more sun-dried tomatoes next time!

Made this one twice, once with chicken, once with ham (left out salt.) This was really good!  I used the oil from the tomatoes instead of plain olive oil. I also sauteed in a dash of crushed red pepper, sliced black olives and fresh mushrooms, may add some green pepper or zucchini next time.
Thanks!

yummy yummy yummy!  to make this even quicker, i use the pre-roasted, pre-cubed tyson chicken breast and then saute it with garlic and veggies--then toss the pasta, chicken, and veggies all together in the original pasta pot with butter and basil.  easy and flavorful, even without sauce!

this is a great recipe.. but as another reviewer wrote it lacked a bit of zing... so while the pasta is cooking stirfry the chicken in the tomatoe oil, with the tomatoes, herbs, add porcini mushrooms (2 cups sliced), a couple of bay leaves. when the chicken is cooked add a little bit more oil and some tomatoe puree (about a cup and a half) add salt and pepper to taste and let this mixture simmer (covered) for about 10 minutes on low. For extra Zing! i love to use flaked chili....

It was a little bland for my taste, I should have tried the review that suggested adding chicken stock.  I added corn to get some veggies in the dinner, which added some flavor.  But I would have added much more garlic to give it a kick.  But it'll be a good recipe for mid-week cooking.  It's easy and a decent dish.  Just not anything too spectacular. Thanks

Pretty yummy.  I think I used too much pasta so the flavor wasn't as full as it should have been.  Next time I'll use less.

We really liked this. I didn't have the tomatoes. I thought it would be too garlicky...but it wasn't. I'm going to omit the salt next time though. Also tossing the pasta with additional olive oil helped. Overall Wonderful.

This is a delicious recipe.  I use leftover chicken bits from ones which I've roasted whole... it's still great.

Delicious and really fast and easy.  I made just enough for myself.  The sundried tomatoes I bought were very tough and chewy, so I soaked them in a bit of boiling hot water while cooking the chicken to soften them up.  Turned out perfect.

Great,easy dish!  I used less oil, and supplemented with some chicken broth and a little white wine.  Also added a little chopped onion and some sliced mushrooms.  We prefer things spicey, so I added some cajun seasoning and red pepper flakes.  This was so quick & tasty.  A keeper!

This was really easy and quick to make, which is a plus after a long day at work!  I really enjoyed this dish, and could make a meal out of it.  My kids, however, liked the dish but weren't as enthusiastic as I was.
