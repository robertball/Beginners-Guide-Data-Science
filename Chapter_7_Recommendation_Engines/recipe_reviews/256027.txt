Love this recipe! I make smaller amounts and adjust ingredients but always comes out great! Sometimes I add chipotle pepper which gives it a little zing.

It's not low cal, but anything good never is.  The only change I made was to use red potatoes.

This turned out exactly how I was expecting.  I’m very happy with this dish and I make it often now.  It makes plenty!  We love having it the next morning for breakfast served with eggs over easy - wow, nice filling farmhouse-style breakfast.  Usually I make it exactly as written and I’m never disappointed.   Last time I made this I added a couple cloves of garlic.  That was good too.  I’ve used red onion instead of green, and that works well.   I don’t even measure ingredients anymore.  It’s really a reliable ingredient combo.  Sometimes I add more butter - a few tablespoons probably.  If I’m reheating it in the oven, I’ll stir in some cream and that works very well.  I might try a few diced jalapeños in it next time.  I think one could even sub sausage for bacon?  This is a great recipe to make as-is or change it up from time to time.  Always fantastic.

+ Better with Yukon Gold potatoes, and light sour cream to replace the regular sour cream and cream cheese makes it a lighter dish. Red potatoes with skin-on makes this delicious too.
