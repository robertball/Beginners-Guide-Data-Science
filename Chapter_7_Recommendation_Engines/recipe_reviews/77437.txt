This stuff is sooo good!  I made this the other night to go with steamed dumplings we ordered and unfortunately we didn't have enough sauce. For some reason one small cup for me just doesn't cut it.  I used low sodium soy sauce and subbed sesame oil for the chili oil - I also added some finely chopped green onions.  If you want to make it a bit sweeter add just the tiniest bit of brown sugar. You can change it up with ginger as well.  Just play with it to suit your tastes.

This was great.  Over 20 years ago, a Japanese friend of mine showed me how to make this and I had forgotten.  I did not have chili oil, so I used sesame oil.  It turned out wonderful.  My family loved it. Now I will have to try it with chili oil.

This is great and easy!  I lightly drizzle seasame oil on potstickers or dumplings with this and it is a perfect little topper to a great dish!  I also add finely chopped chives or green onions to it.  Thanks!

Wow - this sauce is excellent. At first I thought it was a little too hot, but it actually really goes well with potstickers. I added about 1/2 tbsp of minced fresh ginger to top it off. Really delicious.

Just made this for dinner tonight! It is perfect with potstickers. Had to use hot sesame oil because that is all we had. Will be making again.

Very good as is but after tasting I added ginger, garlic powder and a touch of sesame oil. Used this for potstickers. Yum and thank you!

This was pretty good. It tasted like the packets of sauce that come with the frozen potstickers i buy from the supermarket. The only change i would make is to use low sodium soy sauce because it was a bit too salty for my personal taste. I might also try adding ginger next time like some have suggested. Other than that, great dip. Thanx for the recipe!!

This was so good!  I made it to go along with Butternut squash potstickers and liked it so much I made it again and used it as dressing for grilled chicken salad.

This ratio of 1:1 soy sauce to vinegar is too sour for my taste. I tend to do  2/3 soy to 1/3 vinegar.

Exactly how my Japanese mother made it and how I remember it growing up.  I make mine this way, too. Sometimes, I will use hot sesame oil in place of chili oil.

Just 3 star as written for me. It had too much of a vinegar taste for my palet. I added more soy and grated a pinch of Ginger.

This is a good basic recipe. I like to add 1 chopped Thai chili pepper, black pepper, fish sauce, lemon juice, and a pinch of chopped green onions. Yummy!

It was good we felt still too salty.  Even using low-so soya.  Will tamper a bit but definitely a great base.

I used this recipe to dip simple homemade pork potstickers in. It wasn't bad as is, but I added a little sesame oil because I thought the vinegar/soy combo was a bit strong.

it's ok but the ratio of vinegar and soy is off at least to our tastes. Way to sour I found that 3 or even 4 to 1 was much better

Mediocre at best, but quick and easy.  Really need to make a different one with the shallots or green onions and other ingredients.  A Chinese friend of ours gave us a bunch of pot stickers she had prepared and I made the sauce to go with it.  I would look for something that has ginger and shallots in it instead of just rice vinegar,  soy sauce, and hot oil.  I was disappointed.

Had this with potstickers recently. It was OK, had a decent kick to it but not much else flavor. Will follow some of the other suggestions next time and see if we can kick it up a notch.

I thought this was very good as I could adjust the spice as I can't eat very spicy foods.It really enhanced the taste of the Potsticker.
