Well, it only took me 30 years to find the definitive receipe for pork and sauerkraut...this recipe is great!!  I followed the advice of many of the other reviewers on here by adding 2 large, sliced, granny smith apples, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and 2 16-ounce jars of sauerkraut.  My crock pot seems to need extra help with roasts, so I cooked mine for roughly six hours on low with an additional four hours on high.  The meat was falling-apart-tender, and the kraut had just the right amount of sweet and sour to it...served this with garlic mashed potatoes.  Looking forward to the leftovers tonight!  Thank you for the great recipe!!

I went looking for a recipe for pork and sauerkraut to see if I was missing any ingrediants in my recipe that I've been making on New Years Day every year for 25 years.  Well, here is my recipe!  The only changes I make personally is that I start the stuff on New Years Eve before we go to bed and let it cook all night and all day before we eat it.  I add brown sugar to take the bite away from the kraut (about 2 tablespoons).  The longer it cooks, the better.  It gets nice and browned and my family loves this once a year treat.  We serve with mashed potatoes and applesauce and dinner rolls.  This is THE lucky New Years Day dish to be served for good fortune.  Even better reheated the next day.

Wow! This is definitely a New Year's Day tradition. Being from Pennsylvania, I had to make this.  It was excellent.  I took one 16 oz. bag of Boar's Head Sauerkraut and layered that on the bottom.  Then sprinkled some of the caraway seeds and put the pork in with some salt, pepper, and a little brown sugar. I cut up a large granny smith apple and put that over the pork and then added the other bag of sauerkraut and sprinkled some more caraway seeds.  I added just a little bit of water and set the crock pot on low for 8 hours.  The pork was falling apart.  It went great with Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes and some sweet peas and for dessert Nutty Apple Crisp.

YUM! Made me feel like I was back in Pennsylvania again. My mom would would also brown the pork first and add 1/2 of an onion, thinly sliced and approx. 1 to 2 tablespoons of barbecue sauce to the sauerkraut. It adds a smokey flavor and a nice color.

Yummy but the 5th star is for how easy this is.  I used a whole boneless pork loin that was marinated with onion and garlic (thanks to Costco).  Like others, I added 1/2 can beer, 2 tbsps brown sugar and 2 granny smith apples.  Also doubled the kraut and caraway seeds(next time I'll do even more).  Quartered the apples; didn't add them until 3 hours in or they cook into mush.  I've made with and without apples and prefer the apples.

I felt like I was back in PA for the New Year.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I loved the flavor of the caraway seeds and used two Granny Smith apples and 2 T. brown sugar as previously recommended.  I also added dumplings on top during the last few minutes of cooking... 1 1/3 c. flour, 1/2 t. salt (cannot omit), 2 t. baking powder, 1 egg, and 1/2 c. milk.  You cannot have sauerkraut without dumplings in PA.  Most tender pork roast I have ever cooked and enjoyed!

Good recipe, I added two apples to cut down on the bitterness of the kraut, and browned the pork roast before putting it in the crock pot.Try toasting the caraway seeds,and then add for the last hour, this seems to bring out more flavor.

WE are from PA and love pork and sauerkraut. I buy the WHOLE boneless pork loin, and cut it in half, and use what I need depending on how many are eating here. I do NOT brown it, but I do add 1 - 2 apples, cored, w/ skin on and cut into wedges and about 2 - 3 T brown sugar after I add the sauerkraut, that I do NOT drain. I also like to add homemade hot sausage in  the roaster. I bake mine covered -- and I like to do it very slow and at a low temp....starting off at 300 and reducing to 250.  YUM YUM!!!!!  We also like ours w/ mashed potatoes and applesauce!!!!!!!

This was quite delicious, the only thing I did different was to brown my pork roast before putting it in the slow cooker, otherwise it was the best roast,tender,moist,and just wonderful.

A good, basic recipe to embellish on to suit individual tastes. I used boneless, country-style ribs and, because I prefer my cabbage fresh and hubs prefers his as sauerkraut, a combination of both. Well, actually, to suit MY tastes I admit there was more fresh cabbage (Savoy, which has a milder flavor) and a lesser amount of sauerkraut. Because the slow cooker doesn't, I browned the ribs first, then set them on top the cabbage and kraut to which I added minced garlic, chopped onion and a small amount of melted butter. I omitted the caraway seed. I deglazed the pan I browned the ribs in, then poured some of that rich liquid over the ribs. This was a nice meal, which I served with boiled new potatoes. Once again, however, this proved that there are limited instances where a slow cooker does a better job than conventional cooking methods.

As a chef/caterer, I was looking for a stress free, traditional New Years meal. I was exhausted after the busy holiday season. Not a crockpot fan, but decided to take a chance on this recipe, because of all the positive reviews. You were right! It's a keeper. I also added apple & beer, but no caraway...husband hates it. I would think that it would really enhance the dish though. I also made horseradish mashed potatoes. Yummy! Will make this every New Years day and more!!!

While I'm not much of a saurkraut lover, my Polish step-father thought my making it was a great father's day present, and the rest of the family loved it too.

I have made this for many years.  Mine is a little different.  I add a fresh apple, cut up to the sour kraut, along with a tablespoon or two of dark brown sugar (you can adjust to taste).  Simmer until the apple turns mushy; mash the apple with the back of a fork, and then discard the skin. It almost makes applesauce out of the apple (sometimes, in a pinch, I use applesauce). I make mashed potatoes (usual way) and serve the sauerkraut on top (yes, on top of) of the mashed potatoes and the pork on top of the sauerkraut.  OMGoodness, it is to die for.  You can't eat enough!!!  It has always gotten rave reviews!

In our family, we drained and rinsed the sauerkraut first to remove a lot of the salt. Then the kraut is cooked with some chopped onion, some peeled and chopped apple, a bay leaf -- and a small handful of peppercorns. The onions soften in the cooking while the apple disappears (or is mashed into the kraut when really softened). Try peppercorns instead of caraway seeds! And, yes, I've eaten pork and sauerkraut on New Year's Day almost without exception.

Good recipe. I used jarred sauerkraut and doctored it up with a bit of brown sugar and white wine in addition to the caraway seeds. Browned the pork on the stove top before putting it on top of the sauerkraut in the roasting pan. Baked at 450 for 30 minutes, then lowered the oven temp to 200; 3 1/2 hours baking time for 5lbs of pork. The kraut was watery so I set the pork aside and baked it with the lid off for another 45 minutes and cooked off some of the liquid-- it was delicious!

We made some changes to this and it was wonderful! First of all, we left out the carraway seeds because I didn't think my husband would like their flavor. Second, we added 2 granny smith apples and about a 1/2 cup of beer. The result was fabulous! The pork was so tender. We will make again. Thanks!

UPDATE: MADE THIS TONIGHT (FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG WHILE). I ADDED 2 (PEELED & SLICED) GRANNY SMITH APPLES, 2 T BROWN SUGAR AND DOUBLED UP ON THE SAUERKRAUT, S&P AND CARAWAY. SERVED WITH MASHED POTATOES, APPLESAUCE AND PUMPERNICKEL BREAD. FANTASTIC!!! On a recent weekend trip to Milwaukee, I tried something similar at a popular German restaurant and swore I HAD to make it at home! I came across this recipe (which is also in my "favorites" book) and decided to give it a try. To my dismay, I found this dish to be just "OK." I made this for my bf and parents. Everyone but me seemed to like it. :( I purchased a 3 lb. pork loin roast and it was just right for the 4 of us (2 slices per person). I'ts a good thing that I found a loin roast... I almost picked up a tenderloin filet and am glad I didn't! The butcher told me that a tenderloin would fall apart (and dry out) after several hours in the slow cooker and that the loin roast was exactly what I needed. My only regret is not adding apples or enough brown sugar to sweeten the very acidic, tart kraut (I decided to add 1.5 T brown sugar after reading all the reviews). I also want to note that, as written, this recipe does not call for NEARLY enough sauerkraut. My mom wanted a second helping, but there was none left after dishing out 4 servings. This goes particularly well with applesauce, parsleyed new potatoes and rye bread. I hope to make this again, but with some much needed modifications. Thanks for sharing, Kathie! :-)

I thought this was good.....I took the advice of  other reviewers and browned my tenderloin.  I also really spiced up the recipe with garlic, salt and pepper.  It was great with mashed potatoes.  The house smelled great while it was cooking. I would try with a pork roast next time I think the added fat would do wonders for the end taste.  I will make this again.

Excellent dinner.  My hubby raved about it.   I also added two granny smith (tart) apples and 2 T of brown sugar as suggested in other reviews.   I was so proud of myself....it was that good and will not wait until New years 2013 to make this again.  :)

I like using the crock pot about once a week, and this recipe was outstanding! I ate about 2 portions due to how much I enjoyed it. I did add brown sugar, beer, and Granny Smith Apples like other reviewers had mentioned.

We loved this.  So easy and tasty.  I did add 3 regular sized granny smith's, about a cup of apple juice (had no beer as others had suggested), 2 tablespoons brown sugar, no caraway seeds, and used 32 ounces sauerkraut.  Cooked at 300 several hours and reduced to 200 for about 3.  Served over mashed potatoes.

Absolutely Perfect!  I got lucky and found an untrimmed, bone-in pork loin.  They’re getting harder to find as today’s meat is arriving to the store already pre-cut, without the bone, and the fat trimmed away.  I like about 1/2" layer of fat covering the entire top of the roast.  It is absolutely necessary because it’s the fat from the pork that mellows the sauerkraut and gives it a natural sweet flavor.  You know, the old fashioned flavor just like grandma’s.  That fat is also going to help keep the roast moist while cooking.  When finished, you can trim away the fat and drain the sauerkraut.  Also, a big “no, no” is to over cook a loin roast.  They get can get very dry if over cooked and you really have to keep an eye on them, especially with the new crock pots.   My crock pot had this done in 3hrs and the meat was pulling away from the bone.  I knew I shouldn’t have started it on high for the first hour, but did anyway. Some of the meat was already starting to get dry so I cut it into pieces and let it soak in the juice.  It was fine by dinner time.

Great recipe.  Just like my Mom use to make omitting the caraway & adding cubed potatoes to the crock. Love the flavor of the sauerkraut.  Better the next day.

My PA Dutch family has eaten pork and sauerkraut every New Year's for generations.  Once you try this recipe, you'll never do it any other way.  Perfectly easy, unbelievably delicious.  My family likes a little more sauerkraut, so I use two cans per pork loin.  I also substituted Libby's Bavarian Sauerkraut.  It's milder and sweeter and already has the caraway in it.  A huge hit with these pork and kraut connoisseurs!

Made this for dinner tonight - it was great!!  Used  3.5 lbs boneless pork ribs from Costco, a 32 oz bag of Hebrew National sauerkraut, 4Tbs of brown sugar, 2 red apples, and a can of Molson's beer.  I did not brown the pork, just salted it and put it into the slow cooker.  Did not rinse or drain the SK.  Did not add caraway seeds; don't like them.  Peeled and cored the apples.  Put everything into the crockpot and cooked according to the directions, approx. 7 hours total.  The meat was fantastic and so tender!  The flavor was great!  Next time I will add a couple more apples for a total of 4 (only change I would make when making it again).  Served with boiled, cubed potatoes and applesauce!  It was great and oh, so easy!  Made enough for 4 hearty servings with enough leftovers for another meal for 2.  It was delicious!!  The applesauce and potatoes are a must with this meal IMHO.  Loved the combination of flavors and it wasn't bitter at all, and not too sweet, just right with lots of flavor!

I admittedly have a love-hate relationship with my crock pot.  I love the idea, but I don't often love the results.  ONCE AGAIN, I am not pleased with the texture of the meat that resulted.  Here's the deal:  Adding liquid (what was in the can, plus a bottle of German beer, in this case) to a lean piece of meat makes for a dry-texture.  Yes, it fell apart and was tender.  Yes, the apple and carrot and caraway added a pleasant bent to the sauerkraut part of the dish.  I used Bavarian kraut instead of adding the sugar.  BUT THE MEAT WAS DRY, as essentially boiled meat would be!  I bet that this dish would be great out of the oven.  It's just something about the crock pot......

Really delicious. I received lots of good feedback on it from those who tried it. Strange as it may seem, I made the following alterations: Rinsed the sauerkraut, added a sweet apple cut into slices, seasoned the pork with garlic salt and pepper and added one cup apple juice, one cup water to the cooker. The meat was so tender that by the sixth hour it fell apart when I put the meat thermometer in it.

MY HUSBAND IS A SOURKRAUT FREAK SO THIS WENT OVER BIG.  I FOLLOWED THE RECIPIE EXACTLY UP UNTIL THE COOKING TIME AS WE WERE PRESSED FOR TIME SO I JACKED UP THE TEMP ON THE SLOW COOKER TO HIGH FOR ABOUT 3 1/2 HOURS AND I THOUGHT IT WAS PERFECT, IT LITERALLY FELL APART.  MY HUSBAND THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE EARLIER EVEN AS HE THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT DRY, BUT I LIKED IT.  WILL DEFINITLY PUT IT IN THE ROTATION.

This is beyond easy and was a big success. I am a vegetarian, but this reminded me of New Year's Day growing up in PA. Served with mashed potatoes and it was so tender I could even slice the bone! I did one hour on high and 6 or so on low.

This is not a recipe that I would usually make...It just sounded different so I tried it...It is fantastic, not the best recipe to look at but if you can get by the drab appearence, the flavor is out of this world..the only thing I did different was I got lazy and added four cleaned hardball size red potatoes and let them cook in the beer and oh were they good, cut up with a little butter and some of the juice on them.  This is a great recipe.  Thank you for sharing it.

I'm from PA. and when making pork and sauerkraut, add some brown sugar to taste.  By adding the brown sugar this takes away some
of the tart taste of the sauerkraut.

Terrific recipe! I followed some suggestions and added 1/4 cup brown sugar to the sauerkraut. I also added a chopped apple toward the end of the cooking time. I shredded the pork and served with egg noodles. My family all loved it, and we are not big sauerkraut eaters.

This was excellent! I didn't even have the caraway seeds, but the pork was tender and yummy, not at all dried out like I remember this dish being so often in the past. Try it. If you like sauerkraut, you'll love this meal! Served with mashed potatoes and a salad. Guests loved it too.

Knowing my familys' preferences, i added brown sugar, twice the amt of caraway seeds and pepper, added a chopped onion. Served with applesauce, roasted spuds and Lima beans. This was so good, even _i_ went back for seconds and i rarely have seconds! Thanks, Kathie, for the inspiration for an amazing dinner!

This was wonderful! Caraway was exactly what I was missing!  I did add a cut up apple, a quartered onion, some brown sugar, and some apple juice to the sauerkraut to make it more palatable for my kids, but I loved it as written too.

An unlikely combination that works.  I don't LOVE the taste of caraway seeds or saurkraut but it all came together nicely for something a little different.   Followed the suggestions of others: added 1/2 can of beer, used an apple corer/slicer on 2 apples and placed the wedges all around the pork, added 2 Tbsp brown sugar (sprinkled some on top and some on the apples).  I used Rome apples since I wanted something not so tart and the flavor was very mild, maybe too mild, but still good.  I also seasoned the pork with s&p and browned it first, but that's only because I think the coloring is more appetizing.  I used a 3lb roast, cooked it for 4 hours on high and then turned it to low while I got the side dishes ready, probably another 45 min.  It fell apart and was moist. Definitely serve with applesauce!  Enjoy!

Wow!  This is an after work lifesaver.  I followed the recipe exactly and it only took me 3 minutes before work to throw it together in the crockpot and it is ready when I get home.  I can't emphasize enough how these simple ingredients go together to make a wonderful flavor and super tender meat.

My husband and I are both from PA so we have had many different varieties of "pork and kraut" but this is by far our favorite!  I, too, added the granny smith apple, onion, and brown sugar to my kraut. It is just a great variation to an old-time favorite!  Yum Yum!

This was really good, the pork was super tender.  I work all day so I throw it all in the pot, put it on low and it sits for ten hours until I get back home.  I liked the taste of the caraway seeds, and I did add a Granny Smith apple as suggested by other reviewers, but didn't have any beer to add.  The bf the kraut-lover, was dissapointed that the apple took away the sour from the sauerkraut, (which was the point), so I may try it without the apple next time.  A good, really easy recipe, good wish mashed potatoes.  Will make again.

My boyfriend and I loved it. It was so easy to make. We just used 2 lbs of pork loin but I added 16 oz of saurkraut and we thought it was the perfect amount-- but we love saurkraut. I add any other ingredient but I took someones suggestion and added more caraway seeds. DELICIOUS and simple!

I made this on a busy busy day! I was so busy in fact I forgot to make any side dish such as potatoes. As a last second thought my husband steamed up some rice in the rice cooker (20 minutes) and we served the tender pork and juicy kraut over the rice I wasn't sure how this combo would work, I thought that it would be better with potatoes or dumplings but we had no time. The rice turned out to be so delicious, I wanted seconds.  I recommend serving it over rice even if you are not in a hurry. 
One more thing I love to add a tsp or 2 of bacon drippings to my Kraut so I did add this straight away and OH MAN it's good!!! Give it a try!!

Instead of using the pork loin roast, I used kilbasa and it was great.  The kilbasa was so tender you didn't need a knife and it tasted wonderful

This was a delicious and simple recipe.  My husband loves pork & kraut but I never have cared for it.  I followed the directions with the exception of putting rosemary on the pork roast instead of caraway seeds.  The broth changed the flavor of the sauerkraut somewhat which made me like.  It was a bit more mellow.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is so good and so easy!  I added one apple, about 1/4 cup onion and 2 TB brown sugar.  The taste was perfect and went really well with mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  Totally company worthy, too.

Fabulous recipe! Thanks for it! So easy & delicious. I did not have the carraway seeds so I omitted them & also I doubled the sauerkraut & added 1/4 cup brown sugar. Definitly the best recipe I've found!

Here's how I tweaked the recipe:  omitted: caraway seeds (didn't have any) added:  2 skinned, cored and diced Royal Gala apples and 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar per other reviewers' suggestions
cooked:  8 hours on low
LOVED the results.  The meat was tender and juicy.  I've found that pork tends to be dry when cooked in the slow cooker, but no such issue here.  This was a staple in my home on New Year's Day growing up (Pennsylvania Dutch father!) and this brought back great memories.  Served with mashed potatoes and applesauce.  Thanks Kathie!

Wonderful recipe, thank you Kathie.  Modifications include adding the brown sugar, thoroughly rinsing the sauerkraut, adding a bottle of dark beer and omitting the caraway seeds for my fussy husband.   I added only one apple, next time I will add at least one more as they turned out so yummy.  This one goes into the recipe box.

Very simple and unbelievably easy. My husband thought this was absolutely delicious but the kids and I were just not impressed. I thought it would be better if I played with the recipe a bit, if I make it again. On a side note, this makes EXCELLENT pork reuben sandwiches.

What I used, based on this recipe and other reviewers' suggestions: 2 lbs. pork loin roast, 2-4 cups of sauerkraut with liquid, 1/2-3/4 can beer (I would use less next time as it was a little overpowering), 2 TBsps. each white & brown sugar, two diced green apples, and seasonings (salt, pepper & caraway) to taste. Tossed it all in the slow cooker on low for about 8 hours- When done, shredded the pork to let it absorb more flavour. Served over mashed potatoes. It was tasty, but I think every brand of kraut is different, or maybe because I used too much beer but more sugar was necessary. I made this since I had all the ingredients on hand, however I'm not sure if it will be a repeat.

I have made this several times now but do a few things differently.  I usually brown some chopped proscuitto (or bacon) with onions in a fry pan (really let the onions brown!) and add that to the kraut.  Also grate an apple and a potato into the kraut to thicken the kraut juice and temper the sour a bit.  Throw it all in the crock pot and serve with mashed potatoes--YUM!

Great recipe.  Like others, I added 1/2 cup of beer, and a little brown sugar.  This time I used a 2 pound pork loin and cooked for about 3 hours.  The pork was falling apart!! Will make again.  Thanks!

A friend introduced me to this dish 20 years ago and I fell in love. Since I've been trying to make it myself. But I found this recipe and tried it, and tore it up by myself! I did add apple slices like someone suggested, but I actually prefer the tartness of sauerkraut. Came out delicious!!!

I have been making pork and sauerkraut for many years the same way you do. However after I moved to Ga. I changed things a bit. I buy a Boston Butt instead of the loin.  It is fattier but it cooks up lean. It gives the kraut lots of flavor.  I also add a bottle of dark beer. I have made many southern folks appreciate the Pa. tradition of kraut on New Year's Day.

My husband, our 4-year-old and I all ate this right up. Instead of two cups of sauerkraut, I used two 16-oz. cans because we love sauerkraut. I did take the suggestions of others and added two tablespoons of brown sugar and two Granny Smith apples to the crock pot to help reduce the tartness a bit, and I think two apples was too many; the sauerkraut didn't really taste like sauerkraut any more. Next time I'll just use one.

Disappointing recipe.  Both my husband and I like pork and sauerkraut. Followed the recipe just as written. Found this to be very bland despite the caraway seeds and sauerkraut.  Will not make this again.

I took the advice of other reviewers and added more sauerkraut and a sliced up apple. Will definitely make again, but will wait until an hour before it's ready to add in the apple. I added my apple three hours into the cooking time, as suggested, and my apples were mush. Thanks for sharing.

My husband said this was "superb!" He said he wouldn't mind eating this once a week! I followed some of the advice - adding brown sugar and some apple slices. I had to scale everything down a bit because I only had less than 2 lbs. or pork loin to work with. Personally, I would go easy on the caraway seeds because they do have a strong flavor. If you really enjoy rye bread, than you won't mind their strong flavor. I only used 1/2 of an apple thinly sliced because I was a bit nervous about adding apples. But, they tasted great! I even let the roast get to 170 degrees and it still turned out really moist and pull-apart tender. Yummy!

My neighbor and best friend is from Lancaster County and still has many relatives, now my friends, who still live there. My neighbor asked me if her sister gave me the family recipe for pork and sauerkraut!! I added the brown sugar and a Gala apple (that was all I had on hand) and it added just the perfect amount of sweetness to go with the sauerkraut.  Perfection achieved!!

Ok, maybe I'm partial since I was born and raised in Lancaster, PA, but I love this recipe!  Eating this dish on New Year's Day is a family tradition and has continued to be even though I am now in the South.  I still have friends who look at me funny when I say "pork and sauerkraut" but if I can get them to try it, they are hooked!  I have just purchased a slow cooker and needed this recipe and it was perfect!  Thanks!

I left out the caraway because my PA Dutch gramma doesn't use them.  We go with just the pork and kraut served with mashed potatoes.  You don't need anything else added for a delish Dutchie meal.

This was a great recipe. I added 1/2 dark beer, 1 tbl brown sugar, an apple and some garlic powder as well as the specified ingredients. Thanks for the recipe!

I have never been able to make a pork roast tender and perfect but this recipe does it!  I was planning on adding apples, but at the last minute realized we were all out.  Trust me the roast is still great without it!  I added the caraway seeds and they gave it a great flavor!  In addition to what the recipe called for, I added about two cups of water (maybe because my slow cooker is so large).  It cooked all day, and I just stole a bite and it is DELICIOUS!

This is a really good comfort food recipe. The trick may be in the sauerkraut, buy it in the jar/bag in the refrigerator section of your grocery store. The local brand that I buy is Claussen, the kraut in a can just can't compare. I prepared the recipe as written, adding only a little brown sugar as suggested by previous reviewers. Next time, and there will definately be a next time, I'll try adding the apples. I served this with steamed carrots, rolls, and green salad. The pork roast was so tender and juicy it fell apart and the sauerkraut was excellent. Thank you for a really easy tasty meal.

I loved this, so simple and turned out so delicious. I used a very cheap cut pork roast too.  I used a few more caraway seeds and next time I'll add more sauerkraut because it was so yummy.  I'll making this next for New Year's Day, need all the good luck I can get!!

What a delicious and easy meal. I left it in the crockpot longer since I was at work all day, and the pork got so tender it broke apart. I also threw in a couple bay leaves for added flavor. We had it with mashed potatoes on the side. This is a great cold weather meal but would also be good in the summer since it's so easy and doesn't heat up the house.

Born and raised in Lancaster County. Use a pork shoulder or a butt. No caraway seeds.  Gently salt your roast and if you have store bought kraut and want to temper the bitterness, add an apple, quartered, or an onion.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would. This was absolutely terrific. The timing is perfect on this recipe. It was moist, and melt in your mouth, and the caraway seed flavor was great. I followed what a few others suggested by adding 2 granny smith apples, peeled, cored and sliced into 1/8ths for the last 2 hours and added 2-3 tbls of brown sugar, and I added 1 teasoon of thyme, and doubled the caraway seeds. I cooked this today on New Year's Day 2018, served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, cherry pie and Blue Bell Vanilla Ice Cream..........This is a keeper, thank you so much for a wonderful recipe.

Our family loves pork and sauerkraut and being from PA, I grew up with it as a New years day meal tradition.  This is a classic staple recipe - You can use pork tenderloin, boneless chops and even keilbasa - all of which taste fantastic.  Only difference for us is that we cook a pound of bacon +  a large diced onion (sauteed in a little  bacon grease) and mix it into the kraut.  Since our family likes some tartness to our kraut, we add Brown sugar to taste only if it is too tart, otherwise it gets too sweet.   Layer in 13 x 9 pan with pork in middle of kraut & bake covered in 250F oven for several hours  until pork is tender.   uncover to brown top for last 1/2 hour.   Serve OVER mashed potatos.    DELISH!!

it was good, but would have been better in a low temp oven rather than crockpot.  i like the sauerkraut to be browned.  if you put in a slow oven it will also cook slowly but also become golden brown.  you just stir once in a while and add water when needed.

As a college kid who spent the holidays away from home, it was important for me to still have my pork and sauerkraut for New Years and share it with my friends. This recipe was perfect for a first-timer like me.   I actually let the pork cook in the slow-cooker all night with Martinelli's sparkling apple cider (sooo perfect). I added the rest of the ingredients in the morning and let it cook eight more hours.  All of my friends, including the skeptics, loved it!

I adjusted the recipe the recipe by cooking it in 1/2 a bottle of beer and adding 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar to the sauerkraut. We also cooked it on low for about 11 hours. The kraut was tasty, but our pork was on the dried out side.

Oh, this was so good!  I mixed the sauerkraut with the brown sugar, a dash of BBQ sauce, and some leftover cut-up cabbage.  I put half of that on the bottom of the crockpot and then put the still frozen pork loin in and the rest of the sauerkraut mixture on top.  Then I poured a whole bottle of beer in.  I  turned it on low before going to bed and let it cook all night and all the next day.  It was perfect and perfectly moist too!  Definitely a keeper.

My family and I loved this meal.  It was very easy to prepare and  it tasted delicious.  I did use another posters suggestion about adding a chopped apple to the mix.  It was wonderful, and we have leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.  This will be our good luck meal for each new year.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for the first time New Years Day and it was a BIG hit. Could not be easier. I live very close to Lancaster County and this is as good as I get there. Will be a new New Years tradition, ( as well as all year round)

Yum! So easy and delicious. I used bone-in pork chops and also added 1/2 chopped onion, 2 Tbsp. brown sugar and 2 sliced apples on the advice of another reviewer. I browned the pork chops and the onion before putting them into the crock pot with the sauerkraut, apples, caraway seeds and salt and pepper. I cooked on low for about 8 hours and might have let it go a little too long because the sauerkraut came out very mild and soft..almost too mild! But it was delicious and next time I will use more caraway seeds. I love their flavor (add them to meatballs..so yummy). The meat fell off the bone and the sauerkraut came out with a beautiful golden color. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli, carrots and cauliflower. Definitely a keeper recipe! I loved it!

This came out great with a few modifications.  I added 1/2 of a large chopped sweet onion to the bottom of the slow cooker.  I mixed together 1 chopped apple, a bag of sauerkraut (rinsed), 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and 1 cup of apple cider.  I put about 1/2 of the mixture under the roast and 1/2 on top of the roast.  Delicious!

My family always had this ready at midnight on New Years Eve...for good luck in the coming year.  I do add onion and a little brown sugar.  Must be served with mashed potatos!  Excellent Recipe!

I followed the recipe and added a chopped apple as per some other suggestions.  However, we did not enjoy this meal.  Perhaps we're not used to the cooked sauerkraut.  We love sauerkraut but may not cooked.  Thank you.

I love sauerkraut and hotdogs, so I thought I would love this, but the meat was very odd.  It was tender, not dry, but so soft that it just didn't seem right.  I did add the brown sugar, onion and apple, so the sauerkraut flavor was good.

Super. I made a few changes though. We did not use a pork roast, we used hot dogs and smoked sausage. For one package hot dogs and 8 sausage we used 2 cans sauerkrat, 2 T brown sugar, 1 onion sliced thin, 1/2 t caraway seeds, 2 t bbq sauce, 2 apples, quarted. We sauteed the onion in evo, added the brown sugar, bbq sauce and seeds. After they are cooked I added sauerkraut, mixed together, and placed in slow cooker along with meat. Cooked on low for 2 hours, added the apples and cooked 3 hours more. Very good taste. Thank you

This recipe is so good and so easy to make.  The pork loin was moist too!  I drained all the juice from the kraut and added a whole bottle of Coors Light Beer.  I also added some brown sugar(2 Tablespoons) as some suggested.  I like Caraway seed so I left that in the recipe.  I served this incredible dish with mash potatoes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I enjoyed eating it in 100 degree temp too!!!!!  Can't wait until Fall!

we enjoyed the taste of caraway in this recipe. the 2 lb. boneless center cut roast i cooked came out tender but was on the dry side (what i had in my freezer, next time i'll stick with the recommended pork loin roast). thankfully the juicy sauerkraut helped to keep the meat moist while we ate. this kind of dish tastes better when made a day ahead & serves well with mashed potatoes. thanks kathie!

This was great.  We're not even fans of sauerkraut, but the meat was soooo tender and delish!  Seasoned the roast with seasoned salt and pepper and browned in a little olive oil first. Added an apple and brown sugar as per previous reviewers; also about 1/2 a white onion and some thyme leaves.  Really really good.

This recipe was an unqualified success for us. Last year I tried the Overnight Pork Roast With Cabbage and was quite disappointed, but I did love the rub that that recipe uses. So, this year, I used that rub and then just put the roast in the slow cooker with the sauerkraut. The roast was falling apart tender! What an incredibly delicious and easy recipe!!

I followed other reviewer's advice and added 2 sliced Granny Smith apples and 2 Tbsp of brown sugar.  My husband and I loved it.  The pork was so tender and the saurkraut so good.  I'll make this again - in fact, it will be our New Year's Day dinner going forward.

I make this dish often for my family, but I add one 12oz. bottle of beer to the crock pot - it adds flavor and helps keep it tender & juicy.

This was a good simple recipe.  Used a center cut pork roast and it  was a little dry.  Next time we would use a sirloin pork roast instead or boneless country-style ribs.  We used sauerkraut that was seasoned with dill and garlic & gave it a really good flavor.

It turned out to be delicious!  I added some apples and brown sugar as one person suggested and it added a lot of flavor.   I made half the recipe but I am going to add more sauerkraut next time.  Only thing is that some of the meat was a little dry.

Went over great. I didn’t have a slow cooker so it went in the oven. Baked 350 about 35 minutes. Let it hang out for a few more the kraut got a little crispy on top. Served it with the apple dipping sauce and garlic onion mashed taters

To Sweetjam:  a pork loin roast is not the same as a pork tenderloin.  A tenderloin is really meant for quick-cooking, such as searing in a pan, then a very short trip to the oven or a quick preparation on the grill.  A pork loin is a much larger cut of meat that can be roasted or slow-cooked with great results.

I grew up having pork & sauerkraut every year on New Years Eve & the rest for dinner the next day. We only added the caraway seeds if the kraut was really sour, as they will cut the sourness of it.

This is pretty much how I make mine on New Years.
The only thing missing is the dumplings. Nothing fancy,just basic bisquik and milk dumplings. We grew up eating this and there was always dumplings  along with the mashes potatoes.

I did not have any caraway seeds but there were some in the sauerkraut I used.  I put a little garlic paste on the pork.

So easy and would have been perfectly fine as written.  I love reading reviews to see how to tweak things so added brown sugar, a little beer and some Granny Smith apples - a perfect New Year's day meal.

My favorite cuts of pork for this is shoulder or butt (bone in).   The more connective tissue the better.  Just like pulled pork, only with kraut.  Makes a great sandwich on a hard roll dipped in the juices.

Its a good, moist, savory pork loin with cooked onion and apple.  Unlike a lot of other pork loin recipes, it isn't sweet.  And it is a very good, savory, sour flavor.  Pork loin being one of the leanest and least expensive cuts of meat, I am always looking for ways to make it delicious and eat it without getting tired of it.  This recipe will be made again, many times.

Really good comfort food. And soooo easy. I used a jar of sauerkraut which was about 3 cups worth and the almost 4lb pork came out perfectly moist. However, I also added 2 sliced apples on top (for my toddler), but I think it would still be excellent without them. We enjoyed it with a good dollop of sour cream and had it over gnocchi since we didn't have dumplings -- delicious! The whole family loved it!!

Delicious with changes as other reviewers recommended. Beer, brown sugar and apples. My pork was already cubed, cooked in 6hrs on low served with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.

This was delicious.  I made it according to recipe.  I did add, according to the notes, about 1/2 can of beer, 2 apples, and 2 Tbs. brown sugar.  My mother grated potato and I may try that next time.  It couldn't be better and I will make again and again.  Mashed potatoes and homemade applesauce, Yum!

My favorite meal. I serve it over mashed potatoes like many other reviewers. I put 1 peeled Granny Smith apple and a small Vidalia onion in the food processor and mix that with the sauerkraut (I used the refrigerated bag of sauerkraut) I stir in a handful of caraway seeds and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Then I place the pork on top of the sauerkraut (I love how the pork juices melt into the sauerkraut). This time I used boneless country style spare ribs. I salted, peppered, shook on a little onion powder and spread a little more brown sugar over the meat.  Crock pot on low 6-8 hours. Yum

Very good, basic pork and kraut recipe.   I'm not normally a fan of caraway, but with the long cook time, it blended in quite nicely.   I think some of the recommendations from the other reviewers (beer, onions, apples) would have stepped this recipe up another notch.

Used a pork shoulder roast, and it was delicious. Followed suggestions to brown the roast before placing in the slow cooker and added apples for the last two hours of cooking.

This recipe is good, very good, but adding a Granny Smith apple and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar will do two things: the vinegar and apple give the dish a tangy taste and also reduces the smell of the sauerkraut (if you dislike that).  Do not omit the caraway seeds!

Good, basic recipe. Added extra caraway. Used the fresh, bagged kraut vs. the canned and drained in a colander. Didn't rinse, as we like the taste. Next time, may try a about 1/4 cup crumbled bacon or bacon bits.

I didn't have the time to do roast. 
Sooo I used 6 boneless pork chops. Sprinkled with caraway seeds (tried this recipe because of seasoning) then topped with a can of sauerkraut. 
S/P to taste 
For my oven 350 - 15/-20 minutes covered.
Turned out great! Love the seasoning very "clean" flavor.

I read some of the reviews for this recipe and I never heard of adding the apples.  I to lived in Pennsylvania and my Mom including so many others
that I know have always used brown sugar mixed with the sauerkraut.  By adding the brown sugar to the sauerkraut while cooking it takes away the bitterness and gives it a sweet taste.  I have always cooked my sauerkraut this way.  Add the brown sugar according to your taste.   I prefer mine sweet.

This was so much better than expected!! I used just a 2 lb pork loin (there are only 2 of us) but left the amount of sauerkraut the same. I also added two Granny smith apple and two TBSP of Brown Sugar. Will definitely make again!!

Perfection.  I did two batches exactly as directed and one batch with added apple and brown sugar...then I combined all three batches for serving.  Pork was falling apart and the flavors were excellent.  I can't wait to go back for leftovers.

Only because I changed this recipe a bit did it not receive 5 stars. I used a 4lb bone-in roast (more flavor w/ bone) that I browned in a bit of oil, a large sliced onion that i browned in pan after browning roast--adding a small tad of sugar, 1/8t anise seeds (didn't have any caraway) and 1/8t cumin; a 32oz jar polish kraut w/ caraway seeds, 1 sliced granny smith, 6.75oz apple juice (a juice box). I mixed the apple with the onion and put in bottom, then fat side up roast and apple juice. Cooked in crockpot on L for almost 10hrs. The meat pulled apart, but not fall apart, and had a nice flavor throughout. Made with smashed potatoes and peas per husbands tradition. A keeper for our New Year's Day dinner.

Short on flavor--I added brown sugar, but that lost the sauerkraut flavor. I made too much and thought it would be better the next day, but it just was tired and boring. I'll try again, perhaps the beer is the answer!  I will probably cook this in the oven, as it was so colorless (and I'm retired).

Thanks to previous reviewers' suggestions, I made the following modifications:  used garlic salt instead of regular salt, added 1/2 tsp. thyme, sauteed an onion in a little olive oil and added to sauerkraut mixture, also added a shredded carrot and 2 T. brown sugar. The sauerkraut was not sour tasting due to the brown sugar and the carrot, which also added some needed color. Without these modifications, it would not have been as good.

I will not be making this recipe again. I was hopeing this was going to taste like my Mom's, but not even close.  She makes the REAL German stuff....this tasted too bland for me.

I made this dish at the request of a friend who remembered having it in Ohio when he was young! Followed the recipe exactly except added the apple suggested by others -- did use a dark beer! Per my friend, I served with mashed potatoes. It was very good -- is now on my schedule of meals I cook regularly. It was my husband and my first taste of this Dutch delight but my friend said it was the best he had ever eaten. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe.  Didn't use caraway, added granny smith apples and brown sugar but next time I'll try using beer as it seems like it would work nicely.  My husband doesn't like sauerkraut but liked the recipe anyways.

My husband ate HALF of this - he LOVED it!  The whole family dug in...the pork fell apart with a fork.  Added the onion and a couple of diced Macintosh apples per other reviews. Served w/mashed potatoes.   Excellent results w/almost zero effort.

My husband liked this a lot.  I halved the recipe, added a granny smith apple, added hard cider (instead of beer) and did not halve the caraway seeds.  I thought it was a little bland, but I would make it again.

Very moist and tasty. It just needed a little something extra. I'll try the apple next time. Did taste better the next day though. I'll definitely keep it around.

This recipe is pretty good!  The pork was moist and it pulled apart nicely.  Like others I added 2 chopped granny smith apples (no sugar).  I also added 1 12 oz can of coke. Next time I won't add salt to the meat as it was a tad too salty for my taste.

This was really delicious. My husband is not a fan of pork but he loved this meal. I added a beer and one granny smith apple as suggested by others. I served it with a side of mac and cheese and fresh broccoli. Really, very good and I'm pretty picky.

Pennsylvania Dutch Pork and Saurkraut is always good, weather you make it in the slow cooker or not. Cook it with apples (grany smith, gala, or pink lady) to take some of the Sour out of the saurkraut. Also, you might want to rinse the kraut befor useing it, to take a lot of the vinigar off of it.

I got a Crock Pot for Christmas and this was my first try at a slow cooker meal. I loved it! I also added an apple and brown sugar.  I only used a 3lb roast so I probably could have reduced the cooking time by about an hour.  Thanks for a great first!

Put pork loin (not tenderloin) in slow cooker (cover in spices), added a pack of Bob Evan regular sausages, then added sauerkraut on top. Cooked on high for 1 hour, then low for another 5 to 6 hours. Excellent and easy!

This recipe turned out perfect for me.  I took advice from a few reviewers and layered a jar of sauerkraut in the bottom with  T. of brown sugar then the caraway seeds on top.  Then the seasoned pork roast, then more sauerkraut on top of the roast with brown sugar and caraway seeds.  I cut up two Granny Smith apples and added them the last two hours of cooking.  My family loved it.

I had a small piece of loin, about 2 lbs. Followed directions to the letter, in addition I added apples. My cooker is fast because this was done much earlier that anticipated. Served with mashed potatoes, had used 2lb. bag of kraut so that was our vegetable. I would make again
My husband is Slavic and neither of us has ever heard of this dish for New Years—it made a great Monday night supper.

I browned the roast in a fry pan first to render out some of the fat and give it more flavor. Seasoned the top of the meat with garlic powder, salt and pepper, before I browned it. Also, rinsed the kraut to make it a little less salty and I think it tastes better that way too. Anyway you decide to cook it, you will love it!

I first had a similar dish while living in Harrisburg, PA several years ago on New Years Day at a local fire hall. Back in the south we always had ham hocks and black eyed peas on New Years Day. I was glad to find this recipe because it’s absolutely delicious! I did as others have suggested and added a Granny Smith Apple and some brown sugar. I layered the bottom of the slow cooker with 16oz of sauerkraut and sprinkled with Caraway seeds, added the loin, salt and pepper, brown sugar, topped with slices of apple, another 16oz of sauerkraut, and sprinkled with more Caraway seeds. I cooked a 3lb loin on high for three hours and then on low for five more. It was fall apart tender and absolutely perfect!

I have made this several times now and actually served it to my mother-in-law and others who have made Pork & Sauerkraut all their lives. They have all said it is the best they've ever had! I do add about 6 oz. of Heineken (or other lager) to the cooker and it enhances it a bit. Very good meal for being so easy to make!

Tried this recipe as written.  It was just ok.  Will go back to my regular recipe that my adult son loves and which I learned from my Austrian mother in law.  USE smoked pork..Chops , ham hocks or lleftover meaty ham bone.  Have often used smoked farmer sausage cut in thirds.  If you want to tone down the kraut ..Quick rinse and squeeze it.  Put a med. sized onion chopped into 2tb oil and wilt it add 2 garlic cloves minced and cook  a couple of minutes so as not to burn garlic.  Add 2 level TB of flour and cook it out with the oil and veg  ..then add a cup or so of water or stock and mix.  If you added enough fluid it should not be thick.  Add your drained kraut, mix and adjust fluid amount to make it very moist like stew.  Add caraway and or paprika smoked or not to your taste.  Add black pepper to your taste.  Cook on med low for about 30 min.  or more adding liquid as needed ti keep from sticking  During this cook time  add your pork.  This method is best for smoked pork ie smoked ham bone ,smoked hock or smoked sausage.  Cook  the meat into the kraut for as long as it takes.  Sorry on time.. of course smoked hock takes longer than smokey sausage or precooked ham bone...just stir often and add water as needed.  Done right this will convert your kraut hating diners.  Serve with a good mustard and bread dumplings called knoedael sp?  see on line for recipe.

This was so easy and delicious. I did make the suggested changes with brown sugar and  apples. The pork was tender and the sauerkraut was delicious. My hubby who is not a pork fan enjoyed it also.

I made the recipe exactly as written. The sauerkraut was good but the pork loin roast was tough & stringy. It fell apart but was very dry. Very disappointed.

I left out the caraway seeds and used 2 qts of sauerkraut instead of 2 cups.  It still wasn't enough.  I feel that browning the pork is an important step before putting it in a crockpot.

This is a really good, comfort food recipe.  I used a four pound pork loin roast, maybe double the kraut, brown sugar and caraway plus two peeled, cored and sliced Granny Smith apples. I rinsed the kraut as the home made stuff I had was very salty.  It went in the slow cooker on low for 6 1/2 hours an d came out really delicious. Definitely a do-over. thank you!!

Only change i made was to cut the recipe down to 4 servings. This was delicious and reminded me of my mom's cooking for  New Year's many years ago. She was half German and half Irish.

This dish was very simple to make. My family loved it, surprisingly. We didn't use caraway seeds but I made to sure to heavily season it with salt and pepper. We use a pork loin, poured half a bottle of saurkraut and juice over it and cooked it for about 6 hours. If you're German, you'll love it.

Made this with the suggested changes made in the other reviews: doubled the sauerkraut, added brown sugar and two sliced granny smith apples.  It tasted great, but the roast was a little tough.  For some reason all my slow cooker roasts end up that way :-(

I used a full can of kraut, 2 TBSP brown sugar, 2 green apples, sliced thinly.  I also couldn't find caraway seeds, so I used an "everything" rub (1 TBSP per pork loin) which had caraway seeds, garlic, onion, salt, pepper, poppy seeds.  Got from the baker at Giant Eagle.  This was great!!!

Simply divine!!!  It's a real KEEPER and I will make it this way every New Year's Day from now on.  It was soooo good that my husband and I ate leftovers this morning for  breakfast and he is already looking forward to leftovers for lunch!

I used about 3 pounds of boneless pork tenderloin,  one 32 ounce jar of sauerkraut with juice,  a pinch of salt and pepper,  and 1 teaspoon caraway seeds. I also took the advice of other viewers and added 2 peeled and sliced Granny Smith apples  and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.   I cooked it on high in the crock pot for 1 hour and 15 minutes and then turned it down to low for 7 hours.  The pork was so tender and moist and the sauerkraut had just the right amount of sweet/sour taste to it.

I served this dish with mashed potatoes, a side of homemade veggie soup, and a garden salad.  For dessert I made baked cinnamon apples and served with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream!  It was a BIG HIT!

I always add apple pieces, some rasberry jam, brown sugar, garlic powder,  onion, had a small container of  chopped peaces in juice so added that. Always use Silver Floss Sauerkraut that doesn't have much fluid. Did add a little more water with a spoon, probably have too much. 
Never did crock pot and got a late start but not worried. Didn't use caraway seeds.
Used extra apples cored and steamed in pot. Once peel pulls off reduced from medium heat to low someimes sweeten but these were variety so sweet and juicy enough. On low and may turn iff or add some water?  Will peel potatoes and mixer mash when cooked enuff  add butter and milk while mashing.   
Always did pork tenderloin which this is in oven.  NYD was my Christmas party sometimes 30 friends.  Did appetizers to dessert.  Look forward to moving back to PA  and doing that,  again!  This should be moist

I used a Boston Butt roast because I think its a better cut to use in a crockpot since it doesn't get as dry when cooking.   I salt and peppered the roast after searing.  Then I poured 3 cups of water, 2 tsp of chicken bullion and 1 tsp of beef bullion from Pensky's as well as 3/4 c of dark beer over the roast in the crockpot.  Once the roast was halfway done I removed half of the broth to use for gravy.  After that, I added the drained sauerkraut and a couple of sliced apples to continue cooking.  (Sauerkraut plus roast broth doesn't make the best gravy lol) Served with mashed potatoes, gravy, and steamed broccoli.

My family is from Lancaster County and we were raised on this dish.  I make it exactly as is written with one exception. I always use pork shoulder/butt. Why use an expensive cut of pork? This can also be made on top of the stove cooking on low for 2 to 3 hours depending on weight.

I had everything on hand to make this dish.  My pressure cooker does not have a sauté feature so I browned the  pork in a bit of olive oil and butter on the stove.  I then placed the pork on the sliced onions in the pressure cooker.  I deglazed the sauté pan with a bit of the cranberry mixture, placed that on the pork and a few minutes later a perfect roast with a yummy sauce.  I omitted the tarragon only as a personal preference - just a taste for which I do not care.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that is quick, delicious and easy.

I made this with a modification.  In a bowl, I pre-mixed the sauerkraut with salt, pepper, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, and a heaping tablespoon of molasses. Then piled the mixture on top of the pork in a slow cooker.
* Everyone loved it, including the kids

My wife and I usually made it with a lot more sauerkraut.  We also added a cup of "Saucy  Susan" which is  like an apricot preserve or Duck Sauce.  Yummy especially if you like sauerkraut.

I make this with pork shoulder cut up in pieces and shred raw potato in to absorb some of the juice from the kraut.  I then shred the pork after its done and mix all together.  Don't be afraid to use extra caraway seeds...tastes better day 2 or 3!!!

Braised the pork loin with salt and pepper. Added an apple 1/2 an onion and a wedge of finely sliced cabbage to sauerkraut. Just to take the edge off. Otherwise, followed recipe

My husband ate it while I was at a meeting, but I couldn't bring myself to try it. He didn't want it again so the dogs got to eat the rest. I was disappointed. It was dry and not enough flavor.
