I thought this was a great base for any creative spins.  For example,  I used Elk instead of ground beef,  "Slap your mama" seasoning, and Jalepeno with the onion.  I would recommend cooking the bacon to crisp remove it then cook onions followed by burger. That way it stays bacon not fatty ham :)

Loved it. It was a breeze to make. I added a can of RoTel and used Miracle Whip since we hardly ever use Miracle Whip. I will make this again.

Made this for the first time tonight as I recently started on Keto. The topping is very tasty.  The only change I might make next time is to add salsa or some liquid to the beef mixture.  There was a lot of it and it was kind of dry.

This came out great using 1 teaspoon each of onion powder and garlic powder, and 3/4 teaspoon of seasoned salt. Otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe. Excellent!

This was pretty good, but not 5 stars. I prefer my bacon crispy, next time I will microwave it instead of cooking on the stove. I ended up picking out a lot of soggy, fatty pieces before putting into pie dish. I also ended up draining the beef before AND after baking, it was too greasy. Lastly, I used a lot less garlic powder and onion powder, I think 1T each would be overkill. With these adjustments, I would definitely make again, as everyone liked it.

Nice brunch quiche! Very versatile too. You could add chilies, mushrooms, green pepper... I followed the recipe with the exception of cooking the bacon separately then crumbling it into the cooked beef mix. Also used 1/2lb breakfast sausage along with the 1lb beef ‘cause it’s what I had. It’s a little salty so if you aren’t into that, you could go with garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

My 16 year old son made this dish!  Only change was substituting evaporated milk for the heavy whipping cream.  It wasn't dry at all.

This was really good! We had all ingredients on hand except heavy cream, I substituted whole milk and it still worked out great. Only change I made was to thoroughly add salt and pepper and garlic powder to each step (browning onions/bacon, ground beef, and the egg mixture) I also coated the pie pan with butter. 
Good flavor, and the cook time was exact. 
Delicious. Will be making again!

So... I cannot tell you enough how delicious and satisfying this recipe is. I use Hormel real bacon bits because I'm lazy but still comes out perfect. Also I use Olive oil Mayo instead of regular.  Perfect for potlucks or dinner tonight!

I made this Quiche a couple of time, I love it.  What the instructions should also read is to season it to taste.  But we love it in my house.

Sorry, I just didn't like this, which was so disappointing as I'd been looking forward to it!  Pretty bland as written.  I'd rather have sausage or maybe ham for added flavor.  Would need to incorporate seasoning. However, since it made quite a bit, my husband was a trouper and ate it for lunch until it was gone.  I remind myself that life would be dull if we all enjoyed exactly the same things!  This isn't one of mine.

I've had low-carb cheeseburger quiches before, and they taste similar to this one. The major problem with this recipe is that it is entirely too salty...and I even left out the additional salt and pepper called for. If I make this again, I will probably cut the garlic salt in half.

This quiche is great!  I was looking for something different and this was perfect.
