Add what you want and make this recipe yours! I used chicken, mushrooms and spinach in the filling.  I also used half green chile and red enchilada sauce.  Poured it right in the pan and it actually looked as fabulous as it tasted.  I did prefer the green sauce better but both were good.  I'll try shredded beef or pork with green chili sauce and a dash of sour cream next time.

Amazing recipe! I made 1/2 with green sauce & other with red. Both are good, though I do enjoy the green best. The only reason I did half & half is because I only had 1 (15 oz) can of green sauce, & so had to improvise & use red for the other half. Very good though. I will be making this again!

Yum! I used 4 oz of Neufatchel and a few dollops of fat free sour cream and also added fresh diced tomato to the enchiladas. I also grilled the chicken instead of baking it and used olive oil instead of butter. Great flavors - yummy, creamy comfort food.

I took the meat off of a rotisserie chicken from our local deli. I also added a few ounces of sour cream to the filling. It was amazing! Can't wait to make it again.

I loved this recipe.  I did alter it a bit by cutting back to 1 jalapeno and I add black beans and shoepeg corn to the filling.  It was met with rave reviews on Father's Day.  I also used white corn tortillas.

this was the first time I ever tried making enchiladas and was pleasantly surprised at the oucome of this recipe. My family loved it!  I needed some more spice so I added more jalapeno to taste. I am making beef enchaladas tonight using this recipe, altered, using salsa. Wish me luck :)

I loved this recipe! It is really good, but we like it more spicy, so we add more jalapenos. Also, I dont bake my chicken, just add the spices to water and boil it and it tastes great! Another thing I like to do is not bake it. If you add everything together in a skillet and then just pour your enchilada sauce on top, they dont go soggy and they taste much better! Enjoy!!

Ingredients tasted great. All good except for flour tortillas. These are really burritos. Enchiladas are made with corn tortillas. And no, it's not a matter of personal preference. It's a fact.

This was an easy to make tasty main dish. I made half of the enchiladas without the Monterey Jack cheese to please family members, and they still turned out well. I expected a lot more heat from the spices and jalapeno peppers, but it really wasn't that spicy. However, I like a lot of spice and heat, so someone else might find it just right. I will probably serve this again.

These were delicious. I have never used cream cheese in enchiladas before. Yum! I had to use a spicy red enchilada sauce because that was what I had on hand. I was cooking for 2 so I cut the recipe in half and made it in a 9x9 inch pan. Served with Cuban Style Yellow Rice also from this site. Will definitely make again when I am looking to use up cream cheese.

I used this recipe with a few minor adjustments: I used corn tortilla/taco shells instead of flour (about 20 of them,) doubled the cream cheese, used three 10 oz cans of green enchilada sauce and used about 3-4 cups of shredded mexican variety cheese (I out some in the dish before the enchiladas were laid, put some in the chicken/cream cheese mix, then a spoon full on top before rolling the shells and then covered the enchiladas again at the end - if it's not clear, my family likes them cheesy!! :) ) I also doubled the dry ingredients in the stuffing mix since the cheese was doubled.

They were a hit with my family and at work!

I really thought that this would be great. No problem with the heat, it just didn't have any wow factor. Evidently the rest of the family thought so also. I had half the pan left, and with my other recipe there have never been anything left. I do think that the left overs will go great in an omlet.

I have made this dish several times now, and it always turns out perfectly. I've even altered it, switched to shredded beef, used traditional corn tortillas and  red enchilada sauce, and it's equally as delish!

My only suggestion is that canned enchilada sauces can be hit or miss. I always use Hatch, red or green enchilada sauce, as I think it tastes better than the others, and generally has a thicker consistency.

I made two minor changes. I used one jalapeno (I like medium level of spice) and I cooked the chicken in a slow Cooker (my favorite method when I need to shred chicken). Very tasty; this will be added to the finner menu rotation.

Don't get mad at me, I am going to be one of those people who rates a somewhat adjusted recipe!  I think the basic flavors are the same, so it deserves the score.  We really enjoyed this.  I collect the changes from the other reviews, i.e., grilled the chicken added beans (I used black bean soup); but also had to improvise when I bought the wrong enchilada sauce.  Bought 8 oz of green taco sauce instead, which would not nearly be enough to make up for what I then read had to be 28oz of enchilada sauce!  So I added about 1/3 c taco sauce, about 1/2 cup left over salsa from the frig, all the broth from the bean soup and 1 cup chicken stock. Also sautéed mince garlic with the onions instead of using powder.  We thought this was DELISH and actually kind of Wow! My spices were fresh, perhaps that helped. It will definitely replace our old family recipe for chicken enchiladas (Sorry Mom!).

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. My boyfriend raved about them. He's worked in the restaurant business for years. He said "those are better than any I have had at any restaurant ever.".  They were incredibly easy to make and so delicious!!  I've made them several times and each time everyone has loved them.

These were very good.  I used low fat options with the cream cheese, grated cheese, and  sour cream and whole wheat tortillas and nobody complained about it being "healthy"!

I had only cream cheese and chicken on hand so searching by ingredients brought up this recipe.  I am so glad I tried it.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except that I was out of cayenne and substituted mozzarella for the monterey jack.  Excellent dish!

Wow!  This is the first time I have felt strongly enough about a recipe to rate it. I made this as written except my store didn't have 28 oz cans of green enchilada sauce so I bought 3 - 10 oz and ended up using only 2. These enchiladas had great flavor and were as good, if not better, the next day.  I like mild spice level and these were perfect for me. I suggest following the recipe exactly as written. I'm sure it would also be great with other ingredients added but it's not necessary. Fabulous as is.

A tip on handling jalapeños...wash your hands with MILK immediately after handling the peppers. It will neutralize the burn capacity of the juices and seeds. This works with both fresh jalapeños and those from a jar. No more need of awkward rubber gloves.

Made per the receipe with one exception - used Jack/Cheddar mix instead of straight Jack - it was fantastic. Great flavor and just the right amount of heat for us. Not difficult and went together easily. Will make again - and will probably not modify further. Thanks for the great receipe!

The filling I thought was great, but the 28oz of green enchilada sauce combined with the flour tortillas was very slimy.  The sauce didn't soak in at all, just sat on top and there was way too much of it.  It was fine the first meal, but as leftovers almost turned my stomach.  I think I will try this again, but use green salsa instead.

I don't have much time to prepare dinners during the weeknights so I just substituted all the spices with a packet of taco seasoning :) I used a small can of diced chili's because I'm a baby when it comes to spicy. It was great, loved it and will make it again!

Yummy! I made it without the cayenne... just the right amount of spice for the non-spicy food eating dinner companion :)

To date, my favorite recipe I have gotten from Allrecipes.com! My fiancee looooves Mexican food and he vouched for these..."best enchiladas EVER!!" My only suggestion is if your chicken breast are on the larger side, use more cream cheese.

Reminiscent of jalapeno poppers (which I love!). I used corn tortillas due to wheat allergies and substituted a small can of fire roasted chiles in lieu of the jalapeno for more of that "popper" taste. Other than that, followed the recipe to a "T" which stands for terrific!  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty and soooo easy. Shredding a rotisserie chicken saves even more time. Only thing I left out was the jalapenos because I don't care for too much heat. This flour tortilla recipe is a find because  the family members aren't fans of corn tortillas .

Every time I make this we have zero leftovers, to the point that more and more friends keep showing up. If there was a restaurant that had this on there menu it would be the only item needed and they would be profitable.

I was intrigued by this recipes--who doesn't love cream cheese? I adjusted the recipe slightly: I omitted jalapenos and added some black beans, and sauteed mushrooms and onions. I ended up adding more of the spices and a little of the green sauce to the mixture because it was a little bland. 

Overall, a good recipes. The cream cheese is very good with the green sauce. If the hubby weren't afraid of jalapenos I would have added those (I will next time anyway). With persona tweaking, this is a great recipe.

Very good.  I like more heat so I used 3 jalapenos and the Kraft Cheddar Pepper Jack Shredded Cheese.  Next time I'll use more cheese on top and probably double the cream cheese mixture.

Very good!  My family raved over it as well.  The only changes I made was half red and half green enchillada sauce because that I was all I had.  I also only used one jalepeno pepper.  I will certainly have to make this again!!!

We LOVED it! I used rotisserie chicken, 8 oz cream cheese, 6 oz pepper jack cheese then left OUT all the additional spices and it was PERFECT for both my husband and I. Plan to put it into our regular dinner lineup!

We definitely enjoyed this variation of enchiladas! Following the reviews of some others, I decided to pad my filling with chopped roma tomatoes, since I happened to have some on hand. We didn't have onion on hand so I chucked a bunch of onion powder into the mix. Used chicken meat off a rotisserie chicken and a full 8oz of neufchatel cheese in place of cream cheese. Honestly, this recipe is soooo yummy. We did not even top our enchiladas with shredded cheese and these were plenty delicious. Especially love the kick of heat the jalapenos give.. MMMM!

This one is definitely a keeper!  This recipe explodes with flavor! My husband was repeating "this is SOOOO good". I didn't have the green sauce so I subbed regular salsa and I know it would be even better (if possible) with the sauce called for. I can't wait to impress friends and family with this! Thank you for sharing!

I suggest using old tortillias or corn. Fresh flour tortillias became soggy. Also unless you like very spicy use the mild green sauce.

Pure spicy goodness! My shortcut is to use smoked pulled chicken that I buy at the grocery store. A can of Hatch Green Enchilada sauce, and away we go! Melting the cream cheese into the sautéed onion and jalapeño is a stroke of genius! Spices in the sauce and also in the chicken packs the perfect punch! I used low carb tortillas but this would be great with flour or corn as well. In fact, I could just scoop the cheesy chicken mix into a bowl and scarf it down! I’ll be making this often!

This recipe came out really good. I used Colby Jack cheese instead of Monterrey Jack. Instead of flour tortillas I used corn. I fried the tortillas in a bit of oil to soften them before filling. I ended up using a little more cheese and had about 1/4 can of enchilada sauce left over. Thanks for the recipe:)

I have made this recipe before without any changes. Just made it again and have to say could be the best recipe on this site. As a side I used sour cream and a store bought salsa. Fantastic! Bon appetit.

Great base recipe, I thought it needed a little more of the ingredients. I recommend---  a couple cloves of real garlic instead of powder, 3 jalapeños + using pepperjack cheese was the perfect not too spicy/not too wimpy, added a big plop of sour cream and doubled the cumin/ chili powder in the filling as well as doubled the cheese both inside the enchiladas and on top. I shredded a rotisserie chicken from the store to make it extra fast/easy. All the changes I made to the filling made me overmix it and turned it into more of a chicken mush. It tasted delicious but wasn't great texture lol so be careful not to make my mistake by adding the chicken last, after you've tried it and suited to your tastes :) would be awesome to add corn/black beans I think I'll do that next time. Also, I didn't even use the entire can of enchilada sauce and they still came out pretty soggy. I'll use half the amount next time.

I love this recipe! The only thing I change; I boil two large boneless skinless breasts in chicken broth and diced jalapenos for about a half an hour and then shred! I use Hatch (medium spice) green enchilada sauce and it's truly DELICIOUS!

Just a little labor intensive, but so worth it! I followed the recipe exactly and the Enchiladas were so good! Great flavor! Easy to prepare, just took a little longer than I thought. Not a big deal though. I will make these over and over!

AMAZING!!!  My husband and I loved the flavor as well as the heat!  We have a tomato allergy in the family, so it's wonderful to find an enchilada recipe that doesn't call for tomatoes.  We didn't change a thing, except to use colby jack cheese instead, as that was all we had on hand.  This will definitely be our go-to enchilada recipe from now on!!

This is spectacular!  And really easy to prepare.  Made less of a mess in the kitchen than I made the next night making spaghetti with jarred tomato sauce and sausage.  I cooked the chicken by "poaching" it in the microwave with only salt and pepper because I didn't notice the recipe called for the additional spices until it was already in the microwave.  I blanched at the tablespoon of garlic powder (not to be confused with garlic salt!) but went ahead, and it was so good!  I could not even pick out garlic as a distinct flavor in the final dish.  I had leftovers for dinner last night, and it was just as delicious the second go.  I am chuffed that I have four servings in the freezer (my brother ate a whole one, I had a half at each meal) to enjoy.  I accompanied it with my version of Mexican rice (baked, using tomato bouillion and sauteed onion) and refried beans.  It is pleasantly spicy using the prescribed amounts of spices.  I would not change a thing.

These are the bomb! Hubs and I love them. I like to add spinach to mine, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly. Going to have them tomorrow for New Years day dinner, but planning to make them with seafood instead of chicken. Can't wait to try them with shrimp and crab. Yum!

I have been a member on this site for a few years but this is the first time a recipe was SO good, that I felt the need to write a review for it. I made it exactly as written, with the only change being that I used queso fresco instead of cream cheese to make it more authentic and it was delicious! I was worried it might be too spicy (I'm kind of a wimp with heat) but it was great! It had a kick without being overpowering. The seasoning on the chicken was perfect, but it did seem a little dry, next time I may add some of the enchilada sauce to the filling or boil the chicken instead of baking it. I look forward to making this again!

These enchiladas turned out awesome. I used a rotisserie chicken, corn tortillas and extra jack cheese. Perfectly spicy and very filling. My tortillas were taco size so the enchiladas were kinda small but both of us could only eat just one. We had beans, rice and guacamole though so that's probably why. Definate keeper!

I made this recipe 2 days ago with a green enchilada sauce I found on a u-tube tutorial. it was called Senor Vecino's New Mexico Green Chili Enchilada Sauce E35.wmv by David Garcia. It was fantastic!!! No leftovers,and I made 2 pans. The enchilada was good, but with the sauce it was PERFECT!

I cut the garlic powder in the filling back to a teaspoon (a tablespoon just seemed excessive to me), used a homemade red enchilada sauce and corn tortillas. I did fry my tortillas in oil before filling them. Not a bad recipe, the husband and kids enjoyed it. I did like the cream cheese filling though I think it could use a little more of the other spices. I would try this again but tweak it a little more to give it more flavor.

The hubs says this is fantastic.I seasoned the chicken and cooked it in an instant pot and doubled the cream cheese and seasoning for the peppers.Instead of the green I used red enchilada sauce. 
The instant pot made this a quick and tasty dinner.

So good even though I totally cheated!!!  I have tried multiple enchilada recipes through the years and none of them turned out. Until this one!  I used rotisserie chicken breast.  I didn’t use butter but rather just sautéed onion and about 1.5 to 2 tblsp jar diced jalapeño in cooking spray. Then I added the cream cheese and melted it a little and added chicken and second set of spices. I used hot pepper cheese shredded cheese. I did use green enchilada sauce. Perfectly spicy and yummy. Absolutely a keeper and will make many times. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were really good, but very rich! I made the recipe as written, but next time I might try to make the filling a little less thick. Maybe substitute half of the cream cheese with sour cream.

Made this recipe according to the directions given and we loved it. The chicken and cream cheese mixture had great flavor and the jalapeños gave it a delicious kick. These also reheated well in the microwave. I will definitely be using this recipe again exactly as written—no changes needed!

I used fresh garlic and more jalapenos in mine. I honestly never measure spices- just feel it out, but I gotta say, this was quite delicious and my husband loved it. Quote, "you better put some away for yourself, because if you don't I'm going to eat all of it." Oh!! And this was incredibly easy to make.. I'm saving this to make again.

We did the recipe, we just kind of sprinkled seasoning on everything, used garlic salt instead of garlic powder (its all we had),  and used some 505 green chili...all over the top... it was great.

I had some left over chicken we roasted in oven the night before so I used this but added the seasonings when reheating, used a can of hot green Chiles, hot jar jalapeños diced, and added the cream cheese to chicken mixture. While that was melting I sautéed my onions with butter and added to chicken mixture. These were fantastic.

It is a little spicy and I normally do not like green enchilada sauce, however, we loved this recipe. I did add an extra 1/2 block of cream cheese and 1/2 small can of cream of chicken. It cut the spiciness just a little as my husband doesn't like a lot of heat because of heartburn. He never eats left overs and the next day he was digging thru the fridge looking for some!!!

Liked it but I would increase the sauce next time. I also had to keep it heated a while longer before assembling the enchiladas and putting them back into the oven so that may have had something to do with it.

My entire family enjoyed this recipe, and considering my daughter is the pickiest eater I have ever known....THAT IS HUGE! I will definitely be making this again. I think next time though i will omit the onions or maybe do less onions. That was my daughter's only complaint. :)

My husband and I really enjoyed this one.  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts and more than the recipe called for but it turned out well.  Very flavorful.  I followed the quantities for seasoning the chicken and started to on the mix, but ended up just eyeball adding the rest of the spices.  Delicious!

Loved this!  I went by the recipe for 7 servings.  It fed 2 adults one dinner and barely enough for 2 adults the next day dinner.  And, no sides were served.  The 28 oz. enchilada sauce is too much! I only used 1 and 1/2 8 oz. cans and the outcome was creamy with a nice consistency when mixing with cream cheese and shredded cheese.  Was afraid it would be thin/watery with additional canned sauce.  Very good and looked awesome in the baking dish.  We will have again.  Don't cut back on jalapenos as I did not add at all and it could have definitely used that heat!  And, we are very "mild" when it comes to heat

I followed the recipe except I made 8 enchiladas and add Cotija Mexican cheese on top along with cheddar cheese.  My family really liked them. Chicken filling was delicious .  (Picture is before I baked them)

Absolutely delicious. Immediately a part of my regular rotation. I cooked frozen chicken breasts in my Instant Pot while getting everything else ready to save time (and cutting down on how long my oven was on here in Arizona).

Loved by all, thank you for making me look like a good cook!
I was in a hurry so I sauteed raw fresh cut chicken tenders in the butter in a skillet instead of pre-baking chicken breasts.  Also didn't have any jalapenos, but it still turned out fantastic!  Had some cilantro on hand so I sprinkled on top.
Definitely will make again!

We really liked this enchilada version, but my family also loves jalapenos!  I used straight green sauce so I could use up the entire can, and I think we prefer it over the red sauce.   Also tried half corn and half flour totrtillas, bot h were good but corn did not hold up very well.  Will definately be making this again!

I added 2 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder, rotisserie chicken (because I had some leftover), extra jalapenos and homemade enchiladas sauce since I didn't have any on hand and this is an amazing dish that I will make again .... totally recommend!

Actually been making them for years. My mom makes them and taught me about 15-17 years ago. But she calls them Sour cream chicken enchiladas and they call for sour cream instead of cream cheese. They are amazing.

AMAZING! I doctored mine up quite a bit. Seasoned my chicken with McCormick Kickin’ Chicken, used jarred jalapeños cuz that’s all I had, and poured some jalapeño juice into the green enchilada sauce cuz I like mine hot. And I hand grated super sharp cheddar and jack - I rarely use bagged cheese - cuz that’s just gross.  Topped with a dollop of sour cream and hot sauce. Thumbs up!!

My husband and daughter LOVED these SO MUCH they wanted me to make them again the next day.  I forgot to pick up fresh jalepeno's at the grocery store, so I used pickled jalepeno's because that is what I had on hand.  DELICIOUS!  I also used light cream cheese, and served them with light sour cream, in an attempt to make these a little healthier.

Great recipe. Made it exactly as written and it was a big hit. Plan to make it tonight, substituting shrimp for the chicken just to change it up. Thanks for sharing, this will become a standard in our house.

I stuck to recipe for this first go around. I might change a few things if I make again. Definitely needs more cheese. But all around very good.

OMG!!!! I have always made beef enchiladas with red sauce, but wanted something different. Checked out recipes on Allrecipes, and found Chicken Cream Cheese Enchiladas.          This was “Awesome” did not change a thing!!!

I ended up using cheddar cheese on top instead of jack. Also, I seasoned the meat instead of the cream cheese mixture which I think helped give the meat a bit more flavor but dull the kick of the spices overall. I de-membraned and de-seeded the jalapenos to reduce the kick even a little further. Finally, in addition to the enchilada sauce, I added 4 oz. medium green salsa to the top under the cheese - this rounded out the flavor a bit. Use fresh baked tortillas to enhance the quality and serve with sour cream and guacamole and a side salad.

Awesome recipes, kudos Chef!

I used (slightly warmed) corn tortillas. 

I also brushed the chicken breast with a rub and grilled over charcoal fire for about 20 minutes.

My husband and I love this recipe.  I used bone in chicken instead of boneless so it’s moister, also, rotisserie chicken works good.  I also kept the seeds in the jalapeños and used 3 of them.  Did not find the dish too spicy at all.

Just finished these tonight. They were delicious. I used white corn tortillas instead of flour.  Only adjustments made were based on what I had on hand: (1) 10 oz. can of chicken, (2) out of onion so used onion powder instead, (3) used cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack.  Very tasty and filling. Will definitely make again.

Excellent.  Use all gluten free ingredients and this makes a great GF entree. I increased fresh japaleno peppers to add more zest and red GF sauce. Have made several times tweaking each time to get it right for our taste.

This is the first review I have left on here and it's because it's delicious!  We followed the recipe fairly close except for using a jar of green salsa verde instead of green enchilada sauce.  Definitely making this one again!

These were awesome!  Absolutely what I was craving... I call them "unchiladas" since we use the low carb flour tortillas (rather than the usual corn).  I made it easy on myself and bought a rotisserie chicken - made a double batch and froze some for microwave lunches.  Then used remaining chicken carcass and meat for chicken and dumplings.

This recipe is great. I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it. He said it could have been more spicy but i think it was perfect. I did one pan with the green enchilada sauce and one pan with the red enchilada sauce.

I’ve made this several times and agree to not add so much green sauce.The first I did according to recipe and the tortillas were soggy and gooey.  I also used fresh garlic but other than that this was a hit

I left out the cumin because my husband doesn't care for that spice but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  We had friends over for dinner and everyone loved this dish.  I will definitely make it again.

Exquisite!  I added fresh mushrooms, fresh spinach, and sliced ripe olives to the filling, and replaced  the chicken breasts with a rotisserie chicken,  it was terrific!  I’ll be making this recipe often.

I did and some of the sauce to the chicken mixture and just a bit of sour cream.  I used one of roasted chicken from the store and worked perfectly.  Easy and delicious.

Disclaimer  I DID mistakenly use red sauce but wonder if I still wouldn't like it because the flour tortillas are super soggy. The inner part however was really good before placing it on the tortilla .Maybe if I left them in longer in the oven  too?  I took them out at 25 min.

Made it on Sunday. Did the chicken the day before. Sautéed fresh garlic with the onion and jalapeños. Used 16 ounces of Mexican 5 blend cheese and onion/jalapeño cream cheese. Loved it and it’s a keeper. Will add fresh cilantro next time we make it

Pretty much cooked according to the recipe and got rave reviews from the fam.  I used all organic ingredients including the tortillas which are thinner and are less prone to becoming a gummy, chewy mess.  You can definitely increase the aromatic seasonings such as the cumin and chili powder given the volume of carbs within the recipe.  Was asked to save this recipe...a keeper.

The first time we had this I made it as written. It was very good but I didn't love the texture of the flour tortilla (although my husband didn't mind). Then we went low carb and removed the tortilla and replaced the green enchilada sauce with a lower carb green sauce to make a casserole. Still good. This last time I used corn tortillas (heated in vegetable oil) and it was dangerously good!

Good recipe!  I poured a "little" chicken broth into the chicken mixture before filling the tortillas.  Used a can of drained jalapeños as I didn't have fresh.  Easy, fast and usually have most of these ingredients on hand - no trip to the grocery store!!

Followed the base recipe but used green chilis in place of jalapeno and corn tortillas that I layered verses rolling individually so that it was more like a casserole.  Could only find 10 oz cans of green chili sauce so used 2 cans.  I also chose to cook the chicken in my instant pot with all the seasonings and some chicken broth to go quicker.

In no way me admitting that I change this recipe is stating that it needed changing, all I changed was corn tortillas instead of flour and I de-boned a roasted chicken instead of cooking 3 breast. Anytime I cook something and get up the next morning and think, I want that for breakfast!! It’s the bomb. I did use just a little more jack cheese than the recipe instructed, but other than those 3 thing flowed the original, I will definitely make this on a regular basis. Thank you for submitting

I didn’t use jalapeños, just onions & red& yellow peppers! Used the Monterey cheese plus pepper jack. One of our favorite dishes! Delicious

I have made these twice now, but couldn't find the green enchilada sauce so I used red both times and loved it.  I removed the seeds from the Jalapeños the first time, but it wasn't hot enough for me, so second time I left them in.

These are delicious and I will continue to make them over and over!

I simmered diced chicken in chicken stock with the spices till dry. Burned it slightly but it gave a charred,grilled taste to it. I used 3 jalapenos and the heat was right for us. The Hatch Enchilada sauce was a great recommendation from another reviewer. The filling kept well in the fridge and we assembled a fresh   dinner for 2  three times over the week instead of eating leftovers.

a bit too rich for my liking. I prefer a sour cream base over the cream cheese. although the flavor is quite nice. perhaps next time I'll make it with half & half.  I added sliced black olives to my recipe. lastly, I don't care for the sauce on the bottom of the pan... it makes the tortillas soggy. just spray the pan with a healthy amount of cooking spray & top the enchiladas with the sauce.

I sautéed the jalapeños separately so that I could create milder, medium, and spicier enchiladas. I loved the enchiladas as  the recipe  directed, but my daughter wanted milder enchiladas so I adjusted a small batch to meet her palate needs.

I made it as written except I used rotisserie chicken. Very good, but I'd like to try with corn tortillas next time. I thought the flour tortillas, with the amount of sauce called for, made them a little mushy/gummy. Really flavorful, and just the right spice from the jalapenos. My family really liked them. Definitely make again.

Yum! Made it as written except with the jalepeno seeds and membranes cuz we like spicy. My chicken breasts were pretty large, so only 1 1/2 were needed.  It's probably better to say about 1 lb, instead of 3 breasts.

I made this for my family last night. My husband doesn't like enchiladas but he ate 2 helpings of these. He said they're more like burritos, and he loved them. It's hard to satisfy a husband and 6 kids that are finicky eaters. This was a hit, and I'll definitely be making it again.

I made this recipe just as written.  My husband who is normally not crazy about Mexican loved it!  He even took it to work today for lunch.  The only change I would make is boiling the chicken over baking it.  Baking it dries it out some.  The flavor is wonderful.  Just the right amount of spices for a great little kick.  Due to a stomach issue I can't eat anything with red sauces.  So, I have a difficult time eating Mexican.  I've tried ordering chicken enchiladas and burritos with green sauce but they just have no flavor.  I was so pleasantly surprised with this dish.  And it made a huge amount. Used two large chicken breast that I got from the butcher. It does make just 7, but I used extra large tortillas  baked in a 10 x 14 baking dish.  It will definitely go into the monthly rotation.  Tweak to your liking and give it a try.

Tastes great! (Although enchilada’s are typically made with corn tortillas) These would be Enchuridos.

I Didn’t put cheese inside (I skipped a step), and they turned out great! I’m not a fan of cream cheese, at all (but my bestie/roomie is, so I thought, why not make something different for her?), or leftovers, and Even as leftovers they were DELICIOUS!! I only used 1.5 jalapeños (I added all of the seeds for heat!); I reheated the leftovers (three enchiladas) with foil over the baking dish, @ 350 for ten minutes; removed the foil, and returned to oven uncovered (also at 350) for 14 minutes.  Turned out great. Also, we topped our individual servings (both times) with sour cream. So yummy! Definitely making these again.

I doubled the recipe to make for a big family gathering. I made two changes: 1. Used an adobo spice mix that we really like instead of spices listed in the recipe ( the mix is pretty close to the recipe anyway) 2. quick grilled then smoked boneless chicken thighs. The enchiladas turned out amazing! I feel this would be a great base recipe to switch up or add filling items.

Loved the simplicity and delicious taste of this recipe. I did make a few changes though... Full disclosure: I didn't have green enchilada sauce on hand so had to use the homemade salsa I did have on hand; which I popped in the blender and liquified. I got creative and added refried beans (a family favourite) to each enchilada before rolling them up. Followed the rest of recipe as written but did boil the chicken breasts in the seasonings, as suggested by another reviewer, rather than baking them. Was quicker and made the chicken much more flavourful. There were no leftovers so making another batch... Not sure I'll bother to run out and get green enchilada sauce, though.

One of the few recipes in which a cook does not have to embellish.  This is a perfect stand-alone creation and a crowd pleaser for sure.  I did however,  top the enchies with small diced fresh tomatoes for color.  My honey loved that is is spicy without too much heat.  Very easy to prepare and not too expensive either.

The concept of the recipe is good but a couple of the Ingredients just didn't seem as they would benefit the recipe. 
Why would you use canned sauce when making homemade is so simply.. so that I changed and made my own sauce.
And, I never use flour tortillas, using flour tortillas makes this a wet burrito. I use a traditional corn tortilla. 
After the 2 simple changes in the recipe the dish was really easy and delicious!

Will definitely make this again. Made these for Cinco de Mayo.  They were everyone’s favorite!! Because many people are watching carbs, I used low carb tortillas and no one could tell. Thanks for sharing this recipes .  It is truly 5 STARS!

Yummy and filling!  Great for Cinco de Mayo today!   I used rotisserie as others did, added a few tablespoons of sour cream and fresh cilantro. Most definitely restaurant style... Ole!

Omg! I love this recipe! I’ve been cooking these enchiladas now for about a year and half. My husband works in the oil field and he has me cooking this for him and the guys at work at least once a month! It’s a lot of work but worth it! I also fry flautas with this same recipe and they are even better than the enchiladas!!!  Love it!!!!

great recipie, I added an extra jalapeno for top garnishing, if/when I make this again I'll probably add 2 more jalapenos to the interior and exterior for extra heat.  This recipie as is, is perfect for a light heat, it won't make your sinuses clear out (no tears, no runny nose) but I personally could handle more heat.  I did reheat my left overs in a pan the following day which worked well for them being only refrigerated.

Turned out pretty good. I sautéed the chicken with the seasonings instead of baking because of a time limit. I cut the cream cheese in half for personal preference. I added corn because it needed to be used and at least doubled the peppers and spies because we like it hot sometimes! I made some with black bean and the rest with chicken to accommodate everyone. Will definitely make again! Thank you for sharing

This dish was DELICIOUS- and I have tried a lot of enchilada recipes!! The only substitutions I made were to use a plain rotisserie chicken from the deli, corn tortillas instead of flour (had them on hand), lower fat cream cheese, and red enchilada sauce on one half, green on the other (I only had one 14 ounce can of green sauce at home and grocery store only had red sauce).  Loved the red/green combo by the way!  Will definetly be making often, thanks for sharing!

Alter the recipe however you want to add a wow factor. The recipe plain is all spice and little flavor. Also, i recommend using a lowfat cream cheese or mixing 4 oz cream cheese with 4 oz sour cream, otherwise it is way too rich

Really tasty recipe. I added a can of green chiles and more jalapeños. I also used corn tortillas rather than flour, because corn is more authentic and all around better.

I love this recipe! I substitute green peppers for the jalapeños though, since I'm not a fan of spicy food. I also substitute red enchilada sauce for the verde. Otherwise I follow the recipe. These are the only enchiladas I make!

This was fantastic!  I went exactly by the recipe except that I was out of cayenne pepper, so I used red pepper flakes instead.  My husband loved it, too.

This turned out sooo much better than I expected. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. Seasoned and pan fryer it. I also used white American cheese. Very creamy. Wife raved about it for hours. Thankfully there's enough for her lunch tomorrow.

Used about 13-14 ounces of leftover rotisserie chicken, so I skipped the first three steps, and saved a lot of time.  Proceeded to make 8 good-sized enchiladas as directed -- unfortunately my 7x11 pan could only hold 7 of them.  :-(  (I'll use a 9x13 pan next time.)  I really liked the appearance of the sliced jalapenos in the posted photo, so I went with that -- nice tang on the finished product!  Served with the Lime Cilantro Rice from AR recipe... so good!

I think this is a bit spicy for chicken enchiladas. I love HOT but I think of chicken enchiladas as flavorful but not as much heat. These are also a bit on the heavy side. I amm going to make them again soon but will go half on the cayenne pepper and will substitute half the cream cheese with sour cream.

these were suuuuuuper delicious! i added a bit of sour cream; a can of corn; green chiles; & red, yellow & orange bell pepper to the chicken/onions/jalapeño/cream cheese mix . . . they were so good! i used flour tortillas in one pan & yellow corn in another. i chopped onion & tomato for topping, as well as sour cream & black olives . . . all three picky boys absolutely loved them & went for seconds! these have been added to the list of things to make for dinner!

This was really good - I followed recipe, used both corn and flour tortillas (it's what I had on hand), added in a can of corn and a can of diced tomatoes with chiles.  Green enchilada sauce is a nice change from the usual red.  Good flavor without too much heat.

Delicious! I cannot wait to make this again.  I increased  the seasonings and used store-bought and pulled rotisserie chicken but other than that I followed the recipe.

My boyfriend and I made this tonight and it was pretty good. Next time we both agree we would  use two packs of cream cheese and less enchilda sauce. Two of the small cans (20 oz) would have been plenty. When I make jalepeno cream  cheese I use the chopped jar of jalepenos and add some of the juice as well as some heavy whipping cream to it. It makes it taste closer to Jose Peppers which is a Mexican restaurant where I always get it.

I used Costco rotisserie chicken breast.  I shredded the meat and worked the same ingredients that were listed into the chicken.  The amounts were just right.  I also used a Mexican cheese blend and doubled the amount.  The tortilla shells I used were Ole High Fiber Low Carb soft shells.  Other than these changes, I followed the recipe.    I have never taken the time to rate a recipe before BUT this recipe was so GOOD I had to share my opinion.

Pretty good but mine came out extremely spicy! I must have gotten some extra spicy jalapenos. My husband and I don't mind spicy but I know a lot of people wouldn't be able to handle it.

My wife and I basically devoured this.  We try to keep to one helping of most meals,  but we couldn't help ourselves.  I made a few basic changes to this.  First, I prefer to layer enchiladas instead of rolling them.  So much easier.  Just tortillas, chicken mixture, cheese, a little enchilada sauce, REPEAT.  Then in the last 5 minutes in the oven, top with some shredded cheese.  Also, I used Tex-Mex enchilada sauce instead of the green sauce.  That's just a personal preference thing.  I used two jalapeños out of my garden, but one might be enough.   I think I might try it with corn tortillas next time.

It was the first time I made enchiladas, but this recipe really knocked it out of the park. I'd use red enchilada sauce because I like it more, but that's just me. I could see it being killer with some lime and cilantro too!

These are awesome. I only had 1 can 15oz of the green enchiladas sauce so I improvised and mixed it with a can 10.5oz  of cream of mushroom soup, I also didn't have the 2 fresh jalapenos so I put in about 10 slices of the jarred variety chopped in with the onion. Left overs did not make it past lunch the next day. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the great recipe

Flavor is delicious. Very spicy as written.  I also thought they were a little dry. the addition of some milk or sour cream to thin the sauce would be a plus. Will make again as it has potential to be 5 stars.

Tasted great. I only had canned jalapenos and used a few tablespoons.  I couldn't bring myself to use a flour tortilla so I used 14 of the 5" corn tortillas. I also added a few ounces of green chilies. 28 oz. of the enchilada sauce made it slightly soupy but that's an easy fix.

I followed the recipe to a T, but was unimpressed with the  taste and constancy of the filling mixture.  I broke down and doctored it up into something similar to my own fav. recipe.  I added minced fresh garlic, and diced onion sauteed separately in light butter, another block of light cream cheese, about a cup of fat free milk, and some additional salt.  That cut the overly spicy mix down to consumable levels, like..  Not breathing fire levels.  It turned out Great...  After the changes...

This is absolutely delicious!!!  The only changes I made were...I added four heaping tablespoons of sour cream to the chicken mix and I also added the Jack cheese to the mixture instead of adding the shredded cheese to each one individually.  I swerved this with a salad and some sourdough French bread.  YUM!!!

I made this recipe with picante sauce instead of the enchilada sauce.  I used hot picante sauce which added nice heat to the recipe which my family likes. When I bake the chicken I use low sodium taco seasoning or my own taco seasoning and I cook the chicken a day or ahead to save time the day that I make this. Delicious and easy!!

Made it just like the recipe and loved it!  I wouldn't change a thing.  It was creamy and chicken was tender (I did grill the chicken).  I don't think you even need to out the Monteray Jack cheese in it!

OH MY GOSH ... these are so good!! Two of us polished them off in one sitting!  I have never made enchiladas before, but definitely will again. The only thing I did different was I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken I had bought and then didn't use for dinner the night before and I added a can of black beans to the mixture. We also had sour cream on the side.  Yummy!

These are definitely a labor-intensive undertaking (at least to a novice), but they are so worth it!  Pay attention to the size of the jalapenos that you use.  Any material increase in size between batches seem to make a huge difference in the heat level.  Those individuals that don't like hot foods should automatically cut back on the jalapenos. Maybe try one or one-and-half at first to see how it goes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Have been looking for a good enchilada recipe for quite some time.  I made half with flour tortillas and half with corn. I also made half with green enchilada sauce and half with red.  We couldn't decide which variation was the best. My husband said "Save this recipe."

This recipe was really good I absolutely loved it. I made no changes just didnt add jalapenos because I didnt have any and it still came out delicious.

Very good. Didn't make too many changes. Added a can of corn and can of chilies. Could use a little more jalapeno added to it.

This may be my all time favorite recipe found on All Recipes!  I've made it exactly as called for, I've added corn, I've added mushrooms, more peppers......there's no need to embellish the original recipe.  It's simple yumminess!!!! I love these enchiladas so much that I rarely make any side dishes other than a small salad!  Also, they are guest worthy!  I've handed over this recipe every time I've served it to friends or family! Serve up with a cold Corona....it's bliss!

So delicious! I used jalapeños instead of the chilies and sour cream and chive cream cheese with a thick and spicy read sauce (getting a think sauce is best because it is no watery and has more flavor) This was my second time using a cream cheese in enchiladas but my first time mixing all of the ingredients together in the skillet over the heat. I think this may have helped to intensify the flavor. I will be making these again and again!!!

Very good flavor. Only changes I made was that I cooked my chicken in the crockpot (best way to cook chicken for shredding) and I added a can of diced tomatoes with chillis to the onions and jalapenos.

Very tasty recipe!  My family loved it!  I skipped the first couple of steps and used ground chicken instead; sautéed the vegetables & then cooked the chicken with them.  I found the cream cheese & chicken filling to be cheesy enough, so I didn't add shredded cheese inside the enchiladas - just sprinkled on top.  And I used a homemade red sauce which was really good.  Best of all, this was easy to make ahead so I doubled the recipe and put half in the freezer for a quick & easy meal on a busy night.

I made mine first, then tried to find a recipe close to what I did, so I could save it for family.  This will do that really well.  Wonderful flavors.

Not as spicy as you would think. the cream cheese makes it so you don't even need sour cream on top. great crowd pleaser :)

My family loves this recipe!  We like our food good and spicy; these enchiladas are perfect!  When people with miler palettes are over for dinner I substitute the jalapenos for green chilies and lighten up on the Cayenne.  Still great!

This was amazing!  The only thing I changed was adding a little more cream cheese.  This is definitely a keeper.

These were epic!  I did make a couple of changes, but the flavor was just incredible.  I used boneless pork ribs, seasoned and browned, and then thrown in the crockpot until they were pull apart tender.  I used a small can of green chilis instead of jalapenos, and only had half an onion.  Finally, I added a can of corn.  AMAZING!  I really think that the only thing I can say is just ensure that you taste the filling before loading the tortillas because I found mine needed just a touch more salt, which made all of the spices, the chilis, the onions, corn and pork just pop out.  DELICIOUS!

i varied this recipe slightly by using taco sauce, and salsa, black beans and sour cream along with the cream cheese and jalapenos in the middle.  i also used pork as i was fresh out of chicken, but this was by far the best meal i've made (apparenlty anyways ha ha) They turned out fantastically... I would reccomend this recipe if you're able to alter it a bit with some more pizzaz and filling it will be even better.  it is spicy though... probably not for kids.
