This turned out pretty good and would pair nicely with almost any meat. The one thing I did not care for was the onions. I am a huge onion fan but they seemed to overpower the dish and the texture was off. I really think for them to work in this they need cooked longer than just to the softened stage. Next time I will cook them until they are dark and caramelized. That or I will just leave them out altogether and garnish with green onion tops.  Good universal side dish though and one worth making.
