even with the first review being a bad one, i still gave this one a shot. yes, it would have been bland and dry w/o one very important step that i added! after adding the rice, there was no liquid, which would have left this dry, so i topped it w/ spaghetti sauce...just like you would w/ actual stuffed peppers, and cheese. also, season, season, season the meat! i grated 3 garlic cloves over top along w/ cracked pepper and coarse salt. turned out great!

Fabulous!  I did make a few changes only because of what I had on hand.  No diced tomatoes, so I used a can of Rotel and 2 small cans of tomato juice.  Used 1/2 tsp salt due to dietary needs.  Used long grain rice, I never buy instant.  I also put everything into a casserole dish when done, covered with shredded cheddar, put it in the oven, covered, at 325 for about 20 minutes.  Will definitely make this again!

The meal was good, but I added a can of tomatoe sauce.  If I make it again I will also flavor the meat more.

This recipe turned out amazing. After I added a TON of seasoning- it was definitely bland without additions. I doubled the beef, added 4 t. minced garlic while cooking the meat, doubled the Italian seasoning, and added a 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. I used green, red, and yellow peppers for extra flavor. I then topped with mozzerella cheese and dumped everything in a 9X13 Pyrex and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes so everything was simmering, melted, and good!

Scrumptious! After draining the cooked beef I went ahead and cooked everything together (except rice) with the beef in the pot. I then added the rice last as in the instructions. My dish came out very moist. Quick and easy recipe. Thanks for sharing, Jan!

I make a similar dish to this, only I chop the onion, add a couple tablespoons of chopped garlic, and instead of the water I use a large can of Italian sauce plus a 12 oz. can of V-8. Much more moist and flavorful!

I made this recipe with nothing in mind for dinner. I was looking for something quick and easy. I didnt have any rice, but i did use red and green bell peppers and everything the same. For flavor, I added minced garlic and some vinegarette dressing. It turned out fabulous!! My family loved it.

This is a very good dish.  I add a little bit of taco seasoning to give it a little zing.  I also add shredded cheese...adds substance and flavor.  One of our favorites!

This was a very tasty dish! However, I took the advice of past reviews and spiced it up a bit. I put garlic, crushed red peppers and some more Italian seasoning. It does need a little bit more texture so next time I am going to add Italian sausage as well. Goes great with cornbread! My kids, ages 2 and 3, even liked it!

this recipe turned out pretty good. i didnt follow it exactly tho. no italian seasoning instead i used basil, creole seasoning, garlic & pepper, and crushed red pepper. also i chopped the onion cuz im not big on chewing a big piece of onion when i eat. it was a little too spicy for my daughter (then again she only 1) but overall it turned out good. will definately make it again!

I thought this was going to be bland after I saw the finished product, but it was quite tasty. And all my kids ate it with not one single complaint so I will make it again for sure! Tastes really good with a side of cornbread.

Wasn't really anything amazing. I used red peppers and some frozen potatoes instead of rice, but it wasn't very flavorful. Like another reviewer said, it made a lot, and now I don't know what to do with the rest. I even added 2 TB tomato paste to add flavor, along with a generous amount of garlic powder. Both helped, but I think I'd rather put in the extra effort to make traditional stuffed peppers.

This was just ok. Next time I will use less rice and more sauce. I found that the rice saturated most of the sauce and water since it was added uncooked. I am not sure I will make this again.

This recipe is EXCELLENT! It has good flavor, easy to make and is a super cheap meal even with the price of groceries these days. I think this meal cost me a total of $4.00 for a family of 4. You can't beat that. I'm not counting the cost of the rice because I already had that in my pantry and the meat I buy is cheap because I buy in bulk at Sams. This is perfect when you want stuffed bell peppers, but don't have the time nor do you want to spend 4.00 or more on just the bell peppers. The only changes I made were only added 1 tsp of salt. I might try it with a tsp of italian seasoning, but it was perfect for my 4 yr old who kept telling me how YUMMY it was. He even sat and ate it with a 102 fever which normally he just doesn't want to eat.

This had no flavor and isn't worth it despite how easy it is.  It made a ton and I didn't even save the leftovers.

Like the other reviewers if you follow the recipe it will be pretty bland. I left out the onion and used the powdered version, used frozen peppers (that was all I had) and added a TON of seasoning to it and it turned out great! Also I cooked the rice a different pot first in a mixture of homemade gravy and some water - it turned out awesome!

This didn't taste likt the stuffed peppers I'm used to at home, but it was still really really good.  My boyfriend and I made it together in a dorm kitchen so it is really easy to make.  We used a can garlic and onion flavored tomatoes and that really added that extra kick.  We will definatly make this again.  It was great.

This was good, I added slightly more of the italian seasoning and pepper. Not bad if you're craving stuffed peppers but don't have time to make them.

Yummy! Tastes like the real deal but much less hassle. Don't know why I didn't think of this on my own. I'm sure I added more seasoning than called for but I always do. Hubby liked that he could pick out the peppers and eat more filling.

I made long grain rice and added it to the mixture at the end. It worked well and gave the dish more flavor I think. Really easy and tasty even for a novice cook.

This was much easier than stuffed peppers and all of my children loved it.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned because that was what I had and added a little canned tomato sauce.  Definitely making it again!

Good for getting kids to eat stuffed peppers.
