I have done this for years, maybe even decades.  However, I always nuke them at home first and wrap them in foil.  At the campsite they heat up quickly.  Also, the cold potatoes can be unwrapped and cubed and pan fried with onions and peppers.

A fun way to cook potatoes over a campfire. OK, so we cooked them in our son's outdoor fire pit.  I used small potatoes and they turned out great.

These are great.  But you donâ€™t really need the foil.  Just  place similar size potatoes on hot grill and turn them  over and over   Until they are blackened.   Break open and enjoy with butter    Yummy

Love these potatoes!  I have made them several times and everyone raves about them.  To save time, I microwave them for 3 minutes, let them cool and then prepare.

Super good and very easy.  Lots of seasoning on the outside to spread on the middle of the potato when they were done.
