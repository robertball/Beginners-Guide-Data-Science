For another, different recipe, I had already started marinating or soaking chicken in Salt &Pepper, diced onion, crushed garlic, cilantro, green onions, and cayenne when I stumbled across this recipe.  I changed my plans and used this instead.  It was awesome. This needs ginger -- if you have fresh, better, but spice rack will do the trick.  Add a little red pepper too.   Quite honestly, the richness in flavor was just under the mark, but I think with a little more marinating/soaking, this would be a six star.  I found a peanut sauce recipe on the site (with fish sauce, chili oil, and vinegar), and it was great.  Everyone knew that we were having Satay when they walked in the house.  Served with basmati rice with a couple of peas/cilantro/ and green onion thrown in.  Muy bueno.  If I knew how to say "really good" in Thai, then you get the picture. As an update, strips of pork tenderloin work really well too, and they're low fat!

Being a vegetarian, I've never tried chicken satay before, but using meatless "chicken" strips, this recipe was a winner!  We were afraid that they might come out too spicy, but they weren't too hot at all.  In fact, if you like spicy food, I would definitely add more curry paste or red pepper flakes, because these only have a little zing.  Just right for us wimps out there!

You can customize this satay to meet your needs of spicy and sweet- I make double the recipe and add peanut butter as well as  Louisiana Supreme Chicken wing sauce for fire-hot tang. Reserve one half for marinating the meat ( I tenderize with a mallet to make sure the meat really soaks it up) and use the other half for dipping sauce. Grill til crispy .Serve with limes and cilantro on the side and you will have nothing but satisfied smiles.

I was looking for something to do with my leftover condensed milk. I was skeptical, but this came out perfect. I used vietnamese curry powder, because it was all I had.  Also, I didn't have skewers, so I just used a grill pan. Nevertheless it was tasty.

I wasn't going o try these because I don't like curry but I thought I would give them a try because my husband likes it.  I'm so glad that I did.  They were so yummy!!!  I did use normal curry instead of red becuase that's what I had on hand but they still turned out great.  This is one meal we make agian and again!!!

I wasn't sure my husband would like it because he doesn't like to try anything new. But I can only eat plain roasted chicken so many times! This recipe is really good. I used thighs.

very good- we really enjoyed this- and as usual tweaked it a bit- i didnt have condensed but had evaporated milk, had to substitute regular yellow powdered curry for red paste, and found peanut sauce , crunchy peanut butter and coconut milk in another version, and since i had them i added a fat tablespoon of jif crunchy- maybe a tablespoon or so of the coconut cream and thai peanut sauce, and last- a big clipping of some fresh chives we have in a planter on the patio- - i heated all that in a saucepan and drizzled over the chicken in a tupperware bowl and set it aside- then sauteed some crimini mushrooms in margarine, and pre boiled some mild italian sausage- and added those to the tupperware bowl, and last- a big fat green pepper cut into shish-ke bob size chunks-  
[did i say tweaked a little?} oh well, i always do that- it turned out superb!

We skipped the skewers and cooked straight on the grill.  Terrific little morsels that just had a hint of sweetness.  Be sure to include the sauce and honey.

This is really good! I thought it would be really sweet, but it's not.  I used garam marsala curry paste (doubled because it's not very hot). I also used 4 chicken breast halves.  Once I had them skewered (I think I had about 8 total) I heated up the rest of the sauce to baste on the skewers on the grill.  The taste was excellent.  Thanks for a great satay recipe that doesn't use coconut milk.

Too sweet for me so I added ground red pepper flakes and extra curry. My guests raved though and there was none left so I guess it was a hit!

I make this regularly, exactly as written! My son asks for it. I often double it and freeze a batch for a quick weeknight meal. It’s great with shrimp too.

I don't like spicy food so instead of the 1 tbs of curry, I used 1/2 tbs of garlic powder and 1/4 tbs of lemon pepper and 1/4 tbs of ground ginger.

I used coconut milk, since my family is lactose-intolerant.  Worked great, even the kids ate it!  Probably less sweet though than with the condensed milk.

I realize this isn't authentic Thai which may offend the negative reviewers, but the taste was great, I didn't change anything.  Also the ingredients are all pretty inexpensive and easy to get.  I made a Thai Peanut dipping sauce and also a cucumber salad to go with it.  We grilled them and they came out very tender and delicious!
