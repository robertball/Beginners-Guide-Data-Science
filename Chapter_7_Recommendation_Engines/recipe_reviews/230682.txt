I found this recipe because 1) I had all the ingredients on hand; and 2) it appeared to be pretty healthy and 3) quick and easy to make, and 4) it was a one dish meal.  So this recipe has a lot going for it.  It tasted good but we like lots of flavor and this was a little on the bland side for our taste.  I cooked the Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken Recipe (from this site) in a skillet and then sautÃ©ed the vegetables and quinoa in the same skillet to add some flavor. When I make it again, (and I will make it again) I will probably use blackened chicken to add more flavor.

Perfect with a salad. I used frozen vegetables and leftover rotisserie chicken.

I added more than double the chicken broth on accident and was worried. It turned out great and I will make it like that again.  My entire family loved it.

Made the recipe as-written with one small alteration. I had some bacon that I needed to cook or toss, so I diced and fried up a few slices and cooked the veggies with a smidge of leftover bacon grease rather than olive oil. I added the bacon at the same time as the cooked chicken. Healthy? Absolutely not, but the flavor was great. I think it would have been pretty bland otherwise.

Delicious healthy recipe! Changed the green pepper to a mix of red and yellow because I hate green pepper, and drizzled lemon juice on it at time of serving. Wonderful!

This recipe is bland, and,quite frankly, inedible. No one in my family could eat it.

Now on my favorite dish rotation. I added chopped kale and mushrooms and used half chicken stock and water. I made enough to last a few days and to add to salads.  it was Delicious, and I always add seasoning to dishes to add flavors.

This was good.  I served it over toasted whole wheat bread and had  cabbage salad as a side.  Also added red pepper flakes, curry, salt & pepper, oregano.  I forgot about adding lemon juice at the end. I think it would have been very bland without the added spices.

My husband and I loved this recipe--very healthy, too. I did add 1/2 tsp. of sweet curry with the spices and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice before serving. Delicious!

Made this recipe on a whim. The celery I had turned out to be bad, so I used celery salt instead. Also didn't have bell pepper, so I added a little sage to give it more of a savory/chickeny flavor, aaaaand only had half the parsley >.

I loved it.  I only had a 1/4 cup of quinoa so I waited till the end and added a 1/4 cup of couscous.  It came out great!

wonderful recipe! I made it a little different.  I cubed some chicken breasts and cooked them on the stove top with a dash of seasoned salt.  Instead of a bell pepper I used some fresh green chilis from the garden.  Then to give it a more chicken noodle soup flavor I added 1tsp each of oregano, basil and parsley and instead of chicken broth I used chicken bouillon. Loved it!!

This re recipe is fast and easy to make. It is just a little bland.  Definitively needs salt and pepper but something else. I will make it again and figure out another spice to give it a little burst of flavor.

This was quite good. I increased the amount of quinoa and added leeks to the veggies. Will definitely make again!
