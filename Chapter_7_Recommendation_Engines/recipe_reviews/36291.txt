This turned out delicious!  I didn't have cumin seeds so I used ground cumin instead. I cut down on the amount of garlic powder because I don't really like the taste of garlic powder and I used ground red chile powder instead of red pepper because it's available where I live.  I will definitely use this rub again, no question.

I tried this rub on my Christmas turkey last year and it was the best turkey the family said they ever had. I used it again this year for Thanksgiving and my husband asked if I could make it regularily instead of just at special occasions. Just rub it under the skin (use the whole amount) and cook as you normaly would.

Nobody in my household enjoyed this Rub on their steak. Actually, they told me that I ruined a good steak.

We made this a long time ago with some un-flattering cut of steak and didn't care for it.  But recently we made it with flat iron steak.  Awesome.

This was excellent! I used 1 tsp. ground cumin instead of the seeds (because I didn't have them). Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I broiled the steaks and they smelled great cooking! My boyfriend, who can be picky, was amazed with the taste! This is definitely a keeper! Thank you!

delicious, mouth watering rub! i used ground cumin to be faster, and garlic salt in place of garlic powder and salt. turned out fabulously! be warned--it might incline you to eat more steak than you normally would!

Excellent rub when used on spareribs.  Our family multiplies the recipe in order to generously cover the spareribs before they hit the grill.  Nice alternative to bbq sauce.

I also used ground cumin but left everything else the same and it was excellent!  My husband and I both enjoyed it as well as my 3 & 5 year old children.  I was expecting some wrinkled up noses from the kids but not a one!!  :o)  I will be usinig this rub again.

This was by far the best rub/marinate for steaks my family has seen or tasted. Better for steaks than all other rub's and marinates. Used "Ranchers Reserve Steaks" from Safeway because the are so good and cheaper than a butcher. Great rub, Thanks a lot.

I'm giving this one three stars, because while it did not destroy the steak....I don't think it really enhanced it.  Hubby said that the cinnamon really kinda grossed him...I thought it was okay but not great.

I used this to bake some pork chops and it was fabulous!  Next time I'll try it to sautee some vegetables for a side.
