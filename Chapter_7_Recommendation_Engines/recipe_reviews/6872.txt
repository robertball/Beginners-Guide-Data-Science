My family & I love this recipe!!!!! What I do with the bread is: I put it in the bread machine(the ingredients in order), let it mix into dough. When it's done w/that stage & going on to rise, I stop it, take the dough out & put it into a greased loaf pan & let it rise for about an hour. After rising, I put the loaf into a 325-350 degree oven & let it bake until it's done(about med. brown). It comes out perfect & tastes delicious!!!!!

I doubled the recipe as it is printed.  I mixed the dough in our "Kitchen Aid" mixer with the dough hook rather than the bread machine.  I added 3 tbsp of wheat gluten, 1/2 cup of 12 grain cereal, and 1/2 cup of bulgher wheat. (Be careful to maintain the correct moisture balance) I let it rise in the mixing bowl for an hour, kneaded it back down and split it into two even loaves.  Let it rise in the bread pans for another 40 minutes and then baked at 325 for 35 minutes. This produced about the best whole wheat bread we have ever had.  Very flavourful with a definite crunch and great texture.

I couldn't resist but to experiment (over time) with this recipe.  
.75 c water
1 egg
1c wheat flour
1.5c white flour
6 tablespoons honey
1c nuts

I was getting dry crumbly bread using fresh flour, reducing the water and adding the egg helps.  You might add 1/8c of flour depending on the consistancy of the dough on the 2nd kneeding.

I loved the Honey taste in this
bread, it was GREAT!
It didint make a tall loaf and was alittle
heavy but was a pleasure to eat it!

This is a great quick and easy bread, not to mention delicious!  Great toasted or just as a sandwich.  Nothing makes a better smell in the kitchen.

Very easy to make, everyone loved it!  The only thing is that it sank in the middle.  I used less yeast as another reviewer recommended, but it still sank.  Still delicious and smelled great while baking!

The only thing I like about this bread is that there is no added sugar. This bread came out very dry and dense and way too done on the outside. I agree with another reviewer that I just don't think this bread works in all bread machines. Mine is a Sunbeam. I will stick with my other bread recipes.

Like some other reviewers my loaf sank terribly in the middle.  My edges were also a bit too done.  The taste is great.  My conclusion after following this recipe exactly is that it must work in some bread machines and not work in others.  I have a Black and Decker and it does not work well in there :(  Give it a try but don't get your hopes up!

just a suggestion, don't use your bread maker to bake this bread, just use it for the dough setting, let the dough rise and then bake it 350 for 30 minutes, that's the best way to make this bread, it does not work in a bread maker cooking it completely thru the cycle, I have made this bread a dozen times, comes out perfect when only going as far as dough in your breadmaker. We love it, its a great experimental bread recipe too.

Would not make this again.  It was sunken on the top, it was hard, dry and not very flavorful.  I have made MANY bread machine breads and I think this was one of the worst.

I love this bread.  I followed the recipe precisely, but like another reviewer I used the machine only for the dough function.  I then punched down the dough and placed it in a lightly greased/floured bread loaf pan to let it rise again.  Then I baked it at 330F for about 25 min or until it looked right.  Perfect results.  No falling in the middle.

I tried this recipe as  small rolls rather than a loaf. I let the bread machine do all the mixing and kneading and after the dough had risen I turned it out on a floured surface and used the top of a small glass to cut out small rolls. I baked them in the oven for an eyeballed 13 minutes at around 385. My family really enjoyed them. Soft and tasty.

This bread was easy to make and rose nicely. It would be a good choice for folks looking to work themselves off of white bread. It has a subtle sweetness to it too.

This recipe was really pretty easy.  I set my machine on "dough" and made two 8X4 loaves with it, and varied the wheat and bread flour ratio.  My whole family loved it, I will definitely make it again.

I had the same problem as the others... my loaf caved in. I don't know if it was from too much yeast or not. I used the delayed setting to bake it, and it rose so high that it stuck to the top of the breadmaker, and then sunk way down low. Although it's not pretty, the bread still tastes good!

Made exactly as described and with good results. Very enjoyable. I think when I make it again I'll either use more honey or substitute molasses instead for a little stronger flavor. Really good.

This bread was quite good. Great texture and moist. I made the recipe as written. Although since I live at high alt. I did use vital wheat gluten, which might have added to the airy texture!

This came out great.  I did proof the yeast in a cup of warm water.  I added an extra 1/4 cup bread flour and a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.  I also substituted buttermilk powder for milk powder.  No falling in the middle for this loaf!

Delicious.  Flavor has a "comfort factor" and is a a great recipe to use in a pinch because the ingredients are usually in the pantry. Adds that homemade touch to a quick meal.

I think this recipe is great!!! My family loves it - I disagree with the other reviews - measure perfect and the bread comes out great - love the idea of whole wheat and bread flour - never use white - I use butter instead of margarine, though

When trying this recipe in the bread machine, the loaf fell to half its potential size! This recipe contains too much yeast and water as compared to a number of other honey wheat recipes.

Delicious bread recipe. My first loaf was flat on the top like others have said too. So I swapped a couple of things, used 1cup milk instead of water and dry milk powder.  Added one egg, 1/2 cup more flour, and used 2tsp. yeast. These changes turned out better, no falling on the top and over all bread texture was better.

This was a bit dry and the crust was a bit too crunchy.  It needs more moisture.  It has good flavor, but needs some tweaking to make it more moist.

After checking the internet on what to substitute dried milk with for bread machine recipes, I used milk in place of the water and dried milk.  I ended up having to add a few extra tablespoons of flour.  Bread was decent enough - maybe I just don't have perfect luck with bread machines!

This bread turned out great! Made sure to read the reviews of everyone who said extra honey made a difference.. glad I added it! I think other people's bread fell because it doesn't say to use bread yeast. I used bread yeast and bread flour and mine puffed up beautifully! I also added 4 tablespoons of honey instead of 2 and the bread is perfect! We love it and will be making this again for sure!

Loved this recipe BUT...
Had to reduce the yeast to 1 1/2 tsp-otherwise my bread rises way way too high and falls in the middle (I do live in Utah so that could make a bit of a difference).  I did two heaping Tbs of honey because we like our honey wheat bread to be sweet.  Also I don't use bread flour-I use unbleached all-purpose and it turns out great.

Very good bread. I doubled the recipe and made in my kitchen center. Added 3 tbsp. gluten and 4 tbsp. ground flaxseed to the doubled amounts. It made 2 nice large hand shaped loaves. I put 2 cups water directly on bottom of oven during baking.

I didn't have enough bread flour on hand to follow the recipe exactly, so I used 1 c bread flour and 1.5 c whole wheat flour.  Instead of a pkg of yeast, I used 2.5 tsp.  It was yummy and looked beautiful!!!!  Next time, I'm going to experiment with a little bit more honey, as we liked the hint of sweetness in the bread and wanted a little more if it.

This is good, and it can be made with one cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups white flour and is still good-- you don't have to use the whole wheat setting on the machine.  I tried this with King Arthur's white wheat.

1/2 times for two loaves. I stayed with the high gluten as standard flour is running too short (no strength -too crumbly - won’t develop). The dough felt much better. I use very old methods from old handcraft bakers. Also, I used 1/3 honey, molasses for color and sugar.

I made this recipe and me and my 12 year old boys loved it!! I don't have a bread machine and knead and baked it the old fashioned way.  I substituted bread flour for unbleached flour and honey for maple syrup and I also didn't use any milk as my son is lactose intolerant. I also baked it at 335 degrees in my oven and the crust came out crispy and delicious.  I couldn't keep my boys from buttering it and eating. I made 2 loaves in one week. It's now my go to bread recipe!

Measured precisely, yielded a 2 inch high loaf, great taste, not too wheaty tasting, baked in bread machine.  Ratios must be off to yield a "hockey puck."

Followed the recipe exactly and now have a soft, fluffy loaf of bread.  I will make this again.  Other than a little dough sticking to the top of my bread machine, I had no problems with the recipe.

Love it! So easy and just as great as store-bought bread, just fresher! :) The way I do it, it only takes 1 1/2 hrs. I use the manual/knead and rise only setting on my Welbilt bread maker and then pop it in the oven for about 30 min on 350. This way I can monitor/adjust how dark it gets and have it in that nice bread pan shape. :) [I just set a timer to end 15 min before the manual setting will complete and preheat my oven/toaster oven at that time.]

Made this in my Panasonic bread maker. I added total of 2 tsp of bread machine yeast and used bread flour. Set it on rapid bake and it came out perfect. This recipe has a great flavor, lighter than whole wheat but with a nice texture and crispy crust. Slathered it with margarine just out of the  oven to soften the crust. Nice bread machine recipe and really like my Panasonic. It has not failed me yet.

This is the first loaf of wheat bread I've made in my bread machine and it set up very nicely. I used milk and changed the amount of water accordingly. The crust was delicious! Will make this again.

Tdxw1his bread is super tasty. I did a few modifications though. I used 3/4 cup splenda sugar instead of honey plus 1/2tsp of sugar. Still came out great, but with less calories!

While this bread turned out ok, it didn't have much of a taste, other than a regular bread taste.  The crust was too crunch.  However, overall this is not a bad recipe at all.

Great recipe, and extremely easy.  I loved it, because I had everything in the cupboard!!  I used my dough hook on my KitchenAid Mixer, let it rise for about an hour, kneeded it with the dough hook (of course), and put it in a greased and floured bread pan.  I let it raise in there for probably an hour and half.  I cooked it at 325 for about 32 minutes.  Perfect, easy easy easy, and it tastes great!  Next time I'm going to add more wheat flour and less bread flour though.

This bread was a disappointment. I made it twice and both times it came out dry and flavorless despite tweaking. I probably won't make it again.

I was shocked by the amt of water and yeast in this recipe but decided to try it anyway. The dough was so wet and gloppy I added 1/4c additional flour. Despite that, the loaf caved in. I won't be making this one any time soon.

Nice taste.  I used butter instead of margarine.  I used 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I also added 1/2 tsp of yeast because I thought mine was old, but it turned out not to be old, because it rose and then fell.  So next time I plan to use the normal amount of yeast, sub the butter for marg. again, and a higher ratio of whole wheat.
