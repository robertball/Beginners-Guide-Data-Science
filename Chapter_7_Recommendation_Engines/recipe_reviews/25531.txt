We make these all the time at holidays or when the choice arises.  I do not use the ground beef just Jimmy Dean Sage sausage.

I use a spicy mustard instead of worcestershire and ketchup and the hot and zesty roll of sausage.  There is no need to microwave the cheese and dirty a bowl.  Drain the grease from the meat, put it back in your skillet, add the cubed cheese and cook until melted.

I made these party pizzas for a party I was catering..........I made enough for 50 people, and I still ran out early!  These were the hit of the party, and they travel well!  Make the topping ahead of time, then assemble and bake at the party.  I kept them warm in a chafing dish. Way to go!

A dear departed friend gave me this recipe years ago.  She added a handful of oregano.  She also gave me the tip that these freeze very well.  Just put them together on the party rye, freeze on the cookie sheets, and when you're ready to eat them, just toss a few on a baking sheet and bake at 400 until browned on top.

Good, although I only used an 8 oz. loaf of rye bread and that worked perfectly.  8 oz is equal to one loaf at my local store, not 1 lb. as the recipe suggests.  My husband said he would have like this better with some pizza sauce on the bread, although that is no the traditional pizza rye that I know.  Also, a friend of mine told me she hads a little mozzarella and oregano to the topping.

These were a big hit at a small family Christmas gathering I hosted.  Everyone was familiar with them, had many names for them, but all had the same opinion - that they are delicious!  This is an easy recipe that is sure to please!

Great recipe, very easy! I had these years ago and was so glad to come across the recipe because I didn't know what they were called.  I accidentally forgot the ketchup but it was still really good! Everyone at the party loved them.  Thanks again!

Quite good as party finger food. Nothing fantastic, but tasty, easy, and unassuming yet unique. Three stars, however, because processed cheese spread is a horrid thing to recommend in any situation. I used sliced provolone for half of the "pizzas," and smoked gouda for the other half. Next time I'll swap the catsup (I used homemade) and Worcestershire for Sriracha and some other red sauce as well.

Great party/holiday appetizer. Try adding some sliced green onions to the meat/cheese mixture while cooking. These also freeze well and reheat good in the oven at 350 for about 10-15 min.

Delicious- I like to use spicy sausage to give it a kick and no ground beef just sausage. We have also tried it with Rotel in the cheese for an added kick!

These are pretty good.  I'm not a big rye bread fan, so I didn't give it a perfect score.

These were really good! I don't like sausage at all, so I just doubled the ground beef, and I added some extra seasonings to make up for it--red pepper flakes, garlic salt, onion powder, whatever I had handy that seemed like it might be good.

I make these all the time, just a suggestion you can make ahead of time just freeze before baking and then you can place in a ziploc baggie....take out what you need and put under the broiler for about 5mins perfect and a real crowd pleaser !!

My husband's family has been making these for years, it's a staple at the annual Christmas buffet and are loved by all. Today is the NFL playoff games - Go Falcons! Rise up! - so he asked me to make them. I used a pound of ground Italian sausage instead of pork sausage for added flavor and I omitted the hetchup. Like other reviewers, I didn't melt the Velveeta in the microwave, I just cubed it and melted it in the skillet with the browned meat. Easy peasy! My sister in law says they freeze wonderfully but I wouldn't know - they all get eaten at my house!

Not sure what the hype is on these. Made exactly by the recipe. I had doubts when I was buying the velveeta, I should have trusted my instincts. I do not recommend this recipe. Extremely bland, processed cheese and meat on rye.

Very easy to make and an instant hit! I bought ground beef and ground pork and seasoned the meat with season salt, garlic pepper, and added pepper flacks to give it a bit of heat.

I did not add the ketchup but I did add 1 teaspoon of garlic salt. These always go over well at parties and at home for a heavy mid-afternoon  snack if we’re going out later in the evening.

I don't use ground beef either, I use hot sausage. I also add a couple tablespoons of oregano before scooping it onto the bread (which I prefer pumpernickel). Great fall snack!

I made this recipe with French bread instead of the party rye bread slices. My BF prefers the taste of French bread more. If you like French bread more, it's a great idea! Just slice the loaf or loafs similar thickness to the rye bread and it cooks wonderfully! Very good

I made this tonight with just ground beef and it was still good. I  personally don't like sausage so I just left it out. It does need a bit of seasoning if you don't use the sausage though or it's a bit bland. I used American cheese instead of the cheese food because it's all I had on had on hand. I simplified the recipe a bit by browning the meat and letting the cheese melt in the same pan and then putting it on top of toasted white bread.

These are a hit with my family. We don't always add the ketchup, and add a tablespoon or so of oregano for some extra flavor. I agree with other reviewers that there is no need to melt the cheese in a separate bowl, just add to the meat in the pan.
