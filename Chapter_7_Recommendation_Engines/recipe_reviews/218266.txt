BEST BURGER I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME!!! Perfect combination to use up some Gouda Cheese. My husband was skeptical at first but later admitted that, "Gouda is Good!!!" Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe mommyluvs2cook and I'm looking forward to make these over and over again.

I give this a 4 for flavor (we like things strongly flavored) but a 5 for the idea. I think it's fun to serve a burger like this. I skipped the breadcrumbs and egg, and just used garlic powder instead of fresh - very easy to just sprinkle on and I don't like to mix up my meat much so I get a better burger texture. I think I'll try this with a stronger flavored cheese, like a sharp cheddar or blue cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum. This is a big sloppy, messy burger and it was delicious. I made it into single patties and used the gouda mixture as a topping and left it open faced. Then cut it in half for one serving. I used half Johnsonville italian sausage with half the ground beef and that really took it over the top.
