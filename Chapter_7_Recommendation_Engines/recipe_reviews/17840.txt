I had to double the cheese for the cheese sauce, double the mushrooms and double the onions. It was otherwise too eggy and the cheese sauce too starchy. But with those adjustments, I've had several people request a copy of the recipe. Plus, for a smaller group, we just cut the recipe in half (still doubling ingredients above) and used a 8x8" pyrex. That came out great, too.

This was great, I made it in the morning and did not chill, I did not see any point as I was going to cook immediately.
DELICIOUS!!YUM YUM
Suggest one could add diced cooked potatoes for a bigger crowd and/ or as a dinner dish with a great side salad.

once i baked this recipe a layer of oil gathered at the top and corners...(despite the fact that i reduced the margarine in areas)
also the refridgerating time is a blessing and an annoyance..
this recipe may be nice with cheese sprinkled on the top before its baked rather than the cheese sauce

Those who complained about the sauce being too starchy probably didn't cook their roux long enough. If you don't cook the butter and flour for at least two minutes, you will get a starchy taste. Otherwise, it becomes very nutty. Properly prepared, this casserole is great.

This is a recipe definitely best prepared the night before.  I winged it and tried to do it when I first woke up.  It has a few steps too many for that.  BUT, the flavor was terrific, especially the cheese sauce with the onions.  It was like a giant baked omelet, and my entire family gave it RAVE reviews.  Thanks for sharing this one, Danielle!  It was terrific!

Both the egg haters and egg lovers who ate this casserole loved it! I sprinkled a couple tablespoons of buttered bread crumbs over the top before baking. I will be making this again.

I followed the directions word for word.  I used Country Crock instead of butter.  My husband said it was "spongy," and my daughter said it tasted "starchy."  She thinks it was the sauce.  I thought it was okay, but it was not a hit w/my family.

Our family is divided on this recipe. I too thought it was starchy...the cheese sauce didn't do it for me at all.  It would be easier and less time consuming to scramble eggs, mushrooms, ham and add cheese. I sprinkled my portion with cilantro...that helped a bit.

Tasty, but not so quick. Plan ahead if you want to make this. It does require chilling prior to baking. The texture of the finished eggs was a little softer than I like, but the taste was good. Green or red pepper would work well in this dish.

Maybe I tried to manipulate the recipe too much.  I threw in some chopped spinach, but didn't increase the amount of cheese sauce.  When all was said and done, nobody noticed the cheese sauce at all, because it just seemed like runny egg.  I could have just scrambled all the ingredients together, omitted the cheese sauce, melted some cheese on top, and saved myself some work.

Really rich. It actually makes a great filling for tortillas.  Seriously can just add a bit of cheese to the top instead of the cheese sauce.

Nobody needs a recipe for scrambled eggs with a couple ingredients.  Also, nobody cares what you did to "change up" this recipe to suit your tastes because it's frikking scrambled eggs with ham and mushrooms (and onions... ?).  You can always refrigerate this after you make it so its surprising that it would surprise anyone about "making it ahead of time". People serve this to guests? Go get a recipe book people!

I made this for fishing camp. This was excellent except there wasnt any left for the cook after the guys got through with it.  Note to self.  Save some.  I, too,  put buttered bread crumbs on it to give it a nice finish.  To Tammy who doesnt see the point in refrigerating overnight; it allows the flavor profile to develop.  Think of it like fine wines that get better over time.  The same is true for some ingredients when you cook.  The flavors of mushrooms, onions, eggs, and the seasoning meld together as they sit so when you cook them after they have had that chance to sit, the flavor becomes more intense.  Trust the recipe, there is a point!  Enjoy!

I love eggs recipes for dinner and this was fantastic! It was moist and tasty without any other changes except the two made out of necessity. I cut the recipe in half since I'm cooking for one and baked it in an 8x8 dish. The only other change I made was using a can of Georgio portobello mushrooms since I didn't have fresh.

It was good, but please change the prep time to include the 30 minutes of cooling in the prep time.

Have been making this for about 40 years.  Have the family over for Christmas brunch and make it the night before. I always double the cheese as everyone is a cheese lover. I usually put buttered bread crumbs or crushed cornflakes on top, as that is how my original recipe called for. 
Making tonight for breakfast after sunrise services tomorrow.  Just be careful and get the roux cooked.

Made this for Thanksgiving brunch everyone really enjoyed it. Thought it was very tasty.
I made half of the dish exactly as the recipe stated in order to be able to rate it properly and the other half I added marble cheddar cheese on top as my kids are cheese fanatics. 
My only criticism would be that I found a bit runny so I would suggest to perhaps cook the mushrooms before putting in egg mixture. Overall was happy that I could make this the day before.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written, wouldn't change a thing.  Very flavorful and the perfect combination of ingredients.  The cheese mixture that goes over the top was a hit, giving the dish a new meaning to eggs.  We had way to much left over so we put it in the fridge and warmed it up through the week for a quick delicious breakfast before work,  it was still fantastic, needless to say we will be making this many more times.

This had very good flavor. I added a little extra cheese just to use it up and because I like cheese. Next time though if I do that  I will just throw it on top. I think I would have like the top to be a little crispier. My fault not the recipes. Thanks for the recipe.

Family absolutely loved it. Just enough seasoning. Wouldn't change a thing.
