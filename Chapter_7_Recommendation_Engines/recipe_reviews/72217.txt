If you're not a HUGE bleu cheese lover, you might just think these are ok, but they're a must for bleu cheese enthusiasts!  

The first log I made was per this recipe.  They were good, but I tweeked it by adding 1/4 tsp garlic powder, let the log chill overnight, sliced them then gave each cracker a dash of hot sauce before baking.  They were delish!!  While serving them to friends, some topped it with a grilled shrimp, great combination!!

These were a major hit!  I used a little more bleu cheese, a little less butter, and almonds instead of walnuts.  They had to bake a longer, about 15 minutes.  The taste was exceptional - nutty and delicious.  We topped ours with a dollop of homemade hot pepper jelly.

Be sure the dough is very chilled before slicing.  TIP:  Use waxed dental floss to slice intead of a knife.

I only gave it three stars because not everyone favors bleu cheese.  If you like it, you'll like these.  I tasted the dough and thought it needed a little kick, so replaced the salt with 1/2 teaspoon garlic parsley salt and a few twists on the crushed red pepper grinder.  Then I sprinkled the cracker tops with just a touch of sea salt and popped them in the oven.  I guess know your audience because I came home from my party with an empty plate, I think they licked it for crumbs!  Btw, slicing was aided by using a sharp knife and dipping in warm water between every few slices. (;  These would also be good sprinkled with dill or savory or any spice you love with your bleu cheese.

I made this recipe and found that these wafers were fairly tasteless and very brittle.  I like blue cheese but I really did not like this recipe.  They weren't bad with some tuna mixed with spicy brown mustard and some mayonnaise but they didn't add too much flavor.  I will not be making these again.

Not a bad recipe, just average in my book.  The wafers came out a bit dry for my taste.  Took them to a party and they were barely touched.  Probably would not make again.

I made a couple of add-ons to the recipe. We love blue cheese and we loved these crackers.  I bundled them in family Christmas parcels with a blackberry pepper jelly. 
I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. hot chili flakes and a dash of worcestershire sauce to the dough. Also, I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans.  I cooked them longer (20 minutes) and flipped them half way through to add some crispiness...absolutely will make these again

For me these are OK at best...I did love the texture!  They have a shortbread texture which I loved but unfortunately they weren't as flavorful as I had hoped :( I'm going to definitely try these again with a few tweaks I'm going to add more bleu cheese more salt and some other seasoning...not horrible just not what I expected flavor wise..
