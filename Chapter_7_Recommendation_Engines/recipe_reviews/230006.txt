I made this without the pudding mix since I didn't have any on hand. I also used chocolate extract (in place of the vanilla) and cut back on the amount of chocolate chips, the results were great! I will make these again.

I used regular instant CHEESECAKE pudding, pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon and instead of chocolate chips, I used Hershey's cinnamon chips. Because I didn't want to dirty two muffin tins, I really loaded my muffin cups up to the brim. Even though they were full, they baked up beautifully without overflowing. Baked at 350*, these were done at 25 minutes. I did have to cover them halfway with foil so they did not burn on top. Thumbs up from my family--they had eight of them gone at breakfast and I think they will have the rest gone by this afternoon.

Wonderful! I just got engaged so I'm trying to make healthier snacks and sweets to prepare for wedding dress shopping. I had pudding mix loose in a container so I just used a tablespoon since several people said it was fine without. I didn't have chocolate chips so I cut up some chocolate bars. I didn't use the full amount of chocolate and I think these would be delicious with or without them. I made them as mini-muffins and they took about 12-14 minutes in my oven. I also made some with liners and some without. Make them! They're awesome!

This is my go-to recipe for pumpkin muffins. They are my favorite.Hard to believe they are low fat.I never use the pudding mix and they come out fine. I sprinkle the chips well inside the liner to prevent smearing the chocolate chips when removing the muffins.

I love this recipe and so do the kids! I add flax seed to give it an extra nutritional boost and no one knows the difference!

We used half wheat and half white flour, 3/4 C applesauce, no oil, and half a small package of regular vanilla pudding. So so yummy. going in the recipe box. Also for the first time I used a real pumpkin left over from Halloween. I was a little hesitant because it seemed stringy, but was a hit with these muffins.

I just made these this morning.    The flavor is good and they produce a dense and yummy muffin.   I forgot to spray the papers... that was a mistake.  Oh well.. Muffin Paper!

Loved this recipe so much.  The pumpkin base was not over-powering and worked really well with the chocolate chips.  The muffins were a bit dense but still really tasty.  I especially like that the recipe was created with the health of the consumer in mind.  Too often something tasty is bad for you, but this is both healthy and so yummy.  I will definately be making these again.

I made these again, but didn't have pudding mix. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of oil, but otherwise made the recipe as written. Very tasty!

A keeper for sure! Soft, fluffy, not too sweet (even though vanilla pudding powder was omitted as I could find it in the supermarket ). Stirred in some walnut and it taste delicious!

Muffins were okay - Next time I'll add more spices. Definitely needed nutmeg or cloves, as they were kind of bland.

Funny how a batch of muffins can make mom a early morning hero! These were easy to assemble and quite tasty. I omitted the pudding mix like many others and we had light, fluffy muffins. Next time I might decrease the chocolate chips a bit. This was thoroughly enjoyed by the whole family.

I made these muffins exactly as stated, and the result was a little disappointing. They were very dense and moist, so if that's what you are going for, you may love these.  I on the other hand was looking for a light and fluffy muffin textured pumpkin treat, so in my case I did not get the results I had hoped for. Also, due to their very dense and batter-like finished texture, I had to bake for an additional 10 minutes! Just for the toothpick to come out clean!

Can't believe I made fluffy healthy muffins. I did not add the pudding mix simply cos I don't have any on hand. I also substitute the sugar with honey and they still turn out wonderful!!  Ty, Brinna for sharing..definitely gonna do this again. Everyone should really try this recipe.. So easy and oh sooo good! Just remember to spray yr muffin cups ;)

These were quite tasty even though I had to adjust the recipe a little due to not having the instant pudding on hand.  Even without the pudding mix, they weren't too heavy and the applesauce really adds a good flavor and helps keep them moist.  Making them was a great way to use the last of the pumpkin puree I had left over from my holiday baking.

Dense,creamy muffins. Good flavor although if I make them again I might add more chocolate chips to the muffins. They baked exactly how they are scooped in with very little rising fill the muffin tins right up
