A whole 7oz. can of chipotle peppers would blow my flip flops right off, so I only chopped up two peppers (and we like heat). I'm not sure about the whole bunch of cilantro either, My bunch is pretty big. I just chopped a good handful up. I've learned when you add a lot of extra ingredient into a burger it will fall apart on the grill. The way to avoid this it to put your patties in the freezer on wax paper for at least a couple hours before grilling. They aren't frozen but solid enough to not crumble when cooking. Works every time for us. I got lazy and just put the slices of the salsa ingredients on top, squirted the fresh lime on it and topped with more of the cilantro. Worked great and didn't fall all over the place when eating. This is really a great burger, so much so my son asked to have these again for his birthday dinner BBQ. Five stars if you reduce the amount of peppers... Update, I've made this burger with ground turkey twice now and the mushrooms give it such a moist good flavor. I still haven't had any trouble with them falling apart on the grill.

BEST BURGERS EVER!  From now on this is the only way burgers are made in my house.  The time estimate for the prep is WAY off.  De-seeding and chopping a can of chipotle is very time consuming.  Every can of adobo chipotle peppers varies and you never know what you are going to get heat wise, so unless you like it really, really hot, I would advise using 1/2 a can/pound beef and playing it safe.

We LOVED the avocado salsa made exactly as recipe specified!  The burgers were awesome...the mushrooms kept them so moist. However, though we love spicy, we dediced to use just two of the chipotle peppers and some of the sauce for 1 lb of hamburger and they had the perfect amount of heat for us.  Great recipe!!

SPICY!  This is for the 'heat' lovers in the family, that is for sure!  I blended the chipotle peppers and sauce in the food processor and added to 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef instead of 1 pound.  Knowing that the burgers would be hot I did NOT add the jalapeno to the salsa.  A slice of Jack cheese would balance the heat well.  These burgers were a little wet and didn't hold together well on the grill.

My husband and I have been making chipotle burgers for years now our boys love them. We mix in 1/3 ground pork, it makes them very moist and we dont use a whole can. we chop the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and use about half a can of the mixture or 1/2 cup for a total of 5lbs of meat. we make 1/2 pound burgers out of the mixture(we like em big), we grate an onion with a box grater this helps the onion mix in to the meat well. we don't use cilantro or mushrooms but we do add eggs and italien bread crumbs...you have to play with it for your own family to get it just right. They freeze great if you place parchment(cut into burger size squares) between each 1/2 lb patty them wrap in plastic wrap and place in a zipper freezer bag.

Taste wise this is great. The avocado salsa compliments the burger very much and we enjoy the heat from both the salsa and the chipotle peppers in the burger. BUT, what's the deal with the patty not sticking together?? Should there be an egg in there? Also, like every other reviewers, I only used about half a can of the chipotle peppers. I thought the whole can might be too much for 1 lb of beef...

The way to make the burgers stick is to take a piece of bread and toast it very dark. Then in a bowl, put a little bit of warm water, put the toast in till you mash it up and throw it in the meat. Im sure bread crumbs would work just as well. Bread is always handy for me, and it works every time!

These were AWESOME!  I served them on a tortilla (instead of the onion roll) with a piece of cheese.  I agree with many of the other reviews, a whole 7 oz can of chipotle peppers would be way too much, I used about 1/2 the can and the spiciness was just right.  I did add some breadcrumbs to the beef mixture, as it was hard to keep the patties sticking together.  The avocado salsa is delicious and compliments the burger!

Like many others, I found that it was too much chipotle peppers and cilantro.  I baked the burgers at 350, but found it took almost an hour to bake through.  Next time I'll try it on a higher temperature.

Absolutely delicious! I've never made anything like it but I'll definitely be making this again! I added an egg to help hold it together and I put them in the fridge overnight to grill the next morning. Worked great! No crumbling! I had salsa left over too and it is DELICIOUS with Nacho Cheese Doritos! I may make the salsa separately just for kicks. :)

yummy :-) Nice twist to change it up once in a while. I only used one pepper since my daughter doesnt like spicy food, but she still liked it. I wouldnt make it with more than two small to medium chipotle peppers for  my taste. Added breadcrumbs as well. thank u

I had to throw together a last minute meal for a friend coming over and this was PERFECT! I used my own burger recipe (onions, garlic, worcestershire) and added the cilantro. I didn't use jalapeno peppers in the salsa, but next time I will add one or both.

So delicious I want to make it again this week. Move over Red Robin or Tookie's. These taste like gourmet burgers. I used Angus ground chuck and habanero Cheddar on top. Quick to make and easily cooked in a cast iron skilled on the stove. Just wonderful!

5 Star- 5 ALARM, I made use 2lbs ground beef and no jalapeños, but all else the same.  Great flavor, but hoowee it's spicy, I'll be cutting down to half a can (maybe less) next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Really great concept and wonderful concentration of ingredients... used 2 lbs. of ground venison and regular bakery buns.  Yummy!  Spicy and hot but not not inedible...the heat was perfectly balanced with the flavor.  The avocado salsa was the perfect counterpoint for this sandwich.  Will make again, again and yes, again...happily...this is the perfect hamburger recipe!!!  Happiness on a bun!!!

It was pretty spicy with the and chipotle peppers.  I would not add the chipotle peppers. It can still be delicious and spicy with seasonings.
