I only made one change and that was using reduced fat mayonnaise only because I don't use Miracle Whip. This recipe wasn't bad--I think it needs more......something. Tomato? Garlic? Onion? I'm not sure. I liked it but it seemed to be lacking. I'll make it again but I'll play with it a little.

This is a standard dip for crudites.  Very thick with the ingredients that we had on hand.  Tasty but might thin it out with a little milk (1 or 2 tbs. next time) for ease of dipping (i.e. veggies were breaking off in the dip).  We used mayo instead of Miracle Whip, the entire packet of vegetable soup mix (Lipton), and regular cream cheese.  Instead of diced tomatoes on top, we served with grape tomatoes.

Serving suggestions: Sticks of cucumber, bell pepper, celery, grape tomatoes, jicama, and mini sweet peppers.  

First time making dip?  Don't forget to leave time for the dip to chill in the fridge.  The dried veggies from the soup mix need time to soften.
