I liked the taste of this muffins, however I must say I did some changes after reading the reviews.  First I reduced the milk to 1 cup and no water at all, then I added 3/4 cup of flour instead of a 1/2 , added a 2tsp of baking powder and 1 cup of honey instead of 1/2 so they are a bit sweeter.  My family loved them and so did I. 

Definitely will make them again!

These muffins are delicious! I stuck with 1c almond milk and no water and increased the honey to 1/2 cup. Doesn't make 24 full muffins, probably because of the liquid reduction, might be better to make less and fill the cups. They were done in about 20 minutes. I'm not sure what Gisela was hoping for; I've never heard of muffins turning into flowers ;). Perfectly sweet, nutty and healthy, I might try rinsing the quinoa first to get rid of any bitterness.

This certainly didn't turn out how I hoped.  I might have done something wrong, but they turned out hard and bitter.  I was disappointed with the results.  As others have said, the muffins never rose, even with longer cook times.

I think there is too much pumpkin in this recipe.  It came out really dense and did not raise at all and I even added more baking powder.  If you look at the pumpkin & milk vs flour (quinoa & wheat) ratio it seems like you need more flour but the batter was the right consistency as muffins.  Maybe less pumpkin and it would be a good recipe.  I also added a lot more sweetener to it & it still is not sweet enough (Yeah I like my muffins like cupcakes). Even dark chocolate chips would be good too!

Add an extra egg and 3/4 cup of honey, syrup, or sugar.  That's the key.  (I use organic maple syrup from Costco in baked goods... it's cheaper and very delish!) I also added some brewer's yeast and vanilla because... why not?  increased milk a bit... didn't measure... and I let mine sit overnight in the fridge too... maybe that's why they turned out so good.  This recipe is actually something healthy that my 3-year-old will eat... in abundance.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I follow the recipe exactly and they turn out 1) bitter and no sweetness at all 2) the cupcakes were not slightly firm even with long cooking time (I left them 45 min they didn't rose)
