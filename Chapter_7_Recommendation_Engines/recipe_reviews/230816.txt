I've tried many variations of mashed cauliflower and while I've enjoyed them all, all were not as "fluffy" as I would like, and in fact leaned toward the "porridge-like" side - until now.  Steaming the cauliflower, rather than cooking it in water, obviously is the solution and I'm happy to be this recipe's first reviewer so I can reveal the secret!

I absolutely HATE cauliflower!  What possessed me to try this recipe I have no idea, but I am glad I did!  Creamy and delicious and definitely not overpowering on the cauliflower flavor.  

A few hints to make it stand out:  
Be sure you drain the cauliflower after steaming.  You may even find a way to squeeze excess water from it.  Once everything is blended, it is very thin.  It holds it's shape and "acts" like mashed potatoes, but still very thin.  

I felt the salt was actually lacking so I doubled the amount.

Keep the food processor running the whole time while you add stuff.  You want to really process the heck out of it to get that creamy consistency.

HERE IS THE BIG HINT!!!  Once you are done and ready to scoop it out of the food processor to serve it - DON'T!  Scoop it out and put it back in the pot you used to steam the cauliflower (after draining and drying the pot).  Heat it until piping hot.  On medium, this will only take a minute or two while you stir constantly.  Because the cauliflower is whirring around in the processor and you're adding cold cream cheese and cold parmesan cheese, it really brings the temperature way down.  I ate it immediately (it was good) and then tried a 2nd batch after heating it and the difference was dramatic.  HEAT!

From a healthy standpoint this recipe is great. It is low carb, has fiber, low fat, and low calories. To top, it is super easy to make. The garlic flavor is prominent, so you must like garlic. I had a 16oz bag of cauliflower in the freezer, I wanted to use up. I defrosted it and steamed it in the microwave for 5 minutes. For the tablespoon of cream cheese I had to use regular, as it was all I had from another recipe. The salt seemed like a lot, so I did use the Kosher salt suggested. It wasn't too salty. I don't have a food processor, so I put it in my Vitamix blender on medium speed. I tried to cream half of it, but it moved to the sides of the container. So, I added the rest of the ingredients minus the other half of the cauliflower. When I did that it all blended. After it was creamed I added the other half of the cauliflower and blended it until it was a good consistency. I like the way this looks like mashed potatoes, but doesn't give that heavy belly filling. I got about 3 small servings.

I love cauli, so I knew I would like this recipe.  However, please try next time to roast the cauli first; sprinkle evoo, garlic salt/pepper on 400d til it turns brown/crispy...then mash it and add the cream cheese and parm cheese to make it really creamy.  You'll never eat cauli any other way! Yum!

Oh. My. Goodness. This is unbelievable! I have tried mashed cauliflower before and it was terrible. I don't know if this is so good because of steaming it or using the food processor instead of a mixer or adding cream cheese and parm. But whatever it is, I'm not messing with it! My husband even thought he was eating mashed potatoes (just not my usual ones :) I will definitely make this again. ***7/31/13 - I made this again and messed with it :) I used Laughing Cow Light Garlic and Herb Cheese Wedges and refrigerated minced garlic. I also used my immersion blender which worked very well. Came out great and was even easier to make with less clean up.

This is a great variation to use cauliflower. I grow my own and have been looking for some tasty recopies. I did modify the recipe slightly by topping with butter which melted on the top. Additionally I added some spices for more flavor. Otherwise the method of mashing the vegetable is awesome. My husband had two large helping. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious.  I used my immersion blender to puree.  I added a bit more fresh herbs (right in the steamer) and used non dairy cream cheese as well as Parm cheese.  I am going to stock up on cauliflower when it goes on sale because my family really enjoyed this.  **5/14/13 update.  I roasted my cauliflower with garlic and onions I tossed in a little olive oil with some salt and pepper.  I added fresh herbs the last 5 minutes of cooking then pureed everything in a bowl using my stick blender.  Took the flavor to another level; soooo good!  I sprinkled with Parmesan cheese to serve.  Even my one son - who never eats cauliflower- ate this and asked for seconds!

A hint for those who found it to be too runny.  Try cooking the cauliflower less, so that it is still a little firm rather than mushy. Also, fresh cauliflower, trimmed then soaked in cold water for a half hour or more will improve both texture and flavor. (True for most fresh veggies!). Enjoy!

This is another good healthy recipe that I found under the MyPlate recipes collection that I really enjoyed.  I have tried cauliflower a couple times in my life and I could not stand it.  But I kept hearing about how good mashed cauliflower is so I decided to go ahead and give it another chance..and I'm so glad I did! I used fresh cauliflower and used minced garlic.  I overdid it with the garlic but that was my fault. Next time I will use much less garlic and more parmesan cheese. I just love being able to prepare a healthy dish that also tastes great! thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is a good base recipe, but as is it is very bland.  I used 4 tbs cream cheese and 1 cup parmesan.  I got 6 good-sized servings.

I switched to a low g.i. diet, and I love this recipe.  Tastes great, and nice to have with a grilled steak.  The only thing I do differently is roast a few cloves of garlic in the oven (toss in olive oil) rather than sauteing it., and using some butter (not much) instead of cream cheese.  I have made this several times, and have found that the food processor makes a big difference.  I've tried mashing with potato masher as well as hand mixer, but the texture comes out best with the food processor.

This dish saved my diet! I've been struggling with my love of all things potatoes, especially mashed potatoes. After eating this dish, I will never make mashed potatoes again! My husband didn't even know he was eating Cauliflower until I told him. I used a little extra parm, and didn't need the salt. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!

I. Loved. These. What more can I say. I had tried mashed cauliflower in a restaurant once and really did not care for it. This, however, was delicious. I will make this alot now. I substituted full fat sour cream for the cream cheese because that's what I had on hand and it worked great. I also used butter to saute the garlic. Yum!

I could not say enough good things ! I always read reviews before making a dish and I noticed the complaint that they came out soupy a bunch of times. So I decided to roast the cauliflower with salt and pepper in the over on 450d for 20 min. then followed the recipe completely, except adding more garlic since we love it. The texture was PERFECT. The taste was right on.

These were delicious. I totally modified the instructions though. I'm a college student without a stove or food processor. So I steamed the cauliflower in the microwave with my pampered chef steamer bowls, used a potato masher to mash, used already minced garlic, and just added the rest of the ingredients, microwaved for about 20 second and stirred. Not quite smooth...but I really enjoy it that way.

Delicious.  this will become a regular with our dinners.  We never eat mashed potatoes due to the starch and carbs.  But THIS . . . well this is so good!  I whipped it until smooth in my vitamix.  I also added a bit more cream cheese, maybe another tablespoon, and a bit of cream.  I used shaved parmesan as well as grated.  The grated really brought out the parmesan flavor, so I'm not sure that using the shaved added anything.  I just had some in my refrigerator and thought I'd use it.  The grated is much stronger.  Bottom line, I am making this regularly from now on!!  YAY!!  it's like we get mashed potatoes again!  NO starches or carbs!

Pretty good, considering I dont like cauliflower at all.  I dont have a food processor, so I had to improvise with a hand mixer.  It wasn't bad, not great either, but I added some butter to it and pretended it was mashed potatoes and it tasted better lol

Wow- I used a small head of cauli, so mine ended up pretty creamy. Rather then enjoying this dish as a mashed potato substitute I boiled some pasta and used it as an amazing white sauce side dish. My family LOVED it!!! A very serendipitous outcome!! Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe. I have made one very similar except instead of the cream cheese I add 1 cube of laughing cow garlic & herb cheese and a tsp. of light butter.

My kids love roasted cauliflower so I thought I'd give this a try. They all liked it but we all felt we would prefer a thicker texture. Made as directed, it is very thin. Good flavor and definitely a healthy choice

I used 2 tbs of butter instead of olive oil. I doubled the garlic and I did not pre cook it, I chopped it raw in the food processor with the other ingredients. I  also added 1-3 tsp of horseradish.

Fabulous faux mashed spuds! Making only one serving, I started with 1/4 head of cauliflower florets. I used whipped cream cheese with chives, added butter, non-dairy creamer (Mocha Mix), about 1/8 c. instant spud flakes, chopped garlic and chopped shallots, and a little shredded parm. Blended to a creamy consistency with my immersion blender, then reheated on the stove. Served as a side to my chicken fried steak with country gravy, green beans, and corn bread. Perfecto!

This was my first time making mashed cauliflower. I really wasn't expecting it to taste anything like mashed potatoes. WOW! This stuff was delicious! I found that the consistency was a bit dry (I steamed my cauliflower and let it cool/drain in a colander prior to processing), so I added a splash of milk just to smooth it out. Besides that, I followed the recipe as is and it was fantastic! My boyfriend was a bit disappointed when I came home and told him we were having mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes, but he ended up loving this. This will definitely be a staple in my house. Healthy comfort food!

I just made this to go with my pork tender loin that is in the slow cooker and gravy. I have a tough time finding veggies my fiance will eat so I have started disguising them as his favourite foods. These taste just like mashed potatoes and I can't wait to see if he notices! I don't know how other people got a thin and running consistency but mine turned out fluffy and exactly looking like mashed potatoes! I did add the cream cheese a little bit at a time and I also used at least double the amount (fat free of course) and half of the salt. I also let them sit in the fridge then heated them up and the flavour was even better! I took a great suggestion from one reviewer and really made sure all the water was drained from the cauliflower after I steamed them. Great, yummy recipe and I will for sure use this for Thanksgivings dinner and see if I can trick my whole family! Thank you for this!

I thought the recipe was supposed to be reviewed on how it was made.  So how do you know whether it was any good or not if you "tweak" it.  Try it the way it says, if you don't like it, then tweak it.

I didn't have cream cheese, used non-fat Greek yogurt.  It was very good, though a bit thin compared to mashed potatoes. Even my non-cheese eating, meat and potatoes husband liked it. Make sure to drain the cauliflower well before putting in food processor. Can then reheat prepared food in teflon pan if needed.

I made this for dinner tonight.  They are amazing!  I didn't have cream cheese so I used a tablespoon of butter and also added a little 1% milk to help with the blending process.  They taste just like garlic mashed potatoes!!

This was wonderful!  I cut up the cauliflower and cooked in the microwave with some water in the bottom of the bowl for 10-20 minutes.  I doubled the recipe, added more Parmesan cheese, and a full 8 oz. box of cream cheese.  The texture was crumbly from using my small food processor but after running it through my Montel Williams emulsifier, the texture was creamy.  It was better than mashed potatoes, with no starchy residue on my spoon.  We loved it.  This recipe is a keeper!

Family liked the flavor but not the consistency. The heating in the saucepan after it is all together is definitely a great idea.

This is definitely the most creamy and mashed-potato-like mashed cauliflower I've made!  Like another reviewer suggested, I used a Laughing Cow Garlic Herb wedge instead of the cream cheese (I'll get more use out of the wedges than the rest of a cream cheese package), and roasted the cauli instead of steaming it.  The only bummer was that it doesn't make as much as I thought a whole head of cauli would make.  Loved it, though!

I've been making this for years, just omitting the cream cheese. My husband would rather eat mashed cauliflower than mashed potatoes! The only other thing I do differently is use an immersion blender to mix it instead of the food processor...it's easier. Love it.

This is great when you can almost whip the califlower in the blender. I love using lots of garlic and herbs to add flavor. I used 3 cloves garlic and a hand full of basil and oregano. Good Parmesan is key as well!

My family is not crazy about mashed cauliflower. I love it but this recipe wasn't the greatest. I made it as written, tasted, then added garlic powder for more garlic flavor and 2 T. butter. I don't have a food processor so just used the potato masher (which doesn't give it a smooth consistency).

We really enjoyed this.  I omitted the cream cheese as I didn't have any. I don't think it needs. Hand mashed, no need to bother with a blender. Used a combination of parmesan & gruyere. Other directions, as written. Topped with chopped fresh parsley. Yummy!

I recommend ROASTING vs steaming cauliflower (most vegetables) for less mushy texture and more robust flavor.

This was easy and worked well. I'm calling it "Mashed Fauxtatos"  I added chives and next time I will halve the garlic and double the cream cheese, but that's personal taste. 5 Stars because it's an easily adaptable recipe. Next day I heated the leftovers and put chicken gravy on it... delicious.

Wow!  Really wonderful!  I used 1/8 tsp garlic powder and skipped sautéing the garlic in olive oil. I didn't have cream cheese so I used butter instead. They were just a bit dry after the first processing so I added just a splash of chicken broth for moisture so the final whirl in the food processor would make them smooth. I've got digestive issues that have removed mashed potatoes from my diet. In this recipe I have found an awesome alternative!!!  Thank you SO MUCH for posting.

This is the best mashed cauliflower I have ever had.  I followed the recipe as written except I had no cream cheese so I used about a fourth cup of low fat sour cream.  I also added another clove of garlic (because I just like fresh garlic).  It has the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Loved it!

Omg!!! This is fab!! I'm a low carber and hesitant to try this.....I don't like cauliflower normally. But I needed something different to go with prime rib, and I am thrilled. The only change/addition I made was extra cream cheese and melted butter. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!

This was so so good that even my carb/fat loving brother couldn't believe there was no butter. I used Avocado oil instead because it has more of a buttery flavor and use extra to help with the mashing. Made with 2 cauliflower heads as a side for a dinner of 8 and the bowl was practically licked clean.

I unfortunately only had a Smoothie Jr blender, (thats going to change,) so it was a pain to blend, i had to add a couple splashes of skim milk, but it turned out great! and smooth, i steamed the cauliflower for 25 minutes in my steamer per steamer directions and added it the way recipe says..i liked it although i may cut the parmesan by a little, it was a little much for me, but my boyfriend like it..i left dinner for him and came home and said how was the cauliflower? he said "what cauliflower? i ate mashed potatoes" i said nope it was cauliflower..SCORE!!.. which is a great substitute since he just got diagnosed with type II diabetes and was missing his mashed potatoes...it really makes about 2 healthy servings , which works out great for us... UPDATE. got a Blend-tec and made it exactly as written, loved it!

This was very tasty:) I've tried all kinds of variations on the SB Diet mashed "potatoes" and this was the best so far. I'm rating 5 stars for the recipe as is, but I added some chives and cooked a package of baby spinach which I then added to the mix.

Loved this.  The only thing I changed was I used a laughing cow wedge instead of the cream cheese and I added just a hint of onion powder and Thyme.  Awesome!  And I don't feel heavy after.  I served it with crock pot turkey breast and roasted carrots.  Delicious  Thank you!!!!

What a winner!  I would never have thought cauliflower could have a fluffy texture, but it does.  DH thought it was potatoes.  I will be doing this regularly.  I did add a little more Cream Cheese and a little less Parm, but I am very pleased with recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Absolutely loved it! I seem to always choose potatoes as a side dish and it was nice to have something different for a change (even if it's the exact same as mashed potatoes).

Nice way to serve cauliflower, but the texture is not what I would have preferred for something "mashed."  Although we enjoyed this healthy side dish, I certainly wouldn't say it it's a sub for mashed potatoes.

I love this recipe as a sub for mashed potatoes...which are too heavy sadly....I have used both EVOO or butter, garlic or none depending on the meal, varied cheeses to accommodate as well.... but I have never used cream cheese just out of preference. I like this blended with a potato masher for texture vs machine....Thank you

This was the first time I’ve made mashed cauliflower and I’m happy I selected this recipe. It was smooth, creamy and flavourful. I omitted the Parmesan cheese by accident but still loved it. I will definitely be making this again but probably doubling the recipe because my family enjoyed it too. The only thing I did differently was steaming the cauliflower in my Instant Pot and using an immersion blender to purée. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The only thing I changed was that I came across a creamed Philadelphia herbed cream chesse & I used that. Otherwise I followed the exact recipe & it was delicious. Go very easy on adding more salt as the cream cheese (herbed version) is already salty. Wow this is a great replacement for mashed potato. Love it & will make it again.

I made this when I had company coming for dinner instead of rice/pasta/potato and everyone loved it and the colour presentation with salmon and french string beans was eye appealing and healthy!

Thanks, Andie. I have tries a few other recipes, but this one came out tasting like Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Smooth and creamy. I have no need to continue my quest for the perfect Cauliflower Mash recipe. I have found it.

This is an excellent recipe. Came out great. No, in my opinion it does not replace the goodness of mashed potatoes, but i chose not to make it with the thought that it would. And for someone whos choosing to make healthier decisions, this is a great substitute. This definitely has a place in my regular recipes. Thank you so much for sharing.

This was absolutely  the best recipe for mashed cauliflower that I have ever made! I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. 
We were 5 people for dinner and wiped out a double recipe ....AND 2 of my guests wanted to know how to make them!
Thanks for sharing

This was amazing! I don't really take much time in writing reviews (although I really should) but this recipe deserves it. My husband hates cauliflower, but I know how healthy it can be to substitute. I've tried several different recipes that he didn't care for. This one is the ONLY one he will eat. I swear if I didn't tell him it was cauliflower he would have never known. Thank you so much for this recipe!! Next subject, my Dad...

My husband and I both loved this recipe. I processed it quite a bit in the food processor and it was creamy and more like potatoes than any other cauliflower recipe like this that I have tried. I took it out of the food processor and heated up back up in a sauce pan so it would be hot when I served it. I will make this again and probably double the recipe.

I have never been a fan of cauliflower but since Hubby and I are on Paleo and I miss potatoes...I had to try this!  It was awesome and hubby was so surprised that there was "NO potatoes" in the bowl!  I make this every week!!  thank you for an awesome recipe. Because of paleo, I cannot have cream cheese or Parmesan so I subbed almond milk and butter.  Still awesome!!

I used my hand-held beaters and the consistency was not like mashed potatoes. I ended up baking it with shredded cheese on top. Everyone enjoyed it, even my potato-lover, veggie-hater 17 year old. This is a keeper.

This was super yummy and can't wait to make again.  I love the touch of garlic flavor and the little bit of cream cheese adds that richness that other recipes don't use.

Wow, started a low carb diet and heard about these faux potatoes and man was I surprised.  Followed the recipe almost exactly and was amazed by the consistency of the cauliflower and how similar it ws to potatoes.  It's not exactly like a potato but the flavor and texture is close enough for me to feel like I'm eating steak and potatoes.
I didn't have a food processor but used a bullet blender and it took three pint-full containers to get all the steamed cauliflower through the blender.  After each blend, I would dump in a bowl, the last blend had all the ingredients (cheese, cream cheese, salt, pepper), then just stirred everything together and perfection.
Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I whip up something similar to this, I steam cauliflower until it's soft enough to mash with a fork and add it to instant mash potatoes(quit making that face,Ok,I'm too lazy to peel the spuds) then add garlic salt to taste, a nice quick and easy way to make a healthier garlic mashed potatoes without heating up the kitchen. Try it you'll like it!! Bon Appetite, Adios n' Hasta La Bye Bye!

Great flavor but be sure to squeeze the moisture out of the cauliflower. I had to add potato flakes to mine because they started off too runny.

This was my first time making cauliflower mash and it was unbelievable!  It really tasted like mash potatoes!  I'm also not the greatest cook and I followed the recipe to the "T".  The only thing was I didn't have a food processor so I used my smart stick hand blender and it pureed it so smooth!  Will keep this recipe and will test the hubby next time to see if notices! ha ha ha

Added 2 extra garlic cloves, and used 2 tablespoons reduced fat cream cheese with chive & onion. ‘Superb Sautéed Mushrooms’ from this site and shredded cheddar cheese were used as toppings on the mashed cauliflower. This combination created a terrific side dish.

This was AWESOME!!!  I didn't have parmesan cheese, so I used romano instead.  I think I added a tablespoon of sour cream.  I've tried to make it before and it was just okay, but this recipe is a KEEPER!!!  I think I'm going to make it every week from now on.  I may not ever make potatoes again!!

I mashed mine with a heavy fork as my blender couldn't handle it. I left out the cream cheese.  It was a hit.

This will be a regular dish in our house from now, on! We made it exactly like the recipe,  baked for 1/2 hour at 350, covered in plain panko, with butter drizzled over it, broil to brown, a few minutes.  Awesome!

Came out super creamy!!! They taste amazing! (Don’t stone me) they may be better than mashed potatoes!!!! I threw my cauliflower in the instapot for 3 minutes on steam (next time I’ll try 2 minutes) added a little more of the olive oil while blending and they are great! Even my son (8 year old self professed picky eater) loved them and said “mom I think this is what they really make mashed potatoes out of”

AMAZING!! I like this better than mashed potatoes! I made this almost exactly as written except I used 0% Greek yogurt instead of the cream cheese. This will definitely be on repeat.

Followed the recipe; can't comment on it if you don't. Wife and I enjoyed it very much. We don't think that it needs any changes. Not quite as firm as mashed potatoes, but very tasty.

This one was definitely a hit at my dinner party. I used two heads of cauliflower so I increased most of the ingredients (I eyeballed it, so not sure if I doubled everything exactly). You can easily tweak this to taste, whether you like more garlic, less salt, substitute oils, etc. 2 thumbs up and 5 stars for this recipe!

These taste great! You can also steam them in the microwave and use an old fashioned potato masher if you do not have a food processor.

I substituted 1/8 tsp of Penney’s Roasted Garlic and a heaping tablespoon of full fat cream cheese.  I think it has a good flavor and will be even better once my Braised Beef Short Ribs accompany this. Happy Eating!

This was very good. I just found the garlic flavor to be too strong !  And we like garlic ! Next time I will steam the garlic with the cauliflower. Also, I didn't want to have to clean the food processor, so I used my stick blender and it worked just fine.

Dont need that much olive oil to saute the garlic.  1/2 teaspoon is all you need.  Also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese.

I steamed the cauliflower and added the garlic bulb right to the steamer with some leftover raw broccoli, then followed the directions as written. Absolutely wonderful - husband, wife and kid approved!

We wound up having to add more cheese, a little milk, butter, and parsley.  The texture wasn't right but I used a beater instead of a food processor.  Will try it with the food processor next time.

I used 12 oz. frozen cauliflower instead & then basically followed the directions. After tasting it in the processor, I thought it needed something more for flavor  & richness so I added a little butter. I think I'll add some herbs or spices next time to up the flavor. I'll also be sure to use fresh Parmesan instead of the shelf type for better taste.

This has become a regular  side dish in my house, so good! I like to cook with as few dishes as possible, so I don't cook the garlic, I just add a little minced garlic to the Cuisinart when blending the cauliflower. I do put the olive oil in the Cuisinart with the cauliflower though because that, and the extra cream cheese, make it super creamy. YUM!

This was decent, not great.  This does not taste like mashed potatoes like some people have said but was good enough to make again. I don't have a steamer so I boiled the cauliflower with little water.  I drained it and let it sit for a few minutes before  putting it in the food processor.  The consistency was runny

OMG this was simply amazing!  We've eliminated potatoes from our diet due to carb concerns and have been disappointed with other cauliflower imitations.   After reading the reviews, I decided to give this a chance .. so glad I did!  The only change I made was to not put in the oil.  The pureed cauliflower was just so creamy, I couldn't fathom putting any more liquid into it.  So I added a good squeeze of  minced garlic (from a tube) and not the oil.   I did everything else the same and it was simply fabulous!  My husband said he could have eaten a whole pot of it!  We will be enjoying this often!

First time ever trying cauliflower mash. My husband, who normally does not like cooked cauliflower really liked this and said he would definitely eat it again!  I didn’t change anything about the recipe - consistency and flavor were both great!

I also am on the South Beach Diet and this recipe is awesome!
I used Trader Joe's riced cauliflower, added water, put it in the microwave for 9-10 minutes and then put in my food processor with the rest of the ingredients . I added more garlic as we just can't get enough of it!
Thanks Andie for a great recipe...SBD can be challenging!

I loved it! Trying to eat healthier and eat more vegetables. The texture was creamy, and fooled my brain into thinking they were potatoes.
Next time I will try to cut down on the cheeses, to make even healthier.

Who knew that the key to a perfect cauliflower mash is steaming the cauliflower? I had garlic but was rushing and added garlic powder instead. Came out perfect, the consistency was the closest I've made to mash potatoes. Love it, thanks!

I don't own a food processor, so I used the ol' potato masher. Put some butter in the bottom of a bowl, added a lot of minced garlic, grated the cheese on top of it, added a wee bit of milk and mashed away. Delicious!

BEST EVER SECRET FOR "FLUFF!" I already loved mashed cauliflower but after learning this trick, took it to a whole other level of  YUM!
After the cauli is done, BEFORE adding to blender, use cheese cloth (or very clean, lightweight towel) to squeeze out as much water as possible.  Then find the largest, most shallow dish that fits in the microwave, and  nuke 'em m for a few mins (depends on how much cauli you've got, and microwave  power). 
You will be AH-MAZED at the difference & extra fluff you get this way!  Not watery, texture identical to mashed potatoes!
Speaking of which, try chives & grated cheese for garnish ... delish!

So easy.
So delicious,  I started eating it right out of the blender!

Also,  I used 2 tablespoons of sour cream instead of cream cheese and a whole cup of shaved Parmesan/Romano/Asiago. 

Yeilds 6cups.

I loved this recipe!  I steamed the cauliflower and then put it in a bowl with paper towels under it and over it.  I gently squeezed the cauliflower to remove the excess water.  I had roasted garlic in the fridge; mashed five cloves and added it to the cauliflower.  (Roasted garlic is delicious and is milder tasting after roasting.)  I added the cream cheese, but felt that half the parmesan cheese  was all that was required.  It's always wonderful to find a veggie dish that is healthy and delicious!

I gave this a 5 because I the whole trick to making this is steaming, not boiling the cauliflower.   I made it close to the recipe but I was out of Cream Cheese and didn't want to buy a whole block for only 1 T. - I used some real cream I had left from making whipped cream for something else.  The big problem I find with mashed cauliflower is how runny it usually is - the steaming really helps with this problem but not totally.   I added about 1/2 tsp of Xanthum Gum - to make it thicker (could use other instant thickening agents).  This is the best "mashed cauliflower" recipe I've tried yet.  It's a keeper - thanks for posting.

This was such an easy recipe if you want healthy and flavor together. The only change I made was to steam the cauliflower so that it wasn't full if water.  I have made this many times..it truly is a substitute for mashed potatoes!

Made these twice exactly as called for in the recipe.  In my opinion,  this tastes better than mashed potatoes and satisfies the carb craving on my low carb diet.  Absolutely delicious.  Thank you for sharing!

I tried this because I'm a  greenhorn when it comes to cauliflower. It turns out that you should make your mashed cauliflower the same way you make mashed potatoes. I've never used parmesan cheese or cream cheese in mashed potatoes and I shouldn't have done it with this. Forgo this recipe and make mashed cauliflower the same way you make your cream potatoes. I didn't like this recipe at all.

I made this following the recipe exactly, but no one in my household liked it's overall flavor.  It looked like mashed potatoes, but the overall taste was overwhelmingly cauliflower with no hint of garlic or the parmesan.  I would not make this again.

Lovely recipe. I made it last night and put roast sockeye on top with a green side salad. Ate the leftovers  this morning with scrambled eggs for breakfast. Yummy. I didn't have cream cheese or Parmesan on hand so I just used a Tblsp of sour cream instead. This is a great recipe for Diabetics who can't do the carbs in potatoes.

I love this recipe! Very flavorful and fluffy. Such a great alternative to potatoes, especially when trying to cut back on carbs. My husband, who hates cauliflower, raved about this dish! I think the key to making sure it doesn't turn out runny, is to make sure you drain the cauliflower really well before putting it in the food processor. Thank you so much for sharing! :)

This is so yummy!  I added a tsp and a half more of the cream cheese but that's all.  Needed to make for my hubby who has stage 4 pancreatic cancer and his Dr said to make to add to his mashed potatoes to help with his glucose levels , he rolled his eyes but he loves it also!  Its a hit!!

I made this for myself to have in place of mashed potatoes at Thanksgiving dinner. I only made one head if cauliflower not knowing if anyone would want to try it, let alone like it. Everyone I fed for Thanksgiving LOVED it!...even my niece who's 11! The flavor was excellent! I flowed the recipe as written! I will have mashed cauliflower over potatoes anytime!

These were pretty good, but didn't seem very garlicky.  I made them in a blender, so they were very smooth, but almost too smooth, as my potatoes generally aren't that smooth.  This was my first time making any type of mashed cauliflower, so I think I would like to try it the traditional way with milk and butter and see which on I like best.

One word, AMAZING! It's so good! My only problem will be to sell it to my mashed potato lovers because it looks just like mashed potatoes but it tastes different of course. But it's really tasty and healthy at the same time!

I've heard lots of great reviews about mashed cauliflower. I bought a small head just incase I didn't like it. Followed the directions but added 2 cloves of garlic and 2 tablespoons of cream cheese. I don't have a food processor so I tried using a stick blender. Big mistake. It sent pieces of cauliflower every where. So I put it in my Vitamix. It blended it ok. I put it back into a bowl and then was able to use my stick blender for a smoother consistency. It didn't work. I still had tiny bits of cauliflower. I was expecting more of a mash potato consistency. But that was ok. My husband who rarely eats cauliflower ate this one up and my very picky eater son was very hesitant since he hates mashed potatoes liked it and actually ate his share. Will make it again. Thanks!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I tweaked it a bit since I did not have cream cheese.  I used butter instead. It definitely looked strange since I used purple cauliflower, but the tasty was yummy.  Thanks for this keeper.

This was an awesome substitute for mashed potatoes.  I forgot the cream cheese but added a little more parmesan cheese.  Everyone loved it!  Forgot to take picture before and it's all gone now! Will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

Excellent. Great replacement for mashed potatoes. It is very creamy.  I might add a bit more garlic next time, but this is awesome.

This was very good.  I roasted the cauliflower and garlic with some olive oil salt, and pepper.  I didn't have any cream cheese, so I substituted goat cheese.  I added dried rosemary and some extra garlic salt.

Made this twice, and it is delicious, can't stop eating it. I was just wondering, how big a head of cauliflower, there are different sizes? Made it today and cut the recipe in half, didn't have much cauliflower. Didn't have cream cheese, so used ff sour cream. Put the sour cream in coffee filters to drain some of the water out, added a little bit more garlic. Love it!

First time trying Mashed Cauliflower. Really liked it. I was afraid it would be too bland so I tripled the garlic and added a little Dijon mustard. Next time I think I would like to try roasting the cauliflower and the garlic.

I made as per the recipe and it wasn't good at all. The consistency was really too smooth - almost silky which I found to be off-putting. My kids were not into it either. The flavor was odd and the texture was too weird.

This was yummy. I make mashed cauliflower a lot, but haven't ever added parm and garlic to it before. I had roasted a head of garlic so I used that in this.. and added more. For me this needed more s&P but I did like the addition of the garlic quite a bit

What a difference those two little tbs of cream cheese make!  I have tried other recipes and been disappointed, but this really is good.  I cheated a little.  Instead of cooking the garlic and adding it, I used Garlic Herb low fat cream cheese.  This will be repeated often.  Thanks, Andie.

I was looking at mashed cauliflower recipes because I love mashed potatoes a little too much and I was wanting a healthier, low carb version. This recipe, while not as good as melt in your mouth mashed potatoes, it is good. I used 2 cloves of garlic and that is the saving grace of mashed cauliflower. I don’t think it’s as good as mashed potatoes, but it is good enough to replace potatoes once a week, so I can consume fewer carbs.

I just made it for the first time. I used regular cream cheese,  and added more salt, parmesan cheese,  and pepper. Added chopped parsley on top. Really delicious!!! Great recipe.

Spend the extra time blending this for an extra creamy outcome, completely eliminates the grittiness of the cauliflower. Brought this to thanksgiving and many turned from their traditional potato’s to this dish. I used a food processor initially, then once combined I used an immersion blender to make it extra creamy

This is a great simple recipe for fluffy cauliflower mash.  I did not have cream cheese so I substituted with a lightly packed cup of parmesan cheese and about a tablespoon of non salted butter.  Added extra garlic and then some scallions on top at the end.  My husband loved it so much he told me to make it again!  SUCCESS

YUM!!! My dad was asking me to make mashed potatoes as he liked the ones I made for thanksgiving, but I wanted to make something healthier and I stumbled upon this recipe. Soooooo good, almost like the real thing! I made a few adjustments, I used 2 tablespoons of sour cream instead of cream cheese because that’s what I had and I like it extra creamy. I also steamed the cauliflower for 14 minutes because I didn’t feel like they were tender enough at ten. The first batch was good but the second batch I made I added 3/4 tablespoon of butter and this made it deeeelicious.

Wonderful!  I used a little extra garlic (always do) and pepper and it came out fantastic!  Garnished with chives. 

Would have preferred a 10 or 12-cup food processor but I only have an 8-cup.

Everyone liked it!  I used a potato masher instead of a food processor.  Looked like mashed potatoes, but tasted lighter.  Will be eating more cauliflower from now on.  More veggies for the family is always a good thing!

I was looking for a low carb replacement for my potato fix and this one looked pretty tasty and easy to make.
I made it exactly as written.
I have never had mashed cauliflower before so I didn't have my expectations set high - but WOW I love this recipe.
It came out perfect.
I think I like it even more than my beloved potatoes.
I'll be making this very often.
Thanks.

This recipe was so great!! Trying to find good alternatives for the upcoming holidays with the family without feeling guilty of over indulging, while at the same time not feeling left out and being envious of everyones dinner plates. This mashed cauliflower hot the spot! I was soo surprised how good this was! I didn’t have any garlic at the time, so I used garlic salt and omitted the salt called for and waited till afterwards to taste. I used about a tsp of garlic salt and it was perfect for my likes. Not too salty or over powering with the garlic flavor.

It’s more like risotto texture which i didn’t mind. I couldn’t whip it perfectly smooth like a mashed potato. So next time I’ll add more cheese to mimic risotto better and may even add some mushrooms or other ingredients that risotto is made with usually. But it is a great recipe as is.

Awesome. Made it just as the recipe said. Very creamy!    Came out perfect.   Next time I will add a little more garlic.  My husband was pleasantly surprised.  We both love mashed potato but I am diabetic so this is a great alternative for me and a bonus that he liked it too.

I've tried store bought mashed cauliflower before and was kind of turned off at its flavor and how water it was. Then, I made this recipe and it totally changed my mind on mashed cauliflower was a great substitute for mashed potatoes!

Substituted mayo for cream cheese, butter for olive oil. I boiled the cauliflower instead, drained, mashed it with the back of a spoon then baked it in the microwave at 400F/200C for 15 minutes with the sautéed garlic mixed it.

This is the best recipe I have tried! Steaming the cauliflower was the trick. It was a bit dry so I added three times the cream cheese and some light sour cream. Also added a bit more garlic.  It took more processing time than I expected so hang in there - Process away!

Highly recommend!! I doubled the recipe since we have teenagers, but followed the instructions. Steaming the cauliflower is key. Finished it off in the oven at 300 degrees to melt cheese on top that we added and keep it warm. My husband said it was better than mashed potatoes which is very high praise!

Exceptional change to mashed! My go-to recipe for a substitute for sure.

p.s. I tried it with broccoli .... nope.

OMG! I made the cauliflower mash this morning and it was soooo good! I did roast the cauliflower and garlic then added it to my food processor! So smooth and the roasted garlic (I LOVE garlic) made it so flavorful! I did add the cream cheese and whipping cream!

I didn't have cream cheese and used herb flavored goat cheese.  
I made it early w a bit of parmesan on top, put it in a baking dish and backed it later at 350 for 25 min. while prepping the rest of the dinner. It was lovely with the fresh parsley on top!! It was delicious.  This will become a regular at our house.

So good! Doing keto so I used 3 TBS of regular (full fat!!!) creme cheese and instead of parm, used 1/2 cup of Trader Joe's Quatro Formaggio. I've tried a few other cauliflower recipes but this is number one! Also got to use my "new" (Craigslist) food processor.

My husband is a diabetic and on a low carb diet. It’s hard to find good recipes for him. I have made this 3 times and it is delicious. The last time I was in a hurry and made it with frozen cauliflower rice, still great!

Love this recipe...but we're on a low fat diet (seniors) and no cream cheese added...but added small amount of 1/2&!/2 plus teaspoon butter to make the mash.  Garlic and real parmesan cheese sets this dish off.  Mashed califlower instead of mashed potatoes...great!  Thank you

This recipe came out delicious! I added sharp Cheddar cheese instead of parmesan. I also added 2 cooked Yukon Potatoes to give it a more dense texture.

This is an easy recipe for mashed cauliflower! I used a pressure cooker to “steam” the cauliflower. I didn’t have Parmesan cheese or cream cheese so I substituted mozzarella for the Parmesan and butter for the cream cheese. Otherwise I followed the recipe. You could almost pull this off as mashed potatoes! It was so creamy and tasty! I will certainly add this recipe to my regular rotation.

So delicious! I think I may have had a larger head of cauliflower than the recipe writer did so I had to increase the amount of cheese in the recipe. Turned out perfectly, and my boyfriend liked it better than the frozen name brand mashed cauliflower we've had in the past.

Perfect starter to make this potato substitute. Followed it fairly closely. Subbed sour cream for cream cheese and added about 1 tablespoon of olive oil and almond milk to the last few seconds of the food processor. Perfect texture! Adding some fresh parsley and green onion as garnish.

Husband and I were delighted this recipe is  terrific,  better than expected.  Others commented on the flavor, so we gave it  try rather than mashed potatoes. Love potatoes, but cauliflower has fewer calories. I feel the difference.

Made one change to simplify, I used garlic salt rather than cooking a single clove f garlic. It worked!  We've enjoyed this dish twice this week. .

Wonderful recipe.  The only alterations I made were adding 4 oz of cream cheese, and I substituted 2 tablespoons of butter for the olive oil.

Very very tasty... I added just a touch more salt and used full fat cream cheese.  It will never be like real mashed potatoes because the tiny florets don’t fully blend out but super delicious when I can’t have starchy foods.  I will make this again

I don't add the salt. I also just used almond milk. I know for some those might be deal breakers lol but just a few slices of butter and the almond milk gives it the sweetness plus the garlic and pepper really distracts from the lack of salt :). It's a great alternative to mashed potatoes and once you get used to it can be just as enjoyable knowing it's good for you! 

I paired it with brussel sprouts and carrots (no salt no butter) and some spicey lemon chicken I seasons with tumeric, a tablespoon of algea oil instead of olive oil, crushed red pepper, lemon slices, cayanne pepper, and paprika mainly for color to counter the heavy dose of tumeric. The chicken is great for arthritis and without those carbs that helps not swell the joints!

This recipe was great I made it for dinner ,  and the flavor was really yummy! Even my boyfriend loved it and he doesn’t like veggies. 

I used my nutribullet which made it into more of like a cauliflower purée but it was sti delicious . Next time I’ll use a food processor maybe it’ll be more chunky . Definitely a great low carb option!

I was very skeptical about this, but had a head of cauliflower that needed to be used up.  Followed recipe with exception of substituting regular cream cheese for low fat.  A little time consuming to process, but result was delicious.  Leftovers were also very good.

OH MY --- If you're hesitant about trying this, go for it!  I took the advice of a previous review and roasted the cauliflower in the oven (425 for about 30-35min until slightly tender).  It was SOOOOOOOOOO good!!  I did process it for quite a while to break it down to more of a smooth/potato consistency.  Eating this helps my mashed potato cravings, I'm so happy!!! 
 Thank you for the recipe!!!  So yummy!

Many years ago, I made a mashed cauliflower and hated it but since we went on a low-carb diet again I thought I got to try another recipe and this is the first one I went to. I had no fresh califlower so used 12 oz Frozen califlower rice, cooked covered 7 or 8 minutes without added water, in 1100 watt microwave. I did add a tiny bit of cream to get  the creaming started & always add my own extra seasonings  that we like. Turned out wonderful! I actually used it in my own low carb version of  shepherd's pie. Hubby was raving over it. Ty!

Pretty good. I upped the amount of garlic and cream cheese. Came out just as good. Add Garlic to your taste though. I added three cloves of garlic and that was just enough for me!

Loved these cauliflower potatoes. Used garlic butter instead of olive oil and garlic  and I microwaved my cauliflower for seven minutes, but other than that I followed the directions. Easy and delicious, highly recommend.

Good but hard to blend in blender.  Didn’t have Parmesan so used old white cheddar and it was great. I will make again but will try something different to purée it.

The thing that really makes mashed cauliflower work for me is drying it out in the convection oven after I steam it, but before mashing.  I give it about 10 minutes at 300.  You can see very visible steam coming off the cauliflower; that's all the water that won't be watering down the finished product.

This recipe is great.  I use roast garlic, myself, and quite a lot more than one clove, but that's a matter of personal taste.  And I generally do about half of the cauliflower in the Cuisinart and the other half with a potato masher, just so it has a little texture, but again, everybody has their own theory on how lumpy mashed "potatoes" should be.

I made these amazing mashed potato substitutes to top a healthier version of shepherds pie.  I substituted based on what I had available.  I used frozen riced cauliflower which steamed in the microwave perfectly.  I also used regular cream cheese bc that's what I already had in the fridge. The only other change was I threw in a small amount of chicken broth for added flavor because I had some on hand from cooking the peas and carrot for my shepherds pie.  I will be making this recipe again.

Omg- almost as good as mashed potatoes!  In fact, I used an electric beater rather than a food processor. They were amazing, even if you’re not watching your carbs. I also added a tablespoon of sour cream and butter and omitted the olive oil.

Great recipe as written and that is what the five stars are for.
As a preference I add more garlic.  I also add some shredded cheddar when I'm heating it back up in the pot. Another reviewer suggested re-heating after blending and it's definately more delicious this way. I used an immersion blender like so many suggested and it worked fine.

This recipe is quite good. A tip to cut down the time of boiling the cauliflower is to freeze it in batches/serving sizes; good for single people.

It is a reasonable substitute for mashed potatoes.  The consistency was not creamy, but more liquid and the taste was not different enough from cauliflower that I had expected.  I will work on this a bit and change the recipe a bit to thicken it up and to spice it up.

On vacation so I didn't have my processor...cooked cauliflower longer, maybe 20 minutes and used potato masher. Still a little lumpy so you could probably cook even longer if you want that  smooth texture. I added 3 Tbsp milk, 2 Tbsp butter, and 2 Tbsp sour cream. All in all, it was a good recipe...I might make a few more changes next time.

I am on a keto diet and love mash potatoes.  I did not think I would like this stuff but boy o boy was I wrong it was amazing. I steamed cauliflower in my instant pot for 4 minutes and squeezed out most of the juice in a dish towel.  Put it all in my Ninja blender!  I used real butter instead of olive oil and full cream cheese.  Also used garlic powder because I was out of garlic.   Looked like mash potatoes and the taste was like  decked out mash potatoes

Truly remarkable. Food processor and steaming method is an absolute must with this recipe.  Anyone find a way to tighten up the end result? I found it kind of loose.

I was not crazy about this one.  I would have much preferred roasted or raw cauliflower than to try to imitate mashed potatoes.  While it did not taste bad it reminded me of baby food.

I fixed it the other night and didn't tell anyone that it wasn't potato's. My husband likes his potatoes a bit lumpy but he liked it just the same. It was smooth and creamy. Its something I'll be playing with a lot.

This is a good base recipe, especially if you haven't made mashed cauliflower before, but I did make some changes.  I used chive and onion cream cheese, and a lot more of it than the recipe called for, which I feel like made the main difference in giving this dish some flavor.  I also added garlic salt and onion powder (two of my go-to's), but whatever spices you like will work.  Also, I added more garlic.  In the end, it came out really good.

Steaming made ALL the difference. These were much lighter and fluffier than other versions I have tried.  The only change I made was to sauté the garlic in EVOO *and* butter.  Decadent!

Turned out great!  Could barely tell it wasn’t mashed potatoes.  I omitted the cheese to keep it low calorie and added butter spuds.  I also didn’t cook garlic and just tossed everything in the food processor.  Super easy and a guilt free substitute for mashed potatoes.

this would be good, i cannot wait to make it, but i'll give you a hint. I have a friend, that has a similar recipe, and she processes both the cauliflower and then cut up cerely root, salt and pepper, and that's it. No additives. I thought it was mashed potatoes at first. I honestly did! it's delicious
Thank you for letting me write this, i will try it both ways and follow up on my review

I steamed the cauliflower as suggested by others.  I also used minced garlic and skipped the cooking.  I did use a blender to purée ingredients and heated in the microwave wave to be sure it was hot before serving.  My guests and I loved it!  My husband doesn’t like cauliflower so he picked at it.  I will definitely make again.  Great alternative to potatoes.

It tasted good and was easy to make,  however, we like our cauliflower crunchy and to make this it has to steam extra,  which makes it soft. We prefer crunchy cauliflower casseroles!

It was very runny, so I added some instant potatoes. My boys didn't realize it was 80% cauliflower until I told them.

Easy to make. A little chunky with our food processor. Most people like it, but my son who doesn't like veggies can still taste it is cauliflower.

Very tasty! We followed the recipe as written and added a little extra cream cheese. The consistency was similar to whipped potatoes, which was nice. I may add a bit more parmesan next time.

I was out of Parmesan so I used cheddar—-still super good.  I also used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1. This was lovely under a salmon filet.

Anyone that tells you this is a good substitute for potatoes is crazy. Don’t expect to put gravy on it. The texture was like baby food and it was too sweet.

This was the first time I've tried cauliflower as a substitute for mashed potatoes and I have to say I was quite impressed!  I was a little heavy handed on both cheeses, but, I think that just added to the great flavor.  It served 4 but could have served six!

I made this tonight but tweaked it slightly. I know, one of those people... I steamed the cauliflower, smashed and cooked the garlic in olive oil, but instead of parmesan cheese and cream cheese, I did two tablespoons+/- of rondele garlic&herbs spreadable cheese. Finished it with some black pepper in the food processor and then forgot to top with chives (oh well!) It turned out really good! Definitely will make again as a substitute for regular mashed potatoes.

Sorry, the cooking directions are an absolute joke; steaming the cauliflower does not render it nearly mushy enough to mash. Next time, I'll boil the cauliflower. This recipe shows much promise because the combination of olive oil, garlic, and seasonings is very yummy with this vegetable.

I have never been a lover of cauliflower but I have been eating it in lieu of potatoes now that I don't eat many carbs. THIS recipe, however, was SO good that I liked it better than the mashed, cheesy potatoes I allowed myself on Thanksgiving.  I could (and will likely) eat these every day. I DID use a very high quality parmesan that I grated for the recipe. I also used regular fat cream cheese since that's what I had. YUM!!

I put my cauliflower in my vitamix, added whole milk along with all the ingredients, and liquified it. I then put the "soupy style" in a pot first, then hand blended more steamed cauliflower and added it all together, and mixed it... DELECTABLE!!!!!!!!

We made this for the first time last night. I was surprised how much I liked it. Maybe my garlic wasn't strong enough (or maybe I just like a lot of garlic), but I would definitely add more than one clove. The cheese gives it enough flavor and the calories are low. What's not to love?

Very good recipe. My only addition was a couple tbsp of unsalted butter. I think I would add a bit more cream cheese and garlic the next time--just personal taste.   The cauliflower didn't get tender enough in the steamer, and I was in a rush, so I finished it in the microwave, and it worked fine. I made this as a side dish to take to a party, and it was well-received.

I added extra cream cheese,salt and pepper to taste. This was extremely filling. Unfortunately, I do no have a food processor and I made a mess trying to use a hand mixer. Obviously, the consistency was not as creamy as it could have been, but it was delicious, none the less.

Very good,  thanks for posting this. The only thing I did differently was to mash the cauliflower in two separate batches in the food processor then put them back together to add the cream cheese,  parm,  etc. I thought this would be faster and less likely to have "lumps" rather than creaming a flowerette at a time.

Turned out very creamy and fluffy.

I cut stems off flowerettes as closely as I could. Steamed for 12 minutes. Added about 1/4 cup onion to 2 garlic cloves in 2 Tbs. olive oil.  Also 2Tbs regular cream cheese and heaping 1/4 c. Parmesan.  Followed assembly directions exactly. Finally, tasty and creamy cauliflower!

I don't like cauliflower in its natural state, but this is delicious! When cooking the garlic in the olive oil, I kept the cloves in their papers so the garlic wouldn't brown. I only had to allow them to cool a little so I could handle them.

Delicious! I had a really large head of cauliflower, in the end it made like 6 servings, maybe 7! I added 1 more clove of garlic and besides the reg EVOO, I used a teaspoon of garlic EVOO. I used my stick blender, after trying to use the processor. It was much easier and blended really fast! Will definitely make this again!

Made this last night for a dinner side.  Wasn't expecting much boy were we wrong.  Sooo good we even used less cream cheese and no parm as we are trying to cut back on fats and carbs and man it was still good.

Made this for dinner tonight, my husband was amazed and so glad that they were better for our diet than potatoes. The only difference was I picked up a package of boursin garlic & fine herbs gournay cheese so just used it with the cauliflower (nothing else!!)  So EASY that way.

Yum! I substituted cottage cheese for the cream cheese, delish! I had to process the cauliflower in smaller batches in my smaller processor, but then I was able to process it all together at the end. Very good, I will make this again!

I added 2T of Greek yogurt for a 'sour cream' flavor that I like in regular mashed taters. Be certain to process 1/2 of the cauliflower 1st, before adding additional florets and other ingredients to maintain texture. EZ to get too 'soupy' if everything processed at once

Loved it. I didn't follow the instructions about about adding one floret at a time, and it kinds got stuck. Lol. But, it was still delicious.

Cut back on the garlic a little per family's preferences. Have tried other recipes with many more additives but this is definitely our favorite. Will make again & will probably have in place if potatoes as often as possible.

Very good.  I used frozen cauliflower, and it wasn't soft in 10 min. So I put it in with oil, garlic until it was done.  Mashed it and used beater. Added a lrg dollop of sour cream  instead of cr cheese.  Great for low carb

This is a winner! I doubled the recipe and half I made shepherd pie and the other half I saved for later in the week. The shepherd pie turnout great with this mashed cauliflower - my husband really enjoyed! Later in the weekend we made baked fish and the mashed cauliflower was very tasty.

Although mine did not look as creamy, it still tasted great. I did add a little sharp cheddar and 1 T. of butter. I also topped it with chives. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I give it a 3 because the first time i did it i thought it was complicated but the second time i did it i simplified it and to me, it tasted the same. This is what i did the second time, I washed the cauliflower, cut it, put it into the pressure cooker for 10 mins. add the garlic and the rest of the ingredients and just mix everything with a spoon, as the cauliflower was soft everything got mashed together. no need for the food processor :)

I didn't have cream cheese so I used some 2% milk instead. I absolutely loved it. I wish it would be a tiny bit thicker .. it was a little bit watery but that must of been the milk I used . Next time I'll try the cream cheese. Regardless I still loved it and will def start making this more often ??

I make this all the time in lieu of mashed potatoes. I skip the garlic though. Perfect substitution and I actually prefer this over mashed pots. Great if  trying  to limit carbs.

Just made this tonight (my first time trying mashed cauliflower) and it was delicious!  One difference I made - I didn't have any cream cheese so instead I used 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I want to try it with cream cheese next time, but it was fantastic.  Two thumbs up!

I roasted the cauliflower as per tips provided in previous reviews but as I was processing, it looked really dry.  Luckily I have a Vitamix that was able to process the cauliflower to a velvety soft consistency.  Unfortunately, it was a little too soft but still delicious with my pot roast.  Next time, I will steam the cauliflower as instructed making sure not to let the steaming water come into contact with the cauliflower.

I just made this, roasting the cauliflower with a few flowerets of broccoli that I had to use. It came out delicious, but after roasting, there were some brown flecks in it. I'd never be able to pass it off as mashed potato, but it is very good, all the same. At one reviewer's suggestion that it's best very warm, I used some as a ring around an egg for my breakfast, a la "toad in a hole", and it was very good. It may be a smidge on the garlicky side for a breakfast, but it will be perfect alongside veggie burgers. It came out a little on the grainy side, so I might try my immersion blender on the leftovers to try and get them a bit smoother. All in all, I enjoyed this and will make it again.

I give this  five stars for a few reasons; 1-easy to prepare. I didn't expect these to have the same consistency as mashed potatoes nor did I want them too. So after boiling and adding sour cream I mashed them, then mixed them with my electric hand mixer. I omitted the butter (don't know why, I love butter) and didn't miss it!. The second reason I gave it five stars is because I couldn't stop eating it. Last but not least if I can replace a carb with a vegetable  and still feel like I've eaten a carb --I'm all for it.

It is good but didn't have much flavor.  I may have done something wrong or the cauliflower may not have been fresh ( days to one week old?) However, I will modify next time.  Steam,  not cook through in micro (lots easier).  Then quickly saute the garlic with salt, butter and herbs/seasonig.  Add the cauli and sautee. Follow the recipe as outlined.  I will let you know how it turns out.

I'm not much of a recipe cook so I didn't measure anything. I just added a good amount of cream cheese, butter, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, garlic, seasoned salt and pepper. The were delicious! My 10 yr. old son asked for more mashed potatoes ??.

This was so good I signed up for all recipes so that I could rate it! I had to use a regular blender for this which took a little more work but it still turned out so good. Because of the blender issue I had to add a tiny splash of milk to get it moving but still came out perfect. I will be making this again and again!

First time I ever had mashed cauliflower and I loved it. The consistency was like mashed potatoes and it tasted great! 

Will definitely make again.

This will be my new go to alternative to mashed potatoes. I omitted the olive oil and fresh garlic for 1 tsp of garlic powder,  and used 1 tsp of chicken bouillon instead of salt. I ended up adding some salt in the end. It does cool down after being processed and I microwaved it to warm it. The consistency was great. My cauliflower was firm after it steamed. I steamed the head, then cut it into four pieces before putting it in the processor. I'm on weight watchers and it was only 2 points for 4 large servings.

I followed another cook"s suggestion and roasted  the cauliflower in the oven with  butter, garlic salt, and olive oil. I forgot about the garlic.  This was really delicious and I plan to cut down on my carbs with the recipe at least once a week.  Thank you!

The flavor was really good but the texture was almost slimy creamy. It was definitely strange and noticeable. However, the whole family ate it but didn't finish off the bowl like with traditional mashed potatoes. I may try cooking the cauliflower for a shorter time and see if that changes it. It is a much healthier alternative to mashed potatoes so I would like to make it work.

these are really good and so close to mashed potatoes both in taste and appearance.  I admit I was skeptical.  I didn't steam then on stove but steamed them in the micro til they were quite tender without being mushy.  couldn't believe my eyes when I opened the food processor.  I did add just a tad more cream cheese out of preference and that hint of garlic was wonderful adding another level of flavor; yet didn't overpower the dish.  I tasted them before i added the parmesan.  I like them both ways but honestly could do them without the parm and they would be very good as well.  thanks so much for this!  perfect served with ham.

Delicious! I bought  a bag of steamable cauliflower crumbles instead, but  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My husband, who loves mashed potatoes and hates vegetables, couldn't eat it as a replacement for the real thing, but he said it was tasty.  My kids loved it, too! I'm  on a low carb diet so this really hit the spot!

We loved this! I hate mashed potatoes (hubby loves them) but we both loved this. 3yo hated, said it tasted like potatoes which she hates in all but "tot" form (she likes cauliflower tho). Anyway - I used the pre-crumbled cauli pearls (spoiler alert $5 for 5 cups & it's mostly stems but IDC) - omitted the garlic/oil & used garlic salt for the salt. If yours is bland add more salt or a splash of soy sauce or Worcestershire for that umami taste that cheese adds. (Or more cheese.) This is 100% a make-again, thanks!

I made this...hoping for it to be good, but it was awful. None of my family liked it, it was dumped :( I don't like cauliflower, so I was hoping it would be good, since I read a bunch of reviewers liked it who didn't like cauliflower. Oh well, not for me!

This was great !
A couple notes I wanted to share with others who haven't tried it yet.
1) if you're using canned, minced garlic, don't use too much.. it can be overpowering. 
2) if you have to choose between using a regular food processor and a Ninja, use the processor. There's just enough difference between the two that using a Ninja without additional water is fairly difficult. If you are using a Ninja, you'll need to stop a few times to push the unprocessed florets and cheese down into the mash. 
3) I added about 2 tbsp of butter, because everything is better with butter ;-)

Delicious.  It's the first time I've tried cauliflower mash and we both loved it.  I used my hand blender simply for ease and it worked really well.  Other than that, I stayed with the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

This was awesome! I didn't have parmesan so I used Asiago I also omitted the oil and just put the raw garlic in the bowl with the rest. So very good! I used an emulsifying blender and it worked great.

I've made this recipe 5-6 times now. My wife and I try to stay away from high glycemic vegetables. As such we often substitute this for mash potatoes.  I've tried cooking the cauliflower in water & tried steaming them.  I could never get them soft enough so that the cauliflower would turn creamy.  Then I tried pressure cooking the cauliflower.  You WANT to cook the cauliflower way past the any crispness or firmness.  I've cooked the cauliflower this way In a standard stove top pressure cooker and an InstaPot (Electric pressure cooker).  The cauliflower comes out SOFT after 3-4 minutes.  I just then add the spices and cream cheese (I use granulated garlic rather than sautéing one clove of garlic.) and then use an immersion blender right in the pressure cooker pot (make sure you drain the cauliflower really well or  it can be a tad too loose.) .  It's REALLY faster

This was really good.   

I cooked 2 very large cauliflowers in my steamer, and increased the other ingredients accordingly.

 I sautéed the garlic in a large pot then added the steamed cauliflower to the pot and sautéed to "dry it off".  

Initially I tried to puree with my immersion blender, but it was not effective.  I ended up pureeing in batches in my food processor. 

Excellent low carb substitute for potatoes .

Great recipe and easy. I liked it as is, but my husband and son didn't care for the garlic. Next time I'll just leave it out even though garlic is really good for you.

I was shocked how delicious this was. I'm the only one in our family that likes cauliflower but when I gave a taste to the others, they actually liked it. I added extra garlic and used regular cream cheese and you could barely taste the cauliflower.  It has amazing creamy texture just like mashed potatoes.

Amazing. I've never had mashed cauliflower and thought I'd give this a try.  I think it's better than mashed potatoes! I used it as a bed for an herbed, baked salmon. Even my four-year-old who doesn't want to eat anything ate it!

Love this recipe. I've made it several times and its always delicious.  Left the garlic out the last because a friend had an allergy and it still tasted fantastic. Best of all it's so easy. I live on an RV so I don't have lots of space for fancy gadgets like a food processor.  I used my immersion blender and they were perfectly creamy.

I think these are just as yummy as mashed potatoes and tastes very similar!  Could easily have fooled son and husband if I wanted too lol...    Mine came out slightly thin and I probably don't need the full amount of Parmesan cheese.  Will try it again,  though.

This is the best recipe for cauliflower mash I have come across!  The cream cheese really makes all the difference.  I've tried recipes with heavy cream and while good they don't have the lovely flavor and texture that this one does.  The garlic and parm give it a great flavor that I love.  I didn't think it needed any more salt,  parm is a salty cheese and with that and the salt it was perfection. I let it roll for quite a while in my food processor and the consistency was perfect. If you don't have one I would suggest a blender and it really needs to be blended a lot to get it to the mashed consistency.  
Thank you so much for this recipe!  It's a keeper!

Steamed the cauliflower using a metal colander and pot and it worked just fine! Followed recipe exactly and I loved it! Tastes just like garlic mashed potatoes to me! I agree with another reviewer that you will want to warm up the "potatoes" after you remove them from the food processor.

I loved this recipe since I'm trying to stick to a low carb Atkins diet. I had to tweak it a bit. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of cream cheese, I also added a 2 tbsp of butter and a splash of milk. My kids thought it was actually mashed potatoes! Yummy!

GREAT RECIPE! This turned out really well - my wife won't touch cauliflower but she loved these "potatoes". Like others always do, I tweaked it a bit - I microwaved two *very small* idaho potatoes (fit in palm) and added them to the cauliflower in the food processor just to lend some authenticity to the 'mashed potatoes'. Left all else the same - turned out great - wonderful texture and flavor. Thank you very much for this recipe!!!

Loved this recipe.  The only problem I had was that I don't have a food processor and had to use my Ninja instead.  I would recommend removing the first batch of cauliflower and then puree the second batch.  I also put the cauliflower mixture into a baking dish and warmed it in my toaster oven.

Mom is severely diabetic so I've been looking for a low-carb substitute for mashed potatoes. She loved this!  We're also trying to up her calories, so I used regular cream cheese and used 2 tbsp. instead of one. I also topped the finished dish off with  a pat of butter. The consistency is a little thin, but still yummy. I might try roasting the cauliflower next time to cut down on the water content. Definitely a keeper.

I added cream cheese, parmesan and salt to taste (more than called for).  I believe this improved the taste and consistency.  I would make again.

I have made mashed cauliflower many times before but this recipe is by far the best! In the past I have had issues with the dish being watery but followed the suggestion provided to soak the vegetable first and it worked great. It is wonderful to have such a tasty dish that is good for you too!

When I'm done putting the whole thing in the food processor I put the mixture in a small pan and put it in the oven preheated at 350 for 5-10 minutes. This seems to help thicken everything up and adds some more texture to it

Amazing! This was my first time making mash cauliflower and was a great success! I would maybe omit the garlic and perhaps use a low fat flavoured cream cheese but otherwise wouldn't change a thing!

I have never made mashed cauliflower before and I was worried about how it would taste.  This recipe is amazing & they were delicious!  I used regular cream cheese instead of fat free, but followed the recipe otherwise.  They were smooth, creamy and not runny at all.  I will be making these again very soon.

I added an onion and sliced portobello mushrooms to the pork and liquids.  It was so flavorful!!!  I used mashed cauliflower as my side dish and the whole meal was a huge hit!!!  I put it on high for 4 hours and it was falling apart and so very tender!!!!  Great recipe!!!!

Delicious! My family loved it - my husband got a large portion of second helpings and my sister (a very picky eater) even loved them. This is definitely going to be a staple in our household.

I made this tonight and I just can't get past the fact that it doesn't taste anything like potatoes. Yes, it's healthier but no substitute for potatoes for me.   Didn't have cream cheese so I added a bit of half and half and sour cream and sautéed the cauliflower in olive oil and garlic before steaming it. While mashing, I added salt, pepper and parmasean cheese to it.

Simply fabulous!  I had a large head of cauliflower, so I upped the garlic to three cloves, and also added some extra parmesan cheese and used a half a package of cream cheese instead of the suggested one TBSP, which seemed scrimpy.
Perhaps a bit more caloric, but so amazing, it's hard to imagine eating cauliflower any other way!!  I will absolutely be making this recipe again, and again, and again!

Roasted cauliflower in oven as suggested, coated with Good Seasons Italian salad dressing.  Added another 2T cream cheese and it was still a little dry.  Sorry I didn't make it exactly as directed - I know that isn't a fair representation, but I wanted to thank those who contributed to a great recipe to play around with.!  Reheating on stove was a great idea, too.  Next time I'll add butter when reheating.

We loved this with our steak and asparagus! A super yummy way to cut some calories.  The only change I made was instead of one clove of garlic, I used 3.  (Can never have enough garlic in this household)

I used regular organic cream cheese & seasoned with Spike seasoning as this contains wonderful herbs. I also never use olive oil for cooking as olive oil should really not be heated as benefits are lost. I used macadamia nut oil. 
Mash was absolutely delicious, even tasted better than mashed potatoes!  I plan on making this a staple in my home.

I don't like low fat or fat free cream cheese.  I didn't add garlic because I didn't want a strong garlic flavor, so instead I used Laughing Cow creamy Swiss garlic and herb cheese wedges. I'm dieting so I only used one wedge for one head of cauliflower, but I think two or three wedges would make it more yummy. I added salt and pepper and it was delicious!

For anyone finding this too runny, the cauliflower needs to be dried after cooking. Just pour the cooked cauliflower out onto a folded paper towel and place another folded piece on top and push gently to remove the extra water. Hope this helps.

The only thing I did different is boil the cauliflower with rosemary to add flavor. Other then that this recipe is perfect the texture is so light and compared to mashed potatoes I like this better! I highly recommend this to anyone looking to cut calories and have a guilt free side dish!

Did not have the cream cheese, but did have some tofu for another recipe so I used that instead.   My husband who is just ok with cauliflower really liked it.  Next time I'll try it with the cream cheese and it could climb to 5 stars!

Just made this and loved it! My husband and 3 kids (ages 7,9,11) also "liked it" and didn't know that it wasn't mashed potatoes.  I will definitely be making this again!!

Oh my goodness!!! Love it. Very easy to make. I can taste the garlic a good bit, so next time I'll just go with less. But it's very creamy and the hubby loved it. 

Thank your for this recipe.

I love this recipe!!!! I've made it 3 times now (even with the price of cauliflower at $8) and it was AMAZING everytime.   I sometimes add onion powder, leave out the parm cheese, extra garlic, add Greek yogurt, or really thick sour cream.  It's so good I'll eat the whole thing by myself.

I made it for Thanksgiving, instead of potatoes.  To make it a little more starchy I added 1 potato.  It turned out great.  My husband didn't like it much , but everyone else liked them.

I made it with 2 -3 tablespoons of cream cheese and 4 cloves of garlic. Next time I will use 2 cloves of garlic as the garlic flavor was a little too strong. I think 1/4 cup of parmasean is plenty. I made  it in my Vitamix and the consistency was creamy and perfect. It is full of flavor and I will most definately make it again!

This recipe was outrageously good!!  The only changes I made and only because I love garlic and cheese, is I used 4 garlic cloves and a 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  They came out so rich and creamy, I will be substituting this for mashed potatoes for many times to come. Thank you for sharing your recipe, BRAVO!!

I am not a cauliflower fan and loved this.  I did make a couple of tweaks...  2 oz of herb and garlic goat cheese instead of the cream cheese. I added a tablespoon of butter for flavor and I also added some sautéed onions.  Amazing!

Delicious! I used 2 Tbls. Real cream cheese. Skipped food processor completely. Put steamed cauliflower (all of it) in bowl, added everything else and used my stick blender. Super easy.super delicious, I will never make plain ole' white mashed taters again.

Modified the recipe a bit to fit in to my current eating plan..
Steamed the cauliflower in my microwave steamer pot, drained it, into the food processor, added fat free cream cheese, 1 tbsp. fat free sour cream, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Old Bay seasoning.
Left out the Parmesean cheese as well as the oil.  
My husband and I both really enjoyed it.  Would certainly make this recipe again.  
Thumbs up!

It was pretty good. Definitely a better option than mashed potatoes if you're counting carbs. The flavour and consistency was identical to the potatoes I usually make but the texture wasn't quite the same. It wasn't as smooth. I might try cooking it longer next time. That might help the texture.

I added a parsnip...it gives it just a little more flavor.  Even if you don't care for parsnips, it will make this recipe one of your favorites.  I also used full fat cream cheese.

I've been seeking the best 'mashed' cauliflower recipe. This is it! I did use 2 cloves of garlic and some fresh chives. The secret is the steaming, drying between paper towels and using food processor. Yum!

I love it!!! I'm looking for low carb recipes to control my Diabetis. It was a bit more softer than a regular mashed potato but I still feel that it's a wonderful substitute. I did use vegan cream cheese and the taste was still yummy.

Excellent!  Substituted a few things onions instead of garlic, butter instead of olive oil, and Monterrey Jack instead of the other two cheeses.  Threw it in the blender (make sure you cut the pieces up kind of small first) and it was done super quick.  Toddler loved it too!

This was a great way to use some cauliflower! The flavor was great and overall the consistency was about what I expected but it could have been a little thicker. This is one recipe that I will definitely be making again.

It's a good thing I like cauliflower, because this did not represent mashed potatoes no matter what I added. Taste has a lot to do with texture, and this was never the consistency or texture of potatoes

I made this today, a little disappointed  in the amount it made but after thinking about it, it makes sense. definitely could pass for mashed potatoes!  I used my tall mug Nutritionals Bullet and it mixed it in seconds.  I will go ahead and put it all in together at once as the Nutritionals Bullet is so fast the half cauliflower ended up on the sides. great recipe,!

To save time, I get the fresh cauliflower in florets and steam in bags.
Instead of Cream Cheese, I use Neufchatel cheese - just preference. I use fresh parmesan and grate it myself and add a pinch more black pepper. Easy and wonderful!

This was amazing! My husband and two girls who hate veggies ate it! I didn't have any cream cheese, so I substituted 1/2 Cup Daisy light Sour Cream. I also added 1 tbsp butter and 3/4 cup of 2% milk to make it creamier!

OMG!!  This recipe is AWESOME!  I made it exactly as the recipe indicated, except after I had spooned it out of the food processor into the serving bowl I realized I had forgotten to add the garlic.  I tasted it and it didn't need the garlic.  It was fantastic as it was and I served it just that way.  Huge hit!  I will definitely make this again (not sure yet whether I will even mess with the garlic next time)!!!!

I don't own a steamer, so I rubbed olive oil on the cauliflower and sprinkled with salt and pepper and roasted at 450 about 20 minutes until somewhat softened. I then put in the blender and followed the recipe as is. Tasted great. Will definitely be substituting this for mashed potatoes to eat healthier. I will try a steamer next time.

This dish was delicious. I also used fat free sour cream instead of the cream cheese. It was so creamy and a great substitute for mashed potatoes minus the carbs. Will make this again for sure.

I followed the recipe to the letter until the end. I added some cheddar cheese, about 1/4 cup, into the food processor and then put the whole thing in a casserole topped it with more cheddar cheese, some bacon bits and chopped green onions, heated it at 350 for about 15 mins then broiled it till the top looked slightly browned. Delish.

I loved this recipe! Steaming is a must if you are making it in a blender. You also need to add milk as needed to make it wet enough to blend. Throw it in a sauce pan over medium heat for a few minutes while stirring to serve it hot. So much better!

Super creamy mashed cauliflower! This recipe was fast, easy, and had the best consistency of any other mashed cauliflower recipe ever tried before - could have something to do with using my Ninja instead of my ratty, old food processor, but either way, they were good.

I am sooooo excited about this recipe!  Made it with one Laughing Cow cheese wedge instead of cream cheese, but otherwise as written.  I can now satisfy my cravings for mashed potatoes without feeling guilty!  Will be making on the regular, no doubt. Oh, and my immersion blender worked great; the "potatoes" were the perfect, creamy consistency.

I'm always a little annoyed when people post reviews and don't follow the recipe exactly, but I did that tonight. ?? Steamed the garlic with the cauliflower rather than sautéing separately and then added the olive oil with the cheese at the end. It was perfect! I'll definitely be making this again! (Okay, I also added one slice of bacon cooked and crumbled). Still a great base recipe!

This was my first time trying Cauliflower Mashed. I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't follow the recipe to the letter kinda improvised on the measurements but it turned out okay. Different taste but okay. I'll try again to follow the directions next time.

This is the best mashed cauliflower recipe I've tried (and I've tried a few).  I'm convinced it is due to the steaming, instead of boiling.  So yummy!

Really tasty as is, I changed mine up a little  the second time I made it. Substituted sour cream for the cream cheese and gave it a healthy dollop of horseradish to give it a little zing

I wasn't expecting this to taste exactly like mashed potatoes, but this recipe was lackluster. The consistency was amazing though, steaming the cauliflower really is genius. The seasoning needs work though.

Tried this as a healthy alternative to mashed potatoes and we loved it!  I steamed my garlic in whole cloves along with the cauliflower.  Instead of the food processor, I just used a masher and then beaters with a spatula to cream.  I did add a little more pepper and a dash of garlic salt to our tastes.  Definitely worth making again!

YUM!!!  Let's be honest, there's nothing better than mashed potatoes, but when you're trying to cut calories and prepare a more healthy meal/side dish...MAKE THIS RECIPE!!  Cauliflower is good, but it's not my most fav veggie...however I am now team cauliflower! The final dish is so flavorful and creamy! My family does like garlic (a lot) so I did use a few more garlic cloves than the recipe called for.  And my food processor is on the smaller side, so I blended in batches & then mixed the batches together to combine. All in all this WILL be added to future meal planning!!

We did not like it at all. Probably not the recipes fault just the idea of mashed cauliflower. No one ate it. Next time we will enjoy it raw or roasted. This is in NO WAY a replacement for mashed potatoes.

I don't like cauliflower, but this recipe was very good. I love mashed potatoes. This is an awesome substitute. I roasted the cauliflower in the oven with garlic. I also used about 2 tablespoons of buttermilk. I will make this again!

This really was pretty easy, and it was a big hit. I used 2 bags of Bird's Eye microwave steamers garlic cauliflower along with all of the other ingredients. I used a little bit more cream cheese, since 2 bags is a little more cauliflower than the recipe calls for. My CuisinArt sometimes gives me trouble, but the cauliflower pureed well. Overall, easy side, came out tasting great. I refrigerated it right away and microwaved it when it was time to serve and there was no loss of taste or texture.

I had tried mashed cauliflower before but didn't care for it  I am glad I decided to try this recipe. I think steaming is the key plus cream cheese and Parmesan giving it a good flavor. I didn't use the garlic because my husband doesn't like it. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Fantastic recipe for mashed cauliflower!  I used a wedge of Laughing Cow cheese instead of cream cheese.  This is a keeper.

I love mashed potatoes and I'd heard about this recipe.  Wow, was I pleased with the results.  This one will go to the top of my recipe file. I can see all kinds of possibilities with this recipe.

made these according to the recipe and they were super.  I put them in the food processor and they got very creamy just like mashed potatoes.

Ahhhmazing!  I followed the recipe to a T, except I used garlic paste instead of sauteing the garlic, and tossed in a few finely chopped green onions because I had some left over from another dish. Thanks, Angie!

Made this tonight and the consistency was perfect however the flavor wasn't quite there. I still give it 4 stars because I did skimp the measurement on the salt and used 2 cloves of garlic instead, so that could be my fault but the mash potatoes texture was definitely there vs other recipes I've tried. It definitely has potential to have the taste. Darn salt! Everytime... Ha

I did double the cream cheese and added a scoop of cottage cheese (cause I had it on hand) + 2-4 Tbsp of water to loose it up but a huge hit in my household! They had a wonderful creamy consistency. Next time I am going to go for more of a traditional mashed potato recipe and see if it can fool some others

Excellent flavor. I did amend the recipe a little. Used about twice the cream cheese (low fat) and used fresh grated Romano cheese instead of parmesan. Almost identical to garlic mashed potatoes!

This turned out very tasty, excellent mash potato replacement! However, the garlic was kind of overpowering in my opinion. Next time I'll add half a garlic clove instead of a whole.

Awesome recipe!  The only substitution I made was sour cream for the cream cheese and only because I didn't have any on hand. The sour cream actually worked out really well, I was pleasantly surprised. I made this to accompany turkey meatloaf and cranberry sauce, both recipes from Allrecipes. I will keep this recipe in my dinner rotation for sure, my husband loved it too. Thank you for sharing!

This was surprisingly very good. I like I a lot more than mashed potatoes. Great flavor and very light. 
The only thing I did different was steam the cauliflower for about 10 mins. Didn't want to loose the nutrients to the water. 
Yum!

Some simple tips to make these perfect! Make sure to put all the ingredients, except the cauliflower, in the blender first. This way you can control the consistency of the cauliflower. I like mine a little chunky and less runny, so as to more resemble potatoes. 
Recently made this and was out of parmesan so we used Cotija Mexican cheese instead. This was definitely salty enough to do the trick, and turned out really yummy. 
Also add some rosemary!! Love this recipe and will make it a new rotation in the dinner menu. Thanks

I purchased the mirowave bagged cauliflower florets at my local grocer.  I used two bags.  Cooked for 5 min each.  Minced garlic from a jar.  Don't have a processor, used the emersion mixer like another reviewer suggested.  Two of us ate both bags! I served this with Chef John's Cocoa Cherry Pork. This was a "knock your socks off" meal.

I just bought my first food processor ever and this was the first recipe I tried with it. This was awesome. Only change was I subbed whipped cream cheese for the regular as that is all I had. Since it was whipped, I used 2 Tablespoons instead of the one. The mixture did cool a bit more than I would have liked, but that is to be expected. Will definitely make again!!

Using suggestion by Ladyl46 on Feb. 15, 2013 instead of steaming, I broiled the cauliflower until lightly browned.  Tasted great.

I've never been a big fan of cauliflower but this dish is delicious. Hubby enjoyed it as well, so will definitely be serving this on a routine basis. Thank you!

First time to try mashed cauliflower. What a surprise. I never thought cauliflower can taste so exceptional.

This was fabulous. I was looking for a healthy recipe to substitute high carb mashed potatoes.   This is not it because it was too good I ate almost the entire dish. Only difference I did was I sautéed prepared minced garlic in a little  butter. I might of used a little too much that I will adjust next time.

Very easy to make and very tasty, the whole family liked it, husband and kids, and I made regular mashed potatoes for the rest of my family and they ate both till completely gone. Thanks for the recipe, will be making this alot.  Didn't change or alter recipe at all.
