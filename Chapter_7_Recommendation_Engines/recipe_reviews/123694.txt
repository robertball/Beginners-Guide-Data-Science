Oh my goodness, this is great bread!!! I had it for breakfast with my husband and we both agreed that it was absolutely the best sweet bread we had ever tasted! The only thing I changed was adding a little coconut to the filling because it goes very well with the rest of the ingredients. This is a recipe that I very highly recommend to anyone! Even without the coconut, I'm sure it would be very good. Thank you!

Came together beautifully--I used walnuts in place of pecans and worked perfect. Also, I found about 5 cups of flour is needed to make it the right consistency.

This recipe is awesome.  This was my first experience with yeast and it turned out perfect.  I double the amount of filling inside...also, I chop a combo of slivered almonds, walnuts, and pecans to sprinkle on top.  It is so so so delicious and makes for a very impressive presentation :)

This dough is the most tender and softest dough I have worked with to date.  You may be tempted to add additional flour when making this but please don’t.  The finished product has a fabulously light and delicate texture that you will not achieve with the additional flour.  Normally when I make sweet rolls I spread the softened butter on the dough simply because it’s neater.  However, this dough is so soft and tender, when I make it again I will melt the butter and spread it on the dough, then sprinkle the brown sugar and chopped pecans.  Also, this makes a very large loaf so I may make two loaves the next time and freeze one or give one away.  But having said that, if I wanted an impressive sweet bread to bring to a gathering this is perfect and everyone will love it.  I didn’t bother with the recipe’s icing because I thought it would make it sweeter than I wanted, so I just made a simple confectioner’s icing to drizzle which worked well for us.   This is a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This tasted like a combination: of a caramel nut roll, a coffee cake, and sweet bread. It was actually a very intersting combination. With that being said, the shape is a little hard to work with because it is GIANT! I would definitely consider this something for a special occasion. It is time consuming. plus, it is really sweet and rich. I agree with Deb C that the cake/bread part is sweet enough on its own. "A very light glaze is all that is needed." I believe that would have made it perfect because the braided part is actually really good! It didn't need the heavy icing. The only change I made was subtituting walnuts for pecans for personal preference. I am saving some for home, some is going to an office, and I am freezing the rest for company. It really is that large!

I truly enjoyed this. Easy to make, and not as sweet as some expected.  I thought it tasted like a pastry.

I got this recipe out of Country Woman Christmas back in 1997.  I thought the bread was so good that I added my own twist of adding apples inside and I made them as Christmas gifts.  It's a little tricky braiding the bread but it comes out so delicious.  The loaves are huge.

Excellent braid, next time I am going to add more of the filling.  Just didn't seem like there was enough, other than that, PERFECT! (and easy!)
