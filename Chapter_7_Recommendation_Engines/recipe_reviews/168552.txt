These were a little difficult. The sour cream made the batter a little thick which made the whipped egg whites hard to encorporate without overmixing. If I'd let the sour cream sit out for a half hour, I think I would have had an easier time of it. Other than that, the taste of these waffles were great. Different from your typical sweet waffle. I used my Rhubarb-Pineapple Freezer Jam on these and it was a nice counterbalance for the sour cream background. I'd like to try these again, after leaving out the sour cream and see if I can't make them even better next time.

My husband said these were the best waffles he has ever had. I didn't have white sugar so I substituted dark brown, they were excellent!!!

New to cooking, but the batter was so thick it was like glue. The egg whites helped. Was good but a little too hard and solid of a waffle to us.
