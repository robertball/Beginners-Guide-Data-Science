These are easy and tasty--pretty typical zucchini bar. They are moist and sweet, so I didn't add frosting, although if I were sharing them as a dessert, I would add a simple frosting. I used a glass pan and mine took 40 minutes to bake completely. Also, I used a combo of zucchini and yellow squash.
