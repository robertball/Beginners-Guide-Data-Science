This was very good.   We aren't huge fans of processed cheese, but it didn't bother us in this recipe.   The jalape√±o and sour cream were a great addition.   We finished it immediately.

This dip is awesome. It is always a hit at our tailgating events. 
I make it as written except I use ground elk.  It is delicious.
