With a few adjustments, this is an excellent recipe.  Instead of the spices, I just pour in some taco seasoning.  I also omit the tomato paste entirely (I don't keep paste in the house).

I add a can of black beans and 1/2 can of corn, also.

With those changes, this is an excellent casserole and it has become one of our staples - I make it and we eat it for lunches for the week.

Excellent recipe!! In the meat mixture, I added a can (14.5oz) of cut peeled tomatos and a can (4.5oz) chopped green chiles.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone. Tasty and easy. Ps- I used the flour tortillas but cooked about 5 mins less than required and then let sit for 5 min before serving.  YUMMY.

Great meal- I added corn, black beans, and diced green chiles.  I served it with sour cream and salsa on the side.  Whole family loved it!

This was quick, easy, and good!  I made a few additions based on other reviews and personal preferences.  I added 1 can of corn and some left over black beans (drained).  I would use a whole can of the black beans next time, I was just using up what I had on hand.  In place of the spices called for I just added a package of taco seasoning mix.  I also only used 1 can of tomato sauce and omitted the tomato paste.  My husband is vary wary of anything called a "casserole", but he liked it too.  He even asked for the recipe to take to the fire station this morning and cook for the guys because it was tasty and economical.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe had a great flavor but tonight we are substituting corn tortillas for the 
flour.  Last time I made it, the tortillas turned in to big wads of dough and my husband was
not very pleased.  Believe it or not, he called today and asked me to make it again, only
with corn tortillas!   We'll see how it goes!!

My husband didn't even eat half of his plate with this one.  I thought it sounded good, but the final product needed some help big time.  Either mushrooms, olives, something with some texture.

I thought this had a bit too much tomato sauce and not enough tortillas.  If I made it again, I would use less sauce, more tortillas, more cumin & more cheese.

This was extremely fast and easy to make....makes light work of cooking a noutritious meal.  I added fresh chopped tomatos and sour cream, and next time, will make it with corn tortillas instead of flour.  The flour seemed to get really mushy and tasteless.  Otherwise a very good meal

We absolutely love this recipe!  I have made it for my parents, my in-laws, neighbors, friends, and everyone absolutely loves it.  I have never deviated from the recipe and it turns out perfectly every time!  I actually think it is more like a "mexican lasagna", instead of a casserole.  Yummy!

Great base recipe I could bend to make both healthier and to suit our family. I used ground turkey, homemade taco seasoning instead of plain cumin and chili powder and I used 2% sharp cheddar cheese. I did not need the tomato paste but I did use organic tomato sauce. Just under one pound of ground turkey was enough for one "casserole". I wish I'd thought of this before. WAY simpler than making a whole pan of enchiladas and the whole family thought that the whole "taco pie" idea was pretty slick. I served each portion with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and a small dollop of homemade casa dressing as well as homemade mexican rice and refried beans. This meal was quite economical and filling which I appreciate having three men at my table.

I didn't add any fresh veggies on top, like lettuce and tomato, which it seemed to need.  Not sure if I'll try this one again, but the kids loves it.

Recipe was worth trying, but was too tomato-y for my family's taste.  It was very easy to prepare, though.

This was ok. Made exactly as written.  It does go together very quickly, I almost rated it a 4 due to that alone.  I read some of the other reviews and would try it again with taco seasoning and corn tortillas.  Thanks!

I liked this.  I had corn tortillas in the pantry, so I used them.  Other reviews had suggested corn and it works!

O.k., I changed it a bit:  add 1 can diced tomatos, 1 small can diced chili peppers (mild), 1 can beef broth and simmer at the end to reduce back to meatier consistency.  Double the spices (trust), add black pepper to taste. I also used corn tortillas instead, softened in oil for just a second or two and I used more cheese.  Yummy!!  I will definately make this again and soon!

This was not bad. It was a little bland for my taste so I would want to make some adjustments. But it is a good idea for a meal and a good starting place.

Very good and couldn't be easier. I too used corn tortillas (what I had on hand) and subbed chili-ready diced tomatoes for tomato paste to make it a little juicier. Will make again!

Tasty and easy!! This is a great comfort-food recipe. I substituted corn tortilla chips for the tortillas, so that I ended up with a nice, mushy chilaquile-like effect. It was great topped with plain yogurt, and next time I'll add chopped jalapenos as well. Pair it with a salad or some rice, and you've got a meal :-)

I made this night before last. It was good, but I feel that the amount of cumin should be 2 tsp and the chill powder should be 1 tsp. I found it tasted more like chill rather than Mexican. We will have this dish again, as my Husband devoured it, but I will reverse the two seasonings. Thank you so much, for a new dinner recipe. Anything new is wonderful.

this was delicious.  i made it at the last minute and it turned out great.  i used 1.5 lbs ground beef and only 2 tortillas, since i was only cooking for 2.  i also didn't have any chili powder on hand so i substituted some cayenne, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, and more cumin instead.  my husband raved about it and i will definitely be making it again!

This was a tasty recipe when the enchiladas were fresh out of the oven. However, they got soggy after being in the fridge overnight. I would use regular shredded cheese on the enchiladas to allow for less sogginess.

I really didn't like this recipe. I even tried it a couple times to make some variations to see if it would get better... but it just didn't. The cumin gave it a strange sweet taste and no matter what I did, the flour tortillas turned a very gross soggy texture! The only thing that made it edible to me, was  eating it with some salsa on top.

I love this recipe.  I made it a few years ago, but now that our family has grown by two more mouths, I needed a larger dish to feed them all.

I used 2 lb. of beef, upped the spices by a teaspoon or so, but kept the tomato paste and sauce at the original amounts -- that helped to cut down on the very tomato-y taste.

I also added a  layer of corn, a layer of black beans and some chili peppers.  I used twice as many tortillas and layer two at a time, side by side in a 9x13 dish.

It was fantastic -- all my kids ate it up!

I used enchilada sauce in place of tomato paste, as recommended by another reviewer,  and this one was outstanding.

I made a couple changes.  Ground turkey, and I threw in a can of black beans and diced tomatoes with chiles.  I used canned enchilada sauce instead of tomato paste and spices.  I thought it came out great.  The tortillas seemed to get soggy, but you hardly noticed with the cheese.  I will make again.

The tomato paste overpowered this recipe.  I will try it again but use a little different variation the next time.  Maybe diced tomatos and taco seasoning would help.  My husband disliked it but my son seemed to have enjoyed it.  Loved the idea but the tomato sauce/paste was just too much.

My 3 guys LOVED this recipe.  I substituted a package of taco seasoning for the cumin and chili powder.  It gave it just the right spice. Serve with sour cream, shredded lettuce and salsa. Very tasty. I'll be making this often.

Excellent.  But I confess, I made a small change.  I used the exact ingredients, but instead of layering, I put a bit on each tortilla and rolled up leaving the ends open.  Put in baking dish and poured Mrs Espy's Enchillada sauce over it (recipe for sauce on this site) and it was EXCELLENT.  Will make over and over again.  Thank you.

This was tasty and pretty easy to put together.  We also added black olives as we layered it.  I might try adding a few more spices next time but other than that, it's a keeper!

This is a great recipe even though it is very high in fat grams.  My daughter loved it and I served my husband's with marinated hot peppers on the side as he likes his Mexican food with more KICK.  Very easy and very good!

My sons and I loved this. I only had flour tortillas on hand and reading the other reviews about them getting soggy, I decided to heat them in the oven while cooking the meat in the skillet. This worked out perfectly as they had a harder texture and didn't get soggy in the final product. I also added a can of black beans, used taco seasoning and omitted the tomato paste as suggested. My sons went back for seconds!! (one of them is only 4 and is my super picky eater)

I only used 2 flour tortillas which did not turn soggy at all. Also used 1 lb ground beef making 2 beef mix layers and then did a center layer of black beans. Used a packet of taco seasoning in lieu of spices. Even my somewhat picky toddler ate this! Topped with sour cream and green onions.

I really changed this recipe to how I make this dish.This is a good recipe only I changed quite a bit. I used a mild enchilada sauce Never tomato sauce or tomato paste,(It's like oranges and apples) and I have never used flour tortillas for enchiladas, only corn tortillas. On the side I always have pinto beans (never black beans) and rice Mexican style I dip the tortillas in enchilada sauce before I add to casserole, sometimes heating them up on the stove over a flame first, also adding sliced black olives inside the tortilla and on top then the cheese

I guess I was hoping for the 5 star experience that others were writing about.  I did do the suggestions of the corn and black beans, corn tortillas and taco seasoning, so my judgment is based on these modifications.  It was good, but not "WOW!  Can't wait to make that again!" good.  Maybe the original version is better?

This was amazing!! I did it a bit different though...I only used 1 lb of hamburger, which worked out fine. I also used a can of black beans and some corn and I put a layer of tortillas on the bottom of the pan. I also used mozzarella cheese, because that's what I had. This was phenomenol! Everyone from my 14 month old daughter to my 48 year old mom liked it! :)

This recipe is a great basic enchilada casserole!  I'm only giving it a 4 since I didn't actually follow the recipe!  But I hope to try it as-is soon.  I had leftover shredded pork and corn tortillas so I used those two main ingredients, then added other ingredients to suite our tastes:  rice, Ro-tel, black beans, taco seasoning, and enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I actually made two dishes to freeze b/c we were sick of eating pork!  Anyway, just cooked one up last night and the family loved it!  I was afraid too b/c I'm not usually too good at wingin' it with a recipe!

This was to die for. My trick is that I use meatloaf mix (lamb, pork and lamb) for these casseroles, and that gave it a nice touch. I didn't feel the cumin much but that was not a problem. As most reviews say, it does taste a lot like tomatoes, but that is because it is an enchilada dish :) Everybody loved it. Maybe next time I'll use ground turkey.

This was quick and easy, but taste was only okay for me.  As others did, I used corn tortillas and added corn.  It was still missing something though.  I'll try it again, but I think I'll add chilis, diced tomatoes or beans.

I agree with forbees, substitute corn tortillas and use enchilada sauce.You'll get a much better flavor when you use corn tortillas.

I enjoyed this recipe. My husband did not, but since he's incredibly picky, this is just based on my feelings. I felt this needed "something". I'm not sure what. It's an awful lot of meat without much else - maybe some corn or beans would be a nice addition. I added water to the meat mixture because it was very thick at first. It baked up to a great consistency.

I used green pepper along with the onion and ground beef...after all was browned, I added 1/2 tomato sauce, salsa (1cup)  2 spoonfuls of sour cream and few squirts of hot sauce...then I added spices.  I used a pie pan, and cut the tortilla's to fit inside and made it similar to a lasagna...layer of meat, layer of cheese, tortilla and kept building.  Put in oven for 20 minutes and then cool a bit.  Everyone liked it a lot! Thanks for the recipe.

Okay so i saw this recipe on here and thought it looked really good and without reading the reviews i decided to try it so i made it exactly like it read. thats my worst mistake. the tomato paste made it waaaayyy to tomato flavored! i would have used taco seasoning if I had of thought of it. so yeah unless your a huge fan of tomato paste and a whole lot of chille flavoring dont make this, use taco seasoning

This was pretty tasty.  I added some chopped jalapenos to spice it up a bit and the can of corn as others suggested.  Served sour cream with it on the side.

I followed the advice of using a pack of taco seasoning instead of the spices.  I did not use the tomato paste, instead I used a can of Ro-Tel original.  This was a very easy recipe and the kids loved it. I will make this again!!

This recipe is really good!  I added a can of corn and used taco mix instead of the individual spices.  I also only used two tortillas, instead of four.  My pan would not have held four layers.  My family loved it!  My two-year-old ate two helpings, and there are no leftovers!  This is a quick, easy, and inexpensive meal.  I could probably make it ahead of time and refrigerate it, too, which I love as a working mom.  I will definitely make it again.

FABULOUS!  I did bump up the chili powder to a tablespoon.  What's life without a little spice, right?  Next time, I'll add corn, beans, and peppers to make it more of a complete meal.  Nothing to hear in our house but the clang of forks scraping plates.

This was easy to make and tasted OK.  I'd amp it up on the spices or jalapenos--this recipe is not very spicy.  Tons of calories and cholesterol!!  I may substitute the red meat with chicken, turkey, ground tofu, or beans.

My son, soon going off to college, devoured this casserole.  It is very easy.  I will add this to the recipe book I'm compiling for when he leaves then nest.  Next time I might add green chiles or bell pepper.

tastes very good!  I added green onions to the top and some beans.  I put less meat in because it seemed very beef-heavy...v. satisified.

This recipe is a hot in our home!!  I've already made it twice.
My husband loves it an so do I.  I added a whole can of CORN to it and
I think this is something everyone should do.  It gave the meal a little heavier and 
the taste was great!!!!  Once, i didn't have the chile and so I substituted just a 
little bit of cayenne, it turned out wonderful.  Not too spicy at all.  Great fro a meal and since
there are only 2 of us in the household, we always have left overs for lunch!!
Thank you for a great recipe that I'll make over and over again.

This has potential but I’m glad I read some reviews before making. Like many, I eliminated the tomato paste since I am not fond of dishes with a strong tomato flavor. I used only one pound of ground beef and added a can of black beans (rinsed). I used two tablespoons of homemade taco seasoning in place of the spices listed. I used four flour tortillas like the recipe called for but would cut it back to three next time. Also, I would place one of the tortillas on the bottom of the plate instead of the ground beef mixture. Topped with sour cream and sliced black olives served with a side helping of Mexi-corn and this was a tasty and filling dish.

I made this receipe and it turned out great.  I added sour cream,  green onions, cilantro and olives.  I also added some bottled salsa into turkey meat to give it more seasoning.  We like ours very seasoned, so I added taco seasoning to the meat while cooking.  So good.  Everyone loved it!

Best Enchilada Casserole ever!!  Just added a little more cumin and salt. Used flour tortillas. Tasted much better than corn tortillas. I also serve it with refried beans, sour cream, and some fresh cilantro on the side. I used a rectangular pan and cut the time in the oven down to 15 minutes. I've made this quite a few times and it's always a hit!

Looking for something different to make for dinner, I came upon this recipe.  I cannot tell you how simple, how delicious and eye appealing.  But best of all, the flavors melded together where you could taste each individually, yet all blended together.  I used a 10 inch deep dish pie plate which is fluted, but added to eye-appeal, and doubled the garlic (we're garlic lovers).  There is no need to alter this recipe in any other way.  THANK YOU  Tammie Swain, THANK YOU AND AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR SHARING this amazing recipe.

Great Recipe, though I have settled on some changes that I like better than the original.  First, I make sure to generously  oil the tortilla shells with extra virgin olive oil, which helps the edges to toast nicely without burning.  You only need to do the outer 2-3 inches on each one.  I do this over and in the deep dish pie plate, and it is well oiled by the time I am done, as well.
Next, in a cold large skillet( I use a Wok) place 2 TBSP of extra virgin olive oil, and add the garlic, and cook over medium heat until the garlic is sizzling and just starting to color.  Add the onions, and cook until the onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.  Cook and stir the ground beef into the onions until it is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes.  Then add 1 can of Ro-Tel Mexican style chopped tomatoes, 1 6 oz can of tomato paste, 1 4 oz can of chopped green chilis, and a packet of taco seasoning.  Bring to a boil, and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes until it starts to thicken.  I then assemble the pie as described, though I will usually use a mexican 4 cheese mix rather than the cheddar for the cheese.  Bake as described, allow it to rest for 5 minutes after removing it from the oven, and it will hold together better for serving.

Instead of the cumin, chili powder and salt, I used taco seasoning mix just bc I had a ton in the pantry.  Otherwise I made it exactly as stated and it was awesome!  Served it with sour cream, lettuce, tomato, jalapenos.  Have been looking for a good Mexican casserole and this is definitely it!  Doubled the recipe and ended up with 3 regular pie plates enabling me to share one with a neighbor.  Will make regularly!

I did some changes to this recipe based on other reviews. First, I used corn tortillas instead of flour. Secondly, instead of the spices, I browned the meat (I only used 1 lb) in taco seasoning. I used a 15 oz can of enchilada sauce as well.  I know I changed the recipe quite a bit from the original, but it suited our taste and was delicious! I also made Best Spanish Rice as a side, which is a fantastic recipe in itself.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  I will make some changes next time though like corn tortillas, add some green chilis and use mexican cheese instead of cheddar.  May even add a few jalapenos for some more flavor and kick.  The first time around though was great!

Yum yum!  I agree with using the taco seasoning instead of the other spices and adding corn and green chiles, sometimes jalapenos, too.  Definitely serve with salsa and sour cream--refried beans, too.

Made with canned enchilada sauce, added a little cumin and diced onion w/chopped garlic.  Also used ground turkey instead of beef and added extra cheese.  Family loved it, but think I might try corn tortillas next time.  Very good and easy.

I made this last weekend and it was a hit.  I followed SunflowerMom's review and used Taco seasoning, didn't use tomato paste, added black beans, and a small can of corn. It was really good and will make it many more times.

Loved this recipe, even my boyfriend who didn't think he liked "Casserole" couldn't stop saying Mmmmm. I split this into two different pans, one for him with flour tortillas and one with corn tortillas & FF cheese for me.

The flour tortillas were very doughy. I will use white corn tortilla chips the next time to avoid the doughy flour tortillas. This is very good.

Tasty, but a little dry, next time I will add a layer of corn, and add some green pepper to the hamburger mix. I used corn tortillas, too, and was pleased with the results.

I was concerned about the flour tortilla being to mushy based on the other reviews, so I used a little less tomato sauce. Turned out I should have used MORE - it just seemed a little too dry. We added some taco sauce on top (and sour cream) and it was much better. I also used taco seasoning, black beans,and some fresh tomato.

I made this mostly as is for my husband & I -- really great!  I made a vegetarian version for my daughter that used refried beans instead of the ground beef and she really liked it as well.  Thank you for a great recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed the casserole, but I put my own twist on it:  I left out the cumin and garlic (didn't have any on hand) and added 1 can each of corn and black beans.  I also added into the layering 1 cup of non-fat plain yogurt (a sour cream alternative) and used corn tortillas instead of flour.  Lastly, I placed everything in a 9 x 13 casserole dish instead of the pie pan.  It was great!  With these additions, it definitely makes more than 4 servings, though--probably more like six.

For a quick meal it is pretty good. My children liked it the way the recipe says, but I definately think it needs some extra ingredients for the adult palette. The other reviewers had a lot of good ideas... I will try them next time.

Easy recipe! I added whole corn and black beans (both drained) per someone else's suggestion, and it was great! I think the next time I will try corn tortillas; the flour ones ended up a little soggy. But other than that, my picky toddler ate it, so I will be making it again!

This was quick and easy and really good! The only change we'd make is to add a little 'heat' to it, maybe a little cayenne pepper. I rate this a "5-star" and a "repeat" at our house!

I thought this was a good recipe.  I added diced chilies to the ground beef and I used 1 can of mexican style tomato sauce with a little bit of regular tomato sauce added, I used the cumin & chili powder as directed, the only thing is next time I will double the sauce so it will be more "saucier", otherwise I thought it was a great recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I added a can of black beans, a can of corn, and half a cup of water. I served with plenty of sour cream.  I also used more tortillas then it called for.  My son loved this.  I split the recipe and froze the other half.  We can't wait to eat it again!!

We loved this recipe.  We keep kosher so sprinkling the cheese on top would not work for us.  I made a layer of beans, then a layer of the meat sauce, then the tortillas, etc.  On the top tortilla I poured salsa and baked.  Wonderful!  We will make this again.

I followed suggestions of others an made a few additions: red and yellow bell peppers, pinto beans, sour cream (in a layer of it's own). Also, I substituted soy ground beef, so it required a beef bullion cube to boost the beef flavor. My boyfriend commented three times that it was a 'great dish' :) I would have liked to figure out how to make the flour tortilla shells a bit crispier as the layers inside. Baking lightly first?

IT was very cheesy.  I added green peppers and substituted chili powder with paprika.  It was good, but there were upset stomachs all around!

Yeesh. I thought I'd avoid the overly tomato-y taste by omitting the tomato paste. I also used black beans in exchange for the ground beef. Still, found this dish to taste as good as it looked...and it did not look appetizing coming out of the oven.

It was not the worst tasting thing I've had but I will not make this again.

I think it was very good and really really awesome for something so easy and simple to make. I think next time I'll dice some bell pepper to saute' and add to it. (I'm a veggie person) And add some raw chopped onion on top with jalapeno slices. Though for my first time I didn't want to add anything and mess it up and I thought it was very very good. I did have to add a lil bit more chili powder and cumin and I didn't have any tomatoe paste so I just used the one can of tomatoe sauce. I also had Alberts Hot Sauce with it which was supper yummy together. But hey! Like I said it was great! =) Good one! Deff. a keeper!

This was great!  We used sausage instead of beef and added jalapeno slices to the layers (my family loves spicy).  My teenage boys loved it. Thanks!

It was ok, but DD thought it had too much of a tomato flavor, didn't use but 1/4 of the paste and threw in some salsa for extra flavor. If we make again will try other ingredients.

I turned this recipe into a five star rating by making some changes.  I left out the tom. paste, added corn, kidney beans, green chilis, and a packet of taco seasoning.  I also put a little salsa on top.  Very good!  I also like the Burrito Pie recipe on this site.

We didn't care for this at all. The taste of tomato paste permeated the dish. I served corn as a side dish and it would have been better in the casserole. If I was going to make it again I would add it as a layer. But, I do not plan on ever making this again.

My family finished what was on their plate but no one wanted seconds. I think I will stick to enchaladas. This was to thick and the cumin gave it a sweet taste.

This was so yummy!  I did leave out the tomato paste, and also added green pepper and creamed corn.  Otherwise, that was it and it was very yummy!

This was good. I used taco seasoning instead of the other spices. But I also thought it had too much tomato. My husband liked it though so I may make it again.

We didn't like this recipe. Too much tomato, it tasted more like a Italian dish than a Mexican dish.

I changed the seasonings to suit our tastes and spice this up a little bit.  I used Haberno pepper seasoning, dried minced onion, and Hot Shot (red/black pepper) in place of the chili powder & cumin.  I also added a can of southwestern corn with diced peppers, based on other reviews.  Overall, this was a quick and easy meal that I'll be making again!

This was one of the easiest and tastiest recipes I've made in a long time.  Even the leftovers were delicious the day after.  I strongly recommend this dish when you're having company to impress them with your cooking.

Such flavor and really easy to make! The ground cumin really adds flavor! This dish would go great with mexican rice too! I love flour tortillas so it was delicious to me but my DH want's me to make it with corn ones the next time. Either way I'm sure it tastes great! I would reccomend anyone who likes easy meals to try this.

This looks very similar to a recipe I was looking for. Accept the one we had had frozen spinach added to the meat sauce (drained and chopped) and sour cream was layered into it as well. Very delicious! Maybe not as kid friendly, but you never know that spinach would be there.

This was really good!  Even my youngest, who normally doesn't care much for mexican style dishes, ate two helpings of this.  I will definitely make this again, and maybe add some sliced black olives and chopped green chilies.
