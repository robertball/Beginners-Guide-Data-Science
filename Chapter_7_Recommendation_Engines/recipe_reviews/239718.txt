It's true this has so much flavor.  We loved it.  I kept to the recipe, except to my dismay, I thought I had hominy and I didn't so I subbed garbanzo beans.  Wasn't sure how it would do but they worked.  At the time of serving, I took the cook's suggestion and added sour cream, lime and cilantro to each bowl.  Yummy

Wow!  This chili recipe has so much flavor, and the veggies & low-fat turkey make it heart-healthy, too.

I think I went a little overboard with the cayenne but that's OK I like the heat. The hominy throws the recipe off. Next time I'll try it without the hominy and reserve it for posole.
