I made this soup tonight for my family.  I'd have to say I was a little disappointed with it.  First of all why add 3 cups of water to the chicken broth it just watered it down, I ended up adding some chicken bullion to it to bring some of the flavor back.  Secondly  adding the veggies  the way stated in the instructions  makes for some very over cooked veggies.  I will make the soup again but next time I will not add the extra water, but extra broth.  I’ll add the veggies the same time I add the tortellini and won’t have the soup simmer 25 minutes with the chicken before adding the veggies, 15 minutes of simmering is plenty before adding the veggies.  I also added a handful of spinach at the very end just before serving, giving it just enough time to wilt before spooning it out into bowls.  Some of my family don’t like Parmesan cheese so we just added it to our own bowls for those of us who wanted it.  I think with these changes it will make a much better soup.  I also have to say that I didn’t add the lemon pepper because I didn’t have any on hand, I just use ground black pepper.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I had a few changes I roasted a chicken.  The chicken shreaded I liked the effect.  I had to use dried tortellini so I added and extra can of chicken broth.  The only change for next time is I will add another can of broth to add more liquid.

This is a delicious and multi texture soup.  You can use leftover chix breast instead of cooking it in the soup--great way to get rid of leftover chicken plus using fresh veggies make it healthy too.  The before I broiled chicken breast with garlic pepper and olive oil for 15 minutes.  It sat over night in the fridge, and I cut it up the next night for the soup.  I added it last just to warm it up.  Delicious!

This is a delicious soup.  I use chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts.  The recipe calls for a 9 oz bag of tortellini, but I could only find 19(?) I added over half of a 19 oz bag and it came out great.  When we ate it, we also added more parmesan cheese.

This was quite yummy! I used zucchini instead of broccoli and it added a nice flavor all together. The only thing I would say to change, is definitely add a chicken boulin cube or two to it and add some black pepper or on top of the lemon pepper. Otherwise it will be slightly bland. All in all, I enjoyed this dish and so did my husband.

Good but I felt like it was missing that special something to make it great.  Needs more seasonings.  Maybe some bacon too?

Very good. My husband said next time I should leave out the broccoli and add more pepper, however, I thought it was just right.

This was very good, but I did add more seasoning and used less water.  I used two 14oz cans of chicken broth and 2 soup cans of water.  Probably needed a bit more liquid.  I boiled for 20 minutes, added frozen broccoli, boiled another 7 minutes or so and added refrigerated tortellini.  That only needed about 5 minutes and it was done.  I added 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp dried parsley, and 1 tsp dried thyme.  Made this way it was flavorful and we all enjoyed it!

Being the lazy person I am, and since I had leftover chicken that i had already pulled apart and was in broth, I threw everything in the pressure cooker and cooked it on rice setting for 6 minutes.  Done and good, will do again.  The only thing I did was add some chicken cubes to the water and put in about a tsp of lemon juice, regular pepper and som garlic powder.  Also not a big fan of oregano, might try basil instead next time.

Very satisfying chicken soup. Love the tortellini. Add more spice than it calls for though

I have a family of 6 and make this often,  everyone loves it.  I pan cook the chicken first though because I like a golden brown chicken.  Yum.
