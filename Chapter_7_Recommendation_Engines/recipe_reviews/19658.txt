These were delicious. One thing I did change tho was to use deli ham slices and to spread the cream cheese onto the ham and roll the onion up in the ham and slice it into 1" pieces, placing the slices on a Ritz Cracker. Much more manageable for a one bite appetizer.

My husbands family eats this every year at Christmas.  The Men LOVE IT!  The women don't care either way.  I've trid them and they taste good but we always use the extra from our cheese ball for the cream cheese mixture.

I have been making a similar one for years and we all love them.  I use dried beef instead of the corned beef.  The jarred dried beef is just the right size.  I spread the Philly cream cheese onto the piece of dried beef and then wrap it around the onion.  They do take some time, but worth it.

I have made these for years and LOVE them. Including me, all the women in my family go crazy over these!! I like to use thin cut deli ham when I make them. I have taken them to many parties and they are just really great LOOKING as well. I cut the greens of the onions long so that it sticks out about 2 inches from the ham roll, this looks great!! You do have to like onion to eat them, so if you don't or the women in your family dont, you can also use canned asparagus instead of the onion, or you can use dill pickles. Either way they are to die for~~

These are always a hit with men and women. Try using spreadable flavored cream cheese in a tub, add garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Spread on pastrami and roll around the onion.  It's not supposed to be a one bite appetizer.

I wanted to use up some of my green onions. After being recommended to try this by pomplemousse, I decided this would be great to take for myself to my daughter's end of school year picnic. The night prior, I had the munchies and decided to make a few. They were great! Short, simple, and made as is.

We have done these many ways - our favorite is to use the Hormel dried beef in a jar - very salty - but the meat doesn't tear as easily.  We love the onion (women as well as men)!  These are easy and quick and Yummy!

I use packaged ham slices cut in half or 4 strips, depending on the size of ham and I mix the cream cheese with a ranch dressing mix. I have to double up the recipe for our family always a big hit.

I tried making these and it turned into a big mess. Getting the cream cheese to spread on the corned beef was a nightmare. If you used too soft a touch it wouldn't spread if you used too hard of a touch it would tear the meat. I ended up chopping up the onions and beef and mixing it into a spread which just wasn't that impressive.

This is an excellent recipe and it was quite easy to follow. I did use chive and onion cream cheese, so I think that added to the flavor. I made it just for myself, but I think it would make it awesome game appetizer or something to that affect. It was a very quick recipe as well.

These sound delicious. I use the same ingredients to make a cheeseball several times a year and serve with wheat thins. It's been my favorite dip since I was WAY younger so I KNOW I would like this spin on the ingredients. And for those who say it is messy, you can zap cream cheese in the microwave to soften it more. Just keep an eye on it. Or just try the dip. The only difference is that you chop the onions and dried beef and then mix it all together and shape it into a ball or whatever you want.

This was an odd tasting recipe, either you love it or hate it.  Toke to a birthday party and it was gone within half hour.  Used ham and wrapped around green onion and large dill pickels.  I did not have a problem spreading the cream cheese, I just set it out to soften and it was fine.

I have been made this several times and I like lower sodium dried beef which I chop in my mini chopper put into a small baggie. I whip up the cream cheese so its easier to spread on the green onion. I spread the cream cheese with a butter knife then dip onion into the baggie of dried beef and lay on your plate..Makes a great presentation.

I have made a variation of this for years, and always a big hit. Usually use a dried beef, but the big secret is to add ranch dressing powder to the cream cheese for a wonderful boost! It can be a bit messy, but once you get the knack it's not a bad process.

Great receipe and easy to fix.  I made it with salami, cream cheese and green onion, and also with salami  cream cheese and pepperocinis, or small Greek peppers. One more thing I put the a slice of cheese and a slice of green onion or a slice of pepperocini inside the salami and roll it, then topped it with an olive using a tooth pick. Great for one bite.

I too have been making this recipe for years.  Sometimes I use boiled ham or salami or any other cold meat which is sliced thick enough to be firm.  I was making this before flavored cream cheese so I would flavor my own.  I now use flavored cream cheese.  What I have done differently is to take the rolled product as given in the recipe and slice it into about 1/2 to 3/4 inch slices. Serve with toothpicks and this is truly a one bite appetizer.

My sis-in-law has been making these with ham slices for family gatherings for years, and it is enjoyed by all the family members.  Actually, she even has made them using pickle slices/spears as the center and, surprisingly, they were delish.  Sweet, dill, it doesn't matter.

I tried this dish several years ago at a party and I loved then ever since. If you don't make your own corned beef, use Boars Head corned beef slices to even out the spice of the green onion.

These have been in our family for a long time. We do them for every occasion! I make them using the dried beef that comes in a jar and use the vegetable flavored cream cheese or onion and chive cream cheese. Yummy!

A home run! Guys and girls alike. I used roast beef but I'll probably use corned beef next time - the black "rind" of the roast beef has a tendency to get stuck in your teeth. Not what you want to think about at a party! I'll also cut the rolls a little smaller. They turned out a tad more than a mouthful somehow. Not bad for my first appetizer!

When making this recipe try this:

Cut onions so greens are sticking out past the meat, about 1 inch.  Use deli lean ham, it tastes better.  Also, I use a very thin pickle spear in each one.  Spread very thin layer of cream cheese on ham, then roll up with onion and pickle.  These are very good, the pickle calms the onion taste a bit and it is very delicious.  They look just like a roll-up, very neat in appearance.

These are great with just about any type of deli meat or other thin-sliced meat. I've also tried substituting the Italian marinated vegetables that come in a jar for the onion and that was great too. I have not tried this yet, but I think they would also be really tasty with a slice of deli cheese in between the meat and the cream cheese. I'll report back later and let you know how it goes.

These were SO good! They reminded me of the cheese ball my Grandmother used to make at holidays but without the need for crackers.

I make this same recipe with ham slices, but find the onion is too strong for me. So I chop in very fine and mix with the cream cheese and spread it that way... easier to eat as well...
