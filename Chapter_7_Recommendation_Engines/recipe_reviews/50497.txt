This is very good, but cream-style corn should have some creamy corn in it, not just corn kernels with cream.  Southern homemade cream-style corn is made by slicing the kernels of a corn cob then sliding the knife blade down the cob, scraping off what's left of the corn kernels.  This makes a creamier dish without the use of cream (my grandparents in Kentucky make this every year and freeze it for the winter).  I used the immersion blender on this corn for a couple of pulses and that helped immensely for those of us who don't like large kernels in our cream-style corn.

I have a high salt diet, and this is way to salty, even for me. I would suggest dropping the salt down to 1/4 to maybe 1/2 teaspoon. I also added a touch of thyme, a touch I learned from a local restaurant, which provides a little more flavor.

Finally a simple recipe that doesn't just use canned corn. I needed to use some ears that were starting to shrink up and this was perfect. I used 4 ears of corn, cut off the cob and processed a little, a can of evaporated milk and followed the rest of the recipe. The flavor is wonderful but since I used fresh corn I think it should cook longer depending on the texture you want. The 20 minutes still gave it a crunch which I like but simmering an extra 10 or so probably wouldn't hurt.

I decreased the serving for this so that could be the reason for my issue but this got really thick, I did really enjoy the flavor, but I had to add lots of extra milk to thin it out.

Going to the Brookville hotel was a special treat for my family when I was a kid. The hotel became nearly a legend mostly because of it's great down-home, Kansas food.  This is a favorite cream corn by those who typically say that they don't like cream corn.  I am always asked to bring this to family dinners. Easy to make!!

I used this recipe more as inspiration than anything.  I made a few changes, but loved what I turned it into.  I used 2 cans of whole kernel corn, drained, milk instead of heavy cream (because that's what I had on hand), 1/2 teaspoon of salt (because I used canned corn which has a pretty good amount of salt already), I left the corn starch at 1 tablespoon and after tasting I ended up with a total of 2 tablespoons of sugar.  This recipe is SO easy and delicious!  I love creamed corn, but hate how the canned stuff is not whole kernel and it's pretty soupy.  This had the wonderful taste, but was thicker.

I liked this. Blend a little with an emersion(sp?) blender if you want it a bit more creamy, that's my favorite way to do it. I use this in recipes which call for canned creamed corn and it makes everything taste better.

This is a keeper! The only change I made is that I used 1/2 & 1/2 since I didn't have any heavy cream. It worked just as well. After cooking for 20 min, I used my immersion blender a bit to blend some of the corn up. Even my grand daughter loved this. I will definitely make this again.

a keeper! the taste was good, not too sweet or salty and it was very easy to make. i used canned corn, about 1C cream and added a splash milk (it didnt seem to have enough liquid). i also followed another reviewers suggestion and used my hand held blender to give it a few blitzes to cream some of the corn too. worked great!

I have made this recipe for the holidays but the variation I use makes a roux out of 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 tablespoon of buttter. You melt the butter and then stir in the flour, then add the corn and cream. The corn is placed into a casserole dish and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes, or until bubbling.  The texture is better than using cornstarch, which tends to breakdown with reheating.

I thought this corn was a pretty good recipe. It got my husband to eat it and he doesnt care for corn but I would omit the cream cheese and only add half the butter at first and then when it was done in the oven add the other half.

I love this recipe as a basis for cream style corn. I only had canned green giant whole kernel corn so i used my hand mixer and creamed one can of corn, sauteed 2 cans of whole kernel corn in 3 tablespoons of butter added the creamed corn i crushed with the hand mixer and added 1 tsp salt and 2 tbls sugar. I allowed it to fuse the flavors for about 10 minutes and mixed together 1 cup heavy cream and 1 tbls cornstarch. I adjusted the salt and sugar to taste. I added the heavy cream mixture and continued to cook on medium heat while stirring and voila it was done to perfection.

This corn is fantastic!  I've been using this recipe for a few years now, the only modification is that I subsitute milk for the cream; cuts down on the fat but tastes just as rich!

The dish was very tasty, however I do agree with another reviewer who stated it is better to have the corn minced (at least some kernels) to make it fuller. Seems like a small detail, but an important element, otherwise it's just corn and liquid (maybe because I'm from the south too). Anyway, used half & half too, to cut down on fat, and canned corn.

I tend to agree that the corn needs to be creamier, not just whole kernals immersed in a crazy amount of cream. Thanks anyway.

I Love this recipe.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was really good.  I am a single person though and it is a big recipe so the last time I just made one microwavable package of sweet corn and adjusted the remainder of the ingredients (I didn't add the cornstarch).  I LOVE this corn and actually look forward to eating a vegetable.

This was good, although it almost seemed like more of a baked corn than cream-style.

Incredible!  But I did use fresh, local sweet corn that I cut/scraped off the cob.  Used half&half instead of heavy cream and used honey in place of white sugar.  Let is simmer for a good 30-40 minutes.  Totally taste-bud blowing.

A wonderful recipe, as written!  Do try using an equal amount of canned white shoepeg corn, drained!

We used a little extra cream, but turned out great.  Took another reviewer's suggestion and added some thyme - great idea, tasted wonderful!

I simplified the recipe to my liking. One can of cream corn, 1 fresh ear of corn from the farmers market. A pinch of thyme, a pinch of sugar, three pinches of black pepper (I like Blk pepper). I tbs of butter. Cooked on low. Yep, it was delish!

Both my husband’s two sisters and his Aunt worked at the Brookville Hotel.  The hotel was famous for its corn, fried chicken, spiced peaches and the heavenly coleslaw—made like no other I have ever had—-all served family style.  Yes, I would make this recipe again!

It was way too thick and stuck to the pan like glue.  Tastes good, but did not look like it would.  Use more cream and a lot lower temperature.

Waaaaay too much salt and butter. 

1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 the butter amount is more than enough.

Granted, it could be my cooking skills, but this recipe does not make Brookville Corn.  Sorry.  It is not a bad recipe, but for Brookville corn, it is too thick and too sweet.  I am questioning the idea of using heavy cream and corn starch.  I am wondering about half and half and corn starch

This makes the best creamed corn I've ever had.  I throw in a little parmesian cheese to the mix sometimes.  We've enjoyed this with our fresh corn out of the garden several times this summer.

I enjoyed this, and I usually don't like "creamed" anything.  My husband, who has no taste at all other than his choice of a wife (well, ok, maybe he's not quite that bad!), did not like it - said it was too "creamy".  He's a canned creamed corn boy.  Maybe next time I'll try this with whole milk instead, as it was too rich for him, but I thought it was delicious.

This recipe is very good.  I used fresh corn cut off the cob and should have cooked it a bit longer.  My daughter made a wonderful corn casserole for Easter, I wanted something with less ingredients and quicker.  This fit the bill.

Wonderful!  I've been using this recipe for several holiday meals and have been asked to make it again for Christmas. Even my picky toddlers eat this up by the forkful.  Thanks, it's been a great addition to our recipe box!
