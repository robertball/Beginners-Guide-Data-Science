Good recipe, but it should be noted that the roast needs to be removed before the desired temperature is reached, as it continues to cook.  We took ours out at 145, but after resting it was over cooked.  We decided we should have removed it at 135 instead.

Very easy to prepare, this one's a keeper. Good idea to use a meat tenderizer.

This was just what I was craving- juicy, flavorful, and made great leftovers! I doubled the spices and ended up cooking it for about 1 1/2 hrs (4lb roast) it came out a perfect medium all the way through. The temp guides were really helpful. This will be added to my regular dinner rotation for sure!

My husband claims this was the best roast he has ever eaten.  I used an outside round roast and added 1/2 tsp of lemon pepper to the spice rub.  It only took 50 minutes and then I let sit 10 mins to get the temperature up to 145F for a perfect medium rare all the way through.  I added a little flour and water to the drippings in the pan for flavourful gravy.  I will make this again for company next time!

This is so easy and it tastes so good.  I follow this to the "t" and use a digital meat thermometer.  If I can do it anyone can.

Cheers,

I've always been intimidated by the idea of making a roast but this looked so easy I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm so glad I did!  The roast came out moist, juicy, flavorful and tender.  It was a hit with the whole family, which is rare.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was an exceptional roast! Everyone LOVED it! This is our new Christmas tradition now. We used Rib Eye Roast for it and it came out amazing.

Soooo delicious!!  I bought an eye round roast because the price was right, but since the fat had been trimmed off I put three strips of bacon over the dotted butter.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  My first roast and it was wonderful! And the leftovers...YUM!!

Simple, easy and good, I'm going to use a better cut next time.  I marinated mine with red wine, a touch of balsamic vinegar and a tsp of horseradish for 24 hrs, excellent reviews from my dinner guests.

Eh .. it was good, but not exceptional. Maybe it was a bad cut of meat? Either way, I prefer my slow cooker roast recipe.

So incredibly good!  I did not have ceyenne pepper, so I used chili powder instead.  I cooked the meat for 43 minutes per pound.  It came out VERY tender and rare in the center.  This one is most definately a keeper!!!

This is the first time I ever made a roast beef and it turned out great - the perfect blend of seasonings. My cooking time was significantly less, but it tasted delicious!

Everyone at Easter loved the Beef Roast.  I cannot say anything about the recipe since I don't eat red meat, but it was unanimous that it had excellent flavor.

excellent mix of spices, the cayenne pepper gives it a good kick. I agree that the cooking times suggested may overcook it.
