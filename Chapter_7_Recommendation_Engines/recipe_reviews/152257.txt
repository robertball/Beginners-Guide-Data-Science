Hi, I am the orginal poster of this recipe.  Thanks for all the great reviews!!  I just read the recipe over and I noticed a few glaring mistakes!!  Please disregard all cooking times listed!!!  If you actually cooked the onions for 20 minutes they would be little bits of carbon!  cook the meatballs, sausage, and pork until they are good and crusty, the onions until they nicely browned, and the whole thing until it tastes good.  The longer it simmers, the more flavor the meat will impart to the sauce.  But please bear in mind that if it simmers too long the meat WILL fall apart.  Especiall the meatballs.  It is also a good idea to remove the meat after the sauce is done as the acids from the tomatoes will also cause the meatballs to disintegrate if left long enough.  I learned this the hard way!  My Grandma failed to mention that part!

Thank you Vincenza! Your recipe made an 80 yo Italian gent very happy!  My dad is very picky and loved it!  I followed the recipe almost to the tee, but did add garlic to the meatballs, and a little to the sauce itself.  Here's a hint for the meatballs: rub olive oil over your hands while you're rolling them.  They stay so much nicer when you're cooking them, and don't come apart this way.  This was a wonderful recipe!

Excellent!! Please remember to throw in some red wine and chopped garlic with some Italian parsley about half an hour before sauce is finished. Then cool/and or re-heat the next day. You can "eyeball" a lot of this...fresh basil is best, and again left until the last 30 minutes.

Found this recipe while looking for meatball recipes.  Gave this one a shot and WOW!  

I only used the meatball recipe part and followed it to the letter (with the exception of not having Romano so I used fresh grated Parmesan cheese AND I used panko bread crumbs) and they turned out amazing. 

I rolled them in small 1" sized balls.  Make sure you follow the instructions written when cooking.  Let them fry in the oil long enough to release themself from the bottom of the skillet.  They will tell you when it's time to be turned.  

I found that a few needed some gentle nudging but for the most part all released themselves on their own and you just stir them around from there.

Excellent meatballs...thank you for sharing this recipe.

I love this recipe!!!  It was so delicious!   I put some in the freezer and my husband and I ate a few more times on it.  I will definitely be cooking this again.  (Love the pork added to it, makes a huge difference!)  Thanks for the recipe!!

The best sauce we've ever made...hands down! It takes some work, but cooking is sharing and showing love, and this recipe is worth every bit of effort. It is key to make the meatballs as written...let them get the crust. The beauty of this recipe is that it feeds a crowd or a family of four for several meals-and they don't complain at all!

Even though my photo shows the entire recipe I am reviewing the meatball portion only.  The meatballs are fairly good but would be so much better with some fresh, minced garlic. I attempted to make the entire recipe but when I got to the part where I was to cook the onions the oil didn't look appetizing . Since I had already browned all of the meat I decided to quickly saute chopped onion and garlic and proceed from there.  I think that the entire recipe would benefit from basil, oregano, red pepper flakes and a splash of red wine.

Want to try it......sounds great.  The photo is a bit sketchy, looks like a nice chocolate pound cake.
