I was introduced to these salt potatoes a couple of years ago while visiting friends in upstate New York. I learned they were a big deal to people there, and I was eager to try the bag/kit of salt potatoes she picked up. The concept, she explained, was that the potatoes were boiled in copious amounts of salt that somehow made them flavorful and special. They were good, I thought, but tasted just like regular ol' boiled potatoes to me. In fact, they needed...salt! When I came across this recipe, I just had to try them again myself at home.  And once again I found them good, but tasting no different than regular ol' boiled potatoes - that needed...salt!

I have made these potatoes several times now, using baby reds... and they are WONDERFUL!  I think it should be noted for people (such as Aspiring Chef Rita) that the recipe calls for WHOLE potatoes, washed only... do not cut the potatoes up and do not peel them otherwise they will absorb the salt and become too salty.  When they are fork tender (about 15 minutes for me) drain them and let them sit to form the thin salt crust.  I sometimes add chives to my melted butter, just for some color and added flavor even though I know it is not traditional.  I have also boiled reds side by side, one pot with amount of salt this recipe calls for and one pot with just a little salt...and it's amazing how the salty brine makes the salt potatoes so creamy inside!  Made correctly, they are NOT salty... just creamy and delicious!  I served them alongside slow-roasted BBQ baby back pork ribs... mmmmmmmm... wonderful!

DO NOT cut the potatoes prior to cooking! 
If only you could taste these with the Cornell barbecue chicken that one can find about any weekend of the summer around here(Ithaca, NY/Cornell area)you'd know what it's all about!!  You want them nice and tender, with plenty of butter, but not falling apart.  Also, make sure you are using small, young potatoes- not too big.

first, i want to say thank you for the recipe. I've never measured in terms of cups, it's always been a quarter pound of salt to every pound of potatoes. For all the people saying that these are regular boiled potatoes, they are too salty, not salty enough, etc.. the purpose of the salt is not so much to make the potatoes salty as it is to lower the boiling point of the water. With the different boiling point, it makes the flesh of the potato creamier than normal boiling and less starchy. As for the saltiness/needs salt problem, you may need to adjust the amount of water that you use. It doesn't specify in the recipe, but for this amount of salt and potatoes, you need 3 quarts of water. If you aren't using enough, you might as well eat the salt shaker and skip the potatoes

Okay, with 113 reviews on this recipe, I seriously doubt that MY review will ever be read but I'm posting it anyway. :D I love reading stories about architypal food that our ancestors ate. I stumbled upon an article on wikipedia about Syracuse Salt Potatoes and was absolutely enthralled with the story of Irish Salt Miners from the turn of the century. On Wikipedia, they had two recipe links. I followed THERE recipes and my family and I enjoyed a treat STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN!!!! This is what I learned: 1) Use ONLY "NEW yellow or white potatoes!!!" Never-ever use red skin potatoes!!! 2) The ratio of salt to water is 1 cup of KOSHER SALT (never table salt) to 6 cups of water. 3) The salt must be completely dissolved IN the water before you put in the potatoes. 4) Boil them until tender, drain but DO NOT RINSE. Allow to cool until you can eat them and use melted butter to dip them into. I'm telling you, Syracuse Salt Potatoes will be served in our home from now on! :D

I've lived in the Syracuse area all my life...they are Always a summertime staple, the Best one's are the Hinderwadle's, some stores carry their "own" brand, but the Hinderwadle's are the "traditional" Salt Potato..for those who aren't too big on using the whole bag of salt when cooking the potatoes, try using a little more than half the bag. I always let the potatoes sit covered after draining for a bit before serving.

I hate to spoil the 5 star rating but I have to.  Straight away you know that the amount of salt and butter used in this recipe is not good for you but since I love potatoes I decided to go for it.  No one ate more than a few bites!!!  The salt was a killer.  One person said that this was suicide on a plate.  In any event - for all those salt lovers - go for it!!!

I love salt potatoes.  I used to live in Binghamton and would always get them at a local spiedie restaurant.  I am not really a potato lover but made like this, they are so yummy.  Make sure the potatoes are nice and small - so you can just pop them in your mouth in one bite!

The author forgot to add that salt potatoes are a summer cookout dish!  In fact they are a staple at any clam bake, BBQ or cookout in CNY.  I don't think I could eat them in the middle of winter.  But they go great with hotdogs on the grill and some corn on the cob, or even with some steamed clams.  I am a CNY native and always had salt potatoes growning up, I never knew they were regional until recently.

I'm from the midwest and had never heard of these.  I thought I would give them a try (just because I'm like that!) and was actually quite impressed with the change in the potatoes.  One would think that it really wouldn't be more than a salty potato...however, it's not salty.  They are creamy and wonderful.  I would offer one word of caution.  I made the mistake of making them alongside a rather mundane pot roast that I expected to be more flavorful than it was.  I would definitely recommend serving them with something with a much bolder flavor.  I saw someone said something about them being served with BBQ chicken and I could definitely see that.  I would just go with a bolder meat than pot roast with these...they deserve it!

Excellent. Do not peel the potatoes. The salt water adds a different flavor to the potatoes and they have a smoother consistency. When they come out of the water, they form a salt crust on the skins that is full of flavor.

These are a classic!!  There's no way they'll be too salty if you do it right.  The salt goes in the water, and most of it is poured off when the potatoes are drained.  DO NOT add the salt directly to the potatoes, it goes in the cooking water.  They're not going to be anything fancy, so adjust your expectations there.  They're potatoes cooked in salt water, it's not going to be a gourmet dish.  Just good, simple food that's immensely popular in this area!

I grew up in central ny and have had this often. They are definitely different from regular boiled potatoes. Regular boiled potatoes get soggy and bland inside and mushy. Salt potatoes get a crispy skin and creamy inside. Let them sit after draining until they dry and get that thin salt film over the tops. The size should be small enough to eat the whole potato in one big full bite, and all around the same size. Don't bother with the recipe if they are medium sized because the point of salt potatoes is lost when you cut them to eat it. The way to enjoy them is to dip them in a little butter and eat the whole thing right off the fork. No cutting or mashing.

Grew up in Syracuse and these potatoes made many clambakes better!  Moved away and finally went back this year after 15+ years...the potatoes are still the same and this recipe is as close to the real thing as you can get.  I'll be introducing my friends in Eastern NC during the next Pirate tailgate!

This recipe does not state the amount of water needed which is 2 quarts for this much salt. Less water and the salt concentration is higher, more water lower. This 1.5 cups salt to 32 oz water works out perfect. I found small Green Giant red potatoes at Walmart of all places in a small mesh back for under $3, a little pricey but the result was great!

I'm a native of Syracuse and these are more than just a simple potato dish.  They are part of our lives and bring with them all the memories of family, friends and good times in the summer.  That's why we give the 5 stars.  In CNY we know reds from whites from yellows, etc. and we know what a raw potato tastes like from an early age. We like the flavors of potatoes without ketchup or mayo or sour cream or whatever else people use to mask the potato flavor. This recipe accentuates pure potato flavor.

These are the best salt potatoes EVER!  I absolutely love the recipe and will make it again for sure.  To me, salt potatoes are potatoes done right.  I stuck to the recipe almost to the letter, but used 4 servings instead.  I had to guess a little with the salt and potatoes, but other than that I really didn't change the recipe.  I added in herbs from my garden that I had dried in my dehydrator while boiling.  I also lightly put in some Table Blend Style Mrs. Dash, my favorite  seasoning mix.  The result was wonderful!  Not only did I have fun making it, the dish was delicious!  I could not put it down!  If you are anyone who likes potatoes, give this recipe a try!

Very good! I have never made these before, but being raised by parents from Upstate NY, I've eaten them many times. I thought the ratio of salt and butter was perfect. Some reviews mentioned it being too salty, but the salt is boiled in the water, not placed directly on the cooked potatoes. Overall good flavor and I'll definitely make them again!

Love this method! Just like little mashed potatoes packaged in a potato skin! Add a little chives, scallions, garlic, tarragon. Or just butter. Pure, simple decadence!

Very good potatoes.   I had never heard of them, so tried them.  Wonderful creamy texture and a light salt flavor.  Definately let them dry so you get the light salt coating on the skin.  A nice simple potatoe dish.   I followed the recipe, used baby reds.  Only addition was some fresh chives added to the butter.  Yum!

I was impressed that such a simple recipe could be so tasty!  I've never been a fan of the texture of boiled potatoes, but these are completely different.  They are super creamy inside without being mushy.  The salt crust on the outside gives the impression that they will be overly salty, but they weren't at all.  In fact, they were perfectly salted.  I thought I had made far too many for the number of people I was serving, but everyone kept going back for more.  I got rave reviews and requests to make them again from everyone.  We had them with steak, but I think they would be perfect with almost anything.

I am loving these potatoes! I used the larger red potatoes and cut them into 8ths before boiling. It cooked them a bit quicker. Wonderful quick potato dinner! Thanks so much! We will be eating these a lot.

Salt potatoes are just delicious!!  I am always disappointed I can't find the bag/kit outside of Upstate NY.  This recipe does a fine job, although I usually use Kosher/course salt.

These are the best!  To get the full taste I had someone drive 700 miles from Syracuse to bring me salt potaotes from Wegmans!

Grew up in Western NY, but now live in Ottawa, Ontario and always had these potatoes at the fairs.  What a nice reminder of home.  Made a 1/2 batch and they were perfect! Thanks.

These were great! Yes, it is a lot of salt, but the result is a buttery, smooth potato with a crispy, salty skin. We didn't serve with butter. They are perfect in their own!

Wow! What an awesome dish! I made these for my girlfriend's birthday dinner tonight and we were both blown away by these little nuggets of goodness. I used Teeny Tiny Potatoes from Trader Joe's and followed the tip from another reviewer about the proportion of salt:water. Since I had a 1# bag of potatoes, I used 3/8 c. salt: 2 cups water. The salt crust formed just as described. Sooo delish and super easy. We will definitely make these again!

Yum - and really not salty at all.  I didn't get as much of a salt crust as other people said (maybe too much water?), but  they were good anyway.  My 15 year old (who doesn't like potatoes at all)  really liked these.  Used up all the salt in the house, though!

Mmmmm.  Very, very good.  Mine took closer to 25-30 minutes to boil but they were on the larger side.  Perfect with BBQ smoked pork.  Mmmmm.

My husband made these twice thinking that we didn't do something right the first time. These were not bad but, they tasted like plain potatoes that needed salt. Nothing special. Will not be making these again.

After reading the history behind these little potatoes, I just had to try.  It's really neat how the salt forms a thin crust around the potato.  Even though you think the salt would be overpowering, I found it no different than if I salted my french fries.  It's always fun to experience food from other parts of the region.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

My husband and father loved them. I followed the directions except (i know, i know) I let each individual add butter to theirs if they wanted it. I did like the salt crust and the insides of the potatoes were not salty at all. Really good.

I love these potatoes, but according to the original recipe (and trial and error), using Non-Iodized salt tastes the best and using red potatoes only.  Also, add chopped green onions to the butter before melting.  Yummy!

Perfect with or without the butter.  Husband likes his buttery, I like them plain, and the salty flavor is excellent every time.  Very simple to make.

A blast from the past. Such a delicious and simple side dish. You can throw in some fresh dill or parsley etc for looks, but these are so tasty they really don't need anything else. These are best served the same day...they lose some of their flavor as leftovers the next day.

I grew up in Upstate NY, and was shocked to find out that no one on the West Coast knew what Salt Potatoes were! My mom & I used to always buy the bags of potatoes at the store that came with a packet of salt inside, so I used this recipe to get the salt measurement right. I usually get either baby gold potatoes or new red potatoes. As long as they as small, with thin skin, and never cut. My husband & in-laws are now hooked. :)

This is a definite dish at any CNY summer gathering! It's important to use small whole potatoes, and let them sit after draining so the salt crust forms. My mom always mixed real butter and margarine to help cut the fat. Give them a chance ... you will understand why ALL of CNY'er's LOVE Salt Potatoes!  They are creamy and delicious ... the salt adds a bonus flavor that is not too overpowering.

Being an Upstate New York native I have made these for years and its important to make sure to use very small potatoes, no larger than 2 inches in diameter.  Also, only use a little more water than you need to cover the spuds. That way you won't dilute the yummy salty flavor, since that's what we're after here with this dish.

Soo glad I found this recipe. We used to have these at clambakes every year growing up. I'm originally from WNY right on lake ontario. I moved out to the midwest and nobody here new what I was talking about. But this recipe is just what I remeber as a kid! Add a chopped parsely oy chives to the butter for a little extra kick!

Up there with some of the best potatoes in the world. Really is there anything better then salty buttery potatoes. I think not. Not overly salty at all. It was almost like mashed potatoes inside. So creamy so yummy. I used purple potatoes and browned my butter a tad because I love the nuttiness of brown butter. So very good I know I will be making this dish often. Thank you!

This was delicious and simple!  I put about 2lbs of small-medium red, purple and gold potatoes in a pot & covered generously with water.  I added one cup of salt (my that's  a lot of salt when you have it all measured out) and allowed it to come to a boil.  Then, I simmered those potato butts for 20-25 minutes.

What came out was amazing!  Taken out with a slotted spoon and patiently waiting for them to dry, a soft salt crust developed around the skin making it look like my potatoes were precious jewels.

I devoured them immediately.  I loved how the outside skin was salty and chewy and the inside "meat" though slightly bland, was creamy and soft and paired well with the salty exterior.  Even my boyfriend (whom displayed no interest upon hearing how these were made) readily ate a few.

No need for butter.  These make for perfect snacks on the go!

Very good....followed recipe as stated.  Potatoes did change in consistency and were very creamy and smooth.  Topped with  the melted butter with a little Thyme.....perfect pairing with baked chicken.  Will make again!

These are a treat.  I used fingerling potatoes and kosher salt, but I made sure I had a nice salty brine.  My guests raved about how good they were.  The outside had a slight salty crust and the potatoes were silky and creamy.  Thanks kapsmary, this is a keeper!

I had Salt Potatoes 1 time and have not been able to forget the yummyness.  I finally found a recipe and made it right away.  The only thing I did differently because the potatoes used for this recipe are so expensive is make a fourth of the recipe posted here.  Also I added Garlic Salt.  Once I made the recipe and tasted it, it seemed quite bland.  Garlic Salt did the trick!!!!!!  YEAH!!!!!  The family loved it and it brought me back to Watertown, NY.

A sure sign of summer or a NYer's wishful longing: Salt potatoes and grilled Italian marinated chicken! I bought some prewashed baby potatoes earlier today and plan to use them for this tonight- Got the winter blues.

I just moved out to Syracuse area, and had these at a fair. They were amazing so I searched and found this recipe!! I made them for my family and 2 dinner guests! They were a big hit and a new favorite in my house. I did add a little extra salt after pouring the butter over them.

I grew up eating these every summer at my grandparents house in Fulton, NY!  I am so happy to find this recipe!  Having them for dinner tonight!  I can remember my grandmother just throwing a big chunk of butter in the pan with the drained potatoes and we would always get yelled at for standing at the stove eating them right out of the pot!

I have been eating these treats for about 40 years, and I have to agree with "Naples34102".  They can be bland.  And what I do to prevent this, is add the potatoes and the salt at the same time, while the water is at a full boil.  The rest of the recipe is the same.  Be sure to have plenty of melted butter on hand.  Those of you who live in upstate NY should relish this treat...you can't get in any where else, unles you do it yourself.  And there are no kits outside of that area.  I'm giving this recilpe 4 stars, only because I think adding the salt with the potatoes makes them salter, and more deserving of 5.  Oh, and I prefer sea salt, or kosher salt over the "fine" salt called for.  Just my preferance.

I was introduced to these while working in NNY building Fort Drum.  They sold the packages of 4 lb potatoes and 1 lb salt so I tried it.  The first time I kept the potatoes at a rolling boil until done.  The next day I spent 30 minutes washing the salt residue off the stove. ;)  I like to lightly smash a potato and put just a tad bit of butter on.   These really do go great with BBQ and other bold flavored dishes.  I Love them.  Brings back fond memories of the great food and wonderful people of Upstate NY.  They also go well with the killer Buffalo Wings I bought in a small store in Pamelia.

These are yummy, not too salty.  Much cheaper than buying the kit to make Salt Potatoes...they are just potatoes packed with a bag of salt!  I reheated mine in the Crock Pot...which I wouldn't recommend.  Great at a picnic.

I am from Rochester/Buffalo Ny area, and no summer picnic, BBQ, or clam bake is complete without salt potatoes! I never put butter on top of them bc I prefer them plain with the salty crust. If you skip the butter then you can eat them cold for breakfast the next morning. Yum!

My husband and I met in Syracuse - and he is from Potsdam (way upstate) - he is ALWAYS asking for salt potatoes as a side dish. This recipe gave me the ratios I needed to make him happy. Thanks :)

I LOVE these potatoes!  They taste fantastic and my roommates loved them too.  Be careful to balance out your potato weight and the water/salt ratio, the first time I made this I incorrectly guestimated my potatos and it was almost too salty.  The second (and third and fourth and fifth!) times it was fantastic and my roommates beg me to make this all the time!

I'd never heard of these until we moved to the PA/NY border almost 15 years ago.  However, they are a family favorite.  We get these at every local festival and make them for every backyard barbecue.  Make them exactly as described -- no need to dress them up.

Like many others I grew up in CNY , and had these at clambakes, fish fries, various fairs and Firemen's conventions.  The first time my wife (a native of Columbus, Ohio) had them she wasn't sure about the salt.  Once she had them she was hooked. I have made these with all sorts of potatoes: white reds, golds and today, creamers. I found these at a produce market in Venice, Florida.  I looked this recipe up for the amount of salt.  I followed it exactly, and the potatoes were fantastic.  I only wish that I had three or four dozen steamers, with which to serve them.  NOTE: Use any potato you like, but make sure they are small,
 single bite size, and DO NOT cut them.

I followed the directions exactly, as I had never made these salt potatoes, nor had I ever tasted them. They came out exactly as described....a mildly salted exterior with a creamy potato interior unlike any other I had tasted. With melted butter, it tasted like mashed potato in a bite. Delicious!!!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, as I followed the recipe to a tee.  I've seen many reviewers say that these were NOT salty, but mine were terribly salty!  Salty to the point of being inedible.  I've never had Syracuse Salt Potatoes before, so I'm not sure what to compare them to, but unfortunately, these were just not my thing.  I'm glad a tried the recipe, though!  Thanks for sharing, kaspmary!

First time i tried salt potatoes was in Syracuse. I had them every summer when I lived there. Since I'm from Texas I introduced salsa to the mix and it's great. Just dip them in the salsa and it's a party. I've made salt potatoes every summer since even though I no longer live in Syracuse.

My husband is from upstate New York and introduced me to salt potatoes on one of our visits. I would only ever get them once a yr. when we traveled there. I would purchase several bags of salt potatoes to bring home, then I got smart and realized I could do them on my own with new potatoes and salt. I am in love with salt potatoes, and if done properly they are not extremely salty.

I grew up with this recipe in upstate NY, with new potatoes that were in the ground just hours before. Make sure you do NOT peel or cut the potatoes; doing so will make the dish inedible. New potatoes are smaller than a chicken's egg; this recipe simply won't work with larger potatoes.  And use unsalted butter.

YAY! I LOVE salt potatoes (I'm from Syracuse, so I might be a bit partial); can't get them down South where I live now, though. So glad I found this so I know the right ratio of salt to potatoes! Now if I could just figure out how to make cheese curd like the Amish up in Pulaski...maybe transport some white hots down here...

they also make great home fries if you have some leftovers--yummy--reds are not the same as white--sorry but the reds do make a great potato salad with the skins on--yummy i take several bags to my nephew's in VA whenever i go visit him--also using sea salt is the only way to go--if the salt comes with them i only use about half of it-

These are great!  When made properly, they are amazingly creamy on the inside and very lightly crusted with salt on the outside.

I just used baby red fingerling potatoes for this.  They are suprisingly decent--not sure I'm sold on pouring that much salt into water then dumping it out, but for a simple dish, not bad.  I did as one reviewer suggested and let them sit--they really do form an outer salty crust, so you don't really need any salt or butter to add to them.  Definitely, though, these aren't something you want to use big potatoes for!  I'm not even sure I'm going to look at the sodium content for these and am glad I don't need to watch my sodium.  Not bad for a quick side dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was born and raised in Syracuse but I now live in Atlanta. I grew up with these potatoes mostly being served at the NYS Fair, block parties and cookouts. If you are in the area in August you should head there and grab some from the vendors. A better potato you won't find

I grew up in Upstate NY and love my salt potatoes although I changed up how I made them over the years.  I actually boil my potatoes in butter (salted) instead of water.  I also add a little extra salt because I prefer my 'salt potatoes' to actually have a salty flavor.  After moving to VA I discovered that although there are no baby potatoes to be found on a regular basis I can use fingerling potatoes and they're just as delicious. I also like to sprinkle a little parsley in the butter more for looks than anything else.

This was such an easy - delicious recipe. I grew up in Syracuse and these were a summer staple. I wish I could've gotten them a little more salt-encrusted though. Wonder if there are any tips out there for that?  I simmered the butter on the stove and made it nice and brown so it was a little caramelized- delish!

these didn't come out as I expected.. I used twice the amount of the salt too..  maybe my potatoes were too big?  either way they just tasted like regular potatoes although the skin was a bit salty.. will not be making again..

Yum!  These were great!  As a midwestern gal I had never had anything like these but I was pleasantly surprised.  These worked great with the "B" Red Potatoes that are always on sale at our grocery store. The smaller the potatoes the better so you get the best texture.

I love these potatoes.  They are so easy to make and very filling.  I am from Wayne County and my husband is from Miami.  He had never even heard of them before until I asked him yesterday.  I had to make them for him and I am so glad this recipe was here so he could experience the goodness!  Love it!

I live downstate so I had not come across these before. OMG...the flavor is amazing. I did add some parsley flakes and Mrs. Dash garlic/herb seasoning and the leftovers were so good! Now I know why I was never a fan of potatoes before...lack of flavor. Thanks for the recipe :-)

I am originally from  the Utica, New York area and grew up with these potatoes.  I just fixed them tonight for a lobster dinner we were having and they were a BIG hit.  They are easy to fix and are a real treat when paired with the lobster.  I will definitely be serving them again.

Way to salty for My Boyfriend and My Taste. I think it's just to much salt. The potatoes really soak up a lot of salt and ended up not good.

As someone who grew up in Syracuse, NY,  the amount of salt is 1 pound. If 1 1/2 C of salt is 1 pound, then fine. You just dump it in the pot with the potatoes and water. Do not poke the potatoes to see if they are done. When the potatoes are done, there is a nice crispy coating and the insides are creamy.

I used 1 c kosher salt to 6 c water.   Small uncut mix of red and white potatoes.  They were delicious and creamy inside.   So simple - definitely worth trying.

What many of the naysayers are probably missing, is that the spuds are not to be cooked at a fast 
/rolling boil. Once the water boils, cut the heat all the way down and just let them barely simmer.

These potatoes were a big hit.  
Make sure the potatoes skins are intact, so they don't absorb the salt, and they need to be about  the same size so that they cook at the same rate.  Any potatoes will do, but darker (red or purple) potatoes make the best presentation, because the salt shows up better on them.
I served my butter on the side.  I put garlic and finely chopped parsley or chives in the butter for more flavor.

I only had 1 pound of potatoes, so I used a heaping third of a cup of salt. The potatoes were incredibly creamy and this method of cooking is so easy. They weren't too salty at all, just perfect. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Super easy to make and delicious! As other reviewers have stated use the whole potato and do not cut them. I used baby reds. I only made 3lbs, so I cut the salt to 1 cup and they turned out perfectly. I will be making these again, the entire family loved them!

We have these potatoes every time we go to our daughter's house in Syracuse.  They are wonderful.
Now I make them at home.  I love to slice up the leftovers and fry them in butter for breakfast.

Sorry, I have not tried this recipe, but since I grew up on these having grown up just north of Syracuse I was so pleased to find them titled so I just had to say something. 

When I was a kid you could buy these in a bag and it came with 3 POUNDS of salt and a small bag of potatoes.  I YET LIVE!  lol

Here in Syracuse, NY, we have bags of them all summer, usually Hinderwadle's.  They are delicious with lots of butter.  I make home fries out of the leftovers...

I grew up on Salt Potatoes. As a child lived in Syracuse.   I made these tonight.  Skins did not crust like I remember, but, still so good.

I've made these potatoes 3 times now and everyone just loves them.  Made them just as the recipe says except I only cooked 2 pounds and halved the salt and butter. Try these, you'll be glad you did. Thank you for an amazing recipe.

Born in Batavia, NY with family outside Syracuse, we always had salt potatoes throughout the year but, most especially, at the annual family clambake. Thank you for submitting this recipe along with a little history. We moved out of NY many years ago and no one here had ever heard of salt potatoes.  Baby Reds are a must!!! Do NOT Cut the Potatoes! You will ruin then!!
