This recipe is REALLY good!  Here's a few things to possibly make it easier for whoever tries this next...

1)The step #2 is for the batter that coats the chicken

2)#1 is seperate, and is for the sweet and sour sauce

3)when you add the corn starch to the sauce with the water, COMBINE the water and corn starch first and THEN put it in so you don't get lumps. 

4)The batter looks kinda like pancake batter and it's OK it's supposed to be that way!

5)If you don't have self-rising flower just add 1/2t salt and 1 1/2t baking powder to your flower

6)If you want to save for leftovers DONT pour the sauce over the leftover chickens.  Keep them seperate and then pan-fry the chickens when you want them again to maintain the crispy outside.

Thanks - wonderful recipe, my husband and I will be enjoying this again soon!

I gave this 4 stars because the first time i made it, it was a horrible dissapointment. The chicken was bland and had no flavor. I decided to try again and tweeked it a bit and it turned out fantastic! The only thing i really did different was season the chicken liberally with salt, pepper, onion and gralic powder (after i had chopped it up) and let it set in the fridge for 30min-1hr. For the batter i skipped the cornstartch and since i didn't have self rising flour i added an extra 1/2tsp salt and 1.5tsp baking powder, and i added about 1tsp onion powder. The chicken itself was sooooo good. We were all eating it plain while i was cooking it. With these small changes it turned out amazing, tasted better than my favorite chinese place! When i want to make this for guests and don't want to spend an hour frying up the chicken i fry it up earlier in the day, throw it on a baking sheet and heat it up on 350 in the oven for about 15 min and its still crispy and yummy!

This is excellent! My hubby is picky about his asian cuisine, and he loved it! I made a few changes:  I kept the chicken, veggies, and sauce in separate bowls for serving.  Added 2 sliced carrots and 1/2 chopped onions to the green peppers and sauted them lightly. Added 2T soy sauce and the pineapple chunks to the s/s sauce.  Next time I will double the sauce batch though.  There wasn't enough for the amount of chicken pieces, for our tastes.  Served this over white rice with side of egg rolls.  A wonderful meal with awesome flavor.  We're sold on this one! Also: the kids loved the leftover chicken pieces for lunch as chicken nuggets w/ ketchup! This is a keeper!!

HELPFUL TIPS IN PREPARING:  1. Make the chicken ahead and save for whenever you will eat this dish. Heating in oven at 350 for 15 min. really does work and chicken is really crispy but that's really b/c the batter is so dang perfectly thick. DEFINITELY start with making the chicken batter, as described like pancake mix.  When cutting recipe in half, ALSO cut in half the chicken batter (1C water, flour, 1T cornstarch&oil, 1/2t salt, 1/5t baking powder, egg). I never have self-rising flour, so that's where the baking powder comes in.  2. The sauce is only good for about 4 chicken breasts, otherwise double the sauce.  It thickens up REALLY well, but as mentioned ...make sure the cornstarch is completely dissolved in water before adding it.  I keep the sauce on lowest setting until ready to eat.  3. Take some frozen veggies, fry in pan with some soy sauce for a great side dish!  4. My kids love the chicken w/o sauce, so they think it's chicken nugget night w/ketchup.  5. Tastes better to coat the chicken in sauce rather than dumping over, but only use the chicken you plan on eating so you can save the rest for leftovers.  Otherwise it gets mushy the next day when mixed in with sauce. I just reheat sauce while chicken is in oven for 15 min.

Pretty good recipe for a Chinese food lover like me.  Easy ingredients too!! BUT I think it should say from the begining to KEEP the Pinapple juice in a container for use in sauce.  I almost discharged mine!! AHh

Absolutely the best sweet and sour chicken recipe I've ever tried.  My husband and I thought it was delicious.  One comment about the directions:  the amount of water to add to the chicken batter is a little hard to interperate.  Make sure you only use 1 cup of water not 1 1/2 cups.

This recipe is authentic and tastes very similar to the restaraunt style sweet & sour chicken.  I probably will not make it again though because of the amount of work.  Great recipe.

Here's my modification if you don't like the extra calories in battered meat: Heat 1/2 tsp. sesame oil and 1 1/2 Tblsp vegetable oil until shimmering. Brown meat (chicken or pork cubes). Remove. Add vegetables (sliced carrots, onion, peppers) and saute. Lower heat, return meat to pan. Add sauce ingredients while stirring constantly. Lower heat to simmer and cover. Cook about 15 minutes until meat is cooked thoroughly but vegetables are still firm.  I NEVER add food coloring b/c I think it looks silly, and LOVE the flavor of the sesame oil. Sometimes dump in some fresh sliced tomatoes during the last 2-3 minutes, just long enough to heat through. You can also use shrimp in this recipe, but put them in at the very end and only cook a few min. or they will be tough.

my first thought when i tasted this: "oh my god, did i just make that??" this was amazing! the batter has a really good flavor. i added in extra pepper and salt. i served it with steamed white rice and stir fried vegetables (sliced onion, carrots and red pepper) in peanut oil. i added in just under 3/4 cup of sugar and the sauce was just perfect! this is a keeper -- great recipe, just as good as somethiing you'd get in a restaurant!

This was actually pretty good. I added orange juice and mandarin orange sections instead of orange food coloring. Also added scallions sliced into 2 inch pieces and water chestnuts for crunch. I used the light syup pineapple and mandarin orange syrup instaed of granulated sugar, and it came out beautifully. The pineapple and orange syrup add all the sweet plus extra fruit flavor. This recipe screams for a couple of fire cracker peppers too!

Fantastic and easy to prepare recipe.   My husband normally isn't a person to eat leftovers, but after eating this dish he ran for seconds and took the leftovers in his lunch as well.  Definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using the juice from a 20 oz. can of pineapple, but I still only used about 8 oz. of pineapple in the actual sweet and sour sauce.  I used one green bell pepper in the sauce, and it was plenty. After the sauce cooled down, I added green pepper and pineapple into it so the sauce would take on some of that flavor. I also seasoned the chicken before breading. For some reason when frying the chicken, mine didn't get very golden brown no matter how long I left it in the oil for. I fried egg rolls in the same oil, which came out perfectly golden brown, so I'm not sure what was up with that. The chicken also lost its crispiness as it sat while I was cooking all of it up.  I ended up having to throw them in the oven on 400 for about 15 minutes to get some of the crispiness back.  That's the only reason I gave this recipe a 4 star rating, and the fact that the ingredient list is written improperly.  The first ingredient on the list should be the first ingredient you use.  This has pineapple listed first, but then under the directions it has the water listed first.  It was a little confusing, and jumbled around, so be cautious when putting everything together.  I'd recommend closely following the "directions" part of the recipe, and only looking at the "ingredients" part when you absolutely need to. FYI everything listed above the chicken breast is for the sauce, everything below the chicken is for the breading.

Awesome recipe, best sweet and sour I've ever had - even from a restaurant. My husband is picky and he requests this, and our girls (also picky) like being able to just eat the chicken as nuggets if they don't feel like having sweet and sour chicken.  Tips: 

1) The amount of water you're supposed to add to make the batter is confusing, I just add water gradually until it is the texture of thick pancake batter.

2)  I season the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder after cutting it into cubes and let it sit while I prepare the batter.

3) Because I never have self-rising flour, I add 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder to the flour.

4)I make twice the amount of sauce - it's just not enough!

5) I have also used 1/2 pineapple juice, 1/2 mandarin juice to give it a little change.

6)  I use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar - tasty!

The ingredient list says "1 3/4 cups water, divided".  For those of you who are scratching your heads, as I was, it's not really to be divided, but rather, 1 1/2 cups water, plus 1/4 cup.  Oy.  I scratched my head till I read her directions here.

Mine got a little mushy, but it was still very yummy!
I didn't use orange food coloring, cause I didn't think we'd care about the color... but next time I will use it.  Something about the way it looks messes with your head!

This was delicious and very easy to make. I'm giving it 4 stars only because I had to make a few adjustments for my personal taste. For the sauce, I used 2-3 tbsp of red wine vinegar instead of 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar since no one in the family likes a strong vinegar flavor. I also added 2 tbsp of soy sauce to balance the sweetness. The sauce only took 5 minutes to make. Very easy! I quickly stir-fried some frozen "stir-fry" mixed veggies on the side (again about 5 minutes), and added the pineapple chunks to the sauce. The prep-time for the batter was about another five minutes, and frying the chicken (in 3 batches) took the most amount of time (maybe 30 minutes). This recipe is very easy to make, and on my first try, it took less than 1 hour. I used about 1/2 the chicken and 1/2 the batter but kept the sauce the same. If I increase the chicken amount in the future, I will certainly increase the amount of sauce. Everyone in my family loved this recipe! It's definitely restaurant quality, and I can't wait to make it again!

Thank you Linda for ending my search for restaurant-like sweet & sour. Yours is so much better! What really impressed me was the batter for the chicken. I haven't had much luck with this before. I made a lot of messes  and was never satisfied with the results until now. It was so easy to work with. It completly covered the chicken pieces & stayed intact when frying. As some of the others, I don't use self-rising flour so I had to add baking powder & salt to regular flour & the result was excellent. I used "Uncle Bill's Sweet & Sour Sauce" found on this website cause I had frozen pineapple juice that I need to use up. Now I am pondering all the wonderful things I can batter & fry like mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings (remove thin skin before battering), thick pickle slices (try it!), fish filets, shrimp...

This is a yummy, but labor intensive recipe.  I followed several reviewers suggestions and seasoned the meat before placing in batter.  Didn't have self-rising flour so used 1/2 tsp. baking powder and a little salt.  Liked the idea of holding the prepared meat in a seperate dish to keep the sauce from making it soggy.  This works for pork as well.

OMG!  This was so amazing!  The batter for the chicken is perfect and turns out so yummy!  No greasy at all!  I did make a few small changes.  I stir fried the pineapple and the bell peppers (I used red) with some other veggies (carrots, zucchini, yellow squash, onion, mushrooms, & celery) and some pepper, minced garlic and soy sauce.  When I served everything (family style) I kept it in separate bowls and let people decide how much sauce they wanted on their own plates.  It will make reheating the chicken easier too!    It is a great recipe and one that will make it into my rotation!  Even my picky kids (ages 8,6,4, 1) ate it up!

Oh, maybe 3 1/2 stars. This was good even though I didn't use the peppers. Were you supposed to add them raw? Didn't appeal to me. I used almost a whole 14 oz. can pineapple plus the juice from the can. I usually add some marachino cherries with some of their juice but didn't have any (it gives a nice flavor and color.) We thought it to be a little blande. I liked the sauce a little better from the sweet and sour pork 2 recipe from Mary Ann on this web site. I used only 6 chicken breast as others said it made a lot and I still got a lot!  Very time consuming to fry all that chicken, was okay batter. Don't mix chicken with the sauce or it gets real soggy. Note: this does not re-heat well from the cornstarh base,it gels and is almost impossible to melt and chicken looses it's flavor, so eat as much as you can at the first serving. Thanks Linda, we did enjoy it!

This recipe is really good, but be aware that it also includes the sweet and sour sauce, and that is what the first directions are for.  The sauce is the best I've made so far, and the chicken is very good too.  You don't really need the peppers, but I think it would taste better with the pineapple juice.  I always forget that part!  Also, this recipe is my top choice because most of the things you need are already in your cabinets!

This has to be the best sweet and sour chicken, ever....better than restaurant quality.  It was very time consuming, especially having to pan fry the chicken in batches as not to crowd or burn it.  But, the end result was absolutely worth every minute.  The chicken was crispy and light, without that greasy fry taste.  The sauce is sweet and simple.  Served with broccoli and fried rice, it was the perfect Chinese dinner.

Way better than take out. This is the best sweet and sour recipe I have found. I'm sure the recipe is great as is, but I did make a few minor changes which seemed to work well. Instead of pineapple chunks I used tidbits. I find the chunks to be overwhelming. Instead of chicken breast, I used boneless chicken thighs and I added 5 chopped green onion. Delish...

The last rating by smudson inspired me to try a real short cut. I barely defrosted 2 frozen chicken breasts, diced and tossed with olive oil, garlic salt and a dash of worcestshire (I was out of soy). In another bowl I diced baby carrots a medium bell pepper and added about 12 oz chunk pineapple, drained. Cooked the chicken a little then put in a bowl to the side. Cooked the the veggie mixture about 10 minutes, added 1 bottle of Kikoman sweet and sour, put the chicken back in and simmered until done. (about 10 minutes). Served over rice - fabulous!

This is just as good (if not better) than what you'd order at a Chinese food restaurant!  I've made this many times and follow the directions exactly with no changes.  It doesn't need any!  I will usually serve it with quick Chinese noddles, fried rice, or chow mein.  We LOVE this recipe!

WOW! This is SUPER. I followed the recipe; I just added carrots and onion,[ because we like those vegetables] Oh, also a little crushed red pepper flakes. [Just a tad bit of heat.] The Sweet and Sour sauce is wounderful,I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for a great recipe.

Batter was excellent-very crispy and fluffy. I'm not sure what other people do, but I found I had to add each individual batter-coated chicken piece to the hot oil to prevent one giant chicken clump from forming. (Side note-yes the batter is very thick! stays on the chicken very well) For the sauce, on the suggesstion of another user, The first time I made this I substituted distilled vinegar with rice vinegar I used 3 TBLS.-it was not as 'sour' or tangy as I like sweet and sour to be, since then I've just used distilled vinegar and like it much better (start with half and the keep adding until you're happy with the taste) I also add a really good squirt of concentrated lemon juice (the kind you buy at the store that's in the yellow plastic lemon-shaped bottle.) Just taste and adjust as you go and you can get it the way you like it. I added many more drops of red and yellow food coloring to get it the color that you see at restaraunts-two drops wasn't enough. I had no problem getting the sauce to thicken nicely (mix your water and corn starch together first before adding it to sugary mixture-helps prevent lumps).If sauce thickens up too much before you are done frying the chicken, just reheat and add a little water at a time until it reaches your desired thickness. We LOVE this dish- I've made it for my extended family and they all think it's better than take-out.

This is good, but the crust gets soggy after i let it rest for a while. It's not crunchy like the restaurant style. Anyone has any suggestion?

YUMMY!! I had to make copies n pass them out to all my guests! was a big hit. A word of advice: This does not reheat well.. so dont mix all the chicken with the sauce all at once.. mix it as required.

Fabulous! I have tried almost every "sweet and sour" packet mix in the store and they're always horrible.  This was exactly what I'd always been trying to achieve, and made with everything I already had in the kitchen.

This is definitely superior to the sweet and sour served at Chinese restaurants! I modified it to be gluten free and corn free to suit our food allergies - I never would've known by the taste or appearance of the food. Cornstarch got replaced by sweet rice flour, food coloring was replaced (per other reviews) with wheat-free tamari soy sauce, white vinegar was replaced with apple cider vinegar, and self-rising flour was replaced with a ratio of 1 cup GF all purpose flour blend + 1 1/2 t. Hain baking powder (it's corn-free) + 1/8 t. salt for each cup needed of self-rising flour. I didn't have 2 green bell peppers, so I used one green and one red bell pepper instead. Served over steamed jasmine rice. Absolutely phenomenal and going in our regular rotation!

OMG…can you say EXCELLENT!!  There is absolutely nothing that that has to change about this recipe…but of course I made slight changes anyway. As we at home like our food well seasoned, I seasoned the chicken cube pieces with the usual (onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper and Lawry’s season salt).  I also added garlic powder, onion powder, and Savory herbs to the batter mixture.  Lastly, I made a mistake (which turned out to be a good one) and used a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks (which means I had to add additional corn starch to ensure the sauce thickened appropriately).  This did yield a large amount though…will be plenty of leftovers (or invite guest).  Enjoy!

I just made this for dinner, and it was a HUGE hit!  My husband said I could teach the local Chinese restaurants a thing or two (lol).  I made a few changes, but nothing major.  1) I had a 20 oz can of pineapple and used all the juice from it 2) I used apple cider vinegar because it's all I had 3) Instead of food coloring I used juice from a jar of maraschino cherries 4) Didn't have self rising flour so I added an extra 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder.  5) Seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder 6) I didn't layer anything or use a pepper.  I just served white rice with the chicken and sauce.

This recipe was awesome!! The only change I made was to add some garlic powder to the batter.  One word of caution if you decrease the servings be careful because the amounts of the ingredients don't change in the actual directions. I also did not use a quart of oil more like a cup.  I cooked the chicken in two batches and put the completed batch in the oven to keep warm.  This also make a ton of sauce.

Amazing as is. Only change I made - double the sauce and omit the food coloring. I also add onion to the peppers. Yum. Love that I have the ingredients on-hand, too. So much cheaper (and probably healthier) than restaurant version!

This recipe is really tasty!  The batter sounded like it would add a lot of calories, so I did not batter the chicken.  I just seasoned it with white pepper and a dash of ground ginger.  I poured a bit of the pineapple juice and a bit of soy sauce over the chicken and let it sit for about 10 minutes while I cooked the sauce.  Then I stir-fried it with a bit of teriyaki sauce, the green peppers, and some coarsely chopped onion.  I drizzled just a bit of the sauce over the chicken mixture, again to keep down the calories - but that was enough to add a lot of flavor.  A great recipe that I'm already envisioning making again next week or the week after!

Absolutely love this recipe!!! Delicious!! I added green onions and red peppers for more color and taste. I cooked the peppers and onions in olive oil for 5 minutes before adding them. I also added a little garlic powder to the batter and to the sauce. Oh and I didn't have any orange food coloring... so I used yellow :-) YUM!

This was really good, almost perfect for me. The only thing I found wrong with it was that the sweet and sour sauce didn't have quite enough flavor. I think next time I'll try adding maybe a little orange juice or maybe use more pineapple juice in place of some of the water.

All I can say is yum! This exceeded my expectations, the batter created this crunchy coat round the chicken and was delicious by itself after I took the advise of others and seasoned my chicken with salt and pepper. I must admit that if I had not read some reviews probably to making it, the batter may have been a complete disaster. The batter will be very thick and sticky and you may think that your batter isn't adhering to the chicken but trust me when I say that it will puff with barely anything on it as long as it has been dipped in the batter. I cooked my chicken probably an hour before we had dinner, and just before serving it I placed it in the oven on 200 degrees for about 15 minutes and the coating was still crunchy. Also I didn't have orange food coloring and had to use red (about 8 drops) for it not to look so pink after the slurry was added. But aside from that my family really enjoyed it, thanks Linda.

This dinner recipe was a mess. Literally. By the end of the evening my entire house smelled like a nasty grease factory, and just about everything surrounding the stove was covered in grease. It took us two days to get the house totally aired out. The prep time is longer than you'd expect. The food tasted good for a few minutes - until it started to settle.  If you're craving some chinese food, save yourself the time, cleanup and stomachache and call for take out.

This was probably the best sweet and sour chicken I've ever had!! My whole family LOVED it! I followed ChefJoy's suggestions and it turned out great.  I suggest - Make the chicken first. Pan fry the chicken (coated w/ batter) in lots of veggie oil. THEN bake it (350 for 15 min) while you make the sweet and sour sauce. Literally the chicken looked like chicken nuggets from McDonalds and tasted AMAZING even w/o the sauce. Very very good. Served this with white rice and egg rolls. YUMMY!

We really enjoyed this! Instead of using self-rising flour, I used All-Purpose and added 1 tablespoon of baking powder and an extra teaspoon of salt as a substitute. This a lot of chicken so I didn't pour the sauce over all of it to keep it from getting mushy. The chicken re-heated well in a toaster convection oven (375 F) and added the sauce after re-heating. As for the sweet and sour sauce, it was mild, which I personally prefer. Mild in that you can taste the flavors. My husband prefers the stuff that is, in my opinion, overpowering and too sweet. The recipe calls for 2 drops of food coloring. I used the super concentrated stuff for cake decorating and it took several more drops and still only ended up a pretty pineapple gold. If you use the regular food coloring found in most supermarkets, it will take far more food coloring. I prefer not to use food dyes, but one reviewer mentioned that it was a grayish color- doesn't sounds appetizing!

This was pretty good.  I liked the way the chicken was crunchy on the outside but stayed moist on the inside.  I have come to a conclusion though that I just can't make chines like the local take out.  I think that I will just stick with that and use it for those nights I dont want to cook.  I recently made these again and just went and got some store bought sweet n sour from the asian store and it was great.  I served buffet style with asian beef skewers, cream cheese wontons, shrimp eggrolls, egg drop soup, and korean cookies and sticks dipped in choco sprinkled with almonds.. My kids are still talking about it today.

we have not been eating Chinese for a very long time because we believe there is no good Chinese food around here so I decided to make myself some; this is absolutely GOOD, I will make it over and over again. Who needs Chinese restaurants when you can make something BETTER?? Thanks!!!

I've tried since college to make this. THIS IS IT!  BETTER than the local delivery/restaurant. I let the batter set for about 45-60 min while waiting for family to get home from work/school. It was the best "mistake" ever. Very fluffy this way - and the batter isn't overwhealming in taste or texture. Must have the red/orange food color or the young people get picky & confused about the color of the sauce. It's not too sweet either. Perfect. It's really not as much work as some have stated and leftovers do well if you re-heat in a frying pan (no oil) as some have suggested here. My extremely picky 10yr old step son had leftovers for breakfast!!! (Served with Amber's Sesame Chicken from this site and steamed veggies.)

I threw this supper together tonight in a rush.  But it was GOOD.  It is so close to the restaurant that my husband and i love.  It could use more vinegar and sugar.  But i could have diluted it a bit, i made the recipe times 3.  I wanted extra sauce.  Anyhow...this is really good.  Best recipe yet!!!!!!

This tastes just like resturant made sweet and sour chicken!  Very very good.  I would say cut down on the sauce though.  I always use half and it's still a lot.

This was pretty good.  The health conscious part of me didn't batter and deep fry the chicken - just fried it a little in a wok and it's still great.

Delicious!!! I love the batter on the chicken, and we added the pineapple to the sauce, along with some red and green peppers, naturally turned the sauce orange, and pureed it all!!! It is delicious!~!!!

I made a half-batch. I added a small white onion, which I sauteed with the pepper and pineapple (seasoned with salt, pepper and granulated garlic) rather than serving them raw; I think this would also be good with carrot and mushroom added. I used Splenda in place of sugar in the sauce, and all-purpose flour (with 3/4 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt) in place of self-rising flour in the batter. I also skipped the food coloring, and seasoned the uncoated chicken with salt, black pepper and granulated garlic. (I've never seen 8oz cans of pineapple, but for those who are wondering, 1 8oz *cup* of canned pineapple yields 181g flesh and 68g/approx 1/3 cup juice, while the standard American 20oz can yields 2.5 times that amount.)

I used pork instead of chicken and it came out great. I would also use it as a dipping sauce for egg rolls.

This was very good. I did add a little more sugar to the vinegar and pineapple juice as it was a bit tart at first. Also the next time I make this I will be sure to make the sauce AFTER I have started frying the battered chicken, that way the sauce will be hot when I pour it on everything else.

This recipe was delicious! I cooked it by myself and it was a little stressful trying to get the different parts done at the same time, but it wasn't too bad and with more experience/one extra person to help it would be very easy! Instead of the vegetables suggested I used red peppers, onions, carrot slivers, and of course pineapple. I sauteed all the vegetable and mixed the sauce in and kept the chicken separate. I served it with rice. It tasted just as good as any restaurant. Highly impressed with this recipe!

A+. A true crowd pleaser, and it was relatively easy and to prepare.

A few notes and observations:
1) I added some cayenne and crushed red pepper flake, as well as a little salt, to the sauce. The infusion of heat really makes a difference. I also used vinegar steeped with various chili peppers for an extra hint of heat.
2) The sauce may taste starchy at first, but don't worry, as the flavors will all come together once the entire dish is put together and the starchiness will be gone.
3) I also added cayenne, onion powder, and crushed red pepper flakes to the batter for the chicken. The hint of onion really complemented the chicken and the sauce. 
4) I added an extra 1/3 cup water to the batter, as I found it too thick and viscous to put the chicken chunks in.
5) I stir fried the bell peppers and pineapple for a couple of minutes in some salt, pepper, and rice wine before assembling the entire dish together. Stir frying helps bring out the smoky sweetness of the bell pepper.

I will definitely make this dish again. :)

Chicken was perfect!!  I just now noticed that I forgot the egg!!  I guess it really did not matter.  Just be sure to season the chicken first.  I also took the extra batter and mixed in onion flakes, parlsey, and garlic for some additional chicken pieces and it makes the chicken quite awesome!!  Will make again!!

Finally!  Sweet and sour chicken like my favorite chinese take-out--only better.  Way better!  

I used chicken strips which fried up crisp outside and most inside in no time at all. Helps to do some prep work (cut up, batter, and refrigerate chicken at least 30 minutes). Honestly, this took no time at all.  

To finish, I sauteed quartered onions wedges, added the pineapple, tossed in the fried chicken strips; then, added a bit more pineapple juice to moisten, covered until  reduced. Red bell peppers would have added color to this dish ... but I had none.

Serve over rice, top w/ sauce.

Pay no attention to the "not so good reviews". This was outstanding. a bit time consuming, but awesome! i didnt have orange food coloring, had to use yellow. i like the idea, as it gives it a nice appetizing color. Made with homemade egg rolls, and i got a huge roar from the crowd when served. Will make again and again!

WOW. This recipe is a lot of prep and mess and dirtied dishes for a meal that does not taste great. It was good, but not one of my favorites, and definitely not good enough to go to all that trouble again. The batter was messy and fell off the chicken while frying, making the whole frying process completely pointless.

Amazing recipe.  I can no longer order from our local chinese restaurant, because this is so much better!  I leave out the food coloring in the sauce and add about 1/4 cup ketchup, adds color and flavor!  The batter on the chicken is fantastic!  Even my picky kids love it when I make "chinese chicken".  Have used this recipe over and over.  Thank you!

As most reviews, I too thought this was excellent!  The whole family loved it!  I too the suggestions of others and seasoned both the chicken and the breading with fresh ground garlic seasalt and fresh ground pepper.  I started by adding only 1 cup water to the batter then added another 1/4 cup water for consistency.   Also used all purpose flour, adding baking powder and salt as a substitute to self rising flour.  I will definitely make this again!

This was absolutely delish! It was very easy to prepare, the only thing I changed was the seasoning.. I found that you MUST season the chicken and the batter , or it'll be bland. I used Onion powder, garlic powder, salt, accent, and pepper.... It was so dang good!

WOWEEE this is some good stuff! After making this, I was pretty excited that I actually pulled it off.......and my husband couldn't stop complimenting me!!  I will DEFINITELY make this again.....in fact, I think i'll make the sauce ahead of time and keep it in a jar so I don't have to mess with it when making the chicken.  Thanks SO much for the recipe!!!

THIS TURNED OUT VERY WELL. I LOVE THE BATTER-FRIED SHRIMP. I DID INCREASE SALT SLIGHTLY AND USED SOME KETCHUP INSTEAD OF FOOD COLORING. SINCE THIS MADE IT SLIGHTLY SWEETER, I CUT BACK ON PINEAPPLE A LITTLE.GREAT RECIPE !

This was VERY good!!  The sweet and sour was a little too sour for me, so I added just a little more sugar.  My DH said we should bottle the sauce and always keep some on hand.  I followed the recipe as it was written, except that I didn't have self rising flour, so I followed the suggestions from others and added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  Worked great, will definetely be making again.

Great recipe only thing too much work unless you are off that day (I'm lazy on my work days).  It is surely worth the effort. I did follow some of the suggestions since I only had regular flour so I added more salt and baking soda to the batter mix and seasoned the chicken pieces, also added in some chili pepper flakes as my family likes things a little bit spicy.  Thanks for sharing.

Can I just say that I am officially addicted to this!!!  It's become a WEEKLY family favorite.  Even my 16mo baby loves this. I followed another reviewer's advice and marinate the chicken in garlic salt and powder for about 30 min. It makes it so much tastier. I've tried this also using shrimp and it is awesome!!!

My first sucessful sweet and sour chicken.  This was excellent.  Easy to make.  The sweet and sour sauce was perfect in flavor.  Hubby really liked it - not to sweet, just right.  I added yellow and red food color to make it look orange.  I also added green and red peppers and pineapple chuncks to the sweet and sour sauce.  I did have to add more cornstarch and water to the sauce to get the consistancy that I like,we like our sauce a little bit thicker.  I only used 4 chicken breasts and seasoned as other reviewers suggested.  I also did not have self-rising flour and added baking powder and salt to regular flour.  I put the cut up chicken in the batter and refrigerated for 1/2 hour before frying, don't know why I did this.  I just remember doing this when I made the coconut chicken from this site so the batter would stick to the shrimp better.  The batter was nice and thick and stuck to the chicken perfectly. I don't have a deep fryer, so I just put oil in a pan and fried each side until golden brown.  This made plenty, fed four adults who each had 2 good size helpings and there is left overs for at least 2.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for the great recipe.

This was a great recipe for an at home dinner with a take-out taste.  A few things that might be helpful to others. Do make the sauce first (it will keep its heat for a pretty long time). If you use pineapple chunks that are packed in juice (not syrup), you will need to add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup more sugar to the sauce (yes, it should say keep juice for sauce and the amount of sugar added depends on how sweet you are used to). Do mix water and cornstarch together and mix in AS SOON AS the sugar mixture comes to a rolling boil and then let boil a few mins (2-3) before turning off heat. Oh, I did not have orange food color so I used five drops red and two drops yellow and ended up with a color similar to that at restaurants.  I halved the chicken (three large breast) and batter (used AP flour with more salt and some baking powder) with great results.  Last of all, I sauteed half a red bell pepper and one carrot for about 5-7 mins and added my pineapple and cooked 2 more mins.  I served this mixture, sauce, chicken, and steamed rice in separate bowls so that people could mix to their liking. Really wonderful and worth the time! Happy cooking!!

A very good Sweet and Sour Chicken Recipe. My husband absolutely loves it... much better than most Chinese restaurants. One tip, if you like your chicken tender like me, soak the breasts in buttermilk for a few hours before cooking.

The sauce is a little bland, but tastes fantastic if you add a little sweet chili sauce.

This is for the chicken only, which I've made twice. I haven't made the sauce yet.  I made my own self rising flour (there is a recipe on this site for it)and omitted the white pepper as I didn't have any but will certainly include it if I ever remember to pick some up. Just mixed the batter and plopped the chicken chunks in and got them good and covered.  They seem gloopy but as long as the oil is the right temp the batter will set right up when it hits the oil. I did have some trouble with burning my first batch but I after playing with the temp I worked it out. I fried them in about an inch to an inch and a half of oil in a deep fry pan over medium (made sure to give oil plenty of time to get hot).  You'll need to do them in batches.  They took probably 5-7 minutes and I turned them once then drained on paper towels.  These were absolutely restuarant quality - just like you get at a chinese restuarant.  For leftovers they get pretty soggy but if you nuke them for a minute and then throw them in a 400-450 oven for a few minutes they'll crisp right up again.  I'll definitely be making them again.  My guests were impressed when I told them I was whipping them up in the kitchen and not running out for take out and once you get the temp right they really are a snap to make.

I thought this was fantastic! A great and relatively easy fix for my sweet and sour cravings. And far more affordable! I added a touch of garlic powder to the chicken batter. And I might put slightly less sugar in the sauce next time. 

Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe & Dish is so amazing, just like in the Chinese buffets, only better. The only thing I did differnt was add less water for a thicker batter, turned out nice and cripy and thick. Unlike some batters that slide off and aren't coated this one was coated PERFECT & CRISP. The Sweet And Sour Sauce is truly amazing. This is deff a keeper. Thank you!

This was delicious!  My whole family agreed that it was better than take out!  I had to do a little "tweaking" to the sauce to get it how we like it, (not too much vinegar).  I also took the suggestion from EE2ME and SHELLS and added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt to my flour mixture, because I didn't have the self rising flour.  Worked perfectly!  With the left over batter, we made dough balls and covered them with cinnamon and sugar!

Oh My Goodness! This was top notch! My family is swearing they will never go out for Chinese again. This sauce was wonderful. I actually used crushed pineapple in it and it was easy and fantastic. Before dicing the chicken, I  boiled it for about 10 minutes. It helped to cut in uniform pieces easier. I served this with House Fried Rice from this site. It was a VERY impressive meal. Thank you Linda. Who knew we could make such an authentic tasting dish right here at home.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes the second time I fixed it though, I didn't fix the vegetables and substitued the House Fried Rice recipe from this site.  I found that the chicken was somewhat dry with very little flavor the first time (my taste), so I marinated the whole chicken breasts in Italian Dressing for about 6 hours or so, prior to cutting them into the cubes.  I drained them, and blotted them dry a bit so that the batter would adhere to them.  Like other reviews, I kept the sweet/sour sauce and meat separate, putting out additional bowls of soy and hot sauce as well, allowing everyone to pick and choose.  Awesome!!!!!

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  My fiance and I go to a Chinese place about 25 minutes from our house and now we don't have to go anymore because this sweet and sour chicken tastes JUST LIKE IT! Awesome recipe! I made everything just as recipes says and it turned out perfect! Wouldn't change a thing!

This recipe turned out exactly like I remember it tasting at our favorite restaurant as a kid.  I used pineapples in juice, which turned out fine, and I added the green peppers, pineapple, and onions (and some carrots) to the sauce as it cooked.  I kept the chicken separate from the sauce until we actually put it over rice, so it stayed crispy, and we stored the leftover chicken pieces in the fridge separately.  They were still crispy the next day.  This was a really good recipe.

Great recipe. I did tweak it just a bit.  I substituted 1 cup of Tempura for the flour just to keep it crispy and light turned out great. Loved the sauce!

Excellent for satisfying our cravings for Chinese cuisine.  Have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and I only have leftovers when I add to the amount of chicken in the recipe. We prefer to dip the chicken in the sauce, so I only serve 1/2 at a time, freezing the other 1/2 for the next time we make this. Reheat the sauce (50%) in the microwave and use a small whisk to smooth it. To cut down on the spattering we use our lidded deep fryer with the basket removed (coated chicken will stick to the basket) and fresh oil. A family favorite and frequent request with the kids' friends.

EXCELLENT!! Not at all time consuming to make.  I changed one thing in the recipe though..Instead of cornstarch I used baking powder.  It makes the batter more puffy.

We thought that this was an excellent recipe and will use it frequently.  I made a few changes.  I microwaved the green peppers and two sliced carrots for 2 minutes and added to chicken and sauce and tossed with Lychee nuts (a chinese favorite) instead of the pineapple.  I also only used a small amount of canola oil to fry the chicken in.  Great!!  Love allrecipe.com.  Connie Small

I baked the chicken instead of frying it and I added the green pepper and pineapple right into the sauce and it was great.  This is a wonderful recipe!

My husband and I made this last night and loved it. The only changes I made to the recipe were we found the vinegar way to intense and the sauce not quite sweet enough for our tastes so I added additional sugar (roughly about 1/4 cup) and cooked sauce a few minutes to dissolve. I also used red food coloring instead of orange. The additional sugar cut the strength of the vinegar and the sweet and sour sauce turned out perfect. I served our sauce in little bowls as a dipping sauce so that our left over chicken could be warmed up the next day and not be soggy. The leftover sauce gets very thick once cold and stays thick when warmed back up but retains it's wonderful flavor. Will be adding this recipe to my favorite recipes from now on. I didn't bother with using chunk pineapple (didn't have any)so I just used the juice from a can of crushed pineapple and will be using the pineapple in an upside down cake later. Thanks Linda for a great recipe.

The chicken part of the recipe was amazing!! It fried up in my wok and looked better then the take home by a long shot. The batter was light and had wonderful flavor. I didn't care much for the sauce so I used the one on here called WOW sweet and sour. My husband and I could not get enough of the combination of these two recipes. This was hands down the BEST S&S Chicken either of us have ever eaten.

I have to say that this recipe was the best I have ever had. I did add to this recipe tho, I did add more salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and ground ginger to the batter ( to my taste). I cut up both green and red pepper and also added onion and and then I cut up 3/4 of a orange as well and added to this. For the sauce  I added orange juice from a orange and then cut up about 1/4  of the orange and added to the sauce and I added red food color instead of orange, I also had to add more cornstarch to this to make it thicker ( to your preference). Whomever wants to give this recipe lower then 5 stars just don't know what good food is! Just saying

Hubby really loved this and that is the reason for the 5 stars.  For me, it was good, but it was a lot of work and I wasn't impressed with the sauce.  There is so much cornstarch that it becomes gelatinous and the orange food coloring just looks fake.  This has to be served immediately as the breading gets soft in a very short time frame.

This was my first attempt at really frying anything with batter, and suffice it to say that it didn't go well. It's not the recipe's fault, I'm sure, but it was pretty much a total disaster; the best I can say is that I didn't fill the kitchen with smoke :( I had to cook the chicken in four batches because I didn't have a big enough skillet, so it took me HOURS. The first batch I didn't cook enough, but somehow the batter all stuck to the bottom of the pan and burned. The second batch, I compensated by completely overcooking. I was ready to give up after that, but I had a big thing of chicken and sauce that I hated to just throw out. The third and fourth batches looked slightly better than the other two, but the consistency of the batter just isn't quite right, and I don't know why. I guess I'll have to try this again when I'm a little more experienced.

Delicious! I took advice of others and doubled the sauce which was def a good idea. My husband was running late from work the night I made this and the chicken cooled off by the time he arrived. I took another poster's advice and popped it in the oven for 15 min at 350 degrees F. Perfect solution! Followed the recipe exactly. My husband and I both loved it! Will for sure make again. Oh, forgot to mention that I took another's advice and flavored the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder when I cut them into chunks and marinated for an hour in the fridge. I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder in the flour mixture. I would suggest doing this as it will give the chicken more taste.

I really enjoyed this recipe!! Absolutely delicious! My father is VERY picky about sweet and savory dishes and he loved it. A Home run. The batter is superb! A few tweaks* I marinated my chicken with onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper and chicken bouillon. It would have been tasteless without it. I also cooked the greens peppers with diced onions and added the pineapple chunks and a 1/2 tsp of salt. I plan on cooking the chicken and the pineapple glaze as an appetizer at a party I'm having next week. I know it will be a hit.

We loved it. I swear it was just like its supposed to be.  I used the frozen breaded chicken pieces to save time and cutting out step 2 entirely. I also chopped up some red and orange peppers. That was a nice add. When I make it next time I will cut back on the sugar, it was a bit too sweet with the pineapples and all that sugar. Ready in NO time if using the frozen chicken pieces.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and I loved it!  The only thing I would do differently next time is up the vinegar to 3/4 cup.  It was not nearly tart enough for my taste.

the flavour of the batter and the sauce was very good but I added about 2 tbsp of  vinegar to the batter to make it lighter. I also thought the batter was too thick and would make the batter to chicken ratio too high so i added an extra 1/2 cup water to thin it out a bit. I also used Chinese rice vinegar in  the sweet and sour sauce. If you use Chinese white rice vinegar, it will not be as tart. Chinese white vinegar, found in most grocery stores in the Asian aisle, is less acidic and milder in flavour.   This will be my go-to recipe for s and s chicken/pork. *you can use 1/4 cup ketchup instead of food colouring*

I tried this and it is good, although I have had tastier sauce. I love the batter recipe! also I think if I make it again I may marinate the chicken in soy sauce or something before coating it in batter.

I basically used this recipe for the sweet & sour sauce.  I didn't add the food coloring and it came out great!  Instead of deep frying the chicken, I just sauteed it in a little olive oil.  Also, I served it with brown rice couscous.  It was delicious.

This is the second time I've made this recipe this week.  My boyfriend and I love it.  The sauce is a little too tangy for me so I just add a little bit more sugar and salt or soy sauce.  Make sure to fry up the chicken pieces in batches, otherwise it won't brown and get crispy.  Thanks for this awesome recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

If you follow the directions and dont try to take short cuts this is a fantastic dish.  I tried making my life simpler by the chicken in the sauce and it just thickened up the sauce and made it taste to floury.... did it right the second time around and it taste much better.  On a side note.... dont let your 5 year old pick out the color the sauce should be b/c mine picked out blue and it made it very hard to find appealing LOL.

This recipe was excellent!!  Hands down the best sweet and sour recipe I've ever come across, and I dont plan on looking for another one!! Since there is only 3 of us we halved the recipe and that still gave us a lot of left overs!! This is a must try!

I needed a good oriental style batter mix for some boneless, skinless chicken thighs and this recipe was fantastic.  I added a little hot pepper flakes to the batter to spice it up a little and the final texture was perfect.  I did fry it in a combination of 1/2 c peanut oil and 2 tbl lard for added flavor.  I didn't try the sweet & sour portion of this recipe because I had a commercial brand that I wanted to try, but next time I will definitely come back to this recipe.

My chicken turned out a little soggy but it may just be my frying skills.  The sauce though was delicious!!  I loved it!!

Best Sweet and Sour Chicken Recipe I've ever made. Have tried a lot.  I found though that by using 1/4 cup white vinegar and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, it really adds to the sauce.

this recipe deserves nothing less than 5 stars, it's amazing exactly as it...i tend to change things up when I check out recipes, add a litttle here, take a little there, after reading the reviews I decided to NOT alter this and I am glad I didn't, it really is perfect, I've been using the betty crocker recipe for years and it was ok, but betty aint got nothing on this one....seriously perfect recipe

Great recipe! I have made this with and with out the breading/batter. My family preferred the breading but I liked it with out because of the time and calories that it saved. Remember to leave the peppers out until the last part of cooking....less soggy and a slight crisp!

Halved the breading mixture for 2 chicken breasts. Seasoned chicken with salt, pepper, garlic & onion powders before breading. Made way too much sauce for us.

the batter was bland but the sauce was really good.Next time I'll just omit the batter step.It's just added calories that does'nt help the dish enough.not to mention prep time and clean up will be drastically reduced.

My husband, oldest son, mother-in-law and I loved this! It has good flavor and we all agree that it is a keeper. My picky 14 year old son didn't like it as much. He refused to eat the green pepper and sweet and sour sauce. However, he did eat the batter dipped chicken cubes. Next time, I will make him his own batch of chicken because he ate a lot of our chicken. Also, I didn't have self rising flour so I had to find a recipe to make it using All Purpose Flour. It is really easy to make self rising flour. For each cup of all purpose flour, you add 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Then mix to combine. This sweet and sour chicken is really good served over chicken rice.

Cut the chicken in to small, bite sized pieces.  Do not cover all of the chicken in sauce as the leftovers will be mushy.

My two sons (19 and 21) are very picky about their chicken dishes.  A 'nugget' has to be perfect and the breading has to be top notch>>>One bite of this and they were sold.  This is their new fave and frequently requested.  I have to admit....I just fell in love with this!>>>Although I am not fond of the Sweet and Sour sauce and will tweak it...I can't snub my nose at it!  I'm just particular with my sauce.>>>FANTASTIC!

Fantastic recipe, we all loved it, even my 5 year old exclaimed, "I pronounce this dinner delicious!" :) What helped me during cooking: *Unlike other commenters, I did not find this took long to cook at all. All up it was 40 minutes start to finish. ** I had trouble thickening the sauce. I had just enough cornstarch, so couldn't add more, so I used a thickening trick from making gravy. When I sauteed veggies (bell pepper, carrot, onion) to add to the sauce I threw a handful, maybe 1/3 cup, of regular flour over them at the last minute. I brought the whole thing to a boil again after adding the veggies. *** I do not have a thermometer for oil, so I had no idea what temp to turn my stove to. On MY stove, the right temp for this turned out to be MEDIUM. I started at med-high and it was too hot. I went just below medium for about half the time and halfway through turned it up to just above medium to keep the temperature constant. Each piece of chicken (about 1"X1"X0.5") took only approx. 2 minues per side.
***That's it! I think beyond that everyone's tastes are slightly different. I added veggies, and a bit of ketchup to the sauce, and spiced the chicken before battering; but none of that is necessary. This is still a great recipe with or without accessories.

I used more pineapple juice and less water. Used Perdue Chicken Nuggets and used sliced onions. It was so awesomely good!!! Why go to my Chinese restaurant when I can make it as well as she does. I even dyed it orange :) Thanks so much!!!!

Don't waste your time with any other recipe for sweet and sour chicken--this one is IT. I followed the recipe exactly (well, I had to add baking powder to my regular flour), and like someone else said earlier I was amazed that I made it! It may have been a bit time consuming, but completely worth the effort. Thank you for the recipe!

I just got done cooking and eating this for dinner for the first time, and it was a hit with all 3 of my kids as well as my husband. I had to modify the sauce some because I didn't have some of the things it called for, and I didn't have time to run to the store and get it. I had a big 20 oz. can of pineapple so I doubled the sauce. I didn't have enough white sugar so I ended up using a little bit of brown sugar. I also didn't have food coloring so I used about 1/4 cup of ketchup for a little color. Those 2 changes to the sauce gave it a nice yellowish orange color. Everyone thought the sauce was great especially when eating it with the chicken. As for the chicken I seasoned the pieces with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I also seasoned the batter that way as well. The chicken tasted really good, but as others said it is a bit time consuming to cook. Now I have a bunch of dirty dishes that I am dreading to do, but the meal was very good!

My daughter and I made this last night using thin strips of pork instead of chicken. We also sauteed some onions, green pepper, and one clove of garlic before adding the wet ingredients to the pan. It was better than take-out. It's a little time consuming to fry meat. It would be much quicker with a deep fryer. But either way, it was well worth it. This recipe will definitely be included in the recipes I pass on to my daughter

This is great! As I was preparing the sauce I thought it would taste too much like vinegar, but it was perfect. The chicken batter combined with the sauce makes this taste professional. Will definitely make again!

Wonderful recipe!  To cut down on caleries (and time!), I just pan fried the chicken with a little olive oil and seasoned with garlic salt.  After the chicken was done, I mixed it into the sweet & sour sauce along with the pineapple.  All was done in the 20 minutes it took to cook the rice!

I made this last night and followed the recipe to a T except I cut all ingredients in half. (still a LOT of chicken) I seasoned my cut meat real well and refrigerated for a while. It was a BIG hit in my house - everyone chomped it down and I still had leftover meat for chicken nuggets or just to serve as the meat in another meal. Very, very good & crunchy. I let everyone put there own sauce on at the dinner table also. YUMMY!

My husband really liked this, but my girls and I did not.  Taste was fine, but a little too sweet for my liking.  Maybe if I had only lightly drizzled the sauce over the chicken pieces that would have made it better.  But I served over a bed of rice and topped the chicken with about 1/4 cup of sauce.  Too much!  But the flavor was good, and I can see using less of the sauce to make it better.  If you really enjoy sweet and sour dishes, this would be fine, I just am not a fan of sweet with my meat.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's nice to mix dinner up a bit.

Very Good.  Make sure you mix the water and corn starch before adding to sauce.  Had tons of clumps when I added the corn starch directly.

Incredible! I didn't have any self rising flour so I made some by adding 3 1/4 tsp of baking powder and 1 1/8 tsp salt to all purpose flour. Everything else I followed exact! These taste exactly like what we get from our local Chinese restaurants. I have been searching everywhere (even on allrecipes) for this exact flavor! Thank You LINDAHU!!!

Great recipe. Make sure you season the chicken pieces before adding to batter so they don't taste so bland. Will definitely make again.

Very good.  The only change I made was to add the baking powder & salt  since I did not have any self-rising flour.  It was alot of work, but worth it.

Was absolutely delicious. Added onion and garlic powder to the batter for extra kick. The only thing I will do differently in the future is refridgerate the batter so that when it hits the oil it sticks more to the chicken.

This was a big hit in my house!  The kids, not big on S&S Chicken, ate the chicken plain, like chicken nuggests.  My husband and I really enjoyed this with sticky rice!  We're currently stationed in Korea, so this rivaled some of the Chinese style restaurants we've been to here!  I also didn't have the self rising flour, so used regular flour with a dash of salt and some corn starch.  I also soaked the chicken in buttermilk for about an hour prior to breading and cooking to keep it moist during cooking.

This recipe was delicious. It does however take  a very long time to prepare.  I had trouble keeping the batter on the cooked chicken pieces (batter too thick? too thin?). For a small family of four this was too much chicken so I will definitely cut it at least by half the next time I make it.  The sweet and sour sauce was just right. I used another reviewer's idea of marachino cherry juice for coloring--great idea.  All in all it was a good meal and I would like to make it again. It is very time consuming though.

The recipe was great...I would not recommend that you put the sauce all over the chicken! It becomes way to soggy...Also, it takes forever to make so, be prepared...

This was really delicious, after following some of the suggestions.  I would agree-stir frying the veggies a bit before adding was a good idea.  I appreciate the tip for not adding all the chicken--I loved it all mixed together, but my husband preferred less sauce on his.      The extra spices on the chicken as suggested in some reviews got rave reviews on its own.  My only complaint is the sauce was a little bland, the result, I think, of the pineapple "juice" in the can being too watery.  I easily fixed that by turing the heat back on to the lowest setting to let the sauce thicken/concentrate a bit more, and added 1 smashed clove of garlic and a peeled and smashed 1 in. cube of ginger and simmered it while the chicken was cooking (discard both ginger and garlic before serving).  This helped improve the flavor; next time I'll crush a bit of the pineapple to make "juice" for a bit more flavor.

This worked out great for me.  The sauce was DIVINE!  You can absolutely forget about it on the stove, once you put the cornstarch mixture in.  Mine sat over very low for at least half an hour, with no ill side effects.  I did leave out the peppers and the chunks of pineapple, as no sweet and sour chicken I've ever had in any Chinese restaurant had them in it.  Also, I didn't have any orange food coloring, so I used a few drops of red and a few drops of yellow.  I wonder if there's a way to get that color naturally?  I considered not adding the food coloring, because, let's face it, the sauce would taste the same without it.  But, in the end, I couldn't leave it like that, so I added it.  I think next time I may use the pineapple chunks, because they look really good in the picture.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very simple and easy dish, but don't let that turn you off!  I was very impressed with how this dish turned out.  For a fresher (and slightly healthier) option, juice a fresh pineapple instead of using canned pineapple.  A little granish goes a long way with simple dishes like this :)

I didnt have food coloring, so I used 2 TBL of ketchup and added 3 TBL soy sauce to the sauce. I used the what it called for for sugar and vineger...it was too sweet for me, so I added 1/4 cup more vineger. I also added 1 onion ,cut into 1"...only had AP flour, so I added 1 1/2 teas baking powder and 1/2 salt to flour.thanks for sharing

This tasted every bit the same as one of my favorite restaurants recipe!  The only things that I changed were adding a little bit of pureed pineapple to the batter (only about a tablespoon worth) and putting a chopped green pepper in the sauce.  My family thought this was well worth the prep/cook time to have this dish!  Thanks!

This was really easy.   I already had a bottle of sweet & sour sauce, so I didn't use the sauce part of the recipe. I just added the pinapple, peppers, onions, and water chestnuts.   The batter for the chicken was excellent.

This recipe was uber bland. I had to add so much more to this recipe. Also, the sauce definitely needed more cornstarch! It was still pretty watery. With a million other additions to it, it tasted decent.

Great batter recipe!  The result tasted and look like a restaurant quality meal. I tried it with shrimp and it's delicious. My changes:  I seasoned the chicken/shrimp with salt and white pepper before I put it in the batter.  I added more salt, white pepper and garlic powder than what the recipe says(appr. 1 - 1.5 tsp).  Use mixer to combine the batter ingredient to make a thick batter. Caution:  for the sauce, watch out with the vinegar - mixed it gradually until it has the sourness that you want.

Sauce could have had a little more flavor. It also took awhile to thicken. The chicken turned out great - just like restaurant sweet and sour chicken.

You need to make this, I have it all the time because it is SO simple but perfect. However, the only thing I really use is the recipe for the sauce. I've made it so often that I've found an easier way to make the breaded chicken. (Coat small pieces with an egg and milk mixture, then coat with a flour and corn starch mixture, then place into a frying pan with about 1/2 an inch of heated oil in it. I've used both olive and canola. When the bottoms are beginning to become brown just flip them over and brown the other side. It works perfectly.)

Although this isn't the kind of food I'd expect to find in a Chinese restaurant, it certainly made a quick and delicious dish.  I made a few changes to make it much healthier and easy to prepare: first, no deep-frying for me! (which also eliminates the extra work of making the batter)  I coated the chicken in a blend of flour, corn starch, salt and pepper, and fried it in an oiled pan.  By the way, for a family of 4 I halved the sauce and used only 600 grams of chicken breasts, it was plenty.  And as for the sauce, I omitted the food coloring and instead mashed a few frozen cranberries to give the sauce a pretty reddish tint & extra taste.  I also added about 2 tsp of cornstarch to the sauce so that it was slightly thick; when the chicken was ready I simply added it to the sauce along with the green pepper, and mixed everything so it was coated evenly.  The sauce nicely thickened and was very tasty - so similar to a Hawaiian Chicken recipe I had, but even better.  Oh yeah - I also added some soy sauce!  Yum!

There's NO way that you need a quart of oil to fry these in.  All it did was make the chicken (while tasty, I will say) get rather soggy and saturated.  We couldn't managed to cook the oil off, and ended up having to dump a great deal of the oil into a jar at the end of the evening.

This was EXCELLENT!  I will definitely make this again and highly recommend it.  I thought it was much better than anything I've ordered at a restaurant- the sauce is not as overwhelming as they typically are.  I did have one problem with this recipe, when I converted the serving size not everything converted correctly...some did, some didn't (I'm not sure if it was just a glitch in the website).  I ended up making the full size, which was great for leftovers.  Just make sure you check the numbers if  you use the website converter.

PRO: I thought the recipe was very simple, easy and yummy. CON: I thought there was too much constarch (thickening agent) in sauce; next time, I would only used half the amount recommended because I don't like sauce that have pudding consistency. NOTE:  I didn't have self-rising flour so I did what SHELLS recommended: added 1/2t salt and 1 1/2t baking powder to flour. Thanks everyone for a great recipe and advice!!!

Fantastic!!! My family loved this! A big thank you to the reviewer who added the information on how to modify regular flour into self-rising flour (add 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of baking powder).
This was definitely one of my favourites that I have tried off of the site!

I have tried this recipes and it is great. I only change a few things I didnt add the food coloring. I did add brown sugar for taste and color. I seasoned the chicken more with a little seasoned salt. My husband said it was the best he ever had better then take out. So thank for the recipe

The breading for the chicken turned out well; however I felt the sauce was too thin and watery, in both taste and consistency. It wasn't the thick sweet and sour sauce I was hoping for. Would make the chicken again, but look for another sauce recipe.

My mother is a student at a culinary arts school, and she told me about this recipe after preparing it in her class.  However, there are a couple of things that are different between this version and hers.  She said to use rice wine vinegar as opposed to white distilled, and to use cake flour rather than self-rising.  She also said to fry the chicken breast twice (yes, twice) -- first until the chicken gets ever so slightly brown, then drain on paper towels; put the chicken back in the deep fryer once the sauce and veggies are almost done and fry until completely browned.  Garnish the dish with sliced almonds once its done.

I love this recipe!  It was a lot easier to make than I thought it would be.  The sauce was great.  The batter is awesome!  I only had red food color which I figured would work.  It was pretty funny b/c the sauce turned out pink.  My bf was making fun of me, so next time I'll be sure to use the orange food coloring!

The chickne came out great-really easy and delicious.  The sauce was only okay.  I would make the chicken again but with a different sauce.  I also used another readers suggestion of adding 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt as I did not have self rising flour-worked great thanks!

This was really good.  I didn't have food coloring, but the kids didn't know any different and they liked it.  It didn't take long for me to make even starting with frozen chicken.  Frying in batches is what takes time other than that I was done in less than an hour.  Even less had my chicken been thawed.

Oh my, it was wonderful! The best sweet and sour sauce I have ever had. The chicken was great also. I used the deep fryer and it worked great, I just did it in batches. Thanks for the great recipe! My fussy kid just ate the chicken dipped in bbq sauce and thought that was great.

I've made this recipe now quite a few times.  Everyone absolutely loves it.  It does take quite some effort to prepare, but well worth it.  It's always such a hit.  I saute the pineapple and green pepper along with some chopped onions before mixing it all together with the chicken.  I highly recommend this recipe if you're looking to impress your company!!!

Ok I absolutely loved this dish. Makes going out to pay for this insane. It was fun to make the sauce and when you get to the batter, just trust the way the chicken looks. If you watch the video,you will have some sense of ease if this is your first time preparing it.

Delicious! Superior to Chinese delivery! I'd make a batch of the sauce for dipping spring / egg roll as well it's that good. For the orange food color I used one drop red one drop yellow and it worked perfect color wise. Had a bit of a problem with the batter adhering to the bottom of my pan but it was still yummy.

EDIT! The second time I made this, I realized I hadn't used quite enough oil last time. This time the nuggets came out beautifully puffed and golden! This is a great recipe, I'll fall back on this one... better than take out!

Made this for my 9 year old's birthday dinner tonight. I only made the batter and fried according to directions. I bought premade sweet and sour sauce (it was really good and I was also making homemade fried rice, lomein, eggrolls, and cake; bottled sauce was much easier). 

Everyone raved about how good it was. Way better than I've had at any restaurant. I will definitely make this dish again. I may even try to make the homemade sauce.

This was really a great sweet and sour chicken dish. I did find the directions a bit challenging but with the other reviews, it was really excellent.
After I took the chicken  from the frying pan, I placed it on paper towels and then put it in the fridge until we were ready to prepare it for dinner.
The best suggestion was to put the battered fried chicken in the oven at 350 F for 15-20 minutes before you want to serve it and then pour the sauce over it. The chicken crust is crispy , and not soggy! It was a really big hit.

I always stayed away from frying foods like this because I was afraid that it would turn out badly.  I didn't think I could possibly pull this one off, but I need to give it a try at some point.  I'm glad that I did.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception.  I only used 4 large chicken breasts instead of 8, but didn't cut back on the other ingredients.  I mixed the ingredients in the saucepan for the sauce except for the water and cornstarch mixture.  I cut up the chicken.  I mixed the batter and then added the chicken.  Mixed it thoroughly.  Heated the oil in my large wok.  While the oil was coming up to temperature, I brought the sauce mixture to a boil and then added the water and cornstarch.  I didn't have orange food color so I used 1 drop of red and 1 drop of yellow.  It wasn't quite the color I was looking for so I added another drop of red.  Checked the temperature of the oil with a thermometer.  Keeping the temperature steady is important for consistency in doneness and texture of the final product (in my opinion).  I cooked the chicken in small batches by placing each piece in the oil one at a time with tongs.  I tried putting it in by handfuls, but they would get stuck together in the pan.  Tongs it was.  After I had finished putting a batch in, I set the timer for 5 minutes.  After the timer went off, I would remove the most done pieces first.  This allowed the 'youngest' pieces a little longer to cook.  In the end, they were cooked perfectly.  I then re

This chicken is AMAZING! Sauce needs tweaking, not sour enuf or much flavor even though I added OJ & used some brown sugar & 1/2 apple cider vinegar & 1/2 white distilled vinegar. Doubled the sauce. Added red pepper flakes, scallions & pineapple,  glad I did. BUT THE CHICKEN, we couldn't get it fast enough!!! Overall it's DELICIOUS! Definitely read the reviews & opt for what suits your tastes. Also, frying in a pan will mean @ least 3 batches, took about 1.5 hours from start to finish & well worth it! Very important, DO NOT pour on sauce AND definitely put it 350° oven. Served lightly sautéed green peppers, veggies, pineapple separate from chicken, rice, sauce & egg rolls. Yum, nom, nom.

I made this almost exactly as written with one or two small changes here or there. Firstly, I seasoned the batter with a little garlic powder and a smidge of parsley. And for some reason the sauce refused to thicken no matter how much of the cornstarch mixture I added to it, so I swapped it for a little flour and water until it thickened up.. possibly more than called for, but it still worked out fine for my family. The last change was that I added finely diced pineapple and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the sauce so to bring out the sweetness. Aside from that, the recipe was basically the same. The family gave it rave reviews... so much so that I didn't even get to properly taste any of it because it was gone in a matter of hours (I started making it late in the evening so I could take it to work for lunch the very next day). This recipe is hands down a keeper! Very, very awesome! Just as good as any Chinese restaurant I've been to!

This is an excellent recipe. I had problems with the cornstarch not dissolving when I added it to the Sweet-n-Sour sauce but I just continued to stir with a whisk and it all blended. My family loved it! I will definitely make this again.

It was amaaaaazing!!!! 

The fried chicken on its own was fantastic! I'm going to use that for chicken strips/nuggets, etc...

We put the sauce on its own, the bell pepper and pineapple on its own, and the chicken on its own and served them separately.

Our family really enjoyed this recipe tonight. I would say that the sauce needed to stay on the heat to thicken, it was way too runny after turning the heat off and adding the slurry. I did the amount of sauce it calls for (feeding 8 people) but halved the chicken and batter and it was a good ratio. It fed our family of four and still had leftovers. I also added the bell peppers and pineapple chunks directly to the sauce. I like the peppers to soften a bit. We will definitely make this again.

My husband loves sweat and sour chicken and loved this.  I added onion and used red and yellow bell peppers.  I put the veggies in the completed sauce and put a top on the pan. Then, I fried up the chicken.  That way the veggies were a little softer than if I had just put them on the plate, raw. I think the sauce needs something else but am not sure what it is.  A little more flavor from a spice but just not expert enough in Asian cuisine to know what.

Loved thi, better than my normal chinese takeout! Hubby loved it too.  Made two meals out of it since it's just us two.  Easy recipe to make, I prepped most of the items during the day and then it was just throw it together.  Highly recommend.

Amazing!! Made such a lovely dinner for myself and the kids! I did not have the cornstarch and I used some leftover sauce (since I didn't have any pineapple) but the chicken turned out soooo good. I have a hard time getting my son to eat but he ate this up. Tastes like the China Palace downtown made it :-) A++++

Overall, this was great for my first attempt at Sweet and Sour Chicken. This recipe was good, other than the flavor of the sauce (it was missing a little something, sort of fell flat on the palette, I will be searching for a better sauce recipe for future use). I added the pineapple (along with it's juices) and the peppers directly to the sauce at the beginning of preparation of said sauce. I have never had sweet and sour chicken served with raw peppers in a restaurant, in my experience the peppers have always been slightly wilted/cooked when served. I also eliminated the orange food coloring because of the health hazards associated with artificial colorings/dyes. If you do not own a wok or deep fryer - simply use a large stock pot with a thick bottom (to evenly distribute and maintain heat), fill the pot with about 4 inches of oil (enough to not only cover the chicken when it's frying, but also allow for it to float in the oil so it does not stick to your pan), bring oil to temperature over medium heat (temperature setting may vary depending upon the type of stove you have, I have a gas range), and most importantly be patient while waiting for the oil to reach the proper temperature (otherwise the batter on the chicken will not crisp up/puff out right and your chicken will be overcooked/dry). I think I will double the amount of salt & pepper in the batter next time as well. My hubby loved it! :)

This a rock star recipe. I doubled the sauce thinking that it would not be enough but the recipe would have been perfect. I also added red peppers, onions, carrots, snow pea pods. My kids honestly could not get enough of it and my wife said it was the best Chinese she has ever had. Also made fortune cookies with questions in them for dinner conversation.  Found that recipe on this sure too. It might be easier to do take out but this recipe is worth the effort.

loved this recipe. My husband does not like sweet entrees so I will try it without sugar. I did prepare the vegetables differently. I fried maybe half a teaspoon of ginger paste for about a minute and added a quarter of an onion diced large and pineapple (i used slices diced large). Stir-fried for a few minutes until lightly browned. Added peppers and turned the heat off. I  stirred in the sauce. Everyone loved this recipe even my picky 4 year old.

I just used the pineapple sauce part of this to put over some baked Tyson honey breast tenders and it was a simple, great meal.  I'm sure the whole recipe would be delicious because the sauce is so good.

The flavor and outcome were really good, but this dish is very labor intensive. For the work put into it, I felt it was just "good", not outstanding.

This is awesome!!!  I am not even a big Chinese food fan, and it is one of my favorite dishes now.  I made it and could not get it out of my head, so I made it again about four days later.  I did season the chicken before I battered it.  This is one that will be a regular.

Amazing! Do keep the ingredients separate, and layer in the end when serving - this allows everyone to regulate the amount of sauce to rice to chicken, and to stack on their favourite veggies. We also had green onion slivers available as a topping, and you could easily add ham chunks or broccoli florets as options too. This recipe yielded lots of sauce for us, as is. We will absolutely be making this again. Oh, and as a note on the dip for the chicken - I have always found it easier to dip the chunks of raw meat into the eggs first, then dredge with flour. Whenever I try to make a paste, it is difficult to coat the meat - but this may just be me. Thanks for a keeper! (Additional comment:half of the sauce recipe is plenty, even when using 4 or 5 large chicken breasts.)

I tried this last night for dinner and it was awesome, however I did make some changes. Instead of raw green pepper I battered the slices and deep fried them and added salt right a way. used the larger can of pineapple, and served the chicken over white rice. MY HUSBAND THIS WAS DIFFENTLY A KEEPER RECIPE. Samie Sue

I've been looking for a batter to make Chinese chicken for a long time. This one was delicious. I did add some salt and pepper and garlic powder to the chicken before adding it to the thick batter. It helped a lot since the batter is not too seasoned. The fried chicken can be used as a base for a lot of different dishes or just plain chicken nuggets. I doubled the sauce as some suggested but ended up having too much. I didn't mix it together since I didn't want the chicken to get soggy, so that may have made a difference with the extra sauce. Took it to a family event and it was enjoyed by people from 3 years old to 63 years old. Will definitely make this again!

A very tasty recipe - instead of adding orange food colouring though I added a few tablespoons of tomato ketchup which as well as adding the required colour, also gave the sauce an extra layer of tang. The batter was a little too thick though I have to say it really was delicious - I'd just make it a bit thinner next time - will definitely be using this recipe again.

Seriously just like takeout! I've been searching forever for a good recipe since I have to eat gluten free and can't trust takeout/restaurant food. I only made the sauce (with regular sautéed chicken and peppers) and it was amazing!

Loved it- and so easy to make something fantastic! My family raves about this dish and says we don't have to get delivery from the Chinese place. I tripled the pineapple and pineapple juice and doubled the rest of the sauce ingredients. I put the pineapple directly in the sauce. This gives more sauce to put over rice or noodles. This is just too-oo good! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Lindahu

I liked it. Make sure you don't just glob the cornstarch into the sauce. Mix it with water prior and ease it in. The sauce will be typical corn starch "gel" consistency, but tastes just like the stuff from the Chinese restaurants!

This is great. No changes required. I will double up the sauce the next time I make it. The batter recipe gives me many ideas. Oh wait I did change the way I served it. I put the pineapple chunks and green peppers in the sauce and poured it over the chicken. Very good!

I really wish I could give me stars. This was awesome! It was super easy to make. The sauce was the best I have had in a long time! Definitely a keeper. I followed the directions given in the most helpful comment. It made it a little more clear on making the sauce and the batter. I plan on trying this with shrimp next. Awesome recipe!

Love the recipe!  Just made it again tonight, but once cooking realized I didn't have white distilled vinegar or pineapple juice.  So we substituted Cider Vinegar and and orange juice.  Tasted a bit like orange chicken and tasted great!

This recipe was perhaps the best sweet and sour chicken I have ever had. I was also surprised at home simple it was to make. 

While making this, when it came time to fry the chicken, I did use a deep fryer instead and I think the chicken came out better than it would have in a frying pan or wok. 

Also, to the people who rated this recipe lower because they thought the instructions could have been more clear, if the instructions were not good enough, there is a video that should make everything crystal clear to understand.

A very good recipe. My only issue is that the vinegar taste seemed extra strong. I'll try to cut back slightly the next time.

Amazing recipe! I only changed one thing: I fried the chicken using olive oil (I don't like to use vegetable oil). Oh, and I added probably double the amount of the pineapple and the peppers ;) Awesome! Thank you so much for sharing this with us!

Sorry, it did not work out for me and my daughter but husband liked it. I really do liked the texture of the batter but seriously needed flavor, both chicken and batter. For the sauce, I will find another.

Love the sauce, I added thin sliced white onion and carrots to sauce when I started cooking it just because I like it. The batter is really thick but tastes great, I might use Tempura batter next time. Will make this one again.

My family loves this recipe, we have made it several times.  The only thing we have done differently is, we don't add orange food coloring, because we don't care if it is clear and we added the pineapple to the sauce, and a bit extra white pepper to the batter.  It is a fantastic recipe and we have told several people about it, thank you so much!

I made a few changes but the sauce recipe is really what I'm giving 5 stars; I followed it exactly. I added some chopped onions, minced garlic, and red bell pepper and stir fried them for a few minutes before added the sauce mixture. I also used cubed, pan-fried, extra firm tofu instead of chicken to make this vegetarian -- but as I said, the 5 stars is for what really matters, which is the delicious sweet & sour sauce.

I love cooking but have never cooked chinese style food. I cooked this dish for my friends son on his b-day. Everyone loved it. The boy (13) even told me "this is the best birthday dinner ever!") I couldn't figure out why the sauce was so thin however. Next time I will try to better that. I was very proud I was able to accomplish something so far out of my ellement. I'm a southern cook at heart. But I'm glad I could use this recipe to make a 13 year old's birthday wish (at least food wise). Thanks for this recipe, I'm adding it to my box!

This was really good. The chicken came out tasting way better than our favorite Chinese food restaurant. I wasn't especially crazy about the sauce though. I also used fresh pineapple instead of jarred and added chunks of onion as well. It got a big thumbs up from a 2 year old, so it is a keeper.

The sauce was fabulous! The chicken was good too when we had it right from the pan. Took some advice from others and just used the chicken needed and the next day, I heated the remainder in the oven then added the sauce to it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the next time I will try to do the chicken without batter to make it a more healthy recipe. The sauce was phenomenal though!
I followed the advice and seasoned the chicken really well and even added some crushed pepper flakes to suit my spicy Jamaican palate :).

I was not happy with this recipe at all. I have my  own recipe of sweet and sour that I make, but I decided to make something different tonight, and now I wish I hadn't. The batter is awful, it's heavy and comes off the chicken after you add the sauce, instead of staying crispy and crunchy. Not only that, but the amount of batter is way too much for the amount of chicken that the recipe calls for. If you don't have a wok or actual fryer, you're SOL. My recipe doesn't involve batter, and combines the veggies/pineapple and sauce with the chicken, not layering cold peppers and pineapple chunks with the cooked chicken and sauce. The sauce was another problem; the main issue is getting the corn starch to blend and not clump with the sauce, even if you follow the instructions completely. You would be better off just using flour to get it to thicken if you don't know how to do it correctly. Also, corn starch is mainly supposed to be used in dairy-based sauces, which is why using it in this sauce is a bad idea. On the whole, though, not a good recipe. I won't be using this again.

I liked the way the batter worked out in this recipe. It was light and crunchy. And I liked the texture of the sauce. But, this is bland bland bland. It needs a lot of help in the flavor department. If I'm going to spend a good hour frying chicken in batches, I want to put it in a sauce that has more of a flavor to it than just vinegar and sugar. Maybe a little bit of soy and ginger would improve this.

Delicious!!  Definately a keeper.  I took the suggestions of others and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  WOW!  As good if not better than the local Chinese Restaurant.  I added a red bell pepper and half a chopped onion and sautéed them until tender and then added the pineapple.  I also added the juice of half a tangelo that I had on hand to the sauce.  I didn't have food coloring but it still turned out beautiful.  A great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

The chicken is amazing.  I made a mistake and left out the egg in the batter and it was still good.  I added salt and pepper to the chicken before adding batter and sprinkled a little salt after it came out of the oil.  Very good!! The sauce was yummy!! Served over brown rice.

So good! I used 3 diff. vinegars, apple cider, balsamic and red wine, just because that's what I had. I reduced the sugar just a little also. I loved the battered chicken, although sometimes I might just saute the chicken to make a little healthier.

Crowd Pleaser!! Best recipe for deep frying chicken or shrimp! Even my four kids loved it and they are picky eaters I did season the chicken more before dipping into the batter this is a keeper:):)

This is okay.  The sweet n sour sauce is missing soy sauce & apple cider vinegar (use instead of white vinegar).  Deep frying it made a mess of the batter and took too much time.  Next time I will just saute the chicken.

I am not a huge fan of Chinese food, but this came out tasting so much fresher than what you get in the restaurants. My husband and kids absolutely LOVED it.

Delicious and authentic! I had an issue getting the sauce to thicken--I think I left it standing for a bit too long after boiling and mixed the corn starch mixture in too fast. However, with a little more heat, it thickened up nicely. (I'd recommend heat before adding more cornstarch, if it hasn't thickened--ours turned to jello in the fridge.)

Excellent basic batter!  Chicken pieces fry up nice and tender inside, crispy outside.  However, I did add flavors to the dry ingredients of the batter:  Powdered Ginger; Powdered Garlic; MSG; Salt & Pepper.

Sauce was just okay, but kids loved it.  I did add dark soy sauce and red food coloring.

Made this tonight and it was pretty good. I would next time add a bit more sugar as I like it sweet. I put all my veggies, green pepper, onion, carrot strips, and fresh pineapple, into the sauce once it was ready. It does take A LONG time to make the chicken though. But it was good and my family liked it. All but the little neighbor girl. But then, she doesn't like much other than PB&J!

I hosted a luau themed birthday dinner for my daughter's 10th birthday and this main dish was a HIT!  All the kids raved to their parents about the fact that this was better than the Chinese food restaurant and I look forward to making it again!

I thought this was way too much work for the quality of taste. I followed the recipe, except I didn't add food coloring, and for my tastes the chicken was fairly bland and the sauce didn't do much for me.  After reading the glowing reviews I was disappointed that I wasn't more enthralled with this. I won't make it again, for one thing there was so much left over we'll be eating for a week.

This turned out much better than I thought it would, and it was exciting to have it turn out right on my first try. However, I ended up using little of the sauce. It didn't have enough flavor, and was just too sweet. I also learned the hard way that mixing the corn starch into the water BEFORE adding it to the pot is a crucial step...haha. My husband seemed to like the sauce a lot though, so it may be just personal preference. This meal is time consuming though so allot enough time when making it!

This is the best chinese recipe I've ever made!  The key is frying with batter.  I made 4 servings and the calculations were accurate.  I did have trouble thickening the sauce and I had to turn the heat back on and add a couple pinches of cornstarch.  I used the self-rising flour recipe on allrecipes.  I did not have orange food coloring so I mixed my red and yellow to make orange.  I sauted the bell pepper and pineapple.  The bell pepper added gorgeous color, but I didn't think it tasted well with the dish.  We loved the batter so much we fried the leftover batter and made what we called chinese donuts.

Pretty good, but the recipe is very confusing and is not clear on several points. I halved the recipe.  It was a little bland even after I seasoned up the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and let it sit for awhile.  Also, I sauteed the bell pepper plus an onion, carrots and celery in peanut oil and added the pineapple chunks.  Then I made the batter and browned the chicken in my cast iron skillet in some peanut oil.  I kept the veggies and the chicken warming in the oven, then made the sauce.  I didn't have any food coloring.  The sauce was easy to make, then I just dumped the veggies in the sauce and served it all over jasmine rice.  Mom loved it.  Not too sweet.

Just okay for my family.  Definitely need to liberally apply some sort of seasoning.  I prefer Adobo which helped a bit.  But my kids were not enthusiastic about this meal at all.

Having self rising flour for this recipe is a must. If not you will need to tweak the flour with baking powder; still delicious. I serve this dish to the kids with ketchup!

This makes the best batter if you're looking for a Chinese rest. style sweet and sour chicken. With the dipping sauce I also add a dash of soy sauce and pineapple and cook a little longer to get some more thickness and I have a rule about adding dry ingredients to wet so I added the cornstarch before the water and made a roué first than made the sauce.

I would watch how much water you add to the batter, mine was not thick enough.  ALso I would recommend using peanut oil, not vegetable oil, because it starts to burn after several cookings.

Great recipe, easy and tasty. Did have a very strong pineapple flavour though. Next time I will add only 3/4 of the pineapple juice to the sauce. Also did add some ketchup and soy sauce, and did not have the food colouring.

This was great and was pretty easy!!! The directions aren't clear, when you boil the sugar and water you are making the sweet & sour...took me a minute to get that. But the hubby and kids loved it!!!

the first time I made this I was not thrilled with the taste it was way more sour then sweet and didn't have much flavour to the sauce. Since I am a recipe tweaker I added some marachino cherry juice to the mix and half white sugar half brown and ground ginger to taste the end result turned out very yummy

Excellent, surprisingly easy recipe! The chicken is crisp and crunchy, just like restaurant quality. I used peanut oil for frying, and didn't have a thermometer so I just guessed it around medium and they came out golden brown (I think it's hard to screw up the frying).  As written (8 chicken breasts) is a pretty hefty amount. I fried them in batches as big as my 12" skillet could handle, and it took me the better part of an hour to get them all done. Like I said, it's a lot of chicken - if you serve with a side dish, I'd say this recipe is more than 8 servings for sure. Definitely keep the sauce and chicken separate until plating so as to keep the fry coating crispy, and if you have leftovers store them separately as well. Note the orange food coloring in the sauce. I always omit food coloring because most sauces have a natural color that I find more appealing than artificial dyes. But this one has no color in it and just comes out a cloudy pale liquid. Perfectly palatable, but it definitely needs some color for plating. I used soy sauce and sesame oil to give it some character (tasted great!), but I may just pick up orange/red coloring for next time.

Added thinly sliced carrots and some garlic.  Was just a little bland but I had to add 1/4 c more water to thicken the sauce up.  Otherwise, delicious but somewhat complicated.  Have everything ready before starting.

This recipe has the best batter and chicken texture. I didn't have Self Rising Flour, so I used All purpose Flour and 3-1/2 tsp baking powder.  After failing at several sauce recipes I realized it was because I was using regular vinegar as alot of other recipes use red wine vinegar. What a difference that made! I also added 2 cubes chicken boullion next time I'll try 3. 2 tsp ginger and I omitted the pepper. Very Very good, got rave reviews from the fam! Some of the other recipes added lemon juice and ketshup. I'll stick with this recipe though, why mess with perfection. It goes great with fried rice. Why go to the restaurant when you can make it at home better?!

This was very good!!! If you love sweet and sour and want to impress anyone at dinner, then this is your dish! I lightly cooked one carrot, a medium onion, one green bell pepper, and one 10 oz. can of chunked pineapple till vegetables were just a little tender but till had bite to them. I then added that to the sauce along with 1 to 2 TBS. of soy sauce. We like to eat it with brown rice and then top with the chicken and cover it all in the sauce.  Our new favorite sweet n sour recipe!!!

I have made this recipe several times before and even rated it giving it 4 stars. After a few alterations I've discovered I now have to turn that 4 into an ecstatic 5!!! With a few alterations this is now the most delicious sweet and sour chicken EVER!

So here are the changes I made.

1. Please do yourself a favor and brine the chicken before coating and frying. I used the simple chicken brine recipe found on this site. Brineing is a much better then marinating for this recipe. When you keep the chicken in a brine for at least 2 hours prior to preparing the chicken stays soft and moist even if you over fry it a little! I will never make this recipe again without brining my chicken!

2. Fry the chicken piece in used corn/vegetable oil. I used some oil I had used to make fried pork, bacon, and chimichangas this past week. The chicken piece came out so excellent!!! They were the yummiest chicken nuggets ever. My son raved about how they tasted better then McDonald's McNuggets!

3. This whole business of thickening my sauce seems like a simple affair but I have failed many times at this. I bring the sauce to a simmer, take it off the fire and then add cornstarch a few moments later. I stir and stir but the sauce does not thicken. I learned that it doesn't thicken because it's not hot enough. It's okay to put it back on the fire till it starts to simmer and thicken. As soon as the sauce thickens take it off the fire!

That's the main changes I made! Made for a fantastic dinner!

The chicken itself tastes similar to what you would get at a restaurant. I'm a beginner-to-intermediate level cook who doesn't do a lot of frying. I was hopeful with this recipe - and it's not bad - but it did turn out to be too much work and mess for me. At least now I don't feel so bad paying for takeout.  Campbell's Kitchen Sweet and Sour Chicken from this site is way easier, and just as good if not better IMO. (The main difference is the chicken isn't fried, which also makes it less unhealthy than this one.)

When I tasted the sauce before putting it on the chicken and I was worried that it would be very good but I was wrong! This is a really good recipe but next time I think I will try using Rice Vinegar. The sauce lacked a "bite" that I was looking for but still VERY GOOD. The batter for the chicken is perfect as written.

This recipe really was outstanding! Would like a little more sourness from the sauce, so will try again with only 1/2 cup white sugar. I added maraschino cherries to the sauce, which gave it the color needed. For veggies I used green & red pepper and onions. Will make again & again!

I forgot to add in my post that when the sause was done, I added the pepper and onion and put it on low while I made the chicken. I did not have orange food coloring so the orange marmalade gave it a better orange-y tint and not the weird grayish clear tint.

I didn't have self-rising flour so I added 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt (making the salt total 1 tsp.) as recommended by another reviewer. I fried them in my deep fryer and wow! They looked and tasted just like the restaurant! I will definitely be making these again!

I thought this was great! I loved how the chicken was so crunchy but still juicy inside. I pretty much followed the directions but pounded and seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before cutting into cubes and also added a little bit of soy sauce and ketchup to the sweet and sour sauce. Served with brown rice and a mix of sauteed onions, carrots and celery.

My family loved this so much! We are thinking about using it with shrimp next time.  The batter was so yummy, that we fried some of the left over batter and had crispies with our chicken. As a matter of fact, you could probably just use the batter recipie, add some sugar and use it to make funnel cakes, or roll the crispies in cinnimon and sugar for dessert.

Loved, Loved, Loved this!! Made this along with the Hot Peanut Sauce from this site, which I served over spaghetti noodles with chicken and white rice. The sweet & sour sauce was better than the restaurant we usually order from. The only reason I would order this out from now on is convenience, because this recipe is WAY better!! I used crushed pineapple only because I had opened a can the day before for my son, but otherwise didn't change a thing! When we first started cooking the chicken it was really sticking to the pan...then we figured out that we were supposed to have a pan full of hot oil, not just a Tbls as I was reading in the recipe. The Tbls was for the batter, which I had put in the batter and then thought it was for the pan. We laughed when we figured out it was supposed to DEEP fry the chicken. Then it came out great and we're glad we figured it out because it was worth the wait and the effort!! We will be making this a lot I suspect. Great as a special dish for company!!

Oh my, this was the best sweet and sour chicken recipe I've ever tried.  I'm so glad LINDAHU submitted this one. This will become a regular at my house. I couldn't find orange food coloring at the store, so I used red instead..it was so yummy!

Excellent! Definitely a keeper! Just as good if not better than what you would get at a restaurant. As some reviewers suggested, I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and onion powder before putting it in the batter and frying. In the future, I plan to make up lots of chicken, freeze it to pull out and reheat in the oven when I'm serving the meal. I made the chicken earlier in the day and reheated it in the oven before dinner and it turned out great.

Made this tonight with my husband. We added some onion into the sauce and the pepper let it sit in the sauce while we made everything else. It really brought out the flavor and became a very authentic chinese dish. Two thumbs up..make this you won't be disappointed. This is going to be a staple in our menu now.

This was SO YUMMY!!! My husband now wants it once a month! I did marinate my chicken in soy sauce and seared it in a cast iron skillet, then poured the sauce on top of all sauteed veggies. It's a keeper!

I had purchased Kikkoman Sweet & Sour Sauce, so I just needed this recipe for the coating. It was excellent! As another reviewer suggested, I cut up the chicken (tenders) then seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder, and chicken seasoning; put in fridge for 1/2 hour. For the water, I swirled what was stuck to the edges of the Kikkoman sweet & sour bottle with water and used that. Delicious!

Excellent recipe. I followed a few suggestions from other reviewers and added 1/2tsp salt and 1 1/2tsp baking powder to the flower instead of using self-rising flower.  I also added garlic powder to the chicken batter.  I made this for a potluck and everyone enjoyed it.  It can take a bit of time to make because the recipe is for a huge serving size but it's pretty simple to follow. I will be making this again and again.

This was amazing! I have a small fryer, so it took a long time to make all that this makes. I substituted chicken with pork chop cut into cubes, I didn't have any chicken. The recipe was really easy. But I prepared this with an egg roll recipe that I got from this website, and it took me a total of about 3 hours to completely prepare and cook. The sweet and sour sauce was perfect. I didn't have orange food coloring so I used red, it really doesn't change how it tastes anyway. It reheats deliciously. I'm so excited to enjoy my favorite ethnic food without spending a fortune. I took some advice from the reviews: I seasoned the meat, covered, and refrigerated for a couple hours, I didn't have self-rising flour so I added salt and baking powder to flour before mixing ingredients for batter. Also, a trick of mine to drain meat after frying is to take cooling racks and place them on cookie sheets. It keeps them from sticking and overall tastes better. The other way is a waste of papertowels anyway. Definatly a keeper.

Oh my gosh, this tastes amazing!  I've never taken the time to rate another recipe, but this one is so worth trying.  It's just like good chinese take out.  I only made a few minor changes - mostly from other reviewers suggestions.  I seasoned the raw chicken with salt, garlic salt & pepper and it sat in the refrigerator for about 45 minutes before I cooked it while I prepped other foods.  I used just over half of the vinegar in the sauce and  I whisked the cornstarch and water together before pouring into the sauce to avoid lumps. (Make the sauce before you start frying the chicken and it will thicken up very nicely.)  I stir-fried green pepper, onion, carrots and snow peas instead of serving raw veggies.  I fried the chicken in batches and put on a cookie sheet in the oven to keep warm while frying the rest.  I served it over rice, egg rolls & home-made crab rangoon.  This is soooo good!  Try it!!

As said many, many times, this recipe is delicious! I found it very easy, if a very little time consuming. Frying up the chicken did take a little time as I had to do it in batches.   We have allergy issues here and eggs are out. So I simply deleted the egg in the tempura batter, it was delicious and light. It seemed to make no difference in the way the batter functioned.   For the 3 adults and 2 children in my home, I used only 4 chicken breasts and left the rest of the ingredients the same. This gave us plenty of sauce for the amount of chicken. I also added more veggies to the peppers and pineapple for a more colorful and healthy, if less authentic meal.   Kids and adults alike devoured this meal and ate way too much. However we still had some leftovers for my lunch the next day, as well as even more chicken for nuggets!

LOVED this recipe!  It was great.  I did not make any changes.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the effort to make the chicken.  Not the fault of the recipe, just a lot of work.  Delicious result for the work.

This was excellent!  I am a vegetarian, so I used tofu instead of chicken.  The breading of the tofu was a bit messy but worth it.  I often miss the crunch of fried food and this really hit the spot.  I added baking powder to all purpose flour instead of using self rising.  I served it with fried rice, a great recipe for making take out at home (and it really is just as good!).

Eventhough this recipe was a little difficult to follow, the end result was mighty tasty.  I know, however, it will be even better the next time I make it.  The things I have to remember are to cook the sauce a little longer until it's thicker.  (I turned off the heat because the recipe said to and it didn't thicken enough.)  I needed to use a non-stick wok or fry pan as I lost a lot of the batter because it stuck to the pan.  I didn't take notice to the recipe stating "self-rising flour".  Which if I had, I would have added baking powder to my all purpose flour.  It was my own fault for the oversight.  Even with these minor problems we had NO leftovers!

I made this tonight and the entire family enjoyed it.  Not for a busy weeknight meal though, it took almost an hour to complete the meal and a half hour to clean up the kitchen. I followed the recipe with a couple of minor exceptions.  I used the juice of a 20oz can of pineapple rather than an 8 oz can. I didn't have any food coloring on hand so added a couple of squirts of ketchup.  I also sauteed the peppers and then nuked the pineapple in the microwave, and served both on the side. We had oriental flavored Ramen noodles and steamed white rice with it, and both were very good. I cooked the chicken in several batches and kept it warm on a cookie sheet in the oven while I prepared the rest of the meal. Very good overall, and honestly better than some of the chinese restaurant sweet and sour that I have had.

I found this to be very heavy, messed the kitchen and overall too much work!  I loved the flavors, thus adapted the basic ingredients and "made it my own".  Instead of making a batter, I lightly dusted the chicken chunks with corn starch & soy sauce (2TBLSP). Let Marinate for 15 min.  Stir fry in a few tablespoons of canola oil, saute in batches, so you don't overcrowd the pan. I used all the vegs in original recipe, Add them in when chicken is done, add FRESH pineapple!!!  For sauce, use 1 cup pineapple juice, 1/2 soy sauce, 1/4 cup white vinegar,2 tablespoons sugar, 1/2 teaspoon crushed pepper (or less), 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, 2 tablespoon cornstarch, stir well & add to chicken & vegs....cook until thickened. Serve over basmati rice, delicious

Awesome!  Just like you'd get if you eat out, but for way less money.  I used about 1/4 cup ketchup instead of the orange food coloring, but otherwise, made the recipe exactly.  I order sweet and sour chicken every time I go somewhere were it is offered, and this hits the spot!

For a homemade version of Sweet n sour Chicken, this recipe is good. After reading Shells review and clarification, I proceeded to make this recipe. I scaled the recipe to 12 servings and doubled the sauce recipe. I thought I would need the sauce doubled after reading some of the other reviews but we had plenty left over. This will be a keeper for my house, Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night and my son who is very particular about his sweet and sour chicken says it was "excellent". Had with egg rolls ordered from take out. First time I've ever prepared chicken with a batter like that and it was great.  Only suggestion to others is make sure you only fry about 10 or so pieces of chicken at a time or they don't get nice and crispy - they get mushy...which I did... thanks for a great recipe I will be making again!

Good recipe, not great.  Had a lot less flavor than I thought, but maybe that is just because I am use to sweet and sour chicken with tons of MSG!  I only used 1/4 cup vinegar and it was almost too much.  Added extra green pepper and some white onion.

this recipe is almost exactly like mine except i cut up the chicken and coat it with seasoned cornstarch (dry mix) then fry it.  then just before serving add chicken to sauce and boil for a few minutes and it will thicken up.  it saves on caleries and saves time

I am stuffing my face with this as I type and must say it is absolutely delicious. My poor husband cannot stand chinese food, but I always drag him to the chinese restaurant. Now I won't have to! Even my VERY picky 4 year old went back for seconds! Only thing I did different was add baking powder and salt to all purpose flour, as I just don't buy self rising. I didn't use as much oil for frying the chicken, and I mixed the pineapple chunks and, bell peppers in with the sauce after it thickened. Also I sauted the bell pepper as I hate crunchy veggies. Maybe next time I will use more food coloring, as it wasn't quite orange enough IMO. With that said, this recipe is saved, and I will continue to make it many times. Thank you kindly for such a delicious recipe. :)

This tasted just like restaurant style. It was fabulous. however. instead of using all the cornstarch and stuff for the breading on the chicken, I took some advice from Rachael Ray, and I used bisquick, no measurements, just used bisquick, an egg, some milk and some soy sauce, salt and pepper, mixed it together till it was thick enough to make a batter, and then used that to batter the chicken pieces. I only used 2 chicken breasts and there was more than we could eat and my hubby is a BIG eater. It was really good, will definately make again!! Sweet n Sour sauce was a little too sour for my taste, so I added more pineapple juice, and I didn't add the food coloring, so it was just pineapple colored, but it tasted great! Thanks so much for such an awesome recipe!

Good recipe. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and my girlfriend liked it even more. My sauce came out a bit watery and a little heavy on the vinegar, but I also scaled the recipe down significantly, and this may have contributed.
I added a few splashes of soy sauce to the chicken when I fried it up and threw in a handful of veggies (green onions, carrots, celery, plus the recommended pineapple) right at the end, and then served it all over rice, sort of like a teriyaki bowl. It came out quite nicely, and I didn't find it as labor intensive as the reviews would indicate. Maybe simply because I was frying significantly less chicken?

We ate and ate and ate and ate and ate. This was that good. The chicken turned out perfectly. I made strips instead of chunks. I served this with jasmine rice and stir fry veggies. I didn't pour the sauce over so our leftovers wouldn't get soggy. I used all the juice from a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks and didn't adjust anything for a fabulous sauce. Didn't have white so I used cider vinegar, it turned out fine. I added about 1/4 c ketchup to the sauce to give it the reddish color since I didn't have orange food coloring. Thanks, Lindahu, this is a keeper!

Wow!  Awesome.  My husband loved it.  I used "cake flour" instead of "self-rising flour" and I put more pineapple juice in.  Will make this whenever I make Chinese food.  Would be a great recipe for a special company-coming meal.

This was delicious.  I was out of white vinegar so I substituted cider vinegar, and substituted 1/2 the sugar with apple jelly.  And I used baking mix instead of self-rising flour.  My husband loved it and wants it as a regular dinner.

This recipe is spectacular! I made this for dinner and paired it with egg fried rice from this site. I also sauteed the bell peppers and pineapple together and served as a side dish and these 3 together made an amazing oriental dinner. I won't ever go out for sweet and sour chicken again, which has always been my favorite chinese buffet food. I did not add the food coloring to the sauce and I used a small can of pineapple juice instead of the drained syrup, it turned out just fine. Even my picky kids loved it and also requested it in their lunch boxes tomorrow. It is a little bit of work, but not any more than any real homecooked meal and well worth the time and effort!

This recipe is the BEST sweet & sour chicken I have ever made. I have made it a coouple times since I found it and it is the reason for me becoming a member. I just HAD to review this recipe!!! Not only is it an excellent dish following it to the letter but the chicken battered and fried makes GREAT "chicken nuggets" for my 3 year old. Thanks SO much for this awesome recipe!!!

Wow will make this again! Just a little tip, if you use a deep fryer you must drop them in , if you don't they will stick. It was pretty easy to make, just took a little time is all.

This was just 'alright' to me. Now granted, I didn't use the chicken preparation method in the recipe because I don't like all that batter. I used this recipe primarily for the sauce. And the sauce was just 'alright'. I would not make this again.

THIS WAS GOOD, WE ALL LIKED IT. ONLY THING WAS, I HAD TO DISCARD MOST OF THE OIL WHEN I FRIED THE CHICKEN PIECES. SEEMS TO BE TOO MUCH. THEY FRIED BETTER WHEN I GOT RID OF THE OIL. ONLY HAVING A LITTLE TO FRY IN. I WAS TASTY, BUT I DON;T THINK I'LL MAKE IT AGAIN IT TOOK TOO MUCH WORK AND EFFORT IN THE KITCHEN. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING EASIER.

I was really looking forward to this recipe. Sweet and sour chicken is not my favorite meal at a Chinese restaurant, but  do like it, and my boyfriend LOVES it... so when I found this recipe I was excited. The end product was not very good in my opinion. The batter for the chicken fried up very dense and hard... not light and "tempura"-esque like at restaurants. It was also very bland. The sauce was just alright. I served it with rice and broccoli. I'll be continuing my search...

Tasted great-just like the Chinese Restaurant! Only thing is that it makes a TON of sauce. If only cooking for a few, u may want to cut sauce recipe in half. Not a good "leftover" recipe b/c chicken gets very soggy :(

5+ must try. Not time consuming, could not understand why so many said it is. The sauce took 10-15 minutes and then you had to fry chicken. I did change a few things.For a serving of 4; To the sauce, I added 1tsp brown sugar, 1 tb soy sauce, 1/2 green pepper, 1/4 onion and 1/2 carrot all diced and sauteed and added to the sauce along with pineapple. The chicken, I soaked in salt water for half an hour and then diced and added onion & garlic powder, s/p to it. DO NOT add chicken to sauce until you serve. I also fried chicken earlier and then reheated in over 350 10-15 minutes.

I gave this 3 stars because only the breaded chicken turned out good. It even made great left overs without the sauce. On the other hand, the sauce was horrible. I ended up quickly looking for another sweet n sour sauce recipe which had ketcup and viniger. That worked much better for me.

This recipe is awesome!  Other than being time consuming, it was wonderful.  Even my picky two-year-old, Princess Mac&Cheese,loved it. Next time I'll make sure that I have plenty of time and an extra set of hands.  Thanks for the wonderful take-out replacement!

This recipe was fabulous!  All four of my girls loved the chicken!  At the tender ages of 7,5,3, and 2 they are food critics and said that the sauce wasnt the right color and they did not really like the green peppers and pinapple chunks served with the sauce but they loved the chicken!  I will definitely make this again.  The only problem is that frying the chicken was very time consuming!  But in my eyes well worth it.  Thanks for a great recipe

We loved this.  My 14 yr old wanted Chinese takeout and we are trying not to dine out so I told her I would make it at home.  She was disappointed until she tried the at home version.  My whole family thought this was better than any takeout!  yeah!

The chicken turned out wonderful!!  Everyone raved about it even my picky 2 yr old loved it.  As for the sauce it was good overall but I will use red wine vinegar next time in place of the white distilled vinegar.  I also had to add more water to my sauce for it turned out very thick.  Place my pine apple carrots and green peppers in my cause to simmer while I cooked the chicken.  Great quick on the spot meal, longest part was cooking the chicken took less then an hour to finish the whole meal.

I love sweet and sour chicken so was very excited to try this recipe.  After A LOT of work, I wasn't that impressed.  My husband really liked it, but I wasn't a big fan.  I didn't like the sauce, which is one of the most important parts.

It was very good. The only thing I would change is to saute the pineapples and the green peppers before serving them. Other than that our family loved it.

After reading reviews about how good the batter was I tried it. It came out hard and tough not crisy and fluffy like reasturant. My husband loves chinese food and he eats it almost everyday. Was not a winner. Didnt even try the sauce because of some bad reviews so I found another one.

The fried chicken pieces reminded me of Chili's Chicken crispers.  The batter worked great.  I sauteed the green peppers slightly before serving.  I had four teenage boys at the dinner table and they all liked it.

This recipe is absolutely deliciious. Very first time making it at home and was completly surprised. Everybody loved it,even my kids who are very finicky. They LOVED the chicken. I didnt add the peppers and pineapple chunks like it said. I did use them but i diced up the peppers very small and used crushed up the chunks and added them to my sauce. I then made fried rice and put some of the sauce over the rice. Batter is enough to cover about 8-9 chicken breasts so if you need less I would just cut it in half. I also used a deep fry and it didnt take that long to cook all the chicken. Will definately make this recipe again.

Great recipe!  Customized it for 4 and my husband and I ate the whole thing!  Think 1/2 of batter would have been sufficient.  Added tomato chunks for color.  Next time will add some sliced carrots to add to the presentation - very colorful!

This recipe is very yummy. The reason that I am giving 3 stars is because it took forever to make. I was in the kitchen for 3 hours. We didn't eat dinner until 8:00pm. I was also making beef broccoli, but 3 hours?

Preparing the chicken and the sauce with all of the ingredients were a little time consuming.  Once that is out of the way everything went smoothly.  The chicken came out golden brown and it tasted as good as it looked.  The sauce was awesome too!

I was looking for a simple batter recipe for deep fried sweet and sour chicken. This was great! And super easy. I didn't try the sauce but I would like to later. Would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to make close to restaraunt style deep fried sweet and sour chicken. Just wish I knew the secret to keeping the chicken from sticking to the bottom of the strainer. I used a deep fryer. Thanks! My husband really liekd it.

I didn't use the sauce- I went and bought LaChoy's Sweet and Sour, so I'm not sure how the sauce tastes.

The chicken was excellent. I didn't pan fry it though- I used a deep frier, and it
came out perfect! Not only did it taste well plain as well as with the Sweet and Sour sauce,
but it would be perfect for other sauces.

I highly recommend this. Everyone loved it!

Great deep-fry batter for the chicken.  I can't wait to try it with pork.  I'm using a different sauce though -- haven't tried to make the sauce from this one.

Sweet and Sour chicken was great!!!...Kids loved it...Sauce was easy to make!!!...Don't recomend cooking in a deep fryer, clumps all together (after 15 minutes of cooking, chicken was still raw in the middle because it was all clumped together and batter came off chicken!)and makes the cooking time a whole lot longer!!!  Sauce was really yummy and went great with fried rice and crab ragoons!!!  Need to make a second batch of the sauce if you like a lot of sauce!!!

The batter for the chicken was excellent, I fried some leftover veggies (mushrooms & broccoli) and they were great in it too.  I also put the peppers & pineapple in the sauce after cooking it and my husband loved it!!

Great recipe! A nice change of pace at dinner. It does take some time though, mostly becuase of all the frying. Make sure to store leftover sauce and chicken seperatly, or the chicken will get soggy.

WOW-what an easy, impressive concoction!  I have always wanted to be able to make my favorite Chinese restaurant dish, and now I can!  Even my very picky kids & my "I don't like Chinese food" husband loved it.

This sweet and sour chicken is better than some I've had at restaurants.  It's quick, easy and delicious!  I highly recommend it.

Sauce is excellent!!!!!!  The batter on the chicken is a little too thick.  I could not get the batter to stick to the chicken in a more thin manner.  I could have altered the recipie to thin it out alittle and that may have worked.  I also believe that onions should be included in the recepie.

My husband loved it! As did another review advised, I added the bell pepper and pineapple to the sauce. Great flavor and the peppers are soft,not crunchy.Prep was a bit messy, but well worth the clean up time.

This is so dag gone good! The sauce is BOSS! I took the advice of one of the Most Helpful reviews and I seasoned my chicken after cutting it. I used Mrs. Dash Garlic & Onion, garlic powder, salt & pepper liberally. What a difference.  The chicken was so flavorful. You could eat the chicken and use the sauce as a dip. I served this over rice and hubby loved it so much he had a second helping. A new staple.

I have never given out a one star review and I cook a bunch and usually love the recipes.  This was awful.  From step one on - chicken never browned, and was greasy.  My husband thinks it’s “edible”, but I reach higher.

Really yummy sauce, but I couldn’t get the texture right on the chicken breading. Maybe it was my (lack of) wok skills.

I absolutely suggest that you watch the video, the instructions are not real clear and I put the batter into the sweet sour sauce! Watched the video and it was very clear where I went wrong. Watch the video!!  Am making again and will rate again.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. However, the sauce needed a little tang, and step 2 should be step one because by the time the chicken was cooked the sauce needed to be reheated. Another thing I would add is more pepper, and sautéing the peppers and pineapple together for a few minutes,  because it really elevated the tastiness of the dish. 8.5/10 would make again!

Hey, want a slightly different but easy way to turn this into ORANGE CHICKEN?  Substitute 4-6 tablespoons of FROZEN ORANGE JUICE for 1/4 cup of the water.  Wow!

Great recipe.  However, I did make the following changes:

1. Used store-bought sweet and sour sauce.  This reduced my prep time.

2.Substituted chicken thighs for breasts.

2. Made my own self-rising flour using the ratio of 1C all-purpose flour, 1.5t baking powder, and .25t salt.

3. I added chopped green onion and shredded carrots.

4. I stir-fried the green pepper, pineapple, green onion, and carrots for a few minutes, then added deep-fried chicken pieces and sweet and sour sauce.  I continued stir frying for a few minutes so everything was a uniform temperature.  I think this really makes the pineapple flavor pop.

My wife and kids were convinced the final product was from the Chinese restaurant.  I will make this again!

it was good but you should make the  the sauce last and if you plan of having left overs keep the sauce on the side so the chicken doesn't get soggy. ;)

Made it according to the recipe. Very good. Loved the chicken which I kept separate and served the sauce on the side. I'll make this again. I might add some Hot Pepper Jelly to the sauce next time.

only thing I did was cut out the pineapple, I used organic pineapple juice instead about 1/2 cut and will probably cut that down to 1/4 next time other than that this was by far the best Chinese dish I have ever made from home, taste just like from the restaurant

This was better than many restaurants! My husband loved the tempura like batter on the chicken. I made a double recipe of the sauce and it came out wonderful. We put the pineapple in the sauce as the only change since we wanted the pineapple hot (didn't use the peppers). This is a keeper!

I am not sure what I did wrong but it seems like the water to corn starch ratio is WAY off.  I had to remake it all over again with less water and even then it didn't turn out right. Also, it was way too much water in my sauce. I have made sweet and sour chicken plenty of times with other recipes and it turned out awesome. This was just weird. I can say though, it didn't taste bad, its just not even close to restaurant style. I'm tempted to one star this but because my family still ate it I'll give it two.

Pretty good recipe, but I made a few changes. First of all, they don’t really say what to do with all the vegetables. I basically stir fried onion, celery, carrots, green and red pepper, on the side with some teriyaki... Then after they were soft I added them to the sweet-and-sour sauce.  Also, the chicken needed more salt and pepper.

Yummy, easy recipe my whole family loved! A bit time consuming if you make a large batch like I did.... but so worth it! I was afraid the vinegar would be too strong because it's gives off s strong smell while cooking but once its cook down it tastes fine.

This was good but not great. I will most likely make it again but I'll tweak it a bit. I didn't really love the sauce. I make a mean sweet and sour kielbasa and pineapple and I think I'll use that sauce on it next time...which, I know I know, changes the  recipe completely. The batter was good. The chicken came out nicely breaded, browned and crispy. Also, I'll probably add some matchstick carrots.

Not a bad recipe, but this needs to be done in batches or else it doesn't fry well. That means that the breading won't turn into that crispy exterior we all know from take out restaurants.

I made this recipe using Bobs Red Mill cup for cup gluten free flour. The batter turned out really good. The sauce was amazing! I changed the green peppers to orange and cut up a Maui sweet onion. Along with the pineapple chunks, everything looked yummy and tasted just as good!

Will definitely not be making again. It took forever and was worded funny. In the end all of the breading ended up peeling off the chicken during the frying process leaving me with naked chicken and a bunch of fried breading floating around, which made it taste mushy in a way. I seriously don’t understand how others got theirs to look so perfect, will not be attempting again. I will leave my sweet and sour to the professionals.

Great recipe! I doubled the sauce for 4 ppl (made sauce for 8). And when the sauce was done I pulled it off the burner and put in the pineapple, green pepper & added mushrooms too (I like veggies) so they softened up & flavour sunk in. Reheated when ready to put on chicken. Didn’t have self rising flour so put in a teaspoon of baking powder & 1/2 tsp of salt. Everything was FaBuLOus! We all loved this recipe. Would make it again.

The batter was perfect. I used club soda in place of water. Light perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy flavorful chicken in the inside. I made my own sweet and sour sauce from another recipe here. Big hit and big savings at home for this restaurant  style recipe.

Excellent recipe! The only thing I would do different is either salt or season the chicken before putting it in the batter.

The basics are here, and I'm so glad to have the how to and the sauce recipe now!  I'd like to try to use a few more flavors,  textures and colors...so next time, (and there will be MANY more next times!), I'm going to try adding a can of water chestnuts, a few maraschino cherries, some sautéed until slightly soft onions, some shredded carrots (maybe I'll slightly saute them as well), and just do red food coloring instead of trying for orange.  I prefer not to color the food, but it does need a bit of color, but just a few drops of red would be fine I think.  I used those panko'ed chicken breast pieces that have just come out, and after I cooked them I cut them in pieces.  That way I just did some rice, cut up the veggies and meat and cooked the sauce up - it saved me a LOT of time and trouble over having to make a batter, cut up raw chicken and do all that deep frying, and they were very good! a very effective substitute!  In future, I might try at least once to make it with unbreaded chicken strips, and save some calories and carbs, and be able to serve it to my gluten free twins.  I think this could also be made with some orange segments for even more flavor, and some toasted almond pieces or slices.

I loved it. I added a little ginger to the chicken batter and I should have cooked it for 7-8 min instead of 10 but I was using a deep fryer.

This was so good... and very easy.  I didn't make the breading... instead I just tossed the chicken in a couple tablespoons of flour before sauteing...  I also grilled the Peppers with onions before adding the chicken, pineapple chunks and sauce... The sauce was awesome... I didn't use food coloring.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

My kids love this recipe.  It’s one of the few dishes they can all agree on.  It’s fairly time consuming for a weekday meal, partially because I don’t have a deep fryer so I make smaller batches but worth it

recipe is bland...the sauce is sweet but needs more interest, maybe orange peel or some heat.  the batter for the chicken fried up beautifully but be sure to season the chicken as well before coating and frying.

Gave it 4 stars because there could be something better (just haven't found it yet). Came out just great; everybody loved it. Substituted Anaheim Peppers for the Bell pepper, since I do not like bell pepper.

I made quite  a mess making this meal but the end result was worth the clean up. Added the green pepper and pineapple chunks to thickened sauce and allowed to simmer for awhile. Great sweet and sour chicken.

I found a couple problems with this, mainly that the amount of chicken is WAY off. I only used about half the chicken and had to triple the amount of sauce. The batter, however, is Really good and I will be using it in various other recipes. For my kids I used a different color and they loved it. Just that minor adjustment and that I added some veggies to it and everyone loved it!

I'm not the best cook but I can certainly follow a recipe, and this one is a failure.  First, I do NOT recommend breading the chicken; you'll find yourself hunting for little pieces of meat in a white muddy mess and the payoff isn't worth it.  Just cook the chicken pieces until they're done.  Second, I used 4 chicken breasts and barely had enough sauce for those, so I can't imagine making this recipe for 8.  Third, I would recommend using more veggies than what this recipe called for; I used both red and green peppers, along with water chestnuts.  I also recommend sauteing the veggies a little bit so they're not so crunchy, but that's my personal taste.  With all of that said, it was still pretty bad and I ended up throwing it away.  A waste of money, food, and time.

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe is and it turn out great.  I have made it twice and the second time I doubled the sauce but I like mine drowned in sweet and sour sauce.  I served this with fried rice and it has been a hit in our home.

I am really rating the sauce.  It was a little "vinegary" so I added extra honey, then it was great.  I serviced with white rice  and broccoli and spooned the sauce over it all. My family really liked it a lot.  I also sauteed red/yellow/orange peppers with the chicken just to include more vegetables. You really could use any veggies you want (like carrots, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts (OK, that's not a veggie) etc.  I'm also guessing you could skip coating the chicken and saute it plain. The sauce will still make it taste really good. Also NO FOOD COLORING. Not sure why that's even in there.

This was a huge hit at my house.  For the chicken I just used eggs and cornstarch without any flour due to wheat issues.  Still turned out great and I will definitely make it again.

My wife and I both enjoyed this recipe and, in fact, recommended it to our daughter-in-law last night. Easy to prep and cook. 
The only comments are 1.) add 1-2 more green peppers, 2.) place chicken in batter in skillet one at a time or they will clump, and 3.) you don't need the dye but it makes it look more appetizing.

I always make the recipe the way it is printed first.  Next time I will heat up the pineapple and green pepper.  Otherwise, good flavor.

really, really easy if you use frozen chicken nuggets to save time). The sauce was really good and tasted just like in the takeout restaurants.

Wonderful recipe! I made several changes as well and served it over basmati rice. We had that as a sunday lunch right after church and everyone enjoyed it! Changes I made:

1. Seasoned the chicken with chicken boullion, garlic powder and onion powder. 
2. Added red bellpepper and sliced carrots to the green pepper, seasoned it with roasted garlic and onion power   and  sauteed it for about 5 minutes in peanut oil. 

Note: I think the corn starch needs to be ommitted in the batter to fry the chicken peices. Adding the corn starch makes the chicken hard to chew.  But I must say overall, it was a great success for making it the first time and I will definitely be making this again and again and again.

One of our favorite meals! Made this a couple times already. It will definitely be a regular for our family. The only thing I did different was use Louisiana spicy chicken batter mix (Walmart), I also used can of crushed pineapple.

Better than the restaurant! This has cracked the dinner rotation. The only deviation I made was to fry the coated chicken in batches, pulling each batch when they begin to turn golden brown. When the first batch is complete I return the batches to the deep fryer for a finishing fry, pulling when deep golden brown. Perfection!

My husband is the Chinese food lover, and he said it was good.  We really liked the batter-fried chicken, and will do it again with more seasoning.

I did feel a bit overwhelmed by fixing the chicken, sauce, and rice all at one time.  I have a lot of the sauce left over, so that will be saved and used again later.

Great recipe!  There is too much sweet and sour sauce for my family to use, but others may like that much. I've found I don't use about a third of the water in the batter.

I really enjoyed this an making it my own! I seasoned the batter mixture, like others did. I put onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper until it had a decent aroma to it. I fried the chicken in 2 batches, dropping it in, piece by piece. I cooked them until golden, not necessarily 10 minutes. To my sweet and sour sauce, I added hot chili sauce (sriracha) and a tad more vinegar and sugar. Adding the red sauce made it unnecessary to add food coloring as it becomes orange naturally. I also cooked the pineapple in my sauce, altogether. Lastly, after frying the chicken, I put my bell peppers (red and green) into a small amount of the oil and cooked it on high heat to take away some of the "rawness" that would definitely not be appreciated by the hubby. He was very impressed, as was I... my r old

I will definitely make this again! Although time consuming, it was a very easy recipe for beginners. I bought sweet and sour sauce, just in case mine did not turn out bc this was my first attempt at a Chinese dish. But it was so easy and my sauce turned out delicious! Thanks for the recipe, it was a hit!

This was a very good supper.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because it took much longer for me to prepare than receipe states.  I agree with the first woman, in order for the cornstarch not to clump I took some of the liquid from the sauce and the cornstarch in a glass bowl and mixed until creamy than added slowly to my sauce at a simmer on the stove.
The batter was one of the best I have had for this receipe. It stays contected to the chicken.  My kids loved just the chicken. Highly recommend it.

I make this at least once a month! This recipe is great as is and you don't have to change anything. HOWEVER, please allow yourself 2 hours to make this start to finish. Cooking the chicken in batches is what takes the longest. Plan on 3-4 batches when using a large frying pan. It's worth it though - the whole family loves it!

Very good!  I used about 1/14 cups water in the batter.  I doubled the sauce but probably didn't need to since my kids chose to eat their chicken with sauce from Buffalo Wild Wings.  Will definitely make again.

I made this last night and I must say that it is by far the closest recipe to what they sell in the restaurants.  I used the pineapple and juice by blending together to make more juice since I only had one can and had to make a triple batch.  It was so easy to make that even though I am in a back brace and limited to what I can do, I could make it easily.  I am so pleased with this recipe, I recommend it to everyone!  Also it is so easy my daughter that is 15 can make it on her own as well!  All four of my kids and my husband loved it as well!

The batter mixture was great; coated and browned nicely.  Sauce could use more flavor but still yummy.  I only used half the recipe for the four half chicken breasts I had on hand, and it was more than enough food for my family of five.  This recipe is a keeper!

It was really yummy after I made some changes to the sauce. Added some Sambal oelek and a drop of hoisin sauce. Omitted the pineapple (personal choice). I also seasoned the chicken a little bit with salt and pepper before coating in the mixture. And sautéed the peppers a little bit.

This recipe is just OK  it needs some tweaking  Add   2 cloves garlic minced, a carrot cut in matchsticks  1 teaspoon ginger 2 -3 teaspoons soy sauce   I only use regular flour no need for self rising flour  also use apple cider vinegar  and  no need for food coloring salt & pepper to taste MUCH BETTER!!

This was so easy. I am not a big cook, but this was not hard at all. I love the way the chicken comes out. I just wish the sweet sauce wasn't so large, I usually have to throw half away. My family loved it and I have made it several times.

Wow! Tasted JUST like restaurant sweet and sour chicken! Amazing. And easy!!  The only change I made was to not add food coloring. Needless chemical . I did however add  a sprinkle of turmeric. It made it a beautiful yellow color!

The recipe is really good.  I did however forget to add the pineapple but I did add some baby corns , which was a good combination.  The only problem was that the chicken was cut too big. Next time I will make the pieces smaller.  But overall, great recipe. Hubby and son were very happy.

It was a super hit with my family even my super picky father  loved it. I doubled the recipe so we can eat it later too. But heads up for non american friends, the sauce was too sugary for our taste I'd recommend to cut it down maybe 1/2 a cup.

This is just DELICIOUS & so easy... Ingredients are readily found in your kitchen and no special Chinese ingredients are  needed. Just two variables... I did stir fry the green peppers and also added yellow onions thickly cut. I don't like raw peppers. I also used less water for the batter about 1 1/4 cup instead of 1 1/2.  I had  steamed white rice & steamed Oriental vegetables that come frozen as part of my dish. You will definitely love this recipe. I am a long time lover of Oriental cuisine especially Chinese and without a doubt, this compares favorably with fancy restaurants I've been to. Give it a try.... enjoy.

This is so good. The recipe for the batter of the chicken is out of sight. I have used it to make other chicken dishes. On this dish I added more pineapple juice to the sauce and added soy sauce.  I also used seasoning salt, onion and garlic powder to season up the chicken batter. It was too bland the first time I made it and figured soy sauce would spice up the sauce and it was great!

This is the only realistic restaurant Chinese chicken we've ever made. We accidentally used double the amount of pineapple juice, but we liked it more that way.

For the flour, I substituted half of the flour with rice flour and reduced the water. I added onion to the peppers. I thought it was very good.

Thus was soooo good. The only thing I did not do is put the food color. The chicken gets brown already so that was fine with me. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this recipe and it was really good.  First I made the sauce.  I used 1 8oz. Can crushed pineapple, used some frozen stir fry mix of red, yellow & green peppers with onions.  Sauted the peppers & onions on low heat covered.  Added peppers, onions and pineapple to the sauce.  Used ground black pepper instead of white pepper.  Used only 1cup of sugar.  Warmed the sauce back up after pan frying the chicken and mixed everything in it and then poured it over the chicken and mixed til well coated. I also used canola oil instead of vegetable oil.  I only used 4 chicken breast.

The consistency of the chicken itself was very good but if I make this again (and I will), I will be a lot more liberal with the spices as this came out a little bland for our tastes. More salt, pepper, and maybe paprika and chili powder would do it for me.

Really great recipe!! Made a few changes tho. I used fresh pineapple chunks ... Blended and used a sieve to get rid of the pulp. Once I made the sauce, I kept it aside and on a wok I sautéed some onions and added the rest of the things( fried chicken, capsicum and pineapple pcs) and mixed everything together

I followed these changes made by other reviews:
Cubed then seasoned meat let sit in fridge for 30 mins.
Reduced water in sauce, but not by much.
The only difference I made was I used pork because I was out of chicken. Made with fried rice and homemade egg rolls. 
Warning: keep family away from the kitchen if you want them to have food on the table. Mine stood with forks in hand as I cookex.

This was pretty good. I didn't wind using the sauce as it wasn't amazing! Lucikly I had a bottle of sweet and sour sauce in the pantry. I don't know what I did wrong but the flour mixture definitely was not like a batter I added some water and that didn't help much. Not sure what happened there.

The only change i made was to season the chicken as someone had recommended.  One problem was that the batter was a little runny so it fell to the side i was frying, but i could have just added more flour.  So maybe don't add so much water.  It was a great recipe that my whole family loved and we will definitely make again!

It was so thick and elastic it wouldn't coat the chicken.  I tried to coat the chicken and put it in the frying pan, but it was very thick, lumpy and wouldn't stick to part of the chicken pieces.  Don't know what I did wrong, but I gave up at that point.

What I did to kick up the pineapple flavor was to have double the pineapple. I added one whole can to the sauce and used my immersion blender to puree the fruit.  It'll get foamy, but that cooks out. Also instead of using food dye, I used about a heaping teaspoon of concentrated tomato paste. You won't taste it, but it adds a bit of natural color. Others have also made the important tip of blending your cornstarch with a bit of cold water before whisking it into the sauce to avoid lumps.

I am never successful at frying anything but this came out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the food color.  I'm okay with it being clear and would prefer to leave that nasty little additive out.  The chicken is golden so do you really need the sauce to be orange?    Will make again .

This recipe is a restaurant Sweet and sour one. I absolutely love it! I made these amendments that I highly recommend:
1- The Sauce: I added around 1tsp SALT and some CHILLI POWDER. It really helps bring out the flavor and add some nice heat.
2- The Green Bell peppers: I suggest putting them in the hot sauce for some time so that they are cooked a bit.

As BPRWatson suggested, I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder after chopping and let it relax in the fridge for an hour before cooking it.  Great idea!  The wife and I loved it!  I'll make this again.  Thanks!

This was delicious.  I made a few changes which were preferences and really didn't change it too much.  I did what other commenters said about the baking powder and salt instead of self rising flour.  I also added red pepper flakes to the sauce.  Gave it a nice kick.  I cooked the veggies(carrot, bell pepper, jalapeno, asparagus, onion, garlic, and just before serving, pineapple) in a separate pan, with some of the sauce.  So good.   Would definitely make this again.

This turned out amazing! Just like the restaurants make. I steamed carrots and green peppers in a separate pan and did not add coloring to the sauce. Once sauce was cooked I added pineapple chunks directly to that. To plate, I start with a bed of chicken fried rice, add the breaded chicken chunks, add carrots and green peppers and then top it all with sauce. This will definitely be in rotation at my house.

Spectacular! This meal was better than from a restaurant. The only changes I made to the recipe was t marinate the chicken after cutting it up into pieces, and before I used it in the batter. I marinated the chicken first in salt, pepper, and apple cider vinegar for 30 minutes, then I removed the chicken from the vinegar and marinated it in Brags Aminos (which I strongly prefer to soy sauce) for another 30 minutes. The dish was amazing. I will be making this again.

Looked just like picture.  Was very easy to make.  Just a bit bland.  Especially the chicken/batter.  Should have read through the reviews to get some flavor ideas.  Will definitely try it again.  Made a generous amount.  Enough for a family.

Batter seemed a bit heavy, might make a tempura next time.  In the future I'll lightly saute the peppers a bit, were a bit too much raw.

Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing!  I did what most suggested; 1. Season chicken with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder and refrigerated covered for 1 hour.  2.  Added 2 tbsp. soy sauce to the reserved pineapple juice.  3.  Did not have self rising flour and added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder to all purpose flour.  4.  Did not use green pepper.  5.  Served over cooked white rice.

First time making a Chinese dish, wasn't as complicated as I thought it was going to be!

I followed the suggestions left by others by; seasoning the chicken breasts the night before with garlic, onion, pepper and celery seed. For the sauce, I added some ketchup for a little tang. It also replaced the need for food coloring. I added red bell pepper as well as green bell pepper. After frying all the chicken, I sautéed the veggies with some chopped garlic, added the chicken, then ladled the sauce over everything. I didn't want it soggy so, I have a lot of sauce left. I added pineapple at the end.

This was delicious.  I made no changes to the batter and it was perfect and made for some perfectly crispy chicken.  The sweet and sour sauce was also wonderful.  The only changes I made were to season the chicken and to stir fry the veggies with a little soy sauce, sesame oil, and garlic.  I've always loved sweet and sour chicken but hated how the veggies were raw.

Very good recipe, I've never been able to make any kind of Chinese inspired dish before without failing miserably, but this one turned out great! Followed the recipe exactly except that I added a bit of dried ginger and spicy chili paste to the sauce to give it a bit more of a kick. Will definitely be making this again in the future.

We made this and it was fantastic.  I recommend adding additional color as a couple drops was not enough for the vibrant orange color.  I would have given 5 stars however; we had to turn the heat back on after adding starch to the sauce.  It required a slow flame to thicken.  That is an important tip to this recipe.  We simmered and stirred for an additional 5 minutes or so to get the thick consistency of the sweet and sour sauce.  We enjoyed this meal.  We are keeping this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

This was excellent!!  Picky hubs thought it was better than the take out place close to us.  I will definitely be making this again.  The only thing I will do different is use less vinegar in the sauce.  It was just a bit to "zingy" for us.  Mine thickened up perfectly.  I did saute a red and yellow bell pepper and then proceeded with the sauce in the same pan.  I used a 20 oz can of pineapple in its own juice and used it all.  This does make a good bit of sauce so I'm going to freeze it and have it ready for next time.

This recipe was outstanding. The leftovers for next day was even more tasty! However, I did not add the amount of water the recipe called for. I added 1 cup and then 1/4 with the cornstarch. Still a little to watery so will do less water next time. I also felt like the sauce needed some hot pepper and salt! The chicken i followed as is and it came out perfect! Even my picky husband told me this is a keeper! He hates fruit in his food so that is a nice compliment! Highly recommend this recipe! Thanks

I made this tonight, but used leftover diced chicken breast because I didn't have any fresh chicken.  Instead of battering it, I just sauteed it in a bit of vegetable oil and added granulated garlic and chopped frozen green peppers until it was warm.  I made the sauce exactly as the recipe, but added it to the pan with the chicken and peppers so as not to dirty up another pan.  I had a few leftover "boneless chicken wings" which I added to the kids' plates.  I liked it and so did my younger son, but I think if I made it this way again, I'd add a vegetable for some texture, such as broccoli, water chestnuts and/or carrots.  Also would use a bit less sugar, since I prefer it to be a bit tangier.  Might try a Splenda/sugar mix next time.  Just a tad too sweet, but still pretty good.  I topped it with sliced green onions.  I also need to tweak the color - red and yellow didn't make orange, more like a coral pink color, which reminded me of raw chicken.

I surprised my wife with this dish and she loved it. She is not a big fan of fried food, but found this coating to be very light and tasty. I am going to use shredded pineapple instead of chunk, and am going to try pork this time. Same sauce though.

This is quite yummy!  Following some other reviews, I put some salt and pepper and garlic powder on the chicken previous to cooking it & added a bit more garlic powder to the batter & it turned out well. I also sautéed onions, bell peppers & carrots and added them to the sauce, along with half the pineapple. I served this with rice. My kids loved it too!

I made this the other night, we own a small fryer so it made cooking them a bit easier. It was SOOO good. It tasted even better than our local Chinese place. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of the food coloring. Although in the future I will be using the food coloring, the reason being is that the sauce without it is translucent white, which makes it harder to see when it's all put together with rice and chicken, so you cant really tell which bites have sauce and which bites don't.
This recipe is amazing and at the top of our favorites list!

Mmmmhhh... Thanks to the reviews I made some changes to the recipe because I didn´t have the rising flour. Thank you for that.
I graded it with a 4 star because the best thing of the recipe was the crispyness of the chicken and that was awesome! but I really didn´t enjoy that much the sauce... I saw the ingredients of the sauce and thought it was too plain and in the end it really was like that. Will try to change the sauce next time... but the chicken was awesome!

Didn't like the way the chicken came out, next time I'll make that my own way. But the sauce was delicious. Served over rice.

Excellent!  Followed suggestions and used garlic powder and onion powder for chicken. Loved the batter. Sauce was easy to make and just the right combination of sweet and sour. Served over brown rice. Will save this and make again.

I looked thru all the reviews and seen nothing about the green pepper being raw when served. Perhaps this was suppose to be uncooked...but, I had to saute the pepper and then all was good.

The recipe for the chicken and sauce was fantastic. It surprised me how much the sauce tasted like my local Chinese resturant. I gave it 4 stars because I didn't particularly care too much for the pineapples and green peppers. I served this over white rice.

This is so good and so much better than your typical american chinese restaurant.  It takes quite a long time so if you need it finished faster, cut the chicken into larger slices or "fingers".  This is a ton of batter also so you may want to cut in half if you do the large pieces of chicken.  Delicious!

I made this recipe for a Chinese New Year celebration we hosted at our senior center and they loved it! Very easy and delicious. I pretty much followed the recipe as printed and had no difficulties. I just wish I'd made more sauce, but overall, it was a winner.

Loved it and made plenty for my huge family. The one thing that I did different was that I stir fried half an onion, one bell pepper, sugar snap peas and shredded carrots. I added the pineapple at the end and cooked it all together for a few minutes then I dumped the sweet and sour sauce over the veggies. This allowed me to cater to the vegetarians in my family. Also made sure that the sauce was evenly distributed and forced the all the kids to eat the veggies:)
For the vegetarians, I used the same batter and coated veggie chicken strips and fried them prior to using the oil for the regular chicken.
This is a perfect recipe for a large family and works well for a mixed family of meat-eaters/vegetarians.

A very nice recipe. I tried it today for lunch and served it with plain rice. I made little changes with the recipe, I used 2-3 garlic cloves instead of its powder, used white granulated sugar,with more salt and pepper and added 2 tablespoon of vinegar, and 1 teaspoon chilli sause. The unique thing about this recipe I found was the frying of chicken pc, which enhanced its taste.

Absolutely fantastic.  My guy said it was better than any restaurant could do!  The batter was crazy thick but I learned how to master it quickly.  It will become a regular in our house.  Thank you for a wonderful dinner recipe.

This ended up being much easier to make than I thought and it came out really well. I did have a little trouble getting the batter to stick to the chicken for some reason, not sure if that was the recipe or user error. I would definitely make this again. Everyone really liked it and it's even better than the version most Chinese delivery places serve. The only change I made was a little squirt of sriracha instead of the good coloring. It didn't make it spicy but added a little color and flavor.

This recipe turned out to be even more tastier than I imagined. I added broccoli and onions to the dish (saute separately) and it was quite the  hit.

Love this recipe, as is and have added things also to change it up. I do not use food coloring as the color of the sauce doesnt really matter to me. Thanks for an easy sweet n sour chicken.

Very good, I found that I prefer to use pineapple tidbits rather than the larger chunks, so you get smaller bits of pineapple more evenly distributed throughout the dish. We also like to sprinkle some Chinese Noodles over the top for a little crunch.

The entire family said they would eat it again! I excluded the food coloring and the corn starch and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I am glad I took advice of the earlier reviews and added powdered garlic and dried parsley to the batter. 

The chicken did take a lot longer than I expected, I'm glad I started early and then kept it warm in the oven.

Did not like the sauce at all!! Not sure if it was too much vinegar or just the wrong kind. Maybe next time I will use rice wine vinegar.

I followed this recipe to the T (oops! I actually seasoned the raw chicken pieces with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and used a 20oz can of pineapple chunks) and I have got to say I agree that this recipe is definitely better than the restaurant entree.  I fried the small pieces for about 8-9 minutes.  I will for sure make this again.  My family loved it!! Thanks for sharing!

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I was asked to add it to the list of recipes I make.  I made an adjustment to the recipe, I seasoned the chicken with onion and garlic powders salt and pepper before battering. The chicken was tasty without the sweet and sour sauce, but it was even better with it.

Turned out great.  Kids said it was better than the Chinese restaurant we go to.  The only thing I had to change was add an extra tbls of corn starch and water to help thicken the sauce. Thought the batter was a little thick but went with and and was very happy with the results!  Will definitely be making it again!

I made this for company and got raves.  I didnt change one thing and served it with a starter of Hot and Sour soup and used Chinese Sticky Rice to serve the chicken over.  Next timeI will double the sauce as someone suggested.  I only used 6 breasts and didnt really have enough sauce to go around. This recipe is a keeper!!

I couldn't believe it came out right the first time, but I did put my twist on it. Instead of using only chicken breast, I used chicken thighs and some breast. Breast are so dry when fried to a golden brown. After making the sauce I added some dry chili peppers and a dash of red pepper flakes. While the sauce was still hot I added the bell peppers. Then after I completed the chicken , I mix all ingredient together. (NOTE:) If you use only chicken breast, you will need to use some old cooking oil with fresh oil for color so it wont cook to long and dry out. We had it with shrimp fried Rice (recipe on this site) .

Tried this recipe today . Really nice pineapple flavour . I did make a couple changes to suit our diet  didn't use the coating just fried the chicken in a little olive oil with a little soya sauce , dried onions & pepper . Also when I made the sauce I used agave nectar instead of sugar . No peppers for  me so added some sliced carrots for colour . I also only used 4 pieces of chicken but didn't change the sauce amount . Had with plain rice and sliced tomatoes on the side .

I didn't like the breading... it was too bread-doughy for me (not that it wasn't cooked but rather the consistency of the batter and how it cooked up). I prefer crispier breading.

I made this for a large group (Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister-in-law, sister, boyfriend, and myself), and we still had left-overs, even after EVERYONE (including my picky sis) went back for seconds! My boyfriend ate the left-overs every day until I threw it out... He absolutely LOVES This recipe, and even asked me to make it as one of our date night dinners.. It was yummy and easy! This was my first attempt at Chinese food and I was very pleased with the results!

This recipe is great, but it took a really long time and made a big mess of the kitchen.  I'd use the recipe again, but it will be few and far between.

My Kids LOVED this recipe! They said it was way better than our favorite chinese restaurant.  

The only think I added for fun and flavor:
Once I cut up all my chicken and bowled it... When they grease was hot I added the juice to the grease.
Then put the chicken in the batter.

One other think I used green, yellow, red and orange pepper. Just like the pic but added orange pepper.
This is an awesome recipe and is perfect.

For those that want a spicy chicken (salt, garlic, spices), that is not sweet and sour chicken but go for it.. ;-)

I love this! but my husband loves it more, he requests me to make it every friday to bring it to work. i can never get the sauce right so we just pick up a bottle at the grocery store along with a packet of seasoning for fried rice and I make the Egg Drop Soup By Brian Gillette and Voila! Chinese Night! YUM!

my husband and I loved it, my 6 yr old did not b/c he said it does not taste like the joint down the street that we usually get. we only did the batter part, but took the suggestion to put in the baking powder/onion powder/salt & pepper. we also salt and peppered the chunks of meat b 4 battering.used other sauce.

I used my own sauce but followed the recipe  for the chicken and it turned out great! Maybe I'll try the recipe someday for the sauce, but I'm very stuck on Wegmans sweet and sour sauce lol.

I followed the recipe to a T!  It was wonderful.  The only thing different I would do is to season the chicken a bit more... otherwise it was a massive hit in my house!!

Made this for the first time yesterday. Considering I'm a total beginner who rarely hangs out in the kitchen, this turned out FANTASTIC. If I can make this, anyone can! Give it a try - you won't regret it!

Awesome recipe with some modifications. After reading another reviewer's suggestions, I added seasoning to the batter, onion powder, garlic and some seasoning salt. Otherwise I followed the recipe as is... fabulous!!

I can't believe I made Chinese - thanks to this recipe! It is a 3 step process and takes a little time. Not a good idea if you are in a hurry. Allow yourself time when making this. I halved the recipe by using 1 lb chicken tenderloins and cut them into bite size pieces- about 6 - 8, per tenderloin. I halved the ingredients for the batter and let the chicken soak in it while I made the sauce. I also halved the sauce. If you like a lot of sauce, I would recommend using the full measurements the recipe calls for. I did not have a thermometer to test the heat of the oil before frying my chicken so I just threw in a small piece of chicken and tested it that way. You know the oil is ready when there are lots of little bubbles. I sauteed/steamed the pepper, pineapple, and threw in some broccoli. You could add any vegetables. I accompanied this with fried rice also from this website. A great meal!!

This recipe was difficult, messy and not very healthy.  The ingredient list was not in order of use and the batter could use better instructions.  The result looked similar to the picture and was edible - even good.  I think it could get better with practice, but I don't think it is worth the effort to try again.

tasted pretty good but the sauce seemed to be lacking in flavor as did the batter. Next time I will add some spices to batter and find a better sweet and sour recipe.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I followed it exactly.  I can't believe how wonderfully puffy the chicken/crust turned out on these!!  My family loved it and my 12 year old son was thrilled that if we made them "plain" they would make perfect chicken nuggets!

OMG!!!  I made this last night for my family, and lets just saay, this is now a family favorite.  When I took the first batch out of the grease, I let my daughters taste one, and they were circling around the kitchen like hungry sharks for another one!  There were a few changes that I did make though, I seasoned the chicken, used boneless thighs instead of breast (they are way cheaper and you cant taste the difference) and added some parsley flakes to the batter, just because I like to have a little green pop in my batter sometimes!  Only one kid wanted to smother their chicken in the sauce, everyone else used dipping cups!!  GREAT RECIPE!!!

PERFECT! This turned out so good, just like my favorite chinese place! I was very proud of this one :) I followed the directions exactly, but used black pepper instead of white because I didn't have any, and made a different sauce because I forgot the pineapple chunks. Fried everything up in the wok and wa-la! If you like takeout sweet and sour chicken you are going to LOVE this!

This was really good.  I had a problem with the batter.  When I added the water it looked like a big dough ball so I had to keep adding water until I got a consistency I thought was right.  I left it "goopy" and not like a pancake batter and I'm glad I did because it tasted great!  I almost didn't put the food color in but the sauce without it would have been totally unappetizing.  I made mine more red than orange tho.  My husband is a very picky eater and he said he really liked it so it's a keeper for us!

Orange food coloring?  That's silly.  I see absolutely no reason to use it.
Also, this recipe needs soy-sauce!  It wasn't very good...until I added the soy sauce, then it was great!  I suggest adding a few dribbles of soy sauce (to taste) to the finished sweet and sour sauce.  This will not only DRAMATICALLY improve the taste, it will also add a nice, natural, authentic color so you won't need any food coloring.

This is the first time I have ever made Sweet and Sour anything and it turned out wonderful!! The hubby and all the kids loved it!!  The recipe was easy to follow.  I did add some garlic sauce to the chicken breading but followed recipe to a T other than that.  I don't have a deep fryer so I just fried chicken in a pan on the stove.  It was a little time consuming but still turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this.  The reviewers who said it made a huge mess had the oil heated too hot.  It is a little bit of a production, but well worth it.

I am only rating the sauce. Rather than coating & deep frying the chicken, I stir fried it so it would be more healthy. So I didn't really follow the whole recipe. The sauce was ok, I may try looking for another recipe. Don't try Sweet and Sour Chicken III from this site, it's terrible.

An excellent recipe. Very authentic.  Should be served with white, steamed, jasmine rice.  I can't think of anything to change in this recipe! It is a bit time-consuming and messy... but the result is well worth it.  Has been requested again and again.

It's a good base to start from. It had way too much of a vinegar taste for me. Ended up using an entire 20oz can of pinapple juice. Then had to add sugar in the end to cut the vinegar taste. I think maybe I'll try doing 1/2 cup water and add all the juice from a 20 oz and slowly add small amounts of vinegar. Also heard of putting brown sugar into the mix.

This recipe is absolutley delicious! To make it healthier, I added celery, onion and more peppers, and use half splenda half sugar instead of all sugar.  Instead of using noodles, serve the mixture on top of brown rice

This recipe turns out looking and tasting very good. If you plan on eating any of the left overs, do not pour the sauce over the entire dish - only on individual servings. The left overs will be soggy after soaking in sweet and sour sauce for even an hour.

Seriously, the best I've ever had homemade! My  husband won't ever GO to a chinese place he always makes me make this for him. The directions are a bit confusing but I follow the exact directions when making this and it turns out perfect! I don't add anything extra - follow it exactly. This is our weekly Tuesday supper. :)

Totally Wonderful!  I made this tonight for my family, one of which is my 8-year-old daughter who loves sweet and sour chicken at the typical chinese buffets.  She said it was better!  My husband also raved about it and ate so much he had to go to bed :).  I halved the batter/chicken part, and accidentally put the whole teaspoon of salt in the batter, as well as the whole egg.  It was still great!  The sauce definitely needs the food coloring...otherwise it's a little unappetizing-looking...clearish.  I served the sauce as a dipping sauce, though, and it was still a great hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly.  I'm sorry, but the sauce doesn't taste like any sweet and sour sauce I've tasted.  It's definitely missing a lot as is.  To "fix it", I added a little more sugar, soy sauce, ketchup, and more water to taste.  With those changes, I'd make it again.  Making it at yourself really tastes better than out of a jar.

This was super easy for someone who had never tried something like this before. I had way too much sauce left over but that was because my family isn't big on the sauce (personal preference). I will make this again for sure!

4 stars ONLY because I did do some tweaking accd. to my taste.  To the batter, I added garlic powder, seasoned meat tenderizer, used black pepper and some moroccan seasoning (i got it through pampered chef) plus i would suggest any other seasonings you desire.  In the sauce, I used 1 Tbs. of ketchup instead of food coloring and also about a tsp of soy sauce.  I used pineapple, onion, green pepper, and shaved carrots for vegetables and had water chestnuts and bamboo shoots on the side for those who weren't afraid to stray away from the traditional toppings.  Also, used brown whole grain rice.   I'm not big on frying anything but this was well worth it!

I didn't know this recipe was so easy! It turned out quite well.  I lowered the sugar and the vinegar a little bit to make the flavor a little less intense, but regardless of that, it was tasty. I used yellow color powder since I did not have orange food color. Definitely, a keeper.

AMAZING! I can't tell you how long I have searched for a restaurant quality SS Chicken recipe. At first, when I put all the batter ingredients together, I was a little skeptical because it seemed so sticky and gooey... but I went with it and it came out PERFECT! The only thing I would suggest is to season the chicken before you coat it. I used seasoned salt and ginger. I have a little fryer and I just drop the coated peices of chicken in and let them fry for about 10-12 mins. After making this a few times, I was able to nail it down to a flawless finish. I will never have to order this from a restaurant again because I can make it better at home! Most of the ingredients are standard in a kitchen pantry, so that's nice and convenient, too. The sauce is WONDERFUL as well, but I had to adjust the measurements of the ingredients to get it just the way I like it. We don't care for too much vinegar, so I reduced that a little and added a little more sugar/ pineapple juice (reserved from can) to make it sweeter. I threw raw pineapple chunks and green bell pepper in the sauce before serving and it came out PERFECT. Oh and I followed the suggestion from others as far as mixing the water and cornstarch before adding them to the sauce at the end. What an awesome recipe, my husband and kids request this at least every other week!

Really liked this recipe. I added and extra 1/4 cup vinegar the second time I made this, to give it some extra tang - excellent! The only other change I made was to cook the veggies all together with the sauce and added some water chestnuts for added crunch. This is a great recipe if you really enjoy sweet and sour chicken.

This was awesome!  I did add spices to the chicken batter garlic and onion powder, accent salt and I added scallions, carrots and water chestnuts.  One of the best dishes I've ever made.  I also added a small jar of sweet and sour  sauce to the sauce.

My family loved this recipe, even my very picky daughter.  They said this was so delicious, even better than any restaurant.  I only made half the amount of chicken, but I felt like it took me forever to fry it.  For the batter, I would suggest adding the cornstarch to the 1 1/2 cups water to avoid clumping.  I'm sure I will be making this again, because my family will definitely request it.

This recipe was really good. I seasoned the chicken with season salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I also added a little season salt to the batter. My husband liked it too. He's not a big time bell pepper person so most of those were left on the plate. But, overall, it was really good.

It was actually pretty good. However, the sauce seems to be missing something. Not sure what. It was sweet and had some tang but something is just missing. We are not bell pepper fans so I left it out but added a small diced onion and stips of carrot directly to the sauce along with the pineapple. Would probably make again.

My family loved this recipe. Being the first time I've made it it seemed to take forever but I've learned a few tricks that will shave some time off next time. Will definately be making this again. The chicken is my super picky son's new favorite! thank you! PS. I did add more veggies and doubled the sauce and added some Tamari soy sauce and ginger. Super super good!!!

The coating for the chicken I make over and over again and use whatever sauce I have around or sometimes no sauce.  Will try the recommendation of cooking as normal and then baking.

I loved the chicken batter in this recipe.  However, I didn't like the sweet and sour sauce so much as it didn't taste like the typical sweet and sour sauce that I'm used to.

This was absolutely wonderful and just as good as the sweet and sour chicken you would order from the restaurant.  I didn't change anything in the recipe with the exception of the food coloring. I only had red so I used it and I actually liked the beautiful color it gave it.  The batter was delicious and I couldn't stop tasting the chicken after completing one batch. This is fabulous and now I can make my own sweet and sour chicken at home.  Great recipe! Thanks!!

Awesome! Skipped the bell pepper. Used kethcup rather than food coloring & mixed pineapple through to warm. Fried chicken in batches in wok and kept warm in 200F oven until serving. With jasmine rice, chicken and sauce on top, rave reviews.

It was good, but something was missing and I am not sure what it was.  I may take the suggestions of others by sautéing the veggies in soy sauce first.  Thanks for the recipe though!

Yum yum yum! Tastes just like the chinese restaurant we usually order from. Probably even better because we made it ourselves! Make sure you use the orange food coloring. We didnt the first time we made it and the sauce came out an unappetizing gray color. Still tasted good though!

This is absolutely amazing! It is time-consuming, but definitely worth the time and effort it takes to make.  I did follow others advice and seasoned the chicken with onion, garlic, salt and pepper.  Also, next time i would like to add some carrots to the peppers and pineapple.  Excellent!

I made the chicken part of the recipe.  It turned out amazing.  I bought the sweet and sour sauce, because when I made it from scratch it turned out clumpy and more sour than sweet.  So the chicken part of it is 5 stars, but the sauce part of it is a 1 star.

Very good recipe. The things that I will tweak next time do not effect the rating. The sauce is good but it was a bit too sweet for us, I will add a touch more vinegar next time. And I need to play with the temperature of the oil or the thickness of the batter. I had a small issue with the batter not adhering to the chicken. But the flavor overall, awesome!!! Just like chinese take out! and no msg!

Very easy to make and it was a big hit at my house!!  However, in order to cut down on calories, I did away with the breading altogether and I cut the chicken up into small pieces and cooked it in a pan with only cooking spray and then added the onions and peppers when the chicken was almost done.  Very good, will be making this a staple in my recipe book!

I made this for a large dinner party. I served with white rice and fried rice. This is a favorite of mine.  MY CHANGES: To make orange food coloring, I add 2 drops yellow and one drop red. Or I add 1 T ketchup. Following users advice, I sprinkle generous amount of onion powder and garlic powder on chicken pieces before adding it to the batter. I add more salt to taste. TIP: add cornstarch to water before adding anything else. The chicken can be left in batter over night and made fresh the next day. It takes awhile for all the chicken to cook, so I put cooked chix in oven on a cookie sheet at 180 degrees to keep warm. Lastly, I cook strips of onion and green peppers for about 5 minutes and then add pineapple chunks and cook 2 minutes more. This is good to put over white rice along with a spoonful of sweet and sour sauce.

I followed this recipe exactly and absolutely loved the chicken batter!!  I didn't think the sauce was very good, so I will look for another to pair with the chicken.

This was FABULOUS. It did take a while, but it was worth it, for sure. Instead of pineapple chunks, I used an 11oz can of mandarin oranges in light syrup, and made the sauce with that instead. Also, I had no vinegar, so I used the juice of one lemon to substitute. I added the zest of an entire orange to the sauce for color, because I had no food coloring, and the flavor from the citrus was wonderful. It was very labor-intensive, all things considered, but after a while I'll probably make it again, because the chicken batter and the sauce are really superb.

Thought this turned out great! Really is comparable to a restaraunt. I seasoned the chicken with black pepper and garlic pepper and added a little garlic pepper to the batter. Does make a lot!

Great batter! It was fantastic and didn't even need sauce. Followed other reviews with adding baking powder and salt to regular flour. Didn't have orange food coloring, so I added green and pink. Still want to play around with the sauce. Great recipe.

This tasted wonderful and was FUN and EASY to make!! I noticed that the chicken took aprox. 5 min in the oil and make sure you drop the chicken in one by one so that they cook evenly. My Family thought this was WONDERFUL! Good with fried or white rice. Thank you for the recipe...we will be making this again and again!!!

Good. I could have handled more sweetness; but the hubby would prefer less. I'm the 'sweet' one. Good though! I added onion and red pepper to give it more color, etc. I added about a TSP of red cayenne pepper to satisfy his 'hot' lips.

My family really liked this recipe.  They rated it 4.5 stars.  My favorite thing about the recipe was the crispy batter after frying.  The sauce was very good also.  We will definately use again.  My family doesn't like chicken breast so we used chicken wings and it turned out well.

FANTABULOUS! I read another review about thinking 'I can't believe I just made this' while eating- lol and I felt the SAME way! This was SOOooooOoo yummy! The sauce was good too and made PLENTY with let overs. I was thankful for the other reviews on substitutions for not having self-rising flour, and they came out great! If I ever decide to fry up some chicken (which is like once a year) I will not even think twice about using any other recipe- this is the BEST!

I thought this was very tasty. The chicken turned out perfect and delicious we ran out of the chicken quickly as the kids kept eating while i was preparing the rest of the dinner. Only needed half of the batter for the chicken and it was plenty. I was a liitle nervous making thwis dish but it wasnt as hard or time consuming as i thought it was going to be. Family loved it and my hubby who eats at chinese restaurants said that is exactly how sweet and sour chicken is supposed to taste.  I surved it over chinese lo mein noodles.  Will make again.

This was the first time I have ever fried something at home, and it turned out awesome. The batter on the chicken really was like something you would get from a restaraunt and the sauce complimented the chicken really well. I took others advice and seasoned the chicken before battering.

This was really good. However, it is time consuming, but worth it. I recommend making the sauce first, and let it sit on the stove. Also, I think the sweet/sour sauce could stand to be a tad stronger in taste. (o: I will make it again. My kids devoured it!

This was awesome!! My husband loved it and said it was the best thing I ever cooked.[that is saying alot, because I am a good cook] It wasent that easy to follow the way it is written, so I took the advise from the other reviews, and when I wrote out the recipe, I changed it up a bit to make it step by step. The only thing i changed in the recipe was to add raw{mild] onions with the green pepper. I also think if you use your time wisely, it wouldnt be as difficult to make......Well worth the time, tasted better than the restaurant chicken because its fresh. Makes too much as written though. BRAVO!!!!

I used shrimp instead of chicken and stir-fried it with the green pepper, instead of frying. Then I tossed the shrimp, green peppers and pineapple in the sauce mixture, before serving. I was pleased to get the color mixture spot on, but will make the sauce a little thicker next time. I served with jasmine rice. I'll definitely try it with chicken sometime, but am not looking forward to the work!

I've always wondered how this was made and this recipe was the exact thing I was looking for. I wouldn't change anything, but if you want to add something, season the chicken.

Unbelieveably yummy!! I followed the recipe, and all the tips, and it came out perfect and delicious! I didn't have food coloring, so my sauce was clear, but it did not change the taste. I also used black pepper instead of white because I couldn't find any...didn't seem to make a difference. The best tip I found was to season the chicken liberally after it was cut up with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. really added to the taste. Thank you for sharing this!

OH MY GOODNESS, my husband and I loved IT! I followed the sauce recipe exactly except for the food coloring but who really needs that?! Plus i sauteed the pineapple with green peppers and onions in light veggy oil and garlic. Then, I plain fried the chicken, seasoned in onion powder and seasoning salt. I will make this over and over.

I thought this was okay, will definitely use less pineapple if we make it again.  We used fresh pineapple and fresh juice, so it was probably my fault.    Thanks for the yummy dinner!

Very easy and quick to make on the sauce. It was delish and gone in a flash. The chicken I replaced with breaded chicken strips and cooked them myself and we just dunk them in the sauce. I also added the 2 heap tbspns ketchup instead of the food coloring and it did the the job.This is a keeper.Will make this recipe again.

this was good i couldn't  believe i made sweet and sour chicken. the only thing i did different was cut back on the vinegar. the second time i made it i used pancake batter because it was less time consuming but a little sweeter. i actually like the batter the way the recipe states. i will make this again. oh yeah i almost threw out my pineapple juice because i didn't read where it said to save it.

Sweet and Sour is not my favorite Chinese dish and I never get it at the resturants. But, I decided to try this for a change of pace and it was really great. (I won't make it too often though, because as stated, sweet and sour is not my fave.) Easy recipe. Tastes good. The hubby and son really liked it. Sauce was good (I replaced the food coloring with ketchup), and the chicken was tasty and crispy. Warning: you will be frying chicken for a LONG time. But, if you love Chinese as much as I do, it's worth it. Thanks for the really great recipe.

This is a recipe I definitely did NOT enjoy making! I hate to sound bitter, but what was everybody reviewing?! I normally use my grandma's recipe, but I couldn't find it, so I was super excited when I found a recipe that had seemed like everybody had liked it.  1. Make sure you save the pineapple juice! I knew to, because I have made sweet and sour before.   2. It was indeed really messy. I am new to battering chicken like that. Normally, just season it, egg it, and flour or bread it, than fry. This was not my cup of tea. I used a wok, and maybe that's why, but it all clumped together the first batch I put in. I learned to add one at a time a couple seconds in between.  3. Sweet and sour sauce wasn't quite thick enough for me. I also, took someone's advice and added soy sauce to the recipe. Not a fan! The sauce was pretty bland too and sweet. Good thing I bought a 20ounce can of pineapple, cause I added the rest of the juice, loads of onion powder and a drop of sesame oil. and it ended up coming out tasting okay. 4. I also took note that the peppers would be raw. So, in a separate skillet I sauted the peppers and pineapple in some EVOO and added about a tablespoon of garlic.   5. I served this with Japanese sticky rice. It was OK. Some people liked it, some didn't. I thought the breading on the chicken tasted like a pancake. If you like that sort of thing, go for it!   And WOW did I have a mess to clean up!

I was not happy with this recipe at all.  The sauce was really lacking any flavor.  Ocassionaly, I would get a really strong "vinegary" taste...and once and a while the sweetness would hit.  However, this is not what I expect from a sweet& sour.  I was expecting much more...sorry.

Loved it! I'm a vegetarian, so I substituted the chicken for tofu. Delicious. My family loved it with the chicken as well.

My daughter spit this out and I had to make something different for her to eat. The only alterations I made was use all purpose flour and I accidentally used fresh pineapple versus canned. I also don't like using food coloring. The green peppers were raw which was by far the worst aspect of this meal.

This was a great and fast recipe.I was able to make it in 30 minutes and everyone loved it.Simple to follow you can't mess this up.I used 2 tablespoons ketchup in place of orange food coloring.I also cooked the pepper in a tablespoon of oil till soft but crisp still and tossed it in with the sauce along with the pineapple.

My first attempt at Sweet and Sour Chicken, and it was a hit!  The frying was time consuming, maybe it would have been faster if I had a deep fryer.  As it was, I used an electric frypan and had to cook the chicken in three batches.  I suggest frying at 400 degrees, to prevent more oil from being absorbed into the chicken.    I did change the sauce a bit, I added approximately 2 T soy sauce, 1/2 c. sugar, 1 cup water, 8 oz. pineapple juice from a can, 1/3 c. vinegar, 3 T cornstarch.  I kept tasting and adding more vinegar and juice till I was happy.  Add more cornstarch (mixed w/ a bit of water first) if you want it thicker, which I did.  It was a great tangy sauce.  No food coloring, the kids were fine with the natural color.  I recommend draining this well, setting in on a thick layer of paper towels in a glass dish while keeping it hot inbetween cooking batches.  I didn't drain mine enough and we could taste the oil.    Still, I'll make this again - great batter, yummy sauce.  My son, my husband and my daughter's boyfriend had seconds.

Great recipe, simple, not-too-fussy.  Even if you don't want to coat the chicken, save yourself some calories (and time) and just make this sauce and pour it over some pan-fried chicken tenders.  However, if you're craving some authentic restaurant-style sweet n' sour chicken, follow recipe as-is, and you won't be disappointed.

This was a great recipe!  I reduced the calories by not breading the chicken. I cooked the chicken in a LITTLE bit of oil with salt and pepper. YUMMY! I will make this again.

The chicken was great and I put less liquids in the sauce and it was very thick, next time I will use the right amount but still only 1/4 c vinegar.

tastes pretty good. Be sure not to forget the food coloring.  I did not add the coloring and it looked quite strage.  I thought the chicken was a little hard to fry but maybe I did not do it right. Will make again but no time soon.

Good, not great. I did not bread the chicken, used 1/4 cup vinegar not 1/2 cup, added garlic powder to the sauce and a dash of red pepper flakes. Sauce could have been thicker, so next time I make it I am going to cut down on the amount of water. I like a thick sauce not runny. I also added onion, with the green pepper chunks and pineapple chunks which was a good choice for more veggies.

We LOVED this recipe & the sauce was not too sour or too sweet, which is something we have had problems with in the past.  I limited the amount of vinegar into the sauce, which seemed to help.  Chicken batter was PERFECT!  Will definitely be making this recipe again!

OK, so this was literally tongue burning sour-ish. So, to save this I had to add some honey to sweeten it as well to thicken it, something the starch couldn't do untill I added twice the amount. Till tasted like  and the only way to save this was to fry some onions/red peppers to 1) color it if you don't have any food coloring and 2) remove that god awful vinegar taste which 1/2 tsp baking soda couldn't remove even a tiny bit off. So in conclusion, I would
1) USE WAY LESS Vinegar
2) Fry red peppers/onions and stir-fry the chicken since not deep-frying = less time to batter up and deep-fry, and it's heathier neways

The sauce for this was delicious.  The only change I made was I added about a tablespoon of honey.

I used grilled chicken instead of deep fried, which was delicious with grilled onions, peppers, and pineapple over rice.

Thanks so much for the recipe!

I agree with other users that it needs 2T soy sauce in the sauce and a little more garlic salt in the batter. Then, this is really fantastic!

I am rating this a three with the caveat that perhaps I made a mistake somewhere along the way.  The only thing I did differently was use egg beaters, instead of real egg in the batter.  So maybe that made a huge difference.  It was all going well until I put it in the wok, and at that stage the batter was a bit of a sloppy sticky goopy mess.  I am going to try it again and add the chicken pieces a few at a time.  Because when you put it all in, it was just a crumbly mess.  The taste was actually okay afterwards, but the look was not good!

This was absolutley the best sweet & sour chicken I have ever made! The sauce was almost exactly like you would get at a chineese resturant I was quite impressed with it! My mom had given me a recipe similar to this but nothing beats this sauce!! I served it over white rice & threw in some pinapple chunks & it was delicious! I will definatley be making this again, it was awesome!

This recipe was great. A little time consuming, since I didn't have a wok to fry the chicken in, I had to cook the chicken in batches. But it came out better then the local Chinese restaurant.
My husband thought the sauce should have been a little more sour...so that's why I gave it 4 stars. I will make it again!

This made better sweet and sour chicken than the restaurants where I live. I took another reviewer's advice and seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt, and pepper before coating in batter, and it made for very flavorful chicken pieces. Used the batter on shrimp, too, and it was great!

I really liked the flavor however when you add the cornstarch i would use a mixer over the stove to prevent clumping. Also i didnt have organge food coloring and I would use it in the future because something about your mind eating clear dripped sauce just didnt do it for me. But I will try again!

I was cooking this dish for my whole shift at the fire department I work at.  It helps to do some prep work the night before (sauce, cutting the chicken, batter, etc.)  But they loved it and wondered where I got it from!

Very messy though.  There was a lot of aftermath in the kitchen.  But I will cook it again.

While the recipe tasted pretty good...we found it pretty time consuming. We made it as is and had a difficult time with the batter. I have made other kinds of Chinese foods and would probably make those over this dish again.

My Husband absolutely loved this dish!  I had to use red food coloring, cause I couldn't find orange so it turned the sauce pink. Next time I will ad more red. It taste just as good if not better than the Chinese restaurant that we order from.  Will definately make this again.

This is one of the very few recipes that I didn't alter in any way.  I did double the recipe to feed a larger group though.  The results were amazing!

Thanks to another reviewer's post, I paired the Sweet & Sour Chicken with the Egg Fried Rice from this site.

What a delicious meal!

This was great!!  I've never attempted homemade sweet and sour chicken and this taste very close to what you'd have at a restaurant.  Although, I did half the recipe because it makes quite a bit.  Keep in mind your frying, so you and your house will smell like cooked oil!!

I only made the sauce (to go with leftover chicken) - it was excellent and easy. I try to avoid lots of sugar and so used 1/2 cup Splenda instead of the sugar, and it turned out great. I also added some pineapple chunks and a little soy sauce to jazz it up some based on other reviewers suggestions.

This is the second time I made this recipe. The first attempt didn't go so well, and I was trying to figure if I did something wrong. Turns out I used regular flour instead of self rising flour (thanks to the person who gave the tip "add baking powder to the flour", it was a big help). It was definetly better the second time around, but not quite like the my favorite restaurant, althought it was really good. After the chicken is fried, the breaded part seems to get a bit deflated or soggy-like, and I hadn't even put on the sauce.

I'm only reviewing the chicken itself, as I made sweet and sour sauce last week and was looking for a way to use up some of it.  This is pretty easy, but time consuming, and not so healthy, so I'll save it for when I am desperately craving sweet and sour chicken.  It does remind me of restaurant sweet and sour chicken, so now I know I don't have to order takeout for sweet and sour chicken anymore!  One reviewer's comment about pancake batter helped me know when to turn the chicken pieces--looks like bubbles in pancake batter does, only I let it go a bit longer (until the sides were brown) bc it's chicken and I wanted to make sure it was cooked adequately.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good. I've made it twice. You can really play around with the recipe. I used tempura instead of making the flour mixture (quicker) and marinated my chicken in Orange and lemon juice and salt and pepper. You can add marichino cherry juice, orange juice, lemon juice, or whatever you can imagine. If you thin out the sauce too much just add more of the cornstarch mixture (equal parts of cornstarch and water).

It did taste good but I would not recommend it unless you had a deep fryer! I just felt so awful afterwards as this is full of sugar, grease etc.

After seeing "labor intensive" a few times, I was skeptical to try this. I made it last night, and it was so easy! So good!!! Just like the restaraunt kind, but better! I usually buy sweet & sour sauce and add pineapple to it. Makes it a little easier for me, and still just as good. I do end up adding a little extra water to get a pancake batter consistancy...but it always turns out amazing!!

This really was delicious! My husband loved it. The chicken turned out exactly like a Chinese place. My only issue was the sauce.  It was really watery, so I'm thinking since I scaled down the recipe that the measurements were off. I would most definitely make this again!

I was going to throw chicken kebabs on the grill tonight but with the rain coming down crazy I changed gears. Searched for a new chicken recipe to try and came across this one! FABULOUS!!!! My husband kept coming through the kitchen to give me a kiss while he reached across me to the already cooked chicken pieces ha ha. My toddler came skipping into the kitchen yelling more please, more please, more please since I gave him two pieces to test out before dinner was done.
We are having this with brown rice and assorted steamed vegetables on the side!
Thanks for an awesome recipe! I will make this again!

This is really good and has the potential to be 5 stars by adding more flavor. It is moving in the right direction but needed a little more 'oomph' so next time I will probably add more pineapple juice and vinegar, and then test taste it before I serve it. I also chose to use red food color instead of orange just for personal preference, and I used a good number of drops of that, by the way, to achieve a nice red sauce instead of a pale colored sauce. Definitely will be making this again. Thanks

This was very good! I am so glad I tried it! It is as good, if not better, than the local Chinese restaurant makes! I will make this again, it is time consuming but the end result is worth it! I did add onions and carrots to the sauce.

I didn't make the sauce on this recipe as I had a jar of mandarin chicken glaze to use up but I wanted to try the breaded chicken you get in Chinese restaurants. It came out awesome! It tasted just like "real" Chinese food : ) My son thought the sauce was too spicy so he ended up eating a few of the plain breaded pieces dunked in ketchup like nuggets. I'd probably use the breading recipe for this again but make sure to season it quite a bit more as it's quite bland tasting without the sauce. All in all - 2 thumbs up!

Delicious! I would give it 6 stars if I could. For those trying to trim it up; I found that baking them worked just fine and tasted delicious but they will look a little funny - like pierogi kind of. Also, I split the flour half white and half wheat and it tasted great. Thanks for this recipe!

The chicken was WONDERFUL!  i was not too crazy about the sauce.  It had a little too much vinegar for me, so next time i will use less.  My husband and kids loved it and gave me a 10! I did have to spoon each piece of chicken one at a time, otherwise it would clump up. Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband loves this recipe and he's a hard critic.  I did end up making two batches of the sweet and sour to go over the chicken since it wasn't enough to have one batch of it.  We love this recipe so much that we're making it again tonight.

Great recipe. The sauce for me did not come out as i thought so i added a little bit of soy sauce and made sure the corn starch was fully cooked cause that make a big difference in the taste if the corn starch is not fully cooked. great recipe none the less

Awesome! Tonight is the second time cooking it this week! The leftovers disappear very fast. I used boneless chicken thighs (Cheaper and we prefer the dark meat) And salted and doused the chicken with MSG before mixing it into the batter. Yum, yum!!

Nobody could get enough of these! My boyfriend even said they're better than any sweet and sour chicken he has had in a chinese restaurant! Plus, I couldn't even get them all fried before my brother came in and started eating them!

Fantastic!  I thought this was wonderful.  Everyone loved it!  I really liked the way the breading on the chicken made it very crunchy.  I will defintely make again!

This recipe was GREAT! For my own personal tastes though, I will make sure my chicken cubes are at the very least 1 inch.  The breading was a little overwhelming.

turned out wonderful! great crunch. and very juicy chicken! the sauce was too vinegar-ie for me. next time i plan on toning it down a bit by cutting it to only 1/4cup. and adding some march. cherry syrup to it.

I have made this recipe 3 or 4 times now, only on special occasions, due to the work, but it is absolutely delicious. To make the sauce though, I like to use crushed pineapple and add everything in the can to the recipe. Absolutely yummy! The whole family loves it.

Great recipe!  For a healthier result, delete the food covering and just saute your meat and veggies and use the sauce as a garnish.  Yum!

Awesome!  I don't know why everyone is complaining about the amount of work.  It wasn't difficult, just fried chicken pieces and sauce.  And super yummy!!  I did do as another reviewer suggested and added some salt and baking powder to my batter because I only had All Purpose flour.  We served it over brown rice and with a side of brocolli.  Thanks for a great "Chinese food" recipe!  Will definitely make again!

WOW! What a great meal!  This was just like the sweet and sour at our local Chinese restaurant.  The batter is perfect.  I had no idea I could make my own sweet and sour sauce...and it tasted good.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I was quite pleased with myself, I mean this recipe after making this. I mixed yellow and orange food coloring so my sauce wasn't exactly red but it was good enough. The chicken was good without the sauce as well.

Batter was a little bland for my taste but overall the recipe was delicious. I added broccoli and a red bell pepper and it really brighteded the dish up. I left out the food coloring because I didn't have any but I recommend not leaving this step out because it just looks funny without it! ;)

This is very close to a recipe an old roomate used to make.Except she used 1 10 ounce jar of maraschino cherries(for color and taste. Also you can use as much cornstarch(mixed with cool water) to thicken it.If not thick enough just add more a little at a time till it's what you want..

This was a really yummy recipe!!  My husband loved it and it was a great for a change of pace.  I would highly recommend eating everything hot together as it's not quite as good as it cools.  We'll make it again! :)

This dish had lots of flavor. I added chunks of onions since our favorite Chinese restaurant serves it that way. Sauce was a little runnier than I hoped and the chicken soaked up all the leftovers. Was a bit high maintenance, but was very delicious and worth the wait.

We made this without  frying the chicken for a lighter meal.  We just seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper first.  We served it with jasmine rice and it was really good.  I will definitely make this again.

LOVED IT!! It was soooo delicious, my husband thought I had ordered it from  somewhere! He was so impresed by the batter and sauce. This is an awesome dish and fun to make. I did add a bit more vinegar and pineapple juice and sugar to make it a bit more zesty. the original was a little too bland. I will make this a staple recipe!

The chicken was fabulous!  We could not seem to get the sweet and sour sauce right, it had too much vinegar the first time.  We made a second batch using only 1/3 of the reccomended vinegar and still didn't care for it.  But the chicken turned out great and we will definately make it again!

The chicken was awesome. I did not like the sauce, though. Will certainly use the chicken batter again.

I first followed the recipe as it was written.  My husband didn't like the green peppers and I thought it was too sweet.  The next time I made it, we traded the green peppers for carrots and I added soy sauce to make it saltier.

This was an easy recipe and pretty tasty but it lacked some zing in the sauce and the chicken batter was soft rather than crispy after frying.

I would give this more starts if I could!!  This was the best I have had!! I have been looking for a replacement for our chinese resturant, and this is just as good, if not better!!  It was very easy to make, but it is time consuming, but both my hubby and i felt it was worth it!!!!!  This will be added to our favorites!!!!

I only used the breading part of this recipe, and it was perfect. Just like the restaurant...didn't try the sauce as I had one that I like already. (Sweet & Sour Sauce I ) Maybe next time I will! But the batter was superb! Thanks!

I did not like how this came out. It lacked in taste. I added some soy sauce at the end to try to help. My husband and son (who is very picky!) did like it, however.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family.  I did make a few alterations.  First, I added carrots and I used red bell peppers instead of the green.  Second, I saute'ed the carrots, peppers and pineapple until the veggies were crisp tender.  The family raved over it.

This was very easy to make, although it was time consuming for me to fry the chicken, since I had to do them in small batches (small pan). The sauce was pretty good, but seemed to be missing something. My family enjoyed it!

I served this meal at a cooking class at our workshop. It was SO good! The batter was fantastic, and 2 lbs chix breast was more than enough. 1 lb would probably be even enough, but at home I'll still use 2 lbs because my husband is such a carnivore. :-) I might add some tomatoes next time, but it was really fantastic with the raw peppers; so much flavor and texture! Will definitely use this again.

This was my first attempt at sweet and sour chicken and I'm so glad I tried it, it was great! Thanks for posting this recipe. I omitted the bell peppers and added the pinapple to the sauce. It was better than a lot of restaurants! Just awesome.
