I checked out Pumpkin Pie Spice II an saw that there were cloves in that one and the color wasn't quite right (didn't taste the cloves that this recipe required as in the store bought Pumpkin Pie Spice I have. I then went to Pumpkin Pie Spice I - perfect match and what my family is accustomed too.  Great Recipe and Thanks!  I buy my spices in bulk to save some $$$ especially in this economy situation where the price of flour has skyrocketed and looking to cut costs wherever possible especially that my hobby is baking.  Love this Website :-)

What a great idea! The only drawback is it lacks cloves, so I added them.

I check on the back of a bottle of allspice at the store and it was made up of all the same spices as this recipe. Since i don't use pumpkin pie spice often, this really saves money.
Thank you for posting the recipe..

I thought this was a great combination- used it in Pumpkin Cranberry bread with great results.  Allspice is slightly similar to ground cloves anyway (a bit more mild- which I like), so I didn't miss the cloves at all. Thanks for saving me a trip to the store!

I used this recipe for pumpkin pie (!) and it was wonderful. (I've never really seen the point of buying something as specific as "pumpkin pie spice" when you probably have all of the ingredients to make it!)

This isn't bad, but I prefer Pumpkin Pie Spice II because it feels like cloves are missing. I'm a little confused by the comment that said she "checked the ingredients of allspice at the store." I suspect that she meant to say "I checked the ingredients of pumpkin pie spice," instead. Allspice is NOT a spice mixture, it is a spice all on its own (it comes from a Jamaican tree).

Excellent! I love these homemade spice mixes. So, so good! I use this one in many, many things. This morning I used it in my homemade Raisin Oatmeal Mix from this site.

I tried but couldn't find pumpkin pie spice at my local supermarket it seems to be hard to find here in England. Was very pleased to find this. Thanks

Thanks so much for posting this recipe!  I wanted to make a few things and didn't really want to buy another spice!  This is perfect, and I love that it doesn't have cloves...they are not a favorite of mine.  I can't wait to use it in other recipes besides the Pumpkin bread!

Very nice blend of spices, perfect for my pumpkin cake.  I particularly liked that it called for allspice as I don't use it often, and that I was able to scale this down to one serving, which was just the right amount for my cake.

To me, this recipe is perfect. I love that it utilizes allspice rather than cloves. Also, all of the other online recipes for this that I found elsewhere only made just a tiny amount, and with the handy scaling feature on Allrecipes, this one can be instantly adjusted to suit the exact amount you are looking to make. I'm glad I found this one. Thank you!

Although I love my pies with the pumpkin pie spice in the small bottle, I refused to pay the outrageous price for another.  When I saw this recipe with the same ingredients that were on back of the bottle, I decided to give it a try today.  Added one tablespoon to the pumpkin mix and it turned out fantastic.  All I can say is yum...  I'm ready for Thanksgiving.

Great Pumpkin Pancakes! This blend is great. I did not add clove because there is clove in the allspice. Sometimes clove will take over a spice blend. I used this for pumpkin pancakes and it was amazing. Just 1 tsp added to the batter. We usually put 1/2 C of applesauce in the batter to lighten them, but I think next time I will try mixing the applesauce with canned pumpkin.

Perfect blend of spices. I can't believe I never reviewed this before. I just ran out and have to make some more. I won't buy the commercial brands when this is so simple to make!

This is a good mixture. I do prefer my pumpkin pie spice to also include a touch of cloves, so I add 1/4 tsp. to this same ratio. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is perfection for most tastes, so I awarded 5 stars. However, the "Libby's" recipe for pumpkin pie has long been my go-to recipe for pumpkin pie. It calls for cloves and does not call for all-spice. I think the all-spice adds a certain mellow kick to this blend, but felt it still needed a bit of cloves, so I added 1/2 tsp. and found it to be perfect for my tastes.

Thank you so much for posting. The pumpkin pie spice in the stores contain 'sulfiting agents' that I am allergic too. This is a way better solution!

WONDERFUL. I was going to buy pumpkin pie spice at the store yesterday. But it cost $5.49 for a tiny 1 oz. jar. I thought that was outrageously expensive. This mix was right on the money -- and used what I already had in the spice rack. Ingredients were the same as listed on the jar at the store. THANKS FOR SHARING!

I have a confession to make. I hate pumpkin pie. However, I love mixing this up and adding a tablespoon to my coffee grounds before brewing. No more paying for overpriced specialty blends. Now that's a cup of Holiday Cheer!

Made a couple recipes today that called for pumpkin pie spice, and I found out that I didn't have enough on hand.  Mixed this up, and it was every bit as good as the expensive store brands.  There's no need to ever again buy the big bucks store brands.  I made a half-batch, using freshly-ground nutmeg, and it filled up my McCormick spice bottle.

I usually find something 'off' about store bought pumpkin pie spices, but this is a base that's easy to make with proportions that are easy to remember. I like cloves AND allspice, so since both are similar, I did **1.5 tsp. of cloves + 1.5 tsp of allspice (1/2 of each) to equal the 3 tsp. of allspice called for. Then I added about *1-2 extra Tbsp. cinnamon to taste. I've put it with delicious results in cinnamon rolls and pumpkin pie at a ratio of about *2 tsp. cinnamon to 1.5 tsp. pie spice, and the spice blend was perfect! No one spice negatively overpowered the others; no, "WOAH, easy on the cloves next time! Can't even taste the ginger!" Obviously, if you don't love cinnamon like I do, you may want to skip my additions. :)

I've just made pumpkin spiced lattes from this recipe... my first time having one and it is delicious!!! I did add some extra cloves as my husband likes a stronger flavour. I do however need to know how much I would use when making a pumpkin pie, all the recipes I've seen have the individual spices listed. Thanks in advance :)

I've been using this recipe for Pumpkin Pie Spice for two years. It's the best one around. Has just the right flavor. No point in buying an expensive store brand, much more economical to make my own.

This was really easy and good to make to have on hand. Now I don't have to buy a whole bottle of pumpkin spice that costs $6+ when I don't often make recipes that calls for pumpkin spice.

Great! Love finding these spice mixes on this site. I never buy them pre-mixed any more and I always buy spices at the health food store--so much cheaper! Also, to reviewer Space814: The "allspice" in your jar is not the correct ingredient. Allspice is not a mixture--it is its own thing, a berry that is dried & ground. If you have a jar that lists several items as ingredients, it is not true allspice.

So simple and easy.  Much less expensive than buying little bottles of the ready made off the store shelf!  I prefer the allspice to clove as it is similar to clove but a milder spice.

I cut this recipe in half and added 3/4 tsp ground cloves.  I don't like the scent of it quite as well as the scent of the other pumpkin pie spice recipe on this site, this one smells more heavily of nutmeg, the other one had a sweeter cinnamony scent.

I had never purchased pumpkin pie was but received some in a gift basket.  Now I'm hooked on using it in coffee.  Mmmmmmmmmmm it is so good.  Since I was close to running out and didn't want to go to the expense of buying it, just for coffee, thought I look for a recipe online.  Not surprised to find it on this site, which is ALWAYS my go to site for things like this and I am NEVER disappointed!!  Thank you all who participate.

Perfect!  I was making a dessert that called for this spice and realized I didn't have any.  Didn't want to run to the store, so I jumped online and found this!  So glad I did, and I made a double batch to keep it on hand!

This is hard to rate, because you can't really comment on the taste of the spice alone.  I love having the recipe, though, so I can make my own pumpkin pie spice when I need it. So far, anything I've made with it has been wonderful.

Many "pumpkin pie spices list 'allspice' as a combination of flavors, when in fact Allspice is a flavor all it's own.

I added more cinnamon. For some reason the ginger overshadowed the other spices. Yuk, so I added more cinnamon and wish I had some cloves because a small dash might have helped as well.  But in a nutshell, this is a great little recipe to have on hand so you don't end up spending a fortune on a pre-packaged "pumpkin pie spice" bottle. Just find the perfect mix for your liking. :-)

Previous reviewers are making me giggle by saying they didn't use this recipe because it did not have cloves or they purposely like this recipe because it does not use cloves.  It uses allspice.  Read the back of an allspice jar - it contains cloves.

This recipe is fantastic and tastes exactly like what you buy as "Pumpkin Pie Spice."  Now, I can make my thrifty take on a pumpkin spice latte without breaking the bank!

I made this because I was out of bought Pumpkin Pie spice and I wanted to make the pumpkin fudge on this site today.  I didn't have the allspice but I had cloves so subbed those instead.  Love it and will never buy the pre-made spice again.  This is much more frugal!

Just like other combinations often called for in recipes like Seasoned salt, Italian seasoning, Fajita seasoning, Herbes de Provence etc., this is a great way to use spices and herbs you likely already have on hand, and save time and money !

Thank you for sharing this recipe, it's perfect. Pumpkin pie spice is SO expensive during the off-season and you get so little. Now I can make a big batch and use it to my hearts content.

Terrific recipe. I actually chose this one because it does not contain cloves (my family and I do not like the taste of them). This is THE BEST! I scaled it to 1 serving and used it to bake pumpkin pie bread and it was fantastic.

I changed the servings to 1 and it was just enough for my recipe.  I like that I can use what I already had instead of buying another spice.

This was so good. I halved the recipe and it was still 2-3 times more than I needed for two pumpkin pies. And I grated fresh nutmeg. Anyway, they were some of the best pumpkin pies I ever made - saving this one!

I made up a quick batch for hubby who was making pumpkin muffins (off this site) and we didn't have any pumpkin spice. He was going to run up to the store and I told him I could whip up a batch using the spices in our cupboard. I QUARTERED the recipe, he used 1t of the spice, and the rest  of it just fit in an empty spice container (the approx. 1oz size plastic one). Now we have it  in our cupboard for making pumpkin pancakes and whatever else we find on allrecipes.com! Thanks for posting the recipe. This is our go-to site for great recipes and inspiration!

Works great! I used it for not only my pumpkin pie and pumpkin cheesecake, but apple pie as well! I like a spicier pie, so I added ground cloves to the apple and it is positively delicious! Will never pay the price for store bought again!

I've made this many times....I've added all the spices as directed, And also added 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, that I make myself.  It's a pretty good recipes for beginners as well as seasoned cooks....easy to follow.  It's become a customer favorite.

I used roasted Saigon cinnamon from McCormick, which is deep and intense. I agree with others who found that the recipe needs ground clove as well. I'll add that the next time. I only made a small batch, for making lattes with, this time around.

I like this recipe, and that it makes a large amount to get me through the holiday season.  I can't give it 5 stars, though, because I add a teaspoon of ground cloves. :-)

We made this to use in our recipes and as an Open House gift for our parents. The smells were just what we were looking for and compliments from Parents rate this recipe well.

This was pretty good, needs cloves, though.  I used it in the Asian Spiced Chicken in Wonton Cups with Vanilla Apricot Sauce recipe on this site.
