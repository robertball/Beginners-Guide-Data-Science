This was easy to put together and tasty! I'm having more of it for lunch tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to it. I used milk instead of heavy whipping cream to save on some calories, but other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.

This is a very tasty recipe! I used regular milk and a can of creamed corn.  We ate this with chili and it added a nice sweetness.

We absolutely love Corn Cake, but I have never tried to make it from scratch.  I tried this recipe.  It was absolutely delicious and authentic.  Extremely moist and easy to make!  I totally forgot to add the heavy whipping cream, but it really didn't seem to matter.  I purposely altered the recipe to use cream corn instead of throwing whole corn into a blender.  Since the cream corn has more moisture in it, I also cut back on the water by 50%.  Just wonderful.  Will definitely reuse this recipe from now on!

I have made this at least ten times!  The first time that I had made it, I thought it was a little toooo sweet.  Therefore I cut the 1/3 cup of Splenda down to 1/4 cup of Organic Cane Sugar.  I also use Polenta instead of cornmeal (basically the same thing, but coarser) and regular 2% milk instead of heavy cream.  It comes out better each time!

One fun addition:  Diced spicy chili peppers!  It adds a little flavor, but not too much.  :D
