I cut and froze my mango and banana the night before specifically for this smoothie. I used homemade frozen vanilla yogurt last night instead of ice cream and Truvia instead of sugar. Honestly, this had too much milk. I think it would have been much better had I cut the milk back by half, at least.

this is really good and refreshing, very fruity...i used a frozen banana and added about 5 ice cubes to make it thicker...anyways it was really sweet (so it doesnt need the extra sugar)and had that tang of mango...perfect for summer...

Hubs loves his breakfast drinks on weekends.  Whether you call them smoothies or milkshakes, whether they have yogurt or they don’t, no matter what fruit is added to them, he loves ‘em.  Me?  I really could take ‘em or leave ‘em, as I’ve never tasted one good enough to warrant all the calories and sugar, even if that sugar is just from the fruit.  Besides, after making them awhile, one began to taste pretty much the same as another anyway.  Not this time.  While I had plenty of berries on hand, both fresh and frozen, I was determined to find something different to try, and this was it.  Frozen mango came in handy, and because of that and the fact there was already quite a lot of milk in the drink, I chose not to add the optional ice cream.  I added the cinnamon but didn’t want to push it and take a chance with the nutmeg, so I left it out.  I handed this creamy, frothy milkshake to Hubs, then tried a little myself and thought, wow, this is awesome good!  Uniquely different and 5-stars for sure!  And even tho’ I didn’t expect Hubs would agree, he did!  So what was so different about this?  It wasn’t thick and gloppy, it was refreshingly light.  It wasn’t overly condensed with flavor, again refreshing.  It didn’t have the sour tang of yogurt. Most of all, it wasn’t your same old tired, berry smoothie.  If I had any criticism at all, it would be that I might have liked a little more mango, but that would just be overly picky.

Extremely good and light. I tried it without ice-cream. My husband on the other hand prefers having it with a couple of spoons of plain yogurt - makes it bit thicker, than the milk-only version, but not as rich as ice-cream version. One of my favorites!

I added a scoop of vanilla protein powder. You can't taste it, and it was a great after workout drink. Not too heavy. I would have liked to taste the mango more, but the mango I used wasn't the best.

This was really tasty. I left out the sugar since I used a bit of vanilla ice cream. Didn't use very much milk, but I like my smoothies/milkshakes really thick. 2 cups of milk would have made it really thin, IMO.

This drink is kind of odd. It is like a mix between a milkshake, a smoothie, and a cold milk drink. I subbed the mango for peaches, just because I prefer it. I am not sure what the cinnamon or nutmeg did? I thought it left a weird after taste. I also couldn't understand how the ice cream, which is the main ingredient in a milk shake, was optional? I added a little more banana to get some more fruit in it and used Truvia for the sugar. The drink was room temperature, so I added 6 ice cubes for half the recipe. I also added a tad of vanilla extract for a little extra flavor. Not a shake I would make again, as it was missing that fruit flavor I get from smoothies, but it was something different to attempt anyway.

Loved this - got to use an over-ripe mango and banana! Might need to strain the mango fibers. I like other's ideas to freeze the fruit first - or add some ice cubes - will try these variations next time!

I tweaked it a bit by using instead... mango nectar,  evaporated milk and no sugar.  It was super delish!
