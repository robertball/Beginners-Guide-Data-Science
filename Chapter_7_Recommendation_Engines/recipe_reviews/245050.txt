This was excellent! I butterflied large turkey breast cutlets and did it that way and these were to die for. Getting the bacon to stay on could be a challenge so I recommend using toothpicks to help you along. I already cannot wait to make this one again!

I made this as published with the exception of Turkey. I used chicken breast and it was fantastic. Not sure if it was the bacon or the feta but it had a very smokey flavor that my wife and I both loved. I paired it with mashed potatoes and glazed carrots and when plated it  made for a very nice looking dish. This is a dish I will make again and plan to make it for our next dinner party.

If you take the turkey out at 162 internal, cover with tin foil, it will rest up to appox. 165 degrees.

Great recipe but the cumin was a little overpowering. Back that off to 1\8 - 1\4 tap and it would be perfect. We used turkey bacon as well to make it healthier but keep that bacon flavor. Overall great recipe, family loves it!

Turned out amazing! I hate to just make a turkey for thanksgiving as there are only 2 of us, this was a great alternative. Turned out great even with out the seasoning because of the yummy bacon. I've already been requested to make it again. Things get a little messy while wrapping the bacon around, but it's totally worth it.

Bacon definitely kept turkey breast moist. For me the filling was too bland. Next time, with the spinach, I am going to use lots of garlic, maybe sauteed crimini mushroom and some kind of cheese with a bit more oomph.

brined the turkey the night before.  Had to really apply a lot of string (and toothpicks) to get it to stay in a roll.  Cooked almost 90 minutes, actually coulda cooked it a little longer.  Delicious, moist, a hit

This was a total hit! I cooked it at 400c - 40min /kg. I roasted it covered with tin foil until last 20 min so the bacon would get nice and crispy. I will definitely make it again.

Awesome recipe. I didn't have spinach or feta, so I wrapped the breast in bacon, the under side had some butter on it but OMG so good, especially cold on a sandwich ??????

Everyone loved it although for the dark meat lovers I added the added the thighs. Instead of stuffing the breast I pounded them anfd the Thighs out and created two rolls. It came out great.
