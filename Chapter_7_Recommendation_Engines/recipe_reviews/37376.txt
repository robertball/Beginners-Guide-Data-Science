The recipe calls for 2 tsps. each of lime juice and lime zest. I believe this is too much. I added the amounts that the recipe called for and the soup was too limey. To counter this I added 2 more acorn squashes and it was still too limey. I think the water bath also watered down the squash taste so i suggest to roast the squash instead of placing it in water.

I used lemon instead of lime and half the amount. I also added a little sliced ginger and cumin at the end. This is definitely one of my favorite soups!

Superb!  I added twice the recipe amount of whipped cream, mostly because I didn't know what else to do with it.  The lime was just the perfect touch.  My wife thought it was too thin.  I'm thinking I could add a bit of instant potato flakes to it to make it thivker without destroying its flavor.  Next time maybe I'll try it.

I used veggie broth instead of chicken and half a lime and it was the best soup I've had in a long, long time.  Great for Thanksgiving!

Wonderful!  Wonderful aroma, wonderful texture, wonderful taste.  This is one of the best soups I have ever had.  Did not have lime rind, so omitted that, but, wonder of wonders, did actually have some lime juice.  For the heck of it, made half a batch of soup with apple cider in place of the wine.  Mmmm, talk about a taste of fall.  Sweeter and heartier flavor than the wine, but the wine has a subtle delicasy; both tasted great.  Used milk instead of cream, with a couple extra tablespoons of butter to give a richer flavor.  Only used 4 cups broth, as we like a very thick soup.  Hubby said this is a "kick***" soup and I gotta agree.

I used instead frozen, already cooked, Bird's Eye Brand Winter Squash, and non-fat creamer instead to save time and fat. You don't have to have the wine. Soup turned out excellent. This is a good basic recipe - I recommend it any time of the year!

Can i tell you how much i love this soup?   It is divine!  It takes a bit of work, but it is all worth it.  You end up with a pot of flavourful, fragrant soup that has the most delightful hint of lime.   Excellent soup!

Delicious!  I use half and half instead of cream to cut down a little on fat and it still tastes great.

YUM! I added a little pumpkin pie spice for flavor and also pureed in some applesauce (or could use cooked apples) to sweeten it up.

This is really good.  I didn't have any dry white wine so just used all chicken broth.  I also replaced the cream with milk to make it healthier.  I added the lime juice, but omitted the lime peel & I still think it turned out great.  I will make it again with wine & the cream for Thanksgiving.

This turned out great, however I have to give it four stars since I made some changes. First, after reading some reviews, I decided to thicken it up by starting with a roux. It is really simple. All you do is melt the butter and slowly stir in the same amount of flower as you have butter (1/2 cup). Then add the rest of the ingredients. It turned out so thick I decided to use milk instead of cream.

I didn't use cream or milk, but I don't think it would have made a difference.  The lime juice and zest really make this soup.  I threw in a baked sweet potato which gave it a slightly sweet flavor.  Sorry to have made these changes, but it is a versatile recipe.

Great comfort food, even if you don't have the white wine. I've been tossing some fresh baby spinach in when I heat it up, just for some added goodness.
