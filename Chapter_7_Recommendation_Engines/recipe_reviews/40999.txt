What is better on a cold, winter day in Wyoming than soup and homemade bread for dinner, and this recipe was outstanding! Did make a few changes: Baked potatoes in microwave, used white onions and cooked bacon along with onion first. Cut up the potatoes and mashed slightly with potato masher before adding. Also used colby cheese. This was a real hit with my husband.

This recipe is very yummy. The only thing my husband and I changed was the amount of bacon and cheese on top.  Other than that we left it the same.  We served our soup with toasted bagel sandwiches and they complimented each other well.  This is definently a make again recipe.

This is EXCELLENT!  I add a few of my own touches from other potato soups I have made in the past, but the base is definitely this soup - it is a real family and crowd pleaser.

This was soooooo Good!  However, we did feel the need to go immediately to sleep upon eating this soup.

This is soooo good! had friends over & served this for dinner with a salad. The chives & bacon on top make this a very nice soup to serve. Will surely make again. CD

This is truly a soup that "eats like a meal". It is very good. I scaled back the recipe to accomodate a smaller audience. I didn't have any green onions or fresh dill on hand, so I used sweet onions, and added some parsley flakes for color. It was simply delicious. The next time I will add more bacon, and more salt to taste, but the recipe as provided is truly wonderful!!

This is the best Baked Potato Soup recipe I have ever had. I used white onions, which I cooked in the bacon grease and I used colby and cheddar cheese instead of american. YUMMY!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  If you are trying to cut back on calories, use skim milk and reduced fat cheese (just let the milk boil a few minutes longer).  I found this recipe was good for hungry college kids as well as adults who have money and are used to meals that do not consist of Ramen!!
