Quick, easy and good.  I melted a Hershey bar in the microwave and drizzled it over the top for a prettier presentation and a little chocolate to go with the peanut butter.  Yum!

I needed to stir sugar mixture into peanuts and rice cereal. It was not going to soak through the mixture. Tastes GREAT and the kids loved it. I will make this again!
