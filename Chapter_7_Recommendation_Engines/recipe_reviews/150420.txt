These cupcakes are good, and I would recommend the recipe -but don't follow the directions as they are. For instance: I dumped everything together for the cream filling against my better judgement, and ended up with a mixture that just wouldn't get smooth. Some of the cream cheese stayed separated in tiny chunks and, in my opinion, ruined the texture of the filling. I made the batter following usual baking procedure - cream the butter, sugar and cream cheese, mix in the egg and extract one at a time, then mix all the dry ingredients separately and add them gradually. I would also change the frosting a little: First, blend the butter and vanilla, then add the raspberries, then gradually blend in the sugar, and finally add only about a tablespoon of milk (it was loose enough with just that, maybe because I used fresh berries instead of jam.) 
In fact, I could do without the cream filling altogether. I think that this would be a great cupcake with fresh berries stirred into the batter instead. 

Overall, try this recipe out if it sounds good, just include more steps in mixing the ingredients.

These are quite possibly the best cupcakes I have ever tasted in my life!! They were pretty easy to make (even for me, and I am not that great of a baker). I was planning to leave out the filling, but I'm glad that I didn't because it gave the cake something special. My only complaint would be that the icing is super sweet. Maybe next time I would just use a whipped cream icing with raspberry jam mixed in or even (gasp!) store-bought vanilla. Still, these cupcakes are so so so good!!!

I subsituted Fat Free Vanilla yogurt for the cream cheese, used splenda instead of granulated sugar, and added the raspberries directly to the mix!  FANTASTIC.  I chose not to make the filling or icing.

I LOVE this recipe. It seemed daunting at first, but it's actually very simple. The frosting is a little too sweet. I think it's the jam. I'll use just thawed frozen raspberries in the frosting next time I make it.

The cupcakes tasted good, but they were sort of concave.  I liked them more then the rest of my family - kids didn't ask for more when they ran out.  May make again for adults as an alternative to sweeter cupcakes.

A light raspberry flavor.  I was hoping for something w/ a bit stronger fruit flavor.  

Otherwise, a good cupcake recipe!

Made this using sugar-free jam; it's never as sweet as the 'real thing'.  Next time I make these, I think I will do strawberry instead of raspberry. Yummm.
