We loved this recipe and found it to be so easy!  I would suggest adding more pumpkin (we love pumpkin!) and maybe a bit of pumpkin spice or ginger to bring out the flavor.  Since I added more pumpkin, I increased the amount of the reserve water so the sauce would not be too thick.   Perfect for a dinner party, b/c you won't spend all night in the kitchen!

5 stars from me, I loved it, but husband didn't like it!  I was shocked he didn't, but he said he didn't like the sage and creamy texture mixed.  This is a great recipe if you like a different taste to your dinner.

This was O.K. but I won't make it again. Added more pumpkin but it just didn't do it for me. The color was pretty however.

This is a unique and easy dish to make for a dinner party, just substitute the fresh pumpkin for canned.  I added toasted pine nuts for texture and served with salad and bread.

This recipe is great, but I didn't ever try it with the bottled sauce - only with made from scratch alfredo.

Very good and easy recipe to make.  Almost wished though that it had a stronger pumpkin taste to it.
