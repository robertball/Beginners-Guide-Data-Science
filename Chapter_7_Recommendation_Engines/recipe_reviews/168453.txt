Had some A-1 to use up so I figured I would give this a try - - totally worth it.  The beef was delicious and it did caramelize perfectly.  When I reheated the leftovers the next day at work, the boys came running to the break room to see what smelled so great.  Will make this again!  Thanks.

Let me start by saying that I hate steak sauce! My apologies to all of you steak sauces. However, A1 makes a fabulous grilling sauce when mixed with your favorite BBQ sauce. Which isn't Kraft for us (sorry Kraft). I used Cattleman's with a touch of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce. Between the steak sauce and the mix of BBQ sauces, this had the perfect balance of sweet, smoky, and tangy. Grilling made the ingredients play nicely together and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. I believe I'll slice my meat a tad thicker since it cooked through and we like some pink left. Not bad A1, not bad at all. :o)

I made these for my husband tonight and he loved them.  I don't eat beef, but the sauce smelt so good.  I plan on using it on chicken the next time I make them.
