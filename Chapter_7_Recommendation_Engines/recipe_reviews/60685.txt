Very much liked this recipe.  Good way to use up leftover ham.  Light and fluffy.

I skipped the mushroom sauce because I knew the kids would turn up their noses.  They loved it and never knew it once had mushrooms!  It was quick and easy to put together and made great use of the leftover Christmas ham.  My husband even had three servings he enjoyed it so much!

This is just so-so. Definitely different way to serve eggs and ham. I would watch the baking time--mine came out a little dry. This recipe calls for "mushroom sauce"--I assume it means a white sauce, not mushroom gravy. Betty Crocker has a great mushroom sauce recipe.

Very good. The kids weren't real thrilled about it, but my hubby and I loved it. Would make an excellent brunch dish.

Like a souffle, it rises beautifully and deflates quickly.  Not to worry, the texture is souffle-like, and the flavor is fantastic. Used a combination of white and yellow cheddar and red & yellow bell peppers.   The crushed buttery crackers really bring richness.  Didn't like the idea of a mushroom sauce, so I skipped it, with no sacrifice to flavor IMO.  If I were to add a sauce, I think a hollandaise would be tasty on this.  Enjoyed today for lunch with a small side salad and some fruit.  Definitely would make this again!

Awesome recipe!  Used a little more cheese but otherwise followed exactly.   Super easy once you get whipping the whites done.
