This was good although so good I nearly no longer had a laptop as I kept picking up bigger and bigger mouthfuls and nearly dropping them on the laptop! I most deffinately will be adding this to my comfort food list! It was also so quick and easy to make which is also what I loved about it!

I used leftover homemade sloppy joe.  We ended up adding a can of rotel and some hot sauce.  Was pretty good before but we liked it better with the additions.

I thought this was really good, however I used the Sloppy Joe II recipe from this site in lieu of the canned stuff.  I also added shredded sharp cheddar, cherry tomatoes, chopped red onion and sliced jalapenos.  With these changes this was a nice change of pace from the usual sloppy joe and/or the usual nachos.  Thanks for sharing, Jessica53214!

With only a small amount of time to get dinner on the table this was much better than regular sloppy joes. It was quick, easy and filling!

These were soooo awesomely delicious! I made my own cheese sauce and just for some extra color and goodness, I added a little shredded cheddar, and chopped red onion and tomatoes. The family RAVED over these, and asked for me to make them again, soon. This recipe is fun, yummy and a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were fast and easy, but I think a can of chili would go better.
