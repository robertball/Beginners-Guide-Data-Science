I wish we could give half stars, because I'd give it a 3 1/2...this mixture was tasty as written, but the proportions were a bit off for me to form a "dough", and I didn't care for the corn flakes to roll them in. I did some just as written to be able to give an appropriate review, then I added a bit more cereal to the dough and a touch more honey to get it easier to form into balls. Then, I made them a bit smaller than called for and I rolled them in cocoa since they were so sweet. I like that it only uses honey and peanut butter for the sweetness, both of which I love and always have really good of both on hand, I will make these again.

These were great, I think the texture would have been better if the 1/2 cup of cornflakes and 1/2 cup of coconut that get mixed in with the other ingredients were finely ground.

Made these as a somewhat healthy treat for my daughters class.  She helped me prepare and roll everything!  They were very delicious.  I did however do things a lil' bit different.  I did not add the coconut flakes (don't like), but I did add a lil' bit of powder sugar to get them to stick a lil' better.  I wish I would have had some vanilla to add, unfortunately I didn't have any on hand.  Will definately make these again.  FYI, have milk on hand!!!

very simple to make and taste very good.  I made mine into marble size bites and doubled the honey amount to tone down the peanut butter taste a bit.. will for sure be making these again!

This was a very good snack made exactly as written.  If one has preferences for more or less anything, than can easily be adjusted.  I agree it is unfair to mark down a recipe just to suit your taste preferences.  The proportions are just fine as written.  The batch is small, the balls roll up easily.  It is easy to make with/without children and has some "healthy" qualities to it.  It is a sticky dough and clean up is sticky. Thanks for a great, easy recipe to please young ones!

These are super easy to make and the whole family loves them. I didn't have corn flakes on hand, so I used Rice Krispies...which worked out great. Thanks for sharing this easy, delicious recipes.

These are good!  Better than what I thought they'd be with the peanut butter/coconut mixture.  Since they made a small batch and it was something I wouldn't feel guilty giving to my 2 year old I thought I'd try them.  I'm glad I did!

This were pretty good!  I liked to refrigerate them before eating!  Made it a little easier to eat.  Next time i might try adding some cocoa.

This is a good recipe as is. Except we don't care for coconut so I substituted quick oats for that and bumped up the honey just to make sure it stuck together. Kids aren't home from school yet but I know they will be gone in nothing flat. Yum!!!

Wow, this was really good!  Unfortunately, I didn't have coconut on hand so I added extra honey and cereal.  I put everything in the food processor and processed while adding the extra cereal until it felt like it wasn't too sticky.  Rolled some in cocoa and others in honey graham.  Can't wait to try it with the coconut!  

Thanks for sharing this :)

Even works with healthy (not tasty) cereal.  I put all the cereal in the peanut butter mixture, added an extra tablespoon honey, and rolled the balls in finely chopped walnuts for a little extra omega 3.  It was really good!

This wasn't bad..but wasn't all that great either. I'm not quite sure how to explain what I liked or didn't like.

Pretty good... like the coconut taste. Will add bit more honey next time I make it, but very fast and easy.

I made these little balls this afternoon and we thought they were SO good! I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only change being that I added about 2 Tbsp of unsweetened almond milk to the final result - without it, the cookies were very crumbly. Great little snack, but don't be fooled, they're not super healthy!

I came upon this recipe when I was looking for something I made when I was a kid. This looks the closest. However, instead of crushed cornflakes, the first ingredient was powdered milk. We rolled them in the coconut. I no longer have the recipe, but I'll start experimenting. I thought I'd give someone a head start if they want to try. The powdered milk cuts the sweetness and boosts the nutrition. The PB/coconut combo is unexpected, yet delicious! You could substitute almond butter and add some cocoa powder, maybe they would have and "Almond Joy" like taste?

This recipe was a mess (obviously)! I was making it for friends and one doesn't like coconut, so I attempted to make half of the batch without for her, and it did not turn out. Even with the coconut, there was still an overpowering peanut butter taste. I tried doubling the honey but it didn't help much. I also had to double the cereal to form workable dough balls. Finally, I tried one reviewer's suggestion of coating the balls in cocoa (just a little will go a long way) and it helped somewhat. Due to the mess and the disappointing taste, I will not be making these again even though I feel the recipe has potential. 

I ate as I went trying it and in the end, the best ones were with coconut coated lightly in cocoa (with double honey and cereal).
