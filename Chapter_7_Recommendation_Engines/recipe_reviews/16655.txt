Fantastic!  Everybody loves these.  Like other reviewers, I think it calls for a bit more chili sauce.  I used a 4 lb. bag of frozen meatballs, a 32 oz. jar of grape jam, a 12 oz. jar of chili sauce and 2 Tbsp. mustard.  It helps a great deal to warm the sauce mixture in a saucepan and whisk it up so the jelly breaks down and it's nicely combined before pouring over the meatballs.  I started this with frozen meatballs with the crockpot on low and they were perfect in 4 hours.  Kept them on low throughout the party. UPDATE: Made again with a big package (Costco) of Aidells Chicken and Pineapple Terriyaki meatballs and it was better.

Really good!  i put a costco pack of frozen meatballs (3/4 of the italian meatball pack.. .it was all that would fit in the crock pot!), two heinz bottles of chili sauce, 40 oz of smuckers grape jelly (2 squeeze tubes), a pinch of kosher salt, 1 tablespoon of worchishire sauce and 2 TBSP of regular mustard.  Really easy, the meatballs were gone in 30 minutes.

Made these as an appetizer for a large gathering.  15 pounds (3 bags) of armour carmelized pre-made meatballs, 3 jars of chile sauce 1 jar of grape jelly, I used powdered mustard and 3 tablespoons of chili powder. Put the sauce over the meatballs in a crock pot, they were gone in 1/2 hour.  Everyone was coming in the kitchen looking for more and then asking for the recipe.  I felt foolish because it's so simple!  This is a TNT (tried and true) keeper!

I was pretty skeptical about this recipe, I mean grape jelly and chili sauce?  It sounds like an unlikely combo.  But I was having 60 people for my son's first birthday and needed something easy that I could make in advance so I tried it.  I used frozen cocktail meatballs (3 lb bag).  They were gone after about 10 minutes, and everyone was asking for more (in spite of there being plenty of everything else on the table)  They were FANTASTIC.  I wish I'd made twice as many.  The only changes I made were to use a whole jar of each grape jelly and chili sauce, a tablespoon or so of dijon and about the same of worcester sauce.  I dumped everything in the crockpot and left in on low for about 4 hours.   AMAZING.  Easy and a huge crowd pleaser!  I will make again for New Year's!
Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these meatballs for a Super Bowl Party and they came out great. Everyone wanted the recipe. I made my own italian meatballs and used one jar of Heinz chili sauce and one jar of Smuckers grape jelly with 2 tab. of Nance's Sharp and Creamy mustard. I cooked the sauce ingredients on the stove top until well blended and bubbly and then put the meatballs after they were cooked in the oven into my crockpot and poured the sauce on top and let them cook on low for 3 hrs. Perfect. They were tasty and moist. You just have to remember to give them a stir into the sauce every once in a while if they're not already gone by then.

Delicious! I used frozen meatballs and turned out great. I also used the entire jar of jelly (18oz) and the whole bottle of chili sauce. Put in the crockpot on low for about 90 minutes. They went fast!

These are soooooo good! My husband and daughter loved them as much as I did and it's not easy to find something all of us like!

We had a package of frozen meatballs in the freezer that we didn't like (a different brand than we normally buy) and I decided I would use them up at an upcoming potluck so I came here to look for ideas. When I came across this recipe I read it aloud to my husband and he kept saying "grape jelly?" We were very curious so he asked me to make them a head of time. He couldn't believe I used the same meatballs that he didn't like previously when I used them with speghetti.

Anyway - other than using frozen meatballs I followed the recipe exact and I highly recommend.

Thank you!

I first tried these at a co-worker's Christmas party about 10 years ago. I cringed when she said the sauce was just grape jelly and chili sauce! Huh? How can these two ingredients taste so good together? I've been making them ever since, but like most reviewers, I also use frozen meatballs in the crockpot and always heat the jelly and chili sauce first in a small saucepan to avoid jelly globs. I add a few splashes of worchestershire, 3/4 tsp ground mustard, garlic/onion powders to taste, and even a little minced garlic. After thoroughly heated, I pour the sauce over the meatballs, stir well to evenly coat, and keep the crockpot on low for a few hours. I made these today as part of our annual New Year's Day appetizer spread, and my husband, picky 3 1/2 year-old daughter, and I were gobbling these up like there was no tomorrow! Fantastically easy, delicious and always a crowd-pleaser, I will be making these for years to come. This sauce also pairs well with 'Lil Smokies too!

Another old family favorite!  Definitely try these meatballs!  I personally use the pre-made meatballs (frozen) to save time.  Everyone always loves them!!

Great recipe, although I added a little more jelly for a better taste, and used frozen meatballs. I just dumped it all in the crockpot and let it cook for 2 hours. YUMMY!

This recipe is AWESOME!!  I have been making this for years with just the grape jelly/chili sauce combo but had some at a party that were better than mine so came on here looking to see what that extra ingredient was and it must be the mustard!  I used 3 bottles of chili sauce and one of the big plastic jars of jelly (which is almost equal amts of each and a little more than this recipe calls for), 2 tbs yellow mustard and also added about 1 tbs. of dried minced onion.  Used approx. 1/2 bag of frozen italian meatballs from Sam's (it's a BIG bag).  Heated sauce on stove then poured over somewhat thawed meatballs in the crockpot & cooked on low for 4-5 hrs.  UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME and better than my old recipe - will definately make again!!

Great starter recipe. Like others I tweaked it a bit to suit our tastes. Used a 12 oz. jar of grape jelly and 12 oz. bottle of chili sauce, a few squirts of dijon mustard and a few dashes hot sauce. Mixed all together on top of stove unil well blended. Used a bag of frozen Italian meatballs (about 15) and 2/3 package of Lil Turkey Smokies. Heated meatballs in over, then added all to sauce. Did it on top of stove cause my crockpot was in use. Came out great!  Hubby keep going back for more. Will definetly make again. Thanks jhibbard!

I used Aidell's chicken teryaki and pineapple meatballs.  The sauce was delish.  I cooked the sauce on the stove top and then put the meatballs and sauce into the slow cooker.  It was really good.

Always a hit!  The only thing I did different was warm the jelly and chili sauce on low in a sauce pan before adding to crockpot.  It broke down the jelly and really melded the flavors!

I tripled the recipe and took this to a big potluck at work.  I LOVED the convenience of baking the meatballs in the oven.  Talk about super EASY! I put the meatballs up on a wire rack in a big lined roasting pan, and a great deal of the fat had dripped off (healthier).  However, when I made the sauce it had a bit too much mustard bite. So... I added about 2 T. brown sugar and that mellowed it out.   Also... the meatballs would have been bland for my taste, so I add a few things to the raw meat prior to shaping the meat balls (salt, garlic powder and some pepper). It turned out wonderful! There was a LOT of food around and there was not ONE meatball left to take home...lol  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I had to alter the recipe a little ...but I feel it was 5 star once I added a couple extra things.   I'd say it was a HUGE HIT!

There is one major problem with this recipe. Its doesn't tell you what kind of chili sauce to use. I think you are suppose to use a tomato based chili sauce. The first time I made it, it was really sweet and I couldn't taste the chili sauce at all. The second time I made it I added more chili sauce and it was sooo hot. That was probably because I used "pure" chili sauce with no tomato base since the recipe didn't specify. You should use a tomato based chili sauce and add about 1 tbsp per pound of meat more than what the recipe calls for and it will be perfect. The best thing about this recipe is the mustard, it really adds something and is even better if you use an equal amount of worchestershire sauce.

This is just the tastiest appetizer meatball recipe out there.  My teen son has friends that request these!  I use premade "homestyle" meatballs dumped into a crockpot with the remaining ingredients, and I'm done in literally 4-5 minutes.  Not bad for something so good!

Didn't have any grape jelly, so used strawberry preserves instead.  Didn't have any store-bought chili sauce so I made my own from scratch.  Used brown mustard. Added a tiny bit of hot sauce to give it a little kick.  This sauce was amazing.  I think anything would taste great smothered in this sauce.  I will definitely try this again, although with actual grape jelly this time.

Wonderful! Everybody loves these. I used a 4 lb. bag of frozen meatballs, a 32 oz. jar of grape jam, a 12 oz. jar of chili sauce and 2 Tbsp. mustsard and 2 tsp. of liquid smoke. I just heated them on low until they were nice and hot! They will be great in a crockpot too!!

I have been making these meatballs for many, many years. I believe I got the recipe from one of Betty Crocker's first cookbooks. I have made the meatballs from scratch and in a pinch have also used  the frozen packaged kind. I do use a whole bottle of chili sauce and grape jelly and have not used the prepared mustard. YUM!

I made these for a New Years Eve Party and they were devoured.  I used frozen meatballs to make things quicker.  Then simmered the sauce on the stovetop and dumped everything into a crockpot.

I make a similar sauce but I do not add the mustard, just chili sauce and grape jelly( the name brand jelly woks best) I make my own meatballs, when cooked,  simmer in the oven with the sauce for 1hr just so the sauce gets in the meatball...excellent!!!

Though I've had these many times, this was the first time I made them myself. I doubled the recipe and took them to a football party and they disappeared! Amazingly delicious, and so easy to make! I used frozen meatballs and extra jelly and chili sauce, so there was enough sauce to sop up with bread after the meatballs were gone! Awesome!

This is an excellent recipe!  I used frozen meatballs in a crock pot. Make sure you mix the ingredients in a bowl and then pour over the meatballs.  This version is much nicer compared to the cranberry jelly version I used to make.  Great in little mini-roll sandwiches the next day with extra sauce and provelone cheese melted on top.  Yummo!

Hmmmmm, I'm not sure what I did wrong.  It may be the frozen meatball brand I used, but it seemed I couldn't really "taste" the sauce.  I'm a little disappointed especially with all the rave reviews, but I will give it another try and hopefully give it five stars next time around!  Can anyone out there recommend brands of chili sauce, brand of meatballs, etc...  I really want to try this again.

I really liked the sauce on these. But, I have to admit that I did use frozen meatballs, so I am rating it based on that, because I did not have a lot of time. I served them as an appetizer, on a plate with tooth pics in them, at a holiday party. I also had a basket of bread rolls right near, which a lot of people ate them with. Thanks!

Made them in the crockpot for New Years' Eve and they were wonderful - even better the next day! The frozen pre-made meatballs work just as well going to the trouble of making your own, and sometimes even less expensive if you catch a sale! Even with the frozen you still use the same jelly/chili sauce/mustard quantities. Like another reviewer recommended I warmed the sauces in a pan on the stove to get the lumps out of the jelly and make it smooth, then poured it over the meatballs. Great recipe!

These are ok for something quick but they seemed like they needed just a little bit of something extra - onions perhaps?  Good in a pinch (kind of recipe to always have on hand).  My 11 year old granddaughter loved them.

WONDERFUL!!!. Unfortunantly There were not any mild chili sauce at my grocer, and I was stuck with buying HOT, the chinese or Japanese kind and when they say HOT they mean HOT.  They were still very good, just made you want to drag your lips on the ground like a dog..LOL.  Just be careful if you have to buy the HOT sauce because it is nothing like the others, but the meatballs were still wonderful.

I was afraid of it being too sweet. I felt I had to tweak it to make it taste good.  My final recipe turned out to be
1-jar chili sauce
2 oz low sugar grape jelly
1 small can tomato paste
1-teasp. onion powder
2 tbsp dijon mustard
Used thawed premade frozen meatballs in crockpot on low for 3 hours.
Everyone at the party said they were really good, none were left.

Delicious recipe! In the interest of time, I bought pre-made Italian meatballs from the frozen food section and they turned out wonderful! My guests raved and there was not one meatball leftover! Thanks for the terrific recipe!!

I've made these several times, and they're always gone. I use the Armour frozen Italian meatballs, Heinz chili sauce, and Smucker's grape jelly. I love that it's easy to multiply the recipe for whatever size group you're feeding. I've tried a few different additions like garlic, worcestershire and such...and I find I like them best just as written. I warm the sauce ingredients on the stove, then dump it over the meatballs in the crock-pot. It takes about 90 minutes or so for them to be ready to eat. Terrific!

Great recipe, even for a vegetarian!  I just use the frozen veggie meatballs.  And most meat eaters cannot tell the difference.  And like most reviewers, I put all into the crockpot at once.  It only takes about 2 house on low for it to cook all the way through.

Not good.  I should have made real meatballs with spices and breadcrumbs and then tried the cocktail sauce.  To use plain balls of ground beef...well, I should have known better!   I tried one at the party I brought them to, told everyone else that they weren't good, many tried them anyway and no one had a 2nd meatball.

I made these for a New Year's Eve party with homemade meatballs (the classic stove-top stuffing recipe, which is a fabulous meatball recipe).  I made a quadruple batch of meatballs several weeks ahead, froze them and then on the day of the party just put everything in my crock pot about 3 hours before my quests were due to arrive.  This is so easy.   Lovely!

Grape jelly??  You won't believe it but it's true!  Use a spicy brown mustard and equal parts worchestershire sauce and you'll be amazed at how good this recipe really is! Made mine with the Cosco frozen meatballs.  Prepared the sauce in a saucepan, put the meatballs in a crockpot, poured the sauce over it and let it go for 4 hrs.  SUPER EASY-SUPER FUN and quite TASTY!!

I use Mamma Lucia frozen meatballs (not the italian kind in the black bag but the ones in the brown bag), one whole bottle of chili sauce and about 12 ounces of grape jelly. I also add already minced garlic that you can find in the grocery store. I don't use the prepared mustard. Slow cooking these is the key. Otherwise, the flavor of the sauce won't infuse in the meatballs. Put in a slow cooker for about 3-4 hours and that's it. I made these for about 50 people at my mom's wedding reception a month ago and they were a huge hit!

very yummy and easy.  I used frozen meatballs, sugar-free grape jelly (splenda), 1/2 a chopped and sauted onion, and chipotle hot sauce to taste.  I like 'em sweet and spicy!

These are great! I made a batch once, then my sister and I went out, while we were gone my brother in law ate the whole batch! A lady at my church makes jalapeno jelly and it is REALLY good substituted for grape.

My kids loved them and I will make them again. I used them for a large party and they went over very well with the crowd too. Extremely easy, great addition to a buffet. Thanks for the recipe.

I too was skeptical about using grape jelly but it turned out great! I added a bit more chili sauce since for it to be a little less sweet. I also used the meatball recipe from Italian spaghetti and meatballs on allrecipes. I also did make the meatballs a bit smaller. 

Thanks for an easy, delicious recipes. I finally have something to bring to gatherings thats not cheese and crackers.

This was very good...because after reading the reviews I tweaked this recipe. I added 1 large clove of garlic(minced), 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the groung beef. It was still a little bland so I sprinkled salt + pepper into the sauce. I also used equal parts chili sauce and jelly. I will make this again and tweak the meatballs a little more. Overall a good recipe!

This was really good, but i did have to add more chili sauce about equal to the grape jelly.  It was really sweet thats why i did that. But after simmering with the meatballs WONDERFUL!!!I really enjoyed this, and i forgot to add the mustard, but it was soo good without it!

An old standard recipe I've been making these for at least 10 years.  All you need is the grape jelly and chili sauce.  The cranberry jelly sounds interesting. I'll probably try it the next time.

These are good, but I'll stick to my favorite version of this recipe...omit the prepared mustard and add 1 can jellied cranberry sauce to 1 bottle chili sauce and 6 oz. grape jelly. It gives it a sweet and sassy flavor.

I made these exactly as stated in the recipe.  The sauce was tasty, but didn't seem to stick to the meatballs very well.  I was suspicious of making meatballs out of plain meat, and sure enough, the meatballs need some added texture and seasonings.  Salt helped a lot.  I will try these again and make some changes.

these are SOOO easy to make!  and they taste great too.  just pour everything in the crockpot (my meatballs were still frozen) and set it on low for about 4 hours.  I also like more sauce so i add extra chili sauce and jelly.

The best way to make this recipe is to use one bag of frozen meatballs, 1 whole jar of grape jelly & 1 whole bottle of chili sauce, forget the mustard!!! Put them in a slow cooker for a couple hours & you've got a meatball recipe that's easier to make than it is to count the 5 stars it deserves!

This recipe's a total pleaser -- but, I use ground cinnamon in place of the mustard and even quantities of the chili sauce and grape jelly.  It's extremely fast if you buy frozen meatballs and toss everything in a slow-cooker for several hours.  These freeze fabulously, too -- perfect for your Foodsaver bags.  Everyone will ask for the recipe, guaranteed!

Quick and easy for an appetizer buffet. Homemade meatballs are a must to enhance the flavors in the sauce. I use sugar free jelly to cut the sweetness.
Thanks for sharing.

Usually I just use the bag of pre made and cooked meatballs and a couple jars of Chili Sauce.  Thought I would try something a bit different for a New Years Eve party.  The jelly...did NOT do it for me, one of the guests actually spit it up!!  Im still so embarassed...some people liked it but it wasnt a big hit.

This is so easy.  I made it as directed, but it seemed a little bland and the sauce was runny, so I went back and added the rest of the bottle of chili sauce.  That was much better.  Frozen meatballs are the way to go, but I wish I had gotten the Italian ones instead of regular.  I'll try them next time!

This turned out pretty good, I didn't add the mustard until last hour of cooking.  I used premade meatballs and browned them in the skillet first then put in Slow Cooker for about 5 1/2 hrs.

I was supposed to bring an appetizer to Christmas dinner and I totally forgot.  3 hours before I am supposed to be there, the stores are all closed and I am scrambling to figure out what to do.  I found this recipe and it saved me.  At first I didn't have grape jelly so I used strawberry instead.  They turned out ok.  I didn't have leftovers but the meat balls were tough and they seemed bland to me.  I knew they could be better.  I tried it again for the next party on Friday night only this time I used Grape Jelly, a combination of Oriental red chile oil and Marca El Pato sauce and I made the meat balls with some cracker crumbs, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Wow! What a difference!  The slight modifications really went over well. It gave them a real punch of flavor that was missing the night before.  Thanks for a simple and very good recipe.

This was an interesting recipe for sure! I agree, don't let the ingredients turn you away from this. It was sweet and flavorful altogether. You might want to cook the meatballs less though, since they dry out in the oven before you let them simmer in the sauce. Serve hot for sure!

I have used this recipe for years and it is requested each time.  I bake them about a hour and stir them at least twice so all of the meatballs are coated.  The longer you bake them the more flavor!!  This is almost too easy to be this good!

Good flavor but the meatballs turned out dry.  Next time I am going to add bread crumbs and see if this helps.

Yummy, simple appetizer that everyone enjoys!  I used store-bought frozen meatballs, and a whole jar of chili sauce and a jar of reduced-sugar grape jelly.  Next time I will use a half or 3/4ths jar of jelly I think.  They were a little sweet to me.  Otherwise super easy and good!  Threw the heated sauce in the crockpot over the meatballs during a Christmas get-together.

I made these in the crockpot with frozen meatballs. They were great. These will be a sure thing for any parties that I host, especially where drinking is involved since it seems to really help soak up the excess.

I love this recipe.  I added a can of drained water chestnuts and can of chunk pineapple.  I added a little ketchup and a touch of garlic powder.  We had to use a slotted spoon for serving but even the kids enjoyed them!!  Some of the kids used finger rolls to make a sandwich out of them.

I usually make these meatballs with the cranberry sauce.  This time I decided to try them with the grape jelly.  The sauce is SOOOOOOOO much better with the jelly!!  I added a spoonful of spicy brown mustard and a spoonful of Worcestershire sauce as well.  SO DELICIOUS!!!

Used this recipe as a base for my own simpler and easier way.  I used store bought pre cooked frozen meatballs, placed them in the crockpot and used 1 entire squeezable grape jelly and 1 jar chili sauce then placed on high for 1 hour which was perfect.  This recipe although modified was still really good and probably much easier than what was listed.

Great recipe if you like ground beef covered in grape sauce. I made my own meatballs but added onion powder and worcestershire sauce. I also subsituted dijon mustard for prepared, as I was all out. I could hardly force this meal down.

Very good sauce.  I made the meatballs using BBQ Cola Meatballs recipe from this site but used a mixture of ground venison and italian sausage for the meat.  I had to remove the meatballs and cook down the sauce a bit to thicken it.

I highly recommend this recipe. We made this sauce ahead of time and poured it over cooked frozen meatballs in chafing dishes for my wedding reception, and people just raved over them. The sauce is rich, tangy, and simple -- what more could you want?

OMG!

I just made these meatballs with a few modifications, (used frozen turkey meatballs, sugar free jelly, and added 2 tbsp mustard) and I can't keep myself away from the pan!  I will definitely serve these at the next party, yet add a bit of tabasco for some kick.

I took advice from others advice and used frozen italian meatballs.  I also used the whole bottle of chili sauce.  These were great, took them to a potluck and they were the first thing finished.  Thank you for this easy recipe.

Everyone always likes these. Not my fav, but OK, When pinched for time I use the frozen meatballs, but in interest of health I usually make my own metballs, using 97% lean ground beef and 1-lb of ground lean turkey. I use the whole bottle of chili sauce. I dont use the mustard and add 3 tbsp's brown sugar & use sugar free grape jelly. It costs a little more this way, but if you are more health conscious, like I am, then it is worth it! I put the sauce ingredients in a blender then pour over meatballs and cook in the crock pot on high for 4 hours! (Stirring occassionally)

My mom has been making this for years for all her cocktail parties. I used a little more mustard (about 1/2 cup), I also put this in the crockpot with frozen meatballs, it was great. My mom uses little hot dogs too.

I served these meatballs at my son’s graduation party (330 guests).  I scaled the recipe and mixed cocktail smoky sausage with the meatballs in the same roaster.  They were gone long before anything else.  Very easy, I plan to make them again for all major parties.

Just a note to  some who might not understand that  the ingredient "chili sauce" is the one (like Heinz) in a jar.  It's super good and super easy.

I always read reviews before trying a new recipe, as there's always helpful tips. I buy HOT chili sauce, and following suggestions, I doubled it and guess what? It was too hot for my taste and I had used all of my grape jelly! What to do?
  I rummaged in the fridge and found apple jelly which I added in increments, along with probably a tablespoon additional mustard. I shared this because if you're a new cook, it's not a disaster if something like this occurs. Simply add additional of the other ingredients until it suits your taste. Cooking is very forgiving with the exception of salt. Too much salt is a little harder to fix, although the same principle applies. Always be careful with salt, but have fun in your kitchen!  ??

Made this recipe yesterday for a post wedding reception. Did tweak the recipe a bit. Used frozen meatballs from Costco. Kept the ingredients the same, but tripled the recipe. Didn't measure but tried to keep the ratio the same. Must of done OK, since they disappeared in a flash. Will definitely make again for other parties. Oh, the one other thing that was different.....baked meatballs first, then put in crockpot for about 2 hours before serving. Also, like other people, heated the sauce in a pot first, then put sauce and meatballs in crockpot.

I love this!!  I was making these for a potluck so I had my husband pick up frozen meatballs and the chili sauce...well, he bought Sriracha chili sauce, oops!!  He wasn't going back to the store so I thought, oh well, I'll just use this.  Talk about a wonderful mistake!  Anyhoo, that's the way I always make them, keep in mind they are very spicy but oh so good!!  I also use Dijon for the mustard and a couple shakes of Worcestershire.  The other thing I do is I mix and heat up the sauce in a saucepan, throw the frozen meatballs right in the crockpot (on high), pour the sauce over and stir to coat.  Doesn't take too long to get them ready to go (hour or so starting from frozen, you can also defrost meatballs first or of course make your own fresh), just remember to stir occasionally.

Excellent & Easy. I used frozen meatballs and since I don't have a dutch oven I just tossed the sauce ingredients in a large pot and once heated I added the meatballs. I coated the meatballs and let them simmer in the sauce for a half hour until sticky and delicious. I will defiantly make again.  Thank you for sharing.

Everyone loves these meatballs! I use frozen meatballs and just mix all ingredients in my crockpot and cook on high for 2-3 hours. People literally cannot stop eating them, so make more than you think you'll need. When I am feeling lazy I even serve these as a dinner over brown rice with steamed vegetables, and the sauce tastes good spooned over top. These meatballs are the way to a man's heart :)

I used this recipe as a starting point for my meatballs. I substituted frozen original meatballs (not Italian meatballs) which have more flavor than plain hamburger. I used a whole jar of grape jelly and a whole bottle of cocktail sauce and skipped the mustard. These are a big hit every time! In fact, my man say's they are part of the reason the Seattle Seahawks won the Super Bowl this year --- the 12th man was well fed!!!!  LOL  Try these, they are delicious. I serve them in a crockpot.

You can't fail with this recipe. I didn't have chili sauce on hand but made some based off the Chili Sauce recipe by ELLENMEL on this site and honey these meatballs were gone before the 2nd quarter of SuperBowl XLVIII (2014 - Broncos vs Seahawks). I use frozen italian meatballs and an 18 oz jar of grape jam. I've made these countless times and you never can fail. A potluck staple.

We loved it.  I used frozen meatballs like most of the other reviewers.  Throw everything into a crockpot on high for an hour and it's all done.  I also added some HP sauce and worchestshire sauce.

These were really good! My very picky 8 year old ate all of her meatballs and she even saw me putting in the grape jelly.  She said "Are we having those weird meatballs?" and gobbled them up.  Great! My husband even took all the leftovers into work to share :)

I also recommend adding another tablespoon of chili sauce for every pound ground beef. I do not have a slow cooker, so instead I baked the meatballs at 350 in stoneware for 30 minutes, added the sauce, and baked another 20 minutes. However, I think next time I will only bake them for 20 minutes before adding the sauce. Incidentally, I tried this recipe with grape jelly AND separately with blackberry jelly (because I like blackberry jelly a lot). The blackberry sauce was a little thicker and stuck to the balls better, but was definitely sweeter, so if you want to try it, I suggest going down to 1/2 cup jelly and 3 tbsp chili sauce per pound of ground beef.

I made these for christmas last year. I was pressed for time and had never made meatballs so I bought frozen ones. The sauce was amazing. It is so simple it doesnt seem right. I kept these warm in a slow cooker during visiting with family at Christmas. The quick and yummy recipe took away stress from the holidays!

This was excellent and so, so easy.  Use frozen meatballs and it's even easier.  I've already been asked for the receipe.  Only thing I did different was I decreased mustard to 1 tablespoon. This was a "to taste" decision.

These were very good.  I used frozen Swedish style meatballs from BJ's.  They turned out great.  I didn't get Italian because some reviews said the flavors don't mix well but these were great.  I put them in a crockpot on low for 4 hrs.

We make these for our holiday party and people go nuts. They can't believe they are made with grape jelly. Be prepared to make 5x what you expect to feed the crowd!

These are just like my grandma made. No one ever believed about the grape jelly. I did add about double the chili sauce.

I prepared the meatballs slightly differently-I did not use the mustard.  I cooked the meatballs in the grape jelly and chili sauce, and then kept them in a slow cooker until I served them.  I also prepared the meatballs by using the Italian style breadcrumbs and egg.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE.  IT IS A GO TO ANYTIME I HAVE GUEST.  SINCE ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS ARE PANTRY ITEMS. (I ALWAYS HAVE PRECOOKED MEATBALLS IN MY FREEZER) IT CAN BE READY IN MINUTES.  THE MUSTARD KEEPS THE SAUCE FROM BEING TO SWEET AND BRINGS A LITTLE TANG TO THE SAUCE.  I ALSO ADD A LITTLE BEEF STOCK TO THE SAUCE, AFTER IT THICKENS I BRINGS IN ANOTHER LAYER OF FLAVOR.

I love meatballs...this recipe is fine...except for draining the grease. LEAVE THE GREASE! Meat tastes good because there's fat in it.  Drain the fat and your meatballs get dry and chewy...simmer in fat and they be moist.  You don't drink it...just cookin' with it man.  Let me say it another way...fat is a GOOD thing.

Used the sauce ingredients and Armour meatballs. So easy and everyone loved them! It was hard to stop eating them they were so tasty and it just doesn't get any easier. I think the hardest part was finding chili sauce! Thanks for sharing!!

Awesome. I used frozen Italian meatballs to save time, and added a *little* extra chili sauce. These were excellent and made the house smell great too!

Simple Out of this World Recipe.

Also try Jar of Heinz Chili Sauce, Can of Cranberry Sauce.  Heat on stove top.

Pour over cooked (frozen or scratch) meatballs.

GREAT!

Everyone thought they were great.  I would cook them in the oven about 10 minutes longer, they had to sit in the crock pot for an hour before I could serve them because they were not cooked all the way.  I also added some extra jelly and chili sauce.

This is a great recipe to bring to a party. People are always amazed when they hear the ingredients. This was the first dish to be emptied at a party over the weekend. It even bat out the buffalo chicken dip, which is always gone first!
