This recipe has good bones, but it really does need to be played around with. I used a cup of mayo and a cup of sour cream. Shredded my own cheddar and just added enough until it looked right. Everyone at our daughter's graduation party loved it. Thanks!

My entire family loves this recipe. I use a couple of chopped green onions instead of dried.
Let this sit overnight for the best flavor.

I used a 3 oz package of real bacon bits instead of the lb. of bacon and had to use quite a bit more mayo.  It turned out too "bacony," but several who taste-tested it for me liked it.  I will also experiment with it by adding in a block of cream cheese and rolling it into a cheese ball.

I was very glad to find this recipe for my husband who loves cheese and bacon together.  I altered this recipe a bit.  It came out very well.

1/2 pound bacon
1/2 pound extra sharp cheddar cheese
2 Tablespoons sliced green onions
1 cup fat-free sour cream
2 teaspoons powdered garlic
1 teaspoon powdered onion
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

I cooked the bacon very slowly to render as much fat as possible.  I added the sliced green onions during the last few minutes of cooking the bacon to soften them a bit.  I cubed the cheddar cheese.  I put all the ingredients in the food processor and processed for several minutes, adding a few drops of milk to make a smooth paste.

You could also substitute some of the sour cream or mayonnaise with soft tofu.

This tastes great but I cannot get over the appearance. I really didn't know what to serve it with. Used real bacon bits and that seemed to work. In the end, I added some ranch dressing to thin it out. This would probably be a good recipe for Super Bowl or game night. It was quick to prepare and really tasted good with a glass of cab.

This is great to serve if having a wine/dinner party! Also, you will get different textures with pre-shredded cheese or if you shred it yourself.  I've made it both ways and I can't decide which way is best! Also, the minced onions are the predominant flavor, you may need to add more!  I love garlic too, so I usually add more than a dash!  Oh and served with bacon flavored crackers?? Nothing better!!!!

This is excellent!!!  I found that I needed to use quite a bit more mayo than the recipe called for, but it was wonderful!

This dip is AMAZING. My roommate is lactose intolerant so we made it with soy cheese and it was still fabulous! I did add a 1/4 cup of ranch as some reviews suggested, but only because we LOVE ranch. I would make this recipe every week if I could! I do recommend you use a hearty chip (we used everything bagel chips) because the dip is thick and your chips may break. Ultimately, we cannot get enough of this delicious dip!

It's a cold dip, it should be made and put in the refrigerator.

Luv'd this one... Only one suggestion:  Would serve in a crock-pot, next time, on low.  It definitely needs to be eaten warm, as it separates when cool.  =]

Very tasty, and I also used more mayo then what the recipe called for.   Also, the appearance isn't the best, but if you can get past that and taste it....it's great!!!!

Sorry but this just was not good at all.  The ingredients didn't seem to blend well together it tasted just like bacon with some cheese on it.  Not sure what else to do with it to doll it up.
