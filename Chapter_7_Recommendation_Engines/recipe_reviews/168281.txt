These were pretty good just following the directions.  I made a second batch trying to "fluff" them up with some baking powder, but also added some salt.  This batch was way too salty and they were a bit hard.  I will follow the original recipe, but add a pinch of salt.  Loved this since I only had to have the rice flour instead of the other gluten free ingredients.  My kids really liked them.

These were great!  I left out the milk (lactose intolerant) and used 3/4 cup of coconut water (get at health food store)...also added 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tbsp brown sugar. I used 3/4 cups of white rice flour and 1/4 cup of brown rice flour.  Easy to make and was completely satisfied!

I made these excalty as the recipe stated, except for the addition of Flax seed meal that I add to all my baked products...and they were delicious!  Even my picky picky girls liked them and didn't know that they were wheat free.  I mixed them up and let them sit in the fridge over night.  I'll be making these often!

well I have to admitt that i did not wait the hour,  I have 3 kids.  I also added a spoon of Brown sugar, and vanilla, and my kids put fists full of rasins.  the texture is consistate to rice flour but tastes good.  Nothing is ever going to be like flour, sorry guys who don't know this.  We are not gluten free people, but we stay away from wheat products as they are really not so healthy for the body.  Anyhow, we will try this again, as it was not a bust.  Maybe next time I will wait the hour, as specified.

Very good thanks, although I found them a little hard. I tried this recipe to avoid sugar and salt. In the first try I added less salt than suggested and they needed more salt and were too thick for my taste so then I added a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of milk. Will probably try a variation with a little baking powder to make more lighter, and or reduce the eggs to two. It is essential to leave them at least an hour for the mix to change, as per directions. Maybe I will also try to leave them overnight next time instead of just an hour, it may work better and not need the baking powder.

Thanks for sharing this simple recipe, I do a meal for about 120 youth once a week, one eats gluten free, it's always nice to provide her the same meal as everyone else rather than a special item.

Used almond milk, vanilla, cinnamon, blueberries and a little brown sugar.  Used grapeseed oil, baking soda and baking powder to make fluffy.  They came out melting in your mouth...yummy!

I had to modify the recipe because I cannot have milk.  I used 1/4 cup coconut milk and 1/4 cup water to replace 1/2 cup of milk.  I also used coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil.  It was a very dense, moist pancake, and my kids really enjoyed them.  I will probably add some cinnamon and  Stevia next time around.

I found this recipe to be dry and bland.  I added brown sugar and vanilla to help add some flavour.  I also added baking soda.  The recipe also only yields about 8 small pancakes so if cooking for a family, double it at least.

I am on an anti-fungal diet so I can't have dairy, sugars or grains. These turned out more like crepes instead of pancakes, but DID make a delish crepe. I let it sit in fridge overnight like the recipe said...and I used goat milk instead of cow's milk, grapeseed oil instead of veg oil. Also I added 2 pkts of stevia for sweetness and a tsp of vanilla. I have 2 lil boys w/ a very picky appetite; my 4 YO loved them and my 3 YO did NOT. I served them w/ strawberries and homemade whipped cream. I will probably make these again, but cut the recipe in half since it wasn't a HUGE hit w/ the whole family.

The recipe listed is excellent for savory asian dishes with thick sauces.

I modified the ingredients and made very delicious banana breakfast pancakes:

-canola oil instead of vegetable oil (be careful as rice flour and canola oil tend to heat very quickly! I turned the heat down to medium )

-1/2 cup brown sugar

-1 over-ripe banana

-almond milk 

- sea salt

-teaspoon of vanilla extract

I did not wait an hour! I used a pinch of baking soda and everything turned out great! It made about 5 very large pancakes. The taste was mild, and a different texture than regular pancakes. I was very happy with the results!

I decided to modify this great recipe by first using 1/2cup  Almond milk insted of reg. milk,then I removed the veg. oil and used 2TBsp of Applesauce,1/2 tsp Vanilla. Then I changes the Dry ingredents first by adding 2 TBsp Brown Sugar,1 TBsp Flax Meal, Reduced the Salt to 1/4 tsp,added 1tsp Baking Soda, and then I added 1cup of Almond flour,and reduced the rice flour to a 3/4 cup. This was left to set for 1hour before cooking, produced light and fluffy- nutty tasting
pancakes that were fantastic.

I am allergic to wheat, potato and just about everything else that you can make gluten-free pancakes with. My oldest son is gluten intolerant too. We both LOVE pancakes though and I haven't had them in 3 years. So when I saw this recipe, I had to try it!

Making the batter was easy but the wait about killed me. I was so wanting pancakes I couldn't see straight! I had to turn down the stove eye after the first pancake (to med) and I measured them out with a 1/4 measuring cup.

They were WONDERFUL! The batter make 5 pancakes. They taste great and don't soak up the syrup like wheat pancakes so you end up with more of a hint of maple, not breaded maple. 

I will definitely make these again!

I thought these were bland and a little tough.  If you had a gluten allergy, they would be great though.

I had no idea rice flour could be used to make pancakes. slight modifications, added 1 tbsp brown sugar, 2 drops almond extract, subbed almond milk and canola oil, 2 tbsp potato flour instead of some of the rice flour, 1 tsp of baking powder. I only let it sit for about 45 minutes - but they came out moist and fluffy! Slightly closer to cake because its not as chewy as wheat flour pancakes, but awesome for gluten free.

I started experimenting with gluten free recipes a couple months ago and I had a very hard time to buy into it. We could not stand the different taste and consistency.
These pancakes are the best gluten-free meal I had so far. I followed a review suggestion and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda to add flufiness to the final product and 1 Tbsp of coconut palm sugar ( it has a much  lower glycemic index than brown or regular sugar). Even my 12 years old daughter loved the "hot cakes".
I will definetly will make it over and over again.
By the way, I waited two hours after making the batter before I cooked them and it really worked. I will do it overnight from now on.

My boyfriend recently went glutten-free and usually when I try to make a dish which I like as a glutten version, I don't like the glutten-free version that much. These pancakes are maybe even better than the glutten pancakes I used to cook. Thank you so much.

Made these this morning and they were good, though they were very egg-y.  I added some vanilla and a little brown sugar to the mix.  Will be making them again.

This recipe is worth a second try. Made them per recipe and waited one hour. Was a little runny, but continued to thicken as it sat on the counter, so second batch was thicker than first batch. I added blueberries to the batter that I spooned into the electric frying pan. So next time I will refridgerate over night to obtain thickness and/or maybe add a 1t of baking soda per other review.

Great!  I had a bunch of rice flour that I bought (can't remember why) and this will be an great way to use it all up.  I just made 1/3 of this recipe since I only had one egg on hand.  I also did not let it sit for an hour.  I added just a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon and these were excellent.  These did not rise like normal pancakes, and had more of the texture of a crepe.  I really liked them!

I am not really sure how to rate these, as I am new to the gluten-free world.  I did adapt the recipe to include 1 tsp baking soda, 1 Tbs of brown sugar, and a 1/4 c of flax seed.  I did let them stand the full hour.  My picky daughter ate them, so that is definitely a plus.

I used this recipe but made mine savory as I was in a pinch and wanted something to put a hamburger on.  I added garlic and onion powder to the mixture along with dried basil.  Some ground chia seeds gave it texture.  I was very happy with how the pancake "buns" turned out.  My 13 year old son; and food critic, enjoyed his as well. Nice base for many possibities.  Thank you!

Remember to add baking powder! You need leavening for pancakes to rise up and be fluffy!

Tried this recipe for the first time today. Made a 'ham and tomato sandwich' for lunch. Excellent substitute for normal bread. Also tried one with raspberry jam on it. A two course lunch without the dreaded gluten.  Going to make some more and cook them in butter and try them instead of naan bread with our curry. 
Not as fluffy as I expected but will work on that over the next few days. Might try GF baking powder. So many ideas to try after reading other reviews. 
Ps Where I live in Spain GF products are three times the price of normal foods, this is a versatile basic recipe with loads of possibilities.

Great recipe.  The taste is the same as regular pancakes but the texture is not as fluffy.  They don't freeze very well because they turn to rubber, but over all a great recipe if you have that craving.

Recipe yields a very small batch.  Pancakes are flat. I don't think I will make them again.

This was the very first time I made rice-flour pancakes; I wish I read some of the reviews prior to making them; I did a double dose and the first pancake was very hard - impossible to roll; I then added more milk - still not as soft as the ordinary pancakes.  I will definitely try with some baking soda next time. I personally loved them, but hubby didn't - he said they were simply not soft enough.  Great recipe, though, and, most importantly for me - easy to prepare.  Thank you for sharing.

I substituted lactose-free milk, and added a teaspoon of vanilla and a Tablespoon of raw sugar to the mix and refrigerated it overnight. In the morning just before cooking, I added some mashed banana. They turned out great! The texture is a little different from regular pancakes, but it completely satisfied my desire for pancakes. I definitely will be making these in the future!

I loved it! It was delicious. Tip: I mashed some bananas and honey, put it on top. It made it a 6 out of 5!

I made these with rice flour that I ground in my hand grinder. They had a bit of a crunch and reminded me of Hoe cakes.  I added 1 and 1/2 tsp of sugar and a dash of cinnamon.  They were good.

I used this basic recipe and made my own iteration. 
Used 2 eggs, 1.5 tbs avocado oil, 1/2 cup rice milk, a little over 1 cup rice flour, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp baking powder. Added Chia seeds and Enjoy Life chocolate chunks. Followed the recipe by mixing wet ingredients first then added dry. Cooked them immediately and didn't wait the 1 hour. They were DELICIOUS!! Probably the best pancakes I've ever made.

These were absolutely wonderful. I recently purchased a WonderMill and rice flour was the second type of flour I milled. I have made these twice now; once as the recipe is posted and once with an East Indian savory flare. This versatile dish is a new keeper in my menu planning =-) Thank you Zornista.

I followed the recipe exactly as is.  They were dense and stiff and mealy.  I make gluten free recipes for my husband all the time due to his wheat allergy and this was the worst recipe by far.  I'll stick to gluten free Bisquick until I can figure out how to make GFree pancakes that's actually TASTE like pancakes.

Made with almond milk in my blender ball shaker, left in the fridge overnight, and the kids are loving it.
