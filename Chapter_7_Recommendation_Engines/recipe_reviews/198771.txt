This was a very easy recipe and I enjoyed it a lot. After reading other reviews I found it probably needed a little grated fresh onion...about 1 TBSP. That did the trick for me, it was perfect.

I followed this recipe exactly, and I thought it was a pretty good salad. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it needs another layer of flavor. There is something missing although  I can't figure out what that is. I will try this again after I decide what it needs.

I liked it! Very quick to make. I used 1/2 Miracle Whip and 1/2 Mayo to give it some zip.

This was a great salad but there was a little too much "sauce" for me. I will lessen the amount next time. Thanks, this made a great lunch.

This was very good and different from the usual cucumber or pea salads. I did add salt and hot shot pepper blend. I did not use the milk because I just felt it might make it too watery. Having this tonight with the chicken fajita melts from the site!

I think adding a little dill to this recipe is that certain thing missing that so many mentioned.

Delicious and easy . Took to a Parade of Tables salad supper and amongst multiple salads, it was eaten up.  I did omit the milk so it would not be runny.

Really good, easy and different. Only change that I made was that I used 1/4 cup light sour cream & 1/4 cup mayo instead of all mayo.

Made this for company and everyone loved it. I did add some dried dill only because we like it. With or without, this is a great recipe.

Took past cooks advice - added some shredded onion and dill. Also cut the mayo in half and added sour cream. Even my husband who is not fond of dill nor cucumber LOVED IT
