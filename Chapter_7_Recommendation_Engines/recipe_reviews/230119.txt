I did a few things differently, per the reports of blandness. I wasn't looking for a vegetarian dish either, so I used chicken stock to boil the quinoa. I also roasted the vegetables with coconut oil and light salt and pepper.  To achieve a real "stuffing" tate, I added sage and a bit more pepper, 1 can of condensed cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom (both low sodium, fat free) soup. I was amazed that I whipped up everything I love about thanksgiving without all of the calories or work!

I made this for a party where there were some who eat gluten free & it was a big hit even among those who are gluten lovers. I had many recipe requests! I used more cranberries than called for to make it a little sweeter. Delicious!

Just finished eating this - made it for my first time with some modifications, thanks to the other reviewers for the heads-up on the flavor.  Here's what I did:

I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic in a pat of butter, then threw in some premade carmelized onions.  I chopped up some orange bell pepper and added that.  I had less than 3/4 cup quinoa on hand, so I added that dry to the sautee, after a few min put the ingredients to the side in a bowl.  I browned about 2 Tbs. of pine nuts in a frying pan, then set to the side.  I brought 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth to a boil.  Meanwhile, I chopped up less than half of the butternut squash along with less than one of the zucchini's (due to my quinoa shortage, I cut the ingredients by more than half) and fried them on low in a bit of butter and oil.  That took about 15 min or so to cook.  I added the quinoa sautee to the broth, then the cranberries and let it simmer for a while.  I feel like the cooking time from that point was another 1/2 an hour. After maybe 20 min of cooking and adding dashes of pepper and cumin, I added the squash and zucchini.  I noticed that the quinoa was still very wet towards the end, so I sprinkled in couscous very carefully, mixed well, covered, and eventually turned off the heat and put a paper towel over the pot, under the lid to absorb additional moisture. Finally, added green onions, pine nuts and chopped cilantro instead of parsley. Ate with a squirt of lime and topped with chopped avocado.

I made this recipe exactly as the directions stated and I thought it was pretty bland. Granted I prefer spicy foods, this dish seems like it's lacking something. I was looking for healthy recipes but I probably won't try this again.

I was looking for a vegetarian dish for Thanksgiving that could be made ahead of time and served cold and chose this recipe with a few additions for increasing flavor as many of the reviews suggested it to be bland. First off, I toasted the quinoa before cooking which I find adds great flavor to any quinoa dish. Secondly, I was looking  for the dish to be sweet and savory so the other additions included  one caramelized yellow onion , 2 cloves of roasted elephant garlic and used fresh rosemary to round out the savory. I used lemon juice in place of lime juice as well.

I agree that this recipe was very bland. At the end I added cinnamon and cayenne to spice it up a bit. It would be better to saute the squash and zucchini with spices in the beginning before adding quinoa - another option would be to use sweet potato instead of squash. Nice concept but lacking taste.

Made this recipe for a new year's day dinner in place of regular stuffing. It was delicious, and my husband loved it too. Salted and peppered to taste in addition to slightly longer cooking time on the squash, but could've been b/c i couldn't find a "small" butternut squash. Definitely will be making this again.

Followed the recipe as stated and found it to be pretty bland, but I couldn't figure out what it was lacking. If I did it again, I probably would'be tried using the chicken broth I had on hand instead of going out of my way to get some vegetable. It would lose it's vegetarian charm, but might have a richer flavor. I was disappointed. First time using Quinoa, though, and am thankful for the experience. Would have to figure out how to make it more flavorful.

I never thought of using quinoa as stuffing, but with a diabetic boyfriend it was a great idea!  We used a quinoa/brown rice/red lentil blend and tossed in some sausage, pear, and pecans instead of the squash.  It was very tasty and worked well for our healthier version of the traditional Thanksgiving meal!

I made this for Christmas dinner as I had a few gluten-free guests and one vegetarian (I put ham in my regular stuffing), and it was a big hit!  Thanks to all the comments I made the following modifications: I added 3 cloves of garlic and half a cup of pine nuts to the onions when I was sauteing them with a mix of olive oil and butter. I then sauteed the quinoa for a few minutes in the onion, garlic, pine nut mix and then added the broth. To the pot I added about 1/2 teaspoon each cinnamon and nutmeg, and a tiny bit of ground cloves. I substituted sweet potato cubed which I sauteed in butter and olive oil. Once that was close to done I lightly sauteed the zucchini. I also left out the apricots and cranberries, but it was still delicious.

I made this stuffing as an alternative to a traditional stuffing for our Easter dinner. I loved all the different veggies and fruit that were in this, and thought they gave it a good flavor. Some people who had not had quinoa before were a little reluctant to try it, but I always like making them branch out a little and try new things. My immediate family all really liked it though, and we enjoyed the leftovers in the days after Easter. Thank you for the recipe, Cynthiana!

Absolutely delicious.  I did replace apricots with prunes and craisins with raisins as I did not have them on hand.  Flavor was wonderful.

Made this for the first time tonight. On others' comments about being bland, I added spices to the olive oil in the pan and cooked them for a minute or two before adding in the zucchini and squash. The spices I added to the olive oil were rosemary, sage, pepper, Himalayan salt, cumin, ground jalapeno pepper, Cuban seasoning, McCormick Vegetable Grill Mates spice. Roasting the spice for a minute helps bring out the flavors even more.  I used peeled/cubed squash from Costco. I felt it was a little too big still and cut the chunks in 1/4's until they were more diced than cubed. I halved the recipe and glad I did. Even then it was still quite a lot. Would definitely still serve 5-6 people. Hubby and daughter (who loves quinoa) really liked it. Served it with Crispy Parmesan Tilapia (from Spendwithpennies). Would make again.

Nearly a 5-star (maybe after we make it again?)
Very yummy and healthy blend!  Flavor preferences are anti-apricot, so we used a little more dried cranberries.  Really nice flavor and colors for this dish!

I made this for my daughter, who loves quinoa dishes. Her eyes rolled back in her head, she was so happy. I’d just suggest adjusting parsley to taste and cooking the veggies to the doneness you prefer. She asked me to portion it out to take for school lunches this week.  Thanks for the recipe!

It turned out great! I brought it to Thanksgiving dinner as a vegan dish, and everyone loved it!!!

I left out the olive oil to reduce the calories, and it still turned out great.

This was good, I added some cumin, I stuffed the turkey with it and put the rest in a casserole dish in the oven. There was no difference really in the taste between the two methods. It doesn’t taste like stuffing, it’s just a quinoa side dish. I was looking for a gluten free stuffing, that would adddress my craving. So my search continues.

The flavor is pretty good without seasoning.

Made this recipe for my family this Thanksgiving. It is a lot of food. Recommend cutting the recipe in half or you'll have a ton of leftovers. Also I added extra dried cranberries and apricots. I also added half cup of pecans.

Absolutely delish! I made this as a side for our Christmas Eve dinner and everyone was raving about it. Made it exactly as described, but found that the cooking time for the quinoa was longer. I would definitely make this again.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  Great gluten free choice for my husband, but no one even knew it was gluten free.  The apricots & cranberries add such a nice sweetness that's not over the top.

I agree that it was bland. I added cumin and sugar and that helped but the spices in this recipe definitely need some work.

My gluten-free sister was a big fan and everyone else seemed to enjoy it too. I followed other posts and added some cinnamon and nutmeg to add a little more sweetness and flavor. It was a fun take on traditional Thanksgiving stuffing. My only complaint was the time it took to prep the squash. Next time I may just buy pre-chopped Squash.
