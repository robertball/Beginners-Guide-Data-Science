Next time I would use a little less mayo - just to get more chili flavor but all in all - very quck, easy and tasty :)

I made this exactly according to directions, except instead of frying I made it "oven fried" by putting it in a 350 deg. F oven until a meat thermometer reached 162 degrees, knowing that the temp would rise to 165 while the meat was resting (that's about 45 minutes or until juices run clear.) It was good, but lacked complexity. I will make it again, but like other reviewers will use less mayo next time for a stronger chile flavor. I was glad I had made homemade guacamole to go with it, because it was best when topped with the guac.

This was really good, not as spicy as I thought it would be. I didn't blend the mayo and chipotle peppers in the blender, just finely diced the chipotle and mixed it well in the mayo. I also used panko breadcrumbs instead of traditional breadcrumbs. Just covered the bottom of the pan with canola oil and pan fried until crispy!!

I really liked the flavor of the breading, but I think 375 is too hot for the grease. Mine turned out very dark before the inside was even cooked all the way. I'll try this again on 350, I think.
