Wonderful! Changed the sauce by starting with frying fresh sliced mushrooms, frying it with a chopped onion, added the flour and balsamic, also added half a can of cream of mushroom concentrated soup. Served it on mashed potatoes.

Boy, I hated to give this such a low rating because I had high hopes for this product.  I love the ease of using the pre-sliced mushrooms, but, we did not care for the texture at all.  The mushrooms had a "rubbery" texture in my opinion.  Neither my husband or I cared for the flavor either.   I used balsamic vinegar and the flavor just didn't work for us.  It needed something else in my opinion.  If I had added some beef broth and a little red wine I think we would have liked it so much better.  We scraped the mushroom mixture off the steak and unfortunately ended up throwing it out.  If the texture of a frozen mushroom doesn't bother you - I say give it a try, but, probably add a liquid of some sort to dilute the vinegar taste.

I used London Broil on the grill and did not add the vinegar, subbed water and it came out perfect!  Quick and easy!

Used to using fresh vegetables in my cooking and having noticed some reviews where people were unhappy with the texture of the mushrooms I was a little nervous going into this recipe. I used up some venison steaks I had in the freezer and followed the rest as directed. I was pleasantly surprised. My mushrooms were satisfactory to us, as frozen goes, and did not have a weird texture to them - and I'm a picky person when it comes to that. That leaves me to question the freshness of the product others received. If I make this again I think I would leave out the vinegar, just a personal preference. Overall, it was quick, easy and somewhat healthy meal. I served it with a garden salad and cheesy cauliflower.

My husband really enjoyed this. I added some beef base to up the beefy flavor of the sauce.

I made this in compliance with the recipe except for 3 items. I used already cooked left over from a previous meal and this was so dry I put in 1/4 cup of red wine. I also added a s sprinkling of onion powder. My husband deemed it "quite tasty." I rated it down a star because it had you cook the butter.

I don't know if it was the red wine vinegar (which I luv) combined with this particular cut of meat or what, but I found this mix of flavors just disgusting.  Won't be making this again!

I think this recipe has all kinds of possibilities.  I did use a steak of a little more quality, and I did add just a touch of red wine to the mushroom sauce (it needed a little more moisture, so why not?).  This made for a very nice dinner along with a salad and a few diced potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe, Birds Eye!

This turned out better than I expected. I used red wine vinegar. I did season the steaks well before cooking & added quite a bit of salt & pepper to the sauce. We did not have any issue with the texture of the mushrooms. I still felt like it needed something, just not sure what. If we make this again, I will probably grill the steaks & possibly add a little "browning & seasoning sauce" to the mushroom mixture.

This dish is amazing! I used fresh mushrooms instead of frozen but otherwise followed the menu. It was delicious.

Great! I loved the finished product. I substituted the flour for a low carb baking blend (basically a coconut, almond and oat flour blend) and it was great. I also used fresh mushrooms. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

We loved this recipe.  But I made changes so that I rated is as such.  I marinated a London Broil cut in a McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning packet.  Only had balsamic vinegar so I used it and fresh sliced mushrooms.  It was delicious!  I will make again.

Our steaks were delicious. The mushrooms and sauce just weren't that good. I couldn't get past the texture of the mushrooms. Maybe it was because they were frozen? And my husband said the sauce tasted more like it should be on pork chops. We both pushed the sauce aside and just ate the steak. Very bland. More seasoning would be needed... but I don't think I can get past the texture of the mushrooms!
