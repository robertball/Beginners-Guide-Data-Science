I made this to use as a salad dressing and it turned out great! I didn't have soy milk on hand so I used the 2% milk that I did have. Two tablespoons didn't seem to be enough to get mine to blend so I added two more which ended up being too much resulting in a thinner dressing but that was my own fault. My husband and I both loved this and the best part was that he had no idea it had tofu in it. This would be great on fish tacos! It would be good on a lot of things actually. Thanks for sharing!
