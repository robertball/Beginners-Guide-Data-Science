These will curl your toes and make your eyes roll back in your head...  if you like pecans.  They became the favorite of my second son who began making them ALONE by the time he was 12.  He uses regular flour and, not knowing anything else, they still melt and are still outrageously good!

This is my family's recipe also, great to find it!  Instead of rolling the cookies in the confectioner's sugar, we shake them in a brown paper bag, a few at a time...

These came out as I remember them from growing up. I think they need to be a bit sweeter though.

My grandmother always made these for the holidays.  They were her signature Christmas cookies.  The only difference is she made a thumbprint, and then after gently rolling in powdered sugar, she filled them with tinted frosting.  I can't imagine them any other way.  Oh, and she baked them for 20 mins on 350.
