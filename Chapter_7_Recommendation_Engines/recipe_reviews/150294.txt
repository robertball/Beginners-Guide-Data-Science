1) Romaine hearts should not even be optional- they don't belong in this dish.  2) I think the writer of the recipe forgot to mention that you should use an UNRIPE mango that's green and tangy.  The sweet mushiness of a mango distracts the palate.  3) I agree with another reviewer and spiced it up with some cayenne, cilantro, and a few little green chillies.  4) make sure you rinse canned chickpeas well, otherwise they retain a starchy liquid which tastes funny

I loved the combination of ingredients but found the lack of seasoning to be a bit disappointing. I added a little cayenne and fresh cilantro which definitely helped. Overall refreshing and tasty.

Very tasty but must be eaten at once. Not good as leftovers!

I loved the idea of the fresh fruit and the chickpeas as well as the simplicity of the dish. It was rather bland. I will try it again but next time I may add some red pepper flakes to liven it up.

Nice salad for lunch. I really like this IF you leave out the romaine hearts and add cilantro and red pepper flakes. I also left out the celery but will try it next time.

Fun combination of ingredients but I gave it a 4-star rating since I would prefer some sort of dressing to go with it which the recipe doesn't include.

Delicious refreshing. I added a shot of my favourite West Indian curry sauce (it has a mango base a perfect complement.)

Delicious! My daughter and I bonded over me chopping the fruits and veggies and feeding some as we went along. My advice is to cut up the carrots really tiny. Makes it easier to serve to children, who might not dig the big crunchy carrots. Thank you Tarama for this recipe

The addition of mango is fantastic. I make lots of chick pea salads throwing in basically whatever I have. But the mango makes this recipe fantastic. I also skipped the romaine and added red pepper flakes. So good!
