The onion, pickle, and dill in this recipe will take you back to your mom's tuna sandwiches.  Due to allergies, I haven't eaten tuna since 2007, and was eager to try anything to bring back that taste, having tired of chicken. I left out the sugar. A couple of suggestions: start with less oil and then go from there. 1/2 cup renedered a runny outcome. Follow the instructions regarding the process to ensure a perfect texture. Then, when getting to the point of adding the chickpeas, pickle, etc. pulse until you get a rough texture. This gives a bit more bite and flavor than having it too blended. This is really a great recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.

This is a really great recipe for beginner vegans!! I did substitute the soy for almond milk since I already had the unsweetened. Really convenient as well that I already had most of this in my kitchen, and it’s super easy to follow and it’s pretty similar to the real thing. It’s good for progressive beginners like myself, 100 percent recommend!

As someone who has never eaten tuna salad in their entire life, I liked this recipe a lot. My grandmother however who loves tuna salad was not too pleased. Put this under the category of “you’ll like it if you don’t expect it to taste like the real thing.” In the future I’ll refer to it as “chickpea spread” so people taste it with no expectations or bias. Excellent recipe and very easy to make. Thanks for sharing!
