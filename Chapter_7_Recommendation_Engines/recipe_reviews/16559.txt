You can freeze in advance and then pop them out frozen and reheat in a 350 degree over for 20-25 minutes.  Great to have on hand for last minute appetizers.

Very good & easy to make ahead.  I added a can of pizza sauce and used processed cheese with pepperoni in it.  Made topping the day before and just put it on the bread and heated before the party.  Put shredded mozzarella on top before baking.  Used cocktail rye and mini pitas.  Would make again.

A hit with kids and adults at a small get together my husband and I had.  We weren't able to find the rye squares at the store that day, so we cut slices of rye bread up in fourths, added some pizza sauce to the bread before adding the topping, and topped with a bit of parm and mozz.  They were great!

These are addictive! My mom has my family hooked on these. Use Jimmy Dean sage sausage ('lite' if you're feel'in guilty LOL), add some chopped cilantro and chopped garlic to cooking mixture) This recipe accounts for about 3 added lbs this holiday!

Yummy Yummy!  These were very good.  I used American cheese slices instead of Velveeta type cheese, because that's what I had on hand.  I also mixed in a little pizza sauce with everything else, but it probably didn't make much difference.  12 min. is plenty unless you like them more crisp.

These were really good and a easy appetizer. I don't think pizza is a good name for them though. i couldn't find cocktail rye bread so I used pumpernickle and they were delicious.

My friends get mad at me when I don't bring these to parties! I add a touch of cayenne pepper for a kick. Oh, and I don't generally use any onion with mine.

This is a great appetizer and perfectly easy! After trying these, as good as they are, I believe they would really be something with added ingredients suggested by other reviewers, such as mozzarella, pizza sauce, cayenne pepper. The possibilities are endless! Thanks for the recipe!

This is an old favorite of my husband.  My recipe calls for 1 Tablespoon of Oregeno or to taste, before you add the cheese...adds a lot of flavor.

I did add a bit of pizza sauce, as other's suggested.   I also tried some with mozzarella cheese on them, as suggested, but liked them much better without.   Will definitely be a repeat.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

Definitely NOT a mini pizza. It's more of a hamburger on rye.

And I can't stop eating them.

Did not use sausage or american cheese. I added pepperoni when they came out of the oven and were HOT. I had 3 left at the end of the night, when I woke up this morning they were gone, someone had them as a midnight snack! Thanks

Great lunch idea. The title of the recipe kind of throws you. More like a loose meat cheeseburger than pizza. I added chopped mushrooms with the onions for sautéing, along with a little kick of cayenne.  Thanks DeniseOO

My family has been making these for years. We call them Hanky Pankys. I use ground beef, pork sausage, 1 lb.Velveta cheese, 1/2 tsp. oregano, 1/2 tsp. garlic salt & cocktail rye bread. They freeze well and you can pop a few out and bake at 350 for 10 minutes. Sastas

I found this recipe too salty and I think the recipe would be much improved by fretting rid of the processed cheese and substituting other ingredients such as pizza sauce and another type of cheese.  As is, I would never make again.

My mom made these while I was growing up. She used a jar of cheez whiz, pound of sausage, and pumpernickel bread. Not the healthiest but it sure is tasty. I've made it for friends throughout the years and they are devoured every time.

Always a hit for football parties. They taste better if you freeze them first.
