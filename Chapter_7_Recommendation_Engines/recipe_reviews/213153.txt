I just made this and it was awesome.  I substituted Green Giant's Mexicorn and used a medium spiced tomato and pineapple salsa.

Like a mexi-lasagne!  I sauted an onion in a bit of olive oil before adding the beef then also added about 1/2 tsp cumin and a couple cloves of crushed garlic with the beef.  Didn't toss in the peppers (only had red and yellow) until the beef was almost done.  Used one rinsed can of corn and one can of rinsed black beans and added a can of chopped green chilies.  Turned out great!

This was pretty good but I found it quite bland. It's something I will try again, but I will have to make a few adjustments. Such adding a bit of salt, as well as some Mexican seasoning.

My husband wasn't too keen - too tomatoey for him, but that's him. The kids (18 months and 3 years old) and I loved it! I used 6 corn tortillas because that's what I had. I watching my weight and was surprised when I added it up how healthy this was (apart from the salty salsa). Will definitely become a staple in our house - sorry hubby!

I made this last night, but I add taco seasoning to the meat, add a can of black beans, and leave out the extra tomatoes. I added a cup of salsa to the bottom of the 9x13 pan before layering the tortillas. Don't forget the sour cream on top when you serve it! This makes the dish.

My husband said it was ok but he'll eat anything. I didn't care for it. It was very bland and the flour tortillas were mushy. If I were to make it again I would add some chopped chili peppers and try corn tortillas.
