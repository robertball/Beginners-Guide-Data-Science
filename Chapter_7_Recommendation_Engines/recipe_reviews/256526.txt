Made as written and they came put perfectly. These were very tasty and the ranch flavor comes through nicely without overpowering. Thanks for sharing!

Made with and without the ranch dressing. Loved it either way. Hit the spot with a little bit of spice. Thank you!

This was very good!  The chicken was so moist, almost melt in your mouth.  I had to cook  2 pieces longer than the other 2 because they were SO thick.  I had also soaked them in buttermilk (before I saw this recipe).  Once again, it was very good!

Made this chicken by the recipe except I salted the chicken breasts just a little before I coated it with the first flour. It is a really good, easy recipe. I didn't make sandwiches, I served it just as a piece of fried chicken with sides. My family loved it!

Delicious!! I used pepper jack cheese and I sautéed white onions and a red bell pepper in butter for added flavor.

These are good. I used 2 large chicken breasts cut into 6 pieces; pounded the chicken to about 1/2 in. And served as sliders.  I doubled the coating recipe. But kept  the spicy mayo as written. We had a ton of it left. But it really was very good. . The chicken was light, crispy and juicy. I'll make it again.
