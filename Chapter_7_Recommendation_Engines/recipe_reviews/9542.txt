I have made this several times and had no trouble as long as I used "Betty Crocker Home Style Frosting Mix - Fluffy White".  When I tried to used mixes from different companies it did not work.  When I compared the ingredients, the BC mix has egg whites in it and the others did not so that may be the reason.  My mom made this type of divinity when I was growing up and I know it came from a Betty Crocker cookbook! In San Diego, I found the mix at Albertson's and Stater Brothers markets. Contact General Mills customer service to find out if any stores in your area carry it - they gave me a list of six!

I think there must be something wrong with the amount of boiling water for this recipe - 1/2 cup seems like too much.  I could not get the frosting mix, boiling water & corn syrup to whip up into anything but runny sweet syrup. I added the confectioners sugar, and continued beating.  Nothing.  I finally put the entire concoction in the microwave to try to boil it, hoping that it probably needed some additional heat.  I then continued beating.  It finally beat into something so hard that I had a hard time getting it out of the bowl and into a container.  I ended up rolling the final concoction into small little balls.  I feel this was a waste of ingredients, including the frosting mix, 4 cups of confectioners sugar, and 1 cup of chopping pecans!  Has anyone else had problems with this recipe????

I also used the BC frosting mix.  It turned out excellent.  I was scared after reading previous ratings about it not whipping to form a stiff peak.  I used my Kitchen Aide mixer and it whipped up in about 5 minutes.  This one is a keeper for my family...My mom loves divinity!!

Very leary after reading the reviews but it turned out great and I used the water it called for and about 2½ cups of powdered sugar.  I never measured it I used it as it was needed so I just poured until I felt it was right.  But the recipe was on the frosting box.  It was Betty Crocker and it said after dropping it on the cookie sheets one needs to bake it at 325°for 5 minutes.  I did this and it set the candy up immediately.  For one that has never been able to make divinity no matter what I tried I was estatic with glee that I finally made divinity that I did not have run all over the place....I will definitly use this recipe again and the neighbors were thrilled too!  Merry Christmas with five star joy!!!!

I ike the ease of  this and is good too. I followed the previous writers advice and onl6y put 1/4 cup boiling water in and then gradually added the powdered sugar until the candy would hold its shape. It took al  four cups of the powdered  sugar. I  would suggest dusting the wax paper with powdered sugaf before dropping the candy  onto it. I will make this again. v ery creamy and very,very sweet.    Melly

My mom made this all the time when we were growing up.  I've only had luck using the Betty Crocker white frosting mix.  None of the others seem to work.

this recipe might make an excellent fuge recipe--i will know shortly.  after trying this recipe i figure there is something that the submitor did tell divulge or that person forgot about.  this turned out to be the worst recipe ever and i KNOW that i followed that persons directions to the letter--although the title does it justice that may be the ONLY thing that is correct it is definitely CREAMY,  creamy what i have no idea.

Very easy recipe.  Taking other reviewers advice I used 1/4 cup water.  I use chopped black walnuts, which, to me, have always seemed perfect for Divinity, probably because that is what I remember my Grandmother using.

This recipe is also on the back of the Betty Crocker Frosting box and it says to bake for 5 minutes at 325. I made 2 batches and the batch that I baked turned out much better.

Lesson learned on this one - Believe the other reviews and don't try the recipe as it is hoping it will turn out okay.  Doctored it up as much as possible to try to make it work so that I didn't waste the ingredients.

I should have read the reviews. My didn't work either. 10 mins of mixing and all I have is a big bowl of frosting. I used a generic frosting - I'll try again with BC.

DON'T DO IT!! First, I made a batch with the original recipe. A flop! Runny syrup. Waste of ingred. Then I followed the user's suggestions using 1/4 c. boiling water. This stuff was so stiff the mixer could barely handle it. Light and fluffy, I think not. How about concrete frosting?! I can't believe I wasted a hard-earned vacation day for this!

This is not good. Because you can't buy powdered frosting mixes.
I did not get to try it.
