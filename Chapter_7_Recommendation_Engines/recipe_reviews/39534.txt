My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I also added 1/2 an avocado to the mix.  The only thing lacking was a little extra kick so next time I'll use 2 Serranos instead of just 1.

Very good recipe!.. I liked the flavor of the sauce.  I used celery instead of cucumber because it's what I had.  It still gave it the right crunch needed.  I also added 2 sliced avacados.  For the heat I used about 4 dashes of hot sauce tasting after each addition, that way it was just right!  Served it in Margarita glasses along with tortilla chips and saltines for those who wanted them.  Next time I wont use the large shrimp because it was harder to get everything on the cracker... In my opinion the smaller salad shrimp would work better.  I don't see how this would serve 8... It served 4 of us all right, but we would have liked more!

This is a very good summer appetizer, refreshing and cool. It's a nice switch from the ketchup-y, horseradish-y shrimp cocktails. Thanks Rey!

This was pretty good but it was missing something so I added cayenne pepper to my liking and 2 garlic cloves minced.Also I think this recipe is more for two, maybe we are just pigs. :) Perfecto!!

This is fantastic. I sometimes substitute spicey V8 juice for the tomato juice and it comes out perfect every time, but with an intense heat. Thank you Rey, it is perfect as it is.

Made this 2 days in a row for different parties... doubled the recipe, added chunks of avacado both days..  2nd day, had less time so, used ready made salsa instead of tomato sauce...  
I have to say, it was just as good, if not a little better.  
Did not have leftovers either day and numerous comments about how great it was.  Both parties were large group potlucks and the Tejano Shrimp Cocktail was the most popular both times.

This recipe is a real Winner!

We followed it to a t, and our dinner guests raved about it! I'm doing a repeat request for easter actually.
This was easy, healthy, cost effective and oh -- sooooo good! My five year old loved it as there wasn't any "sauce" he has to worry about either! ;)

I rate this on how much was left in the bowl--NONE!  I don't eat shrimp but prepared this for a birthday celebration and ALL the shrimp lovers devoured it.  The only change was made with substituting the serrano pepper with chopped jalapeno pepper!

I served this instead of the traditional "Shrimp Cocktail" at a dinner party and it was very well received. Delicious flavor and very easy to make ahead.

Amazing! I looove this recipe. I didn't change one single thing about it and it turned out great. The amount of spice was perfect for me, but of course you could add extra peppers for more. We just ate this with a fork right out of the bowl. Next time I am going to add avocado as someone suggested.

Love this recipe...the only thing is, instead of using tomato sauce I use clamato juice.  I also add a bit of tabasco sauce.

Reminds me of home (South TX)! Extremely tasty and popular! I used both serrano and jalapeno peppers for kick, and added avocado and a little spicy V-8 juice in place of tomato sauce. Here in Arizona, they serve this on crispy tostadas. Gracias, Rey!

I've made this 4 times to bring to parties and it is always a huge success. Each time there were requests for the recipe. I have made it as is, and have also added avocado and an extra serrano pepper.

This sounds like a great way to go about preparing this dish, but all my tears growing up by the border I came accross a better way to make this years ago. It is traditional to also add the following ingredients:Add diced octopuss (real or artificial), add diced avacado, add Chamoy Salsa, salt, and Key limes to personal preferance of spice and flavor. Serv heaped and dripping on a Tostada shell with mayonase lightly spread accross it. Messy but Tastey!!!!!!! Enjoy

LOVE IT!!!  I've made it twice already!    The second time I decided to try the frozen shrimp so I bought the smaller already cooked shrimp. I also added avocado and I stuffed the shrimp cocktail into a pita pocket.  It made an EXCELLENT lunch!!  Very tasty and very healthy too!!  I'm definitely making this again and again!!!

Freakin excellent. It is a great alternative to those old tired original style shrimp cocktail recipes. This is similiar to a ceviche. I added more of almost everything, but that was my personal preference. It was bright, colorful and very refreshing on a hot south Texas evening.

I've made this recipe several times and it is perfect as written, brimming with fresh tastes and a little kick. It's also visually beautiful.  In the past I tried adding another Serrano pepper because we like spicier food but it overwhelmed the other flavors and threw the whole dish out of balance.   I also tried the avocado suggestion in the past and it didn't  look visually appealing. It's simply perfect as written.

If you want this hotter, use Mr. & Mrs. T-S Spicy tomato juice used for bloody Mary's instead of tomato sauce.

Loved this; it was great the night I made it, and even better the next day.  I added cubed avocado and used Anaheim chilies (as that is what I had on hand) mixed with a jalapeno. Love it hot!!

This dish was just ok. The cilantro was a little too much.

The basic recipe really is good (hence the five-star rating), but my daughter and I like a bit of 'kick' in dishes such as this: We seeded only half the pepper, plus we made the adjustment recommended by another reviewer and added avocado. Perfection!!!

It came out great! My husband and I both dislike fishy tastes, so I omitted the clam juice and instead of horseradish i put a bit of thousand island and i served it with margaritas and salted crackers gamesas! He really liked it!

This was good, but I had to spice it up a bit.  I used a jalepeno in leiu of a serrano pepper, I also added cayenne pepper for some kick.  It was nice and refreshing.
