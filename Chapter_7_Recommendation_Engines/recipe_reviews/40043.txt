Made just as written and this is excellent chow-chow! I followed the scale to make 4 pints for my own enjoyment. But, I am going to make the full amount to give for Christmas along with my jams and preserves. Thanks, Eloise Liberty, for posting a recipe I've been trying to hunt down for 30 years.

I made it for the first time as I lost my original recipe and it is fabulous!  Almost like the one I use to have but just as tasty tried to post a photo but every time I do I get error message saying picture is not the right size.  That is very frustrating.
