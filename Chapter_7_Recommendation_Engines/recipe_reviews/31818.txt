This recipe was great! Very tasty. I decreased the amount of bread crumbs to 3 cups and added about ½ lb of ground meat. I browned the meat while sautéing the onion and garlic then followed the recipe as is. I also had to add a little extra olive oil when mixing with the bread crumbs. Everything turned out wonderfully. I am sure it would be just as great without the meat but my husband is a meat eater and I had to put it in somewhere. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

After a horrible eggplant parmesan, I went on the quest for finding a new, tasty eggplant recipe -- and this was it!  I adjusted the recipe, however. I used 1/4 onion, 2 cloves garlic, and 1 celery stick. I also added Parmesan cheese to the stuffing mixture.  I stuffed the eggplants and drizzled some olive oil over the raw eggplant.  I baked it for 20min uncovered and it was perfect!  Topped off with some grated marble cheese.  Mmmmmm tasty!

I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars if I could.  It was pretty good, I did a lot of tweaking though.  I cut out most of the breadcrumbs, just sprinkled some on top.  I used cous cous in the stuffing.  I baked covered for 30 minutes, removed foil - cooked an additional 5 minutes (to brown the breadcrumbs) and then topped with cheese and broiled for a few more minutes.  The shells were definitely soft and edible this way.  When simmering the stuffing, I added lemon juice and some chicken broth to make it more moist and flavorful.

I was somewhat skeptical of this recipe after reading some of the reviews, but it turned out to be DELICIOUS!! here are the few minor changes i made: 1) precook the eggplant in the microwave so it doesn't soak up so much oil (which i also reduced to 1 1/2 tbsp), 2) i didn't have any bread crumbs so i omitted those completely and found it to be moist and delicious just the same!, 3) i added italian seasonings and red pepper flakes for some zing, 4) as per other recommendations, i mixed feta up with everything else and then topped the whole thing off with mozzarella and feta both. one of the best veg-friendly dishes i've found in a while!

My husband and I both love this recipe just as is!  It is hearty and filling and almost tastes as if it were stuffed with crab.  This also freezes decently well, making for good leftovers.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I loved this recipe but made some alterations: I microwaved the cubed eggplant,onions and green pepper because too much olive oil is absorbed to saute this. Instead I finished the veggies off by sauteing them with the olive oil, garlic to brown them a bit. I added the tomatoes and I added a little ground lamb because I had some left over. I added only 1/2 the breadcrumbs to the veggie mixture. I followed the rest of the recipe as written but I lightly shook a bit of ground cinnamon over the feta before I melted it. Very Greek; very good!

Even without one of the main ingredients (I had to substitute grated pepper jack cheese for the feta), this was very tasty. I needed to add olive oil to the skillet a couple of times  because the eggplant absorbs the oil as it cooks. I also cut back on the amount of breadcrumbs--4 cups seemed like a lot.  Even so, there was still a bit more stuffing than I could fit in the shells.

As-written I can only see this as a 3 star recipe, but with some simple changes based partially on common sense, personal preference, and slightly on what I had handy, this versatile recipe is a keeper! What I did: I halved the recipe, using one eggplant. Instead of bread crumbs I used about a cup (cooked) of whole wheat cous cous (I accidentally made way too much cous cous, but I'll talk more about that in a sec...). I used WAY less oil than called for, maybe 4 tablespoons at most. I only had some shredded cheddar and some shredded parmesan cheese, so I mixed the cheddar into the filling, and used the parmesan on top, the last 5 minutes of cooking. I pre-roasted my eggplant halves (sprayed with olive oil spray) for about 15 minutes while sauteing the filler veggies, then filled th eggplants and baked it all for another 15 minutes, adding parm cheese in the last 5. Everything was perfectly moist, flavorful, and the skins were toothsome, but tender enough to cut and eat. Now what to do with all this extra cous cous I prepared? Luckily, there was about a cup and a half of veggie filling that just wouldn't fit into the shells (and I stacked and packed those suckers high!) so I mixed it all together, along with the leftovers of a balsamic vinegar swiss chard that I made as a side, but found the taste too strong. Voila! Instant lunch for the next day! My husband and I each got 2 meals from this and the leftover filling!

My husband, family and friends have all loved this recipe. I use only 2 cups of bread crumbs and after reading some other reviews, 2 cups of cooked ground beef or turkey.  The feta seemed to get to dry and hard on top, so I just mixed it in the stuffing the last time I made it. Also, while I prepare the stuffing, I put the eggplant shells in the preheated oven and precook them.  Then it is all tender and tasty and the entire thing can be eaten!

I made this recipe with the filling from "Lamb and Feta Peppers" from this site. I really just wanted to comment on the baking time...I recommend baking them for 30 minutes, covered. Then uncover, add any cheese or extra sauce and cook for an additional 10 minutes. The eggplant shells will be perfectly cooked.

My husband and I really enjoyed these.  Only made a few minor changes.  Reduced the oil to about 1 tbsp, used about 1/3 cup (1 slice) fresh bread crumbs, and colby jack cheese which I mixed into the filling.

I didn't care too much for this recipe the way it is. I will make all the changes suggested or my own next time because I like the ingredients and would like to give it another chance. I like it that's pretty easy to make. I used 2 cups of breadcrumbs and it was still too dry. I would follow the suggestions of other cooks and leave the crumbs just for the topping. Definitely add cheese to the mixture and make sure not to overcook it. Don't leave out the parsley.

Definitely too much bread crumbs in the recipe. I used half the called for amount and it was plenty. Outside of that quite tasty, though a cheese other than feta might work better.

The first time I made this we loved it, although I used cheddar instead of feta.  Did take a little longer cooking time, though.
Second time I just used some things I had on hand - leftover dirty rice and mexican cornbread in the place of breadcrumbs.  That was great, too.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Left out the bread crumbs, added Italian seasoning, stirred the feta into it before filling the shells, and baked. It was FABULOUS. I loved this dish and will make it again and again. YUM!

This was delicious!  In an effort to reduce the over 800 calorie count I did make a few changes-I reduced the oil to a few tablespoons and sauteed all.  After tender, I reduced breadcrumbs to just 1/4 cup-turned out beautifully!  I added summer squash to the saute, and topped with goat cheese as I did not have any feta.  Will definately make again!

Delicious. I love eggplant, and I'm always looking for new recipes.
I cut down on the oil, cheese and breadcrumbs to make it a little more waistline-friendly, but it's a fantastic, simple recipe. Definitely use the feta, it's perfect for this.
All that was missing was the balcony in Greece, but one can always wish... :)
Thanks for sharing!

This was really good, but it fell apart easily.  I don't know if it was the way I made it, or if it's jsut the way it works with the ingredients.  The presentation wasn't ideal for me, but that didn't affect the taste! :)

The original recipe calls for way too much breadcrumbs.  I only used about 1/3 the amount called for.  I also added ground beef, which I browned while sauteing the onion and garlic.  Other than that I followed the recipe as is.  Pretty good, with some tweaking  :)

Following another reviewer's suggestion, I simmered the veg mix in water to cut down on the oil, and then used a slotted spoon to transfer the veg into the bread crumb bowl. I only used 1.5c bread crumbs and thought it worked great -- wouldn't suggest going over 2c. Unfortunately, the eggplant shells didn't cook through in the 20 min they spent in the oven, so my guests ended up picking out the filling and eating it w/o the shell. The recipe definitely has potential, so next time I'll try baking the shells, and then stuffing them and baking them further.

My husband and I loved these!  I did use a colby/jack cheese mixture because we aren't big fans of feta, but other than that I didn't change a thing.

Be warned, this recipe makes a LOT!  I had to cut down the bread crumbs to two cups so everything would fit back into the eggplant shells.  I also only used 1 tbsp of olive oil to cut down on fat, and sprinkled some bread crumbs on top of the filling before baking.  Tasted surprisingly like meat for something vegetarian.

This was a good recipe -- even my very picky, culinarily unadventurous dad ate it. I made the Tzatziki II dip from this site and put it on the table as a condiment. It really added a zing when eaten on the vegetable mixture.   I added extra garlic, like other reviewers said, and reduced the amount of bread crumbs to a little more than a cup.

The filling for the eggplant was simply delicious, but I did cut down on the breadcrumbs also.  However, no mention was made about eating the eggplant shells.  They were inedible so I assume they were not to be eaten.  You could peel the eggplant and make the filling recipe as a vegetable casserole.  I'm going to do that next time.

This recipe is fantastic!  I didn't have feta so I subbed with queso fresca which is a crumbling mexican white cheese and it worked just as well.  I will make this time and again.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I think the reason most people think 4 cups of bread crumbs is too much is because the recipe should say FRESH bread crumbs.  If you use the canister variety, it is too much.  Also, since feta is not really a melting cheese, it is much better mixed in.  I hate it when people review a recipe after they have a bunch of changes, so the only changes made were to mix in the feta.  It is good just the way it is.

I sliced a bit on the bottom of the eggplant so it wouldn't roll. Unfortunately it was small so I had to make adjustments to the measurements. I did add italian seasoning. Next time I could use a can of diced tomatoes instead to speed things up. There was a LOT of stuffing left over, so then I stuffed half a green pepper and half a tomato. Also, it took about a half hour to bake, I even turned up the over to 400. I will definitely make this again, I like the suggestion of also adding ground meat.

The idea was great, but I followed recipe to the letter. It was inedible due to too many breadcrumbs! One fourth cup of breadcrumbs would have been enough. The eggplant mixture looked great, smelled great ... wish i had tasted it before it got smothered!

This was wonderful.  Even my husband who would rather be boiled in oil than eat eggplant said this was a keeper!  We will definately make this again.  I did cut down the breadcrumbs some.  I only had 2 cups on hand.  that was plenty in my opinion.

I left out the green peppers (dislike with eggplant) and bread crumbs.  It was rather tasteless so I added lots of dried basil and more garlic.  Topped with feta cheese, it was tasty.

This came out excellent! We did not have feta, and my husband cannot have cheese so I mixed in some goat cheese in the last step befors stuffing. And it was hot so I put some foil down and put it on the top shelf of the grill instead of the oven for about 20 min. Came out EXCELLENT. Will make this again for sure. Make sure to add plenty of salt and pepper, and I did extra garlic cus we love it.

This recipe is a good start but needs to be made to suit your tastes.  Since I was only cooking for me, I used one smaller eggplant, 1 small onion, 2 cloves garlic, 1  roma tomato, 1/2 green pepper.  I added dried parsley and oregano and a little garlic/wine seasoning salt.  I just eyeballed the olive oil.  Instead of  bread crumbs, I used couscous.  I had plenty of leftover stuffing mix.

This recipe was great although I changed it a bit.  I used a cup and a half less of the bread crumbs.  I increased the amount of feta incorporating it into the stuffing as well as on top.  Lastly I prebaked the eggplant shells sprayed with a little olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper, stuffed them and then placed back in the oven to brown the top.  My boyfriend and my mother loved them.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a very tasty way to make eggplant.  Only 4 stars though, because as everyone else has said, "way too many breadcrumbs".  Since it's so hot in the summer I use the grill for this recipe.  I cut the eggplant in half, and grill it on each side for about 5 minutes while I'm cooking the onions, garlic, tomatoes, etc on the stovetop.  Then I scoop out the eggplant (which is much easier to scoop after cooking a few minutes) and mix the ingredients together with only 3/4 - 1 cup of breadcrumbs and put it back on the grill for 5-10 minutes or until done.  This works assuming you don't eat the shell like my family since it gets a bit charred by the end.  If you want to eat the outside, stick with the oven.  :D

Wonderfully flavorfull dish. I've made this for family gatherings and everyone loved it. I did make a few changes, only used half the bread crumbs, otherwise it overwhelms the dish. Also didn't have feta cheese handy, so used mozzarella cheese --great.

Great recipe to use up the eggplant in the garden.  The shell was not edible so making a casserole of this sounds like a great idea.  Also instread of the feta cheese I will try mozzarella next time.  One eggplant made enough for 2 meals for my husband and I.

Im not sure if its cuz of the bread crumbs, like other reviewers suggested, but this was not an enjoyable meal.  And it certainly wasn't worth all of the trouble that went along cooking it.  Perhaps trying cous-cous, to go along with the mediterranean theme.  That may make it much more tasty, since this was way too overpowered by the taste of bread crumbs.

Like others, I cut back on the bread crumbs, and used seasoned Italian ones. I don't know how many I did use because I just dumped them in, but it probably wasn't more than a cup, and it was a sufficient binder. However, mine probably needed less binder because I served it in a casserole, the first time for a dinner party where one of the guests was vegetarian, and it served as a side dish with chicken for everyone else. The second time I made it for my husband and me, and it was a miracle because he thinks he doesn't like eggplant. Well, I can tell 'ya, he liked this! Thanks so much for making my home an eggplant friendly zone! (I love the stuff.)

This recipe was great!  I read the reviews beforehand, so I made a few alterations.  First, I added some browned italian sausage, as my fiance isn't much of a veggie guy.  I also cut back the amount of bread crumbs by just slowly adding them until it looked thick enough.  I had gorgonzola cheese and cilantro on hand, so I used those instead of feta and parsley, and it came out great.  I also mixed the cheese in with the filling and topped it with some cheddar (would have used monterey jack or mozzerella, but that was all I had).

I think I would have prefered it without the extra cheese, but I do what I have to in order to get my fiance to eat his veggies.  I'm having some guests over soon, so I was thinking of making the filling part and stuffing some sourdough rolls with it.

I loved this.  It was a great way to serve eggplant.  I did add to it though.  I used yellow pepper, not green, and cut back on the breadcrumbs and oil.  I also had some lemon vinegar marinade in the fridge so I added a bit.  It really added a good flavor.  I did not have feta so I used parmesan and mixed it in.  I would also like to try adding italian ground sausage to it.  Very tasty!

I love this recipe; though I am constantly changing it. I have celiac so no breadcrumbs I add diced Yukon gold potato to the mixture in the pan, some grated Asiago some fresh oregano & thyme more garlic two cloves isn't even starter portion in my house. Occasionally I'll throw some kalamata olives on top when  I put it in the oven. Delish

recipe calls for  2 large eggplants, should give the yield needed from those eggplants, eg. how many cups needed. Also, way too much breadcrumbs, only needed about 4 oz. to sprinkle on top. As a grower of eggplants, I know they shouldn't be any bigger than  your outstretched  hand, many we see in grocery stores are too big  to enjoy the flavor.

What a great recipe for eggplant!  I was very happy with this, (although I admit, used Cheddar instead of Feta and also added some lamb  and Oregano)..... still, such a delicious dish!

How delicious can eggplant get? We loved this recipe, followed to the letter. Added more fresh parsley at serving time. Super summer meal, thanks for sharing the recipe!

The feta cheese did not melt, the dish texture was too dry and everything was overwhelmed by bread crumbs.

This would have been good without the bread crumbs at all I think. I halved the amount of breadcrumbs like the other reviewers had mentioned but it was still way too much. It made it mushy. None of my family ate it.

I made this stuffed eggplant twice.  The first time my husband and I enjoyed, however, we found that the eggplant "canoe"  was not cooked enough.  When making it the second time, I par boiled the "canoe" and it was much better. I also tweeked the bread crumbs and reduced to about 1 - 1 1/2 cups.  Since I did not have the cheese, I stirred in pecorino romano cheese ( about 1/4 cup).  Delish.  The recipe is so easy and I would recommend this very highly.  Enjoy

I made this tonight, I used panko breadcrumbs and the mixture was way too dry and bland because of the crumbs I used, so I added a 1/4 cup of lemon juice, some Thai basil and 1/4 cup of chardonnay and it was great.

Absolutely fabulous!  Quick, easy, simple ingredients.  I substituted canned diced tomatoes because I had no fresh ones and using the liquid made them moist and flavorful.  So glad I came across this recipe during Lent when we don't eat meat on Fridays.

I really liked this but made several modifications that made this extraordinary.  I added sautéed ground chicken to the mixture. I added one cube of chicken bouillon.  After this was added and mixed,  I put half the required mixture, then added the feta, then added the remaining mixture on top.  I finished it off with grated parmesan cheese on the top. Delicious.  Look for sheep feta vs cow.  It makes a huge difference.

I should have read the reviews like I usually do!!!  My husband and I agree that the taste is definitely ther but.....TOO MANY BREADCRUMBS!!! I knew as I was mixing it that it was too dry and going to be a problem.  Do yourself a favor and cut down the amount of breadcrumbs in this recipe.  I will definitely try it again using my instincts and tweaking it to my liking!

The flavor is better if you let it sit for a day.  Also you can take the "stuffing" and put it in a pita for a good sandwich.

We thought this was good however somewhat dry. I added salsa - next time I will use less breadcrumbs and egg substitute to give more moisture.

This recipe had too much breadcrumbs, it turned the mix into a cross between croutons and stuffing.  I don't think I'll make this again, if I do, I'll definitely tweak it a bit.

I was skeptical about this as I made it, and my husband was VERY skeptical when I served it.  But we were pleasantly surprised!  This is a wonderful recipe.  We followed advice of others and scaled back the bread crumbs (I just sprinkled some in until the texture seemed right) and used Italian crumbs and added dried oregano.  Oh, and used A LOT less oil! I think it would actually be better suited to a WINTER meal, though, as it is very filling.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband who "hates" eggplant, loved it. I felt the taste was overpowered by the taste of the breadcrumbs (I used whole wheat)...next time I will use less breadcrumbs and additional cheeses.

This ones a keeper, whether hot or chilled how can you beat it. I used all the breadcrumbs but shredded five cheeses instead of feta, & added a little hot sauce at the table. Maybe I'm a seagull but there was no shell left on my plate. Time consuming but worth it.

I did not think that this recipe was very good at all.  I followed it to a T and it was very dry, unflavorful, and underdone.  There were too many bread crumbs and 15-20 minutes is not enough.  not good at all!
