I had intended to make this exactly as written, which I usually do before making changes. I was out of a couple things so I did use Diced Tomatoes with Basil & Garlic, and used packaged Taco Seasoning instead of the Italian Seasoning.  This was almost to simple to be so good!  The chicken flavor was heavenly, moist & juicy. The leftovers made wonderful sandwiches.   I will be using this recipe a lot - probably again this week!

I was running late and just put in the tomatoes and garlic. I wasn't expecting anything amazing, but it was easy. After an epically horrible, terrible, no good very bad day, I came home to a condo smelling heavenly and a fabulous dinner.

This is the first recipe I've tried in my new slow cooker and it was delicious. The chicken breast was so tender, we didn't even need to use a knife!

Very tasty.  I cooked mine 1 hour on high and 3 hours on low.  You could cut the breasts with a fork.  Yummy!

Normally when I try a new recipe from here, I go with what's written and tweak it on subsequent makings.  This time around, I decided to experiment from the get-go.  We only had two chicken breasts, so I just went with it.  I used 3-4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 an onion (which I placed in the bottom of the slow cooker under the chicken) and a Tbsp. of Italian seasoning.  I also added 1.5 Tbsp. of aged balsamic vinegar which added a lot of depth of flavor.  Because there were only two chicken breasts, I opted for cooking for six hours.  This was too long a time for the amount of chicken we had and it came out a little dry.  I'll still be making it again as the sauce came out really well.  This recipe almost seems like it would be a good basis for Chicken Cacciatore, but I'll have to play with it some more.  Looking forward to making this again!

The chicken was tender but I didn't care for the taste. I didn't change a thing. Can't say I will make this again.

I made this recipe exactly as written and both my hubby and I thought it was quite bland. The reason I give it 4 stars is because I think with some tweaking, this could be great. The chicken was very tender and we loved that. I am going to add a lot more Italian seasoning next time and think that will do the trick along with some garlic which we believe helps most food.

Extremely easy to prep. I made a mistake and added a small can of diced tomatoes w/chili's. It was still real good but a lot hotter than my wife prefers. Fortunately the chicken itself wasn't hot. 
Will definitely do this again (without chili's).
I'm making this again. This time with Italian diced tomatoes and a frozen pepper and onion blend.

I made this over the weekend to save time cooking during the week. I followed the recipe but it turned out to very bland. I even added extra Italian seasoning as some reviewers suggested. Overall won't be making this again.

Although the Italian spices are optional, I highly recommend them. This a great dish for the hot days of summer. You don't want bake and even grilling can be brutal in the hot sun. I put it over brown rice and added zucchini. Made enough to freeze for another day too hot to cook.

I made this simple recipe but it just didn't sound that flavorful so I added the following: I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, some Worcestershire sauce, uncooked brown rice, an entire box of vegetable broth to compensate for the added rice, and 3 tablespoons stick butter set on top of mixture and allowed to seep though ingredients as they cooked. I will admit it turned out tasting a bit on the "rich" side but it sure was good! Sent in my husbands lunch the next day and he said he couldn't wait for lunchtime. Re-heats very well. Will make again it was so easy.

Made it almost exactly like the recipe. Just added some McCormick Roasted Garlic and Herb Seasoning to it in addition to the Italian Seasoning because I love that seasoning so much. It was absolutely delicious & the easiest recipe in the world to make. I have already recommended it to everyone I know almost.

I made this for the 1st time.  I adjusted the recipe after reading the reviews.  I added a box of Uncle Ben's Wild Rice after I mixed, 1 TLB of Apple Cider Vinegar, TSP of Red Pepper Flakes, TSP of Basil Flakes and 3/4 box of Ckichen Stock over 3 Chicken Breast, boneless and skinless.  I added 3 small Zucchini over the top and let steam for 1 1/2 hours.  pulledctge Zucchini out and shredded the chicken and mixed well.  served over the Zucchini. 

Should have added the box of wild rice about 1/2 war through the slow cooking time (2 1/2 hours).  The Rice was mushy.  Very tasty meal.....may try again.

I did make a couple changes as I didn't have all ingredients. Turned out very good.
