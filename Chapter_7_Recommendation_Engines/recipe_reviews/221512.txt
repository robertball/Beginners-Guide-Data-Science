Excellent. Changes...I used thighs and fried in pan with skin on. Removed thighs from pan and removed skin. Drain fat and add 2 TBLS butter and sauté onions and fresh mushrooms. Add in soup, wine and 1 cup chicken broth - return chicken to pan and simmer for 45 minutes.
PERFECT!

As I live in Japan, I had to substitute some of the ingredients because I couldn't get Marsala wine or the mushrooms.  I used "Akadama" which is a sweet red wine and I substituted "shitake" mushrooms for the cremini mushrooms.  I gave it 4 stars, but my partner, who is Japanese would give it 2.5 stars and the reason is that the first few bites are really delicious, but after that, the flavor is a bit "persistent".  (Japanese people, in general, prefer more delicate flavors...) I would definitely make this again.  It was quick and easy!  For the pasta, I used "fresh" fettucini pasta.

Very easy and very good.  I followed the recipe, sort of.  Two suggestions I picked up from other reviews were using the fat free cream of chicken soup and the ½ cup chicken broth and ½ cup of Marsala wine and I am glad I did.  I did dredge the chicken breast in flour mixed with the ground pepper and  ½ tsp. of garlic powder. Doubled the mushrooms using 8 ounces and also used a whole shallot chopped fine instead of the onion.  I browned the chicken separately , removed and set aside.  Then saute'd the  shallots, some fresh garlic minced and the mushrooms. Added the Marsala, chicken broth and chicken soup, blended well in the same skillet, brought to a light boil, turn down to simmer then returned chicken to the skillet.  Let it simmer about 5-6 minutes.  Perfect!  Chicken does not get over cooked this way.

This was an incredibly easy recipe and tasted great!  I added a bit of truffle oil with the mushrooms and needed to season the sauce a bit more with salt and pepper even after seasoning the chicken but it was great!

A wonderful and quick dish, just what I was looking for to use some pantry items.  I used fresh button mushrooms I had on hand.  Served with mashed potatoes.

This recipe was the most flavorful Chicken marsala I have made in a long time.It was so simple without having to dredge the chicken in flour but still able to aquire the taste I wanted.Use fat free cream of mushroom soup for less calories and it was just delicious.I will be making this again for sure.

It would have been too bland, but I gussied it up with a pinch of fresh rosemary and parsley, and added more salt and pepper.

Love the addition of cream of mushroom soup. My change was flouring the chicken before browning.  The sauce was very thick so I added beef broth as it cooked and I served it over white rice instead of pasta.  My guests loved it and they all asked for the recipe. Thank you!

Really liked this approach to a quicker version of chicken Marsala.  I would make two changes:
1.) A little less Marsala wine might make it better; it was a bit overwhelming using a full cup.   Next time I'll try 3/4 C.
2.) I added cooked peas while plating it.  This worked out very well.

My family loved this recipe! It is not chicken marsala, but it is reminiscent of those wonderful flavors enough, and so easy to make, that if you like chicken marsala I think you will be very pleased with this quickie alternative.

I put this over linguine, the creamy sauce working very well with the flat pasta. It was also quite delicious the next day as leftovers, easily warmed in a microwave.

Recipe calls for too much Marsala I feel it was very overpowering. To fix I added another half a can of cream of mushroom soup and some chicken stock and let it simmer. Next time I intend to half the amount of wine requested. Otherwise, very quick and tastey weekday meal! :)

Subbed a sweet red dessert wine for the marsala wine because I was too lazy to go to the grocery store!  Also added a healthy pinch of sriracha salt to give it a little more kick than the black pepper added (seriously...try this stuff).  Served over white rice with some garlic bread.  So easy, and so quick. Even the clean-up wasn't painful!

Quick, easy, and delicious chicken Marsala. I've made this dish using other cream sources such as mascarpone and mustard, but the cream of mushroom is simpler and works well with the fresh mushrooms in this recipe. I didn't have any fettuccine or rice on hand so I ate it with toasted hamburger buns. Delicious!

Very good! I coated with flour before browning. Other then that everything else the same. Served with masked potatoes. Favorite Marsala recipe! Gave it 4 stars I feel like it needs a kick of something. Next time I think I'll add some red pepper flakes.

Super easy one-pot dish. I used 99% fat free cream of mushroom soup, added rosemary flakes, substituted a cheap Merlot for the Marsala wine, and used sliced baby bella mushrooms instead of cremini. Served with rice and green beans (which were both cooked in the microwave, hence the one pot!)

It is hard to please everyone in my family but this recipe took care of all but one for dinner tonight. I tried other Marsala recipes but this one was a much bigger hit. Will definitely add to the rotation.

Super-easy take on Chicken Marsala...which is probably my family's favorite meal. I normally do one that is labor-intensive and this one is perfect for lending the marsala flavor when I don't have time to make my usual version. The only substitution I made was to use 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup marsala, and added a spring of rosemary while it simmered.Quick and yummy. I served over egg noodles. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy and so good!  Followed the recipe exactly except I let it simmer covered for about 45 minutes - steam built up under the lid and caused the sauce to be a little thin. Next time I'll either leave the lid off or vent it.  I served it over brown rice - my son said the leftovers where even better the next day. Will be making this one again!  Thanks for sharing!

Made this last might, my wife and I both liked it. I Didn't have Marsala wine on hand, I used Rhine wine instead. Other than that it was made as written. It's a keeper. In the future I might use cream of celery or cream of chicken soup.

This was good if you want to make a very quick and easy version of chicken Marsala. I was very appreciative of how little effort it took to throw it all together. However, I have found that the recipes that actually use heavy whipping cream in place of the cream of mushroom soup, as well as include some sherry as well taste absolutely amazing and give more quality flavor. I’ll definitely keep this around for something that can be made quickly.

This meal is absolutely delicious! I followed suggestions made by others. I used boneless chicken thighs and dredged them in flour before frying. I didn’t have any Marsala wine, so I used Sherry. Fresh rosemary, basil, garlic. You definitely need to add more seasoning to make it your own. Definitely will make again! Next time I will used fried pork chops!

I used a Cabernet and button mushrooms. It was delicious. I used breast meat and it came out a little dry. That is a chance you take when using breast meat. Next time I'll try thigh and leg meat.

Per a few other reviews, I added rosemary and parsley flakes - i do believe they really helped bring out some flavor.  No mushrooms b/c the hubs doesn't like them. Served over rice and it was delicious!

I liked this recipe. I substituted Publix baby bellas for the mushrooms and used low sodium cream of mushroom, which made the sauce a little runnier than I expected. I used some Wondra flour to thicken it a little bit and added some garlic powder.

I was doubtful, but it's delicious! I used regular mushrooms, diced garlic, no onions, and pino noir because that's all I had, and it worked out great. My kids (9,8,4) are devouring it, and it was so easy they helped me make it. I served it with mashed potatoes.

It was a great recipe but I did add sweet red and yellow peppers ,plus instead of cream of mushroom soup I used cream of chicken soup.  My family loved it!! Glad I stumbled upon it. :-)

I made this, but instead of a basic salt and pepper seasoning, I used emeril's essence mixed with 1/2 cup flour and dredged the chicken in that. It was crazy good. My picky 14-year-old had two helpings. I paired it with green beans almondine and roasted red potatoes.

Easy! Quick! Delicious! This is a keeper. I've made this a couple times. I've used both reduced fat cream of mushroom and regular. They both work fine. I've substituted whatever kind of mushroom I have on hand or on sale. Recipe is fine using less oil than listed. For a quick week night meal I serve it with our favorite instant mashed potato or instant mashed sweet potatoes.

made this recipe as written. Way too much marsala and chicken was very bland. Made it again with minor tweeking. I seasoned the chicken before browning and used 1/2 the Marsala. At the end I stirred in 1/2 cup sour cream. Served over fettucine..With changes it was much better.

I made half of this recipe, and we thought it was very good!  I served it over sticky rice for a very satisfying meal!  I would definitely make this again.  It was easy and tasty.  Thanks for this recipe!
