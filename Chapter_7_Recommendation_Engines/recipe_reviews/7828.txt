My version of this recipe was a hit! I used butter instead of oil in the cake and brown sugar instead of white sugar in the frosting. It definitely tasted homemade and everyone marveled at all the work I did to make it! ;)

My husband requested a German Chocolate Cake for his birthday.  I found this recipe and it was a hit!  The frosting takes quite a while to thicken so be prepared to stand by the stove and stir for at least 25 minutes.

This is a FABULOUS 'cheater' recipe!  I've made several homemade versions over the years (it's hubby's yearly birthday request), and this by far has gotten the best reviews.  This last time around I made just a few changes, and it was incredibly moist and got huge raves:  used the larger box of pudding, almost doubled the cocoa, subbed 1 1/2 cups of sour cream for the buttermilk and subbed melted butter for the oil.  It made for a really thick batter, so just makes sure to spread the batter around the pans evenly (otherwise you'll end up with lopsided cakes!).  Also a big fan of making this in a bundt pan and pouring the icing over top.  Thanks for sharing, it's definitely a keeper for us!

Our family being used to homemade cakes, were a bit disappointed. It is a boxed cake after all :-( Not very moist, not much taste. Quick'N'Easy if you are in a rush, but if you have the time stick with the original recipe. Minus the box, overall not bad, but not for a food snob

I thought that this cake and the frosting were excellent. Working full time, I'm not above taking an occassional shortcut, like using a jazzed up box mix. After comparing recipes for the frosting, I find that most are similar except that many only use 8 ounces of evaporated milk instead of the full can, which is 12 ounces, like this recipe calls for. I followed the recipe exactly until I got to the frosting. I then mixed only 8 ounces of evaporated milk in the pan with the other ingredients. With the rest of the evaporated milk, I added a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch and then mixed it in the bubbling frosting, insuring that it would be nice and thick. I then removed from heat, added vanilla, pecans and coconut.

This was absolutely the best German Chocolate Cake we have ever had.  My husband said it was better than his grandmother's and she was from Germany.  I doubled the frosting. It's worth the time it took to make.

This is a good recipe however Diane you should have noted that the batter is very thick.  I thought I had missed something.  Fortunately another reader noted it.  I did make a few changes, I used a german chocolate cake mix and I used chocolate pudding.  I used another german chocolate frosting on this site and it was wonderful.

The cake part turned out fine but the frosting was a mess.  I cooked it for at least 30 minutes and it would not thicken, then i tried adding corn starch which didn't work either.  I ended up going to the store and buying the frosting.  Definately will not make this again!!

This cake is a little more time consuming to make, but it has always turned out great for me.  I like to use chocolate instant pudding instead of vanilla, and I used 1/2 cup oil instead of 1/3 cup to make it a bit moister.  The batter will turn out incredibly thick and compact.  You'll have to spoon the batter into the cake pans instead of pouring.  For the topping, even though it seems to be runny while you are cooking it, don't worry, when it cools down and you add the nuts and coconut, the topping will thicken up enough.  Also after refrigerating the cake to make the topping set, I like to cover the sides with chocolate frosting using the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site.  That covers the sides nicely and makes for a beautiful cake!

This cake was a big hit with everyone at work! It is very rich and moist. I was able to reduce the calories from 681 to 510 per slice with substitutions (egg beaters, unsweetened applesauce for oil, I can't believe its not butter "free" for butter and PAM instead of greasing the sheets) The recipe is excellent.

This was good.  If you are in a pinch and need a quick cake and don't want to start from scratch.  I would recommend a cup of evaporated milk, not the full 12oz, and toasting the coconut & nuts before really opens up the flavor.

Made this two years in a row for both my husband's and dad's birthdays, since German Chocolate is their favorite.  I got rave reviews every time!  I did have to double the frosting though, to get a good coating.  I'm one of those who likes a LOT of frosting on my cake, though.  This one's a keeper, that's for sure!

The cake is easy and great, however, the frosting flavor is overpowered by the evaporated milk.

This cake was awesome!  I have never been a German Chocolate cake fan, but my brother wanted one for his birthday.  Everyone loved it.  The batter seems really thick when you mix it up, but it comes out wonderfully.  I would double the coconut/pecan topping.  It wasn't quite enough for a 1/4 sheet cake.  Great recipe.

Big hit for my boyfriend's birthday!  The frosting is perfect, and the cake has great flavor.  The cake is a bit dry though, so I'd suggest adding some apple sauce or sour cream before baking.

This cake it totally decent. Not extremely gourmet tasting, but if your on a budget it is really satisfying. I did not like that there was not enough icing to frost the sides of the cake, there was only enough for the layers. So I found a chocolate glaze recipe and drizzled that over the whole cake in a cross-hatch pattern. It still looked pretty, so I'm not too disappointed. The icing also took really long to thicken; I'm not even sure if it was the right consistency when I took it off the stove. Served it next to a big scoop of chocolate ganache gelato, fantastico!

I will start with what I was happy with - the frosting... but basically had to make a double recipe to hide the fact that the cake was so dry... i was very dissapointed with this recipe for the cake, it came out very dry and I followed the directions to a T... should have called for more butter or oil to give the cake a moist texture.

This turned out great! Very luscious and velvety. I froze the cake a week early and let it thaw for a few hours before serving. I made the frosting fresh.  With the frosting, I added 4 cups of coconut, because my husband likes it super thick and coco-nutty.

Excellent! Much easier to make than the from scratch version and just as tasty. I will definately make this cake again. I also took the advice of other reviewers and substituted butter for oil, brown sugar for white, and used a little less evaporated milk. Thanks Diane!

My husband loves German Chocolate Cake, and this one topped it for him!  He loved it, as well as everyone who ate it.  Very moist, frosting is exceptional, and easier than from scratch.  Stays good for a long time too.

This is a fantastic and easy recipe. I made it for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it. I was a bit discoraged with the drippy consistency of the icing once it was thickened because I wanted to ice the sides, but I found spooning icing on the top along the edge made a beautiful drizzle effect along the sides. I will probably make this again!

This has to be the thickest batters I have ever seen. Someone has left out some on the ingrediants! The icing didn't even cover the entire cake! Keep looking, in my opinion.

the cake turned out fine, but the frosting was like butter soup.  I followed the directions and there simply is no helping it.  I am now going to drag my two kids to the grocery store to purchase German Chocolate Frosting.

The cake is good- but it is mainly from a box.  And the icing was not good- tasted like a can of evaporate milk with eggs.  Not that appealing- I would use a different cocount-pecan icing with this for sure.

There aren't enough stars out there for this one! Oh, yummy, yummy.  The fact that the frosting is so simple to make, yet tastes so incredible, makes this a keeper in my book.  I will never buy canned coconut pecan frosting again.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe! *****

Thank you, Diane! This cake is fantastic!
It was my first try at a German Chocolate Cake and everyone loved it. It's now the favorite at my work also.  That topping/filling is just awesome!! I'd only ever had 'store-bought' and was amazed at the difference the homemade topping made.  WOW!

Baked cake for a 40th b-day party and it was a hit!  I had to mess with the frosting as the taste of evaporated milk was too strong, but in the end everyone thought the cake came from the bakery.

This recipe was a hit! The only thing I would like to add is, when you are cooking the evaporated milk, sugar, egg yolks, the recipe says cook til thick.  The issue was I didn't know how thick it had to be. I would suggest to cook until probably tomato paste thick.  I didn't cook it long enough.  If you encounter this issue, all I did was add more coconut and pecans.  Then I placed into the freezer for the cake to set.  When I removed from the freezer,  I was able to reapply the frosting in an upward fashion and it stuck to the sides of the cake like it should have.

I had a yellow cake mix and butterscotch pudding, so the cake did turn out a little orange, but still yummy.  It was a bit dry and crumbly though.  I used another recipe for the frosting because of a dairy allergy.

great cake!!! I was the first cake eaten!

I made this for my office and it was a true hit..  I did subsitute the oil for the butter as called for on the box and omitted the vanilla from the frosting and used 1/2 cup of sugar in the frosting.  also used french vanilla pudding in the cake mixture.  true hit and will keep using this!!!!

Amazing! I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday.  She now wants it every year. I was hesitant about the frosting, seeing others said it was too thin...just be paitent and keep stirring while heating it. A brilliant and easy recipe for such a complicated cake!!

I don't cook, and even I could make this! It came out VERY well. It wasn't the BEST German chocolate cake I've ever had, but it was very good! I thought it was simple to make (especially since I was busy cleaning, making other food), and the German chocolate cake connoisseur of the group loved it!

The actual cake recipe was very good.  However, I was very disappointed in the icing for the cake.  I cooked it for more than 30 min and it never thickened up.  I ended up throwing it away and getting the recipe for coconut/pecan frosting from my Better Homes and Garden cookbook.  I was done in 10 minutes and it turned out fantastic.

Excellent - both the cake and the frosting.  I would just reduce the amount a sugar in the frosting a bit - but that's just me.  Everyone else raved about it, and couldn't believe it was made from a cake mix.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except used 4 egg yolks instead of 3 because I had small eggs. The topping was a little runny so will add a little cornstarch next time.  But what a great flavored cake.

This turned out very well.  I think next time, I'll take the advice of other reviewers and use chocolate instead of vanilla pudding and maybe a little more oil in the cake.  The frosting took a LONG time to thicken but it was incredibly tasty when it did!  Definitely a keeper.

Cake was really good, I over cooked it so it was a little dry. The pecan frosting I used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar. It was delicious.

25 minutes seemed to be the magic number for thickening agents in the frosting to set... be patient and no corn starch will be needed. 
I wasn't a fan of using boxed cakes but it certainly cut down on a bit of time, next time I will be using a ChelSweets vanilla cake recipe.

I made this for my brother's birthday at his request.  I've never been a big fan of German chocolate cake.  But then all I've ever had was box mix and canned frosting. Yuck.  I followed the recipe except I used chocolate pudding.  I used a different frosting recipe on this site.  I wish I'd taken a photo. It was scrumptious.  Everyone that tasted it said it was the best they've eaten.  Thank you .
For people who have a difficult time using all of a carton of buttermilk before it goes bad, you can freeze it in ice trays and put the frozen cubes in a freezer bag.  It works great. Measure what your tray holds and mark the bag.

This is my go-to cake recipe. I use this for any flavor of cupcakes and get RAVE reviews. The only bad thing is that the cupcakes need to be made the day that you eat them. They get very dense if you have them the next day.

I thought I was making this wrong because the batter was so thick I couldn't even pour it in the pan... More like scoop and smear into it.  but, the cake turned out super yummy.  My husband agreed and he is not easy to please!

Cake and Icing turned out fine.  The only thing I changed was I used a chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding and no cocoa.  Icing takes at least 30 minutes of constant stirring on medium heat.

Delicious cake!  My guests loved it when I served it at my hubby's b'day party.  It was moist and very tasty.  The icing was a little difficult (which is why I'm only rating it 4 stars).  It took a long time to set and the egg whites cooked into chunks.  It was like having scrambled eggs inside the icing.  Gross.  I ended up straining the chunks of eggs out.  It worked out but it was pretty nasty.  I really just didn't like the thought of scrambled eggs in my icing.  I'm not sure why it happened that way.  Other than that, it was great!

I thought this recipe was fantastic!!! It worried me a little at the consistency of the batter for the cake but it baked up great and tasted even better. It took me about 25 minutes of stirring to get the icing to thicken and that turned out great also. My husband loved it for his birthday cake. I even made chocolate frosting and frosted the sides of the cake and make a little berm around the top to hold the german chocolate icing. I can't wait to make it again!!! Anyone can do this!!!

I just used the frosting recipe and have to say I was worried. I took it off the heat and added the final ingred., but it was soupy so, I put it in a big bowl and Microwaved it for and additional 5 minutes, stirring after each minute. It finally thickened up. I refrigerated it over night and it's great. Will probably find another recipe for icing some where else next time.

Frosting was great even though it took quite a long time to thicken (20-25 minutes). It did seem to thicken even more after cooling and adding the pecans and coconut. I used a 9x13" pan. It took about 30 minutes to cook. My only complaint was that the cake was a little dry tasting and not quite as rich as I was hoping.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I took the suggestions from so many other reviewers and reduced the evaporated milk down to 8 ounces. Even with this reduction, I still had a hard time getting the frosting to "thicken" while cooking it...and I cooked it for almost 40 minutes! However, once I added the coconut and pecans and let it cool COMPLETELY, then the frosting thicken up just fine. There was enough frosting to cover the cake top and middle, and then lightly on the sides...I did, however, use two 9-inch round cake pans instead of three 8-inch ones. The cake itself was wonderful and so easy to make...I'm usually a "from scratch" kind of gal. The only change to the cake I made was to use chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla. My whole family really liked this cake and want me to make it again.  With the reduction in the evaporated milk previously mentioned, it's a real keeper!

This cake is fluffy and delicious.  I used butter instead of vegetable oil, as another reviewer had recommended and it was just wonderful.  I used a different icing recipe from this site - just a little different than the one listed here.  I thought the cake would be really dense because the batter is really thick, but it is really light and fluffy.  It was a huge hit!

I'm not a big fan of German chocolate cakes, but my stepson requests them on his birthdays.  I must admit that this makes a wonderful chocolate cake!  I used a chocolate butter cake mix and chocolate pudding (I can never have too much chocolate).  I used store bought frosting, but I think I would use homemade next time because you get more bang for the buck.  You could use this cake with any type of frosting.  I will be using this cake recipe in the future!!!

This was a very easy, very good recipe. It was a hit at my husband's birthday party. The batter is VERY thick, but I spread it out with a spatula and it turned out very fluffy and moist. I decided to be easy on myself and buy the frosting rather than make it. I put plain chocolate frosting between the layers and regular German Chocolate coconut/pecan frosting on top and sides. It turned out very good. It was a good balance of homemade taste and easy store bought preparation. Next time, I'll try the homemade frosting!

this recipe went over great with my family as well as my boyfriend's. The only subsitute that I did was instead of making a coconut pecan frosting, I made a plain vanilla frosting and placed blackberries ontop. This made a nice contrast to the sweetness of the cake.

I made this cake for my father in law's birthday, which was on thanksgiving this year, and he LOVED it and so did the family.  It was a hit.  Thank you so much.

I have made many German Chocolate cakes and this is definitely one of the best!  So easy, flavorful and moist.
