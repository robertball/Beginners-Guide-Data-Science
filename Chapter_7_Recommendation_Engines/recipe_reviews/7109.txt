WOW!!! These are so yummy. I must say it's a very good recipe. Though I did a couple of things. First, my family doesn't care for currents so I omitted them. Secondly, I only formed into one dough into a large cirlce rather then what was called for. I cut it into 8 pieces. Finally, I brushed the tops with the remaining bit of buttermilk that I had and put regualar granulated sugar on the top. When they were done I made a glaze from 1c. Powedered Sugar, 2T. Real Maple Syrup and A little vanilla and maple extracts. Drizzled this on the cooled scones and it was amazing. They tasted just like the ones that the restaurant I used to work at served. I really must say these are great. I had used another and this recipe I was very happy with. The whole family ate them up. Thank you very much for haring this recipe.

These were really good, however, I thought that baking them at 425 deg. seemed high compared to a lot of other scone recipes I've seen, so (fortunately) I decided to bake them at 375 deg.
Even though I only baked them for 15 minutes, they were still overly brown on the bottom, and a few actually burned on the bottom.  My oven temperature is usually right on with recipes' baking temp. & time, so I was surprised that these were supposed to bake at 50 deg. higher than I baked them at, yet for the same time as I baked mine.  Next time, I'll decrease the baking time further (perhaps 12 or 13 minutes at 375). I used dried cranberries.  I was puzzled by the reference to "dried pears" in Step 4 of the recipe since they weren't mentioned as possible ingredients.

Very good!  My first scone-making experience and they turned out softer and more tender than ones I've bought from stores.  They were crunchy on top because of the sugar(I used the unprocessed natural sugar, so it was a lot more coarse, giving it a very pretty look!).  I replaced one cup of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  My food processor never got the mixture to look coarse or grainy, but more like very fine sand.  I love the subtle maple flavor.  The only thing I didn't love was the dried cherries...they tasted sort of like raisins after baking.  I tasted them before I put them in the batter, and they were good, so I would probably leave them out next time.

I loved this recipe!  I did not add the fruit.  I used a large scoop and did not roll out the dough.  I reduced the heat to 375 degrees F, because I did not roll them out, and cooked for 20 min.  I did not add anything to the top.  I used salted butter and omitted the extra salt.  Wonderful texture.  Will make many more times.  Would also be great with a maple glaze over the top.  Thank you for this recipe.

This was a very sticky and unmanagable dough even after adding extra flour to it, I would not use this recipe again.

Adding pecans or walnuts would make this similar to the old-style Starbuck's maple-oat scone that I loved so much!

I am not sure about the kids because they are in that picky stage, but I think these turned out great.  I substituted about 1 cup of chopped walnuts in place of the dried cherries.  These were terrific.  I am thinking of topping them with a maple glaze drizzled over them.

Scones turned out perfect with a wonderful maple flavor.  I used crasins in place of the dried cherries.  This is definitely a "keeper" that I will bake often.

I work in a commercial kitchen and used this recipe (I scooped it instead of rolling it out - very easy!) It was very nice. The maple flavoring is good and I used craisins instead of cherries. It would also be nice w/ apples...

These are yummy!  yes, the dough is very sticky, I ended up adding aboutt 1/3 flour to mine.  But the trick really is to make sure you turn it out on a well floured surface and sprinkle it liberally with flour before trying to roll or press it out.    When cutting them, I also found it helpful to dip my knife in flour between each cut.    These are definitely worth making!  They are wonderful with Apple Butter!

Wow! These scones are amazing! I'm not sure what it is, but they have this "taste" to them that is totally amazing! Perhaps it is the unsalted butter...or maybe the maple extract? Whatever it was, these scones smelled heavenly while they were baking and taste even better! I didn't have any cherries, so I used sweetened dried cranberries instead. I will be making them again, and might substitute chopped pecans for the dried cherries. Oatmeal Maple Pecan scones; what can top that?!

These are simply perfect. I had to add just a bit more buttermilk to make the dough workable (no more than a tablespoon or so), and I didn't have maple flavoring, so I left it out.  Will definitely make again.

These turned out light and delicious. The maple flavoring is subtle. When kneading and forming them, they were a sticky mess to handle. I just added more flour and persevered in getting them on the parchment paper. They baked up beautifully. To enjoy them the next day, I just zap them in the microwave for a few seconds to warm them up.

I added dried apricots and apples instead. To me, these were just okay. I prefer Starbucks scones! This dough was really, really sticky and I thought they would have a more buttery taste. I didn't have maple flavoring, so I added extra vanilla. Maybe that had something to do with it. I decided to chill the dough after putting it together and I was able to handle it better, otherwise it stuck to my hands and was impossible to knead.

These were my first attempt at scones - they were delicious!  The maple flavour was there, but not terribly strong so they weren't overly sweet.  I'm a huge maple fan and these totally hit the spot and they weren't hard to make! (I thought scones were hard to make!)  I left out the cherries because I wasn't sure about them, a walnut or another type of nut would go well with this.  This pairs well with the Christmas Brunch Casserole.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

These scones melt in your mouth.  I used fresh maple syrup and dried cranberries. The recipe is large enough that you can freeze some for later.

I'll bet this would be good with nuts.  The dried cherries are so tasty, but the maple flavour barely comes through.  Have to play with that a bit.

I love this recipe. I didn't have any maple extract so I just added more maple syrup. I used dried cranberries instead of cherries and I pressed the dough into a muffin pan. It still turned out really really good!

Love love love this recipe.  It is fantastic.  We always have to have it on hand now.  I bake them weekly!  I usually make them per recipe, but I recently made them with blueberries.  I eliminated the maple extract andI substitued karo light corn syrup for the maple.  They turned out great.  This really is a can't miss...

This was an easy recipe to follow and the results were excellent. I used cherry-flavored dried cranberries and they were yummy. The went over so well that I had to make another batch the next day. Bakery Quality with an authentic scone texture. :)

Awesome! The pregnant ladies in my bible study loved these! The only alterations I made were due to lack of ingredients on my end: regular syrup for maple syrup, almond extract for maple extract, cranberries & raisins for cherries...
I also turned my heat down to 375 (like ya'll said) and put them in for 15 minutes.

Very good with walnuts!  The texture/crumb strays a little from the classic scone; nontheless We really liked it.

I don't know what I did wrong but the batter was ridiculously runny. I had to add a lot of flour to get them into any sort of scone shape. The recipe sounded so good but the end result falls short. They were just so-so and too much work for something so-so.

I do not have a food process or but it mixed up just fine without one.  I also substituted the dried cherries with dried cherry flavored cranberries (a lot less expensive).  I used raw sugar for the tops instead of plain white sugar.  These were a real hit with my family and co-workers.  I will definitely make these again.

This was great!  I didn't add the cherries, and it still turned out well.  The scones have a crunchy outside with a faint maple flavor.  I used margarine instead of butter and added a little more maple syrup.

I thought this recipe was sensational. I didn't use the dried cherries, and I substituted rum extract for the maple. A combination of regular butter and margarine worked nicely for substitution of the unsalted butter.  Skipped topping and served with Devon Cream. Delicious!!

These are excellent!  I omitted the cherries just out of personal preference and used vinegar and milk in place of the buttermilk.  I baked them at 400 degrees and topped them with a maple glaze instead of the sugar.  For glaze: melt 2 Tbsp butter and 1/4 c maple syrup in a saucepan over medium heat.  Whisk in 1 c powdered sugar and immediately top cooled scones.

I've been trying to find a great scone recipe because DH loves them.  Decided to try this one and I am so glad I did.  So is he!  Made as written except for throwing in a small amount of chopped nuts, and I used the quick oats I already had on hand. I cut the recipe in half, so I made two 7-8 inch circles.  The scones were smaller, and I only needed to cook for 13 mins. Not a lot of maple flavor, but the cherries definitely come through.  I think cranberries or blueberries would work nicely too.

Thought these tasted ever better the day after.  Used Truvia for the tops to sweeten, and substituted 1 of the cups of flour for whole wheat.  Also used Sugar-free syrup.  Yummy!  :)

Nice.  The syrup flavor is great, even without the extract.  I tried another reviewers trick and brushed on buttermilk instead of egg white.  Worked great and saves an egg.  Thanks!

These were great!  I used dried blueberries in place of the dried cherries, as I'm a big fan of maple and blueberry flavors together, and it worked perfectly.  I did not use a food processor and the dough came together quickly - the trick is not to handle too much, just pat together and lightly press into circles before cutting.  We ate these plain - out of the oven they were so moist they didn't need anything else, but I wonder how they would go with some sort of maple infused cream.  I'm sure I'll try it some day, as this is certain to become one of my regulars.  Thanks for sharing!

These scones are amazing!  I made them this evening, as a surprise for my mom (she loves scones, as well as maple, so I figured it would be fitting), and even I was impressed by them (I'm usually very self-critical of my cooking!).  I didn't have any dried cherries, so I used cherry-flavored dried cranberries, and I added some pecans, since my mom likes nuts.  It was a great addition.  Walnuts would have been good, as well.  Overall, a real winner.  They were easy to make, and turned out really well!

Great scones.  I have baked them for many special occasions, and people can't help but eat more than one.  I did use chocolate chips rather than berries.

I used dried blueberries instead of cherries and these turned out fabulous.  Everyone kept asking me where I bought them.  I had never made scones before, so I was a little nervous, but they turned out great.

Bingo! Great recipe. Instead of dried (and reconstituted) cherries, I used a mix of raisins, craisins, and chopped dates (not reconstituted) because that's what I had on hand; and for the same reason, I used plain greek yogurt, thinned with two tablespoons of milk, instead of buttermilk. I hate to waste anything, so I threw the second egg yolk into the mix, saving the white of that one for the "glaze." I added a little extra flour when patting into the "round" to compensate for the extra liquid. Sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. YUMMMMM!

Wonderful texture and very present flavor, but I don't really detect any maple in them, which is normal because maple is delicate and needs to be used in high quantities to achieve a subtle hint of it at all.  But good otherwise.

I served these for Christmas brunch and everyone really loved them.  However, I think next time I will use more maple to give it more flavor.  They need a little more punch, but I enjoy big flavors.  I also used craisins instead of the dried cherries for cost effectiveness.  I thought they were a nice compliment to the maple.

I love scones and since I had dried cherries on hand I gave this recipe a try.  Makes a good scone, don't know how a previous user said you can't taste the cherries.  I didn't have real maple syrup or maple extract so I just used three tablespoons of my "maple flavored" syrup.  Still turned out good, but with just a hint of maple.  Not as dense as your usual scone, but good just the same.

Great recipe. I made the recipe as is just used yogurt in place of buttermilk, and used whole wheat flour for one of the cups of flour. And raisins for the cherrys. It was of perfect texture, not too sweet but sweet enough. Mixture was dry at first, just had to knead it a bit.

Was really surprised to not be impressed with these after reading the reviews.  The softness of the dough was off-putting, and I found the flavor rather average, though I followed all instructions to the letter.  Sorry, won't be making again.

This dough was a perfect consistency, not too dry not too moist.  It was so very flakey and so good out of the oven!  I made it the night before for a breakfast buffet at work, and they were still light and flakey!

Good flavor, but the dough was sticky and unworkable.  I ended up just smashing a glob of it between parchment paper into a circle and baking it that way.  I doubt I'll make this again, but I've got a couple new flavoring ideas to try with my favorite scone recipe.

Couldn't taste the cherries and probably wont bother with them next time, but otherwise they were awesome! My Dad loves Maple so I made them for his birthday, he didn't even know what a scone was! He was very impressed, he loved them. Thanx for the great recipie.

We loved this recipe! The scones are moister than most scones, and the maple adds a nice touch. My husband and father-in-law don't like fruits in bread, so I didn't add those.

So good!! This was my first time baking scones, and I was a little nervous, but it turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly except for the cherries. Some people said to add cranberries or other dried fruit but I decided to leave them plain. I left them in the oven 2 minutes longer then I should have so the bottom of some scones burned a bit, but that’s my fault, haha ??. Light maple flavor with buttery undertones, amas mg with jam. Stop reading this already and make these!!

This recipe made an exceptional scone, light and moist with wonderful maple flavor .  The dough is wetter than usual, so have plenty of flour on hand for rolling out and scoring the dough.

One of my favorite scone recipes, and always a hit with friends and family. (I did need to reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees, so if your parchment paper is thin, maybe watch your oven settings.)

These are spectacular!  I used Craisins instead of dried cherries because that's what I have on hand.  The scones are soft and fluffy and very tasty.

Bites with the fruit were good, but the bites without were plain/dry. I would add more fruit or pecans.  It was nice however that they were too sweet.

Easy recipe and a great result. I made a maple glaze in place of the sugar on top. The dried cherries give a nice burst of flavor.

Served them to my English Friends and they loved them.  Asked for the recipe.  Made them exactly as described except \I didn't have the dried cherries so used dried cranberries instead.  Easy and full of maple flavour.  Will make them again.

Tender and flavorful. Because I didn't have maple flavoring, I used brown sugar for about a third of the sugar. For larger scones, I just patted the dough into one circle and cut into 8 wedges. Yum!

These were good, I would have liked more maple falovour though. I added peacans and raw sugar for the top. I didn't have time for a maple drizzle, but that would have been good too....next time!

Fantastic!  Love these scones.  Delicious, subtle maple flavour.  Easy to make.  My whole family loved them.
