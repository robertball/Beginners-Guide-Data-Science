I used feedback from previous reviewer and skipped the tbsp of salt, turned out great. Just a hint of sweetness from the honey to counter the garlic - loved it. I shook some sea salt on the pita and a little on the hummous after it was in the serving dish. Used dried rosemary instead of fresh, and chickpeas instead of garbanzo. Also sprinkled pita and hummous with paprika for presentation. Excellent 5 minute appetizer. Will be making it again.

This hummus is fabulous. I've been trying to find a perfect hummus recipe and the search is over.  I drizzled 2 tbsp olive oil into the hummus while it was food processing to incorporate it.  Next time I will use slightly less salt.  LOVED IT!!

I must say that this is the best hummus recipe I have found.  I like to use roasted garlic instead of regular garlic.  This recipe also provides a great base for adding all sorts of different ingredients.  I sometimes add roasted red peppers or whatever is fresh out of my garden.

This is GREAT hummus! So very easy... took me less than 10 minutes to make. I added a little turmeric and cumin for more flavor. Will definitely make againa and again!

I ended up mixing this up with another recipe! I did 1/3 Cup tahini and then added to taste as I went. Used 3 tsp low sodium soy sauce and only 1 gigantic clove of Elephant garlic, the juice of one lemon and added olive oil until I got the consistency I like. The honey was an excellent touch. I am going to use this as my 'base' as I begin to experiment with roasted peppers and ancho chilis.

Ok, so this is really good and a little spicy from the garlic!  I didn't have tahini in the house but really wanted some hummus, so I substituted it with 1 tsp. of no sugar peanut butter...OMG...it is so good!  Thanks for the recipe!

This hummus is exceptionally good - better than any of the prepackaged brands.  I did make some changes according to previous reviews - I cut the salt in half and added a little cumin and a little red pepper flakes.  Next time I will cut the honey in 1/2.  It was a little sweet for me (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) but I wouldn't take it out entirely, it definitely blends well with the other flavors.  I also added an extra clove of garlic and didn't use any oil.

This recipe worked well but I completely left out the salt, I would taste it before I added any at all as the tahini is salty. I left out the rosemary but added in some chopped artichokes and black olives, a little seasoneed salt and olive oil over the top, add an olive in the middle and it looks (and tastes) like something you ordered in a restaurant. YUM!

I was intrigued by the ingredients, but they did not go well together.  Much too salty.

OMG!  So good I was transported back to Jerusalem in 1979 eating this on a restaurant patio.  Based on the recommendations I cut the salt in half and I'm glad I did; it was perfect.  Thank you, thank you, for this recipe!  We've already made it 3 times and have received rave reviews.  If you've tried "store-bought" hummus and thought it was yucky, yes, it was!  Try this recipe; it's easy and absolutely delicious.

It is way too salty. I had to double the recipe and leave out the salt the second time to balance the taste. The other ingredients are fine.
I added 2 strips of roasted red peppers.
The next time I will only use one teaspoon of salt.

This was delicious. I brought it to a work potluck and everybody loved it. I couldn't find the Tahini in the store so that ingredient was missing. I'll put it in next time to know how it is :)

Used less salt, more garlic and some chili powder.  So yummy - had to force myself to back away from the hummus after downing half a bag of tortilla chips and most of the hummus.

I made this for a vegan friend of mine last week.  I have to say that I made a few other things as well, but it was this dish that everyone (meat eaters tool) went for and gobbled up!  Thank goodness I had made a mistake in my calculations and added double EVOO and was forced to double the entire batch because I would have run out of it very early into the evening!  A word to the wise...MAKE more than you think you'll need!  This one is a keeper!

I love, love, love authentic hummus!  But this recipe for hummus was too salty!  I didn't care for the honey either.  Skip the honey and use a lot less coaser salt.  I also really like garlic! But not this much fresh uncooked garlic. I think it would have been better with less.  I actually could not eat the hummus after using this recipe.  If you tweek the recipe it will be much better.  Less is always best!

This was great hummus but I did have to add a lot more seasonings to make mine not so bland. Chili pepper works great in this recipe.

Good recipe, but beware the salt.  I did a half tsp and this was perfect for me.  Also, I had no honey and so skippe d this, and this was fine.  Also I used sesame oil instead of the tahini.  Not having pita bread we had the humus with corn tortillas toasted lightly on the stovetop (I am living in Mexico).  I said to my Mexican wife:  This is exactly how it should be!

This hummus was really good.  I liked the added sweetness with the honey.  I'll definitely will be making this one again.

(However, I did not make the pita portion of this recipe.  I had loads of leftover crackers and chips and was looking for a dip.  This was great!)

I really like how this turned out.  I modified this a little...I did not add the water or salt.  I did add: drizzle of soy sauce, sprinkle of cumin, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, yellow pepper, and dried red pepper seed for a little zip. I have been struggling for just the right recipe and I think I have finally found the combination for me...hope you enjoy!

Since I'm making my second batch in less than 24 hours, I guess I have to give this 5 stars! :-) Like others, I used only 1t of salt, and think that's plenty.  I was skeptical about the honey, but find that it really brings out the flavor of the tahini.  Give it a shot!

Yum, yum! I'm chowing it down on toast as I type.   Made without rosemary but please do not eliminate tahini as that really gives the huumous the flavour it demands. I also left out oil as I amusing it as sandwich spread.

i did not read the reviews before i made this, so it turned out REALLY salty. i added in more of the other ingredients to balance it out, and it was pretty good.  also, there is a discrepancy between the ingredients and the directions.  the ingredients include tahini, but the directions never say to add it.  this could be where all the extra salt is comming from...

I liked this recipe - it was super easy and tastes great.  I added a little cumin, sesame seeds, pepper, rosemary, olive oil and sesame oil(next time I'll just put in 1/8 tsp)right to the mixture.  I also left out the garlic and the salt.

very yummy and easy.  I was out of tahini so I used a 3 small table spoons of peanut butter and a few drops of sesame oil and a teasspoon of sesame seeds instead.  It turned out very well.  A sprinkling of paprika is nice as well.  thanks!

Lovely, easy recipe. I rinsed the chickpeas, didn't have enough tahini, so milled sesame seeds (1 cup), used less salt, and only one teaspoon of maple syrup, also added lemon zest. It was lovely. I used Olive Oil in the mix too and homemade vegetable concentrated stock. I think the little sweetness takes away the sometimes sharp taste of uncooked garlic.

I thought this humus was okay. The garlic was strong - even though I reduced the quantity the recipe listed. I may have simply had a particularly strong head of garlic. It does vary.  I also agree with a previous review that the honey made it too sweet. I had to add a good bit more lemon juice to try to cut the sweetness. If you want to add the honey, I would suggest you reduce it by 1/3, taste and add more if needed.

This is our favorite traditional hummus recipe so far.  We are making it over and over again to have as a snack at work or at home.  If you are skipping the Tahini paste you really need to take some time to go and find it.  I get mine at Cost Plus World Market.  Buy and extra jar while you are there so you have a spare in the pantry.

I've read that hummas may be the the most perfect food.  After making and consuming this recipe, I agree.  It is a wonderful and quick recipe using ingredients I had in the pantry.  I'll make this again, for sure.  I'll likely cut down on the salt (as per other reviewers) and maybe a bit on the lemon juice.  Thanks, Robin, for sharing!

This was absolutely fantastic! The best I have ever had! I doubled the recipe, added a little more garlic and 1/2 cup of pre-made pesto to the mix. Wow! I also topped it off with Pine nuts and a spoonful of the Pesto for decoration and flair! Great and easy!

WOW!  This is fantastic!!  I wasn't in a rosemary mood so I omitted it and by accident I forgot to put in the lemon but it was still outstanding!  My husband is not a hummus fan and he told me it was really good.  Thanks for the recipe!  BTW, the garbanzo beans I had - the can was 14.5oz and it was still awesome.

I've been making this hummus regularly for a few years. Sometimes I add a little of this or that (more lemon or honey), or take away a little, but Robin's ingredients here are perfect. My family thinks this is the best and now they can't stomach the store-bought or even this recipe without all the ingredients.

Not Bad! I tried this, my very first attempt at humus ever and...the family says not garlicy enough. So like the nerd I am...i kept adding cloves of garlic and ummmm went a little overboard! So my advice for anyone novice such as myself, STOP adding garlic after the 5th clove! I think I added 10 and it's a little painfulLet it sit and then see if you need more garlic! And yes it was fixable, added more bean and lemon juice till it worked out.

This is a great recipe!  I always get comments on it when I serve it at a party.   Try adding a touch of cumin for some depth!

If you like the taste of honey, this is for you, because that's all you'l taste. This sat on my appetizer table untouched after the first taste. I had one compliment, but I figured out she was just trying to be nice.

I added more honey and no salt.  I thought it would of been really good with only one clove of garlic. I love garlic but 3 cloves was to much.
