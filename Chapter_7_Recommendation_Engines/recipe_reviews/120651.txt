This is great and my kids really loved it.  I used a bundt pan, so that solves the raw in the middle problem...no middle:-)

I've made this breakfast bread for more than 15 years.  The last time I made it the center was not completely baked.  I would agree with the other post, maybe they're making the cans bigger.  I always get requests for the recipe and it's ALWAYS the first to go.

Pretty easy and not bad.  I had biscuit mix that I'd forgot about, so I used that instead of storebought biscuits--don't have them anyway.  I just mixed up the biscuits, patted them flat and cut up into smaller pieces.  They were a bit sticky, so a few stuck together while mixing but no matter.  I added garlic and didn't use pepper--don't have it.  I just melted the butter in the pan with the onion and garlic--go ahead and call me lazy, you'd be correct--which worked just fine.  I baked in a bundt pan for the full amount of time and they worked well.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  I made this to go along with potato soup and it was perfect.  I did omit the green pepper for personal preference, well actually the guys' preference, but I think it would be delicious with it also.  Mine did take quite a bit longer to cook, but that could have just been my oven.  Next time, I will cut down the recipe, just because it makes quite a bit, even though the leftovers were just as good.  Thanks for sharing!

Our tradition on Christmas morning is to make this YUMMY bread, drink Mimosas and open presents! One year the dog ate half while we were opening presents! Whoops!  I don't use the green pepper, but that's just because my sister doesn't like them. And I always use a Bundt pan. Awesome recipe. I couldn't find mine and tg found the same one here. Thanks.

I made this for the girls at work for a breakfast, and everyone loved it. I did have to cook it about 40 minutes, but it browned beautifully and was delicious! I made it in a bundt pan and it turned out perfectly. Great recipe! I've had to make a dozen copies!

This was so easy and delicious.  I cut back a bit on the bacon and added just a little more of the onion and peppers.  I will be making this again!!

Very yummy! I used turkey bacon. Can also be made with bread dough & mozzarella cheese. I baked it for 40 minutes.

The middle was completely raw! At first I thought it was the cheese because I used white cheddar but upon closer inspection it was the biscuits. If I were to make this again I would only use 2 cans of biscuits to ensure they bake through.

I didn't have enough biscuits but made it anyway.  It was very quick and easy to prepare while making other breakfast foods to go with it.  The bread was a  little on the greasy side due to the cheese and butter and maybe because I used less biscuits than called for but still very tastey.
