Being of Lebanese decent, I have had this all of my life.  I often add some or all of the following flavorings:  fresh, mashed or roasted mashed garlic, an envelope of Ranch dip powder, fresh herbs, scallions and minced sun-dried tomatoes.  I also use non-fat yogurt for a healthy snack.

Labneh is awesome, and this recipe is no exception, and simple enough to make.  I prefer making my own yogurt and then straining it through the cheesecloth.  I then shape the labneh into 2-inch balls and store in a jar with olive oil.  Alternately, I store the labneh in a separate container and add the olive oil at serving time.

I didn't have any cheesecloth on hand, so I used a plain white, clean, handkerchief.  The recipe came out wonderful, I added some minced garlic and olives and used it as a spread for pitas with hummus.

This is a great recipe, and a lot of fun to play with. I didn't have a cheesecloth the first time I tried it, so I just used some paper towels, and it was still good. I also didn't want 4 lbs, so I cut in down: 4 cups (one 32 oz/2 lb container yogurt), 1/4 tsp salt, and 1 T olive oil. One night, I made fajitas and didn't have sour cream- my family and i tried this and it was perfect! This is versatile and so easy.

We loved this! Be sure to use plain yogurt with no added thickeners (ie: geletin, corn starch). We served this spread on a plate, drizzled with EVOO and sprinkled with greek herb mix. Scoop up with pita triangles or crunchy vegies! Also spread in pita pockets with falafel fillings.

This recipe is great.  It has a delicious flavor and is healthy!  I let the yogurt strain for another day because it didn't quite have the taste I was looking for after only 24 hours.

I made this with homemade yogurt.  It is delicious!  Next time I might let it sit longer, some in the middle didn't seem to drain quite as well as the rest.  I only made 1/4 recipe, that worked out to be a good amount for our family.  I'm really happy I tried this recipe, thank you for sharing it.

I have made this my whole life - it's a good recipe.  I have rarely added the olive oil into the cheese, but it's a nice idea.  For the reviewer who found this was not a cream cheese consistency, it can be thicker if you allow it to drain longer.  I also use clean nylon stockings to let it drain - I use 2 layers of knee high stockings and pour the yogurt in and let it hang over my kitchen faucet over night.  It's usually a nice thick consistency in the morning.  I now plan to drizzle the olive oil over it and the chopped vegetables and use it as an appetizer - thanks for a new and improved recipe!

This can also be made flavored with herbs. I usually add a little garlic and fresh mint to the recipe, like they do at my favorite middle eastern restaurant.

Labneh is simple, versatile and great!
i buy unbleached muslin cloth from the local fabric store. much more cost effective (and traditional). 
i form a bag around the mixture and secure with twine and hang over a bowl in the fridge for at least 24 hours... i usually go longer to get a firmer result then roll into balls and let them sit on paper towels to draw out a little more moisture.
and store some in jars with evoo...but just plain is great too.

Talk about easy. Makes a sour cheese that you could season in a variety of ways in my opinion. I plan on making Naan to scoop this up with.

Wonderful recipe!  First time making it or eating it.  I let mine drain in the fridge for about 30 hours to get it to a nice, cream cheese consistency and then I grated a bit of garlic into it, added chives and some salt (didn't salt it before) and it is fantastic.  Used cheese cloth because I had it on hand.  I can see this being very versatile and I can't wait to try it again.

It's a lot easier to use one a reusable coffee machine filters.  Or even a reusable single cup coffee filter that sits on a cup.  I have one that's a very fine white plastic screen, $4 at my local supermarket, and the coffee cup one has some sort of very fine gold screen at the bottom (bought ages ago; I don't remember how much I paid for it).

loved it! except i wasnt a huge fan of the olive oil at the end. would've rather just stuck with a dash of lemon pepper and salt as a finishing touch. also, i drained the yogurt about 1.5-2 days to ensure full creaminess.

Just served this at a cookout.  It got rave reviews.  Everyone was impressed with how easy it was to make.  Suggestions for next time include adding: rosemary, green onions, chives, garlic, and chili pepper.  I made this as the reciped called.  There were 15 people, and the bowl was wiped clean with pita bread.

Oh ye gods this was delightful!  I had some yogurt that needed to be used up, so I made a batch of Piadina Romagnola flatbread and used the remaining 2 cups to make a scaled down version of this.  I wanted to use for dinner, so I squeezed out as much liquid as I could, then put a heavy can on top to press out adt'l liquid.  Only able to let is sit for about 12 hours.  Cream cheese with an attitude!  Wonderful bite - can't wait to remake and allow to sit the entire 24 hrs.

Good recipe or labneh.  Tastes great as suggested with tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, olive oil, salt and pepper and a sprinkling of mint or sumac.

Wonderful! I have a friend from Lebanon that begged me to make this for a long time. When I made it exactly as the recipe said, he went insane and said it was the best. I made it with my own homemade yogurt.  Thank you for posting this.

I make this quite often and love it.  I use Greek Yogurt when I make mine.  Sometimes I just eat it plain and sometimes I add things to it, just depends on my mood at the time, ha!  I use a Cuisipro Donvier Yogurt Cheese Maker to make mine, you can find them on Amazon, just makes the whole process a bit neater.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Novice Cheese Maker - Follower for Life :)
I used the recipe to make our fav 7 Layer Mexican Dip after buying a bulk of yogurt on sale.  I combined it with caramelized onions before adding to dip - BINGO! No leftovers and everyone kept asking me what I had done differently.  I said coyly "Nuthin" buhahahahaha-my secret!  There were no leftovers for me to worry about, so I am wondering how long can this be refrigerated for on it's own? Thanks for sharing, you have a winner with this!

So how does one stir in such a tiny amount of salt to so much yogurt?  Will that small amount make any difference?  How much sugar is in all this recipe?

This recipe is simple and easy, and labneh is a great gateway food to turn people an to middle eastern cuisine and flavors (cooks and diners alike).   I sometimes let the labneh drain for more than a day, up to 36 hours.  I like to serve it with oil and zaatar, or sometimes just salt and pepper.

Fantastic. I use and sell Isagenix. Always looking for healthy alternatives.  Thievish fantastic. I put it on tortillas with a depot of honey.
