Hubs requested baked beans with our BBQ rib dinner and I wanted to try someting new.  He was not enthused about this recipe at all. I admit I was skeptical myself but I love to experiment and I've often been pleasantly surprised when I do.  I thought the picante sauce (I used salsa, and a different brand) weird, and even more so combined with spicy brown mustard. In my mind it was an incompatible combo. But it worked.  Ohhh, did it work!  I gave Hubs a spoonful to taste and the look on his face told me right away he was pleased.  "These are pretty d*mn good!" he said.  Oh my, these are unlike any baked beans I've ever had.  Uniquely delicious.  Instead of vegetable oil I sauteed some sliced bacon, then cooked the onion with it and the drippings.  I can only believe the bacon took this already incredibly delicious recipe over the top.

Most excellent. Use the whole small jar of Picante Sauce, medium. And 1 clove garlic. Best beans I've had. I just dumped the black beans in.

It's tough to decide how to rate a recipe when there are obvious problems with measurements, etc. This is one of those recipes. I liked the idea of adding the picante sauce but the recipe calls for just two 15 oz. cans of beans which is clearly not enough to make 6 servings. I used a 28 oz. can of pork and beans, a 15 oz. can of black beans and added in a 15 oz. can of pinto beans. I didn't have any spicy brown mustard on hand so just used yellow mustard and added 1 tsp. of chili powder to spice it up. An entire onion would be far too much so just eyeball it. I used about half. I used the medium Pace picante sauce and reduced it to 3/4 cup. It gave it just a touch of heat, not too much. With these changes these were so good!  Great summer BBQ dish. Check custom recipes if you'd like to see my changes.

Sorry didn't do it for our family.....followed the recipe but added another can of pork & beans and another can of black beans.  Oh well you don't really know until you try a recipe....we tried and not our favorite.
