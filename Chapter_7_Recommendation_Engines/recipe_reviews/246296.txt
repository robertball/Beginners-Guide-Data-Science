This turned out really good. As mentioned in the footnotes, I used chicken broth and anchovy paste. The one change I knew I had to make to suit our taste was in the preparation of the steaks. We are a grilled steak kind of people and so I grilled them rather than pan fry. With that being said, regardless of how you prepare the steaks themselves, I do think they needed some seasoning. The sauce has good flavor but it wasn't quite enough. I tested this by preparing one plain as the recipe stated to do and on the other one I sprinkled some Cavenders. The one with the Cavenders was hands down better than the other. The sauce had really good flavor but keep in mind that it is a very thin sauce. Overall this is a good recipe and one that would impress guests.

Excellent recipe....we loved the sauce! Didnâ€™t have chervil or anchovies so left those out and still came out very good. Thank you for sharing!
