1. I only give it 4 stars because I made changes and I can't really rate the recipe as written. Rinsed the chickpeas and left them to dry for an hour in the strainer. Used taco seasoning. Oven toasted and DELIC! Used as a topping for taco salad (and eaten by the spoonful by more than one person at the table!). As Buckwheat Queen commented, they *are* crunchy gems! Defiantly a keeper! 2. Today's batch is seasoned with Old Bay, and we ate them after our workout, so as not to undo all our hard work with chips! =)

Spicy little crunchy gems. Yum!! After rinsing the chickpeas, I allowed them to dry for half an hour on paper towel. I think this helped in making them super crispy. Awesome snack recipe.Leftovers go great in salads!!  Thank you for sharing it with us.

Ellie! These are SO GOOD! Went together quickly with some pantry staples - my kind of recipe. Crunchy. Seasoned well. Taste divine. Since my oven is a temperamental thing, my chickpeas needed to cook for 42-ish minutes. Otherwise, made these exactly as written. My only complaint is there was no warning or advice on how to stop eating them! Thank you for the great recipe. I will make these often.

This is the best roasted chickpea recipe Iâ€™ve come across. Everyone in our house loves these. I add a quarter tsp cayenne.

Yummy and addictive!! I'd suggest OVER SEASONING the chickpeas really absorb flavor.

I made a half recipe and followed the directions as written. I checked them every 10 minutes during cooking and they took about 35 minutes. I would check every 2 minutes or so at the end next time as I think they go from just right to burned quickly. They tasted great! I would make them again.
