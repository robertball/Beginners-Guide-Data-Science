I absoluely LOVE this recipe. I took the advice of others and added 1 tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of salt to the flour and also mixed the oil and water until creamy before adding it to the flour. I found that following the recipe as is makes enough for one pie crust with a bit left over, so I make 1.5 of the recipe for 2 pie crusts. I have used this many many times and will continue to keep making it! Thanks!

I was a bit skeptical as I mixed and rolled this out. It seemed pretty gooey. I did add a couple more teaspoons of flour as I rolled it out so that it wouldn't tear as I transferred it to the pie plate. But the end result is WOW. It's delicious! I used it to make an apple pie and sprinkled the top crust with a little sugar before baking. What a great recipe! Light, flakey, perfect. Even the bottom crust, which I was afraid would be soft, is firm yet delicate. I can't WAIT to make another pie with this recipe. It's a little intimidating as you're preparing it, but stick with it. The texture and flavor are among the best I've ever tasted.
**just had to come back and add that my pies have now become famous in the neighborhood because of this recipe. Our friend has been heckling me all week from across the street to bake him a pie. 
Thank you thank you thank you for this recipe. I will never use another one as long as I live!

I've been making a similar version for years.  Only I add 1 t sugar and 1 t salt into the flour and combine with a fork.  Next, stir the oil and ice water (7+ T) until creamy, then pour over flour mixture.  You can also pat it into a pie plate to avoid rolling.

I have made this crust several times now and it always come out flaky and delicious!!! 15 minutes before throwing the ingredience together I place a bowl of ice cubes and water in the freezer, I also chill a stainless steel bowl, and measure my oil and place it too in the freezer. I mix it up quickly and shape it into an eight inch disk and place it in the fridge.(In plastic wrap) I roll it out quickly between two pieces of plastic wrap (I don't roll it with extra flour) The trick to this recipe is not to handle the crust too much and to keep it chilled. Come out perfect every time!!Thanks!!

This crust was very tender and flaky just as stated by other reviewers. I followed Paulap's advice and put everything in the freezer including the oil. I also added 1tsp each of salt and sugar to the flour as many others suggested. When you wisk the oil and ice water together, it will turn white, then add it slowly to the flour. If you have a dough hook attachment on your mixer, this dough comes together in a few minutes. Very easy! I was surprised at how good it baked. I used the crust for the Luscious Chicken Pot Pie recipe on this site and it was excellent! The crust browned evenly on top and bottom, no soggy crust here. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks, Linda, for a wonderful recipe!

Easy easy easy.  The only thing my family adds to this is 1/2 t of salt otherwise exactly the same.

Wow! This was a good pie crust recipe.  This is coming from someone who normally doesn't eat her pie crust.  I added a tsp. sugar and some salt as suggested and I pre-mixed the water and oil.  Very easy to make and turned out flakey and tasty!

This is now my standard go-to recipe for pie crust - it has become a firm family favorite! I usually add 1 tsp salt and, if it is for a sweet pie, 1 tbsp sugar.

This is an excellent recipe.  My mom always makes her pies with an oil crust but I could never figure out how she did it.  This is the first oil pie crust that has worked perfectly for me.

This is a great recipe for those who do not want to cut in shortening or butter. It is a hassle normally to make pie crust. I made mine with a berry filling, looks great, smells great, tastes great! I did add salt and sugar. Nice find - THANKS

I used light olive oil and apple juice instead of ice water for my apple pie (No Sugar Apple Pie recip also found on this site).  This crust is awesome!

We used this crust for our favorite apple pie recipe yesterday and what a hit!  I used all 100% whole wheat flour for it and it was excellent!  (I also added 2 tsp. unrefined sugar, 1 tsp. sea salt.)  5 stars for flakiness,  taste,  simplicity and  on the dough being easy to work with.  I couldn't ask for more!  Thank you so much for this one,  GAF55.  Our family loved it!

I would not use this recipe again.  It wasn't inedible but there are definitely better recipes out there.  I was drawn to this recipe for its simplicity but I found out the hard way that trying to cut corners ended up costing me more time in the end.  The crust was extremely susceptible to tearing and rather than turning out flaky, it was crispy and overly oily.  It was a mess to roll out even with the plastic wrap and it tore numerous of times.  By the time I finally transferred the crust into the pan, I was so fed up that I just gave up and slapped the strips of my lattice top on the pie haphazardly.  I really did want this recipe to work out as I had wanted something without butter and it looked so easy but unfortunately this is not the recipe to use.

Wonderful!   I had no shortening and was excited, but a little sceptical when I saw this recipe. I  try to avoid white flour, so I made mine with whole wheat flour instead and added in about 2tsps of vanilla to cut the wheaty taste a bit. It turned out flaky and delicious! thanks :)

This is a great quick pie crust.  Needed a crust in a pinch and was able to get this done in about 5 minutes.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp salt to the flour.  I would recommend adding only 1/4 tsp salt as the crust was very salty.  Also, this made about a crust and a half for me.  Not the double it yeilds.

My oldest son made this crust last night for a broccoli and chicken pie and it was absolutely wonderful.  He said it was very easy but a little oily.  It will certainly be made again and I plan on playing around with different kinds of oils depending what I put in the pie.  Thanks for sharing!

HURRAH! It only took 35 years to make a beautiful pie. I could make them taste good, flake good  but tough to look great until now. I finally made a pie that was not patched. lol.   Thank you for sharing.

wow Im impressed! I was searching for a recipe that didnt use shortening or lard as I had none. I came across this and glad I tried it. It tastes very good! So simple. I didnt roll it or use plastic wrap. I just balled it up then pressed it into the pan.

The FIRST pie crust I've ever made to perfection! The crust was flaky and flavorful. Don't worry about the dough being sticky - it still works out great.

Whoa!!! Stop whatever you were doing before with those other pie crust recipes and start using this one.  It's so simple and so good.  The taste was awesome.  I used it on a peach pie recipe and added a pinch of salt and some sugar and it hit the spot.      My husband was able to mold it easily in the glass pie pan and then used some of the extra dough for another project and just added a little bit more flour and a tad bit more of oil and water.      Doubt I will be returning to the day sof shortening and butter.

This crust is easy, quick and flaky but is missing the butter flavor you get from a traditional crust.  That being said, this is a great recipe!

This was a great crust.  I used everyones suggestions and added 1tsp salt, 1tsp sugar, and I used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour in place of all purpose flour.  I rolled it out thin on wax paper added a little extra flour when it started breaking apart.  I used it for baking zucchini pie (like pumkin pie) and it turned out wonderful.  Recipe makes 3 single crust.

HI! This a great recipe. Since plastic wrap and I seem to have issues when rolling out crust, I use waxed paper. It is so easy and forgiving. I have used this recipe about 10 times now and each time it has come out perfect. I did add salt as others have suggested.

This is a good recipe if you are in a hurry but I wouldn't use it for a pie that I was going to serve to guest.  It wasn't as flaky as I hoped it would be.

I am terrible at making traditional pie crust. I haven't got the patience for all the cutting in that it requires. That is why this recipe is a lifesaver! It is so easy to simply mix everything together and go. I do have a word of advice though for all those reviewers that talked about how difficult this is to work with. I completely agree. Becauses of the oil it can be hard to roll out, sticks to your paper or counter, and it shrinks up when it is baked. The simple solution to this is to refridgerate the dough for a while (I did for about 2 hours) so it can firm up a bit. Then work quickly while rolling it out and make sure to poke it with a fork all over if you are prebaking it for a custard pie. It turns out so flaky and beautiful (especially if you add an egg wash to the top to make it crisp up a bit and turns it golden). I will not even attempt another recipe any more because I had never gotten compliments on crust the way I do with this recipe. Try it! You'll see.

I love this recipe! It's so easy and it comes out beautifully. I add 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp sugar as other reviewers have suggested and it's perfect. I also don't always roll it out, this dough works if you just press it into the pan as well.

I'm not usually a huge fan of pie crust because it is dry, but this was perfect and so simple to make. I also added 1 Tbsp of sugar. The recipe as is does not make 2 pie crusts. If you want 2, make 1 1/2 of the recipe.

I used this four times. Once for blueberry/ricotta pie, once for thanksgiving leftover pot pie, once to wrap a brie (which was awesome) and once to make empanadas. I just added a little seasoning for each of the varieties but the crust has been perfect each time. I love the taste and texture, I love that it has three ingredients which I always have in my pantry and I love that it is fast and cheap.  I intend to try it with sesame oil and garlic infused olive oil to add a little more flavor depending on what it's getting used with.   This is a home run recipe - because everything you make with it goes out of the park!

I needed an oil pastry recipe since I was out of shortening and this one was perfect.  I live in a very dry climate and have a lot of difficulty with a traditional pie crust... even with a little extra water, they crumble and look horrible.

This crust was so quick to make.  Handling was somewhat challenging, I did use the plastic wrap and it rolled out fine but it was difficult for me to transfer it to the pie plate.  Both crusts tore a little but compared to how my other crusts usually wind up, these were fine.  I slid one off the plastic wrap and actually picked up the second one which tore less.

The taste was excellent.  I will be using this crust from now on.

Have searched for many years for a flaky pie crust. I was skeptical at first butwas amazed at the ease of making this crust and how good it was. The only change that I made was to add one scant teaspoon of salt.

I always have a hard time making pie crust, because somehow, I never use enough water, or the recipie never calls for enough. I don't keep shortening in my home, and I was happy to use canola oil since it barely has saturated fat. This is so easy to roll out, and easy to transfer to the pie plate. I will use this recipie from now on! Thank you!

Fantastic!! I love this recipe! I hate pie crust normally, but this was great. Crispy and flakey. I did put oil  & water in the freezer and it came together beautifully. I also sprinkled sugar on the top off the pie. I have never made a pie crust before and this was exceptionally easy for a newby.

Ok peeps! This is the tastiest, flakiest and easiest pie crust ever. I will never use another,now that I have found this one. Only thing I did differently was to add a pinch of salt. Love it! No more store-bought pie crusts for me!

Love it. I use this dough to make cinnamon rolls (jelly roll style).  It is easy to make and the pastry is flaky.  I have not used it for pies.

This was flaky (brittle actually), and I meant to add the salt and sugar like others recommended. But I completely forgot the extra ingredients and as a result, the crust didn't have a good flavor on it's own. Thankfully the sweet strawberry filling I made covered that up. Next time I will add the salt and sugar and I bet it will not need filling to taste good.

Very flaky and tender crust, great texture, however, it lacks in flavor. I used it for turkey pot pie for left over Christmas turkey. Next time I will add salt and play with seasoning it with other things, too. If I were to use it for a sweet dish, like a fruit pie, I would also add sugar. Still giving it 5 stars based on how easy it was to make and to work with and the great texture and flakiness.

Perfect!  I added a touch of cinnamon and sugar for my apple pie.  I had to use Vegetable Oil instead of Canola, but I figure it's about the same.  Easiest crust to work with and came out great!  I'm making it again right now, as a matter of fact!

I am giving this recipe a 3 becuase I was able to eat it but it was a pain to make. As another reviewer said, it had the consistency as wet sand, very true. I used it to make a double crust and when I went to roll out the top crust it split in two. I ended up having to make some flower designs to put over the crack and even that was a pain, the dough shapes would disintergrate in my hands. It was also bland as it doesn't have salt and I realized that after making it. I will not make again, I will try other recipes till I find a right oil based recipe that works.

Easy to make and so tender and flaky, just like the recipe says.  Easy to press into place- I used individual baking dishes, so it's much faster that way.

I was looking for a recipe that used oil rather than shortening.  I used other's reviews with adding sugar & salt, but forgot to premix the water & oil.  It blended very in my mixer and rolled out nicely with the wax paper.  However, it was a little flakey and oily putting in the pie plate (even after chilling it).  I could have used more flour, however the end result was a very flakey, flavorful crust.  I used this with a chicken pot pie recipe from this site and it complimented it very well.

Wasn't too sure how to rate this.  The dough seemed WAY too oily for me.  The oil dripped all over the fridge, through the plastic wrap.  When I went to roll it, I had to add a LOT of flour, just so I could work with it.  But, I must say, the flavor was wonderful.  I'm not sure how I'll fix the oiliness, but it tasted good.

This was a nasty mess.  I couldn't even roll it and ended up having to send my husband to the store for some frozen pie crust.  On the positive side my chickens loved it.  It had the consistency of wet sand.  What a waste of time & money!  Luckily the whole thing was cracking me up why would I think this would be good?  Don't try, it's horrible.

This recipe didn't work for me at all. It was somehow wet and crumbly at the same time, and it was impossible to work with. It also didn't make enough for a top and bottom crust. I added salt and sugar, which helped with the flavor. Overall, I won't be making this again.

Scaled this to 10 servings, used a combo of olive and canola oils, added salt and pepper, and used it to make a beef pot pie. Came out pretty well. Not sure how it would work in a sweet/desert pie...but worked fine for this.

This was one of the best pie crusts I've ever had!  I was actually surprised it could turn out this good with just oil.  I used soybean oil (basically vegetable oil) instead of canola.  I also added a teaspoon of salt and about half a tablespoon of sugar.  I rolled it out between two pieces of wax paper and then refrigerated it for 20 minutes before using it.  Will definitely be using this whenever I don't feel like doing it the traditional way, which is most of the time.  ;)

This crust is so yummy and flaky!  I could not believe how easy it was to make.  I found that the dough was not quite big enough to fill a 9 inch pie pan, so next time I will adjust it to make 9 servings instead of 8.

Linda, you are my hero! I've been looking for a flakey and easy pie crust for years. Recently, I've cut out hydrogenated oils and was having such a hard time finding a pie crust without shortening and all the hydrogenated yucky stuff. The canola sounded odd to use in the crust, but mixing was so painless, rolling the pastry was a cinch, and the taste was perfect. This will be the only pie crust recipe i will ever use. Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was a piece of cake! (or pie!)  Very simple and the end result was pretty good.  It obviously isn't a buttery crust but it did have a good crumble and good taste.  PLUS - I liked the fact that it was essentially a cholesterol free crust. Thanks!

I've never made a pie crust before, but because this looked so easy and I had the ingredients, I decided to give a try.  I made pot pie with it, family loved it. I've also used it for apple pie and it was great for that too. So if you need a pie crust for savory or sweet dish, this is a great one to use. Such simple ingredients for a tasty crust. Thank you for sharing your recipe. God bless!

This is my standby pie crust. As the publisher of the recipe noted, this recipe truly cannot fail!  I do an egg wash coating on the top of the crust and sprinkle with a little raw can sugar to give it a beautiful golden and sweet texture.

This is the easiest pie crust. It is versitile too. Can be used for pot pies, quiches, and fruit pies. Remember to add spices accordingly to the crust depending on the dish. One of my stand bys now for sure.

Easy and super yummy!  I usually make this right in the pie plate then freeze it for about an hour.  This time I tried rolling it out for on top of my pie.  I turned out good.

I loved everything to do with this crust! I made the crust for a cobbler and followed what others suggested, ESPECIALLY mixing the oil and water until it was creamy, putting the oil and water in the freezer, and the  tsp of sugar. And I cut the salt back to half a tsp because a full tsp seemed a bit much. It rolled out just fine when it was cold, and even better when it got just a tad bit warmer. I added a little sugar to the top as it was baking, and when the cobbler came out, I almost melted through the floor with how wonderful the crust was! It's totally customizable, and permanently in my recipe book. Thanks for the amazing crust!

The pie crust turned out good... however i would add sugar like other comments suggested. Also the pie crust is easier to work with if you stick it in the freezer for 10-15 min. before rolling it out.

This crust is very easy, and because it doesn't have to chill, it's great for last minute baking. I've found it works awesome for sweet pies, as well as savory dishes, like a pot pie. It can taste a bit oily, but it's still delicious.

I'd never made pie crust (or a pie for that matter) before so I was looking for a nice, simple recipe and this was perfect. It wasn't as tasty as some crusts but it was fine all the same. I'll be making this again.

Best pie crust ever! Just made this crust with the kids for our Thanksgiving pumpkin pie.  The crust was SO EASY to make, a no-fail recipe, rolled out beautifully, thanks for the recipe! The dough transferred perfectly to the pie dish and baked perfectly in the oven.

I use this recipe with out the freezing but I mix 3 Tbsps of milk to the oil and blend.  Then press quickly and uniformly into the pan and up the sides, leaving part for a crumble topping.  Add filling, top with crumble and bake as usual in hot oven.  You wont have a lot of crust on the edge of the pie plate, but enough.  It made me into a fruit pie baker!

WOW! I have been making oil pastry crust for as long as I can remember and it was hard. I just did it for the nutritional aspect. This recipe is incredibly easy and delicious! I love baking pies so this will be my standby.  THANK YOU!! (I did add 1t, salt)

Great recipe!! I've never been able to make flaky pie crusts before, but this does the trick. I substitute all white whole wheat flour. I also do 3/2 times this recipe to get a double crust (3 C flour, 1 C oil), and I add some salt and sugar for sweet pies. I refrigerate all of the ingredients, bowls, and spoons before stirring it together to keep everything cold, and I get the crust in the refrigerator as soon as I roll it out; it helps to give flakiness if you put a cold crust in the oven to bake. I had issues with it falling apart when I made a lattice-top, but I just mushed it back together, and it turned out great. Also, brushing the top with an egg made it shiny and gorgeous.

This is so easy.  The cold water does need to be very cold.  The key is to not over handle the dough.  This recipe can be frozen and used at a later time.  I also refrigerated overnight and got good results.  I love being able to use canola rather than butter or shortening.  I also love the ease of just pushing into the pie pan rather than rolling out.  When I do roll out, I find it is easiest to roll out between to pieces of plastic wrap.  This is definitely a keeper.

I give it 5 stars for being easy, for tasting good, and for cooking properly despite being so wet. With that said, this was not exactly what I was looking for. I needed a pie crust that could be folded over a filling, and this was not it. This is a VERY fragile dough. I'll use this again, but only for single crust pies, as it's much too difficult to move around!

I made my own chicken pot pie filling from leftover roasted chicken drippings and needed a savory crust to go along with it.  I decided to try this recipe and oh my goodness did this crust make it the best chicken pot pie I have ever tasted (this was my first time making pot pie at home)!  My German husband, who had never eaten a pot pie, said it was delicious and ate 1/2 the pie himself!  It was a bit greasy when I was rolling it out but the easy fix for that is to just sprinkle some flour on top.  I rolled the dough on baking paper, then placed it the pan and added the filling.  Then I rolled out the top crust on plastic wrap and transfered it to the pie.  I didn't have canola oil so I used sunflower oil instead and it still tasted great!  The dough was greasy to work with but definitely easy and quick!  I will use this recipe from now on for all my savory pies and quiches.  Thank you GAF55 for sharing this wonderful recipe!  UPDATE:  I forgot to mention that the bottom crust WAS COOKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!!  Just check while baking and leave it in the oven on the bottom rack until done.  If you're worried about the top burning than cover with aluminum foil.  Enjoy!

This is the best pie crust recipe I have ever tried!! However, some adjustments should be made to get the best results...use butter instead of oil, and add about 1/2 cup of sugar with a cup of flour...(or about 50% of flour) add some vanilla extract to spice up the flavor as well....

My first time making homemade pie crust was a success thanks to this recipe!  I kept hearing how tricky they can be, so I was fairly scared going into it, but the dough was very easy to work with.  I felt like the taste once baked needed something.  Sugar or salt depending on the dish would probably take care of it :)

This did not turn out so good for me.  It was flakey but was kinda heavy and floury tasting.  I was going to add salt like some other reviewers did but forgot so maybe that would help.

I made this with wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour and it turned out awesome. Like others suggested, I added 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp sugar.

Linda, you rock!  This was so easy.  I've never made pie crust because I didn't want to go through all the work, but I'll never use store-bought again.  I tried yours because it called for oil.  I substituted olive oil and added 3/4 teaspoon salt; also followed the instructions of an earlier review, stirring together flour & salt and adding the oil & water after whisking it together.  It worked a dream and was delicious and flaky.  Thanks a lot!

What a surprise - the crust was so flaky and tasty.  I followed other suggestions and added just under a teaspoon of salt and half a tablespoon of sugar and scaled the recipe up to 10 servings to fit a 9" deep dish.  It was incredibly easy to roll out between plastic wrap, but it was tricky to transfer.  Thank you!!!

When I first read this recipe I thought it was a joke and did not hold very high hopes that it would turn out.  Wow, was I wrong.  It is extremely flaky.  Almost too much so, as it crumbles when putting a fork into it.  I do find the bottom and the edge of the pie turns out a bit firm though.  I have made this crust twice.  Once without salt and the second time with 1 tsp of salt and I prefer with the salt.  Just gives it that extra bit of flavour.  It is, most certainly, fast and easy and I will make it again but will continue my search for the PERFECT recipe.

To my surprise this pie crust really is tender and flakey. It needs to rolled out between parchment or wax paper and it's not easy to move around in your pie pan, but overall I really like it.

Very quick and easy. Makes light, flaky pastry in minutes with a minimum of effort, using nutritionally superior unsaturated oil. Gets rave reviews from my family.

Love this pie crust. Have been trying for a decade to perfect a crust and then found this. Love love love it. I use different infused oils like chili oil or garlic oil just for enhancement.

Would not use this recipe again... It was very easy to make, very manageable and texture was fine BUT (to me anyway) taste terrible... the taste of the oil is way too strong. I think it would be better to go the more difficult route or dont make pie crust at all...

This was awesome. As a few others have recommended, I added a little sugar and salt. At first, I wondered if the crust was too wet/moist prior to baking, but it turned I had nothing to worry about. Awesome, flaky crust and everyone who had a slice complimented me on its taste and texture.  Will use this as my go-to recipe for crust for now on.

Turns out great and stays crisp. Really holds up and doesn't turn soggy.  Have used it for fruit pies and pot pies.

I found the ratio of oil to water made a greasy pie crust. It also needs a little bit of salt. This is quick to make, but not a fan of this recipe.

I normally make a pie crust using shortening.  I chose this recipe to use in a pinch when I had no shortening at home.  I cut my recipe in half since I only needed one 9" crust.  I added 1/2 tsp . Sugar an 1/2 tsp. Salt.  I whisked the ice water and oil together before adding it to the flour mixture.  After the crust was prepared and in the pie plate, I put the pie plate in the freezer while I prepared the pie ingredients.  This was easy to prepare.  The crust was tender, crisp and flakey.  I will definatly save this recipe, it may become the one I go to first.

This is a great basic crust. I used it for quiche and found it the perfect base. I just recommend adding a dash of salt so it's not too bland.

Flaky.  Definitely add salt.  Sugar if for a dessert.  

Used it for a chicken pot pie, added salt to the dough, and it was a hit.

It is a bit hard to roll.  Definitely chill before rolling out.  It is oily but it crisps nicely in the oven.

I would use this again.

While I struggled to roll it out or even "press" it into the dish as suggested by other reviews, this was by far the best crust I have ever had or made! The flavor was perfect (with a bit of salt added) I used it for a chicken pie - so more of a savory dish. The perfect flakiness and consistancy. I made more this afternoon, but have it chilling in the fridge for later. Will certainly keep trying till I perfect it!

For all intents and purposes, this recipe is great. Most likely you have all the ingredients on hand, it mixes super quickly, and it bakes up really flakey. My only concern is that it is very bland. If I were making a sweet dish I would definitely add some sugar. Since I made a chicken pot pie with it, I will add a bit of salt next time. Also, I doubled the recipe and was only able to make three crusts, so I would make even more next time.
Great starter recipe that would be easily customizable and made to your own tastes.

This recipe is a good start, but I couldn't use it as-is. As many others have noted, the effort to get away from butter or lard is important, but this crust is so oily as written that it's pretty close to impossible to roll out. I added salt, extra flour (about 1/3 cup), and refrigerated it for a half hour or so to let the flour soak up the oil. Then I rolled it directly in the pie plate with a small roller gizmo that's for rolling out pizza crust (got it from Pampered Chef, as I recall). Crust turned out very well with those changes.

For Gluten Free crust: use 2 cups gluten free all purpose flour, 2 teaspoons Xanthan Gum, 2/3 cup oil (I used olive oil) and 6 tablespoons ice cold water (had to add slightly more so I could roll it out).

Works nicely, make sure to GF flour your rolling pin (and use wax paper beneath the dough).

This is a fast easy pie crust to make. I used it to make pot pie. I cooked it at 350 for 10 mins. the only thing is it does not really get golden brown but it tastes really good.

excellent! i added the tsp of salt and sugar and chilled the dough before putting it in the pie tin. I was a little short on the top crust so I'd suggest making 1 1/2 of the recipe.

4 1/2 Stars!  (1/2 star missing for lack of butter taste) This was surprisingly wonderful.  I've never made pie crust without butter.  (I did add 1/2 tsp. of salt - Food without any amount of salt is a sin in my book)  I was very skeptical how this would taste, but it was great.  Very Very flaky and delicious.  Great to make when all you have is oil on hand!

I really didn't think it would work...but I just made it I liked it okay (doesn't taste like Grandma made it, but I'm not Grandma am I).  I didn't have shortening so this worked great for my black berry pie...not soggy and the flavor didn't take away from the berries.  My Daughter said it was great pie.

This pie crust is so easy to make.  I'm new to cooking so I usually go for recipes with fewest ingredients and healthy alternatives.  I love that this pie crust uses canola oil instead of lard or shortening.  BUT... it was NOT flaky!  I am new to cooking for maybe I did not bake it right.  I guess you can't do healthy with pie crusts!

This was fantastic!  I used a tsp of salt and a tsp of sugar as recommended by others.. I thought it was a little gooey myself, but again, as recommended I added a few tsps of flour and it was perfect.  It seems more gooey than it really is I think, because the end result is perfection!

Very good.  Considering there is no butter or shortening, it's super super easy.  I did 4 stars because I added a dash of salt and a few sprinkles of sugar, figuring that would make it better since I was making a dessert.  Yum!

After ruining a ready pie crust in the middle of preparing a steak and ale pie, I scrambled to find a crust that would be quick and that didn't involve shortening or butter (as I was out of both). I whipped this up in 10 minutes flat. As I stuck the pie in the oven, I was convinced that I had ruined the whole dish. I didn't have time to read the other reviews, so I followed the recipe exactly. After eating his dinner, my husband proclaimed that I should be making the crust myself from now on, as mine was better than Pillsbury.

This pie crust is delicious!  I made it several times exactly as the recipe stated.  Then I made it and added 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. sugar as others suggested. I will ALWAYS add the salt and sugar to the recipe.  I noticed an improvement and found the dough to be easier to work with.  EXCELLENT and VERY EASY!

Never Again.  Way too oily.  The dough literally melted down into the bottom of the pie pan and I had to take it out and add more flour and start over TWICE!  Where oh where is that oil crust recipe Betty Crocker had in its 1960's cookbook?

This crust was addicting! I added some salt to give it more taste. Don't increase the recipe to 1.5 times the amount (as another reviewer suggested). I did, and my pie pan was overflowing.

Very, very easy.  Not as good as a crust made with shortening, and definitely not as good as one made with butter, but super easy and quick.  It's pretty oily, so I was glad I rolled it out between sheets of wax paper.

Very easy and quick to make.

A bit too oily for my tastes.  Next time I will try and cut back on the oil a little and see how it goes.

I ended up adding more than 1t of sugar since it was for a sweet type pie.  

Has a nice texture, will modify oil next time.

I made this and added the salt and sugar as mentioned in the reviews.  I used it with a sweet potato filling.  The pie crust was very easy to make which is why I tried it, but tasted very salty.  It wasn't that good and I will not be making this again.

I LOVE this recipe!  I added 1t sugar and 1t salt and used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I also mixed the 6T of water with the oil before adding it to the flour mixture.  I pressed it into two pie plates for quiches...delicious and easy!

This recipe does do what it says. I was seriously skeptical, but it worked out! I'm definitely using this again. It's important to add the sugar and the salt though so it doesn't taste "oily"--I used canola oil. Also, I didn't really understand what people meant by "creaming" the oil and water together. I just mixed it with my mixer until it was milky, and that was just fine. Good recipe!

I must have done something wrong because I ended up with a pile of goo that got holes in it when I tried to roll it out.

This turned out very nicely, especially for an oil-based pastry. It was a warm day when I made it, and it was very soft, but it still rolled out fine (with lots and lots of flour). I will use this one often, and maybe try it with whole-wheat flour next.

I gave up trying to make my own pie crusts until now!!  I added a little salt and sugar as suggested in other reviews, and also rolled in out with flour since I didn't have any wax paper.  I don't think you can mess up this pie crust.  Used it for chicken pot pie and everybody loved it!

Sometimes simpler is better. I have messed up typical pie crust recipes so many times, I thought there was no way this was going to turn out decent with so few ingredients.  I left the dough in the fridge overnight and it rolled out perfectly between plastic wrap.  It had a great texture and could be used for both savory and sweet pies.

This is the easiest and tastest pie crust I have ever made. After many unsuccesful attempts 20+ years ago I have buying my pie crusts at the market. This was easy and it rolled out perfectly between the waxed paper sheets. I won't be buying my pie crust any longer. The only reason I even tried this was because I was making the Scottish mince pie from this site and didn't realize I only had one crust in the fridge and needed two; so of course I came to my favorite website and found this. Thank you so very much.

Thanks for posting this!  When I was in college, I knew a girl who made crusts with oil, no butter or shortening.  I've since lost track of her, and now that I have to cut my saturated fats, I was delighted to find your recipe.  I just tried it (halved the recipe, for one single-crust pie), and it rolls out a lot easier than the "usual" shortening-based recipe.  Thanks again!

The taste was great, and I liked that it didn't have all the saturated fat in it - but I had a little trouble handling it.  First of all, it wasn't quite enough for a 2-crust pie.  I could just barely get a lattice top out of it.  I had a hard time keeping it from tearing, possibly because it was a little too dry.  I think if I use it again I'd make 1 1/2 of the recipe, add another tsp or so of water, and I might add a pinch of salt just to enhance the flavor.

I was very skeptical because of the oil, but it worked very well, it didnt burn and was pretty flaky. Definately a keeper, although a little oily and harder to put into the pan than normal.

Linda, you're a God send! I was growing very frustrated with my usual pie crust recipe. For some odd reason it wasn't turning out. So I used your recipe. I must admit I was a little leery at first with the oil, but this was PERFECT! So easy to make, and the crust turned out just beautiful! I'll be using this from now on  for all my pies! :o)

Great recipe, doesn't have all that saturated fat or trans fats like in other pie crusts made with butter, lard, or shortening (yucky). It turned out just lovely for me!!  ;)
