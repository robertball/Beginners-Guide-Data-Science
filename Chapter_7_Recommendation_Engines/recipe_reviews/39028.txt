This is a simple, elegant looking recipe for a delicious dessert. Here are my tips: instead of taking the time to make the chocolate sauce, I simply bought hot fudge topping (although seeing that the recipe was submitted by Nestle I am sure that they want you to buy their ingredients). I couldn't find raspberry sauce in my supermarket so I substituted strawberry syrup instead. The end result was really good, although next time I will add less sugar to the cream cheese. It was really sweet.

Boy, did this one surprise me! I went into it w/ low expectations ....thinking "OK, how good could it be...it's canned pears & cream cheese" but I wanted a quick & easy dessert so I gave it a shot. It was really VERY good! I didn't make the chocolate sauce either...I just used chocolate syrup. I didn't have raspberry syrup but did have raspberry jam so I microwaved it for a few seconds to liquefy it a bit. This will be enjoyed over & over again at my table.
