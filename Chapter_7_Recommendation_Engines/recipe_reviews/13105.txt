It seems a lot of people have had problems with the thickness of this soup.  In case you did not know, thickening agents do not come to their full thickening potential until they come to a boil.  Therefore, you can add all the cornstarch and water (known as a slurry) you want (or roux for that matter), but it will not obtain its full thickening power until it boils with the liquid it is supposed to thicken.  I would not recommend boiling the half and half, so I would do the first part, adding the slurry to the chicken stock, boil that for a few minutes, adjust thickness if needed with more slurry (cornstarch and water, it works best if the cornstarch is whisked into cold water), lower the heat, add the half and half and the cheese, stir until the cheese melts, and then serve.  I have not made this soup, but reading through the reviews, it seems a lot of people have trouble with the thickness so I am just offering a suggestion and/or advice.

I had read many of the past reveiws about the recipe being a little runny so I mad a few changes and it turned out awesome!  
What I did was started with only about half the beer(you can add more later) and mixed the cornstarch with the chicken stock and left out the water. When I added the cornstartch and chicken stock mixture, the soup got thick right away and I also doubled the cheese and wocsteshire.
YUMMY!!!

I am afraid to say that if I were to have followed the original recipe I would have been utterly dissapionted. After having discovered the soup was horribly thin, I added copious amounts of corn starch in a hasty attempt to thicken it. I had already added an additional cup of cheese, and with the extra corn starch the recipe was a splendid success. Best when served with garlic bread. This recipe is also quite easy to prepare and is ready to serve in minimal time, but beware: not enough corn starch will leave you unbearably dissatisfied.

I am very confused about everybody's poor review about it being thin, and all of the other complaints.  This soup is fantastic, but it MUST be followed exactly.  I think that's the reason everybody is having a problem is they are changing things before they even try it by following the directions.  I make this every week, and have never had a problem so I don't know why anyone else is.

Very good!  I used dark beer one time (Shiner Bock) and Budweiser one time.  The dark beer gave it a much more complex, interesting flavor.  The Bud didn't do much for it at all.  I also followed the advice of another commenter and dissolved the cornstarch in the chicken broth then added it and brought it to a boil, then added beer and brought to a boil, then slowly added the cheese by the small handful (I used sharp cheddar) and let it dissolve before adding more, stirring very often.  I also cooked and crumbled some bacon for sprinkles and bought a loaf of dense, dark German bread which I toasted.  Very delicious and easy! 2/26/09 I just noticed a mistake:  I add the cream before I add the cheese.  But, I have changed the way I make this soup!  I make it all the time. I have been cooking 1/2 lb. of bacon in pot then cooking the onion and garlic in bacon grease. I changed it around and now use the beer to deglaze the pan, then bring to a boil for 3 minutes, then add chicken broth and cornstarch and bring to a boil.  Next I turn the heat down and add the cream or half-n-half.  I do slowly add the cheese by sprinkling it over the surface of the liquid and letting it melt.  I stir that in and then repeat til I used all the cheese. I serve the crumbled bacon and sour cream for toppers. I also put a whole yellow onion in and I think it makes the soup more filling.  My soup is usually pretty thick so I just add more chicken broth to make it the consistancy I like and that includes

I made this soup twice at 2 grocery store food demos.  It was requested that I incorporate a tub of Rondele garlic-and-herb cheese spread so I did.  I got many compliments and requests for the recipe.

Was a very good starting place for me. I did read numerous reviews ahead of time and took heed the reducing the beer by 1/2, using 3 cups cheese instead of 2, and I also omitted the water and mixed my cornstarch with some of the chicken stock. I used a good base I have instead of canned. The key to not having a "grainy" turn out is to remember to turn down the heat to med-low and add the cheese slowly and stir (I prefer whisking) continuously. If you don't care for beer i recommend using a nice reisling or chardonay.  NEVER be afraid to try new variations. Variety is the Spice of Life!

Very delicious soup! I didn't use the cornstarch, but made a flour/butter roux to thicken.

I don't understand the other reviewers' complaints about this being thin or grainy. I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out smooth, rich, and delicious. I love The Flying Tiger's Beer Cheese Soup in Buffalo, Ny so much that I have driven there numerous times from here in Rochester (60 miles). I no longer have to. This recipe is restaurant-quality soup. Don't be afraid to try this based on the handful of bad reviews. This is well worth it!

In lieu of adding more cornstarch as a thicking agent you night try adding instant potato buds, they not only thicken but add flavor as well. Just add them a small amount at a time. I do this with most of my soups. To add a little more interest you might add a dash of paprika or a touch of creamed horseradish. I add horseradish to my mac n' cheese, does wonders for the flavor. "Tillamook", from Oregon, extra sharp cheese is fantastic in this soup.

Thin and boring. Modifications to make this soup appealing would render it a different recipe altogether.

Wish I could give this 5 stars, but it needs some work..  This is a really tasty soup with some seasoning.. not sure what was missing, I ended up adding white pepper, chopped onion (as suggested by another reader) and more cheese... But absolutely take the advice of OHENZIGURI in regards to the slurry..  my soup turned out at the perfect thickness with her direction (and thanks for that!  nothing worse than watery Cheese soup!)  Overall, not bad, but have definitely had better. Thanks Debbie!

This soup is fantastic! I made a few changes: used 4 cups of sharp cheddar rather than 2, I cut my onions pretty chunky, they gave it great texture. Also, I mixed my cornstarch with chicken broth instead of water. And I let it simmer for atleast 5 extra minutes to get the thick consistency I wanted. We serve this up in sourdough bread bowls and it is to die for!

The flavor was nice (would have been better if we had a stronger beer). Mine curdled and had a very grainy texture; I don't know if that was the recipe or just me. Will try again, with stronger beer to get more flavor, and hope for the thick, smooth, velvety texture of the restaurant soups I'm looking for.

This was way good.  My husband and I had a blast making this, and even reheated it in the crockpot the next day and finished it off with our family.  We added two large cubed potatoes to the mix and it was just unbelieveable!! WONDERFUL!

I have made this version many times and it always turns out well since I substitute Kraft Velveeta cheese instead of shredded cheddar cheese.  I made it once with cheddar and didn't like how it turned out.  But it is smooth with the Velveeta.  I also use a particular type of beer called Chili Beer, it gives it a little extra kick!  Everyone I have served this to loved it!!

I have been looking for a good beer and cheese soup recipe for a long time. I discovered this soup when i was pregnant in 09 and could never find a good recipe until i came across this one. It's perfect and amazing. The only thing i changed was using a Pale Ale insead of a light beer, it gives it such a good flavor. I dont even like Ale beer but its a must for this soup, also i doubled the cheese and added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Enjoy...

This has become a favorite recipe for me, I make it all the time! Generally, I alter mine to include potatoes, carrots, and cabbage at the same stage as the onions, cooking until the veggies are tender before I move on to the rest of the recipe. I find this allows it to be more of a full meal on its own.

Really good and satisfying with some crusty bread and a salad for dinner.  I doubled the recipe and that worked well.  I made a few very minor changes.  I sauteed the onions and garlic in a butter/olive oil mixture, instead of margarine.  I did swap the light beer for some German Oktoberfest brew (it's against our religion to have light beer in the house).  I boiled it a bit longer to make sure the alcohol was cooked off, since the German beer is stronger.  I also didn't have enough cornstarch because of said doubled recipe, so I substituted brown rice flour for the cornstarch 1 for 1, and it worked fine.  I imagine flour would be OK, too, or even potato starch.  Instead of bacon, which I was too lazy to cook up, I sprinkled fresh chives on top. Would definitely make again.

I made this for dinner tonight and my family (full of picky eaters in one way or another) were practically licking the bowls! I took suggestions from a lot of other reviews, but the only changes I made were flour as a thickening, and a mixture of white and yellow extra sharp cheddar cheese. I can't rave about it enough!

This is excellent!  Very similar to the Ale & Cheddar soup at one of our favorite restaurants.  I do like my soup a little thick so added extra corn starch, be sure to bring the soup to a boil with the starch in it, as  it won't thicken until it has come to a rolling boil!  I will definitely make this again!

So. There I was, with my freshly cooked Mexican-seasoned chicken, all set to make Chicken Taco Soup for my family, when I realized, I had no beans. Well, we'd have had Chicken Tacos, but I'm also out of tortillas.

By this time, I'm seriously craving something spicy with chicken and cheese, so, I found this recipe. 

I did use half the beer, substituted green onions, left out the water, added the cornstarch in with the stock, and will agree that the trick to "non-grainy-ness" is to add the cheese (I used 3 cups, pre-shredded) s-l-o-w-l-y... about 1/4 cup at a time, stirring well, over low heat.

o. so I added my chicken, a can of tomatoes with chilis, and a TBSP of taco seasoning, and will probably use a thicker version of this recipe as a dip.

thanks!

It was ok as a base, but I had to add more beer, more cheese, more Worcestershire sauce, and a lot more cornstarch. I used generic-brand sharp cheddar cheese, pre-grated, and had no problems with graininess. I think that was due to the fact that I added the cornstarch slurry before the cheese & 1/2 and 1/2. I didn't boil it after that, as that could cause the cheese to separate. It was pretty good after I made the adjustments, but without them, it wasn't what I was looking for in an authentic beer cheese soup.

I love beer and I love cheese and this was a great soup!  The only thing I did different is add an extra cup of cheese.  Next time I will add the cornstarch before the 1/2 and 1/2 and cheese and bring it to a boil to see if that helps with the thickness.  I use a block of cheese and grate it myself, as packaged grated cheese contains a waxy coating to keep it from sticking together and it seems to melt better this way.

Instead of margarine, I used the drippings from 6 strips of bacon. High fat, but tasty. I also added more cheese.

This soup had a terrific flavor and is great with crusty bread.  I highly recommend adding extra cornstarch and cheese.  If made extra thick and put in a slow cooker, it makes AWESOME cheddar fondue.

Overall a good recipe. Bland though.  I added swiss cheese with the cheddar. I also added crushed black pepper, more Worchesire sauce, more cornstarch(thicker) and a little cayenne pepper.  HUGE HIT!!! When I make it, I triple the recipe and serve with a fresh loaf of italian or french bread. YUM!!

This was really good and perfect to eat on a cold day. I used 1 1/2 cups of vegetable broth instead of a can of chicken broth. I added the cornstarch/water mixture along with broth and the soup was perfectly thick. We served this with cheese sprinkled on top and it was delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!

Had the exact flavor I was looking for!  I used 1 cup half and half and one cup 1% milk instead of 2 cups half and half.  Also, I did adjust the recipe slightly by adding more broth and 1% milk at the end... a little too rich for me.

This was a pretty easy and delicious recipe with just a couple of minor additions.  I followed a previous reviewer's recommendation of adding the cornstarch (I actually just used flour since I couldn't find the cornstarch) while the stock was boiling, and then reducing before adding cheese and cream.  
My additions were:  some ground mustard seed, a little bit of basil, and some more garlic.  I also added almost a cup of extra cheese, and topped with bacon pieces and green onions.  Mmmmm....
We enjoyed this immensely with salad and yeast rolls on the side.

LOVE this soup! Shallots are a nice touch in place of onions if you happen to have them on hand. Fresh chicken broth instead of canned. I also usually throw in a bit more cheese than it calls for. A nice dark ale adds a good flavor. As far as thickening, I add a touch of extra cornstarch than the recipe calls for and allow it to reach a boil after I add the mixture, before turning it down to low. This soup is even better the next day!

This is a good, quick & easy soup! I added the cornstarch slurry after the chicken broth & let it boil (while stiring with a whisk) until it was almost as thick as gravy, then added the 1/2 & 1/2 and cheese. I used Redbridge Gluten-Free beer and also added some ground ginger, celery salt and parsley. Next time, I'm going to try it with red potatoes and bacon. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a fairly good recipe.  I do not understand the reviews of the recipe being too thin.  I simmered the soup slowly, and it thickened up nicely.  A good sharp cheese really helps the flavor. I served it with fresh bread.  All and all I found it a tasty soup.

I do not like cheese soup so the 5 stars comes from my Wisconsin born husband who loves the stuff.  I made it as directed, but I just mixed the cornstarch with a little of the the leftover chicken broth and brought it up to just before it boiled then took it down to a simmer, constantly whisking while heating. I also doubled the cheese & worcestershire and added a some parmesan, salt and a little pepper. Once everything was added I cooked it on low and stirred constantly for about 10-15 min. It thickened up perfectly. If you like beer cheese soup this is a great one.

Fantastic soup.  After reading some other comments, I added the cornstarch to the chicken stock and omitted the water.  I also doubled the cheese, and it all worked perfectly. I'll be making this soup again and again.

I read the reviews and made sure to follow the directions about the corn starch.  I even read the negative ones, and figured I'd try it anyway, sometimes people's tastes vary.  I didn't like the flavor of it, and could hardly swallow it.  I think i'll stick to drinking beer and not using it in soup. :(

I guess they all can't be gems. Okay, I had to try this again just to make sure it wasn't me messing it up. I have come to the conclusion that this  is just plain nasty stuff. I followed the recipe to the letter and both times it reminded me of a result of drinking too much beer. The flavor is way too powerful and sour, the texture of the broth isn't that of like a chicken soup or a cream soup. It falls somewhere in between. Not sure what to call it really. I tried this because I have used beer in many dishes and it makes a great  ingredient to a marinade. I'm not sure if soup is where beer should be unless you add a can to a nice French onion, it tastes awesome in there. Maybe I'll try a different beer cheese soup recipe on here to give it the third and final chance. Maybe my pallet is much more sensitive than the other reviewers? Sorry but I hated it.

I have been making this recipe, or one almost exactly like it, for years and I have a couple of tips.  If you grate your own cheese it doesn't get as grainy. Don't know what the difference is between pre-shredded and block cheese but it DOES make a difference.  I often leave out the beer and replace it with either veggie broth or chicken broth.  I have also found that if I add all the ingredients except the cheese, bring it ALMOST to a boil and then put the whole mixture through the blender it makes the mixture smoother and creamier.  Yes it's a bit more trouble but the end result is FANTASTIC!  I've had people request this soup when they are coming to our house for events.

I was not at all impressed with this soup. I love beer cheese soup and the best I've ever found is at Moab Brewery in Moab, Utah. This was very grainy and bland tasting. I'm very precise when I cook so I'd hate to think I made a mistake, but I didn't like it.

My husband did not care for this recipe, and I thought that I would but all I could handle was one little bowl and the rest was out the back door, the dog didn't seem to care for it too much.
I will keep searching!

There is a restaurant near my house that serves a cheddar ale soup, which is my absolute favorite soup in the world, and I thought this recipe might be similar.  Was I ever wrong!!  This recipe isn't very good at all.  It is the runniest soup I ever ate, even with the addition of extra cornstarch and there is entirely too much beer in it, it overpowers everything else in the recipe.  Also, even before we finished eating it, it developed a very grainy texture.

Fabulous! Not only is it easy, it's amazingly good. Each time I served it (granted, only to adults) everyone wanted the recipe. Not due to any culinary skills on my behalf, you can be sure, it's just a great recipe. Highly recommend serving with crusty bread and tearing up pieces for the soup as it's served, a la fondue-ish. Hard croutons don't take away from this soup's loveliness, but bread's just better.

Terrible. The soup is runny and rather than complimenting it, the beer completely overpowered it. To thicken it, you can puree some of it and that will improve the texture, however the flavor...not going to try this recipe again.

It didn't thicken up very well and I followed the recipe to the letter.  Not the best flavor either.  It was OK, but I probably won't make it again.

I just didn't like the taste of this soup.  It turned out pretty bland-I could taste more Worcestershire than anything-the beer flavor was lost.  I'd recommend trying a stronger beer (I used MGD light)

Delicious and super easy to make.  Great stick to the ribs soup for a cold night in, especially with warm and crusty bread.  If made exactly as recipe is written it turns out great...no need to make changes, just do it correctly and the corn starch mixture thickens beautifully.

i agree with previous reviews. this soup had a really weird look/texture. it looked really gritty. i added more chicken broth, more worcestershire sauce, lots of black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper just to give it more of the bite that i was expecting (such as previous beer cheese soups i've had). also, if i make this again, i will be taking people's advice and using a dark beer. all i had was bud light and it did not add anything to the recipe. dunked some crescent rolls in this. not bad. but not great either.

I followed this recipe to the "T".  I even stopped and bought the special beer they required (we don't drink).  Well, I hope the garbage disposal enjoyed it because we didn't.  It was curdled and extreme bitter.  I even cooked it longer in the step that called for evaporating the beer.  Would definitely not recommend thhis.

I got quite a few compliments on this one.  I read other reviews that had difficulty with the consistancy of the soup, so I didn't mess around with it.  I used a 1/2 cup of butter to fry the onion/garlic, then I added flour to make a roux and thinned it out with chicken broth.  After I had a base that had some thickness to it, I transferred it to a dutch oven and added the half-and-half, worcestershire, beer and cheese.  We didn't love the taste of it the next day, it was almost like it went a little sour in the fridge, but the first day I served it, it was great.

The worchestshire gave too much.  I would half it and add mustard instead.  Also, use a light beer as instructed, I used a pale ale, and it didn't taste great.  I enjoyed it, but my husband and son DID NOT.  Needs definite improvement.

This was a great starting point for beer cheese soup. I had made up some twice baked potatoes with butternut squash and had extra filling, so I threw it in the blender with some cottage cheese and milk and used it in place of the half-and-half - worked out great and was a great use of potato filling. Thanks for the delicious recipe.

The key to this soup is patience!  It needs to come to a boil after the corn starch is added, and it will thicken quickly.  It is important to boil it slowly and stir constantly to avoid scorching.  Another tip:  I pureed the soup in a blender after cooling for a velvety smooth texture.  I have tried it with milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2, and it is just as delicious!

Very nice and smooth, but needs a little kick for more flavor. I tried a little liquid smoke to help the bacon, and it worked. Just a little, though.

The idea of this soup is great. I found I had to make some changes. I added more garlic and more onion. I used 2 tsp of worcestershire sauce. I added an extra tbsp of cornstarch to thicken and I used 3 cups of cheese. It was a little grainy but it was still delicious. Next time I will serve in bread bowls.

This was delicious! I used flour instead of corn starch so it would be better when it's reheated, though. I also didnt have any Worcestershire sauce on hand, and it was still delicious! This will definitely be my standby beer and cheese soup recipe from now on. Next time I wanna make it with white cheddar!

My husband and I were really excited to try this recipe, but ended up being very disappointed in the result.  It lacked flavor, it was runny, it was grainy, and it tasted nothing like any beer cheese soup that I've had before.  We'll keep hunting for the perfect Beer Cheese Soup recipe.

We absolutely loved this recipe, although I did make some adjustments based on what I had in the house. I made a lighter version using skim milk. It works great, and all you have to do it add an extra tablespoon or so of the cornstarch and water mix. I also added another cup of cheese like someone else did. It took a little bit to thicken, but it was well worth it. Very rich! I can only imagine what it would be like with the hal-and-half! Definately a keeper! Thanks!

Perhaps it was my cheese, but I thought this was bland per the recipe (maybe 3 stars) so I added 2 more teaspoons of Worcestershire. Also added ground mustard (maybe 1/2 teaspoon), a pinch or two if cayenne, and a packet of Herb Ox sodium-free chicken bouillon powder. Also, I had to add 3 more tablespoons of cornstarch, as it wasn't thick enough for our taste. Also stirred in some fresh garlic chives from the garden. After my additions, I would say it was 5 stars, but my rating is based on the original recipe. Quite yummy!

I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and added some cooked diced potaoes. It added some substance to the soup, which was quite thin. The taste of the soup was great. The kids liked it as well.

Excellent taste. 
Didn't change a thing.  This will thicken to the perfect consistancy if the heat is increased again after the cornstarch is added.  Next time, though, I think I will try a roux.

I think this recipe is very tasty.  I have made it with or without the beer (using extra chicken stock) but substitute heavy cream for the half and half.  I have never had a problem with consistency when following the recipe as written.  It's delicious!

Absolutely DELICIOUS, very easy to make.  Add a little fresh-ground pepper for a bit more zingy flavor.  Kids think they're getting away with something if they eat this (as long as you don't tell them the alcohol is evaporated off!)!  :D

Also note:  for this to work for me, I had to return stovetop to medium-high when stirring in cornstarch mixture in order for soup to thicken.

I was SO DISAPPOINTED with this recipe! I didn't eat ANY of it. What saddened me the most was that I even followed some of the other changes others made after following the original recipe. I added more cheese, more cornstarch, more sauce. Nothing made it taste good at all! I appreciate every one's efforts in sharing this, but it was a waste of time and money. As stated by others, it was runny, bland, and extremely GRAINY. It did not resemble any of the Beer Cheese Soups that I've enjoyed at the restaurants.

Beer cheese soup is a favorite of mine, so I was quite excited to make this.  It didn't work out at all though.  The consistancy was quite grainy from all the cheddar.  Also, the soup was too thin.  Perhaps a lot more starch should be added.

I made this last night and it turned out GREAT - I found the original recipe to be a little blander than I like, though, so I tripled the Worchestire sauce and added nearly a cup more chredded cheddar than the recipe called for.  Then I doubled the cornstarch to make it extra-thick and it was perfect! My boyfriend was suspicious at first but ended up having seconds! Highly recommended.

I took the advice of other reviewers by adding the cornstarch slurry to the chicken broth mixture then bringing it to a boil before adding the half-&-half and cheese.  Topped with bacon crumbles and paired with crusty bread & a hearty salad makes for a very quick, easy and delicious weeknight meal.  The flavor the beer adds is so unique and tasty!  The only thing my bf and I didn't care for was the mouthful of onion at the end of the bowl.  I think next time I will either  finely grate the onion or use a hand blender  to smooth it out before adding the cornstarch slurry.

Reading the reviews helped a lot! I used double the cheese, double the beer and double the arrowroot powder (instead or cornstarch). Also made the slurry using chicken stock and added it while the chicken stock was warming so it had times to really thicken. For a bit of a kick, I also added about a tsp of cayenne pepper flakes.

This Soup was so amazing! I did read the reviews prior to preparing it and I’m glad I did. Thickening the soup prior to adding the half and half is key. My personal touches = I used a brown ale for the beer and  also added a tablespoon of spicy brown mustard for extra flavor.

Loved it. Thought it could be thicker. When I make it next time going to sub heavy cream for 1/2 & 1/2.

I add a can of diced potatoes & about 1lb diced kielbasa.

It was a decent soup. I think the beer choice matters for flavor for sure. I followed the recipe exactly and had zero problems with it thickening. I actually added more liquid because it thickened too much for me. I think next time, I'll mince the onion for a smoother texture.

I read the reviews and the only change was a little more cheese and I let the beer burn off a little more than 3 minutes. As for the thickness - wait for it! It will get thick enough!

It had a really good taste and flavor profile- I used one can of Coors Light beer........I used all the cheese called for and it didn't seem like cheese was the main star.  It also was very watery and I added flour, half and half and a little slurry and it was not as thick as what I get at my local restaurant.  I will probably try again, but I really hope I do not have to resort to processed cheese to get the thickness!

Good beer cheese soup. Was not runny like others said. I did cook it in the crockpot and added bacon, green onions, and croutons to finished product. This was creamy and good.

Followed instructions and hd to laugh abt comments re: thinness. Learn how to properly use slurry ladies and gents, it's not a science.  FYI onions don't break dwn on their own. Use an immersion blender or strain for proper consistency. I used Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, added a sprinkle or two of paprika and garnished w/green onions. No bacon - NOT a fan. Yes. I know. I'm probably the only person to walk the planet who HATES bacon. LOL It is what it is peeps! Enjoy

Just made a few changes to it. Instead of Worcestershire Sauce I used  a Barbecue sauce. I also added a little Himalayan salt, black pepper, and a pinch of Hungarian Hot Paprika.

I added 3 more T of cornstarch for a thicker soup and sliced kielbasa sausage.  Saved to favorites!

Love, love, love this!! I have made it several times and tastes very similar to one of my all time favorite restaurants which unfortunately has closed! Only thing is I do add more cheese and a little more beer and when I am feeling creative, I've actually diced up fresh garlic, mushrooms and onions and fry them up before adding as well!  My family's favorite! ?

It did have a pretty strong beer taste, but it was just shy of being too overwhelming. I just used the stuff my dad drinks, a brand called Third Shift. I added about a cup of extra cheese because I thought the flavor was a little heavy on the beer and a little light on the cheesiness. It was really hard to tell if the cheese was all melted or not because the soup was very opaque, but even though I came across a couple pieces that weren't totally melted when eating, it didn't affect the flavor. I used not quite 1/3 cup of onion and that seemed to be plenty. I didn't have any of the problems with runniness or gritty texture that other people mentioned, but I used my mom's suggestion on preventing this. I took a cup of the hot soup and poured it into the bowl with the cornstarch and water, mixed it, and then poured that mixture into the main soup pot and stirred. I'm not sure what this does exactly, but since the end result was thick and not grainy, I probably will use this method again next time I make the soup. We didn't have any bacon, so my mom prepared homemade croutons to serve with the soup. They tasted really great by themselves, by kind of lost their flavor once put into the soup. I'm not exactly sure how she made them, but all she used was bread, butter, parmesan cheese, and garlic salt.

Quite disappointed . The cheese curdled . It was a very good quality extra old cheddar. I had to use the little hand blender to smash everything up to try to make it smooth. Didn't work really well either.

I made this soup tonight. I accidentally forgot to get chicken broth from the store, but it turned out to be an advantageous accident. It solved all of the "runny" problems that previous posters had mentioned. I followed the recipe in every other aspect, except for boiling down the beer to evaporation. I let it boil down for a few minutes and then added the cheese, etc. Tasted divine!

Great base recipe. Turned out the consistency of beer cheese soup I had when I worked at Colonial Williamsburg. I added a little dry mustard spice to give a little kick. And used dark beer because that's what I'm used to.

This was not good at all. Wasn't thick, tasted like watered down cheese mixture. Wouldn't recommend. Should have read the reviews before I made it.

I used Guinness when making this soup and used extra sharp cheddar, as well as, reducing the amount of onion.  This was a huge hit. I doubled the recipe because of the amount of people I had over and I had to fight for my own bowl, Lol

This was delicious and easy-peasy to make! It *is* a thinner soup but it's still very rich and creamy. The beer I used is Stella Artois. I did use an immersion blender to smooth it out (I didn't want the chunks of onion and garlic). I will make this again for sure. I threw some bacon bits and popcorn on mine, but it was delicious without it.

Love this. It's so simple, but so delicious on a chilly fall night. I make this with beer bread as it's also incredibly easy to make. Goes great together.

The only things I changed was that I mixed the cornstarch (flour works okay too from what I've tried) with the chicken broth. It seemed to thicken it just fine.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious!  I topped it with crushed croutons and crumbled bacon and it was really good.  I did one thing different, however.  After reading the comments about thickening, and since I'm a newby at this kind of thing, I added the cornstarch slurry and thickened it before I added the cheese and cream.  It worked out fine and as I said, was just delicious!  Thank you, Debbie Rowe!

Very good- very easy. I followed the last review posted and added the cornstarch mixture to thicken, then the half&half and cheese last- and until melted- not boiling.  It makes sense not to boil the half&half- much creamier that way.

I made this recipe as written and it was pretty good... Not quite cheesey enough for my tastes so I added an extra cup of cheese.  I used Goose Island 312 beer and (with the extra cheese) it turned out great!

was soo excited to make this soup, but very disappointed with the outcome.  I had no problems with the consistancy but the flavor was terribly bland. I would definietly use a dark full-flavored beer next time.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I think the corn starch issue others have mentioned may be due to old corn starch. Corn starch can go bad easily. I added freshly ground pepper, extra cheese, and homemade sour dough croutons on top.

Very yummy and easy to make (especially for a novice cook such as myself). I used Foster's beer rather than a light version and that seemed to be really great for the flavor.

I wish I would have tried a different recipe. I read about 15 of the reviews, and took the advice of others. I added extra seasoning, and added in the cornstarch correctly. However, this recipe came up short. Very disappointing. The flavor just missed something, and the consistency was not great either. I am happy that others had success at this recipe, but for me, it was a flop and I have been preparing meals for 30 years.

Excellent and very cheesy.  It was super easy to make and took a very short time.  I served it with some home made bread.  My cornstarch/water mix congealed when I added after the stock but before the half and half (as another reviewer suggested) so next time I will try either doing the recipe exactly like it says or a different way to thicken it.

I don't really follow recipes, but I used this as a jumping off point for a soup appetizer and it worked out great! I even made a smaller pot for myself for lunch the next day (except with some old cheap wine I had left in the fridge), and it worked great. Used flour and butter to make a rue to thicken it, because it's what I had on hand, and a mixture of sharp and mild cheddar to keep away some of the bitterness of sharp. Very good.

This being the first time Ive made Beer cheese soup, it was pretty tasty. I used Stella Artois, and it had a strong taste. Ill use 1/2 the beer next time, and I caramelized the onions before adding the beer. For cheese, I used smoked cheddar and that gave a great flavor. And next time, Ill use heavy cream instead of half and half to give a thicker consistency. All in all, it was good.

My husband made this (one of the few times I have ever seen him follow a recipe for anyhting).  I had been hesitant but was very pleasantly surprised.  We decided mid-afternoon on a rainy day we wanted to try a new soup recipe.  IT was incredible how a delicious soup could be this easy and relatively quick to make on the spur of the moment.

In terms of flavor, something was missing. It was too bland and too beer laden for my liking. Too, I like a thicker soup than this recipe turned out to be. I also ended up with cheese granules, despite following the recipe to a "T." I was disappointed to be sure and almost gave the recipe a "2," but I think it has potential if one follows some of the reviewer suggestions.

I gave this recipe three stars..even though when all was said and done it turned out great! I didn't care too much for the recipe "as is" so after I had a few bites, I boiled potatoes, carrots, and 1 chicken bullion cube until tender. I also threw some polish sausage in a pan to heat, and then cut length-wise and sliced small pieces. With all of the extra add-ins, the soup was wonderful!

I used a dark beer...instead of butter or margerine, I used bacon cut in small pieces.  After the beer had time to "burn off" the alcohol, I put the base in a food processor to make the onion and bacon in to very small pieces.  I didn't use any water but added the corn starch to the chicken broth(3 1/2 cups).  Used 4 cups of sharp cheddar, 2 two cup pakages of Kraft preshredded....very good...both of my picky teens ate it up!

We thought this soup had no flavor at all. It was not cheesy, the only flavor it had was from the bacon bits on top. It tasted more like Cream of Beer soup than anything else. I would not make this again without some significant adjustments, just not sure what.

Pretty good soup!  I used flour instead of the cornstarch and mixed it up with the cheese before adding.  I used shredded cheese and mine was not grainy.  It was a little thin, so I think next time I might add another cup of cheese, but other than that it was great!!

Awesome!  Everyone loved this. I added canned veggies to my toddlers bowl and she devoured it.  One noteworthy change...the reason I made this was because I accidentally bought packaged sliced sharp american cheese and was looking for something to make with it. While it doesn't sound as tasty as true sharp cheese - it turned out perfect.  Also mixed the cornstarch/water mixture with the beer to thicken it.

I didn't care for the texture of this soup at all it was very grainy.  If I tried it again I would take the recommendation from others and not use bagged cheese.  The flavor was ok but it just didn't really work for me.

This soup is great! I don't find it too thin. In fact, it makes a hearty, delicious meal. I followed the recipe but made a few modifications: 

4 tblspoons of cornstarch.
4 tblspoons of water.
2 tblspoons of worcestershire.
Substitute soy milk for 1/2 & 1/2.
After adding cheese and milk, wait for soup to boil (don't increase temp). Then add cornstarch + water mix.
Add plenty of fresh thyme and black pepper for increased flavor and color.

You definitely need to add some kind of fresh herb just to make the soup more visually appealing. I used thyme. I bet rosemary or parsely would work well too. Soy milk made a healthier substitute for 1/2 & 1/2 and is not as thin as skim milk. Also, I used 12 oz. of pre-shredded sharp cheddar. It melted well and was just enough cheese. Doubling that amount, like some suggest, would be too much.

I agree with many of the reviews; this recipe was fine, but nothing to brag about.  My soup did turn out grainy; so I put it in blender and pureed it and that took care of the grainy feel.  I plan to keep on searching for beer cheese soup recipes.

Very simple but good.  I did initially have a problem with a grainy soup even though I was using name brand cheese.  I tried a super sharp cheddar from the deli and it was perfect.  I ended up getting a more cheesy tasting soup even though I used less cheese...plus the grittiness was gone.

I'm giving it 2 stars because my friend liked it, but he's a human garbage disposal.  I didn't care for this at all.  I couldn't taste the beer OR the cheese in this...  The cream was overwhelming.  Maybe with a lot more cheese or a lot less cream it would have been ok.

I think this soup is very good.  I just whipped up a batch and did not have any problems.  I also put in the cornstarch mixture before the cream (I used milk) and brought it to a boil as well.  I also substituted Mexican Velveeta to give it some additional 'kick'.  Also, I'm originally from North Dakota and we often use popcorn as a garnish/accompaniment instead of crackers.  Try it!

Very tasty. I was hoping for some more flavors in the seasoning side so that is something I may work on. I felt the beer flavor took over a little bit but VERY GOOD and I will definitely be making it again!

I like this soup quite a bit and wanted to share the ways in which I've been succesful lightening it up. I use 1 cup fat-free half-and-half and one cup regular half-and-half. Likewise, I use 1 cup light cheddar and one cup full-fat. I also think beef broth makes more sense in this recipe than chicken. Next time I'm going to follow other reviewers' suggestions and use more cornstarch because it is a bit thin.

Well, I'm impressed!  Thank you for the recipe!  I must admit I was searching for this type of base for a soup, but I wanted other ingredients too, so I improvised.  For the most part, I followed the entire recipe, but I substituted evaporated milk for the 1/2 n 1/2, and I used a pound of Velveeta instead of the cheddar.  Then, I added: about 2 C. leftover cooked chicken cubes; a 1/2 c. chopped celery; 3 chopped red potatoes; 1 peeled, cored, chopped apple; a dash or two of nutmeg; and a dash or two of cayenne; a TBS. or two of dried parsely; and some fresh ground pepper.  YUMMY!

This soup was not bad.  I added extra cheese, but the cornstarch called for in the recipe was fine.  It thickened right up.

I changed the recipe a bit since no one in the family drinks light beer all i had on hand was Stout. I used 2 cups extra cheese and it was wonderful!

Not enormously flavorable but ok.  Needs about 1/2 cup more cheese!

I read the past reviews, and that is why I decided to make this dish.  I was not impressed at all!  The cheese did not melt probably, and my husband and I did not like the taste.  I'm glad to see that other people had better results
