OUTSTANDING! I didn't use the phyllo crust, but used a ready bake graham cracker crust. Everything else stayed the same. This cheesecake presents and eats beautifully. Delicious!

This cheesecake was WONDERFUL! I made it for 4th of July and ended up having to make another the following day by request. This was my first time using phyllo dough & it was well worth it; everyone commented on its wonderful taste & uniqueness.
*The only thing I changed was making a flag design rather than the blueberry star. To make the flag I used blueberry preserves, strawberry preserves, and piped the stars & stripes out of cool whip.

I made this for July 4th '05 and everyone loved it!  I accidently bought puff pastry sheets instead of phyllo dough.  I didn't use any butter, but used 2 sheets of puff pastry.  I laid them 45 degrees apart in the 9 in. pie plate so I had an 8 pointed star.  It was a very cool effect, but use non-stick cooking spray or butter in the bottom of the pan.  Thanks!!  I'll make this again.

I needed a very special birthday cake for the 4th of July.  Doubling the recipe and baking in a deep springform pan, I outlined a large star in blueberries, then stacked slices of strawberries in the center, topped with jelly.  Baking time was increased to one hour, definitely put tinfoil cap around crust when baking that last hour.  I think this recipe will become a July 4th tradition!

This was so easy and so tasty!  I didn't have time to let the phyllo dough thaw, so I used a pre-made graham cracker crust instead and it turned out just fine.  The hardest part was making the star on top of the pie!

Once in a great while I add a recipe to my permanent collection. This is one of them. What a fantastic recipe. Very delicious and quite simple to make even though it can appear intimidating. Don't make it with anything but the phyllo dough crust - it's part of what makes this a stunning dessert. Come to my house every July 4th - this will be on the menu!

This was my first attempt at a homemade Holiday dessert. I usually have watermelon and ice cream. I opted for something different and boy was this a hit. I had very little difficulty in preparation and the reward was well worth the effort.

I made this for a 4th of July picnic and it was the most popular dessert there.  The crust is a unique touch.  I substituted raspberry jelly for the strawberry jelly, since I didn't have strawberry on hand.

This cheesecake pie was a smash hit at the July 4th celebration I brought it to!  It will be an annual fixture from now on.  Take the time to make the phyllo crust, it's worth it!

This was awesome! I did make a couple changes.. I didn't have time to get phyllo dough, so I used a graham cracker crust which was delicious, and I accidentally added 2 cups fresh blueberries into the mix itself.. I was very worried that it would come out bad and not sweet enough, but it was delicious!

This was a huge hit for July 4th.  Super easy and adds a festive look to your table.  Family requested it again the following weekend.  The crust is worth the extra effort, but I don't recommend it if you aren't eating the pie same day.  It becomes a little chewy.

Amazing! The filling was extremely good. This was my first cheesecake so I didn't use phyllo dough. Instead, I used the ready-bake graham cracker crust at the store.

The filling was amazing, but I didn't like the crust.  Got soggy and chewy.  Think it would have been so much better with a traditional Graham cracker crust

Super Easy 4th of July hit! Used ready-made graham cracker crust and followed the rest of directions exactly. With fresh blueberries this was so easy to whip together and absolutely delicious!

This pie is AWESOME!  Not only does it have a unique crust, I didnt have ONE person at the 4th BBQ who didnt like it.  I made two more the next day: one for my husband and one for him to take to work.  Needless to say, they devoured it.  As long as you make the recipe exactly as it reads, it will come out perfect.  Happy Eating!

This tasted delightful and was very easy to make. I made it with a scratch graham cracker crust because I love graham crusts with cheesecake and i had the crackers on hand. The fresh blueberries gave the filling such a nice fresh, fruity taste. Everyone enjoyed at our 4th of July celebration. Thanks for another great cheesecake Eleanor! =)

I make this every 4th of July and it's always a huge hit.  So good. The whole point is the phyllo dough, so if you don't use that, you're really just making a regular cheesecake.  I usually don't have the time to thaw the phyllo but it works out fine even though I end up with a flaky mess during prep.

I made this early to be sure I could do it.  AMAZING SPECTACULAR!! I can't wait to show it off for looks next week and have people eat it for taste LOL.  Talk about FOODGASMS! Thanks SO much.  Melissa  

P.S. Phyllo makes it all the extra wonderful that it is meant to be.  Puff Pastry as a sub makes it a "good" dessert in a pinch, but not recommended once you've had it the right way.  :O)

Such a fun and yummy cake! Took it to a 4th BBQ and had so many compliments! Thank you. The only difference was i used frozen Marie Calenders pie crust, I could not find the phyllo sheets. Still wonderful but i would have perferred to follow the recipie exact.

I used packaged frozen Marie Calender's pie crust instead of the phyllo dough because of time.  It was great!  The blueberries in the pie itself were a nice touch.

We did enjoy this, but I prefer a creamier cheesecake and the taste seemed kind of custard-y to me.  I used a combination of low and non-fat cream cheese, so maybe that was the problem.  I also used a graham cracker crust and rasberry jam which worked fine.  I found that it was better the second and thrird day.  I will try this again with full fat cream cheese.

The cheesecake was delicious!I couldn't find the phyllo dough, but I used graham cracker for the crust. I also substituted the strawberry jam for cherries, and used no blueberries. This is the best (and easiest) cheesecake ever!

Yumm! Made this in the hopes of impressing my boyfriend's parents...it worked! I never usually "bake", as I prefer the flexibility of cooking..but this was SO easy and SOO good! I cheated and used a graham cracker crust bought from the store as I was in a hurry, but it was still delish!!

I made this for the Fourth this year and its was wonderful!  I love the blueberries in the cheesecake.  My crust got a little overdone so I will start checking it at the 4 minute mark next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will definitely make again.

Great recipe and easy to make! Used it twice over the July 4th weekend with rave reviews. Will definitely use this as the base for other cheesecake desserts - maybe put cherries on top or mix in raspberries instead of blueberries. I used 1/3 less fat cheesecake and added more than 1 cup blueberries to the batter and it was delicious!

This was a terrific recipe! I wouldn't change a thing except to put some pie weights in the crust as you are cooking the crust itself.

This was my first crack at from scratch cheesecake. It was SUPER easy, and the phyllo crust was awesome. I made the crust/cheesecake part the night before, and then topped it right before my event, but the refrigeration made the crust a tad soggy around the edges. Not ruined by any means, but Ill definitely make it the day of next time. It was a huge hit & super tasty. I used strawberry preserves instead of plain jelly, and loved it.
