These are pretty addicting cookies! I cut back about a 1/4 c. brown sugar and maybe a 1/4 c. white sugar, and they were still plenty sweet. I also added about 1/4 tsp. of cloves and 1/2 tsp. ginger! This was a good move because it gave the cookies a good spiced taste. I think I may have added too much pumpkin, but I liked the way they turned out- there was probably 20 oz of puree. I just rolled them into balls, flattened them just enough to stay put on the pan, and baked them for about 12 min. YUM! It makes a LOT of dough, so I also made a cookie bar- I baked it for 20 min. first, cut the bars, and baked them an additional 5 min.

Love these cookies!!So very moist and just the right amount of pumpkin and spices. (I did add 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.)My husband and daughter said they ranked up with their favorites. I will make them again and again.

These cookies are fantastic.  I used pumpkin pie spice in place of cinnamon.  I also added raisins.  Next time I think I'll try 3 cups flour and 3 cups oats.  This does make a LOT of cookies though so you might want to cut this recipe in half.

Very cake like. Make sure to keep those tablespoons small when baking since they donâ€™t spread, they just fluff up.

These cookies are phenomenal. They are moist and perfect. Use a REALLY big bowl to mix in or you will have too much batter and too little bowl. I added a few more chocolate chips and put candy corn on top to make them more festive!

These turned out fantastic!  I took them to a party and they were the first dessert to disappear.  Chewy and full of flavor!  I halfed the recipe, still using a full egg, and they turned out wonderful.  I will definitely be making these again.

The correct baking time is 18 minutes. The cookies were still raw inside after only 12 minutes. Also, I have found that they should be allowed to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before removing them to the racks. Otherwise, since they're so soft, they break easily.

This turned out to be one of the best cookies I've ever made.  Huge batch, tons of flavor, perfect for taking to any holiday cookie exchange!  I read everyone's suggestions and ended up using white chocolate chips.  I also used extra oats to counter some of the stickiness.  Plus added nutmeg, ginger, small amount of cloves.  Wish I had written down how much of each but I believe it was 1 tsp of nutmeg and ginger and half tsp of cloves.  I also upped the amount of cinnamon by about a 1/2 tsp.  This is a really hard recipe to mess up.  Just add spices to your own taste.

Great recipe! As others suggested, I added more cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg and they turned out perfect! The pumpkin is not overwhelming which is good.  UPDATE: I did 2 more batches today, with WHITE chocolate chips it is even better!!!

AMAZING! These are the best cookies, I have ever tasted! Instead of using chocolate chip in all of them since they make about 5 dozen, we used half of the cookie dough with no chocolate chips and the other half with chocolate chips! Worked perfectly and tasted amazing. I reccomend this to everyone, perfect for the holidays.

Family LOVED it!  They are even better the second day because they stay nice and soft.  Added Nutmeg and used half white chocolate chips & half semi sweet.  This is a keeper.

These cookies are awesome.  They don't last long in my house and we're not even cookie people.  I did cut the recipe in half to 30 servings which gives you about 3 dozen cookies.  I put the rest of my pumpkin in the freezer for the next batch.  Oh, and I cook them for 13-15 minutes.  They don't brown too much, but don't over bake.  Check the bottoms for a light browning, but not your usual chocolate chip brown.  That would be too much and make them too dry.  I did make some modifications based on past reviews:  1 cup of solid pack pumpkin, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips (the cookies aren't too sweet so I didn't like the semi-sweet chips), 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup walnuts.  The cookies are easy to make, so try it!  Let me know how you like the modifications :-)

Wonderful recipe! Excellent pumpkin flavor.  I decrease my flour to 3 1/2 cups to get a denser cookie.  Other than that, followed recipe exactly and so pleased with results. Makes the house smell wonderful when baking.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing.

This recipe has been in our family for years, we make them several times in the fall. The only thing we do differently is to bake between 13 and 15 minutes.  Sometimes we use raisins and chocolate chips,(whatever ratio we feel like), and sometimes we just use raisins instead of chocolate chips.  The cookies should come out moist, and if they seem dry then they are over baked.

These are tasty, but as the description says, the pumpkin flavour is quite subtle. For those who prefer a stronger pumpkin flavour, I'd suggest the pumpkin chocoloate chip cookies III recipe.

Very good!  However this recipe makes a lot of cookies!  We kind of got tired of them.  I would suggest cutting the recipe in half unless you want to make a lot :-)

Yummy! I'd never tried a pumpkin cookie with oatmeal in it before, but mixed with the natural cakiness of regular pumpkin cookies, it creates a great texture. It's true that the pumpkin flavor isn't all that strong, but it tastes as good as any similar recipes I've tried. I took some reviewers' advice and added some ginger, nutmeg and cloves to mine. Be warned that these really don't spread much at all, so don't make your mounds too big or you'll just wind up with a dough ball!

I feel bad only giving this recipe two stars, but i just did not like them.  I make a bunch of different cookies every year to give out for Christmas, and i tried these for the first time, and i disliked them so much that i didn't dare give them out, they made a lot.  My boyfriend disliked them as well, though my 9 year old like them.  They just weren't sweet, which surprised me considering the amount of sugar added.  They were almost biscuit like.  They were simply boring, not a lot of flavor, and not sweet.  I won't make them again.

Made to recipe.  Not terribly impressed.  The chocolate chips are overwhelming, barely any pumpkin flavor comes through at all.  Great if all you want to add is the word "pumpkin" to your Christmas cookie cooking.  Not bad, but also not very pumpkinish.

This is a unique cookie. The flavor was good but cooks up soft like cake. They stick together if you bag them, beware.

These were great moist cookies.  However, I found some "cinnamon chips" before Halloween, and used them instead of the chocolate chips.  (I'm not real fond of chocolate I'm sorry to say).   I reduced the amount of cinnamon called for in the recipe tho.   Everyone loved them, however, I haven't been able to find the Cinnamon Chips again.......I thought it was by Hershey, but I must be mistaken.

I had a really hard time baking and storing these. Loved that the recipe made 80 cookies which was perfect for my work cookie exchange but I was disappointed in the fact that it took at least 15 minutes to bake and they were still very moist. I am all for a moist cookie but they were so moist they fell apart when I tried to store them. I allowed them to cool for a few hours and then put them in a tupperware bin. the next day they were all stuck together. I thought the cookies were very tasty but they do not travel/save well.

I followed the recipe exactly, and got good reviews from my guests. However, I thought they tasted a little raw and flour-y inside. I started cooking my 3rd batch a little longer, more like 15 minutes--but still found them to taste a little too dough-y for my liking.

This is now my absolute favorite cookie!  Made these for Thanksgiving.  I added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, but other than that followed recipe exactly.  This makes a LOT of cookies.  As I was adding the flour mixture, the dough became too much for my mixer (not enough room in the bowl so the dough was coming up over the top of the beater), so I took the bowl off the mixer and stirred in the remaining flour mixture and chocolate chips with a wooden spoon.  Used a tablespoon measure and dropped onto cookie sheets.  As another reviewer commented, these do not spread out much,  if at all, so I did press down on the dough balls lightly with the back of a spoon to flatten them just a little bit for more even cooking.  I found 11 minutes to be the perfect length of time in the oven.  Texture is somewhere between a cookie and pumpkin bread or cake, which I really liked.  The taste is delicious, and they stay nice and moist for days!!  I will DEFINITELY be making these again!!!

Loved it! i used only a cup (2 sticks) of butter in an attempt to be a little healthier, 3 cups of sugar though.. i know.
but they turned out just great! Nice and fluffy. i don't know why people are giving poor reviews for these when Tami clearly says they are "cake-like" cookies. However i take a star away b/c they need more spices than the recipe says (i used 2tsp cinnamon & 1.5 tps pumpkin seasoning)
Also i'm considering adding heath bar chunks next time..

Very good! I used raw sugar instead of regular sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of 2 tsp cinnamon per someone elses suggestion of using pumpkin pie spice. They were a huge hit!

Definately needs more than just the cinnamon...they're good but a bit bland and the oats overpower the pumpkin taste.  They do not spread out at all and I had to adjust the baking time to get them to solidify completely.

I have been making these since I clipped the recipe from TOH magazine in 2002.  If not over baked (I do 10 minutes), they are so moist and one of my favorte cookies.  I always like to add additional spices to any pumpkin recipe, so I'll add some ginger, nutmeg and clove.

These cookies barely had any pumpkin taste at all! They also would have been better with about a half cup more chocolate chips. I had to throw away a cup of batter as there were no chips left. I felt like this recipe was a waste of ingredients.

These cookies melt in your mouth. Everyone loved them! The only changes I made were I halved the recipe and still used 1 egg, used 1 teas. pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and used mini chocolate chips instead of regular. I ended up with 38 cookies.

Ive tried many Pumpkin-Chocolate chip cookie recipes and this is by far our favorite. I'm not sure if its the texture of the added oats but it is different then the others. ( I added a little extra pumkin. Its great if you if you like your cookies super-moist)

I did half this recipe, with a whole egg, and used about 1 1/2 cups of fresh pumpkin since I had it on hand. I made this into a cookie bar using a 11 x 16 jelly roll pan and cooked it for 20 minutes. These are EXCELLENT!

A wonderful cookie! A few alterations that I made that I think made it a little better (if that is even possible...):

I added the following:
1 tsp ginger
1 tsp ground cloves
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp allspice

Additionally, I substituted half of the chocolate chips for an equal amount (by volume) of cinnamon chips (Hershey's makes them). You would think that it would have a little too much cinnamon, but it is a nice contrast with the chocolate.

These cookies are amazing!  Not too long ago I made them for a Thanksgiving get together here and people started gobbling them up like crazy and one person liked them so much he requested a little baggy of some to take home afterwards. I thought both the spice and sweetness levels in these cookies were perfect, not too bland and not too overpowering. The only thing I would warn someone about is that they came out super moist and a little "cakey". I loved them like that but I know it's not some people's cup of tea. Thanks for the recipe, they're one of the best cookies I've ever made!

I didn't like the texture of these cookies that much.  More like a cake than a cookie. I added 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and that made the flavor linger a nice long time. They were a bit too sweet for my taste though. I will see how everyone else likes them and if I make them again I would cut back the sugar and add some pecans.

These cookies were excellent. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out nice and fluffy.  My family raved about them. I thought that the pumkin flavor was perfect. I did add raisins to one batch (because boyfriend loves raisins) and those were also very tastey. Thanks for this great recipe.

I had been bringing pumpkin dog treats to work to share with my employees' dogs and they started tasting them.  I promised them I would make something for them but did not really have an I idea.  I was not sure about the mix of pumpkin and chocolate chips but tried this out and  . . . . 60 cookies was NOT enough to go around.  You do need a LARGE bowl to mix in.  My largest still made a mess in the kitchen but everyone loved them

Flavor is a 5 star, baking them & the soft/mushy result is a 1. These are extremely sticky & just fall apart when you pick them up. I upped the cooking time to 16 min & thought they were going to be great, but they're just mush this morning. I only ended up w/about 30 cookies because of all of the tinkering I had to do to get these to cook. Won't be making these again-sorry:(

I added 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and about 1 tsp ground cloves, halved the cinnamon, and subbed white chocolate chips.  They're delicious and getting raves from the office!

These were good.  The oatmeal was a interesting choice with the pumpkin.  But my boys don't chocolate chips so I added butterscotch chips instead and they were equally delicious!

This recipe makes an unreal amount of cookies, but they're sooo good. I made them to go in gift tins at Christmastime, and got so many compliments on them, as well as people asking for the recipe. I'd change the recipe next time to make far fewer cookies, however. It makes so many that you get sick of eating them after a while.

These were good, but definitely not worth 5 stars.  Something was missing in the ingredients such as nutmeg or the pumpkin spice as others suggested. And boy did it make a lot of cookies.  I had so many I had to send some to work with my fiance just to get rid of them.

These were really good - I made them with white chocolate chips.  The problem with them is they didn't flatten in the oven, so I had to press them flat w/a spatula half way through cooking.  They tasted great, though.  I'll try them again next year.  I'll add a little extra of the spices, too.

This recipe is surprisingly good. I love all things pumpkin, but i was hesitant to try this. I loved it and so did all my friends. If you want quick, easy, and delicious cookies, make these. Note: this recipe yields alot. I doubled the recipe and i make over 100 medium sized cookies

My husband equates these with pringles.  You can't have just one.

I have never had pumpkin chip cookies.  They are really fun to make, and they are nice and soft.  This does make a ton of dough!  So plan on saving it or baking all night!

I loved them, hubby loved them, son loved them...all around good!

These cookies came out great! I made them for a holiday cookie swap and they were very easy to make. I made 1.5 batches and it yielded around 80 cookies. The only change I made to the recipe was I used Pumkpin Pie Spice instead of cinnamon.

I made these cookies for a Christmas party and they were a hit!  They are so much better than plain ole choc-chip cookies.  They were moist, not too sweet and just plain delicious!  I will be making these more often!

These cookies were delicious, although I didn't find them to be very spicy or flavorful.  I would add nutmeg and maybe some nuts to the next batch.  My batter also turned out very sticky, so if you like more cake-like cookies, I would add a bit of extra flour.  The end result is a wonderful, soft, chewy cookie that is sure to please!

I wanted something different than my usual holiday cookies, so picked this one since it had great reviews.  They are great. I think I'd like them better without the quick oats (just a personal thing).  My mom just came up and tried them and said it may be one of the best cookies she's ever had.  I never would've dreamed the pumpkin and chocolate would've been this great together, but it is. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.

Wow! These were addictive.  I made them with freshly ground whole wheat pastry flour and slightly less sugar than called for. I had to cook them WAY longer than stated in recipe and they were better the next day.  I made them at a Christmas cookie-baking party and everyone raved about them.

These were excellent!!  I added 1/2 teaspoon of Nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon of Ginger and a couple dashes of Pumpkin Pie Spice for extra flavor.  I might even double the Ginger and Nutmeg next time and add a bit of cloves as Im looking for more of a pumpkin pie flavor.  Though I like oatmeal cookies I was unsure of them but these are fabulous!  Mine baked at 13 minutes, nice and golden.  Great basic recipe!

This is a definite keeper!  I like how the consistency is cake-like, but not too cake-like. Very delicious!

Very soft and cake-like. That's exactly how I like my cookies. The pumpkin wasn't overwhelming, which was nice. A great fall treat.

These were really good. They were soft and cake like. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour. I would like to try these 100% whole wheat flour, and see if I can reduce the sugar, without sacrificing taste. Delicious

I love this recipe. I had leftover cream cheese icing from a Pumpkin roll and topped the cooies with it. Yum! Yum!
I took it to work and everyone loved them. Not only did I give them copies but I told them about allrecipes and I think most were going to check it out.

I've been making these for a couple of years now.  They come out just perfect.  My husband likes them better with raisins, so I usually do half and half.

I have been using this recipe for 3 years and haven't changed a thing! It is one of my family's favorite cookie recipes, and I get rave reviews from friends - even those who do not like "pumpkin" desserts! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. I left out the nuts because my super picky daughter doesnt like them. Still the cookies were moist (big time) chewy and delicious!!! Thanks for posting this recipe.
