This dessert is a three-four as written but OFCOURSE it had potential so I took it to another level.  I used two boxes of the pistachio pudding mix to enhance the flavor..one box barely tasted like pistachio.  I also used half milk/half heavy cream when making the pudding.  Such a richer flavor. I finely chopped some pistachios and added those into the pudding.  I prefer homemade whipped cream opposed to cool whip so I did 2 cups heavy cream, 2/3 cup conf sugar and a squirt of vanilla and whipped that for 5 minutes and folded it into the pudding.
People just LOVED it..but I do feel as did my happy eaters..that the chocolate topping wasn't necessary and kinda took away from the great flavors the pistachio and graham craker offered.  Next time(yes there will be) I will just top with some fresh whipped cream.  Do make a day ahead of time so the graham crackers get nice and soft.

Yummmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!  I knew we would like this dessert because our whole family loves pistachio everything!  I did make a couple of minor changes that most certainly improved this recipe: 1) I always substitute real whipped cream for 'frozen whipped topping', and 2) I used chocolate ganach (equal parts melted chocolate and heavy cream mixed together and cooled) instead of 'canned chocolate frosting'.  Additional comments - A) The recipe calls for a whole box of graham crackers, but it only took 2/3 of a box to fit my 9x13 pyrex dish.  B) I served this dessert about 2 hours after I assembled it, which only allowed enough time for the for the graham crackers to partially soften.  Leftovers the next day were much better once the graham crackers had time to completely soften.  C) The pudding layers are pretty thick, next time I'm going to try using twice as many graham crackers to increase the layered look.  This is a super yummy recipe if you like pistachio pudding!

Great recipe! I only gave it 4 stars as I love pistachio pudding but using one pkg of vanilla diluted the pistachio flavor. Next time I make the recipe I will only use pistachio pudding

This is one of my alltime favorite dessert recipes because you can vary the flavors so much. I have used vanilla pudding and added 1 cup of pumpkin to the pudding mixture during the fall,added espresso powder to cheesecake flavor for a "tiramisu" like flavor, and most recently for spaghetti dinner potluck with  friends I created a "spumoni" flavor by layering three flavors- chocolate, then white chocolate mixed with about 1/2 c. of chopped marachino cherries, then a layer of pistachio. It came out awesome and the layers were so beautiful. Also, I to feel sometimes the icing on the top can be a bit overwhelming so instead I just melt about a cup of chocolate chips in the micrwavefor a few seconds and then just decoratively drizzle it over the top of the graham crackers. I always keep extra pudding mix, graham crackers and frozen topping on hand so I can throw this go to dessert together any time I need.

This is amazing!! So easy to make, and it's always the first to go at family gatherings. Thank you so much! It's also easy to switch the flavors up, and I love using chocolate graham crackers.. goes really well with the pistachio.

I followed this recipe almost exactly, except I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site and my entire family enjoyed it very much. However I like more of a pistachio taste so will be using only pistachio pudding next time. This is a very forgiving and fool-proof recipe, and I already thought up many variations I want to try!

This is the quickest and most versatile dessert recipe I've seen in a long time. I've made it three times in less than two weeks and each version has been fantastic! First time I made it, I followed the recipe using half pistachio/half french vanilla - it was very good and it pleased my non-pistachio loving family while still providing a hint of the pistachio flavor I love. The second time I made it, I substituted chocolate pudding and because I'm not crazy about the flavor of instant chocolate pudding (cook and serve chocolate pudding is about 1000 times more chocolatey!) I whisked two tablespoons of baking cocoa in with the pudding and milk and it was really very good. The third time I made this dessert I used two boxes of vanilla instant pudding and surprisingly, the straight vanilla version was exceptional! For some reason, the vanilla pudding/cool whip combo was way creamier than the other flavors. I absolutely LOVE "graham flavor" and I adore a vanilla/graham flavor even more. My family of chocolate lovers were surprised by how great the vanilla was and we all agreed that vanilla was the best so far.  I can't wait to try all the other flavors I've thought of...coconut cream, lemon and double-decker vanilla/chocolate are just a few!

I have made this about 7 times.  My suggestion - DON'T use generic Walmart crackers to make this! I just did and they did not soften as easily & it wasn't as tasty. Tasting the crackers dry should have been my first clue.   I have nothing against generic ingredients but sometimes the result is a little different - like I just experienced.    I always have luck using name brand crackers and I am going back to tried and true HoneyMaid next time I make this.  Overall Super easy & affordable to make. Just Be sure to make it ahead of time so the crackrs can soften.

LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!! Sooooo good! I made it and it was very easy and so good! I used all vanilla pudding instead of vanilla and pistachio pudding. It turned out very well, and it tasted like a real eclair! i will definitely make this again. U should try it!

Delish!  Everyone who has tried it, loved it.  I used 2 packages of pistachio pudding, although mixing the flavors might be just as good.  I have also made it with just vanilla pudding and that was incredible.  Dark chocolate frosting for the topping was easy & very tasty.  Great no bake dessert.

I served this for dessert last night for company and it was a hit.  I too used all pistachio pudding and made it the night before. I've been making this "mousse" for years using it as a cream puff filling so I knew this would turn out well. This is a recipe that MUST be done by hand, measuring cup, a bowl, a whisk, and a spatula is all you need. Over mixing will make it runny. We did find the chocolate frosting a little too heavy so next time I think a chocolate glaze would be better.  A great summertime dessert tho, light and cool.

I reviewed this April 23, 2012 but the review disappeared. I keep all my reviews in my cookbook software.  Here is the original:  I'm not a big dessert person, but I loved this.  Both puddings I used were pistachio because I love the stuff.  I haven't had it for a long time, so I was afraid I wouldn't like the "fake" pistachio flavor anymore, but I still love it. *hangs foodie head in shame*.  Instead of pre-made frosting I made "Hard Chocolate Glaze" also from this site.  Worked fabulous!  And yeah, like other reviewers stated, you really need to let this sit longer than the 20 minutes the recipe mentions.  Leaving it overnight makes sure the graham crackers soften nicely making for better texture.  Love this!

This recipe couldn't be any easier and it went over very well at our dinner party.  I used 2 boxes of pistachio pudding and took the suggestion of others to nix the frosting and drizzle melted chocolate chips across the top.  Definitely better the 2nd day. The only thing that was a bit off was the size pan.  I followed the directions exactly and the graham crackers don't quite fill the entire bottom of the pan called for.  No big deal, though.  I just kind of shoved everything to one side and it worked out fine.

This is soooo YUMMY! I make this every year for St. Patrick's Day dessert and when I make it any other time I usually sub vanilla pudding for the pistachio with equally delicious results. I usually make this a day in advance to allow the graham crackers to soften for easier cutting. Who knew that such simple ingredients coud make such a tasty treat!? :)

This was very good. My step daughter made it.  I just verified that she did it correctly.  It sat in the fridge several hours before serving.  The crackers were soft and easy to cut.  This is a very quick and easy dessert.

Excellent!!  I too used two packages of pistachio pudding and it was delicious.  I also topped it with cool whip and mini chocolate chips instead of the icing.  I think the icing would have made it too rich.  It is a nice light dessert after a very filling meal.

This was good- not crazy fantastic, but good. It was so easy and quick to do. As per the other review, I used 2 boxes of pistachio pudding instead of the vanilla and made a chocolate ganache to pour on top. If you have the time, make this the night before- you don't want crunchy graham crackers!!

this is a pretty good dessert. i would suggest breaking the graham crackers into smaller pieces for a more bite size dessert. i also omitted the chocolate frosting, but rather but a bit of the pudding on top and garnished it with whipped cream from a can. i also put small chocolate chips on the sides (both white and milk chocolate). this added a nice touch. also, if you use whipped cream from a can in the pudding itself, it comes out just fine. just mix it up completely.

Super easy and really good. The pistachio gives it more flavor than the original eclair dessert I've had.

This dessert is the best!  Every time I make it, people always rave about it and ask for the recipie.  It's good when you first make it, but gets even better after sitting overnight.  Plus, it's super easy to make!  I highly recommend it!

We loved this.  I have made it twice, both times with all pistachio pudding and chocolate graham crackers.  I took it to a church potluck and this went over well.  Thanks!

Amazing and so tasty! I used 2 packs of the pistachio pudding, skim milk, and used fat free whipped topping. I did however make Hard Chocolate Glaze from this site for the toppng instead of the container of chocolate frosting. Sometimes I think that canned frosting is very sweet and artificial tasting, so I went with this other topping and it turned out perfect. Will make again!

I made this exactly as written. It was really good, and couldn't have been easier.  I'm only giving it four stars because it wasn't amazing or anything, but a nice, yummy, change from the usual dessert.  It went over well at the church pot luck.  My suggestion is to make sure you let it sit in the fridge for at least 5 hours so the graham crackers can soften up if you want a tue eclair-like consistency.

I was not very pleased with this at all! I don't know what I did different from everyone else but it certainly didn't set-up well enough to be served like the picture. We had to spoon it out so it was just a big glob on the plate.  Tasted really good but certainly not eye appealing. Not a recipe I will try again for sure.

I'm sure this would have turned out better if I would've remembered to fold the cool whip into it.  For some reason I forgot that step, and was wondering why there wasn't much filling to spread onto the graham crackers.  So it ended up just being pudding between graham crackers, with frosting on the top, but it tastes ok.  Next time I'll have to remember the cool whip!  :o)
