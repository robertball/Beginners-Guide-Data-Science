Made it almost exactly like the recipe stated, super easy on the first try. All I added was a dash of paprika and a little extra salt. One note, the amount of milk you add will heavily depend on where you live, altitude, and humidity. I live in a dry, high altitude location so even though I halved the recipe, I used over a cup of milk to get the right consistency. The people that complain of a thin sauce either live at very low altitude or their roue wasn't cooked enough when they started adding the milk and cheese. Also, grainy mac and cheese is the result of adding the cheese too quickly. To ensure a smooth texture, add it slowly and melt completely before adding more, which the recipe didn't explain. If it's too thick, add more milk, and if you think it tastes like flour, you didn't cook the flour and butter for long enough, leaving it mostly raw. To remedy that you can carefully cook it for longer or start over.

For a simple macaroni and cheese recipe as the title suggests, this recipe was fabulous!  I'm throwing out my box macaroni!  My son loved this recipe as well.  In the future, I may add some spice or what not but this is an amazing base mac & cheese recipe.

I was starving and discovered that I had just enough milk, cheddar cheese, butter, and elbow macaroni at home. So, I thought I should be able to make a quick mac and cheese.  I found this recipe and was delighted that it was so easy and I thought the result was great. It hit the spot!

I changed the recipe a little bit to fit what the kids would like and it came out wonderfully! 16oz noodles, 1/3 C. Butter, 1/3 C. Flour , 1/2 ts. Salt, 1/2 ts. Pepper, 3 C. Milk, and 3 1/2 C. Cheese! Came out beautifully!

I think this is an awesome staple recipe. It can be tweaked for individual preferences. I added onion powder, parmesan cheese and a little bit of cayenne pepper.

My kids have started asking for this over pizza for family movie night! And our 7 year old friend from Australia mentioned that the food at Tucanos Brazilian Barbeque and my Mac and Cheese are the best food she's had in America. I use 1 to 1 1/2 cups of Monterrey Jack Cheese (to avoid annatto food coloring in cheddar), and 1/2 cup or so Philadelphia Cream Cheese. And we use whatever shape pasta we have on hand. Other than that I follow the recipe as written.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly creamy and tasty!  I didn't have excessive cheese sauce like some reviewers, but I made sure that I brought my flour, butter, and milk mixture to a good boil, so maybe that made a difference??

This recipe lacked flavor, make sure you add in extra salt, seasoning, or top with bread crumbs. I've made many homemade macaroni and cheese dishes but the sauce was very runny this time. Not a bad recipe, as Christina said, it is easy to customize!

I changed this recipe a little--used 12oz can of evaporated milk and a cheddar cheese-pepperjack cheese mixture.  I then placed it in a 9x9" greased cake pan, added a smattering of Italian bread crumbs and baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.

I doubled the recipe and added cheddar sausage, garlic salt, cayenne pepper and baked at 400 for about 20 minutes for it to get brown on top.

I added a bit of garlic powder and I used whole wheat pasta and grass fed irish cheddar and my husband almost ate himself into a coma. It was delish and soooo simple. I would highly recommend. If I had more time I would have baked it with bread crumbs and more cheese on top, but it doesn't need that at all. That suggestion is just more for show.

Great easy base to customize.  I always recommend using different cheese for taste. I use white cheddar and four cheese Mexican blend together. I also made another batch with 2 cheese Mexican blend which is cheddar and Monterey Jack.  I added more salt and a bit of organic garlic powder.  Both turned out very good. Consistency is perfect.  Tastes even better as a leftover. Highly recommended this.

Sooo easy, I use the same base sauce for white pasta sauce(minus the cheddar).  For anyone who says their sauce is too runny, you need to cook your sauce until it is bubbling and thick.  Definitely needs much more seasoning like garlic powder, paparika or cayenne or even chipotle, and plenty of salt.  Always add a little and then taste.

Great basic recipe. If you want more “flavor”, use sharp cheddar.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe. We had some leftover ham and white wine, which I added to my batch. My late father was a professional chef, when it was totally uncool to be one, and he always said, keep it simple. This will be one of my staples, I love pasta. I believe seasoning is a personal taste , but the base is perfect. I'll add some parsley when we will eat it. Cheers, Stefanie

Maybe there is a typo in the amount of pasta? An 8 oz box of uncooked macaroni is not nearly enough for the amount of cheese sauce, I had to use a whole 16 oz box ( the more common size) to have the proper pasta to sauce ratio. Also needs some more seasoning in my opinion

I've made this twice. The first time I cooked an entire 16oz package of pasta by accident and planned to only use half once it was ready. I found it so wet that I ended up using all of it. The basic cheese sauce is good and it tasted fine with just folding the pasta in without baking it.

The second time I made it, I added some parmesan into the sauce, and put the works into a 9x12 baking dish. More parm on top, baked it at 350 for 30 minutes so it would brown on top. Kids (ages 9 and 6) gobbled it up both times. I put a bunch of Franks Red Hot on mine. Very good roux recipe, lots of room to personalize this dish.

This recipe is almost exactly the same basic recipe I've used for years.  As is, it's a little plain and bland but younger children love it.  Nowadays I add spices like garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika and a couple tbsp brown mustard.  I like to add diced ham and peas or diced chicken and broccoli, top with buttered bread crumbs mixed with grated parmesan and bake until top is brown and bubbly.  Combine with a salad for a complete meal.

Well, it did say "simple".  And that's what it was.  No frills, but helped me with the basic ratios of (raw) pasta to cheese to milk.  My wife thought this had too much cheese, and it WAS a cheesey mouthful the first day, but, for no reason I can think of, it did not seem so when reheated the second day.
    This is like a recipe for white sauce: You need the ratio, then it's up to you.  Many possible variations.

This recipe was sooooo easy!  My husband raved about it and ate almost the whole thing.  Just printed out the recipe to save in my own personal cookbook and make it for Easter with our ham.  Thanks for an non-baked recipe, deliciousness!

I am eating it right now as I speak or type this tbh. I don't cook very often but upon making this, despite the fact I couldn't use black pepper as if I couldn't find it in my kitchen it is a bit bland but I could add something to it. Overall, this recipe really is easy to make and I'm glad I was able to make it at such a late of time at night without worrying about taking forever.

I didn't have 2 cups of cheddar, so I used "4 cheese Mexican blend."

I added a few dashes of Lowry's to the flour mix.

I added a can of diced Tomatoes/green chiles to the mix.

I added a few handfuls of crushed Ritz crackers to the mix. 

I got 2 big thumbs up from the girlfriend!

Was tasty but way too much sauce for only 8 oz of noodles.  Will pour sauce over noodles next time and save extra for later.  I made the mistake of pouring my noodles into the sauce and it was like soup!  Had to strain it when serving.

This is a simple and creamy basic mac and cheese! I used light Velveeta and 2% milk w/ great results. Very easy to put together, and a nice recipe to customize to your own tastes. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

As baker admitted very simple recipe.
 To get it a little closer to the expensive restaurant recipes I added a few ingredients. 
A tablespoon of yellow mustard and dash of onion powder  to the cheese sauce adds a kick to the recipe.
 After assembling I placed in a greased casserole dish and I sprinkled on some italian breadcrumbs and paprika ( smoked even better) then placed in a 350 oven for 10min .
 YUUUMOOO!

This is very good.  Probably would be better with a mix of cheeses rather than just cheddar but it comes together very quickly. Added a dash of ground mustard - does not make it spicy, just adds some depth.

I doubled the recipe, added a bit more cheese, took directly from large pot on the stovetop,  placed in a baking dish, sprinkled with breadcrumbs and some shredded cheese, baked at 350 degrees until top was browned.  It was delicious and received many complements. I would definitely make this again.

I doubled the recipe and changed it into a 4 cheese mac and cheese using Monterey, Colby, mozzarella, and mild cheddar. I seasoned it with some garlic and onion powder as well. My boyfriend and I had a disagreement on the sauce, he claimed it was just right and I claimed that there was too much sauce and not enough noodles. So we negotiated and I made a small pot of noodles and did 1 part mac and cheese, and 2 parts of the plain the noodles for a perfect combination in my bowl of mac and cheese. Will definitely make again and possibly work sharp cheddar into this dish.

I make almost every macaroni recipe with added Parmesan cheese, this one included. I added just 3/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese to the cheese mixture and mixed slowly until it was melted in with the cheddar, and added it to the strained noodles in a larger pan. 
I also did not have enough elbow pasta, so I ended up using shell pasta as well. It tasted good, I would definitely make this recipe again.

This is a very easy recipe for a busy school night.  My kids loved it and asked for the leftovers in their lunch box. I steamed some broccoli and the adults added the broccoli to the the mac & cheese.  Great recipe!

I liked it for it's creaminess. Next time I make it I may add more shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I also added onion powder and granulated garlic which helped. My son tried it with hot sauce on it and liked it. I may also add a can of diced tomatoes to it or try it with salsa. This was super easy and I had all the ingredients, better than the preservatives in boxed c & m in the stores! Used a 13.25 box of whole grain elbow macaroni and used most of it as opposed to the 8 oz size mentioned.

No flour or milk needed!   Just create a sauce with butter and cheese.(I use gutter with cheddar).  Stir in macaroni until creamy.   You can add lobster, shrimp or veggies to make a quick and easy dish for family or guests.

It was delicious.  Very easy to make.  Next time I would probably had a bit more seasoning.  It was a bit too thick so I would probably add more milk or decrease the flour.

Indeed, this is a 'very basic' Mac & Cheese recipe, which (IMO) needs some improvement. As written, you could of had something similar by cooking up a box of Kraft. The next time I made it, I added in a couple of tsps. of yellow mustard.  Also, instead of using the pre-packaged (orange) Cheddar, I grated in (REAL) white Cheddar cheese (Cabot's), and also a good handful of grated Gruyere cheese. I use evaporated milk in casseroles, since it makes for a creamier consistency, and I used the next larger size elbows.  I topped the Mac & Cheese w/whole grain Panko breadcrumbs. I hate to criticize, but this version was a whole lot better than the original recipe.

The recipe is severely lacking in flavor. Additional cheese(s) are required. Luckily with this dish, they can be added after it is done. I used extra sharp cheddar and added asiago and topped the dish with parmesan and some bread crumbs.

Omg this was so easy and tasty! I just threw out my old Mac and cheese recipe! 

I did add 1/2 cup more cheese and substituted 1 cup whipping cream  for 1 cup milk and added garlic powder. Topped with buttered bread crumbs (crushed in zip lock) and under the broiler for 30 sec. 

AMAZING!

As the recipe says it's simple to make and the kids loved it. I've tried dozens of recipies trying to get them to eat home made instead of the packet mix and they usually turn up their noses. I threw in peas and corn to get a bit of veg In it , it's a good base to add whatever you like. Will make it again quick and easy and my three fussy eaters give it seal of approval

This was a perfect base recipe! I used 1/4 tsp black pepper and added in 1/4 tsp cayenne and a couple dashes garlic powder. I was able to use things I had on hand - rigatoni pasta and I subbed in fontina cheese for 1 c. of the cheese because I needed to use some I had leftover. It made homemade mac n cheese pretty easy.

If you want more flavor, definitely add more salt, pepper, whatever you want! This is what I would consider a recipe guide to making Mac and Cheese and then adding more.  I added broccoli and some additional seasonings. Was a hit! My picky eaters loved it. Thanks!

Added green and red bell peppers plus hamburger to turn it into a main dish. Tasty sauce but hard to make, will probably use Campbell's cheddar cheese next time.

I made this last weekend for 2 of my granddaughters.  I loved it! Nice & cheesy!  I did have a lot of sauce, however, I let it sit on the stove for a few minutes and it soaked in. Simple and delicious!

Exactly what I was looking for!  Only problem I had was that there was WAY too much cheese sauce for 8 oz of noodles.  But, that's ok, cheesy broccoli for dinner! :)  Thanks!

I added chopped bacon for extra oomph. I’m glad I did because it gave it some flavour. Perhaps I didn’t put enough salt, only a quick sprinkle instead of the recommended amount. Once I mixed the noodles and the cheese mixture I found it to be too watery/juicy so I put it in a glass baking dish and placed it in the oven for about 15 minutes. My daughter enjoyed it and we’ll try it again soon.

First time making homemade mac and cheese and it was easy! texture was a little different but I knew there was no chemicals in it which is amazing but I would add a lot more cheese in it for flavor.

Really good! We love cheese, but my son felt it was too cheesy. So, I only used 3 tbl of butter and flour. I also used only a little over 1 cup of milk and cheese. It was the right amount of cheese for us. To add a bit more flavor, I mixed in 3 crumbled bacon strips and topped with bread crumbs. Next time, I'll try crushed croutons.  I have used cheddar and cheddar/montery jack cheese on separate occasions and both taste awesome!

I put this in the oven for 30 minutes @ 325 covered after it was cooked on the stove it made a world of difference. The pasta absorbed the sauce and got slightly browned. This would have been a five star if the recipe included this step.

This was delicious! And it works very well with lots of cheeses. I did add some paprika and garlic salt because we love paprika and garlic in our house ... 
This also works well if you want to throw a handful of frozen peas or something in at the end to get veggies in the kids.

I will definitely make this creamy sauce again! I did change a few things though.I added 3 tsp of lemon juice to prevent the cheese from becoming stringy and not melting. It also need just a bit more salt. Other than that its the perfect Mac and cheese sauce

This is hands down one of the best tasting and easiest recipes for macaroni and cheese. My only substitution was the cheese. I used 4 cheeses instead, because I didn't have the cheddar cheese.

I made this a coupe of times, and every single time, everyone I shared it with loved every single bite of it. I played around with it a little bit, adding more cheese and milk to make it creamier, adding different herbs etc. It was an absolute delight each time! Thank you for this amazing recipe.

Loved this!  I did add a dash more salt and about 1/4 cup extra cheese.  I used both Cheddar and Sharp white cheddar.  I've never made a cheese sauce before, it actually really intimidated me.  This recipe made it so simple and I nailed it the first try.  Thanks for sharing.  I'm sure I will make this often.

Sooo delicious!!!  Only difference I made was I added ground beef and doubled recipe! Lol. The secret to the sauce is definitely cook down your flour/butter gently and slowly adding your milk whisking away until thick. Takes about 5 minutes or so then remove from heat and add cheddar! Such silky smooth perfection! Oh and I used jumbo shells only cause elbows weren't on hand. (See what I did there...unintentionally!) way better than blue box! Thanks for such an amazing easy recipe!! ??

Really creamy and super easy. Just be patient with the sauce stir on low until it thickens up -- the timing here is pretty accurate and the sauce thickens in the last few minutes. My only tweak would be to add a pinch of cayenne and fresh chopped parsley.

I give it a 3 because I did not like it, but my son loved it and told me I need to make it again. I thought it lacked flavor and the cheese mixture was too thick. I think less flour and more than one kind of cheese would help this recipe. However, I will make it again for my son since he enjoyed it.

This was very very bland. I used shredded mild cheddar and there was virtually no taste. Added red pepper flakes, black pepper, and garlic powder and it helped a bit but I wouldn’t make it again.

Excellent and easy. All quantities are spot-on and it worked great the first time except the sauce was a bit grainy, so the second time I made a roux with all of the flour, half the butter and enough milk to make a paste. Then I heated up just the milk and stirred-in the roux bit by bit. The result was an ultra-smooth, very creamy sauce.

It’s a simple classic Mac and Cheese. I added a lot more seasonings to bring an extra kick. Personally I love mild cheddar with a little bit of grated Parmesan. Plus a dash of red pepper, cayenne, paprika, and a little bit of garlic salt. All of this together was very tasty.

Quick and yummy. I put the noodles and sauce in a baking dish, sprinkled it with crushed Ritz crackers and chili powder, and baked it for 20 minutes. 10 minutes probably would have been better.

I've tried recipe after recipe for macaroni and cheese--one pot, baked, southern custardy style, all of them, trying to find that elusive "best" macaroni and cheese, and this simple recipe is the best of all. The only tweak I made, to get the best of both worlds, was to make it in two layers with cheese in between the layers and more cheese on the top for that "crusty" effect. Then I bake it till bubbly and hot. Simple is just the way to go sometimes,

Liked it a lot, would love to try it with some pepperjack or Gouda, quick and easy. 

Still experimenting trying to perfect.  1/2tsp paprika, 1tsp pepper and tsp garlic salt, still missing a little something, maybe more pepper.

I’ve never made mac and cheese from scratch before. So I found this one very easy to follow. I did find that I had to add more cheese and that it needed a little something after the fact, but it was easily rectified. Will definitely make this again.

This was delicious! I did not change the recipe. However, because some said it was too soupy and others said it was just right, I did make just 3/4 of a batch of sauce for the 8oz of noodles. This was perfect for my preferences. It had a little extra sauce, but the leftovers do thicken up some and this way it was still a nice texture for reheating. 
The flavor is strongly dependent upon what cheese you use!

I'm sure this could be good. I just feel like the description in the recipe is lacking. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out runny. I felt like it was too much milk, and it never says to bring the milk to a boil. Just have on med heat. Good recipe though, you just have to improvise a little.

Great cheese sauce recipe but needs waaaaaaaaay more pasta then 8 oz. I suggest making at least twice as much last for this recipe or spooning the sauce on top of cooked pasta to personal taste. It was very very cheesy with only 8 oz of pasta mixed directly into the sauce as written above. Otherwise great recipe.

This was really a waste of food. It has way too much flour. 
I am really sorry I made this.

The cheese sauce did not work out well for me this time. I will need to work on this method. Nikolai on October 06, 2017 mentioned a few ideas regarding this recipe that I will try next time.

I really wanted to love this Mac and cheese- it was simple to prepare and looked delicious when it was ready to eat, but my family members all agreed that it was seriously bland. Even my 5 year old who prefers bland food was asking for the salt shaker after her first bite. Maybe it was my fault for using the medium cheddar that I had on hand instead of a sharp variety.

I agree that it isn't exactly the most flavorful Mac & cheese , I did follow the recipe exact ( I like to start with that ) but after tasting I added Seasoned salt & STILL needed more of something... so I added cayenne & Italian crumbs . In the end of the add in's , it ended up better for MY TASTE . Not that kids wouldn't of like it the original way or someone else . Mac & cheese like most comfort foods is personal preference of taste .

Hello! I made this dish and it was amazing!!! I made it for dinner for my family. They loved it!!! I love how creamy this recipe is and how easy it was to make it! I really really love it! The only thing was was that I had a little bit of cheese sauce left. But other than that it was delicious and easy to make!!

Rating this five stars because it was so easy, and so good!  Made it for a new mom (4th baby!) so the fact that it was a little “bland” as some reviews said, was perfect for her family of kids.  You could always spice it up a little if that is your preference, but this is a good, easy, basic recipe.  The directions don’t specify what kind of milk, so I used whole milk.    Just as good reheated!

Thank you, that is how my Mom made mac & cheese, and that is how I have been making it for over 50 years. Why people insist in taking a perfect cheese dish like this, "then" putting it in a baking dish, top with breadcrumbs, and  then  dry it  all out in the oven, is beyond me !    But, that being said, if that is how their Moms made it, it would be their comfort food, so I guess whatever  "you" like  works for "you"  !

It was very creamy, but it was also a little grainy (a bit mashed potato-like). I think I will reduce the AP flour slightly to compensate. Other than that, pretty tasty!

Added a 1/4 Cup bread crumbs.  Took out some cheddar cheese from the recipe, mixed it with the bread crumbs on top before it baked.  Also used corn starch instead of flour.

Yes very good recipe.  I use it all the time.  I use sharp cheddar cheese and follow the recipe up to where you add the cheese.
I don't take time to stand over the stove and stir.  I put everything into my blender and in 20 seconds you have a velvety sauce to pour over your macaroni.  I add some buttered and crushed corn flake crumbs to the top before putting it in the oven.

Very simple, delicious and even my grandchildren could make it. I usually buy Kraft Ma and Cheese and add a can of tuna maybe; or go all out and doo the big mac and cheese bu using 3 or 4 kinds of cheese and bake it. Thank you!

My Mac and cheese turned out delicious, I liked the consistency of the sauce. It was gooey and creamy and very cheesy, we enjoyed it. My only suggestion is to cut the sauce recipe by a third at least because the first time we made it we had way too much sauce for our pasta. I modified it a bit the second time so it wasn’t too too much but I still want to make a little less sauce. Other than that, it’s yummy and easy and I recommend you try it! Here’s mine!

Easy and tasty. We like ours a little thicker so next time I will add less milk.

Love this recipe so much and even my super fussy boys who seem to hate all food like it! This is going to be a staple in our home now. I do find I need to make more noodles than it calls for....but sooooo good!

Every time my family wants homemade Mac n cheese, I end up scouring through online recipes to find one that doesn’t require evaporated milk or something else I don’t have to run to the store for. THIS one is perfect and I just printed it out to stick in my “favorites” spot! Never will I search again. I followed it perfectly and only added 1/4 tsp paprika, and 1/2 tsp each of garlic  and onion powder. The flavor is perfect ??!!! You won’t regret making this super easy recipe!

I thought it was really good, however, I used 900g of pasta instead of 250g, and I added a can of cheddar cheese soup along with the Butter/Flour/Milk/Cheese mixture into the pot of macaroni. Then I baked it on 425F for 15 mins, added more cheese on top and some breadcrumbs and baked it for another 5 minutes. It turned out great! If I could change one thing about it, it would be the flavor. Definitely, have to add spices (Which I did).  Also with the 900g of pasta, I didn't change any of the other measurements, other than the cheese of course instead of 2 cups I used probably 4 or 6 cups.

So basically, I made just the sauce and put it with rice instead because that is how my cabinets are right now, but it was really good. I even accidentaly put a whole teaspoon instead of a half teaspoon of salt in the sauce and it still was really good.  Very easy recipe too. One that I would probably be able to recount if asked again.

As stated, it is simple to make.  Next time I make this, I will add a little extra milk to smooth it out.  Once it cooled down a little, it got clumpy.

I made this one night when desperate for a side dish. Hubby loved it & declared "It's even better than Stouffer's!" Which was a high compliment coming from him (& speaks to how much, er, I mean, how little, homemade cooking I do). A side note: The trivet on my stove says, "I tried to make something from scratch & ended up summoning a demon." But I digress. I added the extra half-cup of cheese & lightly sprinkled bread crumbs on the finished dish. Delish!

I love this dish! I like to add some chopped up curry plant, but curry powder would work just fine! I like to add this to add a bit more flavor to it, since the recipe is a little bit bland.

This tasted so good on its own. I experimented a little, though, making double the recipe but reducing the total milk and cheese by 1/4. After it was done, I put half of it in a casserole dish, topped it with some partially steamed broccoli, then the rest of the macaroni, and finally a topping of Panko and more shredded cheese. It gave it a nice, crusty top and just a little more nutritional value. ;-)

I added garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and a bit of truffle oil!!! I used sharp cheddar, mild cheddar and a fiesta blend. This was a great base recipe that you can easily customize with different additions.

Nice recipe when you're looking for some easy homemade mac & cheese without some 'exotic' ingredients. 

The sauce does get a bit runny, but I think it tastes just as great. Watching the video really helps though, so I recommend that.

This mac and cheese is freakin bomb. 10/10 recommend. Another good option is to add bread crumbs on top. Try it out, you won’t regret it.

This recipe worked out really well! This is the first time that I've ever had a successful, homemade stove top mac and cheese in my life. The only real changes I made was the cheeses (I have many kinds of white cheddar at home so I used a combination) and, instead of 1 1/2 cups of milk (i made a smaller amount so i adjusted the recipe), I used 1 cup mixture of one half whipping cream and one half milk. Sauce turned out beautiful and smooth. Tasted great, too.

This is as per the title, very simple to make. Perfect for kids. 
I wanted to make my one-year old mac and cheese to try, so as there is already more than enough salt for her in the cheese, I missed out the salt added in the recipe. 
For adults, the seasoning is definitely required (I added salt to mine when I served it). I actually also added mustard powder and garlic powder too, and I think without it would be pretty bland as even with the additions it wasn't the most flavourful.
For those saying it was too watery, I don't think they cooked the white sauce long enough as mine was incredibly thick (I actually added more milk!). All-in-all a good recipe to have on file for a quick and easy side meal for kids, but next time, to make it more grown-up, I would top with breadcrumbs, some cheese and sliced tomatoes and throw in the oven to crisp on top too.

Followed the recipe almost exactly. Only difference was that I used Sharp Cheddar cheese because that's what I had at the time. I was very impressed at how good it turned out.

I made this for the first and definitely NOT the last time! This is the easiest Mac and Cheese recipe I’ve made so far. I didn’t have elbow macaroni so instead used medium shells. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written. So yummy and creamy!

Turned out fantastic. Super easy to make. I actually used mild cheddar, sharp cheddar, and mild white cheddar. I didn’t use the correct amount, I used a whole lot more, but followed the rest of the recipe. Turned out so good.

Excellent!  My family members who love mac and cheese AND my family members who have never liked mac and cheese all love it!  I often add chicken to it and a little hot sauce for those who like a little extra flavor.

Made the recipe pretty much as is and added in a lots of black pepper a dash of seasoning salt  for some extra seasoning and more milk to thin it out a little. Overall it was very good, simple recipe and the family enjoyed it. I like quick and convenient and this recipe is exactly that!

This is an excellent and truly easy basic macaroni and cheese. I made it with monterey jack and added a little garlic powder. Then I topped it with cheddar and bread crumbs and baked for twenty minutes. But it would have been perfectly fine without baking it, I just like the crunchy bread crumbs.

Only worked because I read reviewers tips on roux!!
Way too much sauce in proportion to pasta. Also, my sauce was too thick, had to thin a lot. Needed more salt, paprika, and also a touch of veg better than bouillon to give it flavor.

this is so bland. and like cheese glue. it reminds me of what we played with in kindergarten in art class. i love cheese, it is a huge part of my diet - and this was barely edible as original recipe dictates.

i added garlic, basil, cayanne, way more salt and pepper and had to make more pasta to spread it out AND had 1/3 of the "sauce" left over. 

i was skeptical to put 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of cheese knowing how much that would make but gave the recipe the benefit of the doubt. Next time i will just stick to winging it as that alaays turns out great! 10/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND

This is a quick and easy recipe when I want something other than boxed mac n' cheese. It makes more sauce than macaroni, so usually add almost double the amount. Also, it lacks a bit on spices, so I add a bit of dried mustard. But if your palate isn't refined (like mine isn't ;) then I'm sure you will be pleased!

Simple, easy mac & cheese recipe. I used letover pasta to make this weekend meal. I added about 1./4 cup of extra shredded cheese to the top along with bacon crumble for extra saltiness and chopped parsley for colour. In the recipe itself, I always add about a tsp of cayenne to compliment the rich cheesy flavour.  Super easy and delicious.

very bland; really do need to add more liquid; really need to work the flour mixture - the liquid/cheese tasted like flour. A good place to start to know the fundamentals, but move on to your own "feel" for a good tasting, textured mac and cheese

Nice basic recipe that you can make your own additions to. I like to add a variety of cheeses depending on what I have available and am feeling.

This turned out beautifully!  Nice and creamy!  You can certainly tweak this with some additional seasoning for your own taste, but I think it's very good as is!  I had to use gluten free pasta and flour to make it gluten free, and it turned out nice and tasty!

This was good.  My hubby is diabetic and watches calories too so I don't make mac&cheese  but I love it and usually have it when he's away.  I decided to make some to have with ham @ the last minute. It was easy,  quick  and very good.  Hubby liked it too.

This is exactly what it is titled - simple Mac and cheese. Some of the reviews talk about it being bland, but if you are after a quick and easy side dish this serves the trick without the hassle of baking it or adding a crumb. Of course if you want it as more of the main dish I would add extras to it such as a crumb and my usual additions of bacon and mushrooms, but as a side dish I found this perfect as written. I served this alongside chicken with mushroom sauce and broccoli.

A pretty decent simple mac and cheese. It's perfect for a beginner and allows you to season to your own taste. Mine came out grainy when I made it, but thanks to comments I learned that I added the cheese too quickly.

Delicious!  The first time I made it I did not cook the flower butter and milk for the five minutes. Once it thickened up a little I added  1/2  a block of Velveeta  and cheddar cheese. It’s still didn’t taste “cheesy” enough so I added more Velveeta and cheddar.   It was unbelievably creamy and tasted amazing!  The only suggestion  I have is to put quite a bit more salt into the water. It is a little bland if you don’t put some extra salt or pepper on it. A really easy fix.

I halved the recipe.  It turned out creamy and delicious.   I will make it again.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the cheese, I added 1/cup of Mexican soft cheese to the mix because I like the smoothness and tang that it adds to macaroni.

I used a 5 cheese blend instead of the cheddar and thought the sauce was much to thick. I will try it again using the cheddar and see if it is still so thick.

Delicious.  I added a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper, 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese,  and 3 tablespoons of ricotta cheese.  And that is only because I all ready had that on hand as leftovers from another recipe. Everyone in my house gave this two thumbs up.

I always mix my mac and cheese on the stovetop, bake it in the oven, and when it's just done, sprinkle the top with shredded parmesan and dots of butter  and put under the boiler.
Thank you for this recipe. It has taken my mac and cheese to a new level.

I made it as indicated and added more fun spices (California Pepper blend, smoked mozzarella and tomato blend, and smoked paprika) and added a bit more cheese.  Delicious.

I really liked it. At first my pasta didn't look like how they made it but then it turned out really good and looked really similar to theirs. My suggestion is keep stiring because it actually helps. Nice Recipe! Creamy and better than storebought.

I use extra sharp cheddar, and always add A little more milk (1/4-1/2 cup)because I don’t like my sauce to be too thick.
 My kids love this recipe.
It’s a family favorite we make quite often.

Very easy but bland.  I nuked 2 hot dogs, then sliced them and added at the end.  It helped make it saltier.  Next time I’ll use sharp cheddar cheese instead of regular.

While I agree with those that made comments on texture, I am not going to lower my rating.  Having the texture of butter and flour with the addition of milk (then cheese) come out as it should can be tricky, and altitude can make a difference in success and failure; fat content in the milk can also play in.  In terms of it being bland, seasonings are to individual taste.   Though I may make a few modifications next time I make this recipe (adding bacon), it clearly lives up to its name "SIMPLE macaroni and cheese".  In addition, the ingredients when made to recipe, are those that I have on hand at all times.

I used pepper jack for an extra little kick! Don't be afraid to mix cheeses and experiment! I also added some lemon juice too. I also mixes some grated parmasean and bread crumbs and put it in the oven to make a nice crust.

This is perfect! Yes, it is simple and not bursting with flavor. it is macaroni and cheese...  That is why you loved it as a kid, it wasn't too sharp a taste for a sensitive palate.  You can, of course, make it more adult. I added bacon. I plan on adding crab at some point in the future. I also used cheese that I had smoked, that was good too. This is like vanilla ice cream. really the best, but often overlooked, and underappreciated for its own subtle goodness, and as a canvas to add other colors.

The mixture is not really tasty. I made it exactly as the recipie said so, but it ended up tasting like flour and pepper. There needs to be changes, like mabye cut out flour and try with something else, because flour makes your mixture doughy and sticky.

8 oz pasta is not enough for this amount of sauce. I used 16 oz and had PLENTY of sauce. This is a very tasty and easy Mac and cheese recipe. I have made it a couple times. Make sure you generously salt the water you boil your noodles in (1-1.5 tablespoons) or it will be a tad bland. I

This is extremely bland.  My 16 year old son, who prefers simple tastes even said it was bland.  Too bad, I had high hopes because the sauce cooks up so nicely.  Definitely needs more spices, but has a strange texture...I'll keep looking for a great mac and cheese recipe.

The is a great recipe if you want to make a quick mac and cheese side dish. Followed directions are written, was very creamy and had a good flavor, although you may want to add some more salt and pepper. Will make again.

Hi all..  I followed the instructions exact..    I did add paprika and fresh ground pepper.  Yes it wasn't gramma's fresh baked but it was very good and easy.  The recipe also gave you a lot of room to play your own flavor.  I will be making this again and again.  thanks

I tripled this recipe because of the amount of noodles i was making, but WOAH! It made way too much.  I used about half of it. I thought it was delicious but my kids didn’t appreciate it, they are so used to Annie’s Mac and cheese. I’m going to use the leftover sauce for a casserole of some sort.

If I make this again, I’d add less flour and a little more cheese. It kind of had that powdery taste instead of the stringy and stickiness everyone loves. Other than that the recipe worked really well.

Made this with a collection of leftover cheeses I had (sharp cheddar, asiago, colby & swiss). Finished by baking it at 400' for 15 minutes or so in a buttered 9x9 with some bread crumbs sprinkled on top.  Really good. Really easy.

I made it exactly as instructed, but none of my family enjoyed it with pasta. It tasted no different than the gravy we make to go over sausage biscuits on Sunday.  This was a let down, and a waste of ingredients. However, for Sunday morning breakfast, this would be great!

Prepared exactly as written except used medium shells as that is what I had on hand.  Instead of serving straight from the pot, I put the macaroni and cheese in a cast iron pan, topped with a butter / breadcrumb mixture, and cooked in a 375 degree oven for 15 mins or until breadcrumb mixture browned.  The entire family loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great Mac & Cheese recipe! Great as-is or as a base for scores of dishes. Today, I added two tsps Dijon mustard and two tsps cayenne. This recipe is now in my quick reference library. Thanks for sharing it!

Just made this and it was delicious! I  recommend adding a bit more salt, and onion powder if you have it. Also, i found that i had half of my sauce left after already adding a good amount to the pasta. I definitely recommend adding more pasta, but I guess that depends on how much sauce you prefer . Overall great tasting recipe!

The macaroni came out all right, but something went wrong with the sauce. It wasn't smooth like a sauce, and came out a bit burnt and textured. I would have to try it again right another time.

Very easy to make. Added paprika and lots of pepper. I ended up adding a little less milk to keep it smooth and not runny. Will definitely add this to my rotation because it is quick and easy.

As a base recipe, it's good, but very mild in flavor. I made some modifications that enhanced the flavor and a large group of people enjoyed. I used a 3:1 ratio of half and half to milk to make it thicker, on top of salt and pepper, I seasoned it  with garlic powder, paprika, and nutritional yeast for a stronger cheese flavor even though I used extra sharp cheddar. I don't have measurements for the extra seasonings, just kind of winged it as I went and added what I felt like was needed. I also added in a 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella and it gave it an extra bit of creaminess. I had some of the rue mixture left over, but I saved it for leftovers because the macaroni can be a little dry the next day and it helps to add some when reheating.

This is very easy to make and tastes great!  I cut up a few Italian chicken sausages and diced a little bit of onion. Sauteed the sausage in a little oil and added the onion towards the end. Added the sausage onion mix to the mac and cheese.  So good!

Quick, easy and delicious. Added an extra 1/4 cup Colby jack cheese to the mix. Turned out melty and creamy. Everyone loved it. Even my niece, who is a proclaimed mac n cheese expert! 
A must try, especially for first timers.

Best macaroni and cheese ever!  Omitted the salt, as cheese is salty enough.  Added 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Sprinkled a little paprika on top after baking for contrast.  Instead of adding  salt, try sprinkling a little Parmesan cheese on top just before serving.

I made this with  medium cheddar cheese and followed the recipe exactly.  It was okay, but a little too gooey.  My granddaughter, who was eating with me, said it needed a little more flavor.  The cheese was Tillamook, and the milk was Darigold 1%.

This turned out really good for me. Followed the instructions, but I added chopped beef and bacon pieces. I made it in my cast iron skillet, sprinkled the top with some extra shredded cheddar and broiled it to get a little crust on top. The dinner table was quiet that day.

My wife said it could've used more seasoning, and added that some Cheese Wiz could've been an additional ingredient to add more of a punch for cheesiness. Will attempt again one day.

I will definitely make this again!  I read a lot of the reviews and took their suggestions to heart.  I used extra sharp cheddar cheese, more black pepper, topped it with additional extra sharp cheddar and baked it for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.
Delicious!

Recipe was easy to make, but was bland , even though I used extra-sharp cheddar.  I've had two ideas for gussying it up a bit:
1. Add chopped, but uncooked, yellow onions. The texture of the onions, as well as the taste, would add interest; 2. Garnish heavily with chopped cilantro. Next time, I'll try one or the other.

Super simple and delish!  Will def make again.  I added chopped hatch chilis bc I love the warmth and flavor they add.  That takes care of any blandness complaints.

A fine example of why people make those “fancy designer Mac and cheeses”. This recipe has all of the personality of a used white paper bag. My recommendation to myself is to stick to Martha Stewart’s recipe, and quit trying to cut costs.

This recipe is perfect the way it is but if you want more flavour.  Try 1tbs of dijon mustard and a few dashes of ceyennn pepper.

I've been using this recipe for years except I use Sharp White Cheddar and bake it for 30 minutes because that's what my boyfriend likes.  Once you make the roue you can basically add any cheese or seasoning that suits you.  Yum

Funny I got this email today because I had literally just searched and made the Mueller's box recipe (old school from the 60s) and the only difference here is that they add 1/8 tsp of dry mustard as well as the S&P. So my rec is to go a bit heavier on the spices and I mixed "Casserole Blend" cheese from Kroger (about half) with the sharp cheddar. Also, I doubled it because most boxes are 16 oz. (and I used shells which I prefer any way). You can also add dried herbs and I like to crumble up Ritz crackers on the top, and sprinkle more cheese! Fairly foolproof although a bit "wet" -- I like to try all kinds of mac & cheese recipes and always a hit in the home.

For those of you that your kids son like the strong cheddar cheese:  Prepare pasta and drain
In separate saucepan chop up 1 lb Velveeta into pan, add 3Tbs Margarine.  (I use Country Crock).  Fill with milk to just cover cheese chunks.  If desired add 1/2 can of Spam chopped.  Bring slowly to a boil or until thick and creamy.  Pour over pasta.  You can eat as is or bake in oven preheated to 375 for about 15 minutes if you want a crumb topping.

This is pretty dang good for being so easy and minimal ingredients!  I did add a dash of mustard and garlic powder, but I think it would have been fine without it.   So glad I found this nice, creamy, mac and cheese recipe!!

Made as written, very disappointing. No flavor and very runny. Tried to salvage by adding 1c  of extra sharp white cheddar with little luck. Then added 1c of kraft parmesean cheese. Nope. Will not make again.

It is flavorless and grainy. I had to add more salt, more pepper, and more butter. I also added some Kraft parmesan cheese which made it taste so much better. After adding all of these things the dish tasted great. What ruined that though, was the flour. All I could focus on while eating was all the flour I was eating. I could feel it all over my tongue and it ruined the eating experience. Adding flour is VERY unecessary because it doesn't even help the creaminess of the pasta, it make it gritty and gross. It does thicken the pasta but it was too thick. So in conclusion, if yu want to try this recipe use it as a guide, don't follow it word by word and add more ingredients or more of the ingredients if you taste that it's needed.

A good basic recipe, but the amount of sauce can easily cover 3/4 pound of pasta. I'll try it again and add some things in to jazz it up. It's a pretty mild flavor if you don't.

My kids are super picky about their mac and cheese (nothing baked, preferably orange and out of a box). This is the first recipe they’ve both eaten! It seems like it would be easy to doctor this up for the grownups, too, but honestly, the grownups liked it just fine straight up. We will definitely be going back to this recipe. Thanks!

This is exactly what I wanted and it was so easy I may never buy boxed mac&cheese again.  When making the cheese sauce I was careful not to put the heat up to high but I browned the butter just enough to give it a nutty brown butter sauce taste, without burning it. It was perfect! I halved the recipe and stirred in some ground beef that was sauteed with bell pepper and onions.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for except I added a couple shakes of paprika (which ended up being imperceptible anyway). My kids loved it.  Very simple and easy. This is a great go-to recipe and I love that it makes a whole big pot. For the people saying it was runny, I'm sure it was because they didn't cook the roux long enough for it to thicken. It doesn't thicken up until it starts bubbling, so if you call it quits and add the cheese too soon, it will be very liquidy. I thought it could use salt on the plate, but no big deal.  Better than too salty. I would make it again!

I made this a little different from the recipe, I am making dinner for my sister and I so I just used what I had. So, I didn't have enough cheddar so I used a cup and a half of that and a cup of mozzarella. It tasted a little bland at that point so I added a little white pepper and alternated with salt and pepper until I had the flavor I wanted. Absolutely wonderful recipe overall, I will definitely be using this again soon!!

great basic recipe that doesn't require baking; although I suspect it would be great baked if tweaked just a little. I added some cream cheese that I had in the fridge and played with the spices to give it some flare.  will use less flour next time as i did find it had a bit of a flour after taste.

I was looking for a good base recipe. I knew that I would add bacon and finely chopped sauteed onion, plus it was to be gluten-fee. Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely. I used gluten-free macaroni, and gluten-free flour for the roux. I added an extra Tbsp of butter and an extra half-cup of cheese. It turned out well, but I think I needed to cook the roux for another minute or two...it was just slightly grainy.  It was for a church potluck, and even after sitting around a few hours, it was still moist and not clumped-up. Next time, I might add some cream cheese just to experiment a little.

I agree with other reviewers this recipe was very bland. I even added garlic powder and cayenne. I don't think I'll be making this again.

While it's not exactly health food, it's better than boxed and you know it's real ingredients.  This is a go-to for my nannying job. I also have taught kids to make this as young as 9 years old.

I followed all instructions as written with the exception of doubling the amounts of everything.  I've never made homemade mac & cheese so don't have anything to compare to except for "homemade" restaurant mac & cheese...but I found this to be gluey and extremely bland.  My two mac & cheese loving children wouldn't even eat it.  :(

I halved the recipe but I didn't have quite enough macaroni so it didn't come out perfectly.  But it was very creamy and rich.  I agree about it being bland so I added onion, garlic and mustard powders to the flour (I used 1/4 tsp of each in a halved recipe).  I also added a few drops of sriracha to the  smooth milk mixture before adding the cheese.

Today my whole family went out and there is no leftovers, so I was forced to cook. I am 15 and I NEVER touch the kitchen. When I made this, I didn't even measure the ingredients, I just throw the things in the pot and the dish came out awesome. 
I recommend this for those who cant cook because little can go wrong and it actually tastes good.

My family loved this.  I added a bread crumb topping and then baked it in the oven for 15 minutes, broiled it so the topping would brown for 5 minutes.

Great recipe and so simple. Most importantly, my kids actually ate it!! It came out a little too thick though, so I added more milk as I folded the macaroni into the sauce

Good. I added Italian bread crumbs to the top and baked for about 20 min. That added some flavor. Otherwise I think it might have been too bland. Its a good easy basic recioe.

This was tasty! I changed it a little. I put the finished mac and cheese in an 8x8 baking dish and topped it with French's Crispy Fried Onions. Baked it at 350 deg for 10 minutes. I served it with sauteed red bell pepper, onion and green peas. For my carnivore husband I grilled a white tail (venison) steak. This recipe is a keeper.

I was worried that it was so simple but it was great!  I used mild cheddar made a double batch...I added salt at the end instead of during cooking to make sure it wasn't too salty for the little ones.  Will make again for sure.

My guys love boxed mac and cheese but I think it's disgusting. This was my first attempt to compromise. Turned out great! They thought I slaved over it but it was super easy. I used half sharp cheddar and half smoked Gouda. Will make again for sure.

This mac and cheese is always delicious, and because it has so few ingredients I always have what I need to make it. 
I personally like to half the sauce recipe because the full amount is too much for the amount of noodles I make.
My favorite thing to add to this is about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp of paprika. Also some finely minced onions! So good.

This recipe lacks flavor despite using a sharp cheddar cheese I love. I used the recommended serving of 8 oz uncooked pasta, but the sauce was way too much for that amount of macaroni once cooked. The sauce itself was runny. I followed the recipe exactly as listed, but 2 cups of cheese to 2 cups of milk makes for a thin sauce. I served a bowl, and added a slice of cheese in hopes of thickening just that serving, but it didn't help much. I won't be using this recipe again.

Perhaps the best recipe you can find to start making mac n cheese. I prefer to use white sharp Cheddar, shell pasta, and added a bit more milk as the sauce was too thick for my taste.

Easy and all 4 of my kids loved it. It's very rare that I make something all 4 kids like, so thanks for the recipe. I added 1 tsp ground mustard and otherwise made just as specified by recipe. Very creamy sauce. Nice not to have to bake it.

I made it but I use the  metric system and ended up making mine to thick. And I think with the wrong type of cheese while it was good it wasn't great but I'm going to keep the  recipe  and review it again when I can make it correctly. also the way it you posted the recipe was easy to fallow.  Thank you!

Turned out great! I also added breadcrumbs and baked it. My hubby pretty much ate at least half of it :) Will definitely make it again! I added in garlic, ginger and Italian seasoning before adding in the cheese and loved that the sauce was nice and thick!

Very good for being so simple. No buying special cheeses or anything, I had everything on hand. I used 2 cups of macaroni and 3 cups freshly shredded cheddar and there was plenty of sauce. I also added 2 cans of tuna and a package of peas and we just had it for dinner. Macaroni cheese tuna fish and peas is a favorite lazy dinner, lol.

Very good recipe! I added a little bit of ground mustard to the sauce and garnished with leftover bacon. I will definitely make this again. I would also recommend turning the heat off before SLOWLY adding in the cheese so the cheese doesn't separate & become grainy.

I made this and also browned some bread crumbs in butter put them on top of the finished mac and cheese, and put it in the oven at 175 C (350F) for fifteen minutes until the whole thing was baked. If you do bake the pasta though, it should be left al dente.

This was an excellent recipe to serve as a guide. One change I made with a used rotini pasta. One change I would make in hindsight, would be to use block cheddar and shred it myself. Shredded cheese has an additive to keep it from sticking together which can make the sauce a little grainy. I thought I used mild cheddar which gave it a sweeter flavor.

My picture is in the gallery. Instead of using cheddar cheese, I used Garlic Curds and Pecorino. I cooked it a bit longer than said and it turned out very creamy and smooth. Best Mac and Cheese ever!!!

Incredible!  This is finally the recipe my kids love.  It is not BAKED macaroni and cheese, which can be dry and takes time.  This is the closest to box macaroni and cheese and is very easy to make (minus shredding a lot of cheese because I do not like the pre-shredded cheese).  So tasty!

My ingredient list wasn't precise and I had some mess-ups along the way. I had to substitute and use mozzarella cheese because that's all I had, but altogether it still tastes delicious. I will definitely make it again.

Delicious and versatile!  I didn't have real butter, so I substituted Smart Balance, which worked fine, and I only had about half the cheddar needed, so I used mozzarella for the other half, which provided a good and slightly different flavor.  My seven year old loved it and so did I!

This was so quick, easy and satisfying. Came together in about 10 minutes and had a richness that you'd get at a steakhouse. I used what I had on hand: 3 measuring cups of dry, small shells (from a box that says "White Fiber" on it, and tastes normal, if anyone has seen this in their store and wondered...what the hey, extra fiber...) and an 8oz bag (which is actually the exact 2 cups, in cheese terms, called for) of reduced fat shredded Sargento Mexican blend - this was more mild than the called for cheddar, and I will definitely use all cheddar next time, because I think this recipe lends itself to that, possibly even a little sharp in there.

Great easy mac and cheese recipe!  It is very cheesy, but you should season the cheese sauce to your own taste, as written, it is a little bland.  I added andouille sausage and Cajun seasoning to mine and my family loved it.

This is a great base recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and added some extra salt/pepper. I also added in some garlic salt and a few splashes of red hot. It's absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Leftovers seem better than freshly made. My 2yr didn't care for it much. I think 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup sharp might have given the M&C a fuller flavor.

I've made this a couple times and I like it, but it seems like the sauce-to-noodles ratio is really off with the recipe as is. Maybe I just don't like my mac and cheese as cheesy as some people, but I always end up using more like 16oz of macaroni and it tastes great. Otherwise this is a perfectly good base recipe.

I followed this to the letter. The sauce had the consistency of paste and was very bland. My son tried adding more cheese, salt and pepper. His comment was, "it's awful!"

I usually just "wing" my cheese sauce when it comes to no-bake macaroni and cheese, and that almost always results in it turning out too thick or too thin and me having to adjust accordingly.  The proportions of this recipe are perfect, and it's so easy to make.  I will definitely be following this recipe from now on.

Had to add a lot of extra butter, milk and cheese as ratio to flour is a bit off. It tastes pretty good, but had to add a bit extra salt and pepper too.

We love this recipe! From start to finish it is about 20 minutes. Simple and delicious. I actually double the amount of noodles, and it is still very creamy and great.

I made this just as the recipe said. Box mix mac and cheese is 1000x better. It came out all thin and mushy and I used all my ingredients for food on it so I had to eat the entire bowl.

Very,very good! I am very surprised that stove top mac and cheese(used to baked)turned out this well. I thought it made closer to 6-8 servings. Made as is, except I added extra salt.

Wow!  I sautéed diced jalapeños with the butter before adding the flour and it came out perfect.  A 2 cup bag of Tillamook shredded triple cheddar did the trick.  I will certainly be making this again and again!

So easy to make and very tasty! I didn't have quite enough shredded cheddar  so I added about four slices of Velveeta American cheese and a little Parmesan (tablespoon maybe?).  It was amazing.  I've tried other recipes and none have compared to this one.  This is definitely my to-go recipe for next time and I'm so done doing the boxed kits lol.  The older I get the less boxed stuff I use and I find awesome homemade recipes instead!

This recipe was very good - the macaroni and cheese came out thick, creamy, and cheesy. My kids and I both loved it! I read a review about it being really runny, and someone else mentioned they may not have let the flour and butter cook long enough, and then again with the milk. I followed the steps in the recipe by letting each stage cook for several minutes and the sauce was not runny. It was great!

The taste, the texture was simply awesome. It was so simple I just made it instantaneously, it came out very well. Added some mixed herbs too, the flavour was very nice. Waiting to prepare for my son, he's been asking for a while .........!

As written, this is very bland. Nice texture on the sauce, but needs something for flavor. I think it would be pretty good as is over cauliflower.

Awesome traditional Mac and cheese! Totally customizable for add-ins, very creamy, tastes great baked with breadcrumb topping. I did add a bit of garlic powder, and used only 3 tbs of flour. Family favorite!

Like others have said, this is a much better and healthier version of mac and cheese than the boxed ones and it tastes good or better. I added frozen mixed vegetables and used wheat flour for even healthier version.  Very good recipe. Thank you!

Easiest Mac and cheese recipe I've ever made.  Took just under 15 minutes, added a little extra cheese, salt and milk because we eat more than 8oz of noodles! My kids love it, thanks for leaving all of  these great reviews it really helps!

This recipe is amazing! I did tweak this recipe slightly. I used 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup skim milk, and I added an 1/8 tsp of ground mustard and 1/8 tsp paprika. The extra cheese made the leftovers the next day almost as good as the night before.  My daughter loved it! Thank you you for posting, I will never buy store Mac and Cheese again!

The first time I followed the recipe and it was just ok, bland and too much sauce. Next time I added a dash of cayenne and reduced the sauce ingredients and I liked it better. (I cut sauce in half and then added in noodles until the right consistency; had a little noodles left over this way so maybe 3/4 the sauce would be perfect?) I'll keep tweaking, maybe use sharp cheddar next time, since it is an easy way to satisfy a Mac and cheese craving using real ingredients...

It is a  very simple mac and cheese recipe. Me and my fiance' made it and we both enjoyed it.  This is one recipe we are keeping. We only made a change to the cheese that we used and it still came out very well.  We are planning on using this recipe in the future.

I've made this 3 times now and my kids keep asking for it. I've used different shaped pastas and there was definitely too much sauce, though it does thicken up as it sits. Macaroni might make the difference. I used a 500g bag of a spiral noodle the last time. I also added a sprinkle of garlic powder which made it perfect, as it was slightly bland the first two times. I love the saucy thickness but it could be thinned a bit with a bit of milk. I won't be buying boxed Mac and cheese again!

Was looking for an easy weeknight side dish, and found this recipe.  It was delicious and super easy.  A lot less complicated than my go-to recipe, but we have a winner!  I added dry mustard and a little hot sauce to make it closer to my go-to recipe and to add a little kick.  Yum!

Tried the recipe the way it was written and it is a very good mac and cheese that is easy to whip up last minute.  I have since put a little sriracha in it to kick it up a little. The kid still liked it and it gave it a little extra flavor.

Easy, and great with the addition of some cajun seasoning.  We toss this with linguine noodles and serve with fresh diced tomatoes, chicken, and broccoli.

I like this recipe because it is very simple and you can adjust it however you want. I ended up adding more cheese with more of a variety to change the taste of the sauce.

Was craving something with pasta and creamy.  This took so little time to put together and oh so good!  I did 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk and added 1/4 of freshly grated percorino romano and parmesan cheese.  I also upped the cheddar cheese to 2 1/2 cups.  Probably could do 3 cups next time.  Definitely will make again!

Best Mac and cheese recipe I've ever made. We never eat mac and cheese at our house because my husband and kid don't like American food. But we had to take a dish to a 4th of July party and this is amazing. The sauce thickens up beautifully. It tastes like a wholesome, homemade version of Stouffers macaroni. Will definitely save this recipe!

Everyone loved it! So quick and easy. I used extra large elbow macaroni and cheddar jack cheese. Can't wait to experiment with other cheeses. My son compared it to restaurant quality like Boston Market and my husband could not stop eating it.

Made it last night - thought it excellent and easy.  Key is to really let the butter & flour cook.   All kinds of seasonings you could add, but perfect as is and much better than Kraft!   Thank you for posting the recipe.

I changed the recipe a bit. Added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese (for added salt), Dijon mustard and baked for 20 minutes with a light seasoned bread crumbs, tabs of butter, and paprika on top. Didn't have whole milk so used a combo of 1/2 and 1/2, water, and liquified cottage cheese. Oh my, delicious!

If your sauce turns grainy, make sure that when you pour in the cheese, you are stirring it constantly at a low heat!! This helped me make the sauce smoother and not as clumped

Doesn't have a good texture and not much taste at all.  UPDATE:  I made this again not realizing that I had already made it before and didn't like it.  This time I used extra sharp cheddar and whole wheat pasta and still no taste, not even a hint of a cheesy taste.  Even added a little Velveeta because I had some I needed to use. Also, grainy again, maybe because of the whole wheat pasta?  Sorry, didn't  like, there are so many better mac & cheese recipes out there.

Three out of four kids approved. And usually they won't eat home made mac and cheese. I thought it was too bland. It's definitely a great base though. I will be making it again but with some tweaks.

Good recipe, but I added powdered mustard and spicy paprika to give it a little more flavor. Came out very good.

Excellent. I didn't have milk, so I substituted half and half. Also, added 1 lb. ground turkey and 1/2 onion (chopped and browned together).
