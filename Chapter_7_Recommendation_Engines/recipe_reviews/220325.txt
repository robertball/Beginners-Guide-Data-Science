Just made these! I was convinced that even though he claimed the crunch was the real thing, there must be some sort of enhancement going on, but they really were just as beautiful and as crunchy as the ones in the video. One thing; they took far less time to cook than the recipe indicated. Probably about half the time. Next time, I'll try cutting them a bit thicker, too, as I don't think an onion ring with a little substance left in the onion is a bad thing. Also, as crunchy as these stay, you could probably take the time to make a big batch of them for a larger group and keep them warm in the oven until they were all done with no effect on the quality.

I've made this twice now.  First time followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  The second time, used beer instead of club soda, cut the onions thicker, and didn't use any bread crumbs - just the batter.... and they were slap yo' momma good!

Crispy - Crunchy goodness.   I didn't watch the video before making these and I should have.  The first few that I made the batter was really thin and didn't adhere well.   In the video, Chef John says to let the batter sit for a bit and let the potato flakes hydrate and the batter thickens up.  Make plenty - everyone will want more.  Enjoy!

These turned out great! Deep frying is still a little messy, and even with olive oil, adds calories from fat. On a whim I just tried baking them on a foil-lined sheet in my convection oven until they were crispy. Oh my gosh, were they ever good! Just drizzle with a little bit of olive oil and bake them; no one will know the difference and they are virtually guilt-free! Chef John's outstanding recipe still produces amazingly crispy, crunchy onion rings straight from the oven!

These are the most crispy onion rings we've ever had. I gave obey for my Husband to try and he said he will never be able to eat any other rings! My daughter never eats onion rings and after she tried these, she put 4 more on her plate. I kept them in a warm oven while I cooked them all and after about 45 minutes from when I started and being in the oven...they were still as crispy!!!!! Only think I did different was adding seasoning salt right to the batter.

I tried baking these at 425 degrees in the oven for 20 minutes instead of frying - they came out super crunchy and delicious! Not as pretty in color, but the taste and texture were exactly what I expected.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Just like A&W onion rings only better cause you make em yourself!  Made two slight adjustments to the recipe, I didn't have club soda on hand so I used some light beer I had in the fridge and will make em like that again cause it was so good.  The first time I made these I had a little trouble with the batter not sticking after they were cooked so the second time around I dredged the rings in flour as soon as they were cut and then proceeded with battering and dipping in the Panko and they were much better, batter completely held together and they were the best onion rings I've had!

Made these twice now, they are outstanding!  Used the left over batter up with a hot dog it was better then a corn dog.  Because they are so good we had to remind ourselves of the 179 per onion ring calorie count.   No dessert for a couple days.

Great rings chef John. The end product was top shelf--however my son and I need to exercise more restraint next time --we did over indulge in our celebration of the best rings ever. By the way I enjoy your video's the whatever I don't take myself to seriously approach is refreshing.

Made these a few days ago and loved them! I haven't had onion rings since my gluten intolerance diagnosis over a year ago, boo. I can't abide battered rings either. These were perfect, and they DO stay crunchy, no lie!  I was out of GF panko crumbs as was my health food store, so had to sub GF breadcrumbs. It made no difference at all, the crunch was ideal and they stayed super crisp, as promised. I do think I'll try baking them next time, because the house smelled like a fast-food kitchen all night. Chef John, you always deliver the goods and this one's another winner. I can haz onion rings, just the way I like them!

Tried these -- delicious! I'm not one for stovetop deep-frying, though, so maybe I'll invest in a fryer gadget if I want to make them regularly.  Of note -- I only had on hand some flour that was gluten-free, and I used that, mixed with a lesser amount of tapioca flour.  Made a few other minor adjustments (smoked paprika, not cayenne, etc.).  Regular flour may give a more even, thorough coating, but even so, they were yummy.

I had to laugh at the reviews that said these were too crispy.  That's like a steak that's too tender.  These were awesomely fantastic and everyone here LOVED them. These are the best onion rings I've had, including at restaurants.  The trick is to use small batches of panko so that it doesn't get clumpy -- if it gets clumpy, it won't stick.  As long as you keep adding new dry panko and fry in small batches, you won't have issues with the breading falling off.

This method worked great, I added one more tablespoon of Potato Flakes and ground the Panko to a finer size.  Also, added seasonings (and salt) to the Panko (to taste of course).  Solves the batter sticking to the onion issue even on fresh cut onions.  I still strip the inner membrane when I can, but this recipe reduces if not eliminates the need.  I will be exploring other veggies with this as well - bring on the SHROOMS!!   THANK YOU!!

Good flavor... If you can get the breading to stick to the rings during frying. Most of mine fell off. I tried regular Panko as well as mixing in some Italian Panko. Both were good. Very crunchy.

These looked so good in the photo and I was very hungry. I had all the ingredients except potato flakes and club soda and the nearest store is 8 miles away. So I improvised and they still came out crunchy to the last bite. I had some jasmine rice so I ground it up in my coffeebean grinder and substituted it for the potato flakes. I also had some rather flat ginger ale, but I shook it up real good. I mixed those ingredients and whipped it really well. I used a regular yellow onion, cut it 1/4 inch slices and kinda dusted them with flour before adding to the batter. Seasoned batter with  Tony Chacheres creole seasoning, put them into the panko. Fried them 4 at a time in peanut oil but it took 1 minute or less for each ring. Drained them on a wire rack (good idea) sprinkled them with sea salt. Pretty darn good and crunchy.

Oh my! these were super crunchy and delicious! We have made these a few times, but boy frying onion rings sure does smell up your house, we just learned to take the deep fryer outside ;) But if you love crispy onion rings, these are the ones to make. Thanks for the recipe.

I added a bit more flour - 2 tblp. to thicken up the batter a bit.  They were soooo good!  Thanks for the recipe John.  :)

i tried this last night. the batter was extremely thin and wasnt latching on to the onions.even after i left it to sit out for almost 30 min.then decided to double coat the onions and that actually worked for me. i left the remaining batter in the fridge overnight and now it seems to hav thickened.im gonna try it again but its just not an easy recipe as it seems in the video.atleast not for me.

These were exceptional, and not oily (though slightly greasy, as would anything fried in oil).  My only change was to add dry onion soup mix to the panic crumbs for a bit more flavor.  I can finally make excellent onion rings at home!! Yeah!!!

Chef John, thank you again for yet another great recipe. These went perfect with Buffalo style wings (another of your great recipes). My family ate them so fast I couldn't get a photo. It was just a blur of hands and before I knew it the plate was empty. Very crispy and delicious.

These were yummy, yummy, yummy! I didn't have cornstarch and replaced the club soda with beer and they were sooooo good! I used the same mixture and panko breadcrumbs to coat and fry homemade jalapeños stuffed with cream cheese and they were devoured in minutes!

I just made these, and they are wonderful! Extra crispy and once they were well salted they are delicious on their own!

I did make one substitution here: I didn't have any club soda on hand, so I used a cup of BEER instead. Not sure how much flavor it added, but it worked perfectly all the same.

Be sure you watch the temperature of your oil -  I know i recently purchased a new stove with a "quick heating" burner -  you don't want to burn them before they are cooked - they will not take long to cook  - very good recipe!

SO DELICIOUS!!!   These are so crispy and good.  I followed the recipe with one exception.   When I'm separating the raw onion into the rings,  I leave two rings together, which makes them even more oniony good .  Also I have used this recipe for fried zuchinni which also works great.  I DO however, salt and "sweat' my zuchinni for 10 minutes or so, before I use them.

I've made this recipe this evening for me and a couple of friends, it was sóó good and CRUNCHY! I had to use a little bit more cornstarch and potato flakes than mentioned in the recipe but it was all worth it. Me and my friends loved fried onions. I was a little bit nervous because I don't own a frying pan, but with a good saucepan, olive oil and the pan on the biggest pit but on the lowest setting was good enough :D. Next time I'm doing the variation on the recipe with beer that is mentioned in an earlier review.

The crunch is outstanding! 
Because I was a little nervous of it being a bland mix, I added some herbs and spices to the batter. The onion rings were sweet and so crunchy. I also used it for pollock that I caught last summer. It also made the fish crunchy. This is the next morning and I just tested them cold out of the refrigerator  (I know...) and they are still crunchy! 
Just to be sure the batter would adhere, I cut everything to size and laid the pieces out on paper towels to dry before preparing the coatings. Then after coating each piece, setting them aside to rest on the cookie sheet until all was prepared. Then I heated the oil and fried the onion rings first before the fish.  Wow, best fried food I've ever made! Thanks John! I appreciate your videos very much!

An absolutely wonderful recipe. My family is onion ring fanatics and they said this recipe was it. Great crunch even when they cool down which didn't happen much as my family was standing there eating them as soon as I would pull them out. We all thank you Chef John for sharing this wonderful recipe and will use the batter with my fried squash next and maybe some other dishes.

I followed the instructions exactly the way I remembered it on the video. I had a very difficult time getting the bread crumbs to stick. After the first few onions, most of the bread crumbs got wet, making it difficult to stick onto the new onions being dipped in from the wet batter. Some of my rings winded up with "bald spots" because I couldn't get the bread crumbs to stick. 

The end result was pretty tasty! Because I had no idea what I was doing despite watching the video like 3 times, I went waaaay over the estimated 30 minutes, and I had a TON of cleaning up to do. After several minutes of cleaning the ugly mess I'd made, I moved all my cooled rings from the wire rack to a plate. The rings were good... but I couldn't help but think that they were no better quality than your typical fast food joint's onion rings. I started walking away from the kitchen with a slight feel of disappointment, when I saw something in the corner of my eye: the fine sea salt that I'd set aside. I realized I'd completely forgotten to salt the rings! I took one, salted it liberally as instructed, and this instantly made everything 10 times more delicious! Totally worth it!


I should also mention I tried to use 3 large onions, but it looks like the recipe is only enough for 2 (Chef John's website: Food Wishes says you can use 2-3 large onions). Also, I used Canola Oil.

OMG!!!!!!?? These were wonderful... My husband and son want to put these in our homemade rotation. Better then most restaurants. Now when we make burgers we will have fries and onion rings... I would have posted a picture but we ate them too fast.. Tip: Preseason the Panko so you can eat as soon as they come out.??

Chef John these are prefect. This is the second recipe in a row of yours I can can tell this both were outstanding. I froze some sting cheese then cut them in half so they are about two and a half inches long, dip then in the batter roll them in the Panko bread crumbs. Now that is a perfect cheese stick. Thanks again.....

Taste was good in the first couple of batches. After that could not get the batter to stick to the rings. May try again.

I found this to be a worthwhile splurge and everyone loved them.  Had to make a special trip to get potato flakes but it was worth it.  I used a dutch oven with the oil about 3 inches deep and it worked out very well.  Next time I'd like to try baking them and if that brings crispy onion rings without the frying that would be 5 stars

Great results from this recipe. I have used it to fry grouper, flounder, and shrimp. as well as onion rings. 
Everything always turns out super crunchy. It is always a super big hit. Thanks to Chef John for another great way to keep my family happy.

I made these for supper tonight and only changed the liquid, substituting beer for the club soda because I didn't have any.  We really enjoyed them so will definitely make them again.

I made this with Chef John's grilled shrimp recipe the other night for dinner with my husband.  OMG!!!  I will never, ever make or buy another onion ring other than this recipe.  Fantastic!!  And the grilled shrimp with the lemon aioli, perfect compliment!  (I could watch Chef John's videos all day!).  ENJOYED!!

I tried mushrooms with this method and they came out delicious.  I also tried baking the onion rings as suggested by another reviewer at 425F for 20-25 minutes.  They were crispy but not as pretty as the deep fried onion rings.  My onion rings are sitting on a plate a couple of hours after being cooked and they're still crispy, just need to reheat them in the oven to make them perfect again.  I would try this method on any appetizer that needs to be crispy.  Lovely, lovely recipe.  Thanks Chef John!!

This was great. I have been looking for a way to make onion rings that will not leave them soggy if I have to refrigerate them later. This was the answer. They are so delicious, I can't make them often because I will be huge.

These were the best onion rings I have ever had!   My husband hates fried food....he liked these!   My neighbor who loves fried food, couldn't eat them fast enough....disappointed I halved the recipe.  Next time I will double it!  

I didn't edit or adjust....just used Chef John's recipe.   His recipes are always awesome.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years. They are the best. I can also make them in advance and fry them later. Makes plenty and we eat too many. SOOOOOO GOOD! I take them to my son's house for a WING FEST and fry them there. If we don't have club soda plain cold water is just fine.

I almost gave this 1 star because the batter was not thick enough to adhere to the rings (following directions and measurement exactly and letting it sit a while to thicken).  In turn, the panko would not adhere.  So I added more flour, and it wasn't thick enough.  Then I added about 2 more tbl of potato flakes.  Finally, it seemed thick enough.  Then dredged in panko and used canola oil to fry.  These now turned out to be a crispy delight!

Made these for a church function and people kept coming back for more. Make sure your oil is hot enough, otherwise they take a while to get done. Everyone was surprised at just how crunchy the panko makes these, and they were not as heavy as I had expected either. Fans of Sonic onion rings might want to add a little sugar to the batter, though using sweet onions by themselves worked fine.

Very crispy and crunchy. I tested a couple pieces of shrimp along with the onion rings and they tasted great as well. I'll use this batter as a base for other things as well. Tastes great with ketchup or sweet chili sauce.

This one's a fiver! Just tried it today, and it came out just as expected. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception that I didn't have any club soda on hand and we're iced in today, so used seltzer water, and that seems to work just fine, too.

The flavor is perfect, but that crunch is to die for! Wow!

Thank YOU CHEF JOHN! These were the absolute BEST!  Better than at a restaurant. The ONLY thing I did differently was I added a tsp of salt to the batter. My family loved it.

Made these last night and they were fantastic! I didn't have potato flakes or Panko crumbs so I used cornmeal and homemade breadcrumbs. I will definitely be making these again.

First time making these rings. They were flavorful and extremely crunchy. The recipe was flawless, but I did dredge them in seasoned flour before dipping them. I will make these again in a heartbeat. I had extra and warmed them up for lunch in a 325 degree oven. Success!!

Superb recipe, and low in sodium if you mind the brand of bread crumbs you use. Very crunchy - I substituted the instant potato flakes for corn meal and the soda for ginger ale and it didn't miss a beat. Then I used the remains to batter and crumb up a couple Tilapia fillets, using a touch more cayenne and some smoked paprika. Would highly recommend, especially with the "2 fork" method in the video.

They were delicious and definitely crunchy even when cold.  I didn't have soda water and used plain old tap water.  I do prefer a little more batter on my rings as these came out like they had tempura batter, a thin batter, on them.

I put a small amount of olive oil in the batter and then made them in the air fryer. Very healthy and very tasty.

I love these  onion rings! Crispy and not oil filled like at some restaurants. Only mistake I made was not separating all the onions before putting them in the batter, maybe 2 rings at a time would work.   I still loved them though. The cooling rack does a great job in draining the excess oil.

Made these delicious onion rings and oh were they good.  Quick and easy.  When preparing the Panko bread crumbs I was a little short so completed the measurement using the bread crumbs.  Still crunchy.  Next time I will try adding salt to the bread crumbs to season.  Thanks for the recipe.

I had about at 50% success rate on my first try with the recipe.  The issue was that it just took me a while to get the knack of getting the rings coated and into the oil with just the right amount of batter on them.  They do stay crispy for quite a while and I need to figure out a way to keep them hot or heat them up just before serving.  Im going to try microwaving next time. 
This recipe is a real keeper.

Im totally excited to try calamari, as another reviewer mentioned, but, instead of tomato based sauce Im going to try drizzling a balsamic glaze on them.

These came out really good ! It was my first time making anything like this and the batter was fantastic. I then added coconut flakes to it and made coconut shrimp with the rest of the batter. 

You do need the panko bread crumbs and I got a small box but slowly realized I was running out. So just make sure you pick up a big box of those so you don't run out.

Three stars for being crispy and tasty. However, I must have done something wrong. The Panko bread crumbs wouldn't stick. They ended up having a very light crust, looking nothing like the pictures. I used a ton of Panko ( the whole container) because it kept getting lumpy due to the wet onions. Even with letting the batter set up and using separate forks. I threw away most of the bread crumbs when they became too lumpy and didn't adhere. I was so looking forward to these onion rings, but I was disappointed. Any tips I would be grateful .

Did not have any flavor and the crispy part did not stay on the onion.
