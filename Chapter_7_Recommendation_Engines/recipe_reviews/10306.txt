I've been making these cookies for 12 years (they are in a sunset magazine cookbook- I lost the book and was lucky to find it here!) and LOVE them. My family and friends loved them when I was younger and my young kids love them now. They are great as an on the go breakfast just as it says and very healthy with lots of fiber. Delicious easy and a great nutritious snack!

I have made these for years and suggest using 1 cup unbleach flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour or you can use regular flour too. These cookies taste best eaten cold. I put them in the freezer and the teenagers grab them for breakfast on the go. My teen kids do not like them as well room temperature.

These did not turn out well for me. They were very bland and I wouldn't make them again.

These are "interesting" tasting. There are a lot of ingredients including peanut butter which I thought made them taste a little too interesting.

Not very good at all. The cookies were ok (but not great) when they came out of the oven but at room temperature they tasted horrible. I do not reccomend this recipe
