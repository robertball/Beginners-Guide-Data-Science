I think this recipe would be even better made with cornbread batter, rather than pancake batter.

Tried them Saturday night for two girlfriends prior to dinner. We loved them so much - we made more after dinner and had them for dessert!
They're easy, they look fun, they taste great, they're inexpensive to make and they are good for you.
Loved this recipe.

These were fabulous! I made them as during a dry run of appetizer candidates for a party. I omitted the red pepper because I don't like it. We decided against having them for the party because they are a little awkward to eat with your fingers, and that's the kind of party we're having, but it will go into our regular dinner rotation as a side dish for sure! Easy and delicious!
