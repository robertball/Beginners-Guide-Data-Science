2 cups of chili sauce is way too much. We put in half of that and that was still a bit on the hot side. We also substituted fresh garlic for powder. Otherwise not bad.

This was very easy to get together and perfect for a quick meal. It was tangier and had more of a zing than the typical sloppy joe by using chili sauce since it is made with horseradish. I did add a few sprinkles of brown sugar to cut down on the acidity of the tomato sauce. We did not like it with the suggestion of dill pickles tomato & lettuce but it was very good with coleslaw.
