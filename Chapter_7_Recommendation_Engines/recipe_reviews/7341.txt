Thanks, Indira!  It seems I have tried a thousand egg-free cake recipes since my daughter developed a severe egg allergy.  This is the first eggless cake recipe I'll keep.  I've tried it twice so far.  Best results were when I doubled the recipe and substituted 1 cup of flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of  baking powder and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt for each cup of self-rising flour.  A double recipe fills my NordicWare mini-bundt muffin pan, plus a couple of small mini-bundts.  The texture was more solid and consistent than recipes that use soy lecithin or potato starch/tapioca substitutes for egg.  The cinnamon masks the baking powder flavor just fine.  I'm going to try a chocolate version next.

this is the most terrible thing i've ever baked!! it took me over 30 minutes and it was raw and doughy in the middle but crunchy on top. the flavor wasn't even that good. i dissapointed my whole family when i served it for breakfast and it was a mess.

Very delicious for ingredients I already had around the house! The only change I made was I used all purpose flour with 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt in place of the self-rising flour.

Delicious cake, a little plain though. Ever time i made it, it would be gone within a half an hour, so i turned it into a two layer cake and made a topping for it by making a third cake and crumbling it up mixing it with a stick of butter, a 1/2 cup of sugar, and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. It was just what the cake needed. It made it taste a thousand times better. Everyone raves about this, it was a huge hit at work! and very very simple

Very tasty and simple to make.  It's like a snickerdoodle, in cake form.  I think that only unsalted butter should be used, though, because I used salted and it came out rather salty.  :) The sweetness offset it, though.  It was very sweet as well.

So easy! So good with coffee or hot tea! I bake it in a round cake pan and add a crumb topping (instead of sprinkling with sugar-cinnamon mix from the recipe) creating an almost coffee cake. Besides, it takes mins and I usually have everything in the pantry already.

Really very good! I'm suprised this doesn't have more reviews and 5 stars! Super easy and tasty. Only downside is it makes very little. Next time I will double the recipe. Thanks!

Very delish & easy. I put some tin fruit in the middle and cut back a bit on the butter. To clarify, I'm pretty sure that you put only the the butter, sugar and cinnamon in the pan to heat and then pour that mixture into the self raising flour.

This was very good. It's very easy to spice up if you have the spices on hand. Just add some allspice or pumpkin pie spice. Made a nice snack for my kids.

This cake was awesome. I loved it. Although I'm not too good at cooking, this cake was simple and delicious. I accidentally created a topping for it, when i tried to take it out of the pan, half of the bottom fell off :O oops! insted of tossing it, I mixed it in with the butter, cinnamon, sugar topping and made a kind of paste! It was delicious, It made the cake even more moist! I recommend this one for anyone!

Well, I must have done something wrong!  The cake tasted good, but it took longer than 20 minutes for mine to bake.  When I thought it was ready, the center plopped out.  I had to scoop it back in and rebake.

I'll probably try it again, but I'll bake it for 30 minutes instead of 20 and use less sugar on top.

This was great to use up my self rising flour - very quick and easy.  Added some nutmeg and ground cloves too.  Didn't use all the sugar - just sprinkled some over the top.

I added a little allspice and it tasted very good but the middle cooked very slowly. I baked it for about 30 min. It was the right moistness but was rather crumbly and the slice fell apart.

i made this as a morning snack for my 2 y/o. we were out of eggs she ate the last 2 for breakfast. i didnt have a 6in pan. i think my cake pan is 9in. it was quick to make, i added a cap-full of vanilla, and a little brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar in the batter. i also only used about half of the last topping.

This did not turn out for me.  The cake did not rise and was a buttery mess after baking it 20 minutes.  I used all purpose flour and noticed after baking it that the recipe called for self rising flour.  I have never heard of self rising flour.  I wish I had noticed this earlier!

Good cake, but not fabulous.  I would triple the recipe and make in two 8 inch round pans.  Good for vegans if you substitute Earth Balance for the butter and soy milk for the milk.

Very good! The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect! The second time I added cinnamon to batter (because I am a cinnamon lover:), but it didn't turn out as I had hoped. I wouldn't recommend the adding it.

Wow, this is great. I only made two servings to try it out, and i baked it for 15 minutes and it came out perfectly i didnt add anything else to the cake after baking it because tastes good by itself. the cake is a little crumbly, but i dont mind because its sooo good lol.  If you're making 8 servings like the recipes says, you're going to have to bake it a little longer like people have said before.

I've made this recipe since I was a kid. It's very easy and very tasty. I use a bundt pan and make sure to gently swirl the cinnamon mixture in. It makes it look a little prettier.

What a hit with my family! I didnt have a 6inch cake pan, so I used my 8inch cake pans. And I doubled the recipe and made 2 cakes. I stacked the cakes and it made it a larger cake... What a great cake... It really does go great with coffee, the perfect morning or afternoon treat. THANKS!

It is simple to make, and the texture and taste is wonderful.I added about a teaspoon of vanilla.

The second time around I used a fat free margarine, and amazingly enough it turned out just as good. My family loves it, and it's perfect for afterschool or an early morning send off. I don't know how it tastes the next day because it never lasts long enough to find out! 

Great recipe!

I'd like to have an alternate to this recipe that includes baking soda or baking powder and uses regular flour instead of self-rising flour, which I usually don't keep on hand.

I did not like this flavor or consistency of this cake. I guess I expected a more dense breadlike cake and this was really small and flat. I love cinnamon and really wanted to like this, but not my cup of tea... My kids did eat it though

Easy and very good.  I doubled the recipe following another suggestion on here.  Altogether that took 15 extra minutes.  I might skip the topping next time, as it is good enough without.

I've made this and so many variations of it dozens of times now!  It tastes great, although a couple of times it has come out a bit crumbly.  I always make WAY too much of the sugar/cinnamon topping, but the butter/cinnamon spread is just enough!  Really sweet.  If you want it SOLID (kind of fun, haha), replace the self-rising flour with regular flour and add an egg.  It makes the cake basically solid, but I thought it was an interesting twist.  I liked it! =).

This is great cake! The flavor is wonderful, and it is amazingly easy to make. I didn't frost it, because it was good enough on its own. The batter is very tasty, too.I have to admit, though, that it has very strange texture, but the taste makes up for it!

I made this for my son's daycare birthday cake, because he is allergic to eggs. The daycare ladies said it was the only cake they have ever seen all the children eat up entirely, and clamour for more. Its quite high in fat but low in sugar, which isn't such a bad thing for kids, as cakes go. I left off your topping and just put a thin coating of frosting and decorations, and the kids loved it.

Very easy and tasty! Only problem I had was figuring out what self-rising flour was. I only had all-purpose, so I added in some salt and baking powder. Worked out fine in the end!

YUMMY!  I wasn't sure how it would work
since it is so small, but the cake is
very rich.  I did a light drizzle of a
confectioners sugar frosting over the 
top and it was delicious!

This was a good, little cake. I was worried about making a cake on the stove with such limited ingredients. No need to worry though. Like other reviewers, I added a teaspoon of baking powder since I used all-purpose flour. The cake had a strong cinnamon taste that I love. I didn't include the sugar-cinnamon sprinkling. Next time, I'll double the recipe.

This was very yummy. I gave it four stars because I skipped the final step of sprinkling 1/4 C sugar & 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. What ended happening was that I increased the measurements of the butter, sugar, and cinnamon that I spread on after it had baked and cooled by 1/2 (1 1/2 T butter, 1 1/2 T sugar, 3/4 tsp. cinnamon). It was plenty sweet. I also didn’t have self-rising flour, so I did the equivalent with 1 C all-purpose flour, 1 tsp. baking powder and slightly less than the recommended 1/4 tsp. of salt (I was using salted butter, and it didn’t end up too salty, either).

Horrible. I did the recipe perfectly, then in the oven, all that butter rose to the top and made it a block of rubber, I had to throw it out. Then, my second attempt, the same thing happened. Do not make this!

I made the Cinnamon Teacake dairy and gluten-free!
I used Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour mix.
Instead of butter, I used Spectrum shortening (organic palm oil)
Next time I will add baking powder or baking soda to make up for no self-rising yeast in the gluten free mix.
loved the teacake. 
Decadent. Would be great with vanilla coconut ice cream!

I made this with a little girl I babysit and it was delicious! After about 15 minutes at 350 degrees it was still pretty liquid-y but after I bumped it up to about 400 for about 5 minutes it came out perfect! It is especially good with the cinnamon topping!

I have been making this cake for years!  Still love it!  My children request it!  Easy, delicious and adaptable!  I've changed it many times just to get a variation and every one has been great!  Our favorite though, is when I divide the batter and add the cinnamon to only half, then swirl it into a marble cake!  Love the slightly contrasting flavors of the cake.  It's even great when I triple the recipe to make a larger batch!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

I was excited to make it and decided to pour the batter in muffin cups since I didn't have a small pan. After baking for 20 minutes it was still a little soft and gooey but I thought it would firm up. It didn't, and adding the toppings made it seem even more gooey. 

The flavor was only ok.

The cake was just delicious. For a plain cake, it is full of flavor. Texture and everything is great. If you are using a large square dish, perhaps double the recipe. I used a dish like that, so the batter was about 1.5 cm deep all around and it didn't rise much more than that so it wasn't a very high cake. I took it around to the in-laws place though and they loved it! One of those recipes that get demolished before it has time to cool.

This is an interesting recipe--yeah, no eggs and it doesn't rise much.  Plus, it's rather sweet and salty, but it does make for a nice little cake.  I didn't mix the butter with the sugar then top it again; instead, I just poured butter on top, then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top and called it good.  I made this for a work get together and it was enjoyed.

It was really yummy. Perfect with coffee or tea. I had to bake it for a little extra time so that it would be lest doughy at the bottom. A toothpick came out clean but it still seemed a little mushy at the bottom of the pan so I would recommend baking for the full 20 minutes.

This was delicious and so simple - just as quick and easy as beer bread.  I made it in an 8" round pan and added the baking powder/salt to the flour to make the equivalent of self-rising.  The flavor was delightful and the texture was perfect.  This will definitely become a regular in my house.

My family loved the Cinnamon Teacake for breakfast!  There are a couple changes I made:  I did not have self-rising flour so I added about a teaspoon of baking powder and about 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  I also did not have a 6-in cake pan so I used an 8-in and it came out just fine with 16 minutes of bake time.  Finally, the second dose of sugar-cinnamon topping is WAY too much in my opinion (that's why I gave it 4 stars).  I would reduce by 1/2 or just not use it at all.  This recipe is a keeper for us!

Tastes like cinnamon toast, and loved the crunchy topping. I didn't have a round cake pan, so I baked it in a loaf pan, which took much longer to cook, but turned out fine. Big hit!

I doubled the recipe and made (12) cupcakes instead as I did not have a round cake pan. It was VERY sweet- almost too sweet- and I  never thought those words would come out of my mouth! I even accidentally left out half a cup of sugar so I can't imagine how sweet it would be with that extra 1/2 cup. So if you double it, be sure you remember to double ALL the measurements in the Directions portion! Also- don't let the 'frosting' set too long or else it will clump. They are probably more than sweet enough without the 'frosting' and topping( which does not need to be doubled for cupcakes!)

I love cinnamon. more than most normal people. So this was awesome! Mine turned out a bit dry, but it was still delicious. 

I didn't have self rising flower so i followed another review that said this,

 "Best results were when I doubled the recipe and substituted 1 cup of flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt for each cup of self-rising flour"

so good. thanks!

What an easy and wonderful recipe!  I made this for my husband and his friends a few weeks ago and it was gone before it was completely cooled!  I did double the recipe and it still came out perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

For a normal cake pan, doubling the recipe is a MUST.  This is incredibly easy, and the crunchy butter/cinnamon/sugar topping is sooooo good!  I added about 1 tsp. nutmeg, and about 1/2 tsp. each of allspice and cloves.  It made it spicy and smell really good while baking.

Not a bad recipe, especially for an eggless cake. I was originally looking for a spice cake recipe so I decided to add some allspice and nutmeg to make it a bit more flavorful, and it turned out tasty. Thanks!

This was very good and very easy to make.  I used another reveiwer's suggestion and used all purpose flour with baking soda and salt.  It was a very nice cake, one I could use for breakfast or for an evenning snack.

Was this ever delicious.  My boyfriend and I just devoured them!  I didn't have a 6 inch pan, and found my usual cake pan much too big, so I made 6  muffins instead, which worked out well.  We LOVED the cinnamon sugar on top!  In high school the caf ladies used to make these wonderful cinnamon buns, and I haven't tasted anything like them since until now!  I have an egg allergy so this is a wonderful and easy recipe for me.  Thanks so much!

this recipe is so easy to make. I was so surprise at how quick and easy it was! I didn't have a pan at hand, so I baked it in a loaf pan and it took slightly longer, about 10mins more. The result was great! A bit too sweet so I laid off the sugar sprinkle and used the cinnamon only. Will be making it soon!

Made it twice now - and love it!   Both times I've made it as stated but because it disappeared so fast the first time I doubled the recipe this time and made two cakes which I sandwiched together with a cream cheese/confectioners sugar frosting.  Delicious!

This tastes great and is SO easy to prepare! I will definitely try this again, but I'll likely double the butter/sugar/cinnamon spread and completely omit the final topping. I'm hoping that will make the cake really moist and give it a nice topping without being so heavy on the sugar. This time around was a bit too sweet for me - something I NEVER thought possible!
