I gave this 4 stars because I did make changes, but it is a great starting point.  I quadrupled the recipe in order to can it (I was able to can 14 quarts, plus served dinner to my family of 8).  I had to add chicken broth to make it a "soup".  I added about 3.5 quarts of chicken broth for the quantity I made.  I then found the juice to be too runny, and there were still tons of veggies.  I took about 3 blender fulls and pureed it, then put them back into the soup.  This gave it a great balance of soup and veggies.  I also added a good amount of garlic simply because we like it.  I plan to use this recipe a lot this summer to help preserve the abundance of zucchini from our garden.  For those interested in canning it, I pressure canned it at 11 lbs pressure for 90 minutes.

This is one of our favorite soup recipes.  In the summer, I freeze it to use in winter.  Everyone loves it, even the kids.  I use hot Italian sausage and dice the zucchini.  If you double the recipe, a one gallon can of diced tomatoes equals 8 16 oz. cans, which drastically reduces the cost and prep.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.
I sliced the zucchini a little too thick, so if I make it again, I'll make thinner slices. It was nice to have sausage in this soup, and this whole recipe lasted me for 4 days.

This was great soup! My boyfriend even raved about it for a week and is begging me to make it again.   I did make some changes, I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, I omitted the celery and I had to add a can of beef broth and some vegetable broth to make it more soup like.   I also made this in my slow cooker (low for 8 hours)then topped with shredded mozzarella and served with rolls and salad. Yum!

Mmmmmm...This is so good. I halved everything in the recipe except the spices. I also didn't have celery, so in its place, just used a bit of celery salt and added more zucchini. The only liquid is in the stewed tomatos, so I found I had to add water or else I'd be left with not much 'soup' just veggies. Way good though. I will surely make again!

Super recipe.  I did use Italian sausage ad found it to be pretty think and ended up adding some water (just eyeballed it) but delish!  I froze half of it...I hope it will taste as good as when first cooked.  But great recipe.  Will make plenty of times in the future!!

Ohhh this was WONDERFUL!  My only changes were to add a little salt and then we added mozzarella to our bowls of soup. Divine!  I would highly recommend using diced tomatoes instead of stewed sliced tomatoes.  I didn't find any "stewed diced" so I bought the sliced and they were really big chunks.  I spent about 5 minutes cutting up the slices with a pair of kitchen scissors.  :-)

I made a slight modification to this recipe: instead of stewed tomatoes I diced 3 medium tomatoes from my garden. It was a perfect soup for a cool fall day.

I have been making a version of this recipe since I was a newlywed (when dinasours roamed the earth :), and couldn't lay my hands on my recipe because my cookbooks are packed away while we do some remodelling.  I have a bounty of zucchini and was so glad to find the recipe here.  The soup is simmering on the stove right now and the whole house smells fantastic.  We will eat this in big bowls with crusty bread and a salad.  Not fancy, but comfort food at its best.

This was absolutely delicious.  The blend of flavours was amazing.  I used 5 mild italian sausages that I took out of their casings before browning.  I was a little short on celery (maybe a 1/4c) so I threw in a 1/2tsp or so of celery salt.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes on hand so I used two 19 fl oz cans of Aylmer Accents petite cut tomatoes with spicy red pepper and one of those cans filled with chicken stock.  I still can't believe how good the flavour was, it had a nice bite to it but not too spicy that my kids wouldn't eat it.  Very good and will definitely be making again.  It was wonderful on a cold rainy summer day.

We liked this quite well. Since I didn't have any celery, I used double the zucchini and put in celery salt and whole celery seed instead. I sliced all the zucchini and pepper in the food processor so it took very little time to prepare.

If you, like me, don't care for a strong tomato flavor, there is a quick fix for that little bothersome problem:  simply add a little sugar, balancing the sugar with salt, until the tomato flavor dies back to a comfortable place.  That little trick revolutionized my ability to tolerate tomato based soups and sauces, and to even crave them.  The sugar should simply be used in the same quantities that one might use salt....  just as a seasoning.  Magic happens when you do, even if you like the sharp bite of tomatoes in soups and sauces!

Best soup recipe ever using up so much of the over abundance of Zucchini.  Even a year after being in the freezer, it still tastes great.  I added fresh corn to it.  Sure gave it lots of color.

Fantastic soup!  I made it exactly as written.  Completely wonderful as is!  Next time I will make a couple changes to suit my own preferences such as adding tomato juice to make it more soupy and another pound of sausage just because I love sausage.  Also I would cut up the tomatoes and zucchini smaller.  Everyone loved the soup and it's definitely a keeper!

Love this recipe!  I added two cans of beef broth,  a can of tomato sauce, used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and used diced tomotoes.  It turned out amazing!  My husband and 6 year old loved it!  Oh, and I diced the zucchini.  Will be making again soon!

have been making this soup for years and it is a family favorite.  I add 1 cup of red wine (any red will do) and 1 tsp. of fennel seed.  Makes enough to share and even won the neighborhood "Soup Off"

This is a terrific late summer soup!  As other reviewers have said, have some chicken stock or base on hand to make 6 or more cups of stock - add two cups of stock after the sausage and celery and simmer for 15 minutes or so and then add remaining ingredients, adding more stock as needed - remember to increase the seasonings to taste to account for the additional volume.  Also try jazzing this soup up with BBQ'd Cajun sausage and/or chorizo with canned diced tomato with chili and onion rather than stewed tomatoes, or even throw in a few chopped fresh tomatoes at the end, along with the green pepper.  This is a very tasty and satisfying zucchini and sausage soup!

I love this recipe. I did tweak it a bit though and used a crock pot to simmer all the flavors together. I put the tomatoes in the crock pot to warm while I browned my meat. I ended up doubling the sausage and used spicy Italian sausage. I put the meat in with the tomatoes but saved some of the juices to sauté two small red onions, minced garlic and celery. I then mixed those into the crockpot. I used zucchini and yellow squash cut into rounds, more than the recommended seasoning portions with garlic and onion powder in the mix skipping the sugar and simmered for two hours on high heat. It’s a hit in my household and I will absolutely make this again!

This is a great recipe by itself. I have altered it other times. I have added a variety of vegetables and I also add a couple cups of beef stock. I have also substituted an english roast shredded instead of sausage...

This soup has become my family's favorite!  We froze zucchini from the garden  and enjoyed the soup several times over the winter. I tried it with spicy Italian sausage but the heat over-powered the flavor of the other ingredients.  The soup is rather thick, so I add a can of stewed tomatoes.   This soup is great with bruschetta.

I've made this rich hearty soup several times and love it.  Small changes:  use Mild Italian sausage, use fresh garlic, and omit the sugar (it's really not necessary, and healthier without it!)

We grow and freeze veggies. I've been making this soup since summer and my whole family lives it. I use spicy Italian sausage and serve with salad and a baguette. Love it!

Yum! Tried it as written and it was delicious. For a change of pace I used hot sausage and a tad more garlic. Superb. We'll be making this again and again.

As a kid, my mom used to make something similar but with Italian sausage, and less soupy, so it was more of a main dish not a soup.  But I liked this as a soup.  The only changes I made was I used ground Italian sausage - once I used sweet, another time I used mild - I liked the sweet better.  And I also added some chopped red pepper.  Really tasty, and if you spoon off the fat, pretty low calorie.

Like several reviews, I also added 32 ounces of chicken broth, to give it a soupier consistency. As well as extra spices to make up for the added liquid. Also yellow pepper for color. And then I added 8 ounces of bowtie pasta. It was delicious! My whole family loved it. Thank you!!

Great recipe!  The only thinking I add was one cup of chicken stock. To make it more of a soup.

Yummy! It was kind of hard to guestimate what a pound of zucchini is so i just chopped up the whole thing, added a little extra sausage (about a half pound more) and compensated for the extra zucchini by adding about a cup of jar sauce and a little bit of salt. Wow! So delicious!

Very forgiving. I forgot to add the Zucchini until 3 minutes before serving time. By serving time it had blended already, in just a few minutes.

Amazing flavor!  I used lowfat turkey andoule sausage and had no celery so I used some celery seed.  I only had 4 cans of diced tomatoes and that worked fine too.  I mixed yellow and green zuchinni, and red and green bell peppers for nice color.  After it was all cooked, I removed the sausage pieces and used my immersion blender a little to make it thicker while still having nice chunks of veggies and then threw the sausage back in.  We loved this!
