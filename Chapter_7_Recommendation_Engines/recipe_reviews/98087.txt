I loved this cookie!  Tender, flavorful, perfect texture.  Tahini is an acquired taste, but isn't too overpowering in this recipe.  Like others, I found that the cookies will fall apart if you handle them while they're still hot.  Rather than use a wire cooling rack, I used a grill pan to cool them on.  They fall through the wire rack.  If you allow the full cooling time, they hold together fine.

This recipe, as is, is GREAT. The cookies are light and delicate. I did have to add some extra flour (about 1/4 c). 
A friend of mine from Syria loved them, but for my kids, while the cookies were warm, I sifted a very little bit of powdered sugar on top. 
DELICIOUS enough for tea or church function.

We made these according to the recipe, and they were awesome. The texture is similar to peanut butter cookies, but without the peanut flavor.

I scaled this recipe down to 20 servings and made the following changes: added 2 heaping Tbsp. of honey, 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar, and 1.5 tsp. of cinnamon, and used margarine instead of butter. They turned out phenomenal! I greased a cookie sheet with Pam (with olive oil flavor) and the cookies came right off the sheet when they were still warm. They were a little greasy because of this maybe, but they didn't even last long enough to cool completely because my friends and family gobbled them up as soon as I put them on a plate! Great flavor and texture! Everyone of my friends loved them! THANKS!!!!

I thought these cookies were wonderful.  The texture and flavor were perfect.  I did not change a thing in the recipe, and won't the next time I make them.  I always make my drop cookies using an ice cream scoop, for these I used my smallest one and was able to get 18 cookies on each sheet (since they do not spread much) for a total of 47.  I baked them 16 minutes, however, they did not turn golden brown, but were done.  I left them on the cookie sheets until totally cooled, actually about an hour as I was doing other things.  They came off the cookie sheets easily with no problems and did not break apart but I think if handled roughly they would.  For anyone that has eaten halvah the taste is very similar but I think these have a better texture.

I am not familiar with tahini, just needed to use some up that had been in the fridge for who knows how long.  It's very bitter, isn't it?  I added another 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 Tbsp Adams chunky peanut butter to the dough.  These cookies were gone in two days!  My kids loved them, and I had them in the morning with coffee.  The texture is perfect, melt in your mouth like a peanut butter cookie should.  (My 9 y/o said, "sandy") Only four stars because I still would have liked them sweeter.  Oh, and I used parchment paper and let them cool before touching them, they held together great.  Try them!

Were crumbly, as other have commented. Taste was still good, and people liked them at the pot luck I made them for.

These cookies are delicious! Unusual, just sweet enough,delicate texture,very sophisticated. Must follow cooling directions exactly. I topped mine with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds. Great way to use up left-over tahini paste from other recipes.

I, too, attempted to take the cookies off the sheet too early and learned real quick that that was a bad idea! They set right up if you let them cool for a bit. The original recipe was great in itself, but I tried adding sliced almonds and some raw sugar to the next batch. Those ones spread out quite a bit, so next time I'll make them smaller. They came out a little chewier, which my friends seemed to prefer. Both batches were a huge hit with my friends and were gobbled up - except for my one friend who said they tasted too much like halvah, which he doesn't really like. As someone else said, tahini is definitely an acquired taste.

I changed a lot, so I feel wierd commenting on it.  I added an egg, 1/4 cup honey, substituted vanilla with almond extract, added a half cup of slivered almonds, 2 cups of oats, used 2 cups of flour, and 1/3 cup of cornstarch.  The cookies were good, but still not sweet enough.  good luck to anyone else who tries it!

Excellent. I added a bit of honey to keep it moist after seeing how dry the flour made it. You definitely need to let them sit for 10 minutes at least, or else they'll fall apart. Otherwise, absolutely wonderful!

I agree these cookies are good! I changed it by using dark brown sugar and some cinnamon, though you can't really taste either. The only problem is that like others said, these are fragile cookies that crumble easily. I think the trick is just to make very small cookies. This was a great way for me to get rid of the rest of my tahini!

I made the recipe as indicated, and found them to have a slightly bitter aftertaste from the tahini (please keep in mind that I love halvah, so I'm not opposed to the flavor), as well as prone to fall apart even when cooled fully.  I feel that a full cup of butter may be too much for this recipe, so I added a couple of heaping tablespoons of flour and water to the remaining batter to improve the consistency, and a squirt of honey to curb the bitterness.  This was an improvement, but I don't know if this recipe will be made often.

These cookies were a mess. I followed the directions exactly but the cookies fell apart when I tried to transfer them to a wire rack. And they tasted bad.

I made these for my daughter's 3rd grade class for her project on Israel.  It wasn't a huge hit with all of the kids because of the unique tahini flavor, but the parents liked them and so did I.  I added a few tablespoons of honey per previous review.  I had no problems with crumbling (I let them cool on the cookie sheet, and then on a rack - as per the directions).

I followed the recipe exactly but used margarine. These were way too oily and even after chilling 45 min. quickly spread across the cookie pan when baked. I'll try them again, halving the butter amount.

I made these cookies with some leftover Tahini.  They were delicious and tasted so much like halvah (sesame candy).  2 of my 3 boys loved them. The one who did not like does not like halvah candy either.  The one problem was the cookies crumbled and fell apart easily even after I let them cool 45 minutes on the cookie sheet.  I used the insulated cookie sheet for baking, did not have any trouble removing them but they were fragile and would crumble or break in my hand.  My solution was instead of serving as a cookie, was to put the remaining cookies in a glass mason jar.  This is now being stored in the fridge.  I will take a spoonful and sprinkle it over vanilla ice cream for a special dessert.  Delish!!!  I also placed 2-3 semisweet chocolate chips on each cookie while baking for variety.   From now on this will be my solution for using leftover Tahini!

Very nice recipe, but for thicker, softer, and moister cookies I used 3 parts brown sugar and double the spoonful size.

A great tasting cookie. Quick and easy to make. It’s an excellent substitute for peanut butter cookies when “peanut free” is required.

Light and crispy with a delicate richness that reminded me of pecan sandies. Mine spread out more than I'd expected them to, and all kind of joined up. Next time, I'll space them better. Delicious cookie!
