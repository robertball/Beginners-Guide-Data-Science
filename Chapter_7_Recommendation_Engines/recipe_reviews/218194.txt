This recipe is easy and delicious! I tried this with leftover ham and it was great. I made some minor modifications to accomodate what I had on hand and I served it over egg noodles with a side salad. Instead of fresh tomato, I used a can of diced tomatoes; instead of croutons, I used crumbled ritz crackers; and I just used regular mayonnaise.

Pretty yummy and super easy!  I need to find a way to make it less salty... may be if I could find some plain unseasoned croutons.

Very good for a quick and easy dinner.  I used regular mayonnaise, which was fine.

Sooo easy and so so good! Thank you for sharing.  Follwed exactly.  Used a little of sharp shredded cheddar in addition to other cheese to get full amount of what recipe calls for.

I just started cooking and usually not very good at it, but this was a simple recipe and turned out superb. My boyfriend raved all evening about it and brought the left overs to work the next day. Usually he hates my cooking :)

Quick, easy, and delicious! My husband doesn't usually like tomatoes, but they were a must in this yummy dish, and he ate them!

We loved this! I used store baked deli ham and cubed it and a can of diced Italian tomatos, partly drained. I also added a small amount of chopped green pepper and cheddar jack cheese. This will be on the Christmas Eve menu along with lots of finger foods! Thanks!
