I made this for Recipe Group.  First I browned my chuck roast pieces in a little of the oil and deglazed the pan with the tomatoes and their juice.  I was not at all sure why the oil was necessary, but used about half of it anyway.  I skipped using the high setting on my slow cooker and instead cooked this for 7 hours on low.  The meat was tender, flaked easily and was still very moist.  Our plans changed for that evening, so before shredding it, I placed it in the refrigerator until the next day.  When I took it out to shred, I saw that a lot of fat had risen to the top and congealed, so I removed as much of it as I could.  I didnâ€™t return the shredded meat to the slow cooker because there was so much liquid remaining with the vegetables that I would have ended up with stew.  I drained as much liquid from the veggies as I could, but still ended up serving them on the side.  We had this wrapped in a tortilla, along with shredded lettuce, sour cream and salsa.  I also served Mexican Rice III (very good) also from this site, as a side.  This was good and I liked the hint of lime flavor, but next time I would eliminate the oil, using only enough to sear the meat.  And I would also skip the beef broth, perhaps replacing it with some bouillon granules.

My family loved this! I used half a beer instead of the beef broth (I forgot to buy broth) and it came out perfectly - I will make again and stick with the beer.

Whoa! After moving from Arizona to Virginia we tired several mexican restaurants and nobody makes machacca beef. After several failed attempts to find a restarant that can make it, I took to the kitchen myself.  I was afraid between the jalapeno, chili powder, and cumin, that this would be too spicy, but that turned out not to be the case.  I followed the recipe to the letter, only omitting the oil, and it was AMAZING!  Putting the meat back in the slow cooker after shredding it, is a must.  Letting it cook in all those juices after shredding it really makes it special.  I had a lot of juice in the crock pot in the end, so i just pulled the meat out with tongs to serve in burritos, and then used a slotted spoon to remove the left overs.  We've used this several ways...burritos, tacos, nachos...always amazing!

Tastes EXACTLY like my local hole in the wall's Machaca Beef. I wasn't sure what some reviewers meant by "didn't taste very Mexican." The large amounts of cumin and oregano are tell tale signs that this dish is going to taste authentic. I know some people expect Mexican to taste one certain way, but that's like expecting bacon wrapped little smokies and boxed mac and cheese to share the same flavor profile since they are both American junkfood, right? Also, this dish is supposed to be soupy, whenever you get it at a restaurant, the beef is making the tortilla or bun soggy, from all the tomatoes and peppers and onions and beef drippings.

I made this for the recipe group selection of the week. I almost shouldn't rate this because I used a bottom round roast, but then thought I'd let everyone know it won't shred like a chuck roast will. I had to slice it instead of shredding after six hours and then put it back into the liquid on warm for about another 30 minutes. However, other than just rubbing the roast with olive oil, I followed the recipe and the flavor was wonderful. My meat was still so tender and although not real Mexican tasting it was very flavorful and juicy. We made tacos and my sons made flour tortilla wraps. You will need a slotted spoon to scoop out your meat though, a whole lot of liquid in the pot. I liked the cooked veggies on my taco. I'll probably try this one again, maybe up the spice some for more Mexican flavor. Thanks FireGuysWife.

I'm not sure what I don't care for in this recipe, it is either the Worcestershire sauce which to me does not lend to the Mexican taste I was expecting or the undrained juice from the diced tomato or the sour undertone of the lime or maybe the combination. I don't know. The recipe worked well just not my taste. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*)

We love this recipe.  I make it with elk roast. My family likes it in burritos and tacos. I freeze the leftover for later it is just as good.

Served this to company for casual taco dinner. Just put out the trimmings and everyone can make their taco to their liking. It was huge hit! Only mod I made was I used meat with bone-in (butcher suggested). When you cook the meat on low in the crock for that long... the bone will easily fall off for you to throw away.

I use a can of enchilada sauce, omit the Worcestershire sauce, add lemon juice, a cup of pico de gallo and some cilantro during cooking and after when I shred it and toss it together.  I Love love me some Machacha.

I salt pepper the beef -- sear it all sides throw in crock.  I omit beef broth as the fire roasted canned tomatoes have enough liquid and the beef sweats in the crock.  I also add el guano especias mixtas spice mix -- it's mustard seed, cumin, Anatto, pepper, coriander seed, pepper, all spice, bay leaf.  And make sure to use Mexican oregano.  Hands down the best shredded beef dish I have ever made.

Wonderful recipe, super simple.  Have made this 5-6 times and am planning on making it again this weekend.  The hardest part is smelling it all day and knowing you have to wait 6 more hours.  A couple minor changes that got the thumbs up from my family; I double the cumin, and use a poblano pepper instead of jalapenos.

My favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix serves great machaca, and I wanted to try to make it at home.  This was close, and everyone liked it, except there was a little note of something that just didn't quite work for me.  I will definitely make it again, tweaking it a bit to see if I can't fix that.  Overall, though, really nice beef, moist and tender.  It made great burritos.  And this is exactly what machaca is supposed to be - it isn't supposed to taste like ground beef taco filling.

Not too bad although I did cut the W sauce,  lime juice and oil in half which I am glad I did as it was just sour enough...

I had a Santa Maria seasoned tri tip in my freezer that had been in there for quite awhile and I decided to use it to make this. I chopped it into large chunks, then followed the rest of the recipe.  It did take somewhat longer to cook to the shredding stage but the flavor was great.  I can hardly wait to heat up some of the leftovers with eggs and cheese mixed in.

First time attempting to make machaca. I substituted either organic or fresh ingredients when possible. I used a 3 lb grass-fed/hormone free chuck roast. I skipped the olive oil, Worcestershire, limes, bell pepper, canned tomatoes, chili powder, black pepper and beef broth. Instead I used 5 medium organic tomatoes, 1 whole bulb of organic garlic and 8 oz. of assorted organic hot pepper mix (habanero, serrano and jalapeno).  I pretty much added the rest of the ingredients of the original recipe and followed the cooking instructions. This makes a very hot and spicy version of machaca.

I made this the other day for my wife and I.  It was really good and easy to make.  I used a tablespoon of chili powder because I didn't think a teaspoon was enough and only used 1/2 the oil since I thought it was too much.  And since it is hatch chili season, I added a whole chili with seeds for some extra zip.  We had lots leftover which I combined with scrambled eggs to make breakfast tacos with fresh pico.  It's a keeper!

Great recipe! We don't like green peppers, so I used an 8 oz can of green chilies instead. I also switched out the diced tomatoes for a 15 o can of tomato sauce as my husband does not like cooked tomatoes. We use this for burritos, nachos, tacos and enchiladas.

I used an untrimmed rib roast and let most of the fat render.  I also used Chipotle Chili Powder and added in the seeds from the jalapeno.  We like things hot!  I took warm refried beans and smeared them on a flour tortilla and put the machaca on top with some fresh tomato.  It was wonderfully flavorful and filling.

Made this today, was in the mood for something easy and tasty. I got the easy part, following the directions specifically. I feel it lacked an "umph" if you will. The flavor was good, not great. It's a keeper, but I'll definitely figure out how to change it next time.
