My family and I really enjoyed this chicken dish, although I would suggest a bit less cooking time at the end (15-minute period should be more like 10-12). It was sound advice to suggest not serving this meal until the spicy flavours had melded. I'll definitely make it again!

Super simple even for a non-chef like me and still so delicious! Served with rice and was a hit.

Iâ€™ve never tried a recipe with no reviews yet, but it looked delicious and I had everything needed (except the Dutch oven, so I used a heavy pan).  I found it tangy and delicious. The chicken was very tender and juicy.

My family said it needed more salt. I was content with the seasonings.
