This version is NOT the same as the famous Long Island iced tea, not by any stretch of the imagination.  Not being one to waste booze however, I added a ton more Coke and a lot of crushed ice.  If you were to drink this as written, it reminds me of something I'd do on a dare when I was up at Penn State....(then pay for it dearly the next day).

This cocktail has the dubious distinction of being both super strong AND super sweet...no enjoyable in my world, even w/the addition of my Coke Zero.

These are awesome!  I used to make these when I bartended.  They do pack a punch!
