I made this pretty much as directed. I used 4 thighs, one apple, one onion, and one large potato. (I cook for two.) Next time I will use two apples. I also used brown sugar, instead of white. I greased the bottom pan with butter, instead of spray. Nice recipe. This would work with pork chops too, I think.

It was really good. I read the reviews & instead of using white sugar, I used brown sugar. I only used 2 apples. My family loved it! The only thing the potatoes & apples & onions where moshi , really soft. But overall had an amazing taste.

Excellent! Flavor was fantastic, but 4 stars instead of 5 due to inconsistencies between recipe and my results. As written, the recipe would NEVER fit in a broiler pan that I’ve ever owned. I sautéed onions in a 6 qt enamel cast iron Dutch oven, added potatoes  & apples (used 4 small). It was over ½ full at this point!  I seasoned the chicken & placed on top of potato mixture. I had this in the 400 degree oven for more than an hour and not all the potatoes were done, and the chicken wasn’t browning. I turned up the oven temp to 425 convection for about 20 minutes and it finished the chicken nicely. There ended up being more liquid than I would have expected so it braised more than roasted. I’ll make this again but next time may roast chicken separately to avoid all the juice. My picky eaters even liked it :)

I made this exactly by the recipe and it was delicious!  I never would have mixed onions, apples, and potatoes but the mixture of flavors was great.  In fact, it would make a good side dish for by itself.  The chicken picked up a bit of the apple flavor mixed with the rosemary.  The cooking time was off, though.  I checked with an instant read thermometer after 40 minutes and the chicken was done.

This was really good ...Who knew apples and potatoes together.
I think even kids would like this.
Nice and sweet.
I didn't have a broiler pan, I fried the chicken 1st to crisp it, and then laid it on top of the potatoes/apple mixture.
Second time I made it , I baked the chick and potato/apple in separate pans, I liked it this way the best....

Made this tonight and-it-is-awesome!  I did season the mix in the bottom of the roaster with salt, pepper, a dash more sugar and 3 rosemary sprigs, as well as some lemon juice. Then when cooked, brushed thighs with melted butter and left it in a bit to brown up. Next time, I'll prepare some bacon to mix into the bottom layer, and wrap the chicken thighs in bacon. MMMMM!

I tried this fall recipe on the first major snow fall of the year.  We all loved it.  The chicken had a lovely flavour of rosemary with a hint of the apple cooking below it.  It was as good or better than I expected.  We all loved it and will use it again!!  Thanks!!

Rosemary is the perfect herb to make kitchen smell wonderful but thighs are greasy so the potatoes were greasy and the apples also smelled good but turned to mush.  Won't make this recipe again.

Great flavor!  Instead of roasting, we did the potatoes, onions and apples in a skillet.  Grilled the chicken and then combined!

A delicious recipe. The combination of  potatoes, onions and apples was fabulous. I followed the recipe except baked it in a covered roasting pan instead of on a broiler. 
Simple and scrumptuous!

I will definitely make AGAIN!!! My "squirrels" grandgirls who are very picky-eaters LOVED this dish and beg me to make again SOON and I plan to do just that.
I did not make any changes; great just as is.
Thanks for sharing.
