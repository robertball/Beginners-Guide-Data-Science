Great recipe to start with and add to.  We threw a cinnamon stick and some whole cloves into the cider while it boiled/simmered, increased the cider and butter, and skipped the pepper.  We also used a high-quality cider - this may make a difference in the quality of flavor.  Made an excellent, if rich, side dish.

I did not care for this recipe. Our family loves sweet potatoes and also cider. Thought they would be very good together.

Yummy!!!  My 2 yr old and my 9 month old devoured them. I added a little extra butter and next time I may try a little brown sugar too.

Yummy! I do agree with sarah that a high-quality cider does make a difference and I did sprinkle a bit of a warm spice mix while the mixture simmered away as others had suggested. This was a great lower calorie way to prepare sweet potatoes. Thank you friday13th777 for sharing this recipe!

This really smells great while cooking.  I added a pinch of cinnamon, allspice, and cloves, and an extra tablespoon of butter.  Delicious.

While very good separately, I'm not sure that the combination of the sweet potatoes and apple cider works well. Just OK.

These make a lot more than 4 servings.  I made 1 lb of sweet potatoes and that would serve 4 servings.  I simmered the sweet potatoes in about 1/2 cup apple cider....on low it took at least 30 minutes.  I did add a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice.  These are worth making again.  Thanks.

Definitely my favorite sweet potato recipe!  The apple cider provides a really distinctive flavor.  I used spiced cider.  This dish has a nice flavor with a tiny bit of tartness and without the overwhelming sugary sweetness of many sweet potato recipes.
