This was an enjoyable twist on nachos. I made half with the feta and half with a Mexican cheese mix because my husband doesn't like "fetid" cheese. LOL. I love feta but prefered this recipe with the Mexican cheese mix myself. Either way, it's different and yummy.

This is so good!  I was looking for something to make with leftover meat spaghetti sauce so I used that with salsa.  I didn't have jalapenos or I'm sure it would have been even better.  I did make it in 2 batches so I could get all the chips covered with the toppings.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Everyone gobbled them up.  This will definitely become a regular in my kitchen!

Not a crumb left on the platter.  All 5 kids gave a big thumbs up.

The kids thought it was "ok".  I thought it was very salty. I wasn't sure what type of sausage to use (hot or sweet) and I bought hot. That may have been the problem. Plus, the feta was salty.   So, I'm hesitant to pan this recipe because maybe I did something wrong.  Maybe try w sweet sausage and use cheddar like other reviewers suggested.
