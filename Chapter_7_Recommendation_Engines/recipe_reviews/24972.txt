With no disrespect to other reviewers who had a variety of issues and criticisms with this recipe, it occurs to me that either they are too familiar with boxed yellow cake, or are unfamiliar with basic, scratch, cake making techniques. True, boxed yellow cake is more moist, but it tastes, well, like boxed cake mix, which is unmistakable and just plain bad. True, scratch butter cakes can have a tendency to be a little dry, particularly yellow butter cakes.  But this yellow cake is definitely better than any I have ever tried in my 50 years of baking--more moist than most, flavorful, and with a light and tender crumb. Cream your butter and sugar well, a good few minutes.  This is key for a light and fluffy cake! Follow the recipe directions carefully--add yolks one at a time, blending well after each addition. Add the flour and milk separately and with a light hand, beginning and ending with the flour. And do not overbake! If your cake is dry or dense you are not following the directions. I made half a recipe in an 8x8" pan and frosted it with half a recipe of "Buttercream Icing." I challenge you to find a better yellow cake with buttercream frosting in any well-respected neighborhood bakery, or in any old-fashioned baker's recipe box!

This is the BEST yellow cake recipe there is.My search ends here.The only difference that i did was to take away 2tbsps of the regular AP flour in each cup and substitute it with 2tbsps of cornstarch as suggested by another reviewer.I did this as i didnt have any cake flour on hand.The cake came out moist,fluffy and delish.Beats a boxed mix anyday.
As a tip for new bakers like myself:
1.Absolutely do sift the flour and baking powders twice for maximum integration.
2.Do beat the yolks one by one ,it adds to the fluffiness.
3.Once the batter is poured into the pan,tap the pan a few times on top of the counter so that batter will spread evenly and rise evenly.

This is the best yellow cake recipe. I normally use 4 whole eggs instead of the 8 yolks (because I don't really have a use for the whites) and I use regular all-purpose flour and it comes out great every time. I usually frost my cakes with buttercream icing and everyone tells me they are great. Thanks for the recipe!

After trying this recipe for the first time I found it a little dry, dense, and eggy, so I experimented with it to change the flavor and texture. I used 5 eggs, 3 whole eggs, 2 egg yolks, I added 1/2 cup more flour(all purpose), instead of 3/4 c milk I used 1 1/4 cup low-fat buttermilk (to make more moist). After making these few adjustments my cakes come out just the way I like them Good!

Cornbread my Aunt Fanny.  I don't know where people are getting the idea that this cake tastes like cornbread.  I don't know what kind of cornbread you all are eating but last time I checked cornbread had cornmeal in it.

The first time I baked this cake, I forgot to take out the egg whites - Yuck! It was really bad.  However, the next time, I took the egg whites out and I was blown away - this is by far the best tasting yellow cake I have ever had!  And I don't bake - ever!  The fact that it came out so amazingly well absolutely floored me!  My family loved it too!  IF ever I need to fix a yellow cake again, I won't go near a cake mix.  David, Betty Crocker doesn't have anything on you!

I've used this recipe several times now after experimenting with some other yellow cake recipes found on this site.  This is by far the moistest, most delicious homemade yellow cake I've ever baked, and I bake a lot.  I took a suggestion from other reviewers and used 4 yolks and 2 whole eggs.  I've baked it in all forms: cupcakes(1/2 full about 15 min), 2 9" rounds (20-21 min), 9x13 (30 min) and it always comes out amazingly.  For those people having problems with your cake sinking--check your baking powder and make sure it is fresh.  Old/stale baking powder is the prime cause of cakes sinking.  Just want to send a big THANK YOU to David for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I've made this cake several times and I think it's so moist that I like to eat it without any icing on it at all.  It is not dry as others have stated.  If you think it's too dry you're either not measuring the ingredients properly, not using the ingredients stated in the recipe, or you're overbaking the cake.  Use a toothpick to test if the cake is done.  Touching the top of the cake to see if it springs back isn't as a reliable test for doneness with this cake.

The cake does smell and taste eggy when it first comes out of the oven but when it cools off the eggy taste goes away.  An angel food cake is the same way.  If you eat a piece of it while it's still slightly warm it will taste eggy.  After it's cooled off the eggy taste goes away. If the cake comes out dry it means you're baking it too long.  Watch for the cake to rise up in the middle and then deflate slightly.  It's at this point you should to see if the cake is done.  If a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out with wet batter then give cake about 5 more minutes and check it again.  If the toothpick comes out with gummy batter on it then give it about 3 more minutes.  If it comes out with a few crumbs sticking to it then it's done.  If it comes out perfectly clean then it's definitely done and may in fact be overdone.  I'd also like to add that if you're going to change any of the ingredients in this recipe then you shouldn't expect it to come out right.  Changing the ingredients and then giving a poor review is unfair to the person who submitted the recipe.

Okay, so here's the thing. I made this with my five year old son and for all that know him, he's kind of a spastic. I was worried about the outcome of this cake because first, we lost track of the count of the egg yolks (I THINK we put in eight, but I can't be sure--it was kind of chaotic) and then I didn't have cake flour so I googled what to do to make the AP flour I had work (minus two tablespoons flour). We followed the directions pretty closely EXCEPT we added the milk slowly at the end because.....we'll, like I said, it was chaotic. We taste-tested the batter and even before baking, it was OMG good. Like almost sugary custardy awesomeness. My youngest and I watched the cake bake in the oven via the oven light (food t.v.) and even with our maybe accidental mix up of counting egg yolks and adding the milk last, we still had a beautifully risen cake that baked up just like it was supposed to. Hoo-rah! I don't get all the bad reviews. If my son and I can pull off this cake, you can, too! We haven't had a chance to taste test it yet, but we will after dinner and I'll update my review then. EDITED: This cake turned out dry and crumbled just like cornbread, just like a lot of the reviews stated it would. Darn. I'll try this again and maybe cut back the baking time by five minutes. Baking it for thirty minutes just was too long, maybe. I think it might even be a little too sweet, but the boys liked it so I'll leave the sugar as is. This would be a good base for Pop Cake.

I've now used this recipe several times and it just gets better and better!  I didn't want to use 8 egg yolks and essentially waste the whites so I modified this recipe and made a white cake by using 4 whole eggs instead.  I read the other reviews and was nervous that this scratch cake recipe wouldn't taste good, because I thought it would be dry.  Using NAPLES advice, I was sure to cream my butter and sugar together for a long time.  I first cut my butter into 1/2 inch pats, creamed that.  I then added sugar in about 1/4 cup increments (guessing) and creamed that until my sugar and butter looked light and fluffy.  I added one egg at a time scraping down the sides after each time.  I turned my mixer off and stirred in my vanilla extract.  I started and ended with my sifted flour mixture and added the milk in 2 parts while the flour mixture took 3 parts.  In the end, it was light and fluffy (truly, the batter looked gorgeous) and I've made cupcakes every time.  I only bake for about 13-15 minutes and I have the perfect cupcake.  JDSIMON/DAVE - this recipe is a true winner!

I usually just use box cakes but didn't have one in the house so I tried this one.  The cake was delicious and moist.  The only drawback was using 8 egg yolks.  It seems like a lot to use (especially if you pay for organic eggs!)  But, I like the idea of my kids ingesting butter instead of loads of hydrogenated fat in the boxes.

delicious and fluffy but it can be a little dry. i add a bit more milk and a couple of more egg yolks. Also instead of cake flour i used regular flour since and added a bit more baking powder and salt. This is the best yellow cake so far.

Thought I would try this recipe in place of an old one I use for a carmel cake.  This cake worked so well, especially with pecans in it.  I got alot of complements on the moistness of the cake.  It's now replacing the old cake recipe I normally use.

I have made a lot of cakes in my life -- always searching for a good one.  This is it.  It has a wonderful flavor and texture.  Not too dense, not to spongey.  As others mentioned, be sure to beat the butter and sugar together well.  Then, beat well after adding each egg yolk.  For baking, I set the timer for 20 minutes and watched it carefully -- pulling it out when it bounced back a bit when pressed in the center.  Don't let the top and edges get browned because then it will be dry.  I think this is the best cake I've ever made.  I highly recommend it.

This is a great cake recipe. The way a classic yellow cake should taste, possibly better. If a box mix cake is what you are hoping to get, you should probably stick with the box, which is filled with all kinds of ingredients and chemicals that you just won't find in a real homemade quality cake like this recipe. I cut the recipe in half and made cupcakes with it. They came out light and flavorful and moist with a delicate crumb. As another reviewer stated, take the time to really cream your butter and sugar in the beginning, adding yolks one at a time and beating thoroughly. This, plus sifting the flour and baking powder and salt, really makes a difference in texture. When alternating the flour mixture with the milk, start and end with flour, splitting the flour into thirds and the milk in half. This will ensure everything is incorporated and will help prevent over mixing, which will make the cake tough and dry. Try this recipe, it's SO delicious!

This is my "go to" cake recipe anytime I make cupcakes or cake. It is incredible. For cupcakes, I bake at 350 for 18-20 minutes. I have tried different combinations on the egg yolks and find that 7 egg yolks plus 1 whole egg works best. Try this and you'll never buy a boxed mix again.

This cake recipe acted more more like corn bread.
The flavor just isnt that good, and the texture is horrible. David should come up with a new one to replace this one.

I bake everything from scratch, and I've made many yellow cake recipes - this one is by far my favorite! It is incredibly moist, and yellow cakes usually aren't. (Unless you buy those chock-full-o'-chemicals box mixes - yuck!) The crumb on this cake is almost a sticky kind of moist, and it is beyond flavorful.  You DO need to follow the directions carefully, though - and you have to use the exact ingredients for which the recipe calls. If you blanch at the idea of using eight full egg yolks in a cake recipe or you can't be bothered to get *cake* flour, don't be surprised if the cake isn't as good as you'd hoped. In my opinion, a stand mixer is a must in order to cream the butter and sugar to the proper loft and sufficiently beat the eggs to build up the protein strands in the eggs to give the batter enough structure. The dry ingredients should be mixed *just* enough to incorporate, and not a minute more. I made this recipe as cupcakes for my daughter (whose favorite color is yellow and thus wanted as much yellow for her birthday as she could get her paws on!), and everyone - adults and children alike - swooned for these.  Follow the directions faithfully and you will have a yellow cake to die for!

Tried this for the first time for my daughter's birthday cake and it turned out perfect. Everyone loved it! I'm not sure how anyone could rate this recipe negatively, but I have a feeling they missed one of the following keys to baking from scratch:
* ALL ingredients (eggs, butter, milk especially) MUST be at room temperature
* Cream the butter and sugar until it's really fluffy (this takes patience)
* SLOWLY mix in one yolk at a time, barely blending
* SIFT all of the dry ingredients.
* SLOWLY mix in a small amount (about a third) of the flour, blending completely. Then about a third of the milk, blending completely. Repeat until all flour and milk is gone.

I also made my own cake flour by measuring out 2 cups of all-purpose flour, removing 4 Tbsp, replacing it with 4 Tbsp of cornstarch, then sifting the mixture 5 times. 

Following this procedure takes some time, but made a super silky batter!

I can't tell you how many yellow cake recipes I've tried, searching for The One. All the other recipes have yielded cakes that were either cornbread-y, oily, coarse, or lacking in flavor. THIS one is the perfect yellow cake recipe. Smooth, fluffily dense texture, perfectly moist without an oily appearance, and the FLAVOR! I guess it's all the egg yolks; instead of just tasting like vanilla, this cake has a rich, rounded flavor - its own flavor. THIS is what yellow cake should be, in every way.

Just made this cake last night. Read reviews, made following changes; 1 cup milk, regular flour and 4 whole eggs not 8 yolks. Came out terrific. Also used 9 x 13 pan, time was 40 minutes in oven using that pan. This is a moist, hearty, delicious cake. I used it as the base for a banana torte. I layered fresh bananas, old-fashioned vanilla pudding, and whipped cream frosting. DELICIOUS!

* * * BEST CAKE EVER * * *
I have tried over 25 recipes for yellow cake made from scratch, and NOTHING, I mean NOTHING compares to how perfect this recipe is.  If you follow the instructions to the letter you will get a perfect yellow cake every single time.  I just baked 4 separate cakes with this recipe and each and every one was AMAZINGLY PERFECT.  To describe the cake - basically its moist, the top is beautiful, the sides come out golden, and there is zero gritty taste, zero crumble - just perfection.  No artificial taste like with boxed cake mix.  The cake is to die for!

I have been making boxed yellow cakes for years and passing them off as my own, homemade with "special American ingredients" (I live in Italy). I finally got caught when one of my daughter's teachers begged me for the recipe and having to come up with something, I spent one Sunday and made about 6 cakes all from this site. This cake won all the awards!!!!! Thank you for helping me out of a decade old lie!!!

I've made this cake several times and it's always come out beautifully. 
I do like my cakes less sweet so I've cut it down to 1 cup of sugar. I've discovered a secret... for a really great textured cake is to beat the butter and sugar till almost all the granuals are gone. Then add the egg yolks as instructed and beat till all the sugar granuals have melted into the mixture. Plus add 1/4 cup of canola or my choice is grapeseed oil for a moist cake. Then add the flour/milk as instructed. I think you'll notice a huge improvement with the final result.

This cake turned out great.  I just made it for my son's birthday party.  I made two versions and cooked them in a 9x13 nonstick pan lined with parchment paper.  The first batch I made my own cake flour with 2tbl cornstarch and 1/2 tsp baking powder per cup of flour (and in addition, I still added the 2 tsp baking powder the recipe calls for).  I also used buttermilk instead of milk and added 1/4 tsp baking soda to counteract acidity.  Finally I used four egg yolks and two eggs - beating the egg whites and folding them into the batter before the flour addition.  The batter was so thick I thought it was a dud but this turned out fluffy, rose nicely,was fantastic.  The second batch I again made my own cake flour and used regular milk and four eggs, beating the egg whites and adding them after the flour.  The batter was not as thick which I thought would work better but this cake turned out only OK - it didn't rise as much, was a little overdone looking.  Didn't taste bad, just wasn't as good as the first.  So to review - I would suggest using buttermilk and six egg - eight egg yolks.  For those that had dry texture - one reason could be the eggs weren't at room temp - if they are cold they will ruin your cake.

This baked up into a respectable cake. It is quite yellow, as promised, because of all those yolks. However, what I learned is that there is something very positive to be said of cakes that also utilize whole eggs. That something is lightness. Although these layers were quite moist and tender as promised, the crumb was dense. I prefer a less heavy, more feathery cake. Not only is this possible, it is relatively easy to achieve. A superior recipe to this one is Yellow Clooney Cake on this website. If you try them both, I'm confident you'll agree. All in all, this is a reasonable option that won't undermine your reputation for baking prowess. It's just not, however, as close to my ideal as the recipe mentioned above.

Very good.  I did change one thing - I mixed it for 2 minutes (not just til incorporated).  I've learned that if I mix a cake for 2 minutes it will be lighter and not so dense and it worked with this cake too.  It wasn't a heavy taste, like so many homemade yellow cakes are.  I will be making this again - it's a great way to use up egg  yolks left over from making an angel food cake!  Freeze them until needed.

Holy . At first I was a little worried because of all the bad reviews, but I am SOOOO glad I went with my gut and tried this recipe! I followed it to the letter, and beat the hell out of the butter/sugar, and after each egg. I don't like my sifter, so I threw it out....instead I put all the dry ingredients in a bowl and wisk them over and over again, to get the air in there. It works like a charm! I got 28 cupcakes from this. I tried the batter before I baked it and it is FANTASTIC! I couldn't wait till the cupcakes were cooled off, I HAD to try one. I don't know what the previous reviewers were talking about when they said it was dry or tasted like cornbread. It was moist, and the most delicious yellow cake I have EVER had! Make sure you beat the  out of the butter/sugar/yokes, and only mix in the flour mix and milk until incorporated, starting and ending with flour. It seriously makes all the difference!

Great recipe!  So moist and tender.  Really soft texture.  I think it's all the butter and egg yolks.  I usually use Moist Yellow Cake, but this will replace this for sure!  Easy to make too.  Thanks David!!

I have another yellow cake recipe that I use when making cupcakes, and this one was much better! There was so much flavor, the texture was moist and smooth with just enough crumble. I will definitely be making this again! If I wasn't making it for an event I would have eaten it all myself! For those who did not like this recipe, it was probably due to over mixing or over baking. That seems to be the most common error in baking. I urge you to try again. It really does turn out very good!

I wanted to make a REAL birthday cake--and not from a box. This is the recipe! I've made this recipe twice, and it is so moist and delicious. I frosted the cake with a simple chocolate frosting of whipping cream, confectioners sugar, and cocoa. Just wonderful!

Anyone who complains about this recipe is either incapable of reading and thus following directions becomes a problem or they didn't follow directions yet still claimed to.  This cake is the best of any Yellow Cake recipes I've ever tried. I'm tossing out all of them and only using this one from now on. As stated by someone else, the key is to make sure you cream the butter and sugar really well. If you don't and the cake doesn't come out the way you'd like it to, then it's your own fault.

Sorry to give such a negative review, but this cake was not even what I'd classify as 'cake'. More like a chewy bar or something. I've baked and sold many, many cakes and have never had results like this with any recipe. It looked interesting with the egg yolks, so I though I'd give it a try.  Instinct said, use whole eggs, and I'm thinking that instinct was right.  Followed recipe exactly and sunk to less than 1/2 inch thick in the middle, sides raised to the edge of the pan and crunchy, with a very oily, strange texture. That being said, the actual taste of this was very good. Buttery and rich, but there is something definitely wrong with the overall recipe.

Fantastic and so easy!  The best part is that the ingredients are generally on hand in the kitchen, so no special trips to the grocery store!  I took the advice of another reviewer and used 4 whole eggs (rather than 8 yolks).  I also did not have 8 inch cake pans, only 9 inch.  These worked just fine, but may have been why I had to very slightly adjust the baking time- the cakes were done in 20 minutes.  Came out wonderfully- I've been looking for a classic yellow cake recipe to keep in my cookbook... this is the one I'll be using from now on!  Thanks!

I normally don't do reviews, but I had to on this one.  Melt in your mouth sweet, MOIST, butter tasting cake.  And I didn't have Vanilla at home either.  I tried this recipe May 2006, because I wanted to try a GOOD homemade cake that was better than Duncan Hines Butter Cake Mix, and THIS IS IT.  Best I ever made from scratch.  I cut the recipe in half, used two whole eggs (one for two egg yolks) plus I added one egg yolk.  I did this because I read another review that said it made it great.  IT IS!

I used the egg whites as well as the yolks. I'm glad I did because it would have been a little too dry without them.  I separated them and made the batter with the yolks like directed then whipped the whites until they were thick and fluffy and folded them in just before pouring them into the pan to bake. I used a 9X13 pan rather than 2 small rounds.  It worked nicely.

This recipe is great.  Very good yellow cake made from scratch.  You must follow this recipe exactly.  Beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Do not under beat the butter and sugar.  Do not over mix wet and dry ingredients and DO NOT OVER BAKE.  Some of the negative comments show that the negative result came from mistakes in the above areas.

I might try this one again.  I've never made yellow cake from scratch before, but something clearly didn't go right with it.  I made cupcakes, and they fell by nearly half when I took them out of the oven.  They were also dry and crumbly on the outside and dense on the inside.  They tasted like overly moist sugar cookies more than they tasted like cake.

I followed the directions step by step using all of the exact ingredients called for with the exception of vanilla extract, half of which I switched out for almond extract.  I creamed the butter and sugar for about 10 minutes until it was really fluffy, and then added the egg yolks one at a time, followed by flour, milk, flour, milk, flour.  It wasn't so much a batter as it was the consistency of cool whip when I spooned it into the cups (is this normal?)

I found this a little on the dry side, but still pretty good.  Followed the batter exactly to recipe, and added some macerated strawberries underneath while baking for a strawberry upside down cake.  The cake is pretty tasty.

Never fails.  This is the best basic cake recipe.  I’ve made this recipe into round layers, a sheet cake, and cupcakes.  Patience is key.  Cream the butter and sugar, adding yolks one at a time, etc. The only thing I do different is sifting the flour, baking powder, and salt three times.  It really makes a fluffy cake, very fluffy.

This cake is unreal.  I've never had batter that tasted so good, and the cake itself didn't even need any frosting!  I still frosted it, but I scraped mine off because I felt like the frosting overpowered the taste of the cake.  I made 24 cupcakes and cooked them for 20 minutes at 350.

Tastes good, but pretty dense. Didn't rise much although I used the whipped egg whites as mentioned in other posts since the yolks alone made it very heavy. I was looking for a basic yellow cake recipe, and this was more the texture of a pound cake.

This has become my favorite yellow cake to make.  It is delicious, and can be used with any combo of fillings and frostings.  My family loves this cake.

Thank you David! I made this yesterday for my mom's bday..she always wants angel food, which I made with 12 egg whites, then she confessed to my daughter that yellow cake is really her favorite..whatever! I used the leftover yolks for this and it was perfect. Followed the recipe exactly as written and it truly is moist and delicious!

I think it's probably important that your eggs are at room temperature before starting. Leave them out for at least and hour before. We loved this cake. It came out wonderfully. Even my super picky in-laws liked it and said it reminded them of the cake that their mothers used to make. The cake was moist, not too sweet, and really wonderful. I made it a non-dairy cake by using margarine and soy milk. Thank you JDSIMON for a great cake recipe!

This was DELICIOUS!! I used this cake recipe and made a coffee cake with it.  The original coffee cake recipe used a box mix, but using this is a million times better!

Followed directions to a tee, and this came out great! Make sure to add the egg yolks one by one and cream well. The consistency of the batter was pretty thick, I was a little worried! I baked in a 13 x 9 glass pan for 25 minutes, but probably should have left it in for another 5 (but I was in a hurry--that's what I get for assembling a cake to bring to a party last minute!) I frosted with Brownie Frosting from this site, and added some nonpareils. Everyone loved this, it's a great basic yellow cake recipe. UPDATE: used 4 whole eggs when I made it this time, instead of 8 yolks, and this still came out so nicely!

I am not a cake lover....but I loved this cake! Even my daughter, who loves all things chocolate, said that this is one of the best cakes she has ever had.  She wanted an ice cream cake, so I put chocolate chip ice cream between the two layers and frosted it with chocolate frosting. Definitely worth using eight egg yolks for the finished product!!

Delicious - if your cake ends up dry, you're NOT doing something right.
Make sure to:
A) Cream the butter and sugar together until super fluffy.  Don't be afraid to overbeat in this phase
B) make sure NOT to overbeat cake mixture! That's how u get the weird clumpy texture on top and thats how it separates. 
C) Make sure the eggs are nice and fluffy as this helps with the cake's rise.

Use 6 egg yolks and 2 egg whites, use buttermilk.

*EXCELLENT* I found this recipe read the reviews altered the cake a little by using four eggs and a box of instant vanilla pudding. It came out very moist and fluffy even after I left it in about 5 minutes longer. An hour after cake was complete, there's only 1/3 of left.I'm retired from yellow box cakes from now on. WAY TO GO DAVID!!! Thank you for sharing. :-)

This was the worst cake I have ever made. The inside tasted greasy and raw, like it wasn't cooked enough--while the edges were crisp. Texture was lumpy. Waste of ingredients.

I cannot have done this wrong twice!  But maybe...
I greased my pans with shortening and flour.  Oven was preheated.  Let cool for 15 mins before turning onto cooling racks.  Edges were overdone and crunchy, middle was so oily soft it stuck to pan.  Made two cakes...both disasterous.  I have a boxed cake in the oven right now.  That will teach me to try a new recipe when I NEED a cake for a 50th Surprise Party...

Warning- you will not be able to go back to yellow box cakes after this yellow scratch cake!! 

*** If you want moist and fluffy results, it is extremely important NOT to knock out all of the air that you have whipped in***If you add the eggs, flour, or milk all at once, it will knock most of the air out and you will end up with a dense cornbread type cake. 

For fool proof results cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, then add the eggs one at a time, then add the flour and milk separately a little bit at a time, 30 seconds apart from  one another while your still mixing on medium speed and you mixture will remain airy and fluffy. 

Towards the end of the baking time, you will also need to watch this cake like a hawk. It will go from undone and gooey to a clean toothpick in a matter of a minutes.

I'd also recommend making this cake one day ahead of when you plan to serve it. It tastes heavenly the next day.

Thanks David for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This cake is soooo good. It's everything I was searching for. Moist, fluffy texture. Perfectly sweet, buttery flavor. I will look no further. As for the extra whites...make a meringue for a pie...try a healthy omelet, but this recipe needs no alterations. Cream the sugar and butter well. Don't over mix once you start with that flour. If you develop too much gluten, your cake will be tough. I don't even wait until all the flour is fully incorporated to start adding milk. Start and end with dry. 3 dry, 2 wet, alternating fairly quickly. Don't overbake. Bake til it's done...different ovens and other factors like elevation will affect cooking time. Thanks for this recipe.

I was excited to make this cake because of the reviews...as I followed the recipe exactly I came up with a very thin cake.  The flavor is fantastic, but it is hard and thin.  It was probably an altitude thing but cannot say anything more uplifting than this :[

THE BEST CAKE RECIPE. I make one of a kind and beautiful cakes with this recipe all the time. I am a major cook and constantly get complimented on how good this cake is by my friend and family. This couldn't be more delicious. One thing that happens to me, and probably others is its EXTREMELY THICK. I don't really mind it. Im not going to try and change that or experiment with that because its perfect on its own. What I would recommend is don't put wax paper or anything on the bottom of the pan because every time I pour it it folds and makes an odd crease when baked. So just pam it up and you deff won't regret using this recipe.

I doubled this recipe to make a 1/2 sheet cake for my son's birthday. It's delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, making sure my ingredients were room temp, beating my butter and sugar very well until it was fluffy, slowly adding one egg at a time, and alternating the flour and milk a little at a time. I baked for 40 min w/ a heating core and it's perfect.  I will use this recipe again! (oh, and I made an egg white omelet for lunch in case you're wondering what to do with all that egg white)

Made this cake for the first time today for my husband's birthday.  Everyone loved it!  The only thing I did different at all was added three tablespoons of sour cream to make it a little more moist because of everything I had read in the other reviews.  I would like to try it as it is written sometime, but wanted to make sure it was moist for my husband's birthday. Will definitely be making this one again!

Rich, decadent, amazing! *remember to cream your sugar and butter VERY well to make it puff up and stay puffed* I dislike box cakes. I find them dry, bland mouthfuls of disappointment. THIS however is thick, moist, a little custard flavored and could be eaten without frosting! (I made custard and a thick chocolate glaze and made it into a boston cream pie)

I thought this was a great recipe! It's a cake so you  have to follow the instructions exactly! Add the eggs one at a time etc. And because of the air in the recipe, dont open your oven to check on the cake until  atleast 20 minutes have passed. I thought this cake was so delicious! I loved it.

I used this recipe as a base for a lemon cake.  I 1/2'd the recipe since I was experimenting and the cake turned out much better than what I expected.  Since I 1/2'd the recipe used 2 whole eggs and 2 egg yolks.  I should've used 3 egg yolks and 1 whole egg but none-the-less the cake was de-lish!!  To get the lemony flavor I wanted I added 1 tsp of pure lemon extract in addition to 1 pkg of unsweetened lemon kool-aid.  YES! I dais kool-aid.  It give it that BAM and such a powerful lemony taste.  I've been experimenting all week to get the perfect lemon cake and I think that this recipe used as a base is perfect!  Paired with a lemon cream cheese frosting.  Mmm mmmm! I agree with naples34102 (you folks should listen to her.  She makes sense and I have used her advise on a Key Lime Pie recipe from this site) people are so use to box cake mixes that they don't know what a "scratch" cake is suppose to taste like let alone what the texture is suppose to be like.  FYI.....egg yolks make the cake dense (heavy) while egg whites make them light and airy.  If you don't want a dense cake you will need to used use a few whole eggs in place of just egg yolks.  Thanks JD!

This cake is great!  If you want the texture to be right USE THE CAKE FLOUR and sift the flour salt and baking powder 3 TIMES to get ultimate texture.

This is by far the best cake I have ever made from scratch.  I followed the recipe exactly, modifying only by adding 1 tsp of pure almond extract (I think that added quite a lot to the overall flavor).  

I split it into 3 layers (8 in. pans) and it came out wonderfully.  One thing to note:  The cake will stick, luckily I lined the bottom of the cake pans with parchment paper cutouts before baking, so I didn't have a problem.

Also, I creamed the butter and sugar together for 5+ minutes at the start and followed the directions precisely about beating in the yolks one at a time.  When you get to the flour/milk stage, make sure not to overmix.  I think this was the key, the cake was fluffy and moist, with amazing flavor.

I made the microwave lemon curd (from this site) and put a layer of that and Special Buttercream Frosting (also from this site) in between each of the layers and frosted the outside with the buttercream.  It was delicious!

This was way too sweet for my taste, but my bf (the birthday boy) loved it. I whipped 4 egg whites separately and folded them in last (used the other 2 for frosting) and the cakes rose nicely. It is a very moist cake.

I made this cake the first time substituting the cake flour for the regular flour plus corn starch.  The ratio that I used was 3/4 c AP Flour + 2 Tbs corn starch to 1 c cake flour.  It came out wonderful and froze well.  I then followed the recipe to the letter using the cake flour and found the texture to be "odd".  I can't really explain it, just that it wasn't right.  I'm making it again this weekend for my nephews birthday party. I'll use the flour/cornstarch sub.  I'm in search for a fool proof delicious yellow cake.  I've been using so many different ones over the years.  This may be it, I just have to make it a few more times to make it tried and true.

I just acquired a Kitchen Aid for Christmas, with high hopes of improving my (novice) baking skills, and was excited about trying this recipe.  And oh my word, it was delicious and oh so easy!  I followed the advice of a reviewer and let the butter and sugar mix for ten full minutes, until it whipped and turned almost white (like dense whipped cream), and I'm glad I did, as the end result was a light, moist, and very tasty cake indeed.  I did modify it and used all-purpose flour, replacing two tablespoons of the flour with corn starch (I had read about this substitution online), as I didn't have cake flour, and it still had a wonderful texture (also, I baked for 35 minutes in a 13x9x2 inch pan, as I only have one round cake pan). I have very limited baking experience, if I can make such a wonderful cake, then anyone can!

My daughter made this for my birthday.  We now refer to this as "the best cake ever."  She probably did not sift and I know she did not use cake flour and it came out a little dense but that's how I like it.  DELICIOUS.  BEST CAKE EVER. Add some cream cheese frosting and prepare to be in cake heaven.

WOAH!!! I made this recipe for Chocolate CHip Cookie Dough Cupcakes from this website...the other recipe is bleh...but this yellow cake is YUMMM!  SUper moist and rich, light and flavorful.  THis is my new go-to recipe for yellow cake! I didnt want to buy cake flour so I researched online and found that for a substitute you can make your own: for every 1 CUP of all purpose flour:remove one tablespoon flour and replace it with 1 tablespoon of corn starch...sift 4-5 times.

Wow!  I've tried about 6 different recipes for cake on here and this one beats them all!  I too used 4 whole eggs and all-purpose flour but man, OH MAN was this WONDERFULLY MOIST and DELICIOUS!!! I felt guilty putting frosting on it, it was that good, but I had already whipped some up.  This is DEFINITELY my new staple!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

Followed recipe exactly and really enjoyed this cake.  It's dense and moist, but not too heavy.  Excellent flavor.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan and topped it with a nice fudge icing.  Very decadent.

I cut this in half and used 2 whole eggs instead of 4 egg yolks and added more vanilla. Next time I'll use 1 whole egg and 2 yolks and add even more vanilla, probably a full tbsp. Great texture! Thanks!!

Good basic recipe, I liked it. I might add a bit more vanilla or almond extract next time just to intensify the flavor, but the texture was perfect. I did make a point to use cake flour and to beat the butter mixture until it was really fluffy.  The cake came out moist and light.  If you're new at baking from scratch, sort the reviews by "most helpful"  - there's some good advice there.

I've made this recipe twice (layer cake and cupcakes) and it was an equal success both times. An easy recipe for a moist, flavorful cake that smells wonderful while baking. Just follow the directions as given. All-purpose flour will work fine, but cake flour will give a decidedly finer texture. For best results, as with any cake recipe, you'll want to be sure to the butter is room temp and that you cream the butter and sugar thoroughly for at least several minutes. After this, take care not to overbeat, especially when adding the flour and milk. Mine were done baking right at 25 minutes. It will be yellow and might APPEAR underdone, but if the cake starts to brown at all, that's too long. The instant it passes the tap-and-spring-back test, it's ready.

This cake was the fluffiest homemade cake I ever made. The texture was beautiful. It rose wonderfully. I just didn't think it was very flavorful. It could have used more vanilla extract. I will stick to my regular yellow cake recipe.

Ridiculously good. Simple & easy (use 2 c AP minus 2 tbsp + 2tbsp cornstarch if you have no cake flour) and CRAZY good. So buttery, I wouldn't dream of ruining this with frosting! Soft and moist, lovely crumb; in the Euro style at my house, it's served as is with coffee. Guaranteed to blow your hair back.

This cake gets 4 stars simply because everybody who tried my cake loved it. I paired it with a homemade caramel icing and my mom-in-law said "this cake is the ------- bomb! " which I was glad to hear. But in my opinion, it was a bit dry. oh well, if they like it, I love it :)

WOW!!!  I have been looking for a long time for a good "basic" homemade cake that is NOT heavy and dense and I've finally found it.  I did change two things based on personal cake baking experience/preference: I used half butter/half butter-flavored shortening, and I used 2 less eggs but whipped the all of the egg whites to peaks with a dash of cream of tartar, and then folded them in at the very end... LIGHT, perfect moist crumb, baked up evenly.  Popped it in the FREEZER for 15 mins to cool (TIP: this makes your cake super moist).  This time I did a nice dark chocolate cream cheese frosting, but from here on out I will forever use this recipe in place of a boxed cake mix for so many different kinds of cakes... total keeper!!!!

I seldom rate recipes so low, but this cake was not for us. I've made many yellow cakes, one in particular from this site which is wonderful, and never had any turn out like this one did. I'm not an novice baker, and I followed this recipe to the letter, creaming the butter several minutes, adding egg yolks one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. This turned out  dry, reminded me of cornbread. The flavor wasn't that great either. I frosted this with chocolate buttercream. One good thing I can say about this cake, it cuts beautifully, maybe because it's so very dry. I'm sorry I will not make this again.

Failure.  I am an experienced baker so I have to ask, how could a legitimate cake recipe go so wrong? After 30 minutes in a 350 oven the center had not even set up.  I used two 8" pans.  Got to admit it was delicious around the edge where it was done...

Excellent cake!  Very moist with a tender crumb even though I used all purpose flour and 4 whole eggs rather than 8 yolks.  My husband and I have been eating it unfrosted for breakfast the last couple of mornings and both of us have enjoyed it very much with our coffee.  I'm not sure what went wrong for some of the others unless they got in a hurry and didn't cream the butter and sugar properly or add the eggs individually and beat well after each.  Some folks don't understand how necessary that is.  (It's all about chemistry!)  Anyway, we love this cake!

Very moist like boxed cakes, but I love how this doesn't crumble like them. The only difference I made was using 4 whole eggs instead of 8 egg yoke because a.) I didn't want to waste the whites and b.) the whites have protein which give the cake more structure.  Frosted with Special Buttercream Frosting from this site. Bottom line- use this instead of boxed mixes, since it's practically as easy.

This cake was easy enough to make, but turned out very dry.  Initially, it tasted lovely, but after 1/2 a day, it was too dry to really enjoy.

DON"T DO IT!  I read the reviews warning this cake tastes of cornbread but went ahead anyway since there were so many other positive reviews.  The cake IS moist but that's the best part.  It definitely tastes like cornbread and is way too crumbly.  Might be good for eating at home but you could hardly decorate this and cut it up presentably.

Thank God for the internet, for it brought to me this awesome cake! I was skeptical, so I halved the recipe and decided to use 1 whole egg for each 2 yolks...I hate wasting ingredients on a bad recipe, but no worries with this one!  It was absolutely fabulous.  It has a sugar cookie flavor, great texture and moistness.  It was an instant hit with my kids and husband--I joined the website to just post this review, and to tell the world that I'm now officially converted from box cakes!  Thank you David!

One of the best yellow cakes I've ever had!  This is my second time making a cake from scratch and it couldn't have been easier.  I wouldn't recommend storing it in the refridgerator -will dry it out a bit. Also, I didn't find the need to alter the ingredients at all - was great as is.

I am a cake fanatic...like making different recipes until I've found the "perfect one" per style..this is the first yellow cake from scratch I've made and I'm not looking further...I've tried over 8 chocolate cakes, 10 pound cakes and still looking for those but this cake was WONDERFUL!!!  It is now officially my yellow birthday cake fave and I use a great chocolate frosting I found somewhere else for the perfect cake. It was moist and the easiest cake I've ever frosted...no nuisance crumbing coming off the cake...frosting just slid right over it.

Light and fluffy is what i got. Plus it was tasty! I just altered it a little. I didn't have cake flour so I used all purpose flour took two tbsps out and added two tbsps of corn starch (another way of making cake flour). Instead of egg yolks I used 4 whole large eggs and used low-fat buttermilk instead of milk. I made mini cupcakes and we're in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350°F. Hope that helps a few.

This is so good that I've erased several sentences to find the perfect beginning to my review... I really don't know how to start other than to say that this really is the cake that birthday dreams are made of.  I have been looking, experimenting, and researching for many years to find the perfect yellow cake, and it was this simple the whole time.  This is absolutely the best cake I've ever tasted (let alone made), and that's coming from a professional baker with a healthy obsession with cake.  I'm taking the time to write this review because I feel that the recipe deserves it, and other people doing their research (as I was) might benefit from it.

If you are having trouble with this recipe, just remember that EVERYTHING matters when it comes to baking.  No substitutions or shortcuts will get you the right result.  The butter and sugar should be beaten until the mixture looks almost white and fluffier than whipped icing (this takes at least 5 minutes on medium-high speed on a stand mixer; don't worry, your patience will pay off).  The flour must be sifted, and all-purpose flour will NOT work the same as cake flour.  If care is taken to follow all instructions exactly, this cake will not disappoint!

I have tried a variety of cakes and recently started learning techniques in patisserie, and while the French are not typically known for cakes - this cake could change their minds.  I made this cake with a chocolate ganache, then made a strawberry swiss meringue buttercream to seal the prized cake.  It was fabulous, light, airy, with a small crumb and delicate texture that was still able to stand up to a dark chocolate ganache.  Think of a Neapolitan that has been elevated.

I read a ton of reviews before making this.  Here’s what I did and it DID turn out to be the BEST dang cake. We devoured this with a basic chocolate butter cream frosting. I substituted the milk with 1 cup buttermilk and changed eggs to 4 yolks and 2 whole eggs.  I took a lot of time putting the cake together creaming and creaming and creaming the sugar and butter for a while. Then I added each egg yolk at a time and still beat and cream a lot in between each one. I whisked the flour mixture awhile instead of sifting it as my sifter is too small to allow the salt through.  I baked in two 8” rounds and found it only took about 20 minutes to cook. I was careful to check that early on after others talked about being dried out.  This cake was not dry. It was moist and tasted unlike any other yellow I’ve ever had.  Amazing Cake!

Follow the directions exactly, and this cake will turn out perfectly! We used a 9x13 pan and topped the batter  with fresh peach slices before baking. After the cake cooled, we served it with vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

This is only the second cake I've made from scratch and is turned out PERFECTLY! I took the advice below from another satisfied baker and added a little canola oil at the end (approx 1.5 Tbs), and the cake was moist and packed with delicious flavor. Well worth the cost of all those organic eggs. ;-) I paired it with a Swiss Meringue Buttercream icing (from Martha Stewart's site) and the compliments were fast a furious at the birthday party last night; my mother called it "the best cake she'd ever had." I will definitely make this one again. Thanks, David!

I finally tried this cake because I had exactly 8 leftover egg yolks in the freezer. I made it with half butter and half 80% vegetable oil margarine. It was very good. I planned to frost it with caramel frosting. After tasting a little piece I trimmed off for my hungry impatient toddler, I decided to leave it unfrosted. I don't recall ever saying nah I won't frost this one. This is a very rich, very moist cake. It's good as is. (If folks are having trouble with baking scratch cakes with recipes that seem to work for others...1.)Make sure all ingredients are room temp, including the milk. This is very important. 2.)Cream butter and sugar VERY well. I only have a hand mixer, so I know it works just fine for this. Be patient and cream well. 3.)Don't over mix after the flour and milk are added. Mix more than you would for muffins. Blend well but don't go crazy. 4.)Test your oven temperature on both sides. 5.)DON'T GIVE UP! After a half dozen scratch cakes, they'll start tasting really good. After making a dozen+ of them, they'll start tasting great.) Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is fabulous! The cake is so moist and tasty. I used it to make cupcakes and they came out perfect. I followed the directions exactly and had no problems whatsoever. I did use regular flour but it made no difference. I used a knife to test when they were done. Perfect!

Delicious and easy. Definitely recommend this one! I ended up using 4 whole eggs instead of just the yolks (didn't want to waste anything), came out perfect.

I've was looking for a great basic "scratch" recipe for birthdays cakes etc and this is it!  Have made so many cakes using this recipe in the past year (using 4 eggs instead of 8 yolks as per other reviewers) and they always turn out perfect.  Tastes great with buttercream frosting

Wow!  This was my first scratch cake, and man was it a winner!  Unbelievably light and fluffy!  I used 1 whole egg and 6 yolks (because I broke the first yolk), and otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  I used cake flour, sifted the dry ingredients, used an electric mixer to completely beat in 1 yolk at a time, and alternated adding milk and flour just like it says.  The result was a thick, beautiful batter--much thicker than box batter.  I was almost concerned about it, but it rose beautifully and turned an even, light golden brown on top.  Bake time was specific to my oven--you just have to watch it.  This cake was superior in every way.  Amazing texture, excellent taste.  I will never by a boxed yellow cake again!

I made this cake for our "March birthdays" family get-together after convincing my mom to let me bake the cake instead of her usual boxed mix.  This was SUPERB and got rave reviews, including several from those used to finer restaurants & bakeries!  Yes, it was not quite as moist as the pudding mixes, but it also tasted genuine w/o the fruit loop aftertaste.  If you can get free range eggs, it will be the most gorgeous golden color to compliment a delicious rich flavor and texture.  Follow the directions and David's Yellow Cake will become your go-to recipe!  Thanks David for sharing your treasure.

I thought that this was a GREAT recipe. I tweaked it a little bit to make it my own. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup vegetable oil and I just used 4 whole eggs instead of wasting egg whites. What was achieved was a super moist yummy yellow layer cake.

Interesting cake... 1) The batter is really, really think - like a very soft play-doh 2) the texture is nice/cuts nice/has a nice crumb to it/not grainy as others have mentioned 3) its not sweet.  It just doesn't taste like cake.  Even frosted, you feel like you've frosted a muffin or piece of sweetened corn bread.

Great recipe!  One word of advice though.  Follow the directions exactly!! If you are not happy with your cake, you either didn't follow the directions exactly or you overcooked your cake.  I did both the first time.  The cake was very good anyway but take the time to follow the directions and you will be much happier with the result.

Probably the absolute best yellow cake I've ever eaten.  If you don't overmix and if you carefully measure your flour (fluffing it before scooping) it comes out great and not dry at all.  I've used this in a two layer cake and for cupcakes and both were wonderful.  In fact, the cake was the star of the show, not the frosting - just the way it should be!  This really is a fabulous recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Perfect yellow cake.  The batter was just delicious.  I increased the vanilla and salt a bit to suit my personal tastes.  If you plan to frost this cake, make sure that you use a very light frosting.  The cake is very moist and will fall apart with a stiff frosting.

This cake was great. I did make two modifications based on other reviews: I used 4 whole eggs instead of the 8 yolks, and for each cup of flour (I was using all-purpose) I took out 1.5 Tbs of flour and substituted 1.5 Tbs of cornstarch. I also did sift the dry ingredients twice. The cake came out very fine-crumbed and dense without being too "heavy"--almost like a pound cake. I'll make this again.

Very Easy, Tastes Good.  I'm a novice at baking.  This was the 1st time I've ever made anything with just egg yolks - lol.  I halved the recipe but did everything else exactly and this cake is very very good.  I was surprised.  It has an excellent consistency/feel to it.  Its a light crumb, but not quite as light as angel cake (one reviewer said this and it doesn't taste that light to me). * If you are used to box cakes this cake may not be for you, but I still think you should try it and dump the box.  Box cakes are so artificial tasting.  I will be using this recipe for my birthday cake! lol  Really nice and really easy.  Thanks, David.

I followed directions to a T and it came out dense, bland, and dry. The 'batter' was like cookie dough. I've never seen such a thick cake 'batter' before. I put some much time and effort into this cake and it was totally NOT worth it. Very disappointed.

I have been searching for a moist, yellow cake recipe and have tried many that have unfortunately turned out dry, heavy or just not quite right.  This recipe is GREAT. I followed it to the "T" and it came out wonderfully light and moist with a very buttery taste. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you David. Definitely a keeper.

This is the BEST yellow cake recipe there is.My search ends here. I think it's so moist. It is not dry as others have stated. If you think it's too dry you're either not measuring the ingredients properly, not using the ingredients stated in the recipe, or you're overbaking the cake.
I was unsure about 8 eggs but it turned out great useing our home grown eggs it was so yellow!

This is the best yellow cake in the world. I made it for years with all purpose flour, substituting two TBSP per cup of flour with corn starch, and it turned out well. Recently, however, I made this recipe with cake flour, and it was so much lighter--absolutely PERFECT! I top this with the chocolate icing recipe on the back of the Hershey's unsweetened chocolate container, and it's delicious. It also makes good cupcakes; you just need to watch them and take them out before the cake starts to brown.

Used this recipe last week Saturday for a wedding, tasted great and there wasn't any wedding cake left at the end of the day. This was the third recipe I tried and loved it. I would definitely use this again.

Best yellow cake I have ever made from scratch.  I didn't have cake flour; I used the AP with cornstarch substitute and it seems to have worked very very well.  I sifted the dry ingredients 2x and made in one 9x13x2 pan and just watched for "doneness."  I am frosting with buttercream.  Will NOT use another yellow cake recipe unless it's proven to me beforehand it's better than this one.  Totally worth the effort.

Oh my goodness, I'm in heaven!!  I have recently been diagnosed with some food allergies and can't eat boxed cake mixes.  I was looking for a cake recipe that I can eat to make for my son's birthday party this weekend.  I halved the recipe to make a small practice cake, and all I can say is YUM!!  I didn't even wait for it to cool, it smelled so good! Deliciously moist and flavorful.  Even if I wasn't allergic to the ingredients in a boxed mix, I will never eat one again after trying this cake.  Thank you, David!!!

This recipe was surprisingly good! Better than another one I used on this site.  I made them into cupcakes and baked them for only 15 minutes.  They came out perfectly done.  Next time I will fill the paper liners only half way though instead of 2/3 because they overflowed out of the pan and ran into each other.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Make sure you use cake flour (ex:swans down, or sift your flour,  pay attention to the instructions)

Best yellow cake recipe ever!!  Very moist, I used it to make cupcakes and everyone went crazy over them.  I cant understand why some people say it is dry mine was soft moist and just the right amount of sweet.  A big hit for my daughter's birthday!!

I was VERY careful to follow the directions and adhere to proper baking procedures, but my cake still turned out on the dry side -- more a shortcake consistency than regular, moist cake. And the taste was more similar to pound cake than yellow cake. I  really don't know what I did wrong, so I don't know if I'll make this again. It was a lot of painstaking work for the result I got. We had to eat it with strawberries to cut the dryness.

I made this today for my MIL's birthday. I've never made yellow cake from scratch and this tasted wonderful. User error though, I overbeat the batter toward the end (unintentionally) and the finished product was somewhat dense. Definitely my error. DH and MIL loved the cake though! I will be making again and will watch my beaters more carefully ;) Thank you!

Ok, i made this about a year ago and I thought it was aweful. This week my mother in law wanted yellow cake and for lack of a better recipe, I used this one and it was fantastic. I don't normally screw up cakes, and I still don't know what I did wrong...great cake though

Warning:  If you are looking for a light and fluffy yellow cake like what you get in the box, then go to your grocery store and pick up prepackaged cake mix.  That being said, this cake is good.  It's definitely a heavier and denser cake than you might expect if you are used to box cake mix.  It is still very moist though.  I made everything as written with the exception of using all-purpose flour instead.  We sifted the all-purpose flour twice and then measured the 2 c. out after so it would be nice and fine and silky like cake flour.  I made my own frosting using the Vanilla - Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting recipe on here (highly recommended...I did the chocolate version) This cake is good, but I don't feel like it's outstanding.  If I wanted to make a yellow cake again, I would still probably experiment with some other recipes.  I agree with the people on here who commented that it has a slight sweet cornbread flavor to it.  The texture is nothing like cornbread, but it does have a subtle hint of that taste to it.  If you are looking for a good cake that you know will turn out, I would recommend this.  If you have time to test out some other recipes to compare and contrast which is best, I wouldn't hesitate to do that though either.

WOW!!! What an AMAZING recipe!!! This was the yummiest cake I have ever had! We ate it so fast that I didn't even get to put frosting on it! This cake is so light, fluffy, moist and is so flavorful. I don't see how people are having problems with this.... as long as you carefully follow directions and measure properly it comes out wonderful! I've made it both as cupcakes (bake for only 20 minutes) and a cake and it has come out delicious both ways! Have not made one change, this recipe is perfect as is!!! Thanks so much!

Great taste and SO easy to make.  You definitely have to follow directions though.  A tip for those worried about dry cake:  combine 2 cups of water and 1 cup sugar.  Bring to a boil for 3 minutes and then let cool.  Pierce your cooled cake layers with a fork and then use a spray bottle to distribute the sugar mixture.  *Note: DO NOT spray the layers too much or they will become soggy!  Just a few spritzes...you will have a lot of the sugar mixture left over.  This is a great way to add moisture to a dry cake without starting all over

Super yummy!  I followed the recipe as written.  If you don't want to throw out the egg whites, may I suggest these yummy recipes (from allrecipes.com) that call for egg whites:  1) Quick and Easy Peanut Butter Oatmeal and 2) Forgotten Cookies II.  Both are yummy and used ingredients that you probably already have on hand!

Excellent!!  I never made a cake from scratch.  It was super easy and SUPER good!  I didn't even ice it before tasting it.  I made cupcakes and only baked for 18 minutes.  The recipe only made 21 cupcakes.  I didn't have cake flour so I used 1 3/4 cup all purpose flour and 1/4 cup corn starch as found on a website for cake flour substitution.  I will never use a box mix again!

This is a absolutely fabulous cake. It is light, fluffy and moist. I used 1 cup CF and 1 cup AO flour because I ran out of CF. I also used 4 yolks and 2 whole eggs. I baked it in a 13" round and it took 20 minutes.

I would give this more stars if I could. I found it to be the perfect, light, fluffy and delicious yellow cake. I added 1/2 extra of everything, yielding 3 layers, rather than 2. I'm using 2 layers for a boston cream pie tomorrow, and the extra... well if it gets eaten before it gets put to another use, I'm ok with that too! I added a little extra vanilla, and followed everything else perfectly. I found the batter to be incredibly light and fluffy, obviously leading to a light and fluffy cake. This was amazing! Thank you so much!!

I made a 3-D dinosaur cake for my sons 5th birthday and it called for a cake made by scratch that was more dense than a box mix. This recipe was perfect and the taste was amazing. I highly reccomend this to anyone. Absolutely delicious.Thanks to David for this recipe.

I made the cake and it came out really good! This was my first time making a cake from scratch and it came out perfect. The batter was thicker than the box kind. I used a 13x9 instead and it worked great. I topped it with chocolate frosting and sprinkles. LOVE IT!

Just so you know, my original review is below (I gave it 5 stars). Must have been beginners luck. I have tried this recipe again FOUR times since this review and EACH time the cake came out absolutely awful (taste, texture...everything). I guess it was a one-time fluke. I really thought I had my yellow-recipe. I guess I was wrong. 



ORIGINAL REVIEW: All I can say is wow. I finally found my yellow cake recipe. This cake is amazing. Nothing comes close to this. For those who wrote negative things obviously did not follow instructions carefully. I took naples advice and sifted well, creamed sugar and butter well, beat in egss very well one at a time, and put the flour mixture in little by little while still beating (pouring milik in the middle and ending with flour again). I also used 4 whole eggs instead of egg yolks.

Yum!!! I used this recipe to make cupcakes for my daughter's 8th birthday. (only bake for 20 minutes if you are doing cupcakes) They were light, fluffy, and perfectly sweet.

This cake was a disappointment. It was dense, dry and crumbly. It was more like a Mexican yellow cake but not a good version. It fell apart after it cooled and I tried to transfer it to a platter. And the frosting wouldn't stick.

So I took out 2tbs out of each cup of flour and added 2tbs of cornstarch and it tuned out great.. This will be my birthday or any occasion cake.. Thank you David!!!

This was a great cake that I had no problems with whatsoever. It was not dry, and it froze great before I cut it into layers. It tasted wonderful in combination with a modified version of Special Buttercream. I didn't use all of the batter because I baked mine in two very small oval pans, only filled them barely half full. Do make sure to grease your pans very well, the cake will stick if you don't.

This is the best yellow cake recipe I've tried so far.  I made sure to really beat the sugar and butter well...for a few minutes.  I made cupcakes and while they tasted great, they weren't very attractive.  They had little holes all over the tops.  I don't know if they were air bubbles or what.  But, it didn't much matter since I frosted them.  I added some cinnamon to half of the batter and frosted with my own buttercream recipe and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top to make a snickerdoodle version.  They were so good!

I've made homemade cake many times but for some reason this one turned out quite eggy.  It needs more flour to even it out or maybe less eggs.  Not happy with the waste of ingredients.

Great flavor!  I used all-purpose flour, and it didn't seem to compromise the texture too much. A huge hit with the Birthday girl!

Only change I made to this cake was using All Purpose Flour instead of Cake Flour. However, I did sift the flour to try to make it fluffier. This cake did not rise, and tasted like sugar cookies. Agree with others that it had a cornbread texture -- grainy. Not a fan. Will not make again.

Tasted more like scrambled eggs than yellow cake, and the texture wasn't so great. Not really dry, just not flavorful like I was hoping. The only thing going for this cake is that the batter tastes good...that's about it.

SOOO good! Box cakes are full of preservatives and junk you can't pronouce.  Make a real cake from natural ingredients, it's so simple with a great recipe like this.   I used 4 whole eggs as another had suggested instead of 8 egg yolks and it was perfect.  DO NOT forget to beat that butter and sugar for several minutes at least until it turns that very pale yellow and becomes creamy and whipped.  I don't know exactly what it does to the batter but it keeps the cake moist and makes a real difference in the outcome.  I didn't frost it, just sprinkled powdered sugar on top and it was perfect for our (my daughters and me) little tea party!

I made this recipe into 24 cupcakes and it is AMAZING!  I baked at 350 for about 20 minutes for the cupcakes.  I didn't change the recipe at all and they baked perfectly; very level for decorating, moist, and spongy.  Definitely take the time to sift the dry ingredients together.  Also make sure to cream the butter and sugar very well, and add the eggs in slowly.  This recipe is a keeper!

I must say this is the best cake I ever made - and my first from scratch. It was moist and the best balance between sweet and not too sweet. Great Cake. I made it with the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site.

The cake tasted okay, but the texture left a lot to be desired. As other people have said, this cake was still pretty dry. Another reviewer suggested substituting oil for butter, which I later tried, and that did help make the cake more moist, but not significantly -- it came out less dry, but heavier and still very dense. I would not make this again.  I'll continue my search for the perfect yellow cake recipe.

Excellent recipe. Would like to modify by using regular flour, a little less on the sugar and maybe 3 instead of four eggs. Love the texure! real homemade. My husband prefers a moister texure like box cake recipes, but only for yellow cake.
The hubby and my Father-in-law enjoy yellow cake with a whipped cream frosting.
I love it just as it is!

I agree with the reviews by "naples34102" and "mork."  I have made David's Yellow Cake 4-5 times now and it is absolutely moist and deliciously buttery every single time.  It is nothing like cornbread as some reviewers have said, in my opinion.  I could eat it plain/as-is, but I usually serve it with a Swiss meringue buttercream.  Thank you JDSIMON for sharing your recipe.

I cut this recipe in half, filled the bottom of a cast iron skillet with butter, brown sugar and pineapple, poured the batter over and baked.  This is the best yellow cake I've made, by far.   I followed the directions exactly except for leaving out the tablespoon of flour when using all purpose.   It's perfect.  Thanks!

Thank you David!! This recipe most certainly is amazing. I did change a couple things though, not because I thought your recipe was lacking, but because I have a deep palette and love to over-indulge on flavor (lol):

- I replaced the milk with equal portions of buttermilk/half & half
- I used 1.5 Tbsp of vanilla (I'm a vanilla )
- I used unsalted butter (it seems to cream better with sugar for me), and added 1/4 tsp salt to the recipe, mixing it in with the flour (as the recipe calls for)
- I baked in a glass pyrex for probably 35-40 minutes

Not that your recipe called for this, but I did use my kitchen aid mixer.

The cake was DELICIOUS!!! Extremely moist, perfectly done, and made my entire house smell like twinkles!! I thank you tremendously for sharing this recipe with everyone, and completely concur - it's by FAR the best recipe I've tried. I cannot wait to use this as a base for my twinkie trifle, apple cinnamon swirl bundt cake, and blueberry cake! Thanks again, my friends and family will be thanking me because of you!

This cake was amazing both with and without frosting! It disappeared too quickly to get a picture of the inside! I made cream cheese frosting for the crumb coat, and mixed some with chopped fresh strawberries for the inside filling. Then made cream cheese buttercream frosting for the outside (so it would taste like cream cheese frosting, but still keep its form when piping). I made a strawberry glaze for the top with sliced strawberries. Was so good I'm making one for a friend for their holiday dinner, AND one for our holiday dinner! This is a recipe that will be written in my recipe book!

I took the advice and just used regular all purpose flour.  I made 24 regular sized cupcakes with this recipe, and they came out so good.  I can see why some people would say they are cornbread-esque.  But they are a big-crumbed yellow cake, very delicious-- but if you are looking for a fine crumb or something light and airy this isn't it.  This is a dense, moist yellow cake.  It's exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!

I beat the heck out of the sugar and butter and the same every time I added each of 5 whole eggs.  I even used 1cup of lite almond milk and baked it an even 30 minutes.  Wonderfully moist and delicious!  I topped it with this icing: box of instant pudding with 1/2 the milk and fold in 1/2 tub cool whip.  Yummy!

I'm a self proclaimed horrible baker. I somehow find a way to ruin everything I bake. It's a gift, I guess. So, when I decided to bake my first cake ever using this recipe, to be served at my daughter's 2nd birthday party, I expected a horrible disaster. What I got was the absolute best cake I've ever eaten and everyone at the party RAVED about the cake. Even my mother in law kept complimenting me on a job well done (you may have felt hell freezing over yesterday afternoon because of this, lol). The taste was amazing and the texture was perfect. This is it- my go to yellow cake recipe. The only change I made was to bake at 325 degrees but after 25 minutes when it still was looking very uncooked, I put the heat up to 350 and let it finish cooking. I put a thin layer of fresh, sliced strawberries between the cake layers with a thin layer of homemade buttercream icing that I found on this site, iced the whole cake, then put whole, fresh strawberries around the top of the cake. My favorite recipe from this site so far!

I tried several different recipes and this is by far the best! Followed directions directly and it was tasty and moist. I am even at 5400 feet altitude.

DOES DAVID HAVE OTHER RECIPE's??? LOL!  I've been baking professionally for years, this by far is my new recipe.  I double the recipe and make three fluffy tiers.  its perfect!  Its fluffy, moist and tasty. I use 1/2 tsp of vanilla nut extract, 2 tsp of butter eXtract and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  Sounds like a like but the combo of those flavors are signature and not overwhelming.  The butter extract adds a rich buttery flavor.  i make Swiss Merigne Buttercream with all the leftover egg whites.

This cake is AMAZING!  I didn't have cake flour so I substituted 2 Tb of the all purpose flour with corn starch.  Worked like a charm.

Great recipe! I creamed the butter and sugar thoroughly for several minutes and made sure everything was room temp. My batter was a bit thicker than I'm used to but the cake was incredible.

This is so very good. I have made this both with regular flour (when I lazily didn't feel like going to the store since I was out of cake flour) and then again with cake flour.  While both were good, the cake flour makes a big difference--it was was much more delicate and not as heavy.

I'm a reasonably good baker, but for some reason, I can't ever get cakes quite right - particularly white or yellow cakes.  But this was a rare success! It's moist and rich and tender and will be my 'go to' standard cake recipe from now on. Thanks very much for sharing the recipe!

I love baking, but I normally used a cake mix for yellow cakes.  Scratch yellow cakes seem to be so easy to dry out!  This cake however was absolutely wonderful!  I followed the directions for the cake exactly and filled it with a strawberry filling and frosted it with buttercream icing.  It was delicious - and everyone said it was the best yellow cake they ever had!  It does take longer than a cake mix, but it is well worth it.

One note - make sure to use room temperature ingredients, alternate mixing in liquid and dry ingredients and DON'T overmix.  Overmixing is one of the biggest culprits of a dry cake!

This was a great yellow cake.  I used 4 whole eggs instead of 8 yolks and it came out moist and fluffy.  I used it in a trifle and it was perfect.  A definite keeper for all yellow cake needs.

Deserves 10 stars! I thought I made the best yellow cake. That all changed when I found David's Yellow Cake. So moist. 
I made it for my birthday then went away for a few days having stored it unfrosted in a glass baking dish covered with plastic. I served it with only whipped cream and everyone thought it tasted like a Twinkie sans the chemicals and preservatives. YUMMY!

I think this is the first cake I've made from scratch that I've ever been proud of.  It comes out very dense and sweet (almost too sweet), similar to a pound cake but not quite as heavy.  As other reviewers noted, you need to really beat the sugar and butter mixture until VERY fluffy.  Also, be sure to use cake flour--all purpose will make it dry and course.   I needed a cake for strawberry shortcake so I tried this one.  I made a half batch and filled one 9 in. pan.  I topped it with sugared strawberries and whipped cream.  My husband and I couldn't stop eating it!

This cake was yummy and super moist. We made it for my dad's birthday and we over cooked it a little, but it was unnoticeable and the cake still stayed delicious. Instead of going through all the trouble of doing 8 egg yolks, I put in 4 whole eggs, and instead of the 2 cups cake flour, I did 2 cups regular, all-purpose flour, following another review here. I don't think it makes a difference. We made my grandma's old recipes for fudge frosting: YUM!!! I was looking for a real cake, not a boxed cake, since I HATE boxed cake mixes, and this recipe beats boxed cake any day! My dad started eating it the second he got home and so we took pictures of him with his half-eaten cake. Wish I could make it into cupcakes. I'll try that next time...

This was delicious. This is a simple and easy recipe. I read some reviews before this and use 4 whole eggs instead of eight. And like most people I also will say this is the best yellow cake recipe yet!

If your cake tasts like cornbread, its because your overmixing the mixture once the flour is added.  Just incorporate the flour, and you wont make the cake too glutenous!

First let me say I am not a baker!  That being said these turned out great!  I made them exactly as written and used others tips to make sure I beat the sugar and butter well, several minutes.  There is a tutorial video on these and it may help to watch it first if you are a novice baker.  I actually made cupcakes out of it and got roughly 20, I baked them at 350 for 18 minutes and then checked so I didn't overtake them.  I don't think I will ever use a box mix again because this just tastes so much better!!!!

Great recipe!  My oven isn't a convection oven, so I recommend the insulated sheets under your cakes to prevent over baking the underside.  This recipe made 24 cupakes - baked for 22 min at 350F.

I love this recipe.  I do use 4 yolks and 2 eggs instead of 8 yolks.  I also use sour cream instead of milk.  It comes out great. The sour cream adds some extra moisture and the whole eggs lighten it up a bit. I think the key to this recipe is to mix the ingredients correctly and for the right length of time.  DO mix the butter and sugar for a long time.  DON'T overmix in the dry ingredients.

I was hesitant because of some of the negative reviews, but this cake was totally scrumptious - moist and light textured.  I doubt if I will ever make a yellow cake from a mix again!  I made it as a birthday cake in a 13x9x2 pan with Caramel Frosting and everyone raved about it.  Like some other reviewers, I did not have a use for the leftover egg whites, so I used 4 eggs instead the 8 egg yolks.  I only had one cup of cake flour, so I used White Lily All Purpose for the rest.  I did beat the butter and sugar thoroughly and then beat each of the eggs in one at a time (they were cold from the fridge). Then I beat about 3 minutes once all the ingredients were in the mixing bowl.  I didn't sift the flour or do anything special.  So if mine came out as well as it did, I can't imagine how anyone has it come out like cornbread! I think if it comes out dry, it may be that womone is overcooking it.  I did bake at 325 instead of 350 as my oven runs a little hot, and took the cake out the second the center wasn't wiggly.  This will be my go-to yellow cake recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Well... This was yummy. Really yummy! However, my cake (cupcakes actually) came out flat. I did not have the exact ingredients on hand so I had to improvise. I will try this again because it was so good (and I will be sure to follow the recipe exactly!).

Apart from having to put the cake together without the birthday boy knowing what a mess it originally was, it's a tasty cake; moist and flavorful.  (It stuck to the pans.)

This recipe is fantastic. I also made this step by step and had a deliciously moist and fluffy cake.  if you aren't using cake flour, you are doing this cake a disservice and you will end up with a dry cake.  I modified this to my liking but the original is pretty much perfection.  My thanks to JDSIMON for taking the time to post the recipe!

I took naples34102 feedback help when making my cake.  I also took another members post to use AP flour in place of cake flour.  You take away 2 tablespoons of flour and replace it with cornstarch.  I baked the cake exactly as recipe called for and the cake turned out FANTASTIC!!!  This is the best yellow cake I have ever had.  Box cakes no more!!  This is a keeper!!  Thank you

Good, but a wee bit too dry for my taste, especially as they were being made as cupcakes.

This recipe is great!  It was my first time making yellow cake from scratch and I'm very happy with it.  I halved the recipe and followed the instructions exactly, then baked in an 8x8 glass baking dish.  25-30 minutes was still right, but check frequently at the end and remove as soon as a toothpick comes out clean.  I topped the cake with frosting made from the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa powder which went very well with it.

Amazing. I have never made yellow cake from scratch before. I made the complete recipe, no substitutions. The cake was perfectly moist, just the right density, fluffy, and delicious with my MIL frosting recipe...but I'm sure it would have been delicious with anything! Next time I'm going to try chocolate frosting.

The only thing I had a problem with is the baking. I had to trim it a little because the edges got a little too overdone, but that may have been my oven running a little hot as it is extremely fickle. Exactly 30 minutes. It still came out great!

If you follow the recipe you will come out with an amazing cake. No need to do anything special or extra. What a delicious cake and perfect recipe!

Good job OP!

Did as stated in recipe and correct time. Cake was not that moist at all.  Not sure why when reading all these raving reviews.  May try again with a little veg oil or sour cream but this definitely needs adjustments.

after trying many different vanilla / plain cake recipes i was generally dissatisfied. Recently i made a batch of Swiss meringue buttercream and had 11 egg yolks left over which i refuse to waste! I searched for a recipe using only yolks not whole eggs / whites. This recipe was beautiful soft moist with a soft fluffy texture.  The only thing i would say is that it is soft which i personally love and prob would not use this to do a tiered cake or one that needs to be covered in fondant (although this suits me fine as i hate fondant)  . One adjustment for anyone who would want a more firmer structure  is to use 6 or 7 yolks and one whole egg or play around with that!

I forgot to mention that i let my kitchenaid cream the butter and sugar for a good 6/7 minutes while i prepared the other ingredients and tins as this makes a world of difference to ANY cake! Also the previous review stated that the cooking time was too long...For me the cooking time was EXACTLY 25 mins and not a second longer or shorter so be sure to Know your ovens little quirks. Mine is a standard gas oven and to gas mark 4 (in the UK)

Well the batter tasted good, but the cooking time is WAY to long. I ended up burning it and didn't feel like trying it again, so I bought a box cake instead.

I tested half this recipe for a birthday cake next week. It tasted really good but definitely watch your cooking time! I baked it for 25 minutes and a toothpick came out wet. I put it in for another 3 minutes and it was dry. Next time I'll check it every 1 minute.

Fabulous, moist cake! I used oil instead of butter, orange juice instead of milk, and 2 whole eggs and 4 egg yolks instead of 8 yolks.  My only difficulty with the cake was the it produced a thick crumb and sometimes the crumbs got mixed in with the frosting. But it still made an birthday cake.

Excellent flavor and texture. Very moist. I did end up using 4 whole eggs instead as I wouldn't use up the whites and didn't want to waste them.  I also don't have cake flour but used the substitution found on Joy of Baking website and it worked great. Thanks so much for sharing. This is what I have been looking for. It will work great for my son's wedding cake coming up.

I have been looking for a yellow cake recipe that didn't turn out with a corn bread texture. This is the one. Fantastic. The only thing I did different was I added 7 egg yolks and one whole egg. I also really creamed the butter and sugar together (probably about 3-4 minutes). I made cupcakes with this recipe and baked them at 350 for 15 minutes.

Great recipe for layered cakes. I love to make extravagant cakes for my daughter's birthday & this has been my go-to recipe. It holds up well to stacking. Just make sure you are using Cake Flour (or substitute correctly), after making this recipe several times, I made that mistake & it was awful!!!

This cake is very light and springy, with a versatile flavor. As usual I cut back on some of the sugar that it called for; I actually made yellow cupcakes with a chocolate chip cookie center: I halved the recipe to make the cupcakes. Then I put a small ball of Pillsbury cookie dough in the center before baking. It's like a hidden cookie surprise when you bite in heheh. Also I was out of milk and using water in place of it worked well.

I doubled the recipe to make a cake and cupcakes--just ate one of the cupcakes, and even slightly overdone, it was moist and tender.  Loved it!  Since I used all purpose flour, I replaced 1/4c flour (per recipe) with 1/4c cornstarch to reduce the protein content in the flour.  I also used 4 whole eggs.  I've always thought yellow cakes were a pain in the neck because of all the yolks, but it worked just great with whole eggs, and tastes delicious!  This is my new go-to recipe.

This is a great yellow cake. I made only cupcakes with it, but they turn out amazing!  I made Mickey Mouse cupcakes with it for my son's 2nd birthday, and have used the recipe ever sense.  It is moist and super easy!  Thanks David for a really wonderful addition to my recipe box.

This is great! I'll be honest, I haven't actually had a full slice yet, but the little nibbles that stuck to the pan were yummy. My husband, who asked for this, will love it. I didn't alter the recipe at all, just followed as written. Thanks for a great recipe!

Call me a thief because I have now stolen this recipe!  I just wish I had it before I made a scratch yellow cake for my husband's job!!!!  The recipe I used came out super dry and crumbly.  How embarrassing!!!  I cut this recipe in half to make sure it would come out ok and I not waste a bunch of ingredients.  It came out looking moist even before I cut into it.  It sprung back to the touch.  Now the moment of truth!!!!!  IT TASTES GREAT!!!

I wanted to make a moist yellow cake and the reviews for this recipe couldn't be beat. I made it once, we (one of us a professional chef) loved it so much we made it again, and then again over the course of a few weeks. Which is to say, it's a memorably good cake. Follow the directions very carefully. Bake time is touchy. I tend to check it too early because I'm so afraid of it drying out, and as a result it sinks and is more dense. My mistake, not the recipe, but be careful.

Made this cake for a baby shower and received a lot of compliments. My husband got to try a piece the next day and asked me to make another cake for that night's football game.  Pairs wonderfully with the marshmallow fondant recipe.

My first time of making yellow cake from scratch. Seemed like the recipe had wayyyy too many eggs in it and I felt like it was such a waste to only use the yolks so I used 3 whole eggs and 2 egg whites. Still turned out great! Would make again for sure!

This turned out amazing! I did some mods however. I realized I had 6 eggs and 3 really ripe bananas. Enter the perfect marriage of eggs/bananas. I used the 3 really ripe bananas and 2 egg yolks in place of the 8 egg yolks (you can sub 1 banana for 1 egg in any recipe usually. I did this all the time when I avoided dairy, and good for those watching cholesterol). 

I just taste-tested the resulting cupcakes because of my sneaky 2 year old who swiped one from the counter before appointed birthday cupcake time for my 12yo. They are moist and amazing, and using the egg yolks with the bananas there is no dryness to fathom.  

Everything else I followed to original recipe. They taste like yellow cake meets banana bread, with not too much of either taking over. 

All ingredients used were organic (really makes a huge difference in quality, healthfulness,  and taste).

I read many of its reviews before attempting this recipe and I have never been more careful to follow a recipe exactly.  It had the texture of cream when it went into the pan, so it didn't really "spread".  I overcooked it.  I set the timer for 25 minutes and after 20 minutes, I tested with a toothpick fearing that I had overcooked it.  Relieved at the gooey yellow that clug to my toothpick, I proceeded to clean up the mess from my baking, when suddenly, my timer went off.  My cakes were dark carmel color and sure enough, my toothpick was clean clean clean!  I wish someone had warned me and I want to warn the next novice baker.  You can go from gooo to clean clean clean in 5 minutes, so check again after 2 1/2.  

Even though I overcooked it, by toothpick measures, the cake tasted yummy.  So very different from Betty Crocker.  It was eggy.  I think I would try to make it with less eggs next time.  Also, it did not release nicely from the pan.  I used my calphalan non stick pans.  I buttered them and floured them - I'm new to this, so I perhaps didn't do it correctly, but when I attempted to free the cake, the bottom part of the cake was left in the pan.  

It is the fluffiest cake I have ever experienced.

I've made this cake several times but only 1 layer (cut it down by half) and it's one of my favorites. Better than a yellow cake mix! Sometimes I top it with caramel frosting. Love it!!!!

This cake was the best I have ever made. dont overmix or cook too long and it should be the best yellow cake ever.  no need for any tricks for moistness. My husband said he loved it and thought it was perfect.

I signed up for this site just to review this cake recipe - that's how good it was.  I made it exactly as the recipe called, except for the cake flour - I used all purpose flour and sifted it about 4 times.  It came out FABULOUS - moist and flavorful, not too dense or eggy.  Perfect with a little whipped buttercream frosting.  I agree that if it comes out bad, you did something wrong while making it!

I have to admit I am a boxed cake user. That was until I moved to a small city in Spain and discovered that those practically don't exist here. So I tried this recipe and it was even better than my cake in a box. The only thing I did was use 4 whole eggs and regular flour. I dont have a large selection of grocery items at my fingertips so the butter I used wasn't very....buttery. So that extra butter flavor was the only thing I was missing. I think I may try a diifferent butter or even adding butter flavoring. All in all this was a great cake with great taste and texture, not dry at all!

Adapted this recipe for a banana split cupcake with smashing success - it took all kinds of abuse from me: cutting down to just 3 servings (which made 12 mini cupcakes for me), half whole wheat flour (pulsed in a blender to be more fine), almond extract instead of vanilla, half Stevia sweetener, 1/4 cup mashed banana added in, and me throwing in the eggs before the sugar in the butter creaming step! Tasted divine alone or with strawberry jam piped in the center and Oreo-marshmallow creme frosting, chocolate sprinkles and a cherry on top :)

Tried the recipe, didn't have cake flour (and didn't know to substitute, so used the recipe amount of all purpose flour), used 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs, and the cake turned out pretty darn good. Cake flour would have made it perfect. I think the box mixes give a false sense of what a real from scratch cake tastes like. This actually tasted like cakes I remember from my aunts and grandmothers. I don't need boxed yellow cake mix any more. Can't figure out why others ended up with such dry cake, because mine was great, and I even messed up the recipe.

I used this recipe to make cup cakes filled with lemon curd and topped with lemon butter cream and they were so delicious!
I didn't have any cake flour so I used 1 3/4 cups all purpose and 1/4 cup corn starch.

Okay I am a pretty experienced cook but this came out not to my liking.  It looked beautiful but the taste...it tasted like sand paper.  It was so dry and gritty.  Would not make again in fear that it will come out the same way

This was a very good cake. Everyone in my family said it tasted just like my great grandmas homemade cake, which was a compliment to me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is it wasn't dry, but it wasn't as moist as I would have liked.

I don't think I've EVER made a from scratch cake before, but when my Guy told me he wanted a yellow cake with chocolate frosting for his birthday, I couldn't think of any reason not to bake him one.  This recipe was VERY easy to follow and turned out BEAUTIFULLY!  The batter was a tad thick (almost like brownie batter) so I did add a couple of TBSP more of milk in at the end just so it would be more like cake batter.  Over all it turned out AMAZING and my Guy LOVED it and everyone commented how how moist and delecious it tasted and I will most definitely be making this recipe again!  Thank you for making such an easy recipe to follow!  Now I can't wait to bake another cake...from scratch!! =D

This is by far one of the best homemade cakes. I like the idea of fresh ingredients that I can pronounce. Follow the directions carefully and do not over cook. Keep the finished cake well covered as it does dry out fast. I make one every other week. So good.

I'm a beginning cook and this recipe was easy to follow (even though I had to look up how to get out egg yolks). I was really happy with how it turned out too. It was light, fluffy and delicious. This will probably always be my go to recipe when it comes to making yellow cake!

I have not been making cake's from scratch for that long, maybe a few month's. With that said, this cake was good. really good in fact. It had that butter-y taste that I was looking for and complimented my homemade chocolate butter cream nicely. the texture was light and airy like I like it. I did have to change one thing. I only had one stick of real butter on hand and had to compensate with a stick of margarine. I think if I had used all butter the cake would have come out even better then it did. that's why Im giving it 5 star's. It  just would not be right to give it any less. this is now my go to cake.

Yummy! I used 4 whole eggs b/c I didn't have enough to do 8 egg yolks and it still turned out delish! It didn't rise as much as a box cake might have, but had I taken the time to beat it longer it might have. I was in a rush. I will definitely be keeping this as my staple yellow cake recipe!

This is an awesome yellow cake recipe, and will be my go-to recipe for a basic cake batter. It's the best recipe for yellow cake I have ever found, and I have made a lot of different from-scratch cake using recipes from popular blogs, cookbooks and more. The egg yolks in this recipe add an incredible amount of moisture and flavor. I most often use it for cupcakes, and it works extremely well on that front. I get rave reviews from tasters every time I use this recipe. I don't change anything - I think it's great just the way it is.

This was too eggy for me.  It was pretty good, but I think the Four Egg Yellow cake on this site is easier to prepare and tastier.  Even so, this is a good cake which is why it got 3 stars instead of 1.

I was looking for the perfect yellow cake recipe and thought this would be it with all of the high ratings. The cake was both super sweet and spongy, pretty much like the boxed cake mixes at the store! I have found that most high rated cakes on here tend to have that consistency. I was hoping though it would be a denser, more buttery or less sweet, and overall a more versatile recipe that could hold the weight of fillings. Plus, the baking powder or amount causes it to rise a lot in the center and slightly over brown on the edges. I also found it to be quite greasy in taste and appearance. I am guessing from all the butter and egg yolks. If you are in a pinch and need something like a box cake mix, you might like this. However, if you are looking for something impressive this will not work. Also, do not attempt cupcakes as I did. The recipe is way to greasy and crumbly and will not work at all for that purpose.

My cousin wanted a yellow cake with chocolate icing for her birthday, so I went on a hunt for a moist yellow cake recipe.  Although I love this website, I was skeptical of this recipe because it didn’t have a full 5 stars, and because it seemed so simple.  There weren’t any tricks like superfine sugar, buttermilk, boxed pudding mix, vegetable oil, shortening, imitation butter flavoring, food coloring, etc.—just flour, sugar, milk, eggs, vanilla, salt, and leavening…  Anyway, the cake came out beautifully moist and fluffy.  If your version didn’t turn out right, you probably need to follow the steps precisely, and then add some patience to it.

VERY nice basic recipe. Followed it exactly, using one very large 10 inch pan. Plus living at over 6000 ft I needed to bake it a little longer. It was delicious, family raved, will use it regularly and try some variations.

I used 4 whole eggs, and substituted 1 3/4 C. Flour and 1/4 C. cornstarch for the cake flour. Turned out delicious! Filled with Lemon Cream and frosted with Buttercream Frosting, both from this site.

YUMMO!!! This cake last for 1 day!  It was sooo moist and delicious!  This is one of my favorite recipes and will keep using it for our birthdays and special occasions!  

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic.  I saw other reviews and decided to just stick with the original to see if anything needed to be changed but it did not.  Perfecto!

Best recipe ever. I use it all the time for a variety of cakes. I usually put in 1-2 less eggs so it's not eggy tasting. Cake flour is the key!!!!

This cake is wonderful- fluffy, light, and delicious!

Here's what I do- make sure all ingredients are ROOM TEMPERATURE- milk, butter, eggs, etc. When you cream the butter and sugar, let the mixer cream it for at LEAST 5-10 minutes on high. After you add the flour and milk, scrape down the sides of your bowl and mix again. Also, do NOT over-beat! Just mix until combined. 
I use this to make cupcakes, and it takes roughly 15-16 minutes at 350. 

Also, a trick for moist cakes is after you turn it out, spray it with a simple syrup- mix 1/2c water with 1/2c sugar, heat till boiling, turn off the heat. Let it cool, the pour into a spray bottle. Spray it on your cake and this will help retain moisture.

If you follow the recipe EXACTLY in terms of flour type, egg yolks, etc., this recipe is fantastic!

I love this cake, its simple and just delicious! It came out spongy, soft and light. I've made this recipe a few times, each time better tasting! It got a little sticky in my cake pan so i lined it with wax paper, and it came out just perfect! You could substitute the 8 egg yolks for 4 whole eggs, unless you want the proper Yellow Cake. Its what I did each time and it comes out great! I also put a little extra baking powder so i got 2 high cakes, about 8cm each. Usually too much baking powder hardens the cake, but 1/3 extra the amount wouldn't hurt. Also, for icing this cake you might want to crumb coat and refrigerate it first, because it can get a little crumby...and many thanks for sharing, wonderful recipe!

This is a good base recipe, I did make a bit of change in the sense I used 2 full eggs and 4 yolks and I used 1/4 cup of buttermilk instead of milk. I made them for a church sale and they were gone in 5 minutes! I used the fluffy white frosting from this site.

Very good cake.  I followed all directions to the letter.  This cake is very moist, light and delicious.  However, the next time I make it I will almost double the recipe since I would have liked to put more cake into my 2-9 inch pans.  The batter was almost stiff when I was done mixing it and I had to spread it in the pan to get it to even out.  I thought it would come out terribly, but I was pleasantly surprised!  I topped it with chocolate buttercream frosting (my wife likes chocolate) but this cake is very versatile and I will experiment with diffrent frostings down the road.  Thank you David for this great recipe!

I don't have cake flour, so I used All-purpose, adjusted accordingly (Betty Crocker has a conversion chart for those of us who are ingredient lacking).  Other than that, and the temperature at which I baked, I followed every direction exactly.  I cooked mine at 335 instead of 350 because I have dark pans.  They came out perfectly cooked, pretty on top, nice sides, although distinctly misshapen, in about 25 minutes for one, 28 for the other (so much for evenly spreading the batter).  I waited the proper cooling period, then tried to remove them from the pans.  They not only stuck, and broke, the remaining portion looks greasy, and uncooked.  I tasted it, and it tastes cooked, but now I have cake mess in my pans, and completely unfrostable/unpresentable cakes.  The taste is okay, not stellar, but fine.  I'm not a fancy baker/cook, but I certainly have not had a cake turn out this poorly  before.  Can't say I'll make this one again.

The people that gave the cake good reviews must have been lucky? My husband still is complaining a week later how awful the cake was. the only redeeming thing for this cake was the quick King Arthur buttercream frosting recipe. Awful would never ever try again.

Me and my bestest friend tried to make this cake. We followed every direction and it ended up tasting like cornbread. I will never make this cake ever again. We thought it was dry and adding cake frosting just made it worse. We ended up playing with it and it felt a lot like play-dough. I would not recommend this recipe. unless you want dry cornbread...

Amazing! I was very nervous because I like the texture of box mixes, just not the flavor.  This recipe definitely fulfilled my desires.  I only had 7 eggs so I used 6 yolks and 1 whole egg.  Amazing cupcakes! Thank you for this recipe.

I have made many yellow cakes though the years, but this one is the absolute best!  Fantastic!  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  Such a simple recipe, too.  I'm lactose intolerant, so subbed Earth Balance for the butter and coconut milk for the milk.  Also used 4 large eggs instead of 8 yolks.  I had a traditional yellow birthday cake with chocolate frosting just recently from a fancy local bakery and truth be told, no comparison to this cake.  From now on, it's David's Yellow Cake for all special occasions.  For those reviewers whose cakes came out dry or like cornbread, perhaps the measurement of ingredients was off, the batter was over mixed, oven was too hot, or cake baked too long.  This cake is light, fluffy, and so deliciously moist.  Doesn't even need frosting, it's THAT GOOD!  Thank you, David for a great recipe.  My family thanks you, too!

I have to agree with the previous review. I wish there were more than 5 stars!!   I do not have 50 years of baking under my belt and I was nervous about making a scratch butter cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and was careful to cream the butter and sugar well.  PERFECT results!  I used a buttercream icing.  It was a huge hit (even from my grandfather -- a tough critic!) and I can't wait to make it again!

Very good cake. It does come out as a dense cake so please keep that in mind. If you are looking for store bought tasting cake then you might want to just pick up a box of Betty Crocker instead. I have used yellow and pinapple upside down cake.. I do suggest using cake flour over all purpose but all purpose can be used..

Total agreement and Amen to Naples34102's comments on 8.7.08!  This cake was PERFECT!  I too have been cooking for about 50 years as well and this cake has it all....buttery flavor & dense crumb.... exactly what a good yellow cake should be. I too halved the recipe and frosted with Allrecipes peanut butter frosting. Very good, and a nice cake to adorn with various icings and a delicious vessel for fresh fruits as well.  Thanks David!

Overall this is a pretty good cake, a bit to "eggy" tasting though, so next time I will cut down to 6 egg yolks. It's very moist and delicious!

Delicious!  I used this recipe as my cake base for cake balls.  The cake was so good when I tested it that I didn't want to crumble it up for cake balls!  I did cook it in a 13x9 pan (couldn't find my second round one) and aside from a slight increase in the cooking time (34 minutes), the cake was still awesome!!

This cake was delicious! I made a pineapple upside down cake (9x13)with it and it came out moist and yummy! I highly recommend you follow the directions ... I did have to cook it an extra 12 mins but I also had the syrup factor from the pineapples. I also added a 1/4 of pineapple juice into my milk for extra flavor, it didn't affect the cake at all! I would definitely say this ... mix that butter and sugar REALLY well it makes such a difference!! I'm going to keep making this cake for a long time!!

This recipe is just what I have been looking for!  I have tried many yellow cake recipes, and this one came out far ahead of the rest.  I used whole eggs instead of yolks because I didn't have a use for the whites, and they don't freeze well by themselves.  The batter was so fluffy and light, I couldn't believe it!  The cake came out delicious, with a light and delicate crumb.  Perfect.  The tricks are sifting twice, creaming the butter for a long time (3-5 minutes), and mixing well after each egg or egg yolk.  It did take longer to bake than I had thought, but I had done a 1.5x recipe and was baking in a deeper pan (for shaping, I used it for a castle cake).  When it's lightly browned on top, and a toothpick in the center comes out clean, it's done.  I HIGHLY recommend an over thermometer - I have never had an oven that cooks at the exact temperature you set it too.

This cake was okay (for my taste).  It's definitely no where close to a boxed mix, which is good in my opinion.  It's not as sweet and I liked the texture.  But the 3 stars is because, for my family, the flavor just seems to lack something.  Maybe more vanilla?  I will try another recipe next time though.

For whatever reason, it seems I'm never totally satisfied with my homemade cakes....until now.  Hubby asked for yellow cake with chocolate frosting for his birthday, and this one turned out fabulous.  The only alteration I made was to use 3 whole eggs, and two yolks (call me a cheap skate).    Thanks for the recipe....will definitely be making this one again!

I was a little leary about trying this cake, but it turned out great!! It was also DE-licious, thanks to all the great tips from others.  I substituted 2 tbsps. of cornstarch for 2 tbsps. of flour for each cup of flour, sifted my dry ingredients twice, used cake flour, 2 tsps. of pure vanilla extract, made sure to cream the butter and sugar well and then creamed it well again with each egg yolk added, lined my cake pans with parchment paper, and tapped the pans on the counter to rid any air bubbles prior to cooking.  It was the perfect yellow cake recipe.  Thanks David!!

The texture was a little more cornbready than I expected.  Didn't taste like it though.  It was better than cake from a box.  But the texture was a little strange.

I made this cake with all-purpose flour and four eggs instead of eight yolks and it was still delicious. Frosted it with Creamy Chocolate Frosting and it was perfect- and next time I will try it with orange frosting. So easy and quick to make too- thanks for the recipe!

4 1/2 STARS!  The first time I made this, it turned out exceptional.  The second time - not so great.  I felt like I did all the same things.  Maybe my mixing bowl was too big, therefore causing me to over beat the flour.  Anyway, the second time it was crumbly and dry.  A definite waste of 8 organic egg yolks.  I didn't even bother taking it with us for Thanksgiving.  But since I know how wonderful it can be, I'll probably give it another go at Christmas.

WOW! The best yellow cake ever. It was so light and fluffy, just perfect! Just a note people, use the CAKE FLOUR, it makes a difference. And sift, and beat the heck out of your butter and sugar. Outstanding!

I followed this recipe as written, with the exception of the flour. I, too, used flour with a 2 TBS cornstarch substitution per cup. It was neither dry or "cornbready." It was FABULOUS and (broken record..) WAY better than boxed mix. I will ALWAYS make this instead of boxed now. Also, as said before, beat sugar and butter well and take care adding one yolk at a time to ensure even mixing! 5+ stars! :)

Ok, I now have the 2nd batch in the oven. I'm not sure what went wrong on the first. I took reviewers suggestions and sifted the flour/salt/baking soda mix, creamed sugar and butter very well. When I went to add yolks (one at a time of course) the mixture started getting very thick, not sure why. by the time I had alternated the flour/milk incorporated it was a very thick batter. Thick enough for me to spoon into 12 muffin cups (only baked half the batter at first) the muffins did not rise at all. remainder batter and 1st batch, in the trash.  With this second batch I followed other reviews suggestions and used 4 whole eggs, (whipped up whites separatly and folded in last), and upped baking soda to 3 t. and kept everything else the same. again the batter was too thick to pour into muffin tins, had to spoon in. 10 min into cooking, it looked like cupcakes were rising, however at 17 min, they had caved in and sunk in the middle. Again, not sure what I did wrong, given all the positive outcomes I'm sure its something and I'd love any pointers but for now I'll try a different recipe.

So good! All I did different was add a tablespoon of mayo to up the moisture. Next time, I may add a box of vanilla pudding mix. I was a bit concerned about the "eggy" flavor some mentioned, but I waited until it cooled a bit and tasted it - no egg flavor! Very good - I will be using this - so long, box mixes!

I started baking cakes as extra cash and was looking for a great yellow cake recipe and I have found it!!! This cake has gotten rave reviews. It is very important to follow the direction and NOT to change the recipe. It rises nice and is very moist. This is the recipse is AWESOME!!

I made this cake for my son's first birthday party.  It was delicious!  Very moist and great flavor.  Just what I wanted - I love yellow cake with a rich, chocolate icing.  I was concerned at first because the batter was very thick, and I had to cook it an extra 5 or 10 minutes, but it turned out great.  This one is going in the permanent file.

Absolutely delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream (I do this automatically anyway).  My kids and husband loved it.  We did this as a last-minute thing, pulled it out of the oven at 9:15 and by 9:45, half of it was gone!

I made the following alterations:  Instead of 8 egg yolks I used 4 yolks and 2 whole eggs, subbed regular flour for the cake flour, and subbed buttermilk for the milk.  This was a moist cake, not too sweet.  Very tasty with buttercream icing.  I made cupcakes-do not overfill.  Mine spread versus puffing up, still tasty just not as pretty.

FINALLY! A wonderful, from SCRATCH, yellow cake.  I bumped up the servings to 18 to fill my 11x15 sheet cake pan and it was the perfect amount of batter.  The cake came out moist and fluffy and tasted perfect.  For those of you who are having difficulty, make sure you are creaming your butter and sugar long enough (5-10 min) - this used to be my problem as a newbie baker with getting my cakes nice and fluffy.  Mine used to turn out looking like "cornbread".  Also use the right type of flour, all the ingredients in baking need to be correct.  Great cake!  Thanks so much - this is my go-to yellow cake now :-)

I love this cake! So delicious and moist. I made one minor change - I use 5 whole eggs instead of 8 egg yolks (I just didn't want to use up that many eggs) - and it tastes great! I love to eat it without frosting - my favorite is always the CAKE part of the cake.

I was searching for a from scratch yellow cake recipe and decided on this one cause it had the best reviews. People seemed to like it just how it was without having to tweak it to make it work. For this reason I thought it was pretty fool proof. Maybe it was something I did wrong but I was highly disappointed. I followed the directions to a T but my cake came out looking like it had been hit by a meteor. It was high on the sides and sunken in the center. Cooked evenly but totally misshapen. I've cooked many cakes before and have never had this problem. The flavor was not great and it was very dry. Once I researched the problems I had I discovered that mabye I was disappointed because I had just chose the wrong cake recipe. I was looking for a moist cake with a fine crumb and a sweet flavor. This cake had a large dry crumb and was somewhat similar to cornbread with a tough crust. I continued my search and found just what I was looking for in the Betty Crocker recipe for yellow cake.  I gave it 2 stars becuse the problems could have partially been my fault and it wasn't a horrible tasting cake, just wasn't exactly what I was looking for. If you want a large crumb cake that will stand up to a heavy frosting this may be what you're looking for. But if you want a soft, moist, fine crumb, fool proof cake go with the Betty Crocker recipe.

My daughter and I made this for her 7th birthday, and she decided to add an entire bage of baking M & M's.  We used Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting from this website, and it was perfect!  I was afraid the cake would have an eggy taste, but once it was fully cooled I didn't taste the egg at all, and the texture was great.  This is a keeper for our family.

Holy moly this cake is delicious.  I let all the ingredients come to room temp before I began and my results were lovely.  I made it into cupcakes and used an incredible peanut butter icing.  I ate one after they were done last night and I craved one all day today!  Well worth the effort!

I'm wondering if CHERYLPTW really knows how to bake.  It sounds like she seriously screwed up somewhere.  I've made this cake lots of times and it's always delicious.  Also, it does not taste like or have the texture of cornbread.  If it comes out like that then you're not making it right.

Just made this recipe fpr birthday cupcakes. The cupcakes are for my boyfriend's b-day tomorrow, so this was going to be a test batch...but they turned out so darn nice, (No tweeking at all) that I just decorated them and can't wait to serve them! It's a beautiful batch of cupcakes! I admit, I was a little scared by the 8 yolk requirement, but you can't argue with the sheer volume of god reviews, so I gambled. The texture was very very light and fluffy. One hour after cooling, they are very moist without being heavy. I wasn't just pleased at how light they are...I was shocked! I thought for sure they would be heavy..but NO! Hurrah! I was very careful to sift dry ingredients twice through and used "soft as silk" cake flour. I also creamed the butter and sugar for a LOOONG time...but then was careful to ONLY MIX IN FLOUR MIXTURE UNTIL INCORPORATED!!! I wonder if the technique is what stumps some new bakers? There was no trace of any corn bread texture or flavor, unlike what some reviewers have reported. The texture of my cupcakes is so light, it floats. That said, if you're an enthusiastic froster. this is a delicate cake, so be gentle. Rave!!!

I have been looking for a good recipe for a yellow cake for years!  This is it! I was beginning to think it was impossible to make a yellow cake from scratch that was better than a box cake.  Fortunately, I found this recipe.  Yellow cake was the only cake that I couldn't make from scratch, so I am very happy!

After discovering I had forgotten to buy a cake mix for my husband's birthday, I found this recipe and decided to try it based on the reviews it got.  We were not impressed, and I will not make it again.

I made it exactly according to the recipe, but I found it did not cook in the specified time.  The cake seemed to be very dense.  It didn't taste bad but it wasn't worth all the trouble either.

This is a great cake! Made it for my daughters b-day and used Rich Chocolate Frosting from this website. Had many compliments. I was apprehensive at first because the recipe calls for 8 egg yolks, but it really was quite good and stayed moist even after 2 days. Will definitely make again. Thanks! p.s. Try the frosting -- it was out of this world!

It did have a moist but corn bread like texture and taste. It didn't get done all the way inside before the outside was rock hard. My husband did not like it at all. Only 1 person out of the 10 at my daughters birthday party told me it was good. I think it had an ok flavor since my icing tasted pretty good, but not the texture ppl expect from a cake. So will not make again! I did post a picture of it. Make sure you try this before you have ppl eat it. Not sure how it got such rave reviews

This cake was deelish! I wanted a cake that had a fresh taste, but was as easy to make as "box" cake. My family could not believe I made it from scratch, since this was my first attempt! I used 4 eggs, added vanilla pudding mix as suggested and used cake flour. I am going to add a few egg yolks... Worth a try!

I made this cake for my boyfriend's mother's birthday.  The color was perfect, but I was a little embarrassed because the cake was so dense and dry, he had to drink an entire quart of milk to get down one slice.  I will take the advice of COOKFORMANY and try again and hope it is more palatable.

I wonder if the last reviewer actually followed the recipe because I've made this cake several times and it always comes out perfect.  Apparently a lot of other people think so too. The overwhelming majority rated it 5 stars.  From the way the author of the review describes it it sounds like she may have had her oven set on broil rather than bake.  My cakes have never come out crunchy.

This is a wonderful and delicious cake. It was so moist and super easy to make. It goes great with butter cream frosting as well. I took the suggestion of margarine to make it more moist and it still taste wonderful. I also used all purpose flour and it still turned out delicious. With a cake this easy and great I will definitly be making it again.

I don't see how this cake could possibly get anything but a five star rating. It is moist and so wonderfully delicious!!! I have made this cake at least 6 times. I freeze the layers and cut them so I can have 3 fillings and four layers of cake. We love chocolate frosting but yesterday I made a 7-minute white fluffy frosting and it was a bit hit!
Thank you so much for sharing this "keeper" recipe!!
This cake is especially delicious filled with chocolate buttercream and frosted with chocolate fudge  frosting. Still my only  go to yellow cake recipe! Original post 9/2005

This is a heavenly cake!  It's light, yet moist.  My family and I have, recently, decided to take trans fats from our diet; which means no more cake mix!  I was scared to make a cake from scratch, but this one "takes the cake."  LOL!  I highly recommend using cake flour, though.

I made this recipe as cupcakes and it was absolutely fantastic!  Be sure, however, to only fill your muffin cups halfway - I apparently overfilled mine and they kind of "exploded".  Not to worry - all the extra pieces gave me a great opportunity to "preview" how great the cakes were going to taste!!

Fantastic, rich, moist cake. Added a bit more vanilla extract.  Wilton Cake Release (available at WalMart) is my safeguard against cakes that may stick.  No need to use wax paper...just rub is on the pan with a napkin.

This is a very good recipe, though it is very greasy.  Made it a second time and reduced butter to 3/4 cup and it was excellent.

I thought this cake tasted too much like cornbread. It was also too expensive to make (8 egg yolks!!) considering the kind in a box tastes much better.

I needed to make a cake for my sister's bridal shower and could not find a recipe that I thought was suitable for the occasion.  Then I checked my AllRecipes bookmark and found David's Yellow Cake recipe.  I followed some of the advice I read in the reviews like using a little less flower.  I made the cake and added strawberry filling in the middle and used a buttercream icing.  It was a hit at the shower.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I still have the recipe taped up in my kitchen for my son's birthday.  Way to go, Dave!!  Someone was right, Betty Crocker doesn't have anything on this. Wish me luck on the next one.

My Nanny used to make a yellow cake with chocolate fudge icing and it was amazing.  She used the old fashioned "2 egg cake" recipe.  When I Googled it, I ran across this recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand for this one, so I decided to try it.  OMGoodness it's wonderful!  It's really moist and doesn't dry out.  Paired with the chocolate fudge icing, perfection!  I halved the recipe and made one small cake in an 8x8 glass pan.  Just right for  a little mid-week dessert!  Will definitely make again.  And again!

This is delicious.  I don’t know how anyone could give this recipe a poor review unless perhaps they missed a step.  Its really important to aerate the flour before mixing it with the other ingredients.  This recipe asks you to sift the flour in order to accomplish this.  If you skip this step and your cake doesn’t feel fluffy- well thats why.  Its also always a good idea to check your oven temperature. I also try to check the cake 3-5 minutes before the recommended cooking time just because I do think my oven tends to run a little warmer, this helps me prevent the cake from becoming dry from over baking.

I made it exactly as written.  I thought it was good! It needs to be known that box mixes for yellow or white cake will always be different. It just goes down to the science of using real ingredients. I brushed the cake with a simple syrup while it was warm to prevent dryness (just in case due to the reviews). The cake was a little dense but not abnormally for a scratch yellow/white cake.. I thought the flavor was great and I would make it again! I just think you need to expect it to be different than a box mix. Its crucial that you familiarize yourself with correct butter creaming techniques and follow the instructions well. I also folded in the ingredients by hand after beating in the eggs per my preference. Overmixing after the eggs are added can ruin a cake.

I made the recipe exactly as-is. I was careful to whisk the dry ingredients together well, and to cream the butter and sugar thoroughly, before adding the yolks slowly, one by one. I weighed the batter so I would have even layers. Since my oven seems to run a little cold, I had to bake for 28 minutes at 350 and then another 5 minutes on convection at 350. The cake was a pleasing color with a good crumb, and not to sweet. I filled and frosted it with a cocoa ermine frosting that was just right... again not too sweet, and super smooth. This combination made the best traditional "birthday cake" I've made yet. I topped it with non pareils, cut piroulines in half and stacked them around the edges.

This is a great cake.  It is a bit more dense than store bought pre mix, but holds up very will to chocolate glaze.  The author provided the recipe, he did not explain proper preparation procedures.  That is not his fault.  Cream the butter and sugar correctly.  The egg yolks should be a room temp prior to inclusion. The second time I made the recipe I lowered the oven temp to 335 degrees and tested the center every 5 minutes after 30 minutes of bake time.  This eliminated the concave top. As an additional note, baking powder has a limited shelf life.  Make sure the powder you are using is fresh or the cake may not expand as expected.

AMAZING! I made an account just to write a review of this cake. I read previous reviews and substituted the cake flour for  1 3/4c AP flour + 1/4c corn starch. I also took one tablespoon out of my cup of milk and replaced it with 1T of vinegar to make buttermilk. I sifted all my dry ingredients twice. Be sure to thoroughly mix your wet ingredients. Beat the yolks in one at a time, mixing for 30 seconds after each egg. Be sure to scrape down the sides after every addition. Alternate adding the milk and flour a little at a time, again, beating for 30 seconds and scraping down the sides after each addition. Be sure to start and end with adding the milk. All the beating whips a lot of air into the mix making the cake super light and fluffy. It was not dense or eggy like others complained. Take the time to do each step right and you will have an amazing cake! Save your egg whites for a Swiss Meringue buttercream frosting!

To those who did not like this recipe, cake baking is a science.  If you don't understand the science behind it, your cakes will not consistently turn out well.  Here are a few tips to getting a quality cake:

1. Make sure you preheat your oven.  If you put your cake into a cold oven, the baking powder will not have the opportunity to work properly.
2. Make sure all of your cold ingredients are at room temperature and make sure your butter is not too soft/hard.  You should be able to press your finger into the butter and have it leave an indent.
3. Sifting your dry ingredients together helps to add air into the flour and incorporate them.  I usually do this step twice.  Also, be careful if your sifter has a fine mesh.  The salt may not go through the mesh.  In that case, add the salt at the end and gently stir it into the other dry ingredients.  Also, when you measure your flour, do NOT scoop it out of the bin with your measuring cup, stir the flour in the bin and then spoon it into your measuring cup. Level the cup off without mashing down on the flour.  If you scoop, you WILL use too much flour and your cake will be dry.
4. Let's face it, if you do not have a stand mixer, your arm will get VERY tired if you cream your butter and sugar together to the proper consistency, but it can be done.  In my stand mixer, on medium-high speed, this step takes nearly 7-8 minutes to reach the proper consistency.  When properly creamed, the butter mixture will be almost white.  I suspect t

I made this recipe and I was really shocked at how well this cake turned out, given some of the negative reviews that I read. This cake is moist and very professional looking. I used 4 whole eggs instead of all of those yolks. I also increased the sugar to 1 3/4 cups, because of some reviewers saying that it tasted like cornbread. Those were the only 2 modifications I made and boy it was worth it. I frosted this cake with the grocery store buttercream frosting from this site, thanks a million for this recipe David! I will definitely be keeping this in the rotation.

Excellent recipe,but I am a baker, so here's my alterations.
Sorry David, but I'm not about to waste the egg whites , so I used 5 whole eggs.  ALWAYS,ALWAYS use room temperature eggs and butter  when making cake recipes.  Everything else was spot on.... EXCEPT>>>>>>>>>> If you want a lighter, fluffier cake, add a tablespoon and a half of dry powdered milk to the dry ingredients.    When baking, it  creates and releases air into the batter , making it lighter, fluffier.
I always prefer a triple layer to a double layer cake, so you can either add 1/3 more ingredients for the third layer, or just use the batter and distribute into 3 separate  cake pans, your choice. Use less baking time if you don't add extra ingredients for a triple layer.
If you've made the cake before, and felt it was a little dry, you can add 1/3 cup of vegetable oil to the mix before baking.

Fantastic! Light, airy and moist. I will be using this recipe as my go to yellow cake recipe. The only thing different that I did was to add 1/4 cup more milk and used AP flour as I did not have cake flour.

This was amazing. I looked at other reviews and made sure to sift the dry ingredients twice. Didn't alter anything. These are so awesome as cupcakes they don't need frosting! My cupcakes were filled pretty full so took almost 20 min to bake. Saved this and may use for my wedding!

THIS. WAS. PERFECTION. If anybody says it was dry they did not bake it right or mix it right. So Moist. So perfect. I need not ever try another way of making yellow cake. The only thing I did differently was use buttermilk instead of milk and use 6 egg yolks (or one more...I lost count I believe) and then beat eggs whites to soft peaks and folded them in at the end. Will make again very soon. It was simple too. Can't beat that! Made with Creamy Chocolate Frosting from this site, which is the perfect pairing. This is my teenage son and his friends favorite cake and most requested. I got experimental this last time and used chocolate ganache in the middle and poured over the top of the chocolate frosting. My daughter says this ruined the cake. I liked it, but I believe I prefer the simplicity of yellow cake with a simple creamy chocolate frosting. I'll leave chocolate ganache for another cake. Yellow cake is meant to be simple and I will leave it that way moving forward.

The first time it did not raise up in the middle and was very flat, concave. I tried it again this weekend for my daughters birthday and it was like greasy corn bread. I had to crumble it into cake balls.  I ended up baking a yellow cake from just a pinch website that turned out fabulously!  Still don't know why this one doesn't work for me but I won't try it again!

Following a couple of other reviews I changed a few  things. 1) 4 egg yolks and 2 eggs. 2) all purpose flour exchanging 2 tbs per cup for corn starch. 3) sift two times. It came out lovely. I used 9 in pans and cooked for about 20 mins. As it says, Add eggs one at a time starting with yolk only eggs. Good tip from net- put 2 tbs of cornstarch in cup then fill with flour and level. First successful scratch cake tho other try was 20 yrs ago :) thanks for recipe!

This was an excellent recipe. With the exception of using buttermilk instead of sweet milk, I followed the recipe exactly as written, and followed the notes about creaming the butter and sugar very well and incorporating the egg yolks one at a time. The cake was outstanding, soft and sweet and spongy, and it made a great birthday cake. I would definitely make it again. Incidentally, next time I would try a lighter, sweeter buttercream icing than the one I made this time (thick and chocolately and semisweet). Great frosting but too overpowering for this delicious cake. Tasty on its own!

This cake turned out great!  I've tried some other recipes for scratch yellow cake lately and they were not so good.  I was worried that this would be the same, so decided to try a half recipe for a tester.  I followed directions precisely, creamed the butter and sugar well, one at a time with the eggs, used a light hand when mixing in the flour and milk, then baked in a nine inch round.  The cake came out light, fluffy and moist, just perfect in my opinion.  The real test was when my husband, who loves boxed yellow cakes, tried it.  When he said it was good enough to replace that familiar box, I knew I had a winner on my hands.  Thanks for a great recipe David!

Amazing!! Anyone who says this is dry is either lying or didn't follow the instructions!! Only modification I made was used 4 yolks + 2 whole eggs since I only had 6 left. Literally the best, most moist cupcake I've ever had in my life & easy to make!! Only cake recipe I will ever use from now on. As suggested I filled cupcakes a little over half full and baked for about 20 minutes. Paired with rich chocolate icing- to die for!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

I made this cake for my mother's 66th birthday. I didn't want to have to eat an egg white omelette the next day or make an angel cake, so I subbed four whole eggs for the 8 yolks. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. It was truly delicious. Fluffy and moist and everyone commented that is seemed very light. I filled the cake with a compote I made with  fresh peaches I cooked with sugar and a pinch of salt and cinnamon. And I iced it with a whipped cream frosting that was 1/3 mascarpone cheese (8 oz mascarpone, 16 oz cream, 6 tablespoons of sugar and vanilla). It was one of the best cakes I've ever made. My 70-something uncle had three slices, and he is not typically a dessert person. Made mom's day, and mine too!

I have made this cake several times. My first few attempts were highly successful. I use this as the cake for my Peach Upside down  Cake.  I have unsuccessfully made this cake 3 times....And, in hindsight it was all my own fault.  over mixing can ruin this cake and it wont rise. it states clearly until just combined.....so you have to turn the mixer off and stir it. using anything but cake flower will make it too dense. not sifting your flower or creaming your butter and sugar properly will make it have the "corn bread" consistency. And, Trying to make this cake quickly will ruin it as well.  You have to take your time. You have to follow the steps on this one exactly. If you think your butter and sugar is creamed? Cream it some more. make sure each egg is  competently beaten into the batter before adding the next. It is a great cake. But, there is no wiggle room. you have to follow the directions exactly.

I make this regularly but as cupcakes. The recipe will make about 24 cupcakes when filled 2/3. I usually make it with six yolks and one whole egg though. That makes the cake a little less dense and we enjoy it that way.  I have used regular flour instead of cake flour, but it's much better with cake flour . Sometimes I change up the vanilla extract and try almond, orange, or lemon combinations. The cupcakes freeze perfectly in freezer bags. I know it sounds like I change everything, but I love to experiment and this has become our go to cupcake recipe for every family birthday, shower, etc. Everyone loves it!

Wonderful cake! Just the way a homemade cake should be. I have made it twice now, using the AP flour & corn starch substitution, and using 4 whole eggs instead of 8 yellows. My son and his friends loved it! I make a lemonade buttercream icing with it, and it is a luscious combo.

I've made this recipe many times and followed it explicitly. I've always had trouble with the baking time, but it turns out well, still moist and fluffy. This time, I lacked milk and good baking powder, so I improvised with the help of Google searches and experimentation to ensure that the resulting combination reacted well and tasted fine. Instead of 3/4 quarter cup milk, I used about 2/3 plain 3% yogurt, which tasted light and sour. And I used 1/2 tsp fresh baking soda. These were added separately. For the first 30 minutes i placed it on a higher rack, then moved the cake one rack lower. I baked for a total of  45 minutes. It browned nicely all over, and the top is fluffy and golden. The middle did poof up, then it sunk a little. Tasted even better and was more most with the yogurt than with milk! 

For icing,i cooked 1/2 cup of the yogurt and 1 cup granulated white sugar until smooth and a little bit more viscous. I added more sugar because it was not sweet enough. You could still taste the sourness AI've made this recipe many times and followed it explicitly. I've always had trouble with the baking time, but it turns out well, still moist and fluffy.

It tasted more like corn bread to me.  It was a bit dense and not as fluffy as I'd like but I blame that on using all purpose flour and not cake flour (although I did sift the flour about 5 times)

Never fails. Have made this recipe many times and it's always delicious. If you like boxed cakes - you will probably not like this. It's different (IMO much better)but if you have only made boxed cakes this will be really different. I always have my eggs and butter room temp before baking this. Have made it as a sheet cake, as a double layer, and as a triple layer cake (just adjusting the times). If I make it as a layer cake I make a simple chocolate truffle filling for in between layers then a chocolate ganache for the outside but it's delicious as is without any frosting or filling. My daughter likes orange in her cakes so I mix in a bit of orange zest if I'm making it for her. I have also made it with 3 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs (when I didn't have enough eggs) and that worked out ok too. I prefer the original recipe but sometimes have to improvise. The recipe is solid and reliable as is :) Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful cake. Made it twice last week. First one was a "test" second one was for a birthday. Followed the reviews and used just 4 eggs on the first one and it was fine. Frosted with a no bake marshmallow frosting that was perfect for this cake. Had extra egg yolks from the frostings that I saved for the second cake. On the second cake I used 3 eggs and the 2 yolks that I had saved. It was a bit richer but still a great cake. I put a raspberry filling in both cakes. After frosting I used a zester to grate some dark chocolate on top. This was all super simple and looked great. BEST YELLOW CAKE recipe I have made. It will be on the top of my list from now on.

Update: For an amazing spring cake fill with a layer of custard and raspberry filling. Frost with thick heavy whip cream sweetened and top cake with generous amounts of "FRESH" sliced strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. 
I have also added lemon curd instead of custard and fresh lemon rind and poppy seeds to cake batter.
This is an amazing cake as originally posted and can be added to as mentioned above.

I made this cake 3x now in the past three weeks,  it taste just like the one my mom used to make it was devoured in  days. This is cake number 4. Just great thanks for the recipe. I can say that I'm not a baker and I messed up two cakes before this one I decided to hand mix and the results were great

This recipe is very good - but I have to admit I changed it a bit. Instead of milk I added buttermilk and I also added a little extra (half a cup) of sugar) because I also added about a half of cup of flour. I used cake flour and I used 4 eggs instead of 8 yolks.

The most significant thing I did was add 3/4  of a cup of "boiling water" as the LAST ingredient. The batter looks a little thin but it makes a very moist cake. I have a 70 year old chocolate cake recipe that is similar and the best ever chocolate cake.

Undoubtedly THE best yellow cake I've ever had, a sentiment shared by each member of my family, INCLUDING my impossible to please mother in law. Easy to make, surprising light, velvet smooth. The cake flour makes all the difference, don't cut that corner. I used the sour cream frosting recipe from this site, added mini chocolate chips between the layers and on top. SOOOOOO GOOD!!!

Definitely the best yellow cake recipe I have ever tried. I made this for my son's birthday and everyone commented on how good it was. I would say its important to follow standard cake making steps like adding the yolks one at a time and making sure that the butter and sugar are creamed well. I was worried when I read the review that compared it to cornbread, but there is no resemblance between the two. Thanks for contributing this!

This recipe bakes into a fine-textured, light, moist yellow cake.  I served it with a generous dollop of Greek Gods honey yogurt.  No need to frost!  Delicious!!  I will make this again using Egg Beaters and vegan margarine to see if a healthier version can compare favorably.

I just made this recipe and here's MY opinion of it. First off it made one 9.5" and three 6" round cakes. I used butter instead of shortening (as there's a version of this same recipe that calls for butter in lieu of shortening) and I followed everything else to a T! I do like the recipe as my cakes came out fluffy and moist! The one thing that I find is, the cake   could be a little sweeter. I am a cake baker/decorator for many years now and I think I'm going to start using this recipe (+ an additional 1/2c sugar) as  the base for my cakes.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it baked up very moist, tender, and sweet. I usually do not enjoy yellow cake, because it is so often dry, but this was very tender and delicious.

One of the other posters was correct - this cake does have an eggy, almost custard-like taste while it's warm, but that egg taste does dissipate once it's cooled. I was a bit concerned when I tasted the toothpick I had used to test the center. It tasted like a custard to me. But I had read that the egg flavor goes away, and so it did. You do not need to adjust the amount of egg yolks, because that is what gives it that yellow color and tender crumb. Don't over bake it, let it cool completely, and that custard flavor will mellow.

It is important to periodically test with a toothpick; the spring test is not reliable. There should be moist crumbs clinging to the toothpick. If it comes out wet, give it a few more minutes and test again. If it comes out perfectly clean, it is overdone and will be dry. If there are still moist crumbs clinging, it's perfect. 

One more thing is that I would recommend adding a circle of parchment paper, greased and floured, to the bottom of the pan to encourage quick release. It is VERY important to grease and flour the pan, and a good idea to add that parchment circle, as the cake is so tender that it will fall apart if it sticks.

It came out really dense and did taste like cornbread in a weird way. It didn't taste like yellow cake I am just guessing but I think its because of the amount of eggs in it.

I'm not sure why people had moisture/textural issues :/
I made the cake for a birthday dinner and it came out super moist and flavorful. Not too sweet. Nice and light. Hands down my go-to yellow cake recipe now (so glad I don't have to use a box anymore)! Will DEF be making this again!!

Great Recipe! I've been looking for a classic yellow cake for a long time and I cannot believe that it was right here all this time!This has come out prefect every time! Very light, moist and delicious! (The key is creaming the butter and sugar till fluffy and adding the egg one at a time just like you do making cookies!)

I have tried a few yellow cake recipes but THIS ONE IS THE BEST!!  I usually make cupcakes and this recipe was PERFECT!! I took the advice of some of the others that commented on this recipe and I beat the butter and sugar for approximately 6-8 minutes.  I also used 4 whole eggs as opposed to 8 egg yolks and the only difference was the color (much lighter shade of yellow). The cupcakes  were VERY moist. I used variation of chocolate, butter cream and cream cheese frostings and they all complimented the cup cakes. I also put a squirt of cream cheese filling In the middle.Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe! "DESERT DESSERTS"

Delicious! This cake was super easy to make and tastes great. I had no problem with texture or flavor. The 8 egg yolks worried me, but I followed the recipe exactly as written and was not disappointed. As others have stated, make sure you really cream the butter/sugar together (and it goes without saying, use REAL butter). Eggs/butter should be brought down to room temp naturally for best results (I throw them on the counter a couple of hours before I start baking). I used a hand-mixer for butter/sugar, then to add in the eggs/vanilla. Once it's super creamy, I then added the flour and milk (alternating, starting/ending with flour) and mixed it in by hand -  not beaters. Don't overcook the cake (stab with fork, if a few crumbs come off on the fork, it's ready - if it comes out clean, probably overcooked, cook it less next time). This is going to be my go-to yellow cake from now on for sure! I love this cake.

I'm not sure why others complained about a dry cake, ours was super moist and delicious. My only modification was that I used 5 eggs (4 whole eggs and 1 yolk only).  I used organic eggs that are not as huge as some in the regular packages.  I also beat the sugar and butter a good bit as well as the eggs - adding them one at a time.
Follow up:
I've made this cake several times now and it has always turned out wonderfully!  Will NEVER by a box cake again. :)
I didn't have cake flour so I used all purpose flour and reduced the amount by 2 TBS per 1 C of all purpose flour.

Very tasty! It tastes likes its from a bakery! My only substitutions (especially for those who said it tastes like cornbread) is to add more sugar! I added an extra 1/3 cup and followed the directions and it came out good. It took longer than 30 minutes to bake but nonetheless my husband and I enjoyed it. This cake was the last piece that made our anniversary special

I love this recipe! Now I did tweak it a little bit and I'm sure all those health nuts out there would cringe but instead of using 8 egg yolks and not having a need for the whites, I used 5 whole eggs :) It turned out so moist and fluffy I didn't even need to put icing on it. My husband who is not a big on sweets/deserts loves this cake! Delicious !!

OMG!! This recipe is perfect. So moist and holds nicely. I wanted a natural cake and this is it. I added the 4 yolks and 2 whole eggs like suggested. I tried the recipe also with 8 yolks, it was nice and yellow more dense but still good. I wanted a little more rise the little egg whites helped. So good without frosting !! Thanks for sharing no more artifical additives !!

Best cake I have ever made! I followed directions exactly, measured carefully and it came out moist light (but denser than a boxed cake) and delicious. My kids recognized right away this was no  ordinary boxed cake. I was really proud of the cake it was beautiful!

I followed this recipe exactly.  I just used two 9" cake pans instead of 8".  I made sure that all of the cold ingredients were room temp before mixing.  Another thing that I did was I cut an old towel into strips (the width of my cake pans), wet the strips in cold water, then wrapped the strips around the outside of my pans before baking (I use large safety pins to keep strips in place).  I learned this from a woman who worked as a professional baker for several decades.  This helps the cake bake evenly so you don't have burned edges and raw middles.  It also keeps the cake level as it bakes.  The cake was very good!  It was not dry or dense and tasted 1000% better than any box mix!  I've seen yellow cake recipes with an extensive list of ingredients but this recipe is good just the way it is.  Thank you for sharing it!

I never thought I'd try to make a yellow cake from scratch because they always turned out dry and crumbly or cornbread like.  This recipe shattered all my myths! Just because of this recipe, I might be officially done with box cake mixes.  I didn't have cake flour, so I double-sifted, and all I had on hand to use was canned milk.  It came out light, fluffy, and sweet, and I made cupcakes.  I can't wait to make this into some layers and icing!

Tastes delicious but not good for high altitude.  i followed the directions exactly but reduced the baking soda and salt by half.  The cake still rose up and spilled out of the pan onto to the bottom of the oven.  I let it finish baking and my daughters and I spooned it out of the pan and ate it.  It was delicious--very moist and crumbly--delicious but no good for a cake to decorate.

The best yellow cake ever. I watched the video and it was helpful. Cake flour gives this cake a fluffy, perfect texture.
 -Iced our cake with Homemade Caramel Icing. 1/2 cup unsalted butter, 1 Cup packed Dark Brown sugar, 1/4 cup milk, Pinch of Kosher Salt, 1/4 tsp. Vanilla Extract, 2 cups sifted Powdered Sugar.
-Melt butter in double boiler, gradually whisk in brown sugar until sugar is melted, add milk, salt, vanilla, whisking occasionally, bring to slow boil, remove from heat, cool in large mixing bowl ,gradually whisk in powdered sugar

I'm on the hunt for a scratch yellow cake recipe and tried this one tonight.  It's okay but isn't great. I made cupcakes to test it.  IMO a good cake recipe should be able to do both cakes and cupcakes. So while this may make a good cake, as others attest, as a cupcake it was not good at all.  They rose oddly and spread out rather than in a standard dome and after cooling they sank a bit in the centers.  (My leavening agents are fresh and used frequently so it's not an ingredient problem.). The cake itself was mottled in color rather than a uniform golden. Quite unappetizing in appearance, to be candid, which was disappointing because the batter was beautiful!  The taste was okay.  I actually liked the flavor of the cake but it was very dense and too dry.  I was sure not to over mix and to follow the directions precisely to ensure the best results possible.  I'm disappointed in how my cupcakes turned out and won't use this recipe again, although I am happy to hear others enjoyed it nonetheless.

This is the best yellow cake I have ever eaten.  I went on line and looked up yellow cake and this site popped up. I baked the cake, making only one change 1. I added 1/4 cup cultured buttermilk blend powder to the cake flour, this gives it a little tang. Wow!! You know how you get the crunch around the cake and the even rise and fluffy texture, well I had that. Also, when you make your icing, browning the butter will take your icing to another level. I always brown the butter because this gives way more butter/nutty flavor.  All you have to do is melt the butter in a pan until it becomes fragrant and is starting to turn A LITTLE brown (the butter smell sort of bursts through and that will tell you when to stop), take it off the heat and put it in a glass container and let it come down to room temp.

I searched and searched for a light and moist (and simple) yellow cake recipe, nothing was ever good enough (and I'm not a fan of box cakes). Well as others have also said, the search ends here. This IS the ultimate yellow cake recipe, and it goes well with just about anything - with or without any toppings. I've made cupcakes, tiered cakes and custom shaped cakes out of this recipe and its just perfect for anything.  
One thing you have to be careful with is handling it - it's very very soft and breaks easily. It carved fine when I carved it into a shape, but it's very delicate to handle. Tastes awesome though, and it's worth the extra 'hassle'
I usually top it with ganache or whipped ganache, it tastes wonderful. In fact I'm going to make some right now

For those of you having trouble with the recipe - as others have suggested, make sure your ingredients are room temp, and try to follow every step exactly as written, and also.. If you own a kitchen scale, go the extra mile and weigh all the ingredients - it's worth the extra step. 

Great recipe, one worth carving into stone

This was my first time making a yellow cake from scratch. The recipe is incredibly easy to follow and the results are amazing. I was afraid the batter was going to flow out of the pan while it was baking b/c it had risen so much. lol  The cake is really moist and fluffy.  I don't think I'll ever buy store bought mixes again! Thanks for sharing your recipe, David! =]

I followed the advice of other users, and used 3 whole eggs in the recipe. This cake is AMAZING. Perfect crumb texture, moist, and lovely light yellow color. Like any cake, be sure to NOT over mix the batter, or it will be tough and nasty.

Just tried this and it was incredible.  I cut the recipe in half and made a single layer in an 8x8 square pan, frosted with a chocolate buttercream, and it turned out just fine.  Be sure to use cake flour, it makes a huge difference in the texture.

Loved it, I made this cake for my parents 15th wedding anniverary, and they loved it. I liked using the cake flour better, Because in the past I've tried making cakes with all purpose, and the cake was not good, not only was the cake nasty, but it was chewy, not even done, and the texture was horrible. When I made this cake, I was worried, but now I am more confident to make more cakes like this in the future. The batter tasted good! just like if I made it out of the bettey crocker box, even better, And the cake actaully looked like a cake when I was done baking it. No more "Fake n' bake" for me, This is my #1 favorite!

I followed other suggestions (used whole eggs instead of yolks; all-purpose flour + cornstarch instead of cake flour), and I think this cake is blah.  Not a lot of flavor, dry, and nothing like I expected.  I'm going to search for another "from scratch" recipe or stick with the Cake Mix Doctor.

I am sending this review only for those who live at high altitude!!

I tried this recipe, and followed directions WORD FOR WORD, but it did not turn out.  I don't fault the recipe for this, but for the fact that I live at 6500'.  In looking back over the recipe, I think there is a ratio of too many egg yolks and butter for high altitude.  I did add a little more flour (as is customary for HA) but after 30 minutes of baking, it was over-done on the outside, and still liquid-raw on the inside.

What DID over cook, however, tasted really good!  I love the flavor of this cake; I only wish I had tried it when I lived at 1500' !!!

Fantastic recipe. I followed every direction faithfully and carefully, and ended up with two wonderful layers of yellow cake - very tasty! I managed to forget to add the milk to the batter at first, so I only added it at the end, but it hardly made any difference (of course, next time I'll try to make it right). The tops of the layers came out just a tad bit burnt, but this might be my old oven's fault. Either way, the taste and texture of the cake were perfect.

I made this cake for my sister's birthday party, and as I'm not yet that good at cake decoration, I was afraid her thirteen-year-old friends weren't going to like it so much. Nevertheless, all I got were comments about how amazing the cake was - they ate up almost all of it in under two hours!

Very impressed. I know that next time I'm certainly going to make more of the batter, since my layers seemed a little too thin.

Lightest, fluffiest, tastiest yellow cake I have ever made.  This will definitely be my go-to from now on.  You definitely have to act as though "air" is one of the ingredients, and beat that cream and sugar together until you just can't take it anymore.

I had made this for my Dad's birthday and it was gone the next night. To make it cool, I separated the mix and added food coloring into the separate mixes. Then I poured them onto the pans and baked. For frosting, I used the recipe that is also on Allrecipes "Fluffy Frosting" and added food coloring.

I was looking for a good cupcake recipe and after trying a few different ones this was definitely the best. I tried the original recipe first and although it was moist and had a decent flavor I felt it could use more so I add a packet of vanilla pudding (unmade) and sifted it with the flour, baking powder, and salt. I found my batter to be a little too thin and they didn't rise properly so I added more flour till it looked thick enough about 1/4 cup. After making these minor adjustments these turned out to be great cupcakes with great flavor. They tasted so good my family ate several before I had time to frost them.

O M G!  Best Yellow Cake EVER!!!!  This was so fluffy and moist and I got so many compliments on it.  I used the leftover egg whites to make an Italian Meringue Buttercream for it and they just paired together marvelously.  Am planning to make this for a wedding shower cake this weekend!  I leveled every single scoop of dry ingredients to the "T" and had zero faults.  Thanks for posting this amazing cake recipe!!!

I cannot believe that I have not rated this recipe yet!  This is my only yellow cake recipe (since 2002).  What I do differently is add pudding to make it even more moist.  I love to experiment! Last time I added a box of sugar free french vanilla pudding mix, but you can add any flavor you like.  The trick is to add a light-colored flavor so the cake remains yellow. It changes the flavor a little bit, but that is a good thing!

I substituted 1/4 c of shortening for 1/4 c of the butter. It helped keep it moist & less crumbs.

I was really hoping for a yellow cake that tastes better than a box one. (I even used organic European butter). I did what some of the others did and used 4 whole eggs instead of 8 yolks. Maybe that is the difference. ??  I also wish I had baked it only 20 minutes instead of 25. It came out well, was easy to frost, and looked delicious. But it just wasn't as moist and overall as delicious as I would have hoped. I don't know if I will bake it again. I just don't think it was worth the effort.

I made this cake and followed the directions. I did not have to change a thing about it, it is very moist and decadent. This is one of my husbands favorite desserts and I enjoyed making it for him. I would recommend this to anyone who loves yellow cake. Thank you David for sharing this recipe! it's a keeper!

I've been looking for a yellow cake, and this is it. I tried this recipe before but didn't have enough egg yolks, I figured it would be okay, but no....I ended up with a cake the same consistency as pound cake. I needed a light, springy cake and this was perfect. Topped mine with raspberry whipped cream and homemade chocolate ganache and it was lovely!

This cake was very, very dry and crumbly,oddly enough, my family and I agreed that it reminded us of cornbread when we tried it. The flavor balance was lovely,. I am confident that it was not an error in executing the recipe; I am a competent baker and double-checked my ingredients before baking. It might possibly have been just very slightly overbaked, but it appeared perfect. It just didn't work out.

I'm sure this cake would be five-star-worthy if made properly. It was good, but the texture ended up grainy and cornbread- like for me. To avoid this, you must use an electric mixer to beat the batter for at least a few minutes. Good recipe, though!

I've used Allrecipes for a lot of my cooking and not once have I left a review for anything until now. This recipe for yellow cake is amazing! I recently had to make a wedding cake for my friends and decided to use yellow cake for some of the layers. I trusted all of the good reviews about this recipe and I definitely have no regrets whatsoever! I can't believe how good this is. It's so good on its own without any frosting/icing.. whatever! Moist, not too sweet and it isn't dry. I think the key to the perfect cake and a lot of baked goods is not only to be careful of over-baking them but also to not over-MIX the batters either! I love this recipe and I sure have tried a few and this one is my favorite.

I LOVE this cake! So light and fluffy! I am making it for my daughter's birthday cake. I did a trial run to make sure it would be good, and it definitely is. Also very easy to make. I made one mistake and almost forgot to add the milk, but added it last. Crisis averted! Didn't make a difference though. Still a perfect cake.

This cake was AMAZING I used it for ice cream cone cupcakes and it tasted great. It made a lot of batter so I made 12 ice cream cone cupcakes and 24 mini cupcakes with some left over. My mom liked the batter so much she ate all the left over batter with a spoon. Also I was thinking that the egg amount was too much, but then I tried all of the eggs like it was said to do and I thought that this would make it taste eggy, but quite the opposite. I heard that people said that it tasted like cornbread, I thought it tasted like 1/10 cornbread. Never will I use box again. And if anyone is thinking about the substitute(4 whole eggs instead of 8 yolks) don't do it. I added a bit more vanilla and it made it taste like a sort of vanilla cake, which is sort of the way I like it. BEST YELLOW CAKE EVER!

Very easy to make. I used 7 egg yolks and all purpose flour simply because that's what I had. It was still very moist, vanilla-y, and delicious.

This cake tasted good and was very soft and fluffy, but it was waaaay too soft.  It wouldn't hold together, and it didn't rise at all.  It sunk.  I made one round cake and a few cupcakes.  The tops came off of the cupcakes when I frosted them.  The cake was so soft, it just sunk. 

Also, the edges of the cupcakes started to burn while the middles were still batter.  I didn't want the same to happen to the large cake, so I turned the temp down to 325.  The large cake took about 50 minutes to finish (total).  I kept hoping the middle would rise a bit,but it was just one, large sink hole.

Soooooooo moist and fluffy, almost in sponge cake territory, but not quite.  Sift thoroughly, don't be lazy about putting in the eggs one at a time, and you will have a tasty cake!!!  I made mini and regular sized cupcakes with this. I put chocolate buttercream on top, which was delicious, but I also think I'll try something a little lighter next time to showcase the airiness of the cake.

My first time trying to make a cake from scratch - and it turned out fabulous!  I have now made it several times and it is always rich and moist.  I am currently living in France and I have used the patisserie flour in place of the cake flour.  If you are looking for a good tasting recipe and don't have a lot of experience with cooking from scratch, I definitely recommend this one.

I followed the directions exactly and the only change I made was to use regular flour & cornstarch instead of cake flour. It took me quite a while to separate the eggs (one at a time), add, beat, then repeat. My problem was that I couldn't figure out when it was done-I know a bunch of people commented on that. I ended up slightly overcooking because I never felt like it "sprung" up under my touch :P So the flour that I had used to line the pans burned! Luckily, we were able to scrape it off, but that was disappointing. I found the cake to be a bit dense...I did use whole milk (because I only drink whole milk)-I wonder if that just made it too thick? But I enjoyed making it from scratch and knowing it was whole foods and no preservatives. And it was tasty with a chocolate buttercream icing and vanilla ice cream ;)

Don,t know what happened but it came out like a rock. Hard, dry. I made another recipe afterward the same night bc my sons b-day was the next day so I needed a cake I could serve and the other recipe tuned out great. Maybe I didn't,t beat the butter, sugar and eggs long enough in this one?

I used the recipe to make a birthday cake for my son.  It was a big hit!  The cake was very moist and delicious - not dry and crumbly at all.  It was very easy to ice.  I didn't have problems with getting crumbs in the icing like I do with box cakes.  I did use 4 whole eggs instead of 8 egg whites as was suggested by others.  This is definitely the only recipe I will use in the future.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  I've used this for cake and for cupcakes.  Rave reviews from those who've had it.  I save it for special occasions because it uses 8 egg yolks.  I have to make sure my husband is in the mood for an 8 egg white omelette first.  It's very moist and great with chocolate frosting.

Good recipe. I made cupcakes with it. My only recommendation (as mentioned in the previous post) is not to overbake -- otherwise you'll be left with an undesireable "eggy" flavor...

I had a heck of a time with this cake >: /  It stuck to the pans really bad! I used a non stick pan, pans I've always used and had sprayed. Not sure what the problem was? So just a warning to others. And I did follow the recipe to a T! Taste was great Not too eggy.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving with a homemade caramel frosting and it was AWESOME!  Everyone loved it and expressed how it reminded them of the cake their grandmother used to make back in the day.  That was such a compliment.  I didnt have cake flour so I substituted with all purpose and cornstarch sifted. Thank you, Thank you!! I will use this recipe on a regular basis.

This is an amazing cake recipe.  I can't believe how moist it is.  However I think I will have to whip it less since it may not hold up to a two layer cake.  We shall see.  This recipe is way above any box cake mix.  You just have to follow directions and beat well when you do.

Tweaked this recipe to make it dairy-free.  Kept quantities the same but substituted Nuttelex for butter, and used soy milk instead of regular, then baked it in a 13x9 Pyrex dish.  Result was a cake with a lovely moist crumb, just perfect.

Good basic cake.  I sometimes have trouble with homemade cakes being overdone on the edges before the rest is done, but this one did pretty well in a Bundt cake pan.

I used this for my mother's 60th birthday cake....EVERYONE LOVED IT!  I also used the recipe for cupcakes.  It yielded a little more than 2 dozen.  The only change in either instance: I used 4 eggs instead of 8 yolks.

I used this as a base for chocolate cranberry cupcakes as well.  I added 4 TBS of cocoa powder, an additional 1/4 cup of milk and 2 cups diced dried cranberries.

I made cupcakes out of this. I froze them so I could send them individually in lunches and not worry about them drying out if we didn't eat them quickly. They were a little dry straight out of the oven, but after they were frozen and re-thawed they were AMAZING. Even my husband, who doesn't really like sweets, loved these! We'll be using this recipe again.

First time using this recipe, and the cake turned out very moist and tastes great.  The only problem is it looks and tastes like angel food cake, not yellow cake.  Based on the other reviews, I think it must be something I did...I halved the recipe, but other than that followed it to the letter, so I have no idea what I did wrong.  At least it still tastes great!

ok, I screwed this up and it still came out good (but didn't rise much (which I am sure is my fault).  I was making it with my 7 yr old so not paying as much attention to the steps as I would normally.  she cracked all the eggs (whole) in with the butter.  oops!  so I just threw in the sugar and attempted to cream them all together.  didn't work so well, lol!  So threw in the dry ingredients (didn't have cake flour so used AP), only had 1/2 tsp vanilla so I added 1/2 cup of OJ and omitted the  milk.  We poured it into flat bottom ice cream cones and baked for 20 mins.  they didn't really get much over the top, but the flavor is great and we just made up the height with icing!  the kids loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly with my 8 year old "helping", and this came out as one delicious cake. Moist, great texture. This is not as easy as using a box, but the results are absolutely worth it!

Love this recipe.  Worked great as a two layer cake.  I also used Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe on this site and I got amazing reviews.  I did try to use this recipe for cupcakes and it doesn't rise perfectly.  I am still giving 5 stars since the cake as two layers according to recipe came out perfect.

This is just what I was looking for!  This doesn't taste anything like a boxed cake mix so if you're looking for something like that this is not it!  If you're looking for something like your grandmother or great grandmother made when you were a kid this is spot on!  Top it with a chocolate buttercream frosting and you'll be in heaven.

It's a great, go-to cake recipe. I followed it and simply got great results. I have NO IDEA how some folks got cornbread-like results. I occasionally add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to most cake recipes for moisture... I did that here out of habit, I and I did the common conversion to cake flour by using reg flour and cornstarch. My batter was very thick and smooth and baked into one doozy of a delicious cake!

This is the BEST cake recipe ever. I use it regularly. If I am short on eggs I just use 5 whole eggs (yolks and whites) and it turns out perfectly, just not as yellow!

I didn't mix these perfectly though I tried. I made a two layer 10 inch cakes doubling this recipe. It was a little heavy compared to box mix but tasted good and was eaten by most. It's probably a good butter cake but just not light enough for us, thanks to the box mixes.

Bottom Line, if it's bad....you messed it up somehow or are WAY to used to Box cake. I am a pretty experienced baker, I made this recipe almost exactly the way it's written ,(i added 3 tablespoons of sour cream)  and it's delicious. It tastes like a butter cake, a very rich, buttery, golden, southern cake. Its spongy in texture, fluffy, and just dense enough. I made some of the batter in to cupcakes, it's great for that too, but denser than some people might like (it also sunk in a little bit, ill have to work on fixing that when i make this into cupcakes). With a rich creamy chocolate frosting, it would rival NYC's Magnolia Bakery. I cater cakes/cupcakes, and will use this recipe again and again. I can't wait to use it as a base, and make it my own! THANK you for a perfect yellow cake...finally !! 
my boyfriend....asks to have this made for his birthday every year. he LOVED it.

I made no changes to the ingredients, and think this is the best scratch yellow cake recipe I've tried from this site.  Decent flavor and more moist than most.  Butter makes a real difference in flavoring yellow cakes, so don't use substitutes.  I would have enjoyed a cake that was slightly more moist, but for now, this one is a keeper in the files.

I have to say that although some of this recipe was tedious the ending product was amazing and tasted great. I didnt alter anything about this recipe I did everything that the directions said to do and it was good. The only problem i had was I didnt use enough of a levening agent (bc i didnt have enough) but the cake still rose and tasted wonderful.

This cake, if prepared as directed is WONDERFUL.  If it seems dry it's b/c you are over cooking it- this type of cake has the ability to go from perfect to over-done in about 3 minutes!!

This is a wonderfully moist and tender yellow cake, and not at all difficult to make. It needed to bake longer in my oven, which is slow, but as long as you keep testing it, that shouldn't be a problem. Served frosted with sturdy whipped cream frosting for Easter dinner, and it was delicious. Thanks!

This is a delicious cake however I did need to bake it longer than 30 mins.  Other than the baking time it was a great tasting yellow cake. I highly recommend using a dulce de leche cake filling with strawberries. :0)

Like Many people, my cake cooked well on the outside and collapsed in the center. It took over 45 min to get the cake cooked. Not sure where things went wrong, but I will not be making this recipe again...

This was pretty good.  It didn't rise as much as I had hoped but I can add a little more baking powder next time.  I added some crushed dehydrated strawberries (1/2 cup) and a couple tablespoons water to the batter.  I also used 4 whole eggs and used ap flour so I took 4 tablespoons out.  I frosted it with a whipped vanilla frosting.  It was good and everyone asked for more!

I made this recipe a few days ago and it ended up a bit dense, however I did not cream my butter and sugar long enough, it should be almost white when done properly. The second time around I also added and extra 1/2 tsp of baking powder so it rose a bit higher. Great taste when made properly!

this came out amazing.  i used 3 whole eggs and 2 yolks.  i also used all-purpose flour because i didn't have cake flour handy.... but i took out 2 tablespoons per cup of flour and added 2 tablespoons per cup of flour of corn starch (google helped me find out the conversion of all purpose flour to cake flour).... i think i over mixed JUST a bit and will hold back next time.... also, if this is your first time making a cake batter from scratch - this will not look like cake batter from a box... it also won't pour/spread like cake batter from a box... it's much thicker and you sort of have to spread it evenly in the cake pans yourself.  great recipe - i'll definitely make again!  thank you for sharing!

The cake tastes really good. I didn't have an issue with it being dry but it is pretty dense.  Next time I'm using all purpose flour instead of cake flour.

The cake itself tasted OK.  I made "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this website and because of that, the cake and frosting together tasted great.  But I don't think I would've eaten the cake on it's own.  It either had too much flour or too much baking powder.  It was more like a pound cake than a light and airy yellow cake.  I don't think I'll be trying this recipe again.

Delicious! Yes, a teensy bit dry, but  better than a boxed cake any day.  It has a fine crumb and rich buttery flavor; a very nicely textured cake.

Amazingly superb! I've never done yellow cake from scratch before and I don't think I'll ever bake one from the box again! I added about 15% more milk as some reviewers suggested to add some more.  I also topped it with the cream cheese mixture from the Neiman Marcus recipe (8 ounce cream cheese, 2 cups confectioner's sugar, 2 eggs).  It came out moist, the aroma is heavenly buttery, the texture is soft and fine, and the sweetness is just right!!!

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  The search stops here in looking for a moist yellow cake!  I followed the advice of others in that I sifted the flour and baking powder twice and beat the egg yolks one by one.  Thank you for this gem of a recipe!

I followed the recipe carefully as advised in other reviews.  It was good but turned out very crumbly and was difficult to frost.  I wasn't too surprised by this since I've made Duncan Hines recipes since I was little and have found that the mixes that call for butter tend to fall apart and those that call for oil stay together much better.

I baked this cake for my boyfriend's birthday on the weekend and it was a hit! People thought it was a boxed cake mix cake but I had to let them all know that, No- it's from scratch! I frosted it with a coconut cream cheese frosting and it was delicious. I think that the cake one its own was quite sweet and I may cut down the sugar next time by 1/4C-1/2C. Also, if using frosting, it just adds to the sweetness. I followed the recommendations by naples34102 and because I didn't have cake flour, I substituted 2 tbsp cornstarch for 2 tbsp of the all purpose flour. I also used 2-9 inch pans and baked them about 23 minutes but found that the layers weren't nice and thick like a store bought cake, so I may try and double the recipe in the future to make a really tall cake. The cake itself was a hit and I am glad to have found a great basic cake recipe that is flexible to use for many kinds of cakes and different occassions without having to use a boxed mix. I just don't like articificial ingredients. Also, I am curious if anybody has attempted to make this cake healthier (for example use whole wheat flour and a more natural sugar). Please post a review if you do. Thanks for the great recipe!

After making this recipe several times the best recommendation I can give is this - use half shortening (I like butter-flavored) and half butter.  It makes the cake light and moist.  When I tried all butter I ended up with a dry and heavy cake.

This cake recipe was a little more on the difficult side. I made a few changes to make it easier, and I advise you do the same, because it really works! - I used 4 whole eggs instead of 8 egg whites, and I used powdered sugar to make the sugar and butter become fluffier. If you are like me, and want to make this healthier, you can use a butter substitute instead of the real thing. I used I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER baking sticks. It works the same as other butters, just a bit better for you. In my opinion, this was extremely tasty, but just a little hard to make. But, with my changes, hopefully your turnout will be as easy as it was for me!

I made this cake using Splenda sugar substitute, because my dad's diabetic. (I had to add 3/4 cup nonfat dry milk and 3/4 tsp baking powder so it would rise properly using the substitute.)  Also, since I only had all purpose flour, I used that but substituted 2 tsp of cornmeal per cup as others had suggested.  So with that in mind, the texture is nice and "heavy" compared to boxed cake, which I'm used to.  This wasn't overly sweet, which I appreciate because very sweet cakes don't appeal to my family.  My only gripe is that it is very eggy--I've made this 3x and next time I'll try using just 4 yolks like others have.  Some people said this tastes like cornbread, and I can see the comparison because of the texture and the eggy-ness.  I read the reviews beforehand but was still surprised that it reminded me of cornbread.  No, there's not cornmeal in it but I liken it to the simple texture experiment where apples and onions are texturally indistinguishable among people who cannot smell/have their noses plugged. The textures were similar, maybe its because of the all purpose flour. The only time I made this using real sugar was when I used it for the Mandarin Orange Cake from this site, which normally uses boxed cake mix.

I have 4 children and therefore lots of birthday parties and class parties and scout parties and sports team parties (you get the picture).  I have been searching for the perfect yellow cake to use for frosted cakes.  This cake was OK but it was not as light as I would have liked or flavorful enough.  I will keep searching.  The one positive thing I can say about this recipe is that it is a DENSE cake - almost like a pound cake - it held up great in a shaped pan.  I've made the recipe twice.

This was my first ever from scratch cake.  I read through some of the most recent reviews and was sure to follow the directions exactly.  I read that double sifting is a good thing so I did that and I took time to beat in each egg yolk individually.  I was blown away by how incredible this cake tasted when I was done!!!  Even the batter was incredible - so velvety smooth and sweet.  PERFECT!  As far as I'm concerned this could easily be served at a wedding - it was THAT good.  Now if I can just find the perfect buttercream frosting to accompany it and learn how to make it look pretty!

I'm not a huge fan of cake, but I love this one, particularly when used in the 'Fresh Strawberry Upside Down Cake' from this site.  This cake is very moist and much better than boxed.    I followed the recipe other than not sifting the flour (don't have a sifter) and I used the entire egg.  I used all-purpose flour because that's all I had available.  I was careful to add eggs one at a time and alternate flour with milk when mixing.  I think this may be an important step, as suggested by other reviewers.

This was very tasty and not at all dry.  It was very light and fluffy but rich at the same time (as a result of the egg yolks I guess).... unlike any other cake from scratch I've ever made.  This was not what I had in mind (I was looking for something moist but just a bit more dense).... but the result was delicious.

I made this cake exactly as written. It was THE BEST yellow cake from scratch I have ever had.  It was moist, not too sweet, just crumbly enough, perfect!  This is now my yellow cake recipe.  So much better than boxed cake!

I made a ton of substitutions out of necessity and this still came out pretty darn good.  I was out of butter, white sugar, and cake flour, and short on eggs.  I substituted shortening and sour cream for the butter - about 1/2 c each. I substituted Maui Raw Sugar for white sugar 1:1. I substituted 1 c all purpose flour and 1 c buttermilk pancake mix for the cake flour. I added the four whole eggs like someone else did instead of the 8 yolks (I don't like saving whites or yolks anyway). I doubled the amount of salt. Followed instructions as given.   The result was a surprisingly good tasting (but not so much smelling) cake. It is moist, but a tad oily for me which I attribute to the shortening.  It was a little egg-y for me also. It was light and fluffy and honestly looked just like the picture on here.  I will be trying this recipe again when I have all the ingredients on hand. 8 yolks does seem a bit much for me though; I will probably keep it to four whole eggs.

This is a very good yellow cake recipe...but I had some problems with it. They were probably my own fault, so I'm going to give this recipe 5 stars anyways, because, in spite of my problems, it was an awesome cake! I was making LovestoHost's Cookie Dough Cupcakes with my sister, and she didn't want to use cake mix, so we decided to make this cake instead. The batter worked out very well, and it seemed to be a good substitute for the cake mix. However, my oven overheats, and the cupcakes (and cake) got a bit overbaked on the edge before the middle was done. Straight from the oven, the cake (even overbaked!) was as tender as could be, but as it sat, the edges got very crispy. I was disappointed, but the  finished cupcakes actually were quite moist, in spite of the edges. Altogether, I would probably make this cake again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I was skeptical because i've been trying a lot of recipes but this one was very good! A couple of adjustments i made, use 1 whole egg plus 3 egg yolks, and i added almost a 1TBSP extra milk. Lastly i followed the suggestion of a previous poster and used AP flour with 2TBSP replaced with cornstarch. It was perfect, no more betty crocker for me.

I have never made cake from scratch, but I have to say that this was the BEST cake I have ever had. Delicious! I only had AP flour so I used the 3/4 cup of flour to tablespoons of starch to make cake flour which worked great. I made 18 cupcakes out of this recipe and baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes. I took them out when the toothpick was clean and the cake came back up when I pushed on them, but they still looked a little undercooked. I'm glad I took them out any longer and I would have overcooked them. Perfect!!

I very rarely take the time to review anything BUT I had to in this case. I have been searching for a good moist yellow cake. I usually use DH cake mix with no complants. However, who doesn't want to make a true made from scratch cake. Getting to the point I promise... I followed this recipe exactly, 8 eggs and all. I beat the butter and sugar for about 5 minutes. Baked the cake for 29 minutes. And I am happy to report that it was delicious. Good crumb, not too dense, moist. My 21 yr od son which will tell no lie, said it was "pretty good, melts in your mouth". I think I may have found THE cake for me. It is as they say a keeper! :)

I am no cake snob, but  I do recognize a good cake when I taste one.  Using modifications and suggested listed by others, this cake was phenomenal. I used previous advice and took my time in the creaming process.  It must be done slowly and the butter needs to be at room temperature.  The cake was so moist!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This cake is delicious and moist. I wanted to make a layer cake with one layer of chocolate so I experimented and ended up with this: Replace 1/3 cup of the flour with cocoa powder and add an additional 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder (these changes are to the whole recipe.) This chocolate version is great too and has the same texture as the yellow cake.

The flavor of this cake was good and it was moist, but I had a really difficult time getting it to keep its form when I stacked the layers on top of each other. Maybe I did something wrong? I don't know... It was good though.

Very good, rave reviews from my family. This was my first attempt in making a yellow cake from scratch. I read the reviews and made a few variations to the recipe, but it turned out great.  I used four yolks and two whole eggs.  I also added in half a box of instant pudding mix. Everything else was the same.  I did the toothpick test to know when to take it out. Turned out great.

As previous reviewer stated, the cake kind of caved in the middle on me too. It looked fine in the oven but as soon as I took it out to cool, it caved. I thought that I had taken it out to early or something, but it tested done. regardless, it was the BEST yellow cake recipe I have ever used. It was very moist and delicious. The recipe I used it in required it to be refrigerated(with raspberry mousse filling and raspberry buttercream) so I did not get to experience it as soft and moist as it could be so I can not wait to make it again with another recipe!

With chocolate frosting, this tasted good.  However, all by itself, I thought it was lacking a little in the flavor department.  It was nice and moist, and had a nice crumb to it.  Before anyone accuses me of comparing it to boxed cake mix, let it be known that I don't particularly like yellow boxed cake mix.  I have just had more flavorful from scratch yellow cake.

I thought this was a perfect yellow cake from scratch! It had a perfectly tender crumb with the moistness allowing the cake to melt in your mouth. Those who are looking for it to taste like a boxed cake will be disappointed, but for those who want a wonderful moist yellow cake from scratch then this is the recipe for you.

Turned out great.  I much prefer cake from scratch than the boxed versions, and they are still just as easy to make.  Just a little extra measuring.

I was looking forward to this - licking the spoons along the way proved that this is one heck of a tasty batter.    But I must've done something wrong.  Maybe my eggs weren't eggy enough.  Maybe my baking powder wasn't the best.  Whatever it was, my cake didnt turn out light and fluffy, but was more dense.    I am going to try this one again and hopefully it will turn out.  If not, I'll just eat the batter out of the bowl.  :)

I make great cakes and this one was really good but just a little too dense. I worked out nicely for a tiered princess cake I made for my daughters birthday but on another occasion when I wouldn't need such a heavy cake I might not use it. I think it would be a great base for trifles and soaked cakes though and will be using this recipe for those types of desserts.

Wonderful cake.  I made this cake along with an Extreme Chocolate cake (filled with Butter Cream Frosting II, regular and chocolate versions) for a cake that I made for Teacher Appreciation week at my son's school.  In the thank you to everyone who made something for the lunch, they specifically said that the cake looked and tasted amazing.  I think that the tasting amazing part is the best compliment you can get on any cake.  They liked it so much that I got a call the next day asking if they could pay us to make an exact replica for a Teacher Appreciation lunch at one of the other schools in town.

I've tried this recipe years ago and didn't taste good at all.  But I tired again and turned out pretty good.  I think the key is to cream the butter and sugar REALLY good.  Then I also shifted the cake flour 4 times!!

Follow this recipe EXACTLY, in order to get 5-star results. This is my 2nd attempt at this recipe and I had the BEST results, LIGHT, FLUFFY and MOIST!  With the first attempt, I used reg flour instead of cake flour and dumped all eggs at once, etc... the results were bad (dry and hard).    I had my doubts at first with this recipe, but I read other reviews and tried, following exactly! Excellent cake! Better than a mix!!!

Excellent!  I accidently doubled this recipe, but I followed the recipe as directed.  The only change that I made was using AP flour (no cake flour on hand) substituting 2 TBSP of cornstarch for 2 TBSP of flour for each cup.  Scrumptious!  Doubling easily made 36 cupcakes and 1 bundt cake.

This was lovely!  I was looking for an easy layer cake and this fit the bill.  I used 4 whole eggs instead of yolks only because I wanted a slightly lighter color for the icing I had planned.  Then I froze the layers use later.  It was firm enough to torte easily, thawed out to be moist and flavorful and tasted great.  I will be using this again soon!

I love this cake. This is a dependable, very moist cake. I use it for my kids' birthday cake, frosted with a lemon frosting. I have tried it as written and with fewer egg yolks and more whole eggs, and both ways worked out great. Everyone loves the cake. It's in my permanent 'favorites' book. Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the directions exactly.  I worked the yolk in my palms over a bowl to make sure the egg white was all out.  This cake actually came whole instead of in chunks!  (I'm famous for not being able to get cake out of the pans in 1 piece).  It is light, airy, fluffy, and moist.  The closest it reminds me of is angel cake, but a million times better. I topped this with whipped cream cheese frosting from this site and blueberries & raspberries.  the perfect b-day cake for my 2 year old! 

Oh and for those wondering, the cake flour was about $2 and it was my first time using it.

This is the kind of butter cake recipes I have been looking for.  I'm not big on frostings so something that's good without it is for me. This is a WONDERFUL recipe!  Took the advice of other posters and used flour with cornstarch since cake flour is a luxury this kitchen may never see.  Also only used for extra large eggs and I do insist on butter.  Another point to remember is the size of the eggs.   The second time I made this with just "large" eggs and an oblong pan.  Came out heavy and flat.  It turned out the best with 4 extra large eggs and the smaller cake pans.  A lesson learned for me!  Can't stop eating it.  Hooray for David!

Wow!  I made this for my daughter's birthday party - I made a double-batch and made a four-layer cake.  I haven't frosted it yet, but I can already tell that it is remarkably fluffy and light.  DON'T TRY TO TOUCH THE TOP OF IT WHILE IT'S STILL HOT.  You will just flatten the cake.  Use the toothpick test and you'll be just fine.  Delicious!!!!

Being the first yellow cake I made from scratch it is Delish!!  I used All Purpose flour but deducted 4 tbsps.  I then took time to beat the buter and sugar mixture as well as some suggested.
It was by far the moistest yellow cake I have eaten.  I will never use box cake ever!!  The only thing is that my sides browned a bit too much at 25 mins baking time.  But the cake was moist as can be!!!  Thanks for the recipe!! My husband loves it.

My cake turned out soooo good!  It was very moist and flavorful.  I added a tablespoon of almond extract to the recipe and 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 c.   I also used a 9x13 baking dish.  That didn't turn out so well though.  I should have used 2 pans like the recipe stated.  I had to bake it longer and the edges pulled away from the sides of the dish.  It wasn't that pretty but very delicious.  I topped it with a home made whipped chocolate frosting.  next time I will try a caramel frosting.  I will continue to make this yellow cake recipe.

I am giving this 5 stars because it was so easy to make and with stuff that you would already have on hand...well, except for the cake flour.  I didnt have any so i just took  2 tbs out of each cup. Baked up perfectly.  The cake isnt overly sweet and hit the spot.  It tastes NOTHING like cornbread, who knows what those people were doing.  This was perfect for those who want to know exactly what theyre eating.  Great recipe!!

Wonderful flavor.  This is much better than your standard yellow cake recipe that uses all-purpose flour.  The cake flour and real butter makes a difference in this recipe so don't skimp, use the exact ingredients that are listed.

This has the best flavor--doesn't even need frosting really, but if you do frost it, my family likes it with a milk chocolate frosting better than a dark chocolate, as the cake is not a really sweet one.  It stays moist for days (if there's any left).

This was an amazing cake! Very dense, perfect! It came out of the pan without any problems, even though it wasn't fully cooled...very easy cake to make, too. I will definitely use this recipe again! Delicious!

It's pretty alright. Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere along the line... but I found this recipe to be a bit too gritty to fit my standards for a yellow cake. It's not bad, but it wasn't what I was expecting.

My fault - after all, I did substitute brown sugar for white and I may have undercooked it - but too moist for me (can't believe I just said that). I guess I prefer Scottley's Basic Yellow Cake. But I'm glad that I tried this after all. I may try again following the recipe exactly, but 8 eggs feels so extravagant.

This was an awesome moist cake with a wonderful flavor! I used margarine and regular flour (minus 4 TBS) and it STILL came out wonderfully textured and tasty! This will be my yellow cake recipe from now on!

this recipe may use a lot of eggs, but it's one of the better yellow cake recipes i've found. Very moist, though a bit too 'fluffy' and light (I think I might have overmixed the batter)

This recipe was OK.  I was looking more for a moist smooth cake, like you'd find at a bakery.  I followed the direction exactly to avoid some of the pitfalls described in other comments. This came out somewhat gritty like cornbread.  OK, but not great!

Very Excellent cake!! 
Some changes that i made was that I used 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs to make the cake instead of the 8 yolks. And i also added some yellow food coloring to give it a more yellow apperance! This is a more dense cake which is perfect for a layer cake (i did a 2 layer 9x13)

I made this for my daughter's birthday. It tasted more like a sponge cake and a little dry. I was disappointed in the 
outcome. However, it did get eaten up. I used 4 whole eggs and baked it in a 9x13 pan as suggested by others on here.

Excellent starting point!  Used the dry ingredients to sub in for a "yellow cake in a box" for the Black Russian Cake (also on allrecipes).  Thanks for such an easy and good recipe.  Will have to try this as a base for other cakes.

this cake is simply one of the moistest, most flavorful yellow cakes i've had in a long time.  i did make 2 changes, though, to suit my tastes--i used 4 whole eggs because i don't have a use for 8 egg whites and i used 3 tsp of vanilla because i'm a vanilla addict.  i made a cornstarch pudding to go inbetween the layers with ripe sliced banana, and frosted with seafoam frosting.  i did not think the recipe was too greasy, though my mother ALWAYS cuts back 25% on the fat in baking without any noticeable difference.  i also used parchment paper, so taking it out of the pans was simple.  some ovens run hotter than others, and i'm wondering if that's why some people came out with dry cakes . . . i usually set my clock for 5 minutes earlier than the lowest time, just to be sure i catch the cake at the right moment.  man i wrote a lot . . . but all because this cake deserves it!  woo hoo! go yellow cake of moistness! rock on!  ;)

I love this recipe, it's now the only recipe I use for yellow cakes. It's versatile in that it can be used with a lot of different frostings, from a simple whipped cream frosting to a thick, rich buttercream.
The first time I made the cake, I had trouble getting it out of the pan, but if you line the bottom with wax paper, the cake comes right out and you can just peel off the wax paper, leaving you with a perfect cake.

This was a cake with excellent flavor: rich, buttery, and a little eggy.  The color is a nice medium yellow and the consistency was a firm, moist, crumbly cake.  Medium sweetness, a surprising amount of flavor.  In fact, I used lemon curd and whipped cream to top it and thought next time I'd nix the lemon curd to let the cake's natural flavor come through more.  Way to go, Dave.  This one's going in my recipe box!

This cake was awesome - moist and very tasty with a good texture.  The only problem I had was getting it out of the pan and that was my fault for not letting it cool long enough.  I used a cooked chocolate frosting with it and it turned out great.

This cake recipe was amazing. I followed it to a T. I struggle sometimes with getting from scratch cake to turn out moist but this was probably one of the best scratch cakes I've made. I made sure to cream the butter and sugar until very fluffy then creamed after each addition of egg yolk. The resulting batter was thick and fluffy. I topped this with chocolate butter cream and made it for my 18 y/o bday. it was a hit and is going straight in the vault. Thank you so much for. my family to yours.

The only change I made after reading many of the other reviews was using 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs instead of the 8 yolks listed. I made cupcakes (baked about 18 minutes) and they came out wonderfully soft and tasty-everybody raved about them! Can't wait to make them again!

Great recipe - followed the directions exactly, and it produced an excellent two layer cake for my boyfriend’s birthday. Paired it with chocolate buttercream frosting: divine! It cannot be overstated to be cautious with baking time...two minutes can make or break you here. I think I left mine in for a minute too long but it was still lovely. Thanks for the recipe! Will be making this again.

The cake was really good!  It will definitely be added to my book of recipes.  I added some Butter Extract to give it more of a buttery taste.

Note to Self:  See SparkRecipes.  I scaled for 3 servings and baked in a mini cheesecake pan.   Worked perfectly. (Note to self... bake for 25-30 minutes).  I love this cake.  The perfect birthday cake with chocolate frosting.
Note:  I also added a 1/4 tsp of baking soda and 8 grams of Verka Yogurt.  And I used AP flour.

The flavor is good. But I won't make this again because of its temperamental nature. I decided to make the recipe in cupcake form so that I could freeze half of them--it's just the two of us. Some of the cupcakes were heavy and too moist along the bottom, as if the batter had separated during the baking period. Two cupcakes fell in the center, again because of the wet bottom. The oven works fine and I bake constantly--I've never had this happen with any cake.  Any yellow cake you find in the Cake Doctor cookbook would beat this strange, 8-egg recipe.

This recipe is SO great! However, if you are an inexperienced baker or don't follow directions EXACTLY, it has the potential to come out tough and dry. The biggest 'pitfalls' I can see are not properly creaming the butter and sugar (until it is white, smooth, and fluffy), using regular flour instead of cake flour (cake flour is necessary for texture), and not beating eggs one  a time/ stirring in other ingredients (also affect texture). Unfortunately, I learned how important these things are from experience (yikes) and hopefully I can save someone else from making the same mistakes!

My first cake came out  dense because I put butter and sugar in the mixer all together at once. My second cake was perfect after I first use standard mixer to beat the butter fluffy and then add sugar in little by little. I did decrease the amount of sugar to reduce the sweetness. But it’s still so good. This recipe will be one of my favorites.

I used 4 egg yolks and two complete eggs, instead of the 8 recommended.  Cake turned out light and moist. Will definitely bake this again.  Want to try it with lemon flavor added, topped with lemon frosting...or with Malibu Rum and coconut milk,  topped with coconut flakes and pineapple frosting....should make the perfect pina colada cake.

I didn't have enough butter at home so we used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. The flavor was amazing. I'm at a high elevation so I need to add a bit more flour next time because they were crumbly. Amazing recipe though

I sifted the flour mixture twice - otherwise followed the recipe (I weighed the ingredients making the conversion into grams based on the info on the packaging as needed). I used King Arthur Cake Flour & "store brand" everything else. Baked on convection for 27 minutes. Lovely buttery/vanilla flavor. I made this for someone who doesn't like the "overly sweet" flavor of boxed cake mix & pre-made frosting. It was perfect for them. Texture between moist & dry - just right. I used the Special Buttercream Frosting recipe; paired nicely with the flavor of the cake.

I've never made any cake from scratch, so I was nervous, but it came out perfect! I followed the directions exactly and it was super soft and moist. I just made one sheet pan cake, not two round cake pans. It was so sweet I didn't need to add any icing.

This certainly was moist! I even made two batches because I got distracted and burnt the first one  (oops) and it turned out moist.  The flavor was nice, but it came out much more dense than I expected both times . I wouldn't say it's a bad thing or that I wouldn't make this recipe specifically when I want a dense cake, but if you're looking for a regular density/light cake this is not the recipe for you.  I don't think this is going to be my go-to, but I'm excited to try this next time I'm planning to make a cake with an interesting shape that I want to hold up well.

Oh. My. Lord! This cake is delicious and SIMPLE. 
It is 100% moist, NOT eggy, and literally the best tasting yellow cake I have ever made. I did up the vanilla to 2tsp. 
***note to those whose cake was dry*** - you either did not mix eggs one at a time, you over beat the flour milk combination, or you over cooked it. 
This cake is simply DELICIOUS.

Please note that if you use all purpose flour for any cake, it isn’t going to turn out as soft and fluffy as it should. Cake flour is very different, so make sure you pay attention to that crucial detail here. There are a few bad reviews on here that I can just tell are based on this single mistake. If your cake turned out like corn bread, or too hard and chewy, AP flour is to blame. It’s supposed to be light and fluffy like air.

I’ve tried this recipe several times and will keep using it as the base for all of my yellow cakes. I did find it a little dry, and a bit bland as other reviewers have said. But the recipe is solid. You just have to use your imagination. I have added a variety of flavors to this batter, including hazelnut. I have also added 1 cup finely ground almonds. I did not need to alter the other ingredients, but I did try this recipe with 2 Tbs more butter and 2 additional eggs and it made a firmer cake when added to the almond variation. But it is not really necessary. I have also tried this recipe with slight variations in sugar. I added a few extra spoons, and found that it helped the flavor. I have used this batter for a wedding cake, but I added more yolks and slightly more cake flour to stiffen it up, it is a very soft cake in its original form and doesn’t layer well past a couple layers. Play around with it. Still my go-to yellow cake recipe, just needs a few tweaks to get it to do what you want. And stay away from the AP flour. If that’s all you have,

I've never actually had a yellow cake that I thought was worth eating and never make a plain yellow or white cake, but needed it for a specialty cake I was making that involved a lot of food color.  IT WAS AMAZING.  It actually tastes really good.  Vanilla.  Every list bit of the cakelets were gone including all the cutting scraps!

I made it for my grandma for her birthday. She needs to know exactly what she’s eating, so I figured I’ll make her a cake instead of purchasing it with all of the additives and bad stuff she can’t have. She loved it and so did everyone else until she hid it. Lol. Was not to eggy or dry. I did use 1 full cup of buttermilk in place of regular milk because that’s all I had. Can’t wait to make cupcakes using this same recipe!

This was my first time making cake from scratch. I followed the directions exactly as written and it turned out great! I thought the texture and taste were excellent and will not be buying boxed cake mix again. I’ll be using this recipe for my son’s birthday cake this year.

Followed the adjusted recommendations. Turned out like a typical butter cake...dense and heavy (think pound cake) but maintained a nice moisture and was not dry and crumbly. It paired nicely with the lemon curd I topped it with!

I made this cake and it completely fell in the middles. I believed I made it to a T, and I have successfully made cake from scratch before so I'm not incompetent. It still tasted delicious and was super moist so I made them into cake balls.

Trying cake recipes are a hit and miss. But this cake is delicious. If you are looking to make a simple cake just try this one. It was easy to make and good to eat.

So I have tried to make this yellow cake receipt and it world great! I have converted the cups into weight and it worked just as great. I would suggest using a bowl of hot water for steam while making it.

I halved the recipe to fit one pan and it turned out great. The cake is moist and flavourful, but not too sweet. However, make sure not to mix the egg whites into the mixture, or else the egg flavour will come out too prominent.

I made this for a small family birthday party.  I thought one recipe would be enough, but decided I needed to make 2.  The first I used 8 egg yolks, but read comments that you could use 4 whole eggs.  The second I used 4 whole eggs.  I saw no difference.  It was very tasty.  I got lots of compliments.  This will be my go-to recipe.

the recipe is great however I've made this way to many times and I've made a few changes for example when I separate the egg yolks I mix them, then I don't put one by one but instead pour all of it. When I mix the flour, baking powder, and salt I don't sift it and in my opinion it doesn't really affect the batter. At the end make sure u keep mixing until really creamy its way better it may take a little longer to get the creamy texture but trust me its worth it. I love this recipe and I hope u do too.

I am not an experienced baker and learned alot from the reviews and from making this cake.  The first one fell, but was delicious.  I think I over mixed it after adding in the flour mix and milk.  Several reviews were helpful.  I let the egg yolks, butter, and milk get to room temp before using and took my time creaming the butter and sugar.  I have made four  of these cakes since then...they are delicious and moist. A million times better than a boxed cake!  Thank you.

This yellow cake mix is the best scratch I have had.  It was easy to make , the texture is great !!  The flavor is perfect.  Thanks for sharing it :)      FYI  ,  I have duck eggs so I used 6 duck yolks instead of the 8 chicken yolks as they are much larger.

I gave this the best effort! It was, eh, okay. Edible but not something I’d want again. The egg yolks made it closer to a pound cake. A yellow cake wanting to be a pound cake? It was neither. If you like a heavier cake, go for it.

Love this recipe. I followed the ingredients and instructions to a T. I was able to get 16 cupcakes from this recipe. I creamed the butter and sugar for about 5 minutes and sifted the dry ingredients twice as another reviewer suggested. This I think added to the light yet spongy texture. Not eggy tasting at all as some had mentioned. I did take these out of the oven at about 21 minutes in. Toothpick came out clean and they were done...I think my oven runs a bit hot. Let them cool in the fridge to seal in the moisture. A trick I do with all my cakes. This recipe will be my new “go to” for a yellow cake.

I’ve made yellow cake before and it is naturally drier than other types of cakes. It reminds me more of a cornbread than a cake. To make it more moist, I added more milk until the consistency of the batter was easier to pour and I baked at 325 for 27 minutes. Came out wonderful. Using the egg yolks instead or whole eggs was a great tip.

I used the recipe as a base for yellow cake with a few changes. I used 4 whole like other suggested. I added 2 teaspoons of butter extract and used 1 cup buttermilk and frosted with Hershey’s chocolate frosting recipe. The cake was delicious.

This made DELICIOUS cake!  I followed the recipe to the T and made cupcakes with chocolate buttercream for my son’s birthday.  They were moist and delicious.  I baked 24 cupcakes at the noted temp for about 20 minutes.  Perfect!

the cake itself was good but no what I expected.   It was not moist . It tasted more like a pound cake.  Did I do something wrong?

I love this recipe. By the way, if your cake tastes "eggy" thats because your not using fresh eggs. All eggs from the store are washed with a chemical solution, some of which leeches through the shell and starts rotting the egg. The solution reaches a point of partially sterilizing the egg also. Backyard eggs are the way to go.

This cake was indeed super moist, but too sweet for my taste.  The texture, however, was really  perfect.  I made it again using  4 egg yolks and two whole eggs, and 1/4 c less sugar, and it was moist and delicious.  I will make this again, but only with the changes.

Had to give 5 stars even with some changes I made after reading reviews, but truly think if made as is would’ve been 5 stars.  I was making cupcakes and added 1/8 t more baking powder, wasn’t sure which to use so used one stick unsalted one stick salted butter, used 4 yolks and 2 whole eggs like another suggested.

This is a wonderful recipe! I made it for my sons birthday and everyone really enjoyed it. I read though the reviews before making this cake and after making it all I can say is I  didn't have any problems at all. For those that have had issues I would ask you these questions: Did you check to see if your baking powder and cake flour were fresh? Did you "cream" the butter and sugar until is was pale and fluffy? Did you use real butter not substituting margarine? Did you use good quality vanilla extract instead of the less expensive artificial vanilla. This is a good cake but sometimes when you bake you do have to ask yourself what did I get wrong.

I never made a cake with so many eggs before, and I was curious what the end result would be. Was I supposed to get a really custard-y cake? I might have done something wrong... but who cares, the end result was absolutely delicious, and very rich and decadent, for all that it was just a yellow cake. I'll be experimenting with this again. (I wonder what would happen if I substitute Bailey's for the milk? Maybe with a dash of butterscotch schnapps?)

I used this cake recipe to make cake pops out of, and they turned out amazing, as did the plain cake!! The only change I made was to add 4 whole eggs instead of just the yolks. I also accidentally added a  little more butter than called for, but this cake  Was one of the best i've ever had!!

I cut the recipe in half and used it to make a 9 inch pineapple upside down cake for me and my hubby. Came out fantastic, and is the best from scratch yellow cake recipe I have tried! Only change I made was substituting the cake flour with all purpose flour, as that it was I had on hand, replacing 2 tablespoons per cup with corn starch and double sifting. Will be my go to yellow cake for sure!!! Thanks David  :)))

It tastes really great and is very moist and delicious, however I was unprepared for how thick the batter was and make sure you grease your pans super well! This cake sticks like a mother, even when I had greased and floured my pans.

Updated to add — forgot I made it once and now just made it again. And, for the second time, one of the two layers fell. I’m so puzzled about that, but also wanted to address some of the comments from the negative reviews. I think the only truly problematic thing with this recipe is the baking time. It took a good ten minutes more than the specified time, and note you should leave it be until it’s nicely golden brown. Make sure you cream the butter and sugar thoroughly, I let them go to town in my stand mixer bowl while I sifted/measured the dry ingredients and cracked the eggs. Also I’m going to use 50% more vanilla next time, and 1/4 cup more sugar. May try part brown sugar. And final note for everyone who says it’s like cornbread: you need a new cornbread recipe! Happy baking. Orig review — First, a note. In all my 30+ years of baking (geeezz, typing that made me feel old!), I’ve never had a cake “fall,” and this one did, at least one layer did, a little bit. Anyone have thoughts or tips on that? I’m guessing it’s something I did wrong. However, I don’t even care. This is a FABULOUS recipe! I’ve hunted and pecked for a great scratch yellow cake recipe, and now I’ll be deleting all the others from my collection. I substituted Bailey’s for half the milk, just because I felt like it, and the flavor was truly WOW-worthy. I am praying for the willpower to leave it alone until I can get it filled and frosted. Btw, a note for the author and/or this site:  I came back to leave a r

I only had 6 eggs, so I only used 6 yolks. Also because of other viewers saying it was a tad dry, and since I had a new can of pineapple already opened, I put in a 1/2 cup of the pineapple juice. It turned out moist and wonderful. I used a 9x13 pan and put all the batter in. I did have to bake an additional 15 -20 minutes.

I started making this cake before I read the reviews :(  It isn't very good.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar to compensate, and it's still just barely sweet, and it tastes strangely like cornbread.

I loved this cake. I changed one thing, I mixed some sour cream with 2% milk to make 3/4 cups of liquid. After serving the cake at my grandson's 21st birthday celebration my mom thought it could use a little more vanilla flavor so next time I'll try 2 tsp. for comparison. Other than that this cake was wonderful and I will be making it again. I made it in a 9/13 pan on 350 degrees and it cooked for about 50 minutes.

The keys to success are: allow butter, milk, and eggs to come to room temperature before combining; combine flour/milk in this manner--1/3 flour, 1/2 milk, 1/3 flour, 1/2 milk, 1/3 flour; and, most importantly, do not overbake--pull out at 30 minutes and no later. Absolutely delicious. I frosted the cake with 7-minute icing. Divine!

This cake has a really nice flavor. I have made it twice and it came out the same both times. The cake came out ever so slightly on the dry side for me. Maybe I over baked it. But the flavor is there! Thank you for posting the recipe!

All you have to do is follow the recipe. I lined my cake pan with tin foil, and subbed in buttermilk, and everything worked great. The cake is moist and fluffy.

Cake is delicious, but mine overflowed in 8 inch pans and baked better in 9 inch pans. Also, I recommend lining the pans with parchment paper for perfect removal.

BEST CAKE EVER!!!! Very moist and tastes amazing. The only down side is that it uses 8 egg yolks. I did mine gluten free. I used rice flour and oat flour and xantham gum. Awesome recipe.

Really love this recipe. I replace the sugar with a 1/10th amount sucralose sweetener and its delicious and less regret after each slice. Topped off with a layer of 100g melted dark chocolate is a nice finish imo.

Siding with those whom admonish to follow the instructions, I must say it’s crucial. The density problem is solved by whipping the butter and sugar for about five minutes. The butter should have nearly doubled in volume; appearing airy.  Another tip: use “coolish” butter, not too warm. The mixing process will warm the butter. So it’s best to start with cool butter.  Also, do not over mix the batter. Many think mixing the batter “thoroughly” will make the cake better. I know! It’s counter-initiative: once you added the ingredients as prescribed - only mix the batter until its ingredients are “just” incorporated and then stop mixing!!  Over mixing will toughen the proteins in the eggs and in the flour. Also, let the batter “rest” for about 5-10 minutes before baking it.  Lastly, do not over bake it.  Knock off 5-7 minutes of baking time. Check it!  Some ovens run hotter than others. Use the center rack. Buy an oven thermometer. All of these tricks will insure a good product.  It’s not that you can’t “follow the recipe”.  There are learned techniques that are not include in most recipes. Good luck!!

This cake was too sweet and it was unstable. Just fell apart. Too many eggs yolks. I'm going to modify the recipe and try less sugar, four whole eggs, and make half the flour all purpose for more stability.

This was just okay. I've concluded that I prefer white cake or chocolate if I'm making from scratch, which is preferred and what I do most of the time. My favorite vanilla cake is from Brown-Eyed Baker--"Vanilla Cupcakes with Vanilla Buttercream Frosting."  I don't use her frosting recipe, but LOVE the cake and have made it probably 20 times. When using for cake rather than cupcakes I use 8" round pans and bake for 34 minutes. The only change I make is using plain unsweetened yogurt rather than sour cream b/c I have it on-hand more frequently.

I made this cake tonight for a bake sale at work , and it turned out great! I did not have 8 eggs so I used 4 whole eggs instead also I made a mistake  by not creaming the butter and sugar together but, it turned out moist and fluffy anyway.  Even with my mistakes this cake is wonderful.

This is BY FAR the BEST yellow cake I have ever eaten or made. I made it in a 9x13 pan and it turned out perfect. I recommend creaming the butter until fluffy, then slowly add the sugar. Sift your flour also. This yields a very yummy and fluffy cake. I'm definitely not going to look any further for my recipe!

I added a little almond flavoring. Otherwise I did everthing as directed. My only complaint is that the delicious smell overwhelmed me so I was a little clumsy getting the cake out of the pan. I have not officially eaten a slice yet, but I know that the cake is soft supple and delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe. If this recipe is reminiscent of cornbread, you used the wrong flour and did not follow the directions. Try making it again with cake flour and the good butter...

Love this cake!! I have made it several times and each time turns out moist and yummy.  The last time, I turned it into a lemon blueberry cake and it was awesome.  I added 5-6 tsp lemon zest,  adjusted the milk to half almond milk/half lemon juice and used a small package of blueberries.  I used a spring form pan and baked for 50-55 mins.  I had left out a few blueberries to add to the glaze and garnish with.  Happy baking!!!

Okay I figured out why people either LOVE this cake or don't like it at all. Its ratios of egg yolk/sugar/butter/flour are similar to pound cake and make it come out tasting more like pound cake than the yellow birthday cake made with oil and only a few whole eggs most people expect. It's delicious for sure, but some might find too dense. I used the modifications some suggested. I substituted 2 Tbs of flour for cornstarch since I only had all-purpose flour on hand, and used an additional 1/2 cup of the flour as well.  Also I only added 2 yolks and 3 whole eggs (one at a time) with 1/2 cup buttermilk in addition to the 3/4 cup of milk the recipe calls for. I used a cream cheese buttercream frosting and people loved the cake but it still reminded me of pound cake even with the modifications. I also waited until the butter and eggs were at room temperature. Make sure not to overbake. Mine took exactly 30 minutes.

I made this cake 2 times. The first time, cake had a wonderful flavor, however, it was a little on the dry side. 2nd time, I made a few adjustments to the recipe; I added 4 egg yolks, beating thoroughly after each addition, 5 whole eggs, 1 cup buttermilk and 1/4 cup vegetable oil. This is the best yellow cake recipe I have come across. I did make some changes, but all the credit goes to Dave!! He gave us all a great foundation to build upon!!!

This cake was great! I've made it 3 times now (4th is in the oven). The first and second times I made it it came out absolutely perfect. I followed the directions exactly as written (except I had to make my own cake flour so I did that while the butter and sugar creamed).

The third time I made it I only had 7 eggs on hand and didn't feel like running to the store so I did 6 egg yolks and 1 whole egg. The cake was a huge hit and everyone said they liked it better than the original recipe! The other thing I did differently was 2tsp of vanilla instead of 1.5tsp. I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a good yellow cake that is light, fluffy, flavorful, and tastes great whether you like to eat it plain or frost it!

This was a lovely traditional yellow layer cake and worked well with the classic recipe from Hershey's cocoa for chocolate frosting. I might try mixing in a package of vanilla pudding next time just to moisten it a bit, but it was great served with ice cream!!

I think I first tried making a yellow cake about 30 years ago. Fail. Every few years, I'd try a new recipe. Fail. So yellow cake was the one cake I never made. This one was moist  and super fluffy, neither too dense nor too airy. You really have to make sure the butter and sugar are creamed - volume should be nearly double and color should be almost white. I mixed in a Kitchenaid stand mixer at speed 6 for 5-6 mins. I did find the cake to be too sweet though. I used a 9x13 pan and  tapped the cake - gently, I thought - to check doneness after 25 mins because it seemed to be browning, and it deflated a bit where I tapped it. Next time, I'll go with the toothpick test.  I'm just excited that there will be a next time!

Like all of the negative reviews say this leans more toward a cornbread than a cake. The texture is very dry and crumbly and the taste is ok. I saw the positive reviews saying that this is how cake from scratch is supposed to be and box cake is only moist because of the chemicals and additives. WRONG! And honestly should tell you right there not to use this recipe because even the most positive review says it's dry and crumbly. It is not the inherent texture of from scratch cake. Just the sheer amount of egg yolks required shows that even David knew this was a dry cake, which is why he tries to compensate with a ridiculous amount of fat to try and get it more moist, but unfortunately in the end it does not give you that moist deliciousness that makes a cake a cake.

After trying numerous yellow cake recipes and coming out with dry cake, tried this one, and it's a winner!  Made 2 changes.  Per another reviewers recommendation, I used 4 egg yolks and 2 eggs.  I made my own cake flour by removing 1 Tbs per cup of flour and adding 1 Tbs cornstarch per cup.  Really turned out great!

It is a great recipe and made my house smell so good. To me it's more like a pound cake and I'm glad I baked it in a bunt pan. I also used a chocolate glaze I found on here. I'll will be making it again. P. S one thing that sucks.  What can you do with the egg whites.  If you don't have any use for them in the next few days.

I followed the recipe exactly except I made my cake flour with cornstarch and I baked it in 9 inch pans, which I didn't notice was a requirement (and why my cakes were a little short). It was super moist when I tried the top I leveled off. It seemed drier later when it was set out to share, but it was uncovered while cut for awhile. I will be making this again. As a progressing baker, I just can't do boxed anything anymore.

This is a very good recipe. I made this for my daughter's birthday: 2, 9-inch cakes, baked at 330 for about 20 minutes until very light golden brown. They weren't dry at all. 

My only complaint is that it didn't really have much flavor.  I never mess with a recipe the first time around but I think next time I will add a bit more vanilla. 

Thanks for sharing the recipe and comments!

I can't believe some of the reviews saying the cake is dry and like corn bread. Must be baking it way to long. This cake is perfect. Came out very moist. The only thing I did different was make my own cake flour instead of buying. Will make again for sure.

This came out moist and tasty and sweet. I made it in a 9x13 glass pan and cooked for 30 min. I took it out even though I was worried it was not done because I read the other reviewers' warnings about over-baking. I did not have enough cake flour so I used maybe 1/4 cup all purpose to get to 2 cups. Also I had no milk so I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and water to make 3/4 cup. Very good - I will use this recipe again when I make yellow cake.

I have made this cake three times.  I have made it for birthdays every time, and everyone goes nuts for it.  I am not sure what to tell the negative reviewers.  When you bake, your butter and milk should be at room temp.  It is really critical to cream the butter and sugar together until it is really smooth.  This may take a lot longer than what is in the recipe depending on your mixer and the temperature of your butter.   I would imagine it is also critical to use baking powder and not baking soda for those who said it was flat.  For those that complained of a cornbread consistency, you may have overmixed it after you were adding the flour and milk.  You almost can't overmix it when you are creaming the butter and sugar, but when you add the flour and milk, you may want to do that part by hand and only mix until just combined as it states in the recipe.  If you use all of the correct ingredients, follow the instructions, don't overmix it and bake at the correct temperature you should be rewarded with the most amazing yellow cake you have ever tasted.

We ended using four egg yolks and two whole eggs because that's what we had and WOW! This will be in the rotation for my husband's birthday again. I was "assisting" my 12 yo and it turned out great. He is so proud. So am I!

I have made this cake three times now, trying to get a perfect cake.  I read through many reviews and tried some peoples' advice, and my third try gave me a great cake!  For my first cake, I followed the initial recipe to a T.  I agree with several other people that it was dry.  It turned out dry and dense.  Cake #2 was better, I took someone's advice and did buttermilk.  In cake #2 I used an extra teaspoon of baking powder, 3 whole eggs and 5 yolks, and a cup of buttermilk.  Better, but still a bit dry and dense.  My husband raved about cake #3 and said he liked it better than our wedding cake! My changes were: 9 egg yolks, 3 1/4 tsp baking powder and a little over 1 1/4 c buttermilk.  Turned out moist and not dense! Only problem was it stuck to the pan trying to get it out.  Maybe I didn't spray it well enough.

5 stars all the way. Flavor and texture were very good. I made this as one of the layers for a birthday cake for a friend. She said it was the best cake she'd ever had. I used whole milk and Kerrygold butter, both of which I'm sure was an  asset.

For anyone who's wondering,yes,humidity does affect baking.If your cake turns out dry,it might be because of where you are and the humidity.If i were you,i would look up some ways to help control the humidity in your kitchen so you can find a way to make the cake less dry or whatever the problem might be.

This was so so so good! Two thumbs up from us. I used 4 whole eggs instead of egg whites and all purpose flour instead of cake flour. Perfectly moist!

This yellow cake recipe is GREAT!  I followed the advice of Teresa and because I like vanilla so much I added 2 teaspoons to the recipe instead of 1 1/2 teaspoons.  Also I made cupcakes instead of cake.  The recipe made about 2 1/2 dozen cupcakes.  I will definitely keep this recipe as my "go to" yellow cake! :)

The flavor is ok,  but I have never had a cake that was more heavy, and dense.  They texture was more like very dense, sweet cornbread.

Whoever is rating this recipe  low needs to figure out what he/she did wrong.  This is the BEST yellow cake that I've ever eaten.  It isn't dry and doesn't taste like cornbread......very moist.  Now I know what to do with my leftover egg yolks.   Thanks David!

Loved it! Cake came together really well, and tasted delicious. I only had AP flour, so I took out 2 tb flour and subbed in 2 tb cornstarch. Make sure to double sift the flour. Also, remember to start and end with the flour when adding to the mixture (flour in thirds, milk in half). When creaming the butter and sugar, use the whisk attachment, and whip the butter until very, very fluffy (around 5 min).

Lastly, tap the pans a couple times before putting in the oven to remove air bubbles and ensure even baking. This cake also bakes in a shorter amount of time, and to a lighter color than you think. Keep an eye on it!

I made a nice cream cheese frosting, and filled the cake with plenty of raspberries and blueberries. Yum!

Wonderful recipe! I used this to make cupcakes for a birthday last minute at 3am. In my tired state, I forgot to add the baking powder and only realized once I'd spooned all the batter in the cupcake liners. So I spooned the batter out of the liners and back into the bowl, mixed in the baking powder, re-filled with new liners, and popped them in the oven convinced they would turn out terrible due to overmixing. 

Even despite my mistake, they came out great! Moist, tender, and surprisingly light+ fluffy. Good flavour too, despite my skepticism over the number of yolks and the small amount of vanilla. The only change I made was adding a scant 1/4 cup of canola oil. Perhaps this extra addition of fat is what prevented the cornbread-like texture some other reviewers are complaining about. Though I'm unsure if the oil only worked because the batter was baked into cupcakes-- it may cause a large cake to sink.

I made this at my brother's house to celebrate my sister-in-law's birthday.  My cake layers sank a bit in the middle but it could have been due to their oven. It tasted delicious!  I frosted it with browned butter icing and drizzled the edges with dulce de leche homemade topping.

I followed this as a half-recipe to make cupcakes, and baked only for 20 minutes due to difference in proportions of cupcake vs cake pans. This cake recipe was phenomenal! My fiancé absolutely loves yellow cake with mocha buttercream frosting, and this was her favorite birthday (cup)cake yet! They turned out lightly crisped around the tins and extremely moist and decadent inside.

I'll make this again and prob give it 5 stars, but it was way too sweet in my opinion.  I'll cut the sugar to 1 cup. Very moist and tasty though. I'm sure the high amount of butter and egg yolks is key!

The best cake I've ever make.  I watched the video and did everything exactly.  Not like cornbread at all.  (maybe if you overbake it would get dry)  Anyway,  by chance I came across the same exact  1 star rating two times by Evan81 one posted in 2001 and the other posted in 2003.  Beginning to think some of these ratings are suspect.

Made this today and it came out wonderfully. For those of you  not as successful here are some thoughts. Don't over-cream your butter, and sugar. Butter should be at about 42-44 degrees to start. Cream butter for about 60 seconds, then slowly add sugar. Mix on medium for 2-3 minutes. When adding the dry ingredients don't over mix. Just enough so you don't see signs of flour in the batter. Finish by folding the batter together with a spatula. Don't over bake, and it should come out fine.

When I made this the batter was very thick, almost icing like.  So, I was surprised when I checked on it twenty minutes in that the batter had bubbled up and spilled over the sides of the pan.  So much so that it was dripping off of the cookie try I had placed under the baking pan onto the stove .  I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I used cake flour, creamed with the Kitchen aid.  I haven't assembled the cake yet but I've taste tested spillage and it tastes great.  Just something to be careful of!

This cake, though tastes great, was rather dry :( I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed when it didn't cut moist when we sliced it. Perhaps if it had some oil in the recipe?

Very easy to follow directions but I'm surprised that the cake was less moist that I expected. The flavor is excellent and I would make it again but must figure out how to increase it moisture. If anyone has an idea I would love to hear your opinion.

I saw so many great reviews for this yellow cake recipes, but my boyfriend and I didn't enjoy this cake very much. It turned out too dense for my liking. May try making it again at some point.

I loved the flavor of the cake.  Doesn't need icing either.  It was great.  The only problem is that it just fell apart.  Thank goodness I didn't have to frost it.  I tried the flavor to make a cake for  my grandson's birthday .  Any ideas to stop it from falling apart?

This is a very good recipe for yellow cake. I followed another reviewer and used 3 whole eggs and 5 yolks. I think i mixed it a bit much as the texture was more solid than crumbly but very good flavor. I was out of cake flour so used all purpose if that made some difference.

Next time i will use the 8 egg yolks and then post another review.

My daughter was asked to make cupcakes for a graduation party.  We decided to risk it and try a brand new recipe for a major order.  I'm so glad we did.  These were so light and fluffy.  We'll definitely make again.  We made them as mini cupcakes and baked them for 12 minutes.

I made this cake as per instructions. I thought it was very good, but maybe a little too rich and heavy, more like a pound cake. The second time, I made it as directed except for the last egg, I didn't use just the yolk, but the whole egg. I liked this even better. Most yellow cakes use 2-4 whole eggs. I think in the future I'll experiment with more whole eggs, maybe one or two less yolks. But it is excellent as is!

This recipe is almost identical to Dominican Bizcocho, except the milk is substituted with orange juice. I made this with half milk and half buttermilk because I ran out of milk. It came out great, nice crumb and moist.  Nice easy recipe that goes great with chocolate buttercream..yum!

This is my second time making this cake and it is amazing,  light, fluffy and moist.  I did take the advice of some other reviews and added 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs which I think just gives it a little more moisture.  I added mini chocolate chips the second time around for my daughter's birthday.  They made great cupcakes with baking for about 18-20 minutes.  I will keep this as my go to yellow cake recipe.

Made this for my wife's birthday. It was my first attempt ever at making a cake, and it came out perfect! I used four whole eggs, in place of the yolks. If you are making a three-layer cake (as I had planned to), you will need to double the recipe. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

Well this was my 1st attempt at a cake made from scratch, it was just ok and my family agreed.  They common criticism was that it was dry. 
I baked it for 25 minutes and check it, the toothpick didn't come out clean, so I baked it for an additional 2 minutes.  The middles of cakes sink down a little bit and the cake was spongy to the touch.  I let them cool for 15 minutes and removed them from the pans and set them on was paper to cool on a cooking rack.  The texture was crumbly like a cornbread like other reviewers also stated on my cake as well.

Eight egg yolks and one cup of butter should have made this cake spectacular I thought, but it wasn't.  Yes, I followed the recipe exactly.  I have never used a cake mix.  Maybe I just don't like yellow cake.

Here's a Tip! Add vanilla pudding mix! It's a life saver and it comes out moist. I also added a little sour cream and sum Malibu rum in mines. Overall this is the best cake I ever made and tried in my life.

This is the best vanilla cake I've ever made. I was skeptical at first because of the egg yolks required and not the whole egg but this is a moist tasty cake.

I didn't have milk I had heavy cream and it still came out good.

No changes and I will make again.  After looking at other reviews.  Suggestion to those who talked about oily or  flat  crumbly cakes.   My guess the problem is in the creaming of the butter and sugar.  If the butter is to hard you will get flat crumbly cake.  If you use melty butter ( try to soften in microwave) you can get oily cakes.  Here is a very good primer on the subject.

I made this exactly as directed. The cakes where flat but tasted ok. I was disappointed. Next time I'll read reviews and hopefully it will come out fluffier not so solid.

cake made from scratch to the world if i might add. and this recipe did it total justice, moist, and delicious. so if anyone got it wrong like someone said guess they are to used to box cake. I actually made an upside down pineapple cake for my girls with this, just substitute milk for juice. and cut the recipe in half. maybe next time ill do a two layer

I have made this cake a number of times , and it's always a bit. So moist, you don't need icing. Great with fruit.  Sometimes I only use the yolks, sometimes four whole eggs, but I follow the recipe exact and it's perfect every time!

So.....necessity and the reviews required I change a couple of things. 8 egg yolks? Couldn't do. Four eggs? Yes. One at a time. 2 cups cake flour? Couldn't do. 2 cups ap flour? Yes. Also, I add extra vanilla to almost everything....I think its the secret to go from good to delicious, so I used almost 2T. Lastly, I no longer have a mixer. I just have a couple of sad whisks. And this is not a thin substance, starting with trying to cream any butter by hand. And I know you " need air, keep whipping it, get it fluffy". Needless to say, all stages of my mix were less than their fluffiest, and the cake still came out great. Great being light, moist, crumbly fluffy. NOT dense. Cook time? Set the timer for 22 minutes, then kept checking it. Idk if I had 8in or 9in metal pans, but my five yr old "greased" them with cooking spray.....still came out great. ...except the couple of shells she dropped in.

***update****
Just made it again! Still awesome! BETTER than a yellow box mix.....made one recipe. So dosappointimg i almost cried. This???? Fantastic. Still used ap flour and four whole eggs and 2T instead of t vanilla. Mwah! Pointers though.....this time i didnt run the eggs under hot water as long (which turns cold eggs to room temperature) and i noticed on eggs 3 and 4, it started turning the butter cold, trying to separate. But i beat it. Also, idk why he didnt say, but room temp butter. I used salted. Ill post another pic soon....2yr old birthday. So glad i didnt break down and buy

Each time I make a cake, I learn a new (painful) lesson. This cake is not cornbread!!! However I think I pinpointed what is going on with this yellow cake recipe. My cake outcome was a very, very pale yellow extremely fine-textured somewhat moist cake.  It was closer to a typical wedding cake texture than a moist, more robust sponge-y cake.  My husband accurately compared the outcome to an Angel Food cake. Not over baked and I used 2 whole eggs and 4 yolks. I also used a blend of whole milk and homemade milk kefir (like buttermilk). The cake's texture has everything to do with FLOUR!!!! 
If you like a really moist sponge-y cake with larger air bubbles then DO NOT USE CAKE FLOUR. USE ALL PURPOSE flour! I spent a couple hours last night learning about affect of different flours on cake texture. BOTTOM LINE: Cake flour yields the most fluffy, tallest and driest crumbly cake. It will make the finest and driest texture (hello 4 stars).  ALL-PURPOSE will not rise as quite as tall, but it will have nice airy bubbles and it will be more MOIST.  Don't know if I will get a sponge-y yellow cake using AP but I might try this recipe again with that switch. 
FYI: All cake flour (except for unbleached King Arthur cake flour) is bleached using nasty chemicals that some tastebuds may detect as a subtle chlorine-flavor to the cake....mmmm yummy.  
TIP: You can make cake flour: Just substitute 2 Tbsp cornstarch or potato starch for each cup (16 tbsp) of unbleached AP flour.

I made it with skim milk. It came out a little dry.
I'll try it again with whole milk.

I made an account here purely to rate this.

My partner is fanatical about yellow cake with chocolate frosting, but I wanted to do something better than a box mix for his birthday- They never fail to taste like a box mix, and have iffy ingredients.

This was perfect. Just sweet enough, fluffy, and completely delicious. Nothing remotely "cornbread" about it- this is absolutely yellow cake as it is meant to be!

I followed the directions with no changes. It's really on point, as is. This will be my go to yellow cake- no more box mix for us!

The cake is dense. I used cake flour, because it's lighter and tends to be less dense. I was surprised by the density. The flavor is great. The cake is not dry but it is not spongy like a boxed cake. I am going to make it again using some of the suggestions of others...I will use whole eggs as an equivalent for the egg yolk-only ingredient. I also plan to bake it a little less than stated to see if that adds any moisture.

I have made David's yellow cake more times than I can count! It is my go-to recipe for yellow cake. I and my whole family loves this cake!  In particular, I really appreciate that the cake calls for butter and not vegetable oil. Simply delicious!

I have been looking and looking and looking for a good scratch butter cake recipe.  This is it!  I made a few minor changes.  Instead of 8 yolks, I used 4 yolks and 2 whole eggs.  I also added a tbsp of vinegar to the milk.  This cake has a beautiful moist crumb, and rises so evenly.  For those that had trouble with texture, make sure you cream the butter well and mix throughly with the addition of the eggs.  Also be sure your eggs and milk are room temp, never bake cakes with cold eggs/milk!

I will never go back to boxed cake mixes again. This cake was fabulous!! It didn't taste eggy at all, and if you follow the instructions carefully, it comes out super moist. This was my first time baking a cake from scratch, so that says a lot. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was a tad sweeter than I would have liked. I might play around with adding less sugar next time, though my husband says its perfect the way it is. Thank you for this awesome recipe!!!

This is the way I remember my Grandmas yellow cake tasting. Even licking the spoon, I felt like a kid again. And when you taste the batter, (and you know you will), it tastes so much better than a box mix. I baked this for a group of hard working men and had them taste the batter before I baked it, so they could appreciate the difference,  never having home made before. I poured half the batter in a 9x13 pan and baked for 8 min. then chopped several small snickers candy bars and spread those on top of the baked batter then poured the rest of the batter and finished baking. I topped it off with a delicious creamy peanut butter frosting! YUM!!

I didn't have enough white sugar so I used 3/4 c white sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar and it turned out great! So moist and has a rich buttery taste. Best homemade yellow cake I've had!

I do a lot of baking and have been trying a new yellow cake recipe each trying to find "THE ONE".  This most certainly is not it.  Did not rise well and was so greasy there was no way I could have used it for decorating.  The flavour was good.  We ate most of it with no frosting.  This has gone into my tried and tossed list!

This is an "eggcelent" recipe. I say it that way because the egg taste was a bit too strong.  I would've preferred a more buttery flavor. Mine came out a bit too crumbly. It was plenty moist. Not very complicated to make, either. It came out more brown than I would have liked, but it wasn't springing back. The toothpick came out clean, so I should've trusted that over the springing back method. I used the following ingredients: Butter - Land O'Lakes unsalted; Cake Flour - Swan's; Vanilla - Nielsen-Massey.  I posted a photo of it in my photos. Give it a try!

Used this for my daughters first birthday it turned out great! I did make adjustments for high altitude by adding 1/4 cup of flour and milk and decreasing the sugar by 1/4 cup. I also used four whole eggs because I didn't have eight for the yolks.

I made cupcakes from this recipe, adjusted for high altitude.  I'm not sure what went wrong for all of the negative reviewers, but I thought the taste and texture were both excellent.  I frosted with a Nutella cream cheese frosting, and that put the cupcakes over the top.  Yummy!

Turned out great!  I baked 28 minutes. Made it for my husband's birthday and he loved it. I even ended up using about 1/2 cup whole grain flour since I had that mixed into my all-purpose flour. Came out soft and fluffy.

Wow I'd give this recipe 100 stars if I could! Have tried many recipes for yellow cake and have been disappointed every time. This is bar none the best yellow cake ever! I followed the recipe exactly except for the cream butter and sugar method. I mixed only slightly softened butter for 60 seconds before I added sugar. I never knew that you could actually over cream your butter and sugar resulting in a tough cake. Full instructions for creaming butter and sugar on crafty baking.com. Thank you sooooo much David!!

This cake is completely delicious. The only complaint i had was it came out way to dry and crumbly. I added 5 caps (yes i filled the cap) of veggie oil to the recipe, and this came out moist and delicious and yummm....used it for cupcakes with an eggless cookie dough frosting for a girls slumber party....thanks to this cake recipe I was a hero!

Really, really good.  Very moist, followed the instructions exactly and the cake came right out of the pan cleanly which I always appreciate.  I used this recipe to make a minion cake for my son's birthday and he loved it.

I love this recipe! Instead of frosting, I whipped some heavy cream, vanilla, & sugar and mixed it with freshly-chopped pineapple and spread the luscious mixture in between the cakes. No dryness detected! I wish i could share the picture. It's  long gone!

I was a little nervous to try this recipe after reading many negative reviews about it tasting like dry cornbread but I followed Naples advice and this cake came out fantastic.  I was very pleased that this cake turned out very moist and fluffy and absolutely delicious!

I had 8 yolks left over from Swiss meringue buttercream and just had to try this recipe. I baked it into 24 cupcakes at 375 for about 18 minutes. They started to sink a bit when I took them out of the oven, so I was worried they would be a mess. However, they turned out to hold up fine. The main point is, this is THE BEST vanilla/yellow cake I've ever tasted. It's so moist that it kicks cake mix out of the ballgame. The taste is truly buttery, yellow cake.

Excellent flavor but too dry for my taste.  I even took it out of the oven early when there was still some liquidy dough on the knife.

Great recipe! I think I mixed mine too long in the last step (helps to read ahead and know what you're doing), or perhaps it was the handful of cherries I added that made this actually too moist. Of course that was my fault though-the recipe is perfect.

Moist and delicious, but denser than I expected... I measured in metric, creamed the heck outta that butter, and mixed the flour sparingly, but somehow it still came out too dense.
I'll try again, maybe with newer baking powder?

I love yellow cake, so this was my first attempt at making it from scratch.
The texture was perfect and it was soft and moist. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is I think the recipe calls for too much salt. The flavor was very good, yet there was a distinct salty flavor with it. Maybe it is supposed to be like that, but I didn't like it. I'll either half the salt next time or eliminate it all together. The person I made it for had no complaints at all and loved it.

The batter was wonderful (yes I tasted it). I checked after 20 minutes and it was spilling over the sides and all over my oven. I used two 8" pans.

Hubby loved the taste. I was unhappy with the appearance. My cake also caved in the center. I followed the recipe to a T. I creamed my butter and sugar over 5 minutes in my stand mixer to ensure a fluffy peak. I did not deviate from the instructed 8 egg yolks and wonder if that is the reason for the cave.

I made sure everything was beaten well and added corn starch 2tbsp in place of 2tbsp flour and this turned out great. I made cupcakes with them and frosted with Rocks special frosting and they were great.

Taste was great. But I overbaked this cake. One minute the toothpick was 'goopy,' and literally the next minute the cake was overdone. Disappointed, since the cake took a LOT of time and effort.

I followed the recipe to a T and really creamed my butter and sugar well. This cake came out very dense and a bit dry. I did like the flavor but not the texture. For all the work of separating 8 eggs just for the yolks I just don't think it was worth the effort.

This is hands down the best yellow cake recipe I've ever tried. I have made it several times and it's always great. If you follow the directions precisely and are sure not to overwork the flour, it will come out moist and delicate. The only problem I have with this recipe is that I can't seem to find the right frosting to go with it. It has such a great, light flavor, and I feel like all the frostings I have tried have overwhelmed its flavor. I've considered serving it with just a dusting of confectioners sugar.

This is absolutely the perfect yellow layer cake recipe.  It bakes up perfect level layers, handles easily, cuts easily without crumbling and has the perfect level of moistness.  Everyone raved about it....thank you!  I will never use another recipe.

Made this tonight. In a 6 inch pan for a cake. Batter is great and the overall taste of the cake came out great! It took about 45 mins and yet it sunk in the middle. Not sure why. Maybe I'll do 6-7 egg yolks instead next time.

This recipe is exquisite! The best yellow cake I've had- hands down. I made it for my fiance's birthday and he hasn't stopped raving. I didn't have enough eggs so I used 4 whole eggs instead of 8 yolks- worked out great. Moist and fluffy and so flavorful- even at high altitude.

I was looking for a yellow cake because another recipe I wanted to use called for a boxed mix and I really hate those.    So while making a "honey bun" cake I used this recipe and it made  a fantastically moist and light cake .  This is my go to base recipe from now on!  Excellent!

This recipe was so delicious.  I'm a frosting kind of girl.  I could eat spoonfuls of frosting and just leave the cake.  Not with this cake! I haven't even frosted it yet, but I tried a little bit of the cake by itself. I could eat the whole thing by itself-even sans frosting! It didn't turn out dry at all.  This one is a keeper!

This Cake was AMAZING!!!  ITS the best! i read most of the other reviews and made some changes.
1) i sifted the flour mixture twice
2) instead of 8 yolks i used 3 eggs (whites and yolks ) and added 2 yolks so i only needed 5 eggs instead 8.
3)i mixed the flour and milk in 3 additions starting and ending with the flour.
4) i didn't have any cake flour so i minuses per cup 2 table spoons of flour and added 2 tbsp of corn flour
 the cake was amazing  and i even made cupcakes with them

I own the Wilton teddy bear cake pan.  I searched for a recipe for it. I found lots of decoration tips and instruction but no recipe for a cake. I found a table for how much cake batter to use: enough for two 8 in pans.  So, I tried this recipe.  I cooked for 30 min because the middle was quite soft. I also used the convection feature after 20 min. It came out great.  Followed the recipe just as written. Tastes great, too.

Made this cake yesterday for our anniversary. ..it was amazing! Thick without being too dense, chewy without being too spongy and very, very moist. If yours turned out like cornbread,  IDK what you're doing wrong but I followed recipe exactly and cake was great.  Used canned frosting to save a step...next time,  I'll make my own, this cake deserves it.

I let the butter and eggs come to room temp. I whipped the butter and sugar quite a bit. Added the egg yokes one at a time and whipped that quite a bit as well. Sifted the dry ingredients 3 times and added them alternately with the milk with my kitchenaid on stir. Turned out great as cupcakes. Baked roughly 15 minutes. Thanks!!

I used this recipe for my up-side-down pineapple cherry cake and it is AMAZING!
Two changes I made... 1- increased milk to 1 cup and 2- I baked for 75 minutes!

If you want a super moist yellow cake look no further. It's super delicious, soft and moist. It doesn't taste eggy the flavors are very balanced and perfect. I followed the recipe to the t except I used regular flour since I didn't have cake flour if you do that remember to omit 2 tbsp flour for each cup of flour.  Believe me this is a keeper recipe.

This turned out great! My daughter is allergic to soy so we can't use the mixes. I tried this out for her birthday cupcakes and paired it with a meringue buttercream frosting and I didn't want to stop eating it. I followed the recipe exactly (I may have added just a splash extra milk) and then stuck the cupcakes in the freezer overnight. I frosted them the next day and we have our new favorite cake recipe!

I have searched far and wide for the perfect yellow cake recipe and after many years if trial and error I have found this is the only one that is perfect. Don't hesitate to try out the recipe. I am so glad I did.

Just made this recipe and it was AMAZING!  Followed directions exactly for batter but made cupcakes.  They baked for about 20 minutes.  My 3 year old who usually only licks the frosting off of cake ate 2 of them before we could even frost them.  I will use this recipe again and again.

The ONLY reason I am giving this cake recipe four stars instead of five is due to my modification of the recipe. I did not want to waste eight egg whites. I wouldn't have used them for anything, so I decided to substitute four duck eggs for the eight egg yolks. Cake turned out amazing. It's very sweet and moist. Will definitely use this recipe over and over, with the simple egg switch.

This cake is awesome! Iit is a foolproof recipe. I think it is key cream together the butter and sugar very well. It may take 5 minutes for it to get light and fluffy. I also used for whole eggs as another reviewer said and it turned out perfect. I added a thin layer of raspberry jam in between each layer of cake and it was awesome! Everyone at my daughters 1st birthday love it.

Other than my Grandma's pound cake, this is the only cake I make. Sweet, moist, rich and delicious enough to eat right out of the pan without frosting, though it is fabulous with chocolate buttercream frosting.

This recipe is a keeper! I have tried several different cake recipes and have never been successful . They are either too dense or too dry. This cake turned out great! My husband loved his birthday cake and my kids were impressed that I made it from scratch. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This cake was sooo dry. So close to cornbread just like other reviews mentioned. Even though the cake was not a huge hit, I would still choose this cake over a store bought cake filled with ingredients you cannot pronounce!

My auntie is an amazing cook/baker. She doesn't like yellow cake or sweets that much, but she LOVED this. I made substitutions based off Theresa's review, so I used 1 1/4c. buttermilk instead of milk, and used 5 eggs total, 3 eggs + 2 egg yolks only.

This is a great yellow cake recipe!  Just make sure you beat the butter and sugar so that they are nice and fluffy before you add the egg yolks (one at a time).  Mine came out fluffy, buttery-tasting, and delicious!

I loved this cake! it was so moist and delicious. I didn't have cake flour so I made some with cornstarch and flour. The key to this recipe is you have to whip all the ingredients really well to make it a fluffy cake.

I have been looking for something better than boxed cake and this is the second recipe that I have tried. I will be ending my search here. I can't even describe how good this cake was. If you follow the directions exactly, and as naples34102 suggested, this cake will turn out perfectly. Make sure you beat the  out of the butter and sugar and cake flour is very important. It was much lighter and fluffier than the first cake recipe I found. 

I halved the recipe so I could just make a single 8 inch cake. I have been looking for a good cake for Boston Cream, so one is all I needed. 

Thank you so much for this recipe! It was wonderful and I will be using this many more times!

This recipe was recommended to me by my best friend and she didn't let me down.  The only thing I did different was made a two layer cake and added banana pudding in the middle.  Everyone loved it.  It will be my go to cake.  Easy to make and good to eat.  :-)

I searched online for a yellow cake to bake for my daughter's birthday.  So glad I found this right away. My family loved it. One person said it reminded them of a famous bakery pound cake that folks love around here. It sure beats boxed cake, and I enjoy making things from scratch. I made my own cake flour, which was easy to do. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

I loved the recipe! This is my first cake, and it came out really well. I substituted the white floor Edith whole grain floor and sugar substitute! Perfect! Although there were too many eggs and I only used 4. Still perfect!

I love this recipe. I have always been one to use a box mix, but now that I have this recipe, it's my go to birthday cake.  It's super easy and very tasty. I often add chocolate chips for something a little special. It's always a challenge to use the leftover whites, but I discovered a meringue frosting that uses a couple.

I baked this twice in a row. One full recipe and one half. The cakes for the full recipe came out very flat and one of them lumpy. It could have been from my brother using an electric mixer, or from buttering the pans rather than oiling them. I made the third layer alone to give the cake more height, since the cake seems fine other than being flat. I ran out of butter and used oil to grease the pan, and hand mixed only since my brother was sick of baking lol. The third layer is properly sized, and came out perfectly flat, unlike the other cakes. I don't know what made the difference, but it came out much better, although slightly less yellow around the sides?

I have tried many cake recipes and this is my favorite! People ask me for the recipe! I found that using only 1 cup of sugar rather than 1 and a half gives it just the right amount of sweetness! Its moist and delicious?

It tastes pretty good, not doubt about it but I must warn that it does taste very similar to just buying yellow cake straight from the box at store. Making it from scratch just taste slightly but I mean SLIGHTLY freshier compared to getting it from the box. I'm sorry, but I'm sticking with the one in the box since the taste is so similar to me can't tell the difference all too much but I still had fun making it and everyone enjoyed it so it was not a waste of time.

Amazing! I made as directed into cupcakes for a birthday party, everyone loved them. Better than Wegmans bakery, which is saving a lot. I topped them with a popular buttercream from this site. Thanks for my new favored cupcake recipe!

I made the recipe exactly as it was written and I was very disappointed.  Even after greasing and flouring the pan, the 
cake stuck to the pan and the texture was bread like.  The taste
was OK.  I would not make it again without a lot of modifications.

No changes were made at all! This cakes was fabulous as is! Thank you David! If using a darker coated pan reduce to 325 and start checking for doneness at 25-27 minutes...(my bottom layer was a bit browner however still same moistness because I forgot you are supposed to account for the dark coated pan. My top layer came out perfect when I adjusted the temp...

Just made this last night for an ice cream cake I am making for my son. Being pregnant, I decided to sample a chunk, as who could resist, and omg. The cake practically melted in my mouth it was so moist and delicious. Hope it doesn't dry out in the freezer.

This is a wonderful yellow cake recipe. My family raved about it and this my go to yellow cake recipe. Before I made this I had only had box mix yellow cake and didn't really like it because the flavor was so blah. Not this recipe! I followed the directions exactly and watched the timing closely. It came out moist, rich and flavorful. Definitely not cornbread!

Followed directions turned out wonderful! I did make a mistake by using a dark pan and not adjusting the heat down a bit. SO thats on me. It came out a bit dryer than I would have liked but like I said, on me. Its IMPORTANT to use cake flour and NOT OVER BEAT!! Good job David!

I'm usually a scratch pound cake person, but I decided I needed to branch out and do something I little different. So, I selected this for a birthday cake and it was great. I'm not a pro baker by any means so I followed the receipe exactly and took the most common advise I saw in the comments and it turned out great! I think I left it in the oven a couple minutes too long, but that's user error, not the receipe. This will become a permanent recipe I'll use going forward. TRY IT.

My father-in-law's favorite cake is yellow cake with chocolate frosting, so I made this and topped it with the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site.  The cake was amazing.  Very moist and so much better than a box mix!  This is now my go-to yellow cake recipe.

I did not think the flavor was all that great and the texture was dense in a rather unpleasant way.  It WAS a little like corn bread!  I was very careful to measure and follow all the directions, so I really think the problem was with the recipe.  I made sure to not over bake, too.  I wouldn't have been voted the Next Great Cake Boss with this cake.

Delicious!  I didn't have cake flour so substituted 3/4c all purpose flour and 2T corn starch.  Followed advice and made sure and beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

Made this for my hubby for his birthday and it was AMAZING!!! Neither of us had ever had non boxed yellow cake before.... And considering yellow cake is his favorite.... This will be made every year for his birthday :)

It was very moist and flavorful. I didn't have cake flour so I reduced the flour by 4tbsp (2 per cup) and all turned out well. This will def be my go to cake for parties and what not.... So glad I found this!

This is a perfect foil for chocolate icing or strawberries and cream. It's very important to follow the instructions exactly and be VERY careful not to overcook. I agree with the reviewer who said that this cake overbaked has the consistency of cornbread.

I slightly over baked at had a donut like taste/texture. It was good, but not quite what I was looking for.

This is a delicious, moist, classic, homemade cake similar to that which you would find in really old (hard to find these days) church collection recipe books. It's a home baked cake not a box mix, so it's going to taste real, it's quite amazing and my husband loved it...he's from Germany and knows real baking. This is my go to cake recipe. Take your time and do it right, follow it to the T and don't worry about it, it will work out...love this! All these changes, lol..chill ladies it's a fine cake the way it is.

This was pretty much a fail. The cake completely fell. The taste of the cake was great, but for some reason it fell. We baked a chocolate cake in the other oven while this one was baking, and that came out perfect. Not likely to try this again.

I have searched many years for the perfect yellow cake recipe and I finally found it! This is the best yellow cake recipe! It comes out perfect and flavorful every time. I now use the same recipe for my basic muffin batter, but I replace cake flour with all purpose to yield a more dense consistency. This should be everyone's go to recipe for yellow cake from scratch!

I joined Allrecipes just to rate this.  Best cake ever!  Before this, I had yet to find a cake that could compare to the moistness of box mix, and the ones that did were too eggy or not sweet enough.  This cake was flavorful, moist and amazing.  My husband, who is not a huge dessert fan, even raved about it.  I may never use cake mix again!  Just a caveat: the batter was much thicker than I expected, so much so I had to spread it out in the pan (and I only had 9-inch pans, so it didn't even go all the way to the edge), and I baked at 300 for closer to 45 minutes for a flatter cake…and it still turned out delicious and moist!  This really is a fantastic cake recipe and hard to screw up as long as you follow the instructions!

Honestly , one of THE best recipes for yellow cake. First time I made it and it turned out to be EXCELLENT . I did however have to add vanilla coffee creamer because I ran out of vanilla and I added a little cinnamon to the top of the cake to give it a little kick .

I made this tonight, pretty skeptical that it would turn out. I don't have a fantastic track record with yellow cakes. BUT, I followed this to a T and it is amazing: light, fluffy, moist. I won't ever use another yellow cake recipe again. Thank you for this!

I thought it was closer to a pound cake recipe I had tried before...i am NOT a professional in the food industry, just as plain ole' stay at home mom, but i strive to be awesome at it...especially when there is a birthday party. I tried this recipe for my husband's birthday party yesterday,  where there were lots of adults and children. Most of the kids ate it, but several didn't like it, and all the adults had some but when I cleaned up I noticed that not many people ate more than a couple bites.

I was apprehensive about this recipe, considering the astronomical differences in some of the reviews, but it turned out quite well! I think a lot of the inconsistencies in the way the recipe turns out depends on how you combine the ingredients. Unlike other cake recipes, this one doesn't specify which method to blend everything together! 

If you use a mixer to make the cake, it should incorporate enough air to get a super fluffy cake, more like that of a boxed mix. I combined everything by hand (no access to a mixer), and while the flavor was delicious, it was a bit more dense than I expected (more like a cross between a pound cake and a sponge cake). I haven't made a lot of cakes in my day, but this seems like the most obvious reason people might be having trouble (aside from weird oven temps or changing/bad ingredients).

All that aside, the flavor of this cake was delicious! Both the batter and the finished product had a nice, sweet vanilla taste without being overwhelming. I made a double layer cake, and added blackcurrant jam between the top and bottom layers, then topped the cake with dark chocolate ganache. It was a huge hit! My boyfriend, who hates yellow cake, even admitted it was the best one he's ever had!

I really hope that it is not a case of beginners luck but this cake turned out really good for me.  I had recently made 3 sugary "cornbread" cakes prior to trying this recipe which all ended up in the trash.  I was hesitant to try this recipe because of the 8 egg yolks which I felt was a bit much to waste if it didn't turn out right.  Even thought others mentioned using 4 whole eggs, I didn't want to alter the recipe. I followed the advice of many reviewers and sifted the cake flour baking power and salt twice, I beat the butter/sugar mixture for about 10 minutes, added each egg yolk one at a time and mixed it a little extra after adding the last egg. It actually turned out great.  I am thankful to the reviewer that indicated it is not a good idea to wait for the cake to turn brown.  It was done when it was a golden yellow color and I would have likely waited too long to test it without that advice.  I am going to try it again to make cupcakes for my kids birthday party next week and hope to get the same results.

This cake is simple to make and it tastes delicious! Exactly what I was looking for. I didn't have white sugar so I used brown. It tastes amazing. The kids loved it. Thanks for the recipe! I will use this again.

I do scratch baking for all my cookies but this is the first cake the I did from scratch.  I made muffins with the mix and I used 4 whole eggs instead and I also used some sugar stevia blend for part of the sugar that was called for.  I thought that the cake mix came out with a nice moist consistency and it was light and airy but the flavor I feel is very mild and almost like a corn bread or biscuit because it is not very sweet.  The cupcakes will work out because I put in an apple filing and made my frosting sweeter which made up for the lack of sweetness in the cake.  But if I didn't have a filling I don't think I would be able to disguise the fact that they kinda taste like corn bread

I generally always prefer a cake from scratch over a box mix, but not in this case.  This recipe came out eggy tasting, hard and kind of crunchy on the edges and not very pretty at all.  The only change I made was to use all purpose flour instead of cake flour, but I sifted it 3 times before using.  I would have given it just 2 stars, but the texture was light and fluffy (be sure to cream the butter & sugar for a long time if you want to use this recipe) but that's the only good thing. I can say about this recipe  I will frost with a caramel frosting to help make up for the eggy taste.  Using whole eggs may make the cake taste less like cornbread.  I thought I would never say this, but if you want a yellow cake...buy a butter recipe box mix instead of using this recipe!

This cake turned out perfect. I topped it with caramel and made a homemade caramel cake. It taste so much like a box cake. The first day it was okay but after a while it got better I guess the ingredients needed time to set in. I wonder if I can add cocoa powder to make a chocolate version of this cake.

wow wow wow. super impressed. The first time i made this it was whatever, kind of dry but good flavor. This time, I did the same thing, followed the recipe exactly. 


MEASURE the flour after it is sifted a few times and DON'T add more flour, even if there is some left and the batter may look reaaal creamy like. I guess that was the key to getting it to come out delicious and not dryish.
It came out AMAZING. Super light, fluffy, and just delicious.

What a wonderful yellow cake!!! I followed the directions to the letter, beginning and ending with adding the flour to the mix. Frosted this with chocolate buttercream frosting and my husband was very delighted with his birthday cake. Thanks for the recipe!!

I am very new to baking from scratch. I felt very apprehensive about this recipe because of the varied reviews, but I gave it a shot. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I subbed all purpose flour for cake flour. I thought the cake was fantastic- I experienced none of the issues with dryness that others have mentioned and I really liked the flavor. I thought it tasted just like a yellow cake should. This is a great recipe for bakers of any skill level!

Dude, your cake rocks! I followed your instructions to a tee and used the Hershey's recipe for chocolate frosting. It was for a birthday and less than one day later, there are only two slices left.....Hmmm, I see a family feud brewing. LOL! PS: Not that I would know, but it's great in the morning with a cup of coffee!

It is wonderful! Being it is apple season I added sliced apples on the bottom of the pan with melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.  It was one of the best apple cakes I have ever tasted.

This is a great and simple recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I had to sub in AP for cake flour.  For every cup of AP, I took away 2tbs of flour and added 2tbs of corn starch.  I would have preferred cake flour, but didn't have any on hand.  I also used a whisk to slowly stir in the flour/milk towards the end.  Overall, this is a perfect recipe.  It's the right amount of sugar, it is moist, and it's the right consistency for a cake.  Not at all like a box cake, with which I am very familiar.  Thanks, David!

Came out fine, may use it again.  I did use 4 whole eggs and had only AP flour so I did the cornstarch substitution mentioned by others.  All my cold ingredients reached room temp.  The cake was dense and sweet.  Using all that butter made my arteries quiver and I will probably try doing some alterations with apple sauce in the future.  What I heard from my family was: Yum, that was good, Thanks, mom, and from my critically honest friend- is that a different recipe (no praise). She thought I had used a different icing recipe and she didn't ask for seconds. But that might've been because her boyfriend who just lost 34 pounds and who had one bite was with her.  I'm hoping there is some left at my mom's so I can try some more today.

This review was meant for another cake...sorry my mistake!  But I do plan on trying this recipe soon.  Please disregard.   I made this for my sister's birthday and she loved it! I made it in a 10 inch cast iron skillet and had enough batter left over for 6 upside-down cupcakes.  Both the cake and cupcakes turned out beautiful, very nice presentation. :)

I had to make a couple of minor changes due to what I had on hand (AP flour vs. cake flour and 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs vs. 8 egg yolks), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I sort of goofed on the baking though (blonde moment-hope nobody gets offended! lol). The recipe's baking time is for 2 layer cake, I was using sheet cake and didn't know exact baking time for it so I set timer for 30 minutes and was going to just check it in 5 minute intervals, which I did. After 65 minutes I knew something wasn't right because it was still "jiggly" in the center and wet looking and I've never had a yellow cake take that long! I suddenly realized the oven no longer felt very hot. I looked at the control panel and suddenly realized I had turned the oven off at some point, most likely when the 30 minute timer went off! (Boy did I feel stupid-first time I ever pulled that one.) Anyway, I turned the oven back on, left the cake in the oven throughout the preheat (or reheat in this case) and 10 more minutes later it was done. After it had cooled I made a chocolate frosting recipe I found on this site. Bottom line-even after my screw-up with the oven, though it was initially a little dry, after about 24 hours it had moistened up a bit, and overall it was awesome! I bet it would have been even better with proper baking! Great recipe, no more box cakes for me except if absolutely necessary. Thanks!

Disclaimer: I didn't use cake flour, I substituted corn starch for some of the flour, but I followed the directions and watched the video

This cake tasted pretty good, however, I didn't find it to be exceedingly moist. It reminded me of a tastycake junior in taste and texture (If you're from the Philadelphia area I'm sure you're familiar.) My kids really enjoyed it. I can't say that I'll make it again because it was just good, not great and 8 eggs worth of cake needs to be outstanding.

Made this cake for my son's birthday. My son has egg and soy allergies so I had to use a vegan egg yolk replacer made of brewers yeast, and it still turned out amazing! Almost too moist. Can't wait to try it with real egg for my daughter's birthday!

I wasn't the biggest fan of this recipe. I tried a scaled down version of the recipe and I must say that it did not turn out that great. I followed the recipe to the T with the scaled down ingredients, but it did have more of a cornbreadish, pudding type of taste. A bit too moist. I will try it again and make sure I did not do something wrong, but so far I am not a fan.

I followed this recipe exactly. I worked side by side with my daughter making 2 batches at once. What a waste of a LOT of eggs. I also thought it came out tasting more like corn bread and with a horrible texture. Also, the cupcakes batch overflowed my cups and  made a huge mess in my oven in spite of only filling the cups 1/2 full. The cakes were very brown on top and a toothpick still came out with yuck on it. I was making these for my granddaughters birthday and they are a wash. A huge waste of time and money. I'm in Utah so maybe the altitude had something to do with it??? Try this one with caution.... Cake flour and eggs aren't the most expensive ingredients around, but still I hate to waste food. YUCK! I just want to cry!

This recipe certainly lived up to its ratings in my kitchen! I just made this for a friend with severe food allergies, so I substituted Earth Balance Soy Free Buttery Spread for the butter and rice milk for the milk.  After reading other comments, I brought all ingredients to room temperature.  I also chose to weigh the cake flour (224 grams) and hand mix the dry ingredients in a bowl instead of sifting.  The only problem I had was that the cake stuck in the pans and almost didn't come out.  Next time I will cut wax paper or parchment paper to line the pans.  I'm sure I'll be making this for my friend again soon!

I am sorry to say I truly couldn't eat this cake. It was awful. Not only did it taste nothing like a cake, the cake had fallen and all the batter moved to the edges. All I could taste was eggs and grease. I followed the directions precisely. Just not good. Of course, I enjoy the boxed cake mixes so maybe it is just me. (I have made other cakes from scratch and enjoyed them though)

I am still a novice with baking, so I read many of the reviews before making this cake.  Being in a high altitude area, I also checked with allrecipes for adjustments- Big Mistake!  It said to increase the heat 25 degrees and that is where my cake went wrong.  Unfortunately, I burned the edges trying to get the middle done.  I will make this cake again.  To salvage this one, I poured coconut milk on the still warm cake and will finish it off as "my" version of a coconut cake.  Give this recipe a try and listen to your fellow chefs- great recipe.

The only alteration to this cake I made was a Tbs. of amaretto ( I think it gives a "yellower" cake taste)But this cake came out perfect, soft, fluffy sweet just amazing, you have to follow the directions to the letter and use the proper style ingredients for it to come out properly.  This is one recipe I will make over and over again!

Will probably update this review when I make it again.  I made two modifications-I used 4 whole eggs and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.  Turned out flavorful but didn't rise much at all and tastes a bit greasy.  I think I'll try it again sometime and make sure my eggs and baking powder are a bit fresher.  If the second time yields the same result as this time, I'd probably downgrade to 2 stars.

The best yellow cake I've ever made from scratch! I made it in 8" pans and split each layer.  After frosting, you couldnt tell it from a professional bakery cake.  It tasted wonderful--it just was not decorated fancy.

This was a good cake, it was a bit dense and dry but it held up well to the friut and custard that I put in the cake.  I will use it again.  I am thinking it may need some oil or butter in the recipe to soften up the texture a bit.

I this like a box cake? Heck no.  But it is a fantastic scratch bake cake.  Used it for a Boston Cream pie recipes and everyone loved it.  Many asked what box recipe it was, and could hardly believe it was scratch bake.  Make sure not to over bake.  and keep a pie dish of water in the oven during baking to keep moisture.  Now since there is a lot of left over egg whites simply freeze them in an ice cube tray.  One cube to one egg.  Great for future needs.

I made this yesterday but I was tired and just made it into a sheet pan which worked well I just adjusted the cooking time by a few minutes. The taste is excellent and just as easy as a box mix to throw together. It's texture is more dense than what I am used to but the taste is great and even fine without the chocolate frosting put on top.

Best yellow cake ever!  Perfectly moist, light and fluffy.  I substituted half a teaspoon of vanilla for the paste from one vanilla bean and it took it to a new level.

Excellent recipe! I made this recipe into Boston Cream cupcakes. I tried the cake during the process and it was fantastic. The first time I made it I used cake flour, as directed, the second I followed the recipe exactly as directed. I used AP (all-purpose) flour. I got excellent results both times. It had excellent flavor, a nice crumble, and good color.

Lot of mixed reviews had me worried but it came out wonderful. It seemed like a huge amount of egg yolks, I thought it might make the cake oily. It felt oily coming out of the pan but by the time I got it filled and frosted it was great. I don't think this will my favorite cake of all time but it was just right for what I needed. Not dry or "cornmeal" like as others said. Always mix as little as possible! And what to do with all those left over egg whites?? Well I made meringue cookies!

I listened to the other reviewers by mixing very well after putting in the egg yolks one by one and mixing just enough to incorporate when putting in the flour and milk 1/3 at a time. But it came out dry, dense, and too eggy for my tastes.

I baked this cake and the flavor just isn't where I expected it to be.  Also, the original recipe is not enough to make a 2 layer 8" cake. I have several people that taste test each new cake or pie that I bake and this cake did not pass the test.

This is a good cake, it's not as moist as the boxed cake mix, but it is not crumbly. Holds its shape well, looks beautiful and it's not dried out after several days in the fridge.

This cake was completely flat - it didn't rise at all! I make cakes from scratch all the time, and I've never had a completely flat cake. I followed the directions exactly.  For what it's worth, my kids did say it tasted good. I just couldn't serve it to company.

I have only made cakes with the pre-made mix before, and was a little intimidated by the thought of doing it from scratch. This cake was absolutely delicious!!! And it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. This is now the cake I will be making, never going to buy another store made or pre-made mix again!!

Was hopeful after all the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and found it more like a pound cake. My baking powder was new and works in all my other recipes, but the cake did not rise well. My husband thought it tasted like corn bread, which I read in another review. Will continue to look for a scratch yellow cake.

i haven't had much luck in the past with my yellow cakes coming out well, however this one came out amazing, nice buttery taste moiste and as long as you creamed the butter and sugar well enough and added the yolks 1 at a time and letting it blend in well and basically follow it too the "T" it'll come out great!
thank you for the Recipe!

If you found this cake, dry or bland, you did not slow down and follow the recipe well and you most likely over baked the cake; plain and simple.

I was looking for a scratch yellow cake recipe and found this one.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I have never made a yellow cake from scratch before so I was a little nervous on how it would turn out.  It was fabulous!  So much better than boxed cake.  I frosted it with some chocolate buttercream frosting that I also made from scratch.  My husband could not stop raving about it and eating it!!!

It is crazy how good this cake is!!!  I was looking for the perfect yellow cake for a birthday party, and this could not have been better!  I followed this recipe exactly, not a single change, and I daresay a fight almost broke out over the last slice.  My only recommendation is to follow the directions closely- cream the butter and sugar thoroughly, and add the egg yolks one by one, mixing to incorporate after each one.  If you follow the instructions, you simply can't fail.  I topped this with homemade chocolate frosting, and it was a cake lovers dream come true :)

This is the best and moist yellow cake recipe ever. I followed the recipe to a "T". I used a 9x13 pan and baked it for 35 min.  The only negative comment is that the cake sagged a little in the center (all my ingredients were fresh, no generics or out of date products),after icing the cake you couldn't tell the cake sagged a bit. I still recommend this recipe however, the next time I bake this cake I may add 1 tsp of baking soda. I'll keep you posted.

I used this recipe for my daughter's birthday cake but did it in a 9x13 pan.  That is usually ok to do instead of two rounds.  It was not enough batter and so the cake is only about 3/4 of an inch high :(.  From what I tasted it is good.  I am not an amateur baker either.  I'm disappointedly baking some extra cupcakes from a box to make up for the sadness of this cake.

I adore this recipe, I make it for every birthday in the family! I actually make it into cupcakes, baking for only 15-20 minutes. They always turn out super moist and delicious, I often don't even ice them!

This should be called pound cake that is the consistency it has.  I was looking for an actual cake not a dense heavy pound cake.  It doesn't rise like cake batter, and it is a bit dry!

Love it! added into my go-to yellow cake recipe! I've finally found a recipe thats perfect and moist! and not dry like a cornbread. Goes well with many things. Didnt change a thing in the recipe. Just make sure you cream the butter sugar well...and as you add all the eggs, i whip it a few more minutes after until light and creamy and fluffy...then continue on... Make sure you don't overmix once you add all the dry ingredients, it'll toughin' flatten the cake if mixed too much.

I did not care for this recipe. Mine was done baking 13 min before it was supposed to be, it was so fluffy it had no taste and trying to get it out of the pan to stack on the other cake was a nightmare.  I was kindda bummed, normally when something gets really good reviews its actually good.

Moist and pretty good for a cake but does not make nice cupcakes. My cupcakes were very flat and just ugly. I needed plain cupcakes for my daughters decorate your own cupcake party and i could not serve these, they looked horrible. I went to king arthur flour and made the tender white cake recipe into cupcakes and they were fantastic. Best i have had even from a bakery.

Perfect yellow cake recipe! Tasted like a cake from a REAL bakery (not one of those grocery store fakeries). Moist, perfect density, not crumbly at all, easy to carve (I baked 2 9" rounds for a teddy bear cake, used one for the head, the other to carve out ears). Everyone at my daughter's 1st birthday party raved about it—every plate was clean to the last crumb.

I made one ingredient change: only had 6 eggs, so I did 2 whole eggs + 4 yolks. Also didn't bother to sift the dry ingredients together, instead mixed baking powder and salt in with the butter/sugar/eggs before alternately mixing in flour and milk. I don't like to do extra dishes.

Used the left over egg whites to make "Authentic French Meringues" from this website (also delish).

Thank you David!

Love it! Made this today, within 3 hours it's almost gone.
Followed the direction and end up with a moist, fluffy cake.  I made the creamy chocolate frosting from this website also, and it is divine!
Thank you for this recipe.  It's definitely a keeper!

Ok, so I was looking for a good cupcake recipe and stumbled upon this.  DO NOT try and make this recipe into cupcakes! The taste was great but boy did they look awful!  I'm obviously not an experienced baker but I'm thinking that I needed the egg whites to keep them fluffy.  Oh well, another bites the dust.  If anyone knows of a yellow cupcake recipe please let me know!

I made this cake, using 6 egg yolks instead of 8 because my eggs were extra large. Also made my own cake flour using the AP flour and substituting 2 T. of the flour with cornstarch. I used 1 T. of vanilla instead of 1.5 t. because I like it very vanilla-ee! I baked the cake in a standard bundt pan, and it took 35 minutes. It turned out very well. Remember to let your eggs come to room temperature when baking. It does make a difference!!  I will definitely make this cake again, it's delicious.

This got good reviews at my son's birthday party but it was a little dry.  I didn't have cake flour so I sifted the makeshift cornstarch plus a.p. together for a long time then sifted that with the dry ingredients a few times.  I also REALLY beat the wet ingredients.  When it was all said and done, I added about 1.5-2 cups of crushed oreos to make a cookie cake.  I recommend this cake but due to other ratings, I would be afraid not to put in the extra work of sifting and beating.  I think I will add extra milk next time for moisture.

Great cake recipe! I used four whole eggs instead of 8 egg yolks. However, if I was making angel food cake, I would save the yolks and make this cake to freeze. Yum!

A moist yellow cake.  I have made it a few times including once with soy milk for a dairy-free cake.
Bake time is longer than suggested.

I made some modifications based on previous reviews and ingredients that I had on hand: I used 4 whole eggs, 1 cup of milk, and self-rising flour. This recipe came out perfect! It was light, fluffy, and delicious. I can't wait to make it again.

Amazing! I added more milk, and this was the best yellow cake I've ever had! I actually made cupcakes and put chocolate icing on top! They were delicious! I highly recommend this recipe!

Perfect yellow cake.  This seems to be the only dessert I make these days.  Endless variations.  With the egg whites I make a mean Swiss buttercream.  I am making lime curd for a filling and then will be adding coconut rum to the frosting.  My husband wants me to soak the cake in rum but I am afraid it might make it soggy.  Might have to make a test cake :)

I made this cake on 7/7/12 for my sons birthday.mi googled moist cakes read the reviews and thought I would try it it was full of flavor, but so heavy and dense it was like it never got completely done. When you ate a piece it weighed so heavy in your stomach you really couldn't eat anything else.

Followed the recipe exactly to make cupcakes.  It made about 18 cupcakes.  Although, I have a bad habit of overfilling cupcake tins, so it could probably stretch to more.  They came out beautifully.   This recipe was super buttery - so if you like butter, you'll like this cake!

Very moist and dense scratch cake.  The icing/frosting is the key to how well you'll enjoy the texture.  Strawberries, or any fruit, glaze, or a milk chocolate creamy frosting are superb!

Easy and thorough directions.

This is a very good cake. It's very moist. My 11 year old daughter made this for her sister's birthday and we all loved it. She followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I don't know how this could be the same recipe as the one people are saying came out dry and like cornbread.  Some of the issues other people had, like the cake cooking too fast on the outside and not cooking in the middle, and the rubbery texture are obviously from oven temp needing to be adjusted for their particular oven, and over mixing. Just as a note, ours was baked in a convection oven for 30 minutes. We set the temp for 350 and our oven adjusted automatically to 325.

Hmmmm -- very dense, almost like a pound cake, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but not what I was expecting. Also, I couldn't seem to get it "done" on the inside, so I ended up with a crusty outside and a gooey middle. Tastes great, if you like pound cake or sugar cookies.

excellent. The batter was thicker than I expected it to be, but ti baked up nice and moist. You may want to add a little yellow/orange food coloring to make it a bit more "yellow". The batter was pretty yellow, but after baking it wasn't as yellow as I'd expected it might be. Tasted wonderful.

It's just my husband and I in our house so I scaled this down to make about 4 cupcakes :) I combined/followed a few other reviews' tips and they were AMAZING! I've never been able to find a great yellow cake recipe. I'm a great cook and baker, but they turn out either too dense or not enough flavor. I happen to lovee boxed cake mix, for the record! This cake, if done right, is incredibly fluffy, moist, adn tastes great!! Tips I followed: I beat the butter and sugar for several minutes until it was very light and fluffy! Like icing! Then I added each yolk one at a time and blended well. I didn't have cake flower so I used 2T corn starch per cup flour (in my case 4t to 2/3 cup). I sifted them into the a bowl, mixed with a whisk, and sifted (a second time) into the bowl with with the "wet" ingredients (also added flour FIRST). Yes all these things take extra time and effort and seem as though they couldn't make much of a difference, but that's baking, and they really do! TRY THIS :)

Finally, a perfect yellow cake recipe that is perfect for us! I halfed the recipe in case it didn't turn out as expected and baked in an 8x8 dish. It took about 35 minutes baking time in my oven. It was a perfectly moist texture and wonderfully sweet. The family had to have a piece warm from the oven, before I could even frost it. They enjoyed it so much plain, I didn't even put a frosting on it. The cake is sweet enough without the frosting anyway. A perfect keeper, but I'll try not to make it often because it's too hard to resist :)

This is soooo good.  I made cupcakes, and ended up with 21.  It is St. Paddy's day--so I added green dye to the butter mixture.  I don't have a sifter, but I attempted to aerate with a fork and it seemed to work fine.  I used the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" recipe from this site. They really turned out amazing--I'm a beginner and both recipes are really easy to follow.

If I could give this cake recipe 10 stars I would!!! I used this recipe as a marble cake, separating it into half, adding 1/2 cup of cocoa to one part, and keeping the other yellow. Then swirled them into marble when I got both into my muffin cups. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added 4 whole eggs, instead of the 8 yolks, and it was sooooo super moist, light and fluffy, honestly, it was similar to a box cake. I couldn't be happier! I have always steered away from homemade cakes, because I don't like the dense texture and sometimes eggy taste...but never again! I found the perfect recipe!

I used this recipe in a boston cream cheesecake recipe that calls for a boxed yellowcake mix. I found this absolutely delicious! I only used half, so with the other half of the mix, I added some corn starch and baking soda in hopes of ensuring my cupcakes formed a dome. They didn't. I added coconut and cut up mandarin oranges. I then topped them with homemade butter cream frosting with real fresh squeezed mandarin juice and orange flavoring. They were great!

This is far more like a pound cake than a normal yellow cake. The egg yolks make the cake very dense. Having said that it was a delicious pound cake!

I love love love this cake.   Definitely not anything like box cake and as other people posted, really watch it in the oven. It can go from ready to overcooked really quickly. Definitely use the cake flour as I tried this with APF and adjusted the amount and it came out too doughy.  Overall a great recipe and will be my go to yellow cake from now on!

This cake is wonderful and fluffy! The only changes I made was (1) sift the cake flour, baking soda, and salt 2x and (2) using 1 cup vanilla soy milk instead of 3/4 cup regular milk and the vanilla extract. Also, I cooked the cake for 25 minutes.

Eating right now.  Awesome!  I did reduce to 3 eggs and 2 egg yolks, plus I did the 1 1/4 buttermilk instead of milk.  This hit my sweet tooth spot.

I absolutely love this recipe! It is super buttery and tasty. I had no problems with it being dry or crumbly, but I did mix the eggs separately as it required and added the milk and flour separate as well. When I added the egg yolks I beat them for a while to make the batter fluffy. Only variance was a I used a little less sugar, added a bit more vanilla and added a cup of chopped walnuts. It was AWESOME. :)

This is an excellent yellow cake recipe! I have made many from-scratch cakes and this is one of the moistest and most delicious I've ever tasted. As some reviewers have stated, it is critical that you follow the directions carefully. You must take your time beating the sugar with the butter and how you incorporate your eggs. The only change I made to the original recipe was to substitute buttermilk for the regular milk (I had buttermilk on hand).I also baked it in 9 inch rounds making sure to watch the carefully rather than relying on time alone. This cake stayed moist for a week. Even the exposed cut sides stayed moist just covered with plastic wrap. I will definitely be making this cake again!

I followed the directions to the letter and I was very disappointed in this cake. Image it for my husband's birthday, and it had to be the driest cake I've ever made.

This cake did not turn out as a cake.  The 8 inch round cake pans were too small and the cake spilled over the edge.  Then when I tried to get it out of the greased and floured non stick pans, the cake got stuck.  I tried to salvage it and frost it, but it was almost too moist and impossible without tearing it apart.  The cake itself was tasty so I ended up frosting it with milk chocolate frosting and cut it up for a trifle with vanilla pudding and whipped cream as the layers.  I am thinking it has too much baking powder in the recipe.

Made the cake exactly as it appeared and it turned out great. It is a dense cake compared to a box mix, which many people are accustomed to.  My husband even liked it and he doesn't eat much cake.

I have never felt compelled to write a review, however this cake recipe was AWESOME!  I actually made cupcakes- 2 dozen total, baked for 18 minutes at 350.  I used four whole eggs instead of 8 yolks.  DELICIOUS!

I used this recipe for a birthday cake for work, and it got rave reviews. It came out moist, with good texture, and great taste. My only tips would be sift the dry ingredients twice as another reviewer said, and scoop the flour into the measuring cup with a spoon, rather than using the cup directly. This will prevent it getting packed down, and keep you from using too much flour.

I'm sorry David, but I followed this recipe exactly as followed, (but added chocolate chips) and all but all I ended up with was a bland cake. I would not recommend this cake if you are used to delivering rich cakes

I halved the recipe and baked in a round 8" cake dish and I used a convection oven. A lovely, dense, pound cake like texture that went beautifully with sliced strawberries.

No disrespect but I usually use boxed cake, so I found this recipe and tried it out... It was so dense that the bottom of the cupcake was very hard, while the top and middle were moist, so I altered the recipe some to make them more moist. Bad idea... Try were disgusting, I would not waste your time with this recipe:(

A great use for the egg whites that are not used in this recipe, is to make a meringue topping.  Overall, this recipe is easy, fun and great for beginners.  The cake is delicious and recommend  this for anyone with the baking need. Also for a gluten free cake, use rice flour and tapioca flour.  I enjoyed this recipe!  Very yummy!!!!!

Flavor is outstanding. I think I underbaked it slightly and the cake sank a bit, still delicious though. I filled it with lemon curd and iced with buttercream, a huge hit.

I made this cake for my son's birthday. It was a hit! He loved it!! And this is coming from a kid who doesn't like cake. This has got to be the BEST 'made from scratch' recipe that I've ever found. Follow the recipe to a T and enjoy!! You'll never want to use any other recipe ever again!

Delicious! But a little too sweet for my taste. Also, the batter was just a bit too thick, so I had to thin it out with some extra milk--just about a tablespoon!

cake was easy to make and turned out great, although I think I overbeat it ;) 
I used it for the Orange Crunch Cake recipe on this site and it turned out great.  Was able to easily make 3 layers out of this recipe.  Oh--also I used 4 whole eggs so I wouldn't waste eggs.

This was a great recipe, very moist and everyone loved it!  I didn't have any milk in the house so I subbed out a little plain yogurt mixed with a little vanilla ricemilk.

Awesome! I grew up on box cakes which I always thought were just fine.  I wanted to try my new baking skills out so i started out with a chocolate cake from this sight and it was soo bad. I was in tears kind of bad.  But I tryed this one out scared to death it would be too dry. It was AMAZING. I would love to say it was my awesome baking skills but I'm sure the recipe had alot to do with it ;) I will never buy a yellow box cake again. Thank you for sharing this recipe. LOL Got any chocolate cake recipes ?

The best yellow cake from scratch recipe I have ever found. Very moist... not dry at all as some of the other reviews suggest.

Yep, this one is definitely a keeper. Wonderful depth of flavor and really moist for a homemade yellow cake. Didn't have cake flour so I did the corn starch substitution, which I always do anyway because cake flour is expensive. Also only had 7 eggs so I used 6 yolks and one whole.
I'm so glad I like to level my cakes before frosting, because I got to eat the "tops" of these cakes all myself and it was delicious even without frosting!

Mmmm.. move out of the way BettyCrocker, David's Yellow Cake is here! One complaint was that this cake was a little plain, but it is vanilla, I think next time I will try adding chocolate chips, or make it into marble cake. I am against cake from a box, and this cake was made from scratch, yet tasted like cake from a box. Delish!

I made the following changes: 4 whole eggs and some cornstarch added to all purpose flour in lieu of cake flour. This is a very dense cake. Its texture is more reminiscent of a French dessert than a traditional American yellow cake. Maybe I needed to whip it more in the early stages....I don't know. It's still tasty, just not quite what I was expecting.

This mix was very light and fluffy while making batter. Will for sure use the 2 8-inch pans suggested. I used a 8x12 and the dish was too deep to cook cake all the way through at 25 minutes. I cut open the top and cranked the heat to 400 degrees for an additional 10 minutes. Smells great! Tastes even better! Trying it with "Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting" Excited to eat and serve it!

This was a good cake but my family didn't think it was as good as all the reviews claimed it was.  It wasn't a very yellow, moist cake.  Mine turned out more like a vanilla, white cake.  I followed the recipe exactly but maybe next time I will try it again and make some of the suggested changes.

This recipe is wonderful!  Have made this as written and last time made this into a marble cake.  I just took about half the batter out and added about half a cup of cocoa powder to it and mixed well then put into a bundt pan and it came out great!  Sure beats boxed cake mix anyday!

FANTASTIC! My first cake from scratch. I followed the directions exactly except (don't you hate that?) I doubled it because I used 11X15" pan. Moist and delicious but heavy enough to decorate without pulling up crumbs. My only suggestion is not to use the 'touch test' to see when it is done. I tried that at 40 minutes and got nothing. Got worried about the edges getting too brown at 45 minutes and used the toothpick test.

I just completed this cake and it is great.  moist with a light delicate crumb. The key is to not overbake.  Use a tester not the touch method as it will be cooked long before it will spring back a tart lemon filling will cut the sweetness well. It is a bit on the sweet side.  a ta

I made this cake as a single layer for my daughter's first birthday party.  It was a hit with adults and children.  Very moist and taste nothing like a store bought or boxed yellow cake mix.  It goes well with chocolate or white frosting.

Delish!!!! This is hands down one of the best cake recipes ever! I made a few changes. I didn't have cake flour so I took out 2T of flour & added 2T of cornstarch. I sifted all the dry ingrediants twice and made sure to cream the sugar & butter for at least 5 mins. I did 2t of vanilla and I did 4 eggs (so my cake wasn't really yellow!) which I added the yolks 1 at a time & then added the whites which had been lightly beaten. I have made both cupcakes & 1/4 sheet cake. Both recieved rave reviews by family & friends! This will be my go to cake recipe from now on! Thank you!!!

won't make again...after reading reviews changes i made were: 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening , the cup of eggs( yolks with 2 whole eggs to equal 1 cup since while marked large the eggs i have look more like medium) used vanilla sugar, scraped in pulp/seeds from a bean and used the extract.  other than that the same . creamed well( experienced baker) etc. the cake was fluffy and flavorful but TASTES dry...very odd... imo it would be  heavy with all butter and probably still taste dry. the crumb is actually good ( ie sticks together, not like it's over cooked or something)it's the taste...btw used fresh ingredients including premium locally milled (iefreshly milled) cake flour..the batter looked good, it smells good just not a good moist cake imo

I will have to agree with the crowd - this was the best yellow scratch cake I've ever tasted! My husband really enjoyed it.  I frosted it with a chocolate buttercream and filled it with a chocolate ganache.  DELICIOUS!  Like others have said, just follow the recipe exactly and be sure to beat the butter & sugar well and add the egg yolks  one at a time.  I baked it for 27 minutes.  Will surely use again and pass it along!

wonderful cake.  I did 4 yolks and 2 whole eggs.  One of the layers caved a little, but it might have been because I used all purpose flour instead of cake flour.  Will definitely make again.

This cake is wonderful!! The only thing I did was double the recipe for a 15x11 pan and line the bottom of my cake pan with brown sugar and bananas, then I poured the batter on top! By doing this though it made the cooking time about 15 mins longer. What a crowd pleaser!!! Thank you David!

Good flavor, but very dense and crumbly. Not the texture I was hoping for in a yellow cake. May try adding one whipped egg white next time.

This is outrageous!!!!!  I'm done looking for another yellow cake recipe and I'm done using a box cake....this is fantastic!!!  I did sift the flour twice which may be why some thought it was dense.  I also baked in a 13x9 pan at 350 for 30 minutes.  YUM!!!!!!!

AWESOME I made this cake for my mother and father inlaws bithdays and it was a big hit very moist and i made it with cream cheese frosting. The only change i made to this recipe was i did not use cake flour i used all purpose flour and shifted it twice, no need to buy box cake mix anymore.

It was good. Texture is firm as expected for homemade (like comparing store bought bread with homemade, just is different). Didn't go stale fast like Betty Crocker recipe book versions.

I am so disappointed. I followed the recipe word for word and it still came out dry. By the way, it took more than 25-30 mins to bake. I had to increase the baking time to 10 mins every time i poked it cause it was still wet. It took over an hour. I tried it when it was warm n it seemed moist, but when I left it in the fridge overnight and tasted it again, it was dry. It was also slightly dense, although I beat the egg yolks one by one and sifted all the dry ingrdients. It doesn't taste bad it's just dry. I've made cakes that turned out much softer and more moist, and this is coming from a person who never made cake from a cake mix! Anyway, thanks for the post. It's always good to experiment :)

This is the perfect yellow cake recipe. It works BEST if you measure exactly 1 cup of egg yolks...since eggs can vary in size. I've used this recipe only for cupcakes (a wedding and a birthday)...amazing both times. Fudge icing. Salted Caramel icing. Delicious!

This was very good! It's the best HOMEMADE cake I've had. Not moist and fluffy, but still very good! Don't expect this to be like a box cake buttery, fluffly and moist, it's not. It's a real homemade yellow cake and it's very good. Enjoy!

This is the best yellow cake I ever made. Only change I made was about 1/4 tsp more salt. It was perfection.

Wow!  Followed the recipe to a T and turned out great!  People raved about how yummy and moist it was.  Much better than a box cake.  Definitely will use this as my go to yellow cake recipe.

First time we made a cake from scratch and it came out GREAT!! Instead of the 8 egg yolks we used 3 whole eggs and 2 egg yolks. We also added a small box of pudding mix for extra moisture. We will be using this recipe again.....

I made this cake yesterday.  It had good volume and the flavor was good, however, I did not like the coarse texture.  It was too dense and greasy. If the texture was light and fine, it could have been a 5 star.  Sorry, I will use my left-over yolks for something else.

I made this case for my daughter's birthday party, I followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out perfectly!  It was supermoist!  I wasn't too crazy about adding 8 egg yolks but the cake was really good.

I made this and followed the directions exactly.  It turned out really good, not at all corn bread-y as others have said.  It was the first time I have made a yellow cake from scratch and it was for my husband's birthday so I made two different recipes.  I liked the other recipe a little better, it is called Four Egg Yellow Cake and the recipe is here at allrecipes.com as well.  I paired the cake with a chocolate frosting recipe found on here also, it is titled Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting.  I recommend the other cake with this frosting, but this one was also very tasty!

This is an excellent recipe and much better than any box cake recipe. I followed the directions exactly as written and everything came out perfectly. It's very moist and has a light, fluffy texture. I don't know why anyone would not have a perfect cake if following the directions. It is much more effort than preparing a box cake, but that is typical for any scatch recipe.

So, I did change the eggs a little to cut back on yolks, which other people said worked out just fine. But, it didn't work for me. I should have listened to all those reviews saying this cake turns out like cornbread.

Wow.  Can I just leave it as that.  Wow.  My family has a huge sweet tooth and I made this for mother's day.  People were actually sad when it was gone.  They said it was the best cake they ever had.  I paired it with a buttercream icing.  Wow.

This was my first from scratch cake ever. Tasted great, baked well, but I was totally unsure how full to fill my cupcake liners. I did 2/3 like box mixes recommend, and that was WAY TOO much...the tops spilled way out over my muffin tin. I was topping these with fondant for a birthday, so I had to hand-trim the excess off of each. I'd like to see this recipe with recommendations for different types of cakes.

This cake has a delicious vanilla taste, but the texture is somewhat coarse.  It would make a great Boston Cream Pie base with a custard filling and a chocolate ganache glaze.

I made this recipe exactly as written and followed the suggested techniques from the other reviewers.  I made the cake in the morning and served it that night.  It was nice and moist for the party and people seemed to enjoy it.  However, the next day the left over cake was dry and lacked flavor.  (Confession, this was my first "from scratch" cake so I am used to taste and texture of box mixes, but I gave it my best effort.)

This cake was a bit too sweet, and when i combined it with a not too sweet icing, it just seemed like a bit too much. I would just say a bit less sugar. But I loved everything else about, it was very moist, and i forgot to cover it at night, and it was still moist. It was very fluffy too, and i like that on my cakes and cupcakes. I will save this recipe for ever. THANKS!

This was a great cake. The first time I made it, it had turned out rather dense. I followed the recipe exactly and was careful to beat the butter and sugar until fluffy. I made a half batch the second time, but doubled the baking powder. It turned out perfect this time.

Super cake! Thanks for sharing the recipe. Not sure what everyone is talking about when they said it was like cornbread? I took the extra time to cream butter and sugar...do not leave this step out. Used cake flour and the only thing I added was an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla (2 tsp total). The rest was all the same. Fantastic! Thanks again!

This was the first cake I made from scratch and I was a little nervous.  It came out PERFECT!  It was extremely light, fluffy, and moist.  It was the best cake I have ever had.  I made it for my daughter's first birthday and again for my son's third birthday.  Now its everyone's requested cake.  Thank you so much!

This is a very good yellow cake. The consistency and moistness of the cake is perfect. Smell the batter just before you pour it. It smells heavenly! Be aware that the batter will be thick; you really have to spread it after pouring into your pans. It bakes up nicely though. The reason why I give this four stars is because there is something a bit off with the taste. You can really taste the eggs in the cake. This isn't exactly a bad thing, but it is a bit much for my and my husband's taste. Perhaps we just aren't used to a yellow cake made from scratch. I followed the recipe exactly. I made sure to cream my eggs and sugar very well and let the eggs and butter sit to room temp. I have read others say that they used four whole eggs instead of eight egg yolks. Perhaps, this will work better; I will probably try this next time. However, if I do this it will be a white cake. Cakes using only the egg yolk are yellow and cakes with the whole egg are white. Anyway, I do not want to deter anyone here. It does go great with chocolate frosting. I'm just not sure If I would bring this to a dinner party. I admit that I am a bit of  a cake snob. I will continue my search for the perfect yellow cake.

I really liked this cake, but it tasted way too similar to cornbread.  Despite the cornbready taste/texture it was actually pretty good.

The key to making this cake work is to really cream the butter and sugar until you think your hands are going to fall off. I did have to make this cake twice, but only because I stupidly forgot to add the flour mixture to my eggs and sugar... Talk about dumb.    Anyway great recipe.

I made this cake for my daughter's 5th birthday. She asked for a castle cake. This recipe calls for a lot of egg yolks but now I know the reason. It's quite a delicious and moist cake. I doubled the recipe (used this cake for the castle base) and used 9 x 13" pan. The cake turned out well but I have to remember to invert cake onto a cake board instead of cooling rack as cake broke apart a bit. Not to worry though, easy to fix with icing. I didn't find the cake to be dry, a bit dense but just what I needed. You need to make sure to follow recipe and when cake top springs back or stick inserted to middle of cake comes out clean (this is what I did) remove from oven (prevents dry cake). Definitely better than store bought, packed yellow cake. I will use this recipe again. My daughter thinks this cake is very yummy and she knows cake!

This was delish, however, I think I know why some cakes fall (mine did as well but it was still delish)...try it again with fresh baking power.  Mine was old and I will get some new baking powder and try it again.  I made 1/4th of the recipe and made 5 cupcakes which only needed 18 minutes to bake.  I beat the butter and sugar for 5 minutes and sifted the flour mixture twice (as recommended), the cake was not dry at all.

OK, I went and bought new baking powder and the cupcakes still sunk...anyone out there with any suggestions?

This cake was delicious, and one of the best yellow cakes from scratch I have tried. I used 1 cup heavy cream instead of the milk, and it turned out great! The only disadvantage to this recipe is the amount of eggs you have to use.

This recipe is awesome! My cake came out so yummy and dense. It was just amazing. I currently hold the title of making the best yellow cake (in my boyfriends eyes). I found it tasted best with this bittersweet chocolate frosting. The chocolate frosting melts in your mouth and tastes great with cold cake. VERY YUMMY! thank you

It is a dryer cake - pairs well with chocolate frosting.  I am going to try to incorporate sour cream/pudding to make it a little more moist.

This was my first time baking ANYTHING from scratch and I loved it!!!! I did substitute 4 whole eggs for the eight egg yolks aside from that I followed the recipe to the letter and what I got was a beautiful yellow cake.  My cake tasted wonderful however it DID get stuck to the pan (completely my fault) so I suggest any first time bakers use wax paper to line the pan and this will DEFINITELY keep the cake from sticking. oh and David if you have any other recipes I look forward to trying them out! :)

Absolutely amazing!  I wanted to make a simple frosted yellow cake that my husband could bring into work on his birthday, and this is it!!  I was a little sceptical because my batter was really, really thick, even after I had already added an additional splash of milk and I started to get worried when the cake didn't really rise in the oven. But I shouldn't have worried, the cake was super moist, had awesome flavor ( and I don't even LIKE yellow cake), was light and fluffy and yet dense enough  for easy frosting( I used "Special Buttercream Frosting" from this site).   I used Cake Flour substitution (1 3/4C AP flour + 1/4C cornstarch) and one 9x9inch square pan. I will try adding some baking soda next time.  This will definitely be my yellow-cake-go-to recipe from now on!!  Thank you!!!

This is the BEST yellow cake I've ever made! I tried everything, all the fancy recipes in cake books, all the "moist" cake recipes, but they were always dry. This one is easy to make and turned out perfect, very moist and flavorful. Good job, David!!!!

I thought I'd try this cake last night. I didn't want too much in case I didn't like it, so I cut it down to 3 servings. I made it in a loaf pan and cut it in thirds to make a little three layer cake. It turned out great! I had to use all purpose flour since I didn't have cake flour, but that didn't seem to be too bad, maybe because I'm at a high altitude. I added a bit more vanilla since some people thought the egg taste was too strong. It was definitely not as moist as cake mix but I liked how the dryer edges tasted like sugar cookie.

I folowed Naples advice and beat the sugar and butter extreamly well! I always add extra vanilla to everything which I did here as well. They cake was awesome! It didn't take long at all to make or bake. It reminded me of the cupcakes my mom used to make when I was a kid. I used my chocolate buttercream recipe for the top.

I don't know how to rate this--I must've done something wrong b/c the cake totally fell apart on me.  Instead of rising up, as cakes tend to do, it caved in the center.  The taste.....AMAZING.  But I am grateful it was a "trial run" and not the actual day I needed the cake!

Perfect! Just what I was looking for. It has an excellent and rich flavor - not "floury" or dull. I used AP flour w/cornstarch and that worked fine.

It did seem a little too dry, I even tried cooking one pan with pouring raspberry filling evenly across the top which was ok.  My husband rated it 1.5 stars, I do think it was better than a boxed cake for though.  I have not made a ton of yellow cakes from scratch - but I have eaten a lot of them, so that combined with following the recipe so closely is why I gave this a  3 star rating.

My boyfriend wanted a yellow cake with chocolate frosting so I had to find the perfect recipe! I am very pleased with this recipe and will use it from now on when I need a yellow cake! I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and baked it in a small cake pan. It was perfect for 2 people to have a couple of servings !

I do not know how anyone could possibly rank this recipe with anything less than five stars!!  After following the directions of a few users with respect to technique (e.g., I beat the sugar and butter for 7-10 min. before adding the eggs, separately, of course) I used 4 whole eggs instead. This cake came out fabulously!!  It was moist, fluffy, and light.  Though it smelled like eggs once it finished baking the end product was a rapidly disappearing cake!  This is my favorite and I will use it again and again and again....

I followed the recipe exactly, and I thought the flavor and appearance of this cake were excellent.  I was, however, a bit surprised by how dry the cake turned out, especially given the amount of butter in the recipe.  I'll have to take another look at some of the comments, regarding how to make the cake more moist.  I'd like to make this recipe again -- it surpasses box mixes by a long shot -- but I also feel I'll need to play around a bit in order to eliminate the dry, almost shortbread sort of texture.

i give this four stars because its still in the oven. I tried this recipe after a fail recipe which was a white cake and wow it was horrible.Now i must say im only 15 years old and this was the easiest by far the only thing i changed was the eggs it was way too much especially for my hugh family we would be low on egs fo instead i used 4 whole eggs and about 1/4 cup of oil. I figured it would add the extra moisture the eggs may have provided i really hope this recipe is a success for me since this is my second cake today and all i can say is i cant wait to eat it!!!

I used 3/4 of the sugar the recipe called for, and it was still way too sweet.  Other than that, it was perfectly moist and yummy.  Next time I'll use 1/2 the sugar!

I bake all of the time, but this was my first homemade yellow cake. I used this recipe with a few adjustments: 3 whole eggs, 2 yolks, lowfat buttermilk instead of just milk. I made cupcakes, and they turned out alright. You definitely need to make sure you leave it in the oven until the tops turn slightly brown or the centers will be full of eggs and flour. The cupcakes sunk quite a bit, unfortunately. It was still rather moist, though. I'll try this recipe once more and hope for the best.  My suggestions: use only 4 whole eggs, use the buttermilk alternative, realllyyyy beat the sugar and butter (with a beater, not your kitchenaid or it will stay at the bottom of the bowl while you add the other ingredients and won't mix well enough into the batter). Fill cupcake liners 3/4 full.

Wow, this cake was not what I expected at all.  Maybe I don't know the secret to good cake making but I thought I did everything right.  It was very dry!  I mean, really dry. I won't be making this again. I'm actually going to throw it away.

The perfect yellow cake recipe!  I used the all-purpose flour adjustment and it came out great.  I'll bet it's even better with the cake flour, but I was very satisfied with my results. I used it for cupcakes and baked for 18 minutes. I ended up with 2 dozen cupcakes.  This recipe is a keeper!

It's been awhile since I made a cake from scratch, but I'm looking for a great one. I followed this recipe to the letter, except I used 9" pans instead of 8" (that's what I have).  I'm not sure how people can say this cake is dense. My cake came out super light and fluffy. I actually wanted it to be a little denser LOL! I felt like it was just so "airy" in my mouth. Personally, I like my cake to be just a bit heavier so I feel like I'm eating something.  I used all the ingredients in the recipe and sifted the flour as stated once. I baked it for 25 minutes exactly. I give it 4 stars because it is definitely light in texture. It is a bit dry though.

It was my first time making cake from scratch and it turned out so good!  I used regular flour, I could see how some say it had a "corn bread" texture a little bit, but topped with whipped cream from this site and fresh strawberries it was AWESOME!!!  I halved the recipe and used 1 whole egg and 3 egg yolks and only one 8 inch pan for 35 min at 350 deg and it turned out great.

I was a little nervous in making this cake. Considering the review about how dry it was etc. I have NEVER baked a cake from scratch, and decided to finally try it. IT WAS PERFECT! It was just divine. I used two 9" pans. I took advice on the comments and used 2 full eggs and 6 egg yolks. Wondreful! My whole family has requested it now for their birthday. Thanks!! Also.. I did make sure all of my ingredients were room temp :)

My husband said this is the best cake he ever ate. His mother only cooked from scratch so I take that as a huge compliment. He thought the texture of the cake was perfect as well as the taste. We raise our own chickens so the yolks were very yellow.

The flavor was good but it was really dense.  I think I can cut back on the egg yolks.  Just didn't have the light, fluffy texture I was hoping for.

I did think that the taste of this cake was very, very good, but unfortunately for me, the layer that I used for the top of my cake fell apart; my family is now calling it the "Grand Canyon Cake"! I think that it was most likely my own fault, as I am not used to baking cakes from scratch- I always doctor up the box mixes.  What I did for this recipe was make it a lemon cake; I added about a 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice and 3 TB of lemon zest to the batter and used a lemon curd for the middle of the cake. Tasted flipping great but it did fall apart. I think that I overmixed the batter a bit, but I am going to try it again and see what happens. Oh, and I did use cake flour with this recipe which is new for me, too. Just gotta get back up on the horse and try again! LOL

We have egg and milk allergies, so I substitute some things. I use allergy-safe margarine and milk, and use 4 Tbs of flax seed meal with 12 Tbs hot water in place of the 8 eggs. You need to reduce the butter/marg by a tablespoon or so because of the slight oil content of the flax. The cake turns out light and the crust is crispy. It has a great flavor and I eat it without frosting sometimes! (I would rather eat just frosting than just cake) We love this recipe.

I had great success with this cake.  I also tried it again but added almost 1 cup of cocoa for a chocolatey version, which turned out nice as well.  Thanks!

I followed the directions exactly and my cake was 1/4 inch thick and didn't rise. It also dripped over the side and made a huge mess in my oven. I believe that if I had used the whole egg it might have been more fluffy. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it tasts really good. This is great for those who don't care about how their cake looks but try a different cake if you want looks and taste!

Excellent yellow cake recipe. I used the mixing advice from other reviewers for this cake and beat the sugar & eggs a lot.  The batter turns out thick but the cake has a very moist texture.

I liked this cake, but you really need a dynamic frosting to go with it. May I suggest "Rich Chocolate Frosting" (also on allrecipes.com)?

My first from scratch cake came out perfect. Thanks a million! It was delicious and so moist. I will no longer use boxed mixes! I don't understand what people are talking about cornbread texture, mine was perfect!

Bar none the BEST yellow cake ever! I found the flavor and texture to be incredible. The cake was alittle much for 2 8" rounds so it did run over a bit. I just laid a sheet of foil on the lower rack to catch any drips. Also don't leave the cakes to cool any longer than 10 minutes as the moisture buildup is not what you want.
Great recipe thank you David!

This is it - I have been subjecting everyone in town to my yellow cake "taste testing".  I have made many (and I mean a lot) of recipes, some I have found online, others are variations of recipes found but this is it!!!  It was a huge hit - thanks a ton for the recipe... Sandi

Please save your time with this recipe! I was shocked at how horrible this cake came out with it being 4 1/2 stars. I was a bit skeptical with the egg yolks, and my instincts were correct unfortunately. Like another reviewer commented, the cake browned too fast, the middle didn't cook, and the edges of the cake started to cave inward. It was a huge failure. My cake took almost 40 minutes in the oven at 350 and it still wasn't cooked in the middle. My oven is usually dead on, so I am not sure what is going on here.

ok, I used this recip for cupcakes. And I dont think that was a good idea. The batter is tasty and easy to assemble. But as cupcakes these baked up really flat. They almost looked like a suger cookie from the top. But they tasted great and worked out ok. I will use this recipe again, but will be putting the batter in cake pans as directed,

a bit too sweet, but it had a nice fluffy texture to it. next time, I will definitely cut back on the amount of sugar -- it was also really egg-like, not really reminiscent of the boxed yellow cake I was looking for.

When I saw that this recipe called for 8 egg yolks, I had to give it a try. But unfortunately it's not as great as I had hoped it would be. Although the smell was heavenly as it was baking, the flavor is just simply average. I definately will not be making this again..a cake with 8 yolks has to be amazing to put it in my regular rotation and this was forgetable. Also, I had to drink 2 full glasses of milk to choke a piece down because it gets so thick in your mouth. Oh well, at least it was fun to make.

Everyone liked it but it seemed a bit dry to me.  Maybe b/c I used all purpose flour?  I'll try next time with cake flour.

No disrespect, but this is the worst scratch cake I've ever baked.  And I've been baking for over 20 years.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding pineapple extract with the vanilla.  My cake didn't rise and  was so dense (if you can call it that) that when I pressed it with my finger, it felt like a board, stiff yet still doughy.  I would give it zero stars, but the minimum here is one star.  What a waste of good ingredients!

Used this recipe to make valentines day cupcakes. I had to adjust a bit for cupcakes. Fill cups 3/4 full and tap pan down a few times to even out batter. Also, only leave them in the oven for 20-22 minutes. They turned out great! I also traded 2T of cornstarch for AP flour, since I didn't have cake flour on hand. Will definitely make again!

I'm going to make this today.  I already have to mark the recipe down a little because it doesn't specify whether the author used salted or unsalted butter or what kind of milk is suggested.  Whole vs. skim tends to make a difference in a cake and I'm serious about my cakes!  More to come post baking.

I used all purpose flour and did as one poster suggested by replacing 2 T of the flour with cornstarch to make up for not using cake flour; results were not too good. I baked the cake in a 9x13 and it was flat.  I will try again some time with cake flour, as I suspect that was the problem.

This recipe is the best yellow cake I've ever made. It is very moist, delicious, and soft. It's a great way to get rid of frozen egg yolks. I split the recipe between a 9x9 and 8in. round pan (I frosted one and left the other bare). Beware! The cake is very soft and can easily break apart when being taken out of the pan. I found the round pan cake to be much easier to handle w/o breaking. This is a perfect recipe for entertaining as it will impress all your guests.

I had a very nice outcome with this recipe.  It had a great flavor, first of all.  The cake baked nice and evenly, so it was easy to frost, and it had a nice spongy texture.

After a seemingly endless search for a non-cake mix cake to make for birthdays, I found this recipe.  My god, it made such a fantastic cake!  I followed the recipe to exactness, but my mom decided to 'help' me by taking out my finished cakes that were calmly cooling for the very important 15 minutes in the pans and transferring one to the cooling rack.  Needless to say, it was a near disaster because a big piece broke off.  It's always important to remember that things continue to cook even when they come out of the oven!  At any rate, all ended up well and the cake was positively divine.  I'll be making this regularly any time I need a yellow cake, as I really love baking from scratch.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This cake tasted delicious but fell to pieces and was very crumbly.  I didn't use cake flour, so that may have something to do with it.  Taste = 5 stars, but consistency was only 4 stars.

One of the photos looked wonderful, just like those cake bases that a favourite bakery of mine makes. I was rather disappointed in this cake, though it was tender, and held up extremely well to slicing and layering. But it just didn't have the light, un-greasy to the touch feel that I was looking for. It's not a bad cake, just not what I want. But I'm sure I'll try again.

I thought this was a very good yellow cake. I followed the ingredients exactly and it worked fine for me. I think you need to be sure your baking powder is fresh, maybe that is the cause of the cornmeal texture. Everyone at the party thought it was very tasty.

I liked how dense the cake was, but it was not as buttery or flavorful as I was hoping it would it be.

Cornbread. The flavor isn't bad, but there's a crust on the sides, top and bottom of this cake that gives it the texture of cornbread.

This is great, not as yellow as the box mix, but tastes much better. However, I will cut back on the sugar next time. I actually made this into fancy smancy strawberry shortcakes. I baked cupcakes, sliced them in half, layered with freshly sugared/sliced strawberries, and fresh whipped cream & topped with a mint leaf. My guests absolutely LOVED them.

Very moist and rich cake. So easy to make, and very delicious. Pair it with different flavored frostings and toppings for variety. Very nice. Thank you for posting.

Very tasty, a bit like my Mom's sugar cake cookies.  Didn't rise as well as I would've liked though.  I think maybe leave in a few of the egg whites?  Otherwise very good!

I didn't care for this recipe.  Made cupcakes and by the next day they were hard already.  Using only yolks turned out to be really wastefull, if you ask me.  I think I will keep looking for another recipe.

This is the third Christmas I've made this cake.  This is the THE BEST Yellow Cake I have ever made from scratch.  My family adores this cake and I usally wind up making another cake a few days after Christmas.  You rock David!

This cake was great.  I made it for my daughters 5th birthday and everyone raved. It doesn't rise overly so it makes the perfect layer cake.  We topped w/ Barbie pink marshmallow buttercream and it was gone!!

I have made this a few times now and it always comes out perfect. It is very easy and wonderful with a chocolate frosting. 
Once I made this and transported  it on a 6 hour carride and served it the next day at dinner and it was just as delicious as when i served it the same day.

Very moist and rich. Best cake recipe I've made. However, it's very fattening. I am going to try this with 4 whole eggs instead of all the egg yolks and a tbsp of vinegar added to the milk. You can use White Lily all purpose flour with good success. Do not overmix the flour.

This recipe was delicious.  I made it for my parents combined birthday party.  I did find it needed a longer cooking time however it might be because of the altitude I am at.  I used a chocolate frosting recipe found on this site I will make it again!!!

This was a good basic cake. I used four whole eggs instead of 8 egg yolks-I too had no use for all those whites! That may have made a difference, I'm not sure. I will use this again.

I tried this cake and the first time I made it it really did not have enough flavor.  It tatse like it was missing something so I tried another cake and this time I used a box of vanilla pudding and I put 1/4 cup of vegatable oil it was much better after that.  I will use this recipe again.

This cake had a good taste but found it to be a little dry.  Maybe could cut back the flour to 1 1/2 cups or maybe add a little more butter.  I will have to tweak this one a little.  Thanks for sharing.

It was good.  It tasted like a boxed cake.  Which meant it was yummy, but not really worth the effort.
