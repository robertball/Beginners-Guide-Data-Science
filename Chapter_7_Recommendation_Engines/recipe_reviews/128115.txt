I don't know why I said chopped squash... I meant cooked. Anyhow, you can use 3 cups of squash if desired. I found it does help to use a little more than 2 cups. Also, yes, you can sustitute butter and margarine out, AND cut back slightly if you choose. I add more cheese than the recipe calls for as well. The only other thing I wanted to say.... someone said they cut out the sugar. It's only a SMALL amount, and the sugar helps the flavor come out in the dish. Anytime you add sugar to a salty dish, it helps accentuate the flavor of your meal. I learned this from my grandmother as well. :) I hope I helped fix my recipe... there's no edit button. haha. Thank you for the wonderful reviews!

We have taken this recipe for our squash casserole and have thrown out the one we had.  It is really delicious.  I usually don't make changes but due to the time I had and the ingredients on hand I altered it a bit.  I used 3 cups squash and some   carrots (steamed all veggies)just because we like lots of veggies.  I also used one box of cornbread stuffing mix (house brand ok) with the seasonings already in it then omitted the sage and salt and pepper.  I cut the margarine to 1/4 cup because we didn't need the extra fat.  I followed everything else and it was fantastic.  This is a real keeper.

I used Cream of Mushroom soup, only about 3 tablespoons of butter and no celery at all (I didn't have any celery) and it was delicious. I used more than a half cup of cheese in it as well and I'm glad that I did. I noticed someone else left out the cheese and replaced the cornbread with regular white bread and gave the recipe a 3 star rating. You can't change up the entire recipe and then say you didn't really like it, it's just not fair to the person who posted the recipe in the first place.

MMMMMMMM so good.  I subbed a box of the "store brand" cornbread stuffing for the cornbread, as that was all I had on hand, so I left out the salt.  I also halfed the amount of butter, and added extra cheese.  Very small adjustments that were made, and I must say this was so good.  I served it with ham, and it went perfectly, but I liked the casserole better than my ham(LOL).  Thanks so much for a great recipe!  It's a keeper!

As my husband said, this was much nicer than he would have initially thought, especially given that he does not really like squash. It had a lovely texture to it and was a warm and yummy side dish. This was a bit more complicated than I would like for a weekday meal-cutting and dicing and a 1 hour bake time involved.  We did have one fairly big change to the recipe -not sure if it changed it much but (being in Canada) cornbread was not easily available so I used fresh white bread diced up and added about 2 tbsp of cornmeal in its place. It whipped up nicely and once the egg and soup mix were added, the squash blended in nicely.  
The only other comment I would make is that I don't think the cheese was necessary as the side and top was a crispy brown and could have stood alone. Cutting the cheese would have cut the calories drastically -this being a side dish and the vegetable portion of our meal.

We really enjoyed this.  It did remind me of Thanksgiving.  I didn't measure the squash, cornbread, onion or celery.  I ended up using two small sized squash that I cubed and microwaved briefly in water to soften.  I used a 10 oz can of cream of chicken soup and did not add the margarine.  I made my own cornbread using Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread recipe here on AR and then used the same pan to bake this recipe.  I think I would add more squash and less cornbread next time but I definitely will be making this again.  I wish I had fresh yellow squash at Thanksgiving!

Being from Texas, I knew I'd more than likely prefer a southern squash casserole recipe. BINGO! It's delicious. I followed Alyssa's comments and did add 3 cups squash and loads of sharp cheddar. The butter, cornbread, squash and onions come together perfectly. Kiss that Nana for me!

Extremely good recipe! It was loved by all. It's definitely a keeper. Maybe use a little less to half the amount of butter. I doubled the recipe and I'm sure the small amount of leftovers will be gone lightning fast.

I followed other reviewer's advice with less butter, more cheese, and added a touch of Sour cream.  I improvised with frozen sliced yellow squash (thawed, cooked few seconds prior), and added perhaps a 1/2 cup extra squash than what the recipe calls for.  Will fix again, as it got great reviews.  However, I will add more soup next time for more flavor/moistness.

This was a yummy side, but I must confess I made a few changes to use what I had in the house and avoid going to the store! Change 1, no celery but had frozen corn so threw in a cup. 2, the can of soup I had was a 10 oz so I put in an additional 1/3 cup of milk to get approximately the same amount of liquid. 3, Discovered I didn't have any sage but did have dried tarrigon and dried basil so I put in a tsp of the tarrigon and a nice sprinkle of the basil. 4, We like a crunchy top to our casserole so I tossed Panko breadcrumbs with the cheese topping. In the end , despite my meddling and substituting, it was delish! Absolutely yummy!

This casserole is absolutely. I am having some leftovers for a midnight snack right now. However I would not call is casserole actually but more like squash dressing. If I have to take a covered dish for a holiday this will be it....Thanks so much!!! This is a keeper and is going on our family cookbook.

Oh my gosh!  This is so great.  I made it last nite and it seemed more like a squash dressing to me.  I used butter instead of margarine, onion powder instead of real onion, and fresh sage from my garden for the dried.  It is fabulous!

I loved this! Even my non squash eating 14-year-old loved it! I followed the recipe pretty much.  I only had a 10 3/4 oz can of cream of chicken and I ommitted the sage.  Also, instead of boiling my squash I just microwaved it for about six minutes. Loved it and will be making it again.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

This is a very good recipe. My only changes would be to leave out the sugar. I also buy the Martha White's Yellow Cornbread Mix (it doesn't have sugar) for the prepared cornbread. I also like to add 1/2 teaspoon of poultry seasoning.

This is the best casserole I have ever had and you don't even have to like squash. Every time I make it people go crazy for it. Super good. You can substitute all he spices an bread crumbs for a box of stuffing.

Very yummy and uses up the abundance of yellow squash. I made cornbread using Better Homes New Cookbook recipe so I did not add sugar. I would cut the butter in half next time and add 3 cups squash instead of 2.

Absolutely delicious!  I saute the veges in the butter then add them to the mix.  After cooking this the first time I added some smoked chicken and it was a yummy main dish.  This is now the dressing I make at Thanksgiving! Thanks Nana for the delicious casserole!

This is one is a keeper.  I have fiddled with the recipe to make it a little healthier.  Cut back on butter to 1/4 cp. ( and I will try to cut even more) and used replaced with Smart Balance. Of course one of the tricks with Cbread is to preheat your iron skillet so the batter sizzles when added to pan.  be sure to have a good coating of oil, butter or whatever, (if butter it will burn if you don't add it right before the batter.   I do saute the onion and celery prior to adding  for this recipe and cook the squash in chicken broth.  instead of cm of whatever soup I use half and half, have added buttermilk to the mix and that is good too, with ck broth or bullion to flavor....  It seems time consuming but so much can be done before hand and them just assembled prior to baking.....It is on my top hummmmm.....15 or so recipes for a dependable crowd pleaser and comfort food.

I didn't change anything in the recipe. It's a lot like my nana's cornbread dressing that she used to make every Thanksgiving. I am in love with this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This is a very comforting dish.  I will say you do need more squash.  I think 4 cups would do best.  I also used extra soup by accident(used whole can) and I used Campbell's Cream of Chicken w/Herbs(didn't have plain on hand). This worked well. For the cornbread I used Pioneer Brand Yellow Cornbread mix (not sweet, so I used the sugar),but if you use the Jiffey or a sweet one I'd leave out the sugar. I will make again but with more squash and I might add a little extra cheese inside the dish.  Yummy on this cold night.

I was excited about this receipe as I love squash; however, the three people I served it too did not enjoy it and I was disappointed.  I would not make it again.

I made the recipe just as it was printed ....but I didn't quiet like it the way it was. It was OK, but not totally to my liking. The next week I made it again and changed it a bit and now I love this recipe! The changes I made were ..... I added  1 cup more of squash, added an extra egg, added more fresh ground black pepper, did NOT use the sugar, sage, celery, or cheese. When you use fresh young squash, you really don't need the sugar. I didn't want it with a sage flavor, or celery and I can't eat much cheese. Still, the recipe came out Fantastic! This is a good recipe, now that I made my changes we will have this recipe often, great with baked chicken, baked pork chops! Thanks for this great recipe, your Nana was a good cook.....and we have to honor our Nana's for the loving women they were.

Love this. I used poultry seasoning instead of sage because that’s what I had. Next time I think I’ll add another cup of squash. Served with pinto beans because that’s how we roll in Texas. Everyone ate too much.

I made it my own by dialing back the amount of cheese and I used stuffing mix instead of cornbread.  I like the flavor the stuffing gave it and am trying again but this time with Savory Herbs stuffing.  I did not want to lose the essence of the squash.  The funny thing is I DO NOT like squash.  This is a nice dish.  The one major thing I did not do is pre cook the squash.  It will be well cooked as it is baked.  No need to cook first...I don't like soggy veggies.

Due to time restrictions and not planning in advance to make this dish, I was forced to sub toasted grain bread for the cornbread. I used 2 huge squash which came to about 2 1/2 cups. I also mashed them a little as my husband likes his that way. The dish is different and a nice alternative to our usual microwave squash-leftover and turned to casserole. By the way, I did bake a batch of cornbread -to freeze for the future, while I worked on other preparations.

I thought this was very good! I found it when searching for a way to make use of a failed attempt whole wheat cornbread (super dry and crumbly!) and stumbled on this gem! The sage definitely reminds me of Thanksgiving and cornbread stuffing! I made it before I read the reviews where the recipe contributor says she meant 2 c. cooked squash, not 2 c. chopped squash, so I used two decent sized squash and got 2 c. chopped, but next time with use 3 squash, which will probably be 2 c. cooked as the original recipe intends. I'll probably also cut the butter down to 1/4 c. just based on my family's preferences, but overall this recipe is definitely going into my regular rotation!! So good!

I've made this a lot in the last few months with the following changes:
- leave out the margarine, sage and salt
- use Jiffy cornbread
- add 1 large shredded carrot
- add Tony's creole seasoning to give it a little more flavor.

Everyone in the family eats it, including my 6 & 9 year old.
