This was pretty tasty, but incredibly runny.  Perhaps it was the salsa I used.  I won't be making it again.

I wanted to make a quick and easy dip for the super bowl, so I decided to make this one needless to say it was a BIG hit with the family. Thanks for sharing it.

I don't care for olives or guacamole so this recipe was PERFECT!  Delicious!
