I made these for Thanksgiving this year. The only thing I changed is I used fresh green beans instead of frozen. Everyone loved them!

I couldn't get into this recipe. The bacon taste seemed to dominate the entire dish although that could be attributed to the type of bacon I used. But the cheese sauce was most disappointing - I expected the mixture to be coated in the creamy sauce but instead all the cheese settled at the bottom of the serving dish. I happened to mention that the recipe was called "Cheesy Green Beans" and my husband said "They had cheese in them?" Won't be trying this again.

I loved this recipe! This was cut in half (for 5 instead of 10) substituted a handful of dried mushrooms (on hand) for fresh reduced the onion to 1/4 cup and substituted 1/2 shredded colby/jack cheese (on hand). The flavors of the bacon & onion and cheese with the green beans was awesome!

This is a good holiday dish. I used fresh green beans and they tasted great but took a long time to prepare.

Great!! The only change I made was using velveeta block cheese instead of jarred cheese. This dish was wonderful.

I highly recommend using fresh green beans and a cheese sauce that's not processed. That being said this was OK. I'm not against processed cheese it's just that I don't care for the flavor of it. There are good cheese sauces on this site. So next time - and there will be a next time - I will use fresh green beans and a homemade cheese sauce.
