So good!!  These cookies have always been a favorite and I happened to eat one at Subway the other day and it sent me on a mission to find a great recipe--and this is it!  They are the best looking and tasting cookies I've ever made.  Next time I will take them out a little sooner than I think they should--to make a softer cookie but even though I don't like cookies on the crispy side I love these!  I'm so glad I tried this recipe first!  I've made cookies with white chocolate chips before and the chopped white chocolate bar/almond bark makes a big difference!

The best cookies I've ever made...we ate a whole sheet of them that night! I used baking powder instead of soda by accident and omitted the nuts.I also didn't chill the dough and even with minor changes they came out great.We took them out when the edges started to brown and they were perfect, I even overcooked one batch by 3-4 minutes and they were still very good.

This cookie was excellent!! Here's an idea for this recipe too: add in 10 oz. of Ghirardelli White Chocolate chips (instead of other white chocolate component) and add about 1 tbs. of fine grounds of macadamia nuts! It is delicious! Kids have fun making them too!

A very good recipe for White Chocolate Chunk and Macadamia cookies!  I baked them 10-12 minutes to make them more chewy, rather than on the crispy side.

These are awesome. I use less than 10 ounces of chocolate... because that just seems excessive in relation to the amount of dough. I used 8 ounces this time. Whenever a recipe says to chill for on hour, I chill overnight. It doesn't hurt and it usually helps by making the cookies spread out less. Chilling overnight might help those who say they turned out too flat. I have made them twice and everyone loves them. Way better than the Subway ones, which I love!

My family loved these cookies...they did spread a little too much for my liking but that is b/c I missed the part about chilling the dough first.

I tried this recipe and the cookies tasted great, but they were much too thin and frail.  They tended to fall apart when removing from the cookie sheet.

Great tasting cookie! Came out flat though. I chilled the dough for one hour as suggested, but next time I might chill longer. Also, baked for 10 minutes and the cookies came out soft and chewy -- just perfect!

Excellent cookie!  I've been searching for the perfect soft cookie that's not too cakey.  This is it.  Chewy perfection.  I didn't chill the dough and took them out at 14 mins (even though they looked underdone).

The are perfect.

Out of 5 stars I would give this recipe a ten. The dough seemed a little bit different and sticky but the end result was amazing! This is now officially my favorite cookie recipe ever!

Made these for the first time for Christmas and everyone LOVED them. They are very good but very sweet. I personally may cut back on the amount of chips I put in but my mother-in-law told me to not change the recipe at all! I did find placing them on non-stick cookie sheets and not greasign them worked better too.

Wowza! I used walnuts and white chocolate chips instead of macadamia nuts and white chocolate chunks, only because of what I had on hand already. I am impatient and only stuck them in the freezer for maybe 10 minutes. I don't really care that these are on the flatter side, they look fabulous and taste yummy. I'm making another batch of these for Christmas cookie trays!

These are so good!!!  I think someone still needs to share a solution to the flat cookie, but still ..taste good so who cares. I was trying to copy "The great american cookie" store and their white choc. mac. cookies I added a couple drops of almond exract and they were sooooo good!!!! If you try this be sure you are only using a couple of drops!! almond extract is very strong!

Absolutely delicious. Home and work really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to omit the nuts, (family request). But they were still delicious! Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous!  Our small town only has one grocery store and it didn't have macadamia nuts so I used 1 cup pecans (untoasted)and they tasted great. My package of white chocolate chunks was 12 oz. instead of ten ounces and I used all of it.  This was an instant family favorite.

Excellent recipe!  Here's a twist:  intensify the flavor of the macadamias -- grind up about a 1/3 c. and add to the dough!

These cookies were amazing! I didn't have white chocolate or macadamia nuts so I used smarties but other than that followed the recipe exactly.
They were crisp on the edges but nice and chewy...almost exactly like a Subway cookie in terms of flavour and texture!

Was awesome! Made some substitutes myself...I'm not a fan of shortening so used butter and used a full cup, then added coconut extract instead of vanilla(all I had on hand) and added chunks of my sons left over white easter bunny and lastly shredded coconut mixed in...was super yummy, my husband ate most of one pan.

Wow - makes incredible cookies that stay formed and have some lift.  I doubled the recipe, added an additional egg and one small box instant vanilla pudding.  Used what I had in the cupboard as far as chocolate - semi-sweet chunk, milk chocolate and white chocolate.  Really sweet but really good.  Had to cook for 16 minutes and they ended up the crisp, chewy cookies that I love.  This is my new go-to recipe.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because the cookies came out flat as opposed to the thicker chewier texture you get from subway. In terms of taste its great! Everyone loved them. I used ghiradelli white chocolate chips and toasted chopped hazelnuts instead! Worked just as well!

I just bakes these and they turned out terrific! I like the crisp outside with the soft inside. If you want a softer cookie, then use a regular milk chocolate chip cookie recipe, and just add the white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. Personaly, I loved this recipe, the consistancy of the cookie is perfect with the white chocolate flavor and the distinctive crunch of the macadamias.

Just finished baking a double batch of these cookies and I have to say... They are great!..
They are easy to mix up and if you can keep everyone from eat the cookie dough....you have enough cookies for a couple of days. 
These are better than the brand name ones I've been eating for years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great cookies! -YUM-! The best and easiest recipe. I add a little coconut to them too and they add a little moistness. But they're already good even without it!
Thank you, Donna!

I honestly am just on here because I can't focus on biology anymore and I really really really really love cookies. This cookie looks really good. I would make it but I'm a broke college kid :(.
Maybe when I become super famous. I plan on becoming the next Justin Bieber. Now it's a work in process right now, but like my good friend said "Impossible is just an opinion". But anyways that's besides the point. Since these look really good I'll give you a 5 star. I wish there was a 10 star rating on this. Then people would really know if this is good or not, you know what I mean? Have you ever thought of becoming a chef? I think you could do it because you have your own recipe. I mean that's a start isn't it?

I doubled the recipe and got 60 cookies.  I used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar, and still very sweet.  Also used one 10 ounce bag of Ghirardelli classic white chips, 1 cup of chopped pecans, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract.   Used 1-1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder.   Also baked for only 10 minutes and they were perfect.  One of the best cookies I've ever made!  Also they spread so I used parchment paper instead of greasing.   I will make these again and again.

This is the closest I've ever followed a recipe. The only thing I different was to freeze the shaped cookies for another 30 minutes. I set for ten minutes based on another review but they needed another 3 minutes. Non-sweets loving hubs loved them!

Absolutely delicious! Got rave reviews. I did, however, use Demerara sugar instead of white, white chocolate chips instead of chunk; and I baked them 10 minutes.

This is now one of my favorite cookies. the recipe is easy to make and the cookies come out great.  Followed the recipe exactly and the cookies came out just fine for me. I did add a little more of the macadamia nuts than it called for.

W3hite chocolate chunk are my favorite cookies.  I loved this recipe.  I took them to a cookie swap and people loved them!  I took the extra to work and once a couple people tasted them the actually ran (literally) to the break room to try and snag the last ones.  I didn't change a thing.

Awesome.  I did not have any problems with them being flat.  I used slightly less shortening than called for based on the reviews about them being very greasy.  I will make again!

Simply delicious.  I can't stop eating them, will surely make some more.  I used light brown sugar (that's what I had) and they came out very light in color...I didn't like it so next time I will stick with the regular brown sugar!  Thanks for sharing.

Really good cookies....made them as part of our Super Bowl munchies & they were a hit with everyone.  I cooked them a little less, as others stated, to make them chewy rather than crunchy.  Very rich & delicious!

Excellent, moist cookie!  I have been searching for a white chocolate/macadamia bar cookie, so I made these into bars.  I undercooked them by a couple of minutes and let them completely cool in the pan before cutting.  Very rich and good.

These were okay. Too rich in my opinion and I agree that the texture was off.

These cookies were excellent.  I've made them twice to rave reviews.  I substituted milk chocolate chips, but otherwise made no changes.

I have made this recipe a dozen times now, and it's the same every time: absolutely delicious. It's time-consuming, but so very worth it. I highly recommend using coarsely chopped ounce-size bars of white chocolate over a bag of white chocolate chips. My only change is that I usually use a full cup of macadamias, since they're so good. My brother-in-law said "Better than Subway!"

I have searched for an easy recipie and this was it.  Perfect consistency, and I skipped the macadamia nuts, too.  I cooked them a little less than recommended because I like chewy cookies.  Great recipie!

This recipe wasn't bad, but my cookies reminded me more of a sort of shortbread consistency. I was hoping for more of a soft cookie like Subway's. I don't think I'd make this particular one again.

I added a whole jar (6.5 oz) of macadamia nuts instead of just 1/2 a cup and it turned out really yummy!
