I guess I was expecting more. They weren't bad, just not anything exceptional. I can put onions and bacon on top of my burger with A LOT less work. I didn't like the flavor of the onion soup mix in this at all. And I use onion soup mix in other recipes. Everyone agreed these were just ok. I made 5 huge balls of burger, then seperated in halves, it occured to me that I could have left them whole and stuck in my thumb and hollow out a "pocket" to fill then seal, with less effort. Just an idea.

This was a hit with DH!  I made this for 2 servings, but made 3 burgers with it.  Make sure to really flatten the burgers out so they don't come out round on the grill.

I'm always looking for ways to liven up hamburgers.  This was great!  My husband and dad just loved them.  They couldn't get enough.  Just a note... they are huge hamburgers.  Not for the faint of heart.

Yum!  These were a lot of fun and a big hit w/the fam.  I actually got the recipe off of the food network and looked it up on here and it was exactly the same.  You can add whatever you want to the stuffing.  We just did bacon, cheddar cheese and onions.  Some people mentioned that they will just add stuffing to the burger after its been cooked next time b/c it was too much work to stuff.  Whats the fun in that though???

These were amazing! So simple to make and yet they got the big thumbs up. I was impressed at how well they held their shape and the bacon inside the burger was a great-tasting touch. I have already had requests to make these again.

I used this recipe to make stuffed mac-n-cheese burgers and they were awesome! I followed this recipe almost exactly (I used less meat per burger, I used 1.65 lbs for 6 burgers which were probably a little on the small side, but I think you can easily get 6-8 burgers out of 2 lbs.) and I made Kraft's adult macaroni & cheese to put in the middle. I probably used less bacon because of he addition of the macaroni (I wanted left overs for an egg bake) but I just mixed the two together and they were delicious! Also I don't have a grill so I broiled the burgers which worked just fine. Thanks "Mom" for this amazing stuffed burger recipe! :)

I didn't use the onion mix in the hamburger, just salt and pepper.  Inside, I put the bacon, raw green onions (mild, no need to sauté),  lightly sautéed shredded potato (idea from Game Day Hamburgers recipe), and some shredded cheese.  All kinds of variations possible, though.  It was raining, so cooked them in a skillet.  Delicious!  Can't wait to surprise the kids with this!

I halved this recipe for just two, but did 5 pieces of bacon.  Had a LITTLE extra after stuffing them, but it was DELISH!  I will definitely be making these again.  I tried making the patties pretty thin so the burgers wouldn't be so big, but I didn't really have any luck with that.  Great recipe though.

I only had 1 1/2 pounds of ground sirloin.  I already had bacon left over from breakfast so sauteed the onion in a skillet sprayed with Pam.  I cannot eat a huge burger like the recipe calls for so I cut up the bacon and added it and the onion into the meat mixture. I made 7 burgers out of the 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef and they were the perfect size for my family.  They were YUMMY.  Hubby and son loved them.

A pretty good burger, but way to big if you don't make the patties very flat. By the time they were done the outside was a bit charred. Next time I think I would just combine everything and make them one patty burgers.
