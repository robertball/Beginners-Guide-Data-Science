This was delicious! It made a LOT of stew, and took a long time with the IP because of the waiting for pressure to build and release. But it was worth it!

Delicious. Didn't change a thing. Next time I will probably add two bags of frozen vegetables though.

I jumped at reading about this recipe in anticipation of a chicken pot pie type recipe that would be Diabetic friendly as the title suggested.

I was disappointed when I learned it had egg noodles in replace of crust which would be even more unhealthy than the crust in it replaced.

Luckily I think the recipe in and of itself is quite tasty sounding and I can replace the egg noodles with cauliflower and make this a rather diabetic friendly recipe

This was  very good but we felt it needed more flavor. Next time I'm going to try adding more cream of chicken soup or possibly a cube of chicken bouillon or even a pouch of ramen noodle chicken flavoring to the liquid. I think  we will substituted chicken seasoning for the italian and cover the noodles with more chicken stock and not water. I might also something to thicken the remaining broth so noodles do not continue to  to soak up the broth. I certainly am not an expert at cooking anything but we did feel it needed something more to be closer to an actual  flavor of a chicken pot pie.

I followed the recipe as directed. Was short of having 2 lbs of chicken plus my dog showed up out of nowhere when I shredded the chicken.  I will make this again.  It is delicious and my husband and daughter both gave it a thumbs up!  Thanks for sharing I just got my instant pot.

Better than I expected! Was incredibly delicious, even my pickiest of picky eater loved it. I will definitely make this again. I substituted crushed garlic for the garlic powder and added cut up carrots and celery in addition to the frozen veggies. So good!!

Followed the recipe except used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken soup (no chicken soup in cupboard).  My husband loved it.  The noodles turned out perfect!!  I will definitely make it again.  Thank you!!
