Easy and tasty.  I used sun-dried tomatoes in oil (drained and chopped) and it tasted fine.  I like feta so I added a lot more, used the whole can of olives and used probably 12 oz of the dressing.  Come to think of it, I used more green onions too.  Hey, a pound of pasta is a lot.  Instead of black beans I think garbanzo beans would be a complementary flavor.  I don't know where the "spicy" comes in as it's not spicy, but it is very good.

Well, first off, this salad is not spicy at all. The recipe calls for way too much pasta, in relation to the other ingredients. The end result was very dry, causing me to have to add more dressing right before serving. I made this for a big family dinner, and it was not a big hit. Things I would do differently - - - less pasta or more veggies, LOTS more dressing, sliced black olives, not chopped (they clung together), and no black beans. These were picked out by almost everyone who tried it.

My husband and I both liked this recipe.  I actually thought that 16 oz. of the dressing was alot...as opposed to the last review.  I omitted the olives and used yellow onion instead.  This dish tastes better a few days after it has been made.

Very tasty. However, it was not spicy so I added some red pepper flakes.  I also only used 1/2 the dressing called for and it was plenty. Versatile recipe that can be worked with.

I loved this recipe and have made it several times. I prefer it with seashell pasta since all the ingredients get more blended together that way. I also used only about 1/2 the salad dressing called for and that's plenty.

Everyone loved it!  My father-in-law made Thanksgiving dinner all by himself, and when I asked if I could bring something, he said 'pasta salad', so I used this recipe.  Three people asked for the recipe, and the leftovers got eaten by my kids the next day...they were actually ANGRY when there was none left!  Thanks!

This recipe is truly delicious, and I'm a pasta salad connoisseur. I agree with the other reviewers -- not spicy, but still very tasty. Would definitely recommend!

This is a pretty good recipe, but I have to say that I used an 8 oz bottle of dressing and that was enough!  Where did the "spicy" come from - not spicy, but tasty.  So how about we call it Tasty Pasta Salad!  I think I would have used more of amost everything except the noodles and will the next time I make this!

I made this for a potluck and it was good.  I used the shells per another review (so-so), and I only used a 1/2 bottle of the dressing. I had some Jalapeno salad dressing that really had a kick, so I threw some of that in and it did spice it up.  The beans are very good addition.

I added corn, cayanne and avacado just before serving and made my own dressing. I also topped it with crumbled bacon.

VERY YUMMY!! I don't like olives or onions, so I left those out. I added extra feta and sun dried tomatoes though. This was a big hit with the family!!  Perfect for summer picnics! It's a really easy salad to throw together!!!

Not bad, simple pasta salad. I didn't add the whole bottle of Italian dressing either.

This is a nice little pasta dish.  I used fusilli pasta, as that is what I had on hand.  Also, omitted the olives, due to personal taste.  The feta cheese adds a nice bit of saltiness to the recipe without making it too salty.  Will be a nice summer salad as it contains no mayonnaise. This recipe has been "faceless" since April 2001, glad I could add a picture.
