This was our Thanksgiving dessert and EVERYONE thought it was a HUGE success. From our two year old grandson (who pulled up a stepstool in the kitchen so he could help himself) to my 60 year old husband and everyone in between!
This will become a staple at holiday meals. Some had their with whipped cream and some with frozen vanilla yogurt while some had one topping with the first serving and the other with the second.
I did not add the the raisins (due to family preferences) or the last three spices and we were totally thrilled with the results.
Oddly enough I found this recipe on msn.com but could not find it on allrecipes.com!?

I thought it was a good recipe.  I followed the recipe as is.  The only thing I did wrong was that I did not put the dish in the fridge before serving it.  I noticed the dish tasted so much better after letting in sit in the refrigerator overnight.  I guess that helped all of the ingredients to settle.   If you enjoy pumpkin I would recommend this recipe.

Made this for the family tonight and everybody loved it! Even though my daughter had said she was full she had 2 helpings. I didn’t have the molasses but otherwise followed the directions to a tee. Thanks for the great recipe!

The only change I made was I didn't use the condensed milk as I didn't want it sweeter so I used evaporated milk instead and it came out perfect! I will make this again!!

Thanks so much for the raisin tip!  I had really old raising and the extract/microwave trick revived them completely!  I used about a cup of raisins, and 2 t. maple extract.  I only had about 1/4 t. of rum extract on hand.  I enjoyed the lasting maple flavoring on the raisins. In terms of other substitutions: pkg of 12 hot dog buns for french bread; half & half for milk; no pumpkin; no molasses; nutmeg for allspice. I also threw in 1/2 c. of cinnamon toast crunch to put over the top.

Turned out great! Whole family loved it. I didn’t really use any variations besides leaving out the rum flavoring, (too expensive) and I used fresh pumpkin purée instead of the canned option. Overall I don’t think it changed much, the pudding was still very tasty! Saving this recipe to make again in the future!

I used pumpkin bread that I had made instead of french...it was a good way to use the leftover pumpkin bread and I enjoyed the spices that game through in this pudding recipe.

I made this recipe 3 times since last Sunday and it  was a HUGE hit with my family and friends. We are all pumpkin lovers and this recipe will be one I will be doing frequently for family gatherings during the fall and holidays. The only thing I didn't follow in the recipe is the raisin mixture since my children and I are not huge fans of raisins mixed with pumpkin.

This was a hit at my family's thanksgiving, and it's excellent for breakfast leftovers! Served with pecan/caramel ice cream hot out of the oven, it was delicious. Next time, will add more raisins.

The texture was perfect. The taste was not what I was hoping for.

Bread puddings are my favorite kinds of desserts.  This recipe doesn't disappoint.  The combination of pumpkin with the bread pudding is perfect for a warm fall dessert.

This was so easy to make and was so delicious.  Try serving it with vanilla or caramel ice cream.  YUM!
