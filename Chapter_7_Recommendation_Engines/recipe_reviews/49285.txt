This was absolutely amazing! I was a bit skeptical of a couple of the ingredients  - namely the caraway seeds - but it all worked really well. The only changes I made were to use ghee instead of oil, jalapeno instead of serrano, and I omitted the asafoetida powder as I can't find it anywhere. I ended up adding a few more cardamon pods (some black, some green) just because I love the flavor. I made it with kidney beans as I love the color, and prefer the texture over the other suggested beans. Thanks so much, Kay!

A wonderful dish that won rave reviews from our guests! I served it as a side with salmon in coconut milk and naan, but this superb dish offers rich and complex flavors, and deserves to be an entree on its own -- perhaps with saffron rice; or add vegetable broth to make a savory stew. Advice to cooks: If some exotic spices are hard to find, try hard to find at least the fennel seeds and especially the cardamom pods (or seeds -- but NOT ground cardamom). One of the best discoveries I've made on AllRecipes.com!

Delish!  Envy of the lunch room the next day.  I didn't have a fresh chile on hand, so I used 1/8 tsp (maybe more like 1/4 tsp) of cayenne pepper.  I also crunched up the whole spice seeds a bit with a mortar and pestle.  Oh! and I used cannelini beans (again, on hand).  Definite repeat.

This recipe is very good. You can also use either boiled and diced carrot or potato as a substitute for the beans or even some boiled green peas.

I made this with black-eyed peas for New Year's Day, and I will definitely make this one again.  I substituted bagged cole slaw mix for the shredded cabbage, which made it extremely quick and convenient.

I enjoyed this one quite a bit!  I was actually looking for a recipe to use up some cabbage and fennel seeds, so I almost passed this one by as I did not have some of the other ingredients.  I did not have fenugreek seeds or asafoetida powder, and used ground cumin and coriander instead of the seeds/pods, and yellow ground mustard instead of black mustard seeds.  Of course, not exactly the same recipe, but still a delicious alternative to the average fried cabbage recipes.  I opted for the kidney beans which made this a really pretty dish - the green/white cabbage, a bit of yellow from the spices and deep red beans.  Looking forward to picking up the missing spices and making this one as stated some time!

This was a great, easy side dish.  I would reduce the salt to 3/4 tsp next time, but I don't feel the saltiness ruined the dish this time.  It was great served with an indian-spiced ground beef skillet dish served with peas and brown rice.  An easy, healthy supper.

I followed this recipe exactly except that I used a cauliflower instead of a cabbage. I love Indian food, but there was at least one spice in there that I didn't like the flavor of.  Honestly, I am not sure which spice it was because I have never cooked with many of the spices in the recipe before.

This was good, though I have to say I didn't have all the spices.  I added what I had then added some extra hot curry powder.  I picked this recipe because I had some extra cabbage left over.  It's a great use for that, but I don't think I'll buy the ingredients just for this recipe.

This is pretty tasty.  If I make it again, I will use butter, not canola oil, as I think the dish will have a better flavor and mouth feel.  I didn't have some of the spices, so I used Madras brand curry powder in addition to the ones I had, as it has them all.  Next time I think I'll just use the powder alone.  I also crushed/mixed all the spices in my mortar & pestle to get them to blend better.

Beautiful dish. I crushed the whole seed spices a bit with a mortar and pestle. I also used ghee in place of oil.

This recipe is wonderful! We had it for dinner with sides of cumin-rice and spicy carrots. I made it with most all the spices subbing only olive oil for canola and yellow mustard seeds for the black mustard seeds. I cut the fenugreek & mustard seeds to 1/2 tsp as I was afraid it may be too bitter. Do leave the seeds whole, I left them whole and it's fantastic that way! I've just ordered black mustard seeds so I can make this again the right way, also trying with correct amounts of fenugreek as well. Fabulous dish, we all loved it! Thank you for this recipe!

I made this for our families annual ethnic Christmas dinner a couple of years ago.  This year we are doing our "best of" out of all of our previous years ethic dinners, and it was requested again.  I used garbanzo beans for mine, and substitutes were maple syrup for the fenugreek, onions and chives for the asafoetida, and regular mustard for the black mustard.

Loved it, used beans I had on hand.  I do have the Asafoetida this is also know in India as Hing,  This is used to prevent gas. I found it at Spice World.  Very important for me when I eat Beans or other foods.   I use it all the time, smells bad but only a pinch is used and I do not find it effects the flavor.   I love the spicy in this recipe.   Thank you

This was excellent. im giving 4stars because i changed it a little. left out the asafoetida, cumin seed, hot pepper and lime juice coz i didnt have any. used 1teaspn ground cumin and 1teaspn chilli powder instead. i also didnt use salt but added a vegetable buillion cube. i cooked it a little differently too. fried up the cabbage first and added a chopped carrot too. then removed the vegetables from the pan and added the spices which i fried for 1minute. then i added the veg back and poured in the beans. left it to simmer for 15minutes. i served it with rice but indian bread would be good too.

This is a great way to use up that half a head of cabbage you have in the crisper as well as some of those more exotic spices that you don't use much (fenugreek seeds!). I made it without the asefetida  because I didn't have any. The dish was tangy and creamy all at the same time.  I will definitely be making this again.
