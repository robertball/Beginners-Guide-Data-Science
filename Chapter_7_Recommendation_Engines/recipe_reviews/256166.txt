This is excellent, and a lot less sugar than the store bought stuff. I think I may put bit of a kick to it next time, since I like a bit of spice.

I made this today and WOW! I used 2 cloves of minced garlic, and a dash of molasses as well. I mixed with the cuisine hand mixer to completely incorporate the minced garlic. It came out a little thin, so I added 1tsp of cornstarch and let it simmer for 2 min on the stove. That thickened it up well.

1.3.17 Will cut back a bit on the soy sauce in the future. The one thing that wasn t quite right about this was the consistency. Hoisin sauce s texture is much thicker. You need a spoon to get hoisin sauce out of a jar but you can pour this. I did add a bit more peanut butter in an effort to thicken it a bit and that helped a little. This will work in a pinch and was pretty good with a stir-fried beef and veggie dish for lunch.

Much better than processed, junk-filled sauce from the store. I subbed molasses for the brown sugar, and used rice wine vinegar. After tasting (and rating) the recipe as written, I adjusted to suit my family's taste, as follows: added a couple teaspoons chili-garlic sambal, a pinch of chinese 5-spice, and a lil extra vinegar. This gave it the kick I needed. Yummy! Total keeper. Next time I'll make a bigger batch and keep it handy.

I used this for a wonton soup recipe it was very good and used ingredients I had on hand. I ony had natural peanut butter so the sauce wasn't smooth but that was fine. For the Chinese hot sauce and black pepper I used Sambal Oleck instead. I would defintely use again when I need Hoisin sauce instead of buying. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #LunarNewYear

It didn’t taste anything like hoisin sauce, surprisingly. This was actually pretty similar to peanut sauce, however, another popular Vietnamese/Thai dipping condiment.

Did just what they said, yield is more like 1/3 cup.  It's fairly salty, so I used lite soy and will lower the salt called for in the stir fry recipe.  Great flavor!!

I was skeptical, but in a COVID pinch, so tried it for lettuce wraps. Turned out great! And felt more natural, less MSG-like. I think I’ll make my own fro here on out. Thanks!

Made 1/2 of the recipe and it yielded about 4 tablespoons which I used in a recipe for Asian dressing on a salad.  If you keep whisking, it gets thicker.

I make this every time I make stir-fry. It's perfect to cook in with all the veggies and meat and spoon it over rice. Another stir-fry staple is yum-yum sauce A.K.A. Japanese white sauce. Cook your stir fry in hoisin sauce squirt it all over with yum-yum and Sriracha and you'll never need to go to the restaurant for that Japanese steak house flavor again:)

I made this recipe as I needed it to make crock pot general Tso chicken. I like it a lot. I have never tasted it before or made it. Therefore I rated the recipe 4 stars as I don;t know if there are better recipes. I will make this again but will also try other recipes to see if there is a difference. I might add more fresh ginger another time. I added more peanut butter as i read one review that said she like the sauce thicker.

Extremely salty and tastes nothing like hoisin sauce. Added honey and it is ok but still not good.

I didn't have any dark brown sugar or sesame oil so I used light brown sugar and peanut oil. I think it came out just fine.

I used minced garlic and chilli sauce and molasses in place of brown sugar. Turned out great. My husband enjoys it with canned salmon on top of his stir-fry.

This is perfect Since I do not normally have Chinese 5 spice  that is normally in hoisin sauce. Did substitute dark brown sugar with light brown sugar and replaced the hot sauce and garlic ingredients with 2 tsp of chili garlic sauce. Whisked all ingredients together in a small sauce pan on medium-low heat until thick and smooth. Added 1 tablespoon of this hoisin sauce to my homemade General Tsao’s sauce. Definitely keeper and don’t have to buy it again. This hoisin sauce is perfect for chicken and broccoli if you want that authentic takeout taste! Yum

I substituted tahini (sesame paste) instead of peanut butter, teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar (all to taste). I put it on white fish (haddock and cod) covered and baked it @425°F for 10-15 (till flaked). 
It had a lovely Asian/Mediterranean fusion flavor served with rice, sweet potatoes and a Waldorf salad with raisins.  Yum!
