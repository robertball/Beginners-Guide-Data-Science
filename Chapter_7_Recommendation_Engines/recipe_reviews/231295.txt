My dad used to make this pie. When he passed away, the recipe went MIA. I was so pleased to find a recipe! It turned out amazingly delicious!

About cooking the caramels: cook these over low heat, and stir them almost constantly. If you don't, they can burn and stick. Remove the pan immediately from heat as soon as the caramels are almost melted. When I baked the pie the entire middle was completely uncooked and oozed all over the place. I think the heat should be 350, not 325.

Great pie! I will definitely make again, but I would like it a little bit sweeter and some extra caramel. I served it with ice cream and it was a hit!
