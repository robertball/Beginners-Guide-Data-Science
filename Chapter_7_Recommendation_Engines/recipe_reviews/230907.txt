This recipe was super easy and delicious.  I used a variety of apples (Red Delicious, Granny Smith and Mackintosh) and left a little skin to identify the apple and this works for any type of apple.  I instead of 2 tablespoons of cinnamon, I used 1 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon and with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon, I was little nutmeg, allspice and ginger. My husband and kids loved it as a side for breakfast.

This is my mother's recipe as well.  I have grown up on these fried apples.  As I got older and more health conscious, I began substituting apple juice for the butter.  Still delicious!

This was my first attempt at fried apples, and it was horrible.  I think the recipe had a typo.  Perhaps the two tablespoons of cinnamon should have been two teaspoons.  It may be a while, but I may try it again in the future.

These apples were delicious.  The recipe is easy and the ingredients are usually readily available.  Great side dish for any meal.

I would highly recommend a particular type of cinnamon. It is called Ground Saigon Cinnamon. It has a strong cinnamon flavor. If this is to strong try Ground Ceylon cinnamon, from Sri Lanka. It is awesome as well. I didn't realize what a difference these could make in traditional dishes.

I just tried this tonight and it was fabulous.  So easy.  So few ingredients.  So delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter but used a bit less butter and also a little less sugar.  I think it would be just as good if not better with half the sugar.  I also added less cinnamon, added a few shakes of salt, and just a tad of cornstarch/water mixture... about a teaspoon cornstarch to about a tablespoon water, and this thickened the mixture a bit without making it gloppy or pasty.  I want to make this every day for the next few weeks it was so good!

This was great stuff. I made it exactly as written. Since I'd never made anything like it before, though, I didn't know quite what to do with it, but I read the "breakfast" suggestion and ate it served on top of frozen waffles that I had popped into the toaster - the combination worked very well. This lasted me for 4 breakfasts, and the reheated leftovers were almost as good as fresh. When I ate this, it took me a while to remember where I'd eaten something like this before, then it struck me - this is the same kind of "cinnamon apples" that is one of the side-dish choices I've gotten at restaurants like barbecue joints. Easy and tasty, and worth recommending.

I halved the recipe and added 2 dashes of salt. The apples were perfect! My Son thought I had spent a lot of time! He pronounced the dish as addictive. Great recipe!

Made these tonight for dinner. Me and my husband really enjoyed them. My husband said they were better than a restaurant he likes. I did cut down on the cinnamon. I was afraid it would overwhelm the taste of the apples. They reminded me of when I was a kid. Will be making these often!  Thank you!

That much cinnamon would kill me.  I use 1 tsp. and everybody loves it.  I also add a pinch of nutmeg.  During the apple season, we have a bowl of this in the fridge all the time.  Good on anything.  I have Golden Glow and Harelson apple trees.  They both work great.

Amazing! Especially when served alongside pork chops! I used half white sugar, and half brown sugar, and I think that added another layer of flavor. Will definitely makes this again. (forgot to add, the apples I used were too old to use fresh, but they turned out great in this recipe)

My grandma made fried apples throughout my childhood and beyond. Her apples had less cinnamon but could be adjusted to your own taste. This is a great place to start because my husband likes a more intense cinnamon flavor. Whichever way you like these apples either loaded with cinnamon or not your family will love these!

I have fixed this recipe for years. It is so simple, yet so divine! And it cooks up so quickly that it's a cinch to fix in a pinch! It's especially great for a special breakfast treat. It tastes great as a topping on pancakes and waffles, as a special side dish with dinner, or as a 'healthier than most' dessert.

Way too much cinnamon for me.  I listened to some of the other reviewers and halved the cinnamon and it was still too much.

I haven't tried it yet, but I will now for sure and USE my cast iron skillet. I was just kind of poking around, see if anyone peeled the apples, what kind they used, what kind if any sugar.. and I came across this! Sounds great.. going to go make it now.. will come back with a review. My daughter gave me the apples, so not sure what kind, they are red skinned (lol).. I'll do a rough peel, use my apple corer..go from there. TNX for all the help ladies!

Awesome recipe! I used bacon drippings (1/2 teaspoon)and dash of salt and brown sugar version. When the apples were broken down and cooked almost 3/4 of the way, I added 1/2 cup of organic granola with almond slivers. This gave the apples a texture and also absorbed a lot of the sauce giving it a cobbler effect in a way. I layered it on an open faced banana bread I made the day before (http://goo.gl/5Jf8Lq) and topped with a thin slice of cheddar cheese add a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side(sur le côté). I have been craving a cobbler lately and this was a great alternative.  I cooked it ALL in my ceramic coated cast iron dutch oven on the stove top. no oven needed. ( well except the banana bread) ...

I had 3 super large granny smith apples. Simply easy to follow, just make sure not to over do with the cinnamon. As is, was delish and 3 of my children that could eat apples, really liked them.

Thank you for this recipe.  It made my day!  I had a bag of small Macs on hand on a lazy fall Saturday and when my sweet tooth kicked in, I came upon this easy recipe.  I used 6 apples and 1 1/2 TBS cinnamon.  I may try the 2 spoons next time just to see if it improves on perfection.  Can't wait to share this dessert!

Great recipe!  Super easy.  Watch not to let the caramel get too hot to fast! Gets very sticky very quickly.. i made it a second time and served just as the sugar was completely melted and it was much smoother.

I made these fried apples for a big family breakfast the Saturday after Christmas. They were delicious and very easy to make. My sister talked me into using additional cinnamon -- she was happy but too much for me. Looking forward to preparing again but next time according to recipe. So glad I have more apples!! I encourage you to make these and don't listen to my sister. JP

I just made these fried apples to put over Cream Cheese Squares also on Allrecipes.com.  These were the easiest apples to make and they taste sooooo gooood!  My husband even told me to make up a batch to spoon over ice cream to make a sundae.  I bet a little caramel syrup would put it over the top.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

This is a lot like my Mother's recipe, though she used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  They kind of taste like home-made apple sauce, only better...

This is a great simple recipe. I did however use 2 very big honey crisp apples because that is all I use.  I used brown sugar and a tad of regular sugar but cut it in half.  Cut the butter by half as well. I ended up simmering the apples for about 30 minutes because that is where I found I like the tenderness of them.  The key is stirring every few minutes. Added a dash of cinnamon and it was perfect!  This made 4 servings.

Picked my own Granny Smiths fresh yesterday morning.  They were outstanding and any left over sauce is great on a piece of toast.  Great and easy recipe.  Will be trying it over a camp fire next weekend for breakfast

Turned out tasting good, but the sauce seemed a little dark, not sure why, but I followed the recipe to a T. I will be making it again..

I made an account solely to warn others about this recipe - I honestly can't believe it has 4.6 stars.

I made it exactly as listed, and there was way, way too much cinnamon. There was so much cinnamon it was actually gritty when you were eating it and the flavor was completely overpowering. I agree with the other reviewer who suggested that tablespoons might be a typo - if I were to try this again, I'd definitely use something more like two teaspoons...

Also, if I were to make it again, I'd probably try brown sugar, and I'd probably mix in some Gala apples or something with the Granny Smith (maybe 50/50) to cut back on the tartness of the apples a little bit. It was hard to tell with all the cinnamon, but this was a lot more sour than I expected, given how much sugar is in it.

Overall, I'm looking for a different recipe.

The recipe was more tart than I expected, although the tartness paired nicely over vanilla ice cream. Maybe I'll try a sweeter apple next time? I liked the buttery cinnamon sauce.

I didn't care for this recipe. The amount of cinnamon is too high. I should have read ChristineW's review first -- two teaspoons sounds about right, whereas two tablespoons was enough to immediately turn the butter-and-sugar mixture almost black. It's still edible, but since cinnamon is fibrous, it has a grainy texture that makes it rather less than pleasant to eat.

Definitely recommend the Granny Smith apples, not Red Delicious. I made it and it's way too sweet. You need the "bitterness" of the Granny Smith to counteract all the sugar and cinnamon. Next time, I'll try different apples and not so much sugar and cinnamon.

Our apple trees produced lots this year---my DH is tired of dried apples so I have bags of chopped apples in the freezer to use up.  Found this recipe and it's WONDERFUL!  Hello baked ham, breakfast oatmeal, apple cobbler, and everything else I can fix with these apples!  Thank you for an excellent recipe!

Good recipe, but I left the skin on the apples, sliced them horizontally instead of in wedges, and cooked them a little longer.  This is how I remember my mother cooked them.  Ken

Very good! I used honey crisp apples since that was what I had on hand, so I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. The recipe took the substitution very well. I would definitely recommend tasting as you go along to be sure you get the texture you like. This was excellent served by itself and over a pork roast!

This was amazingly easy and pretty tasty too!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out pretty good.  However, I think next time I will cut the cinnamon by half.  It was a bit too much for my taste.  Will make again!

Used gala apples and it was surprisingly great! Also used brown sugar instead of white, AND I ran out of cinnamon so had to sub some pumpkin pie spice with what I had. I do LOVE cinnamon so I’ll definitely be ready next time!! Thanks so much for the great recipe!!!

Never made fried apples before and truly, I only used the recipe as a guideline versus the rule. If you know anything about cooking and recipes, its all subjective to your taste preferences. Not really understanding all of the 1 stars saying there's too much sugar or too much cinnamon. I more than doubled the recipe and added cinnamon based on how it looked and it came out wonderful! Also used salted butter because its what I had on hand. The point here is,  the recipe Is a basis for how to make it. Next just make it according to your taste. Everyone has a head in between their shoulders. Its a matter of whether you use it or not.

I absolutely love apples and cooking with apples and I couldn't believe this recipe would really be so easy.  So happy to say I was wrong! Thanks so much for this quick and easy recipe!

Recipe is stupid simple and turned out great. Used a cast iron skillet and a mixture of granny Smith and gala apples. Did not peel them, I prefer the skin on. Used light brown sugar instead. Added cinnamon and nutmeg to taste.

Very good. I made it as instructed and would agree that you should cut the cinnamon in half. I'll try that next time and perhaps also try some nutmeg, allspice, ginger, etc. Might also try the dark brown sugar idea once.

I used red delicious apples, the full 1/2 c butter, 1/3c brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. I whisked in a bit of flour (a pinch) to thicken the sauce. If making as a side, be sure to give yourself time to peel, core, and slice your apples. They were really good overall!

We served these with Basic Crepes. Yummy! No changes to the recipe except I used a 4 Cups of  frozen apples from my apple tree. I would make it again, perhaps as a side to pork loin..... or maybe even chicken?

I used margarine instead of butter only because I didn't have any butter at the time. It tasted great! I will try it with butter another time.

I made this, but only used half the cinnamon it calls for (1 Tbsp) and added 1/4 tsp of ground cloves. Also, my apples were Jonathan. I thought it turned out very good and will definitely make it again!

Simple and delicious.  But after the first batch, I cut the sugar by half and the cinnamon down to one or two teaspoons (did not measure out).  I added a dash of ground cloves and allspice as well for the second batch.

Tastes just like apple pie! Suggestions for improvement: Use brown sugar, add a pinch of salt, use apple pie spice mix instead of just cinnamon, and at the very end, add vanilla extract, pour in a healthy dose of rum or brandy and flambe! Light with a lighter to burn off alcohol. Delicious and FAST

Absolute classic.  Mom used to use red apples and add raisins to hers; I recently made a tart version with a handful of dried cherries.  Can't go wrong with this dish when breakfast is for dinner.

Kids loved it. I cut the sugar and cinnamon in half since I was using sweet apples. I also used a dollop of caramel ice cream on top. I think the cinnamon may have been written incorrectly. Tops one tablespoon of cinnamon for the whole recipe.

Turned out well but it does better if you add in a bit of apple juice and less cinnamons

My son wanted me to make fried apples and this is the recipe I used. While it was delicious, I felt there was too much cinnamon. I will definitely be making some tweaks in the future. Like less cinnamon, more apples (there was A LOT of sauce leftover which my husband saved to pour over ice cream later) perhaps a pinch of salt...all things that others have suggested or tried. Not exactly a blue ribbon recipe in my book, but a good place to start.

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because I noted the obvious typo of 2 Tablespoons instead of teaspoons of cinnamon.  You only need 2 teaspoons.  With 2 teaspoons it is perfection.

I followed the suggestion made by another member and substituted brown sugar for the white. I cut the recipe in half because it seemed like a lot of apples, but totally should have made the whole recipe.

Very good! I made mine with brown sugar, but think that if these were made with white sugar, they would be like the ones in the lean cuisine turkey and apple meal. 

I did use less butter. About 1/4 cup total.

This tasted just like my grandmother's recipe .who told me she learned it from her grandmother.I have always used this as a "cleaning out the fridge recipe. I have also used other fruit with it, an orange, pear, leftover cranberry sauce, even last bit of applebutter or jam. Just about any fruit to clean out the fridge.

I was experimenting with an idea to have this as a filling inside of crescent rolls and the excess sauce as a drizzle once complete. Didn't realize this was a thing. My substitution consist of using organic honey over using white or brown sugar. I was beyond surprised. Seeing the reviews I see pancake or ice cream toppings as an option also.

I didn't use Granny Smith apples,  I used 2 different ones,  Gala and another one.  I don't remember the name of the other, but the Gala ones I used were quite large & juicy.   I left the peel on since that's how I'm use to having Fried Apples, and the turned out GREAT!  I had so much juice in the pan, along with just SOME of the apples ( I had to cook them in 2 batches), that I needed a baster to get some juice out so they could cook.  After the first batch was done, I just used the juice from them to cook the second batch.  Both were GREAT!  MY HUSBAND REALLY LIKED THEM TOO!

I did tweak this a bit since I used it as a filling for mini tarts. I used brown sugar instead of white, 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 of each nutmeg and allspice with a dash of vanilla. Sooo good. I will make this as is in the future when I have spare apples I need to use.  Wonderful recipe.

I changed the sugar to half white and half brown. Also I only had unsalted butter so I added a pinch of salt. It's a great gluten free dessert over ice cream.

I loved it! It was easy to make and didn't take long. I really enjoy sweet things so this is great for everyone who loves cinnamon and apples! I didn't use Granny Smith apples, instead, I used my real granny's apples which are smaller. My mum is going to try it when she comes home, because she knows I've got a thing for making sweets and cake. You really must try this!

Hoo-rah!! Just like Momma's!! I cut the cinnamon a bit (1T)because I doubled the recipe.  Almost used butter-flavored Crisco,(because that's what I saw Momma use), but I didn't want to mess with the recipe the first time I used it.  The butter definitely is fantastic with the apples.  Maybe Momma used butter flavored Crisco as a cost-saving measure? Don't know and can't ask now.  This will go into regular cooking rotation!

Simple, basic but spot on! The only change I made was swapping brown sugar for the white to get a little of that "carmel" flavor.

Love the rich buttery flavor from these apples. I did use less butter because a whole stick is just too rich for me but it was still delicious. I added more cinnamon then called for and I did put in some brown sugar as well and I am proud to say it will be making these again.

Great recipe! Sometimes I like to add a little cornstarch slurry (tablespoon or two of cornstarch mixed into about a quarter cup of water) to thicken the sauce up a bit more.  Delicious!

This dish is so simple to make and my grandchildren loved them. I didn't put 2 tablespoons of cinnamon because I didn't want the apples to dark, my boys are picky. I  definitely make this again and again

I didn't exactly follow the recipe because I only used two apples and I cut it in half, but it turned out good. This is the way my mom used to make it. Its one of those simple recipes where you only have to use it one. You can eyeball the ingredients and it's really simple to make.

I do think the 2 tablespoons of Ground Cinnamon are a bit much so I used only 1 and it turned out amazing!! Quick and easy!

An easy and quick sweet treat. This was perfect a perfect snack topped with some frozen whipped topping. I was surprised at how fast I ate this and wanted more! I substituted sweet-n-low for sugar to make it healthier.

So simple and delicious. I halved the recipe (for an ample single serving) and I used Ghee instead of traditional butter and coconut sugar instead of white sugar to make it a bit healthier. Turned out fantastic!

Basic and simple.  This is great when you buy that bag of apples and you just never quite eat them all before they start getting mushy. Peel em and fry em.  Voila', no waste and a different side.

Simple and fast; just what I need.  I realize it's just a matter of taste. but I used about 1 1/2 T. of cinnamon and a dash of salt.

Excellent! I sliced my apples pretty thick, and used dark brown sugar instead of white. Great as a side dish and as a snack!

This was wonderful, I made it for breakfast over pancakes and chicken sausage. Who doesn't like sausage and apples? I used 2 granny smith and 1 large honey crisp (it's fall y'all) left the skin on. I tried to make this a little less sinful by using a 1/2 cup of Truvia brown sugar and 1/2 cup of light butter. Pinch of salt and a little shy of 2TBSP cinnamon. I'm putting the rest of the apples over ice cream tonight!

This recipe was great! After reading other users' reviews, I decided to only use 1 tbsp of cinnamon. I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. This was absolutely perfect!  I'm looking forward to making this again!

I didn't have Granny Smith but used what I had on hand, Gala Apples.  It came out delicious!
