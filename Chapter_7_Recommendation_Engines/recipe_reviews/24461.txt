PLEASE READ!!  I strongly suggest using 1/2 cup apricot preserves in the batter instead of 1/4 cup.  1/4 cup still works fine for the frosting part though.  Also, near the end of her recipe it says to bake for 8-10 minutes but it should be 14 minutes.  I had fallen in love with these cookies when I first tried them years ago but didn't get the recipe at that time.  When I found it here I tried it and they were extremely bland..not at all like I remembered them.  After researching several other recipe sites I consistantly found the changes I've mentioned and my cookies are much improved.  Hope this helps.

Another good one from Beth! Being the apricot lover that I am, I had to try these. I'm so glad I did. They are so moist and yummy. I, too, increased the apricot and baked for 12 mins. Of course I frosted them!

I made this recipie low sugar by substituting Splenda and Splenda brown sugar and sugar free preserves. Its great with Raspberry, Strawberry, or Lemon Curd. I also used thiny cut slices of fruit leather to decorate the tops. The nurses at the hospital where I work just begged for the recipe, esp the ones on low carb diets.

This, I found as well, has the texture of a biscuit but is still rather moist inside.  I don't know how it would taste without the frosting, but I doubt most would care for it if one was looking for something in the cookie line.  Two children in my family wouldn't eat them, but the adults loved them.  I used pineapple/apricot preserves and that worked fine, but I will double the amount next time.  This recipe is also great because there are no eggs and not a lot of sugar, and I used low-fat cream cheese so it would be a little more healthy.

Delicious! I followed the advice of others and used double the amount of jam (peach.) These really are soft. The cream cheese adds a tangy flavor. Yum!

These are awesome cookies, but I also added more preserves.  I made a batch with no-sugar-added preserves, Splenda brown sugar blend in the cookies, and Splenda in the frosting...couldn't tell the difference.  I also topped them with julienned dried apricots on top.  Yummy!!!

These lasted for only a few minutes!  The moment they came out of the oven, everyone around wanted to try them because of the great aroma!  They keep really well (DEFINITELY soft and moist), and are good even without the frosting, if you don't want to top them off.  As for the pecans, it worked well to have a few bite sized chunks just for variety.  Highly recommended - thanks for the recipe!

these cookies turned out to be very very soft and crumble upon touch.  The icing was very very sweet (powder sugar and apricot jam)...still very good.

I made these cookies last year for the holidays and was asked to make them again for this holiday season. Very easy and oh so good. I also doubled the amount of preserves for the batter.

These are somewhere between a cookie and a biscuit.   Without the frosting, I don't know if I would have liked them as much.  They are good with milk or coffee.

good stuff!
I didn't add nuts, but to the frosting I added coconut.  Ya know, without frosting they'd be pretty swell, too.  Soft, not overly sweet.  Yum!
Eat with milk or coffee.
