I had a couple of issues here. We love cumin, but the cumin overwhelmed the fruit flavors. Next time, I will cut the cumin in half. I never butterfly/stuff my stuffed roasts. I insert a long sharp, pointed knife lengthwise into the roast from each end. Then open it up a bit to make a pocket large enough to accomodate the stuffing. The presentation is so nice that way and it is way easier too! I did not get any useable drippings out of this. I ended up with slightly burnt glaze in the pan so no gravy. I think I will make a seperate gravy with white wine next time. Very nice recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  It was great!!  The only thing is I didn't make any gravy be cause I didn't have enough fat drippings, but I think it was better without the gravy.

I did alter the recipe.  I only had fresh figs and apples.  So, that is what I used.  I omitted the  cumin.  It was excellent!

Because it was just for the two of us,  i used a very thick boneless pork chop cutting a space dwon the center. Didn't have apricots so used yellow raisins.  Very tasty.

I have provided this roast a few times now. I always get great reviews.
This past weekend, I made it for a group of 200. It is simple, flavoreful, moist, and the recipe multiplies nicely.

This roast turned out very good. I followed directions except that I used orange marmalade and cranberries from freezer for the stuffing . May have been a little overdone as it was hard to position the meat thermometer with the filling in the middle. Would definitely try again

Not a bad recipe.  The flavors just didn't go over well in my family at all.  I should have listened when a lot of the reviews talked about using this dish for Christmas dinner.  That's about the only time I could see making this again.  Just not an everyday kind of dish.

I've been making this dish, (or some variation) for 30 years. It's a wonderful main dish for any occasion. I'm making it for Christmas this year.

I was looking for a recipe for my boneless pork loin and I found it with this. I did substitute a box of Stove Top with my own sauteed' onions & celery for the stuffing but followed the exact recipe for the brown sugar paste that's on top and this was wonderful! I cooked it in a 325 degree oven for 2 hours. I probably should have followed the recipe and only kept it in for 1 1/2 hours because once the meat rests, it will keep cooking. There were not enough juices to make gravy but we didn't  miss it. The meat was moist and flavorful. The whole family loved it and I'll be sure to make this again.Thank you!

Great recipe, fruit and spices were great and not overwhelming. Smelled, looked and tasted great!  Perfect Christmas dinner option
