Fantastic recipe! I used 5 chipotle peppers and it was the perfect amount of heat for me. Setting some of the mixture aside to use as a dipping sauce is genius - it is perfectly seasoned and packed with flavor. I think the cook time for such thin cuts is a bit long, at least for my grill. I cooked mine 10 minutes total and they were definitely done - any longer any they would have been dry. You also won't need a whole bunch of cilantro! I didn't need to add any water to the sauce as the consistency was to my liking as is.  I'm definitely going to be making this again. I served it with rice and grilled veggies, but this would make excellent chicken tacos too!

It was delicious. Tasty but not dry. I donâ€™t like spicy food  but this had just enough heat. Easy to make but good! Definitely a keeper a!

Outstanding. The marinade is incredible. Planning on using it again in other dishes.
