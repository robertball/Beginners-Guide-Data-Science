I cannot find a thing I don't like about this salad. I added pineapple chunks b/c I had some and wanted a little more fruit then just the peaches. Nice and cool. Sweet and creamy. Thank You Galax.

The flavors were not bad together but mine got all mushy when I mixed it together (maybe over ripe avocado). A little less onion next time.

The recipe calls for sweet onion but the picture shows a red onion so that's what I used. Very good!

I really liked this recipe. I have a peach tree full of ripe fruit so this was another way to use up my bounty.

Not a fan of fruit in a salad but the dressing was so good. overall it was a little sweet for a salad but I would make it again.

I brought this to a cookout and it was a great cold side. The flavors mixed well and the avocados didn't turn brown because of the lime. Very easy!

I wasn't sure about this but had all the ingredients that I needed to use up so I tossed them together. Surprisingly good! The tart/sweet/creamy flavors complement each other well.
