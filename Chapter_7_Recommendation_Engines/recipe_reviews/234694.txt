Butternut squash and avocado go so well together. In my house we have a love/hate relationship with coconut oil, I love it, everyone else hates it. But here, no one complained, quite the contrary. I saut√©ed the squash with the onion too. I used a pressure cooker to speed things up and needed to add more broth in the end because it was so thick. I do believe this is why the amount of cayenne wasn't a problem. I garnished with avocado and smoked paprika. Thank you for this keeper recipe.

I should have read the reviews first.....2 T of cayenne is TOO much.
I do like peppery soups so opted to go with original recipe.  Now I'll have to dilute with yogurt and more stock and I think it will be good.

Tasted and adjusted spices as I usually do. Probably only used about 1 T of the cayenne pepper. Very good. I may try it with frozen squash next time to save on prep time.

Someone please fix this recipe! 2 Tablespoons of cayenne pepper? I should have read some of the reviews before making this, blindly dumping enough hot spices to ruin it. I wasted time and ingredients.

This is the 1st time I made it so I followed the directions to the "T".  Oh my stars, was it ever hot, hot, hot.  I'll try it again but with only 1/3 of the spices.. When they said kick, they meant it.

3stars because spices need adjusted. I liked it but even after reading others comments regarding spices and adjusting down by half on the cayenne. And cinnamon it was still too hot. I'm wondering if the original recipe meant to say teaspoonful instead of tablespoons? I'll try that next time. I did add a quarter teaspoon each cumin and turmeric because I like them. 
I like the added creaminess and health benefits of the avocado. I subbded coconut milk for the almond milk. 
I'd make it again.

Epic fail. Spent several hours trying to fix the heat.  Was trying to make this for dinner guests and had to make a last minute run to Costco to save the night.  Way, way too much cayenne.

The taste was awesome, but I put in 1/2 teaspoon and it was still a bit too spicy.

I only put in put in about 1 1/2 teaspoons opf the cayenne. It was still too hot. To salvage it, I added 1 more avocado, about 3/4 cup lime juice and another 32 ounces of broth. This brought the heat down to where it didn't burn, and still tasted very good.

I had such high hopes for this recipe, but it was completely inedible. I'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews first.
