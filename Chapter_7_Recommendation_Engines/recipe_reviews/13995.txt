I thought these were quite good. The true test was when even the "meat only" and the "I don't eat burgers" girls ate them and declared, "Hey, these are good!!!"  I've tried several fast food and packaged "Veggie Burgers" and found them to be either too spicy or have too much filler.  I read some of the reviews first so I wasn't surprised to find the mixture somewhat sticky.  This could be because some of the 1 1/2 cups of flour should have been included in the mixture since there is far too much of it to simply dip 8 patties in, 1/2 a cup of flour is plenty for that purpose.  I sprinkled about 3/4 of a cup of flour into the mixture which removed the stickiness.  I used only zucchini since summer squash was unavailable the first time and way too expensive when it was available.  A little grated red pepper added some "great" colour and flavour.  These will be an added favourite to "Burger Night".

This is an excellent recipe for making homemade veggie burgers. I've made this many times and everyone loves the crunch of the oats (rather than beans like most veggie burger recipes call for). I make extra and use whole wheat flour to coat and cook each patty, wrap it in plastic, put them in a ziploc bag, and store them in the freezer. then i take them out and heat them on the pan when i want to eat them.

This recipe is super.  I did not change any ingredients.  It took one minute to process ALL vegetables, onion and cheese in food processor.  I sauted the vegetables in iron skillet for added vitamins.  I sauted until the vegetables were free of any liquid.  The reviews are right only 1/3 Cup of flour was necessary for dipping patties in after forming them.  I pressed them in a hamburg press for uniformity.  Because I knew that I would use a George Forman grill I added about 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke to mixture.  They were just the best veggie burgers that I have ever made.  I am anxious to substitute brocolli for some of the squash.  I hope you enjoy your burger as much as we have.

My bf & I LOVE these!  I didn't think they were tasteless at all - we both really enjoyed the taste.  I've made these dozens of times by now.  I don't follow exact measurements, just add whatever I have on hand (sometimes no summer squash, just carrot & zucchini) and until the mixture forms nice patties.  To those of you who's patties are sticky, add more oats; to those who have dry patties, add more veggies.  Use common sense - add more or less of whatever you like, and get the consistency right by varying amounts of wet vs dry ingredients.  I bread with breadcrumbs instead of flour.  I also usually add nutritional yeast & breadcrumbs and sometimes add ground flax & wheat germ to the mixture (can't taste it or tell the difference without, so why not add some additional nutrition?).  YUM!

I'm impressed. Pretty darn good. This is the only veggie burger I haven't thrown in the trash. Added a little mushroom and red pepper flakes. Also, a few drops of sesame oil-nice flavor. Pressed in bread crumbs-not flour. Sprayed patties with olive oil spray before putting on grill. This is the only veggie burger recipe I will ever use.

This was my second time trying to make veggie burgers (my first attempt - different recipe - failed miserably).  Fortunately these turned out wonderful.  I think next time I will add some chopped up mushrooms and Montreal Steak spice to give them that added burger flavour!  They held up very well.

Good recipe - I added 1/4 cup more oats and, since I was in a hurry, put the mixture in the freezer for about 20 minutes instead of the fridge. Had no problem with excess moisture or crumbling or falling apart. I mixed everything in my food proccessor. I placed my hands in the flour first before handling the mixture to make patties - really helped, no stickiness. The burgers tasted bland to me, even though I used a lot of garlic and Italian seasoning. But I love spicy food, so it's no wonder to me that they tasted bland. Think I'll try mixing in some ketchup or a little tomato sauce next time to give them more flavor. I like these! Will definitely make them again.

Great Texture!  This was my first time making a veggie burger using oats. I was happy with the texture of these as they were not mushy like bean burgers which I also like. My finished burgers ended up lacking in flavor but it may be a result of my adjustments to get patties to form.  So my review is mostly based on texture results. I had issues with the the mixture forming patties so I added another egg then added flour then I felt like it still needed something else and added more oats.  For veggies I used a green bell pepper and the called for onions and carrots. I threw in some crushed walnuts and used a little feta cheese instead of cheddar.  I'm going to have to tweak this to infuse some kind of flavor but I am thrilled about the texture. Even when  I was ready to form patties with the mix out of the fridge they almost seemed like they might fall apart. I dredged them in flour on all sides and cooked them on the cast iron skillet and nothing fell apart.   Because of the lack of flavor issue and depending on your modifications I would recommend that you test fry a single patty and then do a taste test. It doesn't take long to fry and you'll have the chance to adjust the seasoning if needed.

I love this recipe!!  It's a bit of work but well worth it.  I've made this recipe 3 times, and the last time I trippled it!   I froze some of the cooked patties, wrapping them individually  in plastic wrap.  Now I just have to pop one in the microwave for 30 seconds and voila, dinner! I don't have a broiler pan so I just placed them on sheets.  I also had trouble with the flouring the patties so I omit this step and cook as is.

Holy Cow...well, no cow but still the best darn burger I have ever had! I have tried several recipes trying to find that perfect veggie burger and this one here is a winner...even amongst my carnivore friends. Truly, these are amazing. I omitted the carrots and yellow squash and just went with 2 mid. zucchini. I opted out of the flour breading and instead used 1/2 c Italian Panko bread crumbs with 1/2 c reg. bread crumbs. I cooked mine on a cookie sheet in 350 oven for 5 min ea side.

I've used this as my go-to recipe for veggie burgers since the first time I made these.  I followed MOMOFFOUR's advice, and put a half cup wheat flour in the veggie mix before refrigeration, and it helps with the consistency. I also keep it in the fridge overnight, and make each patty with cold, wet hands.  (I like to keep a large bowl of ice water next to the bowl of ground veggies to cut down time) I've frozen these many times, but found that the best way is to spray a cookie sheet with non-stick spray, line it with wax paper, and lay the patties on it as they are shaped.  cover it with another sheet of wax paper, and put in the freezer for a couple hours.  When they're frozen, take them off   the pan, and put them in a large freezer ziplock bag.  It cuts down on labor time and saves wax paper/plastic wrap.    This recipe can easily and succesfully be made vegan by replacing the egg with 1/4c blended silken tofu, and omitting the cheese.  I added some extra liquid smoke to help cover up any flavor it might have brought, and they were excellent.  surprisingly enough, the consistency was better with the vegan version; the patties stayed together much better!

I tried putting the oatmeal in the blender first to give it a smoother texture.  Added soy sauce, a boullion cube, and some fresh parmesan as well as some italian seasoning and celery salt.  Flavor was good but the mix really needed to lose more moisture before cooking.

I combined this recipe with one I found online for original Gardenburgers, so I left out the zucchini and squash, and added shiitake mushrooms, cottage cheese, and cooked brown rice. Also, I used some italian breadcrumbs, more soy sauce, and a can of garbanzo beans. My husband and I aren't huge on the black bean-based burgers, so this recipe was awesome and easy to customize! I cooked these on the George Foreman grill and they came out perfect and didn't fall apart at all.

This is an excellent veggie burger go to that stays away from the usual "bean" patty.  To make the recipe vegan, use nutritional yeast for the cheese, flax seed mixed with water for the eggs, and change the regular flour to whole wheat.  I use whatever veggies I have available and find the flavor and texture to be A+ every time! Leave out the Soy sauce if you're cutting back on salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are amazing!  What a great recipe, I plan to make again and again.  I followed exactly except used 2 yellow squashes instead of zucchini.  I plan to try substituting different recipes.  When I first mixed it and made patties it seemed like it wouldn't hold together but they cooked up perfectly and have a great consistency.

These were soo good, but I did spice them up a bit with Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning recipe. I threw the oats into the food processor to make a flour, and only chopped the veggies then threw them into the food processor before sauteing. I mixed the seasoning with the oatmeal then mixed as the recipe states and chilled overnight. I got six patties using my hamburger press but I omitted the AP flour completely. They are very sticky, but I had no trouble handling them and they held together very well.

My first time making a veggie burger and I was pleasantly surprised - very tasty and great texture (unlike bean burgers).  Changes:  no carrot and I added spinach, mushrooms and roasted red bell peppers.  I put all veggies in the food processor and sauteed the mix altogether (worked out perfectly).  Used more oats than it called for (for consistency/texture) and added worchestshire & some smokey grill seasoning.  Probably would have been OK to leave out the cheese (since I put cheese on top), but it certainly didn't hurt.  Will definitely make them again.

I really didn't know what to expect with these but they are great! 
- I only used half a zucchini and no squash(cause they are out of season and kind of expensive right now).
- I also only used 1/2 cup of flour to form the patties and that was enough. 
- I put about a cup of cheddar cheese cause I LOVE cheese!
- I added 2 tablespoons of ground coriander, 2 tablespoons of  ground cumin, 1 tablespoon of turmeric, a dash of cayenne pepper and a dash of salt since everyone said it was kind of bland. I still kept the soya sauce in the recipe thought.

Very good recipe.  I made it as written, except that I added some baby bella mushrooms and also some Worcestershire sauce and red pepper flakes.  I food processed all the veggies before sauteing, and this helped make a consistent texture.  Was worried the oats would stick out, texture-wise.  But it turned out great.  I would NOT say they taste like hamburgers--at least not to my meat-accustomed taste.  But a very good veggie burger nonetheless.  They were a little bland (what do you expect from a bunch of vegetables mushed together?), but with A-1 sauce on top, pretty good.

Very pleased with the texture of these burgers, and am so glad to have found a usable recipe for homemade veggie burgers! The mix was very sticky to work with, and gave doubts as to whether they would stay together, but the cooking was actually really easy and went well. They stayed together perfectly on the grill, and browned nicely. The flavor was lacking something for me (I like bland, non-spicy food so it wasn't that), so I will have to experiment with different veggies in the future (peppers, mushrooms, etc). My husband wants to add spices next time for his as he felt the flavor was good but too bland for him. Overall - great base recipe that's super easy and has an awesome texture.

Might I start off by saying that I am not a vegetarian but my daughter wanted to try being a veggie for 1 week to see how she would like it so I have decided to go along with her.
i did not have olive oil so i used butter to saute the squash and carrots and onions I omitted the garlic cloves because i didnt have any.
(my daughter says there are to many things that call for butter and eggs so she has decided for herself she will allow those)
I also added the steak grinder seasoning and some garlic powder
 anyway since it is winter here in my area grilling is out of the question so I added a little bit of oil to my pan and fried them till golden brown.
  I am impressed this was my first time trying something this different and i loved it thank you !

I am a vegetarian for many years, my husband a meat lover.  I made these burgers tonight for dinner and he loved them!!!  They fell apart a little on the grill, I may add more beaten egg next time to hold them together.  But they taste great, very filling, my husband said this was a "keeper"...I will make them again.

This burger was fantastic!  My fridge was getting a little "bare" and after seeing this recipe, I decided to use up the last of the veggies that were in there...carrots, zucchini, well-minced broccoli, onion, garlic, etc.  I sauteed everything, put in a big squirt of ranch dressing, some dashes of hot sauce, and adjusted salt and pepper.  I semi-ground the oatmeal and added about 1/4 c of wheat germ and let it all "sit" for about 20 minutes.  I found no need for egg or flour.  The burgers are presently cooking on my cast-rom skillet with just a smidge of oil, and my toddler keeps coming over, asking for more "burger".  This kid neve reats veggies, so this recipe is a GEM for our family.  Thank you!!

These are truly great!  I used worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce (used to put worchestershire in my real burgers) and added a tbls. of dijon mustard, chopped red and pablano peppers and some celtic salt.  I did not need to roll them in flour and didn't cool them either.  I formed them, then threw them in a pan sprayed with olive oil and fried 'em brown.  Topped with veggie pepperjack cheese and sauted baby bellas.  Really good, my hubby liked also.

I squeezed the juice from the veggies before cooking them. I also used left over quinoa, which is a protein grain great for use when replacing meat, and a left over baked potato grated instead of the oats. I also used muenster cheese. I substituted the soy sauce for Braggs liquid amino acids (very similar) and instead of flour I used nutritional yeast. I would suggest cooking on med.to med. high and letting them stay for several minutes on each side. I must say that homemade was much better than any of the frozen ones I have had and my husband was very impressed. I plan to make many of these from the things in my garden and freezing them for the winter.

I don't know what the hype is about these. I followed the recipe perfectly. They were bland and after a few bites the texture was gross. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least they were edible. I was raised vegetarian, so I know what a good veggie burger should taste like.

The recipe is a good "starter" for a veggie burger. First of all, if you cook them in a skillet (with a turn of olive oil), they will completely fall apart. I am trying a second batch, making the patties a LOT smaller, and thinner to avoid the breaking apart, and it's not working. I also added more egg and that didnt work either.. They WILL fall apart and not stay in a "patty" (unless you completely immerse them in olive oil, which is not my idea of a healthy veggie burger).  Secondly, it needs seasoning. They are bland. If bland is what you are looking for, then don't add any spices. If you want flavor, add more salt.  You can't taste the garlic- so add some zip of your choice.  Lastly, this clearly does NOT taste like a burger.. I dont want people to be mislead.. It IS a veggie burger and will not "mock" the taste of a hamburger.  All in all, they are quite delicious if you tweek the recipe a bit. I am doing CORE for weight watchers, so its a great staple to have. You will need to play with the recipe a bit to get it to your exact liking.. Like I said, good starter.

This is the first time I've ever tried a veggie burger, and while it came out delicious, I can't say it came out tasting like hamburger, nor did mine brown the way I'm seeing in the picture. Is there a special way to cook this so it's more like hamburger?  I'm also wondering if I had too much veggie and not enough oats as they are kinda floppy.  Over all though, the taste of what I did make was great.

Pretty good first veggie burger experience.  They didn't have a whole lot of flavor and were mushy, but at the same time, they aren't supposed to taste like a hambuger at all.  Only comment I have is, instead of cooking them on the grill, I just did them in a skillet because reviews said they would fall apart on the grill.  The flour created a good browning surface and I was pleased with how they turned out in the skillet.  Not my favorite recipe, but still a great recipe to try for something new!

I found this recipe while looking for a veggie burger recipe that did not include soy as almost all of the frozen ones on the market have a soy base (my baby loves veggie burgers but too much soy isn't good).  That being said, I needed to change this recipe a bit to make it more appropriate.  No egg white for babies under 1 year old so I substituted 2 egg yolks.  I used 1/2c oats and 1c cooked brown rice because I had it on hand.   If you don't feel like shredding all of those fresh veggies, you should know it works great to use a small bag of organic frozen veggies (I used carrots, peas, green beans and corn) and just roughly chop them in the food processor.  They turned out great!

I made this recipe as written and covered my hands in whole wheat flour as I formed the patties and didn't have any problem with stickiness.  I cooked half of the recipe in a skillet.  

With the other half of the mixture I added bbq sauce (about 1/2 cup) and while it was sticky it wasn't a problem.  

I found the burgers without the bbq sauce to be o.k.--not bad but not something I would eat alone without a bun.  

The bbq ones were much better.  

I put mine between two peices of whole wheat bread smeared with mayo, more bbq sauce and two pickle stackers.  It was PHENOMENAL!  

My three year old had hers served with out the bun with a piece of melted cheese on top and said she liked it but only ate half.  I would serve them to her again though.

Well, taking in to consideration, everyones suggestions, I put it hot pepper jack cheese, no summer squash, put all the rest of the veggies in a food processor.....and used egg beaters southwest recipe.  OK, liked the hint of spraying with olive oil, so as not to stick.  I like the frozen veggie burgers, these were alot of work....but promising for the nutritional value..

These veggie burgers were awesome!  I was actually looking for a bean-based recipe when I stumbled across this one and decided to try it.  I thought the texture was great and they tasted incredible.  I didn't have any summer squash on hand so I used 2 zucchini instead, added a pinch of salt and sprinkled some adobo seasoning into the mixture.  After reading some of the reviews, I was afraid that I was going to have trouble grilling them but they actually grilled up really well!  I wonder if the people who had trouble with this recipe used instant or quick oats instead of old fashioned oats...  Thanks for a great recipe Jen!  I look forward to making these again soon :)

These are my granddaughter's favorite after school snack.  They are requested so often that I make several batches, cook ahead of time and freeze them.  We love them just as they are, but if you prefer a spicier burger, just add your favorite seasonings. Thank you Jen for this delicious, healthy recipe.

Great flavor, though had problems peeling the veg-burger off the grill (no home-made veggie burger I've ever seen works on a grill, including this one. They stick & begin to break up, spray notwithstanding).  Took them inside to my cast iron pan, film of oil and medium heat, 5 minutes on each side ... and they held together pretty well.  Flavor hint: avoid the blandness of zucchini - don't be afraid to add some kosher salt to the mix, plus 1 Tbs good worcestershire sauce (though strict vegetarians will want to leave this out due to anchovies in this sauce). Lastly, I used smoked mozzarella and some pine  nuts. Again, great flavor, fairly easy to do, and the oats-veggie combo worked well.  I only wish you better luck if you use a BBQ or gas grill.

These were so good!  I added about 1/2 cup extra oats and the mix was still a bit difficult to work with so I just added some bread crumbs (about 1/2 cup) and that problem was solved.  Also coated the patties with bread crumbs instead of flour. I took the recommendation of a previous reviewer and added Montreal steak seasoning (about a tablespoon).  It was perfect.  Even my husband, a hamburger connoisseur, said they were "super good".  That's sayin' something.

This was a great recipe! Everyone in my house loved it.  My middle boy is extremely picky and the mere thought of a veggie causes panic and fight from him.  He gobbled it up happily, though.  I added a bit more soy sauce and some garlic, salt, and pepper for taste.  You'll definitely want a food processor, though, because it would take a lot of work otherwise.

I made these for dinner tonight and we all thought that they were just ok. I added extra flavorings like Worchestershire, cumin, and chili powder but they were still a bit bland. I drained off much of the excess liquid after cooking the veggies and that helped with forming the patties I think. I didn't use flour when I grilled them though, I used bread crumbs. I think I like other burger patty recipes better.

I enjoyed these burgers.  You will need to season them though.  As the recipe stands there are somewhat bland.  But with some doctoring up I can safely say that these will remain in my active recipes file.

This recipe is easy - quick - and delicious -- I am NOT a 'veggie' person - but my husband is - I've sampled MANY veggie burgers - and found them NOT enjoyable!  This is one I
can enjoy too -- and I'm a meat-eater!!  If you make too many -
you can refigerate the left-overs and reheat them the following
day and they taste great....maybe even better!!    Thank you,
Jen Parmer, I'll look for more of your recipes.

EXCELLENT! Very good. I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper, black pepper, kosher salt  and garlic salt. It added great flavor. Also I recomment using medium cheddar cheese for an extra bit. As everyone previously mentioned, I had a little hesitation about handling the burgers. The mix was pretty sticky, but I let the patties sit for about 15minutes and popped them on my George Foreman Grill. The turned out great. 
I'm recommending them to my family and friends, especially if they've gone the store bought route. Thank you for sharing! :o) :o)

This sounded so good but sadly, it wasn't. I think it needed a little more flavor - not sure what though. Per other reviews, I let it refrigerate for longer and was generous with the flour but they still fell apart. I'm not ready to give up on veggie burgers but I didn't have much success with this one. :(

Yummy.  Though I don't think they taste like meat at all, they were still delicious. And you get a very satisfied feel after eating them. I added some extra seasoning on my second batch because i wanted to try to get more of a beef taste. Didn't happen but I had an even more delicious burger. As is or with extra seasoning this recipe is great. Thank you thank you thank you. Will never buy frozen veggie burgers again

YUM!! Even my kids love these, and request them often. They are great exactly as the recipe is written, but I often throw in whatever veggie leftovers I have on hand...the secret being in the rolled oats, in my opinion, as that is what really gives them their pleasing texture. AND what a great way to get some much needed fiber!

Awesome recipe.  I did add one thing; at the end right before I formed the patties, I added bread crumbs to make the patties more firm like a meatloaf type consistency.  Yummo!!

These are great!  I have never made veggie burgers before, and they are easy to prep, and very tasty.  Next time we may try and add some red pepper flakes like some others have suggested just for a little spice.  Nice change from a regular cheeseburger.

Excellent! I did, however, need to add more flour. I added some to the mixture as well as patting it with flour. I couldn't pick them up if I formed them and put them on the plate of flour. So I floured my hands and formed the patty (using flour as needed) then sprinkled just enough for a coating and then put it in the skillet. YUM! I well certainly be making these again!

This recipe is quite good.  I made a few modifications that improved it tremendously.  As others have stated it was dry, so doubled the binding ingredients - eggs and olive oil.  Instead of flour, I coated the patties in bread crumbs and I added a lot of cumin for flavor.  Grilled each side for about 5 minutes on medium heat.  This was a crowd pleaser!

I was really excited to try this recipe after all the rave reviews. I had a very difficult time working with the mixture, though, even after refrigerating for 24 hours. I omitted the soy sauce, as I've been using that an awful lot for seasoning lately...added some parmesan cheese, black pepper, and salt instead. Clearly this was not enough, because my first test patty was very bland. Added more cheese/salt/pepper and it seemed to be better the second time. I think I will try baking on a cookie sheet next time for more uniformity.

Interesting! I never knew that you could make a meatless burger from oatmeal. This was good for me since the stores I shop at don't carry mock-meat products. Made up a "tester" version last week using what little ingredients we had in the house (just the carrots, onion, oats and soy), and it was surprisingly not bad!    Although next time I'll have to add a little more seasoning and veggies to my burger since the tester came out a little bland. But I will definitely make this again!

Made these for dinner tonight and all four of my picky eaters ate them even my husband who hates veggie burgers.  This is my first attempt at making veggie burgers and they were easy and had a wonderful flavor.  I did add flour, only 1/2 cup, to the mix before refrigerating as one review suggested. They were a little mushy in the middle and a little sticky so next time I am going to try adding more oats.  Healthy and delicious burgers, definately a keeper.

I am a confirmed meat-eater, but my husband is vegetarian, and we BOTH love these! After a disastrous and inedible attempt at making black bean burgers once, I wasn't sure how this kind of veggie burger would turn out, but they taste GREAT. They fall apart more easily than a hamburger, sure, but that probably has a lot to do with how I always forget to squeeze the moisture out of the carrots and zucchini (important step!). I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a healthy, delicious meatless burger. Very tasty and satisfying.

These were really great.  I like spicy so I used about 2 tsp. ground red pepper, 1 tsp. black pepper, 1 T. worcestershire sauce.  I also froze the patties, separated by wax paper (I was unable to cook the day I prepared them). When I cooked them I did so in a skillet, if you do that do not dip in flour, the flour does not cook correctly. I did add 1/4 to 1/2 C flour to the recipe.  Thanks for a great alternative recipe!

Since being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, I have been on a search for a good veggie burger recipe. This is absolutley the best I've found.I omit the Olive oil and use a non-stick fry pan to cook the vegetables.  The burgers hold together niceley and work well on the grill. They have a pleasing color and a nice "crunch".

Love the texture, but they definitely need some spice or some type of seasoning.  I added some cajun spice to mine.  Also, I mixed in 1 cup of flour and used bread crumbs to bread them after shaping them.  Washing my hands after forming 2 helped keep them from being too sticky.  The recipe made 8 good sized patties for me.  They froze really well, so I will be making a batch for the freezer to use up some veggies from the garden.  Much better than the frozen ones you buy at the store.

Okay, when I was mixing these up the smell was questionable and they were super sloppy (of course I didn't wait the one hour for refridgeration) to put together. I DRENCHED them in flour just to get them to form into patties.  I thought for sure they would disintegrate on the grill, but they didn't.  They actually grilled up into some of the best veggie burgers I have ever made, with good (if a bit light) flavor, a crusty outside and soft middle. Even my super-picky veggie bf liked them and said I should make them again! What a surprise success!

This is a wonderful recipe. I am trying to become vegeterian and this recipe is my kids favorite. To add flavor I added 1/4 cup of parsley or cilantro, also used wheat flour or oat as it needed.

These were very good.  I added some shredded celery, chopped spinach, some worcestershire and some garlic-tomato-basil Mrs. Dash.  I refridgerated them for an hour but were still pretty sticky so I put them in the freezer for a bit and when they cooled they were easier to patty.  I just put some flour in my hands, not on a plate and they came together.  We topped with tomato, onion, lettuce and ketchup.  They were very yummy.  We will be making these again.  They paired really well with the baked basil fries. YUM!

I came back and tried this recipe for a second time. Last time I used eggplant instead of summer squash. The summer squash was not that great. I don't think I'll try this recipe for a third time, but if I do I think that the eggplant has a more robust flavor.

Although the recipe called for a lot of work, it was worth it in the end.  I added extra garlic and cheese (cheddar and mont jack) along with some panko (Japenese breadcrumbs), worcestershire, and some heat.  They held together well on the George Foreman, but I'm not sure they would hold up on the grill without some reinforcement.  Thanks for the idea Jen!!

i've had lots of tasty veggie burgers - this wasn't one of them.  very bland and they fell apart really bad.  next time i'll add lots of seasoning and at least 1/2 cup breadcrumbs to hold them together...and omit the flour - it gives a yucky taste.

What great veggie burgers!  I've tried most brands on the market and these were so much better.  Quick hand rinses between each patty remedied the stickiness problem other reviewers suffered.  I used finely chopped broccoli instead of yellow squash: yummy.  I also added salt, pepper and a few dashes of ground cayenne pepper before shaping the patties.  The veggie-to-oats ratio was ideal; no mushiness, no crumbling.  I can't wait to make them again....

These were just awful. After all the time I took with the vegetables, when I mixed it all together it was so sticky, it was unbearably difficult to work with. And they didn't cook evenly at all; areas were either barely cooked or burnt. They didn't taste one tiny little bit like hamburger like it claimed. I hope they do better as fertilizer in my yard than they did on the dinner table, cause that's where they ended up. I think I'll stick to the store-bought veggie burgers from now on.

My husband gave this rave reviews, as did I.  I used salt instead of soy sauce and sprayed the "burgers" with Garlic Pam before broiling. It does take time to do all the chopping and grating but is well worth the effort.
A winner.

These had great flavor. We had a little trouble with the burgers falling apart, I think there was too much moisture so we tried to add a little more flour to the mix. We ended up giving up on the grill because they were falling apart and finished them in a pan and they were very yummy.

Yummy!  After looking at all the veggie burger recipes on this site I chose this one because of the ratings and all the veggies.  I have to admit that they were hard to work with, but I sprinkled the flour on a cookie sheet pakced the mix in a 1/2 c. measure and plopped it on the sheet.  I sprinkled that with flour and pressed it out with my hands.  Worked fine.  I did add some cilantro, my favorite.

We followed the recipe exactly.  The burgers were cooked thoroughly but mushy in the middle and didn't have much flavor at all.  Also they were quite a bit of work.

As-is these burgers are bland and difficult to work with.  I don't know how they got 4+ stars from others.  However, I added more oatmeal, wheat flour, garlic, and lots of spice (mesquite & caribbean jerk) and then they were quote good!

I rate this recipe excellent.  The second time I made them I accidentally added quite a bit of the flour into the mixture, it was very good and yes it does reduce the stickiness.  My husband & I love this recipe. A little hot sauce makes it even better.

This recipe was great! I made it when my niece (vegetarian) stayed with us. She loved them and so did her mom. We made this a few times and found that they taste even better if the mixture is made the day before you cook them.

Was good. Didn't get the whole "tastes just like a burger" reviews, but it was still very good. Next time I'll add more soy sauce to my tasting, and maybe a pinch of salt.

I really liked these and so did my non-veggie eating 7 year old.  They were fun to make, although a little messy.  I omitted the cheddar cheese and added a slice of cheese to the top.  I also added Montreal steak seaoning as another reviewer suggested to add favor.  Very tasty, great texture, passed it on to friends and family!

Fabulous! Great texture and flavor, and packed full of veges! These will be a regular with us. Once I was in a pinch for time and couldn't wait an hour, so I added some potato flakes to thicken, and they turned out great!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Not at all like store bought, but much better tasting to our way of thinking. The best thing about this recipe is that my "non-vegetable" eating son, LOVED them, and anything that gets vegetables into that boy is a 5 in my book! I did put 1 cup of the flour that is called for into the mix, and then used the rest to make the patties.  We prefered these pan fried to grilled, but either way they tasted good.

These were REALLY bland and tasteless despite the fact that I added 4 cloves of garlic. I used zucchini only since I didn't have any summer squash. The kids ate them without complaint but the weren't thrilled at the prospect of having them again.

I added extra seasoning, as suggested and they turned out well. The mixture was very sticky, so first I formed it into balls, dipped them in breadcrumbs, and then lightly formed them into patties.

These were ok, but really lacked in flavor. They totally needed something more. I'm going to try some different seasoning, but not sure just what yet.

We all really liked these.  The kids refused to eat them as "burgers" but ate them as veggie patties without a bun.  Go figure.

I did add quite a bit more soy sauce and wocestershire sauce as well.  YUMMY.

I've tried this recipe twice, and they are bland, tasteless, dry and borderline disgusting. The second time I made these (last night) I added some chopped mushrooms thinking that they would add some flavor and moisture. That was a big negative.

I used this recipe as a starting point and added some other veggies I had on hand (mushrooms, spinach, broccoli & corn). I used mostly oats for the binder and just a few tablespoons of flour and some cornmeal too for texture. I tasted the mix with just the soy sauce and it was pretty bland so I added more salt & pepper, some curry powder, coriander, cumin and sweet paprika. I didn't have time to grill them, so I dusted them with more cornmeal and put them in the oven at 350 for maybe 15 minutes a side. I got 6 decent sized patties out of the recipe and ended up flattening them a bit during cooking because they seemed to still feel a little mushy inside. Overall, I think it's a great veggie burger base recipe, but I could see adding quite a bit more for flavor. Maybe some ketchup and worcestershire or liquid smoke as other reviewers said. Will definitely be trying them again!

My husband and I were very surprised by the consistency of these burgers. They were just firm enough. But they weren't flavorful at all. I will continue to use this recipe, but I will be adding salt, black pepper, and a variety of spices each time.

Good burgers, though as the last reviewer suggested you will need to add your own sauce and spices for flavoring.  These are a good starting point for your own creative ideas.

Not bad.  I'm a vegan so I skipped the cheese and egg.  They stayed together really well and smelled fabulous cooking. I found that the more I ate of my burger the flatter and flatter it got! It ended up creeping outside of my bun. My husband's a meat eater and said they were alright, but he wouldn't go out of his way for them.

This is a really simple, good recipe for veggie burgers. I made only a couple small changes: I didn't have cheddar, so I subbed Monterrey jack and I used a rolled grain mix (oats, wheat, barley). Thanks for posting!

a true great veggie burger  1ST class i am not a major fan of them but i get in the mood for one  this is how it should be.  when you get those ones in the store that at stuff to attempt a meat flavor are so bad that you can stuff them in the toilet and not no the diff. if you catch my drift

These were the first homemade veggie burgers I ever made. My 17 year old son is a recent veggie convert so I was encouraged by previous reviews, especially the lack of bean in this recipe. I feel like he eats enough beans in other recipes. THESE WERE DELICIOUS. Just read the reviews and add stuff your family likes. ENJOY ! Thank you, Jen !

This is one great tasting burger!  I added 1/3 c. Italian bread crumbs, 1/2 t. ground cumin, 1/2 t. chili powder, 1 t. salt and 1 can of black beans, drained, rinsed and mashed. Next time I'm going to try firming things up a bit more with a bit more oatmeal because, while hot, the patty is pretty mushy in the center.  We'll see how things go...YUM!!

Pretty good!  My whole family enjoyed.  I added a few more oats and some chopped mushrooms!  I was suprised at how easy it was to make.

Thank you Jen,  I use this with any and all my left over veggies, this recipe is great and my family love's it!!!!! With the price of meat going up this is worth it's weight in gold. I don't add the cheese, but place a slice on the burger after it is cooked.  I fixed this for my neighbor and she thought it was real meat!  Awesome.

I love these Burgers. I did add more seasoning to the recipe depending on who Im cooking for. Chilli sauce or BBQ sauce with the Soy sauce is well worth a try too.

Great.  I did end up making about 4 times what the recipes called for.  I added 8x as much garlic, 4x onion, a little cayene pepper, and MRS Dash original seasoning.  Used only zuchini.  I did add tofu for protein and used bread crumbs instead of flour.  They look like  when you put them together, my husband thought I was joking when I said we were going to eat them.  But I sprayed tin foil with nonstick and placed on the grill-perfection!  Us grownups loved them, kids not sold, but will learn to love em since I am going to make again.  My husband suggested a terriyaki sauce with them.

The taste was great. The eggs I had on hand were really old so I tried the standard soy flour/water egg substitute but it didn't keep these together; they really fell apart. Friends still loved them though!

I only gave this one a three because it's probably my own fault.  I tried to make a large batch (24 servings) following the same converted recipe.  I have used other recipes in the past that have turned out great.  These just seemed excessivly sticky and hard to work with.  The mess I made wasn't worth the outcome in flavor.  For all the work, I wouldn't try this again.

This was my first attempt at any kind of veggie burger, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I added liquid smoke like someone else suggested, and also a bit of worchesire sauce.  I also substituted fat free cheese.  Delicious!

These were quite tasty, I did season it up a bit with pepper, Italian seasoning, chili powder and red pepper flakes. They didn't turn out as crispy as I had hoped, but they were flavourful. I will surely make this again!.. It is a nice low fat alternative to regular hamburgers. They were quite time consuming, but well worth it.

this recipe was great...i've been looking for  a great veggie burger without a lot of fillers and i think i have finally found it..i added extra garlic and onions and coated the burger with a little plain bread crumbs instead of the flour and cooked it on the outdoor grill.

This was the first time I made veggie burgers from scratch...and boy were they good. I used a food processor to finely shred/grate the veggies, and I didn't have any zuchini squash, so I used celery. It worked fine, they are indeed hard to handle...long refrigeration is the key I think, and use the flour generously on your board..don't handle too long. They cooked up great and flipped without crumbling (which was my biggest fear). My two year old ate it up. Yum.

First time ever making a veggie burger and I thought it was great. It was still very moist after an hour in the fridge so maybe next time I would leave it in longer or the night before. Maybe even add more oats. I have four more in the freezer waiting for me and my roommate!!!

These were not good at all.  Once all the ingredients were put together it was so sticky even after refrigeration.  Just about impossible to form into patties.  Once cooked the texture could best be described as gummy, probably due to the oats.  It's really too bad since they contain such healthful ingredients but there are way better veggie burger recipes out there.   Or just go to the store and buy an Impossible Burger.

I was skeptical - but it was fantastic!  I took other reviewers suggestions and added a splash of liquid smoke and I also added some Tony Chachere’s seasoning to the veggie mix. Even my kid that has sworn off veggies ate these. The vegetarian kid loved them.  Carnivore Hubble went back for seconds!  Will be making regularly.

I thought these burgers were really yummy when I added a few extra ingredients to liven the flavor... 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 fresh jalapeño, 1/4 c flax seed, and several dashes of liquid smoke. I only had steel cut oats on hand and I really liked the crunch and texture they provided.

Made these for my son who is a vegetarian and he loved them. His brother who is not also loved them. Both enjoyed the the fact that these  were not trying to be hamburgers.  They are sticky so coating them with flour or breadcrumbs  is a must.

So delicious!!! Not vegetarian but love a good veggie burger and this was fantastic! To simplify I pulverized everything in the food processor (added half a container of mushrooms in place of one zucchini) then sauteed that mix until there was no liquid then made as directed. I did use smoked peppercorn cheddar and added all the normal burger seasons and a heavy hand of A1 steak sauce while cooking down. Served on onion buns with caramelized red onions. Insanely good! You could definitely throw in whatever veggies you have for this too! 10 stars!!

This was a great recipe. I made it for my daughter and she LOVED it!  I did add in Montreal Steak seasoning and salt to the pan mixture. I also replaced the carrots with portobello mushrooms. Because I only eat egg whites, I used 1/4 cup instead of a whole egg. It was sticky, but adding a little flour to the cold mixture helps.

Good recipe.  Next time I’ll let the zucchini drain.  I ended up adding more oats to absorb the moisture.  These cooked great on a George Forman grill.

I used half a butternut squash and and it was a little wet so added bread crumbs to suit - placed on toasted thin whole wheat buns with Dijon mustard,  a slice of Havarti and a bed a spinach - Very good  - I may add some pepper flakes or steak spice as suggested by others next time - will definitely make again

Yum!  I cleaned out my refrigerator of zucchini, onion, carrots, green and red pepper and mushrooms .  Easy to make and delicious. Crispy on the outside. I didn’t have any buns, so I ate two patties. I can’t wait to make I to a yummy veggie burger with a bun and all the fixings.  Thank you!

Updated:  the mix was in the refrigerator night. Easily made a patty, put in flour and then fried it. Put on a bun with sprouts, sliced cherry tomatoes, sliced dill pickle, mayo and ketchup and it did the trick. One of my favorite veggie burgers.

Nothing beats a good old beef burger, but this one is absolutely delicious!! I have made this for a while now and made one simple change last night that took them to another level. I used Planko seasoned bread crumps in place of flour and it gave them the perfect texture!! Other than that I would not change a thing! GREAT RECIPE!!

Very tasty veggie burger..Made as per directions..Made patties before refrigeration and used masa instead of flour to coat. Lightly fried them in a small amount of canola oil and they browned nicely and stayed together  well.

5 stars for foundational recipe, but I made a lot of alterations because I like my veggie burgers thinner and crispier as I do with beef burgers.  I took a lot of feedback from you guys too!  1) I cooked down the veggie liquid, 2) I added feta to taste, 1/2 cup of mashed black bean, and a dash of chili pepper and cumin (since a lot of you complained about how bland it was).  I also salt and peppered to taste and only used a tsp of soy sauce.  then, I dusted my hands with flour and pattied them kinda thin, then crusted them in panko (thanks for that!).  I placed them in the oven @400f until they browned a little on the edges.  Finally, I sauteed them in a skillet with liberal olive oil.  They tasted amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing!  Crispy, just like I like it.

I had previously searched for "veggie fritters" , but they always turned out egg-ie an my kids hated them.  These were just right on slices of Hawaiian bread :)

This recipe made a very tasty veggie burger.  I followed the instructions very closely, but perhaps used a bit too much grated veg as the burgers didn't hold together in patty form very well.  Another egg, or more cheese might have helped.  I will try again!

Thanks for this recipe, these were great! I'd never had homemade veggie burgers that didn't involve beans before, so it was a nice change.

Really, really good. There are so many veggies you can add to it. I added Montreal steak spice and pepper flakes. After chopping everything very fine, I sauteed it a few minutes and then added my egg, oatmeal..I did not dip it in flour afterwards. I just made a pattie and laid it on a cookie sheet with parchemin paper on which I brushed olive oïl. I cooked it at 425 F for 15 minutes. Flip over when it's golden brown . So nutritious! Definitely a keeper. Thank you.

I made this as written except instead of zucchini I used angus beef, and instead of squash I used an egg and instead of rolled oats I used steak sauce and instead of flour I used crushed pepper flakes. I hand mixed in a bowl instead of using a food processor. I added more garlic, cumin and salt! My hubs LOVED IT!!!! Even my persnickety 12 year old who HATES burgers LOVED these!!!! It was a BIG HIT!!!!!!!!

This was surprisingly wonderful.   The only change I made was I used Worcestershire sauce instead of the soy sauce.  I did use the flour dusting but not near the about on the recipe.  I cooked mine in a stove top pan sprayed with butter flavored Pam.

Seriously, one of the best veggie burgers I've made - and I've made a lot of them!  These taste more like a real veggie burger vice a hamburger look-alike.  I love that I can get a lot of vegetables into one burger, and they are good fried or baked.  Baked burgers look a little dry from the flour, but are excellent for refrigerating and frying up in a little oil later.  Yum-o!

It was not good at all.  Very mushy and not very tasteful. We had to put buffalo ranch on it it make it edible.

5 stars because this is a very healthy and good tasting burger. I used a small yellow and green zucchini from the garden. I think next time I will add some mushrooms, more oatmeal and use bread crumbs instead of the flour.  Liquid smoke would also improve the burger I think. We didn't miss the meat and will try this again.

I substituted mushrooms for summer squash and put one part breadcrumbs to two parts oatmeal.  They turned out delicious! I added some salt when sautéing the vegetables and made sure to cook out a lot of the moisture so they wouldn't be soggy.  I made them for a barbecue and they were a hit! They were moist and flavorful and held together well. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good starter recipe for veggie burgers. I made a batch as written, but the burgers had too much moisture. So I made another batch, enhancing the flavor with more Worcestershire, salt and cayenne; and adding  some breadcrumbs. Also, it worked better to grill or fry the burgers without baking them first.

My 17 year old daughter is vegetarian. I was making beef burgers on the grill for the rest of or family and used this recipe for her.  Did half in flour and the rest in gluten free bread crumbs.  She commented that both had a bacon flavor. Maybe it was the combo of soy sauce and mesquite wood that I used on the charcoal grill.  A hit either way!  Will make again!

Very good! I was not sure what to expect but I was not disappointed. I pretty much made it as the recipe states except instead of using flour, I used bread crumbs (~1/2 cup), added some seasonings and 2tbs of flour to cook up the burgers on the stove. I do hope to make these when it's grill time. I also decided to garnish with sautéed mushrooms and spinach with a little bbq sauce. I recommend!

Hands down our family's favorite veggie burger. I never have to use flour at the end, the patties just form perfectly. I just put them on the griddle with some cheese on top and shazam.

Whipped this up a few nights ago and was very impressed!! I love the idea of chopping up a bunch of veggies, any on hand, and quickly heating it in a skillet. It's easy and healthy.  I also took the advice of another and froze some for later.

I liked the concept of this recipe, especially using rolled oats instead of beans.  I mostly followed the recipe, replacing the soy sauce with Worcestershire Sauce and the egg with egg substitute. Upon mixing, it was clear to see it needed more moisture.  I added another serving of egg beaters but was reluctant to add more (didn't want the eggy taste), so added a healthy squirt of Ketchup to get them to hold together.  My daughter and her husband didn't want them coated in flour so I left that out and portioned out onto a baking tray.  I refrigerated the mixture for a couple of hours, then baked at 350 for about 15 minutes, flipped them and baked for another 20 to get them firmed up.  They were crunchy and held together, but a bit dry, so I wouldn't bake them as long next time.  After all of that, they were EXTREMELY bland.  Thank goodness I had made a couple of sauces to go on them.  If I were to make these again, I would definitely season them a lot more.

Awesome recipe!  Only change I made was to the summer squash.  Too early in spring so I used imported zucchini.  Easy to prepare and they were even good as leftovers, served cold the next day!

I loved these. I had to make changes which was easy to do. Great ingredients are in these. I did squeeze the zucchini and carrots to remove some of the liquid. And I added some liquid a Ike, Montreal steak seasoning, mushrooms, worchestershire and tamari. And I used half flour and half panko to dip them in before pan frying them. They held together and taste yummy.

These are great if you'd like more spice like I do add a little or maybe more dried red chili flakes whatever to your taste......

The taste was okay and they made reasonable leftovers, but I was underwhelmed and they fell apart

Made the recipe as it is written (except added the flour as suggested).  Very bland, almost tasteless.  The texture was fine, burgers stayed together nicely.

I added more squash, forgot the oil added an extra egg just because  people were talking about it not staying together well.  My only issue was I think I made them too thick, because they were a little paste-like in the middle, but other than that, they were tasty.  The only person who wouldn't eat it willingly was my 10 y-o son and he's not wanting to eat anything that he isn't already very familiar with.

These are great, my daughter even liked them and she can be funny about trying new things.  But we all gobbled them up.  I wasn't paying close attention and accidently ended up adding the flour to the mixture and then had to add a little broth to get the right consistency.  I cooked them in canola in my cast iron pan, added cheese and BBQ sauce, perfect combo!  I froze the remaining 4 patties.  Healthy, easy and inexpensive!

This recipe is amazing! My husband had his doubts, but he even enjoyed it. I added a little bit of worcester sauce, which added to the flavor. I will make this again!

These are so good. I have always wanted to make my own and these are the perfect ones to make. They even taste better then the ones you buy at the store. I had no problem with them falling apart they held together just fine. Thanks Jen Parmer

Meh, this turned out mushy for me and too bland. I had to add more soy sauce and black pepper to give it a little kick. I also covered it in breadcrumbs are pan-fried it because I had no grill. The breadcrumbs gave it a nice, toasty smell, but the insides took a very, very long time to cook. It's alright, though I will not be making this again even though I really wanted to like it... it was one of the few veggie burger recipes with no beans!

I added a few more veggies (to clean out my fridge) and used panko instead of flour to coat, but otherwise followed the recipe. The taste was pretty good - better than I was expecting, actually! I wish the texture had been a little crunchier - my burgers turned out mushy on the inside. Next time I might chop my veggies more coarsely. I used my food processor and I think it shredded everything too fine. I worried my husband wouldn't like them, but he said they were "delicious"! Oh, I did add some salt when I was sauteing the veggies, and I mixed some garlic powder, onion powder and dried parsley in with the panko to coat them. I cooked them on a cast iron frying pan over medium-low heat, and they held together well.

Really loved this recipe - I added a can of ground up chick peas for protien and next time will leave out the egg (don't really think you 100% need it) for my brother-in-law who doesn't eat eggs.

Delicious.  Made a 4 person batch and added one more egg.  Was hesitant it would stick together but it actually did.  Cooked 10 minutes each side on med low heat covered. Converted my meat eating husband

I made these according to the directions and added a can of garbanzo beans that I had blended in the food processor.  It made them stick together better and adds some yummy protein.  I also seasoned with cumin, chilli powder and garlic.  I've tried out several other veggie burger recipes from this site and this is my bf's favorite so far.  (Also mine :)

These were pretty good.  I used fat free cheddar cheese and omitted the flour altogether.  I don't know if they really taste like a "burger," but I liked them.  Will cook the leftovers and freeze for an easy meal.

Thanks!

These were very good. A little sticky to work with but when you drop the dough in the flour that pretty much takes care of the stickiness. I also added some onion salt, black pepper and a little extra cheese and soy sauce to my mixture. I also made them bigger- I ended up with 5- so I had to cook them longer. Just cook them till they're brown. Overall very good, tasty but not too spicy (although i imagine you can make them as spicy as you want). My vegetarian boyfriend was very very happy with them, since we've tried some package mixes which were horrible. Thanks!

Both my husband and I really liked these veggie burgers.  I didn't have any problems with "stickiness" and actually just patted them with a little flour and threw them directly on the grill without even refrigerating them first (was rushing and hungry). I will admit to adding about twice as much cheese as called for in the recipe.  This one is a keeper.

Well, I wish I could go along with all the raves but I found these to be pretty bland even though I followed the recipe exactly.  Add that to all the difficulty in handling as others mentioned and I'm hesitant to make them again.  Perhaps some additional seasoning to add more flavor and longer chilling so they hold together better.  It was quite a mess trying to form the patties.
