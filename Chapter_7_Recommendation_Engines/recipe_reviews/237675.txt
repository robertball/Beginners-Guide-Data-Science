I didn't have the tomatillo's so I used tomatoes, and I don't like cilantro so emitted that but the rest the same. It was awesome, made 2 large bowls and none went to waste.

I didn't care for this as much as I thought I would. While I appreciate the addition of the mango and tomatillos, the mint ruined it for me. Prefer more traditional guacamole.  It was ok, but I probably won't make again.

YUM! Great combo of flavors and textures. The store was out of fresh mint, so I used a bit of dried and that was fine. Served w/ salty tortilla chips, this was a hit~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
