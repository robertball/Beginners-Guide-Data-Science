I've been making this soup for years,  glad to see someone posted it so others will know of it's greatness. Wonderful soup, not only quick but filling. Only difference when I make it is I used homemade beef stock and omit the beans/double the kale. This increases well to feed whoever shows up, just add more broth and throw in more veggies. Best with a homemade crusty bread or beer bread. NOTE: You can use almost any kind of meatballs you like. I prefer an italian-seasoned meatball that I've made myself with ground chuck and sausage.

Excellent recipe.  Used Olive Oil instead of butter, omitted the carrots, and used chicken stock instead of beef. Fantastic!  Definitely a keeper!

A very good soup fresh, but doesn't freeze well at all.  Turns into a bit ball of meatbally goop.  That being said, if you can eat it all over the course of a couple days and are very careful to almost undercook the tortellini, this soup is super good.

Very rich flavor for such a short cooking time.  I subbed a quart of homemade tomato puree for half the beef broth, but otherwise made as directed.  Makes six substantial portions.

Excellent Soup!  Made as directed except used frozen spinach in place of the kale and cut meatballs in half (they were a little big for soup).  Only complaint is there was not enough stock for amount of ingredients.  Will double the beef stock next batch.  Great recipe!  Will make again and again!

My whole family loved this- will definitely make it again!  I made a few changes to the recipe- I doubled the tortellini (tortellinis are a family favorite!), I left out the kale, and substituted frozen green peas for the beans. Also, since I used a low sodium beef stock I added about 2 tsp. salt.  Even better the second day!

I love this soup!  The meatballs give it a fantastic flavor and the tortellini  is perfect addition (I used the dried Barilla bags found in the pasta isle).  I didn't have much time so I just threw everything into the pot to simmer and it came out great.  And you can use whatever veggies you have on hand.  My whole family (including my picky children) loved it!

I loved this, DH & DS really liked but didn't love as much as I did but they wouldn't mind having it again - which is good because I definitely want to have it again! Followed recipe exactly - except for using frozen tortellini. It was pretty easy too - good choice for a work night :)

Great recipe!  I made it for our families Christmas soup supper and everyone loved it!!  I put it all in a crock-pot for a few hours and then just cooked and added the tortellini before we were ready to eat.  I left the kale out because it just didn't appeal to me.  Will definitely make it again!

Made it twice: first time as written, second time wanting more flavor + a few of my faves.  The second time I used my homemade meatballs, subbed green beas for a can of rinsed northern beans, and 3 good handfuls of baby spinach instead of kale.  Still missing a lil something for my taste, so on the third go round Im going to try a can of tomato sauce, too :)  Makes ALOT of soup!!!

Very easy and tasted good.  Couple of changes due to what I had on hand, I eliminated the beans, carrots and Kale and added a box of frozen spinach.

Ok, I made this for my kids, sister and her family and everyone gave this rave reviews.  My brother-In-Law asked me for the recipe, which is one reason I am back on this recipe...to print it out for him. lol  There were no leftovers.  Definitely a great meal that was very filling.  Will make this again and again.

Very tasty!  I used the dried tomato pasta - flat noodles instead of the tortellini.  My husband doesn't like the riccotta cheese. It was still very good!

Really good, and pretty too! Love the kale- a rare indredient in Ohio cooking, and so healthy! I subbed some fresh mushrooms for the beans and otherwise left it unchanged. YUMMY!

Very tasty and VERY easy! I will definitely make this one again.  I used turkey meatballs, and since they weren't really thawed out (I had just bought them) I put them under the broiler first.  Plus I thought browning them might add something as well.  Left out the kale and added celery and green pepper instead.  Used tri-color tortellini from Sam's Club.  The hubby gave it a thumbs up!  Very good!!!!

I used homemade meatballs using LTH's recipe and subbed the amounts of carrot and kale for spinach. I used spicy diced tomatoes. Also, I used frozen tortellini without any trouble. I did not get to enjoy the texture of the soup as I had to have it pureed due to dental work (although it was equally tasty that way, just not visually appealing lol) but both my son and fiance enjoyed it as-is. Definite repeat.

This recipe is one of my new favorites.  I have already made it twice and have gotten rave reviews on it. The only thing I did different was to use thawed frozen tortellini instead of fresh.  It is less expensive and I can keep it on hand.

Made a few changes but only because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. Fresh baby spinach instead of kale, an extra can of diced tomatoes,and only 1 quart of chicken broth. I cooked the tortellini separately then added some of the pasta water to leftover marinara sauce to increase the liquid. Used homemade meatballs that I precooked and added the parmesean to the pot. Came out wonderful.My husband loves anything with meatballs and pasta . This was a great way to get him to eat some veggies too!

This recipe is really delicious. I always read the reviews first and take some of that along with my own intuition. I substituted tomato sauce for some of the beef stock. I never measure anything but it was probably two thirds beef stock and one third tomato sauce.  I really wanted a thicker broth base so the tomato sauce was a good addition for me.   Oh, and the family loved it.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

Used 1/2 chx stock and 1/2 veggie stock, 28 oz tomatoes, 12 oz tortellini, trader joes frozen meatballs, a lot more beans/kale.  The whole family gobbled it including my 2 year old and my 3 1/2 year old.

I thought the soup was really good. Instead of the kale I used fresh spinach and I used the canned diced tomatoes with roasted garlic. I took some over to our elderly neighbor and am anxious to get his opinion. Will be on my list to make again.

I added extra meatballs and extra tortellini and I wilted spinach in it at the end of the cooking process instead of kale. It was very good and I will make it again.

This is my sixth time making this recipe and my wife has loved it every time. When we don’t have homemade meatballs or I’m too tired to make them (I’m married to a first generation American Italian and store bought is beyond unacceptable), I use Italian sausage. It is by far my favorite tortellini soup recipe. It’s simmering on the stove as I type this...fresh rosemary bread is also in oven.

I have recently made this soup, and my family loved it! For veggies, I found some bags of mixed summer-style veggies that contained squash, carrots and other yummies. It mixed so well and tasted great! We love cheese, and the parmesan as a topping was the perfect touch. Making it again for some friends, and this will be a frequent go-to meal for us!! Thank you :)

Excellent!  Makes more than 6 servings.  The only changes I made was to omit the green beans and to cook the carrots with the onion and garlic.  Next time I will add a third container of beef broth based on personal preference.  I highly recommend!

I used vegetable stock instead of beef (vegetarian).  Changed a few vegetables to what I had in the house.  Really good and hearty.  Will definitely make again.  Husband loved it.

I’ve made this recipe about 6 times now. Have not made any changes except to add more kale and broth. My wife and I like the fresh Tortellini the best. It has become one of our favorites.

I didn't have meatballs or beans so I used Italian sausage and zucchini instead. After sauteing the onion and garlic, I put all the ingredients except the fresh tortellini in a slow cooker on low for 2 hours. Put the tortellini in for another 10 minutes. So delicious and hearty, perfect for a cold, rainy day like today!

I will make it again.
I used one can crushed tomatoes with basil,and two Tablespoons of tomato paste. Next time I will saute my carrots and zuchinni and add some seasoned salt as I found them bland.
Also I will use a another pasta as my boyfriend said it was cheesy. I used a combination of low sodium beef and chicken broth. Also I boiled the pasta in the same combination to add flavor to them. This was more on the stew side of thickness so I used the broth I boiled the pasta in to give it a more soup consitity. To my taste added a little salt after it had cooked.
Did not make meatballs just browned the Italian sasuage.

I used spinach and ricotta tortellini noodles. Used a full cup of green beans, fresh green beans. I had a huge onion and only used 1/2 of it. I let it simmer and full cook wit the meatballs in it for about 30 minutes.  And last ten minutes I added the noodles. I let the whole thing cook about an hour. Was delicious:) . I recommend !!

Made this wonderful soup tonight for my family. Very simple and very delicious. So hearty you really don't need to serve anything else with it. I used frozen tortellini and it worked good. Will definitely keep this recipe on hand for these cold months ahead.

My family loved this recipe! I only made a few changes because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I made meatballs out of chicken Italian sausage, which turned out great! I had cabbage instead of kale, and chopped some up for the soup. I substituted my homemade chicken stock for the beef. I also added a can of hominy, just because I had one, and didn't have any green beans, so had to leave them out. But this is a great recipe, and quite versatile. You can add what you like, and leave a few things out, if you must. I will definitely make this again!

Easy recipe to follow and makes a hardy soup.  I left out the Kale and I didn't thaw my meatballs either.  I also used frozen tortellini, Wal-Mart brand at that, instead of fresh and it was perfect.  I will definitely make this again for my family.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!! I used cubed steak, cooked medium rare instead of meatballs though. I set it aside and the rest of the fam. added to their bowls as I don't like meat that much. Also, I cooked the veggies for longer. If I had followed the recipe exactly, the veggies would still have been very hard. Everyone raved about how good it was. Will def add this to my recipe box.
