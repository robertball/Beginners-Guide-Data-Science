GREAT recipe!  Be careful of the order you mix things: the recipe says to mix, "milk, white wine, etc" but if you actually put milk and white wine in the pot one after another, the milk will curdle.  I simmered the white wine first, then mixed in the solid cheeses, then the cream cheese, and finally, once it was all melted together, the milk.  It seemed to work pretty well that way, of course, make sure you have all your ingredients ready because everything melts pretty quickly.  Also, even after adding the milk I thought it was pretty thick, so I used extra spinach for the liquid.  That was fine-- it tasted delicious.  My guests loved it and the spiciness was in no way overbearing.

Made this for a group of 10 adutls for a fondue party. I had another cheese fondue also (the kind you buy already made in the gourmet cheese section of grocery), but this one was the hit!! I made a few changes though: I did not use any spinach or green onion. I did add some minced onion (about 1 tsp), and used Grey Poupon mustard in place of the dry mustard (about 1 tsp). I also added lemon juice (liberally) during the melting phase to help with the stringingness-totally helped! I also added my milk last which other reviewers had suggested-think this is key! My party LOVED this and couldn't get enough-I will be using this recipe instead of wasting my money on the already made stuff from now on! I also used a Sauvigon Blanc wine-think that helped with the flavor too. Just make sure when you are heating this on the stove to go slow and low. When we transferred it to the fondue pot, it stayed nice & creamy-although it was disappearing pretty fast! Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

This is one of the best fondue recipes I've ever made or tasted. I would advise to warm the wine, add cheeses and spices then add the milk last so as to not curdle with the wine. It's great left over too! Just stir in a little milk. I haven't tried it, but I bet it would be a great macaroni and cheese dish.

This is a fantastic recipe. Lots of flavor in this fondue. The only modification I made was to add just a dash more white wine to thin out the sauce a bit. This was creamy, rich, and full of flavor. I served it with broccolli, french baguette pieces, wheat thins, red pepper slices and baby carrots. It was a hit.

I was looking for a good cheese fondue and this looked like the best on this site so I omitted the onions, spinach, and pepper.  It was EXCELLENT!  Great taste and very smooth.  Didn't burn in the pot.  I added a squeeze of a lemon because I had read it would cut down on the stringyness and that worked great.  I dipped rye bread, french bread, carrots, grapes, pineapple, and apples.  The green apples were the best!!!

This was a big hit at a fondue party. I made it twice and played around with the cheeses a little. I preferred it with less cheddar cheese. I also dipped cooked chicken and potatoes in it which was delicious. Don't be afraid of the spices, they really add to the flavor.

The gruyere cheese is the foundation, and the spices and spinach are what made this truly the best fondue I've ever had, and I have been to Switzerland and all over both eastern and western Europe.

This is one of my favorite recipes I've found on All Recipes.  This is a great fondue for people not fond of the traditional Swiss cheese flavor.  I omit the onions and spinach and I've recently replaced the wine with beer since I was out of wine the last time I made this.  Everyone asks for the recipe and it couldn't be more simple.  It reminds me of the Beer Cheese fondue at the Melting Pot restaurant.

This recipe was a bit spicier than I had anticipated.  Overall it went over well, but was a bit much for some people's tastes.  One might consider using just a bit less cayenne pepper.  Otherwise a fun recipe.

I used this recipe for a party. It was wonderful! Everyone loved it. We even made more the next day. It's fun to try with different add-ins like artichoke hearts & salsa. Very fun!

This recipe turned out fantastically. I used apple cider instead of wine and left out the onions and spinach (which I can't have due to medical reasons) and it still tasted great.  I mixed everything together and put it in the fondue pot over low-medium heat. This worked out well, nothing burned and the cheese was smooth.

Very good.  I didn't have any wine so I made it without, and it still turned out good.  I also only used 1/2 the dry mustard.  We used soft and hard pretzels, raw broccoli, bell pepper strips, carrots, ect.. but the soft pretzels were the favorite.

Other reviewers complained of scorching - that's because cheese fondues are not supposed to be put directly over flame - must heat using double boiler method. Was very good but not amazing! Thanks for the post!

I followed to a T.  I thought it was not that great.  There was more than half left that I threw away.  I will keep looking for a cheese fondue recipe.

I made this for a fondue party and they were scraping the bottom by the end of the night.  I read about the problems with the milk so I didn't use it at all, I just upped the white wine and it was fine.  Also, to get around the scorching issue, I made it on the stove, but then transferred it to a small crock pot and kept it on low all night.  It was perfect.

This was a hit at my party!  It didn't clump up or dry out, my husband was snacking on it after all my guests left.  I will definitely be serving this again.

Great tasting recipe.  I did as the others suggested and added the milk near the end.  No problems.

Like the others, I also had a problem with the sauce burning after it was moved to the fondue pot.  I was using sterno.

Next time, I will leave it unlit until the cheese starts to thicken too much and then light the sterno.  My advice would be to monitor it closely.

Anyone who doesn't like this recipe either doesn't like the combo of ingredients or did something wrong in the preparation.  The amount of cayenne is fine.  I have made this many, many times over the years and it is a hit every single time, without fail, rave reviews.  I like the thought of some lemon juice and to thin it out with extra wine or milk so I will try that next.  I have never had a problem with the milk.  Rye bread is a great idea otherwise any veggie works and I generally use Scoops for dipping.  Awesome as is!!

Served this for NY's Eve 2009/10 and it was such a hit -- delicious!  I will cut down on the cayenne next time because the one I have is very hot (therapeutic or something) and also b/c I want my three-year-old daughter to be able to enjoy this, and I think she found it too spicy last time (though we grown-ups liked it fine).  I also followed Wonder Wanda's advice about heating the wine first, next adding the cheeses, and then adding the milk last to prevent the milk from curdling, and that worked well; thanks for the help Wonder Wanda!

Very good recipe-  The only tweek I made was as the other reviewer suggested and added the milk last. I did not put as much cayenne in (only 1/4 tsp) as I was feeding young kids. The kids loved this and my 3 yr was eating his broccoli like crazy- Thank you!

This was very good!  I don't like swiss cheese, so I really wanted to find a good basic cheese fondue recipe.  I made this recipe exactly except I ommitted the spinach and green onions.  Everyone raved about it!  I served with bread and apples.  If you're looking for an easy, simple cheese fondue, look no further!!

I will make this one again for sure!  The cayenne pepper added just enough spice.  You won't be sorry if you make this at your next fondue party!  It was gone almost instantly!

This was exactly what I was looking for and it came out PERFECT!  So many fondue recipes call for expensive and exotic cheeses and I loved that good ol' cheddar was used in this one.  It came out great and stayed smooth until it was all gone..which didn't take too long.  The kick from the pepper was great too!!  I loved it as did our company!!

I tried 2 differnt cheese recipes for our fondue party.  Everyone loved the flavor of this one but the texture after about 15mins in the fondue pot was sticky and thick.  I think next time I will replace some of the cheese with processed cheese to keep the creaminess the other recipe had.  I also replaced the wine with chicken stock as others suggested.  I am anxious to try this one again!  I love the flavor of this one.

This truly is an excellent fondue.  We made it for our Christmas Eve party and it was a wonderful addition to the table.  Very cheesy and the spices are just perfect.  I was hesitant to use the entire teaspoon of cayenne, but it was just right.  Thanks for a great fondue recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe.  It is my go-to quick and easy fondue recipe (I make it at least once a month!).

I have never tried adding the spinach.  And I definitely agree that it is important to use bricks of cheese that your grate yourself, and add the milk last.  Also be careful not to heat up the cheese mixture too quickly, I wasn't paying attention and cooked it too fast once and the cheese became lumpy and wouldn't blend in well with the milk/wine.  

I also add more milk/wine at the end if I want it to be a little less thick.  Great for heating up the next day to drizzle over a baked potato or pasta noodles.  Add a little milk when you reheat to help make it creamier.

This is a really good recipe. We had it at a baby shower in mini rolls... as bread bowls. We dipped veggies and crackers in it. Then ate the bread bowl at the end. Kept it in a crock pot next to the mini bread bowls to keep it hot. It would be wonderful as a cheese sauce over cooked cauliflower or broccoli. Maybe even a base for a cheesy soup. Another keeper for sure!

I did enjoy this fondue.  I was between 3 & 4 stars.  I just didn't like the cream cheese effect in fondue.  I'm more inclined to a roux-type base.

This was voted "best fondue" at our last fondue night. I didn't have monterey so I used Bergenost - I think it made it even better! Omitted the green onions for the same reason, and added Parmesan and garlic powder for extra flavor. I agree with the other reviewers - MILK LAST!! And toss any freshly-grated cheese in a tablespoon of flour to help thicken the fondue without making it lumpy.  Thanks Al for the great recipe! Couldn't have impressed without you!

I wanted something different than the typical swiss cheese fondue and found this recipe.  I wasn't sure about adding the spinach and onions, but it was delish!  I did modify the recipe a bit.  I started with 1 cup of milk in my fondu pot at 250 degrees and added 4 fresh cloves of finely minced garlic.  I let that reach a boil and cooked the garlic slightly.  I added the cream cheese first and used a whisk to incorporate with the milk.  I then slowly added the cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese, stirring with a spoon, using a figure eight to incorporate.  I then added 1/4 cup defrosted and squeezed spinach, 1 cup of chopped green onions, 1 t. cayenne, 1/2 t. garlic powder, 1 t. pepper and 1 teaspoon fresh dijon mustard.  I warmed 1/4 cup of Pinot Grigio in the microwave and added slowly.  Reduced the heat to "warm" on my fondue pot.  It was a very good consistency but thickened as the night progressed so I added more warm milk and/or warm wine when needed.  Served with grilled baby bellas (brushed with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder), baked potato wedges (brushed with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder) and cubes of fresh, french bread.  I will definitly make this again.  Not too spicy, but I suggest adding the cayenne pepper little by little if you are sensitive to spicy foods as some cayenne peppers are hotter than others.  My husband doesn't like really spicey food but he liked this recipe a lot, as did I.

I'm actually surprised this one got such good reviews. I halved the recipe and I'm REALLY glad I did- less food to waste that way. The cayenne pepper completely took over the flavor of this. I used all organic ingredients. I couldn't eat more than a little of it- all I tasted was the burn of cayenne, no cheese, no other flavor. The people eating with me felt the same way. I would -not- recommend this recipe with the current proportions.

I followed most of the advice from the reviews and I didn't care for this recipe.  It did have a chalky texture and wasn't creamy enough for my idea of a fondue.  But my brother said "it's not that bad".  So 3 stars, I guess.

Very tasty. Will make this again. I melted the cream cheese in the wine first, then added the other cheeses, stirring in a zig-zag motion to keep the mixture from turning into a glutinous mess the way some of my previous attempts at fondue did. Thanks for a good recipe!

Really pretty good!  It was a lot thicker than I expected.  Liked not having the wang of swiss cheese in fondue!  Used veggies, pretzel rods, french bread cubes, cubes of ham, lil' smokies, and apple slices as dippers.

I would give this a 5 star if it weren't for the grainy-ness of the fondue.  The flavor alone was WONDERFUL and I most enjoyed it with cauliflower.  I did a quick blanch of my veggies (brocolli, cauliflower, and carrots) and also served shrimp and cheese straws with the fondue.  After making twice I would DEFINATELY add more milk, at least a cup, as it does GREATLY thicken (to the point where I had to use a small ice cream scoop to serve it, both times).  I also tried the lemon trick the first time, but not the second time and I noticed NO difference in 'grainy'-ness.  Aside from that I made no changes.  The cayenne as others have said is not at all hot on your tongue, yet I did notice that it started to get hot on my lips after a period of time (they were chapped)

My friends and I have enjoyed fondue for years, and this is the best recipe I've found yet!  I love the addition of the green onions and the spinach.  I have no changes to offer; as is, this recipe is perfect!  We loved it with slightly steamed broccoli, asparagus, and french bread.  Wonderful!

VERY GOOD!  I'm not a huge fan of cheese fondue, but I was asked to bring one to a fondue party at work and this one was perfect.  Everyone raved about it.  I didn't have any wine, so I used chicken broth as someone else suggested.  Everything else was followed to a Tee.  I liked the kick that the cayenne pepper gave it.  I will do this again!

I made this for a group of friends and they LOVED it-- not a drop left at the end of the night. I served it with apples, bread, mushrooms and broccoli. Will definitely make again. Just the right consistency-- not too thick nor too thin. Had to put out the fondue flame though-- was scorching quickly. It didn't last long enough to get too cold, though!

This recipe was surprisingly good.  I made it just as it said, and as stated by so many others, I added the milk last.  The fondu was delicious, and not too spicey at all.  Be sure to close the holes on your burner to adjust the flame to low, as this has a tendancy to scorch.  But it was gone so fast that we didn't need to worry too much.  We used baguette slices, rye bread cubes and apple slices.  Very yummy.  Don't worry about leftovers-- there won't be any.

I love a good ole Fondue party, and this one is always the biggest highlight, regardless of what kind of chocolate fondue is served. Absolutely PERFECT in every way. I never change a thing! I like to serve it with apples, carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, red and green peppers, baguette, jalapenos, celery and other vegetables. The pot always gets licked clean within 15 minutes.

This was the first fondue I ever made, and it tasted GREAT!  I subbed in reduced fat cream cheese, and 2% cheddar, and it still tasted wonderful!  I served it with broccoli, cauliflower, organic apple chicken sausage pieces, whole wheat bread cubes, and granny smith apples.  Everyone LOVED it and wants it again!  :)

Absolutely delicious.. at least the one bite I had was.  I burned the rest in my fondue pot!  (First time using it.)  I will probably add artichokes next time and use this as a Spinach-Artichoke dip.  Yum!

YIKES!  I should have known when I added all that cayenne pepper -- this had way too much heat!  Even my DH, who loves extra spicy things, thought it was too hot.  Did not enjoy this.  Sorry.

This is a wonderful recipe! Use a dry or semi-dry wine, either Swiss Fendant, Sauvignon Blanc or California Riesling. These help the proteins in the cheese melt more smoothly.

This veggie dip was great!  I'm very sensitive to spicy foods but this had just enough kick to keep everyone coming back.  I mixed them milk in after the cheeses like someone suggested and then when all was done, I put it in my small crockpot.  Everyone loved it!

This fondue was wonderful.  4 stars instead of 5 since I added a jar of artichoke hearts, lessened the amount of cayenne pepper, added some lemon juice, and increased the amount of wine.  Per the suggestions of other reviewers, I simmered minced garlic cloves and part of a (Somerset Sweet) onion in the wine first.  Then I added the cheeses and milk and proceeded with the recipe.  Completely awesome with broccoli and pumpernickel bread!

Huge hit with my family!! So, so easy and yummy.  Plus - it's economical-not requiring expensive cheeses.  I used a little less cayenne and garlic powder (thinking of the kids).

So good! I've made this several times now, and everyone has loved it. I leave out the spinach (although I think it would be wonderful!) because my husband is not a fan.

Great fondue! I dipped peppers, broccoli, veggie meatballs, veggie sausage, and wheat ciabatta bread into this. The only thing I had to change was the amount of liquids (milk & wine). I had to add more gradually as the cheese melted otherwise it wouldve been a huge cheese ball. I used a pinot grigio.

This was very good.  My first time doing fondue and all my guest loved it.  The pan was empty. Wiped clean.  I used cut up italian bread, broccoli, green and red pepper.  Yummy.

I made this for a fondue party with friends tonight and it was a hit. I followed the recipe exactly but added the milk at the end as other reviewers suggested. I added a bit of lemon juice as a precaution but I don't think it was needed. This recipe does have a little kick to it but we loved it!

Delicious! The flavor was great, the consistancy was a little thick so I added more water. I didn't use wine (personal preference). Perfect with ham and bread and brocolli and I also liked with celery. Thanks!

Wow!!!  My husband LOVES cheese...and he loves this fondue more than the Melting Pot's.  We stick to the recipe...simmering the wine first like the others suggested.  Lastly we serve with cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, bread (usually sour dough), and granny smith apples.

I agree with others:  it was a bit grainy, too thick for dipping, and too salty/spicy for our taste.  My father loved it, but no one else at our holiday gathering ate much of it at all.  We used raw vegetables for dipping and I used high quality cheeses.

Very yummy fondue, I left out the spinach & green onion and a bit more wine. Also used a smoky gouda with smoky cheddar/swiss mix cheese, was awesome! Will definitely make often, thanks for sharing the recipe Al P.!

Great fondue. Made it twice. The first time for a 70's party and everybody raved about it.  The second time I made a version without the cayenne for my kids because they don't like spice.  Still very good.

Very easy to make!  Make sure to add the milk AFTER the cheese.  And it works without the veggies in it.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for and it turned out very well.  I faced the problem of cooking with a relative who was making a beef fondue who had her timing off, so I had to leave this over the heat for MUCH longer than expected.  The oil in the cheese started to seperate so I had to keep stirring and stirring it...just a heads up that nothing is wrong with the recipe, it's GREAT but be sure you make it just before it's time to serve!  It was all gone by the end of the evening.

We had a 6 fondue, fondue party and boy did this one steal the show! It was very, very good... We added a bit of cheddar and swiss as the store we went to didn't have enough gruyere, but it couldn't have hurt because it was amazing! Highly recommended...

I made this for Christmas and my mom made it again for another family gathering. Be careful though it does tend to thicken up as it sits in the fondue pot. I think maybe it was just heated and reheated too much.

I made this fondue for our Valentine's dinner and we all loved it.  Tangy and flavorful.  I did use fresh baby spinach instead of frozen and it turned out very good.  Served it with beef, chicken & veggies.  Will make again.  Thanks!

I used this recipe for a fondue party and it was wonderful!  The only change I made was to use Gouda cheese instead of Monterey Jack. I cooked it over med/low heat and took it off the heat just when melted.  Didn't want to overcook it.  It was creamy and delicious!  Definately going to make it again!

I used the conversion for 16 servings, and it was a success among us three. I used 1 package of mixed shredded monterey jack/cheddar cheese and half a package of cream cheese. The cayenne pepper adds kick, and we added more spinach to taste. I would definitely serve this again.

This fondue is the one of the best I have made.  It is soooo simple.  I would maybe half the amount of cream cheese as it made it a little too gritty and thick.  The flavor of the spices and green onion was perfect!  I really recommend it.  It is so nice that the cheeses are very common unlike most fondue recipes.

This was good, but I think it could have used a little more flavor - maybe some garlic salt or italian seasoning.  The cayenne pepper made it spicy, but didn't add any taste.  If I made it again, I would uses less cayenne pepper and experiment with other spices.

This recipe was excellent! I halved the recipe and that yields too much spice. If you halve it, you might want to cut the spices down to 1/3.

Absolutely delicious. We made it for New Year's Eve and everyone licked the pot clean. We even substituted fat free Cream Cheese and it was still wonderful.  Suggested dipping... slightly steamed broccoli and cauliflower and fresh bread cubes.  Yum!!

I love this recipe. I took the advise of some of the reviewers to add the milk after the wine and cheese were incorporated, and had no problems with the milk curdling.  I had to substitute the cayenne pepper because I was out.  I used one teaspoon of SRIRACHA HOT CHILI SAUCE which is used in oriental sauces. It added a spicy garlic flavor. We all love this recipe and will use it again and again.

Thought I'd died and gone to heaven!  I could have eaten the whole thing by myself!  We served it with cubed french bread and thawed, frozen broccoli and cauliflower florets along with fresh mushrooms and green peppers.  Fabulous!!

Excellent!! We started eating before we realized we forgot the cream cheese! The cream cheese helps give it a thicker texture, but it was great without it too!!

Good flavor, although a little spicy (I would omit some of the cayanne). Never got to serve it at the party because the sterno was to hot and burned it. Oh well, it tasted pretty good before being burned!

was good but for some reason turned out somewhat chalky or starchy, probably something I did. I substituted the spinach for salsa.

My husband wouldn't eat it, at all, and I didn't really care for it too much.  I  believe it was the combination of cheeses with the wine -- beer might be a better choice. On the plus side, the consistency was thin, but okay, and it was quite simple to make. I don't think I'll make this again or, if I do, will change the wine to beer and leave out the Jack.

Everyone seemed to love this fondue and it did have a very good taste. I followed previous users directions and added in the milk last and used lemon juice to help with the stringiness.

This was served at a party and there was none left-- I am ultra picky and noticed that it did have a grainy-- not smooth texture. There has to be a way to fix that-- but I am not sure. 

I rated this a 4-- since the taste was good but texture was off-- otherwise this would have been a "5".

I've never even had fondue before so I wasn't sure how this was supposed to turn. It was a little thick, but the flavour was amazing, it was SO good. I made it for a party and everyone loved it. I just threw everything in a slow cooker and let it melt while I was making other stuff for a party.

This is a staple in our house.  Everyone from my husband to my 4-year-old loves it.  The flavors taste better after it has warmed up for a while.  I use half the seasonings because it is too spicy for my kids otherwise.  Beware that the milk will curdle when you heat it up with the wine.  I do not use a separate saucepan, I just pour the wine into the fondue pot and bring it to a boil.  Then I reduce the heat, and add the cheese and milk.  I've made it about 15 times over the last year and do not ever find it to be stringy or without flavor.  There is never any leftover if I make it for a party.

Based on other reviews, I started the fondue with about 1/2 cup of chicken broth, didn't add the milk and wine a the same time, used a squeeze of lemon to avoid stringiness, and added 8 oz. of Gruyere to the mix.  I didn't include the onions or spinach (Dad isn't a fan), but it was still great.  Served with steak, baked potato, and blanched broccoli and cauliflower.  We dipped the veggies and steak into the fondue, and poured a bit on the potatoes - a cheese field day!  Will definitely make again.

We omitted thenions and made this a traditional cheese fondue.  I followed the advice of others and added the milk last.  I had chicken stock and more white wine on hand to thin it if necessary which is was.  I added a little lemon juice to help with the cheese getting too stringy.  We only used 1/2 the cayenne and instead of using garlic powder I just rubbed the instead of the pot with a crushed garlic clove.  My family loved it.  Of the fondues we have tried in the past, my husband says this is his favorite.

This was ok... much thicker than expected.  The spice was nice.  And lemon juice definitely helped make it less grainy.

I had never tried a fondue before, and this was a very good first experience.  I was surprised at how easy and fast it was to cook. I was brave and made some small changes and it still turned out well! (Which I think shows what a good base this recipe is.) I especially liked not having to use flour; I have had some very flourey recipes before and did not enjoy.  If anyone is interested, here's what I did: I simmered a dry Chablis with crushed garlic, then added the cheeses (only used 2 ox of cream cheese though) then I added the milk as needed to smooth it out, along with the spices (no mustard). Finally I tossed in minced onion, tomatoes and poblano peppers. It turned into a great chip dip for our taco night!

This recipe was excellent. I wouldn't change a thing. We put in a little more wine than it called for just because my friend really likes wine, but everything else we did exactly. We had it with homemade bread and apples. It was great! I'd definitely make it again, perhaps for company.

I used this recipe, omitting the veggies, as a basic cheese fondue. (I'm sure I would like it as written, but my hubby and kids don't like spinach).  It was delicious - everyone loved it except the two year old, and she was just in a grumpy mood that night. 

I don't keep alcohol in the house, so I substituted white grape juice for the wine.  I had to use a little more than called for because the fondue got pretty thick.  We served it with french bread cubes, slightly cooked broccoli and cauliflower, and cubed, cooked chicken breast for a complete meal.

Very good fondue!  My kids raved about it and often ask me to make it.  Fondue is our traditional Christmas Eve dinner, but we eat this one more often because it's just too good to eat once a year.  Only complaint is it is grainy, but that doesn't detract from the flavor.  Excellent recipe!

This fondue is awesome!  I ran out of cayenne pepper and only used about 1/2 tsp, but it still had plenty of kick.  I also omitted the spinach.  Excellent flavor and very easy to make!

This fondue tasted delicious, especially with vegetable dippers.  I had a difficult time getting it to the right dipping consistency (I added more milk to make it a little "runnier" because it was really thick at first), but it disappeared in less than 10 minutes anyway!  I would use this recipe again.

I made this for a New Year's Eve Party.  I added some Gouda cheese which required a little extra milk.  Everyone loved it!  We will definetley make thigs again.  Thanks for offering this recipe.

Wonderful!  I cut the cayenne in half and added the milk later with the spices.  The family loved it and my kids ate spinach!  Can't ask for more than that!

Super easy to make and great flavor.  It was a little grainy.  I will definitely make this again, though may reduce the cream cheese to see if that helps.

Wonderful! I made mine with mozarella instead of cheddar, which I think made it drier.  I had to add both extra milk and wine to keep in at fondue consistency.  Regardless, really great with veggies and bread!!

I agree that the cream cheese was a bit grainy. And I did as another person had suggested and hold off on the milk until the wine and cheese had come together.  I was a little apprehesive about the spinach (1/4 cup isn't alot) and onion, but it really made the fondue.

Great recipe! Had this for our annual New Year’s Day fondue and this is the best recipe I’ve tried. I just reduced the amount of cayenne pepper by half and it still had just enough of a kick. This will be my go to cheese fondue recipe for sure

Delightful! I had to add extra wine and milk to make it creamy rather than solid, but otherwise a great recipe, and I really liked that it was made from cheeses that I always have on hand.

I also added gruyere cheese.  It was perfect, unfortunately my fondue pot didn't cooperate with me.  It was either too hot or too cold, and then in all congealed.  Still tasted great though!!

I made this for the first time for a birthday dinner with friends. My friends liked it and ate most of it, however I thought it was too grainy and was disappointed with its texture. Flavor was good, but I didn't care for the thickness or texture. Won't make this again. I am looking for a smoother cheese fondue recipe. Guess I will have to try it out before I serve it at a party!

This is the best stuff. You have to let it simmer for a few minutes after you add the spices before the true flavor comes out, but when it does 8-D

This fondue turned out great! My husband's grandmother gave us a fondue pot as a wedding gift, so we had her over for dinner to try it out for the first time. This recipe was a hit with all 3 of us. The only changes I made were to use a little less cayenne pepper (I wasn't sure if our guest likes spicy things) & added a little more milk to thin it out. Thanks so much...we'll definitely use this recipe again & again! :)

The flavor of this was very good but the texture was....different.  Not bad just a little strange.  Probably my error since I'm a bigginner at fondue.  I may try this one again sometime.

Easy, but way too thick and to be honest, I didn't think it had too much flavor.  I added additional seasoning even!  Not sure we'll try this one again.

Great recipe! This was a hit with my friends - I had read that the leftovers made great sauce for mac-n-cheese...alas, I had no leftovers to try that with! (I even bought macaroni...). Only change was that I added just 1/2 the cayenne, and it was still plenty spicy. Will make again for sure!

I heated chicken stock in the bottom of the pan before I added cheese. At the end of the cooking time. I added the milk, more stock and wine until I had the consistency I wanted.
I have never made fondue before so I can't compare it with another recipe. This fondue was a hit at Christmas. I put tons of stuff on the table to go with it. Of course brread but also sauted veggy-meats. Oysters (cooked before) were the favorite with my family.

I, too, left out the green onion and spinach.  It gets 5 stars for ease and smoothness (it had a slightly grainy quality, but melted cheese always does), but I'm only giving it 4 because I felt it had too much cayenne pepper.  I only used 3/4 teaspoon, too.  Everyone liked it, but the strong spiciness kind of covered up the cheese and wine flavors.  Next time I'll only use 1/4 teaspoon.  I served it with french bread cubes, cubed turkey breast, shrimp, olives, steamed broccoli and carrots, baked french fries, cherry tomatoes and apples.  Will definitely make this again as we really enjoyed it.  It will be interesting to try with, say, swiss cheese instead of monterey jack.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried the recipe and it turned out "grainy", not a good consistancy.
But I added lots of garlic (don't think that that was the reason for the strange texture) and very high quality cheeses, so everyone loved the flavor.
They ate lots and lots even after so many other appetizers.
I'll have to work with this again and see what went wrong with the texture.

I did not like this! It had good flavor but was just too grain-y. 

I will not make it again

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great too! We made it for an anniversary party last year and need to make it again this year, so I had to find the recipe! Try it with some "Everything" sliced bakery bread and you wont want to eat anything else!

Very yummy, but I didn't care for the way it felt in my mouth!  Others said that the cream cheese was grainy...maybe that was it...not sure how to tell which cheese caused that feeling!
