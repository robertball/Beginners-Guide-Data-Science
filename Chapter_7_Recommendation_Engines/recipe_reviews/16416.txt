This is the most amazing recipe on this site.  I make it ALL the time and have never failed to get compliments.  Here are my successfully tried changes (makes it a little easier):  Use dried minced onion instead of fresh grated. Like many other reviewers, I replace half (or more) of the water with pineapple juice -- yum -- and I use pineapple chunks instead of rings, added to the pan in the last ten minutes of baking.  One time, I was making this for company, and already had all the chicken in the pan with the sauce, ready to go in the oven, when I decided I didn't have enough chicken, so I took some raw pieces and breaded them, and threw them in, hoping for the best.  In the end, we liked those pieces better (they're softer), so since then, I always skip the frying step -- it's a lot easier, and one less dish to wash.  Another tip I read in the reviews was the cut the cutlets up into smaller pieces -- this really makes it good.  Make a lot of extra sauce and serve over rice.  You won't regret making this recipe.

Where do I start?  I have some issues with this recipe...First, when it came out of the oven, it looked and smelled great - couldn't wait to try it.  But, the chicken just didn't taste very seasoned.  I think it needs to be seasoned enough on its own because it just tasted like plain chicken smothered with the sweet sauce.  Second, the cooking time :  there is no way in HE-double hockey sticks this chicken could stay in the oven for a full hour, especially after already being in the pan for 7 minutes!  I left mine in for no more than 25mins (granted I halved the recipe) and it was overdone.  I'd say check it to make sure the juices are clear, but even my super slow oven would've completely ruined the chicken after an hour.  I will consider making this recipe again because it is so asthetically pleasing, but I will make big seasoning changes and obviously alter the cooking time.

I was really not into making this.  It just didnt appeal to me really.  But, I was looking for something the kids would like and I had all the ingredients on hand.  This was a huge hit at my house!  After a week of nearly having to force my 8 year old to eat dinner.. I was thrilled to see him eat every single bite on his plate.  I served it with white rice.  The breading was soggy, and I dont know how to get around that.  I thought about leaving it off the next time, but it really does have nice flavor.  Even if it was soggy, it tasted good.  It is a bit on the sweet side, but in a good way.  Will be keeping this one.  I would be giving it five stars, if it wasnt for the soggy breading.  Which didnt bother anyone but me.***after making this for several months as a regular around here, I can highly recommend not covering the dish.  It comes out much less soggy, and the sauce thickens up***

I skipped the dredging and browning on stove top, pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/2 inch thick and seasoned with the oregano, salt, ground black pepper, then followed the recipe for the sauce.  I baked it for 25 minutes and it turned out very tender and tasty!

The sauce really reminded me of your typical American General Tso's chicken sauce.  If you added in some dry chilli peppers or just a few pinches of cayenne, I bet the sauce would be just perfect.

If you want to make chicken that has the consistency of Chinese chicken, do the following.

1. Cut your chicken (breasts or thighs work) into cubes.
2. Put them in a bowl with egg, s&p for 15-30 min.
3. Put a ton of Cornstarch on a baking tray and spread it out.
4. Batter each piece of chicken and deep fry them at about 375 till golden brown.

From there you can just add the sauce any old way... throw it in a sautee pan with the chicken and bring the sauce to a boil... it'll latch right on to the chicken.

Serve with yummy eggrolls and Mike's Hard Lemonade.  (if you want a good eggroll recipe, just ask).

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe!  I halved the ingredients for just the two of us and baked the chicken for 1/2 hour and it was perfect!

I thought this was good.  After reading the reviews, I skipped on breading the chicken and just floured it.  I also halved the sugar and I'm glad I did because it was still a little sweet in the end.  I didn't have any pineapple on hand and I think it would've been an excellent compliment to the dish. I served this over rice with spinach on the side and it was a nice change. Thanks

After seeing all of the rave reviews on this one, I decided to try this dish. It took quite some time to prepare and I followed to directions to the letter. 

The end result was not what I was expecting. It had an odd taste. It was horribly sweet with the pinapple and the glaze on the top and just didn't go well with chicken at all. And the oregano that was put in the breading definately did not go with the sweetness of the glaze either. 

Maybe it's just me, but I didn't like this dish at all. I ate one piece and threw the rest in the trash.

I need to update my review of this recipe.  I have made this a couple times now and we just love it!  I only use 3-4 chicken breasts since its just two of us and I keep the full amount of the sauce.  After sauteing the chicken, I make the sauce in the same pan and scrape up all the yummy bits left in the bottom from the chicken.  I then let the sauce simmer for about 5-6 min to let it reduce slightly.  I bake everything in the oven without covering, for aprox. 25-30 min.  When it comes out the sauce will have reduced and thickened more and the chicken is coated nicely.  I slice the chicken and serve over white rice with more of that yummy sauce poured over top.  It makes a great dish!  Nice and sweet and flavorful!  This is a favorite for us!  Add some cayenne for a little spice!

This is the best chicken I've ever had! It seems like a lot of work, but it's really easy. Instead of using water, I used the pineapple juice from the sliced pineapples. It gave it a little more flavor and it turned out EXCELLENT!!!

YMmmy, the sauce tasted great!  I didn't even bother with the bread crumbs and flour, just heat the pan with a little oil, brown the chicken and pour the sauce over chicken, cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes and serve over rice.  i did reduce the brown suger to about 1 cup.  Thanks!

We had a family dinner with 10 people and everyone enjoyed this. There were 3 grown men and 3 small kids and it was a hit with everybody. I am really glad I found this recipe. I used tenderloins instead of breasts and only baked them for about 20 mins. after cooking in the skillet. I also poured a can of pineapple chunks with the juice over the sauce before baking and that was really good. The sauce never got sticky, it stayed pretty thin. But that was fine since I served this with jasmine rice and spooned the sauce over the chicken and rice together. My sis-in-law and I both thought it was a bit sweet so next time I will cut back a bit on the brown sugar. Both husbands though clearly expressed how much they loved it and wouldn't mind if we made it again.

This is my family's favorite dish.  I do not bread the chicken, but instead just put the uncooked chicken in the baking dish and cover with the boiled sauce and bake until done.  Sometimes I replace the water with pineapple juice, but the recipe is just as good with water.  This is a simple and flavorful dish.  Serve with rice to soak up every bit of sauce.

This has become part of my regular recipe rotation!  I use 1.25 lbs of chicken breast tenders (or cut breasts into smaller pieces).  That way, each piece has more flavor and you only have to bake it 25-30 minutes.  Kids love it!

WOW  this is great - I cut chicken into tenders and added a dash of cayenne, and used apple juice instead of water  this tasted like General Tso's chicken at your local chinese restaurant only better.  Really really  yummy  Also I left the foil off and turned the chicken 1/2 way and the chicken was perfect and the sauce thicken really nice.  Cook time is off though so watch it,

This dish left the chicken juicy and very tasty.  I used Ritz cracker crumbs in place of the bread crumbs and they did not turn soggy.  I almost gave the recipe 5 stars but I thought the sauce was a bit overpowering.  Also, try using mild salsa in place of the ketchup, the flavor is great!

omg, I've never seen such a collection of licked-clean plates!!  Very delish and I agree it is worth it to fry the chicken first.  

What I changed - 1/2 way through baking time I added 3 chopped peppers (1 red, 1 yellow, 1 orange).  Also added pineapple 10 minutes before end of cooking.  Used one whole fresh pineapple, could have used less.  

I also agree that the oregano isn't quite right - with such a tangy sauce, I would eliminate it entirely.  It is not needed.  

Yummy!!

Boyfriend was looking at the ingredients as I was mixing and he swore this wasn't going to taste good but we were both pleasantly surprised. I only left out the mustard (didn't have any) and left off the pineapple rings, and this came out very nice, not too sweet and very flavorful. Definitely make sure you have enough sauce for rice! My only issue is not with the sauce or flavor but the breading- If I'm going to fry chicken I usually coat it in eggs before dredging the chicken in bread crumbs, flour, etc. The recipe didn't call for eggs so I decided to go by the book and dredge the chicken without eggs, but the coating didn't hold up well in the frying pan and a lot of it came off the chicken, so next time I'll coat in eggs first like I usually do.

This turned out excellent!  I made a few adjustments- less breadcrumbs (use 1/2 cup at most), 1/2 tsp pepper (not a whole tsp), add 1 tsp onion powder, no need to add salt to the sauce, and no need to grease the pan.  Plus I chopped the onion instead of grating it and it worked just fine.  I omitted the pineapple- no need to add sweetness.  This is a delicious dinner!

Very good chicken!  My family loved it served over rice. There are only 4 of us, so I cut the recipe in half and made it in a 9x9 pan which reduced the baking time to 35-40 minutes.  I recommend this one!

After reading the many reviews that claimed the breading got soggy, I decided to go ahead and make the chicken by skipping the breading step. I cooked the chicken in the sauce and it was delicious over white rice. Very good. I may try it again in the future with the breading step, but I can't see how it won't get soggy.

I thought this had wonderful flavor, but I didn't like the texture, it was a little mushy.  Next time, I will not cover while baking & put it under
the broiler for a minute.  We like our food a little crunchy!!

I've made this recipe twice.  Even the pickiest eater in my family loves it.  I added a dash of cayenne and made the sauce several hours ahead of time to allow the flavors to mingle and the sauce to thicken up.

I cut the brown sugar way down to 1/4 cup and replaced the water with pineapple juice.

This was pretty good.  Tasted like Chinese food.  Used a little more than a cup of brown sugar and it was still a bit too sweet.  I used spicy yellow mustard and it gave it a tiny little kick.

I tried a version of this recipe based on a suggestion from another review. I used chicken tenderloin and cut into cubes, soaked in eggs beaten, battered in lots of cornstarch, then fried in veg. oil. Poured sauce from this recipe on cooked chicken and served over rice (no pineapple) and it was just like it came from the Chinese restaurant. My family loved it!

This recipe was very good and smelled wonderful while cooking.  However, I did make several changes to the original recipe per suggestions from other reviewers.  I did not bread the chicken breasts or brown them.  Instead, I rubbed them with olive oil, sprinkled them with salt, pepper, oregano, and red pepper flakes, and placed them in a baking dish sprayed with PAM.  Then I spread one 20 oz. can of unsweetened pineapple chunks in its own juice (drained) evenly over the top of the chicken, and covered it all with the sauce.  For the sauce, I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, chopped the onion instead of grating it, and substituted 1/2 cup of Pace Medium Picante Sauce in place of the 1/2 cup of ketchup.  The sauce was very thin, so next time I will probably thicken it with a little corn starch or Arrowroot, and may also add some chopped bell pepper.  I used an 8 x 8 x 2 glass baking dish and baked this un-covered in a 350 degree oven for about 50 minutes.  As there are just 2 of us, I only used 4 chicken breasts, and I served this over brown rice.  Very delicious!

This was really good, but it was way too sweet! I will make this again, but cut the sugar amount by at least half. I really like the sweet and sour chicken recipe from this site better, absolutely wonderful.

Very good flavor, and the chicken was tender.
But, the consistency of the coating when done was "squishy".  Next time, I'll turn the chicken upside down, when serving onto each plate.

Definitely different, but so tasty!  I've made it twice, now, once with breasts, another time with thighs because company I had preferred dark meat.  Definitely a repeat recipe when pineapples are in season!

This is a very good recipe. I love the sauce. I did not add water to my sauce and it was thick and yummy. The kids really liked it as well. This should be added as a kid friendly recipe. Thanks for sharing. I will make this again. Served with white rice with butter,salt and pepper. Would be great with fried rice and egg rolls also. Will try the left over with fried rice and egg rolls.

This was amazing! My boyfriend wanted to give it 10 stars. Used eggs to hold the breadcrumb mixture, also replaced the water with the pineapple juice as another reviewer suggested and added a dash of cayanne pepper. We cooked this a bit longer on the stove so didn't take as long in the oven, only about 25 minutes. Served with white rice and mixed veggies. Will make this again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent. Changed a few things.  As per other reviews used 1 cup pineappe juice, and 1/4 cup water.  Did not put in oven, browned chicken and added remaining ingredients in skillet simmered about 20 minutes.  Turned out wonderful and made things easier.

Excellent sauce!  I made the sauce in the quantity posted and used only four chicken breasts.  That seemed to be enough sauce for the chicken and white rice.  If you are planning on making more chicken than 4 pieces I would definitely double the sauce!  For the chicken I substituted Italian bread crumbs, left out the seasonings, but added crushed almonds.  Delicious!  As per some other cooks, I also reduced cooking time to about 40 minutes and left the cover off for the last 15.

Very tasty!  I agreed with other reviewers - the chicken only needed to be baked for about 45 minutes, the breading on the chicken was soggy (I'll take the foil off next time the last 15 minutes.  I added some garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture & I used pineapple juice from the pineapple rings in the sauce instead of water.  This dish was similar to BBQ sauce and sweet & sour sauce, so it definitely is different!  Will make again.

I made this recipe exactly like it said.  My husband and I both rated it a 7 (10 being the highest).  We both love chinese food and thought that this tasted similiar to General Tso's Chicken.  I served it over rice and with eggrolls. We loved it!! If you are thinking about making this ~ please consider chicken flavored rice. Next time I will however omit the oregano because I just didnt think that the spice mixed well with the sweet n sour taste. This recipe will definitly be served agian at my table.  Thanks alot.

My husband and kids love this, this is all they want to eat now. We make it without the breading though, I just pour the sauce over the chicken and bake it, the breading makes it soggy.

I thought that this was going to be excellent after I read all the rave reviews.  I even followed the "hints" like cut the chicken into cubes and use pineapple juice instead of water.  This dish was alright - my husband could not eat it because it was so sweet.  I wouldn't suggest putting the sauce over rice - it's WAY too sweet.  I WOULD definately use this recipe to bring as an appetizer to a party.  I would not recommend it as an entree.

I scaled this recipe to 6 chicken breasts and forgot to add the pineapple at the end, which was okay as it wasn't missed.  Nice taste and the dish was well received. Even though there is a long ingrediant list, don't be overwhelmed, it really is easy dinner and a snap to make.

This recipe was wonderful!  I used a suggestion below and lightly grilled the breaded chicken and then added a little cayenne pepper to the sauce.  As some other reviews suggested, the sauce tasted like a general tso's or sesame chicken type sauce.  I also added some broccoli (just for me)and doubled the sauce (for my husband who is the heavy saucy type)  The sauce was very tasty, very easy to make and relatively inexpensive.  The directions were wonderful!  I also let the sauce sit for a while to thicken up.  Overall, a great experience.  I will definitely prepare again.

I only make half of this recipe for my family of 4. I butterfly my chicken breasts (I use 3 breasts), but all of the sauce. I use seasoned bread crumbs and omit the oregano. I brown the chicken in olive oil, and then pour the sauce over top and add diced pineapple and green peppers before baking.  For the sauce, I omit the salt, use only a cup of brown sugar and replace the water with the pineapple juice. It turns out great every time! I serve it over rice.

The sauce in this recipe is GREAT. I tried it both ways, I breaded and browned the chicken as the recipe called for and I skipped the browning another time. Both were great. Browning the chicken makes for a more appealing look. The only reason i did not give this recipe five stars is becasue this recipe is best eaten right away. If you leave the chicken to sit out for too long the chicken becomes dry and the sauce is sucked uped by serving time. In this case I made a second batch of sauce and left on the side for people who needed extra sauce.

This was great. It remember me of Empress Chicken from the Chinese restaurant. Like some others noted, I reduced the cooking time in half, and it turned out perfect. I served it with the sauce spooned over brown rice. Everyone loved it!

This was good.  The kids liked it.  I omitted the pineapple so that the kids would eat it.

I followed this recipe exactly and i was not too impressed w/ the results. I found the chicken to be bland .. the sauce was good but the chicken really needed some seasoning or something ... i think that if I make this receipe again I will add something chili pepper or jalepenos to spice it up a little and I will season the chicken for sure.

Would be great with a little more spice to balance out the sweet.  I like my pineapples cooked so I put them on before baking and poured the sauce over them.  I also used pineapple juice instead of water like many others have done.  Will be making this again with a bit of cayenne or other spicy pepper added.

This was out of this world amazing!!!The sauce was really really good is great over rice. I Also loved the pineapple and chicken together!! I skipped the breadcrumbs, halfed the sugar and used pineapple juice instead of water(next time going to use pineapple chunks) Also only took 20 mins to cook.. but everything else I went by the book. I ate two chicken breast and I rarely do that and wanted even more lol I just couldnt stop eating it...Thanks so much a great meal to impress:)

I read all the reviews and took the suggestions of several, and it turned out great. First, you do NOT need to fry the chicken. I fried half my pieces, and didn't fry the other half. We prefered the non-fried pieces, as they were more moist. Also: Cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup (I can't imagine how sweet it would be with another cup.) I used 1/2 C. of pineapple juice from the canned pineapple rings, and 1/4 C. water,which helped add back some of the sweetness from the omitted brown sugar. I cut the split chicken breasts in half (or more), dredged the chicken in egg/milk wash before breadcrumbs. Used Garlic herb bread crumbs instead of the regular crumbs and spices. Poured the sauce over the fried, and unfried pieces, and baked for 30 minutes uncovered, then, added pineapple chunks, and cooked for 15 more minutes uncovered.  Very sweet, and yummy. (My favorite Chicken recipe on this site is still the Bourbon Pecan Chicken!) I gave this recipe four stars because it was very, very good, but a little sweet to make it five star for me.

This is one of our favorites now - we make it all of the time.  My husband asks for it repeatedly.  The only change I made was to substitute pineapple juice from the sliced pinapples in place of the water asked for. Made it even better.

Tasty, but the breadcrumbs ended up being all soggy by the end.  I suppose that was to be expected, but next time I think I will fry a little longer first and then take the foil off for 15 minutes at the end.  As per other reviews I halved the crumb mixture, cut the sugar by almost half, added pinapple chunks 10 minutes before end of baking time, and cut baking time down to 40 minutes.  Oh, and I only used 5 chicken breasts but made all the sauce so I would have some  to top off my rice - was too much sauce, I think the original amount would have sufficed!  Will be making again.

MrsMutt here again!  This is going to be my second review of this recipe!  I just wanted to tell you that last night I made this recipe using using a boneless prok loin, cut into chunks, and oh-my-goodness, heavenly!  I was so hungry for this sauce over rice, and I had already taken out the roast for dinner, so I went with it.  I chunked the pork, and breaded it, losing a lot of the bread crumbs because the pork was not as wet as the chicken and they didn't stick, but it didn't matter. The pieces dredged in the flour and the spices browned nicely.  Then when I went to make the sauce, I didn't have pineapple rings or chunks, but I did have crushed, so I made the sauce with the crushed pineapple and its juice, which resulted in a chunky sauce, and it was devine!  My husband actually is not a big chicken fan, and I started making this with boneless thighs (more flavor), but now that I've done the pork, he is even happier.  Over rice and with a side of snowpeas - who needs to go out.  This one is a winner for sure.

This is a really good recipe.  I didn't bread the chicken and it turned out great--very tender.  I did, however, drain the sauce after baking and add cornstarch to thicken some, then poured it over the chicken--much better this way. I used pineapple tidbits instead of rings.  I also will try a little less sugar next time.

This recipe was good but I don't think that the bread crumbs do it any justice.  Next time I might just put the chicken in the sauce without the breadcrubms.
The sauce is to die for and is great with french fries or a baked potato topping

great recipe, but I did follow other suggestions to cut sugar in half and also black pepper in half.  I put crushed pineapple on top of the chicken and poured the sauce over it.

I have five kids and they all loved this and ate it( until the picky ones found out there was ketchup and mustard in it).  I didn't have pineapple rings in the house so I just threw in a can of crushed pineapple.  I also used bone-in chicken breasts.  This was great.  Very tasty, tender, and great over any type of rice.  We'll have it again!

I really liked this recipe.  I scaled it to serve four.  As some had suggested, I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and cooked for only forty minutes.  I put it over rice.  I had leftovers on spaghetti noodles.  Over noodles is much better than over rice.

Absolutely fabulous!  It was easy to make and everyone that was over for dinner loved it.  I will definitely make this again (maybe even to impress my mom the next time she's over).  I would suggest that you try it as well.  :)

I scaled this to 2 servings...My husband & I both enjoyed it- 4 stars.  I forgot to put pineapple on it, but it still had that "oriental" taste.  I did not have white rice on hand, but I will definately serve it over rice next time.  It would've been the perfect compliment to the tangy chicken.  Bake time of 1/2 hr was plenty.  I will keep this one!

My whole family loved this! The second time I made it, I didn't bother to bread the chicken- just cut into cubes and cooked with the sauce. It was even better that way! Goes great with rice. Thanks!

OMG...this recipe is delicious!!  The only changes I did make were I didn't add the flour to the bread crumbs, I ran out of oregano so I used italian seasoning, paprika and poultry seasoning. I was out of prepared mustard so I used honey dijon mustard.  I changed the servings to 2 and doubled the recipe from there for the sauce.  There was just enough sauce.  I was worried about the sauce because of the brown sugar..It was amazing...I feel however the cooking time as another reviewer said it does not take an hour to bake..I'm going to say maybe 30 mins maybe a little longer...But for sure don't put it in for an hour and forget it...Overall a great recipe and I will make it again!!!YUM!!

OMG, I made this recipe for supper last night using twkitchen's adaptations.  I had to let you know that I think its better the 2nd day!!  I made extra sauce and that has to be spooned over the meat and rice when its served.  The sauce is what has the flavor imho.  We had frozem mixed vegetables on the side.  My son mixed his vegetables with the rice so to  me, it is like a faux Chinese dinner.  Chinese is usually sweet and sour pork, but this uses chicken.  I have salmon and almost tried it with salmon instead of chicken.  Next time I might do that!  I was wondering if anyone ever tried putting corn starch into the sauce to thicken it?  Bon Apetite

500 stars! Modifications: I breaded the raw chicken, made the sauce with some pineapple juice from crushed pineapple, added a bit of crushed pineapple also (eyeballed it) and put it in the oven, after the sauce boiled, covered with foil. I had 4 thin chicken breasts so 350 for 35 minutes was enough. DELICIOUS! All because I had some crushed pineapple leftover to use. Served with 0 second whole grain rice and topped w some crushed pineapple on the plate.  New favorite!

I made this last night, and the whole family liked the sweet and tangy flavor.  The oregano makes it a little more memorable, but I don't really think the bread crumbs are necessary, so next time I will try without the bread crumbs.

This is amazingly good!I made a few changes due to reading previous reviews.  I didn't bother with browning the meat, I added a bit of cayenne pepper, used garlic salt instead of salt, and used dried onion.  Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I stuck with the original recipe except I used 3 chicken leg quarters cut apart. Since I do not have two baking pans, I used a cookie sheet and basted the sauce every fifteen minutes. Turned out fantastic!

There are NO leftovers. I made some of the changes suggested, like skipping the oregano and not bothering to fry the chicken. I did dip the chicken in egg, rolled it in cornmeal, and then used coarse crumbs (like Panko). I doubled the sauce, kowing my family would pour more over the chicken and rice when served. Figuring my family liked a little kick, I used salsa (not ketchup), zingy yellow mustard (not the quiet stuff), some jalepenos, pinch of cayenne, garlic powder (got too lazy to use the real stuff),and orange juice (having no pineapples in the house). Oh, and dry minced onion works fine. Don't even try to bake it for an hour; you may as throw it out. I did 30 minutes, then kicked it under the broiler for 5 more. Did not cover it. Big hit.

Had this last night.  Didn't have time to watch oven, busy day.  I only had four huge bone in breasts with skin on.  I doubled recipe because these were REALLY BIG!!  Threw everything into crockpot, substituted water for pineapple juice.  Put on low - came back 6 hrs later and the chicken had fallen off bone....so, I removed and cut up chicken, strained the sauce(because of bone), added fresh pineapple and thickened with some cornstarch, threw cut up chicken in and put all back in crock.  Had some unexpected guests and 6 quart crockpot full was emptied in less than an hour.  I put it over rice.  Grandkids had thirds, and my guests all wanted the recipe.  Sided with green beans from the garden!  Very good!!!

I tried this recipe tonight for my family. It was only slightly above average. I halved the recipe and then followed the recipe with minimal changes. I added sauteed bell pepper and onion in to the chicken, which I cubed for faster cooking and also pre-seasoned with Mrs. Dash, garlic powder and black pepper. I lessened the sugar to 1/2 cup since it had been reviewed as too sweet. I also thickened the sauce with a cornstarch and water solution (based on other reviewers saying the sauce was too thin and my own experience of it looking a bit watery). With the smaller pieces of chicken, I only kept it in the oven for 10 min as most of the cooking was done on the stove. In the end, I found the sauce much too sweet, even with the reduced amount of sugar.  My husband and my toddler both seemed to enjoy it though, which is why I give this recipe 3 stars instead of 2.  I may make it again, but even less sugar will need to be used.

Tried this recipe for the first time tonight, and yummy...yum yum!! Here are a few suggestions I used, and that we loved. I did the sauce as directed, and added a few dashes of cayanne. As for the chicken,(I used 3 chicken breasts) I took another reviewers suggestion and 1.)Cut chicken breasts into cubes and placed them in a bowl with two beaten eggs, salt & pepper(to taste). Allow the chicken to sit in egg mixture 15-30mins. 2.) Take a cookie sheet(or baking sheet)cover with foil, and spread a decent amount of cornstarch on it and bread your cubed chicken pieces. 3.)Deep fry chicken pieces at 375 degrees until golden brown. 4.)Allow chicken to de-grease on a paper-lined plate. Now bring sauce to a boil and add fried chicken pieces and allow the sauce to  adhere to chicken in boiling sauce for 10mins or so. I served the chicken over sticky rice/sweet rice with pineapple chunks....and fiancee licked the plate clean!! It is one of our favorite new recipes, and look forward to making it many times in the future.

I had read the reviews, and this is what worked for me.  I'm sure the recipe would've stood great on it's own.  I used dark meat chicken and skipped the breading step completely.  I added a little less brown sugar to our taste...so about a little over 1/2c packed, but I used honey mustard to make up for the loss of sweetness.  I found the recipe to be very yummy and would even cut down the sugar a little more if you have very ripe pineapples like I did (I used fresh).  The flavor was basically chicken in smokey bbq sauce with the sweetness of the pineapple.  Definitely a repeat.

I like to halve this recipe and also cut the chicken breasts into chunks.  Then I season and coat the chunks in corn starch rather than flour and crumbs.  I flash fry them only to light brown.  Then I remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon and place in a glass casserole dish.  Pour the sauce over and top with pineapple the last 10 min.  Cooking time varies.  For me, it takes about 20 min in the oven.  Love this recipe.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe although I think the sauce could have used slightly less sugar. However, I used the sauce on salmon the next night and loved it even more. Thanks for the great recipe!

Omigosh, this is such an amazing recipe. I got better satisfied faces from my family than with anything else I ever made. I do not like white meat chicken, but I loved this. I used crushed stovetop instead of bread crumbs, and used what was left in mashed potatoes. I also cooked Swiss Chard greens and ribs. It was a perfect dinner.

The only reason I made this was because of all the positive reviews and the fact that I had everything in the recipe in the house. I was very pleasantly surprised and my husband liked this. It makes plenty of leftovers too. The only thing I might modify in the future is the amount of brown sugar. The sauce is extremely sweet.

This turned out really good.  I think it tastes a lot like good General Taos Chicken...or good enough.  I skipped the frying step and just coated/cooked with the sauce.  I made it with crushed pineapple (because it was all I had) and it turned out great.  DH has requested it several times.  Thanks.

Absolutely delicious.  The only thing I didn't use was the pineapple rings.  Otherwise I cut everything in half. (We didn't need 10 breasts..)  Wonderful, my husband loved it.  It's going into the rotation. Thanks for sharing it!

I loved it! I changed the recipe a little bit by pouring 6 ounces of pineapple juice in with the wet ingredients instead of placing pineapple slices on top of the chicken. I made brown rice with this and placed the chicken and some juice on top the rice. It was sooooooo good.

I liked this recipe, but think it could be improved with expirimentation. I'll definitely use pineapple juice instead of water next time, and probably less of the crumb mixture (mine ended up a little thick and soggy). I made three chicken breasts and only needed to bake for 20 minutes after the pan fry--I may skip both that and the bread crumbs (at least not as much) next time. I'll also bake the pineapple on top for 5-10 mins at the end, and perhaps use chunks on the side. Lastly, I'll likely cut down on the brown sugar a little so it's not quite so sweet...

GREAT Chicken recipe!  I stumbled upon this when I had chicken defrosting, but couldn't think of anything "new" to do with it.  My 8 yr. old LOVES it.  Gave it a "million" stars.  This is a keeper for sure!  I was afraid of the Soy sauce, but fear not this recipe is exactly right!

I did 9 breast halves because that's all I had but it all fit in one 9x11 baking dish just slightly overlapped on the thin side of the breast. There was plenty of sauce and the flavor is amazing and is actually better the next day!  I served it on top of a mound of jasmine rice which soaks up the sauce beautifully.  I did take the advice of a couple of reviewers and cut the salt in half which seemed not to affect the flavor at all, and I also added two chopped dried red chiles to the sauce  for a little heat spice and it was perfect.  I had a fresh pineapple on hand which made all the difference in the world in this recipe and I placed the pineapple on the chicken half way through the cooking time to ensure its tenderness.  This was a knock out recipe and makes perfect leftovers for lunch!

This was really good! Definitely had an asian zing to it! I rated it a 4 because I had to adjust the sauce a little bit...the mustard flavor was too strong. I just added some more pinapple juice in place of the water and some more worchestershire sauce and baked and it came out great! It made plenty of sauce so it over rice. Yum!

Being a pineapple fan, I had to try this one!  I read quite a few of the reviews and made some of my own modifications. It turned out pretty yummy! Mods to Sauce:  1/2 the brown sugar in the sauce and low sodium soy sauce.  I also used 1/2 pineapple juice and 1/2 water, no salt. Covered, it didn't thicken very much so I added a little bit of cornstarch. Mods to Breading:  I used italian seasoning and some dried parsley instead of oregano.  1/4 tsp of the salt instead of 2 tsps.   I made sure the breading was nice and crisp before I put it in my pan with the sauce. No cover. My family enjoyed this one :)

Fabulous and easy. I baked my thin cut breasts for 30 minutes and did not cover.  (I even added some veggies and baked with chicken.)  Tasted like something you would find at popular fast food Asian restaurants and was a hit with entire family!

This was really tasty..didn;t give it 5 stars because the sauce was kinda runny and not real thick however it was perfect when reheated the following day. Afew things I did different: cut back on the sugar and compensated 1 tbsp of cornstartch for thickening purposes. added some garlic powder, peeper and fresh cilantro to taste. Threw in some sauteed veggies. I used the canned pineapple juice instead of water and added the chunks of pineapple into the sauce to cook. My husband and kids loved it!!

I made a few changes to the recipe. I didn't feel it needed to be fried before it was baked. Instead on pineapple sliced on top, we added approx. 1/4 a can of crushed pineapple to the sauce. It was delicious

This was sooooooooo good! I used the pineapple juice in place of the water, and cut up the pineapple and added to the chicken. Surved over rice, just as good, if not better than General Tso's chicken from the local Chinese place!

We couldn't believe how great this tasted!

I put the full amount of sauce (pineapple juice instead of water) over 6 chicken breasts and baked it for about 40 minutes.

I did not bread or even sear the chicken breasts--just put them straight from the flour/salt/pepper/oregano mixture to the baking dish (lined with parchment). Pineapple bits went on the last 15 mins. of baking.

I served it with brown rice. Yummy! My husband asked me to make it again tomorrow.  :)

This was very good. My boyfriend suggested I cut the mustard in half next time. I followed other reviews and did not bread the chicken, I browned in the skillet then baked uncovered for 30 mins.

This is my favorite recipe. Someone had given me this recipe years ago and I lost it. I am so glad I found it on here. I agree that it does not take an hour to cook. Also it is great with out frying it if you want a quicker cleaner meal. I keep the recipe for the sauce on my fridge because I use in on several things like chicken wings! That is one of our favorites!

Such a simple dish, all ingredients on hand, and gourmet tasting too. This was sweet but very good and we all liked this one a lot. DH even gave this a 5. He rarely eats pineapple and ate all of this one. I would cut back the brown sugar a little next time. I put the pineapple on the top before I baked this so the pineapple would cook in too. Thanks Judi for this keeper.

My fiance loved it!!!!  He told me he likes it even more than meatloaf.  He's a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy, so that's a real compliment!!

I halved the sugar, used all pineapple juice instead of water, and only made three breasts using the conversions.  I baked it for 40 minutes and then added the pineapple tidbits instead of rings.  The tidbits that were down in the sauce were awesome!!  Next time, I'll make sure they're all in the sauce and not on top of the chicken. :)  Yummy recipe!!

This looked good to me and had good ratings, so I tried it out on my wife, my brother and his wife. They absolutely raved about the chicken! This is easy to do with ingredients that are very common to almost any kitchen. We will repeat this many times!

I thought that this recipe was a little too sweet. I will definetly make it again but I will put less brown sugar. I couldn't imagine adding pineapple juice in place of the water for the fact of all of the sugars in the juice. I also didn't brown it in the skillet first. I try to cut out any unnessary fats that I can but I think it would be good to maybe cook the bread crumbs to the chicken before baking. All in all, this was a good recipe and I will make it again. Thank you for the idea!

WONDERFUL!! I love anything with a lot of flavor, and this was great. I was a little bit concerned that it would be too sweet for me, but it was perfect. My husband was shocked at the amount of taste. He asked to look at the recipe, and see what all was in it cause he thought it was so good. He wanted seconds, but there were none. Needless to say, we've made it several times since.

This was just alright. I wasn't sure if the flavor was trying for asian or something else since the oregano taste was a little strong. And the chicken, while moist, did not hold a lot of flavor. It was worth a shot, though, since it had gotten so many good reviews, and the pineapple makes it better.

My family said this was very tasty and even my picky husband liked it. Me though, it was way too tangy for my taste. I have to give it four stars because I'm the only one who didn't think it was that great. I did skip the frying step as suggested in the other reviews and substituted 1/2 the water for pineapple juice, maybe that was it? I'll be making these again anyway.

This was definitely a contender in "what to serve twenty five guests at our post dance recital party" next weekend. I normally am not fond of mixing sweet and savory, however, I thought this was absolutely wonderful. I added just a tad of cayenne to give the sauce a little zip. As others suggested, I doubled the sauce and I'm glad I did because much of it carmalized and cooked down. Hubby rated this a three because he felt the sauce tasted too much like barbeque sauce. He has no clue what he's talking about. It tasted nothing like it, but then again, this is coming from someone who can't tell the difference between a tuna and a chicken salad sandwich. Anyway Judi, the girls and I loved it. Thanks!

This recipe was awesome!  The chicken was moist and delicious.  Instead of pineapple I used mandarin oranges, and the taste was delicious.  I invited my parents over for dinner with this dish, and they said it was as good as gourmet!  This is definately something to try for guests or family.  Yum Yum!

This is an awsome dinner dish. My husband does not like to try new things so I was a bit worried but he loved it... Hi five to the receipe donor...I only changed one thing and that was I used panko bread crumbs (chinese bread crumbs)instead of regular ones  it was great...much thanks for a great recepie.

I love this chicken! Very easy to fix. I used the drained liquid from the pineapple in place of the water just for a little more added flavor. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing a great recipe. I can't wait to use it again.

Good and Easy.  Didn't cook for 45 minutes as would have been too dry.  Would pound my chx. breasts a little before dredging next time.  Didn't have pinapple rings but good just the same.

This recipe was great, especially since I had all the sauce ingredients in my cupboard.  It did take me longer than the 15 minutes prep time, but it was worth it.  I halved the recipe and salt and pepper (deleting salt entirely from the sauce), used olive oil instead of veggie oil, added half the pineapple juice to sauce with same amount of water and put pinapple rings on top of chicken/sauce to also bake.  I didn't have foil for top, so left it off.  It ended up cooking longer than the time, by mistake, but it still turned out great!  Next time, I'll make rice to put it over.

I give this 5-stars based on the ratings of my 12yr old son & his friends.  They loved it!  I, too, omitted the oregano & also used chicken breast tenders.  I was suspect of the breading, based on reviews but it was perfect (thin and crispy).  The boys ate it all up & gave it 10 plus rating.  Very easy and tasty.  We adults enjoyed it, too.

Wonderful... wonderful. Next time, I think I'll follow the advice of some of the other reviewers and omit the oregano from the breading. Makes a lot of chicken - you might want to scale it back a bit. I reserved the sauce and served it in a gravy boat to go with rice.

This turned out very good.  I cooked it for 40 minutes because an hour seemed too long, and it turned out perfect.  I was scared that the sauce would be too sweet, but it was yummy!

This was a quick, easy recipe.  I did not bread and fry the chicken first and I added some chunk pineapple to cook with the chicken.  MMMMM...everyone loved it!

We really enjoyed this dish.  First one tried from Allrecipes.com.  Used the 2 teaspoons pepper but no salt, added sliced green pepper to sauce and forgot pineapple.  It was a sweet sauce but not too sweet, too much of a kick to it for the little ones like it.  Hubby specifically asked for this to be made again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really delicious!  I am always looking for new ways to make chicken, since that is both mine and my husband's favorite.  I didn't bread the chicken although I will try it next time.  I also cut down on the sugar and added red pepper flakes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good!  Not soggy at all, just have to make sure to brown on both sides well, and do a light coating.  Added salsa to the sauce and it was superb.  Serve over rice.

This is like a sweet barbeque sauce.  It was easy to make and different from your everyday chicken marinade or sauce.

This was a great recipe! I made extra sauce for the rice. I served the meal with steamed green beans. Excellent!  My fiance suggested that I add crushed red pepper for a little zip....I think that would be good as well, if you like spice.
Thanks for the great recipe!

Our family loved this recipe!  

We made it with chicken legs and thighs, rather than using boneless breasts.  Just made the sauce ahead of time and then used it like bbq sauce for the cooking chicken.

Basted periodically until the meat was done - excellent and easy!

This recipe turned out fantastic. I used Tony Chachere's for salt and Zatarain's Creole Mustard for the prepared mustard.  For some reason, the sauce around the chicken burnt.  I do not know what could prevent the sauce from drying out while the chicken cooks, but it didn't ruin the chicken.  Maybe someone that knows the answer could help b/c I definitely would do it again.

This was a bit sweet for me,  and needed something yet... not sure what.  It smelled awful cooking,  luckily it tasted better than it smelled. My husband liked it,  but I think I'll pass on making this again. It might make a nice sauce for Li'l Smokies though.

Very simple to prepare.  Well received by hubby and 6 year old son.  Did not bread to avoid "soggyness" complaints.  Used breast tenderloins and cooked for less than 1 hour - removed cover towards the end of baking.  Added small can of pineapple rings with own juice (with sauce, prior to baking) to remedy the "too sweet" complaint.  Turned out great.  Served w/ rice and veggies.

Love this chicken!!!  Really yummy and easy to make.  It is great the way the recipe is written but would be better if you cubed the chicken from the beginning before battering.  My family loved it!

this was amazing! 

I did some alterations because I was missing some ingredients. I substituted ketchup for "tomato base" and green onions instead of a red onion.

but this was amazing!!! we are doing this again.

Modified the recipe by cutting it in half, for me, my better half, and my 8 year old. We had everything on hand except the pineapple and the Oregano .We skipped the frying, used just a little bread crumbs, used cajun spice instead of Oregano, and cooked for 30 mins. We substituted an apple (cubed) and added it to the oven in the last 10 minutes of cooking. The results are hands down awesome.

I liked the taste, I altered the recipe after reading some reviews. I seasoned the meat with sea salt, pepper and garlic powder. I breaded the meat with nature's 100% whole wheat bread. I followed recipe for seasoning flour. I skipped frying, used an egg and coated meat,baking for 25m. After baking I poured sauce which I changed by using pineapple juice instead of water, over chicken used aluminum foil to continue baking for 20m. My chicken wasn't soggy yet still moist. Giving it a 4 because without the changes I do believe it would have been bland sweet chicken, you definitely need to season your meat first. Hope this helps.

I cut down on the amount of pineapple because it seemed to be a lot. I also took other viewers advice and didn't bread the chicken at all. I cooked it all in two separate skillets (didn't want to turn the oven on in the summer heat!) and served it over rice. It was excellent as always (made many times before) and a great way to get that Chinese food flavor without going out.

Wow ... this was great! I made it as written, but didn't have pineapple to top it off with. (It was great anyway!) The sauce is yummy over rice! One note: It did not take an hour to bake, as others have mentioned. I'm glad I checked it after 25 minutes. I baked it uncovered for 25 minutes, and it was perfect. I also browned the chicken well beforehand so it was nice and crispy, and held up well in the sauce.

Made it stir fry style.  No breading.   Fried cubed chicken in oil the. Simmered in sauce.   Served with buttered steamed broccoli.   The a miracle happened.   Butter from broccoli mixed with sauce ...   Oh my goodness this made it really delicious.   Next time I will mix a table spoon or two into the sauce to see what happens.

Just made this and took out of the oven. OMG...so awesome! I read quite a few of the reviews, but made as stated with very few minor changes. 

I omitted the oregano and pineapple, due to not having either of those items and tripled the onions (love onions). I live alone so only used (2) boneless chicken breast halves. I cut each in half lengthwise. I had no problem at all with the coating staying on the chicken as others had mentioned. Made enough sauce for (3) servings. Baked for 15 minutes covered. I then turned chicken over, basted with sauce and then baked an additional 15 minutes uncovered. Absolutely delicious! This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will be making my chicken more often this way. I did use seasoned breadcrumbs, but next time I'm going to also season the chicken before dredging in breadcrumb mixture for extra flavor.

This was devoured and my 6 year old requested I cook it every night! I only added about 1/2 a cup loosely packed brown sugar, used 1/4 cup pineapple juice and 1/4 cup water, cut the chicken into smaller pieces and only had Italian panko bread crumbs. I omitted the oregano because of the seasoned bread crumbs. I did brown the chicken pieces then cooked uncovered for about 25 minutes. Delicious!

I thought this was really good. I made just a few small changes....I didn't use bread crumbs, just floured the chicken lightly. I also omitted the oregano and left the chicken uncovered in the oven.

This was a big hit. Reading reviews I chose not to fry briefly. Save time save clean up. I used a mix of regular bread crumbs and panko. I cut breasts into strips as one person said in her review. Strips made serving a lot easier, as some wanted a lot, others wanted smaller portions. Strips also made more servings. For the sauce (oh so good) I used about 1/3 c. honey with ½ a tablespoon of brown sugar (I had a small amount of honey I wanted to use up).  Next time I will make a lot more sauce, and use more onions. The sauce was so good – plates were totally cleaned. I will add some extra sauce and mix into the rice next time. I don’t think you can overdo serving this sauce!

Skipped the breading, just floured the breasts and browned for a minute in a little bit of butter (tastes so much better than oil). Also, baked at 400 for about 35 minutes.  Turned out great.  Will use again.

My boyfriend can't have wheat so I skipped the breadcrumbs and just dredged in gluten-free all purpose flour. It was amazing! It's our new favorite chicken dish. Yum! :)

Wow this recipe is a keeper. My 1 and a half year old son even loved it, and it was perfect for him because your chicken comes out so tender. I followed some of the other viewers suggestions, and I added some pineapple juice to the sauce. I also added the pineapple to the sauce 10 minutes before it was done in chunks to make it easier for my small guy to eat it. I still give it 5 stars because that wasn't much of a change and this recipe is great! Thanks Judi, we will be making this often!

I  made this chicken for the first time last night and it was wonderful.  I did kick up the sauce with a couple of shakes of tabasco just to offset the sweetness.  In the last 15 minutes I added mushroom and pineapple(I like the flavor of slightlycooked pineapple).  I put it on a bed of chicken flavored rice with mushrooms. It was a hit and I will make this again.

Cut the recipe down to 4 servings and paired it with Sweet & Spicy Green Beans as they had similar ingredients.  Instead of pinapple (I was out), I used a pear.  Easy to make and delicious.

Absolutely delicious!!!!! I thickened the sauce on the stove before adding it to the chicken. Also I baked it uncovered and didn't add the pineapples because we didn't have any. So amazingly good. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is great! Although we didn't have any breadcrumbs or pineapple, we followed the rest of the recipe (scaled down for 2) to a T and these came out so moist and delicious! This sauce is just amazing! I will definitely be making this again!

Just prepared this for dinner and it was really tasty! Hubby said better than his mom used to make...that's saying something:)
I happened to have some frozen pineapple chunks and so I tossed them on during the last half of the cooking. I cut the recipe back to 2 servings and was fine...will never be feeding 10. The only thing I did differently was to mix a little cornstarch and water, removed the chicken breasts and stirred this into the sauce while heating a few minutes to thicken it up. Delicious!

Very, very good and easy to make. We did it just like the recipe said other than placing the pineapple in only for the last 10 minutes of cook time and cooking it for only 30 minutes. Pineapple juice replaced the water.
The sauce is great, ckicken was nice and moist, and the pepper provided a nice zip.

We loved this (parents and kids alike), and made it gluten-free with no problems. We did make some alterations other than the gluten-free substitutions.

1) Used pineapple juice in place of the water.
2) Added some red pepper flakes and other spices to the sauce for a little "kick".
3) Added more of the soy sauce (to taste), but this could be due to the difference between regular soy sauce and the gluten-free variety.

I'm not one for precise measuring or following a recipe exactly, but this was a GREAT foundation for a new family classic! 

On a final note, we didn't have any problems like some other reviewers with the consistency of the breading. Our bread crumbs and flour mixture held up really well.

A family hit! Only made a couple of changes. Read one review about leaving out the oregano and decided to as well (seemed kind of weird with such a sweet sauce). Used spicy brown mustard for an extra kick. Finally, left out the Worcestershire sauce because of food allergies. Served over a mixture of brown/jasmine rice. The sweet sauce along with Hawaiian sweet bread on the side and wallah! I was like the mother of the year to my kids.

I prepared this recipe for 250 Shriner men and their wives. It was a big hit!!! I took one liberty and added dried cranberries for color. I am amazed how tender and juicy the chicken remained. I will be sure to share this dish again.

Made this recipe for two. Enjoyed this thoroughly.  Sauce is delicious but I agree with other reviewers that you will want to have more of it.  I want to find a way to keep the crispness of the breading, so will try the recommendations to broil at the end and leave the tinfoil off.  I pan fried the chicken in chili oil which really added a kick that complimented the sweetness of the sauce.    I will make this again.

I'm giving this only 2 stars because it just wasn't very good.  I was really excited to try it based on everyone else's reviews.  Boy, was I dissapointed.=(  The chicken is okay if eaten alone, the sauce is not good paired with rice as was suggested by some.  Sorry others, wasn't for my family.

The chicken stayed moist and tender- dilish!! Fast easy way to do frozen chicken breasts. I did thaw them in the microwave partially. The only change I made with the sauce was to use only 1 TBSP of brown sugar and the sauce was sweet enough. I also skipped the pinneaple slices. Another tip: on a hot August day this dish was a breeze to do on the grill in a cast iron pan on indirect heat.

I am quite sure I reviewed this about 8-10 years ago, but cannot find it to revise. SO- -I will write a new one. I have been making this for some time and from the beginning decided that pan frying it before baking was an unnecessary step. Recently, I decided breading the chicken and baking was as well. What it has evolved to in my house is more of an american chinese dish. I cut the chicken breasts into chunks, dredge in seasoned flour and pan fry till brown. I remove the chicken from the pan and mix in the ingredients for the sauce, reducing the sugar, mustard, and ketchup quantities, replacing water with pineapple juice, and adding an overflowing teaspoon of Tiger sauce and pinch of Five Spice powder. When that is blended and boiling, I add just under a bag of broccoli stirfry veggie mix, heat through and return chicken to pan. When chicken is cooked through, I serve over brown rice. Works for us!

I cheated and coated raw chicken breasts with shake n' bake and then poured the sauce overtop. This came out so tender and yummy! Served with rice and steamed broccoli. Delish

This was absolutely delicious. My husband, my 4 year old and myself enjoyed every bite. I sever it over rice and poured some extra sauce over it. It was fantastic.

I thought this recipe was great as is, the breading definitely help keep the sauce on the chicken.  They wanted more.  Definitely a do again recipe.

Never have a made something that made me say WOW over and over again.  I was so skeptical about cooking a recipe with ketchup and mustard, but the end result makes your taste buds yearn for more despite how full you are.  This actually works with chicken legs and chicken thighs just as well.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was so refreshing and reminded me of being in the carribean islands. I also skipped the frying part felt it would be more tender and healthier. I will definitely use this recipe again soon and maybe with pork.

Very good.  Made exactly as written except I left the onion out of the sauce (didn't have any) and I added the pineapple after 30 minutes of cooking.  Will make again!

This is probably the first time I have ever made chicken breasts and had them come out so good and JUICY. I can't believe how yummy they are. My sauce was very juicy and didn't really thicken but it could be thickened up after removing the chicken. I made flavored rice to go with it so it didn't really matter to me. The flavor was excellent. The only think I did different is I used half a can of crushed pinapple in place of the water and I didn't add the rings after it was finished.

My husband who is not a fan of boneless skinless chicken breasts bit into this and said "This is a keeper."  It was so yummy that I can't wait to make it again. The only thing I changed is that I did not add the onion because I was out but I will definitely try it next time! Thank you Judi Ann!

The kids loved this recipe but I on the other hand thought it was just ok. Instead of adding the 3/4 cup of water to the sauce I used the juice from the can of pineapple and I baked the pineapples in with the chicken. One thing I would definelty change next time is to not use the bread crumbs or the oregano that just give it an off flavor and the bread crumbs were soggy after cooking in that sauce.

This is good. My kids didn't care for it this time. I made a couple of minor changes. 1. I pounded out my chicken. 2. I used pineapple juice instead of water (same amount). 3. I completely skipped the frying in the pan step. 4.I only bake for 35 minutes an hour would be too long. Only make enough for dinner that night - I found that reheating leftovers dries the chicken out too much.

Wow this was good!!  Only thing I did different was to use "italian" panko crumbs (must be kinda new because first time I ever saw them was my last trip to store) and they were awesome.  The brand was Progresso.  I didn't add the oregano because the seasoning was already in the panko crumbs but I did add some salt & fresh ground pepper. I used boneless skinless thighs and breasts and only cooked for about 45 min.  I worried they might be soggy cooking covered the whole time but not at all - very moist and had a nice crust.  My only concern is the 1 hour cooking time might be just a bit long.  Will definitely make this again and again.  The sauce is wonderful and I think children would love this dish.

Best recipe EVER! Even my can-not-please boyfriend thought it was really good!  My advice however is follow twkitchens advice all the way... and I did not fry it on the pan first, just stuck it straight in the oven!

We loved this!!! The chicken turned out really tender and tasty.  I did follow the idea of just coating the chicken in bread crumbs and then throwing it in the pan instead of frying it first.  It was perfect.  I also didn't have pineapple, so I mixed some mango chutney in with the water for a sweet yummy taste.  We love spice, so I did add cayenne pepper to the bread crumbs and the sauce - it was delicious!! I sliced up baby potatoes and cooked it all together (but the potatoes need to be started earlier or they stay crunchy!). My husband immediately said, "make this the next time we have guests over!'

A bit on the sweet side, but very tasty. I will be keeping this recipe for sure. I followed the recipe to a T, but would like to try it out the way another user suggested and just coat the breasts with bread mixture and just transfer them into a greased baking dish rather than frying them in oil first. It could save time, and another dish to wash...will let you all know.

Loved it!  Next time I will add some red pepper flakes and some spice to make it more like General Tsao's Chicken.  I think it would be better like that.  Definitely a keeper.

This was soooooo good. I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 6 chicken breasts. I think next time I might hold some of the juice back and at the end add pineapple rings and drizzle some of the juice over them and let them cook with the chicken a little. awsome recipe!

I was looking for a recipe that used ingredients I already had at home so I didn't have to go to the grocery store.  I found this recipe and followed it pretty exact, only left out the pineapple and I cut my chicken breasts in thirds because they were pretty big.  I was very pleased with the results.  The whole family loved it, even my 6 year old and 1 year old.  I will definitely make this again.

The sauce tasted good, but you have to keep dipping the chicken in it if you want that flavor everytime.  Chicken turned out pretty bland without the sauce for flavor.

Unless I did something wrong, this was probably the worst chicken I've ever cooked.  I took others' suggestions and didn't bread the chicken first, but that didn't change the fact that the sauce was WAAAAY too watery and too sweet. I definitely won't be making this one again =(

This recipe is fantastic! I concur with the other posters who advise to cut the sugar in half. Still a nice sweet taste without it being overpowering! I also did this on pork chops EVERYONE raved!! This is a must try!

My family really liked this, I was not as impressed. The combination of flavors in the sauce were good and it was a simple recipe to put together. I pounded the chicken breast (always do). They cook more evenly and it gives them a more delicate texture.  It also cuts down the cooking time too. One hour in the oven would have been way too long. I had them in for about 30 minutes and they could have come out about 5 minutes sooner. I will make these again.

I breaded the chicken and browned them earlier in the day as well as putting together all the ingredients for the sauce. Then, when it was time to start cooking dinner, I pulled the chicken out of the fridge, boiled the sauce and dumped it over the chicken and threw it in the oven. What a great make-ahead recipe this turned out to be!! It was so good, nothing too overpowering and no leftovers! This will absolutely be put into the rotation.

The whole family liked it!  That's an accomplishment.  I cooked it completely on the stovetop, which was faster and very tastly.

Didn't bread and pan-fry the chicken, cut it up a little smaller. Replaced all of the water with pineapple juice. Cut up some carrots and green peppers, microwaved them for 3 minutes, then added those to the pan with the chicken.  Added pineapple tidbits 10 minutes before the chicken was done.  Served over rice.  Delicious!

Another great recipe to add to my collection, I followed everything pretty much I did add pineapple juice to the sauce though. The one thing I didnt agree with was the cooking time, if the chicken is thawed and cut into halves 1 hour would have been WAY to much. I was usign completley thawed chicken and sliced the breasts lengthwise 20 minutes was plenty of time. This was a big hit at my house I served it with roasted asparagus and rice pilaf. YUMMMMMMMMY

I'll start by saying that the chicken itself came out moist and juicy, really perfect.  However, the sauce... I did what other reviewers recommended - cut the sugar by half and added half water/half pineapple juice.  All in all, I thought the sauce was rather bland, my husband thought it was too sweet, and it was a messy, time-consuming meal.  Probably won't make again, sorry.

Made this chicken tonight for dinner, we enjoyed it alot, but I think I would add a teaspoon of vinegar to the sauce to take away some of the sweetness.  I think I will also skip the breading next time.  The chicken was sooo tender, we didn't even need a knife.  Great over white rice and a green salad.

this recipe is excellent!  i took the advice of many reviewers and wound up doing this:  cutting the chicken into pieces, 5 breasts.  fried it in skillet for 6 minutes, poured it in baking pan.  use 3/4 cup crumbs, its all you need.  reduced oregano to 1tsp.  added 1tsp chili flakes and 1tsp garlic powder which i wouldnt leave out next time for sure.  made sauce using 1/8 cup mustard, 1 cup brown sugar, 2 cloves garlic and 1 tsp minced ginger and onion powder instead of actual onion.  next time will double sauce ingredients to have more for rice or egg noodles.  instead of pineapple i used yellow pepper slices...and wound up with spicy amazing chicken with thick sauce that sticks to it.  baked 30 minutes covered, 15 uncovered.  me and hubby loved this recipe, left amazing flavor on the tongue.  truly delicious high quality dish that is super easy, especially if you put bread crumb mix in big ziploc with chicken and shake to coat.  no mess!  great stuff, thanks.

This is a good dish, but a tad too sweet (as sweet as candy... not ironic, given the title!).  I really liked the sauce, though, even though it was sweet :)  I think the sauce would be excellent basted on wings, maybe even with some red pepper flakes added for spiciness.  I could do without the pineapple - I guess it's a matter of preference. This is deserving of 4 stars b/c of the versatility of the sauce as a base for another recipe of mine.  Serve with a baked potato and green vegetable (i.e. green beans, asparagus or broccoli) or a tossed salad for a very filling meal. Probably would be a big hit with kids. Thanks for sharing!

Follow recipe to a T, with the exception of pinapple.  Excellent.  Actually, I prepped the recipe on the stove-top then placed in oven on delayed cook.  It was  in the oven more than 1 1/4 hour and it turned out great.  Moist, tender, and tasted great.  I think I will experiment but will follow the basic stove-top preparation.  Thought cranberry or peach sauce would also be good.

My friend thought that it was a 5 star. It was good, nice and tender. Nothing wrong, but I just would have preferred a more "aggressive" taste. Maybe adding more sugar will put it over the edge for me.

This was easy and the chicken was extremely tender.  My entire family liked it (ALL 3 boys, 2, 4 & 6!) which is quite a feat.  I followed the recipe exactly...next time I may add a bit of ginger, minced garlic and some pineapple juice to make it a bit more sweet-and-sour tasting.  I will definitely be adding this to my meal rotation...it's a good chicken dish!

This was a tasty recipe, I did what others suggested and reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes, removing the tin foil for the last 15 minutes, even then it was a tiny bit overcooked. Everyone enjoyed it! Will make again.

As always I marinated my chicken in buttermilk all day to get the moistest chicken possible(If none on hand 1 cup milk 1tbs vinegar).  I also only used 5 chicken breasts and didn't cut the sauce in half so that I would have plenty of extra sauce to put over my rice.  I put chicken in dish and on each side put chunks of peppers and onions and cooked for like 30 minutes.  1 hour is way too long and you'll be stuck with pretty dry chicken.  With the extra sauce the red/green peppers and onion cooked  up beautiful.  I also only used 1 cup brown sugar and that was plenty sweet. Delicious-delicious meal served over white rice.

This was delicious- I thought it tasted like the orange chicken from panda express.  Next time I might even had some red pepper and grated orange peel. Though sweet, it had a nice tang, a fun spice to it.  I'm keeping this in my favorites!

This was so much more than I expected. I took other reviewers advice and used pineapple chunks and add them 15 minutes before finished. I also didn't use all the salt and pepper (just to taste) and used lite soy sauce. This will be a dish I make often! Thanks!

This was very good recipe. My family really enjoyed it. The only thing I would change is cutting down on the sugar. But other wise this is one of the best I have tryed from here. I also made extra sauce to pour over the rice.  Thanks for the recipe

I just really did not care for this dish. It reminded me of a baked version of sweet and sour chicken, just not as good.  It did go together easy enough w/ ingredients most kitchens would have. I just really did not like how it tasted.

This had a really unique flavor, almost Asian. I only used half the sauce, so I'll try the other half on pork. I also threw in the pineapple chunks--they soaked up the sauce and were yummy!

This recipe is awsome!  The whole family loved it! I made this recipe when my in-law's were visiting and everybody wished there was more!  I made Asian Coconut Rice to go with the meal, the rice recipe is also on this site.  Enjoy!  We sure did.

Excellent.  My brother described this as something like a good sweet and sour chicken recipe.  Used an egg bath for dredging the chicken breasts.

It was good...and I'm sure it would've been DELICIOUS over rice!  Next time I might try to "tone-down" the sweetness.

Let me put it this way--we all ate dinner at about 6pm--(and we ate well) at 9pm my 10 y/o WISHED he could have more of that awesome chicken! Everyone here gave this 5 stars--I followed the recipe for the most part I only used 6 boneless breasts and wound up cutting the chicken into smaller pieces so the sauce would cover more of it(and so it would bake a bit faster)--I did find that I had a TON of breadcrumbs left over so I would definetely scale that back next time--but otherwise thought it was an easy recipe with great results!

This was very good but I did not think it was the best chicken dish I've ever had.  However, I would probably make it again.

Overall this was good. A tad sweet, so I think next time I will add a bit more water to dilute the sweetness. I didn't feel like grating onion so I used some chopped garlic I had. I also used Dijon mustard instead of standard prepared yellow mustard, perhaps it added a nice  bite/tang to it? Pretty tasty. I served this over rice with homemade crescent rolls. If you want more sauce for your rice I would add more of everything in the sauce recipe so you have more in the end.

This was a great recipe.  Everyone loved it even my pickey hubby.  I only made five chicken breasts with the same amount of sauce and served it with rice.  I also put the pineapple on the chicken 45 min into baking and let it warm up for 15 min. Yum!

Out of the hundreds of recipes I have made from this site, this is in the top five. My kids all asked for thirds and fourths and my husband said it's one of the best things I've made in 14 years! Try this one, you won't be disappointed!

This was much better the next day!  Good the first day, better the second!  I would skimp a bit on the breading next time, I had plenty left over.  I put the chicken back in the oven for a few minutes after adding the pineapple rings to cook those a bit.  We enjoyed and lots of leftovers!

This is soooo tasty!  The changes I made: I omitted the oregano, salt, and onion.  I used pulverized saltines instead of breadcrumbs, and I substituted pineapple juice for the water.  Oh, and I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts - the narrow strips are easier for the kids to eat. Served with plain white rice, this makes a delicious dinner!

This was excellent!  I did make a couple of changes.  I skipped the breading part, to save time, calories, and clean-up.  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I also skipped the salt, and I was out of onions so I used a shallot and it was great.  I thought it was pretty sweet, but my husband and kids loved it.  I will definitely make again!

"WOW,Mom's making Candied Chicken tonight!!!!" So that says it all. My other half boasts to his friends about this dish. (while he's rolling his eyes just thinking about it!)It may be alot of work, but the smiles and empty plates makes it all worth while!!!! I make enough for an army, so I'm glad there is a 'customizing recipe" formula. Also, it has been 'requested' that I make it at least once a month!  I love when I hear "Are you making that because we've been good?" Great recipe in my book.

I scaled this recipe by half, cut each chicken breast in smaller pieces, didn't use any oregano(just don't like it) used Mrs. Dash garlic blend instead, used red pepper instead of black pepper, used honey mustard and pineapple juice instead of water, cooked the pineapple in with the chicken and it was wonderful...my whole family loved it which is very rare since we have picky, picky eaters!  Thanks for this great recipe definitly a keeper.

I've made this recipe 3-4 times, and the chicken always comes out juicy and flavorful.  I substitute pineapple juice for the water and add more soy sauce so that the sauce is not as sweet.  I serve it over rice, and it's delish!!

Yum, Yummy, the Yummiest sweet Chicken I've had in awhile. WOW! What great flavor. I can see where the name comes from becasue when I make "candied" yams it has a syrup like sauce as does this dish. Served with rice. I'd recommend making extra sauce for drizzeling over your rice, Mmmm good! -scaled down to 4 servings-

WOW! This is a wonderful recipe. My husband, who
does not care for chicken all that much, raved about it. He loves sweet dishes. The only changes I made were: Scaled the recipe down to 4 servings. I lined the pan with foil then sprayed with non-stick spray. I used the pineapple juice from the pineapple rings instead of water.  I served this with butter noodles. This recipe is excellent.

This recipe is very good.  The chicken looks beautiful when topped with the pineapple.  The only change I would make: add some of the juice from the pineapple rings to the sauce in order to increase the sweetness.

I have made this twice.  Once with the breading and once without.  We loved it both ways.  If I made it for company I would follow the recipe exactly.  But when calories count (as they do for me) and time is an issue I will continue to make it without the breading and prefrying in oil.  My picky eater loves this too.

Pretty good! My only complaint is that the breading did turn out a little soggy. Strangely, though, it tasted better the next day. Served with rice. The sauce was delicious.

These are great! I have made them twice now.. and they have been a big hit both times...(even my 3 year old ate it all up) I serve them with rice.. just spoon the sauce over both chicken and rice.. mmmn.. yummy! Two things I changed.. I didn't add the oregano and I added Onion powder instead of grated onion (just because my son doesn't like little onion pieces he can see!) Thanks for the great recipe!
I just wanted to add that I have used this sauce over chicken drumsticks and cook for 50-60 minutes until the chicken reaches doneness. (use a meat thermometer if you are unsure) It is great and both my boys (5 and 2) love it! I just put it all in a roasting pan!

I scaled the recipe down to 5 servings and used 4 chicken breasts.  I changed the recipe per others recommendations and was pleased with the outcome.  I omitted the breading, frying, all salt, pepper and pineapple.  I cut the chicken into pieces and used a lot of garlic and onion powder to season the meat.  After cooking, I took out the meat and thickened the sauce with a teaspoon of cornstarch in a little water.  I put the meat back in and served over rice.  This was very tasty.  Thanks!

I followed other suggestions and omitted the breading stage and reduced the sugar to 1 cup.

Even though our guests were late and the chicken cooked an extra 10 minutes, it was a tender as could be and everyone loved it especially the little ones.

Will definitely add this to my favotrites to be made again and again

My family and I loved this recipe. Even the kids ate it. I think I would call it sweet and sour chicken rather than candied chicken breasts. I fixed it exactly like the recipe said and it was wonderful.

Was totally unsure as to what this would turn out like, but it was beautiful! Sort of like sweet and sour chicken but with a bigger better flavour. Would probably use a little less sugar next time though. Mum and dad loved this one too

Great recipe!! I didn't have any bread crumbs at home so I omitted them from the recipe and just dredged the chicken in the flour and spices and it was still excellent!!

This was superb as is - I did not make any adjustments. I did do a light bread coating, though. I did not find it soggy at all. The chicken came out perfectly tender & juicy. I reserved some of the sauce and ladled it over the chicken & pineapple. Well-complimented with mashed potatoes, green beans almondine, and baked cinnamon apples.

This dish was awesome!  Not only was it tasty, it was really, really easy.  I had the whole thing prepped and in the oven in under 15 minutes.  My kids loved it too, even my 5 year old son who isn't a big meat eater.  I served it with fried rice and a green salad.  It's a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe! The sauce is also good for other types of meat. I used this to cook my sausage links. I put the sausages in a pan filled with the sauce and baked it. It was so good!

This recipe tasted like the sesame chicken you would get from Chinese takeout. My sister thought it tasted like swedich meatballs. It would be very good over rice.

This chicken was really tasty, however, mine turned out a little dry.  I wonder if I had enough of the sauce and if 1 hour was too long to bake it?  I will definitely try it again though.

My husband always dreads when I make a chicken dish, but loved this one!!!!!!!   I cubed the chicken pieces and only 1 hour in the oven w/ a lot of sauce made the chicken just melt in your mouth.  Great recipe

This sauce is similar to a sweet and sour sauce you'd get at a Chinese restaurant.  I modified the recipe by cubing the chicken in bite-sized pieces and adding one sliced green pepper, two sliced carrots, and a can of cubed pinapple chunks to the 13 X 9 inch pan before cooking.  I still cooked it for about an hour and all the vegetables were tender.   Oh, I also added the drained pinapple juice to the sauce you make in the pan--this thinned it out a bit and helped stretch the sauce.  It turned out a good consistency and there was plenty of sauce (we like lots of sauce ; ))  This dish was very nice served over rice--like a sweet and sour dish you'd get out!

Very tasty!  I'd like to try cutting up the chicken in bite-sized pieces (don't forget the fancy toothpicks) and bring it to a party.  I bet they would be a huge hit!  Thanks Judi!

My kids actually liked this! I have one child who won't eat anything with a sauce on it, and he admitted this one was good. I served it on a bed of rice, but omitted the pineapple (because of the kids). I didn't want to press my luck.

Very good! I followed the recipe as written, except for a couple of minor changes. I cut the chicken breasts into large chunks, which reduced baking time to 40 minutes.. I used pineapple juice from a can of pineapple chunks instead of the water in the sauce, and added a teaspoon of Chinese 5-spice powder; I also reduced the oregano by half. A few minutes before the chicken was done, I stirred in the can of drained pineapple chunks. Makes a great meal when served over rice with a side of steamed broccoli/thinly sliced carrots.  I would definitely make this again.

Yum! I used 1/2c brown sugar but will use less next time. Will definitely make again. Put fresh pineapple chunks near end of bake time

I cut chicken into large cubes, tossed in the dry ingredients and placed in the greased baking pan. I mixed the wet ingredients, substituting pineapple juice for the water as suggested by others, and added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, and poured over the chicken.  I also used fresh cubed pineapple and tossed that on top of the chicken.  Covered with the foil and baked as directed for 25-30 minutes.  Was so easy, and came out sticky and oh so tasty!!  Thanks for the inspiration!!

This was excellent! I used crushed pineapple and used the juice from that instead of water. Chicken was very tender and juicy. Definitely will be making it again..

Turned out really well!  But it feels like there’s something missing.  Wish it was sweeter or had a bit of a spicy kick to it, though.  I definitely plan to make this again and play around with the sauce and the spices in the breading.  Also: be careful about how long you’re putting the chicken in the oven.  Depending on the number and size of pieces that you have it seems easy to over cook.

The only thing I did different was pineapple chunks with juice instead of pineapple slices.
I had no oregano but used thyme instead.
Turned out so juicy & tender I'M doing this again soon. It was fantastic! Every one loved it.

I made this as written, and it was a HUGE hit in my family. I bought large boneless breasts and cut them down into smaller , thinner  pieces. My 16-year old son, who doesn't like chicken (don't even get me started!) said, "Oh! This is sweet! Mama, you rocked this one!" Folks, we have a winner!

We loved it! I used some of the suggestions, I cut the chicken breasts in strips, breaded them as directed, but didn't pan fry them ahead of time. I used less pineapple juice in the sauce instead of water and I doubled the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Red pepper flakes would give it a little kick, too  I only had pineapple bits, so I added them to the sauce before cooking. I didn't put foil over the strips as they were cooking and the sauce was nice and thick. My 20 year old son said it was the most tender chicken he had ever had and my husband loved it, too! Next time, I will reduce the sugar, it was a bit too sweet for me.

This was good but somewhat sweet. As others suggested, I substituted pineapple juice for water & used pineapple chunks instead of rings. After I made the sauce, I tasted it and thought it was way too sweet. So, I ended up adding another dose of soy sauce & ketchup. After the chicken was cooked, the sauce was yummy, thickened and kind of like a sweet & sour.  I was disappointed in how much bread crumb mixture was wasted & thrown away. Would suggest cutting the bread crumbs, flour & spices in half.

really good.  not to sweet after i made a few adjustments:  use stone ground mustard. no onion. use 1/2 cup brown sugar. don't dredge, just brown with herbs, salt/pepper.  use same pan for sauce that chicken was browned in. use all pineapple juice in can instead of water.  don't cover with foil.  cook for 30 minutes. add pineapples after 15 minutes of cooking.  yummy!

I made this for my husband and myself, adjusting the servings to 3. This recipe turned out well with a couple adjustments. Instead of using breadcrumbs, I substituted with pinko. But I think I’d leave some moisture on the breasts so more of the coating sticks. I added some turmeric to the seasoning and since I didn’t have any pineapple handy, I used sliced peaches.

I definitely did not strictly follow this recipe, I took the advice of some other reviewers and added extra pineapple and pineapple juice.  It was delicious! Will make again for sure.

Delicious, substituted pineapple juice for the water. I added 2 tablespoons of sweet chili sauce for balance. I chopped up the pineapple rings. Was an amazing dish are used croutons put into a brown paper bag then beat them with a meet tenderizer for the breadcrumbs so that they would be seasoned and this turned out amazing I would not use regular breadcrumbs because they would end up being very soggy

Far  too sweet for my liking.  The texture of the chicken wasn't  terrific either, though I made sure to reduce the cooking time as many recommended.  I won't make it again.

Everyone loved this !  I doubled the sauce recipe as I was feeding seven people and  I also skipped the breading and frying. I cut 6 large breasts in half and made into strips but think cubing them would have been better for kids and large family. The only thing I did different was cut the brown sugar to a cup , no oregano ,  I added a  couple pinches of cayenne and red pepper. I did add a small amount of corn starch to thicken sauce . I found I only needed to cook for a half an hour. Served over white rice. I used fresh cored pineapple chunks.Definitely making again.

Great basic recipe! I altered to to add more taste.
For bread crumbs I used panko. I used oregano, salt, pepper and garlic powder and mixed with the panko. I dredged the chicken in mayo first then dredged in the panko mix. 
In the sauce I did add some garlic powder and used dried minced onions instead of the shredded onions. 
uncovered the dish the last 10 min of cooking. 
After it was done I mixed a bit of cornstarch and water in a dish then poured it into the sauce to thicken.
My family and my kids friends just LOVED it.

I loved this recipe.  I took a little longer to get everything ready to go in the oven, but the wait was worth it.  I would definitely make this again.  I served it over a bed of rice with a side of steamed broccoli.

Excellent recipe - here are my changes:
- I used a big pot (Creuset Kettle) instead of two and layered everything.
- I added sauteed onions and peppers.
- I used red wine instead of water - but it could have used both.
- I added the pineapple directly to the sauce - YUM!
Keeper!!

I made it exactly as the recipe says and it was delicious. I used the "adjust portion" option to adjust to 4 people and it was still perfect. If you don't like sweet food you probably won't like this as it was pretty sweet. I did find the sauce a bit watery, but that could have been run off from the chicken mixing with the sauce. I stirred in some mashed potatoes we were having with it and it thickened it up nicely.

Really good. Dip the chicken in egg before breaking, I used Italian bread crumbs for more flavor, butterflied and pounded the chicken first, tented the chicken with foil for 20 minutes, turned the heat up to 425 for the last 15 uncovered with pineapple chunks on top during and broiled it for 5 minutes. Served over rice

Absolutely amazing!  So good that I can't believe it came out of my kitchen.   I didn't change a thing and won't change anything when I make this again.

Such a yummy dish! I only put half of the brown sugar it asks for and I skip the frying pan part. I dip the chicken in egg then bread crumbs then repeat the process one more time. It tastes so much better when you don't put as much brown sugar.

I did make some changes here...
I cut up chicken breasts into chunks, seasoned with salt and pepper, and sautéed on medium for about 8 minutes. I turned the heat down to medium low and put a lid on the chicken and cooked another 10 minutes. I dumped a can on pineapple chunks, juice and all in the pan. Eyballed the ketchup, brown sugar, soy and Worcestershire sauce. Definitely did not use as much sugar as recipe stated. Sauce wasn't thickening like I wanted, so I mixed up about 1 tablespoon cornstarch and a little cold  water in a small bowl.  Added it to pan and simmered some more. Perfecto! I never used the oven. Served over  brown rice. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish!  I used all the ingredients except for less salt.  We are not big eaters, so I cut the serving size down to one large chicken breast. However, I followed  other reviewers' suggestions. I cut the chicken into small chunks and rolled them in bread crumb seasoning.  For bread crumbs, I used Italian flavored ones. I did not fry the chicken. I just put the breaded chicken in a greased glass pan, poured the sauce over the chicken, and added some pineapple chunks and a little pineapple juice. I covered the pan with a glass top and baked in a 350 oven for 45 minutes. The chicken came out tender and moist. I even threw in some left over chicken.

I made this with half the ingredient's. I marinated the chicken in the sauce first and put it in the fridge for 4 hours. Then breaded the chicken and made new sauce to pour over top of chicken. I used the pineapple juice in sauce instead of water. Cooked 4 chicken breast for 40 min. This came out pretty good. Put over rice. Thanks

It was a wonderful teriyaki chicken. Everyone loved it, even mom, who is a picky eater.  The only change I would make is to decrease the amount of bread crumbs.  I used less then half what was called for and had to throw the rest away because it had touched the raw chicken.  That was a waste.

Delicious!!!  I cut up the chicken into slices and followed the recipe.  I was very skeptical that this sauce would taste good but I was SO wrong!  I didn't have any brown sugar so had to use white sugar but it still turned out good.   I also did not have pineapple but it tasted great without it.  Oh, and I also added chili sauce to give the sauce some bite.  YUM!

I followed some other review suggestions and skipped the breading and frying. I crushed fresh pineapple to add to the sauce, also garlic and red pepper flakes. With these additions the 1.5 cups B. sugar was not too sweet and quite tasty. I poured the sauce over partially thawed chicken breasts that I seasoned with salt, pepper and onion powder. Added sliced green pepper and zucchini. Baked covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15. It was great.

I only used 1 1/4 cup brown sugar, pineapple juice without pineapples with 1/4 cup water in sauce, otherwise  followed recipe for sauce but I just cut my chicken breast into chunks and after boiling  sauce  and letting it thicken slightly, added chunked chicken and cooked on stove top. I chose not to bread and fry the chicken based on other reviews. Served over rice and although I thought it was a tad too sweet ( despite cutting down the sugar) my husband and friend loved it.

Was extra work because of breading and cooking chicken first. (It reminded me of chicken parm) However the sauce was good. I included diced peppers with the pineapple. Next time to make it easier, I would either continue cooking in pan or skip the first browning step and just bake in the oven. If there's a shortcut, I prefer it!

Just before serving I sprayed a skillet with non stick spray and then added sliced sweet onion and yellow and red bell pepper.   After they softened just a bit I added it the pineapple and the hot liquid surrounding the chicken breast.  Loved it.

Made this recipe using chicken breast (kept thick) and cooked for the first 30 minutes covered, then uncovered, added pineapple rings and cooked for additional 15 minutes. Made this with side of rice. It was delicious. I hesitated at first but am glad I decided to give it a try. My husband raved and thanked me for the beautiful dinner. I'd say this is a keeper!

I have made this several times and we love it. So easy to make and everyone loves the fruit with the chicken. I'm always looking for ways to dress up my chicken breast and this is perfect.

I LOVE this recipe. It has become one of my regular meals. But you have to season the chicken breasts very well considering they are thick pieces. I also let it marinate for about half hour in the refrigerator  in apple cider vinegar. Delllishhh !

Wow. We all loved the Candied Chicken Breasts over rice with lots of fresh pineapple. Glad it made a few cups of juice since I added more chicken to assure leftovers. Didn't cook more than 45 min. though since already fried (used Coconut oil) it seemed to be boiling in juice. Very tasty!

UPDATE: This is still a winner! Tonight subbed all pineapple juice for water and we still use the Trader Joe's vinegar every time . I double recipe and let the extra sauce simmer during bake time with chopped up red bell pepper in it. One of my husband's favorites. Original review: Made last night. Delicious! I used thick breasts and it did take almost the full hour. They were perfectly juicy and delicious! We LOVED the sauce.  We don't look soy sauce, so we substituted with Trader Joe's balsamic vinegar, and I added crushed red pepper.  At the suggestion of another reviewer, substituted water with about 1/2 cup of pineapple juice.  Will definitely make this again!

A little sweet...you have to be careful what you pair it with. We tried couscous and I think rice would have been a better balance.

This was incredible!
Per previous review I skipped the breadcrumb mixture and just floured the chicken breasts, then browned them.  I also lowered the brown sugar slightly and thought it was still sweet enough. I would make this for company - it can have really nice presentation if you choose to do so! Thanks Judi Ann!!

I am doing something I normally don't like with other reviewers: I made this very different than the recipe called for. But it was delicious and I think much easier than what is called for here, so I thought I'd share. I made this as a one pot meal, mixing the sauce together in my cast iron pot, them adding cut-up pieces of raw chicken. I cooked for 30 minutes (which seemed a bit too long -- the chicken was a bit dry) and added pineapple pieces for the last 10 minutes. I mixed prepared rice straight into the cast iron pot, making this an easy, quick weeknight meal for my family. Something I will definitely make again!

I chose this recipe at the last minute because I had all the ingredients in the cupboard, except the pineapple. I decided to substitute the bread crumbs with Peperidge Farm Herbed stuffing and wonderded if I did the right thing when I added the oregano. (And after reading one of the reviews.) I browned the chicken ahead of time and simply poured the prepared sauce over it, covered the pan and baked it for about 30 minutes. My husband and I loved the flavor and both agreed the oregano gave it an interesting flavor!  This is a wonderful and easy way to cook chicken. Thank you Judi.

It's a keeper for sure!  First time I made it and we all loved it. 99% of the time, I use cracker crumbs vs. bread crumbs, in all my recipes - this has always been my preference.  The cracker crumbs were excellent with it! Yummy!  I had to omit the Worchestershire sauce because I didn't know I was out - this one time. Not one piece left over!  The other thing nice about this recipe is I usually have all the ingredients in my kitchen.

I'd give this 3 and a half stars, It wasn't bad, I wouldn't exactly say I "liked it" it was ok.  Maybe if I were more of a fan of pineapples-- guess it depends on your taste..don't not make it because of me, try it for yourself.

I followed the recipe exactly and neither my husband nor I liked this dish. Fortunately, I used a Silpat to line my baking sheets and the sweet syrup melded and burned on the Silpat. After it was cooled, I was actually able to peel the burned puddles off the Silpat. I could actually crack it between my 2 hands.

The sauce that did remain was cloyingly sweet and did not marry well with the other ingredients. The breading was soggy and the texture was not good at all. The only thing that saved a star (Hence, 2 stars instead of 1) was the quality of my chicken breasts which were grass fed and organic. What a complete waste of ingredients!!! This was my second failed attempt on this site. I blame the recipe and perhaps our palates and not my cooking skills.

Thank you ever so much for this recipe!  This dish was a hit last night!  My two teen-age sons and Husband devoured it!  Just one problem,....there wasn't enough sauce!!!  Wow, I will make this sauce for everything from now on.  I did everything except added oregano.  I didn't have any.

Would put in less brown sugar next time - a little too sweet when you use the pineapple juice instead of water...think I will try and add ground ginger next time too.

Very good, unique recipe. A little too sweet for me tho, next time I will use less sugar. I made a vegetarian version for myself  using soy chicken and a real chicken one for my boyfriend and both turned out well. I baked the meat one for 30 minutes and the veggie one for 15 minutes and both turned out perfect with crunchy breading, I think an hour would be much too long.

Not bad for a change. Make sure you re calculate The baking time. Frying, if done, should be at medium heat not medium high. Needs more seasoning or the meat will be a but bland.

did not bread the chicken and I accidentally omitted the mustard. It was delicious but the sauce was thinner than I wanted. next time I will reduce the water. will definitely make this again as the sauce was so good.

Made this for my family of six ranging from 3-40,  they ALL loved it!  It is going in our "everyone likes" file.  I recommend pineapple on the side for finicky appetites.  Served with white rice, and sides of broc., & cranberry sauce.  White wine was a nice touch to round out the relaxing Sunday evening meal.

I really liked this recipe. Like others, I substituted most of the water for pineapple juice. I made 5 servings (used only one baking dish) and put it in the oven for 15 minutes. I then dumped in my full can of pineapple chunks, covered it, and put it in for another 7 minutes. Then, I put it back in, uncovered, for another 5 minutes. You could probably just keep it covered the whole time, but I think uncovering it got the pineapples cooked a little more, which I enjoyed. I think it would have been even better if they'd been grilled beforehand.   I think one of the bigger things I'd change next time is that I'd dip the chicken in egg or egg wash before dredging it in the bread crumb concoction. It friend up fine, but after I took it out of the oven, the seasonings basically just fell off because it had nothing to stick to.   Still, I totally disagree that the pan frying step should be skipped. It helped season the chicken really well.   I'll definitely make this again!

I tried twkitchen's idea, skipped the frying, and placed the raw breaded chicken in the baking dish with the yummy sauce, baked for an hour, and served over rice. Everybody liked it, and it was easy to prepare with minimum time in the kitchen. Think this would be good with pork or ham, as well.

This was delicious and easy!  I added red pepper flakes because my family likes a little "kick" to their food.  Everyone in my family loved it!!

Tender and sweet. This was the best chicken recipe ever. I will be making this often. I pureed a small can of pineapple  as I had nothing else on hand and didn't want to go with just water. hmm hmm good! ? The name is very catchy and suits the dish

This was a wonderful dinner!!! I made some few changes though, i used shake n bake and fried the chicken till brown and crispy in 2 cups of oil. I also used pineapple juice instead of water. The only thing that was disappointing with this recipe, was that there was not enough sauce, i will definetly have to alter it a bit more

My first ever review after many years of using AllRecipes.com--and it had to be for this AMAZINGLY TASTY CHICKEN dish.  And, it won't be with any creative ideas.  I did it with an earlier reviewer variation (the no frying idea).  I just wanted to say I LOVE IT.  I will try it again for dinner party. Y'all were right!

To good to be true! This recipe couldn't be easier.I didn't bread the chicken, just put the breasts in the pan and poured on the sauce. I also added stir fry vegetables over the chicken, covered with foil for the 1st half hour, then uncovered added the pineapple and cooked for the other half hour. We loved this and the family already wants it again.

Awesome recipe, I added some chili sauce to make it a little spicy. Instead of frying I baked it after breading(in convection oven).  After it got a little crispy I poured the sauce on it.  It turned out great.  My family liked it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was excellent. I only changed one thing and that was I left out the oregano because I don't like it all. I was worried it might come out too sweet but it didn't. I will definitly make this again.

Great recipe!  I did as many of the other reviewers and skipped the frying and cooked it uncovered for about 30 minutes.  The chicken was super tender and the sauce was delicious!  We all loved it!

Delicious! I followed a couple of the changes suggested by other reviewers and the chicken came out perfect. I did not pan fry the chicken after breading it, I cut up the chicken into small pieces, I left the chicken uncovered in the oven, and I only cooked it for 25 minutes. This produced perfect, tender, juicy chicken and the sauce was excellent. For a healthier option, I served this with broccoli and it was excellent with the sauce.

Absolutely delicious prepared as per the recipe except used the juice from the can of pineapple.  Not an everyday thing because it's quite sweet, but definately went into the "make again" binder.  Also, I lined the pan with non-stick foil so clean-up was a breeze.

This got a "WOW, this is REALLY GOOD, you should make it again!!" from the entire family (which doesn't happen very often--kids!).  I didn't want to add extra calories by breading and frying chicken, so I skipped that step all together.  I replaced the water with pineapple juice as others have suggested and used Splenda brown sugar.  I reduced the amt of brown sugar since I used the juice.  I removed foil and added pineapple about 15 min before chicken was done.  Once chicken was done, I took the very runny sauce and pineapple from pan and thickened it on stove top with corn starch and served sauce on top of chicken.

Even though I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 of a cup, this was way too sweet.  The breadcrumb coating got soggy too.  Luckily my husband has a sweet tooth and will eat anything, so it didn't go to waste.  I don't think I'll be making this again.  Sorry.

Yum! This chicken was delicious and everyone LOVED it! Will definitely make again.    I made extra sauce, and put some over the top of the Wild Rice side.  This goes great with that rice as well as peas.   We put those little miniature umbrellas in the finished product and it looked great.

Made this recipe last night exactly as written and it was delish!  I had several guests in the home who were here to pick up kids and they all wanted to know what I was cooking because it smelled so delicious.  Would highly recommend.  I served this over risotto and with a side salad!

Family loooooooved this recipe. Will make again with suggestions from other reviewers. Pineapple juice instead of water, flatten chicken breast. I thought it had too much mustard so I added more ketchup to sweeten it up a little. Other than that it was great. Will be making this again. Thanks for such a delicious recipe.

I made these tonight and they were delicious! I didn't have all ingredients on hand (oregano, Worcestershire sauce, or mustard), but the sauce still tasted great and made for a really good dish over all. The only thing I did differently was I coated the chicken in egg first so that it would hold the bread crumbs better, and omitted the oil and pineapples on top. If you want to make this dish healthier, omit using the oil to cook the chicken (in the skillet) before baking. A fat free oil based cooking spray works very well and gets the job done. The pineapples are unnecessary. Will definitely be making these time and time again.

My family loved this, and is a great alternative to vinegary sweet & sour chicken. The only suggestion I would make is to flatten the chicken breast before cooking by lightly punding or rolling with a rolling pin, otherwise, wonderful recipe!

This recipe was great for using up leftover cooked chicken, although the sauce was a little sweet for my taste. For those who like orange chicken or sweet bbq sauce I would say this is perfect, but next time I will probably halve the sugar.

This was deeeeelicious!  I only used 2 chicken breasts for my husband and I, and halved the recipe for the sauce to ensure enough sauce for the rice.  I cut the chicken breasts into chunks, breaded them, and using someone else's suggestion, did not fry it.  Instead I sprayed Pam in an 8x8 dish, threw the chunked/breaded chicken in, and topped it with halved pineapple chunks that I had leftover from some meatballs I made yesterday.  (I did save the pineapple juice to add to the sauce mixture instead of water and that was WONDERFUL!)  After it baked for 1/2 hr, when getting ready to serve it, I topped it with toasted pecans over rice.  My husband and I both loved it!

My husband loved this. He loves anything made with pineapple and that is sweet like this is. It is similar to the taste of General Tso chicken but without the spice. Will be making again.

This was delicious and pretty too, although a bit strong. Following reviewers' advice (and my own common sense) I made the following modifications:
1. I left out the bread crumbs and just dredged the chicken in the flour and spices. 
2. I skipped the frying step. No need to waste time and calories. 
3. In the sauce I cut the sugar down to 1 c. and used dried onion flakes instead of grated. In place of water I used pineapple syrup. 
4. I used pineapple chunks and I added it to the chicken for the last 15 min. of baking. 
5. I used whole chicken piece which I baked covered for an hour and uncovered for 15 minutes. Breasts would need less time. 
The family all liked this.

Yum!  Will definitely make over and over. I halfed the chicken and kept the same amount of sauce.  I also put in some crushed red pepper and a dash of cayenne which gave it a wonderful kick.  Can't say enough about this recipe!

Wow, this was great!  As is the case with anyone who has some cooking experience, I know my oven and was able to adjust the cooking time.  I baked it on convection for 40 minutes, with the temp probe reading 160 degrees.  I also put the pineapple rings on the chicken before baking.  Huge hit in our family and I'll add this to the rotation.  Thanks!

Excellent. Cut chicken into smaller pieces, skipped bread crumbs, broiled instead of fried. On stove top put together sauce and added pineapple chunks with juice right into sauce. Even added extra pineapple juice and then poured all on top of chicken and back in oven. Served with bulgur chickpea salad from this site. Yummy.

Made this last night for hubby and two of his friends with an entire bag of chicken tenderloins (3 lbs, I think) and there were only two pieces leftover! Needless to say they loved it.

Didn't brown the chicken ahead of time, and only used 3/4 c. of brown sugar, but doubled the other recipes b/c we like our sauce. Also added a teaspoon of corn starch (needed more) and a tablespoon or so of Sriracha for some spice. Also subbed pineapple juice for the water and poured the sauce over the chicken and pineapple rings so it could all bake together.

Was great served over brown rice and with green beans. Definitely a keeper, and so easy!

Made this today for a quick, informal family get-together and it was way too sweet for my taste. Fortunately, I had another meat available. This recipe got mixed reviews depending on the age of the reviewer. The kids (teenagers) seemed to love it, with all the sugar. The adults were merely being polite, but I could tell it wasn't a hit by the amount of the dish left over. I give it 3 stars because I will probably make it again when I need something to do with chicken breasts quickly, and the fact that the children will inhale it with all the sweetness.

My husband loved this dish, my son wouldn't eat it, and I thought it was OK. I will probably make it again but I will omit the oregano. 
I only made 3 chicken breasts and I followed the other suggestions and made the larger amount of sauce.
I honestly think that this chicken would be better if it didn't have the breading. It would taste very similar to sweet and sour chicken. I served this over rice. Not bad but not Amazing.

Candied chicken breasts is a good recipe and definitely one of my favorites. I really enjoyed the aroma that this dish creates and all the different flavors combined is very tasty! I gave it 4 stars because I would have liked the sauce to be thicker. I added some cooking sherry wine to mine and it turned out great. I actually bought crushed pineapples which was actually very good! I meant to buy the chunks but the crushed work out very well! I did not fry and I baked the chicken for 45min -1 hour and it turned out very moist. I did not add any mustard. Definitely worth making...very easy to make. But I just wish the sauce was thicker! Perhaps I will add more ketchup and less water next time.

This was just ok.  It didn't blow me away.  I thought I'd be missing something if I didn't try it due to all the rave reviews.  It just seemed like chicken baked in a sweet bbq sauce, nothing fancy.

I first saw this recipe in 2005, and I've been making it ever since.  I've since started to use several variations, but I always go back to the original.  Delicious, simple, and not very time consuming.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.

Simply the best tasting dish on this site. The glaze is amazing, it almost resembles like a sweet honey ham glaze, but much better. In fact using the glaze on a ham might be a good combination!

These were above average, but not five star.  I cooked them in the convection oven and it took more like 30 minutes.

This one blew me away. What I expected to be your usual baked chicken (I am not a big chicken person) was absolute deliciousness. I halved the recipe, used thin chicken breasts, and baked it for 20 minutes. My fiance and I were very impressed with the flavor of this one and will definitely be making this again.

AMAZING!  We had salad with this. I think next time we will have rice also, this sauce would be great over rice!  Fresh pineapple is much better.

I served this for a party of about 15 guests.  I breaded and fried the chicken and made the sauce early in the day so I just had to put it in the oven while guests were here.  I used half the suggested sugar and added some pineapple juice (about a 1/2 cup) with the pineapple chunks rather than the ring.  Everyone loved it!.

Deffinitely 5 stars all the way. I used 4 chicken breasts with the same amount of sauce. The chicken breasts were frozen so I cooked them in a pan for a bit, but did not bread them. I then put pinapple chunks on top of the chicken and let them bake along with the chicken. The whole family enjoyed. Thanks for the great recipe!!

seemed like alot of work for just an average chicken dish...like I don't think the chicken needed to be breaded, it seemed like it would turn out the same just browning them up a bit.

Excellent family or casual company meal.  Used coarse french bread crumbs.  Crumbs didn't stick very well, but were delicious from the pan into the sauce.  Cooked about 40 minutes with thick Sam's Club half breasts.

I love this recipe and get requests from the hubby to make it more often.  We have started a low fat diet and this doesn't feel low-fat at all.  I didn't change the recipe but here is how I serve it....  Cooked rice at the bottom of a dinner bowl topped with EVOO sauteed  asparagus, mushrooms and green onions, then topped with diced chicken and sauce.  Again, this does not feel or taste low-fat at all.  Thank you for the recipe!!!!!

This turned out fairly well.  I cut down slightly on the amount of sugar used, and substituted the water with pineapple juice.  This dish has a nice flavor, and we couldn't get enough of the sauce, which is great over rice.  I don't know if the effort involved in making the dish makes the final product quite worth it, though, as  it was time consuming and messy to clean up.  I'll probably make this one again, but it won't be a staple.

we made this to feed a cottage of 12 people and they all loved it :) many ingredients but the turn out was good. be careful not to leave in the oven for too long because the brown sugar gets   stuck onto the baking pan. breaking the chicken breast into smaller pieces before baking is also easier.

As others suggested I cut down sugar and used pineapple juice mix with water then I followed the recipe as directed. I made this chicken for dinner last night and I got many compliments from my bf, he kept saying 'The chicken is so good' :) He even had 3 chicken breasts plus one big portion of rice !!!! So rare to see him eat that much :) Thank you so much Judi for sharing this recipe :)

Yum Yum Yum! Thank you for an excellent recipe!  The only thing I did a little differently was I placed the pineapple on the chicken & uncovered it for the last 20 minutes. (I love pineapple so I used a lot more as well!)

Excelent !!!
Will do again - Need more Oil when browning Chicken, (even with Teflon Frying pan)

One of the few dishes that 'lil Miss. Finikey will devour. 

Only problem so far (second time I made this) was it dryed out - Strictly My fault - was trying to keep it warm in the oven and 10 minuters turned into an hour.  (Still pretty good).

These turned out pretty good.  My husband really liked them.  Probably not something I'll make a lot, but it's a nice change.  I needed to add more oil when cooking the chicken because it started to burn.

This is a great recipe!  I would skip the breaded part altogether and just cook the chicken in the sauce though.  It did take about an hour to bake using almost frozen chicken breasts.  I made this for my husband and his family and they all loved it.  The sauce was very tasty!

I followed this recipe almsot as directed...and it was GOOD! I had to decrease the baking time to 20-25 minutes b/c I only had 4 chicken breasts.  My 5 AND 2 year olds gobbled it up! My 5 year old exclaimed, "Mom, this is the best meal ever!" My husband liked it as well. I served it with Jasmine rice and a side salad. YUM!!

This was tasty.  If you don't like sweet, this is not for you.  I served this over white rice.  I cut the chicken into strips, I used a whole onion, dijon mustard, and juice from the pineapple instead of water in the sauce.  I'll be making this again.

Delicious!  I prepared this dish this past weekend, using the full sauce recipe with only 6 chicken breasts.  I went with the suggestions that I not brown the chicken first.  However, unbeknownst to me, when I put the pans in the oven covered with foil, one of them ripped on my oven thermometer.  I realized what happened when I pulled them out and, frankly, I like the chicken from the partially covered pan more than the ones that had been fully covered, because they were more "candied".  After tasting a little piece, I decided that chicken fried rice from the local Chinese restaurant would have been a perfect side dish.  I will definitely make this again.

This is really a great recipe. I've made it several times and will remain in my recipe collection. I thoroughly browned the chicken in a skillet before transferring into the oven and it was crispy unlike others have found. And After 30 minutes the chicken was done. Great for casual company.

Excellent!  My husband and I love this!!  I have to make it only on a weekend though because taking an hour to bake in the oven is a little long on a 'work night'.  But it's delicious!!!

I used the pineapple juice from the can and made up the rest with water. It was a little dry, so like others have suggested I think I'll skip the frying part next time. Whole family loved this dish- 11 year old even asked for seconds!

Delicious!  However, its very sweet, so make sure you're cooking for those who enjoy a sweet taste.  I halved the brown sugar and it turned out fine.  Overall, a very impressive dish to serve.

This was very good! I only used 4 breasts (pounded just a bit) but made all the sauce. I did as many reviewers suggested & used the pineapple juice for the water & I cut the sugar in half. I used Bill's Seasoned ketchup (from this site) & it added the perfect amount of heat. I  used panko crumbs & didn't cover & I only baked for 40 minutes. I reserved some of the sauce, thickened it w/ some Wondra flour, & added some fresh broccoli & a can of sliced water chestnuts...allowing it to simmer until broccoli was cooked. Served the chicken w/ a side of white rice, covered in the sauce w/ broccoli & water chestnuts. This did remind me of General Tso's chicken. Next time, I will cut back some on the mustard, (I had to add back a little of the brown sugar to cut down on the mustard taste) & I will use chicken tenders so the chicken is covered better w/ the sauce. I meant to leave one breast unbreaded for comparison & forgot but I can already tell you that I would miss the panko crumbs.

Great recipe.  I didn't have soy sauce, but it still turned out great.  My husband said he thought it was similar to orange chicken.  Will do again!

I split the recipe in half and while it was delicious, I would not reduce the sauce in half again as we ran short on "liquid" to drizzle over the chicken. Family loved it!

This was fairly good, but at times it seemed to have such a strong taste, even sickening; maybe there are just way too many strong ingredients.

I don't really like mustard and it was all I could smell while the chicken cooked.  But, it turned out fine.  I have another sweet and sour recipe that I like better, but the hubby said he like this one better.  My 2 1/2 year old ate it all by himself! No coaxing, no nothing.  Picked up the fork and ate it.  That says a lot!  This reciped did use a lot of dishes, but if the kids eat it, I guess I shouldn't complain!

I thought this chicken was okay, but my husband loves it! He begs me to make it.  We cut the chicken into little pieces, add the pineapple, and serve it over rice (like Chinese food).  It's one of his favorite dishes.  Thank you!

My husband is hard to please when it comes to chicken. He likes it fried. He really enjoyed this recipe, it was moist and very tasty. Will cook this again and again.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe!  The reason I am giving it only four stars is because my two children said they really didn't like it.  They thought it was too sweet.  I did cut up the pineapple and put it on top of the chicken before adding the sauce.  Tasted like something you would find in a good Chinese restaurant!

Great recipe!  We really enjoyed this and already had most of the ingredients on hand.  I used less chicken but the same amount of sauce so we could pour it over rice.  Yum!

The chicken tasted excellent. I wasn't paying attention and cooked the chicken for the entire 1 hour. I should have taken the chicken out about 15-20 min sooner, to avoid the slight dryness.

Easy, delicious & I actually had all the ingredients (except pineapple, so I didn't use any).  Gave a few friends "a taste", then had to give them the recipe. Only thing I would change is the name.  Almost didn't try it cuz it sounded like it would be real sweet.  It wasnt.  It was so good! thanks

This was a simple, easy to prepare recipe. I totally forgot to add the pineapple at the end so that might have been the missing ingredient. It is quite sweet so if you're into the sweet stuff this is the chicken recipe for you!

Fabulous! Even my fussy 4 year old loved it. I would reduce the amount of bread crumbs next time & will dip the chicken in egg first to better coat the chicken. GREAT!!

Very good. Will make again with few changes.  Definitely way, way, way too much bread crumbs left. Can reduce to half or less. Baking time too long.  Got too dry.  20-25 min should be enough.  I added pineapple on top towards end of cooking time and poured sauce over.  Gives great flavor to pineapple. I also made extra sauce to go on rice as recommended by others.  Good suggestion.

This was a great recipe, it is alittle sweat but still very good. It's a change of paste on chicken. I did put a can of sweat potatoes in it and my kids still didn't care for the sweat potatoes but they raved about the chicken dish.

I made this chicken as part of my husband's Birthday dinner. Fast and fancy enough. He loved it and so did my children (and me of course)! It's different in taste, so if you don't like "new flavors" than this might not be the right recipe for you. My sister-in-law tried it the next day and said it's "interesting", meaning she's not crazy about it. We still loved it!

We did not have chicken breasts on hand, so we used chicken tenderloins and adjusted the cooking time, it was very yummy! It is on the sweet side, but kinda gathered it would be by the
title "candied". We will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

This is my favorite recipe on this site. I always make extra sauce to serve over rice and everyone in my family loves it. Leftover rice with the sauce is always a great snack or even lunch for the next day!! Very wonderful recipe (and simple)!!!

This was awsome.  My husband is a very picky eater and he couldn't get enought.  I cut the recipe in half at first for just the two of us but it goes so fast that I will make the full amount next time.

This recipe is fantastic.  It isn't what you want if you are looking for quick but it is worth the effort.  No quick chicken recipe can match this.

This was a very easy dish to make.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for us. I used fresh pineapples to top the chicken the last 15 minutes of cooking as others suggested.  There was no big deal made over this dish from the family, so I'll likely not make again.

DEEEEEELICIOUS!!!  The only thing i should've done is add the pineapple rings on the top of the chicken during the last 15-30 mins of baking.  Other than that it was AWESOME.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

I changed very little. I opened the pineapple and add the juice to the sauce.  Then the last 15 min. add the pineapple rings.  My kids and their friends loved it.....

This recipe was good, but I had to play around with the sauce ingredients to suit my taste. I added a bit of pineapple juice and more water. I added pineapple chunks during the last 15 minutes of baking. I served the chicken over rice.

This was good but it didn't turn out how I thought it would. The chicken didn't really caramelise. Next time I will leave off the foil so the sauce thickens and reduces more.

Made this last week and it was delicious.  I added the pineapple rings with 15min left in the cooking time and cooked uncovered until done.  Had some friends over the next night to help out with the leftovers and they raved about it.  Will definately be making this again.

We have been using this recipe for awhile,  so I decided to rate it finally!  
It is VERY VERY good, but we don't use the bread crumbs or the pineapple.  It's my fav. chicken recipe.. and hubby actually eats it..

This was easy and the whole family liked it.  I did use dried minced onion in place of the grated onion and it came out just fine.  I don't think I would use the pineapple rings unless we have guests as no one in the family ate their pineapple ring at dinner.

Sorry, I am going against the reviews.  My family and I didn't enjoy this recipe that much.  We followed the reciped exactly, when it was all said and done we felt the chicken was somewhere in the middle, either not enough bite or needed to be sweeter.  I don't think I would make it again.

My family enjoyed this recipe (made without the breading) so much that they now require me to make it every week! I thought it would be too sweet, but suprisingly, it is not.
Very nice taste, and smells great cooking! 
More of a Sweet & Sour chicken than Candied!! They need to change the name!!  Thank you for a family fav!

Good but very sweet. I cubed my chicken and dredged it in flour before frying. I didn't have bread crumbs on hand. I used a lot more pineapple juice, not water and cooked the pineapple chunks with the chicken. Served over rice with a grean salad. 4 stars instead of 5 only because of all the sugar, not the taste. It was almost like a sweet dessert and I cut back on the sugar! If I make it again I'll add hot pepper flakes and maybe 1/2 Splenda to cut down on calories.

Wow! Thanks for an awesome easy to cook recipe which was as tasty as any other.  The sauce tasted great over mashed potatoes.  With a tossed salad and vegetable dish on the side, was a perfect meal for the wife and I.  Thanks again.

I thought this was pretty good, and my kids all liked the sweetness of the sauce, but I think next time I will not bread and fry the chicken but just pour the sauce over the chicken.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much.  The only changes I made were eliminating the salt as there is plenty in the sauces, and I added the pineapples the last 10 mins. of baking time.  I added more sauce on top before eating, my husband left his the way it was, and I think his tasted better.  The bread crumb portion of this recipe could be halved, it goes a long way.

My whole family loved this chicken, even the kids! I followed the recipe exactly, except I put the pineapples on with about 10 to 15 miutes left to bake. It is alot of work, but if you have the time it's worth it!

The chicken had a really good flavor....kinda a lot of work to get it together though. My very picky son liked it so that says it all. I'll make it again on a weekend or something when I have more time to prepare..not after work when it doesn't get done until 7:00.

I LOVE THIS RECEIPE... The next time that I make it I am going to pound the chicken before I get it ready to fry to make it a little more tender when it is all said and done... otherwise this is a great receipe!!!

Great flavor, and had everything I needed in the pantry.  My husband loved it, I thought it could have been made without the breading and would still be just as good.

I am really picky with chicken, but i love this recipe!  THe sauce is very sweet, but it's so good!  The chicken comes out very tender - you can cut with a fork.

This recipe was a huge hit with me and DH.  I only had Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs, so I used crushed  Cheerios to coat the chicken and did not use the oregano.  I also used pineapple juice in place of water and reduced the amount of brown sugar and mustard.  I baked the pineapple on top of the chicken and served it over brown rice with carrots.  The sauce was a great companion to the rice.  Can't wait to have this one again!

It was a hit! I added less oregano like other reviewers suggested and my chicken was a thinner cut so I only baked it for 20-25 minutes and it came out perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Absolutly awsome!! I added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce while it's boiling ... adds a nice kick .  Also used pineappe cubes instead of the rings. It's become one of our favorite regular dishes.

A+ recipe!  My whole family really enjoyed this one which is a shock because half of them swear they don't care for sweet chicken.  I followed some of the previous suggestions and cut back on the mustard and oregano and I doubled the sauce recipe.  I also added pineapple tidbits in place of the rings and used the juice in place of water.  Served it with egg noodles and green beans.  I will be making this again!!!  Thanks so much!!!

Had this last night for dinner and everyone enjoyed it very much. I thought it was maybe just a tad too sweet. I will make it again definitely but maybe cut back just a little on the sweet ings.

I REALLY love this recipe. Since discovering it, I've made it once a week for the past 2 months. The chicken comes out really tender, and the sauce is excellent. I always serve it with white rice. The name really isn't very good, the taste is not too sweet, and definitely not "candied"

This is a fantastic recipe. So Yummy!! I took some of the reviewers advice and did not add any breading to the chicken, I cut the mustard and sugar in half. It was perfect with those minor adjustments!

I think it was okay.  My family loved it.  Tasted mustardy - I think I would make it again with out the mustard.  I like the sweet sauce with the breading.  I also think I will pound the chicken a little thinner next time....

I used all the pineapple juice from the can (which was tidbits instead of rings) to substitute for the water. And also added the tidbits to the sauce during heating and thusly baked the pineapple with the chicken.   I also used boneless skineless thighs, turned out so moist. It was great!

I had this recipe in my recipe box for about a month.  I finally decided to try it, and it was great.  My husband absoulutely loved it and ate 2 servings and my son who hates everything (exspecially meat) loved this and ate a whole chicken breast.  Next time I will make with white rice and double the sauce to pour over the rice.  Another fantastic recipe from this site.

Absolutely the yummiest and most tender chicken I have ever tasted, whether cooked by me or someone else! (and I'm usually very bored by chicken breast dishes) I suppose the breading could be skipped, but I wouldn't because it soaks up all the sauce and keeps the flavor on the chicken.

This was absolutely fantastic!  The only change I made was to use chicken breast tenders (the breast cut into smaller strips) instead of the whole breast.  They came out very moist and delicious.  Highly recommended.

I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and used low sodium Worcestershire and Soy sauce. Like other reviews stated, there was a lot of breading left over. I didn't pound out the chicken breasts (there were four)to flatten them. Pan fried each for three minutes per side and baked in oven (covered) for about 30 minutes. Very juicy and tangy. I would agree with another post that it does have a "Chinese food" flavor about it. A simple side dish of plain buttered eggs noodles went well.

EXCELLENT chicken.  The whole family said this is a keeper.  I breaded and cooked the chicken in the skillet the night before just because I didn't want my chicken to go bad.  Turned out wonderful.

Not what I was looking for. Tasted a little too mustard-y for me.

This dish was really good. I served it for my in-laws and there was only a few pieces left (I made enough for everyone to have two breasts!). I too had a lot of crumbs left over from the breading. It was really good - I think next time I'll try it without the breading.

This recipe was amazingly delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I made the recipe exactly according to the recipe and the only thing I would change is the amount of bread crumbs you use.  I had a lot left over and each piece was well coated.  I will definetly make this one again.

This sauce is quite good.  The ingredients look daunting, but it really isn't hard to make it.  It's sort of like a sweet and sour/BBQ sauce, but it's different than most things I have tried from the store.  Most of the time I don't serve them with pineapple rings, and I add a couple dashes of cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.  I also only add a tiny bit of mustard, as I don't like mustard.  I have made this several times and serve it with rice.

Delicious, delicious, DELICIOUS!!! The only thing I changed about the recipe was that instead of putting on raw pineapple rings, I coated them with a cinnimon/sugar mixture, then "sauted" them in the pineapple juice. This way, the juices melt right into the chicken. Also, I poured more sauce on the chicken after I put the pineapple on. I served the chicken with cranberry sauce, baby corn, french bread, and alfredo noodles. This makes for an absolutely perfect dinner dish.And it's soooo easy to make!!!

This was very good.  I did not have boneless chicken breasts on hand, so I used split breasts and boneless thights (hubby picked up the wrong item at the grocery store!).  The only change I made was to use half of the mustard.  The chicken turned out moist and delicious.  I'll definitely make this again.

Definitely a family favorite! Good with buttered noodles, and reheats beautifully. I cut the chicken into 1" cubes instead of leaving the chicken breasts whole. Thanks, Judi!

Great flavor.  I used less mustard than was called for because I tought the amount called for was too much.  I am happy that I did this.   Very wonderful especially over rice.   I will be called to make this recipe again & again.

Fabulous! I made this for dinner tonight. Basically I followed the recipe to a "T".  We are only two folks so I scaled it down to 4 servings. I added a bit of seseme oil to the rice when I served it.  I added frozen petite peas to the rice..it was wonderful!

This recipe was easy to prepare, despite having many ingredients (all of which are regulars in the pantry anyway).  My family loved it!!!  It would also be a great glaze for chicken wings for a football party or other casual events.  Go Maryland Terps!

Ohmigosh!! This recipe was awesome. I followed it exactly, except for the pineapple rings at the end. I was patting myself on the back while eating it. The leftovers also went very well in a tortilla wrap with ranch, lettuce, and cheese. Yummy. Thanks!

This recipe was very good. My two year old just loved it. I made it twice. The first time I used the oregano and we thought it tasted strong so the next time I omitted it and it tasted much better. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I've made this several times and my husband and I always enjoy it.  Even my 18 month old loves it.  (He makes lots of yummy noises!)  I do skip the pineapple rings.  The best part is the ingredients are usually on hand so it's easy to make in a pinch.  Thanks, Judi!

This recipe is great. The taste reminds me alot of General Tao's chicken. This is great on rice. The only alteration I made was adding some mango chutney and leaving out the pineapple. It was sweet enough without it. I will make this again!

This is great.  Received great reviews from my husband and brother.  Would probably be just as good without the breading when you're in a hurry.  Husband thinks it soaks up the sauce and makes it more flavorful, but I'll try it without!

I loved the sauce although I'm not too sure about breading it, it turns out a little too slimy once it blends w/ the sauce.  Overall, the chicken came out very juicy and tender. Great w/ rice and almondine string beans. Will def. make it again.

The kids loved this recipe! The only thing I would change would be the length of cooking time. The breasts were a little over done. Maybe 40 minutes instead. Thanks for a great recipe.

My fiance and I had company over to eat dinner, and this meal was a great success!  Our friends think I am a world class chef!  I made this dish with white rice, and I saved some of the sauce to put over the rice.  I also made "garlic green beans" and the combo was great!  Thanks!

Three cheers for this one. My husband loved it and my children gobbled it up.  I used seasoned bread crumbs, as they were all I had in the cupboard, and the results were fine.  I'll add this to my cooking repertoire for sure.

My husband and I and older daughter enjoyed this chicken, but younger one wasn't crazy about it.  I thought it had a slight BBQ/teriyaki flavor to it, which I thought was perfect for the chicken.

I thought this was pretty good and my husband
thought it was "Awesome", so I will definately
be making it again. I made the Fried Rice (with
bacon) from this site with it.

Great recipe!! I also opted not to bread the chicken and cut it into bite size pieces. This saves a little time and the results are still delicious. It reminds me of a Chinese flavor,so I served stir fry veggies and egg rolls.

It was a good thing I packed up some of this for my husband's lunch before serving dinner because what was left was gone in a flash!  I cubed the chicken and cooked it with peppers and pineapple and my only complaint would be the sauce was thinner than I was expecting.  I made it Monday night and it's already being requested for dinner again.

What amazed me about this recipe is that I have all the ingredients as pantry mainstays!!!  Sauce works great as a basting on salmon too!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe over rice and with a side dish of good old green beans! I cut up the chicken breasts into cubes first, then mixed it with the bread crumbs and everything.  It takes a little bit longer, but it was worth it.  (I didn't use the pineapple)....Delicious flavor!

My kids loved the sauce. Would make again for sure, but probably would not bread the chicken as it tasted mushy (the breading). Next time will cut up chicken into bite size pieces and just top with the excellent sauce!

This chicken is tasty and pretty.  The color of the chicken when they come out of the oven are eye-appealing.  A yummy treat.

Instead of 2 tsps salt, I used 1 tsp seasoning and 1 tsp salt.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1-1/4 cups which made the sauce less sticky, it was absolutely fantastic!  My family loved it!
