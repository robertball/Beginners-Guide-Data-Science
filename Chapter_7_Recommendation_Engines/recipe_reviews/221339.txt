My parents used to buy Nasi Goreng from a local shop when I was a child. This recipe is a perfect reflection of that delicious dish. It's interesting to me that the addition of curry is what gives this dish it's unique taste. This is a new family favorite comfort food! My only change was the addition of peas to make it a complete meal.

This is very yummy!!! I also like to use the pre-mix package you can find in some stores. Its only the spices. You still have to use rice, meat, veggies ect... Its great with pork too!!
