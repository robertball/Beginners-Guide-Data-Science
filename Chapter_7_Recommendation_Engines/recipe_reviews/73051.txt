I made this salad because I was growing some mint, and needed to find a use for it.  I was intrigued by the garbanzo beans/raisin combination.  I made the salad as the directions stated, and the first night it was very bland.  My husband thought there was something missing also.  
However, the next day, the salad was much, much better.  The flavors had been able to mix together, and I liked the combination of cucumbers/beans and raisins.  The mint wasn't very strong, but it was a nice surprise in some mouthfuls.  I'd give it 1 star the day you make it, but 4 stars if you let it set.

I didn't have celery and used half a fuji apple instead. Also didn't use the beans and red wine vinegar! :P The salad still turned out pretty ok! Will try another time with the beans! Thanks for the recipe!

Hubby thought it was a little "strong" (vinegary) but I loved it. Up the sweetness though, more honey.

This started out way too dry, so I added more vinegar.  Still dry the next day.  Add more vinegar.  Better... Add some honey as another member suggested and it was okay.  I'm not sure how much the mint adds.  If I make this again I think I'd skip the mint and start out adding about 3x the vinegar and then some sugar or honey.

The random sweetness of the raisins really made this salad pop for me.

This was a good light twist on salad and it refrigerates well.  I look forward to making it again but I may omit the olive oil to reduce the calories.

I love the healthy ingredients in this salad but the combination was really weird.  Not a hit with my family.
