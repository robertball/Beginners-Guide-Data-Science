I tried this and the other recipe on the site for Pecan Tassies and this one by FAR blew me away.  The crust alone absolutely makes it - light, fluffy and delicious.  I'm using it for other recipes, too.    One thing I changed was that, instead of all nuts and sugar for the filling I used a can of pecan pie filling, 1/4 C. brown sugar and a tsp of maple syrup along with maybe an 1/8 of a cup chopped pecans.  BUT I topped each one with a pecan half before baking, then drizzled with white chocolate.  OMG, I had to make a second batch because I (literally) ate nearly the entire first batch.  One word of caution, though - make sure you use a muffin TIN and not just the cups.  The cups just don't hold up - the end up oblong and some even spilled.  Also I chill the dough overnight and roll it out between parchment paper and use a cookie cutter for a more uniform crust and better overall look, not to mention saving yourself from getting slimey hands.

Excellent !  I did substitute the semi-sweet chocolate topping with a 1/4 cup cappuccino coffee drink mix and 3/4 cup confectioners sugar mixed with 2 tablespoons water and a single whole pecan

Well, these tasted great, but were not the most beautiful cookie.  I have been making a similar recipe for years.  I added about 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to the crust recipe, I think this helped to add a little bit of sweetness which I think the crust usually lacks.  For some reason my filling appeared a little dried out. Definitely not as pretty as the picture

Delicious!  I added some cinnamon/nutmeg to the nut mix and substituted pecans with almonds & walnuts (didn't have any pecans on hand) and it worked great!  I am not a fan of cream cheese but you can not taste it at all in this recipe.

These are so, so yummy and look very nice on a plate combined with other cookies/desserts. They are great with or without the chocolate!
