This a good recipe but I would suggest some modification.  1) Double Crepe batter and adjust thickness with milk to the consistency of Heavy Cream. Leftovers freeze well for about a month. 2)Place the Cheese in a fine sieve or cheese cloth lined colander overnight to firm and dry. Drained Ricotta works very well, or, depending on your part of the country, Friendship Farmers Cheese is a classic choice.  3)For an Extra Crispy exterior, saute over medium/high heat in Butter turning until Brown and Crisp.  4)To finish sprinkle with cinnamon sugar OR Top with your favorite Fruit Preserves and Sour cream. I'm partial to Strawberry or Blueberry! Enjoy...JJ

I followed recipe, but used ricotta cheese. Batter was just fine.  I even used skim milk. Served with strawberry preserves and sour cream, a must.
This is a hit with my friends and me.

I had two problems with this recipe.  The crepe batter was too thick and after struggling to get it to spread in the pan, I added water to make it workable.  I had the opposite problem with the filling.   It was very thin and difficult to work with.  Even after beating on high speed for 5 minutes, it was still not really smooth, as called for.  The thinness of the filling made it hard to get much filling inside the crepes and there was a lot of filling left over.  I wonder if the cottage cheese should be drained before adding?

These were delicious!  Be sure to use full fat cottage cheese - I used low fat (what I had on hand) and it went runny when baked, but the taste was fantastic!  I doubled the batch and made some plain crepes for the kids and had just enough filling, ending up with 12 filled crepes and 8 plain. I will definitely do this one again

Just so so. Crepes came out fine, but the filling tasted too much like cottage cheese for my liking. We topped it with canned cherry pie filling or sugar & cinnamon. Tasty but could be better.

I used Basic Crepes from AR as the base as this is our favourite recipe, I doubled the recipe which made 12 crepes with a 1/3 cup scoop. For the cheese part, I think the recipe submitter means dry curd cottage cheese or farmer's cheese as the cottage cheese we know is too liquidy. I used ricotta cheese and the texture was perfect, next time I would add lemon zest to bump up the lemon taste. I used a 1/8 cup scoop for the filling and I had enough for 12 exactly. I baked them in a 350 degree oven as 425 is way too high for the delicate crepes. My grandmother fried them in butter after filling then sprinkled buttered bread crumbs over top. I served with apricot sauce and my sons loved them.

The crêpes were not bad. Batter seemed thin, but this is my first experience making crêpes. I bought a crepe maker to try this out. The filling was very bland. I think I would have liked ricotta better.  Too much filling, too little batter.  I’ll look for another recipe for cheese blintzes.

Great recipe. Other reviews are correct, I needed a double batch of batter for appx. 15 crepes. I also used ricotta cheese. We use a low sugar fruit spread as a topping. My family loves them.
