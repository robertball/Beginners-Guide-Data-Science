This was absolutely the best meatloaf I have ever made, or had for that matter, in my life.  I highly recommend it.  The savory sweet glaze is fantastic!  My whole crew normally puts ketchup on everything.  Not one of them reached for it!!  Amazing!

I've always found meat loaf bland and a hard sell at my dinner table, until I found this recipe.   It's been my stand-by for a couple of years now.   Thanks Matt!

Made no changes. Never do if I'm going to rate a recipe.  Family and friends raved about the end product. Skeptical at first with no tomato sauce included in recipe. Perfect texture and taste. Thanks.

a couple of recommendations 1. saute the onions and carrots first and let cool 2.  spread the cheese on a pan and put in the freezer before mixing it in--it clumps less 3.  add cider vinegar to the ketchup brown sugar and mustard and simmer to reduce.  4.  don't sm.oth the top of the meatloaf--make peaks so it gets crunchy bits.  5. don't put into a loaf pan--put on double aluminum foil on a cooling rack and mound so the fat runs off and you get more crunchy outside

I've tried different meatloaf recipes on my 12 year old son over the years with no success...until this one!  He loved it and very nearly ate the whole thing in one sitting.  I didn't have any carrots or onions in the house and it was still fantastic.  Recommend using 3 slices of bread as the recipe calls for, not dried bread crumbs and plan your meal sides timing for 1-1/2 hour cooking time (center not up to temp at 1 hour or even 1-1/4 hours).  Thank you for posting a wonderful recipe!

This meat loaf was the really the best meat loaf ever. I didn't have the usual ingredients for my own meat loaf, so I got on here to look for a different recipe. I followed this recipe exactly. The only difference was that I baked it in a small roasting pan instead of a loaf pan. My husband who LOVES meat loaf raved about this...and ate 3 servings. I wouldn't change a thing...and it's replacing my usual meat loaf from now on. YUMMY!!!!

My husband was very skeptical when I said I was making a meatloaf this Christmas, as he had always found them dry and tasteless. This was a huge crowd-pleaser and my husband loved it so much I am making it again two days later. If you like traditional, dry meatloaf that mostly tastes like bread, you will probably not enjoy this recipe, but for normal human beings that like a juicy, flavorful, meaty dish, you cannot go wrong with this recipe!

Let me start by saying I HATE meatloaf.  Despise it.  But my husband loves it so I have been trying to find a recipe that he would love and I would tolerate.  After at least 6 recipes I have done better- we both love this meatloaf!  I actually ate 75% of the meatloaf before my husband had a chance to touch it.  I made no substitutions and the meatloaf was moist, stayed together, and was flavorful.  It was also so easy to make next time I'll make two, if just to give my husband a fighting chance at getting more.

Just tried this tonight. I followed the recipe as written (except for the glaze). Patted it into a loaf and cooked it on the broiler pan so the fat could drain off. I found out with another recipe that if you add 1/4 to 1/2 lb. of ground sausage, the loaf will hold together into slices. This was loose. I think 2 eggs and the milk is too much. I will try 1 egg and add milk a little at a time, plus a little sausage to bind it more. The kids liked it, even with carrots. We used colby instead of cheddar. Flavor is awesome, so its definitely going in the recipe box!

This meatloaf is great! I left out the carrots and I used a hot mustard but other than that I followed the recipe.  My husband said it was the best meatloaf he's ever had.

Absolutely delicious. I omitted the carrots simply because I didn't have any in the house and didn't want to go to the grocery store (9 miles one way). I used a little bit of beef bouillon (about half a cube) as well since it's something I've used in other meatloaf recipes that I have always liked. Very moist, rich flavor. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Tried this last night, loved it !! It is truly named properly!!! I did change one thing. I usually decrease the salt if I notice additional ingredients that have a sodium content. That being said, cheese usually is salty to a degree, so, I just added 1 tsp of salt then instead of the second tsp I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning . Love! Love, loved it !!! Thanks for this simple and wonderful recipe !!! ??

Fantastic meatloaf! I was a little skeptical after reading through the ingredients---seemed a bit basic, but it had wonderful flavor and texture and lived up to its name! Kids loved it too ;) Will be my go-to meatloaf recipe from now on.

I have made this recipe 3 times. The first time I made as is according to directions (no milk added though). I thought it was delicious and so did my 4 year old who ate it in just a few minutes (usually takes 30 minutes or more to eat dinner!) My picky husband felt it needed tweaked. So the 2nd one i again followed everything according to directions, but rather than putting the sauce mix on top in the pan, I drained the meat and then placed the loaf upside down on a flat pan. I then took the sauce and put it on the loaf as if icing a cake, then followed rest of directions. (Again the 4 year old gobbled it up).
Well on the third time, again hubby needed to tweak it, I made everything according to directions, but replaced onion with a packet of beefy onion soup mix. And again did the flip over onto a flat pan and iced the loaf with a different sauce mix (Tomato paste, ketchup, and bbq sauce). The sauce mix still needs work, but the meatloaf was great. (Each time the 4 year old devoured the meatloaf, and asked for seconds and thirds!) This is a great recipe as is, but is fun to try different things!

Made this for the first time last night for dinner. WOW! Made a few tweaks, main change was using 3 types of meats (beef, pork, veal of equal amounts); used Italian bread crumbs instead of bread, less brown sugar and no carrots or cheese. Still the best meatloaf I ever had.

I had been trying to make meatloaf for MONTHS because it is one dish I've never tried to make, but every time I made mention of it, my husband did not seem enthused... So one day I had to use up leftover beef and just didn't tell him what we'd be having for supper.  He looked suspicious when he took his first bite, and then exclaimed, "I don't even like meatloaf but this is AMAZING!  It doesn't taste like dog food!".  Heck of a compliment, eh? ;)  Now he requests it frequently and no longer can say that he doesn't like meatloaf.  Thanks Matt!  Your recipe is the best we've both ever had and I followed it to the T!

I tweaked my recipe a bit by using a cup of Italian bread crumbs and no carrots because I am not a big carrot fan. I did double the sauce recipe and placed potatoes and vegies along with the meatloaf, and oh my gosh it was the best meatloaf I ever had and I loved the sauce over the potatoes and vegetable. This recipe is a keeper!

I just finished making this recipe for the second time. Both times I used panko crumbs instead of bread. Everything else is like the original called for. The best meatloaf you will ever put into your mouth bar NONE!

This was delicious!  Next time I will reduce the milk and use 1 egg as it was so soupy I had to pour about 2 cups of liquid out of the pan even though I used 97% lean ground beef. The topping was not too sweet.

New favorite meatloaf recipe!  I took the chance to make this for my step dad who is a huge fan of meatloaf but kind of picky.   He really liked it so I will absolutely be making it again.  It tastes just as good warmed up the next day

Made this substituting a cup of Japanese breadcrumbs and steak sauce for the bread and catsup - big hit with my father, the meatloaf expert. Great recipe.

I thought there were too many onions for the amount of meat used. And I had to drain a lot of water out of the pan after 75 minutes, then put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes. I also didn't care for the added sweetness from the shredded carrots. The overall taste was fine. I think it would be great with less onions and no carrots.

Love this! Finally have a meatloaf recipe thatis not a hunk of meat in a pan. I love that there are carrots in there. I use slices of whole wheat bread and do everything in the food processor. Just a few pulses and then add to the meat. I can have it in the oven in 5 minutes. We top it with barbecue sauce. I have also used the drippings to make gravy. Very good! Thank you!

Made it exactly as the recipe suggested, we loved it and it was done in 1hr 15 mins. I'm not a big fan of mustard but in trying to stay with the recipe's and not be one of the "was great but I changed almost everything" reviewers I used the mustard. The Glaze was great! Thanks!

I have to say that this meatloaf was delicious! I didn't change a thing. However, the cook time needs to be longer. At 350 degrees, in my oven, it took about 2 hours, give or take a few minutes. Other than that, absolutley no complaints from me! The whole family loved it.

Really really good. I halved the ingredients and it was perfect for two without leftovers. It was done in about an hour. Be sure to follow the directions regarding mixing steps, it's important for even distribution of the ingredients. I baked it in a glass loaf pan. No gravy is needed for this meatloaf because it is so moist. If you choose to make a brown gravy you should probably eliminate the savory topping.

I'm not a huge meatloaf fan but my husband and I thought this was very good. I made it exactly as directed. The only thing I will do differently next time is double the topping. We both really liked it and wished there was a bit more of it!

I REALLY liked it - had nice flavor and is easy to add other favorite seasoning or whatever - I stayed with this recipe, but would try some of the variations mentioned in the reviews next time.  
I did use bottled barbecue sauce for the topping and bread crumbs instead of the bread.  
thanks for the nice recipe

Being a young adult, I finally cooked my first meat loaf for my bf and he loved it and everyone else, this recipe is fantastic I sure will be using this in the future. I enjoyed it very much, I used all the ingredients listed and came out perfect, add crackers & it will be more amazing. FYI make a lot of sauce because you will be needing more than what's listed!

The carrots didn't cook in mine so you got these hard/chewy "chunks:(yes, it was shredded) throughout. Also we all felt the carrot flavor was overpowering. I may try this without the carrots & see how that goes. Sorry, those carrots just ruined it for us :(

Made it just as indicated except used two pound of beef. I need to really chop the Onions up a little more then I did. Without doing this, when you cut the slices up to serve the slices don’t hold fully together. But that was a  very minor issue. Everyone loved this and my search for the perfect recipe for meatloaf is over. Very good.

Thanks for the great recipe Matt, I made 2 slight changes-bread crumbs vs sliced bread and a couple of shakes of Montreal Steak Seasoning. Served to 5 dinner guests with wild rice and roasted Brussel sprouts, and Chef Johns Apple Rosettes. Everything was perfect, this will be my"Go To" Meatloaf from now on.

I love this recipe!!! I followed all the directions except I had an extra large onion so I didn't add quite as much as called for. My 75 year old mother who doesn't like meatloaf or any other chop meat is still telling me how delicious this was. I am definitely keeping this recipe. Thank you!!!

I made this as close to the recipe as possible, except I didn't have enough cheddar so used about half swiss. Added  one stalk of celery, finely minced because I wasn't sure two carrots made one cup, they did.  Processed onions, carrots, bread slices and cheese individually in food processor.  Combined beaten eggs, S&P, milk separately...
Did I mention that I more than doubled the recipe using 3+
lbs of ground chuck?  Thats the great thing on AllRecipes, its so easy to do that.  It made four loaves in those aluminum pans you can buy.  I froze the other three.  I kinda held my breath since I made four loaves.......not disappointed in the least.  I think its the best meatloaf recipe ever!  Very moist and flavorful.

My husband and son really like meatloaf, and despite the fact that I don't like it, I'll occasionally make it for them.  

This meatloaf was SOOOO GOOD that I even ate leftovers of it and wish I had made two loaves!  I didn't have the shredded carrots so that was the only "modification" and boy oh boy I hate to admit it, because in my 36 years on this planet I've hated meatloaf, but I loved this recipe!!!

OMG too much salt!!!! Why isn't anyone saying anything about the extremely salty taste of this meatloaf?   Was it a typo in the recipe that wasn't there in 2012 when most reviews were written? Gack!!!  I will try to make it again with no salt & see how it tastes.

Both times I've made this recipe, it's been delicious but has taken way longer than the instructions suggest (1 hour and 30-45 minutes). I might try this again in the future at a higher temperature. But otherwise, the end product is delicious!

This was the best meatloaf I've ever had, honestly.  I have never been a lover of meatloaf, too dry or tasteless.  I made it because it was fast, cheap and you could always add tons of ketchup.  Well this recipe changed me forever, we actually fought over the leftovers for lunch the next day (I won) it was that good! I made it exactly as given except for the carrots as I didn't have any but I will add them next time for sure!

Good basic recipe.  I used a cup of seasoned Croutons  which I ground up in a blender; added fresh Chopped Onion, Green Pepper,Celery and Italian Parsley,mixed Brown Sugar with Marinara Sauce, laid a strip of Bacon over the meatloaf and poured sauce over it.

I rarely (never) follow a recipe line by line unless I'm really out of my element.  But I did in this case and it came out fantastic.  I will probably extend the seasonings on the next run, but as is this recipe rocked.

Never made meatloaf before but felt for a change and decided to give this recipe a shot. I changed nothing and I absolutely loved it! Even my picky brother was impressed. Worth every five star rating it's gotten. Needless to say I have added this to my recipe box and will be making it again and again and again.

I don't use carrots just because I never have them. I have never been a fan of meatloaf but I find this AMAZING. I use spicy brown mustard and lay strips of bacon across the top before adding the glaze. It's now my favorite meal!

Very delicious!  I pretty much doubled the recipe because I had a 3 lb package of hamburger.  Added 3 eggs because they were large.  Doubled the spices.  I really don't like bread in my meatloaf, so I opted for 1 cup of uncooked instant oatmeal.  And I used a 15 1/2 oz can of tomato sauce mixed with the mustard, no brown sugar.  I added potatoes and carrots around the meatloaf and baked it at 350 for about 2 1/2 hours.  Very comforting and delicious!

It was edible and not bad, but I had two problems with this recipe... the onion and the sugar.  I ended up only using about 1/3 of the onion called for in this recipe, since a whole onion would have been far too much.  It would have been more precise to offer a chopped measurement.  Depending on your onion-to-hamburger ratio preference, I'd say about 3/4 to 1 cup of onion, chopped.  I recommend that you chop it very fine, sauté it first, or grate it like the carrot.  At the end of an hour at 350F and despite being chopped fairly small, the onion was only about half-cooked.  I also found using equal parts ketchup and brown sugar made the sauce too sweet.  In future preps, two tablespoons brown sugar for me, max. 

Will make again, but with many modifications.

Turned out great.  We ended up omitting the onion and using a Lipton onion mix packet instead. We also omitted the carrots.  Saved as a favorite.

This meatloaf is great! I followed the recipe with a few very minor exceptions. I used a tad less milk and a tad less cheddar cheese (but not much less). I also didn't include the shredded carrot because that didn't sound very appealing to me. I grated the cheese with the fine side of the grater so that there wouldn't be gooey cheese inside and it would just blend, which worked well. To those who are skeptical about adding cheese, don't be. It just adds a little extra flavour, but it's not too obvious. I used my Vitamix blender to crumble the bread with a few pulses. I have read some reviews that say that there's not enough sauce, but I think that the amount is perfect, unless you want your meatloaf to be swimming in sauce. The one thing that I would recommend is less salt - 1 tsp should be sufficient. It was a little too salty for my and my family's taste. Other than that, it was delicious!

This was amazing! I used oat nut bread that was bigger than an average slice, I used Triscut whole wheat crackers and 90/10 lean ground beef. I skipped the optional milk. Texture and taste was awesome. The sour cream really added that something special. The oats and nuts in the bread gave it an occassional great moist and subtle kind of crunch. I will dial the pepper back 1 teaspoon or so next time, it was a bit over the top. Caramelizing the onion and garlic and then adding the salt and pepper to soak up the essential oils in the skillet really added to the flavor.

Super yummy, great recipe.  I added some frozen chopped peppers and onions along with some garlic powder and it was heavenly!  Next time I'll cut back on the salt just a bit, but it's really an awesome recipe.

This really is the best meatloaf I've ever had. It reminds me a bit of In n Out burgers. My fiance agreed that it's better than meatloaf he's had at expensive restaurants. I used 1 lb instead of 1.5 lbs of meat and kept the rest of the recipe the same. The final product was phenomenal taste-wise, but there was quite a bit of liquid in the pan when I took it out of the oven. Anyone have tips for this? My other user error was that I should have chopped the onion a little more finely and maybe use less onion since I cut back on the meat. Definitely will make again.

Tried this recipe and it is excellent.  A keeper!  Of course the brown sugar helps.  Thought it might be too much onion, but not the case.

The only reason I even looked for a different meatloaf recipe was that I lacked the tomato sauce needed for my old meatloaf (I've been making the same recipe from a cookbook printed in 1963) for at least 34 years. What a surprise it was to eat THIS meatloaf! Taste, texture and sauce are awesome! I will not be making my old recipe ever again. BTW I used a combination of ground venison, beef and pork. Everything else was as written.

I made this recipe using a box of savory herb stuffing for the bread and spices. No carrots or onions and less brown sugar because we are not sweets lovers. Yummm! My husband said it was the best he ever had and I concur! Thanks for a keeper.

i try to make as few changes as possible to the recipes on this site.
with this one i skipped the carrots and substituted barbecue sauce for the ketchup which i didn't have (and don't like).

followed everything else exactly and was this great!

much better than the lipton onion soup meat loaf i used to make...with a lot less sodium

This recipe certainly lives up to its name! Made this last night and it was a huge hit. Even my toddler loved it. The only change I made was to reduce the salt to one teaspoon. It was so moist and delicious! I served it with rice and made some extra sauce. My husband was looking for leftovers today but there were none! Yummy!

This was delicious! I did not add carrot because I'm not a huge fan of them. Instead of bread I used 3/4 cup italian seasoned bread crumbs. I baked it in a glass baking dish and noticed there to be quite a bit of liquid (fat) in the bottom of the dish. I just trasnferred it to another dish and served from there, no big deal. I will definately be putting this in my recipe book!

This is my favorite meatloaf and I have tried many. I use whole grain bread from Pepperidge Farm and I think it really adds to it. Sometimes I add red pepper flakes, sometimes I don't. This is a winner!

For years I have tried different meatloaf recipes but none of them were flavorful enough or held together.  My search is over!  So simple and so delicious with very few ingredients.  I was leery of adding cheese but it is a nice subtle flavor addition.  Thanks for a new family favorite.

I used two pounds of hamburger, and left out the carrots and the cheese.  It was awesome.  I have used the same meatloaf recipe for years, but this may be my new go-to recipe.  The loaf held together beautifully, no crumbling.  And the sauce was fantastic.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was really tasty and the texture was perfect.  Didn't crumble or fall apart at all, and the glaze has a wonderful flavor.  I made mine into mini meatloafs, which my husband and children loved.  Will be making again!

I made this meatloaf for the family this evening. I got rave reviews....even from my wife who usually dislikes meatloaf. She had seconds! I did add 2 stalks of chopped celery. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. Big thumbs up!

I've been making this recipe for years and I won't use any other meatloaf recipe. With that being said, I do typically use bell pepper in place of the carrot but that is just a personal preference. For the shredded cheese I recommend a sharp cheddar. My favorite is Sargento's 4 state cheddar mix. Having a few different kinds of cheese in there kind of adds something, but I have made it with one kind as well. Definitely give this recipe a try!

Made almost exactly as the recipe called.  I substituted the cheddar cheese for light Tex-mex cheese.  And I did not put in bread as I am trying to limit carbs.  Hubby and I thought it was delicious.

We loved this recipe! I omitted the cheese and added a slosh of worchestershire sauce. Upped the carrot to almost one cup and added chopped mushrooms. Made with moose meat. Doubled the sauce for the top. And made in muffin tin for individual servings and easy leftover storage (not that that lasted long!).

Decided to make this before I realized that we had no bread or onions in the house.  So I substituted 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and added onion powder and garlic.  It was amazing!  No leftovers!

My husband took one bite and exclaimed  "this meatloaf is fabulous !!"  and I have to agree'.  I used TraderJoe's sharp white cheddar cheese with caramelized onions which gave it a special taste. I added to the sauce for the top about one tablespoon each of Worchester sauce and Balsamic vinegar; which made it a ''sauce diablo".  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and I definitely plan to make this again.

I omitted the carrots and added chopped green peppers, otherwise its identical to the one I have made for 40 years. Oh, didn't have cubed bread so used Panko. Thanks for sharing!
One thing I do that's fun is make a "trough" up the middle of the loaf and place the ketchup mix there rather than spread all over the top.  Its attractive and allows you to taste the meat by itself.

I made this Gluten Free with a few changes. Gluten-free bread crumbs absorb less liquid so I omitted the milk and left out the mustard. I used half an onion because that is all I had and used one pound of ground chicken.  I cooked it until the thermometer it hit 165-degree. It took about 1 hour and 25 mins. 

My husband and son like it. Served with mashed potato and apple sauce.  Will cook again.

Delicious! Definitely the “best ever” meatloaf I’ve ever made. I didn’t put the sauce on top (neither my husband or myself like the sweetness) but the meatloaf itself was amazing.

This was fantastic!!! I made it for a family gathering I had over last minute (14 people total) so I made a few batches and wanted to try something different, I had everything on hand.  I was truly shocked to see one of the people below said they didn’t like it.  Everyone was ranting and raving here on how delicious is was and even asked if how I made it. It was a total success! The taste, texture and everything was amazing. I did a side of baked potatoes with sour cream and chives and also regular mashed with sour cream for them to choose with French style green beans sautéed with onions and garlic. DELICIOUS.. your recipe name is spot on.  Great job

This is a very hearty and great tasting meatloaf. No need to add any condiments while eating as the flavor is satisfying. This time I added a little ground Italian sausage to the mix and while it gives the meatloaf a little zing, it does make it a little greasy so I would probably stick to the original recipe for best results.

My family and I agreed this was the best meatloaf we've ever had. I covered mine with aluminum foil which kept it moist and tasty. Next time I make it I'm gonna take the foil off for the final 15 minutes to let the topping get a bit crispy. Easy and super tasty.

This was probably the best and easiest meat loaf I have made. The flavors blended beautifully, it cooked in the amount of time shown, with a slightly crispy top crust, looked and tasted great. No question, I will be making this again soon!

I think this is a solid meatloaf recipe, easy and tasty. I do make adjustments but this is easy to adjust to your liking and make it your family’s favorite. I use oatmeal instead of bread, my sister uses rice. I also  sub apple cider vinegar instead of mustard and use brown sugar. My husband loves this recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly as is, and this was truly one of the best meatloaf’s I have ever made.  My husband loves meatloaf (me not so much), but I gobbled it down like it was trying to run from my plate.  So easy, not a lot of ingredients, and the results are there! Will be making it again...and again...and again.

Nice and moist meatloaf. However we didn't really care for the carrots. Tasted to much like carrots and not meatloaf. I omitted the salt and used Mccormick worcester pub burger seasoning though. That gave it nice flavor.

This is very similar to a recipe my grandmother gave me. Instead of ketchup, tomato sauce is mixed with the mustard and brown sugar for the topping, and it also called for the addition of herbs. I always use thyme because she did. It is excellent!!!

Didn’t use the carrots and used 2 lbs of hamburger. Really good. Very moist  the sauce you add to the top really adds flavor to the dish. I can hardly wait to make again. My Mom made the best meat loaf and this is just as good. Sorry Mom??

I followed the recipe only making a couple of changes as recommended in the reviews. Soaked the noodles in hot tap water instead of boiling them and added a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta. Everyone loved it and my mom said it tasted very authentic to Italian. I will definitely be making this again!

I used 1 lb lean ground beef and 1 lb lean ground Italian-seasoned pork and increased all the other meatloaf ingredients by 1/4 or 1/3 except for seasonings where I used 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper. I used about 3/4 cup chopped onion and left out the carrot, but I might put it (or zucchini) in next time. I added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp dill weed. I omitted the sauce topping entirely because my kids thought it sounded unappealing and baked for 90 mins. I served the meatloaf with homemade mashed potatoes and gravy and everyone loved it, the recipe is a keeper. (I was able to get about 1/2 cup juice from the meatloaf to use toward the gravy.)

It was very much like mine except for the cheese. I've done that topping for 20 yrs or so. that's what I think makes any meatloaf good. My husband didn't care for it because he doesn't like change. It was the cheese he didn't like . But the rest of us loved it. Good recipe

I used 1 pound ground beef and 1/2 pound ground pork. This produced a moist meatloaf (but a little more fat to skim off). I substituted 1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs for the bread slices and used sea salt. The two teaspoons of salt specified in the recipe made the meatloaf way too salty. I'll use one teaspoon next time. Overall, it was moist and nicely seasoned.

I haven't made meatloaf in about 20 years, and I've had a hankering lately for some comfort food as the days get colder. I made this (almost) exactly as the recipe called for. (I accidentally forgot the carrots.) It still turned out delicious and even my friend who swears that Worcestershire sauce is needed for any meatloaf gobbled it up without additional doctoring. Definitely would made again.

This **IS** The Best Meatloaf ever!! My significant other loved it, he mentioned it again this morning. That *rarely* happens! :)  This is so good, I had to write my first review.  I did cut salt content in half (we don't add much salt to anything), added two cloves garlic finely grated, didn't have ground mustard so used a tablespoon regular mustard, and used gluten free bread.  For the glaze, I changed to 2 tablespoons  brown sugar (to cut calories) and added 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce.  I am a huge ketchup eater, especially with meatloaf and this meatloaf didn't need any! Served with green beans, jasmine rice and beef gravy.  Can't wait for leftovers. This is soooo good, I would be honored to make and serve to company!

We'll definitely make this again because everything we always typically have on hand. We liked it but it need more sauce for our taste (maybe I will double the recipe next time)... I added a little diced jalapeno from the garden I had just picked, besides the onion and carrot. I also used my stand mixer to mix the ingredients and two tiny loaf pans - maybe that is why we felt it needed more sauce? Anyway, it was  YUMMMY delicious. Can't wait to make again with a chunkier cheese and more sauce!! Thanks for this easy one!!!

Super yummy.  Far exceeded my expectations.  Definitely my favorite meatloaf I've had.  Was even a hit with the kids.  Only thing I changed was making a second batch of the sauce and adding that to the top about 10-15 minutes before it was done.

I absolutely love meatloaf but could never make a good one. I gave up on it for years but decided it was time to try again. I came across this recipe after a few tries and will never need to look again. This is by far the best meatloaf I have ever eaten!!

This was the best meatloaf I've ever had. It was a big hit in my house! It was so good I didn't want to stop eating it! I did make some changes. Instead of using bread slices, I used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs. (I had plenty in the pantry and it was easier.) I also used a little garlic powder and onion powder in my milk/bread crumb mixture. I had to get rid of some half and half too, so I used that in place of milk to double my recipe. This is definitely a keeper.

This was really great. My teenage boys liked it and so did we. I didn't follow the directions in order and I wish I had. I added the egg and milk at the end and cut back on the milk because it seemed to mushy.  I also added a little bone broth because I wanted to use up what I had. I used 2 pounds of beef and added more of the rest of the ingredients. I put it in 2 loaf pans and cooked it for about 45-50 minutes which was fine.  I doubled the sauce because we like sauce and to save some for topping it. I also used about 2 cups of square bread dried bread crumbs.  I added some garlic powder and some fennel and italian seasoning because I read someone else did that. In the sauce I used organic coconut sugar because it's much better for you and also brown. I also substituted a little bit of healthy bbq sauce for some of the ketchup.  I usually make meatloaf from the recipe on the back of the french onion soup mix so this was a welcome change and better. There was a ton of liquid/grease in the pans when I took them out of oven so I drained it and added more sauce on top and put it in oven for a few more minutes on a higher temp.

My husband usually makes the meatloaf around here with his secret recipe.  He wasn't home this time so I had to come up with the recipe this time.  This one looked like it might be good and I was right.  Everyone loved it including my husband.  I omitted the bread crumbs as some people suggested and put in shredded zucchini instead of the carrots.  Hubby said I was in charge of meatloaf from now on!

I didn't give it 5 stars just because it's my first meat loaf and probably there are better recipes, but my family love it, it was a huge success and easy to prepare. Thumb up!

Made a few changes, used a leaner burger and added sage sauage, used wholewheat bread minus the crust, added almost a half of a bell pepper finely diced, reglazed it as the first glazed run off draining grease off. Outstanding. My wife said this is f' n good

Cook it outside on BBQ. Wrap in double-foil. Cook at 350 degrees, or until the internal temp. is at least 160 degrees.

> I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. 

> I didn't add cheese or carrots. 

> I added small diced green peppers. I added some sage, a little cinnamon, and a tsp of horseradish sauce.

The taste and texture were excellent. I added garlic powder.   My only complaint was the amount of salt used.  I will cut it by a third if not in half the next time I make it.  You can always add salt at the dinner table to any meal, but, too much salt cooked into a dish is usually not a mistake that can be remedied.  This recipe has too much salt!

This was very good. I am not much for meat loaf but it reminds me when I was a child so I have good memories. I followed the recipe except for a few changes. I had 1lb of organic pork grind meat and 1lb of organic ground beef so I mixed them  and I did not have old bread so I used panko. I did not use carrots and I forgot to use brown sugar with the ketchup,bbq sauce. I don't care for mustard but I did used a smaller amount. I don't measure anything I have been cooking for so many years that I just calculate according to my family taste.  My husband liked the meat loaf and thought it was very tasty my daughter loved it and took some to her house. This is a very good and tasty meatloaf. If you don't like a certain ingredient don't use it unless it's essential to the recipe . Do try it and enjoy it we did. Thanks Matt O., nice going.

So moist, I couldn’t believe it.  My only addition was sliced mushrooms & a full 2 lbs of ground meat.  The topping really added to the flavor, giving it just the right contrast.  Baked in 2 glass dishes for a total of 1 & 1/2 hrs.  Yummy!

This was one of the best meatloaves I ever made. I omitted the carrots because I have a picky eater and didn't have time to finely grate the carrots. I also omitted the cheese and it still came out very delicious. I doubled the sauce just because I like a lot of sauce.

Omg! This turned out MUCH better than I expected it would! Yum Yum! The only exceptions I made were to add finely chopped squash, zucchini and garlic to the mixture (a great way to “sneak” in veggies for my three year old-lol). This has become my go-to meatloaf recipe.  Next time I will try it with ground turkey.

I did not expect this to be so amazing. My 11 year old made it (he loves to cook) and he omitted the milk because of a whey allergy in the family (you can have cheddar with a whey allergy because it's casein, but not regular milk).  Again, this was just mind-blowingly good.

Sooooo good! I used 2 lbs of ground beef since I had to thaw out 2 lbs and didn't know what to do with the extra 1/2 lb. Turned out great. The cheese was such a good idea. The edges were caramelized and chewy and delicious! Kids all loved it. Best meatloaf I've ever had/made. Will definitely make again and again!

I make this with 2 lbs ground turkey and everything else the same, minus the carrots. It tastes better than meat. The one thing is it becomes loose from the milk/egg/bread mixture...Give it a dab or two with a paper towel when you pour it into the loaf pan. I also make 3X the glaze. After putting it on top of the meatloaf, I save the extra glaze for each slice I cut. It’s amazing!!

Wow this came out wonderfully. I didn't stick to the measurements so much, used a block of colby jack cheese instead of cheddar and didn't have any carrots. I'm excited to make this one again!!

Soooo good. Very versatile recipe.  Didnt have all the ingredients so used what I had.  No bread so used ground up corn biscuit cereal.  I also added some turkey sausage because I only had 1lb of ground beef.  Followed some reviews and sautéed the veggies before mixing with the ground meat. Additionally I only used 1 egg in the recipe and didn’t use the whole 2/3 milk as suggested by others to avoid getting a runny mixture.  Put in garlic, oregano, paprika, and 1/4 tsp beef bouillon.  It came out perfect and it didn’t fall apart.  I loved this recipe because it tasted meaty instead of the bready flavor I find a lot of recipes have.  Will definitely make again.

Most unusual meatloaf I've ever eaten. Delicious. 
I substituted bread crumbs for bread since since I had a box that was getting old.
2nd time I made burgers and stuffed peppers.  Added some noodles to the bottom of the peppers to soak up the juice. Not healthy but less messy.

Love, LOVE this recipe!!! My boys love it! It has even replaced the old beloved favorite - chicken enchiladas. I wouldn’t change one thing. I do use but I’m not sure it makes a difference, is good and hearty whole grain bread. Thanks for the recipe!

This was indeed moist, too much so for my taste in fact. My grandson liked it, granddaughter didn't. I'm not sure what I could have done differently, I used 96% lean ground beef and only 2 slices of bread, maybe more bread would have helped?

This is my favorite meatloaf. I was never been a fan of meatloaf until now, I have made this a dozen times and the family asks for it again. I make it as written, except sometimes I don’t have the carrots, but always tastes just as well. I make it into 6 mini meat loaves and cook at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, just for times sake!

Great tasting meatloaf! My wife says it's better that hers (it is!). The only change I made was to use 2 lbs of ground beef, so I upped the ingredients a bit.

I doubled this recipe and used 85/15 ground turkey, substituted the slices of bread with 1/2 cup bread crumbs per single batch. I also added Worcestershire sauce and dale's low sodium to the glaze giving it a more umami flavor. Overall a very good recipe base to build off of and very pleased with the final product

Left out carrots. Used 8oz of tomato sauce for topping instead of sweet topping. I used the everything bread from Wal-Mart deli for breadcrumbs.  Easy to make.

It’s okay, but not something I would make again. I followed the recipe exactly, however the cheese made the loaf too greasy and it fell apart easily. Would recommend leaving the cheese out for a better consistency. Too greasy.

Great meatloaf! I scaled this down to 4 servings and used one egg. I used a Mexican blend of cheeses that I had on hand, and also added a little garlic and onion powder, and about 1 tblsp of Worcestershire sauce. I shaped it into a loaf and placed in a foil-lined pan that I sprayed with cooking spray. I thought the cheese would be a prominent flavor, but it is not. The glaze topping is great, with a perfect amount - no waste. This was ready in exactly 1 hour. Easy to make and very moist. Thanks for the recipe, Matt!

Oh, baby, this really is the BEST meatloaf. Ever!! I made no significant changes to the recipe as far as seasonings and proportions. I did, however, use half lean ground pork in place of half of the ground beef. (We prefer many things this way -- meatloaf, spaghetti/lasagna sauces, etc..)
While I initially thought "Carrots?!?", I went ahead and put them in and they added to the overall wonderfulness of this tasty recipe. 
From this day forward, no other meatloaf will see the inside of my oven!
Next time I plan to use about half the amount of brown sugar in the glaze as it is a bit too sweet for us as is.  Purely a personal preference and, who knows, I may try it with less sugar and decide that more is better. My guess is that it will be fabulous either way. YUM!!!!

For veggies I used green pepper, yellow onion,  and carrots. For the bread crumbs I added steel cut oats with 2 slices of white bread because I was low on bread and I added some galic powder and salt and pepper to the bread crumb mix. For the sauce on top I added a little more brown sugar because we like it a little sweeter.

I didn't have carrots so had to leave them out, but this was the first time my family ever liked meatloaf.  I wasn't sure how they'd react to the glaze but it was a hit.

Very good flavor and texture for a change from traditional meatloaf.  Just be aware of cholesterol level due to meat and cheese.

I made the recipe as written, except I used 2lb of ground beef.  Very good.  I will replace this recipe with my recipe that I have used for years (this one is much healthier and even tastier).  I patted it all into a 9x13 pan and baked for about 40 minutes.  My family prefers it this way versus a loaf.

So good!!!  I followed the recipe exactly as written (except only had shredded Mexican cheddar cheese), and it turned out perfectly.  I've been making a different meatloaf recipe for 45 years, which my hubby loves. Occasionally, I'll try something new, but nothing else really captured any interest. Until this one - I like it so much better than my old recipe!  The cheese really added to the flavor, so it's not boring.

I will definitely make it again . In fact, I will be sharing this recipe with my mom today! I used one pound of ground beef so I used just one egg and reduced the other ingredients by a little bit and it came out just perfectly.  I used Progresso brand plain bread crumbs (1/3 cup for one slice of bread - I used 2/3 cup). It smelled so good while it was cooking. Delicious!

My family’s new favorite meatloaf recipe! Even my very, picky 12yr old enjoyed it. I will use this recipe from now on, but omit the topping. My boys prefer plain old tomato paste on top! Meatloaf was moist & flavorful.

Very good. I put in big cubes of cheese instead, so that nice little pockets of  cheese were throughout the loaf.  I didn't have carrot so I put in finely chopped green pepper.

have tried many meatloaf recipes over the years and this one is excellent. I followed directions doubled and only added sauce at end as some like this sauce and some like bbq sauce. Kids said this is their favorite meatloaf.

Best meatloaf I ever tasted!  I didn’t have any carrots so I left that out, and I added garlic powder, season salt, ketchup and honey to the meat when I mixed it up. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of sandwich bread. And I used sharp cheddar cheese. And I doubled the sauce to put on top so it would be totally covered.

This is the second time I have made this recipe.  It is without question the BEST meatloaf recipe I have ever tasted.  I did increase the shredded carrot to at least a cup as 1/2 a cup is just not enough. This will always be our family recipe for meat loaf!

I used two pounds of ground round, which was what I had. Following the advice of previous users, I used one jumbo egg instead of two large ones. (One and a quarter large eggs would be about the same.)  Cut the salt in half. 

Instead of a loaf pan, I made it into a free-form torpedo shape to bake in a 9"x13" pan for a full hour and a half. Although I usually hate mustard, the glaze on this was wonderful. I'll be making this again.

This was my first attempt at making my own meatloaf and I don't think I need to try any other recipes! Only thing I changed was to use 3/4 cup breadcrumbs instead of the crumbled bread slices, since I didn't have bread. Took closer to 1.5 hours to be done but the result was so yummy and moist. My husband and 3 year old gobbled this up. (The 3 year old actually asked for seconds before she touched anything else on her plate!) A must-try recipe for sure!

I haven't made meat loaf in years and tried this out last weekend.  We even had three guests for dinner.  It was simply marvelous!!!Truly, my mom used to put a topping of ketchup and karo syrup on meat loaf and this tasted similar.  Company worthy.  I baked it on my broiler pan rack with the pan lined with foil underneath.  This way, the fat drains right off the loaf as it cooks.  Will definitely make it again!

Very Yummy, will definitely make again. I used bread crumbs instead of bread is the only thing I changed.

I didn’t make any changes and I will make it again.  I will add a little more ketchup to the sauce and apply it a few minutes before it’s done.  To give it more of a mouth watering rich glazed appearance. My husband really enjoyed it!

This was outstanding! The flavor is superb! One thing to note, my meatloaf did come out oily/fatty, so I had to pour out it out because the meatloaf was pooling in it. And for some reason the structure of the meatloaf was somewhat crumbly, so I wasn't able to get a nice meatloaf slice. Personally, I don't really care about the aesthetics of it, because the taste made up for it. I didn't have yellow mustard on hand, also I don't like mustard, so I omitted it from the recipe and it still turned out fantastic.

I didn't use a whole onion, maybe about half of one.  I also didn't use carrots, but may later.  I used elk burger for this meatloaf, and I will just say that it was moist, and VERY tasty.  I love the sweet spread over top of the mixture. yum!

I made this exactly as written.  The meatloaf itself was okay, but I thought it could use some seasoning.  We did not like the glaze...we just didn't like the sweetness.

This is my late mother in laws recipe except she used Parm instead of cheddar. I definitely prefer cheddar for this meatloaf. I agree that the glaze is much better than ketchup

Made 2 loaf pans.  Sub'd oatmeal for bread crumbs so it was essentially gluten free.  Family loved it.  Fed 5 adults, 4 children people one meal with leftovers for about 4 for another meal.  Made 1 week ahead, froze, thawed in the fridge, took about 90 minutes @ 375 to cook.  The glaze was great, might use this on other recipes.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe. I added in a little garlic powder and sazon and Adobo. It came out so juicy and tender. The glaze on top was perfect.This was my first time  making meatloaf and it was a hit.

Really tasty. I substituted bread crumbs and didn’t use enough so drained a bit of liquid from pan but then it was perfect. My picky eater son even liked it. Will definitely make again and again.

This was a fantastic recipe! I added a couple extra ingredients such as 1 cup of spinach (finely diced), 1 1/2 tsp garlic (finely diced), 1/4 tsp Cajun seasoning, and instead of bread I used 1 cup of Stove Top Turkey stuffing. 

For the glaze I mixed ketchup and English mustard and a little bit of brown sugar.  

IT WAS AMAZING!

This is an excellent recipe! The only change I made was I doubled the sauce recipe. I used half as directed on top of the loaf before putting it in the oven. At an hour of cooking, I pulled out the meatloaf, drained out the excess grease, then I flipped it on a baking sheet lined  with parchment paper. I then drizzled the rest of the sauce on top and put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes. Et voila!  (Thanks to this tip from another reviewer! I highly recommend doing this!)

I feel like everyone has a meatloaf story as to why they don't like it. I'm no different. Most are bland, dry, or just plain nasty. THIS recipe is true to its name and is now going to be a part of our regular meal planning regimen. The only thing is like to change is to figure out how to bake it where the grease doesn't settle to the bottom of the pan. Leaner meat maybe. Or using a cooling rack, which I've done before but have had issues cutting the meatloaf without it falling through the holes.

Loved this recipe!!! So did my husband, son, and cousins! My husbands cousin actually said it was the best heat had! I followed exactly except I added a teaspoon and a half of garlic powder, and a couple dashes onion powder! I also accidentally mixed the brown sugar and ketchup right into the meat loaf instead if making a glaze (because I didn’t read far enough ahead), but it turned out delicious!!

The really is best ever meat loaf.  We loved it.
There are only two of us so we had a lot left over.   We made meatloaf sandwhiches and I ate a bowl of it warmed up for lunch.  So so so good.

The consistency of the meatloaf was excellent; however the cheddar cheese was overwhelming. It probably would be better with a milder cheese or if you wanted a little heat, use pepper jack. Otherwise and excellent meatloaf.

AMAZING! Was a hit with the entire family.  Even my super picky kids.
You don't taste the cheese but it gave it a good texture.  I was thinking it was going to be cheesy but it wasn't at all.
My oldest said to never make any other meatloaf again.  This is the one.
I'm the only one that likes mustard so I only did half of what it called for.  It was perfect!

The only change I made was upping the beef to 2 pounds. Otherwise I made it as prescribed and the family loved it.  It truly is the best meat loaf I've ever had.  I only gave it 4 stars because I feel like it needs a little something else.  I'll play around with this recipe and if I ever discover that something else, I'll share it with you all.

This was delicious!  The glaze was a bit sweet for my liking, so I will reduce the brown sugar next time.  Also, I didn't use lean ground beef, so the fats built up in the pan when the meatloaf cooked.  Next time I'll use leaner ground beef OR cook it in a pan that allows drainage.  I'll be making it again!

Fantastic! Doubled the recipe - with the exception of milk & egg (because of other reviewers comments) and glaze ingredients. I also added a bit of garlic powder and used bread crumbs (about 1 1/2 cups) instead of crackers. Omitted carrots & cheese out of personal preference. The glaze mix as written was enough for a doubled recipe. It made three mini loaves which will be enough for leftovers! :D Cooked in an hour, which is faster than the stated cook time. The only other change I made was to add the glaze (on top, instead of the bottom) for the last 15 mins. of the 1 hour cook time. It was delicious & plenty moist even with the milk & egg halved.

This turned out very good. Followed directions almost to a tee! When I mixed the ingredients...I added the topping into the meatloaf. Wow....most excellent. I had to make more topping. Not salty at all. Someone needs to follow instructions better than me if there's was salty.

I didn’t have carrots on hand so that is the only thing I didn’t put in. This was hands down the best tasting, super moist and family favorite. My husband even said it’s now one his top favorite things I’ve made! Been married for 17 years! That’s saying something!!

My parents LOVE this.  Its great for  people needing a soft diet,  its easy to make or to freeze for making later.  The sauce is the bomb.  I usually pump up the sauce with double the spicy mustard and ketchup.

One of the best meatloafs I have tried in a long time. The loaf was soft and airy. Too many times meatloaf is too dense. This was perfect. I added a little bit of my favorite medium salsa to the mix as well and it was great.

Great recipe that's easy to make, wasnt sure about the 3 pieces of break and cheddar, but man the ratio that's used is spot on! The glaze is amazing but make sure you use a lean hamburger or it may ooze that perfect topping right off. I did leave out the carrots, I dont get it, left out onions only because of the wife. Great flavor.

Absolutely Delicious! I followed the directions exactly, except did not add carrots. I also left some room around the meatloaf for the grease to collect, rather that piling on top of the meatloaf. It took 1 hour to bake. Amazing!

This meatloaf was excellent.   Since we don't keep white bread around, I used 1 cup of Italian Bread crumbs instead.   I also added some shredded green bell pepper.   Definitely a keeper recipe!

Good meatloaf. Added mushrooms, cooked it on the grill (in the pan) because it’s too hot in TX in August to heat the oven. Turned out great!

Grreat recipe.  Two ingredient changes for me were used jar tomato sauce instead of ketchup (just to get rid of it) and used mozzarella instead of cheddar (that's all I had).  Couldn't believe how good this turned out...wife wants me to cook more now.

I've made this meatloaf three times, and each time it was great. Used my Kitchenaid to mix the ingredients last time, but I think it's better to mix by hand.

I made this and against my better judgment I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great, my wife said it was the best meatloaf she has ever had. Personally I will add some hatch chili’s next time just because I like it a bit spicier. Worth a try folks.

I have been making this since my adult children were young. 
It’s awesome, moist & tasty! 
Plus I amend to wheat free bread & almond milk, & it’s still great!

Best ever and I'm 72.  I accidentally included the brown sugar in the meat mixture .  Instead of bread, I used Italian Panko.  Then added a little more carrots (didn't want to keep just a few), plus we love onions and added 1/2 more onion.  I had a spicy sugar mustard and added it with the ketchup.  
I was so impressed with this recipe that it will be around for many years.  thank you.

Used the general recipe as a base after comparing other meatloaf recipes. 

Removed the cheese and carrots. Used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crumbling bread by hand, 3 cups.

Added a good helping of Worcestershire to the sauce and used a heaping 1/4 cup of brown sugar to heighten the flavor. Also incorporated a batch of the sauce without the brown sugar, ie: Worcestershire, ketchup and mustard, into the meatloaf while mixing to give it a great flavor. 

Didn't have any left overs. :)

I didn't have carrots or onions so i added chopped potatoes instead and a package of onion soup mix. This was a HUGE hit. I've made it several times now.

OMG!  The best meatloaf ever is a great name for this recipe.  The only different thing I did was to finely chop the carrot and added some finely chopped green pepper and some celery.  My husband said I could make hamburger patties with this recipe and he would eat it.  Good job!  My go to meatloaf recipe.  Thank You for posting.  Update:  Because of the cheese and brown sugar, I suggest you free form the meatloaf on a non-stick tinfoil on a baking sheet to save on clean-up.  Its still my favorite meatloaf.

Great recipe!! Cooked half of a diced onion before stirring it in. Took 1 hour and 25 minutes to cook all the way through. Then drained the juices. Also made another batch of the glaze for people to use because it runs off while cooking. Love the taste!!

I don’t really care for meatloaf, but my husband really likes it. We both agree this is the BEST meatloaf ever! I make this often, and recommend it to everyone. I do change it up sometimes such as adding liquid smoke to the sauce. This is a WINNER for us.

I made this meatloaf & it was delicious.  I had a piece & then I sliced it up and put it in the freezer,  individually wrapped.
When I wanted it for dinner I just took what I needed & broke the piece up & fried it with onions.  Fantastic!  It’s so moist & the flavor is great!
It was the best I’ve ever made.  I will  definitely make this again.

I've been making this type of Meatloaf recipe for 20yrs. My family loves it. It's moist and flavorful. It works well both hot out of oven or the next day cold in a sandwich. I do add some Worcestershire, a dash of cayenne pepper and garlic to the egg mixture, and my family prefers additional grated cheese on top rather than the ketchup mixture.

I followed the recipe as written and my family all agreed that it was pretty boring and tasteless.  It did not hold together as meatloaf should, which I suspected while mixing it; it was just too loose.  I could make drastic changes to make it work but I think it would be smarter to just keep looking for a great recipe.

My family loved this meatloaf.  I  substituted my home made barbecue sauce, 1/2 cup for the catsup.  It is a soft meatloaf and I prefer a cruchy exterior but as stated above, my family loved it!

This was one of the very best meatloafs I have made. The cooking time was way off because I guess I used a corningware meatloaf pan rather than a metal one. The flavor was great. The only change I made was the addition of about a cup of panko bread crumbs because I made it with more ground beef than the recipe called for.

We really loved this meatloaf recipe. I usually use bread crumbs and I'm not sure if using bread made the difference, but it was really good. This is my new go to recipe for meatloaf!

This really is the best meatloaf ever! I have tried several recipes over the years, but this one was perfect. It was even better the next day, slices fried in a skillet and placed between two pieces of bread. MmmMmmm!

I have been making this meatloaf using the exact same recipe since the  early 1970's. Tried and true recipes last a lifetime.

A really great easy to make meatloaf. Any recipe that I use ,I do not add salt,but everything else is fine to use in the recipes . When I went to cook school back in the day,that is one item that you do not cook with to feed the public or who ever it may be. That is what a salt shaker on the table is all about.

Mine turned out running. I even kept it in the oven for twi hours but still not like a loaf. The only alteration I made in recipe was using mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and also my ground beef was only 70% lean so that might be the issue. Should have used less sugar for the sauce knowing that I’m not a big fan of sweetness in food. But it still tastes good and easy to make.

While it certainly smelled good cooking, I found the end result disappointing. It was very salty, lacked in flavour and the sauce on the top didn't add much to the overall dish. I wouldn't make this again.

First time making meatloaf and I was incredibly happy with how this turned out. The only change I would make is to make extra of the topping sauce...mostly because I made individual meatloaves in ramekins and I would have like to have a bit more sauce for each one. Adding this into a monthly rotation!

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   This recipe was a “10” in my family.  Everyone simply enjoyed this dish and a lucky few were able to get “seconds.”  Which means the next time I make it I will double the ingredients.  This dish will definitely be in the monthly family rotation of meals in the future.

I cooked it for 75 minutes and drained it a bit when it was finished.

I finally made a meatloaf that my wife said was better than hers. The taste was excellent both hot out of the oven and cold in a sandwich. The only change that I made was to add an envelope of onion soup mix and left out the salt.

Didn’t change a thing, and will definitely make again! Loved the crispness of the edges and the cheese made it sooo good! The only drawback was I had to cook quite a bit longer than what the directions said.

We all loved it.   I did add a little garlic to the onion mixture.  Also sautéed the carrots with onion.   Topping is great too.  Had a house guest who went back for thirds.  Not all that much left!   I give it 5 stars for sure.

When I came across the recipe, I thought the title was hyperbole, but, wow, this was indeed the "best ever" meatloaf I've ever tasted.  I made a quadruple recipe to serve at a homeless shelter and wanted to use up ground meat that had been sitting in my freezer for more than a year -- so my expectations were low.  I only made a few changes based mostly on what I had on hand: I used a pound of ground pork sausage to go along with four pounds of ground beef, and I added a sleeve of buttery round crackers to supplement what I had left of a loaf of bread.  I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the meat mixture and a quarter cup of cider vinegar to the sauce.  I borrowed the hint in comments of putting the giant loaf on a roasting rack covered with foil in a jelly-roll pan, and I covered the loaf with strips of bacon and a little of the sauce.  I put the rest of the sauce in a saucepan and warmed it while the meatloaf baked -- for about two hours, as it happened and dribbled it over the meatloaf after slicing.  The results were spectacular!  Even my ultra-picky middle child who sniffs and microscopically examines his food raved about it.  Hard to believe it was made with meat passed its prime.  And the guys at the shelter were very appreciative.  Will definitely make this again and again!

We followed the recipe exactly as written. If we make it again, we will probably leave out the carrots as their flavor seemed to overpower the rest of the meatloaf. Aside from the carrots, it also seemed a little bland.

Good recipe.  All enjoyed!  No changes to the making of the meatloaf.  Only changed what it was cooked in to an 11” x 9” glass baking pan. It took about 60 minutes to bake. The topping was doubled to cover the top.

I have made this twice now, and used 2 lbs lean ground beef and increased the other ingredients a bit just to compensate for the extra beef.  Both times got rave reviews! I did make a few changes. I used half Monterey Jack cheese and half mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar, just a personal preference. I also add a dash or two of A-1 sauce to the beef, and a dash of liquid smoke, and about two teaspoons of a Chicago style steak seasoning. Instead of crumbling bread, I use Italian style bread crumbs and just eyeballed it.  Because of the increased volume, I also added 5-10 minutes to the cooking time. I’ll tell you, I never liked meatloaf, ever, but this stuff is fantastic! My entire family loves it!

I added grated Parmesan and Romano cheese  to the bread crumbs along with dried Parsley, Rosemary and Sage. Did not use Cheddar cheese. Also chopped some Roasted Red Peppers & Garlic along with the Carrots and Onions. I used mixed Ground Pork and Beef. Very good Meatloaf. Had Mashed Potatoes with it. Great recipe!

I used gluten-free bread and baked it on a rack in a roasting pan. It held together perfectly and tasted great!!  The glaze tastes a bit like BBQ sauce, and I'm glad that I chose to use it instead of straight ketchup. One hour baking time is substantially short, though. It definitely need 1.5 hours. Next time I may bake at 375° to see if it will cut the time a bit without sacrificing moistness.

Excellent meatloaf! Turned out very moist but crusted on top. My other times of making meatloaf I have laid 2 pieces of raw bacon over the top  for extra flavor.

Followed this recipe to a tee and I am now almost 2 hours in and the middle is still pink. After the first hour and a half I turned the heat up to 400 and it is still not done after 2 hrs.

Very good! Husband loved the cheddar cheese in the meatloaf.  I recommend putting the sugar, ketchup, mustard topping on during the last 15-20 minutes of baking, so that it doesn't burn. Also, for whatever reason, I always serve with my homemade scalloped potatoes and green beans. Thanks for this recipe.

Although I did make some changes to make it more compliant with my dietary needs,  I basically followed the recipe. As one person mentioned, I used only 1 pound of beef.  I used 3 slices of GF bread; coconut milk and I used only 1/2 cup of cheese. For the glaze, I used maple sugar (instead of brown sugar) and unsweetened ketchup. It was a big hit with myself and my husband. It is a keeper.

I made it exactly as written. It came out delicious.  It needed an extra 20 mins or so and a pan underneath (grease dripped out of pan).  I think the amount of sauce on top was just right... some reviewers said to make more, I'm glad I didn't because more would over power the meatloaf. It is perfect the way it is. Easy to put together, too. I'll make it again.

This was the best meatloaf so far. We didn't have carrots but did the rest. The bread vs breadcrumbs takes more work but so worth it. And the cheese gave it great flavor. Only complaint is it was way too salty. Will use half next time.

Looking at the ingredients I thought this would be bland but it was delicious.  My husband especially liked the sauce on top, I thought it was way too sweet so. Only tweak was I used 1 C of Italian bread crumbs. Did need the entire bake time to get to 160 degrees. Yum.

I can't have gluten or red meat, so I substituted the ground beef with ground turkey and the bread with a gluten free bread. Even with those modifications, it was still delicious. The whole family has a new favorite dish!

This is the first meat loaf I have ever made. I followed the recipe, no changes.  Meatloaf was done in 1 hr & 15 min.
It was excellent and I will be making it again.  Thanks for

I added a little pork sausage and chopped sweet peppers.  This was the first time I ever made meatloaf.  My husband LOVED it.  He said it was the best he'd ever had.

I made this recipe using about 4 pounds of minced meat. So, I doubled the recipe in everything but I used about 1 1/2 cups of grated carrot and a little extra cheese. Seasoning the meat before hand with onion, chive and pimento peppers gave the meat a delicious flavour. (I seasoned the meat the day before.) As the ingredients were somewhat dense, I baked the loaf longer and used a meat thermometer to check for readiness. The loaf was moist and very tasty. This will become my "go to" recipe......DELICIOUS and so easy.

I followed the sauce recipe and it's the first time I've eaten the sauce on a meatloaf. Usually I scrape it off or leave a section without any for myself. It was so good! I'll definitely make this again. For those of you curious about my changes, most were due to not having exactly everything on hand. I only had one egg left, I used a sleeve of saltine crackers instead of bread (I don't like bread in meatloaf), I didn't have carrots, I used frozen onions, probably only a quarter cup, if that, I don't like onions either and the only mustard I had was Dijon. my 4 year old is chowing down and even thanked me for making dinner. yes!

This recipe is very similar to the one I have used for years, there are two additions to my original recipe. Those two ingredients made a world of difference, this meat loaf is delicious!

I have been making meat loaf all wrong for so many years!!!   This is the best meatloaf I have ever made.   I didn't use salt as suggested.  I would also probably make two loafs since my family probably could have licked the loaf pan if I let them!   Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great-tasting meatloaf, but the ketchup-mustard-brown sugar topping ended up being a bit strong for me.  It tastes great, though.  I added chopped, fresh mushrooms that I pre-cooked.  It would've been nice if the recipe used a measurement for the onion, since sizes vary so much and consequently, I would've used a bit less.  I would make it again, but adjust slightly.

This meatloaf was a big hit with my family. I think some of them would've given it 5 stars, but the person I asked does not like cooked carrots. I thought they might disappear with baking since they're shredded, but they stand out and even give some nice color to the meatloaf. It makes a nice size loaf, even though, like most meatloaves, it shrinks during cooking. Even though the cooking time is a little long, I would definitely make it again.

This was great! I omitted the cheese and used 85% lean ground turkey instead of ground beef because they were out of ground beef at the store. I also used ground mustard instead of yellow mustard. Delicious!

Fantastic and VERY easy to make...  followed the recipe, and only added a few cloves of garlic.  Was a great feel-good dinner!  Served it with spiralized potatoes that were covered in oil and Montreal Vegetable spice, then baked.

I don't understand rating a recipe if you change it. People if you change it then it's no longer this recipe. Honestly if you change it then don't rate it just to see your own comment.  Personally I loved this.  It was excellent. I made it BY THE RECIPE and it was fantastic.

This was a flop.  I don't know if mixing the cheese made it come out like a casserole or I did something else wrong.  We ate it as a casserole instead of slices.  I'll try a different recipe next time

Excellent. I messed up and put the ingredients for the glaze in the recipe, so had to make the glaze as well, but we really liked it.

We LOVED it! Spoken as someone who has never liked meatloaf.   I happened to buy the beef/pork/veal blend of meatloaf meat. My cheese was extra sharp cheddar and my bread was leftover stale pita. I will make again when we have the whole family over. Proud to serve it. Thanks, Matt O!

I make this often and it is delicious. Sometime I make it with ground turkey, sometimes with ground beef and it's great either way. I skip the onions and use a third of the salt. I also add a spoonful of cottage cheese.

I've made this recipe several times and the family LOVES it! Because I don't like the texture of chopped veggies in meatloaf, I always pulse them a few times in the food processor so they are extra fine. I also substitute Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Dressing mix for the bread crumbs. It gives it a little extra something. 

The sauce is what's really special about this recipe! I always have to make extra because the family likes putting some on each individual slice. This stuff is delicious!

Easy to make and my meatloaf lovers loved it:)  Yummy glaze-I used half ketchup and half rib sauce.  Also used  GF panko  It was delicious.   This will become a regular in our house.  Next I'll make mini's and see how it freezes for those nites I'm not around:)  Thanks!

To salty. Be careful on the cheese you select. I used Kraft shredded cheddar and the taste was great but no one wanted more then one slice as it was way to salty. I would omit the adding salt into the recipe and salt to taste. A solid recipe for the taste!

For the first time EVER, I followed a recipe 100% as written. Mostly because, I had all the required ingredients on hand. I didn't feel like going to the supermarket  For meat dishes, I like to add things I didn't have, e.g., garlic, Worcestershire  sauce and/or more. No need this time. This is a perfect simple recipe for perfect meatloaf that can be customized.

Note: It may sound like too much salt but it really isn't. Adjust to personal taste if necessary, though. I didn't.

Love love love this meatloaf . I never mess with a recipe when I make it for the first time. It to me is disrespectful to the person that shared it. 
With that said and we live in high altitude I would add one more slice of bread. It was not as firm as I like a meatloaf as I prefer. Oh so yummy though. 
A true delight on a classic

Everyone loved it from what I understand. I wasn't home to share, I made it for the family while I was gone. My husband thought it was  in fact the best. My daughter thought it had too much onion (I used half an onion), and the sauce was too sweet.

Prep time took me long.  I had to shred my cheese and dice carrots.  We ate it soon as it came out so it was a little crumbly.  Bit everyone loved the taste and after standing for 8~10 minutes it held together fine.  Would definitely make again

I made this last night and I so agree it's the BEST!  My daughter and I ate the whole meat loaf yesterday...and wanted to make another one...it's that good!  Funny thing, I never liked 
meatloaf until now!
I made a couple changes...
I didn't add carrots and instead of ketchup I used Ragu,  I also added 1/4 cup ragu into the meat mixture.

I would highly recommend this meat loaf recipe. My husband is not a meat loaf fan, he told me this was the best he has had. Only change I made was reducing the salt to 1 1/2 tsp.

This is really a decent meatloaf. Usually the problem with most meatloaf is the texture either too dry or too wet and gloopy; and they usually come out bland it seems regardless of how much flavor you try and put in. This meatloaf was by far the most flavorful I've made and the texture was spot on, but could use a little more doctoring up. I omitted the carrots, I just don't think carrots belong in meatloaf. I also added a minced garlic clove and fresh parsley, I think the parsley made a huge difference! I also upped the pepper, as S&P is usually a 2:1 ratio. The sauce/glaze is DELICIOUS. I will definitely make this again. Very good base recipe to tailor to your personal taste.

Extremely moist meatloaf with good flavor. I may let carrots dry a bit after shredding, or reduce milk. Mixture was very wet. I would also like a bit more sauce...next time I would make it in a wider pan so each piece has more glaze.

Excellent meatloaf!!  I have used cheddar cheese and my family and friends love it.  I also use only Spanish onions, grey poupon.  I use Italian bread crumbs as well.  When I made this recipe I used 2 lbs of ground round.  It was very delicious!

This is my family's favorite meatloaf recipe. I make double the sauce. I also always use panko bread crumbs, and Dijon mustard because that's what I always have on hand. The kids love packing this for lunch the next day.

This meatloaf recipe is FANTASTIC!  I don't even really like meatloaf, and I wish I would have doubled this recipe for leftovers.  The only change I made was to shred 1 carrot and add 1 small shredded zucchini.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T.  I will definitely be making it again...sooner than later!

Family loved it. I also made a gravy with the juices from the pan. Great on the mashed potatoes I made with it. Oh the only change I made was adding a tsp of basil as I was afraid it would be too bland for our taste buds.

I've made some pretty good meatloaves. This is one of the best!  I did use my mother's technique of using oatmeal instead of bread.  It turned out delicious.  I've stuffed meatloaf with cheese before but never made it part of the mix.  Was it that or the carrots that made it so moist?  Loved it!

I've winged meatloaf, done all kinds of recipes and they've all been good but not great and I usually never make it again. this is absolutely the best I've made. I will cut the salt back a little I thought it was a little bit salty. but I didn't see any body else say anything about it so maybe I made a mistake. two things I want to try next with this is put some vinegar in the glaze to give it some zing and I want to double the sauce and put half in the meat loaf. thank you for sharing this recipe

This is a very good recipe! I've had a lot of meatloaf, but never one so moist and flavourful. Less really is more with this one, as I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic. The whole family loved it!!

I cut the amount of onion in half. It was alright. I think I might fry the onion before I add it to the recipe next time.

It was great with no changes. I used purchased shredded carrots but next time will grate my own for a better texture. Probably will skip the topping in the future as it was too sweet for our taste.

OUTSTANDING and easy.   It took far longer to cook to reach 160 at 350 - took 1:45 min.   I think I would push oven up to 375 or 400 to keep under the hour.

Changes:  Remember this fills almost full a 9x5 loaf pan so iff you add too much then plan for it.  I note same recipe listed as BEML two - adding green pepper which I would do.  This meat loaf is great and you could add a host of vegetables - next time I will add sliced mushrooms, sliced water chestnuts and maybe even chick peas.

My family, the kids anyway, are not big fans of meatloaf but my husband and I are and had been craving some for a while. I'm glad I found this recipe and used it instead of the classic recipe I have at home. We all enjoyed it. I followed the recipe as is but made a little more sauce to go on top since I was using a casserole dish instead of a loaf pan. I ended up scraping the sauce off of my piece, a little too sweet for my own taste but everyone else loved it. The meat mixture was moist and not dry but held together well. I used the shredder attachment on my food processor to shred the carrots, onion and cheese, this made prep time quick and easy. I toasted the bread for a a minute or so to make crumbling easy too. This recipe is a keeper for my family.

This was an amazing recipe for picky eaters! You can leave out the onions and carrots if you like for a smoother texture. This was the first meatloaf my husband enjoyed! We used ground turkey and it was AMAZING! I also used 1 cup of store bought bread crumbs vs the 3 pieces of bread. This made for a perfectly smooth texture. YUM!

I have made this 3 times now, as written. Wonderful meatloaf. Very moist and delicious. My only criticism would be that it's so moist that it does not hold together the best for left over meatloaf sandwiches. I thought about adding more bread or meat to make it sturdier, but really it tastes so good the way it is, who cares if it is a bit crumbly?!?!

A great meatloaf !  Very moist & tender.  Reduced the liquids by half and the loaf just held together, so may reduce more next time. I prefer a little more flavour, so I will use BBQ sauce intead of ketchup  and add more spices. Definetly a keeper!

My husband does not like meatloaf so I never make it.  But after my daughter told me he would like this one I gave it a try.  Well I will be making meatloaf more often as he gave it a thumbs up.  I love meatloaf anyway but this was the best.

I just happened to have everything in the house to make this meatloaf. Very easy and came out very good. I used a ground veal, beef, pork mix. I usually don't put milk and cheese in my meatloaf but you couldn't really tell. My husband like it a lot. Kids wouldn't eat it but so what else is new? I would make it again. I can't say it was awesome because it's meatloaf. Never really had a meatloaf that rated awesome to me!

Added another slice of bread to firm it up a bit. Outside of that, it's a perfect recipe. Kids devoured it.

It was good but not amazing to me. The mustard was very noticeable which I didn't care for. Definitely not the traditional loaf I'm used to.

I scaled this one up to 2 lbs of meat (what I had thawed).  It was absolutely delicious and the texture was wonderful.  I  made two small changes.  First, I pre-cooked the veggies in a skillet over medium heat until very soft and slightly browned.  Second, instead of using a loaf pan, I made a free-form loaf on top of my broiler pan, so the grease drained off.  The family loved it - the leftovers were gone within a day.  Will definitely make again.

Note:  I made it last night using 1 lb of ground bison and 1/2 lb of hamburger.  Fantastic!

I loved this meatloaf.  I did add 1 can of mushrooms, garlic powder and some dried parsley. I added seasoned panko bread crumbs in place of 1 of the bread slices.  I eliminated the brown sugar, don't like sweet on meat .  I will make this my favorite meatloaf!

My family LOVES this meatloaf. I have made this 2 or 3 times. My husband never liked meatloaf, but I didn't know this when I made this the first time. He raved how great it was and told me he never liked meatloaf until this. My niece loved it too. I went to visit family and made this for them as well. They also absolutely love it.

Even after I botched this recipe (browned the ground venison w/o thinking) it still tasted great! Husband loved it and said his coworkers were trying to mooch off him. Will definitely make again.

The flavor was excellent, the texture not so much.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but it came out mushy.  I cooked it to 180 degrees internal, but it had no body.

OHMYDEARLORD this meatloaf is beyond amazing.  This was my first time ever making a meatloaf, and it was so -incredibly- easy, I couldn't believe it. It was so good, I had to invite over the rest of my family to show it off, that's how good it was. My family went nuts for it! Next time, they told me to make it 7x so everyone could have their own meatloaf at supper time XD

I tweaked the recipe a little:  I used 1/2 cup of store bought bread crumbs, added, added 1/2 pound of spicy pork sausage to give it a little kick, and just covered the top with BBQ sauce instead of what the recipe calls for.  I also covered my baking pan with tin foil so the meat doesn't stick to the pan.  It turned out great and my family enjoyed it!

I've made this a few times now and it's a huge hit in my house!  Even my husband, who usually only eats chicken, loves all the flavor that this meatloaf has.  The sauce is so delicious but there's really good flavor all throughout the meat.  This has become a family staple. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Instead of 1 1/2# ground beef! I use 1# of ground beef and 1# of ground pork, it makes it a bit meatier but still very good.  I take out the cheese.  I also add a clove of garlic and about 1/2 tsp of marjoram and 1/2 tsp of celery seed for added flavor.  As originally written, this is a great recipe!

This meatloaf is amazing (never thought I'd say those words)! Not too sweet as some can be and very moist and flavorful! My husband loves meatloaf and now I do too! He is a big game hunter and we have half an elk in our deep freeze and he just got a huge oryx... So I needed recipes that uses a lot of ground lean dark meat and this is the best. The cheese adds the necessary fat and moisture to our game meat and everyone I've made if for loves it and my mom has asked for the recipe. I make mashed potatoes for a side- no need for gravy - it pairs very well with the meatloaf!

Since I tried this recipe two weeks ago, I've made it 4 times as it has fast become a favourite in my house!  Very easy to make, tastes amazing and there is never a shred of leftover left in the fridge.  This is a definite keeper!  Oh, and guess what's in the oven right this very minute!  Yes, meatloaf  #5!

My husband and son liked it and gave it the 4 stars. I would have given it 3. The onion in it was crunchy instead of soft and cooked. The glaze was overly sweet and none of us liked it. We couldn't even taste the cheese even though I used a sharp cheddar! I won't be making this one again.

Love the recipe! I substituted bread crumbs for the bread and used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar (it was what I had on hand). The meat loaf was moist and the sauce just gave it the right amount of sweetness. My family really enjoyed this recipe and they are a hard crowd to please.

I did not find this all that flavorful. Had to add ketchup to the finished product for additional flavor. Have made much better meatloaf from this site.

I made this recipe exactly as directions, it was amazing!! I cooked it for 1 hour on top of a cookie sheet to catch any spillover as the loaf pan was filled to the top ( I definitely saved myself some oven cleaning time by doing this).
As I wasn't having till the next day I covered & refrigerated till I was ready to finish cooking.  The next day I cooked for an additional 40 minutes (aprox.) at 325 (my oven tends to cook on low side) , then let stand 15 minutes before slicing. This was the 1st of many meatloaf recipes I've cooked & the only 1 that wasn't over or under cooked & sliced perfectly!! I did spray loaf pan with cooking spray prior to filling.
I've been using this website for at least 5 years & have never left a review , I cannot recommend this recipe enough! Thank you to original poster!

I liked the recipe, it was certainly different from the meat loaf I'm accustom to fixing(which is every Blue Moon).  However, I think I would make this one much more often.  It was quite easy and my hands were much cleaner.  I didn't use any salt, however I feel like something was missing as far as seasoning.  In the future I will try some other spices to jazz it up a bit. I can say there were no leftovers! Thanks for sharing.

This is my go to meatloaf recipe - moist and flavorful.  I leave off the glaze or put it on half because some of my family doesn't like the sweet tanginess; we usually make gravy (for the sauce), mash potatoes, and of course a veggies for a side.  We also think less onion is better too.

Made it with boyfriend since he never tried meatloaf and he liked it. Really sweet though. We used half bbq sauce and ketchup. Both sauces are already sweet enough so use less sugar if you don't want it too sweet.

This was awesome! My boyfriend said it was the best meatloaf he had ever had! The only things I changed were I didn't add carrots (because I don't like them) and I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire to the glaze. I also had to use a 10x10 pan because I didn't have a loaf pan.

It was just ok.  I feel like the cheese was just wasted calories as it did not add to the flavor of the meat loaf and I do not think I'm a fan of adding ketchup and mustard in meat loaf.  It wasn't bad, but I'll stick to my way of making meat loaf.

I have made this in a 24 serving size batch, but changed a few small details.  I think overall they improved it, but you could try and be the judge.

Substituted oats in for bread.  I find they soak up and keep flavour better and keep the meatloaf firm but fair.  

Removed cheese.  Removed Carrots.

Added fresh diced garlic, for my serving size a whole head. 

Cut back three eggs from the prescribed seven at this serving count.

A very small dash of dill into the mix.

For the sauce:

Subbed half the volume of ketchup with BBQ sauce.  

Mind: blown.

I followed the basic recipe but added 1/4 cup of mushrooms I pulsed to very small bits, added 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground garlic, and made two shallow meatloaf pans done in one hour. Put the sauce on it before putting in oven,  but I added more ketchup 2/3 cup more and 1 more teaspoon mustard( really I doubled recipe but I would cut it back to what I listed because  it was too sweet), I used fancy shredded cheddar cheese, you could not tell cheese was in there at all( might use a bigger grate of cheese next time- plus I substituted 1 cup of panko bread crumbs -because thats what i had-in milk mixture! What a hit! My family asked for leftovers to go!

This is a moist and delicious recipe. I use 1 lb beef and 1/2 lb ground pork, and bread crumbs instead of bread. It's our regular recipe and it never fails.

This was so good! I had no onion, carrots, had to substitute 1/4 C of cooked celery and used 3 teaspoons of Lipton dry onion soup mix, I only had a 1/2 of cheddar cheese so I used that 1/2 C and 1/2 C of Mozzarella, this slices real well, I had a sandwich with it this afternoon, its just about gone and I 'll have a sammich tomorrow. I think I'll keep using 1/2 of the Mozzarella & 1/2 cheddar (my family can be picky and would have thought seeing the cheese inside would have made it too rich for them, they have missed out on a lot over the years :) loved the ketchup and  brown sugar topping also! I need to figure out how to do a gravy like this with some beef gravy mixed in. Thanks!
 2/9/16 Made about 5 times since 1st review, so good, don't dismiss this recipe because of the cheese, somehow the cheese melts into this, it slices perfect, best meatloaf I ever made. Thank you again

Forgot to add the onions (my bad), but this still was delicious.  Cut the salt in half and used AR's Tangy Meatloaf Sauce for the topping.  Really like what the cheese brings to this meatloaf.

Great recipe! I think the current ingredients work well for a family meal. For my wife and I, we reduced the sweet stuff - ketchup and sugar, used a stronger Dijon, and added garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and tabasco for a little less sugar and more tang. We also tried lean-ground turkey as its such a lighter meat vs beef.  Using turkey not beef - you can also speed up the oven time from an hour and a quarter to forty-five mins. Was delish! Thanks!

I am making this recipe tonight and I've followed everything to the letter. However, I'm concerned that 3 slices of bread didn't render enough crumbs as the loaf is pretty wet. Was sort of hard to form. I added a tad bit of panko crumbs, it helped very little. I posted a photo of the loaf before cooked- maybe someone can see by the photo and tell me if it looks right?  I'm giving a 5 star before I actually know because anything with melted cheese is yummy ;)

I didn't have any carrots or cheese but otherwise I stuck to the recipe.. Didn't know how much onion to use and  since it didn't really specify I assumed a whole onion but only ended up chopping half of it to add.. I'm not sure what it was but once my loaf was done, the top of it was covered in light brown watery stuff.. You couldn't even see the ketchup anymore so I had to drain that liquid off and add lots more ketchup.. Other than that the flavor was okay.

I love this recipe! My family loves it. Love the sauce and how juicy the meatloaf comes out. It's not dry like I've had in the past.

The only modification I made was using a bit less brown sugar in the sauce.

This was a great recipe! I did not have carrots so I omitted them and I also exchanged the mustard for Worcestershire sauce. I added oregano and Italian seasonings as well to give it an extra flavor. My husband loved the recipe! A keeper for sure

I will not make this according to the method given, again... it makes zero sense to have a base of sugar/ketchup, as the liquid from the hamburger cooking will infiltrate into this base.  what is left is sugary broth.

I love this meatloaf recipe. I usually don't change recipes on this site until I try it once and I have made this at least 5 times. The original version is awesome, but my husbands on the Atkins diet so I changed a few things this time. I used 1/2 cup coconut flour instead of bread crumbs and 2/3 cup half and half instead of milk. I also added bacon on top since he can't have sugar and there are crazy carbs in katchup.

What a treat! I've never made meat loaf as good as this before... and I'm not even a meat lover! Didn't have carrots and substituted Dijon for yellow mustard. Cut the salt just a little and everything else was identical. My son says I need to make meat loaf more often. ;) Thanks for the keeper!

Neither myself or my husband particularly like meatloaf...but we both thought this recipe was excellent, by far the best meat loaf we have ever made/had.  I used the exact ingredients however, I made mine into 8 (4 oz) mini meat loafs and I sautéd the onions, carrots, and garlic (I guess I added garlic) before mixing them into the meat.  I baked them at 425 for 20 minutes...came out perfect.  Will certainly make again! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

First, I have to say that I have never been much of a meat loaf fan.  Mom used to make this on occasion, and while it was good, I would have rather just had a hamburger.  So I made this tonight simply because I had too much ground beef on hand that needed to be eaten.

The only modification I made to the recipe was to add several dashes of L&P Worchestershire sauce.  I used 80% lean ground chuck, and the loaf never fully setup, although it held together for the most part.  My bread was not completely dry, and in hindsight I should have toasted it.  So I am unsure if the excess moisture was due to the semi-dry bread or too much milk or not using leaner beef.

However, the flavor was GREAT.  The sauce really was a winner as simple as it is.  I will definitely make this one again.

I read the other reviews and took notes- mainly about it being too "wet". So I used 1 egg and 1/2 the amount of milk. With that, it was still fairly wet. I drained the liquid, and the meat was not very firm, barely kept its form. But... it tasted really good! I also added Italian seasoning to the meat. My kids loved it! My husband was not a fan only because it was very soft/moist. I recommend trying it but use less egg/milk and maybe drain it once or twice during the baking process.

Basically nice recipe  -  but where is the garlic? I always use cheese in the loaf  -  but  -  cut it in 1 inch cubes, so when the meat is ready you still see the melted cheese.

I have never been so excited about eating meatloaf as I have with this recipe. I love love love it. I have started altering it, by using a bit of granny smith apple too and a little less carrot. Also very yummy.

This was very good. It will probably the recipe I will use from now on.  I fixed it exactly by the recipe except I put a little less sugar in the sauce.  We don't like things very sweet.  I also kinda doubled the sauce because it sounded so good I saved some to put on the meat after it was cooked.  Great recipe

Mix was a bit too "wet." Instead of dissolving bread, I used 1.5 cups of plain breadcrumbs and added a bit more shredded cheese. Great meat loaf recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  Even my pickiest eater LOVED it and this kid hardly likes anything in which the primary ingredient isn't sugar.  I was a little skeptical about the carrots but I used them anyway - made the recipe as written with just one exception - I sauteed the onions before adding, and it was fabulous.  Even my food snob BF loved it and that's saying a lot!

This is my first time making a meatloaf.  I followed the recipe with some exception. I added mince garlic, horseradish, and horseradish mustard in the topping.  It was great for the first time.  Thanks.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made! Comfort food at its best. Because we don't raise beef, I use a pound of ground elk and half pound of ground pork for moistness. Yumm!

I made this meatloaf tonight for my husband and I. I followed the recipe exactly, My husband said it's a keeper and I agree.So delicious moist and easy to make. I think the next time I make it I will cut down of the brown sugar in  the topping, just a bit too sweet for our taste.But other than that"It's a Keeper".

Made this last night. So. Dang. Delicious! I've never been a meat loaf fan. Always considered it a "boring" meal. Well this recipe changed my mind. It was perfect all the way around.  No changes to it. Highly recommended.

I have made this about 6 times now and I consider it my new favorite meatloaf with a few minor alterations to the already awesome recipe!  I use potato bread instead of regular... I swear it makes a diff!  Also, I add a few slices of bacon to the top of mine before I put it in the oven,  I remove it about 10 min before it is done and drain off the fat... then add a couple more tablespoons of the topping mixture and let it finish.  Sometimes I zap it under the broiler for few min to really cook the topping those last few min.  The last tweak I do is substituting minced onion for regular onion.  My family simply wont eat onions (makes me nuts because I love them) so I just use the minced onion to add flavor and it is simply fantabulous!   (I also add a healthy tsp of garlic powder and a tsp of steak seasoning... together they just makes everything better!)

Best meat loaf ever! Seriously!
I have followed the recipe to the letter. There is not enough with just one batch. I make two. 
I have even done two batches using one pound of ground beef and one pound of ground pork and double everything else, it is awesome!

I've made this a few times and recommend a couple of small adjustments. Grate, rather than chop, the onion. Make sure to finely, not coarsely, grate the carrot. Be sure to use challah bread. I couldn't believe how much better this was the one time I used challah and I haven't looked back since! And, as other reviewers have noted, definitely double the sauce, reserving half to serve with the meatloaf.

Excellent!  Made it almost exactly as written last night.  Used 1 extra large egg and 1/2 cup milk. Didn't happen to have an onion so I used a package of Lipton's Onion Soup mix instead.  Formed it into a loaf and baked it on a rack over a cookie sheet. It was so good that my son requested meat loaf sandwiches for lunch today. It's a little sweet tasting, moist and wonderful! Loved it!

This is probably the 10th meatloaf recipe I've tried, and it appears that my search is not over yet. It was good, but just not what I am looking for. I followed the recipe to the letter (as I do whenever I am trying a new recipe) too much bread, yet not dense enough and I thought the topping was too tangy. The cheese sounded like a good idea, but I didn't taste it at all. So my search will continue. I think I would like to eliminate any type of tomato product (like ketchup) and concentrate more on a beef/mushroom base combination.  Wish me luck!!!!

There was too much onion and I would pre-cook the onion and carrot next time because they were too crunchy in the end product.  And, yes, it was a little to sweet for me.  Would I make it again, yes, but it needs tweeking.

I forgot carrots but I did use Vidalia onions  which still kept it fairly sweet. The meatloaf was at a perfect moisture; the bottom of the pan was covered in juices which kept it from getting dry. Picture of bottom of pan included.

This was the best meatloaf I've ever had. I can't cook very well and my boyfriend makes fun of me. I followed this recipe and left out the carrots. I wanted to take a picture but we could not stop eating it. It was delicious! Next time i'll let the juices drain.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I thought it was WAY too sweet and had too much onion in it. The texture was good and it was very moist. Next time I will use 1/2 the amount of brown sugar and 1/4 of an onion.

This meatloaf is really good. Followed the exact recipe. I thought the sauce was just a tad bit to sweet for me.  But I might have been alittle bit  heavy handed with the brown sugar. Will definately make again!

I made this but I can't eat wheat and used Gillian's bread crumbs instead of bread & soaked it in the milk. Also made a 3 lb loaf. 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef. It was the best meat loaf I've ever had or ever made. It's a keeper. The topping was delicious. I thought the texture was good. I would  make it the same way next time.

Tried it with modifications (what was in the house)--used swiss for the cheddar, mushrooms for carrot, and horseradish mustard for yellow - best meat loaf in ages - will try the original after shopping - all quantities worked perfectly - thank you.

I've made the original version of this a couple of times and it was the best meatloaf I've ever had (shhhh... even better than my mom's meatloaf)! I've done healthy alternatives to the same recipe, I've also tried it with half ground beef, half mild country sausage and it's always great. This is now my go-to meatloaf recipe.

Matt O, Used your recipe tonight. Used chopped green pepper instead of carrots and seasoned bread crumbs instead of bread. Took about an hour and a half. It was absolutely fantastic! My wife and I agree it was the best we've ever had. Thanks for sharing!

Loved it.  First time I tried it I made a few changes and everyone that tried it liked it even tho some weren't fond of meat loaf.  I used lamb, cracked wheat instead of bread, raw sunflower seeds, spring onions, and  no carrots.  I think the next time I'm going to try crushed corn chips instead of cracked wheat or bread and add a can of green chilis instead of onions.

3.8 stars! This was my first venture away from using my mom's ml recipe.  My husband doesn't like meatloaf but agreed to give it a try.  He and my daughter scarfed it up.  Used 1 tsp of Nature's Seasonings by Morton instead of pepper & salt, used oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs (1 - 1 1/2 cups), used 1/2 onion, skipped the cheese based on other reviews and personal taste, added 1 tsp minced garlic, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, skipped mustard although I think I will add this next time, added ketchup or tomato sauce.  Cooked in patties not loaf.  The patties is just a preference but we like it that way plus it cuts down on the time to cook!

I made this meat loaf and it was really good. I have another meat loaf recipe that I normally use but I wanted to try a different one this time and it was a hit! I wasn't sure about the mustard or the fresh bread but it was worth the chance. I have saved this to my recipe box and will be making it again.

Made as directed and it was very good and very moist.  Glaze is delicious, but almost wished there was more of it.  I used a very large onion and I think next time I'll use less onion (the water contained in the onion made the meatloaf almost too moist).  Overall though, pretty good recipe as is.

Made it last night, it turned out great! Doubled the recipe for leftovers, but stayed with original amount of milk & added minced garlic.  Used Italian bread crumbs 2/3 cup.  Placed it in 9 x 13 dish and shaped it into a loaf.  My sister who can be very picky finished her plate!  My son & husband loved it!  Can't wait to take leftovers to Mom & Pop.

Have made this many times, exactly as written. Very, very good, and I would NOT omit the carrots! Fresh parsley into the mix is a bonus - w/ the carrots add nice color to an otherwise brown dish.  The topping is delicious too. Try this! For those that favor more traditional meatloaf recipes, this is a very nice alternative!

Meatloaf has been my favorite food....since I can remember beginning to love food, so it was hard for me to venture outside the realm of my mother/grandmother's recipes and try this one. However! After giving this recipe a go (left out the carrots)...I will never...ever make another meatloaf recipe, again! It's SENSATIONAL!!!! I tend to use an extra piece of bread (or two) and only about 1 lb of meat...but seriously...look no further for the most delicious meatloaf you'll ever eat!!!! :)

Good flavor. The only issue was that I slightly overcooked it, a little dry. I used cornflake crumbs in place of bread. Also, only had spicy brown mustard. I added chopped peppers too. Didn't have carrots.

Absolutely wonderful. Wouldn't change a thing. I love brown gravy over my meatloaf but this recipe is fantabulous with out the gravy.  The gravy stays on the mashed potatoes only. Thanks for the great recipe :)

Overall I think this very good. I used a mix of beef mince and pork mince in ration 3:1. I did not have ketchup so I substituted 2/3 tomato sauce and 1/3 chipotle sauce. Next time I will add some more spices to the mix. I also found that the meatloaf was a bit over moist, so next time I will bake it on foil with a few holes on it, so that the liquid can drip out. Will also make a double amount of glaze as I will get a larger area to glaze. My family loved it and it all went in one sitting, so recipe is a keeper. Served this with homemade potatoe mash, carrots and a greep salad. Noone wanted dessert.

Changed up the topping a little. Instead of Yellow, used Grey Poupon. Added a little more kick with some horseradish.  Amazing!!

I have tried many iterations of meatloaf to my husbands chagrin. He didn't get to eat this with the family so I sent it to work with him. He called to tell me that it was the best meatloaf ever. I'm keeping this recipe!

Made as written, and we enjoyed it very very much! I'm not a huge meatloaf fan, but even I went back for seconds! At first when I sliced it, I thought, to much onion..but naw it wasn't! Thanks for posting this and it definitely goes in the rotation!!

OMG!!! The BEST meatloaf I have ever made and eaten! This is the ONE!  My family devoured it and want it for leftovers. The only changes I made were to use gluten free panko and no carrots. ( didn't have any) Thanks so much!

This was delicious and I made no changes at all!  I made one with ground beef for my boyfriend and one with vegetarian "beef" for me and both were awesome!  For anyone trying to make it veggie style, I just got an equal parts of vegetarian breakfast sausage and vegetarian hamburger substitute, I just eyeballed the amount, it was probably a little less than the ground beef I used for the other one but it really made no difference.  For the veggie one I also mixed just a tiny bit of the sauce in with the main loaf as well as putting it on top.  It was so good I might do that next time with both loaves - just stir in about 2 tbsp. of the glaze into the loaf as well as putting it on top.

Everyone in my family agreed that this was the most moist, delicious meatloaf we've ever had.  They couldn't wait for leftovers the next night.  I used venison, which is all I used in all of my ground beef recipes and it was still moist!  I love using Triscuit Rosemary & Olive Oil crackers instead of bread crumbs in my meatloaf recipes,too!

This was my 1st attempt at ever making meat loaf and it turned out great. My whole family enjoyed this recipe and my son who is normally picky even had seconds. The only thing I did not do was add carrots because I did not have any on hand. I will definitely make this again!

It was moist and delicious. I adjusted it for 1 lb of beef and baked uncovered for an hour. The only change was adding a teaspoon of Worsteshire sauce and a Tbsp of finely chopped celery to it.  I think I will make some sort of sauce or gravy to go with it just because I like sauce with my meatloaf. Overall good recipe. I will keep this one.

Way too wet and also too salty. Second try I cut the salt to 1 tsp and the milk to 1/4 cup. Also thought the "crust" too sweet.
and the portion size 1/4 lb way too small. When I want meat loaf I want more then a 1/4 pounder. I thought about giving it one star but since I did eat some of both the first and second attempts it received a 2 star

I liked this meat loaf a lot.  I have a dairy allergy in the family so I had to leave out the cheese and used soy milk instead of milk. I also had to use bread that was not made with dairy.  Turned out delicious - I used a little extra grated carrots - I never measure that kind of ingredient.  I think that is a great idea to put them in meatload.  My family never even knew they were in there.

I made mini meat loaves in a Texas muffin pan and put 1/3 stick of string cheese in the middle. They were moist and the texture was amazing, but my Betty Crocker recipe has the best flavor for meat loaf I have ever had.

Wow.  Not typically a meatloaf fan but I had ground beef to use, followed the recipe exactly and ended up only cooking for about 50 minutes, checked it w/ a thermometor and it was 160 so it was safe to eat.  Not dry at all and good flavors, the sauce on top is key..  My boyfriend said it was better than his mothers, which is the first recipe I have made that he has ever said that about. Easy to make and sneaks some veggies in too with the carrots, I used whole grain bread to keep it a little healthier.  It worked out to only 275 calories if you spit into six servings!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very tasty.  I did do some substitutions : colby jack cheese (I was out of cheddar) and I also added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes (we love spicy food) and 1/2 tsp oregano.  To my surprise, I opened my cupboard and had no table salt- only garlic salt- so I used that instead.  I swear this is going to be one of my new favorite dishes.  Even my 4 year old step-daughter, who only eats hotdogs and Mac and cheese, loved it too!

This meatloaf was amazing!  I omitted the onions, personal preference, and it was so good we couldn't stop eating it!

This really was the best meatloaf ever!  I didn't want to do onion so I used an envelope of onion soup mix instead.  It was amazing!

I have never liked meatloaf but every couple of years I'm willing to try it again.  This meal will now be added to our dinner menu on a regular basis.  Thank you for the recipe!  I think it's perfect as-is.

We use turkey instead of beef, so we cut the milk back to 1/2 cup due to the extra moisture in the turkey.  Absolutely awesome!

Exceptional. Just as good the next day and the next week.  I switched out carrot for green pepper.

This is my first time trying to make meatloaf. This recipe is easily executed and the dish tastes so good. I don't feel that I need to attempt a different recipe! My husband did comment that the brown sugar mixture was too sweet. I thought it was fine the way it was and tasted great, but I think he's a little sensitive to sweet things, so next time we might half the amount of brown sugar or just leave the topping on the side and brush on as we go. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe. I used ground Turkey instead of ground Beef. I almost forgot to share it with my family! :)  I will definitely do it again. Thanks for sharing! RG

Very moist, but a bit bland.  I think more salt, pepper, and some kind of spices would help.  I doubled the sauce which was very tasty.

This was absolutely FABULOUS... my husband always always hated meatloaf, but i made this, (twice now) and he stands at the stove after he's already eaten and eats it out of the pan. Best ever meat loaf is the perfect name for it. Wonderful. Thank you!!! :)

This was really the best meatloaf and my family agreed!  I only made a few minor changes - I substituted 1 cup dry bread crumbs for the bread slices, and added minced garlic to the sauce.  It was delicious and moist, even my picky son loved it.  Will definitely be making again!

This meatloaf was very filling and delicious!
I used water instead of milk.
The cook time needs to be longer for about 2 hrs.

My family and I liked this meatloaf. I omitted the carrots because I did not have any (not sure how it would effect the taste) and I used Dijon mustard. Overall a very good recipe.

This meatloaf is delicious!!! All 5 of us gobbled it up.  It was so moist and had great flavor. I highly recommend trying it.  The only thing I left out was the carrots since I didn't have any on hand.  Yum!! Definitely my go to meatloaf recipe. Thank you for submitting :)
