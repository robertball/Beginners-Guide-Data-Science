This was excellent! My husband and neighbors LOVED it! I didnt use nearly as much pesto as suggested I just coated the fillet generously I didnt measure just put on a thick coat. Next time Ill broil the fish for a few min THEN put the pesto on then continue cooking so that the pesto doesnt burn and get dried up. Deffinetly will make again!!

I made this for my boyfriend who loves pesto, and it just didn't do anything for us.  Because all of the pesto was on top, we couldn't flip the salmon and the fillets didn't cook all of the way through before almost burning.  Definitely won't try this one again

Delicious!   For those who had issues with the cooking method -- suggest you watch "Chef John's" video for pesto-broiled salmon.  Once the fillets are coated with pesto, begin by placing your baking sheet on the stove burner, just for a couple of minutes to give the bottom of the fish a head start.  Move to the broiler (approx 8 inches from flame) until browned.  Then reset oven to 350 and bake for a few minutes til its to your liking.  This is the method I've used and it's worked like a charm.

Very nice recipe.  I don't think you need that much pesto, especially if you're looking for a healthier dish.  It does keep it nice and moist, but the fat content in pesto is insane!  Very easy to prepare, but not skimpy at all.  Bravo!

i followed the recipe, but the pesto did not form any kind of crust, and it just came out as a big piece of salmon with pesto smeared over it. i'm not impressed.

Great dish!  Just make sure you place the broiler pan at least 8-9" away from the broiler as to not burn the pesto before the fish is cooked.

This was very good! I took some other suggestions and baked the fish first - 400 degrees for 15 minutes - then put on the pesto and broiled it on low for 5 minutes, high for 3. HOWEVER, the pesto wasn't crispy how I would've liked - next time, I think I'll bake for 10 minutes, then add the pesto and broil on high for at least 10 minutes to make it nice and browned. The only changes I made to the ingredients was not using as much pesto as was called for. Will definitely make this again!

A different way to eat salmon.  Definitely add the garlic roasted red potatoes, adding a little lemon right before serving.  Yum.

This sounds very good. I think I will use less pesto.  This made me laugh though:  Use pliers to pull out any that remain.  Could only be written by a man!!!! I've never seen pliers in my kitchen !!

excellent!  my only change was adding crushed toasted pine nuts over the top - gave it a good, slightly crunchy texture.

This was pretty good. I just spread the pesto on top to taste; it did not form a crust. I didn't have any lemon, but would have preferred having some.

Shazaaaaam!!!  My family loved it.  My husband doesn't like pesto and my son isn't big on fish dishes but they couldn't say anything bad about this one.  I have to admit, slathering on pesto sauce as thick as this is a bit unnerving but when they tasted it and their eyes lit up.... it was all worth the anguish.  I followed the recipe exactly!!!  Everyone was wrinkling their noses as I prepared it and just knew it would "suck" but as soon as my husband tasted it, he said "Wow, what a great flavor this has".  Thanks Stephan!!!

I was a bit doubtful about this recipe, as I love salmon so much that I tend to like it "plain" or with very little seasonings, however the pesto stands right up to the salmon without overwhelming the flavor.  My pesto crust didn't quite brown - I should have broiled it more like six inches from the broiler (at 425F) rather than the nine.  But still, this was absolutely delicious - a definite repeat!

This was very good - but I made a few modifications.  I used the tomato based pesto and baked (not broiled) for 25 @375.  I could imagine the caloric content of using regular pesto at even 1 cup!  I used only 1/2 cup for 2.5lbs of salmon.

Still very delicious.  Topped it over "Salmon and Spinach Fettuccine" that is posted on this site.  Magnifique!

This was an excellent recipe. Will use it again. Only thing that I will change is the cooking time - fish could have used an extra 5 minutes of cooking time - since it hadn't cooked all the way thru' to the bottom 1/4" - but was still tasty. Don't think you can really "overcook" this dish - due to the fish being in the wine/lemon mixture.

This is the best salmon recipe that I've ever cooked!  Two of my guests asked for the recipe. Nice presentation and so tasty!  Since I have a gas stove, the broiler cooks very quickly, so I had to bake the salmon for about 5-10 min before broiling the top.  I'll definitely cook this again!  Thanks for sharing!

We made this last night and it was fantastic.  I did take it off broil and bake it until it was done after the pesto had a good dark crust on it from broiling it.  The crusty pesto was the best.

If I could give this recipe more stars I would!  I LOVE this recipe!  This is so easy and so impressive for company!  I have made this for almost every guest I have over and also for 2 very elegant dinner parties I have had.  I serve the salmon with a rice pilaf and some grilled vegetables.  From start to finish this dinner takes me just 20 minutes!  Every time I make it someone asks for the recipe!  And to comment on the comment above me by LeeLee222 - the pesto is better when blackened.  The flavor of the blackened pesto is to die for!  When I serve it I generally tell people the pesto is suppose to be blackened.  I also choose to make my own pesto because I can make it thicker and less runny than the bottled stuff.

This salmon really was delish.  I made it for a group of 12 women and I believe all of them liked it.  I left the pesto off part of one of the filets and that was also a hit for those who don't like pesto.  I read the other comments so I made the Pesto from scratch instead of using the convenient one from Costco that I had bought.  Great idea as I think it did make a difference.  Lemon is a necessity.  I broiled it on hi mostly but lowered to lo.  8 minutes did it perfectly. I refigerated it for a few hours and we ate it cold.  Awesome!  I served it with the Risotto Cake from this site and Roasted Vegetables.  A bikini martini was the starter drink and we had a great evening.  Perfect for a hot summer day.

Great recipe!  I don't even like salmon, and this was fabulous!  The pesto and wine are the perfect compliment to the strong taste of the salmon.  Thanks for the submission.

This is definitely a keeper! So simple to prepare, but very attractive plated and tasted wonderful! It doesn't hurt at all to let it marinate longer than 15 minutes.

Great! Great! Great! I was sceptical about this but, to my and my husband's delight, it turned out wonderfully.  The pesto was delicious once nice and brown.  The fish was INCREDIBLY moist, flaky, and tender.  I used a .75lb piece of salmon, coated it about 1/8 of an inch thick with pesto, broiled it on the second rack from the top, uncovered, for 20 minutes and it was PERFECT!

Excellent.  I made my own pesto, I only needed about a cup, slathered it on and broiled it for around 20 min.  The crispy pesto melted in our mouths.  I made for my folks who thought it was exquisite.  I served with pasta w/ the remaining pesto and a green salad.  Thanks for the idea!

This is one excellent recipe for salmon.  It was tough watching that expensive pesto turn brown, but it was soooo good!  Forget the review that says this stinks up your house - I don't know what kind of salmon they were cooking, but there was no smell of any kind.

Excellent recipe.  It created quite a bit of smoke, and I thought it was going to be burnt, but the end result was perfect.  I think the other reviewer's suggestion of using another method of cooking(grilling, stovetop) misses the point.  Broiling creates a perfect crust on the salmon, and imparts a magnificient flavor.  I did use quite an expensive pesto though...

Very simple to make.  I roasted at 425 for 7 minutes and then broiled for 7 minutes.  It wasn't crispy but it wasn't soupy either.  Next time I will move the pan closer to the broiler.

This was fantastic. The "blackened" pesto is delicious. I expected it to taste like burned grass, but I guess the cheese, olive oil, and nuts in the pesto are enough to just sort of fry and "carmelize" the basil. YUM!

This is a 10-star recipe!  FABULOUS!!  I was only broiling a small piece, so I didn't use a ton of pesto, & I also sprinkled some seasoned breadcrumbs on top of the pesto.  I baked my salmon for 15 minutes or so before turning on the broiler.  The breadcrumbs helped to make a perfect crust on top!  A bit of pepper & a pinch of shredded parmesan was a little added bonus on top!  (I forgot my last lemon, but I didn't miss it!)  Some asparagus rounded out this perfect recipe!  I'll definitely be making this again!!  Thanks!

I decided to bake this at 375 for about 20 minutes and then broil for a few minutes to finish off.  I added sea salt and black pepper to the salmon before topping with the pesto (which I used less than stated).  This was really good and I will be making it again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I thought this recipe was going to be great and it was just okay. There was a nice crust from the pesto. However, I used a jarred pesto and I noticed all of the olive oil that was used in the pesto separated causing much splattering in the broiler. My fiance says for lack of a better recipe we may try it again for the salmon.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!  I made it for my mom and dad and they absolutely loved it.  The pesto made the salmon so delicious!  The lemon juice made it taste great too! It was easy to make.  I am a beginner at cooking and this was my first attempt at cooking salmon and it turned out great!! This is a recipe you don't want to miss!

My family loves salmon, so we looked forward to trying this out.  However, I was very dissapointed by this recipe, which was rated 4 1/2 stars.  I expected it to be very good, but we did not like this.  The flavor of the salmon was nice, but my husband and kids did not like it with the pesto; they ended up taking it off before they would eat it.  I didn't think it was terrible, but it certainly was not very good and I will definitely not be making this again.

I made this tonight, and my husband was not impressed.  He thought the flavor of the fish (from the wine and lemon) was great, but he did not like the pesto on it at all.  On the plus side, I cooked the salmon perfectly, and once my husband scraped off the pesto, he was able to enjoy his meal more.  We will not be making this again.

Extremely easy and very tasty!  I went for the thicker layer of pesto and will go a bit easier on the pesto next time or make my own without as much olive oil in it...end result was a bit too oily, but still tasted very nice.

I'd give this more stars if I could. I made this last night and it was outstanding!  Everyone loved it! It was perfection.  I would serve this to company.  I had it cold for breakfast this morning and it was sensational even cold like Stephan said.  Thanks so much for the wonderful and versatile recipe.

These were okay; they turned out really salty though.  I suppose that is only because of the pesto I used (Trader Joe's).  If I used a different pesto with less salt and more garlic, I think these would have tasted much better.

My children now LOVE salmon! I broiled it on the center rack, which eliminated any smoking or stinking up the kitchen. This recipe is now a family favorite and is simple enough to cook on any day of the week.

Wonderful recipe. I prepared it, then put it in the oven (around 400F / 200C / Gas Mark 9) for 30 minutes instead of grilling (broiling) it. My family thought it was really delicious. The leftovers were great the next day as well.

My being from Oregon I am a Natural for this recipe - I was looking for a recipe for "The 4th" and now I've found it!  What I think I will do instead of cooking this in a pan in the oven, because of our heat in Las Vegas, I will cook on the grill - either way it will be OUTSTANDING!  Thank you Stephan!

I've used this recipe in the past (cookbook) and its a great change of pace to the everyday salmon preparation. For those who have issue with over browning, simply lower your rack or eat salmon medium to medium rare, which is how it tastes best anyway. The crust will not be crispy. It inherently goes on wet and forms a moist crust.

It was an interesting idea (and seemed great for using up leftover pesto), but the pesto never hardened and I was left with a bunch of gloppy pesto over over-cooked salmon :( I started the pan far from the broiler and gradually brought it nearer until it was directly below-much longer than 8-10 minutes total-and it never burned :P

Simple, fast, and delicious.  My class didn't get out until 9pm tonight, and with this recipe, I was enjoying a delicious meal 20 minutes after I got home.  Per other suggestions, I broiled a bit prior to putting on the pesto.  The pesto didn't completely crust, but I was concerned about cooking the fish thoroughly, and it was still very good.  I had a fairly thick piece of salmon, so I broiled for 5 minutes with just the lemon and wine, then added the pesto and broiled for another 5 minutes.  Perfect!

In the mountains for the weekend and didn't feel like waiting for the bbq to heat up to make our salmon.  This recipe was so easy and delicious.  My son and husband are pretty picky and they loved it!  I too will try the panko breadcrumb addition that other viewers suggested.  I did bake the salmon first and then added the pesto and put under the broiler.  Definitely keep a close eye on it because yes, it will burn if you don't.  I can't wait to make it for some neighbors at home in Newport Beach that love to cook.

I used less pesto than the recipe called for, and still thought it was plenty.  Just enough to coat the salmon.  I covered it with pecan panko (bread crumbs) - baked at 375 for 15 min then broiled for about 5.  It was crispy on top, and the salmon very moist. Can't tell you how it was cold, there were no leftovers!

Very easy and doesn't require many ingredients. I didn't even have wine. But salmon came out real flavorful and delicious. My broiler has High and Low settings - I used Low and it was perfect - took about 25 minutes. Thank you.

Fantastic!  I used salmon steaks and homemade pesto.  Couldn't have been easier to make.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  It is rare to find something so good that is so easy to make.  I think this would be a fantastic dish to make when you have company--you know you wouldn't have to stress about the main course and it definitely tastes special.

This is my husbands and my favorite recipe, we've been eating it once a week for the last few months. I only use a tail piece of salmon so there's no bones. We skip the extra slices of lemon and serve it over a rice pilaf made from a mixed wild rice blend cooked with chicken broth to give it flavor. Delicious with a spring green salad or steamed broccoli. YUM!!!!

I like pesto and I like salmon, but this recipe was not that great. It's just too much pesto, however I do like the light flavor of the white wine mixed with the pesto. We ate it, but I won't be making this one again.

This was awesome!!!!  I bought a jar of Pesto & Dill.  Then, I pasted on to the salmon.  Boy, they were great.  My husband never eats leftover fish however he ate this one even next day!!! Thank you for the great recipe.

My whole family loved this salmon--including my picky 3-yr-old and my even pickier 7-yr-old.  I agree this dish would be very suitable for company.  I used Classico Traditional Basil pesto, and it was delicious.  I also used leftover chardonnay that I had previously frozen in a small plastic container.  I'm so glad I hadn't poured it down the drain.  I thawed it in the fridge, and it was perfect.

This is SOOO good.  The white wine and lemon really takes the "fishy" taste out of the salmon.  For pesto, blend 2 oz. basil, 1/4 c parmesan, 1/4 c olive oil, 3 T pinenuts, 1 clove garlic, s & p.  Served this with "Orzo with Parmesan and Basil" from this website, which is also awesome.

I loved this recipe - especially great for non-fish lovers (like me).  It took me at least 15 minutes to get the topping browned but my thick filet was cooked perfectly.  This would be a good company dish as it is elegant and you can put it under the broiler while enjoying a first course soup or salad.

Yum! My husband and I have made this two ways--broiling until the crust browns and also pulling it out a little earlier. We actually prefer it with the crust slightly softer. We've served this to company and got rave reviews.

Very nice way to prepare salmon.  Taste is great and the presentation is nice, however, the broiling will stink up your whole kitchen.  Ocassionaly it is worth it to compromise a messy stinky kitchen for a very nice dish.  Not a very good dinner for guests.

I followed recipe for the most part. I used DeLallo Simply Pesto sun-dried tomato, basil, and cheese, little less than recipe. Broiled until well browned, almost burning top, then transferred 350 oven until done, about 1 minute. My filets not very thick.
Now, my husband loves tomato but does not like salmon. He tasted and said pretty good. YAY! Serving cold to guests tomorrow and know it will be a hit.

Nice balance of pesto, salmon flavor, anything cooked in wine ends to be delicious. Recipe is wonderful as it, I made my own pesto without nuts and didn't measure the amount of pesto, just spread on a nice layer. Would not alter the recipe at all. I cooked skin side up for 10 minutes, then coated with pesto and finished in the broiler. It was too long and the fish was a touch on the dry side. I would decrease cooking time or maybe broil for a few minutes then add the pesto. Will make again for sure and just adjust cooking time

This review is based on my changes/omissions.  I omitted the lemon juice and wine.  So basically it was pesto over salmon.  Easy and good.  I did take someone's suggestion and I baked at 375 for a few mins before broiling.

This was okay.  Not terrible, not great.  I wasn't sure what to expect from the other reviews -- seems like people either loved it or hated it.  I was in the middle.  I don't know that I'd make it again, but it was fairly decent.  I think it is key to be sure that you are not putting the fish too close to the broiler.  I baked it for about 22-25 minutes and the fish was done perfectly.

Very tasty. I made the pesto from scratch and ended up baking it until the fish was firm. I was afraid that browning the pesto would ruin the fresh flavors that are my favorite part of pesto.

This was very yummy. I made my own pesto as I had overcooked broccoli I didn't want to toss out as well as lots of fresh basil. I made mine with the basil, broccoli, walnuts, a little olive oil, tofu and some seasonings. Took 2 minutes in the food processor. It was wonderful on the salmon and I'll be sure to make this recipe again

I am not a fish lover, but my husband is, so I make it for him once a week or so. I try to look for something that is not time consuming and healthy. He loves this salmon!! Bonus that it is a sinch to make.  He likes it with roasted or mashed sweet potatoes and grilled veggies (eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash and orange peppers) Yum!

So simple! So delicious! Definitely going to be a standby weeknight meal. I have massive amounts of pesto in the freezer thanks to my basil garden. The only change I made was skipping the white wine marinade. & just added lemon after cooking.

Was looking for cod with pesto recipes and could not find one, used this one for the cod and it came out very good. added some garlic powder to it which added a nice flavor. would recommend. it was easy to prepare for newbies in the kitchen, it was quick and it had a great flavor. will make again.

Amazing!!! I baked it 20 min at 350 first then added pesto and broiled it for 5 min. Served with mashed potatoes. I used Fresh picked basil pesto with aged Parmesan and Romano cheese and hints of garlic

So simple and delicious. I put everything in the oven except the pesto for a few minutes before adding it on because I didn’t want it to be cooked too hard. Will definitely make again.

This was absolutely delicious. I made it with homemade pesto made with walnuts rather than pine nuts. The broiler made the pesto crisp up nicely and the fish was cooked to perfection. To keep the pesto from browning too much, I positioned the salmon a good 9" from the broiler. 1.5" thick salmon took about 15 minutes for total cooking time.  The whole family loved it. Definitely a new go-to recipe for us.

I made this with two substitutions: 1) I was out of lemons and subbed in Cara Cara oranges 2) I used Costco Pesto Sauce and used considerably less than the recipe specified (probably 1/4 cup all in for a 1.5 lb filet).  It tasted delicious, but after 9 minutes was only hinting at browning.  However, because I used *wild* not farmed salmon, leaving it in any longer would have guaranteed over cooked fish.  I see many reviews noting that the fish was over cooked or undercooked, and in my experience the source of the fish (wild vs farmed) has a huge impact on the heat tolerance it can take.  We love salmon and are always looking for new ways to serve it; this dish will go into our regular rotation.

Wow I loved this! I'm a total beginner and have only made salmon once before (in a pan) so I was nervous but this came out perfect. I probably could have left it under the broiler a little longer, I never got that "crust", but maybe that's because my fire alarm went off and I was impatient to eat it :) I added diced tomatoes and garbanzo beans on top just because my boyfriend is weird about fish and the more flavor to mask it the better. It was incredible!

I followed Chef John's recommendation to cook on top of the stove for 1 min. then put is under the broiler for 10 minutes.  Only put a thin layer of pesto on top and sides.  It was delicious.  I made it one other time and it wasn't as good because I used too much pesto.  Cookinmom's review was the most helpful. Thank you

Very good! My boyfriend loved it, more than i did. As per suggestions, I put some breadcrumbs+parmesan+peper on the pesto: IT was very very good! I had to remove some wine, because it was too much. thank you from Italy!!

Easy and good! I left out the lemon. And the wine. And about half the pesto. So, yeah, I didn't follow the recipe very closely at all. I drizzled the fish with olive oil to start, then added a layer of pesto, but only enough to cover, not nearly 1/4 inch. My salmon was still a little bit frozen, so I broiled for 11 minutes, and it came out really nice. The flavors were very complimentary and not overpowering as pesto can be. Had a rice pilaf and green salad on the side.

The pesto was a bit much. I found it overall too  rich for my liking. I like the crisp of the broiler for fish.

Holy cow!  I didn't know my own personal salmon recipe could get better, but it just did by using this recipe.  I made homemade pesto last week and froze it (made it without pine nuts) and I made this for my hubby's birthday dinner.  I served it with glazed carrots and brown rice pilaf and wow, did I win points!  The only thing different that I did was after putting on the pesto "icing," I layered some panko bread crumbs on top and sprayed them with butter flavored Pam before broiling.  Out of the ballpark!  Thank you so much for the recipe! = )

I've made this several times. I usually forget to add anything other than the pesto and its always delicious. I use Wild-Caught store brand salmon and a little jar of basil pesto called Mezzetta-Napa Valley Bistro. It's the bizzness! I make it with brown rice and broccoli. My Pesto never comes out crispy but there is always a lot of liquid in the pan even though I thaw my fish completely. ^_^ definitely a staple in my recipe box.

Excellent recipe. If the salmon isn't finished cooking and pesto has browned sufficiently, I stop broiling and set oven to 350 degrees. I bake the salmon until it is opaque and flakes easily.

Everyone loved this fish and the flavor.  The only complaint was from my husband, who didn't like the skin on the bottom.  I did have to move the oven rack up a little closer to the heat source to cook the pesto a little more.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add salt to the fish before adding the pesto, and sprinkling a little Parmesan cheese on top in the last few minutes of cooking.

Wonderful flavor! I made this for my husband and myself and we both loved it! I used steelhead trout instead of salmon. Also, I recommend cooking just a little longer... I had formed the brown crust, took it out and got it on the table, we cut into it and it was still raw in the middle and I had to put it back in the broiler for a few more mins. Make sure you anticipate for this!

I thought this was really yummy, but it really was like pesto on top of salmon, the salmon itself didn't grab much of the flavoring from the pesto.  I still liked it though!

I didn't have access to the computer to double check the recipe and only used about 1/2 cup of pesto and did not remember the wine or lemon. It was still pretty good. I was surprised how mild it tasted since my family did not like the pesto chicken recipe, and it was pretty similar. This one much better recieved.

Salmon takes the pesto flavor really well and it was just the thing to use up the pesto in my fridge. Like with other reviewers, the crust eluded me. I will make this again though, and maybe cheat and try some bread crumbs over the pesto. This is awesome served with polenta and a green veggie like broccoli, green beans, or asparagus.

Used a prepared sun dried tomato pesto from the grocery store, but otherwise followed the recipe.  This was very tasty.  The pesto got nice a crispy.

This recipe is very similar to one of my favorite dishes at a popular restaurant. Most pesto is made with olive oil, so its the healthy kind of fat. The first time I made it, I think I broiled it too close to the top and the wine burnt, causing the smoke detector to go off, the fish was not burnt at all and we still had a yummy dinner. The second time I made it, I decided not to chance it, and just cooked it over the stove, and although not as pretty, it still came out yummy!

This dish was average.  The pesto didn't 'crust' like the recipe said it would.  I'd make this again if I needed a quick dinner with little ingredients but wouldn't serve to dinner guests.

This one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had and my wife enjoys it as well.  We also like it as cold leftovers for lunch the next day.  You have to like pesto to like this dish, but if you do, it makes for a tasty salmon.

this dish was amazingly delicious.  i didn't have any lemon, so i used a bit more white wine, but i could tell that the lemon would have added another dimension.  will definitely try it again (and will use the lemon next time!)

This was good.  I love pesto and I love salmon, so I thought I'd love them together.  But I think the cooking method (browning the pesto) took a lot of the flavor out of the pesto so I wasn't as crazy about it as I thought I would be.  Definitely not bad by any means, but I wouldn't put this on my favorites list.

This salmon was delicious and flavorful.  I wanted something different and this worked.  However, owners of small, not well ventialted apartments beware: the smell lasted 2 days and we couldn't get the smoke detector to stop going off!  But otherwise great!

The best salmon I have ever had.  I didn't add the extra lemon at the end.  Next time I will cook closer to the broiler as the salmon was done yet the pesto had not browned or bubbled.  Absolutely amazing.

Like it, but didn't LOVE it.  I marinated the salmon in the white wine and lemon mixture, but felt the finished product, even with the pesto topping, was a bit too lemony.  Suited our tastes OK, but might be too much tartness for company.  I used Bellini's pesto sauce which is fabulous.

Yum, yum!!  What a wonderful combination of flavors!  I only wish I had more pesto, to balance the flavors a little, because the wild salmon I used had a strong flavor.  I served this with Garlic Red Potatoes (also from this site) and a green salad.  Very satifying meal.  This recipe is one I'll definitely make again.  Thanks, Stephan.

This was so quick and easy!  I only marinated the salmon for 5 minutes and it still turned out well.  A pleasantly new way to flavor salmon.  I can't wait to try out the cold leftovers tomorrow.

Simple, elegant, and most of all, delicious.  My husband (who is a picky eater) raved about it.  I cheated and bought frozen fillets (a package of two was perfect for us). No mess or bone removal involved! I will be passing this recipe on.

I love salmon, and was looking for a new way to prepare it when I found your recipe.  It's wonderful!  Ridiculously EASY to prepare, presentation was lovely, and every bite was worth savoring.  And yes, it went very well with garlic roasted red potatoes (and steamed asparagus), per your suggestion.  Thanks, Stephan!

Fast, easy, and 3 ingrediants (I didn't have the white wine).  I really cannot imagine using so much pesto-- I like pesto, but not that much.  I spread a good tablespoon on each filet which made a good coating.  My filets were still a bit frozen, so I started at 375 for about 10 minutes and then finished it off under the broiler.  The kids want their fish this way from now on.  It will become a staple that even the teenagers can make. Thanks!

Absolutely loved this recipe, I made it for a small dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe - so simple!  I also lightly broiled some sliced almonds and sprinkled on top before serving.  Will make this again & again!
