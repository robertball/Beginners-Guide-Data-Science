Kind of weird but the flavors all work very well together. WARNING: Don't be an idiot like me - either use instant (I never have that on hand) or COOK the rice a little first. You'd think that was fairly basic but the minute I put it together I thought, "oh, that's not good." And cooked it anyway. The rice was mostly crunchy. But the rest was yummy.
I'll do it again.
And it's a great way to use up leftovers!!

I made this recipe as a "Chopped" challenge.  My husband (at my request) picked surprise ingredients and I had to figure out how to use my "basket" of ingredients to make supper!  What fun.  We have done this a few times and it is a hoot.  Anyway, tonight he brought home two ham steaks, fresh green beans and an Uncle Ben's sun-dried tomato rice mix.  I used these along with cream of mushroom soup and shreded jack cheese.  Per another reviewer's advice, I partially cooked the rice mix first and steamed the green beans.  We loved it!!!  Nice easy weeknight meal, and a great Chopped challenge!

Excellent way to use leftover ham.  I had to substitute cream of mushroom soup for the cream of celery, and I added 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.  Will definitely make this again.

We thought the flavor was very satisfying and a great way to use leftover ham. We used the suggestion of using 2 cans of beans and liked it, but thought that an additional can of cream of celery soup would have made the dish more moist (balancing out the amount of rice), so we'll do that next time. We will make it again!

Second time around:
We preferred this version over my first. Changes from originally posted recipe: 2 cans green beans (drained), 1 can cream of celery soup AND 1 can cream of chicken soup (undiluted), 3/4 cup milk, 1 tbls Worcestershire. I baked it in a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish. This seems to be a nice balance of flavors and moisture. It made two meals for the two of us. Good warm meal on a cold evening.

This was pretty darned good.  My husband just had seconds !  As far as quick casseroles go, this one was better than most.  I had to use grated cheddar instead of American cheese, which was very good. Next time, I will use 2 cans of green beans to  give this dish a slightly healthier balance, but I must admit it was very satisfying. It is also a great way to use leftover ham. I'll make this dish again and may even try macaroni instead of rice, just to see what happens.

This was very easy and good. My whole family liked it.  However,it is not as good the next day-best served hot out of the oven.

It's not bad -- good for using up my leftovers from Thanksgiving (we had ham instead of turkey). I used the leftover ham, fresh green beans, and some rolls and it came out pretty good.  Oh, didn't have the cream of celery, so used cream of mushroom.  I really liked the topping, but felt there was too much rice.  I think if I make it again, I'd use less rice.  Give it a try - it's good!

I wasn't sure at first but this turned out to be a family favorite. I parboiled the rice and fresh greenbeans but it worked perfectly. We will be making this again.

Wonderul!  My husband asked for seconds too and even told me I could make this again.  I didn't have cream of celery soup so I used cream of mushroom with celery seed.

This was not very good. I thought it sounded like an odd combination but thought I'd try it since it had good reviews. We were dissapointed.

We liked this recipe. I used leftover beer bread from the night before and that added a great taste to the bread topping. We liked the crispiness of the bread topping with the creamy rice portion. It was great leftover too. We have now made this part of our rotation and will continue to use the beer bread for the topping.

This was very easy and very good.  It was a great way to use up leftovers.  I used instant brown rice and frozen green beans, thawed.  Only had 4 slices of cheese so sprinkled about 1/4 cup mozzarella over the casserole that I had on hand.  Very good recipe to use up what you have on hand.

We did not really like this recipe.  My husband who will usually eat anything toook 2 bites and got the leftovers out of the fridge to eat instead.  I didnt think it was that bad, but definately nothing special(which I didnt expect it to be I just was looking for a recipe to use up the little ham I had leftover from a party we had a few days prior.)

An easy, quick, tolerable way to use up leftover ham.  I think of it as "good grub."

Use 2 cans green beans, sprinkle a little garlic powder and tiny bit of salt over rice layer and do the rear as directed and it makes an awesome different easy dinner.  Will certainly make again but might have to add a bit of bacon to lift it to the truly awesome level,
