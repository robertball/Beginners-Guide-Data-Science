Great!  Toasted the quinoa in a dry skillet first, used choppoed frozen broccoli (thawed), and used chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon. I did have to add quite a bit more milk (only had the one can of evaporated milk and that wasn't enough) and it still really wasn't soup consistency.  However, it was really tasty! Topped with shredded cheddar-yum.

Super simple and delicious! I definitely had to add more liquid than the can of evaporated milk. I must have added at least another cup of milk to the recipe. The quinoa soaks up liquids like a thirsty sponge, so the "soup" is more like a thick porridge if you use only the evaporated milk. So tasty, I'll be making this again.

This tastes really good!  I made this yesterday after work and it did not take long to make.  It tastes like a broccoli-rice casserole.  I toasted the quinoa (like another Reviewer suggested) and substituted veggie bouillon and a gluten-free flour.  I also added turmeric for its health benefits plus the yellow color was nice.  I will definitly make again!

Very nice taste. I did use 3 cups of broth instead of the water and will double the broccoli next time.

Editing my review because I personally do not like it, however i'm sick at the moment and my tastebuds may be screwed up. My mother however LOVES it.. For those of you that have never had quinoa, she says it tastes similar to barley. She also says this tastes a lot like cream of broccoli soup- something a few other reviewers have mentioned. So, perhaps it really is good, i'm not sure. I had to cook the quinoa for longer than expected because there did not seem to be enough liquid for it to absorb to become fluffy naturally. May try it again with chicken broth instead of bouillon and maybe a different kind of quinoa.

Delicous! i used corn starch instead of flour, and it got so thick I can eat with chopsticks, but incredibly delicious anyway (note: dissolve bouillon cubes before adding them!)

Surprisingly creamy and tasty! more a risotto-type consistency. After tasting it at is, I added some cheese to my serving, and it was AWESOME!  Will make again.

I added carrots and chicken, used butter instead of olive oil, and I seasoned it with salt, winter savory, thyme, and white pepper.  I inadvertently used more water then the recipe calls for in the beginning.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  It was very good.  My six-year-old and three-year-old loved it.  The consistency was somewhat like a stew or loose porridge.

This was a good dinner, but it ended up more like a side dish than a soup. It was a little sweet for our taste so I'm going to think about what I can add to it to make it more savory next time.

I loved this! I did use stock and added some whole milk at the end, to make it more soup-y. I also added more garlic, because I can almost never get enough! Next time I will add some Tumeric, adds a richness to cream soups and added health benefits.

This was really good. I can't have gluten or dairy, so I used gluten free bouillon cubes and a can of light coconut milk. I also threw in some cauliflower as I didn't have quite enough broccoli. Yum!

Sorry but this wasn't too good. It did seem very bland to me and lacking broccoli flavor also.  Strange consistency - more like a side dish. There are many great uses for quinoa but this is not one of them.

Having read the other reviews, I went ahead and used 3 cups of chicken broth to begin with.  Also added chopped rotisserie chicken and a handful of grated low fat cheddar cheese.  Really very good, will definitely make again!

Recipe turned out great. Flavorful and so easy to make. I would agree with some of the reviews that you either need to eat the soup right away or add more liquid because the quinoa will soak up all the liquid, however the result is still great.

Loved this recipe, however I did add some shredded cheese and diced up chicken which really added to the flavor, will definately make again. I used gluten free flour for thickener and did not have evaporated milk, so used light cream.
