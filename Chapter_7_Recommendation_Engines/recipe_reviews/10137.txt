Im giving this recipe only 3 stars for various reasons. First of all the display picture was the reason I took interest in the recipe. The cake like dough was really good. However when I baked it, and tried it, it was dry and very bland. So then I added the marshmallow, and did as the recipe called for. Then tasted it and wasn't impressed at all. To enjoy this recipe I tried several different things as I was determined not to waste my time and effort in making this, cause overall it was good but just needed alot of sprucing up. I chopped pecans, I covered the marshmallow with some more chocolate dough and baked, still to not avail. In my last attempt, which was the winner, was i took some choc. chips and shortening and melted it. Threw the marshmallows out altogether and just used the chopped pecans, and drizzled chocolate over, then to spruce it up a little more, I put powdered sugar over the top. Long story short, its a good starting off point, but it definitely needs more creative touch. Its not necessarily a cookie either, its more of a cake like treat. I dont know if I will make again.

Fantastic cookies!  My husband really likes these.  Although there are several steps, it's still a really easy recipe.  I used a 1 tablespoon-size cookie scoop and came out with 30 cookies, which is what the recipe says.  The cookies are cake-like and the frosting is really fudgey.  Be careful though, they are really sweet!!

I was so enamored with the idea of this recipe; I have a huge weakness for the chocolate/marshmallow combination. But this just didn't deliver. The cookie was bland, at best. It had a very plain chocolate flavor, and the recommended frosting didn't add a new note. Worse, the marshmallows didn't spread or flatten; they just sit on top and add a lot of height to the cookie - also making it very difficult to frost.  On the plus side, the texture of the cookie is lovely. It's soft and cake-like (if you read the directions, step 3 states this), nice and fluffy. Some depth to the flavor would make this a great recipe.

The cookies ended up good but, they were a more of a cake cookie than I thought they would be.

I really was disappointed with these cookies for a couple of reasons... First, they were very "cakey", not like a cookie batter.  Because of this, they didn't set up very well and ended up very thin (not how I like my cookies).  Also, the color for mine did not look like what you would expect of a chocolate cookie... It was almost a caramel color.  I LOVE the idea for these cookies, using the marshmallow and then fudge frosting on the top, so I wanted to love them, but they just didn't cut it.

I made this recipe because the photo looked like a cookie I used to make. However , I believe the recipe is missing parts. I made my own chocolate frosting which really makes this treat what it is!

used less milk for thicker cookie batter.  made caramel sauce and drizzled over marshmallow & cookie after done in oven.  Then frosted using a frosting recipe I think made for these cookies, it's drippyish, but I found that helpful.  these are very tasty.  the cookie itself is not the highlight

The dough turned out to be very light in color, not brown and chocolaty like in the picture. It was too liquid. When I put them to bake, the dough spread out and filled the whole sheet. The taste was bland.
