This is very similar to the recipe that I have used for years.  I can't believe this calls for a full CUP of mayo, though! That sounds like complete overkill, and I think the parmesan could be a little much, too. After draining the artichokes - USE REGULAR ARTICHOKE HEARTS IN WATER, two 14oz cans - I usually run a knife through each can several times to give the hearts a rough chop. I've also started using two cans of chilis (don't bother to drain - that's FLAVOR you're putting down the drain!), and the mayo (usually light - fat free is the work of the devil! :p) is eyeballed, but definitely not even half a cup.  Start with about a quarter to a third of a cup, stir it up and adjust until it's a fairly loose, creamy consistency - but not gloppy. I usually use about half a 6oz. tub of shredded parmesan, with an extra handful across the top before baking. And don't forget the Wheat Thins - for some reason, that is the accompaniment that tastes the best with this!  Enjoy the dip - I guarantee you will crave this version time and again!

This recipe was really oily and mayonaisy, but I did top it with cheddar before baking. I also used Kraft parmesean instead of fresh. I will definately use fresh the next time and omit the cheddar. I will also use about 2/3 the mayo too.

This is such a quick and easy, yet delicious recipe! I made it in a ceramic oval baker that has a plastic lid and brought it to a party - it kept warm for several hours and was the hit of the evening!
YUMMY! FYI - this doesn't reheat very well in the microwave, the oil separates, so i would try to eat it all at once (which isn't hard!)

I took this to a "Hot Luck" fundraiser party where there were many wonderful spicy dishes submitted into a contest!  This dish won 3rd place & it was gone within minutes.  I added a little garlic powder & left everything else the same.  It was great!

This one gets mixed reviews.  I thought it was too mayonaisy for me.  My dad and brother liked it but no one else ate much of it.  I've had better.  I'll probably keep looking.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  It was so greasy - the oil was pooled at the top.  I even cut down the amount of mayo based on an earlier review.

This is one of the best artichoke dips I've ever had.  I've made it a few times.  Careful not to add too many jalapenos as they tend to overpower the artichoke flavor.  I'm bringing it to all my holiday parties this year!

This is my all-time favorite recipe for artichoke dip, and it's always a hit! A tip for cutting down on the mayonnaise flavor (and the fat and calories!) is to substitute half of the mayo with fat-free plain greek yogurt; I do this with all mayo-based recipes and it's one of my culinary secret weapons.

I make this receipe all the time for parties and for snacking.  I use articokes in water rather than marinated and I broil it for the last 5 minutes or so and that helps with the greasiness.  Also, I have tried using the light mayo and it doesn't work as well.  Every party I go to I have requests for this...I LOVE IT!  Super easy and makes you look like a pro!

I've made this exact recipe for years and even folks who HATE artichokes, can't get enough.  I did try it with light salad dressing - no good. Forget it! Unfortunately, it needs the fat to make it really really delicious.  Very dry made with light salad dressing.

I usually double this ... it goes very quickly.

This recipe is great!  Sometimes when I'm in a rush, I just heat it in the microwave until it's bubbling.  It's the perfect dish to have sitting out if you're expecting company for dinner, but dinner is late.  Only, the last time I served it as an appetizer, everyone preferred it over dinner!

I have to say this is one of the best artichoke dip recipes I have tasted.  It is easy to prepare, presents well, and gets rave comments when served.  I suggest doubling the recipe, because it never lasts long!!

I brought this to a holiday party with my friends. I didn't have time to try it myself, but everyone was raving about it. I put a dash of garlic powder for kicks and I left out the green chile peppers. I think this will be something I bring to every party I go to.

This was good.  I used one 14 oz can of artichoke hearts, fresh grated parmesan and hellmans mayo.  It was not greasy at all, but it needed a little kick.  Maybe a few drops of hot sauce or some garlic.  Super simple and was eaten quickly.  Next time I'll double the recipe and use a 9 x13 pan
