Add thinly sliced red peppers for a festive holiday salad.  The bright green and red make it perfect.

This was okay.  I wouldn't make it again.  I ended up adding store-bought dressing because it was so bland, and the bok choy is tough to chew.

This salad was great!  I substituted garlic sesame sticks for the chow mein noodles, and it was just as good.

I think this recipe is a good starting point for a salad like this, but it needs some serious work. To me, bok choy is just better when sauteed or stir fried. I would slightly cook the bok choy with the green onions. I would also toast the pine nuts to give them a better flavor. The dressing needs some more kick, like red pepper flakes and garlic. With some additions, this healthy salad would be better.

I had no issue with the raw bok choy as salad greens, and I did add some red bell pepper strips for color.  The thing that just didn't work for me was the dressing.  All I could taste was olive oil, no "asian" flavor at all, just pretty bland.  I ended up adding more soy sauce and a splash of sesame oil for some flavor.  I did toast my pine nuts, and I liked them as well as the chow mein noodles as salad toppings, but I doubt I'll make this again.

This is very similar to 3 other recipes, so I combined all 3. I added carrots for crunch, used regular Bok Choy since I didnâ€™t have baby, and also followed another suggestion and added the noodles to each portion because I anticipated leftovers. I added the flavor packet to the soy mix for flavor and poured over the cabbage early to soften it up a bit. Overall it was very good but needed something to give it some oomph, to make it memorable. Perhaps some red pepper flakes or some lemon or lime zest? Would make again.
