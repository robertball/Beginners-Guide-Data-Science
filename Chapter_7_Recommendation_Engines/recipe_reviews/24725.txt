This is not Texas Caviar, this is a can of peas and some salsa slapped together.  If I take a can of turkey parts and some chicken broth it's not a deluxe Thanksgiving roast.

You don't cook this recipe. It's an easy cold dip. Use a good quality hot sauce - I used Archer Farms (Target brand) Organic Garden Salsa-Medium. I also subbed black beans because I like them more than blackeyes. My favorite snack is chips & hot sauce and this is a great way to add more vitamins. It's extremely versatile - you can add just about anything else that you like. Next time I will add corn, sliced avocado & a little lime juice.

I substituted pinto beans for the black-eyed peas, because that's what I had on hand.  I also used homemade salsa.  The kids and I thought it was a great after-swimming snack!
