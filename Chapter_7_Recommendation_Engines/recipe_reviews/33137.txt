"I threw some stuff together and made this." After reading that I don't know why I tried 'this'. For one thing, powdered milk and turkey should never be mixed. I did try it without the milk and it was better, but I wouldn't reccomend this recipe to those without iron stomaches.

This is a great low-carb breakfast - I make a batch once/month then slice and freeze it.  It's very satisfying and has a good taste.  I use 8-10 eggs.  I've tried lots of healthy make-ahead breakfasts over the years, this is a keeper.

It was not tasty, and didn't go down easily.
