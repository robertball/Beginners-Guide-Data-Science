My family is accustomed to the authentic Donut Shop tortas, as we live on the Mexican border. Still, they loved this recipe. I toasted birrote bread on a skillet with a bit of butter before spreading a mixture of sour cream and mayonnaise and also added onions to them. Served with steak fries.

These sandwiches are great, and very versatile.  We like to put a spicy tomato sauce over the top of ours.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicioso! Tasted just like my mama's! I toasted my bolillos in the oven for a few minutes. For my pinto beans, I bought a can and threw em in a pan with a splash of oil and half an onion, sliced. Heated them up, then mashed em. Slathered all the ingredients onto my bolillos. Folks this is key: slather. Don't be cheap. I like my Queso Fresco thinly sliced instead of crumbled but that's just me. I also really like the Daisy brand sour cream. (Sour cream is a staple in Mexican dishes so I have tasted quite a few brands). Another thing is get a nice head of lettuce, it taste so much better with big, fresh whole leaves instead of the pre-packaged thinly shredded flimsy stuff. I left out the cilantro and tomatoes. These tortas are the bomb folks.
