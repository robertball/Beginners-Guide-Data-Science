This was a very good twist to the same old everyday taco. I would eat this many times again. My daughter loves sour cream on regular tacos and loved it on this also. i also prepared the burger with onions and seasoning before I cooked it.

A great way to have a burger and cut down on carbs. It could also be changed up by using some of the other flavors of tortillas.

When I do these, I add taco seasoning to the raw ground beef before I make it into patties. My family loves it.

I made two versions of this tonight; one with ground sirloin (and 3 dashes worcestershire sauce and a sprinkle of seasonsed salt with kraft singles to melt quickly, and the other version was ground turkey with some creole seasoning and swiss cheese. Both got thumbs up!
