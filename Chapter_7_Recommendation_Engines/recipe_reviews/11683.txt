I liked this recipe.  I did change a few things though.  I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, doubled the cheese(next time i'll triple it) and added onion powder(I didn't have onion salt as someone suggested they used) It was really tasty, not dry at all. I also cooked my pasta to Al Dente so it wouldn't turn to mush.  Next time I will cook it for 30 minutes instead of 45 mins because I think that is too long.  The pasta is already cooked and the sauce is hot.  Otherwise this was yummy and I think it is a keeper!

This recipe was great! I especially liked the crunchy cheese and bread crumb topping. I added more cheese than asked for, and added 1/4 cup Monterrey Jack in the macaroni mixture, also. I added 1/2 tsp. onion salt since my husband loves that in macaroni and cheese. Sprinkle the top with fresh ground pepper. This is a keeper!

This is a great base recipe- like a blank slate. I made a lot of changes, to fit my taste. I used a pre-shredded "Italian" cheese mix, and I used the whole bag (~2cups). I also added a little gorgonzola, to punch up the flavor.  I used fresh tomatoes, not canned, and also added some steamed broccoli.  I crushed some wheat crackers for the topping. It was delicious, everyone had thirds!

Use about a hundred times more cheese than it calls for.  Even with that, fresh garlic and onion, seasoning, etc. it was still pretty bland.  I might try it again.

Not nearly as cheesy as I like Macaroni and Cheese to be. I wasn't into the bread crumbs, however I liked all the other ingredients. Next time I will add alot more cheese and milk.

Caramelized onions, diced tomatoes, and a crunchy topping make for such a delicious dish!  I tend to use recipes as mere guides, so the changes I made were:  • adding about 1/3 cup of diced American cheese to the Cheddar (makes it creamier w/o the Cheddar oils) •  a full tsp of Italian seasoning instead of 1/2 tsp •  I didn't have breadcrumbs so used dry seasoned stuffing mix The flavor was fantastic, but it was a little dry.  Next time I'm using 3/4 to 1 cup milk and cutting the baking time down to the point at which it's merely heated throughout.  Come winter this will be in my regular rotation of dishes!

Not a bad recipe as a foundation. I did not add the bread crumbs since I don't care for them. Used both sharp and mild cheddar and doubled the amount. Still came out just a little dry so will use a larger can of diced tomatoes next time. I also sprinkled bacon bits on top about 15 minutes before it came out of the oven!!! My family enjoyed it.

This recipe is okay, but in my opinion, it's not worth it. It came out really dry and I didn't like it at all.  But my husband ate it after he added a can of tomato sauce to his portion.

Very good, but not cheesy at all. Also, some of the noodles on top gor dried out and hard. I'd still make again, but with more cheese and tomatots, and garnish w/ scallions, because this was very tasty!

The flavor is awesome.  I did add the extra tomatoes per suggestions, and more cheese (tripled) - and it was still dry.  Will try again!  The flavor really is delicious.

This is a great recipe! I added 3 fresh tomatos diced and extra cheese as some people suggested. I loved the crusty topping and the warm mushy insides!  Everyone went for seconds!

I don't want to give this a bad rating because this did not come out well at all! The cheese in the sauce ended up clumping together and looked/tasted like silly putty, so I had to take it out altogether and just go with the cheese on top.

This was pretty good for my first attempt at Gluten free homemade macaroni and cheese.  I used a little more cheese than it called for and I added a can of tuna.  It was barely noticeable, but at least it added a little protein.  It was drier than creamier, but we all enjoyed it.

I skipped the breadcrumbs, but did plenty of extra mozzarella on top. I also used a can of Italian-style tomatoes instead of regular and an extra clove of garlic. This was pretty good and it's easy to already have the ingredients around. I only baked it for around 35 minutes.

Made this recipe for my family and they loved it! I recommend that the milk and diced tomatoes be doubled according to serving amount. Maybe adding a meat like sausage might give it a little more taste too.

This was good but it made a lot.  I actually made two and gave one to my parents. I liked the sauce, it was very creamy.  I'm not a huge mac & cheese fan but I will make this again.  Husband and two year old also liked it.

Turned out great with the help of the other reviewers.  I used 1 cup macaroni with 1 can diced tomatoes as many thought it was too dry.  I also used the full amount of cheddar cheese.  After adding the milk I added 1/4 tsp dry mustard and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper.  I then placed this in a casserole and baked f or 35 mins. I removed from oven and sprinkled 1/4-1/3 cheddar over top and baked for another 10 min.

Very tasty.  I also made some variations:  I tripled the cheese to equal 3 cups, and I used more garlic.  I also double the diced tomatoes and the milk.  I didn't sprinkle many bread crumbs on the top, because I'm not a huge fan of them.  I also didn't dice up butter for the top of the dish either, to save on fat and calories. 
All in all the dish turned out really well, and it's so simple to make!  It goes well with a garden salad and a glass of milk.

I really liked this I did add a 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper which gave it just a bite...I did not have enough cheddar for the top so mixed with parmessan cheese(fresh not out of the can) really gave it a crunch...I will be making this again.

Very good. I used garlic powder since I had no cloves on hand. I didn't really measure anything, but it turned out well. I added extra cheese in and on top of it. Baked for 30+ minutes.

Yum, Yum, Yummy.  I just made it.  I am eating it as i type this and it is fabulous.  This is the first time I've attempted to make mac and cheese on my own rather than opening the box and this recipe was easy  and the results are scrumptious.

My family loves this!  2 cups macaroni makes a lot, so I used 1 cup milk, 3 cups grated cheddar cheese, 2 cans chopped tomatoes, 1/4 t dry mustard, with everything else as original recipe....using rice pasta and toasted rice bread for the bread crumbs, makes a perfectly divine gluten-free recipe....thanks, lise, for a super recipe!

Made this exactly as specified in the recipe.  Results were very dry and taste was bland.  Very little cheeese taste.  Plus, sprinkling the cheese on the  top before baking is not a good idea if you are going to bake for a full 45 min as specified.  The cheese burned and hardened.  My mother used to make a wonderful mac and cheese with tomatoes, so I know that the basic idea can work, but this particullar recipe needs modification.

I only made this once, and it was pretty bland. Though as other's say: It's a good base. I will use this recipe in the future and tweak it according to some other reviews. Oh, and too little cheese used!

I added leeks & bacon to this, and I think less is more.  I would follow the recipe as is if I make it again.

This was great.  I used chopped and drained fresh tomatoes from our garden, instead of canned, and added a handful of kale.  Also, I used Panko bread crumbs.  Everyone loved it!

I doubled the cheese and added a bit more milk. This was just okay, I thought it was really bland and added chilli to my plate but my hubby enjoyed it.

This was a nice, basic recipe for me to make at the last minute to take to a dinner party.  I didn't have any diced tomatoes, nor did I have time to acquire said tomatoes, so I left 'em out and it was find.  Next time I might double the sauce, though, to make it a bit cheesier.  Went over well, though!

Since my wife died in April, I've been trying to find a recipe close to hers for this dish - this is about as close as  I've gotten with my second attempt, the first was edible but not quite right. My fault not the recipe though

I like the tomato in this dish. I used one chopped fresh tomato rather than a can of tomatoes.  The tomato makes this dish delicious. This recipe makes a small amount so you will need a small baking dish. It does need more milk and cheese.  I increased the milk and cheese by 25%. I also doubled the garlic and added freshly ground black pepper, crushed red pepper, celery flakes and chopped fresh parsley.  It works well with whole wheat pasta.  Remove the pan from the heat before you add the cheese. Also cook the pasta a touch underdone since it is going bake for 40 - 45 minutes.

My family actually loved this! (And my husband is a hard sell ;P) I took some shortcuts by using onion and garlic tomatoes and also italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I also used in total 2 cups of sharp cheddar in medium shells and they cupped nicely with cheese yumminess.

I used a 7 oz package of shredded cheese.  I left out the bread crumbs and it was still excellent.

Definitely needs a lot more cheese, double or triple.  Also could probably cook for 30 minutes instead of 45 and less bread crumbs.  Overall I was disappointed with it.

I loved this version of mac &cheese. I made it as stated with some adjustments. I was creamy & seasoned just right. 

I added approx 2Tbs. flour to the sauted onions
stirring til slightly bubbly and slightly thickened. I used two fresh diced tomatoes and increased the milk to 1 cup. I also added 1/4 c parmesean cheese & baked it for 30minutes. I'd never had it with tomatoes. Yum!
