This is a very tasty soup!  I also thought that it needed something extra, so I added a little salt, fresh groud pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper for a little kick!  I will definitely be making this again as it was very simple and fresh tasting.  If I like it well enough to make it again, it gets 5 stars in my book!

I thought this recipe was very tasty...I pretty much followed it exactly, with the exception that I used all broth instead of water and I added additional broth to thin it out.  I also let it simmer longer after all the ingredients were added, approx. 20 more minutes.  Will definitely be part of my "regulars" list.

I like adding stewed tomatoes and/or fresh cut roma tomatoes for a fresh taste.

This recipe was very easy to make and quite good. I felt it needed a little something so I added a bit of salt and some lime juice. I'll definately make this again.

I doubled the recipes with less broth and water. It was zesty and spicy. My husband and I loved it. I'll make it again soon. Thanks Pam.

Great dish, not really like a soup, for me it turned out very thick, more like chili.  Very tasty!
