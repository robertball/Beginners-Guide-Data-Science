loved this. I used brown sugar (only about a fourth of a cup) and it turned out great.

I make this every so often, not as a dessert but as a pancake/waffle/ice cream topping. I used brown sugar and a little maple flavoring instead of maple sugar and add until it's the consistancy I'm looking for. I usually will toss the bananas in a tbsp. of lemon juice before cooking.

I gave it a four, because, while it was still pretty good, I had to make a huge adjustment: the Sugar. 1 cup was entirely too much. I didn't have maple sugar, so I used brown sugar (not even 1/4 cup).  I also added a few drops of lemon to the brown sugar mixture as it cooked.  I had mine with vanilla ice cream, and it was great!

This is G-O-O-D!  I thought a cup of sugar would have been way to sweet so I added 2 TBS in all and it was just right.  My husband and I immediately started thinking of things we could put it on like french toast, pancakes, vanilla yogurt, ice cream, shortcake, well you get the idea.  Great little treat.

Made as written except I used a small amount of brown sugar instead of maple sugar.  Great warm on top of homemade waffles.

I used brown sugar instead of the maple sugar.  I didn't have any maple extract either so I added a bit of vanilla.  Also used 3 bananas and just topped it with the brown sugar-didn't add a cup.  Also tossed bananas in lemon juice as someone suggested.  This was a very yummy topping to add to my homemade crepes.  Would probably work well with several different kinds of fruits.

I only made it for one but I can see it being good for ice cream or pancakes but, I didn't like it by itself, but it is quick and easy

I used 3 bananas and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  It was DELICIOUS on our waffles this morning!  I think with a touch of rum, it would be yummy on ice cream for adults - sort of a bananas foster type topping.

I loved this! I used dark brown sugar instead of maple sugar, but it still turned out fantastic. My roommate and I couldnâ€™t stop eating it!
