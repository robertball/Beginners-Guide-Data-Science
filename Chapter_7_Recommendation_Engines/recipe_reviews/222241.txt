Super easy, and excellent for a slow carb or low carb diet. I added a little white wine vinegar to mine. Super for a fast side dish or cold salad. I made it for lunch and plan on having it as a side for dinner tonight. I think it maybe better served cold. 

** if you chop your parsley then rinse it well in a cheese cloth or paper towel , it creates a better flavor/texture for the food.

I was looking for a really simple and fresh recipe with beans and I'm so glad I stumbled upon this one.  It was exactly what I was looking for! The only thing I omitted was the olive oil because I didn't want the extra fat and I only used half a lemon for my super picky kids. I love lemon and I'm sure adding the entire lemon would have made the bean salad even more delicious.  Thanks for a keeper of a recipe!

Love this bean salad! I have made it multiple times now and it is always great. Added a little red wine vinegar last time and it turned out amazing. It gets better as it marinates in the fridge. Sometimes I put this on a pita with hummus. To die for!

I made this for a luncheon with girlfriends, & it was a hit! Had some left, and added cut up zucchini, summer squash & some feta. This will be a go-to  recipe for sure!

You can't go wrong with these simple ingredients. I enjoyed the fresh uncomplicated taste of the parsley and lemon. Ideal to serve along summer grilled meats/fish. Some of my kidney beans didn't hold up as well but it still tasted great.

I agree w/others about it being a terrific base. As always, I made it according to the directions the first time, and it could use a kick of something, but enjoyed it as is.

This is great tasting, healthy side dish  for the fish or roasted chicken I prepare. Even works on its own, I just throw a little feta cheese on it before I serve it up.

I thought this was boring until I added a jar (drained) of artichoke hearts and a yummy orange pepper and it really helped! Will definitely make this one again!

I love the fact that there is no sugar....It's light, yet filling.  Perfect for a quick dinner when no one feels like cooking, or don't want to be over a hot sweltering stove!  Great recipe!

Simple and easy.  I used two lemons for the sauce though because there was not enough flavour with only 1,  Nice for summer to serve over a bed of salad greens.  With a bit of bread the you have a nice summer lunch.

Very refreshing and light.  Had the ingredients handy, saved me this morning for my work potluck.  Will make again and add the feta or try with avocado, I am sure will be even tastier.

Good and easy. Could have a used a little more flavor (more garlic maybe?), but it was still tasty.

I liked this recipe a lot. It was very easy to make. I did however make a couple changes, before I juiced my lemon I zested it and threw that in, I used fresh basil and purple basil, and instead of olive oil I used grape seed oil. I got a huge compliment when my mom told me I learned well after she tried it!

This salad looked simple and delicious, so I had to try it.  My concern was that the garlic and onion would overpower this disk.  Wrong!!  I really liked the balance of flavors. My 11 year-old loved it too!!

This recipe is AWESOME! I had cilantro only and it tasted like heaven. Since preparing takes a flash, I decided to mix everything and let it marinate for a few hours.  The result was absolutely delicious and satisfying. I served as a side for the Grilled Halibut with Cilantro Butter. Excellent dinner combo will make it again!

I liked the fresh taste that the parsley adds to this recipe. I added some crumbled feta on top to finish it off. I served the bean salad over some vegetable enriched spaghetti in pesto sauce. The combination of flavors worked well.

I am a bean salad fan, but of all the bean salads I've had in my life, this ranks in the bottom tier. It wasn't horrible, and my wife rated it higher than me. I would prepare this again as a decent side dish, particularly as a heart healthy recipe.

Very tasty bean salad.  I used green beans instead of the garbanzo beans (intense dislike) and replaced with fresh blanched green beans.  I did use 2 cloves of garlic but next time I'll only use one (or use two small cloves) as garlic overtook the salad.  Very light and refreshing.

Simple and easy to prepare. I added one can of Mir Glen diced organic fire roasted tomatoes to the ingredients! and a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Great on a warm sunny day.
