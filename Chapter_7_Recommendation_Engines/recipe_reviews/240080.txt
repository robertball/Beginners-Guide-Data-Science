This recipe yielded very good hot chocolate! But, the directions didn't work very well. I set my coco for 2 minutes in the microwave and after about 1:30 it started bubbling over and getting sugary milk everywhere! It was pretty sticky and messy, so I suggest setting your drink for a shorter time. However, the end result was tasty, so 4 stars for me!

I felt that 1/4 cup of sugar to 2/3 milk seemed like WAY too much sugar, so I cut the sugar back to 1 tablespoon, which was plenty sweet enough.  This was quick and tasty, and just what I needed to warm me up! Thanks for the recipe!

I used chocolate milk, teaspoon of sugar & a little bit of vanilla & it taste just like normal hot chocolate. Iâ€™m sure if i had chocolate syrup then i would of tried the normal recipe.
