Decided to roast and carrots and brussel sprouts because my husband is a huge fan. I should have started the carrots first.  Delicious though! :)

I followed recipe as written and was very satisfied with the results.  The flavors of the vegetables and the citrus blended well and it made a terrific side dish.  Will definitely make again

LOVE this recipe. I did use nonfat plain yogurt instead of butter, basil instead of parsley and I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I steamed frozen carrots and sprouts.  My husband does not eat sprouts but he ate 2 servings of this recipe. As you eat it, the flavors are layered making it very special.

Delicious! I added lemon juice from half a lemon and generous amounts of cracked pepper. Instead of plain old hot sauce I used siracha (rooster sauce)- a thick garlicky 5 alarm hot sauce-about a teaspoon and people RAVED. I'm making it again tonight-twice in a week!

Really tasty side dish! Just the right amount of orange flavor. Next time I will probably use a bit less butter.

Great recipe!  Followed as written, minus the hot sauce.  Flavorful, and was a hit in the home!  Will definitely make again!

Surprisingly Perfect! My sister and I both brought brussel sprouts to Easter. (we obviously didn't check in). Hers had bacon and lots of goodness and mine was tasty, refreshing, and surprisingly the favored dish! Thanks for this recipe.

I used frozen brussel sprouts instead of fresh and dried parsley (it was all I had). Omitted the salt and used butter.

I love brusselsprouts but have only ever had them steamed with some butter and salt and pepper. I tried this and I absolutely loved it! The orange made it really fresh and bright. I think it would make a perfect side dish for Easter.

Served this with Thanksgiving dinner this year. It was pretty good although I think there was way too much butter, it all congealed in the bottom of the bowl after an hour or so, so the bottom few layers were drowning in butter. Great flavours though and we will make again!

Great and easy recipe. Added more hot sauce than suggested but I also like things spicy. Next morning, I had some leftovers so I mixed this with some scrambled eggs -- delicious!

Made this tonight and really enjoyed the orange flavor. I didn't use the hot sauce, but otherwise made it according to the recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I doubled this recipe for our Christmas dinner this year.  Even my husband who claims not to like brussels sprouts enjoyed it.  I didn't have enough zest, so I added a squeeze of orange juice.  Thanks, Sherri.  This one's a keeper.

My family loved this recipe.  I didn't have fresh beansprouts so I substituted with frozen ones, thawing them enough in the microwave so I could slice them.  I tossed the veggies in the pan with a small amount of butter before adding the water.  My family prefers no orange as it is very strong but both ways got eaten up quickly! :)

I followed the recipe with one exception.  I used fewer carrots and steamed some cauliflower on top of the brussel sprouts and carrots after they had cooked for awhile.  My family turned up their nose at the recipe but everyone loved it!  I will definitly make this again.  It is easy and delicious.

This was great. Prepared it as written, turned out great. Was such a nice change to the usual 'corn' at a Christmas dinner.

My husband actually enjoyed eating sprouts when I made this recipe. It's sweet and tangy. Very good!
