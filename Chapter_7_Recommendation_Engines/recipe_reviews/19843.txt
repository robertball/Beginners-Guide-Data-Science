I think the key mistake in the recipe instructions is where it says to boil the potatoes for 2 minutes. After I read of the problems some were having with the baking time and the results being too dry, I tried boiling the potatoes for 20 minutes. This worked out fine!

I made this recipe two times.  The first time, I followed the directions exactly and the dish came out a little too bland for me.  The second time, I boiled the potatoes in beef broth for about 5 minutes.  I followed the directions to the rest of the recipe exept I added a little worshestire sauce to the potatoes and onions before I put them in the oven.

VERY tasty! A bit time consuming, but not difficult at all. I didn't have any problems with the dish being underdone. I did boil my sliced potatoes for more than 2 minutes, but nowhere near the 20 suggested by some, 5 minutes was plenty. Don't be scared by the quantity of 4 onions (I thought it sounded like WAY too much on reading the recipe), when properly caramelized they cook down to a much smaller volume.

The potatoes are marvelous. However, you do need to bake in the over much longer than the 12 mins advised. I baked for over a half hour.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I did not experience the problems of undercooked potatoes, however, I added the potatoes to COLD water and then brought to boil - they were cooked perfectly.  Also I added about 1/2 cup of crumbled goat cheese (layered throughout).  I cooked for 25 minutes with the lid on, and then finished it for about 5 minutes with the lid off.

Very good side dish. I had these at a fancy steakhouse and my husband has asked for them since. I did omit alot of prep steps to save time. I added all the ingredients to a 13x9 casserole dish, covered with foil and baked for 1 hour at 350.

This is good. I make mine the same way, except I don't boil the potaotes beforehand. I chop the potatoes instead of slicing and I add beef broth to  the pan, cover the pan and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. They turn out great everytime. Its good with shallots too!

Simple and delicious side dish.  I baked mine for about 35 minutes to brown the potatoes more.  It sounds like a lot of butter, but it made the dish all the yummier.

Yum yum yum! Again, I boiled the potatoes for far longer than suggested and as always I used far more garlic! Delicious and easy to make.

Pretty good. They turned out a little underdone. Next time I will boil the potatoes for 5 - 10 minutes and drizzle half of the butter over the top. Also, adding some cheese would be good.

This was a great recipe. I prepared the potatoes and onions in advance, then baked it in a casserole dish for 25 min. I also added several shakes each of dried thyme, sage, and oregano. My family loved this.

Just can't match up to the Ruth's Chris style lyonnaise potatoes....Will definitely leave white pepper out...totally unncessary. Tried making a few times. I boiled potatoes for 10 minutes, and cooked all ingredients for 30 minutes. Rich and creamy, but it just isn't Ruth's Chris style : (

A little bland.  I think I might try it again and add lots more seasoning. Also, garlic burns and becomes bitter if you cook it for that long.

pretty good, added some chopped garlic to the carmelized onion, cooked the potatoes a little longer and cooled them completely, then cooked in a non stick pan on top of the stove not in the oven, these should be crisp on the ouside ..

The timing for the potatoes is definitely off as is the amount of potatoes. I ended up turning the whole thing into mashed potatoes which my husband liked very much. Since they were already dairy with the butter, I added some cheese and milk of course... I can't say I will try this again but I will make this new mashed potato invention.

I left the taters in the hot water for a bit(burner off)  and between that and frying them a bit in the pan they were done so I skipped the oven.  Stirred everything all together and just left them on low in the skillet and tossed now and again while waiting for everything else to be done. Didn't peel because my taters were tiny.

I really liked this recipe. I used frozen hashbrowns for this recipe, which made is REALLY easy. I thawed the harshbrowns slowly in the microwave first, while I was sweating the onions. (which took closer to 30 minutes) I also baked it for close to an hour so that the top of the hashbrowns started to get crispy. The carmelized onion gave the side dish really good flavor. I would make this again!

Great recipe, goes well with cordon bleu. Only thing I did differently was baking it in the oven in a casserole style dish. My advice: The layers aren't so important, so start with layers of onions and potato, but stir it every 5-10 minutes and bake at the top of the oven. Took a good 40 minutes for us, unless you parboil the potatoes to death before baking

This was very good, I also left the dish in the oven in order to get the potatoes nice and crispy.  Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and add some feta cheese.

Made it for serving 10 - 2 cast iron pans - the 10" pan was gluten-free (used vegan butter).   We peeled approx. 4lb russet potatoes and cut in 1/4 in slices.  It takes a long time for potatoes to reach boil...so when it finally reaches boiling...it's about time to pull off the stovetop for phase 2 - baking. So, the 2 min as suggested in the recipe is spot on.
 The potatoes should be par boiled at this point.

I caramelized the onions  - nice and slow (approx. 15  minutes )  and added garlic after browning onions a bit first - so garlic is not burned.  

We had enough potato for 2 layers in each pan...the third layer was a stretch...I'd buy an extra pound to get the third layer in.  The six 3" onions  and 1.5 head garlic allowed a generous carmelized onion and garlic layer (yummy).  

Baking time was a half hour, convection roast - 400 degrees...it came out bubbling and crispy brown in places.    Easily reheated later at the intended pot luck consumption location at 300 degrees for 40 minutes .  

They were a big hit among all.  Thank you!! This is a keeper!

We had these for dinner tonight -- so good!  1) I boiled my potatoes for about 10 minutes. 2) I sloooowwww cooked my onions on a super low heat (the key to making good, sweet caramelized onions). 3) I added paprika to the butter, and use white pepper (I also added some Tony Cachere's because we like a little spice to our food). Go ahead and dump the potatoes and onions all at once to the melted butter and stir. 4) Add a splash of chicken broth while they're baking then stir. One last tip: definitely keep the skin on the potatoes!

It's like Emeril's, but he slices the potatoes very thin which could account for the shorter blanche time. Classic, yummy!

Thank you for the recipe! We had them yesterday for dinner and they were soo good! I did boil the potatoes a bit longer though. My husband really liked it!

I made this for my elderly French neighbor who grew up in Normandy. She was skeptical of my doing French cooking, but this recipe won her over.  Potatoes do need to be baked much longer than recipe calls for, as others have said here also.

I enjoyed this simple dish; it was a nice complement to my Frech dinner. However, I suggest cutting the amount of butter in half.

This recipe was terrific.  However, I left it in the oven longer than suggested.  I like potatoes done crisper and the oven prepared them to my expectations.  Everyone Loved Them!
Will make again

I boiled the potatoes until they were almost done and then baked the dish in the oven for 20 minutes and it came out fine.  Nothing really unique about this recipe and I wanted something a little different than just a dish of potatoes so I baked in individual oven proof serving dishes and when they were done I sprinkled them with Potato Toppers.

I found that the dish needed baking for more like 30 minutes rather than the 10 to 12 suggested. THe potatoes were still hard after that amount of time. Perhaps the initial cooking should be longer that 2 minutes. Otherwise, delicious, although we ended up eating them for dessert!

This was very tasty, but did not turn out quite the way I thought it would. The top potatoes were a bit dry and not crunchy.

These potatoes were really good.  My only problem was that they wouldn't brown until I put them under the broiler for a few minutes. Thanks for the recipe.

I’ve previously made Lyonnaise Potatoes but couldn’t find that awesome recipe and thought this sounded similar, so thought I’d give it a try. I made a couple of changes because a few things didn’t sound quite right. First, 4 onions seemed like way to much, so I only used 3 medium-sized ones, but even that was way too much. Then, 2 minute boiling time is definitely not right. I boiled until easily pierced with a fork, which ended up being 20 min.  I will not be making this recipe again but will hunt down my previous one because it was so much better.

I found that I had to bake this dish much longer than the stated time.  Perhaps my potatoes were sliced too thickly but they did not seem to be done until the dish had been in the oven about half an hour.

My mom made these in an electric skillet. She called them "pan potatoes " and would have been stunned to learn she was making Pommes Lyonnaise. I've made them Mom's way for about 40 years. Tried this way tonight. Good flavor but not as good as my mom's. Going back to the skillet.

I make this regularly with minor changes. I do not boil, I just put it all into a oven container lined with foil (easy cleanup) and a lid. The lid is important in my opinion to keeping the potatoes from drying out from the longer cooking time I use instead of boiling. I also use yukon golds or reds since they cook up much nicer.

This is a good starter recipe.  I made it as directed at first except with 2 large onions, which was enough, and it wasn't nearly done after baking 10 minutes.  

Using a cast iron skillet, I caramelized the onions for 30 minutes, starting on medium-high for 15 minutes, then turned to medium-low for 15 minutes.  I then added the minced garlic to the onions and cooked for 2-3 minutes until fragrant, stirring constantly to avoid burning the garlic.  After assembling,  I baked for 20 minutes, then stirred the whole thing as the tops of the potatoes were not browning at all ( the bottoms were browning, however).  I stirred once more during baking until 30 minutes passed.  I then stirred and broiled on high for 4 minutes, stirred and broiled another 4 minutes to get it crispy.  

The changes I will make next time will be to use 1TBSP minced fresh garlic and half the butter.  While delicious, this recipe was extremely rich and just too heavy to finish my portion.  I might even slice the potatoes into much thinner layers using a mandolin.  Overall it's really good and I will be making this again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe Michele!

Boiling for 2 minutes did not make any sense.  I boiled the potatoes for about 20 minutes.  I used one large onion and 1 tablespoon of garlic.   12 minutes of baking did not brown the potatoes.  You need to place them under the broiler to brown them.  I will try this again, maybe adding chives or other seasonings as well.

Made the recipe as written. We liked it quite a bit, and I'll definitely make it again... but I think next time I'll cut back on the butter a bit. I think I'll also bake it a bit longer. The potatoes were cooked and tender, but didn't really brown at all.

Very good recipe. I did listen to the other user comments and I boiled the potatoes for about 8 minutes instead of the prescribed 2. Everything came out really well otherwise. I will say that it makes the dish look visually better if you leave the skin on, but I'm not sure how that would affect the flavour. Overall, though The onions and garlic really make this dish a great side for a wide variety of meals.

I really liked it but I did think there was too much onion.  I've made it a few times and either used two small onions or one large one.  I have also been adding sliced carrots just to give something a little extra to it.  Overall I really enjoyed it though!

First of all, this is not a quick fix side dish, but it's well worth it.  My husband rated as 5 stars, but I gave it 4.  After reading the reviews, I did boil potatoes for 10 minutes and they were cooked throughout.  Will definitely make again.

This was really tasty...I did add extra garlic and reduced the butter (to reduce fat) and they came out very flavorful. I also boiled the potatoes longer based on the other reviews, and sliced the potatoes a little thinner than 1/2 inch to satisty personal preference. I will be making this again!

This is a good basic recipe. Next time though I will follow the advice of some others to spice it up a little and maybe even add a little cheese on top.

I followed this recipe exactly except I used just a couple of Tbsp of olive oil instead of butter when layering the potatoes and onions; I also used an extra clove of garlic.  The end result was pretty boring.  I think if this dish was cooked on the stove top, it would allow the potatoes on the bottom to get crispy and the dish would be a lot more tasty as a result.  Also, next time I will use the butter as I think it's integral for flavour, but it's not likely that I will use 1/2 cup!

This was just ok. One tip though would be to bring the potatoes to boil and just let them sit in the water while preparing the onions, that way you won't have to bake longer.  I think I'll just stick with scalloped potatoes, its easier (at least for me).

These are a good staple recipe for grilling season.  I like to put a little shredded swiss on top and finish them off under the broiler.

These were great potatoes. I have always put onions in my potatoes, but the spices kicked it up and made it so much more tasty. Thanks.

Great side with Chicken Cordon Bleu! Could use a little less garlic (but just a little less), or instead of chopped garlic, try it with minced garlic. Otherwise VERY yummy!

For a long time I have been searching for my lost recipe for Lyonnaise Potatoes.  After trying this, I will keep searching. Although it was merely good, it not my old favorite.

This came out awesome. I didn't use onions, but put in a little onion powder and it was good. Will make again.

These were only so-so for me, probably won't make again.  They were too greasy for my taste, and I would rather just have scalloped potatoes.  The onions were good, however.

I agree with the other reviewers:  you need to boil them longer (till almost soft) and bake them longer (till almost crispy).  Nonetheless, these potatoes were fantastic!  How can something with so much butter and olive oil be bad?  We absolutely loved them, but will make them rarely (sadly) as they were dripping in butter.  Mmm.
