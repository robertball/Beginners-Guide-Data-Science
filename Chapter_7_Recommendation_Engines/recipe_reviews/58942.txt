The tips in this recipe are great for making really tender liver. But the milk takes away *too* much of that liver taste that I actually like, leaving me with a pan of rather bland liver. It's great if you're trying to get your kids to eat liver, but as someone who actually likes liver, I think I'll forgo the milk next time.

I can barely force liver down usually and it's the only food I've ever found my husband won't eat.  Pregnant, on a strict budget and told by my midwife I had to eat liver once a week, I despaired.  I cannot thank you enough for this recipe!  I actually enjoyed it, got my husband to try it and marked liver off the list as the only food he won't eat!  You're a miracle worker!  I only had time to soak the liver for about thirty minutes this time, so I can't wait to try it next time, when I'll soak it all day first.  Man, thank you!!!

My dad is a huge fan of liver and onions and when mom is out of the house this is the time I can make it for him. The smell of buttery onions makes your mouth water and appretite build up! It comes out delish! Just make sure not to over cook, I take it out a few minutes before its done to his likeing because it does cook while off the heat for a few moments anyhow! Calves live is the most tender, but if you marinate in milk most of the day (which I do) and not flip it more than needed you will have a nice tender liver that will melt in your mouth, well atleast cut with a butter knife *smile*

Add some cold water into the leftover flour, mix it up, and then add it to the liver and onions pan, once you have removed the liver and onions. It will make a delicous gravy. Then toss the liver and onions back into the pan, and simmer for a few minutes. Serve over rice.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I added a little garlic to the pan before I fried the onions, and that gave it a really nice flavour.

mmmmmm! this realy is the best recipe for liver.  I had never thought of soaking in milk before.  When I tried it last night it came out fantastic.  It was tender, moist and delicious.  Not the usual "shoeleather" quality that liver can sometimes take on.  Yes I belive this recipe will convert liver haters into liver tryers.

Great recipe!  My husband raved about the liver.  I was a little hesitant since I hadn't cooked liver in over 15 years.  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of the butter.

I made this last night for dinner at the request of my fiance.  I have to admit, liver has never been my favorite dish, and I've never made it before, but this recipe was so easy, and it's true, the milk takes out all of the bitter taste.  If it was good enough that I cleaned my plate, it deserves 5 stars!!

This rating comes from hubby, although I did give it a little taste and I must admit that it was pretty good. He came home with calves liver, which I've never cooked, so I was happy to find this recipe. I never would have thought to soak it in milk. He absolutely LOVED this "J" and thanks so much!

Great recipe overall...love seeing the soaking in milk step like I have always done.  I saw Julia Child do that years ago and knew how important it is but I am amazed at how many people just fry it right out of the pack and then complain of the strong taste! A great tip by the way, since you are already doing the caramelized onions, do a huge batch up and make onion marmalade to can a jar or two.  Back to the recipe at hand, the only complaint I have with the directions is that someone who hasn't cooked liver before really needs to understand what is done. Liver is much like steak in that by the time it gets to the completely done stage, it gets tough since it keeps cooking after you  pull it off the heat.  You really need to pull it off when it's still slightly pink and that's if you want it completely done...we prefer it pinkish for tenderness.  Also, you need to add the onions back BEFORE it's done for this same reason.  The time given is actually too long...for the average thickness the way most is packaged, four to five minutes is plenty of time in a medium/hot pan. I also recommend adding some garlic powder to the flour dredging mixture or some seasoned salt.  To really send this recipe off the charts, make a gravy out of the drippings left in the pan...not too thick, and serve it on the side but it is awesome poured right over the top and served with some thick biscuits.

This dish was fantastic. I only soaked the liver while the onions cooked as I prefer the strong liver flavor. After cooking, I added 1 cup of beef broth to the pan drippings and cooked until the liquid had reduced by a little more than half. I then added the onions and the liver back to the pan. The remaining liquid thickened nicely to make a delicious gravy. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I've always love liver and onions when it was made correctly by other people, but I never liked my own.  Thanks to this recipe, that has changed.  Soaking the liver in milk really did take out most of the bitterness of the liver.  Plus, I was overcooking my liver.  Wow, some simple tips that really make all the difference in the world.  With the price of meat escalating these days, cooking cheaper foods competently is a crucial skill.  Truth be told, I'd prefer a good calf's liver to a ribeye any day.  Thanks for the help!

Nice recipe. Have never found a beef liver recipe that wasn't better w/calf's liver. Flour mix was a bit bland, so this time used some garlic powder and hot Hungarian paprika in the flour mix. With a bit more time, I'd try some other spices but was rushed tonight; milk soak about 30 min. but sufficient. I regard the milk soak as optional for flavor (agree with one reviewer that it sucks a bit too much of the liver flavor out), but REALLY necessary for getting the flour to stick! The "don't turn it" advice is great; I've always stirred and fidgeted with it before, which messes up the coating and mushes up the liver. TURN ONCE. Onions were great; tossed in a splash of some white wine for no reason other than I was drinking it - don't think it added or detracted! Wife thought it was very good, too. We both grew up in very different backgrounds - as huge liver fans. I used to have a pet owl growing up (really) - he liked liver, too, except RAW. Ewwwwwwww.

My wife used to buy Liver twice a year (neither one of us like liver) we would eat a little of it and toss the rest in the bin. When asked why? she bought it, she replied it had great Iron content. Let me say this and make it crystal clear since finding your recipe,we now have liver every "WEEK" and there are no leftovers. Thanks for sharing

I've fixed liver & onions this way for many years.  As some others have mentioned, I add a little garlic.  After the liver is dredged in flour and in the pan and turned the first time, I put about of cup of the left over flour in there ... really!  Just dump it in and cook along with the liver and onions.  Viola!  Yummy gravy.  

Of course with that great gravy, one needs homemade mashed potatoes.  A perfect meal.

This was a great liver recipe. It was simple and the directions were easy to follow. One tip I read elsewhere is to make sure the membrane is cut off and cut 1/8th inch slits every inch near the side, so the liver wont curl up.

Since my wife don't like liver, I thought the milk soak would change her mind. Nope, she still didn't care for it. And since I grew up eating liver with a strong flavor, the milk soak extracted the flavor I appreciate. However, the temperature guidelines this recipe gave me reduced the temperatures I had been using for the onions and the liver leaving me with a better texture of both. My second attempt with this recipe, I eliminated the milk soak, seasoned the liver directly before breading it instead of adding the seasoning to the flour, and doubled the butter amount to keep enough moisture in the skillet to simmer the onions and cook the liver. The end result was the best liver & onions I have ever fixed. Next time I'm going to try adding a slight amount of cooking oil instead of doubling on the butter. Oh yeah, the liver I cooked with this recipe was venison liver.

Oh so good!!  We already like liver but this was especially yummy!  It was very flavorful and tender. I followed the recipe as written exceptI only soaked it in milk for 30 minutes. I fried some bacon slices first and set aside to break over the top later. I sauteed a couple fresh mushrooms with the onions. The liver, the sauteed onions and mushrooms, and the bacon pieces all piled on a serving platter made for a yummy meal with mashed potatoes, and ketchup on the side for dipping. I followed the suggestion to mix leftover flour with water in the frying pan to take advantage of all the flavorful pan drippings and this made a good gravy for the potatoes. I plan to repeat this method again!

I grew up loving liver and onions but was never successful at making it until trying this easy recipe. I've made it using both butter to fry in or oil. . . use butter, it makes a big difference!  There's nothing quite like the wonderful sweet flavor of perfectly carmelized onions as a companion to the great taste of perfectly seasoned liver.  I always make enough for my brother-in-law too since our wives won't cook liver for us.  This one's a keeper!

Made this tonight. Letting the liver soak in the milk is the key. Wonderful! this recipe is so easy, you don't even need to save it. I cooked the liver approx. 3 mins. each side.  I made a gravy with chicken broth, some fat from the pan and flour. I returned the liver to the pan with the gravy just before serving. I did both onions and bacon. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe. I am a big liver and onions fan so I'll eat it any way it comes out, but the milk is magic. It even improved the texture which a lot of people dislike. If you're making liver and onions, this IS the recipe!

This is a great recipe for liver! Learned it from my Russian wife whose mother makes it. The only difference is that I add a bit of sour cream after the liver has browned and let it simmer to taste.

I made this for my Husband and Son last night and between the two they ate a whole pound of fried livers and onions. They said it was great.

I am a recently retired butcher, and "fresh" liver is hard to come by these days, so I don't have it very often. With Deer & Elk season in full swing right now, I am busy helping friends & neighbors with a very bountiful harvest this year, and this recipe is absolutely fantastic with fresh game liver. I've made it 3 times so far. My 78 year old Dad thinks that it is the closest recipe to my late Mother's. That is a heck of a compliment coming from him! Thank You!

Cooked  this recipe today and was sooo impressed at how fantastic this came out.  I have tried so many times to make Liver & Onions for years - just to throw them away but not anymore because they came out perfect from this recipe.  So no more going out to get great liver & onions, I can now cook them myself.....Thanks so much

I made this for supper last night. OMGosh, it was so good. I followed the recipe exactly as written only adding some garlic powder to the flour.. Just wonderful. So tender. The husband loved it. Took left overs for lunch today. Thanks, will be making again soon.

I don't eat liver, don't care for it but my husband loves it.  I made this recipe for his (without my own tasting) and he LOVED it!  I added garlic salt, paprika and pepper to the flour, didn't turn them but once and also did the bacon with the onions.  I did the milk soak for about 40 minutes, used beef calves livers.  I will definitely make this again or at least teach him how to make it!

This was my first time cooking liver, and this recipe served for a great template.  I cooked up some bacon first, and then sauteed the sliced onions in the bacon grease.  Drained and padded them both with paper towels before warming them back up alongside the liver.  Utterly delish.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I will only use it to make liver for our kids.  As my husband and I ate it, we noticed the strong liver flavor was missing.  We grew up with that flavor and LIKE it.  LOL!!  So, we will not soak our liver in milk, but will always do the children's.  (I just can't believe the milk is so effective in getting rid of that flavor.) I'm glad to have found this for the kids!

Great recipe.  I cut down the soak time in milk to just 15 minutes because I like the unique taste of liver.  I also used calves liver because of the tenderness.  A little trick my mom taught me that always helps is to take a meat tenderizer and hit the meat just a very little to make it even more tender.  The dish was just perfect.

Use Beef Liver not Baby Beef Liver for more flavor and better texture.
This recipe is what I've used for many years and liver lovers love it.

This was fantastic! I haven't made this is years and had just bought some liver as a lark. I had to look up how to cook it and this was the first recipe that came up. I didn't' have any milk just half and half so I used that and added a bit of water to make milk? I only had a few minutes to soak it too.  I sent some over to my neighbor too and he called raving about it too! Thanks!

Very good.  I fried up some bacon and quickly brown the liver on both sides in bacon grease as well as the onions.  I then placed the liver, onions and chopped bacon in the oven covered with aluminum foil at 350 for 20 minutes.  It came out very tender.  I will be making this again.  My kids and nephew had never had liver, Loved it!

While I don't think I will ever be a liver lover, I did want to cook it for my husband because he loves it. My children who until now refused to eat it because I had never wanted too, loved my "country fried steak"! And even I thought it was better than the rest of the times I've tried it. Their dad asked how they liked the country fried liver and onions and they were a little shocked but decided that they were still crazy about it! Which is great because it's cheap! And we're on a budget! My mother-in-law told me that that is why she fed my hubby and sis-in-law liver so often when they were growing up. PLUS, it's good for you.
But I still won't eat more than a bite!

Hi there, I've never made liver before in my life but I had to for my boyfriend because he's having surgery and needs to build up his hemoglobin, so the poor boy needs lots of iron! His mother would make liver for him once a month as a child and he thinks it's awful stuff. I made him this and he loved, loved loved it! It was tender (milk?) and perfect and I even loved it too! The onions made all the difference and I also added a wee bit of rosemary to the liver (since I was using it in my roasted potatoes) and that was perfect. My mom used some dijon mustard for dipping and that helped her. Thanks for this, truly wonderful and simple!!!

I love the advice to soak in milk. I love eating liver, but I can only stand the liver taste maybe once or twice a *year*. So when we do it this way I can eat it more often, which is great because I need the extra iron.

I made this last night & it was truly fabulous! I had 5 other recipes to choose from, but the soaking in milk facinated me. It's very simple & cook time is quick! Just keep J's 3 tips in mind & I did soak the liver for about 2 hrs prior. I will definately add this to our fav dinners list

This may be a a four or five star recipe, but my family would be generous to give one star.  Did not turn them into converts; I remember liking liver as a child, but did not like this.  I did, however, put the onions on bread and that was quite tasty.

I hate liver. I grew up hating liver. The taste use to make me throw up. This recipe has officially converted me. The milk is what does the trick. The first time I cooked it, I soaked it for more than 5 hours. The second time, because I didn't have any time it was only for 20 minutes. I couldn't eat it the second time, but the first time was absolutely delicious.

This is a fantastic recipe. I hate liver, but my husband loves it. I decided to try this recipe for him and he complained that it didn't taste as much like liver. But I was able to eat some and it tasted okay to me. I would say that this recipe produces a much milder flavor for the liver.

Since my husband hates liver, I waited until this evening when he had to go out to make this for myself.  I halved the recipe...other than that, I didn't change a thing.  What a treat this was!  A relaxing evening at home with one of my favorite meals - and no one complaining about the "liver smell."  I truly enjoyed this dish.

I usually never go back to a web site after trying a recipe to describe my cooking experience, but after trying this recipe I knew I just had to!!  For years I had just one liver and onion recipe...I made it over and over again, year after year. I decided to google something new and I'm so glad I did! This is the best liver dish I have ever tasted! My husband could not stop saying how much he loved it. The only thing I changed was the flour, I used gluten free and used 1 cup.  I also added a bit of vegetable broth at the end, and I was so glad to just use a bit, because it would have taken away  the crunchy bite the liver had to it.  Can't wait to make it again!

I made this for my husband today and he said it was delicious. Tender liver with  great flavors.  I did add a little olive oil with the butter so that it did not burn, used red onions (Vidalia would have worked great too) and added a touch of minced garlic to the pan a couple of minutes before serving.  If you do add garlic be careful not to add to soon as garlic burns quickly.  I served the liver with scrambled eggs and new potatos for brunch.  Next time I'll serve with sauted Shitake mushrooms as well.  This is a great recipe...thanks for sharing.

This was our first experience with liver and even then only because my son requested it.  We all decided that this would be a once a year meal for us.  We agreed we like the recipe it's just the liver we had issues with. :)

This is an excellent recipe. I am not a liver fan and my kids would  never eat it so when my last one went off to college, I surprised my husband with this dish. We both enjoyed it and I will make it again! I did buy good quality liver from the farmer's market even though we are on a budget as it was relatively inexpensive. Thanks for sharing!

Couldn't stand liver until this recipe came along!It totally eliminates that nasty bite liver leaves long after you've eaten it.The only thing different I do is stab up my liver once it's in the milk, and that seems to work out well.I've let the liver sit in the milk from 10 minutes to over night.Doesn't matter how long it sits it does the same job.

The milk makes the liver great.  Try buttermilk also...even better.  When I use buttermilk I soak all day and periodically pour out the old buttermilk and pour in fresh.  Then I use some of the buttermilk at the end to make a pan gravy.  Fabulous!

I had never had beef liver before. My husband had it as a child and didn't like it.  We recently purchased a side of beef and it came with several packages of beef liver, so I decided to try it.  I used this recipe.  I had porkchops planned as a backup for our dinner if we didn't like this.  Needless to say we didn't need the porkchops.  We were both pleasantly surprised that we liked it.  It was not too strong and very tender.

Hmmm...how do I review this?  I had (note...past tense) a childhood memory of actually liking liver.  So when I was given some to cook, I made this.  The house smelled wonderful, the onions looked beautiful, but then...I tasted it.  It's a strange flavor; I think if you like livers, this could be a good recipe.  But even after dousing it with ketchup, no go.  So I can't really say it's a bad recipe since I believe this is all about personal preferences.  But I cannot rave about it either.

I will NOT eat liver and am not real fond of cooking it but I will a couple times a year for my husband. He LOVED this recipe and, for whatever reason, it didn't seem to smell as offensive to me when i was cooking at as liver usually does!  He may actually get liver more often now!

I have always hated liver, but my husband loves it. I needed to learn how to cook it. When I found this, it even smelled better before I cooked it. Now he wants to know why do I cook liver every week.

I fried up some bacon first.  Used the drippings to sauté the onions. I like liver so the milk soaking isn't necessary next time.   I also took other reviewers advice and made a gravy after cooking the liver. Just don't over cook the liver. I purposefully under cooked the liver. Made the gravy -scraped the pan, added the water/flour mixture to the pan, added beef bullion cube because I didn't want to open a carton of stock for a small amount of flavor. Simmered for a few minutes to cook off the flour. Took off the heat. Returned the chops, onions, and bacon to the pan. Left it covered for a few minutes. Voila. Done and it was fantastic.

My husband is a big fan of liver and onions and very picky about the way it is made. He absolutely loved this recipe and couldn't get enough. The whole family loved it. It was very good and plan to share this recipe with family and friends.

This was the easiest and best recipe. The liver and onions tasted just as good as the best I've had at any restaurant. I've made this with both Vidalia onions and white onions both were good but I do recommend the Vidalia. I also Fried some bacon which is a personal favorite addition of mine with liver and onions.

This was very good. I didn't add as much milk to the liver though because I didn't want to take away too much of the liver flavor. Besides that, I also like my onions extremely caramelized so I left it in the pan while the liver cooked as well. Also added a tad bit of lemon juice and salt&pepper it at the end and it was divine!! Yum yum.

I have been eating and making liver and onions for years and love it just the way I make it in the flour and pepper mix. Never imagined soaking it in milk before. Glad I did! The whole family loved it even more! We didn't think that was possible. My husband insisted I liked, shared, thumbs'd up, or whatever I could do to say thank you! :)

It tastes just like my mom's and I don't believe she soaked hers at all.  I just tasted like liver to me.  The onions were GREAT (but they always are when sauteed), I added curry and used sunflower seeds grinded up as a flour since we're grain-free.  But otherwise it was just like ok and my DH who says he never had it, never wants it again lol.

I used a regular yellow onion, which turned out fine. To saute the onion, I used 2 tablespoons of Earth Balance substitute butter spread, but for the second 2 tablespoons of butter to cook the liver in, I substituted bacon grease. We liked liver already, but now my husband declares that he wants "liver every night!" It was really delicious.

Absolutely Fantastic! Biting through the crispiness of the breaded liver infused with the caramelized onion rings drives my tastebuds wild!!!  Simple and easy to learn! Very delicious! Thumbs up!

I have to eat liver a couple times because my B12 tanked along with my iron and the doctor is trying to raise it with some dietary changes and vitamins. I'm sure the recipe is fine so I gave it a four but I'm sorry. I was reallay hoping this recipe would make it better since i have to eat it but it didn't I made it with more expensive calves liver, rinsed it soaked it in milk a long time and cooked it as directed. I'll make it this way again because I have to eat it and it is a good recipe but there are no miracles when it comes to liver :o(

We used a lot less flour, yellow onions (didn't have vidalias), and added 4 cloves of minced garlic.  It was SO good!

This was the first time I've ever prepared or eaten liver.  It was great when served as soon as it was cooked but as left overs it got a little tough.  Next time I'll try to make only what we're going to eat that night.  Also I think this serves 8 rather than 4.  I might add a few extra onions as well.

i love the soaking in milk idea but there is entirely too much butter involved in this recipe. Otherwise, it was great. Though I think I'll attempt another version next time I make liver just for some variety.

Outstanding, as a "home girl" from Iowa I wasn't too sure if I would like this. My Mom cooks GREAT Liver & Onions but she must be out shopping, so I had to revert to a search on the internet. I think even SHE will love this. I know my husband and sons did!

Delicious!  But if you like gravy with your mashed potatoes take a can of beef broth with two tablespoons of cornstarch and add to pan after cooking onions and liver.  Bring to boil, reduce heat and add liver and onions back to mixture.  For about another 10 minutes or so and voilà gravy for your liver and onions!  Applause!

Soaking in milk very good.  But all liver is best when topped with sauteed onions and mushrooms but when sauteing them add some soy sauce!!!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. Really, really good recipe. I have had some nasty liver before and I was very hesitant to try making it again...I am glad I tried your recipe. That milk thing is amazing! The sweet onions are a great compliment also. Thanks for the post! A+

Liver is never as appealing to the cook as it is to the rest of the family, because who wants to eat the stuff after handling it raw? Yuk! That said, I made this recipe with calf's liver, which I usually prefer, and maybe that was a mistake (though I doubt it), because we all agreed that  the liver had very little flavor and was pretty boring. I'm still seqarching for a recipe for liver that's as good as I've had in some nicer restaurants. They usually have vinegar in the recipe, and taste much more rich and complex than this preparation did.

Also, really caramelize onions, that with a Maui Onion gives great sweetness.  Carl

So delicious! I used to cook liver in vegetable oil, but this tastes better and I will continue to splurge on the butter!
The only things I changed was to soak the liver in buttermilk and to cook the onions until they were caramelized and then add them back to all the liver at the end just to heat through. Caramelizing the onions makes them even sweeter!

I am a HUGE liver lover and this has become my goto recipe for liver and onions. I omit the process of soaking the liver and milk however, because I love the taste of liver and I feel like it takes away from the taste. Glad I used to always go over my grandparents house for liver and onions or order them when I went out to the diner. Now I can make it at home and it's so much cheaper. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I love liver anyway it's cooked, but soaking it in milk is new to me. I only left it for about 20 min and it turned out great. I still knew I was eating liver only it wasn't screaming out at me. Very enjoyable.

I soak my liver in whole milk for at least 24 hours, but try to soak it for 48 hours before cooking. The longer the better to get that taste out. I have converted many people with my liver and onions!

I had such high hopes that this recipe would make me a liver lover. Sadly it did not. I soaked the liver in milk for almost 2 hours and only flipped once in the pan. It smelled and looked delicious! I couldn't wait to sit down and eat but once I dug in  the strong liver taste was still there. However the flour crust was delicious (I added garlic powder in addition to the salt and pepper). I truly believe that if you already like liver than this is a great recipe for you. It's very easy and quick. I wish it had done it for me but unfortunately it just didn't. I wonder if soaking longer would make a difference?

Excellent recipe. Soaking the liver in milk makes ALL the difference. Also, using calves liver, as it is more tender with a gentler flavor.

I followed the recipe as writen and I used calf liver. This was the best lover and onions I've ever had. This turned my husband into a liver eater! I served it over grits.

This was excellent!  My SO loves beef liver and onions, but although I love chicken livers, I've never really been a fan of beef liver.  This recipe totally did away with the bitterness and toughness.  It was so tender and flavorful!  We both enjoyed this very much and will make it again often.  Thanks so much!

Best liver I've ever had. Lol, I really do not like liver, though, and this recipe didn't turn me into a convert, so 4 stars. I will use it when I have request for liver!

I tried this one a few days ago. We had just butchered a whole beef and so had plenty of fresh liver around. I liked this recipe. My wife likes mine better... LOL! Such is life!

I tried it with deer liver and it was good but tough.  I'm afraid there's no getting around that with wild game, calfs liver is probably better.  Base on ease and aste alone, 4 stars.  Thaks!

My wife loves this recipe and asks for it all the time. According to her, it's a great recipe. I, however, still hate liver and will not eat it no matter how it is prepared. But, as long as she likes it, I will cook it for her.

Very good and not too difficult for this inexperienced cook. I added some brown sugar and dry mustard to the flour mixture, soaked in milk for about 2 hours, and cooked to just pink. Think I'll try this again!

I grew up eating liver and onions and I love it.  My husband, however is another story.  He hated it.  Until, I found this recipe.  Now he looks forward to Liver.  He even helps me make it.  This recipe will be in my Recipe box from now on and we fix it about once a month.  We even converted our 12 year old neighbor Sydney into a liver lover and she can't wait for liver night!

Delicious! The was wonderful. The liver was tender and very flavorful. I cooked it exactly as the recipe says and it turned out great. This is such a basic recipe, I honestly thought it would be so-so, I was wrong! I haven't had liver in years, I remember my grandma's tasted just like this. Very, very good, thank you.

Great recipe for those who like liver.  My bf never had liver and he liked the dish too.  I cut down the butter a lot though but it was still nice and fatty.  Definitely something to make once and awhile.    I soaked my liver for two hours.  The liver was not super tender so you might want to soak it longer.  I had to use a knife and fork to eat it, no left-overs!  We decided to bake/broil the second half of the liver and onions to make them crispy and it was really good, better than just cooking them on the stove top.    I still probably won't make this again because cutting liver is very messy work.  Nice recipe and thanks for sharing!

Oh, I don't know how to rate this one.  I would give it a 1 star because I DETEST liver and onions but my husband had been begging me for YEARS to make it.  I finally caved and went to the butcher... he said it was the absolute best liver and onions he has ever had.  Over the last 10 years I have seen him order liver and onions in some pretty fancy restaurants so I guess that deserves a 5 star.... but only for those who like liver!!!

This is a great recipe for liver lovers and non-lovers alike. My husband isn't a big liver fan but he thought this was delicious. I would recommend more butter than is called for in the recipe. I put garlic powder, Lawry's, and pepper in the flour. Also, I deglazed the pan with broth so it had a little sauce to go over rice.

This recipe is great for someone that has a sensitive palate as it really tones down the livers distinctive and bold taste.I prefer the taste of liver too and will skip the soaking in milk.Buttermilk would probably be better for me.

Excellent, simple recipe for great liver and onions. I used beef liver (not calf) and brown sugar instead of white. Turned out great - tender and good texture. Will make again!

Soaking the liver in milk is something I never thought about. I have a technique i use to make my liver tender and it is to prepare your liver for frying but DO NOT preheat your skillet.Put your liver in a cold skillet for 2-4 minutes then turn the stove on and cook as usual.I used both of these techniques together and my liver was soooooo delicious.I soaked my liver about 15 minutes.

my husband loves liver and brought several for our freezer when he picked up our side of beef ( many people don't like it and leave it behind at the farm) horrified at the prospect of both taste and smell , I looked up two recipes on the site and encouraged him to use them while i was out of town. he choose this one and absolutly loved it! my son who was not a liver fan enjoyed it also. They plan to make it again. Perhaps one day when i'm feeling brave i'll try it too!

People who don't like liver will like this recipe.  The milk really does remove the bitter flavor that sometimes come with liver.  My husband loves it.

I followed the recipe and made a few changes, after a friend at work asked me to make it for lunch the following day, because her husband hates the smell of liver. I added green and red bell peppers. It turned out great! Everyone that tried it at work the following day loved it! It's even better the next day... enjoy!

Wow, I am pregnant and really needed to increase my iron.  I have never been able to stomach the thought of liver, BUT this was really good.  My husband said it was the best he ever had.  The key really is a good long soak in milk.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe, my husband loved it!

For the two of us I used  .363 grams of beef liver reducing the other ingredients accordingly.  I fried 2 strips of bacon (crisp)   and then fried the onions.   I love onions and used 1 1/2 onions.  We enjoy our supper.

I've been a vegetarian for 10 years but recently found out people with O+ blood need meat in their diet. So I tried this recipe. Soaking the liver in milk for 2 hours is certainly the key. It was delicious. And a great source of iron, 12 mg, the daily recommended is 8.

At my next family get-together I plan to make two plates of liver, one soaked in milk, one without, and provide them with the taste test. I am sure I will convert them all to liver eaters.

Well done JSHULER43 :-)

Excellent, simple recipe.  Made extra sautéed onions, organic beef liver, three minutes per side at medium heat — tender and slightly pink.  Will make again!

The secret is not soaking in milk....use calf liver coated with flour and sauteed in butter like they do in France.

Soaking in milk was a new idea and I do think it made the liver taste milder, which was great for me. I've always loved liver so I did notice that the distinct bitterness than can come with some liver was absent. The key as stated is to not overcook! Seriously, keep a close eye on it and when you think it can't already be done, it probably is.  Also its important to have your skillet already well heated to get it done quickly and make it tender. I used a suggestions from a review and added garlic salt to the butter when I cooked the onions and it was so good! I also added a sprinkle of extra flour to the pan after removing the liver, added some milk and made the most savory gravy! Sorry I can't offer exact measurements as I'm sort of a experimental cook... splash of milk, flour... hmmm, more milk, dash of salt... gravy! Thanks for the recipe! This will be the standard prep for me from now on.

Growing up, my parents loved liver, but we three kids did not.
My hubby likes liver and I made it a few times, but stopped when 2 YO son spit it out and kept saying Meat, Meat! He did not think it was meat, he was a meat lover.  I have not cooked it since, until today, 45 years later. Hubby had to order it at restaurants if he wanted it. 
This is a great liver recipe and, yes, it made a convert out of me. 
I really enjoyed this recipe and will  make it again. I did soak the liver in milk about two hours. I cooked it 2-3 minutes on each side and I added pepper to the flour dredge, but put the salt on the liver while cooking. I did not measure out the milk but just covered the liver in a shallow pan, and let it sit just over 2 hours in the fridge. At the end,  I added 1 cup of beef broth to the liver while cooking and this made a nice gravy, with the flour on the liver. I did not add more flour. My hubby has to eat gluten free, so I made this using Robin Hood Nutri flour blend, which is gluten free.

Yummy, like he said cook a couple minutes each side if it's thin liver and don't overcook. I have made this recipe several times now and tonight's was the best because I only left on there a couple minutes per side. I believe I overcooked the first couple times. You also don't need 2 cups of flour, I used about a cup, threw the rest away.

This tasted EXACTLY like my grandmother's recipe that I grew up on a kid.  This is my first time ever making liver and onions, and I am extremely excited that it turned out so well.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception that I had halved the recipe for my family, and then accidentally forgot to half the amount of butter for the onions, but the buttery onions were delicious!!!  I soaked the liver in whole milk for a little over an hour, and it had a pleasant, but not overwhelming "livery" taste.  The only other thing that I love putting on my liver is bacon because it gives that extra bit of saltiness, and compliments it so well.  Because it is not a very healthy dish, we don't eat it often, but I love having it for a special treat.

Me and my husband both enjoy liver but we only ate it once a year.  Never really remembering to add it on our shopping list but after trying this recipe liver has because a monthly meal.  Thanks for the recipe!! This is the best liver I ever tasted!  The only thing I changed was I added garlic.

Very good! I'd never tried soaking in milk. I found that it mellows the "liver taste." This is either good or bad, depending on whether you like that flavor in liver. The criticisms are coming out of personal preferences, rather than anything not so good about the recipe. Some don't mind - or even enjoy - that slightly bitter taste, while others DO. The milk definitely helps reduce it.

Flouring the liver is also a matter of preference. I usually prefer not to use flour, because I can keep better tabs on the internal doneness, which IS a vital factor for good liver. It should remain at least a tiny bit of pink, to insure moistness AND to avoid that "granular" quality that liver has when it is too well cooked, and which almost nobody likes. Overcooking is the most important thing to avoid. I'd love to make it crispy outside and slightly pink and moist inside, but it's not truly possible unless the liver is quite thick.

I also brown my onions (LOTS of them) very thoroughly, and always include rashers of crisp bacon. Some garlic in the butter is also nice.

I hated eating liver as a child because of the taste & my parents over cooked.  As an adult, I was able to avoid eating. My husband loves liver, so I decided to try this recipe because of the many good reviews.  I made it last night and found this to be the best liver I've ever eaten.  I will make it again.  I believe the KEY to a tasty meal with liver is soaking it in the milk and not over cooking.  I'm working on convincing my sister she should try; she hated liver more than I did.

My nutritionist told me to eat liver at least once a week so I decided to try this.  I soaked the liver for about 36 hours in milk.  Then I fried the liver in organic butter and coated with arrowroot flour to keep it gluten free.  I was pretty scared to try it but it's quite good.  It reminds me a bit of oysters, like there's something gross and delicious about liver at the same time.  In any case, I will be making a lot more liver recipes, as well as homemade pate in the near future because of the amazing health benefits.  Enjoy!

This recipe was delicious and so were the leftovers! Due to circumstances beyond my control I ended up marinating the liver in milk for approx. 24 hours but it still ended up very good! Everyone who ate it told me to rate it a '5'!

Well, something rare happened to me  about this recipe. I bought just enough liver  for two dinners ( me and my whole family love it! ). The first time I made following the recipe exactly as it said to and it was wonderful! The presentation, the flavor, soooo good!  So, I froze the rest of the meat for another occasion. When I made it, I don't know if it was because the liver was frozen (I followed the recipe's instructions exactly  like the first time) but it was a complete disaster! The liver fell apart and it looked like ground liver; also the flavor was kind of bitter... so I do not know what I did wrong; I throw away the whole thing... but based in my first experience about this recipe IT WAS ABSOLUTLY YUMMY. Thanks for sharing! Monica.

I decided to try soaking my liver in milk before cooking it. I admit, I was a bit skeptical about the whole idea.   After soaking it for an hour I prepared it in my usual way. My husband, who has been eating my liver & onions for 20 years, swore it was the best liver I ever cooked.  No matter how you like to cook your liver, I recommend you try the milk idea at least once.

This is how Grandma made her liver and onions, only she soaked her liver in buttermilk and she added a sliced Granny Smith apple or two. Really depended on what Grandma had on hand. Sometimes, she would fry it in a mixture of bacon grease and butter. So comforting. One of my favorite comfort foods.

Let soak in the milk for about 3 hours, definitely does take the bitter taste out. Make sure you don't overcook, or it will get tough. Very good!

Since my BF is a hunter, I make venison liver and onions fairly often from an old, standard type of recipe.  This time, I bathed the liver in fat-free milk for appx 6 hours.  What a difference!  The texture was consistently wonderful from piece to piece, and the taste was fabulous.  We couldn't stop eating the liver and onions.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I have made this recipe many times and the milk does mellow out the liver flavor. However, not diet conscious, I fry bacon with the onions and cook the liver in the bacon drippings. Gives it a wonderful flavor.

I made this recipe for my husband.  I decided to use this recipe simply because soaking it in milk made sense to keep it moist.  My husband took a bite of it and just RAVED!!  He said it was amazing.  He also said that as many times as he has gotten this in a restaurant it has never been this good!!  THanks so much for sharing this recipe.  Oh and as a side note, this was an extremely easy recipe and I soaked the liver for about 4 hours.

I may have done something wrong. My dad hated it. He likes a strong liver flavor so that might have been the problem. I was ok with it, but I like a strong liver flavor, too. Soaking it in milk really did tone down the liver taste. It was my nephew's first try with liver and he hated it too. Liver isn't everyone's thing. But like I said... I might have done something wrong.

This recipe is almost exactly the way I have always made liver and it converted my husband from someone who tolerated liver to someone who loves it.  The major difference is that instead of soaking my liver in milk, I parboil it for about 30 to 45 seconds.  This breaks up the long protein chains and tenderizes the liver, plus it makes the liver easier to handle (especially for those who are a little squeamish).  I also use seasoned salt in my flour and make a pan gravy with the drippings.  Yumm...

I'd never had liver before now, but because my pregnant body was low on iron we gave it a try.  We liked it!  Very unique taste.  I agree with a previous review- you can't have too many sweet onions with this one.  If I did anything differently I would thaw my liver overnight in the fridge rather than try to defrost in micro.  I think that would hold it together better and not make it as gross to handle raw.

I made a few changes...I used calf liver, seasoned up my flour with some salt, pepper, garlic, cayenne pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning.  I also made brown gravy from pan drippings, brown gravy mix, and beef broth, and let it simmer.  I've never tried liver before, and I thought it was nasty, but my boyfriend, who had requested it...ate it ALL.  Good thing I didn't like it...LOL  A+

I wouldn't call this the absolute best, but it was definitely good. I didn't notice too much of a difference after soaking it in milk, but it didn't hurt by any means. Then again, I like the taste of liver. I also added some fried mushrooms along with the onions that tasted nicely with the meal.

I thought that this was a good dish. This is my husbands favorite meal, and I was excited to see him gobble it up. I am glad to now know that soaking my liver in milk will draw out the bitterness. It made it an ediable dish for me.

I have to give this 5 stars, even though it didn't make my husband and 2 daughters like liver and onions. I loved it, it was the first time I was able to make liver and onions anywhere close to the way my Mother did. I will just have to make sure to make less from now on and only when I'm home alone.

I can't believe we liked it!  Both my husband and I are not liver fans still I like to make it once in a while.  We never enjoy it but we try.  This recipe has completely changed our feelings about liver.  I really belive the trick was to soak it in milk.  My husband actually had a second helping!

Not sure if I really had to soak it in milk or not, as I soaked it for 2 hours and it tasted just like the liver I remember my mom used to make, but she never soaked it.  Anyhow, besides that, it was AWESOME!  I thought I would miss the gravy my mom made with Cream of Mushroom Soup, but I didn't!  The onions were so delicious that that was all it needed.  I made basically half a recipe, with a little less than a pound of liver and a large sweet onion, 2 tablespoons butter, and only used like 25 grams of flour, way less than the 145 grams or so they called for (1 cup for half the recipe).  I will definitely be making this more often.  It is very filling and very satisfying.  I ate three-fourths of it for lunch and will eat the other one-fourth on a tortilla with Laughing Cow on it tomorrow.  Yum!

Amazing recipe. First time making liver so I didn't know how it was suppose to look when it was ready. So I cooked each side for 3 minutes and had perfectly golden browned crust. The longer you soak the liver in milk, the tastier it will be. Enjoy!!!

The best. No changes.  Easy to fallow.  Will be one of my favs due to my new way of eating
Beef liver is the highest for critical nutrition.  Hard to find since the days beef was demonized.  Good ole Walmart came through.

A very forgiving recipe! We only had 1/2  an onion and "just enough" butter for the liver so we used EVOO to saute the onions. Oh, and no flour! Rinsed and soaked the liver per the instructions. Delicious and nutritious, great economy too, 1.5 lbs for less than $3.00. We served it with a green salad and wine! Thanks for posting!

Made it for the first time and it won't be my last.  I've made liver & onions over the years but this recipe won hands down for me.  I took notes from the  video &  It  was definitely the "Best Liver and Onions".  I wouldn't change a thing.  I served it with mashed creamy potatoes and peas.  Yummy!

Everything tasted great.  Easy to make.  I did add some Lawry's Season Salt and Lawry's Garlic salt to the flour.  Once the liver was removed from the skillet;  used some seasoned flour and milk to make gravy.

Using milk-soaked liver and combining it with sautéed Vidalia onions created a great dish. Care not to overcook the ingredients is important.

Delish! I soaked the liver in milk overnight and all day... maybe that’s overkill but it turned out great! I didn’t know that liver would keep cooking after taking it off the heat. I followed reviewer’s recommendations of using the leftover flour to make a gravy. I’m now a fan of liver and definitely will make this recipe again.

I found this to be very bland. See my way...

Before cooking the liver I sauté the onion rings then set them aside. Then fry a few strips of bacon till crispy and set aside.

In the same pan and adding more oil I first add the following spices to the liver before cooking, after soaking in milk, cut into small strips: Garlic & Herb, Steak & Chops, Italian Herbs, black pepper and a little salt. Then sprinkle with flour and cook a few strips at a time in hot oil till done with a delicious crispy crust.  Add back the onions and a little gravy powder and enough water to make a lovely rich gravy when you simmer it all for about 10 minutes. 

Serve over creamy mashed potato with green peas and tomato salad. Wow - my husband can't get enough of this meal! His absolute favourite.

I've always liked liver...grew up on it  (although now I know my Mom overcooked it).   With two exceptions, I made it exactly per the recipe.  I just added Mrs. Dash to the flour/salt/pepper mixture and I soaked it for four hours in the milk; I didn't know about soaking it in milk--truly a wonderful thing to do--it does take the bitterness out of it.  I didn't over cook it and, boy, was it ever tender!  Another keeper!

I make liver like this all the time.  It's a good recipe.  I make it exactly as printed except I discovered that cooking the liver in the bacon grease that's left over from the bacon I cook to use in another dish, is awesome!  Everything Is the same now except for not using butter, but using bacon grease.  Talk about love it!  I know, I know it's not as good for you but I only use as much as necessary to fry the liver in.

Made this recipe exactly as written except I ended up needing more butter. My husband loved it. Will definitely make it again. Note: 2 cups of flour turned out to be much too much. I will use 1 cup next time and have plenty for my 2 pounds of liver.

Great!  I think soaking in milk is a rally great idea.  I added a little Sherry to the pan after everything was put together and needed a little more time to cook through.

We loved it!! I never made Liver and Onions before, since I hated it. Although a couple of years ago I tried my mothers liver and onions again and I liked it. So thought we would give this a try with our grass fed liver from the cow we recently purchased. I did make a couple of changes although I usually will not change anything the first time because I like to get a baseline for the recipe. I made changes this time, I made it like my mom except I added the milk soak. First I cooked bacon, then set aside. Then I cooked the Vidallia onions in the bacon grease, set aside. Then fried liver like the recipe. I served this with baked potatoes (potatoes rubbed with olive oil and baked at 400* on a cookie sheet for 1 hour) and sautéed fresh carrots ( seasoned with olive oil, salt, pepper, cayenne, nutmeg and allspice). We seasoned the baked potatoes with salt, pepper and parsley. Yum, yum. Everything was delish!!!

I have never cooked liver before. I love it when it's prepared correctly, but when it's bad, it's reaaaally bad. I was intimidated, but I followed this recipe exactly and HOLY ! I did it! It was the best liver I've ever eaten! The meat was cooked perfectly. It had a good bite, texture, flavor....I am so incredibly excited. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Decided not to soak the liver in milk and am glad I didn't.  I didn't think my liver had a very strong liver flavor the way it was, but turned out delicious.

I soaked liver in cream because I was out of milk.  The liver was the most tender that I have eaten.  My friend told me it was the best liver he ever had eaten; even better than his Mother's, who is an excellent cook.  First time he has ever said that is 20 years.  Excellent recipe

I loved it! I did not soak it in milk because I do like the liver flavor. I also sautéed a little minced garlic with the onions and some garlic powder in the flour mixture. I also saved the excess blood (gross, I know) and poured it in the pan after the liver was done to make drippings that went into the gravy and onions.  It was awesome!

Good recipe for beginners. Easy and basic approach.Something everyone can add some flair to. On that note, i tried this recipe to a T, and i liked the outcome. I prepared  the onions in butter first, with a pinch of garlic. Not putting too much flour on a plate with flour is important not to get too much on the liver before adding it to the butter or oil in the pan.The only difference in taste, with the milk, it takes away from that livery deepness that liver lovers love. I suggest an evaporated milk or extra extra skim milk. Soak liver to your preference in taste. 4 stars a must!

About once a year my sister and I crave this. Growing up spending the summers on a country farm, you ate the whole cow eventually. As kids we hated it, as adults we love it  and it transports us back to our child hood and special memories. This is so close to how it was prepared for us. Our husbands and children are reluctant, but always end up eating off our plates to have some. Pride is funny that way.

I used plenty of butter with each batch and wish I had used more onions, one onion per whole piece of Calf's Liver (5).  Easy, Quick, & good for you and your soul.

This recipe is easy to follow, and earns the cook lots of compliments. Ok, here's the thing - I seriously dislike liver and onions. and I had never made it before. But it was on the menu at work (I'm a caregiver), and I found this recipe. I loved how the onions came out. The liver? I still don't love it. But judging by all the positive comments I got from the folks who live in that house, this is THE genuine, best ever recipe. One person even told family members who stopped by for a visit that it was really great.

We love liver to start w/ but this was different. I have never battered liver before. It was faster and still came out tender. I soaked the liver for about 20 minutes in milk, next time I won't soak it in milk but just dip prior to flouring since we really enjoy the liver flavor.

Love this recipe! I am reviewing now after making it for the second time. Both times were complete successes. My husband who was terrified of trying liver, came back for second helpings both times. I soak the liver for 2 hours, just to be save. I am curious to see how the leftovers reheat tomorrow.

I refused to eat liver as a child, but I decided to see if my adult tastebuds liked it and they do! One the first try I left the liver in the milk too long so it removed too much of the liver taste, but the second time, I only did 2 hours in the milk bath and the liver was perfect! Added fennel and onions as well. Thank so much! Gotta get the Hubby to Be on board now - and this will definitely do the trick :)

Yeah! Back home cooking as my mother always made. Yes! Soaking liver in milk is an absolute must for a delicious liver dish. (No, that's not an oxymoron.) Try to use calves liver for best results. Sauteed onions a wonderful accompaniment.

Another convert!  I have tried several times over my life to "like" liver.  It was always unsuccessful.  Soaking it in milk really does the trick!  I ate my whole slice and then went back for seconds.  Liver is such a healthy organ; it's the first that the upper level predators go for.  Try this recipe!

We added chopped bacon to the butter and onions to add flavor. YUM!  Also, we use the left overs (make a double batch) for a  spicy liver sandwich spread.  We put the left over liver & onions in a food processor along with some cream cheese and sliced jalapenos (from a jar..add a lot if you like it spicy, the cream cheese mellows it out) and pulsed until the desired spreadable consistency.  Double yum!

I only soaked for less than 1 hour and it tasted great. Easier to buy precut liver as cutting it up when tender makes it less firm while cooking. I kept seeing the reviews on all the husbands that loved it and guess what? Mine did too!

I made this the other night for my 81 yr old grandmother who is on a strict diet. She called me and said "that liver was slamming, it was the best I ever tasted". "Don't forget me when you make more". I think that says it all. I only gave it four stars because I haven't tried my piece yet.

I will definitely make this again. I did make changes, however. I soaked in milk for an hour and a half and it was perfect. 
Changes: did a dredging system of flour, egg wash then more flour and used 50% corn flour 50% regular flour. I also put bacon in my onions, cooked them off first, used that pan to cook the liver, pulled out fried liver and let sit on paper towel to pull off any excess grease, threw onions back in pain for a quick heat and put liver back ontop. Served with mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms. So. Fricken good.

Excellent recipe! The only thing I do different is I cook the onions after the liver so they soak up the flavor of the pan. More people would like liver if they just tried it this way.

I have recently developed MS and organ meat has become a part of my diet by physician recommendation. I was horrified at the thought. Liver was my first thought. After this easy and FANTASTIC recipe, I am now a "tolerate-er" of liver. Highly recommended.

I can't stand liver, but we got a bunch of it for free, so I had to find a way to use it. This is really the best recipe for liver I've ever tried. It removes all the metallic flavor from the liver. I added a little onion and garlic powder to my flour and I also serve it with a onion gravy. Yum

I really really love this recipe! Very easy and simple.  It doesn't cost much to buy at the store or make.  Very delicious and me and my family simply loved it! Definitely will be making it again. The only thing I did different was soak it in Soymilk bc that is what we have next time I will use whole milk just to see if there difference. Great recipe.

Poopsie thanks you for this recipe. We've never truly liked liver (it's a texture thing for us), but we do prepare it here and there as a nice treat for our beloved, elderly pooch. As it was for our dog, I made it without the carmelized onions (fantastic for humans, never good for canines), sauteed a bit of minced garlic with a minimal amount of a butter/olive oil combo and had soaked the liver in milk overnight. Enhanced it with a bit of crumbled, lean turkey bacon for her, as we always keep things lean. After preparing, I just had to try some, and it was quite tasty. I'm not sure we'll ever venture into liver territory, but our furry one LOVED it. She says thank you for posting.   :)

I was forced to eat liver growing up and have never once made it as an adult. However, for some reason (prob low on iron) I found myself craving it and found this recipe. I have never heard of soaking liver in milk, but ok, gave it a shot, and since the only liver I could find in the grocery store was frozen, I actually just soaked it overnight in the milk. Had no idea how it was going to turn out, but it was so good I ended up having seconds, the kids both ate it, and husband even liked it. Guess that milk trick really works!

My husbands favorite meal. Soaking the liver in milk really is the key. It takes the bitterness away but it also tenderizes it. I follow the recipe as printed but after cooking, I make a milk gravy in the browning of the liver/onions in the pan and put the liver/onion back in the gravy and put a top on it and simmer for 15 minutes. It is very tender and the gravy is delicious.

I substituted chicken liver for beef liver, used buttermilk instead of milk, skipped the flour step and added the buttermilk from the soak directly into the pan and added the onions together with the liver. Onions got beautifully caramelized to medium brown and the dish was just amazing. Saving this for next time!

I just made this because I had severe blood loss and I needed iron.  I have never had any liver and onions before so it is likely it's not the recipe, it's just inherently liver and onions, thus the two stars.  I gagged this down and mainly swallowed everything whole.  Liver is SO GOOD FOR you, but I am clearly too wimpy for this.

My boyfriend loves liver and onions, so he asked me to make it for him...I was intimidated to say the least, but this recipe seemed easy to follow, and it turned out wonderfully!  (At least, he really really enjoyed it...I admit I didn't have any.)  Thanks for the non-threatening liver recipe!

Thank you for sharing the recipe. I'm not much of a cook, but am working on it! This recipe is very easy. I would never have thought of soaking in milk.  Absolutely tender enough to cut with a butter knife. I didn't have Vidalas on hand, substituted a yellow onion and a red onion. Nice mild flavor with that mix.

Very good and easy. If you cook calf livers then there isn't that bitterness. But it makes them even more most to use the milk. We will be using this recipe through out the years.

My mother used to make us liver and onion often, and this recipe equals or surpasses hers.  Soaking the liver in milk makes a difference.  I made this with more onions, and fried the onions first to a nice caramelized stage. Tender enough to cut with a fork!

I do not like liver! Or at least that's what I believed until I tried this recipe!  I cooked it for my father, only to find myself rapidly devouring it after an ill fated "taste test".  You've just made this a regular item on the grocery list. Thank you!

I followed it exactly BUT I decreased  the quantity of liver and onion to suit my appetite.  The most important thing is to soak the liver in milk.  One can use a cheaper cut of liver and it will taste like the most expensive calf liver - it also takes any bitter taste out of beef or lamb liver.  I have used that tip for years.

Not big on liver, but soaking it in milk makes the difference.  In addition to the onions I added in some mushroom pieces and a little chicken broth.  It turned out pretty well. I'll eat this more often!

I will try it again, it's maybe the slice of my liver or something, but I think it was a little tasteless, and maybe my fault it was a little too floury tasting. One reviewer called it a good base recipe. I think that's the best description. I'll update next time.

This is the same way, I have been  making liver for the past 30 years, the only difference is, along with the onions, I add 2 or 3 jalapeneos seeded, and cut in half lengthwise , I do not slice them so the onions will not become too spicy, also because I like to fish them out, and give to those guestst, that can really apreciate them, including myself of course.

Pretty darn yummy! I gave this recipe only 4 starts simply because I didn't follow the recipe to a "T". I am currently dieting and cannot have flour or butter, so I followed the recipe omitting the flour and butter aspects. I also took the advice of a fellow reviewer and sauteed garlic with the onions. It is DELICIOUS! I love Liver & Onions and this just re-affirms my love for it! When I am no longer dieting, I shall try it with the flour and butter. I can only imagine what kind of Heaven that will be!

I am so sorry to say i was disappointed. Maybe I did something wrong, but I didn't like liver before and this one did not change my mind. In fact the liver made me feel sick since it's all liverey and such like. The milk did seem to help, but not enough. I'm severly anemic and was hoping for help, but it's going to have to stay iron infusions for me. I hope the recipe works for someone else though!!

I was actually rather surprised when I first ate it. I could barely taste the liver flavor after I soaked it for an hour and a half! Even my mother and sister ate it and were shocked that it turned out decent, and they LOATHE liver. I was just going to give the beef liver I have in my deep freezer to my one uncle who is the liver fan in the family, but I think I'm going to keep it now. Thank you! This is a recipe I'm going to keep using from now one except I'll soak it over night instead to get the rest of the flavor out.

It's a good recipe.  I really like liver and onions, but I haven't found a recipe yet that is much different than any other.  I'm giving this four stars because while its very good, it doesn't seem to be much different than any other recipe I've tried.

I really liked this. It really does mellow out the liver flavor. DH said it didn't have enough liver flavor for him - but it didn't keep him from going back for leftovers the next day - leftovers that I was saving to take to my parents - who I also cook for. Now I need to come up with something else for mom and dad tonight!

I try liver once a year, trying to like it since it's so good for you . . . this recipe moved liver from the status of "unbearable" to "need to try it again."  I soaked the liver for 40 minutes, and a second batch is in the fridge right now, soaking overnight.  I'll try more for lunch tomorrow.  I like a heavier crumb to my coated and fried foods, so I'm going to try some cracker crumbs or a batter for the next batch.  Thanks for the inspiration and the milk technique!

It's been 31 years since I attempted making liver and onions. The first attempt failed so bad that I feared trying it again (so did Hubby!).... I tried this recipe tonight, served him a small piece to start and voila, he asked for seconds. He's very picky and would have easily shoved it away had it not worked. I soaked in milk just for about 15 minutes and that worked fine. I did sprinkle a touch of garlic salt into the onions while they cooked and added some All Season to the flour (in a bag, easier to coat). Thank you so much for this great recipe. I've regained my trust in making liver .... hubby thanks you too.

My husband is a huge liver and onions fan and he gave this a 4.  I used calves liver and soaked it for about 10 hours.  Will be making again but think I will add bacon to the onions and cook the liver in the grease from the bacon.  I didn't try it because of the high calories.  Can liver be more than 700 calories a serving!  WOW.

I used this tonight as the first time I cooked Liver and Onions.  It was awesome.  I didn't have any flour so I rubbed Montreal Steak Seasoning over the liver and also ground sea salt and garlic over it while it cooked.  I added butter as it cooked off.  It still has a bit of the liver aftertaste, but not the texture, it is more like steak now.  
I will definitely make this again.

I haven't made liver in forever so I was surprised to find that my local store only carried it frozen. Defrosted the package in a bowl of water (only took a few minutes) and made the recipe exactly as it called for. It was dee-lish! Tender and moist, and it cooked really fast. I will never make it another way again.

This recipe was very good.  I actually got to soak the liver for a couple of hours before cooking, and it had no bitter taste whatsoever.  This tastes like the liver you'd buy at a cafeteria style sit-down restaurant; it's good.  I probably won't be cooking liver again, without soaking it my milk at least 30 minutes.

OK...i have never had to make liver before but I always had it as a child and I liked it.  I found this recipe so I decided to go for it and introduce my teenagers to liver and onions.  One kid loved it, one kid hated it.  Hubby used to hate liver but said he liked this.  I however did not like it.  Dont get me wrong, the recipe is good but I dont think i will ever make liver again.  I think my tastes have changed over the years.  But thanks for a very easy good recipe.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I have my man eating liver and loving it at 49 years old. I have eaten liver all my life and never have I made such a simple and delicious recipeMy man generally doesn't fuss over a meal, but he raved on this liver. I added a spoonful of sugar to the flour mixture which was delightful. I will never cook liver any other way now. Thank you.

I believe the soaking in milk made for a very creamy textured liver. It still tasted very strongly of liver (to my pregnant palate), but I only soaked for 30 minutes, so that may have been the problem. Otherwise, fantastic flavor.

Great!
I could never bring myself to eat liver before but the lady I get my organic grass fed beef from doesn't either so she told me that I could have it free if I wanted it so I thought I would just give it to my dog. My hubby suddenly claims to like liver so I prepared it for him and tasted a bit. I then had to have an entire slice! 
Now that I have a source for FREE organic GF liver and this recipe I am happy as can be.

My husband is a liver fanatic and I had never had liver before. I'm a novice when it comes to cooking so followed the recipe step by step and he absolutely loved it. I found out that I don't like liver but the onions where soooo delicious! I can't believe how quick and easy this recipe was...and according to my husband, delicious as well!

I'm sorry, this recipe did not turn me into a liver convert.  However, my husband enjoyed it, as he loves liver.  He liked how tender this recipe made the liver, almost like calfs liver.

My husband made this tonight using corn starch instead of flour so it's gluten free. We cooked up 2 whole onions and added portabella mushrooms and bacon strips.  Delicious!

I make it like my mother used to. Coat the liver with seasoned flour. Brown it in vegetable oil, cut onions into rings and put in top of liver. Cover with water and cook until desired done. Thicken the water with cornstarch to make gravy and serve with mashed potatoes.  Now I’m hungry for it!

This recipe is amazing. I follow it to the letter.  My only change is  I use purple onions because my stomach can't handle any other kind. 
Side note: I use cast iron so it gets hotter.  I noticed I use way more butter than called for cooking the liver. Goes great with mashed potatoes and buttered peas and carrots .

This is a good starting point, I harvested a deer on Saturday and prepared 1/2 the liver on Sunday.
I sliced and soaked the liver in whole milk for close to 6 hours because I had the time.
I sliced and separated one Vidalia onion 6 hours ahead of cooking time and refrigerated it covered.
I also sliced 4 rashers of bacon into 1” strips and used less butter to sauté the onions. I added more butter to brown the liver. Me I like it very pink as did my guest..

This was my first time making liver & onions and it was amazing!  I soaked the liver in buttermilk overnight and it made is very tender and took all the metallic taste away and cut down on the smell while cooking!  This is definitely my favorite variation of a delicious dish!

This is one of the more easy liver & onions recipes to make - quick & easy and simple. You can even skip the milk soak and it still turns out great!  I make this recipe at least once per week!!

I love this recipe so much! As a newbie to liver consumption, I found that the recipe allows the neophyte liver consumer to "drown-out" some of the taste of the liver, but not completely. Liver has several nutritional properties (containing Vitamin A, iron, and folic acid to name a few), and this recipe is a great way to prepare liver for those who love the nutritional value but not the taste. The first time I've made it, I used goat milk to soak the liver, but not for more than 10 minutes; the second time, I used just water (since I ran out of milk) and soaked it for even less time. I think the taste difference was marginal, although I slightly preferred the taste and texture a bit more when soaked in milk. In addition, I followed some advice in the reviews and added sour cream and some flour towards the end of the process and it still came out delicious. I usually just eat it as is with a bit of Worcestershire sauce on the side :)

Forgot to get a picture but my husband and father in law raved over this one. I made a cream gravy after cooking the liver and served with a potato / cauliflower mash. I used calf liver and soaked it a whole day then drained and placed each slice in waxed paper layers until cooking. We had to delay cooking this the night we planned and it turned out fine waiting until the next day.

I tried this recipe and was very impressed. Liver and onions is not my favorite but this was pretty good. I was sidetracked so marinated in milk for several hours instead of a couple. I also cooked with a bit of bacon grease in with the butter. All in all, When I have Liver and onions about once a year I'll use this recipe.

First time cooking "Liver & Onions"

Not sure if it was soaking in milk or breading it with flour, but the liver just melted in the mouth. Cooking the onions twice, left them so crunchy as a side. Used Yellow onions and 2% milk and soaked for only 75 minutes before draining from milk. going to love using this as a base for future dishes. Thanks

Great recipe turned out very good. Like the recipe said it is important to soak the liver in milk for an hour or two unless you like that strong livery taste. I made the mistake of only soaking it for 20 minutes and it was pretty strong. I don’t mind it so much though but a lot of people might not like it and I myself prefer a liver with a much more mild taste to it. Still was delicious and next time I will soak it longer like the recipe says.

I never thought, I would eat liver again, since I was young, I found out I'm anemic, so it was suggested, I eat liver to bring my iron up, so out of desperation, I bought some tonight and made it I added garlic and mushroom gravy and rice and I loved it

It was very good.  The best liver and onions I have ever had.  I think the milk really helped by removing the bitterness.

I kind of agree with JUNGMAN that the milk subdues the liver flavor I really like, but for those who don't like offal it is a game changer.
Fed this to folks who would have never eaten it otherwise, and they enjoyed it.
I served with a rich gravy, mashed potatoes and steamed greens.   A Winner!

Liver and onions taste so good with a gravy with your favorite sides mashed potatoes, rice, or grits and veggie. Did not like the milk soaking but I guess it's beef liver , it's expensive than beef but I prefer veal liver because much tender and do not have to cook long. Bacon No! prefer  a little bacon grease with Olive oil when I fry it with the season ed flour

Made it to the recipe. Now I love liver and onions but I could taste a difference and my son who doesn't like liver was impressed. Definitely make again with milk soak longer like an hour or two.

Made it by recipe,was really good. Would of gave it a five but thought it took too much of the liver flavor out. Unless maybe it was just the liver I had.

I've made this multiple times now, and your three essential tips in your description are spot on!!  I'm so happy, as this turns out just like my Oma used to make it!  I got a little adventurous tonight, and I added some panko and crushed pepper flakes to the flour mixture. It made it nice and crunchy with a little kick! This recipe is perfect without any modifications, though. Thanks for keeping it simple!

Hubby has a lab fast for his lab tests tomorrow. So, I get to eat some of my favorite foods. My dad made thee best liver and onions ever! I don't get to cook/eat that often. This comes close! I did make it once before. I don't think that I soaked it long enough, I soaked it for an hour last time, but it turned out just okay. This time I soaked it in milk in a 1 quart freezer bag overnight. That's the only change I made. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I felt compelled to because it is THAT good :]
PS
If your dog(s) loves liver, don't give them the pieces that were cooked with onions. Onions (or garlic or other same family vegetables) can poison dogs with Allium - which is actually an antibiotic. My dogs are 11.5lbs and 4.5lbs each. They are too small to risk a little taste.

It was very good. Put some garlic powder in the flour but didn't really taste it. Might put more in next time. Made a bit of gravy but added a little bouillon to it for flavor as it was pretty bland to start with. I haven't cooked liver for years. Hubby was pleasantly surprised.

I was skeptical when I read this recipe.  Well, no longer.  I soaked the liver for 4 hours in milk and then just followed the directions.  This is - by far - the best liver and onions that I have ever eaten.  I used to eat liver 3 to 4 times a year.  I can see this being a monthly meal.  Absolutely, fantastic recipe!!!

I will make it again and again.  I added just a bit of ground red peppers, salt, & black pepper to flour mix.  My calf liver was a 1 pound pack.  I used 1 and 1/4 cup of flour.  It was still too much and used I and 1/2 sweet onion.  

It was the perfect blend of flavors.  Little taste of liver, salt, pepper, and sweet.  Fork tender.

Loved this.  Especially the crispy bits left over in the pan from the flour.  I made it as written with the exception of I used peanut oil instead of butter.  2 cups of flour was too much. I seasoned the flour with garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. I soaked the liver in milk in the refrigerator for about a half an hour. In my opinion none of the liver flavor was lost so I would soak it longer if you want it to be less strong. I liked it as is.

Very good recipe.  Liver was tender when cooked for just a few minutes per side.  Next time I will soak the liver in milk longer to try to further cut down on the "liver flavor." We had a fairly young cow but not a calf.

I make my liver and onions similar. I use bacon fat instead of butter. I have never soaked it. I will give it a try. I gave 5 stars because it sounds very promising.

Great simple recipe.  I added mushrooms and a little garlic to the saute onions.  I did not have any flour but the liver tasted very good.  I love the simple and short list of ingredients.

Great recipe. Instead of salt I seasoned the flour and liver with a little Cajun seasoning.  I also made gravy and added the onions, mushrooms and liver. Delicious!

The Liver & Onions were perfect, the author is correct, soaking the liver in MILK is the key here.  Except, I added 8 slices of bacon and crumbled that in the pan when it was all finished up. Without bacon, there is NO Liver & Onions in my recipe book.

This was my first time with liver (I've always been icked out by the thought of it). But the hubs was diagnosed anemic so I'm trying to get iron into his diet. I followed the recipe and only added a pinch of diced garlic. I was amazing!! This will definitely go into my regular rotation.

Never thought the milk and flour would make a difference but this was superb and simple. Milk soak needs to last no more than 30 minutes. Superb with mashed spuds and peas or carrots.

Followed the recipe exactly. The liver came out tender and the onions were perfectly carmelized. Unfortunately I have to come to terms with the fact that I don't like the taste of liver.

Culinary nastiness! Soaking the liver in milk for at least two hours absolutely did not improve the flavor of the dish whatsoever. We even tried dipping the liver in various sauces: barbecue, ranch, A-1, ketchup...

Excellent, fast, and easy!! I soaked liver in milk for about 30 minutes - perfection and added some cooked bacon and gravy - this will be a staple in my house.

I had the liver and onions for breakfast with eggs and a tortilla.  It was really great.  I used half and half because thats what I had.  I also added garlic to my onions.  Very nutritional, delicious and cheap meal with nothing wasted.  Great

This recipe is guaranteed to turn any liver hating diner to a lover. I couldn't believe my son had seconds. Back from where I came from we always soak or cook liver with vinegar to remove the heavy liver taste. A friend did mention about soaking it in milk instead. Craving for liver steak, I stumbled upon this recipe. Vidalia onions are delicious but you can easily substitute any onion as long as you carmelize them. This is great budget friendly meal!

As the name says, this really is the best. I've always been a fan of liver but this was extra special good. My market had it frozen so I just put the liver and milk in a ziplock and left it to thaw and marinate overnight in the fridge. Quick, easy, tasty. Next time will make some gravy to serve over boiled potatoes which I prefer over mashed.

Love it! I don't usually like liver but this one made the beef flavor come out. I did a couple of changes. 1st... I used Panko bread crumbs then afterwards lightly dusted with flour. Shaking off the excess.  2nd... I used Soul Food seasoning instead of spices listed. I also served a gravy on the side.

The recipe was good, I soaked the liver in milk overnight but I am just not a liver person. Occasionally I would catch a bit of the liver taste and it makes me gag.

I love liver and onions!  I'm just not sure I love this recipe. This is the first time I've ever used butter, preferring instead bacon grease.  I only soaked the liver in milk for one hour.  The liver tastes nothing like liver.  Gone is the irony taste of liver that I so enjoy.  I am curious as to how a brief soak in buttermilk would .  But for now, I just can't decide..........  For me, it's just not liver and inions.

Soaking the liver in milk is absolutely the way to go.  I love liver anyway but I could definitely tell the difference.  I also cook my liver medium to medium-rare which keeps it tender.  Loved this recipe!

This was a great variation from my normal. Never tried soaking in milk beforedid only soaked it long enough to cook the onions, so I was able to keep the taste the same and I don't usually use flour, I had wheat flour. I added the onions and gravy and it was delicious with rice and broccoli. I think the milk helps keep it tender which I don't have a problem with but I did notice it was more tender than usual. Family loved it.

My husband just loves this recipe and requests I cook it often.  The rest of my family, however, cannot stomach liver and this recipe still tastes like liver no matter what other reviewers state.  Liver lovers will love it.  If you don't like liver, this won't convert you.

I love liver and I always make it for myself when I get a chance (no one else in my family eats it.) This recipe is perfect. I'll never make it my old way again (no flour and oil instead of butter.) The butter added flavor and added to the creaminess of the liver, and the flour added crispiness to the liver and substance to the sauce.

I didn't find anything special about this recipe. I did think the milk gave it a slightly different flavor but not by much. I'll stick to my regular method though. I like the flavor of liver just fine.

I can't remember the last time diner cost $1.00!  This recipe is great.  I absolutely love liver.  I marinated it in milk all day long.  I made this last night because my boyfriend was working and he hates liver.  The milk definitely mellowed the taste, but I still think it totally tastes like liver, and liver haters wouldn't like it at all.  More for me!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first try at rLiver and Onions, my husband and bother-in-law loved it!  I'm still not a fan, but if you like liver-n-oinos this is it!  It's a lot of food though, maybe half the recipe to feed 4.
