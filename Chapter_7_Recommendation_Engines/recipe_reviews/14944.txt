Ok, I gave this 5 stars, but...

I took recipe a step further.  I added 8oz of cream cheese and 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese.  Then I baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes.  I served this at a party and everyone just stood around the dip devouring the dip with Fritos!  Not one little speck was left - I thought they were going to lick the bowl!

Very good.  And no need to deal with all that frying.  Just line a cookie sheet with foil and bake your bacon in the oven.  375 degrees for about 20 min.  No mess or oil splatters to clean up.  I did add a couple shakes of dry ranch mix and green onions. I've also used chopped chives instead of green onions - which I prefer.  Let it sit overnight and added the chopped tomatoes before serving.  I used 2 roma tomatoes with the seeds removed first.  This will solve your problem of a runny dip.  Great with plain ruffles. Optional add ons: add a few dashes of cayenne, fresh chopped dill, a few dashes of liquid smoke, 1/2 package of softened cream cheese, garnish with chopped bacon on top, chopped chives, dashes of paprika, caramelized onions, diced pimentos (from the jar).  Try these, they enhance the dip very well.

This dip vanished (quickly) as my guests said, "this tastes JUST like a BLT!" I'll make it again, as it's incredibly easy and tasty. One suggestion to keep the dip creamy and not runny: dice your tomatoes first, and store them in the fridge on paper towels to soak up the juices. I stored the tomatoes overnight, then mixed in the tomatoes *just* before I served it. For a beautiful presentation, I served it in a "bowl" made of large iceberg lettuce leaves, and tossed about a 1/4 cup of diced tomatoes on top of the dip for color.

This is the most popular recipe at my White Trash get-togethers. What I do different is add in a package of shredded lettuce, do half a cup of sour cream and a half cup of mayo, add in an extra tomato, and throw in a bit of pepper and a couple shakes of Tabasco. Best off doubling it, it'll disappear fast.
I serve it with Wheat Thins and tortilla chips.

This never fails to disappear and I always send home the recipe with at least one person!

Just made this for a party tomorrow. I wasn't sure I'd like it but it's really good.  I doubled (somewhat) the recipe. I used 2 cups sour cream, 1 cup mayo, 2+lbs real bacon pieces (hormel) and dashed in a good amount of garlic pepper.  I tested it with plain & roasted garlic pita chips since that's what I plan to take along to go with it and all I can say is YUM, and I haven't even added the tomatoes yet. Hope it's a hit tomorrow. I'll update once I know :D

Updated: This was the one recipe that had requests from at least 7 people at the party.  I gave it to one person and saw them making copies on the scanner and handing them out to lots of people so I don't know how many actually took it home :D  Everyone kept asking "who made the great dip with the tomatoes & bacon in it?" I doubled the recipe and not a bite was left.  I actually saw one lady scraping the dish with a pita chip!

Just wanted to add one tip: When I use real bacon pieces I put them in a dish and microwave them a few seconds to warm them just slightly. It helps bring out the bacon flavor like you would get with fresh cooked bacon. It's almost as good this way and much less messy!

I doubled the recipe and I added a 6oz can of tomato paste instead of the tomato since ripe tasty tomatoes are a thing of the past, and used a drained can of diced tomatoes and it was PERFECT.  I have made this in the past exactly to the recipe specs and the tomato flavor wasn't there, but is there when you use tomato paste to kick it up a couple of notches!

My husband took this to work for his staff and it was one of those "either you like it or you don't" things. Very nice with the addition of chopped, fresh chives or green onions.

My family loves this dip!  I first made it for a party this summer and now everyone requests the recipe and asks me to bring it to potlucks. I use Hawaiian bread and scoop out the inside of the bread, then break that into serving size.  I place the bread bowl in the middle of a round platter and then put the small pieces around the outside edge.  Place the dip inside the bread and top with more tomatoes and some lettuce.  It's easy and it looks and tastes great!

GREAT Recipe!  Made night before for our annual Super Bowl party...took several previous reviewer tips and used well-drained petite diced canned tomatoes; used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup Miracle Whip.   Added just a couple Tablespoons of minced green onion.  Served with Ruffled chips.  It was a big hit and devoured.  15-y-o Son said fill a pita or tortilla shell and spread with lettuce for an instant trip to summer.  Can't wait to fill a bread bowl with it and serve bread pieces on the side.   Lots of versitility.  Thanks for this one.

I made this for a school function.  I teach 3rd grade.  Everyone LOVED it!  Wanted the recipe!  I used 1 can of Hunts petite diced tomatoes (drained very well) because fresh tomatoes are not in season.  Yum!  Oh - use real bacon - not the already cooked stuff.  That makes all the difference!  Thanks for a great recipe!

REVISED VERSION WAS DEVOURED!! I agree with many reviewers that this original dip recipe has WAY too much mayo. The 2nd time around, I used 1 cup each of mayo, sour cream and cream cheese. Added 1/2 packet of ranch dressing mix, 1 clove of fresh minced garlic and blended well. Chopped fresh cherry tomatoes (about 20) and blended into the dip 3/4 of the bacon and tomatoes, leaving the remaining of both to sprinkle on top of the dip. THIS VERSION WAS DEVOURED though the original was barely touched.

I could hardly stop eating this dip.  I brought it to a football party and used Ritz Air Crisps as suggested by another reviewer.  Very tasty.  I sprinkled the top with a few chopped tomatoes to add some more color.  My fiance didn't like it though.  He couldn't give a specific reason.  I'm not sure if anyone else liked it as nothing was said.  Despite that, I'll still make this again.

I made this yesterday and it was a crowd pleaser.  However, why don't more BLT dip recipes have the "L"?  I know lettuce gets soggy, but i chopped a cup of iceberg and sprinkled it on top of the dip right before serving - it was eaten too quickly to allow it to get soggy!  And also, I added the tomatoes along with the bacon (rather than waiting to add right before serving) and it didn't cause any problems - only allowed the flavors to meld together even better.  All in all, great recipe!

This dip is absolutely great! I'd give it 10 stars. Everyone loves it and my fiance could eat this as a meal.  I double the recipe and it's still gone in less than an hour!  I also use this as a burger topper because it has the bacon and tomato.

Fantastic! I cooked the bacon (must use real bacon) on my George Foreman grill, and it was so much easier than using a skillet. After the bacon was cooked crisp I chopped it up in the food processor. Mixed it in with the mayo and sourcream. I added a few sprinkles of black pepper and chopped up 2 green onions and added those. I let this sit overnight in the fridge. 8 hours is a perfect time for the flavors to "marry". I chopped the tomatoe into wedges and then scraped out all the wet seedy stuff and just chopped up the remaining tomato and blotted it on a paper towel and then added it before serving. It was perfection. We served it with the Ritz Sticks and it went SO fast. Wish I could give this 6 stars!

Great recipe.  Serve in the middle of a shredded lettuce ring with bagel chips.  Your guests can scoop up a little bit of lettuce with the dip.

Just gettin around to rating this although I tried it out last summer, and 3 times since.  I used canned Hormel reduced sodium real bacon bits, roma tomatos, not peeled, and they are easier to seed and dice.  It always goes fast.
2008 Update: I have since started adding grated cheddar cheese too!

Made this dip without the tomato but added some chopped green onion and just stuffed it in some hollowed out cherry tomatos.  Looked and tasted great. Nice appetizer.

I've made this dip, as written, many times and always recieve raves about it.
The last time I made it I followed another reviewers suggestion, and added 8 oz. cream cheese, 2 cups of cheddar, some green onions, and baked it at 350 for 20 minutes.  Served with corn chip scoops, people go crazy over it!! Excellent! Thank you.

This was an ENORMOUS hit at my party last night--everyone just raved and raved about it and they all wanted the recipe.  It really did taste just like a BLT!  I made real bacon and let it meld in the fridge with the mayo/sour cream for a couple hours, then added in the tomato (which I did drain on paper towels as per others suggestions) and served.  Since one of my biggest questions was what to serve it with, I will share that I served it in a toasted bread bowl, but thought it was more amazing with celery and cauliflower and fritos scoops, so I would skip the bread next time.  Great recipe!!!

I agree with other reviewers that real bacon is a must--I used slab bacon from my local wholesale store.  Also, to cut down on the "burnt bacon" taste that some complained about, I cut the bacon into pieces and then microwaved it in a micro-safe bowl (I even saved the drippings for other recipes).  To get the fresh tomato taste, I used grape tomatoes (which are pretty sweet, no matter the season) and quartered them while the bacon was cooking.  I put them into a colandar, salted them, and let the juices run out.  I served in a bowl surrounded by toast points so the bread wouldn't get soggy.  I got rave reviews.

This recipe was ok....very easy to make....but way too much bacon. I think I will try it again with 1/2 lb. bacon and maybe some chopped green onion for a little zing.

This is such a winner, I have to make 4x the recipe!  I took it to a dance last year, and this year everybody insisted I bring it again.  I added chopped lettuce for bulk and also to bring it closer to the true taste of a BLT.  Excellent party pleaser!

This dip was the hit of my party last night. It has always been a hit whenever I have made it. I even had a couple of guys asking for this recipe! I usually line the bowl with a pretty green lettuce leaf and pour the dip over it. It's pretty and delicious!

this was just an awesome dip!!!!  it was even better when it set overnight.  the salt really comes out from the bacon.  i also cut up the bacon before i cooked it because i wanted it to cook evenly,  that helps alot.  take about 5 pieces together and cut all at once.  thank you for the recipe,  will make it again.  i used cheese ritz crackers

I've been making this dip for seven years now, and people really like it. I prefer to use miracle whip in general, so I rarely buy mayo, but it is worth it for this. You can use miracle whip or light mayo if you have it, people will still love it.

Very tasty dip!  I did find it to be a little too mayo-ish for a dip, so I used two parts sour cream to one part mayo...makes it a bit thicker (although the half mayo/half sour cream the recipe calls for does make an awesome sandwich spread).  A tip for tomatoes that worked well for me -- use the little Roma tomatoes (two of them).  Just slice in half, scoop the seeds out with a spoon, blot them dry and dice.  They don't have as much juice as regular tomatoes, so they won't make your dip runny.  I was lazy and used the Hormel real bacon pieces pouch...worked perfectly.  As others suggested, I also chopped the tops of a few green onions and added to the dip.  It definitely will have a stronger flavor the longer it sits, so make it at least several hours ahead, preferably overnight.  Thanks for the yummy recipe! :)

Absolutely delicious. This dip was gone within minutes and they wanted more!! I wouldn't change a thing, the dip was fabulous!!
A few tips, I did blot the tomatoes on a paper towel to get the water out and chopped the bacon into tiny pieces in my food processer. It really was great dip if you take care in preparing it properly. I let it refrigerate for 2 hours and the flavors blended well.

Tremendous hit with my family, and incredibly addictive. Thanks for the suggestion to add green onions - makes it tough walk away from the table.

Oh boy....this was so delicious.  While I never usually use full fat mayo or sour cream, I did use both full fat versions when I made this for our trip to Ravinia last night.  I also used a lower sodium Oscar Mayer because that's what I had in the house.  I finely diced the tomato after removing the seeds and let them drain in a paper towel. I added this when I added the bacon and the dip did get a bit thinner but was perfect for the wheat thins.  Also had some chopped romaine that we put on each cracker-full!  Really made it taste like mini BLTs!!  I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great dip! I use a can of Rotel instead of the tomato. It gives it a little zest! It's great served with bagel chips, toasted breads or any flavor crackers. Everyone always loves this dip!

I love this recipe.Everyone who tries it loves it and wants the recipe.I hate to give it to them because it is so easy. It is very good as is but I have started adding green onions to the top. It adds color and I love green onions. Thank you very much for this recipe. We will be enjoying this for years to come I am sure.

As many other reviewers have said this dip is great.  I would just like to say that I only used three quarters of a pound of very good slab bacon. Also I used only three quarters of a cup of mayo to one and a quarter cups of sour cream.
I also used petite diced tomatoes {very well drained} and a bit of onion and garlic powder as well as a small amount of black pepper.  My intention was to put it into a bread bowl, but as I was cutting the bread everyone starting spreading the dip onto the pieces of bread that were already cut so the dip didn't make it into the bread bowl.  This is a great recipe and I will serve it again soon!

Please do not cook a pound of bacon..you buy a large jar of 'real bacon' pieces and it is excellent! and I've read some modifications..do NOT add cheese to this recipe..doesn't need it..period. This is a good recipe EXCEPT you cannot use ONE tomatoe for a pound of bacon..I used 3 tomatoes..one does not even cut it.

Good, but can be made great with more bacon & less sour cream. Maybe add a little non-fat cream cheese to thicken it, while not adding more fat to an already VERY fat-laden dip. Do NOT add salt, as the bacon already makes this rather salty. The lettuce is a must, for the color, the taste, the nutrition, & the "L" in BLT! ( I much preferred the "BLT II Dip" on this recipe site. ~ Sorry Kathy!)

I made this for a New Years Eve party and let me tell you YUM! It is the most simple recipe (which who doesn't love an easy recipe) and it was so great. I can't believe I haven't heard of this before. I had to give the recipe out, and was a little hesitant because I didnt want to give it up.  Anyway I am done raving - I did add some garlic powder to this because my DH doesnt do onions, and I added a little more sour cream. I can't wait to take this to my next party!

So easy and so good! I did what another reviewer recommended which was cutting up the tomatoes and putting them in the fridge wrapped in paper towels. It really helped with getting the liquid out. If you put the bacon in a COLD oven (not preheated), the bacon wont splatter. I cook it at 350 degrees for 30-45min.

This was amazing. I used the combination of all the most helpful reviews which equated to- a can of diced tomatoes drained with paper towels for a few hours. For the main mixture,  which I let sit in the fridge for five hours, i added green onions, about 4oz of cream cheese and little less mayo and little more sour cream than the recipe called for. I added some shredded cheddar cheese and used almost two jars of pre cooked Hormel bacon and recooked in microwave for 3 minutes. Served with Fritios and It was a huge hit!!!!

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but I made this dip for a party and had almost all of it left over.  It was way to mayo for me and I was so disappointed because all of the other recipes I've tried with so many stars have been hits.

My sister has made this dip for years. It is excellent and so easy to make!  I always use reduced fat mayo and/or reduced fat sour cream. I also add A LOT more tomato and have shredded lettuce with it. I serve it with toast triangles, wheat thin chips, melba toast, and for the carb conscious-sometimes I just use leaves of lettuce.

Love it! If I need to make the whole thing ahead of time, or want it to last more than a couple of days, I leave out the tomatoes. Its still good!  The tomoatoes will make it runny if you leave it in the refrig for very long. I use fat free sour cream and light mayo and really can't tell the difference. Combine that with low fat chips/crackers and you have a pretty healthy snack.

This reciepe was given to me by my neighbor said I had to try it because it tasted just like a blt.  It was excellent! I serve it in a bread bowl w/ a selection of pumpernickle, rye and sourdough breads. I like it just the way it is but I would probably like it as others have suggested w/ scallions or dry ranch mix. It definately needs to sit for an hour or overnight is better. This is a must try if you like blt's.

When I made this, I used a 6oz can of tomato paste instead of the chopped tomato.  It gave it a richer tomato flavor and kept it from being runny.
I used pork rinds to dip it up and it was really good!!

This was HORRIBLE.  I made it for a fourth of July event and was embarrassed! I mean NO ONE ate it...not even my husband.  I eventually took it off the table and threw it away.  It doesn't even deserve ONE STAR!  Don't make it!

This went over really well at a family gathering - I had thinly sliced some romaine lettuce around the edge of the serving bowl for presentation, and everybody mixed it in and declared it perfect!  (I guess you can't have BLT without the L!)

This is a fabulous dip that is always loved and requested.  After reading many of the reviews I have modified my recipe to include several of the suggestions.  

I used thick-cut peppered bacon that I baked on a foil lined baking sheet. (I used John Morrell brand.) I baked it at 400 degrees until crisp, about 20-25 minutes.  Then I drained the bacon on paper towels and chopped it finely in a food processor.  I also used the white parts only of a bunch of green onions.  Chop these in the food processor as well.  I lined the serving bowl with an iceberg lettuce leaf and garnished with some chopped tomatoes.  Because I used roma tomatoes instead of a large tomato I used a cup of chopped tomatoes.  I took out the seeds before chopping.  I served them with Club Cracker Sticks because my store was out of the Ritz Stix that others had suggested.  They worked great.

My family always needs to double this recipe.  It's simple and tasty.  We don't feel like we need to add anything to it, and love it best with Ritz Sticks.  Thx for the recipe!!

I have to admit that I was somewhat skeptical that this really would taste just like a BLT, but with all of the reviews, I decided that I had to give it a try!  When I FIRST tasted it after making, I thought that it tasted nothing like a BLT and instead like store bought Bacon Dip; BUT, after about 8 hrs., WOW! - just like a BLT!  And as most reviewers say, people do rave over it & want the recipe!  Will definitely be making this again!  Thanks to Kathy Walstrom!

A very good dip, Kathy. We love green onions, I usually add them to all savory recipes I make. This was no exception. Real bacon is a necessity. I used Roma tomatoes and the flavor was wonderful.
Everyone at my party enjoyed this on bagel crisps.

MMM.  I'm not sure if anyone out there is familiar with a company called Tastefully Simple (it's basically taste testing parties & they sell spices, soups etc.) well they sell a spice mix called Bacon Bacon (it's bacon bits & dried onions).  I made this dip with an 1/8 cup of that & a 2.8 oz package of Oscar Mayer "real bacon recipe pieces" wow, everybody loved it!  I like the addition of the tomatoes.  I served it with roasted garlic triscuits....yummmmy.  Thanks Kathy!  Happy New Year!!

I tried this recently to take to a caroling party.  I thought it was good, but nothing spectacular.  However, everyone else at the party couldn't get enough of it (especially the men), so I am making it again for our New Year's Day Party.  Very easy.

Wow! What an amazing recipe. I was a little skeptical that it would taste like an actual blt. I was blown away. I took it to a potluck at work and it was by far and away the hit of the day. I doubled the recipe and used low fat mayo and sour cream and it was awesome. Had to make copies of the recipe for every woman I worked with. A definite keeper!

This BLT Dip is DELICIOUS!! I brought it to a family gathering and it was devoured by everyone, MAN, Woman or child. I put the dip in BOULE BREAD and everyone just dipped the pieces of bread into the BOULE bread bowl. It was great because then I didn't need to worry about leaving a bowl behind!

This recipe was a huge hit in my home!! Even my very picky husband loved it!! Instead of cooking bacon...I used real bacon bits (the kind you use on salads). I'm lazy so this made this recipe even easier!! Now I am going to test it out at a party!!

I have made this several times, and I broke the cardinal rule and changed the recipe over time. The trick to this is to use really crisp bacon, and crumble very finely. I use the precooked bacon and almost overcook. I use a garlic Mayo (2 tsp roasted minced garlic and then stir into the Mayo). I also add shredded cheddar cheese, approx 1/2 cup, 1 tsp of coarse ground black pepper, and 1/2 to 1 cup of shredded lettuce. Based on prior reviews, I double the tomato, drain and squeeze the tomato and add it 4-6 hours in advance. I add the shredded lettuce last. This dip is incredible!

I make this fairly often since it is so easy. I use the pre-cooked bacon and crisp it up in the microwave. I really don't think this tastes like a BLT, but still love the stuff. First time I served this, my friend thought it was lobster dip - I think because it's sort of pinkish and the bacon does get soggy as it sits in the dip. Draining the tomatoes we'll is a must. I serve this with wheat thins and everyone loves it. Even better the next day. One of my go-to recipes.

Amazing Dip..  by using non-dairy sour cream, I was able to make this for my Lactose Intolerant friends..  I added chopped scallions, salt and pepper and substituted well drained roi-tel for the tomato to add a little spice...then just before serving folded in the crisp bacon pieces   ..  As I mentioned earlier...  Amazing Dip!

I made this dip for a football party and it was such a hit I was asked to make it for the next one.  I gave it four instead of five stars because I did change it up a bit.  I used one package of lowfat cream cheese, 1/2 cup lowfat mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also added a little all season salt and onion powder for flavor.  Will definitely make it again!

My family loves this!  I have been making it for 16 years and it is still always asked for at every get together!  If pressed for time i have used Oscar Meyer bacon pieces and a can of diced tomatoes (about 1/2 the can and be sure to drain it!) and it still works well and nobody could tell the difference!  I always dip with wavy potato chips - the salty of the chips compliments the dip well.

This dip is just so dang good. It is always a hit at parties. Sometimes we like to sprinkle some shredded lettuce on top to give the real BLT experience but it is definitely not necessary. Also, I think this dip is best with corn chips (like Frito's scoops!!)

I made this dip for a Super Bowl party last night and it was a BIG hit! Everyone complimented it. I made a few changes, however. I added about 1/2 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese, a couple  shakes of garlic salt, and a little bit of pepper. I also cooked my bacon in the microwave. The only suggestions I can make are to double this recipe! We had about 10 people at the party and it was gone fast; next time I will make much more. I hollowed out a Hawaiian bread bowl and put the dip inside of it and garnished it with some chives. Once the chunks from the hollowed out Hawaiian bread were gone I put out Ritz crackers. AWESOME recipe and super easy!

This is a wonderful summer dip.  It is always requested by friends when we have summer pot lucks.  Easy to make ahead of time and then just add tomatoes before serving.  Sometimes, I use "jarred" real bacon which I heat in the microwave to help bring out the crisp bacon flavor.  Or turkey bacon works great too.  It is perfect with nutty wheat thins.  I also sneak in low fat mayo and sour cream.  Even my pals who say they can tell when things are l.f. can't tell with this recipe.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a family favorite.  Add a dash of salt and pepper. Letting it sit overnight in the refrigerator thickens the mayo/sour cream mixture and lets the flavors meld.  Absolutely fantastic!

Awesome recipe! I made this for an election night party and it was a HUGE hit! I took others suggestions and used 1/2c each of hellman's lite mayo and miracle whip lite, 1c lite sour cream, 1/2pkt of Hidden Valley ranch dressing powder, diced 3 roma tomatoes and baked 3/4lb of bacon @ 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Added the bacon and let the mixture sit in the fridge.  Just before serving I added the tomatoes.  I wanted to lick the bowl clean when everyone left.  Again, AWESOME!!!

Here's the secret.  Cut rounds of bread (you can get 4 from each slice of a standard loaf).  Mix the mayo, sourcream, bacon, pepper together and spread on the bread.  Top that with a halved cherry or grape tomato - skin side down. That keeps it from getting soggy and makes a great appetizer presentation!  Mini BLTs are always a hit!

This did not go over at all.  Almost all of it was left and people that did try it said it had no flavor.  I had high hopes but won't make again.

Excellent!  I baked thick bacon in the oven.  I also used lowfat mayo and lowfat sour cream.  I added 1/4 cup minced red onion.  I serve it in a bread bowl with fresh veggies and bread cubes.  YUMMY!!!

WOW! Very easy and tasty... I added a bit of finely chopped red onion, chives and shredded cheese (Mexican blend) and some shredded lettuce to give that BLT taste I like. To make sure the flavors had a chance to mix well I made this the night before the Super Bowl with everything minus the tomatoes & lettuce, those I added the morning of. I served in a bread bowl and left the pieces of bread out for my guest to use, it was a SUPER HIT.... Thanks for sharing...

Yummm!  This is our family's new favorite party dip.  It does taste just like a BLT sandwich and it's SO darn easy to make!  I'm not one to take too many shortcuts because I think it compromises the end result, so I fried real bacon for this recipe.  I mixed the sour cream, mayo and bacon together the night prior to the party.  I would imagine this helps the bacon flavor develop.  Then just an hour or so before the party, I stirred in the chopped tomatoes.  I spread the dip in a fairly shallow dish and topped it with shredded lettuce just prior to serving.  Afterall, a real BLT isn't a BLT without lettuce!  The dip held up well and looked appetizing (unlike some dips) throughout the party -- or at least while it lasted!  I received many requests for this recipe.  In my book, that makes this recipe a definite keeper!

It was good as is but was too salty and needed something extra.   I made it again with low solium bacon, added some chopped lettuce before serving. then served with toasted bread squares.   This goes really fast!  thank you!!

I personally didn't really care for this.  And I took it to a party and about 2 people really loved it, about 5 liked it and about 8 had a bite and didn't eat anymore.  So, I'd say that overall, it wasn't a hit.  I served it in a bread bowl with bread, Ritz stix and Wheat thins for dipping.  The bread was definitely the favorite, then the Wheat thins.

I love this dip!  I first made it about 7 years ago and it was as an appetizer for our customers at a restaurant.  Everyone loved it, it has been made several times since, and it is so quick.  I reserve some bacon to sprinkle on top, and also a few tomatoes...  Just looks better than mixing everything in.

I'm almost getting sick of making this, it's requested for every party.  Try using one of the fancy mayos that are available.  I've used the sun dried tomato one and it is great.

Great Recipe!!!Simple and a Classic!!!!Hate to say that I still needed to kick it up a bit, but thats just me.-After cooking bacon while its still hot and wet with juices sprinkled it with fresh crack peppercorns- bacon fat makes crack pepper taste awesome -which goes great in this dip.Also added some liquid smoke to it-not much- just enough to help out the smokey flavor in the bacon. I server it with ritz crackers. And again Great recipe!!! Thanks

I've seen this recipe show up dozens of times throughout the past few months but I was skeptical b/c of the few ingrediants....I thought "how could this be good?" Shame on me!! I made this for a family/friend get-together tonight and my family loved it.  My MOM said "is this this dip you were talking about? It's sooo good!" (I had mentioned it to her previously). I used real bacon, added some minced green onions, used half mayo/half miracle whip and used about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  Okay, it may no longer be a "blt" but it was very good. Also, soooo easy! Thanks Kathy!

I have made BLT dip with a mix before, but this far exceeds any of them!  I used bacon bits instead of real bacon, and it tasted fine.  This is a definite make-again dip.

Among all the nacho-cheese and salsa dips at parties, this stands out. I made a double batch of this for two back-to-back parties and prepared the bacon in the oven. Baking bacon tends to make it less crisp than frying. If you like to use the oven for bacon, cook it longer than the package suggests. Whether you bake or fry, I suggest using the food processor to crumble the bacon with less mess (I had VERY greasy fingers after hand-crumbling 2lbs of bacon).

Definitely leave this in the fridge for a few hours (overnight is better) before serving. Yummy!

This got rave review at our family reunion! I used low-fat mayo and light sour cream, and 1/3 less fat bacon. It made me feel better when you couldn't stop eating it. I spread it on a platter and then chopped up iceberg lettuce and chopped and seeded tomatoes and layered that on top, instead of the way the recipe says. So easy! And was the talk of the reunion!

This dip was great.  I did a few modifications, however.  I used the cream cheese but substituted 2 cups light sour cream for the mayo.  I also added 4 ounces of shredded extra sharp cheddar and a couple of minced scallions.  I served it with Melba Toast rounds.  I suggest using a good quality bacon.  I used one of the less expensive brands.  While it was good, and I brought home an empty bowl at the end of the picnic, I think it would have been even better with a better bacon.  Yummy recipe, though.  Thanks.

While answering the door at my latest Christmas party, my greeter kept saying "coats over here, drinks in the kitchen, and a BLT dip that will knock your socks off can be found on the red table." Everyone enjoyed and commented on it. More people than usual asked for the recipe. I cook the bacon in the oven on a large cookie sheet or two- cleaner, easier and quicker if you're doing a big batch.

This was great!  I almost always double this recipe and it always goes.  I use this at fancier functions as well as casual events.  All you have to do is dress up the serving utensils and platters, and garnish it differently.  Always a winner at our house!!

I get requests for me to bring this to any event I'm going to. I always use Oscar Mayer bacon pieces or Hormel. It cuts way down on the work  & mess in cooking the bacon.

Made as listed except I used canned petite diced tomatoes and drained them thoroughly and added a diced medium fresh tomato. We found it to be a little thin at first, see we chilled it before serving. Used Tostitos Scoops for dipping. There were NO leftovers!

I thought this was fantastic as I had tried it at a party. So when I made it myself for a party, I added cream cheese and then baked it for 15 mins on 350. WOW did the flavor get even better!!

Followed other suggestion and I added 8oz of cream cheese and 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese. Then I baked it at 350 for about 20-30 minutes.  Tasted Great and even better the next day.  Served with Tostitos and crackers.

This dip is awesome and is always devoured wherever I take it. On the advice of a few others, I made a few alterations... Some mentioned that using low-fat sour cream and light mayo ruined the taste but I just had to try and get some of the calories/fat grams down (I certainly have made it "full strength" and it was YUM). I used 1/2 cup regular mayo and 1/2 cup light mayo; 1/2 cup fat-free sour cream and 1/2 cup regular; lastly 1/2 lb lower sodium bacon and 1/2 regular. I added in 8 oz of fat-free cream cheese as well as a hand full of mild cheddar shredded cheese. For the tomatoes, I used one large Roma which I cut in half and squeezed over the sink to get the moisture/seeds out before dicing. I added in a couple of shakes of garlic powder and one scallion diced finely. I whipped it all together with the bacon using a hand mixer on the lowest speed. Finally, I stirred in half a can of petite diced tomatoes which I drained in a colander on some paper towels to get all of the moisture I could out before covering with saran wrap and popping into the fridge for a few hours. For serving, I spread the dip into a deep glass pie pan, put a pile of shredded lettuce in the center, topped with some diced tomatoes and the remaining bacon. Most recently we ate it with sea salt bagel chips and Fritos scoops. I am happy to report that the "lightened up" version was gone just as fast!

This dip is AMAZING!! Here are a couple of tips..I toast a loaf of bread and cut the slices in quarters to use as the "chip", I also add pepper to taste, and use the oscar meyer "real bacon" pieces to make it easier (one pouch). This is one of my husbands favorite dips (what man doesnt like bacon)

Very easy to make, can use a variety of crisps to dip. I made it a little more low cal by using bagle chips and greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

Not a fan.  I tried it many different ways using the suggestions of others but did not care for any variation of it.  My friends and co-workers liked it but I probably won't make it again.  Thanks for the submission, though!  :)

I have made this twice now and nobody seems to be able to get enough! It's so creamy and flavorful and easy to make. I serve it with Ritz Crackers though as it gives it the crunch of toasted bread and it taste just like a BLT sandwich. Can't wait fir the next party so I can make this again!

Followed this recipe exactly as stated. Everyone loved it and I loved how easy it was to make. Such a simple recipe for such a great turn out. I fried the bacon in a pan so it would be greasy and great tasting. No health twist for me in this dip! I did add a significant amount of thinly sliced green onion and served it with thin slices of french baguette toasted in the oven with olive oil.

This was a hit! Everyone loved it.. was a bit on the runny side for me.. I'm blaming the sour cream.. I'll use a thicker type next time.

Yummy ..... I used French Onion Sour Cream (store-bought .... not heavy on onion flavor or the brown color) and one thinly sliced green onion (for green color).  Our guests, my husband and I LOVED it.

"as is" I would give this 3 stars-it was too tangy from the sour cream for me.  
The second time I made it, I reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup and added a 1/2 cup of orginal flavored cream cheese cooking cream and it turned out perfect! Just like a BLT!

Very Tasty Dip!!! I made as stated but felt it needed a little something so I added about 1tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Wonderfull! I also toasted some slices of french bread with butter. Not a drop left. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Thanks for the recipe.  Made just a few changes.  Used 3/4 cup Hormel Real Crumbled Bacon (SAMs Club has a 20 oz bag that lasts forever), 1/2 pkg dry Onion Soup and didn't peel or seed tomato.  Chilled in frig overnight.  Sure doesn't last long when served. BIG HIT.

I'm rating this recipe 4 rather than 5 because I had to make changes due to reviews.  First, I cannot be bothered cooking bacon.  Why, when you have the real thing in pkgs and jars?  I added 1 cup real bacon bits, and as another contributor said 1 block of softened cream cheese along with the sour cream. I also added 2 plum tomatoes.  I stirred it all together the day before, yes even the tomatoes, because it gets better overnight.  Everybody loved it with packaged bagel slices.  With all that, it's a 5 star recipe.

This was very good, however, it was missing lettuce. I topped mine with shredded lettuce before serving. Seems fitting to have it on a bLt.

Easy recipe that was a hit at my bar-b-q! I used turkey bacon, low fat sour cream and low fat mayo to cut some of the calories and it still tasted great! Serves great with whole wheat or multi grain bread chunks too.

I changed this up a bit. I felt it was a bit bland, so I added green onion and 1/2 package of Hidden Valley dry ranch mix. Added 1/2 cup grated asiago cheese as well and topped with more green onion and diced Campari tomatoes. Everyone loved it.

This is pure manna from heaven. However I would make this for a football party or tailgate not for a party with the girls or even a potluck because I found that even though everyone LOVED it, they didn't take more than 2 bites because it is so fattening.  My tip is make the dip without the tomatoes and refrigerate as long as possible. Add the tomatoes right before you leave for the party or put them in there, they stay crisp and delicious that way. Be sure to refrigerate the tomatoes first - the colder the better and drain so you don't get the juice into the dip. Yum Yum and more yum - and if you have the right crowd, I suggest putting in more bacon and tomato.

This was a hit at my daughter's first birthday.  I cut up the tomato the night before and let it drain on a paper towel in a container that I placed in the fridge.  I mixed 3/4 of the bacon and 1/4 cup of green onion into the mayo/sour cream mixture and put it into the fridge overnight.  Before serving, I mixed in 3/4 of the tomatoes and topped with the remaining tomatoes, bacon, and a little green onion.  It didn't "WOW" me, like a another reviwer stated, but it was good none the less.  It well received by the majority of the guests.  I mean it has bacon...how could it be bad????

Loved this dip! I served it with garlic pita chips.  I used one 14oz can of petite diced tomatoes drained very well because tomatoes aren't in season here. I also used two 3oz. packages of Oscar Mayer real bacon pieces instead of cooking raw bacon because I can never cook it just perfect.  Turned out fabulously!

This was really easy to make.  I used a container of grape tomatoes that I seeded and diced.  I let them drain  and added them to the dip right before serving it and I think that worked really well.  I sprinkled some of the tomatoes on the top to make it look pretty and if I make it again I will add some sliced green onions for more color and another flavor.  But it was seriously awesome just the way it was!  I served it with wheat thins and fritos.  Just like a BLT!

This is a great recipe that I have been making for years only with one change.  I use 1 cup mayo (not Miracle Whip), 1 cup sour cream, 1 3oz. package of REAL bacon bits and one can drained diced tomatoes with green chiles.  This gives it a little kick and a lot more flavor.  We always serve with fritos scoops.  Awesome!

This is a wonderful potluck recipe i have made several times over the years. I love to serve with cocktail rye bread or pita crisps. For those trying to save time, i would not recommend precooked bacon (heat and serve). It does not yield the bacony taste that goes with BLT's !!!

This was the hit at our football party today. I did bake the bacon at 375 for about 15 minutes, which is a great trick and saves such time on cleanup. One of our friends had taken the pretty much empty bowl back to his seat by the end of the game!I just wish I would have doubled the recipe! Awesome recipe.

The way i served this was a HUGE HIT! I scooped the dip minus the tomates onto ritz crackers, and topped with a slice of Roma tomato. AWESOME! The Roma slices were the perfect fit for the cracker, and tasted wonderful. Place on a tray and serve as an appetizer or finger food.

YUM YUM!!!  This dip is awesome!  I made it for a party and it was gobbled up in no time!  I went ahead and diced my tomatoes and let them sit on a paper towel for a bit before adding them to the dip....it kept the dip from getting runny!  Great recipe!

I thought this was a good starting base - added a chopped green onion, used more tomato and let it drain on a paer towel for a few hours, added pepper, and let the whole dip sit in fridge for 8 hours. Definitely needs to meld to soften bacon and to intensify the flavors. Sprinkled the top with some more tomato and green onion and served with Ritz and celery sticks - was a hit! Thanks!!

Loved the recipe, asked for it over and over again. I made the recipe as described, except for adding 1 packet of ranch dip mix and used 1/2 can of petite diced tomatoes.  It does take overnight for the flavors to spread.  Will make again!!!!

This is such a great recipe, however I did make a few additions to it, I guess that wouldnt make it a BLT, but it was still really good. I added green onion and a bag of sharp shredded cheddar cheese. I mixed 1 cup of the cheese in the dip and the rest on top and put tomatoes on top. I serve with tortilla chips and it gets devoured.

Very tasty with kettle cooked potato chips!  I cooked the bacon in the oven until crispy and used a can of drained petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  It tastes better when it can sit overnight so the bacon flavor gets into the whole dip.  I topped it with some chopped green onions which added a nice mild onion flavor.  This is such a quick and easy dip to whip up when you don't have a lot of time!

This is a suprisingly tasty dip for one with so few ingredients.  This is the same recipe as the one on the back of the large Hormel bacon bits bag-so save yourself some trouble and use those!  Yummers!!

Reduced mayo and added shredded cheese.  Cooked bacon in micro for ease of cleaning up.  Baked in oven until bubbly since I wanted a hot dip.  Easy and had ingredients on hand.  Serve with crusty bread.

This is very heavy, but very GOOD!! I make it for all of my husbands get togethers and the men just eat it up. Tried at a ladies event and found that after they learned what it consisted of it was much less popular.

This was super easy to make, and was delicious! I took advice from another reviewer, and used a can of petite diced tomatoes drained. I added green onions too. People were actually just eating it without chips! I also had several people ask me for the recipe!

I made this dip for a 'sweet and savory' contest and WON!!  I should have doubled the recipe because it went...and went quick!  I stuck with the recipe except added some scallions and salt and pepper.  Served with toasted baguette slices and bagel chips.  The recipe is even easy to give out..just one of everything!

It could not have been any easier.  I made this all summer for the countless number of cookouts we went to.  A quick tip for making the bacon is to put it in a large aluminum pan on the BBQ grill for about 25 minutes on medium.  It saves the grease and mess in your house in the hot weather.  Everyone loved it and I had to constantly double the recipe for larger crouds.

This was great!  A friend had made this dip before, but hers wasn't as good as this one.  I used salad dressing instead of mayo...I just prefer the taste.  And I was in a hurry, I didn't peel or seed the tomato, but it was still fabulous. I serve with melba toast or bagel chips. I made it for a group of friends and they asked me to make it again this month.

This was really good!  I made with 1/2 cup mayo and 1-1/2 cup sour cream, but then added a squirt more mayo cause it tasted too sour-creamy.  Next time i'll just follow the recipe.  Also, very salty, so try low-sodium bacon.  Make sure the bacon gets crispy, too.  I added more tomato than the recipe calls for (didn't seed it... no need for it, it disappears anyway).  Also, per other's suggestions I added green onion.  It definitely fit.  I served w/ritz sticks, triscuits and tortilla chips... I thought the ritz was too heavy, the triscuits too thick, and the tortillas just right .... VERY YUMMY.

A favorite now for everyone who knows me! So simple and quick to make, but really a "WOW"-er. Good served with cracker stix. Also easy to adjust ingredients, ie- if you are more of a tomato person, you can put more of them in.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!  I toasted a whole loaf of white bread in the oven-to get it VERY taosty, cut the crusts off and wow did I have a fancy dip!  I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe put the bacon in a food processor to chop up  very fine.  That's all though. I will bring this again and again!

Great idea! Place the dip into a bowl and place it on a bed of iceberg lettuce for a great presentation! Also good with the small squares of the cocktail breads. Sourdough bread is great with it!

This is a very simple and tasty dip. It gets all its flavor from the bacon, so be sure to use good center-cut bacon, which crisps up well. I added extra tomato, because one tomato didn't balance the flavor. (One very large tomato would have been perfect.) I found that the flavor improved after being in the fridge overnight. Don't be afraid to make the dip the night before you want to serve it. It doesn't turn soupy from the tomato (that is, as long as you seed the tomato properly). I served the dip with wheat crackers.

Ok, I was totally dubious to try this recipe, even with all the wonderful reviews.  It lurked on my mind though, and I tried it out for a potluck today.  It was fantastic.  I made it last night and let the flavors meld together awhile, then added the tomatoes right before serving.  Soooo good.  I served it with a fresh baked sourdough round that I cut into cubes.  I definately definately think fresh tomatoes are key here.  Wonderful!  Thanks Kathy.

I was so excited about this after reading all the reviews. Alas, it didn't turn out as tasty as I'd hoped. If I make it again, I'll be sure to not burn the bacon at all (that taste really permeated the dip), and to only let the dip set for an hour or two. It was much too salty and hard when I served it the following morning.

I made this dip for our daughters birthday party yesterday and although the "birthday girl" didn't care for it, everyone else did. Even my non dip eating husband said "wow, this stuff tastes just like a BLT"! I did add some black pepper and a little garlic and onion powders. A delicious and unique dip Kathy!

When I first mixed the ingredients and tasted it, I was disappointed. Tasted very mayonnaisey - BUT WAIT....overnight in the fridge it developed a wonderful flavor and everyone raved about this. I
cooked the bacon and then put everything in the food processor for a bit.  Very, very good.

Easy & delicious!   I've made this dip several times and have discovered it is absolutely essential to use a high quality prepared mayonnaise like Hellmann's.  I serve this on a bed of shredded lettuce with sliced, toasted French baguettes and get compliments every time.  Thanks for sharing!

I have never ever made dip before and had no idea how easy it was!  This recipe turned out so good!  I did make a few changes, I ommited the tomatos (don't like em) but....added super good shredded cheddar and chopped green onions.  I made this one day before the function and tasted even better the next day cause the flavors were able to mingle.  Wanted to serve with dip chips but ran out of time and used the Ritz that were on hand, worked wonderfully.

"I was very surprised how much people loves this dip, I'm personally not a big fan of bacon, so I didnt really found it that amazing, but I guaranteed that this will be a hit anywhere you go. I you love bacon you will love this. I will definetly make it again for others. I however did added extra sour cream, some red onions and lettuce. Awesome that people likes it and that is soo.. easy to make!!!!"

I first made this dip for my nephew's birthday party and everyone loved it!  I was asked again to make it for Chirstmas.  Since then we've had it 3 times for family gatherings.  It's so easy and it tastes great!  The only thing I do differently then the original recipe is add a very small amount of shredded lettuce.

This was a most peculiar recipe in that it tasted like nothing particularly special... but then when we started eating it, found we couldn't stop!  Not much point in serving this with crackers, I reckon.  Good crusty bread or toast is the way to go.  Unlike other reviewers, I found this kept quite well, and made a great sandwich filling the next day.

I've been making this dip since 2003 and the first party I took it to back then, I got a few comments but nothing like I expected.  I must've been with a bunch of snobs because lately (and I mean over the past 2 years) I've had nothing but rave reviews about this dip.  I get requests to bring it to parties and to my poker nights.  I use the already cooked Oscar Mayer bacon and nuke each sheet for 45 seconds to crisp it up.  I also add a little shredded lettuce so that it's a true B "L" T. I rated this 4 stars back then, but it truly is worthy of 5.  I also serve it in a bread bowl for convenience and appearance.

This was a hit at a party that my husband and I had, 2 hours into the party I was in the kitchen frying another pan of bacon. At one point I caught my 3 year old nephew scooping dip out of the bowl with his fingers.

I made this dip for New Year's Eve after I read the tremendous quantity of positive reviews- and they weren't kidding! Every woman at the party asked for the recipe and it was gobbled up! I served it with baguette rounds, but will toast them in the future.

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe - I thought it was overpowered by the mayo.  I think real bacon bits would work just as well, and save time.  I added alot more bacon to the recipe and shredded lettuce, but all I could taste was the mayo.  I don't think I'd make this recipe again.

This is very flavorful.  I can't believe it really does taste like a BLT.  I added very thinly sliced green onions and shredded lettuce on top along with the chopped tomatoes.  It sure didn't last long!

Very good! I used 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, 1 lite cream cheese. Also added about 1/2 ranch mix and about a cup of cheddar cheese. Chopped 2 plum tomatoes in the mix.  On top, chopped bacon and 1 plum tomato and 3 green onions.

Well this was a wonderful find.  I did use grape tomatoes chopped a little and okay, fine, I did add  little bit extra bacon and it was awesome.  I liked the fresh tomatoes, though I am sure the canned ones would work if you were stuck.  It was nice to have something not spicy for a change.  I would think that if you left out the tomatoes and then hollowed out cherry tomatoes and put the filling in it would be amazing.  Green onion and maybe chopped fresh spinach would be good for colour too.  Serving this in tostitos scoops would be yummy too.  Thank you!

This dip was very delicious & so easy to make! I made the recipe exactly as written and served it with baguette slices. I put the dip into a bowl lined with lettuce. I will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely addicting! A "go to" party recipe! I followed others' advice -- doubled recipe; cooked bacon in oven; added cream cheese and shredded cheddar; used canned, petite diced tomatoes well drained; also added red onion. Did not bake this time but will try next time. Served on iceberg lettuce "bowls" with shredded lettuce on the side. Ritz Crisps and Tostitos Scoops. It's a diet buster but worth it.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a hit.  I decreased the mayo by half and subbed cream cheese for the difference.

Well, I have to say, pretty yummy; BUT, there wasn't enough bacon!!!! Next time I will double the bacon and tomato; yeah, I said it :P Also, make it in a bread bowl and serve with bread, it paired well with pumpernickel and the Hawaiian bread; not so yummy with tortilla chips :P

Run the crisped bacon through your food processor to make sure the pieces are very small. DO NOT USE BACON BITS or any kind of packaged bacon pieces. You really need fresh.

This is near-exact to how my family has made this for years, only we slice a tomato & throw it all in. Always a hit at parties or for a snack, which usually turns into a whole meal. :) A guilty pleasure of mine! We serve with slices of white bread cut in triangles.

I listened to the 'most helpful' review and added the package of cream cheese and two cups of shredded cheese. I baked this at 350 for about 20 minutes and added the lettuce and tomatoes on top right before serving. Some people commented that it looked like taco dip so I had to explain. It was a HUGE hit though and was devoured before the end of the night. I served this with fritos and tortilla chips. Will definitely make this again.

Was suppose to bring a bacon themed appetizer to a party. Thought I'd give this a try...Surprised that it tasted so much like a BLT. I placed dip on a bed of shredded lettuce for the "L" that was missing. Served with plain Ruffles. MUST cook your own bacon! It went fast! Used 2 tomatoes.

Really good dip, was a hit at the Superbowl party. I did use a half can of tomato paste just to get more tomato flavor. I also garnished with shredded lettuce. I might try a bit of garlic powder in it next time.

I make this all the time and always get compliments on this!! To make it even easier I usually use Oscar Mayer Real Bacon Bits and it tastes just as good!! Also instead of chips I make a bunch of toast and serve it on that. Very good.

I have made this recipe several times and I use the bacon pieces for recipes that come in a small bag, if you don't have time to fry or bake your bacon. I have made it both ways and always rave reviews! Great Dip!

I am of the school that there can never be enough bacon! But there was FAR too much of the "sauce". I doubled the recipe as suggested by several.  Seemed like one would not be enough.  I was wrong.  I had more leftovers than I could use. I also found that there were a number of people who wouldn't have any because it was primarily sour cream and mayonnaise. If I make this recipe again I will increase the tomatoes and decrease the mayo and sour cream.  But in theory, I'm sure this is a great recipe.

Amazing!!  Everyone loved it.  Be sure to cut the bacon very small, and cook very crispy as it will soften up in the dip.

I made this delicious dip for card club.  I did add some green onion to mix and added the bacon right before serving.  I did not want the bacon getting mushy.  It was huge hit, and I came home with an empty bowl.  I served this with ‘Pita Chips’ and ‘Perfect Pita Chips’, both AR recipes.  Thanks Kathy W. for sharing your recipe.

Made this for a football get together. I decided to use canned diced tomatos as suggested (I used Italian diced which had some basil...quite good). I drained about 3/4 c on paper towels very well and mixed them in at the last minute and saved a few for garnish on top.I added a few shakes of onion powder and cayenne to taste.Total hit, I would easily make it again. Aside from the bacon it could be lower in fat by using Fat free sour cream and fat free mayo. I used 1/2 fat mayo and light sour cream with no adverse affects.

This was soooo GOOD!!! Brought this to our annual block party and there wasn't a SINGLE drop left! Even my picky hubs liked this dip. :) Although I'm sure this would be fine as is, I made a couple of changes. I added ~ 4 chopped green onions and a T or so of dry Ranch dressing mix as another reviewer suggested. To keep my dip "light," I used reduced-fat mayo / sour cream (no one could tell the difference haha). For a pretty presentation, I cut the top off of a head of iceberg lettuce for a unique way to serve my dip (FYI, only cut off a little bit or else your "bowl" will fall apart - you can always refill as necessary!). Everyone thought my idea was fun and cute! Served with Ruffles chips (you'll need a sturdy chip to scoop up this thick dip), but I think mini garlic toasts or bagel chips would also work well. Thanks for sharing, Kathy. I'll be making this many times to come, I'm sure! :-)

WOW! This is amazing! I did not make any changes, except to double the recipe for a big neighborhood barbeque. This really does taste just like a BLT! Everyone loved this dip. I will definitely make this again, and I'm sure it will be requested!

The dip tasted very good.  After it sat a while, the bacon got very soft in a way I didn't like.

I love this dip, love the flavor and everything. I usually dice up the bacon before I fry it. I was advised to use on the vine tomatoes but I will try Roma next time and not use the seedy part since it wasn't as thick, but still yummy! Also, I do 1/2 cup Mayo and 1/2 salad dressing for mine. So gooood!

Made it for the first time with the baked version (cream cheese plus cheddar cheese) and it was awesome! Great dip especially for something out of the norm.

Tastes just like a BLT sandwich - especially if you serve them with little slices of bagel or those cute little mini bread loaf pieces!  Easy to prepare, more flavor if you make a few hours ahead of time.

Not sure what to say about this dip. It is yummy. The reason I give it 4 stars is because the short list of ingredients, that are usually on hand. But the dip itself was just odd and not what I would take to a gathering. I am sure most folks I know would scarf it up though, it just seemd lacking. 
It really was good, I tried it with a fork and had to stop myself from eating more. It's more of something I would pour over sliced tomatoes and have for lunch. Definitiely tasty. Followed the recipe to a T, the quantities called for are spot on.
*UPDATE, Got Kings hawiian bread snackers rolls and made a sammy with this dip OMG to die for! YUM.

I read one of the other reviews said "either you like it or you don't."  I just didn't.  It did taste like a BLT if you like your BLT smothered in mayo.  I couldn't really figure out what kind of thing to use as a dipper.  Tried pita chips, crackers, carrots.  Just didn't like it.  Oh well.

Definitely make this the night before, tomatoes and all. I tasted it last night and thought, Oh no, what mess have I made? It tasted like straight mayo. But today when I served it, it was awesome. The only thing I added were a few green onions right before serving. Loved this!

Yummy! This went over a treat at our summer BBQ. Note to those making this in the UK.....use more mayo and a tad less soured cream. UK soured cream is rather runny compared to the US version, so your dip will be too liquidy if made according to the directions listed.  Alternately, you could stir in some cream cheese in order to thicken in up a bit.  That's what I did.  I also added sliced spring (green) onions, and am considering adding a touch of kale to the next batch. Very good dip!  My father in law decided he wanted this as a spread in his ham sandwiches instead of just plain mayo. I have to admit, that would be a great way to jazz up a plain ham sammy.  :)

I've been making this dip several years now, first as a potluck contribution mainly because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I make it frequently for family gatherings and it is always a hit.  The only changes I make is to use the precooked Hormel bacon bits and something green like chives or green onions.  The best tasting tomatoes are roma or grape tomatoes...be sure to remove the seeds and liquid.  I've always used light mayo and sour cream...plenty rich enough.  I really don't understand people who play with the recipe then complain that it doesn't turn out right.

I've been making this dip for several years. It's always well received.  I serve mine with toast. I use sandwich bread, toast it and cut into an X so that I end up with four triangles. In a pinch, with not much time I have also used Hormel Real Bacon Bits instead of cooking my bacon.

Okay, so people seemed to like this because they ate it all. But...I followed these additions from another reviewer: "I added 8oz of cream cheese and 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese. Then I baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes." It seemed like all the oil from all the fatty stuff separated.  I would perhaps try to slim this down in the future somehow.  But people still downed it! Even though it was kind of oily. So, maybe next time, totally skip the cheddar cheese. That would probably help.

As is, my fam rated the recipe a 4.  Quick and tasty dip. We also made a version adding only shedded lettuce on the top and shedded cheese.  We liked that better, but both are really good. Just depends on your taste.

I made this for our company luncheon. Let's just say it is only 9 am it is already half way gone ~ I have gotten so many rave reviews and requests for the recipe!!! I did double the recipe, only used 1 1/2 cups of mayo since some had mentioned too strong of a mayo taste. Added 2 - 8 oz. packages of cream cheese and added some dry ranch seasoning. Too coin a phrase from Rachael Ray...YUMMO!

Very good dip that does taste like a BLT!  I added some sliced green onion and a bit of ms. dash.  I had a friend serve this dip on top of tomato slices, and that was delicious.  I think I will try it warm with the added cream cheese.  This is a very versatile recipe!

Definitely should have put in the full pound of bacon.  Six strips was just not enough!  Followed other reviewers' suggestions about the tomato, to good effect.  Next time will try using low-fat mayo and turkey bacon to cut back on the fat content.  Also, will cut the tomato pieces smaller for ease of dipping.  Still, it did taste exactly like a BLT, and my guests loved it!

I found this yesterday and made it for Super Bowl.  Everyone loved it - my husband best of all.  He ate what little bit was left over today!  I made it just the way it called for and will make it again the next time I need an appetizer!

This one is a big hit with all my friends. Instead of cooking the bacon in a skillet, I bake it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20mins. Also because i'm really bad a cutting tomatoes and not making a mess, I buy the containers of already cut up tomatoes in the produce department. I serve the dip with wheat thins which really bring out the flavor.

Used base recipe with a few additives as suggested by others. This includes: full container of whipped cream cheese, liquid hickory smoke, and chives. Bacon was also done in the oven, and generously peppered beforehand. Garnished with fresh bacon crumbles, pimentos, chives and fresh ground pepper. At the party, this dish always had the most attention, while it lasted.

This was just OK... probably would not make it again.  I've tried it twice.  The first time with reduced fat mayo (that was all I had).  I am NOT rating this based on that.  I hate it when someone rates a recipe based on the changes they made!  Rate the original recipe!  So the second time I did use original Hellman's mayo and I still wasn't that fond of the dip.

This is a very yummy, simple dip recipe.  I brought this to work, my office gobbled it up.  I took another reviewers suggestion and seeded/diced my tomatoes and set them aside to drain, so the dip turned out creamy rather than runny.  I also added some garlic salt and fresh chives, delish.

Very good.  Tastes just like the name.  It was great the day I made it; but the next day it did become runny and really wasn't enjoyable.  I even seeded the tomatoes and chopped just the skins.  If it will all be eaten the day of; no worries.  It was a hit!

Very good recipe!!!   I like to add a 1/2 package of dry ranch mix.   Yummy!!!   I have also added chives for a little extra flavor.   I serve mine with cut up pieces of bagel.

Great, tasty, easy recipe!  Although, it should technically be called "BLT dip withouth the L". =)  I actually thought it would be kinda blah.  But the group I made it for loved it.  Great with Ritz crackers.  And you could always sprinkle chopped lettuce on top for you BLT purists out there.  =)

This is always a hit when I make it. After I cut up the tomatoes I lay them on a couple of paper towels to get rid of the juice. I also add about 1/4 cup of shredded chedar cheese for color.

I have made this receipe twice, and both times it was the first thing gone!  My sister in law is also now making it to rave reviews.  After reading some of the reviews, I can tell you that I just microwave the bacon or buy the real bacon bits.  Both work!  Also, it is a must that you use a REAL tomato, not canned.  I will continue making this over and over!  DELICIOUS!!!!

I made this dip for a dinner I hosted last night and it wasn't received very well.  Initially I cut the recipe in half, added all the ingredients and tasted it and all I could taste is mayonnaise! Needless to say, I ended up doubling the amount of sour cream and I reduced the amount of bacon as I felt it was just too much.  In the end, it wasn't really our cup of tea; only a few people tried it and they didn't go back for seconds! :(

This is such an addictive dip! It is really fattening, so I can't fix it as often as I want because I'd eat it all by myself!! I serve this with melba toast and it really tastes like blt on toast!

Tastes just like BLT's, so if you like BLT's you won't be disapointed with this one. I really cut down on prep time by buying hormell bacon pieces from Sam's club, so all I had to do was mix it all together- doesn't get much better. Will make again for sure!!

This is an awesome recipe.  I've made it numerous times and the only thing I'd change if you made it would be to double the recipe!  The first time I made it, everyone fought over it!

Not bad for my first attempt; my coworkers enjoyed it as well. I used well drained diced tomatoes, as other reviews suggested. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm giving this 5 stars only with some of the changes I made after reading the reviews. First I added a softened brick of cream cheese, reduced the mayo and sour cream to 3/4 cup each, and added half a package of dry ranch dressing. I also just sprinkled the tomatoes on top so picky eaters could take them off. This was good served with crackers and also as a sandwich spread!

I make this using a can of Rotel that I drained mostly dry using a cheese cloth in place of the tomato.  I also added about 3tbsp minced green onion.

This dip is AWESOME! I fried a pound of bacon and added it to 1 1/2 cups of real mayo and 1 1/2 cups of light sour cream (instead of 1 cup each) because I needed a little bit more dip. I also added just a little bit of bacon bits. I left the tomatoes out because my husband cannot stand them and the dip was still AMAZING!! I served with Fritos. I thought people were going to pick up the bowl and start licking it clean after the dip was gone!

I just made this recipe for the first time. It went over well at my daughter's birthday party, however I thought it tasted overwhelmingly like mayo. I used light mayo and reg sour cream. I even added extra sour cream, but still could only taste mayo. Next time will use 3/4 c mayo and 1 1/2 c sour cream. I used real bacon bits and let it sit overnight. That seemed to work well.  I seasoned with garlic powder and  added the tomatoes  right before serving and topped with green onions. I served it with white toast points. My father could not stop eating it.

I've had this in my recipe box so long, and Super Bowl Sunday was a good day to try it--glad I did! I used light mayo, bacon bits, and cherry tomatoes. I tasted it as is and thought it needed just a little something, added green onions, and for me it was just right. I knew Hubby would like it saltier, so I added some powdered Ranch dressing mix, and then he loved it--said it was good stuff! I can't wait to try this with homegrown tomatoes during the summer. Served it with Ruffles.

Made a batch of this for my husbands "Boys Night" and they devoured it! I seeded the tomatoes to keep them from making the dip too mushy. I also put the bacon in the food processor to get it into really small bits. They dipped just about everything into it with much satisfaction. Though I think buttery crackers or chips are best.

I've brought this to 3 different parties and it goes fast!  It's so incredibly easy to make and very inexpensive.  I use the microwavable pre-cooked bacon because it's not as greasy as regular and much easier to deal with from the standpoint of clean up.  This dip is a winner!

This is delicious-I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it, I was handing out the recipe left and right. The only thing I did different was go 1/2 mayo 1/2 miracle whip, I like the sweetness it gives it, but otherwise it's very yummy.

Everyone loved this dip. I added green onions and black pepper. I did not peel the tomatoes. Some reviewers said this dip was runny and I did not find that to be the case at all. Perhaps they did not seed and dry the tomatoes before adding. Oh, I also used Hormel bacon already cooked and crumbled. It made making this dip so easy. I thought the dip was salty when combined with ruffle chips and Ritz Crackers but no one else seemed to think so. I will definately make again.

So simple and tasty.  My guests were asking for the recipe and were happy to hear how simple it was.  The only thing I changed was adding chopped green onion.  I also used light mayo and added the tomato to the mix the night before without a problem.  I served this with potato chips as well as corn chips.

I added green onions as suggested.  It was good...but nothing special.  I won't make it again.

WOW!!! This was great. Everyone loved this, except my hubby who doesn't like tomatoes.  

This is always gone pretty quickly.  For even easier cooking I microwave the bacon.  Also I use a bread bowl and buy an xtra loaf of french bread, cut it up and toast it for dipping.

Made it twice now and everyone loved it.  I took advice and added whipped cream cheese with either garlic or chive/onion.  Also added a few green onions.  Used grape tomatoes and didn't drain or seed.  VERY GOOD!  I'm going to go have some right now!

I was so amazed at how much it really tasted like BLT!  I put it in a sourdough bread bowl and used the dug out bread instead of crackers to dip.

This was fabulous. I also drained the tomatoes (I used two) for a couple hours. The dip stayed creamy that way. I will definitely make this again.

Ok, maybe I'm too particular but the name and description of this dip bothers me because there is no lettuce called for in the recipe. But besides that...this was just ok. Nobody went crazy for it. I do think a lb of bacon is way too much. I don't think I'll save this one. There are many better dips out there.

very tasty.  it's thick though, so it's better to serve with crackers - chips break into the dip too easily.

I've been making this for potlucks for years, and never have to bring any home!!! I prefer an extra tomato, and serve it in a cut out sourdough bowl, using the bread instead of crackers or chips (kind of like spinach dip in pumpernickle).  Also garnish with endive or something leafy so the wiseguy in the office can't ask where the "L" is!!!

Very good. I served it with the rectangular Keebler style crackers. I would reccommend putting some of the bacon pieces to the side and saving them to sprinkle on top of the dip with some of the tomatoes as well; this gives guests an idea of what the dip is - and makes it look more festive.  Definately make ahead and refrigerate to make the flavors blend - I did add a little onion powder.

There is never a family fuction that this dip doesn't get made for. Try it on your burgers too and you'll see why. We use real bacon pieces (not the bits)from a jar which makes the process much faster.

Excellent easy dip. I agree with others that it didn't have enough of the tomato taste so I added half a can of tomato soup. I also added a block of cream cheese. With thos additions, it was great!!! A big hit at our New Year's party.

This dip is good.  Make sure you chop the tomatoes small.  When I make it next I am going to cut the amount of mayo and sour cream to 3/4 cup.

The only thing not eaten at my shower this weekend.  Taste was ok but nobody even wanted a second cracker.  I doubled the bacon, but it was just a runny, and bland dip.

Didn't like this one bit -- the mayonnaise overwhelms everything and I even cut back on it. I think I will stick to buying the readymade BLT dip from Sam's Club.

Took this dip to a football party and it was all eaten up, and everyone at the party asked me for the recipe. I took the suggestion of others and added a couple green onions and some fresh cracked pepper. I served it with butter crackers and triscuts. Super easy and very tasty!

This dip is incredibly bland and boring when it is first made.  I let it sit for a few hours and it had a little more flavor; maybe 5-6 hours would have given me the results I was looking for.  Overall it was okay, but I felt like kicking myself for not making the Cucumber Toasties (also on this site) instead.

This recipe was absolutely loved by everyone!  Made it for the 4th and it was a big hit.  Definitely helps to have crisp bacon.  I put it in a french bread bowl and served with small pieces of french bread.  Tasted wonderful!!!

This was good; I made half a recipe for a smaller crowd.  I did make the bacon very crisp and crush it fairly finely, which reduced potential "sog".  Next time I will add pepper and scallions as suggested by others, as I thought it needed a little extra flavor.

I was disappointed because this recipe had gotten such good reviews.  I made the dip right before I served it and it had absolutely no taste.  I tried it again the next day and it had a strong bacon taste, so my advice is to make it at least a several hours ahead of time.   ... Very fatty!

You absolutely must cut the bacon into tiny tiny pieces because if they are too big they just get soggy and then have an awful chewy texture in the dip.  Needs a little onion in it and some garlic.  Overall ok, but probably won't make it again.

Based on ingredient and reviews I decided to try to spice this up a bit to serve at a party.  I used 3/4 cup mayo, 3/4 cup sour, 3/4 cup onion & chive cream cheese.  I also added a bit of garlic and a couple dashes of cayenne pepper.  It really turned out well.  Goes great with potato chips, wheat thins, ritz and veggies.

This recipe sounded good but it wasn't anything special.  I wasn't too fand of it but my friends liked it.  I feel like i wasted a pound of bacon.  If i decide to make again i will add some onion or somthing to give it some more flavor.

A definite hit in my house!!  It really does taste like a BLT.  We served it with toasted Texas Toast.  One thing, you've gotta use real mayo.

Fantastic dip!  I made it with real mayo several times.  Once I was out of mayo and used Miracle Whip.  (Big mistake!)  It just wasn't the same.  People still liked it, but I knew it wasn't as good as it could have been.  Stick with the mayo!

Awesome! The flavor of this dip is yummy! The very first time I made it, everyone asked for the recipe! Its a very easy dip. Instead of frying and to save time, I've used the "Real Crumbled Bacon" by Hormel and the flavor was still awesome! Definitely a keeper!

This was GREAT!  I've already given it out to about a dozen people.  I made it at my daughter's h.s. graduation party and got raves.  I also added scallions and I bought the Hormel pre-cooked bacon and just crisped it up.  It saved loads of time.

I guess I was expecting a Knock-Out dip based on all the 5 star ratings and awesome reviews.  My family liked it, I found it to be just OK.  I took other reviewers' advice and cut down on the amount of mayo added.  I might make again just based on my guests' comments, but I've made many  other appetizer recipes that were much better received.

I made a double batch of this dip for sandwich night at my house. 
I blanched 2 tomatoes, peeled and seeded them first& chopped up then covered them in kosher salt and ground peppercorns and put them aside while I cooked bacon and chopped up green onions.( followed review suggestions on those) I mixed it all together (including jazzed up tomatoes) and threw it in the fridge for an hour or so while I got the rest ready. 
Instant hit!!!
We are even going to make this in the larger (empty) sour cream tubs to use on sandwiches and snacks during the week. 
Thanks much for this one!
5+ stars!!

This was really great. Extremely fattening, but the good stuff usually is!  I added some green onion and used a can of mild Rotel (drained), like I had seen suggested and it was a big hit. I served it with sliced french bread.

This is delightful! Made this for a New Year's Eve get-together and received good feedback. Used real bacon which gives it good flavor.  Also let it sit with the sour cream and mayo for an hour so the flavors blend.  Took one of the other tips and used the Hunt's petite diced tomatos. I strained them through a colander and pressed gently with a spoon to get rid of all the juice.  However, I served it with toasted bread squares and think it is far better that way than with chips or crackers.  This one is a keeper!

Huge hit at the bowling party.  I used lowfat mayo and fat free sour cream.  Tasted GREAT!  Must use real bacon.  I mixed it all except the tomatoes early in the day to blend the flavors then added the chopped tomatoes after I got to the party and served it in a bread bowl.  It was devoured!

Since we don't like mayo in my house, I substituted 1 6oz pkg softened cream cheese and 1 cup + of sour cream.  I also add some chopped scallions and shredded cheddar.  Doesn't look too pretty, but tastes great!!!
Ok, this is an addition to this review:  I made this dip this afternoon because I had all the ingredients on hand and didnt want them to go to waste.  I made some frozen potato skins with cheese on them and topped with this dip and WOW!!  This is my favorite snack/dip.  I actually have cravings for it.  Yummy!

This was delicious. I used 1 and 1/3  cups of sour cream and 2/3 cup of mayo. I also added in some chopped scallions.  Next time I may try adding some shredded cheddar cheese too.  I served it with broken up french bread.

Very easy and simple! Especially if you buy the precooked bacon! It's even better made the day before you serve it. Just wait and add the tomatoes right before you serve it.

I took this to a party yesterday, and everyone loved it.  At least 5 people asked for the recipe. It was delicious just the way it was, but I think I'll add a little chopped onion next time, as some have suggested.

This was super good and super easy.  It's amazing how much it really tastes like a BLT.  I didn't feel like taking the time to seed the tomatoes so I just chopped up little plumb tomatoes.  For a great, quick appetizer, this is it!

I took some of the suggestions from the other reviews such as replacing the mayo w/ cream cheese (my husband hates mayo) adding green onion and pepper.  And waiting until just before serving to add the tomatoes and g. onion. This recipe was good. One of my guests couldn't put it down, but I thought it was going to be this great recipe that blew everyone away- it didn't.  But still a nice dip to serve.

I've made this several times and it is always a hit. I don't bother peeling the tomatos but I do get rid of the seeds. My son even called and asked for the recipe.

I have taken this to parties since I first tried it over the summer.  I love it and my family craves it all the time.  We actually think the longer it sits in the fridge, the better it tastes day by day! I don't make the bacon real crispy, we like it better a little chewy.  Very tasy!!  Always requested of me when there is a party or picnic!

No one can believe this tastes so great and is so simple.  Only drawback...it doesn't keep well overnight.  I do cook the bacon ahead to give me a headstart.

I make this dip often as it is always a hit,a few hints: chop bacon up into tiny pieces before you cook it, it cooks faster and gets crispier. Also I add 2-3 chopped green onions. Always a hit; always end up handing out the recipe. I call it "heart attack dip"! But it's worth it! :)

This was really good.  It took a while to fry all the bacon, and you really need to eat all the dip in one day, it's not really good the next.  I added some finely diced onion too.

This recipe got RAVES when I took it to a gathering. I changed the recipe a little bit. I substituted 1/2 cup of Ojai "light" mayonnaise (a specialty spicy citrus mayo) and 1/2 cup of the Hellmans Reduced Fat mayo (Hellmans is the best mayo out there and the only reduced fat mayo worth eating) to equal the full cup of mayo. I also used reduced fat sour cream, lower sodium bacon (as another reviewer here suggested) and two chopped green onions and I served it on a bed of shredded lettuce. Fabulous! I'll be making this again and again.

Wasn't sure how this dip would taste, but I am glad I tried it.  The trick to cut the salt is to use low sodium bacon.  Also, make sure the tomatoes are added at the last minute prior to serving.  Tried some of the dip the next day and it had a watered down taste.  Great with shredded lettuce garnish and crunchy melba toast.  Yummy thanks!

I made this for a pool party and it was the first thing gone.  Everyone loved it.  Served it with a variety of crackers as well as party -sized pumpernickel slices.  Really pretty with shredded lettuce and tomatoes on top.  Yummy!

This is such a yummy recipe!  Very easy, and it holds well in the refrigerator.  I've also had it with toast that's been cut into little triangles which is yummy too, but not for humid days (toast will get soggy).  My kids liked it, but they picked around the tomatoes.

Everyone loved this.  I would definitely add the finely chopped green onions - my sister-in-law and I showed up with this same dip she didn't add them - mine was gone by the end of the night!!! I used  regular flavored snack crackers and it was delicious!

I doubled this recipe for a party and while it got raves reviews, I personally thought it was a tad too salty because of the large amount of bacon.  Next time I do this, I will scale down a bit on the bacon and then it will be *perfect*!

I have made this dip with FatFree mayo and sour cream, as well as regular mayo and sour cream.  It is great and easy both ways.  I shredded lettuce and made a wreath around the serving/dip bowl.  With Melba toast it really tastes like a BLT.  My friends and family love it.

I just took this dip to a family picnic and let me tell you that it did not last very long.  It was gone within a 1/2 hour.  I had three people ask for the recipe as soon as their first taste. This was definitely a hit.  Thank you for sharing this great dip recipe.

This dip is really good if you put shredded lettuce on top of the dip and then cut up a couple of loaves of french bread to use as dippers.  It is usually the first thing gone.

I had a friend introduce me to BLT dip about 10 years ago. It is amazing! I made this dip last night for a Labor Day get together today and it was as good as I remember it being 10 years ago. As written, this recipe is already 5 stars. I did mine a little different this time around, I added Pure Ground Black Pepper, Red Cayenne Pepper, Cherry Tomatoes with the skin and quite a bit of shredded Colby Jack cheese. It was wonderful, I’m still eating on it. Great hit with the family too! Thanks for sharing!

Did not add anything, just followed the recipe.  So easy and simple to make.  Made it 2 hours before a New Year's Eve party we attend each year at my neighbor's house.  I dropped it off with the hostess so she could put it out for guests and then had to head home to get my husband.  By the time we came back to the party the dip was almost completely gone and everyone at the party couldn't stop saying how much they loved it!  I will definitely make it again.

I've made this several time and I'm always asked for the recipe! The changes I made are to add about 1-1/2 tablespoons of  dry ranch seasoning (to taste) and throw in a handful of shredded cheddar cheese to give it more "body".   Refrigerate overnight and top with chopped tomatoes and bacon before serving. Its sooo good!  If taking it to a gathering, make sure you take copies of the recipe because people will definitely ask for it!

Caution!!!!! This dip is ADDICTING! My grandmother taught me how to make it and everyone always asks me to bring it wherever I go. I add cheddar cheese to mine. I usually use a whole container of mayonnaise and about 2 containers of sour cream plus the bacon, tomatoes and cheddar cheese to make enough for a party or cookout and it still goes super fast! This is great with pretty much any type of crackers or Hawaiian rolls, it's also great on a burger! I always put some in a container before I go anywhere to make sure I get some all to myself ??

Didn't like and wouldn't make again. Boring and plain. I read all the wonderful rave reviews about how it was devoured and people wanting the recipe. That didn't happen at my party and  I made it to the "T".  No one wanted the recipe and it was barely touched.

This is my favorite appetizer.  You can't add too much bacon.         I serve this with toasted crostini.  This is the recipe I am asked about most often.

I make as directed and add a little garlic and onion salt. Serve with those little toast crackers that you find by the deli or fancy cheese section in the groceries. Delicious. I will try adding cheddar cheese and baking it next time. Love the idea of serving it in a big lettuce cup.

Made this for a Father's Day BBQ. My grandfather said, "I can't stop eating this!" I added 4 oz. of cream cheese and chives.

I made this for the guys at work. They loved it but for me was a bit rich tasting. It was too much bacon next time I will try 1/2 lbs. I did add shredded lettuce and chives. But in all was just ok.

Luckily, I only made a half batch, but I wish I had cut it down even more.   I tried it with pita chips and Fritos.  I felt like I was eating mayo. The taste was too strong.  My husband gave it 2 stars.

This recipe is amazing. Whenever I make it or bring it to an event, everyone asks me for the recipe. I also add a small can of tomato paste(i use about 1/2 or 3/4's of the can, unless I double the recipe I'll use the entire can) to enhance the tomato flavor, which made it perfect. I also add shredded lettuce and extra diced tomatoes. I toast baguette slices for dipping! This dip still tastes great with light sour cream/mayo.

I made this the day before a Super Bowl party that I was attending so that the flavors would "marry".  Have to say that I was very disappointed in how it tasted~~it was the only thing at the party that didn't get devoured and I'm hoping no one knows it was me that brought it! I used the canned petite diced tomatoes and they were well drained and they were even placed on a paper towel after draining in colander~~dip wasn't runny.

This dip was very well liked at the Super Bowl party I attended last night.  I wanted there to be something in it to represent the missing "L", so I lined my serving bowl with shredded romaine lettuce and spooned the dip onto the lettuce.  I agree with other reviewers I will add another tomato to the dip the next time I make this.  I didn't have any problems with runny dip, I quartered the Roma tomato and removed the wet insides (seeds).  I served it with 3 different dippers; waffle shaped pretzels, Stacy's bagel chips and Flipsides crackers...all were good with this dip.  The fat content of this dip bothered me...so I limited my portion.  But the other guests had no problem gobbling this dip down!  I will make it again for another gathering in the future.

I brought this to a Christmas party and did not like it at all, however several people liked it and asked for the recipe.  I used cherry tomatoes and served with cocktail rye bread. I used a package of pre-cooked and chopped bacon.  Lots of people seem to like this recipe so give it a try I suppose!  It's just not something I myself will be making again.

This went quicker than any appetizer at the party..only some minor changes that made a big diff. I cut some green onion on a bias for a lettuce look. Also, I added about half a Tbsp of apple cider vin to break up some of the heaviness..thanks! #willmakeforever

I made this last weekend for a party and got rave reviews and several requests for the recipe. I mixed all but the tomato together the night before and added in the chopped seeded tomatoes, just before serving. I used 2 medium on the vine tomatoes. Use good quality apple smoked bacon, I think that makes it really over the top great. I Served this with sesame flavored Melba toast rounds and Ritz crackers and pita chips. So easy and so Fantastic. Update: made this again and wanted to put the "L" for lettuce into it somehow, so I served it with the small crisp inner leaves from Romaine heads. Just the thing for those avoiding carbs and gluten. It was so good, again.

Not as good as I hoped.  I doubled it after reading all the rave reviews and had so much left after a party I had to throw it out.  Only made a few small changes, added a little bit of sharp cheddar (shredded) and a half a brick of softened cream cheese (to the doubled batch).  I ended up stuffing cherry tomatoes with some of it, and they were barely touched.  The rest I served with toasted pita chips and baked wheat thins.  I liked it better with the wheat thins.  Don't know why, but not my cup of tea. Sorry, probably just a personal preference.  Nothing wrong with recipe.

This really does taste like a BLT. We love it. I really didn't make any changes, except to use two Roma tomatoes that I have de-seeded instead of one larger tomato and I add a bit of black pepper as well. It is requested at my house every weekend now.

This is such a delicious, refreshing dip.  I make it for all of my get-togethers and everyone loves it!  I use Oscar Meyer real bacon bits and I mix the tomato right in with everything and let it set for a few hours.  Serve with crackers or bagel chips!

I like to make sure the bacon is crispy and this dip is one of our favourites....perfect just as it is. I serve with nachos.  If I am adding the tomatoes early, I drain just a bit of the juice.

I thought it was a bit bland so I added cayenne, seasoning salt, green onion and liquid smoke to it. I used halved cherry tomatoes. I preferred it with pita chips but my husband liked tortilla strips. I made this with both cream cheese and without. I prefer it without.

I have made this for co-workers, a baby shower, and for mother's birthday party. Was an absolute hit each and every time. This last time I used Hormel real bacon pieces, rather then cooking up bacon, still loved by all. Thanks so much for the recipe.

YUMM! I added 4oz. softened cream chz, baked bacon on parchment lined sheets at 375. I did as others suggested and drained the tomatoes for a few minutes on paper towels, then added them to the dip right before serving. Added a few drops liquid smoke and green onions. Everyone loved it!

This is excellent.  I am making this fabulous dip for the second time. I only had grape tomatoes so this version was a bit more labor intensive (slicing, removing seeds and chopping) and the tomatoes are a bit sweeter but delicious combo nonetheless.  Nothing else added or needed.  I used full fat mayo and sour cream the first time but this time did lite on both.  We did use some shredded lettuce on each crackerful which gave it that nice fresh crunch.  Last time we used Wheat Thins but this time I have some bagel chips and crackers and potato chips too.  Super YUM!

I love this dip!  I server with French bread dips.  Slice the bread and toast it in the oven for 5 or 10 minutes.  Tastes even more like a BLT with the bread.

I add everything and refrigerate a few hours to let the flavors blend more, and sometimes I add a small amount of taco seasoning for a little kick, either way this recipe is awesome!

Just a thought to those who found it runny. What about adding sundried tomatoes instead of fresh?  I dehydrate my own tomatoes.

I made this for a party a couple of weeks ago and people stood around that bowl like camels around an oasis!!! I forgot to seed the tomato before I added it which made it a little soupy but it was still amazing. Bravo and thanks so much for sharing this :D

I thought that this was good, but I think that you should wait until right before serving it to add the tomatoes.I also added fresh chopped spinach to it. and  2 sliced scallions on top before serving it serve with a sliced bagette on the side

This is amazing ... and soooo easy.  One thing I've noticed is that you need regular sliced bacon.  I tried using center cut once because that's what we eat for breakfast when we make it to cut down on fat, and it just wasn't "bacony" enough.  The regular cut bacon was much better as the greasy fat adds a lot of bacon flavor to the dip.  I serve this with toasted baguette slices.  Supreme!

Loved this recipe!  I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions.  I used turkey bacon, added a block of cream cheese, one bunch of green onions, and about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  It was good when I first tasted it but MUCH better two days later!  Every person at the party asked for the recipe.

I 1st tried this at a family 4th july cookout and thought it was great! though the person who made it complained the only part that was hard was the bacon and it was messey,,, so I tried another way i usded bacon bits instead of the cooked bacon it gave it the same flavor, i used sour cream, cream cheese, and then diced tomatoes added when i was ready to share the dish. i liked it well see what my parents say bringing it over to watch football tomorrow. though i would like to find something i could add to it like onion to give it a kick i am going to a cookout the weekend so i am thinking of  trying it then and will get more people feedback. def gonna play around with it and see what taste best! great dip!!!

I tried this to compare to another.  This had such great reviews.  I still prefer the version from a well known cooking utensil home show.  I prefer cream cheese, garlic and cheese in it in addition to these ingredients.  I also thought the pound of bacon was more than needed.  Would imagine that it makes a great turkey and avocado wrap spread!

Good.  But definitely needs something extra added to it.  Tried it with ranch dressing mix, and that punched it up a little bit.  Use other reviewers suggestions.

Because of my high expectations due to the high reviews, I was pretty disappointed with this recipe.  I made a few last-minute, semi desperate changes, and it turned out to be the hit of the party.  Two main changes:  **NEEDS SOME CRUNCH! This is really like a Mayo-Bacon-Tomato dip (in that order), but adding some chopped up WATER CHESTNUTS gave it the crunch it needed without the lettuce, without having to deal with the lettuce getting nasty if it sits out for an hour or so at a get-together.  **It needs a tad bit more flavor, but I think that adding more bacon would make it too salty.  I added about 1/2 tbsp Hidden Valley Ranch Dill Dip Mix for this, and it gave it a little extra kick without being overpowering.  Additional tips: I made the "Best Bread Machine" Bread recipe from allrecipes, and just ran the dough cycle.  I then put the dough in an 8- or 9-inch round cake/pie pan, covered it with plastic wrap to let it rise a bit more while the oven preheated, and popped it in the oven.  When it was done, I cut a hole big enough for my BLT dip bowl to fit in and stuck the bowl in it.  The presentation was great that way! Next time, I may keep my water chestnuts addition, but make Rosemary bread or something instead of adding dill dip.  Who knows--but, in sum, this recipe is good, but take note of the this and other reviews and additions before serving it up at a party.

This was a great change of pace from standard dips.  I did add the 1/2 packet of ranch dressing mix.  Will add a tad less next time, but it's a nice addition.  YUMMY!

Loved it!  I had my daughter make this and she arrived late to the party and the food was already being served, so it didn't get the kudos it deserved.  But, it did get raves from those who did try it!  Can't wait to try it again!

Delicious! Super quick and tasty. I used pre-cooked bacon cooked 33 seconds and chopped. That saved the mess and time. You can add any seasoning you enjoy.

I added garlic powder and used less mayo (we only had 3/4 cup in the house) and a little more sour cream. It was yummy!

This was amazing heated! I mixed together all the ingredients (with less mayo), and add about 1.5 cups of cheddar cheese. Then I let it sit for about an hour.  Then I baked it at 400 for roughly 20 min, adding more cheese, bacon, and tomatoes on top for a garnish. Served this spread with homemade bread. So good!!

This was a big hit at the Super Bowl party!  I used thick cut bacon, which I'd recommend...it stands up to the tomatoes well.  A surprise hit with only 4 ingredients!

Everyone loved this.  I only used 1/2 cup mayo and added 1/2 cup more sour cream. I discarded the guts of the tomato and only used the flesh and skin. I also let it dry on a paper towel before adding it to the dip so that it wouldn't get runny. Great recipe. Thanks!

This dip is fantastic if you add 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup chopped green onions and salt and pepper to taste. I always add in a dash of Tony Cacheres and I NEVER have any left over :-)

I absolutely love this dip and have made it several times. I often just do the bacon in the microwave to save time. The BEST was to serve this is in a bread bowl. Everyone devours the dip with chips and then eats the bread bowl.

Thought this was good, but didn't "wow" me either.  I always use low-fat Miracle Whip since I don't like mayo.  And I used grape tomatoes - can't imagine the very liquidly middle parts of a whole tomato in this.  (Paper towel or no.)  It could use a bit more bacon and less tomato.  I thought about 1/4 the recipe was a good "snack" just for me and don't get how this is 16 servings unless everyone just has a taste.  (Hence, people doubling it I guess.)  And while it is good, no it doesn't taste like a BLT.  The lack of lettuce isn't a huge deal, but it's too much mayo for a real BLT.

This is great.  A twist to it is use miracle whip instead of mayo and add a little more bacon for more flavor.  ALos use grape or cherry tomatoes because they ALWAYS have the good tomato flavor.  Dip with cucumber slices for a great taste.

This recipe is dead on a "BLT"!  Just be sure to make the dip the day before so that the flavors blend together.  Serving with toast points makes this truly authentic.

Prepare this the night before serving to allow the flavors to blend. It's GREAT! Just remember one, one, one and one.  All equal parts one cup mayo, one cup sour cream, one pound bacon and one tomato, this way you can make as much as you want! Great with crackers and veggies.  Add green onions as a bonus.

I live in Greece and its hard to find sour cream so i use a certain type of yogurt and it comes out perfect.  I also put just a little green onion finely chopped.  It is great with pizza, greek cheese pies, and meats.  Just a WONDERFUL all around dip.  I do not dare not make it at parties and gatherings because people do get quite upset.

I made this dip for my Bunco club and it was a big hit!  I served it with Club crackers, garlic pita chips and plain bagel chips.  The bagel chips were similar enough to toast rounds that it gave the dip more of a BLT feel.  My changes: The "L" in this recipe is supposed to be Leeks, even though this version did not specify that.  I added chopped green onion instead.  I bought a jar of Hormel real bacon crumbles to save some time and I seeded the tomatoes (I used Roma) so keep the dip from getting mushy. I chilled ovenight.  It was so easy and tasty that I will definitely make this again.

This is sinfully good! Try it, you'll be shocked how eerily this does taste like a BLT. I honestly wasn't expecting it out of a  dip and it surprised me. It was gone within minutes at my superbowl party.

I made this for a pot luck lunch for work today. I took one of the suggestions given in a review to add the cream cheese & the shredded cheese (I used sharp cheddar) & baked it. It was a huge hit, everyone loved it. Thanks for a great recipe.

We LOVE bacon, so this was a perfect recipe for our family. Letting the tomatoes drain well ahead of time on a paper towel was definitely a good idea to keep this dip nice and thick.

This is my favorite dip! I added extra tomato and some green onion replaced the mayo with 8 oz cream cheese, added about a cup of shredded cheddar and also put some cheddar over the top and baked in an 8x8 at 350 for 20-30 minutes. "until cheese was melted" served with fritos.

I fixed this for the first time during the Super Bowl. I prepared several hours before so the flavor would really set in, also I cut the Tomatoes up and stored in a baggie than mixed in just before serving. It was a huge hit, 2 days later it was still great. If you want a simple recipe I suggest this one.

This recipe is good, but it does need some additional flavor and time to let the flavors meld. I added two chopped green onions, garlic powder, and some dry ranch dressing mix. When I tested it immediately after mixing, I couldn't taste much of the bacon. After letting it sit in the fridge for an hour- it tastes much better. We served this with cocktail pumpernickel bread.

I love this dip it is so easy to make and always a hit.  I do add just a little bit of salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I always try to let mine sit in the fridge for at least 6 hours and serve with crackers.  Trust me this dip is a great one and your guest will love it!

Yum yum yum yum yum (etc)! 

This is one of my ultimate fave recipes. Although a friend of mine coined the term "fancy mayonnaise" instead of BLT Dip. :)

Very good, and easy.  I roast the bacon.  I use two small to med. Roma tomatoes, no need to remove skin, but well drained of seeds and liquid.

This is the simplest recipe but don't let the simplicity fool you. We love it and every time I serve it at a party or barbecue, it's one of the first things to disappear. I typically serve it with Triscuits.

OK, How could anything with a pound of bacon be bad???   

I added 2 cups finely shredded cheese, some garlic powder and black pepper.  Absolutely a hit!  Can't wait for the first football tailgate to share the the dip.

It was all the rave at a gathering.  I served it with toast wedges.  I think I'll try pita chips the next time I make it.  It's so simple and so delicious.  It took me back to my childhood, as Mom made BLTs for my sister and me on the weekends sometimes.  They were quite the treat.  Give the recipe a whirl.  You'll certainly be pleased.

I doubled this recipe but it seemed to be missing something so I added more chopped Roma tomatoes and a splash of Worcestershire and Liquid Smoke.  I spread some on Sundried Tomato Basil wraps and it was just a bit too rich.  Tried with toast points and much better.  Next time I believe I might add some cheese and grated onion, and/or maybe a tad bit of horseradish and hot sauce.  Every week I buy produce (tomatoes, onions, peppers), chop them and keep them in containers for cooking throughout the week.  My tip is to scoop out some of the dip (if you're not going to use it all at once) and add the tomatoes to the bowl.  Keeps it from going soggy - or just pour the tomatoes over the top.  Overall a good recipe.

One word...DELICIOUS.   Easy to make, I suggest you use precooked bacon and save your self a step. I tried this on a whim a few weeks ago and have made it 3 times. Everyone loves it, tastes just like a blt!!!

I took this dish to a family Christmas get-together...it was a huge hit! I served the dip in a bread bowl(recipe off this site), which made a nice presentation. I did cut the amount of bacon down, but next time I'll add the whole amount. I waited until serving to add the tomatoes. Fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I whipped this up real fast for a party last week and it was a huge hit. I wasn't so sure about it at first but it will now be a staple at cookouts and parties at my house. It's super simple and fast- minus stinking your house up with all that bacon frying!

It was good ! Everyone loved it !
I served this dip along side a bed of shredded lettuce, and used mini cocktail bread toasted. I think next time I will added in chopped chives or scallions.

I made this dip without reading through all the suggestions.  I worried that I had added the bacon in pieces that were too large, so I threw the whole deal into the food processer and pulsed a few times.  I put it back in the fridge to get cold, and served it topped with some chopped tomato and scallion.  Turned out great!!!  Pulsing it together also made for a lovely pink-tinged color.

This is the best dip ever!  I was little unsure of it at first wondering how on earth this would taste like a BLT sandwhich but it really does!  Amazaing.  A must for everyone to try!  It is so easy to make and I've probably gained tonnes of pounds eating it myself.  I do use no fat or low fat sour cream and mayo though.  I also double the recipe as I usually serve this while hosting a party and try to make sure there is left overs!!  :)

Good, and my guests enjoyed it, but didn't LOVE it as much as I would have expected from the rest of the reviews.   Tasted best with bread - pita or baguette - rather than chips or crackers.  Mixed it up the night before, used drained canned tomatoes, which I added a couple of hours before serving and didn't have any issues.

I should have listened when other people said to leave it in the fridge overnight. This definitely helps bring out the bacon flavour. This was still a good dip though. 
Halfway through the night, I stirred in some salsa, and people polished it off. I would definitely recommend using half the amount of tomatoes and adding salsa as the remaining amount. 
I also adding a few pinches of dry veggie soup mix for some added flavour. 
I will probably make this again and keep playing around with the ingredients.

So good and addictive.  I chopped up some green onions like the others (not too much though) and drained my tomatos (I used fresh).  I also food processed the bacon.  It just got better with time until it was gone!

Huge hit at for a birthday party last year. So much so that we went to the store to buy ingredients for another batch later that night. I repeated for a party this year. I use a little less mayo and supplement with sour cream.

The first time I made this there was too much mayo. Round two I made some adjustments: added 1 c. sour cream; substituted 1 can petite diced tomato (drained in colander well; instead of fresh tomato); added 2 green onions and 1/2 t. garlic powder. I let this chill for 2 hours and served with 1 loaf wheat bread toasted and cut into 4 triangles. This easily served a crowd of 20. It tasted just like the BLT sandwich I had been craving! This recipe went from one of my least favorites to one of my new favorites! YUM!!!

This was good, but I wasn't as blown away due to the high rating as I had expected to be. I used real bacon pieces from the pouch. I thought that this needed some help to taste better. I added pepper, scallions, onion and garlic powders to help the taste. Thanks.

a huge hit - it did taste just like a blt.  Next time I will add in some more tomatoes and put shredded lettuce on top.  PS - people who normally do not like eating dips loved it, exclaiming --- "It does taste like a BLT!"

Really yummy!  I made this for a get together at my dad's for the 4th of July.  Everyone seemed to like it.  It tastes really good with potato chips.  I used crackers and that wasn't that great.  Use rippled potato chips.  Yummm!

This is really REALLY good (GOOD and EASY...now there is a combo that can't be beat!). I have made it dozens of times! I serve it over a bed of shredded lettuce or lettuce leaves to put the "L" back in the BLT...always a hit!

This is good.  My 10 year old loved it without the tomatoes. Works well as a stand-a-lone.  But would also be good doctored. Will make again.

I made this for a party and couldn't even fight my way to the bowl to get any! It got rave reviews and I had many requests for the recipe. I made it with 1/2c mayo, 1 1/2 c sour cream and also added in some green onions as was suggested by other reviewers. I made it 8 hrs before serving and put it in a bread bowl.  It was great!

I really enjoyed this dip, it was so easy to make.  I put the bacon in the blender and popped in 2 spring onions and blended until fine.  Decorated with a little extra tomatoe and some chopped parsley and cracked pepper.  Will definatley be making this dip again.

I made this for a party I had and it was a huge hit.  I followed some other suggestions and halfed the mayo and added 1 tub of cream cheese with onions and chives.  Also added some fresh parsley and black pepper.  I let it set over night and added tomato right before serving.  It was really good.

This recipe was very good, but not much taste.  The only thing I did different was add about 1/2 pack of Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning mix for flavor and taste.  To top it off I used Frito Lay Frito Scoops to eat with it.  Very good for parties.  I also used Hormel real bacon bits (about one cup).

Quick and easy.  Have made with "real" regular bacon, and the real bacon bits.  Either way make sure the bacon is very crispy.  Better if it sits at least overnight.  i added fresh chives and ground pepper, served with Frijitos and bagel chips.

Yum! This was delish. I made this for a bridal shower the night before. I even added the tomato then. It was really good and was gone before I knew it! And now I'm asked to bring this to all the family functions.

A good recipe, but I add thinly sliced green onions, to taste, and freshly ground black pepper.  For those who thought it was bland "as is", try these additions. And yes, making it in advance adds to flavor.  (I always use the Hormel bacon pieces, so no soggy bacon)

this is AMAZING i loved it.  I think it really pertains to ones taste though.  Let it sit so the flavors soak in, it helps. In my case, the more bacon the better.. Wonderful with just Ritz rounds..

I didn't get rave reviews on this, as I was expecting.  I didn't think the dip was all that special actually.  (It was easy to make though!)  I think I'll stick to my other recipes that generated more oohhh's and aaahh's.

This dip is addictive!  You just can't stop eating it!  We always serve sliced French or Italian bread with it.  You should always make a double batch of it and make sure you save some for yourself, because there won't be any left!

LOVE this dip!  I use non-fat mayo and sour cream and it tastes great.  Usually I serve this with toasted baguette slices that have been rubbed with garlic. Thanks for a great recipe : )

This was amazing.   I took it to a party and many people asked me for the recipe.  It was great.  
I took the suggestion of using a roma tomato because it was easier to peel and seed and that worked out wonderfully.  I also used the precooked bacon and just put it in the microwave to crisp and this also worked out well.   

Of course, this recipe is easy to cut down for smaller portions also.

I made this for a party... every one loved it. I used a little less mayo, I didn't like the mayonaisey taste. Other than that it was just wonderful. My friends are begging me to make it again. My picky kids liked it too.

This is a fantastic recipe. I did add green onions, half mayo, half salad dressing, and some garlic. My only problem with it is that it is so salty. But that didn't stop anyone from eating it. Very good with sliced baquette bread and crackers.

I am a big dip person and this is the best dip I've ever tasted!  It was excellent and my husband, who is not a dip-eater, tried it and he loved it too.  I added a couple tbsp of bacon fat from the cooked bacon, green onions, and a bit of pepper.  I served it on a bed of chopped lettuce with some toasted baguettes......true blt taste!!!

This was a surprising offer for my camping buddies.  I put it on a bed of chopped Romaine letters with a circle of canned, stewed tomatoes.  My store was out of melba toast so I used toasted bagel chips.  It was a big hit at the beach party.

Delicious.  When I tried it again, I used 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of sour cream.  Even Better!  I topped it with chopped lettuce and tomatoes and served it with toast triangles.  It was a hit!

This was tasty, but too much of a mayo taste. I may try to substitute cream cheese for part of the mayo.

I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and added green onions, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, diced pimentos from the jar, liquid smoke, half a package of cream cheese, cheddar cheese (2 cups), bacon both inside and on top for garnish, and let it sit overnight. 

Reheated and topped with green onions and roma tomatoes (seeds removed) before serving. Served with plain ruffles.

We had a "dip party" at work and people said this was the best dip! Will definitely make this again!

I loved this. I actually ate it for my dinner lol! I did add some things but didn’t change it too much. I added 4oz of cream cheese because I cut all of the other ingredients in half to make a smaller batch. Also 1/2 of a tomato. I baked the bacon in the oven for 15 mins at 400. Once that was done, mixed it all together (except tomatoes) at the end to bake it in a dish   At 350 for 20 mins. Mixed the tomatoes in at the end. I ate it with toasted and sliced bakery bread. Amazing!

The base of this recipe is very good. However, in my opinion the mayonnaise taste was overpowering. I added some softened cream cheese which helped tame the mayo flavor and also helped with the runny consistency. A definite keeper. Thank  you.

As written this is average.  I tried it stuffed in a cherry tomato as suggested by another, reduced mayo, added a little cream cheese and it was better.

Made this for a neighborhood party and didn't come home with any! Delicious and will make again. I think it got better as the dip aged and the flavors mixed. I added some chopped baby spinach since it needed a little green and strangely the BLT recipe didn't have any lettuce. Anyhoo, I'm not sure the spinach added any flavor, but it added some color. I also think it could use one more tomato. I'll make it again with another tomato and spinach.  So yummy! Thanks!

I took one viewers advice and changed it up although the original recipe was delicious. I added 1 c. Mayo, Miracle Whip, 3/4 lb. bacon, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, roasted elephant garlic. It was the “HIT “of the party! Hubs went back about 5 X to the food table for this dip along with other food.  Thank you

This BLT dip scored at the Super Bowl party this year!
The only change that I made was to use Roma tomatoes.
I believe that they are easier to seed and hold up better.

This was good, but I ended up using 3 tomatoes to get some flavor into it.  Next time I will probably take the advice of other reviewers and use  canned diced tomatoes.

I followed MommyFromSeattle's most excellent advice (baking bacon at 375 for 20 mins or until evenly brown) -- That is how I will always cook bacon in the future -- and added roughly 1.8 of a head of shredded iceberg lettuce to turn that BT into a true BLT.  This dip was wonderful!

I would recommend, however, that we add the bacon just before serving as well, to preserve that great crunch.  In other words, just mix the wet ingredients together, and add the B, L, and T at the end, mixing them in well.

I discovered that my package of bacon was only 12oz instead of a pound (16oz), so I added 3/4c each of mayo and sour cream.  It was NOT too wet, as some other review mentioned; it was just great.

We really loved this! The only thing I did differently was that I patted the tomatoes with a paper towel to get excess water out. I added them to the dip right after everything else was mixed together.  I let it sit in the fridge for 3-4 hours before serving and everyone loved it!

This was great! I did add a few seasonings- epicure 3 onion dip mix and the cheese, chives and bacon dip. Made it for hubby and his friends and they loved it! There was a bit leftover and I had some the next day and next time I will make it the day before because it was so much better overnight.

Hit of the party - TWICE!!!!!  A friend of mine has to eat Gluten-Free so I search our Gluten-free section and found this.  It turned out to be one of her new favorites!!!  My version I added a few diced green onions for a little extra crunch (and some green :)), a touch of salt & pepper and served it with Baby carrots & celery.  It's SO easy and DELICIOUS!

This dip was disappointing, as it had very little taste with the mayo and sour cream.   I would make it again after reading other reviews suggesting  adding shredded cheese and perhaps some seasonings or more bacon.

This dip was simple to make.  However, I felt it was somewhat blah and lacking flavor.  I would add salt, pepper and fresh basil  to give it more flavor.

I have made this dip several times in the past. Easy to whip up on short notice! Here in Wisconsin, ( or maybe just me!) I need miracle whip for it to be a blt! That being said, I did add miracle whip to it, just enough to give it that "zing". I also try to add a little of the bacon grease to it as well- maybe a couple teaspoonfuls. I don't care much for tomatoes, so I don't add a lot, & I usually seed them & just use the drier parts.  Serve with Fritos scoops- you won't be disappointed!

Very little left from the potluck. Used bread and tortilla chips for dipping. Added a tsp. of minced roasted garlic. A dry package of ranch dressing and three quarters of a philly cream cheese pkg. One regular size tub of sour cream and one cup of miracle whip.One whole pkg of bacon. Left it in the fridge overnight...tasted even better  the day after the potluck. The garlic added a nice level of flavour to the dip. Making it twice more this weekend! (edit: oops forgot to say that I forgot to add the tomatoes and it was still delish..so I'm making it without them from now on)

This is a healthier version of the original and exact taste of a blt sandwich  in dip form.   1/4 cup of the grease from the bacon was left out and white bread....... toasted (each piece cut into 4 small triangles especially for a get together.

Made the revised version as suggested by Cindy. 1 cup of mayo, sour cream, and cream cheese each. Melted the cream cheese somewhat before mixing. Also added 1/2 pack of ranch dressing and a few cloves of garlic. Used roma tomatoes after scooping out the insides and drying as much as possible.

This dip grew on me. At first, it was meh, but then I started to crave it. Overall, it really is a good dip, just not necessarily my first choice. I usually like warm, cheesy dips. 

Tip that was given to me by co-workers was to use thin-sliced bacon cooked hard. My bacon was center cut and fried normal and once put in the dip it had a chewy consistency.

I've been making this for many years. The only difference that I have is that I add hot chunky salsa to it as well. I also wrap it in a tortilla and refrigerate it overnight. Then I slice it. Easier to eat that way and people just love it.

Adding the cream cheese and 2 cups of cheddar, then baking for 20 minutes and sprinkling with green onions, made it perfect!

Delicious! I would have given 5 stars, but as written I found it tasted like it was missing something (though was still quite tasty with no alterations). Added finely diced green onions and more diced tomatoes and it was perfect. Second time making, I added about 1/4 of grated extra old cheddar, and that made it taste perfect for my taste buds.

I used real bacon bits (Hormel) the large back (I'm sorry, I forget how many ounces it was) and warmed them up for a minute in the microwave like another user suggested (and I think this is a must, having made this before without warming them up in the microwave.. It really brings out the flavor (if you are going to cut corners and just use the bacon bits like I did).   I also added about an additional half cup of mayo.   We aren't huge sour cream fans .  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I paired it with pita chips and tortilla chips, though I think you could eat this with anything and it would be a hit.

Made this for tailgating, and it went quickly. Used tortilla chips to dip. We even used it as a topping on the burgers. Will definitely make this again.

Everyone loved this at my labor day cookout!  I followed the recipe  and served mine with the Hawaiian bread. Scooped out the inside middle and broke into large chunk size pieces. Place bread bowl on round platter, fill with dip, place chunks of bread around.  I also bought a 12 pkg. Hawaiian bread  dinner rolls. Tore up some of these as needed.

We use toast and cut it into fourths then put the dip on it.  Like a BLT sandwich almost.

I have had this stuffed into cherry tomatoes and it is great. I agree with adding the finely chopped lettuce. A real BLT. Plus that would take up more of the bacon.

I make something similar to this, except I cut the sour cream in half as its too strong. The other thing I do is mix the mayo or MW with the bacon at least 24 hrs before so the flavor from the bacon will be picked up by the mayo and sour cream. I have also served this as a base to a pasta salad, both cold and hot adding the tomatoes right before serving.

This was very good - different from the usual dips. I did change it tad based on reviews- I added 1/2 bunch of green onions to add some color also added about 1.5c shredded cheddar and 1/2 block of cream cheese to stiffen it up. sorry to change and review but I am sure its yummy either way.

Good recipe, but odd its called "BLT" when there's no"L"in it. Add a bag of shredded lettuce to make this a true "BLT" dip

Don't know if you've heard of tastefully simple products.  But they have a dip mix in a jar called "Bacon Bacon"  i mixed a bit of this in the mayo/sour cream and left it go for a few hours.  Put it in a 9x9 glass cake pan then put the crumbled bacon, shredded lettuce n chopped tomato on top.  Sprinkled some shredded cheese on top.  Tasted JUST LIKE a BLT.  I think the dip mix added in made a huge difference.  Everybody raved about it.

Used Miracle Whip instead of mayo. I think the mayo would probably be better. I added chives, as one reviewer suggested and used turkey bacon. Everyone liked it, but I would like to try the reviewer's suggestion of adding cream cheese and cheddar.

Easy to make and tastes quite a bit like a BLT! I added shredded lettuce on top to incorporate the 'L' of the BLT. Great served with Ritz crackers.

My husband LOVES this dip. Although, what man doesn't love bacon. I followed the recipe exactly. I'm going to try half mayo, half miracle whip next time for a little more zip. I served it with club crackers. It was a huge hit at the get together I took it to!

Very Good - I used imitation bacon bits and a can of rotel (drained) for a quick fix.  I also added a fiesta ranch packet for a little more flavor.

This was a really good idea! I made mine "California style" with diced avocado on top. Also mixed a little green onion into the mayo/sour cream mixture. Reserved some bacon to top it off, and piled it atop chopped Romain lettuce.  Everyone loved it!

As is this recipe is ok.  The flavor is on the bland side.  Dpeending on the bacon you use, it might give it more flavor.  However, I noticed after I made it that the people who really liked it added something else to enhance the flavor.  So, either add to this recipe or someone should write a recipe with the additional ingredients included.

Made this for a party.  Many thought this was excellent.  I thought it was ok.  I cooked the bacon in the oven and added shredded cheese after it seemed too boring tasting.  I did however eat it on a piece of bread today and it was very yummy, kinda like a chicken salad!

This was a hit at the Super Bowl party!   I followed one members advice and added 8 oz. cream cheese and 2 cups shredded cheese.  Baked for 20 minutes.  Then I stirred in tomatoes, chives, salt and pepper.  Excellent!

Amazing!  I added a green onion for color and a little bit of extra flavor, but the recipe was a five-star as is.  =)  I used fat-free sour cream and fat-free mayo.  My boyfriend couldn't tell that they were fat-free and he loved it!

This was good right after I made it.  However, I let it chill overnight as some suggested and regretted it.  The bacon absorbed moisture and lost its crispy texture to the point of being mushy (and I cooked the bacon myself - did not use precooked or bacaon bits).  I'm not sure I will make it again, but if I do I would add the bacon just before serving.

I also added one package of cream cheese. I also used the real bacon bits from the bag and it tasted very salty, I recomend frying the bacon and crumbling it your self, it's a major taste difference and worth it!!

Instead of making bacon, I used packaged turkey bacon bits. In addition, I added dry ranch powder. Definitely store in the fridge for at least an hour to really bring out the ranch and bacon flavors. I added quartered, seeded, and drained grape tomatoes right before serving so they stay fresh.

I made this on a whim for a Superbowl party yesterday..used canola mayo, light sour cream, bacon and diced canned tomatoes with chiles. It was OK..the mayo was a bit overpowering and needless to say, no one really ate it. I appreciate the convenience of the recipe, but probably won't make it again.

MADE FOR THE SUPER BOWL...MY HUSBAND LOVED IT!! I USED ROMA TOMATOES SO DIDN'T HAVE PROBLEM WITH TOMATOES- I THOUGHT IT WAS WAY TOO MAYO TASTING- I WOULD LIKE TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT AND I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER MADE  VERY EARLY OR NIGHT BEFORE SO THE FLAVORS COULD MARRY BETTER- I THINK THAT IS THE REASON FOR THE EXTREME MAYO TASTE- NEXT TIME I WANT TO PUT IT IN THE HAWAIIAN LOAF (MMMMM.. LOVE THAT STUFF) AS ANOTHER SUGGESTED AND MAYBE CUT A LITTLE MAYO AND ADD CREAM CHEESE AS ANOTHER SUGGESTED-- ALL AND ALL A GOOD RECIPE-

I took some suggestions from other reviews and used 4 oz. cream cheese, 1 cup sour cream, and 1 cup mayo. Then added half packet of ranch dip mix. Chopped bacon before cooking, then put on foil-lined cookie sheet and cooked it in oven, worked out well this way. Chopped even finer after it cooled. Added bacon and onion powder to the mix. Good with or without adding the tomatoes. Stored in refrigerator overnight. Served with Toppers multi-grain crackers. Everyone liked it.

I make this ALL the time. Any time we have a function at work, my job is to bring this. I cook the bacon on a foil lined sheet pan in the oven at 350 for 25 - 30 minutes. It make it so easy.

This wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. I added 1/2 a packet of ranch seasoning and served it in a bread bowl. I normally make spinach dip in a bread bowl and will go back to that recipe. Not many people came back for seconds.

The only thing is that it does taste just like the ingredients. No spice. I think we'll try adding something to the sour cream and mayonaise next time.

I thought this was pretty good... made it for Thanksgiving yesterday, and I did use well-drained canned tomatoes. I thought it was pretty good (except where is the "L"?), and it was easy when making the bacon in the oven, and it did taste better today (the next day). 

My dad tried it today when I was eating some and he hated it so maybe it's not for everyone. My mom who loves BLT sandwiches wouldn't even try it because she thought it smelled funny.

Excellent dip! It disappears every time I make it.  If you are very short on time use canned diced tomotates (drain them) and a jar of real bacon bits.  Awesome!

It was tasty but I probably wouldn't make again as is. I might try that one suggestion of adding cheese and baking it! It was good but I guess based on reviews I expected to be blown away.

This was very good - better after sitting overnight.  I found the original recipe to be a little bland, like other reviewers did (although my husband licked the bowl!) so later, I added some dry ranch mix & it improved the flavor tremendously.  In original recipe, there's not much flavor besides the bacon. Although, I brought it to a party and it wasn't a big hit at all.  Sorry.

I made this for Christmas Eve. I thought that 1 lb of bacon was a little too much. I also used more sour cream and less mayo as another reviewer suggested. I added chopped green onion and chopped lettuce, which I think really helped. I had a lot left over, so it wasn't as big of a hit as I had hoped.

This was good but it needed as others suggested garlic or green onions. I did add some chipotle salsa to it so it wasn't so white. Otherwise, a good solid recipe that guests enjoyed.

I'd rather eat a BLT than taste it as a dip.  Kind of strange, but very well worth making to form your own opinion.

I used a jar of REAL BACON BITS, in place of the 1 lb bacon...and I used a well-drained can of diced tomatoes....   It was pretty good.  I brought it to work for our Halloween Party and about 2/3 of it was gone....  So, I am guessing it wasn't a total hit!!   I would make it again though.

This dip was really good! I used leftover bacon I had made from a quiche, put it in a blender with 3/4 of the mayo and 1c. sour cream. Added a little bit of water and mixed together. Then chopped 1/2 a tomato and added it. We ate w/ broccoli, pieces of bread, & cherry tomatoes. Loved it b/c it was so simple!

This was nice but I reduced the mayo to 1/2 a cup as I find the taste of it too overpowering. I let it sit in the fridge for 2 hours but think it could have done with a bit longer.

This is great! I made it with the "bacon pieces" in the jar once - and it was so easy and less salty. (not Bacos - I used the softer kind) It was delicious both ways. 

Once, I put the tomatoes in a ring around the dip instead of mixing it in because I have some tomato haters in the family! I think it was just as good that way too.

I love BLT's, but I did not like this. I took it to a potluck and brought almost all of it back home. I followed other suggestions, but I still did not like it. To salty, also.

Took this to a dinner party last night and everyone enjoyed it, particularly the men.  Followed suggestions of others:   added green onion; used 1/2 c mayo and 1-1/2 c sour cream (fat free); prepared early and let flavors 'blend' in refrigerator 8 hours; hollowed out roma tomatos, chopped finely and added shortly before serving.  It was definitely a hit!

I gave this four stars because I did not care for this, but I had a party and I got so many compliments on this dip. I reduced the mayo by 1/4 cup and added in its place some ranch dressing and added some pepper. There were many oooh's and aah's but I just can't get into this. It sounded great so it is just me. I would make it again for a prty but I will be eating something else.

Very good! Nice change from the tired onion soup based dips. Good with Melba toast. Also, do not overlook as a veggie dip. I added some thinly sliced scallions and a healthy dose of black pepper to jazz it up a bit. Used Oscar Meyer precooked bacon as a time saver. Definitely a "repeater".
