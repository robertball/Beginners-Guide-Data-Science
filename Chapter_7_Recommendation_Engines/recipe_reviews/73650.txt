I used stevia instead of sugar and it was wonderful.
This was a great treat since we do not use sugar and rhubarb is hard to serve
without sugar

What a easy and tasty dessert. Who would have thought that putting chopped rhubarb wrapped up in a canned bisquit dough with a buttery sugar syrup could turn out SOOO good. I followed the recipe as it was printed and it was great. I made a second batch to give to neighbors and basted the bisquits a couple of times during the bake time. both batches were exceptionally good. This will replace my pie recipes.And the bonus is no oven to clean from pie juice run over.

Incredibly easy and good.  I just made them for breakfast.  I didn't have any regular biscuits, so I used the large flaky variety.  Excellent!  Very filling but I'm tempted to get another cup of tea and another dumpling.  This could be bad for the waistline. :)

I never met a recipe so simple to follow, quick to make, aromatically blissful, and full of tasty goodness! Not the healthiest, but blah blah blah! I cut down on the sugar (used about 3/4 cup) and it was a great blend of sweet and tart. I do agree with another post that basting them about halfway through makes a huge difference--they came out with a caramelized sugary crusty wonderful top. We had to really work hard at not eating more than one for dessert. But, of course, we ate one for breakfast instead! Going to try with a number of other fruity delicious fillings. But, the rhubarb is really amazing. (ps...don't be afraid to really fill these up--we went light on the rhubarb thinking they were really full already, but we totally could have used the full 2 cups). Awesome!

Surprisingly great recipe that was a big hit at our house. The 2nd time I made it, I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and added the topping to the rhubarb in the filling and we liked the results better. Super easy and yummy.

Oh sooooo tasty! We made little individual dumplings, drizzled a little bit of sauce under and on top of 2 with a scoop of ice cream in the middle. An easy recipe that makes you look like Martha Stewart!

I have shared this with both my aunts and we all agree that it is a good recipe.  We also think that we should beat an egg white and brush the biscuit, then sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top.  This would make the outer crust crisp and sweet.

This recipe was delicious!  I made a biscuit dough from scratch like the baking powder biscuit recipes found on this website.  The extra effort was definitely worth it.  Next time I'm going to add strawberries to the filling for something a little different.

Normally I dont buy prepackaged dessert stuff - including the biscuit dough needed for this recipe. However, when pressed for time this is the hands down best easy dessert recipe ever! I love it and make it way too often!

I doubled the recipe, used half brown sugar & half white sugar and an additional can of biscuits and after an overnight rest these are FANTABULOUS!! Right after they came out of the oven I was disappointed. They were very watery and mushy on the bottom but after resting overnight they are almost perfect. It wouldn't hurt to use less water. Next time I plan to reduce the amount of water by a third. Thanks JAGRANT for this recipe!

Delicious! Looked appetizing and tasted great! I don't have a real sweet tooth, and found th recipe to be perfect.  The only change I made was to make my own biscuits, rather than using pre-packaged. (I made buttermilk biscuits.) I'm wondering if the pre-packaged biscuits have sugar in them.  If so, I would cut down on the amount of sugar called for in this recipe. I chopped the rhubard in very small pieces and used almost all of them.  I sprinkled the remaining ones on top before baking. I'll deffintely be making these again with whatever fruit is in season. Thank you!

The water amount depends on how much water is in the rhubarb and if it has been frozen it will have more water in it.

My kids and husband loved it but I thought it was a bit sweet.  I did make them on the grill in a cast iron skillet.  I did it after our chicken was done so it had to stay on longer (and I didn't have a cover for it).  I would make again but maybe cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup.

We made this recipe as a group cooking project at the nursing home.  It was fabulous!  The residents all helped chop rhubarb, flatten biscuits, and made their own individual "pies".   We skipped the white sugar and used 1/2 cup brown sugar, also substituted 3/4 cup of lemon/lime soda for the water.  Everyone in the building loved the recipe and will be spreading it around town.

This was a huge hit at our 4th of July party - people who had never tasted rhubarb enjoyed it too. Next time I would put a little more rhubarb in each dumpling.

We have a large rhubarb patch and are always looking for new ways to use the produce. This was excellent and everyone in my family enjoyed it very much. Very rich so one is just enough.

I didn't have any frozen biscuit dough so I used the dough from the Cheese Biscuits recipe found on this site here without the cheese and it worked great. Also used a muffin pan to put the individual dumplings. Applied more syrup about half way through bake time.  They turned out great and very sweet, but not to sweet. Made a great dessert, we had Birch  ice cream with ours. Rhubarb is not a common food in my home so this was a great treat.

my kids loved these... and they say they don't like rhubarb.  Made 1/2 recipe for a test and it was gone in 5 min. and I didn't even get a taste.  Then I made a big batch. I got the first one out of the oven. Gone in 10 min.  Eat alone or with vanilla ice cream... good any way ya make 'em. (I did use brown sugar because the kids used all the white sugar in Kool-aid)

These were interesting, but not special.  I could not fit all the rhubarb into the dumplings.  They baked up well enough, and created a syrupy sauce.  I think that the rhubarb flavor was lost in all the sweetness and dough.

I am all about sweet, but there was way too much sugar, butter and water in the mixture.  The dumplings were floating in it!  They taste great though!

Adults and children loved this.  I made it for a bunch of people at my house and then took more to a Mother's Day party.  It looks much more difficult than it is - in fact the children had fun making the dumplings and they turn out great even if they are not perfect or break open a bit.  The only change I made was 1/2 brown sugar because I was almost out of white sugar.  If you baste a little during cooking then the tops of the dumplings get a sugary brown crust - yum.  Everyone agreed that it was not too sweet.

I used 3- 6oz containers of buscuits and increased the rest of the ingredients accordingly.  They were so quick and easy and soooo very tasty.  There were all gone in a couple hours.  I couldn't stay out them.  Making them again real soon.  They were a nice size...kinda on the small size.  Nice for a women's gathering where you would like a small dessert.  I might decrease the sugar a little next time - just to have a little tartness

These were gooey and delicious.  I would flatten the dough a little more so that I have more room to put in rhubarb.  My husband loved these...!

Delicious!  Made 2 times in 2 days!  The type of biscuit made a difference for me.  The first time I used smaller biscuits- buttermilk, and they turned out better then the grand biscuits with butter.  I also cut up a strawberry in each one.  Do NOT need all that sugar- will be too sweet...

Wow... This turned out fantastic!  So yummy and so easy!  I used Granny Smith apples because the rhubarb in the store looked pretty bad.  That is the only change I made. Great recipe. I bet peaches or pears would be very nice too.

These were delicious and a great way to use rhubarb. I will definitely be making these again! I used half white sugar half brown sugar to cut down the sweetness.

Great and easy recipe.  Had all the ingredients in my pantry and fridge.  I used buttery biscuts and it worked too.

I liked this a lot!! I used two cans (8 biscuits each) and flattened them to about 5 inch in diameter.  I also used only about 1.5 cup rhubarb.  Everything else I kept the same.  Next time I may try homemade biscuits from whole wheat to make it a bit healthier.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe, but added strawberries with the rhubarb.  I also made a batch with rhubarb, strawberries, and blueberries.  All batches were exceptional and so easy.  Will be a regular on my menu!

What an excellent recipe!  I have lots of rhubarb this year so was happy to find this easy recipe.  I also added chopped apples in with the rhubarb.   I've made 2 batches in 2 days and hubby finished them all!  I would suggest cutting sugar to 3/4 cup (I used only brown sugar)  and also 3/4 cup water to make it more syrupy and less soupy.

Terribly bland.  The biscuit part was tasty enough, but once inside the dumpling, the rhubarb was dry and boring.  It was not easy to roll up the biscuit and could only put a few pieces of rhubarb inside.  Not worth making...

This turned out better than I was expecting! I used jumbo flaky crescent rolls (8 per package), 1/2 the original amount of sugar, and subbed diced apples for 1/2 the rhubarb. Delicious!

These were AWESOME.  I didn't have Rhubarb so I used Apple Pie filling and I added cinnamon to the filling and also the syrup topping.  Will make again...and again...and again...

What a way to use the first rhubarb from the garden this year! We really enjoyed this dish.  I used my own homemade biscuits and when the pan was ready to go in the oven, I tucked the leftover chopped rhubarb in around the dumplings - worked out really well.  Overall a very good way to use rhubarb, though next time I will double the sauce.  Thank you to the poster.  Mm mm good!

This is such an easy and delicious use of fresh rhubarb! I followed the recipe as written (except cutting the sugar down slightly). It was so yummy and would be perfect as a dessert or breakfast. I will definitely be making this again to use up the rhubarb I get in our weekly CSA boxes!

Made this tonight.  Took it to my son and daughter in law - my husband (who does not like rhubarb) like it and son/daughter liked it as well.  I cannot eat sweets, but tasted a forkful and it was yummy.  Who would have thought?  Just seemed too easy.  I did use less sugar and less water - but worked out great.

I had to make this not once, but twice in one week because my friends thought these were magical. I added leftover strawberries to some of the dumpling fillings, and that was a pretty good combination.
I did cut the amount of sugar/water/butter/vanilla (to about 2/3 of the total amounts in the recipe), and didn't need to adjust anything else - just made sure to grab the dumplings out of the oven once they turned golden brown! Held up well for the next day too.

Made this awhile back and it was so very good. The kicker was that it was so very easy. I love it when easy and good are in the same recipe. Perfect Perfect Perfect! I will have to try it with other fruits, maybe tonight.

One word...FABULOUS!!!!  My fiance claims he doesn't like rhubarb, but I made him try it and he literally took my fork and plate away from me.  Needless to say it was a hit and I will share it with everyone that will listen.
