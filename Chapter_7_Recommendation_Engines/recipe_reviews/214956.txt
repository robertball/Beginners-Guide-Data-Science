I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. The meat was awesome! Very close to the pockets sold in the city. Reminds me my college days- BKLYN.   However, I had some difficulty with the crust. I stirred in the water and egg but the dough remained crumbly. I added a lot more water but ran out of time so I quickly threw in another egg, which held it together. Because of this, the crust was not light and flakey. It was rather heavy and dense. I am not an expert so I am not sure what the appropriate remedy would have been for the crust.   I will def try this again with modifications to the crust.

Loved the filling!!  Had a problem with the "pocket"; even tho I am a pie maker, it just didn't work well for me.  I will try the recipe again with my own crust recipe.  Thanks for the trip down memory lane, devaudio.

Great recipe... the trick to a good dough is to use ice cold water so it will hold together... The meat mixture was really tasty and very NYC.

The filling for this was great.  I just added some Creole seasoning and only 3 tablespoons of breadcrumbs (did not really have any drippings to drain off).  I did not use this crust recipe, because of the reviews.  My family loved these.  The cooking time was only 30 mins, but I think that depends on the oven and the size of the pies.  I also made some veggie ones with the same seasoning, but with potatoes, peas and onions.

These were delicious! I did make some alterations, however. I added some seasoned potatoes while the beef was simmering, instead of bread crumbs. I also added some sharp cheddar cheese and my husband LOVED them!!! Totally making these again!!

This is definitely a keeper recipe! 
My family loved it and it was fairly easy to make. 
The only adjustments or changes I made is I used butter instead of vegetable shortening (as always) and I used freshly ground soft wheat flour.
