The pizza was scrumptious!!!  I used olive oil for the dough (My KitchenAid mixer did most of the mixing) and I baked the pizza on a Pampered chef Stoneware.  I added about 3 tablespoon of pizza sauce (store bought - can :)), finely chopped hotdogs, black olives, onions, stuffed string cheese for the edge, 1 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  My family loved it!!!  You can make most of the ingredients organic, if you prefer to do it that way :)

Absolutely love it! Made two out of it! Added bell peppers to one and left the other as mozzarella and pepperoni . Mixed the dough with olive oil. Turned out perfect! Great recipe!

My husband and I loved this pizza.  I reduced the oregano to 1/4 tsp, used turkey pepperoni and added about 1/4 cup of shredded mild cheddar cheese. Very easy to make.  Baked it on a pizza stone, and the crust was nice and crispy.  Delicious!

I would cut the salt entirely from the sauce as the pepperoni adds enough. Other than that, the sauce is delicious. I also added mushrooms and green onions as toppings. The crust held up beautifully and tasted great. Will definely be using this recipe in future and will vary the toppings.

This recipe is my keeper.  The pizza bread is so soft from inside and crunchy at outside.  I guarantee you won't be regret if you using this recipe for your pizza dough. Thank you Cantadina for sharing this recipe.

Great as is, never again Papa John's.
Next one no onion and bell pepper - kids wouldn't you know.  And don't forget the 1/2 cup water in the sauce (I'm getting old).
Oops, I added pepper, mushrooms and onion - not the recipe.

We rate this recipe a 4 star because there was too much pizza sauce. We think it could have more cheese. As a topping, we added pineapple.

I’m not a great cook but wanted to start a family tradition with my kids. Every year for Valentine’s Day we would have “heart shaped” pizza. This year I wanted to start making our own. We did a test run tonight and the pizza was amazing!! And easy to make!!

It was delicious! The crust was outstanding and so quick and easy.  The flavor of the sauce just right!  I did sprinkle flat leaf parsley on afterward  that looked pretty.  Used one Italian sausage, crumbled and browned plus small ham pieces, grilled some vegetables: bell pepper strips, red onion strips, some cherry tomatoes getting wrinkled, and sliced zucchini.  The vegetables were added to the pizza before it went into the oven. Shredded provolone cheese added on top.  It was so good, I like pizza again!

I really like this recipe and it makes a great pizza, but the sauce is VERY sweet. Cut out the extra sugar from the sauce (Tomato paste is sweet on it's own anyway) and it goes from good to top notch.

Fair taste however only needs 15 mins in oven so don't cook too long. Generally, pizza was ok I added some peppers and chilli which mixed well with the pepperoni. Recommended: Yes
