This meat loaf was absolutely fantastic!!  I made it last night and had the leftovers for lunch today.  The only thing I might change is making more of the sauce for the drizzle once the meat loaf is cut.  That sauce is so good that my husband and I decided that we'll try it as a marinade soon.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Very moist meatloaf! Instead of the usual loaf pan (and to stretch it out) i spread it into a 13x9 casserole dish - and cooked it for 40 minutes. I also used 1# lean ground beef & 19 oz lean ground turkey - couldn't tell the difference! Love the added ranch!

The flavor was very good but the texture was blah. It was too soft. I followed the recipe to a T.  Sorry, I try to rate recipes fairly and this did not do it for us.

I rarely vary from my tried and true sage, bell peppers and onions based family recipe but wanted something different today. I feel bad about rating this because I made so many changes. It’s one of those days I used what I had, and based it loosely on some recipe from some unfortunate submitter on AR. (Sorry, Chihuahua Girl) You know..the kind of dishes that never can be duplicated again, no matter how good it turns out? And mine turned out GREAT! I was into Southwestern but leary of it tasting like taco meat, as one review of a SW style recipe, mentioned. Wanted it more like my regular sage meatloaf (the sage addition is why I zeroed in on this recipe among the many) with a SW flare. Used real onions and garlic instead of powders. Used bell pepper (hark back to family recipe) and some pickled jalapenos for a SW kick…but still not a taco/salsa based flavor. For filler I used torn, stale hard rolls I had (family recipe stuff….I like torn stale bread for the texture instead of bread crumbs) and used a Salsa Ranch salad dressing I had, (oops…I did sneak salsa in there) instead of  the dry mix. Omitted the milk because the dressing was already liquid. I made the sauce as written with V8 and doubled it. There’s some ketchup in my family recipe but I never put ketchup on top of it, didn’t bake any of the sauce on top of this either. This sauce was a nice compliment to the ranch flavor. Surprising how the sweet sauce toned down my SW spiceiness without being sour cream-like.

Everyone loved this when I made it!!  The only thing I did differently was to add about 1 tbsp of red wine vinegar to the sauce to add some tang to it; it was AWESOME!

I made this meatloaf, following the recipe  to the letter. I loved the flavor and the directions were great. Next time I will cut the breadcrumbs by half, and instead of using onion powder, will substitute a finely chopped onion. I am adding this to my recipe box.

I used a homemade dry ranch seasoning mix (Kelly/SD's from this site--half a batch) and I did not add the extra garlic powder and onion powder. I only added a pinch of salt and I used my own homemade whole wheat bread crumbs. I served the sauce on the side so that the boys could choose wether or not they wanted any. They actually ate it on it's own without the sauce, though they did try a little. This turned out really well and the boys liked it well enough. It also stayed together and didn't fall apart in a huge clump which is something I've always struggled with. I'd make this again. NOTE: I highly recommend you combine the ingredients and form the meatloaf and let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours before baking. I think that helps a great deal in making it more solid.

This was a great recipe.  I didn't have vegetable juice so used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 t. chipolte pepper and skipped the stove top step number 2.  WOW, the whole family loved it!

I misread the directions.  I completely skipped #2 and I mixed everything together.  It was a pretty tasty meatloaf.  I liked it more than the wife.  Maybe I'll have to try it again following the directions.  It was nice to not be disappointed by another meatloaf recipe from this site.

Very good, simple meatloaf. Moist and juicy even using 95% sirloin, so I can tell myself it's healthy. The ranch pack does add a delicious complexity and twist to the flavor, but the whole thing doesn't scream "Ranch!" so if you're looking for that just be aware. I might try adding 1/2 of another pack in the future, but something tells me to just leave it and enjoy. And yes, the sauce is as amazing as everyone else is saying - I doubled it and it didn't even last through half the slices, my boyfriend became that in love with it. I was going to give this 5 stars simply because no disgusting reprehensible icky ketchup is called for but this recipe earned them itself - thanks for sharing :)

I liked it a lot. I didn't have onion powder so I used chopped onion, which added even more liquid, so took longer to cook. and i didn't have V8 so i used water and katchup. I liked the sauce more a a glaze and not so thick so i didnt let it thicken alot.  I think I would of enjoyed it better if I had let it set more but we were starving and it had already been 1 1/2 hours. But I emailed it to family.

My husband and I loved it. I made it just as it said but doubled the sauce. The only bad thing is that I brought some too a friend and she said it was too spicy. I thought the spice was great.

This was fabulous! I agree with Micpsy12 - double the sauce to serve along with the meatloaf - yum.  Hubby & 10-year old son agree this is definitely a keeper!

Very good!  My husband said it was a homerun.  I followed the meat mixture exactly and had no problem with it falling apart.  I was also worried about the texture without any celery or onion but again no problerm.  I did change the sauce slightly because I didn't have any worcestershire sauce.  I used some barbacue sauce that had a smoky sweet flavor along with some hot sauce because I didn't have any spicy vegatable juice and we definitely like our food with a kick. I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for a great recipe.

The flavor was great.  The whole family loved it.  My only complaint is that it is a bit too moist.  I made it in a meatloaf pan, so that extra fat could drip from it, but it still fell apart.

Wow, wow and wow!  This is so yummy.  Nice and firm, doesn't fall apart and is packed with flavor.  A little salty, so next time I might cut out the salt since the ranch packet is so salty.  I also had to improvise on the sauce because I was out of Worcestershire Sauce.  I used Soy Sauce, which wasn't bad, but I look forward to the next time I make it so I can make the sauce right!

This was really good! My husband loves meatloaf and I was nervous about changing one of his favs but he liked this. I followed the recipe exactly but had to substitute fresh onion and garlic as my husband is very allergic to both. I put about 1/4 cup minced onion and 1T minced garlic. I did double the sauce as some suggested and not sure it was necessary but for something so simple I didn't mind having some left for leftovers. I unexpectedly had a couple people stop by for a cocktail and asked them to stay. They loved it as well.

I was recently promoted to full-time cook by our new executive chef at the senior living facility I work at, and I am so happy for that since I won't be a part-time dishwasher anymore! My coworkers were trying to find some simple meatloaf recipes for a nice Sunday meal, and this recipe popped up while scrolling through my tablet. It sounded delicious, so I had to make about 4 loaves - enough to serve over 75! - for our elderly residents. We were all excited with the results! The ranch really adds a lot of flavor, and the sauce is excellent. The residents said it's definitely a keeper. Our leftovers were served as open-faced meatloaf sandwiches, and it was amazing. Definitely give this a try; it's a wonderful recipe.

I didn't like the texture...it was too dense.  Next time I'll use bread crumbs and double the sauce.  I added 1/2 lb. of hot italian sausage for extra bite.

this was ok, but i prefer meatloaf with more texture. i might make it again if i didn't have any celery, onions, etc. on hand.

My husband is a meatloaf fan and he liked it. We will add some onions and/or celery next time, but the ranch twist is great!

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had. I followed the recipe as close as I could. I didn't have any sage so didn't use that and I used one real onion chopped. I followed other reviewers suggestion of doubling the sauce. It is so good. I also put them in a cupcake pan so that they would cook faster and cooked them at 450.

My finicky boyfriend and I loved this.  I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I replaced it with half soy and half browning sauces.  It was moist without being greasy as so many meatloaves I have made.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.

This was pretty good.  I didn't find the texture soft at all, but that may be because I used Italian seasoned panko bread crumbs instead of fine bread crumbs.  I felt like the sage was a bit too overpowering and didn't work well with the ranch dressing, so if I make it again I will leave the sage out.  The sauce was quite good.

It was okay. The meatloaf turned out fine (I used two eggs and two regular slices of bread broken into small pieces). I tried two different sauces. One with dark brown sugar and one with light brown sugar. They both turned  out runny. I drizzled the sauce w light brown sugar. I have plenty of meatloaf left and I think I'll break out the ketchup when I am ready for some more.

It was good the first day..second day, not so much.  I look forward to a good leftover meatball sandwich and this is not the recipe to use.

This meatloaf was amazing! My kids and hubby loved it and fought over the leftovers. I would def recommend doubling up on the sauce, especially if you have kids who like to "dip"

My family loved this meatloaf, pretty sure it was the ranch. Will be adding to my recipe box.
