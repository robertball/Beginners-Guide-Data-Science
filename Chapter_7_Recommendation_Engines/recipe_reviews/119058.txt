5 stars with the following changes.  Used fresh berries and rhubarb and no tapioca. 2/3 cup sugar, pinch of salt, and 1/2 tsp. vanilla apon cooling. Sauce thickens as it cools. Simple.

This was super quick and really tasty.  I served this on angel food cake with whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  Also good on pancakes, french toast, waffles or ice cream.  Came out really thick.  I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cups and might reduce to 1/2 cup next time.  I've made this with and without the tapioca and like it better without the tapioca.

This stuff is amazing!  I love it on a whole wheat bagel with cream cheese.  I have made it several times, and love it more and more each time!  I usually use slightly more than half of the amount of tapioca that is called for, and instead of the full cup of white sugar, I break it down into 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  Most recently I used 2 mangoes in place of the strawberries.

Yummy! I was looking for a sauce like this that my Mom made a long time ago to put over my rice pudding. Can't stop eating it. Did not use tapioca and reduced the sugar amount too.

A wonderful, quick easy, delicious sauce! I had a last minute dinner for family. I made this sauce to serve over vanilla ice cream. It was really yummy but just eating it plain was very good too!

I halved the recipe and made it with fresh rhubarb and fresh strawberries (not frozen).

I was suprised how easy this recipe was.  I thought you would need more water but once it cooks down in the microwave it was fine.  The tapioca actually makes it thicker like a pudding when you serve it chilled.  It is a thicker sauce but one of a kind.  Everyone loves it~

I made this with fresh strawberries, and served it over homemade vanilla/chocolate chip ice cream. Everyone loved it!

Yummy!  I left the tapioca out. (I just don't care for tapioca in anything)  Used a little more than 4 cups rhubarb, and substituted splenda for the sugar (cut the calories down by like 800 or 900 calories!) Used fresh strawberries (the big container from Sam's or Costco) I think it's two pounds. (Halved and then used the egg slicer to cut them smaller) Followeed others and added a bit of vanilla at the end.  Not as good warm as it is the next day cold.  Seemed like too much water, but the next day was just right.

I cut sugar and water to 1/4 of a cup each and it was perfect, I used frozen fruit and omitted the food colouring. Nice over Fluffy Pancakes and sausages.

One word of caution, while microwaving for the 4 minute interval, I was multi-tasking.  I came back to find half of the sauce had boiled over and was pooling on the bottom of my microwave :)  What remained in the bowl was tasty.  Decreased sugar substantially since I lost so much of the rhubarb/strawberry.

I was so excited to make this as Rhubarb and Strawberries were on sale this but this was very disappointing. I have made rhubarb sauce many times with only a little water and sugar and I love it but the addition of the Tapioca made it so sticky and thick. I had to soak the dish I microwaved it in for hours. Way too thick. I will stick my old recipe.
