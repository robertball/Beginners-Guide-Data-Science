These little gems are dangerous!  Don't  plan on eating only one.  I had no vegetable oil so I used an equal amount of coconut oil and it worked out well.  I added the Sriracha after I mixed the rest of the ingredients so it wasn't totally incorporated, more like streaks of it throughout the biscuit, which we liked.  I would suggest mixing it with the half and half before mixing it all together if you prefer total incorporation. Either way -  don't just sit there - go make some!

Mindful of Hubs' sensitive innards, I was hesitant to try these despite being tempted by the addition of the Sriracha. But he gave me the "go ahead." We both thought they were great, tho' for different reasons.  I thought they were incredibly quick and easy to mix up and the resulting biscuit was soft and tender in the inside and appealingly crackly on the top.  I loved them, even tho' I tasted no Sriracha.  Hubs liked them too, calling them "pleasantly warm" with the Sriracha and admitting those with a higher heat tolerance may want to add more. Bottom line, these are an easy, tasty biscuit, worth making over again and again.

These biscuits are so flavorful and rich, with just the right amount of heat.  Super-simple prep, and lovely results.  Rather than melt butter and brush on with salt afterward, I placed a pat of salted butter on each biscuit fresh from the oven.  I had leftovers, and sealed them in a baggie once cool.  The leftovers were enjoyed the following morning.  A quick 15 seconds in the microwave turned out still-moist and even more flavorful biscuits.  Thank you for this recipe!

We loved these! I did double the Sriracha sauce just because we like it and I did opt to brush the biscuits with butter. These were super easy and a nice change of pace to the regular old biscuit. Thanks for sharing.

These are excellent! I made some subs - coconut milk & coconut oil, and added an extra 1.5Tblsp Sriracha. They have just enough heat, but they don't burn your mouth. They really are easy to mix & portion. I got 9 large ice cream scoopsful, which is a "normal" sized biscuit to me. I can't imagine 2" balls only making 6! (And if you make 6 they'd be like little loaves of bread...)The Sriracha bread on here is good, and so is this - what next? Cookies??? Hmmm....

Ok, I have to admit,  I didn't follow the directions exactly! I didn't add the hot sauce, but added honey instead.  I didn't have half & half,  so I made buttermilk with whole milk and lemon juice. The biscuits turned out awesome!  This is a great basic recipe that uses self-rising flour,  which I have tons of! I think there's lots of ways that you could jazz this recipe up to make it your own!

FANTASTIC!!!!! I only had heavy cream, co I used that in place of the 1/2 & 1/2. These were so moist, tender and just DELICIOUS! I used my biggest cookie scoop to divide up the dough and that gave me exactly 12 biscuits. BigShotsMom is right...you will not be able to eat only one, they are that good! This is a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These biscuits are soooo good and the best part soooo easy.  I have them many times and changed them up.  Chives, a little cheese.  My kids can't believe that something that good could be so easy to make.

I made a half batch of this with homemade self-rising flour, following the recipe exactly except for the Sriracha, which I eyeballed. I probably wound up with a smidge more than a half T, and it was perfect for me, but a little on the spicy side for my hubby. My half batch made five biscuits about the size of a slider bun. I'd say I could make them larger for sandwiches, but  that might be a bit much; they would be perfect for mini chicken sandwiches with some honey on them, a la the famous "hot chicken" that's become so popular. Thumbs up, for both taste and ease of prep.

Made as written, turned out great. May add more hot sauce next time to kick it up a notch for the heat seekers in the family.

WOW these are good! Made them just as directed, and they turned out great. So easy, and they can be tweaked to meet anyone's taste. I'm keeping this recipe and I can't wait to make them again.

Awesome biscuits!  I was really worried about the oiliness of the dough but they came out perfect.  We are not hot heads but will double the sriracha next time.  The dough was very orange so we were surprised it didn't have more of a kick. Cooked biscuits were tinted but not orange. As stated in other reviews, these are dangerously good!

All I can say is yummm. Used 3 tsp baking powder and unbleached flour.  Also used 1- 1/2 T. Siracha. Could have used salt.
