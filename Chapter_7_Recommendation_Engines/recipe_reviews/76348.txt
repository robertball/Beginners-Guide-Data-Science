This dip had a great texture. Not everyone liked the flavor--I think goat cheese is an aquired taste, and my guests aren't there yet.  Try this one when you are hosting people with a more sophisticated palette

If you like goat cheese and butternut squash, you'll love this dip!

I served with sliced baguette and substituted roasted pine nuts for the walnuts.  Also added a little bit of salt.

For a more mild flavor, you could substitute cream cheese for 1/2 of the goat cheese.

Very beautiful appetizer.  Lots of great comments!

I made and sampled this recipe for about 100 shoppers at our co-op and people absolutely loved it!  I used a 2 1/4# squash and goat chevre, but I only put about 1T fresh lemon juice in it - it came out perfect (along with 2 small heads of local red winter garlic and a pinch of Himalayan pink sea salt).  The garlic flavor was subtle and the dip was surprisingly sweet (and a beautiful light orange color).  I served it with Food Should Taste Good gluten-free multi-grain chips and sweet potato chips (the verdict was that the multi-grain chips were the best because of their saltiness, but the sweet potato chips were good too).

We didn't care for this. The goat cheese flavor was too strong and the tang from the lemon seemed to accentuate that even more. Maybe a combo of feta and cream cheese would be better? It was also very thick. Probably won't attempt this again.

I made a smaller version, with a golden nugget squash, and it was terrific.  I'm making it with a turban squash as the serving bowl for Thanksgiving.  Hopefully it will still be as good.

Everyone loved it! Used one 8 oz package of cream cheese and one 4 oz package of goat cheese. This really does make A LOT of dip, I'll cut in half next time.

Huge hit.  HUGE.  Everyone loved it!  Only two remarks: 1) it makes a lot.  Be prepared - if it isn't a big party, you will be blessed with leftovers (especially if you are like us and always have too much food!)  2) needs salt.  I use the pink Himalayan and it was perfect.  Other than that, it's perfect as is.

LOVE this dip. It's always a hit wherever I bring it. The only change i made was to use 1/2 goat cheese and 1/2 cream cheese. Delish! Thanks!

I really like butternut squash and I love goat cheese, but for some reason I did not love this dip. Maybe b/c I like a dip to be sort of salty and the squash made this sweet. It wasn't bad, just not the dip for me.

I was surprised that, upon taking this to a party, it was a hit.  It is true, you have to enjoy goat cheese to like it, but people were raving. The walnuts are key, I would recommend adding even up to a half a cup. Also, I just used lemon juice instead of a lemon, and it was fine.

This dip is awesome either warm or cold.  I have not used a whole head of garlic only about half.  Some I have served it to are not as thrilled with it as our family, I guess you have to like goat cheese.

I just found this ... weird. It wasn't the goat cheese either as I love that. It's not bad exactly, but I wouldn't make it again.

I love butternut and goat cheese as well as sweet/savory combinations and I really wanted to like this.  It was better when first made, but I needed to add a lot of milk to thin it to dippable consistency.  We served pumpkin tortilla chips.

I'm giving this recipe a 3 because I liked it as it was written, but my boyfriend hated it.  The second day we added bacon and green onion.  He thought it was better, but I didn't.  Turns out that neither one of us ate it beyond the second time, but he hates squash so that isn't really saying anything.  I think it might be better if you use a food processor to eliminate strings, but the original dip was good on bagels.
