These pecan pie bars are so delicious! I am not a fan of pecan pie, but I'm pretty sure I could eat the whole batch of these pecan pie bars. The buttery crust is absolute perfection, and I wouldn't change anything about this recipe! You must make these this holiday season… you won't be sorry!

I love these - so easy to make and oh so TASTY!!  The buttery crust on the bottom really enhances the moist pecan pie filling on top. They don't last long in my house, so it's a good thing they're easy to make!

All the flavors of pecan pie without any of the hassle of homemade pastry!  Love these.  Cooked them at 350 in a glass pyrex dish for 22 minutes and they turned out great.

The first time I made these were for a bake sale at work. They are SOOOO good and went SOOOO fast! People who bought one came back for more. The buttery crust with pecan and toffee goodness is worth 5 stars easy just as the recipe is written. The toffee bits are what really makes this stand out. I've made them without when I didn't have them on hand and you can really taste the difference.

These were super easy but very, very tasty! Everyone loved them! Thanks for posting the recipe.

(The previos reviewer that commented they substituted chocolate chips for the toffee bits then complained they were lacking the pecan pie flavor, you left out what gives it the proper flavor.)

Amazing!!! Might add a few more pecans next time but very fast, easy and delicious. Also, I cooked the crust about 5 minutes longer.

Made these for Thanksgiving.  Substituted mini chocolate chips for the toffee, and they were very good.  They don't have the chewy brown top that comes from brown sugar and karo - so really not like pecan pie - but good in a different way.

Made for a large group. Everyone loved them. Several asked for the recipe. The center is gooey but delightful. Pleasant blends of taste & texture.

Extremely easy to make and taste awesome.  They were gone in no time — cool completely before cutting.  When cutting wipe the knife after every cut — it will give you a nice even straight line cut.

I was disappointed in the topping.  It was easy to make.  I liked the crust.   It the topping didn’t have a lot of taste for me.  I might make it again, but will need to add something to bring out the taste.

I found the crust and filling were a bit overcooked, at least in my oven,  I will try it again with a different crust and less time.  PS  Don't wait too long before cutting them- dry out quickly.
