I'm on my second batch of these. They roll out beautifully and are easy to work with. I sometimes have to cover with foil in the last minutes of baking because they brown easily. The only difference in our recipes are mine calls for regular soda, not diet.

This is the best!  I make pies for a local restaurant and even my largest bulk recipe doesn;t come close to this one.  I will be using this LOTS!!!  Still a nice, flaky texture that handles well.  thankyou for sharing.

Makes a delicious, flaky pie crust.  Freezes very well.  My family ranted and raved about how good this crust was.

This is my third time to use this recipe and I sincerely hope it is better with the modifications I have made. The two previous batches were made exactly as directed but the resulting crusts were balls of grease...there is either TOO MUCH SHORTENING or TOO LITTLE FLOUR...same difference....additionally it needs salt.  These are the changes I have made.  7 lbs flour, 3 lbs shortening, 2 T salt, 28 oz soda.  Wish me good results as I REALLY need a good bulk pie crust recipe.

Wow, is this a lot of pie crusts... but very tasty and flaky, and they do freeze super well! The only thing I could complain about is finding a bowl/tub big enough to mix them in all at once, but it's really such a small thing to whine about when they're so convenient afterwards! ^_^ Five gold stars, two thumbs up, and thank you so much for the time saver!

I looked at this and was a bit taken back and then I read the reviews. I am horrified and offend to the Author of this submission by the 2 or 3 moron's who had the audacity to rate and comment of a recipe they had not even tried. I too have a master in Culinary Arts from a well know and well rated top Culinary School. There is NOTHING wrong with this recipe. After reading the mostly 5 Star reviews I am bound and determined to make it as soon as humanly possible. Shame on you few that are so ignorant. Thank you to our submitter it looks as it you helped a lot of people!

Extremely easy.  I cut this recipe down a lot in order to try it.  I cut it to 5 servings and got about the amount needed for 5 crusts.  I put four in the freezer and used one for a quiche.  It worked perfectly . . .I think I may make more of this crust to hang out in the freezer for more quiche.  thanks for the recipe!

While this wouldn't impress the avid baker in my family, it is perfect for me! On a busy night it's ideal to thaw for a quick quiche or pot pie. Just make sure to make the "baseballs" big enough. I made them too small my first try so had to use two per recipe.

I am on my second batch now only because I have time to. I made a batch June 29th of this year and ran out ( not knowing my other half was using them for his pies.lol)right before Thanksgiving. I had to get store bought for the last pie. I am glad in a way that happened as it showed me the BIG difference in taste & texture. SUPERMOMOF4's was by far better all around.The store bought came out doughy tasting even though it was cooked the same way as this recipe. SUPERMOF4'S was flaky and had a wonderful taste(all I had was reg. Sprite). I did some balls but also put them right into a pie pan and froze them.(so much easier & quicker to making pies). I used my Foodsaver to vacuum seal it. Everyone mentioned how light and flaky the crust was. This is my pie crust from now on.
Thank you SUPERMOMF4 for sharing this.

We have a local pie shop that touts themselves as the World's Best. They really need this crust recipe.  It's comes out perfect every time I've made it.  I use it for savory dishes like Chicken Pot pie and Pasties as well as pies.  It's wonderfully flaky and is fantastic to have on hand.

Mediocre. The taste is about on par with store bought frozen crusts. I originally liked that it had fewer ingredients than my grandmother's recipe, but the amount of work to prepare was the same and the result was nowhere near. For some reason, my crust also burned way too easily even when using tin foil. Final verdict: either buy pillsbury or use a traditional crust recipe (same amount of work).

Wonderfully short, tasty crust. I love it. I used only 16 ounces of soda pop; more would have been too moist. I've given some of the frozen dough to friends as they liked the cooked crust so much! Thanks for a super recipe!

I have used this recipe for 23 years. It has been used by several family members and continues to be given to daughter-in-laws, now we and nephews. It has been proven over and over. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I did not make any changes to the recipe with the exception of using regular soda instead of diet.  I was tired of spending money on store bought crusts when I was short on time.  This recipe makes sure I have some on hand when I need it.  Thank you.....wonderful recipe.  ( I do like to use butter flavored shortening.)
