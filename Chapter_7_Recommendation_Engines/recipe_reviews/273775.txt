This is really good and it works exactly as written. If you donâ€™t have mafalde pasta, use lasagna sheets broken into pieces.

I used turkey in place of beef as I no longer am allowed to eat any beef, pork--no red meat at all.  I did everything else the same but without salt/pepper. Rarely use either of them. I loved it. Actually turned on my oven (a VERY rare thing as I am alone now.)
Tasted great.
