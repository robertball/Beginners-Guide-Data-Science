I'm out there in the bartending world and the new "baby guinness" is a shot of Cafe Patron (coffee flavored tequila, delish) and a floater of Bailey's Irish Creme...try it, you'll like it :)

These are great at parties and my husband and I absolutely love these!  They do look just like the beer if you pour them correctly but beware because they go down very easy...

This really does work! Make sure your alcohol is cold before you do this. I shake up the alcohol seperately with ice in my cocktail shaker before pouring.

This was a fun treat on St. Paddy's day. We poured the cream on the top over the back of a spoon so it rests nicely on top and it looked great. This is very sweet, perfect for the sweet tooth!

This is a really great idea, fantastic presentation (I always need to pour my cream over a spoon for separation). It's a sweeter shot than we usually take but the novelty makes up for it and most everyone can handle them at a party. I agree with the tip about shaking the liqueur separately with ice (at least the coffee), it's better cold and you don't notice the super-sweetness as much. Thanks for sharing.

We must have done something wrong because it certainly didn't have a head like in this picture.  You could barely see the Bailey's at all.  We were disappointed but, of course, we still drank it.

It's a good idea but be sure not to add to much Irish Cream. You really only need to top it off

Yum! I LOVE Kahlua and Bailey's (especially Bailey's!), so it's no surprise I liked the two paired together. :) My husband opened a bottled of Guinness to go with dinner. I love the way a stout looks when poured into a glass and REALLY wanted to take a sip... but didn't (I HATE beer). Other than needing to work on my "technique," this really hit the spot. I didn't get a nice "head" as I'd hoped, but this went down so smooth, I didn't care lol! Hard to believe, I don't own any shot glasses so I had to use a juice glass instead. I think that's why I didn't get the effect I was hoping for. Thanks for sharing your idea, William. This was really fun to try! :-)

Love, love love these!  Used to drink them all the time (probably too much) when I lived in Stamford, CT.  Now I'm in the Midwest and I have to teach bartenders how to make them!  The secret to having the right look is to slowly pour the Bailey's over a spoon.

We have been doing the Cafe Patron with Baily's version. They are always a hit and quite delicious. Imbibe with caution, they will catch up with you!
