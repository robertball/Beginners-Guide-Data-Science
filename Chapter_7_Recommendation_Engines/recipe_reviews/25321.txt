AWESOMELY GOOD! Ok I'm literally in the middle of making this but had to share my success. This has excellent taste! I have never tried to prepare eggplant although eggplant parmesan is my fav at the restaurant...not anymore! I'll make this at home healthier and cheaper! Taking several bits of advice from previous reviews this is how I did it. 
1) Sweat the 1/4" slices by sprinkling with sea salt and letting sit for 30 min. Rinse, pat dry w/paper towel (get good & dry)
2) Dip slices into beaten eggs and coat in gallon sized ziploc bag for easy cleaner breading. I used seasoned bread crumbs and tossed in about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.
3)Place on baking sheet coated with EVOO then bake for 7 min at 450, flip and bake add'l 5-7 mins depending on how crisp you like it (mine were nice a crisp @ 7 min per side)
4) At this point I am eating the slices as is with a fork and they are great! I will be placing them on angel hair pasta and covering with homemade sauce and cheese then baking just to melt it all together. It's wonderful! I plan to try freezing extra slices after they come out of the oven, but before mixing with anything for next time I get a craving!

This recipe is worthy of more than 5 stars.  Baking the eggplant instead of frying does not take away from the flavor of the dish one bit.  It does, however, need to bake longer than stated.  I baked mine for about 20 minutes until it was lightly browned.  Also, I chose to sweat the eggplant before breading by peeling, slicing, sprinkling with sea salt and placing in a collander in the sink for about 30 minutes.  This pulls out any bitterness.  Just be sure to rinse it well with water and pat dry with paper towels before breading.  I did two layers of eggplant.  You can layer however you like, you just to be sure the top layer of eggplant is topped with sauce and then cheese.  This is my husband's favorite dish.

This dish turned out quite well - my boyfriend and I both want to make it again. However, 3 eggplants was way too much - next time I will use a good medium sized one and a smaller one. I salted each slice and let it sit for twenty minutes before rinsing in cold water, as per another suggestion, and then found that 2 1/2 cups of breads crumbs and two eggs sans yolks were plenty to cover all the eggplant slices. However, the slices definitely needed to be cooked a little longer than five minutes on a side - next time I might try cooking ten minutes a side. Over all, though, a good recipe!

Excellent! I scaled this down for 3 servings and ended up using 3 eggs as well as 2 cups of bread crumbs. I made my own "italian" version by adding garlic powder, oregano, 2 tbs parmesan, salt, pepper and paprika. I followed some of the reviewer's advice and baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side. I recommend everyone do this as the eggplant was just cooked. I also sliced the eggplant to 1/4 inch slices as we don't like them too thin. My husband gave this a 10 out of a 5 :-).
 For those of you whose eggplant sticks to the pan without oiling your baking sheet, try parchment paper. ITS EXCELLENT! You don't have to use anything to grease your pans and nothing sticks. You can also reuse it. 
Thanks so much for sharing!

Positively LOVE this! Have made it several times already. I DO salt the eggplant first, and dip slices in just egg whites only-- no need for the extra fat in the yolks; bake slices 10 min per side; I use healthy choice garlic lovers sauce. One medium eggplant and about 1/2 of a 26 oz jar of sauce seems to be a perfect amount for me and hubby with leftovers for another whole dinner. DELICIOUS!!

Recipe needed a little manipulation but it turned out so good. I added spinach and used Muir glen tomatos. My husband and preschooler loved it. I am giving this recipe 5 stars just because it is a great way to experiment and encourage you to try cooking with eggplant (wich is great and yummy). I read most of the reviews before starting out. The most common problems seemed to be the texture of the eggplant after cooking (undercooking) and the bitterness? (Not really an issue).  So I sliced these very very Thinly, about a quarter of an inch. Salting eggplant to remove bitterness didn't make sense to me because salt will induce osmosis and draw out water which you need to keep the flesh plump. You do not want a withered eggplant. I did my own test and it seemed that the part between the skin and flesh was the most bitter? so I just peeled it more deeply and let it sit in fresh cold water for 15 minutes. The eggplant was not bitter at all. But I think that may also have to do with the variety of eggplant available to you. So try a different variety if your eggplant is really bitter. Finally after cooking my dish for 30 minutes the flesh was still chewy so I had to let it cook for an additional 30 minutes. At this point the eggplant had a great texture. So either the cooking temperature or the time frame was off. So other than these minor setbacks, The meal was really good, it was like an eggplant lasagna. Thanks for the recipe I will make it again.

First of all, jarred spaghetti sauce is a no-no in our house. It only takes a few minutes and a few ingredients to make a quick marinara sauce to pair with this dish.  My tip for cooking the eggplant slices, is to skip breading, frying or baking entirely. Simply slice them, brush with EVOO and grill on both sides until lightly browned. You can use the gas grill or a ridged grill pan or indoor griddle. It really cuts down on the fat, carbs and calories and lets the eggplant, sauce and cheese be the stars. Breading the eggplant adds  too much heaviness and masks the flavors, in my opinion. Also, this tip from Patricia Wells excellent Italian cookbook "Trattoria": Do not salt or peel the eggplant.  Fresh eggplant should never be bitter and the peel imparts a rich, deep flavor.

Wonderful recipe!  However, I did use some of the suggestions mentioned in some of the other reviews.  I used 2 good sized eggplants instead of 3.  To remove the bitterness, I salted the eggplant and let it sit for 20-30 minutes and then rinsed with cold water.  And I baked it for 10 minutes on each side.  Came out great.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a very good, easy and healthy version of this dish.  I did salt my eggplant first for about 20 min, and let stand in colander in the sink..then rinsed it well w/ cold water - it takes the bitterness out of the eggplant.  I used Italian breadcrumbs and added some garlic pepper to them.  My family loved it, and no frying!!!!!

Delicious!  I baked my eggplant for about 10 minutes without turning it over and then turned the oven off and let the eggplant sit for about 30 minutes in the warm oven. It came out perfect.  Just don't forget to peel the eggplant.

This recipe was excellent (just as good as frying!!!) and so much healthier, too. I par-boiled the eggplant slices (not sliced too thin or else they will not hold together)for about 1-2 minutes (no longer or else the slices will be too soft and fall apart)in salted, boiling water (in a large pan so water can circulate around the slices)before dipping and breading them. Drain well after rinsing in cold water. Let slices sit on paper towel to dry also. I find that this "pre-cooking" makes the eggplant nice and soft in the center instead of hard and /spongy. (It won't absorb half as much oil when frying it if you cook it that way instead of using this recipe.) I used Italian seaoned bread crumbs. I found that I needed about five or six eggs instead of two. I baked the breaded slices on cookie sheets coated with "Pam" in a pre-heated 375 degree oven for 10 minutes on each side side, too. This was time consuming, but, well worth it. I used an Italian blend of cheese instead of just mozzerella. I would say it serves 6.

Mine turned out amazing!  All the family loved it and much better than any restaurant eggplant parm!  A few modifications: 1.  DO spinkle with salt before using as other reviewers have suggested. Rinse with cold water after 30min. 2.  DO pat dry. 3.  DIP each slice of eggplant in flour PRIOR to egg wash, then bread with PANKO breadcrumbs (these specialty crumbs are much crisper than regular crumbs).  Mix 3 cups PANKO crumbs, 1 tsp pepper, 2 tsp salt, 1/2 grated parm or padano cheese and zest of 1 lemon.  Use this as your breading, much more flavor. 3.  Bake for 10 min @ 350 C, turn over and bake for another 10 min.  Then bake at 400 C for 15-20 min until golden brown. 4.  Layer with sauce and cheese.  In middle layer add fresh basil finely chopped.  Enjoy!

This is just little note for all you eggplant fans, there is a male and a female eggplant, and the female is more bitter and has more seeds.  The way to tell is to look at the large end of the eggplant if the brown spot is elonged it is a male if it is completely round it is a female.  Again the Male is less bitter.

WOW! I will never fry eggplant again.  I love eggplant parm, but i never thought it could taste this good baked!   I didnt change the original recipe too much.  I used 2 small firm eggplants. (When buying eggplant i find the smaller firm ones have the sweetest taste..so even though you think you're getting more for your money by buying a large one, the small ones taste SO MUCH better!  and then theres no need to spend extra on the expensive small japanese eggplants) I cut quarter inch slices, salted and weighed the eggplant, then dipped in the whites and then a mixture of italian bread crumbs, panko, and parmesean.  I wiped some EVOO on a large baking pan, made a single layer, and sprayed them with a little PAM. Crank the oven up to 425 and baked them 10 minutes on each side. They came out so crispy and delicious!  Then i layered a little bit of sauce right over the eggplant and topped with skim Mozz and finished it off by broiling it for just a few minutes until the cheese is brown and beautiful.  Good enough to serve to guests!  and half the calories of frying!

Loved this dish Another hint in pre-baking the slices. I put a cooling rack inside the baking sheet and put my slices on that, then I cooked them for a total of 10 minutes. They came out nice and crispy and no need to turn them over. I then followed the rest of the recipe as written.

FanfrakinTastic!!  100% Yummy! I do a lot of research  so I can get the recipe right, ingr. aren't cheap!  Anyhow, this is what I used & did: 1 med. eggplant: NO NEED TO SWEAT, peeled and thinly sliced, 3 eggs & 2 c plain breadcrumbs. I baked in Parchment lined Baking pan for about 7 min each side.  I used shredded parm & shredded mozz about 1/2 c low moisture or each., basil, Garlic Powder, Italian Seasonings and Pepper to taste.  3/4 of a jar of Prego. One casserole dish made 4 nice size servings. My calories & gist came to more Protein:  34 per serving. Calories: 456 per serving, fat: 23 per serving, Carb: 69 per serving, Fiber: 11 per serving.  Pre-sprayed a casserole with Pam and put a couple tablespoons of sauce just to wet the bottom, not drench, a little goes a long way!  Then I placed the eggplant in a single layer in the casserole dish.  Then I put a layer of Mozz and Parm cheeses and REPEATED with remaining amounts.  I sprinkled the seasonings; Basil, Garlic Powder, Italian Seasonings and a touch of pepper all over the top and baked for 40 minutes, till it was golden brown.  We absolutely love this recipe, it made a gorgeous Eggplant Parm that tasted high end!  We ate it all up!  I made it again & made 2 casserole dishes worth and froze one and we ate one.  It freezes so well!  Microwave to reheat at 50-60% power for 5 min. Yum!

I didn't give this a 1-star rating because "Couldn't eat it" would be unfair.  BUT, I couldn’t give it more than 2 because the recipe is misnamed and misleading.  This may be perfectly wonderful, but it is NOT "Eggplant Parmesan", it's an eggplant casserole.  And that's fine, but eggplant parmesan is a very classic dish and calling this eggplant parmesan is like playing Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture and calling it Beethoven’s Fifth.  Or suggesting carbonara sauce can be made without eggs!  A wonderfully simple dish with three main ingredients:  eggplant, LOTS of parmigiano reggiano cheese and “sugo” (gravy) or what we call spaghetti sauce, Eggplant Parmesan uses FRIED eggplant and is so loved because of the beautiful marriage of flavors between the eggplant and parmigiano reggiano cheese!  
When I make it (just like my Italian mother and grandmother, see the photos) I use the sugo that’s simmering on the stove, flavored by a roast, meatballs and sometimes sausage so there’s no need to add herbs or spices because the sauce imparts a flavor that you cannot get out of a jar.  No breadcrumbs! No basil!  And NO MOZZARELLA!  Two last things:  eggplant should always be sliced VERTICALLY for frying.  Crosswise slices allow eggplant fibers to soak up the oil. And if you think Italians only use olive oil, think again.  Eggplant should be fried in an oil that can withstand a high temperatures.  Grapeseed oil is best, heated to about 330 degrees.

These were spectacular! I did not bake mine in the sauce and cheese because I wanted to have leftovers for my husband to pack for work the next day. I added the sauce and cheese in top of them after they were done in the oven. They were crispy and fantastic! I baked mine at 450 for 10 minutes per side and they were cooked perfectly. I also did the whole sprinkle them with salt and let them sit for 20 minutes bit that the other reviews said to do. My husband said they tasted even better the next day.

There are so many variations of this wonderful recipe.  I was in a hurry so I didn't even bother to bread the eggplant.  I just cubed it and roasted it for about 20 minutes with some olive oil, red wine vinegar, Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper.  Then I topped it with tomato sauce and a little finely shredded mozzarella and heated it through.  We had it with whole wheat pasta and a Greek Salad.  Here is a tip for those of you with bitter eggplants:  select small, young, slender eggplants because they contain fewer seeds (the seeds can make them bitter).

A great tasting, simple recipe that does indeed taste fried. As there aren't many ingredients, be sure to use high quality sauces and cheese. I've made this several times, and have two recommendations for folks who said the eggplant was too soggy:
1) Shake off as much of the egg mixture as possible; it should only be lightly coated
2) Before breading, slice eggplant slices very thin; sandwich between paper towels and stack plates on top of one another for at least 10 minutes This will dry out the eggplant a little and it will cook to be crispier. A warning though: this makes the recipe considerably more time consuming

THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST!!!!  I had not made Eggplant Parmesan in years and I had a taste for it the other day.  I was ready to fry the eggplant until I found this recipe.  The eggplant bakes perfectly and never gets mushy.  I leave the skin on because I like the flavor.  I also salt the eggplant first for about 1/2 hour the wash off to take the bitterness out.  I also added herbs to the bread crumbs because I didn't have italian bread crumbs.  In addition, I use the Ragu Meaty Sauce instead of the Marinara Sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

Be sure to keep the layers thin so they get a nice crunch.

This method is excellent and beats frying by a mile if it's done right.  I never salt and drain the eggplant, never seems to matter.  Flour, a lot more egg (whites) than recipe calls for, and seasoned panko instead of bread crumbs.  Spray w/ Pam, bake 10 mins, flip them over and spray w/ Pam again.  Crunchy without the oil!  Proceed w/ recipe and you can't go wrong.  Top with some dried hot pepper flakes if that's what you like, we do.  Thanks!

I made this and thought it was very, very good. I followed other reviewers advice and  put some salt on the cut eggplant to let it "sweat". I only used one eggplant, and one jar of sauce. I cooked the eggplant in the oven for 10 min. on each side, instead of 5, and it was just right. I chose Paul Newman's Tomato and Garlic sauce, and it was yummy. Overall, I liked this very much and I will definitely make this again.

WOW!  This is one of my favorite dishes that my husbands Grandmother used to make & passed away with it in her head.  I took the advice of Betty Crocker & looked for a "male" eggplant because they have fewer seeds (hence, they are less bitter).  This is WONDERFUL!  I cut it down to three servings (which is still a lot) because my husband doesn't eat this dish, but I get 3 meals & don't even have to share!  Thank you VERY much Dolores, its awesome!

This is great....have been making it this way now for about a year, and I love the "no fry" thing!! As every good cook knows, you need to alter recipes a bit..I add more sauce (and cheese) than it calls for, and that softens the eggplant when it bakes...as far as it being brown..who cares!!!! The sauce makes it red, and the fat content is lower than frying!!! Fry or bake, they both end of tasting the same --- one is just lower in fat.....and.....it is GREAT!!!!!! There is NO WAY to mess this great recipe up!!!!

This is delicious and very easy! Baking is much less messy than frying and healthier. Use olive oil cooking spray or if you have one of those atomizer pumps for actual oil, really limits amount of oil needed. I followed the reviewer suggestions of soaking the 1/4 in slices in cold salty water then drying on towels before dipping in egg substitute and coating in bread crumbs. I upped oven setting to 400 and flipped them when they looked brown on bottom. Not exact, but that is cooking. Recipes are more guidelines than rules. My whole family loves this from my omnivore hubby to my picky 10 yr. old veggie hater.  Even the 2 yr. old and 5 yr. Old!

Fantastic! I just used this recipe for a SECOND time and I wanted to write my review before I sat down to eat. I love eggplant as a meat alternative during the work week. I bought two from Aldi and needed to use them up before they went bad. This is a very easy recipe. Before I tried this, I always read recipes where the eggplant was fried first and then put in the oven. I do eat fried food, but for some reason, that process turned me off (personal quirk). Anyway, when I found this, I was immediately intrigued. Full disclosure: I always tend to read the reviews along with the recipes. I followed the recipe EXCEPT, I used sea salt to sweat the slices and I baked them for nearly 20 minutes. I didn't turn them over since I used a wire sheet. The sweating process allowed me to make my sauce (always make my own sauce), so the time was productive. My sauce typically includes carrots, zucchini, and onion, so the veggie content is high in this dish for me. I used Italian bread crumbs and I mixed in parmesan and some basil (adore basil). I had a lot of slices, so I built three layers lasagna-style. I also baked for 40 mins then poked to see the tenderness. I ended up baking an additional ten. It smells so good. I'm taking a coworker some tomorrow and as w/Italian food, I know it'll taste even more delicious the second day. GREAT RECIPE!!

I used this recipe for dinner and it was amazing!!! I cut the eggplant thin (not length wise but width size). I salted each piece with sea salt for 30 minutes. Rinsed, dried each really well. I used a ziploc bag for the eggs and one for the bread crumbs. Less mess. I followed the directions posted for baking at 450 for 7 minutes. I assembled the eggplant, parmessan and mozzarella as per the directions. Baked for 30 minutes at 350.I absolutely loved this recipe. Will continue to make it for family and friends.

Made this today for guests.  WONDERFUL!  Didn't know I loved eggplant!  Used 2 cups gluten free breadcrumbs, 2 med eggplants (a bit shy in my monster lasagna pan), and three eggs but some was left.  I have no idea how much sauce I used - I made Grandma's recipe and put the rest in the fridge.
I did fry the eggplant because the breadcrumbs were panko style and I was afraid the heavy crumb might burn in the oven but next time I think I will either buy the right texture or grind them finer.
I also did the salt/sweat for 30 minutes then rinsed and dried the slices first.  They seemed to completely change after that treatment and were not salty at all.  Since eggplant is a nightshade, I'm sure that is part of the  trick to success with these beauties.
Actually, I think I will skip lasagna from now on and make this instead.  Less work, extra serving of veggies, and no ricotta!

I got some eggplant at the farmers market so I searched for some recipes to use it.  This one seemed perfect because we are trying to cut down on the fat and eat healthier.  I used one eggplant (fairly large) and it made a 13x9 glass dish full.  As for prep - I never, ever peel eggplant - why would you?  You lose much of the fiber and most of the vitamins and other good stuff hiding just under the skin.  You couldn't even tell the skin was there - and no, I didn't salt the slices.  It wasn't bitter - it was delicious.  After dipping in egg and dredging in bread crumbs, I sprayed each slice with cooking spray so it would brown better.  I didn't use canned/bottled sauce but made a simple marinara out of diced tomatoes, some olive oil, garlic, red wine, basil and other herbs/spices.  My husband thought this was wonderful and he's not a big eggplant parm fan.  I order this a lot when we eat out but now I can make it at home anytime.  This was as good or better than any I've had at a restaurant. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I went to use this recipe and ended up not following it at all, and doing it the way my mother does. Flour, egg, italian bread crumbs. Lightly cook in olive oil just to brown.  Layer in pan with sauce, provolone and mozzerella cheese and baking.

I have never even tried Eggplant Parmesan before, much less prepared it before but I thought I'd give it a try.  I did salt the eggplant for 30 minutes first and cooked at 450 for 5-7 mins on each side as others recommended.  It took me a long time to make (like an hour and a half total) but it ended up being so worth it!  Both me and my husband loved it, it turned out perfectly.  I did not peel the eggplant and I couldn't even taste the peel, it wasn't bitter at all.  I saw someone posted a pic where they sliced the eggplant length-wise instead and I think I'll try that next time to save on time, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  So good, thanks for the recipe! :)

"This is so good. It's better than my mom's." That's what my wife said after eating this. I did modify the original recipe per other reviews. Peeled & sliced about 1/4" thick, sprinkled w/sea salt & let sit for 20 min. Then rinsed in cold water and patted VERY dry w/ paper towels. Dipped each slice in eggwash and coated with italian bread crumbs. Baked on cookie sheet 8-10 mins on each side. Then layered in 9x13 casserole dish with prov. & mozz. cheese. Only adding the top layer of cheese for the last 10 minutes of cooking. Very easy to make and a real pleasure for the senses.

My husband brought home some lovely eggplant from our local farmer's market and requested eggplant parmesan, a dish I'd avoided like the plague when I was a child (I think the name "eggplant" sounds gross and is a turn-off for young ones). I was excited to find this recipe for a baked version as I prefer to cook with little extra fats. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers -- i.e. increased baking time and temperature for the eggplant (400 degrees, 10 minutes per side), sweating the eggplant first -- and it turned out beautifully. I also made my own sauce because I prefer it to any store-bought brand. Along with a green salad and some hot french bread, this was a great meal. 
  However, I have a warning for inexperienced/busy cooks: this was extremely work and time intensive. From start to finish this dish took me over three hours to prepare, not the optimistic two and a quarter hours listed on the recipe. This is definitely a recipe for a long Saturday afternoon.

Very tasty! There isn't much to making eggplant parm but I loved the difference of baking it instead of frying! I sliced the eggplant thin, placed the slices on paper towels, sprinkled them with salt and pepper and let the slices sweat for about 20 minutes. Then I blotted them and then proceeded with the dipping process. I did bake them 10 minutes on each side, as recommended in other reviews, and it turned out perfectly! Thanks!

I just tried this delicious recipe last night. It was a hit in our eight person household. Our six kids, ages 18 months to nine years old, devoured their food and asked for seconds. I too followed the advice of previous reviewers and salted the 1/4" slices of eggplant beforehand, rinsing with cool water after thirty minutes and then patting dry. I added Parmesan to my Italian breadcrumbs and some red pepper for an added "kick". I used one large eggplant and one medium sized one and still had slices leftover. This recipe is an absolute winner and will be added to our regular meal rotation. Happy Cooking!

Most of the reviews I have read include a "meat only" husband. I have a meat only wife. For some reason, she lives this. She is a picky eater and I just watched her clean her plate. I plan on adding eggplants to my garden and making it from scratch. Fresh basil would add a lot for my taste. Also, breading is unnessesary. Just sweat, dry in the oven and then brown in light oil in a cast iron skillet. Parmesan cheese is expensive, so replace with more ricotta. Try Hunts Garlic and Herb tomato sauce. It is around a dollar a can and is as good of better than most other brands. Cheap and good. Also; pre-shredded cheese is a waste of money. Feed your family, but dont waste money

Super yum! I really enjoyed this. Eggplant is not one of my favorite vegetables (it depends on how it's cooked - sometimes I can tolerate it, other times I can't). Part of my New Year's resolution is to eat healthier so I decided to make this rather than my 'usual' chicken parmesan. I couldn't be happeir with the outcome! :) Having said this, I do feel 2 steps are CRUCIAL to the success of this dish. First, to remove its naturally occurring bitter taste, you MUST sweat your eggplant. Sprinkle ea. slice with a t of kosher salt (per eggplant),being sure to coat the front & backside of it. Add to a colander and allow to "sweat" for a half hr. or so. You'll be surprised how much this enhances the overall taste. Second, be sure to cut your eggplant slices slightly thicker than 1/4 in. I really believe this prevented mine from becoming too mushy (along with ensuring it completely crisped up before layering in my casserole dish). I too found that baking at 450 degrees for a total of 7 min. per side yielded perfectly crisp eggplant slices. Other than adjusting my baking time, my only other changes were using only 1 eggplant and halving everything else, not peeling my eggplant (personal preference) and adding about a 1/2 c. of grated Parmesan cheese to my breadcrumbs. As a finishing touch, I popped my dish under the broiler to brown (mmm....). Served over spaghetti with Texas toast on the side. Thanks for sharing, DOERY! :-)

Im the kind of cook that needs a GPS to find her way around the kitchen- but I think I may have mastered this recipe!
The 2nd time I made it - I did not salt or sweat the eggplant. Its sooo much easier to just peel the skin off  little deeper and slice thin and soak in cold water for a few minutes. Bake 10 min each side. There was no bitterness and the eggplant stayed luscious. I sprinkled some Paul Preudhomme pizza/pasta seasoning (garlic, basil, red pepper, other herbs / spices)on the top before baking and the dish was just Bellisimo!!

I used two small eggplants for three people, yet we still had enough for a second meal with spaghetti. Instead of the egg, I opted for brushing my  sliced and sweated eggplant with EVOO, then coating with the Italian breadcrumbs (a cup or so is enough!) to which I added a Tbsp. each garlic powder, basil and Italian Seasoning, then with about a quarter cup Parm Cheese. I chose Paul Newman's Sockaroonie Sauce for this particular recipe, and although it was a bit thick (easily rectified) it was tasty! I found it necessary to cook the eggplant slices for more like 10 minutes each side. I was surprised by how good this recipe was in the end...

Things I changed: 
Let eggplant sit well-salted for 30 minutes and rinsed and dried to reduce bitterness of the eggplant. Added parmesan to breadcrumbs. Baked eggplant in oven 7 minutes each side at 450 to make crispier. Then added fresh herbs (rosemary, basil, oregano) on top of the cheese layers.
My husband gave me the big eyes when I told him I was serving this for dinner. He doesn't care much for eggplant, nor does his mother. However, they were reaching for more, amazed at how delicious it was, and MIL was raving about the flavor to friends. This is a keeper.

I made this for the first time last night. It was very good.  My family (husband and 16 year old daughter) enjoyed it.  We had a lot of leftovers but I consider that a good thing since I made it on a Sunday and now we all have lunch for at least a couple of days. I had never cooked Eggplant before and there are a few things I would change the next time I make this. Some of the reviewers said to slice your eggplant 1/4" thick.  If you slice them to 1/4" you may have portions of eggplant that are still chewy instead of pliable.  I would slice it thinner next time.  And you don't need to slice it into rounds. You could slice it lenthwise if you wanted to.  Also, I did sweat my eggplant slices but make sure you rinse them really well to get the salt off when you're done.  The eggplant will retain a little of the salt when you rinse it but if you don't rinse it well it will retain a lot of the salt flavor. The 4c of breadcrumbs turned out to be twice as much as we ended up using so I would only use 2c next time. We needed 4 eggs instead of 2.  I added ricotta to my cheese mixture.  I forgot to add the basil but I don't think it took much away from the dish.  My husband has had Eggplant Parmesan before and he said it's the best he's had.  It was pretty tasty, and would be be a better choice for those lasagna lovers who are trying to cut pasta/carbs from their diet.

This recipe comes out very delicious. I use only 1 large eggplant sliced thin but not paper thin.  i do use about a jar and a half of sauce and whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs.  i do parmesan cheese in between the layers and fresh mozzerella cheese on top.

I loved every bite!  Used a 1 pound eggplant, sliced 1/4 inch thick with a mandolin (forgot to peel them, but glad I didn't).  Placed on cooling rack, sprinkled with sea salt, waited 30 minutes, rinsed and dried them between two clean towels, pressing gently.  I put my bread crumbs in a small 1-cup dish to help minimize wasting any crumbs.  After egg wash and dip, I placed them on a cooling rack/cookie sheet to bake...450F oven and 7 minutes each side. PERFECT!  Placed in layers with sauce and cheese as recipe instructed; after first layer, I sprinkled with the basil and just a pinch of cayenne pepper, and then baked until just beginning to bubble and cheese ever so slightly brown.  Just fabulous.  I'll be making this one again!!  Served with cucumber/sour cream dressing, this site...  nice dinner.  :)

This was fabulous.  Three whole eggplants is too much though, try too.  And you don't need to put much sauce on the bottom of the pan before you start, makes it messy to dish out.

I made this for a dinner party and got rave reviews!  I've made it both ways - pan frying the eggplant and baking it - and they come out tasting the same so I opt for the healthier version.  I got rave reviews from everyone.  Oh, and 1 eggplant was plenty to feed three hungry people.

This recipe is great, and I love that it is baked rather than fried!  My fiance does not care for eggplant, but thoroughly enjoys this meal.  Thanks!

My husband brought home 2 eggplants and I asked "What am I supposed to do with those?!" After finding your recipe I decided to give eggplant Parmesan a try. I've never made it. I've never even eaten it before! Your recipe seemed easy enough... Well.. My husband and son went on about how delicious it was for so long it was embarrassing. Thanks for the help. I've added this to my recipe box and will definitely be making it again!

Excellent! I baked the eggplant for 20 min though, 10 min each side, and used the sea salt technique. Highly recommend!

This was very good and easy, but time consuming. I halved the recipe, and I still had to bake the eggplant in five batches, because for a good eggplant parm, the eggplant needs to be sliced very thin. My mistake was in slicing it into rounds--next time, I'll slice it on the bias for bigger (and fewer) pieces. But I love that I can bake this and get the same results as with fried eggplant.

Very good.  I love this reciepe.  I must say though all the talk about bitter eggplant makes me wonder!! While I know most people can't grow their own, the truth be told from what I have read - Eggplant is bitter because they allow it to stay on the vine so long and get huge creating more seeds thus the bitterness.  In every gardening mag I read it says to pick and/ or buy your eggplant smaller.  This will help alot with the bitterness.  I do have a garden and I have never had bitter eggplant - thus I never have to salt or soak it.  If you buy it in the store, try to get the smaller ones, avoid the larger one.  This may help alot with bitterness, or as someone else suggested try another kind.  I grow Ichabon and Black Beauty - the Ichabon is my favorite.   But back to the receipe - just fabulous, Every time I make this everyone even my kids love it.  The baking also makes it easier to freeze the eggplant for another time.  This is a keeper.   I did bake the eggplant for 10 minutes per side - and figured it was going in the oven for another 35 - it would be fine.  If you have leftovers, it is always better the next day.  Thanks for the receipe.

I thought this was OK, though the kids were more of a fan of the cheese and the sauce than the eggplant.  I served with a side of pasta.  Don't know if I would make it again.

Yum Yum!  So good and super easy, since I hate frying!  How long you need to bake the eggplant slices really depends on how thick you slice them - I cut mine about a half inch thick and they needed 10 minutes a side at 375 to be nicely browned.

I don't like to fry things myself so this was a great way for me to try one of my fav. dishes at home. It turned out great. I did sweat the eggplants for 30 min before breading and cooked each one about 10 per side before layering. Will make again soon.

Awesome, Fabulous, Delicious! This does not need another 5* review but I just had to. I love Eggplant Parmesan but I have never found a recipe that surpasses my favorite Italian Restaurant until now. I have made eggplant before but I did not know the secret of sweating the eggplant as suggested by putting sea salt on the eggplant and leaving it set. I let it set for an hour and then turned it over and put sea salt on the other side and let it sweat for another 1/2 hour. I dipped them in a bowl of water to wash it off and then laid it between 2 towels to pat dry well. I assembled as stated with 1/2 of the eggplant and then froze the other 1/2 after baking for another time. I baked them at 450 for 8 minutes on each side before assembling. I served it over a little angel hair pasta with baguette bread. I saved 1 piece for lunch tomorrow and can't wait. I loved Italian and this is my favorite Italian recipe.  Thanks for the tips. It made all the difference in the egg plant. I also used organic marinara sauce.

LOVE IT!!! This should get more than 5 stars for three good reasons: 1) Ease of preparation! It was so simple to bread and bake the eggplant slices rather than the time consuming method of frying them in batches on the stove top! 2) Because they are not fried in oil, this is much healthier and better for your waistline and your arteries! 3) FLAVOR!!! I love Eggplant Parmesan but I normally steer clear from making it because it typically is so lengthy to prepare and extremely high in fat from all the oil used. This recipe solves the problem and seriously tastes great! Thank you so much for submitting this one!

Fan-freakin-tastic!  Hands down definitely one of the better recipes on this site.  I only added some fresh garlic and fresh parsley...oh always good to salt/drain the eggplant beforehand too.  My anti-veggie 5 year old thought it was chicken parm and ate every last bite!!  Unfortunately my 10 yo is wiser to this and wouldn't try it...i'll make this again for sure, so good :D

This was the first time I have ever cooked with eggplant. I salted it and washed it off like several others suggested. I cooked the eggplant at 400 degrees to get it soft enough. Two good size eggplants were more than enough. I also used more sauce and bread crumbs than the recipe called for. It turned out pretty good and I have  a lot leftover.

It was great. We sweat the eggplant like in the video and cooked it  5 min per side. Used sliced mozzerela instead of shredded. Had huge eggplants so i only used two and made a huge pan. Used homemade sauce i canned last week. Everyone lived it. Will definetly make it again.

I have been baking eggplant like this for a couple of years.  For me it is better than frying.  Bread crumbs that fall off tend to burn when frying.  Homemade sauce is worth the effort.  I often freeze the baked eggplant so I can assemble another casserole at a later date.  These baked eggplant slices also work well to separate layers in a vegetable lasagna instead of noodles.

I just made this for my parents, we three ate it for dinner. They raved about it! Not sure if they were being overly polite but they wouldn't have said it if they didn't at least enjoy the recipe. I loved the warm cheesyness and the contrast between the crunch and softness of the eggplant. Not sure if i cooked it too long because I anticiapated it being softer (like cooked broccoli.)

Despite my qualms I would definately make this again and it will be a go-to veggitarian meal.

Recommended modifications:

2 medium-sized eggplants (3 is WAY too much)
2 extra large eggs, or 3-4 medium eggs (I needed more)
2 cups Italian bread crumbs (4 is unnecessary)

1. I like to heat a little stronger, closer to 375 - at least for the initial baking
2. Bake for 10-15 minutes, and use parchment paper not foil
3. This step needs more specification: double-layer the eggplant slices before putting cheese on (you'll run out of cheese otherwise), and only put sauce on top, not in between. Also, basil before or after baking - either way works.
4. I did 45 minutes at 375 to get golden, but that might just be my under-powered oven.

Came out great!

Wonderful recipe, that I have now cooked about 8 times in 3 weeks.  I do have to say, definitely soak your eggplant for a half an hour in salted water first, slice it very thinly too - that's my preference for it.  I used more cheese and more sauce than this called for, but that's just preference as well!  Also, it really depends on how big the eggplant is on how many you need.  3 can end up being way too many, and if that's the case?  Eat them up, LOL, they're yummy, right out of the oven.  I definitely love this recipe, it's fantastic!  Oh, yet another tip.  This stuff refrigerates as an extra casserole BEAUTIFULLY - great for taking somewhere and reheating.  It's just as good the next day as the first.  Great job, Doery!

I couldn't believe how good this was.  Only thing I did differently was to put a little olive oil on the baking sheet with a pastry brush and cooked the eggplant at 425 for 10 minutes a side.  I just used 2 eggplants and it was enough for 2 of us for 3 meals!!  I served it with a small portion of Barilla Plus angel hair pasta and it is a very healthy meal.  This is getting added to the regular rotation!!!
Update: I added some cooked italian turkey sausage (hot) to this...OMG, it was amazing.  I drained off what little fat there was from the sausage so it didn't really add any fat but added great flavor!!  I served it at a dinner party where some people didn't like eggplant but they LOVED this dish.

Five stars if my boyfriend is satisfied (and goes back for seconds) with a vegetarian meal! I did cook the eggplant a bit longer for more browning/crisping action.

Great recipe.  Used fresh basil instead of dried.  Fresh herbs just smell better while cooking.  Also added more cheese but I like my food cheesy.  I saw in other reviews people "sweated" their eggplant with sea salt.  If you bake your pieces long enough, there's no need to.  I sliced mine kind of thick, let 'em bake for 7-8 minutes each side and had NO sogginess or extra water.

I pretty much followed the recipe with one exception, I baked the eggplant on 450 degrees for about 5 minutes per side.  Then of course put it all together in my pan and baked at 350 for about a half hour.  I only used two large eggplants because three looked like it would be too much.  Two large eggplants was just right for three layers in a 9x13 pan.  I actually had a few sllices left over.  

Yum, this dish was very delicious, we all enjoyed it very much and look forward to the left overs tonight!

I loved this recipe so much. Unfortunately my boyfriend works night and so I had to enjoy it by myself but I will definitely be making it again. I made a much smaller portion, about 4 servings. I sweated the eggplant for about 20 mins, rinsed and dried, dipped in egg and bread crumbs and baked for 10 minutes each side. I cut my eggplant on the thin side and it was perfect with those baking times so if yours is thicker definitely leave it in longer. I also had extra breaded eggplant so I froze it in single layers for another time. This is so easy and delicious!

this was really good! i sweated the eggplant with salt for 30 mins and then rinsed with cold water. i also dipped the slices in flour before the egg and added some extra seasoning to the italian breadcrumbs. i baked the slices for 10 mins on each side before layering and used a mix of mozzarella, cheddar and parm. i forgot to peel and it still tasted great with the peel on. i have never eaten eggplant parmesan before so i dont have much to compare it to, but i thought it was great and will be making again and again! thanks for sharing the recipe

Yum Yum Yum!  Great recipe and made a LOT (my 3 eggplants were kind of large-ish, though).  It took me probably closer to an hour and half with slicing, dipping, and breading all that eggplant but it was WELL WORTH the time and effort.  I used lots of cheese (asiago and provolone as well as the two listed).  Leftovers tasted even better the next day!  Thank you so much for sharing this!

I thought this was pretty good. I changed it a little, I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand so I used corn flakes. I thought although this was good, there was to much sauce. Also I made sure to use the salt method for the eggplant, and I didn't like how it didn't recommend doing this (as without eggplants is very bitter). So although the end taste was good, I had to change to many things to make it a success.

This was a very good dish! Thank you! The only changes i made was the amount of eggplant used (i only cooked this for myself, so i used one eggplant) and the spaghetti sauce (i used a spice pizza sauce out of a pizza kit, which added to the flavor). I was surprised by how good I made this! Im sharing it today with my co-workers! Thanks again!

It turned out pretty tasty. Followed other advice and salted eggplant for about 20 minutes, rinsed in cold water and pat dry. We thought the eggplant would turn out better if you err on the side of thicker slices, maybe 1/2-3/4 inch thick. Also watch the cheese if you bake the dish on the top rack, ours turned out a little brown and crunchy.

I have been trying out cooking as I am getting married soon. I followed the directions pretty much by sweating the eggplant (salting the slices of eggplant for @ 30 min. then rinse to reduce a bitter taste that eggplant has). After that I basically adjusted quantities of mix to amount of slices and it came out extremely good! My fiancee went wild over it. I must admit myself that it is delicious. Take it from someone that is a novice with cooking.  Very good recipe and easy to make! I will definately make this dish for company soon.

Fantastic!  I only gave it 4/5 stars because did modify it, based on other reviews.  I sweated the eggplant for 20 minutes before dredging.  I used panko seasoned with salt, garlic, and italian herbs rather than bread crumbs.  I baked the eggplant 10 min. per side rather than 5.  Two eggplant was more than enough.  My entire family - including my very picky 3-year-old raved about it.  And we had so little guilt with no frying and no meat!

This was fantastic! My husband has been raving about it since I made it (and I'm really not a very good cook). I sort of followed the recipe.. I made a couple of exceptions. I sauted mushrooms iwith garlic and a little butter and then layered it over the eggplant. I also made a meat version since my husband is a vegetarian and I am not. I added hamburger to one. I didn't salt the eggplant and leat sweat.. I forgot. You couldn't tell. It was really delicious. I was suprised, I was very hesitant of eggplant and hadn't ever had a good dish with it. This was super delicious and will now be a staple in our house. I did end up cooking the eggplant for about 10 min each side.

this was an awesome recipe.. i dont feel guilty eating a lot of this =]. i made it a little different though, using different tactics from several users. I cut the eggplant in about 1/4inch slices but will make it a little thicker next time so i can taste the eggplant more (personal preference) . I did sweat it by just sprinkling some sea salt but i only let it sit about 10-15 minutes because i was low on time. I then baked the eggplant at 450 degrees , 7-10 minutes each side. My layering technique was spaghetti suace on botton, eggplant, mozzarella, parmesan, sauce, eggplant mozzarella.. etc, ending with sauce and cheese at the end.  I baked for 30 minutes and then broiled for another 2-3 minutes because I love my cheese a little crispy. The eggplant came out perfect and was tender when the final product was complete. my BF and his roommates loved it and couldnt believe it was vegetarian =) serve with yummy garlic bread!

I made that last night and it was delicious! I did what other reviewers suggested and put a little kosher salt on the slices in a colander for about 15 min to draw out the bitterness, then quickly rinsed and patted dry before breading them. The baking idea instead of frying was great - the slices were not greasy at all. I made a quick sauce by browning some sweet italien sausage with some chopped onion and garlic, then adding tomato sauce, italien seasoning and a bit of sugar. I let that simmer while the eggplant was baking/browning, then layered the casserole. I will be making this again.

SOOOO very good. This recipe is time comsuming but worth the effort. I sweated the eggplant by salting them for 30 min and then rinsing and patting dry. I cut my slices really thick so I upped the oven temp to 425 and cooked slices on each side for 10 min. I still ended up having to broil them to get them crispy. OH--and I also added some panko bread crumbs to the mix..not recommended. If you have the time, make sure to dip and dredge the eggplant twice to get more breading. Also, this dish DOES NOT reheat well so eat all of it the same day you make it!

I love eggplant parmesan but have stayed away from it because of the fat content.  But this is the best lo-fat version ever and I loved it.  I used other's suggestions and sweated the eggplant; also baked it longer and hotter.  I used part skim mozzarella and a little less sauce.  The results were fabulous - I have made it several times since and my family asks for it all the time!

This is an excellent recipe! Make sure you bake eggplant slices 10 minutes per side and follow the rest of the instructions, you will end up with a restaurant-quality dish that has great flavor. I highly recomend this recipe and would encourage both meat lovers and vegetarians to give it a try.

This was great - I made it the day before as several other people had commented it was better the next day.  All I had to do was heat it up.  I used jar sauce, but I don't think it made much of a difference. Not difficult to do, but 3/4 of an eggplant was more than enough for two people.  Additionally, I also cooked it on 10 mins each side at about 375 - 400 instead of 5 mins.

I was hesitant to try this recipie, since I've never liked anyone else's eggplant parmesan, but this was WONDERFUL!  So easy!  And I love the fact that the eggplant is baked instead of fried.  I did follow the suggestion of others and bake the eggplant a little longer - about ten minutes on each side - and it was perfect.  I've spoken to a few friends who've tried to cook eggplant in the past, and the secret really is to sweat the eggplant first.  I now make this easy recipe at least once a month!

Tastes are quite good in this recipe, but you may want to bake the eggplant a little longer than ten minutes.  We found the eggplant, even at 1/4" thick slices, was not consistently cooked at five minutes on each side.  Other than that, it's an excellent recipe!

EXCELLENT!!!  Hubby LOVED it!!!  Used 2 good size eggplants.   I did sweat them as suggested & rinsed well & dried.  Also baked on each side about 10 min to get golden & a little crisp.

Nice recipe. The taste is good, and my husband loves it a lot. I feel I should've baked the eggplants a bit longer than 5 minutes on each side, because some of them ended up being "raw" even after all that baking at the end. 
I would definitely use much less bread crumbs too, like 3 or even 2 cups instead of 4. I ended up throwing almost half of the amount because I wasn't able to use it again (got a lot of beaten egg mixed into the whole amount).

Turned out wonderful! Did salt, rinse and dry eggplant. Baked eggplant on cookie sheet for 10 mins on each side and think I would've done it even longer. All the added advice was very useful in making this and I will make it again!

This is SO good! We have 3 people in our household so I only used one eggplant because even two would have been way too much. It came out amazing though. With one eggplant we had enough leftovers for the next day! It was so good!! Thank you!

My kids thought this would be disgusting, but they gobbled it all up and loved it!  I did cut the eggplant down to two, the third one wouldn't fit (either use small eggplants or not so much).

Very delicious and easy to make! The parchment paper very essential to flipping the eggplant over without sticking. I'm learning something new every time. Thank you for this recipe!

I just made this tonight and it was great!  I cut the recipe in half to feed my family of five and it was perfect.  I also cooked some spaghetti and put eggplant with the sauce on top.  The whole family loved it!

I'll never, EVER bake eggplant for eggplant parm again.  I tried this hoping it would taste the same, as everyone else suggested it would.  But they lied!  It tastes terrible! Fried eggplant is the only way to go!

Took some tips from another reviewer and sweat the eggplant first by peeling, slicing and sprinkling with coarse salt and let sit for a half hour. Rinse well and dry. Then dip in egg and then into seasoned crumbs. To give it a little extra crunch I replaced half the bread crumbs with panko and added some extra Italian seasoning and a little garlic powder. Baked for 7 minutes per side at 450 and then followed the rest of the recipe and it was the best Eggplant Parmesan any of us had ever had. All 7 kids loved it and my sister who hates eggplant even loved it! Definite keeper!

This turned out better than expected....even my picky boyfriend liked it.  I peeled and sliced thinly and let the eggplant sweat.  Rinsed and patted dry.  Dredge in flour(I added in salt, pepper, and italian seasoning) , egg white, then panko bread crumbs.  I put the eggplant on a oiled baking sheet and sprayed tops with cooking spray.  Baked 10 minutes each side at 350 then up to 400 and baked 15 more minutes. In a baking dish I layered cooked pasta, spaghetti sauce, eggplant, cheese, sauce, and topped with more mozzarella cheese. Baked until cheese melted.  Delicious

This is my first review ever I'm writing one because I decided to make this meal for meatless Mondays. My husband and sister insisted that they didn't want to eat this. I had had it once but never made it myself. So here goes I let the eggplant sweat for about 40 minutes I then used an egg wash and breaded them with Progresso Italian breadcrumbs. I put some e.v.o.o. on a cookie sheet and baked each side for 10 minutes. I served it along with some thin spaghetti. It was delicious and my husband and sister ate it all up. I will most definitely  make this again.

I have been making eggplant parmesan in a casserole dish and layering with sauce and cheese for years, but lately, using this recipe, I take a medium eggplant, sliced about 1/2 inch thick, sprinkle both sides with garlic powder, italian seasoning, coarse ground black pepper and seasoned salt lightly. I dip each slice in 1/4c egg substitute and 1 egg white, then coat with italian seasoned bread crumbs to which I add about 1/4c grated parmesan cheese.  I spray a baking sheet with canola spray, put the slices on it and spray the top of the slices with more canola spray.  I bake it for about 20 minutes in a 425 degree oven, flipping over half way through. Then I take it and cut it in pieces and dip it in either hot marinara sauce or light ranch dressing, absolutely delicious.  It is like going out to restaurant and eating breaded vegetables as an appetizer.  Just my take on this and it is much lower in fat and good for you too!  I love this stuff!!!!

I made half this recipe for just DH and me. I read lots of reviews before making it but didn't change it drastically! I did cut the eggplant into 1/4" slices and sweat them with salt in a colander for 30 minutes before baking. I baked for ten minutes per side at 350. I didn't have Italian breadcrumbs so I made my own using Panko breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, oregeno, salt and pepper. I think it turned out great although next time I will try to make sure I have Italian breadcrumbs to cut down on the work! ;o) I had fresh mozzarella and minced fresh basil that needed to be used so I'm sure that added another dimension of flavor! One last thing, don't skimp on the pasta sauce. I know it seems like a lot but it really is the perfect amount. If you use less than the recipe calls for it will probably be dry by the time it is heated through.

Oh Yeah............this was really, really good. The only change I make was adding Provolone cheese along with the mozzarella in the layering......and the added cheese took it over the top. My husband would often order this when we went out.  I've never ordered it, just tasted his and I didn't like it.  And I'd never cooked with egg plant before today.  But we grew it and I did so, knowing that I was going to try making it, because my husband liked it so well.....But me, I didn't know if I would......BUT I DO......GREAT RECIPE,  THANKS. P.S.  Hubby loved it.....He told me he won't have to order this any more when we go out.  LOL.

My first time making eggplant parmesan; it was one of those dishes that seems quite intimidating, but this was so easy.  I loved that it was baked not fried as it is always so heavy at most restaurants.  I did not have breadcrumbs so made my own in the food processor with brown bread and Italian seasoning, and made a quick spaghetti sauce with canned tomatoes, garlic, onion and seasoning.  Delicious and easy; even my preschooler ate it quite happily!

This was great. I took the advice of others and sweat the eggplant for 30 min. I had to use 3 eggs instead of just 2. Other than that, everything else was the same and it was delicious.

First time making or eating eggplant parmesan and we loved this recipe. I needed a heat and serve meal, so I put a layer of saucy penne between two layers of eggplant, cheese and pasta sauce. I want to try the eggplant in sanwiches with sauce and cheese.  It would even be great as an appetizer with a good sauce to dip it in.

Great recipe!! The cook time was perfect. We also added a little bit of ricotta cheese and used fresh basil as toppings before baking in the sauce. Wow! It even tasted amazing as leftovers the following day. I recommend cutting the eggplant into rounds and then in half for easy storing.

This was really good- I sweat the eggplant before cooking and it really helped to take any bitterness away from it.  Next time I may bake the eggplant alone longer to make it crispier and use less sauce so it doesn't get soggy.  I love the no fry variation of one of my favorite dishes!

This was wonderful! I let the eggplant sweat for about 30 minutes as others suggested. I brushed olive oil on each breaded slice before baking at 450 for about 8 minutes each side. I then continued as the recipe said. It was perfectly tender on the inside with crisp coating. Served this with a side of buttered pasta and a simple salad. It was not greasy as other eggplant recipes I have made in the past. No need to look at other recipes, this is the ONE!

This was my first attempt at homemade eggplant parmesan, and i must say, i'm pretty happy in how it turned out. I didn't skin my eggplant and baked longer (10 min for each side) and added onion and garlic. Only downsize was boyfriend wouldn't even try it since he "can't stand the texture of eggplant" but that just means more for me. Will make again.

Simply amazing!! I followed other reviewers' advice and let the eggplant sweat for 30 minutes first. I added 1/4 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumb mix, as well as some garlic powder, rosemary, thyme and oregano spices. (No idea how much, I just sprinkled it in)  I also baked at 450 F for 7 minutes each side. At this point you can do SO MANY THINGS with the sliced, breaded and baked eggplant. (I'm thinking sandwiches, dipping them in marinara sauce, eating plain, etc.) I made this more of an eggplant parm lasagna though by layering the sauce, then the eggplant, then the cheese, three times over. EXCELLENT!! I should note: I used 3 BABY eggplants for this and it was more than enough.

Excellent!  I've tried a few other Eggplant Parm recipes on this site, but this was by far the best.  The only thing I did differently was I sweat the Eggplant prior to breading/baking it.  I sliced my eggplant very very thin, followed the rest of the directions and the end result was DELICIOUS.  From now on this is the only recipe I will use for Eggplant Parm.

Absolutely perfect and authentic. Like other reviewers have suggested, I baked the eggplant (coated with egg and bread crumbs) at 350 for 20 mins each side...u wouldn't want to order these ever again at a restaurant.  Very easy to make and extremely delicious!!!

I don't know what I did wrong, but the eggplant never really cooked.  I cooked the extra time as people stated and sweat the eggplant and baked it for almost an hour.  it was tough.

Wonderful!  I had 2 eggplant from the local farm that I needed to use up.  Peeled and sliced my slices about 1/2 inch thick.  Changes were I dip my slices in a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs/locatelli cheese, and fried in oil instead of baked.  Made a double layer of eggplant in a 9x13 pan (did the sauce and parmesan inbetween layers) and cooked for 30 min - then for another 5 min. i added slices of mozzarella on top (this is the same way i prepare chicken parmesan).  my husband and 2 picky boys ate this right up - the little boys did not even realize they were eating vegetables!  that alone is worth 5 stars to me ;)  thanks for sharing!

A very healthy eggplant dish.  As other readers suggested 3 eggplants are far too many.  I used 2 and 1 zucchini.  adding zucchini to this dish will reduce the saturated fat and some of the sugars making it even better for you. And leave the skin on.  Eggplant skin contains a potent antioxidant 'Nasunin'.  give it a google.

My family loves this recipe - and it's so much healthier than frying as eggplant will soak up a lot of oil.  Also less messy (no oil splattering).  When eggplant is in season or on sale, I do several batches through the baking step, then freeze on cookie sheets.  When frozen, slip into plastic bags and return to freezer.  Next time you want eggplant parm, it'll only take a few minutes.

While making Amy's Garlic Chicken from this website, I was trying to find a new recipe to use the left over egg whites. Well, this recipe was the answer and together, they make a great meal! 1) I salted the eggplant and let it rest for 30 minutes--(I didn't understand the rationale so I Googled it and found out that eggplant soaks up tons of oil unless you salt it. Healthy recipes are always a plus, so I salted it for 30 minutes and then rinsed and dried the eggplant slices.) 2) I made the bread crumbs according to this recipe and dipped the 1/4 inch slices of eggplant in egg whites and then in the crumbs. 3) I cooked the eggplant using NDG42200's advice, 7 minutes on each side, 425 degrees, and on a dark cookie sheet coated with Mazola Pure Canola Oil Spray. 4) I spooned a small amount of spaghetti sauce on top and lightly sprinkled mozarella cheese on top.  Then, I baked it for 5 more minutes until the sauce was heated and the cheese was melted. They looked like a healthy version of bruschetta and tasted great! 5) Although my bread crumbs were Italian seasoned, next time, I would add garlic powder and parsley to the bread crumbs since I liked Amy's Garlic Chicken's bread crumbs better. I love the healthy changes that I made but this recipe gave me an awesome base; thanks for the posting!!!!

I actually made up a receipe similar to this and was surprised too see it online :)
One thing I did was in a skillet cook 1 red onion, 1 green pepper and 1 red pepper with fresh crimini mushrooms. Chop all up into bite size peices and heat at med heat for about 15 min.
Then, oven pan, place eggplant (as recipe says) then a 1/2 layer of veggies from the skillet, cheese, then repeat.
Cook and viola! Your mouth will thank you.
I served this with Uncle Bens rice which I cooked with Knorr Veggie Soup mix (don't forget too add a little bit of extra in with the rice for the soup mix). And I finished it off with a nice side salad with dressing of choice.
For dessert, serve ice cream crepes (already made located in the frozen food section) topped with strawberries in a sauce (sauce for drizzle) and a touch of chocolate whipped cream!

A wonderful meal for everyone to enjoy!!!

We loved the cheese and sauce  BUT..... the eggplant came out very spongy.  I sweated the eggplant too.  Can someone tell me what I did wrong???  I loved the dish but won't make it again until I can figure out what went wrong.   Thanks.

this score is for my own version of this recipe. I have been trying to perfect the "baked" version of this dish for some time, and have finally done it. I peel the eggplant and cut into 1/2 inch circles....followed by 30 minutes of sweating. after rinsing, i dredge in flour, coat in an egg and milk mix, and dredge in bread crumbs "kicked up" with parmesan cheese, pepper, hot pepper flakes, and two cloves of fresh garlic very finely chopped. I preheat oven to 400 degress, and bake on each side for 6 minutes. I then take out eggplant and turn on the broiler to high allowing it a few minutes to sizzle. then, one side hits the broiler on the top rack for 4 minutes. I flip the eggplant and broil for another 3 minutes. I take it out of the oven, cover with mozarella cheese, and broil until bubbly. The eggplant comes out so crunchy and delicious it will blow your mind. I make my own  sauce and stack 3 of the slices on top of each other, and then ladle a scoop of sauce on top just before serving. This prevents it from getting soggy. The garlic adds such a marvelou layer of flavor, and the broiler adds the "you sure this isn't fried?" crunch. it is delicious!

D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!  This is the best eggplant parmesan I have ever eaten.  I used 2 small eggplants, peeled, and sliced very thin.  I didn't salt it as other's wrote and it was just fine.  I followed a lot of the other reviewers' advice to bake the eggplant slices for 10 minutes per side and that was perfect.  This was so much "healthier" because the eggplant was baked and not fried.  When my husband turns to me and says "This is good enough to serve to company", I know I have a winner!!

So delicious!!  I made it two times in one week.  I followed others recommendations and sweat the eggplant for 30 mins first.  I also cranked up the temp to 450 and cooked them for 5 minutes on each side.  We all loved this recipe!

My husband loves this.  Like other suggested, I put salt on the eggplant, let it sit, and then rinsed it before I dipped it in egg whites.  I then baked them for 10 minutes on each side.  One other thing I would change though is taking the pan out of the oven after 25 minutes.  35 minutes was too long and left the cheese almost black.  I’ll definitely make this again.

I thought this was delicious for a no-fry version. Totally guilt-free!
I used 2 large eggplants and it was plenty. I used 2 cups of bread crumbs and 2 eggs. I used a large jar of pasta sauce, surely no more than 2-3 cups and it was also plenty. I added chopped onion & garlic and sliced mushrooms in each layer and topped the whole thing off with fresh, torn basil leaves.
From the directions, it sounded like I should end with a layer of sauce, eggplant, then cheese. I would have put more sauce on top of the eggplant, then the cheese. Would have made that last later more moist. 
Enjoy!

This recipe was even better with a few additions.  I added sliced mushrooms and fresh garlic.  I also used low fat ricotta cheese along with the mozzarella & parmesan.  The eggplant slices needed to be baked at 425--they weren't crisp at 350.  I also lined my baking stone with a small amount of olive oil so the eggplant would brown.

This was just sublime!  So good.  I didn't change much - I did salt and let the bitters drain out and then rinse and squeeze out each slice of peeled eggplant.  I baked my slices at 450 for 15 minutes on each side on a pan sprayed with olive oil.  They were crispy when done and delicious.  This was better than what I've eaten out at a lot of restaurants and now that I can make it healthily at home, I will!  Thank you very much!

This was absolutely delicious! I totally agree- one should bake the eggplant 10 minutes on each side- they just were not done after 5 minutes. Try this recipe! It's wonderful!

like others i let the eggplant sweat for about 30 - 40min.  because i scale down recipes (there are only 2 of us) my quantities are sometimes off.  in this case i didn't have enough eggplant slices to make a complete dish, so i combined penne, tomato sauce (from a jar), crushed garlic & seasonings and used that as a layer in the baking dish.  i then proceeded to follow the recipe, as written.  it turned out great.  very filling with plenty of leftovers.

Used 3 small eggplants and did not need to salt, 1 egg plus a little water, and half of all other ingredients which was just right for a square pyrex.  I followed advice of others and baked eggplants 10 mins each side.  This was so good.  My two kids (2 & 5) dubbed the dish "eggplant pasta."

LOVED this recipe! I only used one eggplant, and had enough for four servings. Had two chicken breasts I needed to get rid of so I used the same method as eggplant and cooked them in a seperate pan. All of it turned out great! I made my own sauce (one from this site) and had to cook the eggplant about 45 min. before it was done. I would also recommend waiting , and putting the top layer of mozz. cheese on toward the end of baking. Thanks for a great dinner Dolores! I'll be adding this my favorites.

This was my first attempt at eggplant parmesan, and it was a winner!  I baked the eggplant on the lowest rack of my oven at 375 degrees for 10 minutes per side and they were browned nicely with no hardness at all.  My children didn't love this but I didn't expect them to.  Hubby and I loved it, and it was so healthy!

My husband finally agreed to do one day a week of meatless meals, and this was our first!  This has set a high standard for future meatless dinners.  I baked the breaded eggplant for only 20 minutes and found it crunchy in a couple of places.  I used egg whites to make it even lower in fat and calories.  Also, I served it on a bed of pasta.  Delish!

I was skeptical...but I was thrilled to prove for myself that baking the eggplant is just as tasty!! Seriously, though! The eggplant soaks up SO much oil when frying, and it takes so much more time. I decided to try this recipe to save on fat and time, and my husband (and guests) gave me a ten. Thank you! I will never fry my eggplant again.  

Just be sure to salt and "sweat" your eggplant slices before breading. Also, I needed to bake for longer on both sides. For me, two eggplants perfectly fill a 9X13 dish. When I used three, I had eggplant coming out of my ears.

This recipe is great for those looking for health-conscious yet tasty meals!  Since it's just myself, I used one eggplant, one jar of sauce (mediterranean style with eggplant and green peppers!), and 1/2 package of reduced-fat mozzarella and found that it was just right.  I had enough leftovers to have it again for dinner and also take it for lunch.  I'm definitely making this again and again!

I could have eaten this eggplant without the sauce and cheese it was cooked so well.  I read other reviews and found this worked best.  Salting and letting the eggplant sweat for at least 30 minutes, rinsing and patting dry completely helped.  I used eggs in a bowl, and mixed the parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs in a bag together which made it very easy to clean up.  I listened to the suggestion of heating the oven to 450 degrees and I did 7 minutes on each side.  I have an electric oven and they came out perfect.  This was so good and I can't wait to make it again.

I used Panko bread crumbs and egg whites so I had to bake the eggplant for 8-10 minutes per side to get them to really stick but it turned out awesome!!! And much healthier than frying!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I thought this was absolutely fantastic! Easy recipe, easy cooking, and tasted delicious. The only thing I would add is that I let the eggplant cook for nine or ten minutes on each side instead of five, and the texture was amazing. Also, to get some of the bitterness out of the eggplant, I let it sit in warm salt water for ten or fifteen minutes. Thank you so much for the recipe, and will do again!

This was good, but as some other reviewers pointed out, the eggplant needed the salt.  I did not listen since I like to try the original recipe first, but will definitely add it next time.

I just fixed this last night just as the recipe directs and found it to be fantastic.  It is easy to prepare. I expect it to be even better reheated.

Made this last night and WOW!  Other than baking my eggplant slices for 10 minutes each side, I followed the directions as written and my husband and I both LOVED it (that's saying something for me who doesn't eat a lot of vegetables)!!

Thin means thin...otherwise won't get done in 35 min. Also I think it is as good as the spaghetti sauce you use, otherwise pretty foolproof. It was tasty, especially since I am eating lighter versions of old standards - but does saccharin really taste like sugar?

I loved this! I Changed it a little by making my own kind of "sauce". I just cut up some tomatoes (any kind will really work but I used some slicing tomatoes this time) and cooked them until the juices ran. Then I added some broccoli that I had previously blanched and diced. The broccoli soaked up some of the juices so I would suggest using more tomatoes that broccoli. Then I added some spices (garlic, onion powder, oregano) and a little sweetener to cut down the acidity. I used that instead of buying sauce. I also cut out the Parmesan cheese. This was also the first time I had prepared eggplant and I was very happy with the results.

It's completely off in both ingredient amounts AND cook times.

First of all, I needed around 1.5 eggplants NOT 3. I literally wasted almost 2 eggplants. Second, baking the eggplant for 10 minutes before adding to the sauce and cheese wasn't nearly enough. It should have been baked for around 30-40 minutes before adding it to the main dish. The recipe says it needs to bake for 35 minutes once with sauce and cheese - I baked it for over 2 hours and the eggplant still wasn't cooked enough.

Anyways, it all turned out ok but the recipe certainly needs some manipulation to come out edible.

Delicious and very easy to make! As other reviewers stated, after peeling and slicing the eggplant...I sprinkled salt and let it sit for a half hour. My family really enjoyed this recipe. I do look forward to making this again!

Great dish.  The first time I made it and everyone could not get enough.  I dipped the eggplant first and then baked it for ten minutes on each side.  Then I did three layers and made sure there was a layer of sauce on top.  Salting the eggplant for 30 minutes and then soaking them in water was essential.  Dry the slices well before baking.

Tastes great, very easy. I did sweat the eggplant first and if you want the eggplant to brown, bake for 5 -10 minutes on each side spray with a spray oil then broil for 2 minutes on each side. Not as healthy as just baking but I do not like pale parmesan of any kind.

Really easy to make and delicious. Follow directions though and resist the urge to leave the skins on. Although it may look prettier with the skins on, the skins make it difficult to cut, serve, and eat.

Excellent! My picky teenager and husband loved it. I did not peel the eggplant, as I like the texture of the cooked skin.  I salted the eggplant first as suggested by other reviewers (sprinkled sea salt over slices, placed in colander for 30 min, rinsed, patted dry with paper towels)and the texture was perfect. I will definitely make this a monthly meal.

Recipe was a little vague.  Only had one large eggplant and it seemed to be plenty.  Only had 2 cups crumbs and it was more than enough.  I tried to cut about 1/4 to 1/2 inch slices and it really needed more time in oven before assembling.  I didn't peel the eggplant and it was fine.  Used Prego with sausage.  Boyfriend liked it and I'll eat anything.  BUT I love eggplant, so I'll make this recipe again cuz it's very simple.

I made this last night and it was delicious.  I was a little short on Mozz cheese so I used a half Ricotta and half Mozz Cheese combo which really worked out great together.  Mixed them together in a bowl before I speed it over the Eggplant.  Quick easy and delicious!

I made this recipe last night and it came out wonderful. I baked the eggplant @ 400 instad of 350 for about 20 minutes. I wanted to make the eggplant soft with almost crispy shell. The eggplant was not soggy at all. I made my sauce with 2 sauteed onions, garlic powder, pepper/salt, and fresh basil. I created my layers as suggested and baked it in the oven on 400 for 25 minutes, then broiled on Hi for a few minutes to brown the top and served it with sub rolls (incase someone felt like a sandwich). It was amazing. Thank you.

I dipped the pieces of eggplant in flour before I dipped them in the egg and then the bread crumbs.  I added salt, pepper, parmesan and garlic to the bread crumbs.  
I also put salt on the eggplant slices for 30 minutes before I breaded them.  They tasted delicious!

This is a great, hearty winter recipe that's a nice alternative to lasagna or stuffed shells. It's easy to make, though a bit time consuming. A few suggestions: 

1) You definitely don't need 3 eggplants - I used 2 and could have gotten away with 1 1/2. 
2) You also don't need as much cheese - about half would have been fine for me, but I guess that depends how much cheese you like. 
3) I sweated the eggplant for 30 minutes beforehand and it seemed to work well. 
4) I also found that the eggplant needed longer cooking time - about 7 minutes per side to get it crispy and fully cooked. 
5) And for best results, you want to slice the eggplant REALLY thinly. The recipe says that, but I didn't take it seriously enough. 

Overall, a very tasty recipe I will make again.

This has become one of my favorite dishes - and I didn't even know I liked eggplant a few years ago!  I salt the eggplant slices for 30 minutes, before starting the rest of the process.  If I have time, I make my own tomato sauce, or if not, I use classico spicy red pepper pasta sauce - I like the little kick it gives :)  I really don't change a thing...it's delicious and my whole family enjoys it...what more can you ask in a recipe!

DELICIOUS! This is what I remember eggplant parmesan to taste like.  Followed the recipe along with these tips from previous reviews: Cut the eggplant in 1/4" slices, sprinkle them with sea salt and let them sweat for approx 30 mins, rinse & pat dry.  I also baked them on parchment at 400 degrees for 10 mins on each side and let me tell you, I'm surprised any made it into the baking dish.  They were crisp & yummy straight out of the oven!  Another tip I have to offer is be mindful of  the size of the eggplant.  I had purchased one good sized eggplant prior to deciding to make a parm with it.  When I saw the recipe called for 3 eggplants I went out and purchased one more. All the eggplants were about the same size. I know I didn't need 3 as there is only 2 of us, but I wanted leftovers to freeze.  Trust me when I say, 2 eggplants were plenty.  I had enough to do 2 layers in a 9 x 13 baking dish, and would have had enough for 3 layers had we not ate them right after they were baked.  Absolutely a keeper!  Thank you Doery!

UPDATE 7/9/12: Thanks to reviewers I got them to be crispy! PERFECTLY crispy. My boyfriend said they were the best eggplant parm he's ever had. Here are the new steps:

1.) Sweat egglants, no need to peel
2.) Used Italian style crispy PANKO crumbs. 
3.) Baked 10 min each side @ 425 degrees on baking sheet sprayed with PAM
4.) Spooned teaspoon of marinara/tomato sauce just over top of each eggplant and sprinkled with, fresh chopped basil and shredded mozarella
5.) Put back in oven and broiled until cheese was bubbly and lightly browned.

I'm telling you, this makes them super crispy. Delicious!
------------------------
My family thought this was great when I cooked it for my sister's b-day but I personally like my Eggplant Parmesean really crispy. I baked 10 min on each side before baking in sauce..but it still was pretty mushy..not sure if it's b/c it's not fried, bathed in sauce or not cooked long enough. I also sweat the slices for 30 min before cooking. 

Will definitely make again though.

SO GOOD!! I made two minor changes: 1. I left out the parmesan cheese to save a little on calories and 2. I threw in cooked chicken breast strips before baking 3. added garlic powder 4. I added dieced fresh tomatoes b/c I needed to use them up. I just finished eating this and I still want more but I am too full. It was really good. 
I didn't bother with salting the eggplant to drain it out. It was a tad bit runny but not bad and to me not worth the extra time.

My first attempt at eggplant and it was really delicious. I followed some other advice and "sweated" the eggplant before I baked it. And even though I rinsed the salt off thoroughly, it made the eggplant far too salty for my tastes. So the next time I make this I'm going to skip that and see how it turns out. Family liked it too and all agreed this is a keeper!

My husband is not a big fan of eggplant, but liked this recipe.  I've always liked the Olive Garden's eggplant parmesan, but I like this recipe much better for lack of the greasy/oily frying residue!

Very good. I wish I could have gotten the eggplant a bit crispier. Perhaps the cook time in the oven needs to be increased.

Very tasty.  My husband and I liked it but the 3 children (ages 16, 14, 10) didn't.  They thought the eggplant was too tough to eat.  I did notice that the middle pieces were more tender than the slices towards the ends.  Also, low fat cheese would be much better because this was covered in so much high calorie cheese that I was a little uncomfortable eating it (we are trying to eat healthier which was why i went with this 'baked' recipe).

Very good! Easy and quick to fix.  I only used one large eggplant for three people and it was more than enough.  I served with whole wheat spaghetti and spinach with cheese sauce. The whole family enjoyed it.

Love this recipe! I sweat the eggplant for ~30mn before baking to get some of the moisture out, but, other than that, I follow the recipe as listed and serve it up with some whole wheat spaghetti.

This is a 10 star recipe. Not only did my husband and I LOVE it like crazy, but neither one of us got indigestion or got sick at night. Italian food, especially heavy ones like fried eggplant, tended to to that to us. But not this time!   This is how I layered everything: sauce, eggplant, cheeses, prosciutto...My husband loves my cooking anyway, but he said he's rarely had better eggplant parm in a restaurant. He just could not stop raving! I sweated the eggplant with sea salt...that helped a lot in flavor.

This recipe was the bomb :) I was unsure of it bc I've never cooked eggplant anything. After the first bite my husband said "You could serve this in a restaurant!" and he was still talking about it the next day. I salted(for only about 10 mins) rinsed & dried per other reviews before breading and baking. Only used egg whites for coating to make it healthier. Baked 10 mins each side per reviews. Only used one eggplant sliced thin unpeeled- about 3 egg whites- cup or so of It. bread crumbs and three cups Muir Glen Garlic spag sauce. Layered per directions and baked 35 mins at 350. Perfect!!! Served with creamed spinach!

This is a good recipe, but I think the step of laying the slices out with salt is important. I did blanch my slices for about 1.5 min. as well. I also had to cook my eggplant slices for 15 minutes on each side to get the crispy crust I was looking for. I did use a seasoned panko crumb, so maybe that takes longer to brown up. Otherwise- It turned out delicious!

I usually don't like eggplant, but I had gotten one through our local food co-op and needed to figure out what to do with it. I found this recipe and gave it a try. Wow! It was fantastic. We did read others reviews and tweaked a few things. For one thing, we sweated the eggplant with salt for 1/2 hour then rinsed it off before using. Then, I baked it for 15 min. on one side, turned it over and cooked for another 10 min. The only other change I can think of was the amount of eggplant we used. She must have had really small eggplants because we only had one large eggplant and it worked fine. It fed our family of 6. :)

For someone (me) who has never even purchased an eggplant, nor cooked one, this was a very tasty dish! I thought I'd give it a try b/c I'm looking for more vegetarian dishes and this had a high rating. My family (even my kids) thought it was very good. The eggplant was cooked well and the overall dish had a great flavor. I took others' recommendations and sweated the eggplant slices with salt, then rinsed and continued with the recipe, following all steps just as written. Very good - will keep this recipe!

Yum!  I did sweat the eggplant with salt first, as suggested by many reviewers.  I added Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs and baked the eggplant on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray.  I had a lot of eggplant on the sheet, so I baked for about 12 minutes, but did not flip them.  The eggplant still seemed to cook through and brown up fine without flipping them.  I used a deep casserole dish, and ended up with three layers of eggplant, sauce and cheese.  Since it was a deeper dish than a 9" x 13" pan, I baked it for 30 minutes with the lid on and another 10 minutes with the lid off so it would brown on top. With the multiple steps, this is definitely a little work, but the final product defintely was worth the effort.  Next time, I will add some spoonfuls of ricotta cheese with the mozzerella layer for a little creaminess.

Loved this, my kids and I especially liked the top eggplants so I think next time I will do just a top layer in a large baking dish.  I did 10 minutes in the oven on each side of the eggplants that were cut very thin and then broiled them until they were golden brown.  I didn't have any problems with bitterness.

As most of the reviews reflected, this recipe is good with modifications.  I took the advice of others and salted (seasoned) my eggplants and rinsed and removed much of the moisture.  I used 1-1/2 of two large eggplants, unskinned--some of it I fried prior to finding this recipe!   To avoid what others were indicating about the excessive bread crumbs, I just sprinkled the bread crumbs onto a large dish and after eggwashing, I just layed them on the bread crumbs, coating both sides; and added more bread crumbs as needed.  I baked the slices at approximately 10-15 minutes on each side and then followed the rest of the recipe with making layers.  When my eggplant parmesan was finished, it tasted great!  By the way, I used a small rounded casserole dish that just made it right for how I wanted to serve.  I could see myself preparing this Eggplant Parmesan II recipe again.

Excellent and easy recipe. (My husband loved it and he's the real cook in the family). I also adjusted it. I peeled the eggplant slices before breading them and baked them for about 30 minutes total at a higher temp, about 400 degrees. I used jar marinara  sauce and added dried basil and oregano to add more flavor. I used an 8 oz. bag of shredded mozzarella and provolone cheese (a two cheese mixture by Shop Rite). It turned out very moist and delicious, no bitterness at all. I used one large eggplant, 1-26 oz jar of sauce, 2 cups plain bread crumbs. It yielded "two dinners" worth, one for tonight and one for tomorrow night.

This was FANTASTIC! My husband raved about it over & over. We had the leftovers re-heated in the oven tonight and it was even better than last night!  I do think it is necessary to salt the eggplant slices and let sweat for 30 mins., then rinse and pat dry. I added sauteed mushrooms and then substituted 1 tablespoon fresh basil for the dried basil since I had some on hand. I also used sliced Provolone cheese in the center layer & then mozzarella on the top. Make sure you use a GOOD quality spaghetti sauce too, as this really makes the flavor of this dish. (I like Mezzetta brand Arrabbiata sauce). This recipe takes some time, but is very well worth it...thanks for sharing this excellent dish!!!

My husband brought home three eggplants; two purple and one white. I was excited to use them all as we hadn't grown them this year in our garden. This recipe is stellar! I particularly loved that the slices were not fried. I didn't peel them as I wanted to see if the colors translated later when it was served. I did salt the slices of eggplant and let them drain for 30 minutes before breading them as my mother-in-law does before she prepares this dish. Next time I might spritz the slices with olive oil before putting them in the oven as it would help them to become golden at 350 and add some Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs. Thank you Doery for sharing your recipe!

This was FANTASTIC and really much better baked than fried. I took a couple of suggestions from other reviews and baked the slices for 10 minutes each side then baked the whole dish covered with foil for about 45 minutes. I meant to uncover the pan the last few minutes but was busy in the garden. I used a 26 oz jar of sauce sparingly for 24 slices of eggplant. Even my picky 9-year old loved it. This goes on the short list of favorites!

This was SO good!! I did sweat the eggplant slices, as others suggested.  It definitely made a difference...no bitterness at all!  I air-baked the slices after breading them at 450 degrees for 10 minutes (didn't bother flipping them since I was air-baking them).  They came out tender and crisp!  Then layered it in the pan with sauce and cheese and baked as directed .  My kids were asking for seconds...they LOVED it!  They thought it was chicken parmesan...they had no clue they were eating a vegetable!

This is the first time I've ever made eggplant parmesan.  This recipe was WONDERFUL!  My husband loved it.  I used fresh basil on every layer--delish!

I used chinese eggplant (less bitter), but a smaller eggplant with fewer seeds, or Japanese eggplant would have been sufficient.  I never would have thought to try this without frying the eggplant, but it's quite good!

I have always made a version of this for my family and we all love it! I first generously salt my eggplant about 1 inch slices, for about 20 minutes then rinse and pat them dry. (to get out the bitterness) I didn't use eggs (we don't eat eggs) I used buttermilk instead. I then fry these in italian breadcrumbs in about a half inch of olive oil-med high heat- for 1 minute on each side (any loger and they will be very very soggy), then follow her directions with your homemade spaghetti sauce and it's perfection. Very hearty and filling!

I loved this dish. I didn't need enough to feed an army, so I cut it way back. I used a 6x9 pyrex dish, and it made enough for 2-3 people when served with pasta. I used 1 medium sized eggplant sliced very thinnly. The thickest slices were maybe 1/4 of an inch thick.  This allowed them to brown nice and crispy after only 7 min. on each side. If like some reviewers you need to cook the eggplant for 20 to 30 min. just to brown it, then it is waaaaay to thick. I used reynolds heavy duty non-stick aluminum foil, so no oil at all was needed. This made 3 layers worth of eggplant. I like cheese, but I wanted to be able to taste the veggie, so between each layer I used one handfull of mozz. cheese, and gave a light sprinkling of mozz and a handfull of grated (not powdered) parmesean cheese to the top.  I also don't like all the additives to most jarred sauces, so I just used my quick basic sauce recipe. 2 cans of regular tomato sauce, 2 tsp of dried oregano, basil, minced onion, and marjoram, 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper, and 2 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar, and let simmer for 20 min. (while the eggplant is baking). This was wonderful, and made enough sauce for the pound of spaghetti pasta I made. In no way was this a bland yucky recipe. I also sweated the eggplant before using it. Not only was it not bitter, it had almost a fresh sweetish taste. WONDERFUL.

Excellent. For two people, the quantities worked out great to have one eggplant, one jar sauce, one package fresh mozzarella (about the size of my fist, sorry don't know the weight); two eggs (could probably get away with one); and about 1.5 cups italian bread crumbs.  So easy!!  I followed other reviews and salted/let sit/rinsed/dried thoroughly the eggplant slices.  Next time I will cut them a little thicker than 1/4". Then I dipped them in the egg, then the crumbs, and baked 10 min each side. Then I poured half the jar of sauce in the glass pan, put on one layer of eggplant, cheese, one more layer sauce, eggplant, cheese, and light sprinkling of parm. It was PERFECT. Next time I will add some parsley. I served over whole wheat linguine with broccoli and garlic bread on the slide. Delicioso!

Suggest broiling breaded eggplant on high for 3 min per side instead of baking - makes for a crispier dish which is what is so delicious about the fried version!

Salt eggplant for 30 minutes then rinse and dry well. Bake at 425 for 7-8 minutes. When assembled, bake for at least 40 minutes and make sure there is sufficient sauce so it doesn't burn.

The flavor was good, but the eggplant was tough.  I cut my slices at about 1/4"; looking back at the other reviews, I think it just needed to bake longer than 5 minutes per side.  I did sweat the slices first, as recommended by many others.  I needed more egg and bread crumbs to coat the slices-and I even used less eggplant than called for.  I think the cooking times and amounts used in this recipe definitely need some tweaking.  Also, since eggplants vary so much in size, weight would be much more helpful than number.

This turned out fantastic! Per some of the other reviews, I salted the eggplant slices and let them sit for about 30 minutes. Then I rinsed and dried them really well before breading. Once breaded, I baked them for 10 minutes on each side.  Really simple recipe and I will be adding it to my rotation!

Very nice - used the salt process mentioned by others to take away the bitterness of eggplant. :) Yum - even my 3.5 year old ate it.

LOVE IT! There is a local farm that makes great eggplant parm and my husband said this was even better than the farm! This is an easy recipe to make ahead of time, just wait until you want to eat to put it in the oven with the sauce and cheese. I sliced the eggplant pretty thinly and laid them out for a while with salt on paper towels for about 1 hour. Then I baked the breaded eggplant for 30 min. Even the kids like it. Will make a double recipe so I can freeze one next time.

This is absolutely decadent. It reminds me of an eggplant parmesan I had in a 5 star Italian restaurant in Highlands, NC. I would suggest cutting back to 4 cups of spaghetti sauce and if you like garlic, add it!! You also can get by using just 2 medium-sized eggplants (and leave the peel on,  it gives it a much better texture). I also used fresh basil which I believe makes a difference. This really is an easy, impressive dish! Will definitely make again and soon!

This was wonderful! My boyfriend (who is a major carnivore!!) couldn't stop praising this recipe! It was delicious! Didn't change a thing about it except for making fresh sauce instead of store-bought. WE'll b making this time and time again! Cheers!

Note: Try making "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this website to go with this dish - very delicious!

Mmm... this recipe is absolutely amazing! I halved the recipe and used 1 large eggplant. As many users stated, this was my first experience cooking with eggplant and I was pleasantly surprised. Tastes like a mix between lasagna and chicken parmesan. 

I cut my eggplant slices about 1/4" inch thick and it worked great. I allowed my slices to sweat (sea salt both sides and sit for 30 min, then wash slices and pat dry) and baked for approximately 8 minutes at 400 degrees before preparing the layers of the dish. 

Slightly time consuming – but very well worth it. Highly recommend for anyone – you won’t be disappointed!

I will definitely make this again; a great recipe. Unlike others, I did not sweat the eggplant and was pleasantly surprised at the result; I don't think the sweating was necessary. I also felt like four cups of breadcrumbs was WAY too much; I'll cut down next time.

Loved it! I used pink eggplant (it's sweeter than the regular one), which eliminated the need for pre-soaking. I coated the slices with a mixture of bread crumbs, grated parmesan cheese, and dry italian seasoning. As suggested by someone else here, I baked the sliced at 425 degrees for 7 and then 5 minutes on each side. It turned out wonderfully - my husband complemented me many times throughout the meal. Since then I've made it several times, and each time it's been a hit!

Made this five times now. Things I've learned: 
Cutting the eggplant across it's circumference to make round pieces is the best way to make the seeds less noticeable.
Sweat the eggplant with salt and place pieces in a colander in a sink.
Rinse VERY thoroughly after sweating. We had salty eggplant once. Wasn't very good.
Put the bread crumbs in a flat bottom dish then press them into the eggplant with a spoon.
Adding a little asiago cheese to the recipe works nicely. 
And most importantly pick a good eggplant (smooth skin, green top) and cook that day. Eggplant does not store well. 
Lastly Red Wine is better than White Wine with this dish.

My first eggplant parmesan and it was very good. I did sweat the eggplant as others suggested. Three eggplants was a lot and I used two 32 oz. cans of spaghetti sauce, same amount of mozerella, but a bit more parmesan cheese, and layered in fresh cilantro and baked in an 11 X 15 glass dish. The eggplant slices did take about 15 minutes to brown in oven. This recipe does take more prep time than most since you need to sweat and pre-brown the eggplant, not something you can whip up after work...save for a weekend meal.

I cut this recipe down using one eggplant.  This made enough for 2 with the baked chicken for the main coarse.  I thought it was pretty good and my husband liked it.  I used my good homemade marinara sauce and next time will cover with foil while baking as we like our cheese unbrowned and well melted on the topping...easy way to make eggplant.

Excellent!  I followed other reviewers advice and baked it at 450 for 7 minutes per side.  I heavily greased the pan with olive oil to make it nice and crispy.  I freeze the slices and use them to make eggplant parm sandwiches!

Very very good.  It took me longer on the prep part as I had to use several cookies sheets to bake the slices.  I followed all other tips to "sweat" the slices, bake 5 minutes on each side at 450 and add a little extra parmesan.  For a meatless meal this was fantastic, even my finicky father liked it.  Will definately make this again.

This was good and it was nice to have a healthier version of this recipe.I gave it a 4 for the following reasons. It had a good taste, we liked it just as much as the fried version. However, I will have to say that it took me longer than the time listed to make the dish, about 30 min. longer. Also, 3 eggplants were too much.I had even sliced them 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. I don't know how everyone else managed, but I had to use just two and it took me two pans to prebake the eggplant slices. I will be making this again, if it turns out better then I will come back to revise my review.

The eggplant never softened with the method recommended in this recipe - just terrible!  I wasted an antire eggplant and all these great ingredients on this terrible recipe.

Great texture for a baked eggplant parm.  I substituted flour for 1/3 of the breadcrumbs. Also added parmesan cheese, basil, and salt to the bread crumb mixture.  Cut the eggplant slices very thin (1/4"?), and baked for 10 minutes at 450 thanks to others' suggestions(5 min's on each side) on an oil-coated baking sheet.  I sprayed the tops with a generous coating of olive oil cooking spray. After baking I formed the eggplant slices into individual serving sized piles on the baking sheet, and covered the piles with sauce and cheese.  I thought that layering the eggplant in a casserole would make them mushy, which would make my boyfriend hate it.  Using my "piles" method, he loved this eggplant parm, which is QUITE an accomplishment! I also "sweated" the eggplant for a couple of hours beforehand.

I don't like eggplant but my wife tells me this recipe is awesome and good for you.  I sliced the eggplant 1/8 to 1/4 inchs thick, salted and let it sweat for 10 minutes between paper towels, then 10 minutes on each side in the oven.

I've always made eggplant parmesan with a recipe that called for frying the eggplant and din't use bread crumbs.  This is SO much better - much less mess and less time.  The bread crumbs add a lot of flavor.  I used a plastic bag to toss the eggplant in the bread crumbs, and it was very quick and easy.  I love eggplant parmesan, and this recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe. A tip for breading eggplant: Use a large bowl to coat the slices with the egg mixture. Then put several at a time in a large plastic ziploc or food storage bag to which the breadcrumbs have been added. Close the bag with your hand at the top and toss the slices around until coated. Remove indv. slices with a fork! I haven't touched food I'm breading in years using this method!

Awesome!  Baked 10 mins per side, as some suggested.  Used 1 jar of sauce and one eggplant in a 9x9 pan, worked out perfect.

Skipped the eggs and the breadcrumbs. Sprinkled eggplant slices with salt and let them sit for 20 minutes to “sweat” out the bitterness; then rinsed them. Brushed the eggplant with olive oil and roasted them for 10 minutes on each side until they were soft and brown. Then proceeded with recipe as written.

My boyfriend who is a sworn eggplant hater had seconds. I’ll be making this one again!

YUMMY!  I sweated the eggplant(cut, salt, and let sit until little beads of water form on slices) for 15 minutes, and made my own sauce.  My husband who "hates" eggplant loved this.  Use FRESH basil, and it is even more tasty.

Boy watch out!! This recipie makes a lot of food! It's a good idea to sweat the eggplant before cooking it. And unless you plan on feeding an army, scale the recipe down. You might want to leave the cheese amoount the same no matter what. In my opinion you can never have enough cheese!

This was a great recipe.  I only made one eggplant, but I also made Chicken Parmesan with this recipe.  Before I put the eggplant in the oven though, I did browned each side a little in a pan and then put it in the baking dish.  I didn't have mozzerella cheese on hand like I thought, so instead I layered the eggplant in the baking dish with a slice of Provolone, it was sooo delicious.  I also shredded a bit of Monterey Jack over the top of the last layer of eggplant.  I think the basil added a great touch, I just wish I would have sprinkled it on every layer.  Oh and one more thing, I also sprinkled Tasetefully Simples Garlic Garlic Seasoning, it added a little extra zing.

This was outstanding! I used only two eggplants and I did salt them ahead of time and baked them for 10 minutes, as others suggested.  It was so delicious that I had to put my plate in the dishwasher to keep myself from eating it all. What's more unreal, is that my picky 8 yr old son LOVED this!  He grimaced when I told him what I was making, and he ended up eating three helpings, and asked if he could have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Dolores, I could kiss you!

Great!  I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I seasoned my own breadcrumbs with typical Italian seasonings and some cayenne pepper for an extra kick.  I also found that the slices needed to bake for 10 minutes per side.

A great hit!  Just a wonderful recipe that always pleases everyone.

I generally use homemade breadcrumbs with herbs and find the coated eggplant needs to bake at 10 minutes per side. I also use the spray olive oil on the slices prior to baking.  You really get a wonderful flavor without all the oil and fat.

This was very good.  I sweated the eggplant but I think I sliced my eggplant too thin.  Slicing the eggplant 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch might work better.  The quality of flavors was mouth watering. If my eggplant would have been thicker, this would have definately been all-star restaurant quality!

This was ok.  I think cut my eggplant too thin as it seemed to lose its flavor in the breading.  I tried it again cutting  the eggplant thicker and it came out terrific.  It really does cook down during the baking process.  I always shy away from eggplant parm because of the high-fat frying process. I use this method now.

This was so easy! I'm a hopeless cook so I was worried that I would somehow mess this up, but it came out perfect! We had it over linguini. Next time I will try the tips from other reviewers and "sweat" the eggplant. The recipe wasn't clear about putting the tomato sauce in between the layers, but when I clicked the video link it said "layered sauce, eggplant, and cheese" so I got that. Never ate or cooked with eggplant before, but it was delicious! I cut this recipe down to a third since it's just two of us, and we ended up with seven servings of baked eggplant.

Okay, I admit that I followed some other peoples' suggestions as I have never cooked eggplant before.  I do enjoy it however, and everyone in the house (including the fussy eater) enjoyed this very much.  Unfortunately, I thought to take a photo after we ate, when there was nothing left.  Bummer, I'll just have to make it again.  :)

This is excellent and so much easier than frying.  Maybe fresh eggplant from my garden made it so good.  I did make my own fresh bread crumbs, adding some Italian seasoning.  I baked my eggplant more like 15 minutes on each side to get them nice and crispy.  I also used my fresh basil instead of dried.  Thank you for sharing your recipe DOERY.

Excellent but ALWAYS peel the eggplant, soak eggplant covered with cold water with (2 TBSP salt) 15 min. and dry. That way you will never get a bitter taste ever. You may be lucky and not get a bitter eggplant but the one time you ruin all that effort, you will forever soak it! There is nothing appealing about eggplant skin,imho. I prefer fried, who doesn't, but this is a great way to keep down the fat content and much faster! Thanks for sharing this great recipe. For the poster who wanted to prepare ahead, it works great, but better still is to bake and reheat for great "next day" flavor.

This dish is very good, and this is coming from someone who likes eggplant but does not love it.  I agree that 3 eggplants are too much because your typical eggplant is fairly large.  You will get a huge dish out of it and it will still be delicious, but it will require extra eggs, breadcrumbs and prep time with the breading and baking.  Next time I will use 2 medium eggplants instead.

Let my boyfriend make it, and just make sure you cut the eggplant really thin. He did not listen to that and it would have been so much better if he had... Will try it again, but I will make it.

Caveats : oven at 450 for me, and light drizzle of evoo on the sheet when doing the initial bake. 

Otherwise, almost impossible to mess up, even with four other people in the kitchen.

Don't know if this was a typo but I layered it with a little sauce at the bottom of the dish then added eggplant, sauce layer, cheese and then repeated. I left the peel on and cooked a bit longer. Leaving the peel on is more nutritious but it can cause bitterness if the eggplant isn't as fresh as it could be. Just an fyi.

I use a heart healthy, low-sugar sauce for mine. I love fresh spinach in tomato-based dishes so also add that as a bed for the eggplant to make it into a florentini. My family consists of 4 meat-loving males and myself. I have been introducing them to more vegetarian meals, and this is one of their favorites. Eggplant has a meaty texture that they have taken well to. My sons friends seem to come around more for dinner.....hmmm....

Amazing recipe! I made a nice marinara sauce instead of using store bought spaghetti sauce. I did not sweat the eggplants but I did bake them 10 minutes on each side at 450F. I did flour the slices before putting them in the egg wash and I use a mix of oatmeal flour, Parmesan, Italian seasonings and salt instead of bread crumbs. Will definitely be added to my favorite recipes!

I did the sweating, baked at 7 min each side at 450, Put in casserole and baked.  Oh my it was good.  First time with eggplant.  Even my kids liked it and they saw it when I was making it which usually is an immediate yuck. My 14 year old, who asked who had asked if I had a back up plan, had 2 servings.

This recipe was a complete success! Everyone loved it. I had to pre-bake my eggplant longer than 5 min each side as directed. I did 15 minutes on each side because my eggplants were cold, right out of the refrigerator. But other than that I followed the directions exactly and I'm really happy with this recipe and I will make it again.

Terrible!  The eggplant slices were barely cooked and it just didn't come together.  Only after I made this disaster did I come upon some of the comments that suggested to cook the eggplant slices longer and raise the temperature of the over before baking.

I never really liked eggplant until now and this recipe did the trick.  I used plain bread crumbs, added cooked turkey, pared the recipe in half, and used a sauce already enhanced with basil.  No additional salt is necessary as the crumbs, sauce, and cheese offer enough salt for those of us who may be salt-sensitive.  Easy to make and good the second day too.

Very tasty! The recipe is very good as it is written. Even better with the changes suggested by previous reviewers to toast the eggplant for 10 min. per side before layering in casserole. I added 3 cups of chopped fresh spinach and used only 8 oz. of mozzarella cheese. Baked for 35 min at 375 . This was well received at my house with 2 teens.

This was so easy and so delicious.  Even my husband who claims he doesn't like eggplant liked it.  For the tomato sauce we cooked down some yellow, red tomatoes (8 cups), a couple stems of oregano,thyme and onions for about 1.5 hours.  Put some tomato paste in at the end to thicken.  No salt or pepper was added since we have to watch our sodium intake.  I soaked the sliced eggplant in salted water for 30 minutes then drained them between paper towels for another 15 minutes, then egged and breaded them.

Excellent.  My husband refused to try this at first but now he will ask for it.  The only thing I do different is to let my sliced eggplant soak with salt one half hour before I get started.

Made this tonight with a few minor changes. I used Panko crumbs and seasoned it with garlic salt, onion powder, dried thyme, basil, rosemary and black pepper. I used a can of organic diced tomatoes and mixed it in the blender with the same seasonings as the panko crumbs and added some minced garlic. I also layered thinly sliced yellow onion on the eggplant. This came out wonderful even my meat eating husband enjoyed it and my 5 yr old.

I loved this recipe. I followed it to the T except for scaling it down to just 5 servings. I also goofed up by not rinsing off the salt that I'd sprinkled on the eggplant slices (to take away their bitter taste) ... lucky for me, I hadn't sprinkled too much salt. The recipe is also extremely forgiving, because only after I started making this, did I realise that I didn't have any Parmesan cheese at home - I had to make do with just mozzarella, and it was still mouth-wateringly perfect nonetheless! Thank you Doery for this lovely recipe! :D

Mmmmm, good! I did add some garlic powder to the breadcrumbs and it really made a difference. To remove any bitter taste from the eggplant, I salted them after slicing and let sit for 20 minutes, then rinsed, patted dry and continued on with recipe. I also baked the breaded eggplant on a cooling rack placed on a cookie sheet so they would stay crisp on both sides with no need to flip them halfway through. I baked them for 10 minutes at 375 degrees F., then lowered the temp to 350 to finish baking the whole dish. For my sauce I used Prego with mushrooms and added fresh basil from my herb garden. Yum, yum, yum!!!

Great recipe.  Toasted the breadcrumbs to make dry like panko.  I dredged eggplant in egg and bread crumbs then let sit in frig for about an hour before continuing.  Helped the crust stay on the eggplant and kept its crunchy.

Made this recipe a few weeks ago for about 10 people in my family, including kids. Made it exactly according to the recipe and everyone loved it! The only time I know of anyone in my family to eat leftovers. Am making it again for my Dad tonight and can't wait!!!! Thanks so much Doery for this easy, lower calorie, delicious recipe!!!!! BTW I did peel and sweat the eggplant first. Not sure if it's necessary or not, but the outcome was fantastic.

Update: Made it again and it was just as yummy this time! I put the breaded eggplant slices (skipped the parmesan) on top of wire racks set on the baking tray to crisp both sides faster. About 20min total. 
----
I roughly halved the recipe and made it a bit healthier... used 1 large eggplant (I did sweat the slices like the other reviewers said), 1 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs, 2 egg whites. Baked the breaded eggplant at 450 for about 15+ mins each side but that's probably because I sliced it kind of thick. Then layered with 2.5 cups marinara sauce, 8oz of fresh mozzarella, 1/4 cup of pecorino romano and 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese. Topped with fresh basil and chopped green onions. Baked at 350 for 35 mins. SO. GOOD. 

I did leave the casserole in the fridge overnight before baking the next day (because I had too many leftovers already) and I think that really helped blend the flavors together too! I served it over whole wheat spaghetti and creamed spinach on the side.

My version made about 6 servings (1/6th of the 9x13 dish) at only 268 cal/serving!

Tasty without the extra calories from frying. I did place my eggplant in a salt water bath and rinsed well before coating. I also double dipped my eggplant in the egg then bread crumbs. I baked on a rack for about 20 minutes so the bottoms would stay crispy. They would be great alone as a snack or appetizer with marinara sauce.

WOW SUPER FANTASTIC I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!... as far as salting the egg plant... must be a different variety of egg plant because the one I had was not bitter... so I didn't do that... I also sliced mine super this is 5-7  per side was enough but then you also run into the problem of needed more bread crumbs and running out of baking sheet space... I think the happy medium would be a little less what a quarter inch and back them for 7-10 minutes per side... i like it slightly mushy so the thicker ones were good... if you like them crispy then bake them longer... to make this recipe healthier I cut the cheese in half and it was just about perfect for my tastes... great recipe... loved it!!

Yummy! I did not peel the eggplant and used less bread crumbs for just a light breading. Still turned out really good. Even my meatloving husband enjoyed it. I made enough for 2 meals and served it once with penne pasta and once with couscous. Delish!

This recipe took much longer to bake than the recipe stated.  I thought replacing the traditional fried slices with slices baked for 10 minutes was not at all appealing or tasty.  I would not make this again.

Tried this dish tonight and it was FABULOUS!!  I did sweat the eggplant for about 30 minutes before baking.  I served it with a tossed salad and garlic bread.  Sure to be a mainstay in this family!  :)

When I decided to make this, I admit I didn't have the highest of expectations. I was so wrong; this recipe blew my husband and I away! I'm still shocked that something so easy with so few ingredients could be so amazingly delicious. There are only three of us, so I used one eggplant and an 8 oz block of cheese and baked it in a meatloaf pan. I didn't have to glance at the recipe multiple times to make sure I was doing it right; I can't say that about any 1st time recipes! Just bread, bake, layer, and bake. I baked the eggplant for 7 minutes on each side, used the cheapest jar of Kroger Marinara sauce, and it came out absolutely fantastic. I cannot say enough good things about this dish. YOU MUST TRY IT!

Great Recipe, ive made this twice and since then i have changed some things for added flavor. I used a layer of ricotta cheese in the middle for flavor and moisture, instead of dried basil I used freeze dried (or fresh), increase parmesean cheese to about 1-1/2 to 2 cups and use half of it in the breadcrumb mixture as well as some garlic powder in the breadcrumb mixture for more flavor. Yum, was a big hit!

I made this today for 6 adults.  I used 3 eggplants for a total of about 3.5 pounds, unpeeled, and ended with 3 layers in a 9 x 13 glass dish - perfect.  I prepared the eggplant slices last night for quick and easy assembly in the morning, and it really was quick and easy.   I did the salt, rinse and dry, too.  The only thing I will do differently the next time is to raise the oven temperature to 475 to "toast" the slices better as a previous reviewer suggested, and for 7 minutes per side.  Crispier pieces would have defined the layers better and improved the overall texture.  Also, I slice the eggplant at better than  a quarter of an inch.  All that said,  this recipe is wonderful and my guests really enjoyed it.  Served with ziti and salad (wine and Italian bread).  No one had dessert - too full.  Thanks!

Help! I read all of these reviews about "sweating" the eggplant before making this dish.  Sounded like a great idea!  My eggplant parm looked absolutely beautiful when it was done however we could not eat it because it was so salty from the sweating!  (I DID rinse the eggplant after sweating.)  Any guidelines/methods/suggestions?  Thanks so much!   Traci

My husband and I wanted to try new foods. We've never had eggplant and decided to go for it. Not sure if I cut the slices too thinly or if our eggplant was large, but one was enough for two layers. My husband doesn't like tomatoes so we used Alfredo sauce. It was amazing. Definitely making it again.

Wow.  I don't care for many cooked tomato/Italian dishes, but this one won my heart My daughter-in-law said this was the best eggplant parmesan she had ever eaten.  I waited until we had 'leftovers' so that I could comment on them; and the leftovers were equally delicious.  Added to my recipe box, and this is the only variation I will ever use again.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! My boyfriend and I tried making Eggplant Parm for the first time last night and it came out great. I also agree with another reviewer that 3 eggplants are too many, but that is for 10 servings. One large eggplant is plenty for two people. I am now an eggplant fan!

Loved this dish and will make again .. a definite keep for our meatless Monday meals. As with all the others, I salted the eggplant and let it set for a good 30 min then rinsed in cold water and dried before coating in the egg and bread crumbs .. as for the bread crumbs themselves I didn't have any on hand so I made my own with saltine and ritz crackers and seasoned with garlic salt, onion salt, dried basil and oregano. I also made my own sauce with 2 cans of tomato sauce, one can of tomato paste and the same herbs and seasonings I used in the bread crumbs. I let the dish set for a few min before serving. Steamed broccoli and garlic toast were served on the side

I've been making eggplant parm for years, in several variations. This version is very easy to put together, and it sets and serves well. A step that is often missing is dredging the eggplant in salt before cooking: slice the eggplant as you would normally, salt each side and allow to set for 30 minutes, rinse then prepare as usual. It delivers a smooth, richness to the flavor that is unmistakeable.

This was excellent. Baked the eggplant for 20 mins on each side of a foil lined baking sheet sprayed in olive oil. Served over pasta. Would add a bit more tomato sauce - we're sauce people and this didn't have enough for the 2 large eggplants we used.

I salted & "sweated" the eggplant, baked it for 10 minutes a side at 450 on parchment lined baking sheets and used half the cheese and twice the sauce (we're sauce freaks). The recipe was *huge* and my husband ate it for lunch 4 days in a row and I ate it for dinner again. We will make again, but maybe broil the eggplant instead to give a little more crispiness on the outside.

Whole family liked, took other reviewers suggestion and drained the eggplant first.  Put over angel hair pasta in the baking dish with fresh tomatoes and spinach.  Excellent.

Before yesterday, I had never so much as bought an eggplant before - let alone peel and cook one. My result, however, made it seem as though I was a seasoned pro. A truly TRULY delicious recipe and dinner!

I was so worried that this was going to taste awful, but it was delicious.  I did sweat the eggplant for 30 mins and then rinse with water.  I agree with another reviewer that 3 eggplants was way too much.  I ended up using two medium sized eggplants.  I also cooked the eggplant longer 10 minutes on each side.  I will definitely make this again!!

I did this recipe for 5 servings instead and had it as a side dish. It was excellent as is, but I wish I would've read the other reviews first. Next time I will definitely sweat the eggplant slices and bake them at 450 for 7 minutes instead. Also, the eggplant slices really do need the sauce on top, then then the cheese, otherwise they dry out slightly.

This was great! I made a few healthy changes...using egg whites, low fat mozz cheese, and substituting half of the bread crumbs for wheat germ. I also cooked the eggplant longer (8 minutes each side). I haven't been a huge fan of eggplant parm...until now!

My first ever eggplant parm, even cooking w/eggplant. So I made a small 8x8 pan of this using 1 small eggplant cut into 8 equal slices. I seasoned each component (egg, panko, eggplant and each layer). I sweated my eggplant for 30 m ins, rinsed and patted dry then breaded and baked 10 mins/side. I used my own homemade marinara (Mommy? I'm Hungry blog). I baked it covered for 35 mins, then uncovered for 10 more mins. Let it sit for 15 mins then dove in. The eggplant was perfect, had a little density to it so it wasn't real mushy. I like it pretty well, enought that I kept going back for a bite as I was busy in the kitchen. I just don't think my kids or husband would eat this (why I made a smaller portion).

This recipe is a very good starting point, but a few changes improve it:
1. Instead of peeling the eggplant, sprinkle the slices all over with sea salt and put them in a colander in the sink for 30 minutes, then rinse really well, and pat dry.  
2. Shake slices in a bag of flour before dipping in egg to reduce "sponginess".
3. Use egg whites instead of whole eggs
4. Bake 10 minutes each side at 425 F.
5. If you like, you can put precooked pasta (I used penne) with sauce at the bottom of the baking dish before layering the eggplant, sauce, and cheese. 
6. Baking for 25 minutes at 425 F worked well of this deep dish.
This was pretty close to perfect, not bitter, not tough, not spongy, not greasy.

I am eating leftovers right now...yummy! I used 'best marinara sauce yet' from this site and it is the perfect icing on the cake for this recipe. My Italian mother-in-law's advice: Cut the eggplant a bit thinner (mine were about 1/4 inch) and cook a tad bit longer (I did the 35 minutes called for-go 45). A cheap, healthy and truly mouth-watering meal!

I was a little disappointed.  I was looking forward to a no fry recipe, but I think I'm going to have to stick to frying the eggplant before baking.  The flavor of the eggplant was weak.  I also used some Romano cheese and chopped fresh basil in between each layer.  That gave it a bit more flavor.  Next time I will fry each side of the eggplant in a frying pan in olive oil first.

I have never had or made eggplant parmesan so this was a good first time recipe. I didn't care for the taste of the eggplant but my hubby and his mother loved it. I used 1 rather large eggplant for this because it was just the 3 of us eating it. I also read the reviews first and found out you should sweat them first and I did that. I think they eggplant needed to be cooked for a bit longer because they were a bit soggy. I served it with a salad and pasta. I gave my hubbys mother the recipe and she plans to make it again.

I did sweat the eggplant first.
Also, I put foil over the pan for amount 30 minutes in the oven, but took it off at the end to brown the cheese.  3 small eggplant or 2 medium is enough.  I used 3 medium and have enough to make an additional small pan.

Hooray! I have been using a similar recipe for years. But instead of baking I broil on low until browned nicely. I also add a tablespoon of Ricotta in between slices, and I do not peel, as the outer part of the eggplant is full of nutrients - and when cooked right comes out tender. Bon' Apetite

WOW!!  This is the BEST eggplant parm recipe I could find!  My Italian hubby LOVED it, but I just don't make it enough-not sure why because it's amazing!  The first time I made this, I sweat the eggplant.  That was the last time. It comes out better when I don't.  I need to make this again-SOON!!!  =)

Ii just made this and i came out great.  Since the eggplant wasn't fried, it wasn't soggy and mushy.  I also satled the eggplant prior to breading it.  I will be making this again for sure.

very good and easy to make, especially since it was my first time!    DO: salt eggplant and let it sweat for 20 min DO: bake eggplant for 10 min on each side DON'T: use too much eggplant.  I bought too much!

This recipe is outstanding!  Such wonderful comfort food!  I took the advice of others and sweat my eggplant before breading it, however, I didn't rinse off the salt, only patted the eggplant dry on a paper towel.  I also didn't peel my eggplant, since I like the skin, and added sauteed mushrooms between the layers of eggplant, sauce and cheese.  Everything else I followed exactly and it came out superb!  This recipe is definitely going to become a family favorite!

Amazing! I used almond flour to coat my super thin slices (I love my mandolin), and it has to be one of my favorite dishes. More work/planning than what Id normally put in, but since it's baked it didn't feel like I had spent more time in the kitchen than usual. I salted the eggplant for 30 min in a collander and had my almond flour mixture ready in the fridge for any breading needs (love chicken strips(: ) I also used a jar of classico or betollo? i forget. but it was nothing like I had expected, a diffinite keeper. I love this.

Well, I learned two things tonight - making eggplant parmesan is not as difficult as I always thought it to be, and I don't like eggplant parmesan.  I picked up an eggplant at our farmer's market yesterday and have always wanted to try this recipe, so I made it tonight.  While my husband enjoyed it very much, my kids and I did not care for it.  The flavor was very good, but I did not care for the texture of the eggplant.  No fault of the recipe, I just won't be making this one again.

Yum!  I used Paul Newman's Marinara and topped with chopped italian parsley...didn't have fresh basil on hand.  Everyone in my house wants this delicious dish again! Thanks!

This was my first time making eggplant parmesan and I will defintely make it again.  I halfed the recipe but only used 1 eggplant, and that was plenty.  I did use a lot more eggs than called for...I needed 3 when it only called for 1.  I didn't brine my eggplant like others recommended and still thought it tasted fine.  I may try it next time to compare the difference though. Overall it was a really good dish!

Love being able to bake rather than fry which was always a messy job.   If you do not want to salt the eggplant then I suggest you use the small Italilan ones because they are not nearly so bitter.

made this the other day with fresh eggplant from the farmers market.  followed the directions to a "t" except i baked my eggplant 10 minutes on each side and sweated them beforehand.  it was very good, but could have used another 10 minutes total in the oven.  i will definitely make this again!

I used this recipe with zucchini instead of eggplant. It turned out great. I did like another user suggested. I sliced the zucchini, sprinkled it with salt, put it in a coriander, and let it sweat it out for 30 minutes. I then washed them off and dried them. I then followed the recipe exact except put the slices in a 450 degree oven for 7 minutes on each side. It was delicious. Would make a great side dish.

No one in my family liked this.  Flavor okay, texture not so hot.  
Might be better if you cooked the eggplant in the oven with eggs/bread crumbs until eggplant done and crisp, then served with spaghetti sauce and cheese.

Yum...Yum...and...Yummy.  Definitely bake eggplants 10 minutes on each side and spray with olive oil before baking for extra crispy-ness. You can almost serve the coated baked eggplants alone as appetizers. OH, and sweetening the eggplants peices for 30 minutes with sea salt before baking is a must.

What a terrific recipe - it's easy to make and a nice alternative to flying in oil.  I agree that it needs 10 minutes per side in the oven.  I thought 35 minutes was a bit long for baking the completed dish, so I only put it in for 30 minutes, and even that was a bit long for the cheese.  Next time, I would try 25 minutes.

I'm giving this five starts because my husband loved it!  It was the first time I have ever tried eggplant so I don't know how I feel about the vegetable itself - but my husband says it was very good.  I took reviewers suggestions - I peeled the eggplant, cut 1/4" slices and sweated them in a colander for about 25 minutes using sea salt.  I then rinsed the slices and followed the rest of the directions - also adding paremesan cheese to the bread crumb mixture.  I will def. make this again - but maybe split it up - eggplant for hubby - chicken for me!

Awesome recipe! It was very delicious and was a big hit with my meat loving husband.  Simple to prepare (I only needed to use 2 eggplants but  needed 3 eggs).  Will definitely prepare again.

First off I must say that I thought I HATED eggplant. Now I know I just never had it prepared properly and I LOVE it! This recipe completely opened my eyes to eggplant Parmesan! I almost had to force feed this to my husband (he had the same opinion of eggplant to begin with that I did) but after trying he loved it too, even asked if I would make it again soon he liked it so much! I did make some very minor changes by following the recommendations of other reviewers I: let the eggplant sweat for about thirty minutes then rinsed them well, I also used only egg whites to dip into before the bread crumbs and also used seasoned crumbs. I did find that I had to bake my slices for about 10 on each side in order to get them crispy but other than that the rest stayed the same. Great recipe!

I have made several recipes from Allrecipes, but this is the first time that I hae been motivated to leave a review.  This recipe is delicious! I love eggplant parm but have been too intimidated to try it, and this could not have been easier.  Agree with suggestions others have made: salt eggplant for 30 minutes first and rinse, cut down on the egg and breadcrumbs and bake for 10 minutes per side instead of 5. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it is delicious!

This was very good.  I did "double-dip" the slices. egg to very light flour-back to egg then crumbs.  I also used the suggestion to "sweat" w/ salt for 1/2 hour(rinse and pat dry).  Baked in high-450 oven for about 7min each side. The eggplant was not mushy at all.   I only single layered the pan as I so feared it would be mushy (what I remembered of egglpant as a kid).  It was quite good.   We used leftovers for italian sandwiches on toasted rolls.  thank you for sharing. I will try other eggplant recipes based on this one.

This is the best eggplant parmesan recipe I've ever made! The only thing I would change is baking the eggplant slices for 10 min. on each side instead of 5.

Never thought a Baked Eggplant could be so cruchy! This is the only way we'll have Eggplant Parmesan now! Very light and not as heavy. We did change ours a little. We used Panko instead of bread crumbs then after baking the Eggplant we rolled them and stuffed them with ricotta and fresh parsley then topped them with fresh basil. Can't wait to make these again!!

this was really good. we added some fresh basil and loved it.  definitely make sure all slices are thin, some were too thick and crunchy. but that was my fault, not the recipes...

I love eggplant parm and this recipe is great! Like other reviewers, I also slice my eggplant 1/4" thin, sprinkle with sea salt (fine) and let drain in a colander for 1/2 hour to get rid of the bitter juices. I also use egg white only (you don't miss the yolks) and seasoned italian bread crumbs mixed with about 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan to coat. I typically toss crumbs, cheese, and eggplant in a sealed container or bag to coat. Today I ran out of parmesan so I subbed finely ground feta..still tastes great! Also, I bake these slices 7 mins. each side to get them nice and brown with a little crispiness. Taste like fried restaurant eggplant, but it's a lot healthier! LOOOVE This recipe!

This is excellent, but use two eggplant rather than three. (Or maybe Indiana has extra big eggplants).

I just made this tonight and it was great ! I used 1 large and one small eggplant and it made enough for 6 with left overs..very filling. I made my own breadcrumbs and added italian bread dipping seasoning, then after dipping in egg browned at 450 for 7 minutes each side , then followed directions..with a salad and bread this makes for a wonderful meal..better than what I had at the Olive Garden a few weeks ago ! Try IT !

this recipe is used in Eastern Europe for centuries. It's yummy and nutritious in the same time and it teaches kids to experiement with vegetables. I read some of the reviews and someone said about putting the eggplant in salt to take out bitterness and someone did not agree. Well...Personally we cook at least 3 times a week eggplant, and the way my grandmother taught my mom, and my mom taught me eggplants are cut at the bottom and then u take out 4 thin slices of the skin evenly all around the eggplant. You cut it thinly or however the recipe calls for. If you're frying eggplant u either put in in a container with cold water and salt, or let it sit sprinkled with salt in the sink in the container for at least 30-45 mins before using it. then rinse well and pat dry. These methods are used to take out the bitterness of the eggplant so it doesn't interfere with the other herbs we use in our dishes, but the mos imoprtant reason we do this with frying eggplants because it does not soak up a lot of oil. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, and I know from experience you can play with it add anything you want to it and still enjoy a great dinner

Very very delicious, far more delicious than Italian restaurants.. I did it with home made pasta sauce and it turned out great.. Totally agree with increasing the eggplant baking time to 10 mins each side.. Enjoy!

This is a GREAT method to cook eggplant...so much easier and cleaner than frying. I always "tweek" recipes. One thing I did with this one is use about a cup of ricotta, 8 oz. of mozzarella, parmesan and 1 egg mixed together, and make it a middle layer. No salt is added to this mixture, as the seasoned bread crumbs contain enough seasoning. Also, the "sweating" of the eggplant (in previous posts) is a good idea. I like to make my own sauce...delish!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! I have tried a few different versions and this is by far my favorite. I "sweat" the eggplant for about an hour before starting and I think it made it even better. Thanks for a simple but good one!

This was delicious and I will make it again. My husband is not a big fan of Italian food, but we both agreed this was the best eggplant dish (of any variety) that we've ever had. That may not have been due entirely to the recipe, though . . . the eggplant were fresh from our garden, and I made the spaghetti sauce from scratch (with canned tomatoes from last year's garden).

Love this eggplant recipe and as always, it's incredibly helpful to read all of the twists that A/R members have done when making their own versions.  Creamy egg noodles are a perfect companion for this eggplant parmesan dish ~~ Yum!

This is an awesome recipe. I,like others, chose to sweat the eggplant first, and bake longer. I didn't know, however, if it was supposed to be covered in the oven. I chose to spray some foil with non-stick cooking spray and then uncover for the last 10 minutes. Extremely easy for new cooks and very yummy for the more experienced to play with ! Thanks

This was a big hit with all of the eggplant lovers in my family. Even I liked it, and I don't usually enjoy eggplant. The recipe is simple, and the dish is filling, and freezes well, so I usually freeze half of this recipe for another night's dinner.

This was fantastic! I used less eggplant and it was still enough for 2 days! My family really enjoyed this one. I will definitely keep this one on file.

Wow! It was easy to make. And was so delicious! The only thing I didn't have was Mozzarella, so I added some more parmesan instead. I made my own bread crumbs and added spices to them. Even my picky 3 year old son devoured this! Yum!

I scaled this recipe to 3 servings which got me down to one eggplant.  I cooked the eggplant in a 400 degree oven for 7 minutes per side.  I did the eggplant the night before and just stored it in a plastic bag in the fridge until I was ready to layer it with the sauce and cheese.   Very good and easy Eggplant Parmesan recipe.  Even my 21 month old ate it!

This was wonderful! This is the hubby's fav dish and he loved it! Plus it was soo easy! I sliced the eggplant a little too thin I think, next time I will slice it thicker! I did salt it before hand like others suggested and rinsed before breading.

One word: YUMMMMMMY!  I first read some of the others' reviews and adjusted accordingly  First, I made the sauce from scratch using 28 oz can whole peeled tomatos, 2 TBSP tomato paste, 3 garlic cloves, 2 stalks celery, 1 onion, 1 red pepper, (finely chop all the veggies) 2 TBSP fresh parsley (chopped) 1 tsp sugar, 1+ tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp salt and some fresh ground black pepper and about 1 1/4 cups chicken broth.  Saute the onion, red pepper and garlic in about 1 TBSP olive oil about 5 mins.  Add the remaining ingredients and simmer covered over low heat about 20 minutes; remove cover and simmer another 20 mins or so until sauce is thick.  I actually let the sauce sit overnight to meld the flavors.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion to cook slices 10 mins per side and found that to be too much: some of the breading got a bit too brown.  I think 7 mins. is probably about right.  Anyway, I assembled and cooked as directed; used probably 8 oz of the mozzarella; the whole 16 oz would have been too cheesy.  I used all organic ingredients; will make this again....awesome!

I love this recipe.  I make a lot of Italian meals, but this is the first time I've made eggplant parm.  It's so easy and delicious.  I made a smaller batch (since it was for 2) and it was really good.  My husband doesn't even like eggplant and he went back for seconds!  I did use kosher salt on the eggplant first and then rinsed (as suggested).  I also used romano cheese, because it's my favorite.

I used one eggplant and that was plenty for 2.  I would use a whole jar though of sauce the next time because we like more sauce.  I loved being able to bake the eggplant so that way we save on fat by not frying it. I used egg substiute and also baked it at 400 for 10 mins on each side.  I baked it with the chees and sauce on 400 for 20 mins.  It was delicious.

Delicious.  But make sure you bake the eggplant for longer than suggested (I do 15 min per side) to prevent a bitter, uncooked taste.  And adding some more spices does not hurt.

This was delicious and very easy.  Followed the recipe exactly, except that it took 10-15 min. per side to cook the eggplant in the oven and I used fresh mozerella.  Will definately be making it again!

Easy but kind of bland.
Here are some things that I did which made it turn out fantastic. 

I added meatless tofu burger crumbles (cooked seperately first) to the sauce as well as oregano, basil, lots of garlic, chopped onions and green peppers. You can also use ground hamburger meat or ground turkey. 

I added Ricotta cheese and used a 6-cheese Italian blend instead of just mozzarella. 

After coating the eggplant, I sprayed it with non-stick cooking spray and broiled it on low until brown. Then I flipped the slices and did the same thing for the other sides. Turned out really crispy and tasted really sweet. 

It tasted great and even my boyfriend who swore he hated eggplant loved it.

I decided to make this when my brother and my vegetarian sister-in-law came to visit with their new baby a few weeks ago. I followed other reviewer's advice and salted the eggplant after i had peeled and sliced them. I used 4 small eggplant because that's what the store had, and i baked them for longer than instructed, about 10 minutes per side to get them nice and crispy. After layering with cheese and suace, i baked until it turned into a wonderful aroma filled the house. It tasted great, and the texture was phenominal! Thanks for this amazing recipe Doery!

Excellent recipe.  After slicing the eggplant, I laid them out on paper towels and salted the slices to draw out excess water.  Helps eliminate some of the "slimyness" that eggplant is notorious for!

Everybody loved it.  I sweated the eggplant in salt for about 1 hour, rinsed and patted dry.  Drizzled the pan with a little EVOO, and a little on top of each piece as well before placing in a 450 degree oven.  Baked for 7 minutes on each side.  I also added some shaved proscuito when doing the layers. Other than that, I followed the recipe. My Italian husband couldn't stop complimenting the dish.  He said to definately put it on the "do it again list".

I have been making the fried eggplant parmesan version forever, however, it always bothered me how much oil went into the frying process and was absorbed into the eggplant.  After making this baked version of the recipe it is hard to believe I fried in oil all these years.  Not only did it taste the same, but the huge clean up afterwards was eliminated.  I also cut the fat further on this recipe by using fat free mozzarella (mutz, for you Northeasterners). I'll never fy again!!

this dish was amazing. the only thing i did differently was add a layer of spinach. i used a lil olive oil, garlic and onion, then cooked down the spinach, added a few cracks of pepper and salt and put it in between my layers. i did use panko italian seasoned bread crumbs and the results were delicious. the ones made by progressive.... yum. lol i'm still looking for other things to put them on. anyways i used one large eggplant and filled an 8x8 dish. and only baked for 15 minutes at the end plus a quick minute or so under the broiler to brown it up nicely. Once again, it was amazing. Ty for sharing!

I've always fried my eggplant first and then baked w/ sauce and cheese, but never again!! This was fantastic! I would have never guessed that it was baked and not fried- neither would my family.  This was so much easier than frying, also.  I did sprinkle a little olive oil on my pan while I baked the eggplant just so it wouldn't stick.  Delicious- I'm so glad that I tried this recipe!!

this was my first attempt to, 1. cook eggplant and 2. eat eggplant, and same for my husband, and we both ADORE eggplant now. this is a fantastic recipe. The only thing i did differently was to put parm cheese in the bread crumbs. well i also read over the part where I should have peeled the eggplant (OOPS)! It didn't taste any different it was just a bit of a pain to eat the skin was pretty tough! but ya, I will definitely be making this one again!

This came out excellent my very first try.  I had never prepared eggplants & took previous reviewers suggestion & used salt to "sweat" the eggplant.  To do this you simply sprinkle salt on one side of the eggplant and let stand 20-30 minutes.  The eggplant is then rinsed & dried with a paper towel.  This added about 35 minutes to the total prep time.  I increased the baking time to 10 minutes per side. Also my eggplants were quite big so two were plenty. This was so delicious that I will make again.

I halved the recipe and it came out just as good.  I did let the eggplants sweat beforehand as several others suggested.

While I've never been a huge fan of eggplant in the past, I was rather impressed with this recipe while my boyfriend won't stop eating the leftovers. I took the advice of the top rated review (by NDG42200) and didn't have a problem. I didn't end up using a zip lock bag as a bowl worked fine for the breadcrumbs. Also, you only need about 2 cups of breadcrumbs, 2 egg whites (cuts close though), and 2 medium sized eggplants. I prefer covering all of the eggplant pieces with sauce (even on top) because it was easier to eat/cut when it was soft. I served this over angel hair. I will make this again soon!

I cut the eggplant maybe 1/2 inch thick. I would either cook the slices longer, or cut thinner in the future.

Snaps for Dolores! This is a good alternative to frying. My family truly enjoyed it. I baked it 10 min per side and then with sauce and cheese. Eggplant can be bitter and needs a lot of flavor (aka fats) to make it taste good. I wouldn't use egg whites or fat free cheese it just doesn't work well. If you normally fry it this is worth the work to avoid massive amounts of oil and it does taste very good.

Mmmmmm! Love this!! I used only 2 eggplant (skin-on) which I salted, let stand for about 20 minutes and rinsed as per other reviewers suggestion. I've made this 2 times. The first time I fried the eggplant in EVOO, the second time I baked it in the oven. It took closer to 10 min. per side than 5. Both times - incredible! I had only plain breadcrumbs so seasoned those myself with dried oregano, thyme, basil and rosemary. I will make this again and again. Fabulous!

Thank you, thank you!!  I love eggplant parmesan, but my husband thought he hated it.  well, was he ever surprised.  He loved it too!!. I did increase the time to bake the slices and baked them at 400 then turned it down after it was all put together. I decreased the ingredients to make 4 servings.  We'll have the left-overs for lunch tomorrow.

I've never made anything with eggplant before, but the guy I'm dating requested this. I must say, I enjoyed it (and I don't necessarily like eggplant) and it came out a LOT better than my chicken parmesan. I used jarred spaghetti sauce with mushrooms (which was great), a good amount of parmesan cheese, and only needed 2 cups of mozzarella for two layers in a standard-size casserole dish. I probably only needed one medium-sized eggplant. The double-dipping of eggplant in the egg and breadcrumbs was tedious, but worth the effort b/c I saw how much nicer those pieces came out than the ones I only dipped once. I put the eggplant on the baking sheets for 5 minutes on each side at 450 degrees and then baked everything all together for about 35 minutes. I served it with spaghetti noodles and bruschetta. I will definitely make this again, it was great.

I'll give this 5 stars because it was very good BUT I did have to make some changes.  1) I only needed 2 eggplant and about 2 to 3 cups of bread crumbs, 2) I needed about 3 eggs (but then again I had too much eggplant so that is questionable), and 3) I let the eggplant sweat with some sea salt for about an hour and then I rinsed them off and dried them before breading.  Some other helpful hints: 1) I baked my eggplants on wire racks (the kinds I cool cookies on), and 2) I ended up with 2 layers so that should help when attempting to figure out how much to “divide” the “divided” ingredients.

All the cheeses in this recipe is what makes it soo good. I did cook the eggplant for 10 minutes like the others suggested. I used Ragu Olive oil, Garlic, and Tomatoe sauce and its a chunky sauce and that really added nice texture.

This was excellent! I soaked the eggplant in salt for 20 min and then rinsed, to eliminate the bitterness, before breading. I used egg beaters to reduce the fat/calorie content. I also used sauce as my last topping. I served this over angel hair pasta and with garlic bread. Will definitely make again!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I guess I really didn't feel like this was a 5-star recipe. Personally, I think it would have been a bit better if I would have added ground beef. Perhaps I will make it again, but only because my boyfriend liked it!

I am no cook by any means, but I found this recipe easy to do and it turned out so wonderful!  I have no idea what the heck it means to "sweat" the eggplant like other people said.  I did spray olive oil on the baking sheets and baked the eggplant for 10 min. on each side, and I only used 1 giant eggplant.  I fed my mom and brothers and a few friends with one pan.  Everyone agreed that it was great.  Thanks for the recipe.

We found this to be a wonderful way to prepare eggplant. My husband who doesn't like eggplant raved about how good it was. I cut my eggplant very thin, salted it and let it sit for 20 minutes before preparing. In order to get my eggplant crispy like we like it, I glazed a metal pan with olive oil, cooked at the recommended temperature for 10 minutes and then turned the eggplant over and increased the temperature to 400 degrees for another 10 minutes. I also cooked it covered until the last 10 minutes so the cheese didn't burn. We liked this dish very much. Thanks for sharing!

Wow!  I've made this 3 times since finding this gem.  Once was for a meeting my boyfriend had to chef for - he took in a huge pan of it and came home with none.  And he had a couple requests for the recipe.  Regular eggplant parm is so awful for you because the eggplant basically acts like a sponge with the oil, soaking up as much as it can hold - This is an amazing variation that cuts all that fat out.  It doesn't taste exactly like the fried stuff - the eggplant doesn't get as soft - but it's great when you're not willing to give up eating for two days so you can have the real deal.  :o)  Definitely salt the eggplant in a colander, let it sweat for about 20 minutes, and then rinse and dry before continuing on.  It makes the eggplant taste much less bitter.

I used the suggestion from many of the reviews and baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side.  When I flipped the slices over after the first 10 minutes, I drizzled them with a little olive oil, which I think gave the breading a more crispy texture and turned them a nice golden-brown color.  Very tasty and easy to make!  I would definitely make this again.

This recipe seemed fairly simple and quick.  I did make one change, though.  Instead of the "no fry" method, I ended up frying my eggplant slices in olive oil.  I did not like how they did not brown nice or get soft with the oven method.  After this change, the recipe was delicious.  Just like I had at an Italian restaurant.

I absolutely loved this dish! I followed others' suggestions and salted the eggplant for about 20 minutes, and then washed it off, before dipping it in the egg. I also added a layer of chopped spinach. Both things worked great. Two eggplants (1 large, one medium-sized) were more than enough.

My mom always made baked eggplant when I was growing up, so now I find fried versions far too oily.  This recipe is exactly how she used to make it!  Sometimes she'd just bake the eggplant, freeze it plain, and we would add marinara sauce and cheese and microwave for a quick meal.  Egg whites or egg beaters can also replace the whole eggs.

This recipe was delicious, but a lot of work.  I will use less eggplants next time because I had to bake several batches, and it took a long time to get them just right.  It took so long, I had to make something else for dinner, and refrigerate the cooked eggplant slices to finish the recipe the next night.  It was worth the wait, and it was really good.  It tasted exactly the same as fried eggplant.

End result:  Good.  Baking did not affect the texture or dry out the eggplant.  However, if you sweat the eggplant you MUST thoroughly rinse in cold water.  I did not rinse enough and the end result was way too salty.  However, I think the potential is there for a great tasting, healthy meal!

Excellent; this tastes even better than the fried stuff. I found I needed 2 large eggplants and 4 eggs in my case; and also needed to brown the slices a little more than 5 minutes per side to actually get them 'brown'. Makes GREAT leftovers too.

This disappeared from the supper table within minutes (the whole pan!) I told our(4)children to eat it before I would say what it was.  It didn't matter...they loved it! It turned out wonderfully but I only used 1 1/2 eggplants.

This was very tasty but the recipe needed some adjustments: the eggplant should be baked for at least 10 minutes on each side at 400 degrees. I put some canola oil on the baking sheets and heated them up beforehand. With 2 eggplants, I needed 3 eggs, and I used 1-1/2 jars pasta sauce. My children were unaware that I had changed the recipe from the fried version and ate it with gusto.

This was pretty tasty and guilt free (other than the cheese).  I pre-soaked the eggplant with salt per someones suggestion to get rid of bitterness.  I really enjoyed it - thanks for the recipe!

Great!  And for more variety, you can use different flavored sauce!

Delicious! Me and two friends finished the whole dish in one sitting! I fried the eggplants and only egged and breaded them right before putting it in the form! Also skipped the basil, and made the sauce myself using tomato puree spiced with salt, pepper, cumin, rosemary, garlic and a bit of citric acid. Turned out really good

This came out awesome, even my husband who doesn't like eggplant loved it.  I made my own marinara with crushed tomatoes, garlic, oil, salt and sugar. And used gluten free panko.  Had to bake the eggplant a little hotter and longer with a quick broil to brown it, too.

Okay. I had always made this without breading and baking the eggplant. BOY was I WRONG.  I have followed the recipe, including breading and baking eggplant.  I can't believe is this GOOD! I did not need to make any substitutions. LOVE IT!

OMG....over the top delish! Don't bother salting the eggplant as some have suggested and save yourself an unnecessary step.I followed the recipe exactly, used jarred marinara sauce and everything was perfect. Cooked exactly as stated. Some reviewers complained of soggy eggplant. If you don't salt it and use the sauce very sparingly you will have perfect eggplant. I did remove the skins as i have an aversion to them...otherwise followed it EXACTLY...sprinkled a little chopped fresh parsley in bottom of dish and on top. Did not layer all over the dish, just made individual stacks which I think prevents soggy cooking too.

Omg !!!! This was fantastic. I Read alot of reviews first to see what others said  so I will tell you how I made it way better than any restaurant eggplant i have ever had .  I only made enough for my husband and I and our 2 yr old daughter. I bought 1 med sized eggplant and believed that it was the male one i asked the produce guy at Sprouts. I  
1 jar of traditional marina sauce , and 2 eggs , i did blend the italian bread crumbs with some plain panko to give it a crispy texture and also added some garlic powder and sprinkled fresh italian seasoning as well . I baked the eggplant on a cookie sheet sprayed with pam so it would not stick and baked at 425* for 10 min on each side  then followed directions from there on out. I paired it with some spaghetti squash and it was probably one of the best meals i have Made &  my husband is super picky and he even liked it and requested it again:) p.s i did sweat my eggplant first no bitterness at all 5 star recipe in my opinion.

Love this recipe! I usually skip the first 10 minutes in the oven and just put it all together for 45 minutes. Still delicious! Also add Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs. Sometimes I also add mushrooms on top to make it extra decadent. Yum!

This is really good. I've made this before and to brush each slice with olive oil before dredging adds extra flavor.

I've never touched an eggplant before, let alone ate one. A gal from work does bountiful baskets and gave me 2 eggplants. I stumbled across this recipe and boy am I glad I did! It was SOOO darn good! I followed the recipe exactly, except used what cheese I had on hand: 8oz cheddar, little mozzerela, little Monterey Jack, and I shredded some pepper jack from a block of cheese. I also used my homemade canned spaghetti sauce. Mmm mmm mmm! I just became eggplants biggest fan :)

I followed another users suggestions to sweat the eggplant and to bake at 450 for 7minutes each side. Came out super crunchy. I never liked eggplant, but I loved these just out of the oven! Made my own sauce and used a grated parmesan and grated sharp cheddar for the final bake. EVERYONE loved it! I will be making this again!

My husband doesn't like anything "healthy". He thought it was lasagna. My two year old kept calling it Pizza. Very good. I only used one eggplant for my family of 3...I will still have left overs for a week.

I dont like dry eggplant.....If i dont fry, i put olive oil all over the sheet and then bake.  I turn over and drizzle oil on the other side.  This way you get some browning and crispness to the eggplant.  Its like the old way of serving eggplant parm.  Thanks

1. Great concept-looked and smelled wonderful when finished, great texture
2. Learned I HATE eggplant
3. I think if I loved eggplant I would love this dish
4. Spent a lot of effort making this-but didn't eat most of it. Advice:make sure you like eggplant before making this recipe. All the goodness of the other ingredients will not mask the eggplant.

This was my first time making eggplant, and it turned out OK. I had a hard time getting the bread crumbs to stick to the eggplant, and I thought it had a little too much sauce. I realized after the fact that the eggplant was a little bitter, but that I probably picked one that was over ripened. Overall a good recipe, I will make some tweaks next time.

We are vegetarian, but I've never made eggplant Parmesan before. Truth be told, I didn't think I liked it that much. But our CSA gave us 2 eggplant this week, so I figured we'd give it a try! My husband made this according to the recipe except we only used 2 eggplant. We all thought it was delicious! I wouldn't change a thing next time either, and there will be a next time! In fact, I will add this recipe to the rotation! We don't eat a lot of pasta, so we served this with a side of potatoes and a salad (also from our CSA) instead of over pasta. So good!!!!

So easy and delicious. I used 2 medium eggplants, one jar of marinara sauce, one lb of Italian cheese (mix of mozarela, asiago, parmesiano), and fresh basil. It was perfect.

We loved it! We had to use more eggs (6) and sauce, but only two eggplants and not as much of the bread crumbs either. We ended up using fresh basil too. I didn't realize I was out of dried basil.

I liked this dinner which I served with a salad - however I've now learned that my husband hates eggplant....  So, I won't be making it again but it's not because of the recipe quality :-)

AMAZING! The first eggplant from my garden and the best I've ever had. My bf loved it, and he hated eggplant because whenever he tried it, it was slimy and soft. This was firm and so flavorful. My 7-year-old son ate a whole slice before anything else on his plate and then said yummy! I made the recipe exactly as shown, might try the weeping next time to see the difference. I will be making this a lot more!

Soooo good!!!! My husband  and I loved this recipe. I only made a third of it cause I had only one eggplant but it was enough for the both of us to eat for two meals. Only a few changes.  I let my eggplant sit salted for a half hour then rinsed and dried. Cooked about a half of a pound of ground beef to add to the sauce. I didn't have any basil so that was omitted.

Excellent recipe! I always go the unhealthy route and deep fry the eggplant before baking all ingredients and it turns out to be "that much" better. I have yet to hear anyone I know complain about how it tastes...everyone loves it!

recipe called for too much bread crumbs and not enough eggs. browning eggplant for 5 minutes on each side wasn't long enough.

Very good. I did salt and rinse the eggplant first but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. I did add extra herbs ( basil and oregano) and also added 1 cup of ricotta cheese along with the other cheeses. Will make this again.

This recipe is delicious. My husband thinks he has to have meat every day, but he said he didn't miss the meat after eating this dish. Great for when you feel like eating a little lighter. One reviewer said, "Don't bread it; don't bake it; make your own sauce; grill it." I can understand making a few little changes, but if you are going to change the recipe entirely, you should submit that recipe for its own review.

I tried this recipe today and it was a hit. I just added ricotta cheese with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses and mixed in mince garlic to the  sauce, my husband who is so picky with food he loved it. And my 14th months old baby was asking for more. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

I liked how simple this was and how few ingredients it needed.  Took a little longer than 5 mins each side in oven but overall happy with result.

This recipe as written is definitely not quite right in terms of execution.  If you read the comments, you'll see that changes are needed in how the eggplant is prepped, how it's baked, and how the dish is layered in order to get best results.  You need to read and take notes on at least a dozen comments here just to get a decent dish.  For a first-time eggplant parmesan maker like me, it was really difficult trying to figure out whose advice to follow.  My advice is to search around for a recipe that is more helpful exactly as written, without needing a million modifications and input from dozens of other cooks. Next time I will look for a recipe from a pro chef.

Good basic recipe but I still like to fry my eggplant first and the sauce makes this dish. Make sure it's homemade or really good sauce, since I live near Pittsburgh I used Pennsylvania Macaroni brand. Fantastic!

This was very good. Even my children one of whom is picky when it comes to veggies loved it! I did take the advice of baking the eggplants at 450° for seven minutes on both sides, I also added fresh basil and parmesan to the bread crumb mixture. I have never cooked with eggplant before and was surprised at how easy this was. This dish will definitely go into our regular dinner menu.

Great recipe! Making it today for the 2nd time. I am adding shredded chicken to it. I think that the cooking time is off by 30 minutes. I had to place the dish back in the oven for an additional 30 minutes since it was undercooked in my opinion. I read Karen Ayala's review and she stated that her dish was undercooked after 30 minutes and also cooked her dish an additional 30 minutes.

Wow! I consider myself a pretty good cook, and I have made some yummy dinners using this site for recipes, but this one was AWESOME! I was cooking for two, so just used one large eggplant and adjusted the other ingredients as I went (I'm not very good at following recipes...probably why I am a pretty awful baker!)
I used a garlic marinara and a italian herb flavored panko. I'm not sure if the recipe mentioned this, but I sprayed them with an olive oil cooking spray before popping them in the oven, and I think that helped them crisp up a bit. 
Great recipe that I think would please even picky, anti-veggie people. Definitely worth trying!

I made this last night and it was incredible!!! My husband usually prefers chicken parm but he ate this so fast he almost choked! The only thing I had to tweak was the amount of time I baked the eggplant, which worked out to about 7 min on each side, but thats dependent on your oven I think. Also, I did not use parmesan cheese, just mozzarella. The best eggplant parm I've ever had, and that includes restaurants!

I cut this in half, but used two egg (beaters) and only one eggplant. As other reviewers suggested, I "sweated" the eggplant slices first and baked them for 10 minutes on each side, rather than five. This was my first time cooking eggplant, and it was easy and delicious!

This recipe is spot on!  My only concern, is why would anyone peel the eggplant?  The skin will get soft.  As my mother from Italy would say, "All the vitamins are in the skin!!"

I just tasted my version, (only change was skin on) and it is FABULOUS!!!  No need to peel!!! I actually kept the eggplant a little thicker than the recipe.

I had 1 large eggplant that I had picked from the garden and wanted to cook it up before it went bad. That one eggplant made a 13x9 inch baking dish of this recipe. (It was pretty fat though!!) I used oregeno instead of basil because I was out of basil, and I didn't measure the cheese, sauce, or parmesan, I just layered. I also used a combination of italian bread crumbs and parmesan bread crumbs that I mixed together for the coating. Yum!!

First time making this recipe so did not change anything except I never peel my eggplant and I use fresh basil.  This is an excellent dish and was quite easy to make.  My personal preference is Ichiban eggplant for flavor and texture and uniform slices and have never had one taste bitter. In future, when making it again, I will probably use yellow cornmeal in lieu of bread crumbs and add Italian seasoning to the cornmeal.  Yellow cornmeal gives eggplant a much heartier taste whether baked or fried.

I don't like subjective words in a recipe. Thinly sliced- I had no idea how thin that should be so I slivered it.  That was a lesson learned.  I tried to "sweat" the slivers but that was insane.  LOL.   I should have peeled the eggplant but my mom always used the the skin in her dishes.   A LOT of work, part of it my fault.  In the end, it looked and smelled so good and my husband and I liked it.  Only 2 of our 3 children ate it.  I will try this again because it was good but next time,  I WILL FOLLOW THE RECIPE, skip the sea salt recommendation (just peel the eggplant), cut the slices ~1/4 in. thick, and only use 2 smaller eggplants (3 was too much).  Thanks for the recipe.

In the process of making ... 2 eggplants, 2c homemade italian crumbs (1c, 1/2t oregano, paprika), 2c homemade sauce, 3 egg whites (beaten till they looked soapy :D). 375 Thinly sliced must mean 1/4 inch or less.  I did mine thicker so longer baking time.  And if you get any crispiness without pamspraying it, you're better than me.  ;)  Okay, okay so the baked slices weren't too impressive; but once sauced & cheesed up they somehow managed to taste fried - meaning authentic.  Mystery here. The eggplants I used weren't particularly large so I don't think 3 would fit in a 9x13 - especially with the extra sauce & additional cheese.  Well, okay it might; but you'd have a mess in your oven.  :/  :)  For calorie-saving, it's a five star; taste, depends on your sauce & how big an eggplant parmigiana lover you are.  Kids, 13 & 15,  finally tried & didn't go for it.

YUMMY!!!! This was delicious! My picky kiddos ate and loved it. Very simple recipe. I followed it exactly as the recipe said, except I too soaked it in sea salt and rinsed with cold water and towel dried it thoroughly. My hubby suggested I should have done it on Friday since we do not eat any kind of meat on Fridays during Lent season. Also, he suggested I could maybe add some pork sausage to it next time. Thank you for sharing this simple and quick recipe :)

I did not like this recipe. First of all, three eggplants was way too much to fit into a 9x13 baking pan. Two eggs was not enough to bread all these eggplant slices. The baking time for the eggplant slices was more like 8-9 min per side not 5. After baking the dish and letting it sit for 15 mins to set, it still just fell apart into a cheesy goo. It tasted Ok, I was just very disappointed. I would not recommend it.

I love a low fat, healthy recipe....BUT.....I added garlic, basil & tuscan olive oil, with fresh cracked pepper to the foil lined baking sheets, turned the oven to 400 and turned every 5 min or so until crisp on both sides.
I used one jar of Emerils Kicked up Sauce, instead of 6 cups. I added 1/4 package of wheat linguine.

We took the advice salting the eggplant and cooking it for 10 minutes on each side. Also we added peppers, onions and minced garlic to the sauce we layed the eggplant with which really added a amazing flavor to the recipe.

This is an awesome version of Eggplant Parmesan!!  My Italian husband says it is the best he has ever had.  It honestly makes no difference in taste that the eggplant is baked rather than fried.  I made a half-size recipe and it worked well.  I did salt and press the eggplant and I did bake them about twice as long as suggested.  Awesome, awesome!!

Wonderful. I just happened to have some fried up bacon which I tossed in between the layers. Nothing wrong with some bacon;-)   Will make again for sure. I also made my own spaghetti sauce with tomatoes from my garden. Didn't have enough Mozzarella cheese so subbed some 6 cheese Italian blend which I think was fine.

Great! Like other reviewers I baked eggplant on each side x 10 minutes, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Made it for the in-laws with 3 medium sized eggplant from my garden, and it was delicious, with everyone getting seconds, and a few thirds:-)

Deelish! I loved this recipe. I followed the instructions except with less large eggplant (just 1), panko (instead of italian bread crumbs), fresh basil, and I made my own sauce. I also cooked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side because the 5 minutes was not enough time.  I would try it again it was so yummy.  PS: Don't forget to take the skin off the eggplant!

I was some what disappointed with this recipe. I would highly suggest salting (sea or kosher) and laying it out on cooling racks allowing the eggplant to let off its water prior to using this recipe.

For never having had eggplant EVER I was not sure what to expect. However, this turned out good, kids said it was like a "different lasagne" but did not turn up their noses so I mark it as a hit! Next time I think I would add mushrooms though, I'm a fan of mushrooms in dishes like this.

It seems that many are reviewing the baked slices rather than the finished recipe. I made this as written. The baked slices were slightly on the dry side, but plumped up once baked in the sauce. I give this 4 stars based upon ease for a family meal, but not as good as when the slices are "sweated" by salting, resting, rinsing and drying before breading. The final result also depends upon the quality of your tomato sauce. If you choose to salt eggplant (I have done on other recipes), it draws the moisture out (but oddly enough makes it more moist), collapsing the cells & making the eggplant "meatier" and resistant to absorbing excess oil. It is a nice touch if you have the extra time.

This recipe was okay, but I made another on this site today too which was waay better and about as easy: Eggplant with 3 Three Cheeses.  I thought this recipe was bland, and too much dominated by the taste of the spaghetti sauce.  In the other recipe the eggplant is not breaded; instead you brush with olive oil and bake a bit.  While doing so you make a quick, flavorful and easy sauce with vegetables.  We loved it.

Just made this for dinner tonight. Everyone in my family loved it. We made some small changes- we used the salt trick to draw out the bitter juices, we baked the eggplant for 10 minutes each side instead of 5, and we added some garlic to the bread crumbs and over the top of each layer. But it was really easy to make, very good, and good for you!

A friend had a baby, and I made this to take to her and her (vegetarian) husband.  It came out very well.  The biggest hassle was sweating the eggplant.  I don't know if I will do that again.  I will pre-bake the eggplant in the oven so it will be crispy.  It was good--perfect for a mix of people who are vegetarians, and people who like meat.  Eggplant is a "meaty" vegetable!

Oh my this was fantastic!  I salted the eggplant slices prior to breading and baking and upped the bake time to 30 minutes.  Next time I'll up the temp to 375 or 350 as the slices were still a bit soggy for my taste.  The end result is very much like an eggplant lasagna.  It would be great alongside some spaghetti noodles, but the dish is so filling it doesn't need any extra carbs.

Very good. I may try baking without the sauce next time to retain more of the crispness that makes eggplant parmesan so good. The flavors were excellent. I just think it's worth a try to top with sauce after baking.

This was INCREDIBLE!  I don't like eggplant but a neighbor gave us some and I didn't want it to go to waste.  I will eat this eggplant anytime!  I cooked it for two adults, three teens, and three kids under 12.  It was a hit!  I did sweat the eggplant (I had to youtube this as I had never heard of such a thing).  I also rinsed and dried well.  I followed others advice and breaded with some basil and parmesan with the bread crumbs.  There was so much leftover eggplant that we will have it again tomorrow!

Awesome... and so easy.  Do take another reviewer's advice and initially bake the coated eggplant on an olive-oil coated baking sheet (I needed two sheets) at 450 for 7 min. per side.  Then lower the heat to 350,assemble the full dish, and bake until it is bubbly and yummy.  Served over wholewheat spaghetti and with a salad on the side, this was just delicious.  And SO much less oil than if it was fried.

This has great flavor and is pretty easy to make.  Like another reviewer, I salted the egg plant first, dusted with flour before the egg wash, and baked the slices in the oven at 450 degrees, turning once, for about 15-20 min.  Served over angel hair pasta.  It turned out perfect.

Really good recipe! Love the "no fry" option. I made my own bread crumbs out of sprouted wheat bread. Brushed lightly with olive oil, sprinkled with oregano and thyme and let it dry out in the toaster oven for about an hour. I also halved the recipe and it made plenty with leftovers for 3. I used Trader Joe's roasted garlic spaghetti sauce which gave it a nice flavor. Such an easy, delicious version of Eggplant Parmesan!

I thought this was a tasty dish, however it lacked that extra special WOW quality. DO sweat (salt, sit for 20 minutes, rinse, and dry). DO bake for 8-10 minutes on each side.

I followed the recipe exactly and used leftover homemade spaghetti sauce that is my family's favorite and the sauce is the only part they would eat. I've had eggplant parmesan in restaurants but this was nothing like that.

Good, even with almond cheese (for a non-dairy version).  Just make sure the eggplant is truly tender before baking it.

This is a good & simple recipe, and I love that it's baked rather than fried.  The key is the cut the eggplant very thinly, and precook them for 7 min on each side before layering.  I only used 12oz of mozzarella and 1-and-a-half large eggplants, which was plenty for a 9x13 casserole dish.

Made this dish for my family, it was a hit! I've never use eggplant in ANY recipe before...it was simple & delicious! I did let the sliced eggplant "sweat" by sprinkling it with salt & placing it in a strainer for 30 minutes. Will be making again!

Really delicious and really cheesy! I salted the eggplant to let it dry out, but didn't rinse it off and found it to be a touch salty. Next time i would rinse and dry the slices before putting it together.

Amazing! Only changes I made is I used egg whites instead, I used hand tossed mozzarella and extra parm. It's all about the cheese!....we used our family homeade sauce but I'm sure it would be fabulous with a good jar of sauce too. Thank you!

Excellent recipe -- this is the only way I will eat eggplant! Per other reviews, I salted 1/4" slices and let sit for ~30 minutes before patting dry. This improved the texture and removed any bitterness. I cracked some pepper on each side before dipping into the egg (yolks omitted), and used panko rather than standard breadcrumbs for extra crispness. I spritzed each side with olive oil spray and cooked at 400F, 10 minutes per side. I finished them off under the broiler (~3 minutes per side, or until golden brown). I used a garlic and herb spaghetti sauce, preheated, assembled everything in a baking dish, and simply finished under the broiler until the mozzarella was golden and bubbly. The eggplant was cooked to perfection!

Super easy to make and very tasty.  I like that you bake the eggplant instead of frying it.  We have been getting a lot of eggplant in our CSA box lately, and this is a great way to use it all and have leftovers for lunches.

This was a great recipe and very easy to make and prepare.  The flavors were great, but I think when you fry the eggplant rather than bake it, it makes the eggplant taste better, even though it's not as healthy.  Breaded fried eggplant is one of our favorite foods, so maybe we're a bit partial to that. But otherwise, it's a very good dish to make for supper

I sweated the eggplant like others have mentioned.  And I added a homemade sauce with fresh tomatoes sprinkled around the eggplant slices (not on them), this made all the difference.  Even my 3 and 6 year olds ate this up, great recipe!

Very disappointed. I usually love all the recipes I try from here but this one........not so much. Ran out of egg, had lots of leftover breadcrumbs and the eggplant never browned. Oh well, time for the frying pan.

Very easy and it came out delicious!  I sliced the eggplant pretty thin and had no problems with it cooking well.  I used just one eggplant and then guesstimated on adjusting everything else accordingly.

I gobbled this up!  I only made it with one layer.  Not necessary to layer.  Also, left out the mozzarella cheese and basil.  Used just regular bread crumbs.  Sooo delicious!!!!

DELISH!!!  Next time try: dish up angel hair, pour sauce, then fried zucchini, top with cheese.  Would like to keep crispiness of the zucchini.

Wasn't sure I had done this right, but my husband exclaimed at the first bite! When I was making it, he seemed so disappointed there was no meat, but he loved the "eggplant  lasagna". I didn't have any bread crumbs, Italian seasoned or otherwise. I made so with crushed Raisin bran (without the raisins) and crackers to make the crumb mix. Seasoned it with salt, pepper and dried basil. Since I did try to slice the eggplant as thin as I could, the 5 minutes per side was fine. No problems with the eggplant sticking to the pan. I have to admit, this cereal/cracker mix coated a lot better than I expected! I also tried sweating the eggplant with salt as some recipes suggested. I was very happy with the outcome!

Outstanding.  I've always been a little insecure with eggplant, but this turned out great.  I'll make this again with confidence.

My husband does not like eggplant, but he begrudgingly admitted to me today that this is the best eggplant parmesan he's ever had. (win!) I made a couple adjustments: I was out of breadcrumbs so I used 1/2 grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 cornflake crumbles and added a package of dried onion mushroom soup mix and after sweating the eggplant coated them with this mixture. I baked them at 450 for 7 min each side then followed the rest of the directions. I also added baby spinach. Amazing! I halfed the recipe, but it was all gone by mid day the next day. I will absolutely make this one again.

This was really easy and super good.  My first time cooking with eggplant and first time making parmesan anything!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  Only adjustment to make next time would be cooking time, 35 min seemed like a long time @ 350, my cheese was a little too crispy, but still really delish!

Excellent. Takes a little time but it is worth it, and results in a very good main dish for vegetarian meals or a hearty side dish if meat is served.

This recipe is FABULOUS!  The only thing I would do differently next time is choose smaller (or fewer) eggplants.  I had a lot left over.

This recipe is a TOTAL WINNER and will be used again and again and again!  I followed other's suggestions and baked the eggplant longer (12 minutes per side) and used a blend of bread crumbs and parmesean cheese for the eggplant breading - brilliant!  Love, love, love this recipe!

Easy to follow, came out very well, and can be used for veal or chicken.  I seasoned the egg batter as well with garlic, oregano and basil and that added good flavour to it.

this was absolutely delicious, although the eggplant was a bit too firm for my tastes. i would bake the eggplant a bit longer next time - maybe 7 minutes on each side?

I think my opinion of this is based on my cooking mistakes! haha. 1.  I don't think I sliced my eggplant thin enough 2. I should have soaked the eggplant prior to cooking as others have suggested 3. I only used mozzarella cheese, but the parmesan would have added a needed saltiness.  This was my first time cooking eggplant, so thanks for the challenge! :)

This was my first attempt at eggplant parmesan.  I took everyone's advice and salted my slices first, and only used eggwhites.  I used one big eggplant and one jar of sauce in an 8x8 pan - next time, I'll shoot for two medium sized eggplants.  My layers were a bit too thin.  Otherwise, this was a great recipe that is making for some delicious leftovers.

The bf's Jack In the Box loving brother ate TWO servings of this!  TWO!  This guy typically is like a lumber jack (he's a big guy) who loves his meat and usually consumes my vegetarian cooking out of sheer politeness and gratitude that he did not have to drive down the street.  But this was a real winner just as is.

Love this dish and love that it tastes good even w/out any kind of oil or frying.  I used 2 medium sized eggplants and one large jar of sauce and it was enough for 3-4 people.   Made according to recipe other than taking the advice of others and sprinkling w/ salt and letting them sit a minute, then rinsing and patting dry. Great recipe!  Will make again.

This wasn't bad but we found we much prefer our egg plant fried. I did make my own sauce but there are certainly many good jarred ones out there if you're in a hurry. Adding some parm to the bread crumbs makes them even yummier. I've always wanted to try a no fry recipe so this certainly was not a waste of time. It was definitely enjoyed by my family I'll go back to being splattered with oil!  Thank you!

AMAZING!!  I found some eggplant on sale at a local grocer and was looking for an easy eggplant parmesan recipe.  I followed a few notes from other reviews and I only used 2 eggplants.   Otherwise, perfect 5-star recipe.  Thank you sooo  much for posting, you made my families tummy very happy :)

Go no further!  The only thing I did different besides sweat the eggplant is I oven fried it at 425 for 10 minutes on each side (we like it a little more crispy) This is delicious ~ even if you don't like eggplant! Thanks for sharing

I didn't fry my eggplant, I dipped the slices in egg-wash, then flour, then egg-wash and then in bread crumbs but you can skip the flour since you're baking it. This is my first time trying to cook the eggplant without frying it and I must say it's very good. It is a little bit drier than fried but if you drizzle some olive oil on top of the slices before you stick it in the oven it will come out moist like you fried it but without so much fat. So I like the alternative to frying, much healthier for you. I don't use exact measurements, but that's probably because I'm just used to eyeballing it, so I don't expect these measurements to be exact, but they do help someone who is a rookie at cooking.

Okay, this is great food! But be careful! The recipe called for 4 cups of seasoned bread crumbs. I used Panko, which I seasoned myself, and only needed 2 cups! You could find youself witha  couple of cups os extra bread crums and no place to use them.   Also, the recipe didn't call for peeling or salting/rinsing the eggplant first. You don't have to do this if you have small/young eggplant. But eggplant skin can get tough on larger, older eggplants. And big eggplants can hold a lot of water. So make the right choice. I used 3 large eggplants and salted them and rinsed them. Perfect!

Delicious! I added a few thin garlic slices atop of each eggplant slice and sprinkled garlic powder over the whole thing. Also, after eating I realized that some sliced mushrooms would have been amazing in this dish. The only thing that needs to be changed is the eggplant quantity....3 eggplants? Maybe if they are incredibly small. In a 9x13 baking dish, I was only able to use 3/4 of my eggplant. It should just say, "Enough eggplant slices to layer and fill a pan".

A tasty vegetarian dish! Like others suggested, I did sweat the eggplant slices prior to breading. I also found that they needed at least 10min per side to crisp up. (I'm sure it would taste even better fried, but I am willing to sacrifice a bit of taste for my health).

We make this dish often and pretty much follow the recipe exactly. (It does need to cook longer than the recipe states.  Not sure if I slice my pieces thicker than the original cook or what but I usually end up cooking it twice as long!)   The end result is excellent and I love that I don't have to fry the eggplant....makes it easier and healthier too!

This is such a tasty recipe. The first time I made it, I didn't allow myself enough time to bread and bake the eggplant. I only finished half of the slices and had to leave the other half for my husband to finish when he got home from work. He apparently didn't read the recipe, and decided to fry the remaining slices (as well as the ones I'd already baked). Even so, it turned out so well, and we ended up polishing it off in no time. I'm planning on making this again this week with all baked eggplant. Looking forward to it, it really was so good, and I don't think it was just because the eggplant was fried.

This was delicious!  Even my 8 year old loved it.  I made a few of the modifications mentioned by other reviewers: I salted the sliced eggplant and then let it sit for 30 minutes or so before I rinsed and dried it. I then baked the eggplant for ~ 10 minutes per side.

Loved it. I followed the advice of other reviewers. I salted the eggplant and let it sweat first. I also baked the slices longer, about 8-10 minutes per side. I will make this again.

This was a great recipe! I loved how much easier it was to just put the eggplant on a huge baking sheet instead of having to sit there and fry it.  It was delicious and I will definitely be making this again

My family loves this recipe but we have NEVER made it with eggplant!  We substitute zucchini for the eggplant and it is marvelous!  Easy and delicious.  We added sweet Italian sausage to the sauce (we use homemade sauce) the last time we made it and it was that much better.

I reserve 5 stars for the recipes I truly think are phenomenal for any cook. This was delicious and relatively easy, while it did take a long time especially if you sweat the eggplants. I made with the exact incredients listed, however I did sweat the eggplants with kosher salt for 30 minutes and baked them on each side for 7 minutes. I got lazy and only used 1.5 eggplants in the dish, which still turned out to be plenty! Knowing how good it is, I wish I had used all three.

This recipe was fantastic.  I cut the recipe down for 2 servings and it was perfect with some leftovers.  Would definitely make again.  The thing I liked about this recipe the most was that it was baked not fried and you would never know.  Tasted just as good as fried.

very good recipe but I followed everyones suggestions on sweating and I kept the skin on. then after coating with egg and bread crumb mixture, I put them directly into a pan without sauce or cheese and broiled them for about 7 min per side( and sprayed with cooking spray a few times to get them more golden brown and crispy) then I put sauce in pan and layered the eggplant and added cheese. It came out amazing!!!! my fiancee was obsessed!! We are currently eating leftovers for breakfast!!!!!!!! Oh and as for the pasta sauce I did half Prego(with mushrooms) and homemade sauce (sauteed garlic and italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, onion salt, cooking spray and a can of diced tomatoes!! YUM!

Great recipe! I "sweated" the eggplant according to others' directions and placed in two layers, lasagna style, with sauce and cheese between the layers. Despite my having cut the eggplant in extra thin slices (ca. 1/4"), it still could have been crispier. I would definitely bake it 10 min. on each side next time. A little time consuming with the sweating and baking and flipping, otherwise would have been five stars. Might try leftovers as a sandwich on a crusty italian bread.

This was awesome! My family loved it! I only used 1 1/2 medium sized eggplants, but used three small eggs. I baked the eggplant 10mins on each side before layering and did not sweat the eggplant. I will make this again and add fresh basil leaves to the layers next time. =) Yum!!

I liked it very much - but next time will definitely put sauce on top layer of eggplant before the cheese  - the eggplant wasn't as tender on top because there was no sauce (just cheese).

I was kinda hesitant on making this because my husband and my kids are so picky but they LOVED it. There was nothing left at the end. I did sweat them like other people had commented.

Excellent... but I agree that Eggplant needs to be pre-cooked 10 minutes per side instead of 5.  As well, I used some cajun spice in my eggwash and instead of breadcrumbs I substituted Cornmeal.  As well, 1 large eggplant sufficed.

Very good, needs a little crushed red pepper, I like my homemade sauce instead of basic which of course has a bunch of meat and other peppers and spices in it.  I also find the baking step is better done on a broil to get a little more crispness in the outside of the eggplant.  1plant scaled works great for about 3 people.

Would give this 4.5 stars - it was really good.  The right ratio of ingredients seems to be 1 eggplant requires 1 egg, 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, 1/2 jar of pasta sauce, and 3-4 oz cheese.  I made my own Italian seasoning by adding, to each cup of crumbs, 1/2 tsp salt, ground pepper, 3/4 tsp garlic powder,  1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp oregano, fresh chopped parsley, and fresh chopped basil.  I used a blend of mozzarella, provolone, asiago, and romano cheeses.  I sweated 1/4" eggplant slices for 30 mins in salty water, rinsed them, and patted them dry.  I baked them in 450 degrees for 7 mins per side.  Once I assembled the whole dish, I baked it for 29 mins and it was just at the point before burning (maybe next time I will lower to 350 degrees for the full 35 mins or bake at 450 for 25 mins).  However, texturally, there was nice contrast between the top piece of eggplant (really crispy and dried) vs. the bottom pieces (soggy and soft) - we actually liked it that way!  2 eggplants make approx 3 servings and 3.5-4 layers.  It went fast because we really enjoyed it.

Great recipe! I made my own spaghetti sauce, and added spice to regular breadcrumbs to make Italian.  I had a GIANT eggplant, which I used between my boyfriend and I lasted for 3 meals!  I didn't measure the but just did everything by eye.  Also, my store was out of grated mozza so I used fresh mozza and wow was it amazing!  One more praise of this recipe, my boyfriend usually balks at no-meat dinners but he happily ate this, it is very hearty!

Made this tonight and we loved it. I did put the breaded eggplant in the oven a little longer before layering it with the sauce and it became a little crunchier. My 4 1/2 yr old and 1 1/2 yr old loved  it..even had seconds.

This recipe was really easy and really good! I used half the amount of the cheese suggested to make it even healthier and it was still delicious! My friends loved it! I would definitely make this again.

Great dish as is!  Per another reviewer's suggestion I did add an extra step to "sweat" the eggplant before baking it, and I cooked the eggplant at a higher temperature.  I made no changes in ingredients, though.  I thought it was some of the best eggplant parmesan I'd ever had.  Both my husband and I thought it was better than Olive Garden's version.  I really liked that it was baked.  The eggplant itself turned out perfectly crispy and was good enough to eat on its own before all the cheese and spaghetti sauce were added.  Great recipe.

This was absolutely hands down the best eggplant parmesan I have ever eaten.  I love the fact there is no grease so all you taste are the true flavors.  I am out of dried basil so I used fresh and since I love basil, I used 1/3 cup chopped fresh basil, layering it on top of the eggplant and before the sauce. I sweated the eggplant first, peeled it too because I hate the skin.  The baking time of the eggplant itself needs to be increased.  It took me 15 minutes a side to get them crisp but I think that's my oven not the recipe.  I will make this again and again.  I think even my picky family members will enjoy this dish.

I did was some suggested and sweated the eggplant slices in salt. PLEASE be sure to rinse thoroughly afterwards!  They come out almost dehydrated so they did not need to be sliced as thinly as I had.  Next time I will either not sweat them or just slice a little thicker.  Awesome flavor though and I will definitely try again!

I've been looking for an baked eggplant parm recipe for a while and when I saw the reviews I had to try this one. I needed to bake mine for 10 minutes on each side and could have used more sauce but really loved the flavor of this.  I didn't miss the "fried" part at all.  Delish!

Very good. I followed some suggestions - salting the eggplant and then baking the breaded eggplant for 10 minutes on each side. It turns out perfectly every time - even my 9 month old LOVES it.

This was good! I wish I had tried it without sweating the eggplant first to see if that was necessary. It added a lot of time. But the flavor was great! I will make again. The only change (besides sweating the eggplant for 20 minutes) was I cooked the eggplant at 450 degrees 5 minutes on each side, then cooked at 350 for 30 minutes with the cheese/sauce.

This is a wonderful recipe. The eggplant on the top layer stayed crispy, which I have never had happen when using fried eggplant. I used my own homemade marinara sauce, which gave it a little spicy kick. I made this over a week ago and re-heated the frozen leftovers today. Still tastes great!

The eggplant was not completely done.  I expected that there would be some crunch from baking the dipped slices in the oven.  After baking, there was no crunch at all.  Will not make again.

Turned out great.  I had never made eggplant before, and the end result matched restaurant versions of eggplant parmesean.  I did bake mine longer than the recipe indicates though because I like crispy crusts.  In the first step I baked each side for about 8 minutes.  After the sauce was added I am not sure how long extra it baked, probably about 15 minutes, the time it took for me to make up dinner plates of something else for my husband and child who wouldn't touch eggplant with a ten foot pole.

Phenomenal! Just made/ate it on linguini. I didn't salt the eggplant, just peeled it. Added some cayenne pepper and garlic power to the eggs. Baked it a longer. Topped it off with shredded parm/asiago cheese.  What makes this recipe perfect is that the eggplant is baked, not fried.

It's a great-tasting recipe!  How can you go wrong w/ all those wonderful ingredients?  Be forewarned...it certainly is not quick nor easy.  Peeling, slicing, sweating, drying, dipping, breading, baking and then turning the eggplant is so time consuming and the reason why I just order it when I go out!  Is it worth all this effort?  Hmmmmm?

Ever since I had Eggplant Parm from Bertucci's and they don't bread the eggplant, I don't seem to like it breaded anymore.  I also didn't care for the sauce I used.

2 eggplants were plenty- allowing for variation in size. I sliced the eggplant thinly-too thin! wished I had went with about 1/4 inch slices. I baked them for about 5-10  min. at 375. It was quicker! Mine took 4-5 eggs. Good basic recipe.

I really, really liked this! at first, after I baked the zucchini I was thinking it was going to be boring and not good, but once i added the sauce and cheese it turned out really good - especially the next day! I of course, cut the recipe down since i only had one eggplant but I will make this again

Maybe I didn't do something right, but I thought it was a little bland. Perhaps I prefer the lightly fried eggplant instead.

I found that I needed 2 eggs, and twice the amount of breadcrumbs on the recipe. I also used Gluten-Free bread crumbs.  Cooked each side for about 7 minutes a piece.  Easy to make...especially for a beginning cook.  Thank you for sharing.

Super duper fabulous!! I cut the recipe in half as there were only two of us and I'm wishing there were leftovers now! I used whole wheat bread crumbs and seasoned it myself with oregano and basil. The only change I will make next time (besides making more) is to add a little bit of spaghetti sauce on the top pieces of eggplant because they dried out a little during baking.

This was delicious.  I used two jars of ragu and 4 cups of mozzarella cheese.  Pretty much followed the recipe, just added more when i thought it needed it.  Three cookie sheets of sliced and breaded eggplant baked at 400 for 10 minutes on each side.   Looked and cut like lasagna but tasted like yummy eggplant parmesan.  I did not sweat the eggplant.  It did not need it.  You don't need to salt it either.  I oversalted it but it was still the best.  Thanks for a great recipe

Like others I found the recipe proportions a bit off, but adjusting for that, this was a delicious and easy meal. The recipe was scaled for 3- I actually used 2 eggs, and double the amount of breadcrumbs.  Wish I would've had more sauce, too.  Regardless, I will definitely make this, again.  Thank you!

This came out really good but I had some issues with the proportions in this recipe. Try using half the amount of eggplant and twice the amount of sauce and Parmesan cheese.

Very good! I suggest cooking the breaded eggplant for about 10 minutes on each side. I used more sauce than the recipe suggested, more egg, less bread crumbs were necessary and I sprinkled fresh garlic in with the cheeses. The second time I made this I included al dente penne on top of the sauce layers, and it was so much better.

This recipe is amazing.  I followed other's suggestions and sweated the eggplant before cooking and I detected no bitterness.  I also cooked it at a higher temperature - 400 for 14 minutes per side and it was nice and crispy without being burnt.  I've never cooked with eggplant before and was worried when I cut into it and saw seeds, but it didn't seem to affect the taste.  I used Prego Organic basil and tomato sauce to save time rather than making my own sauce.

Great, simple recipe.  Family loved it!  Only thing I added was 1/2 pound of ground turkey (cooked).  I sprinkled it in the middle of it all.  Also added 2 jars of baby food (mixed vegetables) to pasta sauce.  I do this with alot of recipes and your family will never know the difference.  Plus they get extra veggies they didn't even know about.

i thought this was a GREAT recipe...the only changes i made were baking a little longer (approximately 12-15 mins/side)...  like another reviewer i kept the skin on and if you cook it properly there is absolutely no problem eating it, the skin is very tender...i also made my sauce from scratch...now i thought it tasted GREAT but does have a slightly bitter flavor, i actually don't mind it but next time i may sweat the eggplant first...either way i loved it and will definitely make it again!

Great recipe.  I followed some of the reviews and peeled the eggplant and then sweated for 30 min.  Patted dry, dipped in egg, shook in a plastic bag that had seasoned bread crumbs and grated parmesian cheese.  I used mozzarella, a bit of feta and light rigatta cheese.  Baked a bit longer because of all the cheese but even the kids liked it and the eggplant tasted fresh.  Glad I peeled it.

I loved this. I did sprinkle the eggplant with salt and let the pieces sweat for 30 minutes. I thought this was excellent though and definitely something I'll make again.

Delicious. I let the eggplant slices sweat for an hour or so while I bebopped around, then rinsed with cold water, and patted dry thoroughly. I did bake my eggplant for around 9 minutes per side, which was *just right*. I used leftover Spaghetti Sauce II (from AR); this was the perfect second meal for the sauce. Will make again soon, thank you! :)

I scaled this down to one eggplant, though I found I still needed 2 eggs.  Other changes I made include sweating the eggplant with salt, adding just a little fresh grated parmesam cheese to the breadcrumbs, and pre-baking the eggplant for 20 minutes on 400 before adding the sauce and cheese.  It turned out great.

This was the first time I have ever had eggplant Parmesan as well as my first time making it. I did use a couple of the tips from the other reviews.   I used my potato peeler to peel then I cut my eggplant in ¼ inch slices.  I used the sea salt for 20 minutes for removing the bitterness out, then rinsed and patted the eggplant really well.    I mixed up 5 eggs for dipping the eggplant in, and put my Italian bread crumbs in a Ziploc.  This made it much easier and less messy for breading my eggplant.  I baked the first batch of eggplant  for 15 minutes on each side, but it didn’t get as golden brown as I wanted it to, so I pan seared them   and the remaining in extra virgin olive oil.  This gave me the look I was looking for.  I placed them on a baking sheet in the oven at 3500 while I finished searing the remaining pieces (don’t layer them they will get soggy).  I love cheese so I added a two pound bag (32 oz) of shredded mozzarella cheese and 16 oz of shredded Parmesan cheese.  I used 4lb 3 oz jar of Prego Italian Sauce.  I put a light layer in the bottom of my glass pan (my pan is bigger than the 9x13) and layered it like lasagna ending up with cheese on the top, and baked it on the bottom rack at 3500 for the 35 minutes.  Wow!!!!  it was so cheesy and  so delicious.    My family loved it and it made lot we had it for dinner the next day over a bed of pasta.   Oh it was fantastic that way too I’m not sure which way I like better.   This is a killer recipe and definitely wo

I arranged it differently in the 9x13, so it wouldn't be as dry.  And it made SO MUCH, that my husband is bringing some of his friends home for lunch to eat some of the leftovers.  This was very good, and I'll make it again

This is one of our favorite new meals and we have it often.  I use only one eggplant and make it in an 8 X 8 casserole dish until all the cheese is melted and the breaded eggplant is browned a little more.  Definitely use a sauce that you like because it makes a big difference and don't use too much of it or it overtakes the flavor of the eggplant.  Yummy!!!

Very good if you love eggplant! I also found the eggplant was way to much. I only used 2 and it was more then enough! Also I totally agree the eggplant needs to be cooked for a bit more then 5 minutes per side! I did 12 minutes. I also added some parmasean to the bread crumbs! MMmmm

The eggplant in this recipe turns out perfectly.  I used the sauce from another recipe on this site, and my family is still raving about it.  My mom has begged me to teach her how to make this, but I keep telling her she doesn't need teaching because it's so easy.  Once I emailed her the recipe she was shocked at how easy it is.  She thinks I'm tricking her...

My husband - a big guy - loved this recipe...So did I.  I added diced tomatoes to the sauce with fresh basil as well as garlic powder.  I also added additional shredded italian blend cheese during the last 10 minutes so the cheese didn't all get too dried out from 35 minutes of baking.  I served the over creamy polenta with sauteed garlic spinach.  Very "meat" like.  The consistency was also very appealing...Will definitely make again....Super loved that it was baked rather than fried.

I salted the eggplant and dusted it off. Why rinse it with water when the salt is removing the excess water from the vegetable itself? Just resist adding more salt to your sauce. I always leave the skin on since it contains  an "anthocyanin phytonutrient, called nasunin. Nasunin is a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger that has been shown to protect cell membranes from damage". Choose younger, tender eggplants for thinner skin. Also, look for an oval dimple on the bottom (versus round) this type of eggplant has less seeds--or so I've been told.

Pretty good, but not exceptional. I followed the recipe almost exactly as written, my only changes were salting/draining the eggplant in a colander ahead of time and cooking the eggplant for a longer period of time in the oven before assembling the dish (I cooked 10 minutes per side). If I make this again I'll add an additional 8 oz. mozzarella and additional basil. I think the main problem is that this relies heavily on the taste of the tomato sauce and if that taste isn't good the entire dish is very so so. Next time I would definitely make sure to either substitute my own marinara sauce or to buy a very high quality store brand sauce.

I've always made Eggplant Parmesan by frying before baking and found this alternative excellent. I don't think I'll ever make it the other way again. Plus it's less work because I don't have to do batches in my frying pan because largest my pan (13") isn't big enough fry all the eggplant at the same time. Skipping the frying made less mess in the kitchen overall, so I'm pleased with that as well. I did sweat the eggplant with salt before coating and breading and did have to bake it for 10 minutes to get it tender. I did miss the taste of olive oil infused in the fried eggplant, but it wasn't so obviously missing that I could easily get used to this new method.

Made this according to the recipe and my wife and I thought it was terrible.  It was bland, couldn't even really taste the eggplant.  Normally, we love eggplant Parmesan, but normally the eggplant is fried in oil instead of baking.  Guess we will have to stick with the traditional, less healthy way of making this.

This is the best Eggplant Parmesan recipe I have tried. My husband doesn't even like Eggplant, but he loved this. I did as advised by other reviewers and salted then rinsed the eggplant before cooking the oven 10 minutes on each side. Such a great flavor and it's not even fried. I will certainly make this recipe again.

Neither my husband nor I cared for this version. The eggplant turned out bitter, even after 'sweating' it, and for some reason the flavors just did not come together.

YUMMY! Just me and the hubby so I cut it down to 1 eggplant. I salted it, breaded it, and baked it 7 min on each side.  In a 9x9 dish, tossed whole wheat angel hair and spaghetti sauce, top with another layer of sauce and eggplant. Then sprinkled cheeses and basil. Baked for 30 min. Wouldn't change a thing!

Just made this with my boyfriend and it came out fantastic! I cut the recipe into thirds and used one giant eggplant - it was enough for two huge servings. I did what others said to do and salted the eggplant slices (although I didn't have sea salt so just used regular table salt - not sure if it worked as well) then pressed between paper towels. The top layer of eggplant and cheese was perfectly crispy while the bottom layer was gooey delicious. Yum Yum Yum.

This was very good! I baked at 375 for 7 minutes each side, then after adding the sauce and cheese, baked for another 25 minutes. I followed other reviewers and salted and rinsed the eggplant first, and it wasn't bitter at all. Thank you!!

I scaled this down to three servings, and following the other reviewers advice, used more egg and bread crumbs than suggested. I ended up with a ton extra :( However it turned out delicious!! My whole family wanted to try it and we all ended up wanting more!

This was my first time ever having Eggplant Parmesan and also my first time having eggplant. I liked it somewhat but when I was serving it, the eggplant was hard to cut through and made my presentation quiet sloppy due to the fiddling arround trying to get it out. Overall I liked the dish and I let the cheese  on top get crispy. It smelled heavenly.

Superb. I salted the eggplant for 20 minutes and then rinsed with cold water as other reviewers suggested. I used a home-made marinara sauce (from Giada De Laurentiis' Everyday Italian- try it!) and only needed one eggplant to fill an entire 9 X 13 pan. This is better than the restaurant versions I've had. Also used Penzey's pasta sprinkle to season.

I made half the recipe in an 8" square pan and it came out very good. I followed the advice of others and baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side without sweating it first.  Salting the eggplant is not necessary if the eggplant is well cooked.  I didn't measure the amount of spaghetti sauce but I used half a bottle of Prego sauce which was too much--tasted more sauce than eggplant.  But it was still good and I will make this again.

The three of us all thought this was delicious, and it was easy to make. I did sweat the eggplant and I think that helped a lot. Just used jarred sauce (black olive and mushroom), and in the end I wanted one more layer of the dish so I added a layer of sliced tomatoes to the top, turned out very good.
I think this dish would lend itself to almost any sort of veggie being added to it, rather that's' cooked into the sauce or sliced up and layered with the eggplant. Thanks for a great meal.

I found this rather time consuming. It took me longer than 25 minutes to prep. I used 2 eggplants, which were plenty. The 2 eggs were not quite enough to coat the eggplant. I used 3 cups of bread crumbs rather than 4 and still had some left over. Make sure you have at least 3 baking sheets as my 2 sliced eggplants barely fit. The taste is okay but a little bland.

This is so wonderful!  Make sure you do the salt and pat very dry for the eggplant method.  Bake at 450 for 5 min and flip and go for another 5 min.  This makes the eggplant crispy, like it's fried.  I use the new Ragu Light sauce  and I only needed 1 big eggplant cut in about 1/4 inch rounds.  Great recipe!  Thank you!

AWESOME FANTASTIC FLAVOR...but the eggplant itself came out really soggy and a huge disappointment.  I tried sweating the eggplant for an hour, then dipped and baked it for about 10 minutes before adding the sauce, baking for 5 minutes to warm through.

I guess I'm still on the hunt for the perfect recipe.

Great recipe, I wouldn't change a thing!  I've made this recipe twice with the three eggplants listed in the ingredients and both times have ended up filling two 9x13 pans.  It doesn't bother me, the leftovers are great too.

This recipe was absolutely amazing.  I cooked this for coworkers and they went for thirds.  The only thing I added for some extra flavor and a little bit of bite were lots of oregano and one can of spicy Rotel tomatoes.  I used the Original can but for extra spice, the Hot would work just as well.  I also, like other recommendations, cooked the eggplants for about 10 minutes longer to make the dish moist.  Will definitely cook again.  Thanks for sharing!

OUSTANDING RECIPE! I too followed a bit of advice from previous reviews and Sweat the 1/4" think slices by sprinkling with sea salt on both sides and letting stand for approx. 30 mins. Rinse, pat dry w/ paper towel making sure the get good & dry.
Also, Instead of baking, you can also pan fry (I used Canola oil) the eggplant until it turns a nice golden color and then proceed with Step 3 of the recipe.

This is my favorite dish! As the other reviewer suggested, after I slice the eggplant, I season it with garlic salt and layer it in paper towels for quite a while before I bread it(with a mix of bread crumbs and parm) and bake it. Also I use just a bit of ricotta cheese in between each layer along with the mozzarella. Delicious!!

This was really fantastic.  It felt decadent to eat with all of that cheese, but the texture was fantastic even with the baking instead of frying.  This is being added to my instant hall of fame.

This was just absolutely delicious!  If you love eggplant parm like I do, you have to try this.  I followed the recipe almost exactly..except I made my own quick tomato sauce with one large can of tomato puree, sliced garlic, dried basil, and a pinch of sugar...quick and better than the stuff out of the jar.  I really liked this recipe because the eggplant is baked and not fried.  I did find 3 eggplants to be too many though.. 2 will suffice.  Make sure you slice your eggplant THIN!  I sprayed my cookie sheets with a little canola cooking spray to help them brown a bit.  I will be making this again!

I sweated the eggplant slices by salting them, leaving them for 30 min, then washing them off and squeezing dry with paper towels.  I used 2 medium sized eggplants which were enough for 9 inch baking dish if thinly sliced (1/4").  The slices have to be baked for at least 9 minutes a side to be nice and dry.  The slices turned out well since the texture simulated meat which my meat loving family needed in order to eat it.  I added mushrooms to my dish which I'm glad I did or else it would've been even more bland - I would recommend adding many more veggies to up the taste.  I used Shake and Bake Italian crumbs instead of italian breadcrumbs since I couldn't find any and it turned out fine.  I used Healthy Choice garlic and onion sauce but if you can, use homemade sauce since these bottled ones are so watery and bland.  Overall, this recipe was good because it was healthy but needs much more to be excellent.

this was my first time cooking fresh eggplant... these were really great and were not a big production/intimidating as i had anticipated — super easy! my boyfriend loved it! we had it over angel hair pasta.

i used one medium-sized eggplant and i sweated the slices as several suggested for 30 minutes and added parmesan and garlic to the breadcrumbs (contadina). i double-dipped/breaded the slices and baked them for 10 on each side; they weren't very crispy/browned after 5. and used barilla's basic marinara sauce which worked well.

watch your cooking time for the whole casserole - mine only needed about 20 minutes. even though i only used 1 eggplant and my boyfriend had hearty seconds, we have a ton of leftovers and i set aside some of the slices for sandwiches - so good!

This is a great recipe however I did modify it a bit to make cooking simpler. Please please sweat your eggplant for 30 minutes with salt ( takes away the wang that you can get form store bought eggplants sometimes)
Instead of a 9x13 pan I used two baking sheets and laid out my breaded eggplant and cooked for about 7 minutes on each side. Then I simply layered sauce on top sprinkled with parmesan and mozarella and cooked for 25 minutes. If you slice your eggplant about a 1/4 inch thick you will only need about 25 minutes in an oven that cooks well.
I served this amazing dish over buttered whole wheat spaghetti noodles with my homeade sweet sicilian sauce. Delish!!!!! As a new vegetarian I am looking for some good dishes so my family doesn't say "hey where's the meat"

Thank you to all of you who share your wonderful recipes here.
Regarding this recipe:
* I used Prego Traditional Sauce 2 x 24 oz bottles.
* I used fresh basil, cut up 1 big leave in small pcs
* I used 2 sml eggplants (other user said less seeds, less bitter, she was right).  
* Skinned 1 eggplant w/ potato peeler.  Took off top. Cut in 1/2 length wise, then in thin slices.  
I put the slices in a 1 gallon ziplock bag.
* Beat 1 egg which I added to 1 gallon ziplock bag.  Rubbed bag to make sure all pcs were covered.
* I added 1 C of plain bread crumbs and 3/4 C of seasoned bread crumbs.  Rubbing the bag to make sure all pcs were covered.
* Laid them out on a plate.
* Repeated these steps with 2nd eggplant.
* Followed the rest of the directions of the recipe.  
I tried some of the slices after frying and when I was done frying I put them in a 9 x 13 dish sprinkeled them with light salt and Italian seasoning.  Mixed them to make sure all pcs got some salt & seasoning.
Before putting in baking dish I divided: eggplant and cheese in 6 to make sure I had 6 equal amount of layers.
It turned out great.  This is for Sunday,  today is Friday, I hope I don't eat it all by then.

This was pretty tasty but it did require some tweaking.  I found 2 eggplants to be more than enough for my family of four.  I added basil and Italian seasoning to the tomato sauce and I found that the eggplant needed to cook for about 10 minutes on each side.  I used park skim mozzarella slices because that's what I had on hand and I like the way they melt (the cheese gets nice and done like I like it).  I will make it again.

I loved this eggplant! My boyfriend and I are trying to eat at least 2 vegetarian dishes a week, and this will be a huge help. I give the recipe 4 stars because I modified it slightly: I used homemade sauce, which I think made a big difference to the taste. I also used fresh basil, because I had a ton on hand, and sprinkled a layer in the middle. I only had unseasoned bread crumbs on hand, so I made my own by adding italian seasoning, garlic powder and parmesan cheese. I think I used a little less cheese than called for, but I needed an extra egg to coat all the eggplant (maybe I cut it too thin?). Regardless, a great recipe that you can do a lot with! Thanks!

Good, and relatively easy to make.  I like the eggplant, I acutally could have been content eating them after baking, before adding sauce and cheese.

I am very impressed. First time to make this recipe and my picky father in law had seconds! Took the advice and baked it with a little spray olive oil on top and bottom at 425, got it good and crunchy so when all assembled it held it's form beautifully. Also, cut and peeled and sweated the eggplant the night before and then drained again the day I made it, cut down on prep time the day of making it. Family said keep!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The flavors are amazing. However, I had a difficult time getting the bread crumbs to stick. I also baked the eggplant for 10 min. on each side and then broiled for 2 min. It makes the crust a little crispier.

I totally loved this recipe! This dish was sooo delicious!  My husband and even my picky toddler loved it.  I did sweat the eggplant first and then baked it at 450 for 10 minutes each side like other suggested.  Followed everything else exact.  It was wonderful!

My husband (who thinks you have to have meat at every meal) ate two helpings and loved it! I took other suggestions about browning for 10 minutes each side. Yummy!

Sweat the eggplant, baked for 10 minutes per side, then added the cheese and sauce and baked another 15 minutes. Thanks for all those who left the tips, it was great, will make again.

Turned out very well.  This was my first time making eggplant parmesan.  Made 1/3rd the recipe.  Made my own sauce and bread crumbs by adding 2T parsley flakes, 1/4 tsp red pepper, and 1 tsp each garlic pwd, onion pwd, dried basil, and dried oregano to 2 cups bread crumbs.  Used the same mix of seasonings with 2 quarts home canned crushed tomatoes and 1lb browned ground turkey and simmered it about a 1/2 hr.  Baked eggplant 10 min per side as recommended by other reviewers.

Definitely delicious! Relatively easy and very tasty! Loved this lower fat version with the eggplant baked rather than fried. We actually liked it better than when it's fried!

This was very good.  I made a few modifications - As suggested by other reviewers, I sliced the eggplant (I used 2 good size eggplants), salted it and let it sit for 20 minutes, then I rinsed and patted dry.  I used egg substitute, instead of real eggs.  I baked the eggplant 10 minutes on each side and then turned the broiler on and broiled on each side for a minute and a half.  This made the eggplant a little crispy.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this and we are looking forward to the leftovers today.

This recipe was ok.  I added extra motz cheese and browned the top but the entire dish had a very strong eggplant taste.  Maybe the eggplant should be soaked in saltwater before added to the baking mix?

I did like the non frying method.  Not soaked in grease.  However maybe I needed to cook it longer, but the eggplant was cooked, just crunchy. I am a novice and will try again.

believe all the hype...this recipe is GOOD! 
followed other's suggestions: 1) dip eggplant slices in egg then toss them in a large zip-lock with the bread crumbs...and shake away, 2) bake for 10 min. each side.
i used cheddar instead of mozzarella because that's all i had and it turned out yum-a-licious! thank you Dolores Ryan!

The submitter must be coating these eggplant slices at the speed of light to have them all prepared in 25 minutes!  It took me more than twice as long and 5 eggs to get all of them coated.  My family and I decided that it was pretty average as far as taste went.  It didn't seem to be worth the effort it took to make--Very average recipe.

This is a great recipe. Super easy to make. The only thing I question is the amount of egg necessary. I had to double the amount to have enough to coat all the eggplant.

Although this recipe takes time to prepare, mainly from dipping and breading the eggplant, it is well worth it. I made the dish for myself as a healthy dinner meal for after work, however, it turned out so delicious that my daughter and husband enjoyed it as well (My husband generally shuns an all veggie dinner).

This is an awesome recipe!  I made this over the holidays and got tons of compliments.  I did what other reviewers said, bake 10 minutes per side and salt eggplant first.  The rest was exactly the recipe, and I will make eggplant this way for the rest of my marriage!!

A nice recipe, great taste.  I made individual ramekins of eggplant parmesan, it was very fun to serve and eat like that.  I found I had to cook the eggplant slices 15 minutes a side for them to be fully cooked through.  I also used much less mozzarella and it tasted fine.

This was fantastic. I enjoyed this recipe very much. I mixed in some of my own spices into the bread crumbs and I added spices and fresh garlic to the pasta sauce before putting it in with the eggplant. I served this with brussel sprouts and red onions and my boyfriend said "If this is what being vegetarian tastes like, I'm in."

This is super-good. My boyfriend and I had an eggplant and no idea what to do with it. We followed this recipe, except we baked them in a single lay wth sauce and cheese and then put them on french bread with more sauce. Viola! Vegeterian sandwiches... healthier than a meatball sub anyday!

This was great! I baked the slices @375 for 10 min. each side, and they got nice and crispy without burning.  Also, if you're not a vegetarian and have homemade sauce and meatballs, try slicing down some meatballs and placing them in the "gaps" between the eggplant circles.  This dish is definitely worth the effort!!!!

Very flavorful.  Only needed two eggplant; used plain breadcrumbs seasoned with Italian Seasoning.  I read a few reviews before making it and brush the eggplant with olive oil as suggested.  This made a great leftover as well.  Making it again very soon!

Neither my husband or I liked this recipe.  I'm sure that part of it was personal taste preference and part was my messing it up.  I didn't fry the eggplant slices since we don't like fried food so it changed the texture overall.  I won't make this again, but I probably would if I actually liked eggplant in this type of dish.  Overall I am giving it three stars because it wasn't very easy to prepare and the time spent on it wasn't worth it. I would score it lower, but I know that others love this recipe and have had great success.

Excellent!  We loved that this was a healthier version of an old favorite.  I especially enjoyed the lack of mess in preparing this version. It was quicker to prepare too.  My husband who is half Italian, and quite health conscious, stated that this was the best Eggplant Parmesan he'd ever had.

I am new to cooking and even I didn't mess this up.  My roommates liked it even though it has a (gasp) vegetable in it!  Great recipe.

Excellent.  Never like eggplant before, but decided to give it a shot.  Made fresh sauce with plum tomatoes, onion, fresh basil, garlic and oregano.  MMMMMmmm.   I would recommend this to anyone.  I also seasoned my egg with garlic powder, and I added more garlic powder, parmesan cheese, and seasoning salt to the bread crumb mixture.  Skeptics give it a try!

I havent had eggplant since my mother fixed it for me when I was 10, I am now 33.  Needless to say I guess I STILL dont like eggplant.  I thought I would try this recipe because of all the reviews that said they didnt like it but loved it in this recipe.  It was easy enough to fix but I just didnt like the flavor, which by the way is NOT covered up by the sauce.  I ended up digging out the eggplant and using the sauce/cheese on noodles.  I am sure this is a good recipe for those of you who do like eggplant.

My husband and I loved this. I couldn't find Italian bread crumbs so had to "make" my own. I took the suggestions of several others and sweated the eggplant before cooking it and baking for 10 minutes on each side. I only used 1 eggplant and there was plenty for the two of us for several meals. Not a difficult recipe but still time consuming. This is a weekend recipe for me. I don't have time for all the steps during the week. Very tasty. I know my husband will be asking for this again.

I was very pleased with this as it was my first attempt at making eggplant parmesan. I did dip the eggplant in egg then bread crumbs, but browned them in olive oil instead of baking them. I folled the rest of the directions as they were and it turned out great!

I was so pleased with this recipie! I was a bit hesitant to try it, as I've tried other eggplant dishes that have come out horribly, but this one is a keeper!  Took a few extra minutes to make some fresh sauce - this dish burst with fresh flavors.  Thanks!

I brought home the eggplant to make this dish and my husband's response was, "Are you mad at me?".  I loved that the breaded eggplant was baked, not fried...very low fat!  I thought the dish was FABULOUS!  As for my husband?  He went back for seconds, despite the initial protests.

This is really good.  I only used about half of a medium eggplant for my husband and I.  The rest I stacked in a freezer bag for later.  
I would extend the cooking time to 40 minutes I think.  Mine was still a little tough.
I also used half a sleeve of crushed up saltines and seasoned them myself with garlic and herbs.  I think its better than bread crumbs.

Great recipe!  We only used 1 eggplant (and reduced other ingrediants accordingly) and it was plenty for 2 people.  We even had enough for leftovers.  I also salted the eggplants ahead of time to remove bitterness.

This recipe was overall fairly good.  My only problem was this:  We only used ONE (large) eggplant (the recipe calls for three), and it required FAR more sauce, egg, and bread crumbs than the recipe suggested.  Plus, my husband and I had more leftovers than we could ever eat! So, use caution when purchasing your ingredients for this dish.

This was my first try at eggplant parm and it came out pretty darn good. We liked that it was baked, so was way less greasy than my usual fried eggplant slices. A couple small changes: first, I sliced it lengthwise instead of in circles, which made for nice even layers in the baking dish, similar to how lasagna noodles work. I did sweat the eggplant. Instead of bread crumbs, I crushed some panko with a rolling pin and mixed in some oregano and fine Parmesan. No basil! Let it sit for 15 or 20 minutes after baking, so it sets up nicely. That's it! Serve with linguini and marinara. Making it again this weekend with the last of the garden eggplants

I cooked it longer than the recipe called for.  I’d pan fry the eggplant instead of putting it in the oven next time.

I made this but trimmed it way down for two. I used one eggplant and followed the rest with an eyeball amount of cheese.  I baked it longer according to other entries, 10 mins a side, and on parchment paper so no oil needed.  It was very yummy.  We ate it over pasta with our own homemade sauce. I will make again for sure.

I made the recipe with two medium sized Mine were about 3/8" thick.  Bake the slices on the sheet for at least 15 minutes before assembling the dish, otherwise the eggplant is not cooked sufficiently.  The flavor and overall appearance of the dish was excellent, definitely restaurant caliber.  I will make it again.

I loved it!  I made the recipe for 6 and ate 2 portions myself.  So good.
Peeled eggplant and did not salt/wash.  Not bitter at all.  I think I got a male eggplant. Sliced to approx 1/2-1/4 inch.  Breaded per recipe and sprinkled with shred parm.
Baked at 450 for 6 mins each side on evvo sheet pan.  Perfectly  done.  Made my version of Raos sauce and layered with cheeses.   Yum Yum.   Thank you Dolores!

I've made Eggplant Parmigiana many times, also baked, but years, so used this recipe for times.  Took much longer to make in both steps.  I thought I would grow old & did waiting and still had to put it back in the oven and I only did two thin layers .  Other than the time, it's okay.

This was hands down amazing and my first time ever making eggplant parmesan!  I did find it to be a little labor intensive due to following everyone’s suggestions for preparing the eggplant  (do yourself a favor and  follow the extra steps, you won’t be disappointed!!!). I will definitely be adding this into the family recipe rotation.

Made it three times. Make sure you peel the eggplant and cut into slices then salt for an hour to remove the bitterness. Then rinse off the salt  and drain before dipping in the egg mixture. Taste great the next day as leftovers if you have any.

This is a delicious recipe. The only thing I'm saying different is the cutlets need to bake for about 10 minutes on each side (instead of the 4 minutes recommended).

I have made this one a few times now and it is always well received.  Great 'intro to vegetarian' meal for when we have guests over (just double check it is a vegetarian Parmesan - not all of them are).  Serve with pasta or as the main course with side salad.

Growing up in an Italian Family we never use jar sauce unless to make pizza. So I used my own sauce and it tasted great! I liked baking the eggplant instead of frying it to try & be  healthy. Frying the eggplant definitely gives it a crunchy texture and prevents it from getting soggy. This was a little soggy but overall very tasty. In the future, I may try broiling or air frying the eggplant to get that desired crunch.

It turned out great! I have to say i have made many recipes from this site and never have i found the reviews to be so passionate, controversial, and funny!  Who knew an eggplant dish (parmesan??casserole?) could stir up such excitement, great read.

Awesome recipe! Made it just as written but had to bake the eggplant longer (and at a higher temp - 400 degrees).  Better half was in 7th heaven and we ended up eating it 3 days in a row because it was so delicious. (There are only 2 of us....). Will definitely make again!

I have made this at least 3 times. I was at the farmer ( not market) and he had eggplant straight from the field. My husband said get them and make that eggplant  parmesan dish. So here I go for the 4th time. It is great because it it baked. I make my sauce from herbs from my garden. So We love this recipe.

My homemade gluten-free bread crumbs made a heavier coating for the eggplant slices, so the first round of baking took longer than expected. Well worth it, because it beats standing over a pan of hot oil and also consuming the extra fat and calories! My son the eggplant hater enjoyed it, too. Thanks for sharing; will make it again and again!

I enjoyed making this.  Instead of store bought tomato sauce, I used the "no tomato"sauce recipe  I found here on allrecipes.  I made my own bread crumbs using just plain white bread.  I omitted the basil because I had enough seasoning in the sauce.  Turned out beautifully.

I read the reviews with suggested changes then made the recipe exactly as it said.  Wonderful dinner.  Will make this often exactly as described.  Well, maybe not quite.  I used an arrabiata sauce as the pasta sauce.

Awesome meal! this was my fisrt time preparing eggplant, and I must say it was delish! I did put salt on the eggplant for about 15 mins just becuase a lot of the other comments suggested it (not sure if I would have noticed the difference). For the egg mixture I put black pepper, garlic powder & Parsley. I also baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side. My whole family LOVED it (age range 3-35). I only used 1 eggplant and that was enough to feed 6 (with salad on the side) I will make this again!! it's a dinner WINNER!!

Cut thin slices so one eggplant will make all three layers.  It will taste better with thinner slices too.

Made this last night and my 14 year old who wanted pizza for dinner had two servings :) Agree that 1/4" is the perfect thickness, sweated the slices with salt on one side laying on paper towels. After 20 minutes, wiped slices but did not rinse. We are gluten free so while the eggplant was sweating, I toasted about 6 slices of rye style, gluten free bread and then made crumbs in the food processor. Did the egg dip, coated with bread crumbs by hand and baked for 20 minutes (on parchment paper) without flipping since the crumbs were larger and would have fallen off. Layered sauce on bottom, eggplant slices, mozza cheese, parm cheese, NO sauce, eggplant, cheeses, sauce, cheese, basil. Baked until heated through 25 mins or so. Amazing!!!!  I think the bread crumbs were the key because of the rye style bread and because no sauce in the middle to make them soggy.

This has become a staple at my house. It's amazingly easy to make, and tastes amazing. I've even made it casserole style by using penne pasta and layering it (penne, sauce, eggplant, cheese, more sauce, and you can repeat for a double layer) for a potluck  (I cooked it for about half an hour longer). There was one serving left, and it was a completely full 11x16x4in casserole dish!

recipe tips: 1) You can eat the skin on young eggplants, but the skin of older ones can be bitter and may require peeling.
 2) The flesh of older eggplants can be bitter, too. To mitigate this, sprinkle salt on slices or chunks, and let them rest for 30 to 60 minutes in a colander until they begin to give up water. Rinse them well, pat them dry, and proceed with your recipe. 3) When you're not using the above technique, cut eggplant just before cooking, as its flesh quickly discolors. 

Variation: as another person stated "skip breading, frying or baking entirely. Simply slice them, brush with EVOO and grill on both sides until lightly browned. You can use the gas grill or a ridged grill pan or indoor griddle. It really cuts down on the fat, carbs and calories "

My husband loves eggplant parmesan but I have never made it for him so when I found this recipe I thought I would give it a try and wow was it good. My husband kept raving about how good it was.  I added ground beef and black olives in the layering.

I use this recipe as a base so often that I figured the least I could do was offer five stars! I add milk to the beaten eggs, dunk the eggplant and then turn it over in seasoned breadcrumbs. And I don't bake the eggplant - I fry it. Still LOVE this recipe!

Literally, one of the best recipes I've ever made successfully.  Super easy and delicious.  I did the salting/soaking of the eggplant as recommended in the video to take the bitterness out of the plant. 

I followed the recipe to the "T" in terms of ingredients...making no additions or substitutions and it turned out restaurant-worthy.  I did have to bake the eggplant for longer to get it crisp, so that the breadcrumbs weren't soggy.  I probably did 10 minutes on each side. My husband typically doesn't like what I cook.  And he's not big into Italian-type fare.  But he said to save this recipe.

Great call to bake!  We love eggplant parm. Used the reviewers suggestion to use egg whites & made my own seasoned bread crumbs. I peeled 1 eggplant (we grew it) & sweated it on paper towels. Baked thick slices at 350* 10 min per side. Then made a casserole of a little homemade sauce in bottom layered with cooked ala dente whole wheat spaghetti placed baked eggplant on top then more sauce with sautéed Italian sausage with peppers & onions ! Covered everything with shredded mozzarella & grated fresh parm. Baked about 10 min until cheese browned. Definitely company worthy. Thanks  for ideas. A keeper! Ps hubby said to be sure to say no bitter here!

I gave this 5 stars, first because it gave me the idea not to fry the eggplant. I was afraid it was going to be too dry or stick, neither happened. I'm not one to try to make things complicated when it comes to last minute menus, this was a last minute for me. I had one huge eggplant that I needed to cook tonight so it wouldn't go bad. (becoming much better not to waste my produce, it's struggle for me sometimes).  So I went to Allrecipes and searched for easy. This was easy. Perfect.  I followed the directions for egg, breading, and baking. I only had the one eggplant but it was rather big. I had enough for two layers. I used whole wheat seasoned bread crumbs but no matter what recipe I follow, I usually add the following dried ingredients, basil, garlic powder, oregano, for my "italian" dishes. I layered as suggested, baked in oven for 30 minutes, the first 20 minutes, I covered the baking dish with foil and then removed it to brown the cheese. I did not salt, soak, or peel the eggplant and I had no problems with it. The baking before hand seemed to do the trick. My adult son ate it and liked it, I ate it and loved it. He's not emotional as I with food.  Next time, I may attempt homemade spaghetti sauce. In my old age, I'm finally learning. I hate to go out to eat anymore, much prefer to eat my own food.

My boys decided to pick all of my eggplant from the garden at the same time so I decided to invite some friends over for an eggplant dish. I have never made eggplant Parmesan and was surprised by how easy it was with this recipe.   All of my guests raved about the Egglpant Parmesan. It was delicious.  I love the no fry recipe. The consistency was great. I did sweat the eggplants as was suggested by another reviewer. I also added Romano cheese along with the Parmesan and mozzarella.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely yummy.  Easier to make than the traditional fried verison.  A little healthier too. Used two large eggplants.  Had enough for another meal.  Covered the baking dish for first 15 minutes of baking.  Uncovered to crisp.  Tender and delicious.  One of my all time favorites.  As good as what my italian girlfriends make.  Jan from Florida

This is my first time trying eggplant and I bought two really big ones. The first on I cut was brown on the inside I thought it best not to eat that. The second one  I cut was good on the inside. I didn't know the prep time was as long however it's in the stove baking now I'll come back later with coments on how it taste, so far it smell good :) That's a good sign.

Five minuites each side was not enough baking time for the eggplant. I did 10 min each side and it still came out tough and chewy. We ended up throwing it out, which doesn't happen often in our house.

I followed the recipe, but the eggplant wasn't really cooked through. Plus the sauce layer with the cheese was a bit clumpy -- I didn't like how this layer cooked between the eggplant slices. I would go back to a more traditional fry-first recipe next time.

1/4 inch thick, skin off, Sea salt for 30 min., rinse, dry completely, dunk in egg whites then seasoned bread crumbs, put on nonstick and cook for 8-10 min. Per side at 400 degrees.  Then eat - may be better plain than with all the salty cheese and sauce.
Small, heavy male eggplant = less bitter

I followed the ingredients but didn't bother to measure since I only had one eggplant and was only feeding me and two toddlers but I thought it was amazing. I did sprinkle them with a little Himalayan Salt from Tastefully Simple before breaking etc., also I baked for 10 mins on each side. I will make this again for my husband next time.

I used all the ingredients listed with no additions, however, I modified the amounts to suit 3 people with one day of leftovers (so that's just 1 eggplant for us).  Of course I had to make my own spaghetti sauce and my own italian bread crumbs for this to be off the charts for me.  Oh, and I fried my eggplant in coconut oil instead of baking it.  I highly suggest using freshly grated parmigiano reggiano and a freshly shredded mozzarella (I used full fat mozzarella).  Love this dish!!!!

I had a friend buy me some veggies while she was at the farmers market and she brought home an eggplant! Well...hhmmm I had no clue. I found this recipe and thought,ok here we go! I too made a few changes. I did sweat the eggplant 30 min, rinsed and dried with paper towels. I used the eggs then Panko and flour which I added italian seasoning, salt and cracked black pepper. cooked at 425 for 8 minutes each side then put in the casserole dish and covered with the sauce and cheese in layers.OK, the funny part is I made my husband chicken because I didn't think he would eat the eggplant. Guess what? Yep, all the eggplant was gone! It was great!! A little time consuming prep but worth it. Thank you for all the comments. I read Lots of them before I ventured into the eggplant world unknown:)

I guess I'm the odd man out. I didn't really care for this. I cooked the eggplant longer as advised by other reviewers but it was still hard and I didn't find it to have much flavor. On the other hand, my family said it was very good.

This was the best I've ever made. It has a restaurant quality. The adjustments I made were minimal. I used one large eggplant for four adults and baked the eggplant 15 minutes on the first side and 7 minutes on the second side. I will be using and sharing this recipe from now on.

My boyfriend and I tried this recipe last night and we really enjoyed it! We did run into a couple of issues and modified a few things. We had way too much eggplant. I bet you would be fine with getting 2 large-ish ones. In the video, it mentions salting the eggplant slices and letting them sit for 30mins to make them less bitter. I would suggest that, if you have the time. Also, start with 2 eggs in the bowl, but I bet you will need to crack more. I think I ended up having to use 4 or 5. We only had 3 cups of the bread crumbs and we were fine. When it came time for spaghetti sauce, we used Prego Florentine Spinach and Cheese. It was a nice little add on. It was thicker so it made the dish less watery. Overall, the recipe was fun to make, but make sure you have the time to work on it. Very tasty!

Pretty good!! But instead of using premade pasta sauce next time I'll make my own! It's a little too sweet for me but my family loved it!

Made this following the recipe exactly.  The eggplant was tough.  I have never made eggplant Parm by baking always fried.  My family did not like the taste of this dish.

It was the best recipe for eggplant parm I have ever made.  I only had 1 eggplant, so I only did one layer and it was wonderful.  The dish had a crispy top and I loved it.  My daughter asked if I would make it asap.

This recipe ingredient wise is almost like mine. I really didn't think fried vs baked eggplant would make any difference. I was really surprised! I scored this a four, for "oh so easy" less labor intensive. However my old tried and true recipe for taste is worth the extra effort.

Used croutons & Parm for breading. Next time will fry to make it crispier, but great for the first time trying. Flavorful didn't stress as eggplant wasnt bitter.

I'm a Vegetarian I was asked to bring a Vegetarian dish to a Church dinner. I live in the south where usually, just the word Vegetarian bring on a sour look and a snarled lip. Anyway I took this dish thinking I would just be bringing it back home. I watched, finally someone got up the nerve to try something labeled "Vegetarian". The look on their face was yum. Then they went an told someone else. Next thing I know it was all gone and people were asking me for the recipe. This dish was a success in a place where everything has to be deep fried and buried in chili n cheese or sweet. "Yup If'n it's good for ya or has the word healthy Hooked to it, why it's bound ta taste awful". Now I'm Actually beginning to get some of my friends here to consider eating healthy. Anyway great recipe that deserves all 5 stars.

I had never made, let a lot eaten eggplant parm so I followed the recipe closely.  Did take other advice on sweating the e.p. and made my own sauce.  Thinly sliced to me is very thin so I did that.  Also baked for called for time.   The results were not good and had me wondering why people eat eggplant. Mine was leathery and not at all appealing.   

Made it again except this time my sister who is a full vegetarian was there to help me what it was supposed to taste like.   Sliced it at about a quarter of an inch and baked, baked and baked some more.  Didn’t keep track of the full cook time but it was far longer than stated.   The results were good and everyone including my teenage son enjoyed it.  

1 star if you follow the recipe – canned sauce and leathery eggplant, not our idea of a good meal.  With adjustments it’s a 5 star, thus the 2 star rating.

I made this dish for a friend and we both loved it! If this recipe had 10 stars I'd give it all ten. I'm not fond of vegetables so when I find a recipe I like, believe me it's a winner. I'm about to go make some eggplant chips right now just because they were that good.

This is so good you should make two pans. My family ate it up and the kids swear they don't like eggplant!  The second time I made it, I used plain bread crumbs and added WildTree hearty spaghetti seasoning.

This is delicious. I even added some cumin for a little kick. This is the 2nd time this week I made this recipe mainly because I had to much eggplant but I don't mind because it was good.

I've had eggplant before but never eggplant parm. Always wanted to try it so I made it for my husband and toddler. They enjoyed it (which is shocking because my toddler is super picky). But I could barely eat it because it was so bitter. I sweated it for an hour and followed other's advice to bake for longer. The issue could have been the eggplant itself because I live in an area where fresh veggies are hard to come by and I read a review that said fresh eggplant should never be bitter.

Me and my fiancé love this dish... However, we used a single eggplant and it made more than enough for this recipe. What was leftover from our eggplant, was nice to snack on while waiting for the dish to complete!

Surprisingly good. I'm a big meat eater but figured I'd give this recipe a go, and everyone, including my 1 year old, loved it. Like other reviews suggested, I let the eggplant sweat beforehand. Served this over whole wheat penne noodles.

I totally loved this recipe but wasn't my all time favorite. Taste wise. Maybe it's cause I don't like eggplants but needed to cook this for my dad's diet.

I think the eggplants should be drained really well and should be soaked in salt then rested on a tissue. That's a must! It makes the bitterness go away and also gives a better taste to the eggplant. 

Over all, this was a successful recipe and I recommend it.

This was our first time trying eggplant and the recipe was overall very good.   Many of the reviewers recommend baking the slices for longer than stated in this recipe and I think that would have taken a lot of the "toughness" out of the eggplant.   I used half of my own sauce with half store bought sauce.   My sauce alone would have been too meaty.   I will make again with longer bake time on the slices.

This was very good. I did sweat, rinse, and dry the eggplant first. I also cut the portions because there are just two of us. I did one large eggplant, one egg, and enough breadcrumbs to look right. I cooked for 10 minutes on each side after reading other reviews.  Add homemade sauce and provolone cheese - yum.

I had eggplant many times as a child and was horrified every time I had to eat it. This recipe redeemed it completely. I only used half of the breading, but other than that followed NGD42200'S recommendations to the T. Amazing!!!!

Like there needs to be another review on this recipe, but I just have to review it bc I am so happy!  Made this last night for dinner.  AND I was making it for an Italian friend of ours whose family owns a fabulous Italian restaurant.  I was either being stupid or very brave; ESPECIALLY not frying the eggplant!  Thank God I was being brave.  Everybody LOVED it.  I am so thankful for this recipe.  After coming out of the over (450 degrees for 7 min on one side & 5 on the other) I couldn't stop eating the eggplant.  So awesome.  But our Italian friend said bc it wasn't fried he could eat more of it.  AND boy did he eat:) The only change I made in this recipe was what I stated about temp and cooking time.  Oh, and our friends wife (who is our friend, too..lol) could not believe I was able to get the eggplant so crunchy without frying it!

Great recipe.  However  I added these steps...first use cheese grater to score the skin on the egg plant and dip in egg then seasoned flour, then egg again, then season breadcrumbs. It makes  the final dish a little more body,rather than too soft. Just a variation.

Wow!  This was delicious!  I was nervous after reading all the reviews that talked about needing to cook the eggplant longer than 5 mins per side (I saw all the stars and just followed the recipe...with exception to follow.  I hate to admit that I am a novice cook, and it really pushed my patience to slice up 3 eggplant, dip, bread and cook all of the slices before assembly.  It took me about an hour to get that done!!!  I ended up using just 2 eggplant, cause I didn't have any more room in the pan!  My thought was...after all this work,this better be D(#% good! Well is WAS!!!  Delicious!  Will definitely make again...on a lazy or rainy Saturday.  Definitely not an "after work" recipe.  But the good news is, it makes a LOT, so I am going to divide up and freeze to heat up after work.  Really yummy!

Even with all of the positive reviews, I was shocked at how delicious this was. I did as someone suggested and ground oatmeal in my blendtec with some italian spices to use in place of the bread crumbs. Also as someone else had stated, used Hunt's Garlic and Herb spaghetti sauce. I added some red chile flakes and fennel seed to the sauce. Anywhere between 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. each. Cut 1/4 inch eggplant slices. To drain some of the moisture from the eggplant, I put them on a paper towel, salted one side, flipped them over and salted the other side. After sitting for a while, transferred them to new, dry paper towels. As someone suggested, I dipped the eggplant in some flour first. Baked @440* for 10 minutes each side. They turned out beautifully. Served over angel hair pasta. Oh so good!!!

Made it tonight, very good. As per my usual, I sliced the eggplant (wipe the knife off after cutting the stem and end off - that's where the bitterness comes from and will "spread" to the rest of the slices if you don't). I placed a single layer in a deep wire colander, salted each layer, and then placed a plate weighted with a bowl of water on top for about a half hour. Rinsed and dried well after. I dipped each slice in flour, then egg, then bread crumb mixture and baked on a greased cookie sheet for 10 minutes each side. I always save leftover homemade sauce in the freezer, and just defrosted a few containers to use for this recipe. Takes some time to prep, but we like it so much better than fried and using a low-fat Italian cheese blend gives lots of flavor. As does adding salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and 1/4 c parm to the bread crumbs. We will deinitely be making this again.

This was very simple but delish!  I cut it down to 4 servings!  Make sure the eggplant is in the sauce.

Made this on 22 Jan 14, read other reviews that suggested salting the eggplant (I did not peel the eggplant) and letting it rest for 20 minutes or so.  Which I did, for about and hour to remove excess water. I made a large portion, used 4 medium sized eggplants, 5 eggs, lots of cheese and 4 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce (2 were basil flavored).  I cooked the eggplant for about 20 mins per side and assembled & baked for about an hour.  The end result was very yummy, a perfectly golden brown layer of cheese on top and a moist/saucy, cheesy inside.

As written, this is not a 5 star recipe, but once I made the adjustments suggested by others... this works out to be a "life changing" eggplant... at least in my husband's case.  He always hated eggplant but has been a trooper and reluctantly tries any time I make it... until I made this one (with the adjustments from other reviewers)... he basically ate a whole eggplant by himself, foregoing the pasta and other "fall back" sides/favorites of his.

Love that it's no fry.  I used 3 eggs and I cooked the eggplant longer at a higher temp for more crispy pieces before baking. My husband who does not normally like Eggplant loved it.  next time I will do single layers and add some spinach!

Holy smokes!!! Made this for a Christmas Dinner for 13 people and every single person, aged 11-76 just loved it. I used an excellent pasta sauce by Rao's, and get this, I made one casserole for my mother with Pecorino cheese (made only sheep's milk) who cannot have any milk products whatsoever. She hasn't been able to have Eggplant Parmesan in 20 years. She had seconds. I made a nice green salad with Pomegranate seeds, mandarin oranges, candied peans and crumbled feta cheese, along with artisan french bread. Killer.

This recipe is the BOMB!  I have baked it as the recipe calls for.  It was excellent!  I also fried the eggplant using panko bread crumbs (Italian style) and it got rave reviews from everyone that ate it.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Thanks!

We made this last week, it was good - my husband liked it.  I have to say for me, I'd be happy eating it but it doesn't call my name - no fault of the recipe, it made the texture of the eggplant I was struggling with tasty at least.  I have a feeling it's an eggplant issue for me. Wondering if anyone has TWEAKED this recipe and tried slices of zucchini in place of the eggplant?  The flavors would seem to do well together... Thanks for sharing!!

My teenage son loved this!  That's a huge endorsement for a veggie dish!  The ease of baking the eggplant as opposed to frying it makes me not hesitate to make it again.  In fact, I've already made it twice in 2 weeks, and this will be a standard on our "Meatless Monday" menu.

This is one of my favorite recipes! My fiance hates eggplant but he constantly requests this dish every week. I did follow the advice of other reviewers to sweat the eggplant and bake it for 7 mins on each side. This way it didn't taste so much like eggplant and had a crispness to it.

I make an altered version of this all the time.  I use mash firm tofu with a potato masher and use that in place of half the cheese.  Then I use a sharp cheddar so it has a bit more flavor.  It takes away about half the fat and doubles the protein.

This is not the typical eggplant parmesan recipe, but we loved it.  I scaled it down to 1 eggplant to make only enough for 2 and it made enough for 2 1/2 meals. I served it over spaghetti noodles...I wish I would have had a bit more sauce for those, but it was still so good.  I used the suggestions of so many other reviewers and sprinkled the salt on the eggplant, left for 30 min. and rinsed to avoid any bitterness.  Then baked on each side for 10 min.  Other than that, it was prepared as directed.  We will have this again.

Very good version of eggplant Parm without the frying and oil.  I followed suggestions to bake for 10 min per side rather than 5, and added ricotta cheese to the mix of cheeses.  Family, including kids, really enjoyed.

I tried this and it was ok but a little dry, my head was telling me not to put all the sauce at the bottom of the pan as the recipe indicated, (I used my own sauce and not a shop bought version), and I should have listened. 
I think it would be much improved by foregoing the breadcrumbs and adding half the sauce later at the top of the dish.

We tried this after my son said he wanted to try eggplant, and everyone loved it! I didn't soak the eggplant at all, no problems with bitterness. Also, my hubby is lactose intolerant, so after baking the eggplant slices about 15 min on each side, we served them over pasta with the sauce on top, and then the cheese. It looked just like a restaurant meal, and that way, we each got the amount of cheese we like. Definitely make this one again!! Oh, only 2 eggplant for 6 people, and we had leftovers.

Wonderful recipe, only change two things.  First I peeled the eggplant and then sliced the eggplant.  I put a layer of sliced eggplant in a large colander and sprinkle evenly with salt. Repeat with remaining eggplant, salting, until all eggplant is in the colander. Weigh down the slices with a couple of plates and let drain for 2 hours.  This removes the moisture from eggplant before cooking.  And continued with the rest of the recipes.  Will make again and again!!

This is an excellent recipe, absolutely delicious! The baked eggplant is actually better than fried ,in my opinion. My family loved it, even the hard to please meat eaters. They weren't happy when they heard it was a meatless dish but now they ask for this often. Simple to prepare, great the next day (if you have any left) and so good.

DELICIOUS!  Like many reviewers suggested, I salted the slices to remove bitterness, let them drain for 30 minutes then rinsed and dried the slices.  Needed four x-large eggs to dip slices in but didn't measure bread crumbs.  Also added a layer of ricotta cheese.  Definitely takes longer than 25 minutes to prepare, as I ended up needing 3 large cookie sheets.  Used 3 pie plates, kept one and gave the other 2 dishes to friends.  Hope they enjoy as much as I did.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

This ended a 10 year feud with my husband who claimed, "I hate eggplant". I called him out because I've never seen him try it to begin with! I'm gluten free, so used cornmeal with Italian seasoning to dredge the eggplant, baked 10 minutes each side, followed recipe exactly other than that.  Incredibly delicious! My doubting husband ate THREE helpings and my picky teen ate hers as well. I felt so healthy giving us a vegetarian dinner option. This is a great, affordable meal. Thank you!

One word-Amazing...! Whoever thought that veg dishes can be so yummy....! I did bake the eggplants for 10 mins each side at 375 and sprinkled some fresh tarragon on the bottom layer of cheese( was out of fresh basil). Finished the layering with a generous amount of basil on the top layer of cheese...!

I have changed it a bit. Washed my vegetable well, left the skin on amd sliced it in the lenght, very thin.
Used the same breading and fried it in olive oil for just a minute to brown.
Sprayed a cookie sheet, added spagetti sauce on top followed by a mixture of italian cheeses and baked at350 for 10 min.
Excellent with a ceasar salad
The eggplant was crisp amd delicious
The 4 star is for the change

This was phenomenal. I made meatless marinara to go over this and it was delicious. I used two small eggplants, which was enough for two people. Per the recommendations of reviews, I also seasoned the eggplant with garlic powder for half an hour as I wasn't too sure about the quality of eggplant I'd bought. It was terrific! I can't wait to eat this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was ok - nothing exceptional (but I think I've just decided I'm not a big eggplant parm person anyway). I did not do all the extra steps with salting the eggplant and it was FINE. I also used a mandolin to cut the eggplant so it was thin enough I didn't need to cook it longer than called for in the recipe.

Very good recipe !!  The eggplant came out perfect !! Did like other reviewers and salted/rinsed the eggplant before baking. Baked it for 12 minutes each side. Layered the eggplant with penne pasta so it ended up like an eggplant lasagna. A keeper !!!!

This produced a wonderful dish and we liked that the eggplant was not deep fried. The texture of the final eggplant slices in the dish were just right, not too crunchy and not too mushy. However, the proportions and directions need major correction. We used 3 medium eggplants (the direction do not say what size eggplant to use). When thinly sliced three eggplants produce a lot of slices. I changed the proportions :
- 3 medium eggplants, peeled and thinly sliced
- 6 eggs, beaten
- 3 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs (option; add 1/2 cup grated parmesean to the bread crumbs)
- 10 cups spaghetti sauce
- 24 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded and divided
- 1/2 cup parmesean cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
Also, in the Directions it says to bake for 35 minutes. This recipe produced so much that you need to bake it for 45 min. at 350 degrees.

So good! I did salt the eggplant first, and also baked each side for 10 minutes as many others suggested.  I used Progresso Italian bread crumbs - the eggplant had perfect crunch and texture overall - huge hit!

It was delishous! But I don't know if it was my oven, to get the breaded eggplant to be light brown on each side, I had to raise my oven temperature to 370 and cook then 7-9 minutes on each side. To help them along, I sprayed Pam cooking spray on them.

Recipe is very good, but I suspect that there may be typos.  Is it supposed to read "3 lbs. eggplant" instead of "3 eggplant"?  I don't think you could fit three normal-sized eggplants into a 9"x13" baking dish.  Also, I don't know where the 4 cups of bread crumbs fit in... I barely used one cup, coating the eggplant slices thoroughly.  Other quantities seemed okay.

My first attempt cooking eggplant. I was amazed at how great it tasted. I will never fry eggplant after trying this recipe. My family loved it. it was alot more work then I had anticipated but well worth the effort. Will make this again soon.

Absolutely fantastic. I'd never fixed eggplant before and was a little wary. I'm about to fix this dish for the second time in two weeks! If you can, make your own tomato sauce with perfectly ripe tomatoes. I think that made a big contribution to this dish.

OMG!!!  This was absolutely delicious.  I peeled and sliced the eggplant thin, salted well and let set for 30 minutes.  Rinsed very well and patted dry, dipped in egg and rolled in Italian bread crumbs.  Baked in oven til crisp on both sides, layered in casserole dish with a 5 cheese sauce (from jar) covered  with the two cheeses called for but ii between the two layers I made a layer of sauteed mushrooms, topped off the top layer of cheese with sweet basil and italian seasoning.  No complaints at all !!!!!

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  I have prepared it several times already for friends, family, and even a potluck and every time I make it I get asked for the recipe.  

I have made a few alterations along the way based on some great tips from the other comments I found here.  I salted the peeled and sliced eggplant to let it "sweat" and then rinsed and dried it before baking it and it helped cut down on the bitterness some.  Also, I added grated parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs (about 1/4 cup) and a jar and a half of marinara sauce (I've found Newman's Own Tomato and Basil to be amazing in this recipe).  

This recipe gets 5 stars for turning even the most dedicated chicken lover into an eggplant parmesan fanatic. (

This recipe is great. I actually ran out of bread crumbs and used crushed French's Fried Onions and it turns out fantastic! I took the advise of the earlier reviews and had to cook the eggplant longer. In addition I used egg beaters for the egg wash. Absolutely fantastic!

Delicious- who needs to eat out when you have this recipe.  I salted the peeled slices for 30 minutes an followed the recipe exactly using my favorite jarred spaghetti sauce.  Fantastic!!  My neighbor grew te eggplants and three were perfect.  I see more eggplants in her back yard and can't wait for her to offer more.  Yum Yum!!

Ok. I really used this as a base recipe, because I love my fresh herbs and vegetables. So I grow my own eggplant  and can my own tomato sauce and spaghetti sauce. I used both of those, and threw in some home grown marjoram and oregano. Then I topped it with fresh basil. My husband said it tasted like a true italian dish. He Loved It.

This my absolute favorite way to make eggplant parmesan. Baking, not frying the eggplant helps make it a bit more healthier. This is my meatless Monday favorite.

Excellent!! I did take others advise to salt, drain and dry the eggplant slices. I also used homemade whole wheat fresh bread crumbs with Mrs. Dash Tomato, basil and garlic liberally mixed in along with some salt. I also used egg whites only.  I added skim milk ricotta and used  2%  milk mozzarella and regular parmesan.

Wonderful dish!  Even my picky 4 y/o ate the eggplant after the initial cooking before adding the sauce to it.  Scaled it back to 3 servings since I had only 1 medium eggplant.  I sweat the eggplant for 30 minutes with salt prior to breading (rinsed and dried well).  I used Panko bread crumbs and added my own italian seasoning.  Made 3 layers in the dish.  This is such a great way to cook eggplant.  Would give it more stars if I could!

Great dish because it's healthier than the classic version and because it so hearty. This would be a great dish to try on someone who demands meat at every meal.  I didn't parboil of salt my eggplant before baking.  I did bake it longer...about 14 minutes but everything else stayed the same

OMG...absolutely amazing. First time making it, and it was a great success. Totally worth the tedious preparation (I'm used to a low 10-15 min prep time myself). Will definitely add this into my list of favorite dishes. Five stars all the way. :)

This was really good! I only used 1 med/large eggplant and made it in a 8x8 dish and it was just enough for myself for a few days! I did do the salt process with the eggplant, but I don't think I cut them thin enough because they weren't as soft as they should be. Maybe I also shouldve baked them longer too. Like 10 mins on each side. And I would bake the entire dish longer too. But overall still delicious! Will be making again! (I also added a layer of mushrooms to it...yum!)

Scrumptious! Trying to watch my sodium, I didn't salt (sweat) the eggplant as others have suggested. I used a regular sized lower sodium spaghetti sauce and mixed it about 50/50 with no salt added tomato sauce and it sttill came out great! ! I found spraying EVO on both the pan and on top of breaded slices helps them to brown better (I also used higher heat 375 for browning) and browning about 10 min each side., and lowered back to 350 for final baking of the finished product. Fun, easy and healthier way to enjoy a comfort classic!  Thanks for the greeat recipe!

This is a keeper. I added some browned sausage. Followed all of the rest of the directions exactly. The whole family loved it including my son who turned his nose up when I said we were having eggplant for dinner.

As a new chef (studying abroad and missing my US college's dining hall), I was nervous to try a dish that I have always revered as tricky...but it was simple! For me, it was time consuming...but I'm new, so I'm slow. 
I had to convert all of the measurements myself, as the converter was not working well. Even with too much tomato sauce, this was simply delicious!
My friend asked me for the recipe!

Definitely follow the recommendations to let the eggplant slices "sweat" in salt and then be rinsed an dried before coating. And cook for 8-10 mins on each side.

A winner!!
:)

Loved this - ate the leftovers for days and still good.  I followed the tips of several earlier reviewers.  First I salted, drained and rinsed my peeled sliced eggplant.  After breading, I baked it in a hot oven for about 10 minutes or so on each side to get it crispy.  Finally, I made my eggplant parm into "stacks", as another reviewer suggested, instead of layering them into a entire casserole dish.  I really liked doing it this way because it was easy to separate into individual portions (No cutting the slices) without destroying the layers.  This was very useful to me as I saved so much of it for leftovers.  I also made sure my jarred sauce was yummy and spiced it up (added garlic, red pepper flakes, herbs, etc.) to my taste before using.  As usual, I used more cheese than the recipe calls for.  And, next time I make this, I'm going to take one more suggestion and make a lot of extra breaded and baked slices to freeze so that it will be even faster to put together thereafter.

This recipe was a hit!  I followed the recipe and did not have to 'sweat' my eggplant.  We had a guest over tonight who loved it and my husband even said (and I quote) "Honey, this is one of my new favorite meals".

What a great dish when one is pressed for time!  Made my quickie sauce and came across this recipe to accompany the spagetti...  my husband loved it, and this is healthier than frying the eggplant.  I used one eggplant, and it's all gone!  Will make this again.

I'm not sure if this is healthy, but it's definitely easy and delicious! Great quick meal for last-minute dinner party :) I follow the directions from other recipes on this site for salting the cut eggplant to sweat out the bitter flavor for 30min before rinsing in cold water, patting dry, and breading it.

Easy and much healthier than frying.  I added fresh garlic and salt in the egg mixture before dipping the eggplant in.  I also seasoned the eggplant with salt and pepper. Since I had fresh cilantro handy, I included that with the sauce.  Very good!

I am certainly glad that I read the comments before cooking!  DO sweat the eggplant - salt, soak, rinse, pat dry w/paper towels. DO slice the eggplant thin and bake for 10-15 minutes at 450 degrees and DO bake the put together dish for 45 minutes to an hour.  I am NOT a cook, very new and trying to learn and following these steps made it de-lish!  My boyfriend LOVED it and so did I!

I should have read the reviews. The top pieces were undercooked spongy and a bit bitter even after baking on each side for 7 minutes and heating the whole dish for 45. But I will make it again, next time I will just cook them for 5-7 minutes at 450 to brown them and give myself an hour to bake the dish. Also, 2 eggplants was all i had and I made a 4 layer 8x12 casserole.

I didn't bother with the salt and the draining recommended by other reviewers, and it was absolutely delicious anyway, no bitterness at all. I used huge black eggplants (as opposed to skinny Chinese eggplants), and the breaded slices were so big that I used a few of them, sliced thicker, for burgers the next day. Amazing. Baked eggplant is my new favourite thing.

Followed others' advice about sweating the eggplant (let stand for 1/2 hour in collander, coated with salt. then rinse and pat dry with paper towels). Needed longer to cook though—maybe 15 min. at 425 each side

My picky 10 year old said, what kind of meat is this mom, it is good. I told him mock chic.. and he ate. I knew if he knew it was eggplant, he would not eat it. I did salt the eggplant and let set for an hour, then rinsed thoroughly.

Great recipe! I love eggplant Parmesan. This is my 1st time cooking with eggplant. I would definitely make this again, the other reviews helped. I salted the eggplant and it came out great. I think it is easier to make than chicken Parmesan.

This was amazing my husband said it was like a gourmet meal. He wants to invite friends and have me serve this. I served on the same plate a piece of baked sweet potato and a serving of kale for vegetables. Looked so colorful.

Although Dad said I can make this any time, I probably won't.  It was not worth the trouble breading all the eggplant pieces.  I had never tasted eggplant before, and wasn't sure whether it's okay or terrible (which has no reflection on this recipe).  The proportions are not correct.  I used about 4.5 cups sauce, and I had enough eggplant for 3 layers.  Also, 2 eggs were not enough for the breading step and I had to use 3.  The breading did not get crispy in 10 minutes, and it did not stay on the eggplant, either.  It took much longer than 25 minutes to prepare (maybe I'm just slow).  Now I know why Mom never served eggplant while I was growing up--it's just not worth the effort.  Unless you LOVE eggplant, stick with lasagna for a cheesy, saucy casserole.

I cooked this recipe last week and it was awesome!!!   I also cooked some Italian sausage in the oven while preparing and baking this and then cut it up in little bites size pieces and dropped it all over the top.  It gave it an added flavor and it was well received.  The pan was cleaned out and they are asking when I will make it again.  :)

YUM! Loved the cheesy-ness of it all - next time though I would cut into rounds & after baking them, I want to spoon sauce & sprinkle cheese on each round, not covering them fully so you still get the crunch of the bread crumbs.

Also, I used panko (Japanese bread crumbs) - it made it light and delicious!

Delicious!!!  I sweat the eggplant first and followed the rest of the instructions, other than cooking time.  I allowed 9-10 min. per side.  I had some feta cheese that I wanted to get rid of, so I crumbled some on each slice with a dash of oregano, it was delicious.

Made this dish only because I had eggplant from a co-op and didn't know what else to fix. My husband enjoyed the meal as well as all my co workers did the next day. Does need some salt and I thought was even better the next day after it sat over night. Will make again. Extra cheese a must.

Loved this dish, my family loved this dish. I did follow the advise of one of the reviews in baking the eggplant for 20 mins, 10 mins on each side vs the 5 mins and used the Classico tomato and basil sause it was delicious and nutritious. I will definitely prepare this dish again. Thanks Doery

Ok, so this was my first attempt at eggplant parmesan after I had it at a restaurant and loved it.... I love the recipe, BUT.... who is this recipe trying to feed??? LOL... I did this with 1 eggplant and ate for three days! 

anyway.. great recipe! I took the advice of several others and sweated the eggplant for thirty minutes. followed the instructions and the first day the eggplant was pretty undercooked. reviews were so-so... 

the second day I put it back in the oven(covered) for an additional hour at about 400 and the eggplant came out very tender and the dish was awesome! definitely cook it longer than is stated...

I still give it five stars because the recipe is delicious! if you like a more tender eggplant (like me), cook it longer than stated. 

I'll definitely make it again....

This is by far the best eggplant parmesan recipe I have ever made- and I've made a few- I made my own tomato sauce which was super easy- just tomatoes, onion, garlic and salt and used fresh mozzerella cheese- I omitted the dried basil- so good!

though i modified the recipe..its a great base.  I made an egg wash and Dipped 12 slices of eggplant into it.  Next into breadcrumbs with a dash of salt, pepper and oregano.  Baked it in a pan lightly oiled, first side 20 mins; next side for 15 mins or until golden brown.
Sauce: ground turkey with minced garlic and onions and jar of prepared sauce
Arrangement:eggplant, sauce and mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese x2
baked for about 25 mins or until cheese is melted. 
Served it with garlic spaghetti.
YUMMY! My bf loved it and went for seconds.
Next time i'm thinking of adding a spinach and feta mixture in the middle to add more flavor and use beef instead of turkey with a can of tomato sauce.

I'm not a big eggplant person, but this had really good flavor.  Slicing the eggplant really thin helped cook it through better (I think at least).  Used feta cheese instead of parmesan as well as fresh basil; it added really great flavor.

This is a really easy, quick, and delicious recipe! And since you're baking the eggplant instead of frying, its much healthier. And no need to do all that soaking of the eggplant like with other eggplant parmesans. Add salad, crusty french bread, red wine, and you have a GREAT meal!  Thank you Doery!

This recipe is very basic and needs a lot of work. I used 2 large eggplants and that was almost too much.  I needed three beaten eggs.  I used homemade sauce and fresh mozzarella and topped with fresh basil.

My go-to dish to fix for my vegetarian husband when company is coming. If you can get nice fresh eggplant - think farmers' market - I find I don't need to sweat the slices of eggplant before baking. If from the grocery store out of season, I will salt the eggplant, leave in colander for 20 min, then rise and pat dry, before dipping in the egg and bread crumbs. Three small/med eggplants make a bit more than my 9X13 pan, so I make a mini dish for the freezer that is just enough for my husband and I some night when there is no time to cook. I highly recommend this recipe.

I agree with what some many other reviewers said, cook the eggplant longer on each side before assembling the casserole.

I surely was drawn to this recipe because of the no fry eggplant and the finished dish more than met our expectations.  Baking eggplant keeps them firmer, which truly enhances the dish.  Scrumptious, easy to make.  Our two year old grandson even tasted a bite or three and kept it in his mouth!

Oh, my goodness!  This is AWESOME!  I've never tried eggplant before and this is a fabulous recipe.  The 10 min. cooking time per side is right on.  I didn't "sweat" mine, though.  My kids said that I could make this recipe anytime - and they are choosy eaters!  I used Primo's Tomato Basil spaghetti sauce and it blended well with the basil in the topping.  I am definitely making this again!!!

This recipe was good.  I found that the eggplant needs to be cut a little thinner so that it will be more tender.

Very yummy. I didn't sweat the eggplant but I did cook each side of the eggplant on 375 for 10 minutes and I cooked the dish as a whole for about 45 minutes.

I prepared this dish much as one of the other reviewers, using a base of pasta with the baked eggplant, sauce, and cheese layered on top. Half a 24oz jar of spaghetti sauce should be about right, and bake until the cheese is golden brown.

This dish was not worth the very long time it took to make and cook. I followed the directions, and others' advice, and discovered the following: 
1) More egg is needed (4 eggs, not 2); 
2) Fewer breadcrumbs are needed (2 cups, not 4); 
3) Baking for 60 minutes gives a very dark, almost burned look to the top;
4) The eggplant came out too salty -- although I did salt the eggplant and let it sit, I also rinsed it well afterwards. Still, it seemed salty to me.
5) The whole process of making this dish took hours. Though my husband said it was tasty, I only liked it (didn't love it). All in all, I don't think this dish was worth the time and painstaking steps.

Just my two cents.

AWESOME dish.  I actually changed  a lot though, since I just made it from stuff that was in my fridge and pantry.  Substituted panko for bread crumbs but seasoned with Italian herbs and parmesan.  Also substitued marscapone for mozzarella and will continue to do so next time.  It made the sauce incredibly rich and creamy!  Used fresh basil instead of dry.  My husband loved it too, and told me to stick with the changes I made.

Oh my gosh!  SO GOOD!!  I had a reduced sourdough loaf of bread from Wal-Mart and toasted slices then put it in the blender to make crumbs.  Put the crumbs on cookie sheet in oven at 350 for 15 min or so to dry out some more...  Added dried oregano, basil, and garlic to the bread crumbs.  Other than that, I did everything the recipe said.  YUMMO!  Served portion atop angel hair pasta.  My daughter actually said, YOU need to make this again!

This was awesome!  My husband and 4 y/o liked it too.  I used 1 eggplant.  Sweated it for 30 mins, rinsed and dried.  Then coated it with breadcrumbs and parmesan.  I baked on a pan coated with cooking spray at 425 for 7 mins on one side, 5 mins the other side.  It was PERFECTLY brown.  Then layered in a small casserole dish and heated through at 400 degrees for 20 mins.

This is very good but I have to admit I actually fry the coated eggplant in oil first and then proceed with this recipe. I only use homemade sauce as well as the premade jar sauce is just not the same. I also use a tons of mozz. too.... and yes it is rich but worth it and even tastes better the next day!

This was so good!  I used fresh buffalo mozzarella because that is what I had on hand.   I just put it on top (so no cheese in the middle)  and it turned out really great.  I can't believe how easy this was.

Amazing! I am studying to be a Nutrionist so I modified it a little more; I used eggwhites instead of eggs, left out the Parmesan, used organic mozzarella, and made my own sauce packed full of veggies..great base recipe :)

We really liked this.  I read a lot of the previous reviews first and took the advice of others to sweat the eggplant first.  I used all 3 eggplants that were suggested, but I feed an army, and there was enough for about 12 servings.  I did however use more cheeses and sauce.  I also used the Italian 6 cheese blend instead of just the mozzerella, and I think I may use some garlic next time.  I also chose to use fresh chopped basil instead of dried.  I also would love to try this again with homemade sauce.  I did, however find that this recipe (and the amount I was making) took longer than I had anticipated to make, so my poor husband ate his eggplant parmesean on a piece of garlic bread as he was going out the door to work.

easy and yummy, I was too lazy to peel, cut up the eggplant into pieces and sweated them with kosher salt for 10 minutes before putting them into the oven as people had recommended.  Came out great!  Also diced an onion, sauteed it, and added it to a tomato sauce layer, which gave it a nice flavor!

Very tastey! I am not a big fan of eggplant but this recipe made me forget I was eating it.  It was a bit time consuming (I made my own bread crumbs from some frozen ends) but definitely worth it.

I followed the recipe exactly as it is and was not impressed.  The eggplant was bland with just the seasoned breadcrumbs. The texture was too firm, and there was way too much sauce.  The dried basil on top added no flavor.

Salting and rinsing the eggplant is a must. Also I baked the eggplant on a rack at 425 for 10 min and the rack eliminated the need for me to flip the slices. Did add drained cottage cheese with fresh Italian herbs between the eggplant layers.

3 large eggplant was way too much.  I used my big deep lasagna pan for this one, and still had 4 layers up to the top.  Because of mass amounts of eggplant, I felt like the dish really lacked that saucey, cheesy goodness.  I only had 6 cups of sauce on hand, and could have easily used 2 more.  I ended up using probably a full cup of parm cheese too.  I have to be honest, the recipe as-is was not very good.  The concept was ok, but if I were to make this again, I'll be making quite a few changes.

My husband is a steak and potatoes kinda guy, so I was really taking a chance making this and knew I had to get it right the first time! HE LOVED IT! In fact I am making it for the second time at his request! This makes me very happy :) Great recipe! I did however salt it before hand, the eggplant was very moist and not bitter at all.

Easy to make and excellent.  I also baked the slices a bit longer (about 9 minutes per side) before baking it all together.

This is a great recipe as is, I did add a layer of fresh cut tomatoes on top of the eggplant layer. It just seemed like a good add to this recipe. The whole family loved it. Thanks for sharing.

In the oven as we speak! Here is my experience... I was so excited to see some nice crispy breaded eggplant, I began to feel Italian. I drizzled the top with some Olive Oil, Italian Seasoning, Garlic Powder Salt, Dried Red Pepper, and as I sipped my wine, I realized that the aroma of what was already preparing smelt so delicious with the glass of white wine I was drinking. Yup, that's what I did. I drizzled as well, some delicious Chardonnay over the beautiful casserole. ... The smell right now is unbelievable. My husband came home and immediately questioned the great smell in the kitchen.. A WINNER. don't forget the fresh basal on top.:)

i made this dish last night and it was excellent. i added little mounds of ricotta in between layers and put fresh sliced mozz in addition to shredded on the top layer. i needed way more than 2 eggs, probably 6 or so and i had so many eggplant slices that i had to make two dishes.  I will make this again! it was fantastic and pretty simple. i though that i would lose some flavor by baking the eggplant, but that was not the case.

I love this no fry recipe!  Next time I'll cut slits down the eggplant before I slice it b/c the skin was tough to cut, but otherwise I am definitely making this recipe again.  Thanks!

As other reviewers stated, the amount of eggs to coat the eggplant is way too low.  Be prepared to use several more.  I also thought that the amount of breadcrumbs that was asked for was outrageous (especially given the low egg count).  I coated each slice as thick as I could and ended up sprinkling the rest into the dish just so I wouldn't waste it.  I used the Safeway Brand Garlic Marinara, and to my surprise, it had huge cloves of garlic in the sauce, which I thought really added to the dish.  Overall, this dish was pretty good.

This was way too saucy, next time I'd cut back.  I also had to use more bread crumbs and eggs than were suggested, but overall it was a decent meal.

Too many modifications were needed to make this work, thats why only three stars. Only 2 eggs? I needed at least double that number to adequately coat the eggplant slices. I also kept the slices in the skillet for double the time called for. Other changes were personal, (such as more cheese than the recipe states), and shouldn't be seen as necessary.   Once the changes were made it was a great dish.

This was an easy recipe. My wife has gluten aleergy and I did not have gluten free bread crumbs on hand and could not find in the local store. I decided to use rice crispies crumbled in the blender added Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese. we enjoyed the left overs the next day.

Made this tonight for my house and gave a pan to my friend....yes this makes a lot. Anyhow this was delish and I didn't change a thing. However I did take other reviewers suggestion and sweated the eggplant with salt for about 30 minutes. Thanks very good recipe.

This recipe was very yummy. I did change some things, Instead of all breadcrumbs, I did half Panko and half italian bread crumbs. I baked the eggplant at 400 for about 20 minutes, turning once. I fixed some speghetti with it, and put the eggplant on top. all in all it was very yummy! will definetly make this again. althought it is a job to do! worth it in the end!!!

I have never cooked eggplant before and have only recently acquired a taste for it.  I took the suggestions of soaking it in salt water as I had to cut away some brown from the eggplant and was worried about bitterness.  It is out of this world!  I absolutely love it!  I made chicken Parmesan for my husband using the same process which is also very good. He will love both, I guarantee!

This was amazing! SO SO good! I had to stop my dad from over eatting! I used rice chex mix instead to cut down on the fat and make it gluten free. No one knew. I sprinkled italian seasoning in it since i didnt use italian seasoned bread crumbs.  This recipe makes a lot; I cut the recipe down only using 1 eggplant and its perfect for 2 to 3 people. This recipe has made it into my exclusive recipe scrap book; will make again and again. (This is a pretty fool proof recipe)

yum! i just baked the eggplant because I couldn't get a hold of any bread crumbs, but it was still great. I also used a basil/garlic spaghetti sauce because I didn't have any dried basil.

Great recipe, I added to the breading  1 cup of Panko Parmesan Herb bread crumbs, and for some added crunch, 1/2 cup of Kellogg's Corn Flake Crumbs.  I also used fresh chopped basil.  YUMMY!!!!!

I wasn't sure what to do with a giant eggplant we had, so i gave this a whirl. Even my wife loved it, and she's not a big fan of eggplant.   Also... Leftovers were just as good!

The only suggestion I would make, is that if you're using smaller eggplants, you will need more egg to coat the pieces.

Sweating the eggplant, then rinsing/patting dry each slice is a LOT of work.  That alone took me a few hours!  I only used 2 big eggplants, because 3 seemed like too much, and that was plenty!    It does taste really good... not better than Maggiano's, which still has my favorite Eggplant Parmesan.    It's just SO much work for one dish.  I began making this around 7:30 and it wasn't complete until around 10:30.    In sum:  It tastes good, but I'm not sure that it's worth all the hassle (if you follow the suggestions regarding sweating the eggplant and then rinsing/drying each slice with paper towels, which I think you pretty much have to do).

I made this yesterday, it was DELICIOUS! I used jar sauce, but doctored it up with shallots, mushrooms, fresh basil and parsley and garlic. I also layered as followed: sauce, eggplant, prosciutto, fresh sage, eggplant, sauce all over everything and then fresh mozzarella. It was absolutely delicious! The prosciutto was so unnecessary, but added a little extra flavor. Oh, I also sweated the eggplant with salt for 30 minutes ahead of time. I can't wait to eat some leftovers for lunch!

I put sea salt on the sliced eggplant for 30 minutes and washed, dryed before I battered.  I cooked for 9 mins on each side.  I used fresh basil instead of dried as well.

Made this last night for my family and they LOVED it. The only thing I did differently is that I cooked the eggplant for about 10 mins on each side and I didn't use 3 whole eggplants either.

Sorry, I wasn't impressed, tho' I did the recipe as called for.  Hubby refused to even taste it.  I will not be making this one again as I have made better tasting in the past, but I thank you for sharing it.

This was very delicious. I did not peel the eggplant, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I did find that when the eggplant was crisping it needed a little more time (maybe 7-8 minutes each side) and I also broiled them for about 2 minutes -- I like mine crispy! Great alternative to the fried version, my husband always orders eggplant parm in restaurants and he loved this. Good leftover too.

I followed recipe exactly. It had great flavor and was easy but eggplant wasn't cooked nearly long enough. I would suggest taking the extra time to "sweat" the eggplant too.

We had never eaten eggplant before and nobody wanted to be the first to take a bite but my 13 year old son ended up having 3 plates. It was an excellent recipe. Easy to follow and loved by all. Thank you for sharing!

Great!  We used tiny 4-inch eggplants from our garden.  I did not peel them.  Used fresh basil.  Easy.

This was so good.  I used a lot less cheese than suggested, and ended up with a very light, and delicious dinner. My boyfriend absolutely loved it.  I'm sure he'll ask me to make it again very soon.

I'm giving this five stars because I'm sure it's delicious as stated, but I did make some changes to make it a bit healthier, and it was soooo good! First, I used egg whites instead of whole eggs. Next, I used a plain bread crumb and oatmeal mixture seasoned with dried Italian herbs (only about 2 cups). I omitted the Parmesan cheese and just used 1 package low-fat mozzarella. I also layered fresh, raw broccoli florets during the baking stage, which added a very nice veg. I'll try using homemade, low-sodium tomato sauce next time. Served it over whole-wheat pasta. DELICIOUS!! I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!!

Made this for my family and my 11 year old LOVED it so much she ate the most that night, then ate all the left overs and begged for it in her lunch. I'm not Italian but my hubby is and it's his most favorite- he even likes it better then what his Grandmother makes. Shhhh. Don't tell.

I tried all the tips listed by previous users--letting the eggplant "sweat", cutting evenly, baking additional minutes, making sure it was all covered with sauce, etc . . . and the eggplant was still hard and bitter.  I'm removing this from my recipe box and won't make again.  Sorry--

This is really good if you bake 10 minutes on each side at 450.  There is nothing wrong with this recipe other than it didn't wow me.  Maybe make a homemade sauce and fry them in olive oil to get the wow factor.

Loved this! Tastes incredible, especially over pasta. I made it gluten free by using GF bread crumbs and Brown Rice Pasta. YUM. I like it even better with some onion powder, garlic powder, and dried parmesan added into the bread crumb mixture. It's a keeper!

I follwed the recipe exactly how it said except I baked the eggplant a little longer than five minutes. I cooked it for about ten minutes on each side. I thought the recipe was really good but I have another recipe for eggplant parmesan that you bake as well and takes less time. I enjoyed this recipe but I like my other one better. Thank you for sharing.

So. Very. Delicious.  Next time I'll make more servings (cut it down because I only had one eggplant) because it tasted ridiculously good the next day re-heated.

Very good. I only gave it 4 stars because, while it was good, it wasn't very unusual or special. But we WILL make it again.

Simple, healthy, inexpensive, delicious.  I also sweated the slices as previously described.  I decided not to make the casserole.  Instead, I added the parm cheese to the bread crumbs.  I baked the breaded eggplant on a cookie sheet for about 30 mins turning half way.  Then I served it like chicken parm with sauce and mozzarella cheese on top.  I also added some portabella mushrooms to some store bought sweet basil sauce for a twist.  The eggplant was tender in the middle and crispy on the outside.  Husband rated it 10/10, yummy!

This was my first time making eggplant parmesan.  Overall, I was very pleased with the results.  I must admit I was alittle nervous at first because the coated eggplant did not brown at all, but I continued as directed. Please not this is default for 10 servings.  I did not realize this until I was half way through, way too much for me.  I had to use a 11X15 pan.  You will definitely need more than two eggs (I used about 5).  The last layer of eggplant I topped with a thin layer of sauce then cheese (recipe didn't specify).  The prep time was well over an hour (mostly prepping eggplant) for me.  To reduce prep timely greatly have atleast two extra large cooking sheets on hand.  This will cut your time in half.  Great taste with no additional seasoning needed!

Pretty good at first, but overall, the eggplant taste was way too strong.  I couldn't eat more than a single small serving for my meal.  Had to toss the rest because my family doesn't like eggplant.  Grr.

I've never had let alone cooked eggplant, but this recipe was delicious! I followed the advice of others and sweating the eggplant for about 25 minutes and cooking it for 10 minutes on each side.  It really turned out great and I will absolutely be making it again.

Oh man this was good.  I did put a few twists on the base recipe but it was great.  I used a couple of food-processored cans of fire roasted tomatoes with around 7 large basil leaves instead of premade sauce.  I also seasoned my own panko breading instead of premade crumbs.  I snuck some zucchini in with the eggplant - yum!  And I also picked up a small nub of a dry italian cheese from my grocer's artisan cheese extras basket.  I guess my point is that you can customize according to what is in your own cupboard.  I served it with a Malbec and it was nice :)

Fabulous...I just made this for myself, so only used one eggplant and made my own tomato sauce - canned tomatoes, garlic, basil, oregano, sugar, salt/pepper, sundried tomatoes, tomato paste....I also salted my eggplant before using and that seemed to be good. I followed the advise on here and cooked it for longer than 5 min on each side.....This turned out perfect, was really easy, and I will definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe!!

I think the overall outcome of your final product has a lot to do with the kind of sauce you use. To avoid any soggy pieces I would take about 2/3 of the pasta sauce and simmer it down a bit then use the leftover sauce for the top layer.

This was great!  I followed suggestions of other reviewers and sweated the eggplant using sea salt for 30 minutes, and then rinsing and patting dry.  I only used one very large eggplant.  I also upped the oven temp to 400 degrees, and baked it for 5 minutes per side.  Then, because of time, I asslembled it as instructed and then microwaved it for 12 minutes on high, turning halfway through.  Served it with pasta and it was a huge hit!

Wonderful recipe!!! I cannot say that enough. My husband and I had never even tried Eggplant and we were blown away by how tasty it was. My 3 daughter even loved it!    I did salt it and let it set 30 mins in a strainer, then rinsed before breading as the other reviews have recommended to help take the bitterness out. And it did need 10 mins on each side other than 5, as this recipe says.     If you are looking for a wonderful vegetarian dish, this will not dissapoint!

Made this for Good Friday. Very nice! The only extra thing I did was, like most people, sprinkle the sliced eggplant with salt and let it sit for 30 minutes. Hubby said the skin was a bit tough, so probably will take it out next time.

1st time I have made Egg Plant, read the reviews after preparing... should have sweated the egg plant to get rid of the bitter taste. This recipe makes WAYYYY... too many servings! Gave away half and still have leftovers from the other half. 2 Eggs is not enough for 3 Egg Plant and we threw away ALOT of bread crumbs! Also the temp should be more like 400 and 7-10 min on each side. Used vegetable oil spray when the egg plant refused to go brown, next time will coat sheet in olive oil. And cook time will be more like 45 minutes. Didn't want to use dried Basil so used 1/2 cup fresh basil and mixed it with 15oz Ricotta, 2 eggs, mozzarella,and parmesan. Was pretty good the way we made it, husband said if chicken was in it, it would have been the best chicken parmesan he'd ever had. Next time will sweat egg plant.

In my opinion that was NOT as good as the original version that frys the eggplant first.  I sweated the eggplant slices first, then followed the recipe exactly.  It may be more healthful but not as tasty.  3 eggplants are a TON of the vegetable to my way of thinking, unless they are pretty smallish.

Great recipe! I've never dealt with eggplant before, so I was a little nervous.  This was very easy.  I used a plastic bag for the coating of egg and a little of the breading.  I also pre-treated the eggplant like many reviewers suggested with a little salt for about 20 minutes, then washed. GREAT dish. My husband, who usually is not fond of eggplant, loved it!

Great Recipe- I did sweat the eggplant but that added a lot of time and work.  The proportions seemed to be off.  I used one large eggplant.  I needed 3 eggs and 1.5 cups of bread crumbs.  I baked the eggplant at 450 for 7 minutes on each side.  I used two 9x13 pans so I did't have to layer the eggplant.  The eggplant was't mushy at all.

Amazing! I went to a party with several vegetarians and everyone was complimenting me on the eggplant. If you slice the eggplant widthwise (into little patties) they are also very good beef patty replacements for a vegetarian alternative to regular burgers.

Was cooking for my husband and I, and one eggplant was more than enough, it could have served atleast 5 people! I used some garlic and herb bread crumbs mixed with italian and my favorite pasta sauce Ragu tomato garlic and onion (26 oz). I also grated my own parmesan cheese, I think it's way beter than the store bough brands. I had some leftover bread crumbs from coating the eggplant so I sprinkled some on top of the cheese before baking it.  The last few minutes I turned the broiler on to brown up the cheese nicely.

I gave this 3 stars.  If you are looking for a healthy alternative to frying the eggplant, I give it 4 stars.  I sweated the eggplant as suggested, used 1/2 panko crumbs and 1/2 Italian bread crumbs, and boosted the heat (375) and cook time of the breaded eggplant to 10 mins each side.  I was hoping for a "crispier" result.  I do not care for soggy foods and some of the reviews had me concerned. Unfortunalty, it was still soggy.  If your looking for a 5 star recipie, fry the eggplant and serve with your favorite homemade sauce.

Ok well I am new to the whole eggplant recipes, but my husband LOVED IT! He rated it a 4.5 stars, my 1.5 yr. old LOVED IT as well. I made a few changes first I had no bread crumbs so i made my own(I used whole wheat bread toasted it for a few minutes then added it along with garlic powder, ground black pepper, onion powder, and dried basil then blended it for 20 sec or so in the blender the smell is wonderful) I used egg whites instead of the whole eggs. But other than that I made it like the directions said and it came out nicely, I just guess I am not that fond of eggplant...

This was really good.  I'm a particularly lazy cook, so I put the slices in the oven and forgot about them, so they ended up cooking at least 20 minutes per side.  This actually caused the eggplant slices to be rather crisp, a quality I liked.  I used Classico basil and tomato spaghetti sauce and a can of Hunts fire roasted diced tomatoes.  I put on an italian 5-blend cheese mix I had and some extra high quality Parmesan, freshly grated.  I baked it a little long (for about 40-45 mins) with no problems.  I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent.  I made this with chicken parmesan for a small group of people.  The eggplant Parmesan was the first to go and the people who thought they wouldn't like it, loved it!  The only difference I did was fry the eggplant initially on the stove and than kept in the oven to stay hot before I put it all together.    This way my whole meal was complete at the same time.  excellent!

I liked the idea of not frying the eggplant, but my entire family realized immediately the difference in taste.  I think this is one dish that makes a difference - to fry or not the fry - that is the question?!

I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I crushed Ritz and added my own Italian seasoning and garlic to it. Other than that, I kept the recipe the same. It came out great and I even had left overs, which heated up in the microwave at work pretty well.

This recipe was okay... I personally think it tastes better frying the eggplant in olive oil rather than baking it.  It's unhealthier, but mine didn't get crispy like it does when you fry it and that affected the end result of the dish.  It came out mushier than when it's fried first.  It's not a terrible dish, but I just don't see how everyone thinks its so much better than the traditional way.  I also tried breading my eggplant in a gallon-sized plastic bag and while it was cleaner and easier, I don't think it coated the eggplant as well as doing them individually on a plate.  I'm going to stick to my good old-fashioned recipe, even though it's a little unhealthier.  I might try Bobby Flay's version on the Food Network site, if I want to try a different version next time.  The eggplant is fried, too!  Nice attempt, though, at making a traditionally unhealthy dish healthier.

I do not normally care for Eggplant Parmesan, but this was amazing!  I made this dish because my boyfriend requested it for Thanksgiving.  I did not bother measuring out the sauce and cheese, instead I just went by how much I wanted to put on (I ended up using way more than the recipe called for).  I also followed the advice of others and sweated out the eggplant before proceeding with the breading (excellent suggestion), and I baked the breaded eggplant in the oven for about 15 minutes to let them really crisp up - I think that is what makes this recipe.  The eggplant is not totally soggy and bitter, and everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner (even the turkey eaters) really enjoyed it.  This one is a keeper.

Excellent!  I fixed it tonight and I'm eating it right now.  I made angel hair pasta and am eating it topped with the eggplant parmesan.  There are a couple changes I'll make next time, though. 1) I will sweat the eggplant, as suggested by others.  2) I will also bake the eggplant longer in the beginning.  Perhaps 7-8 minutes on each side.  This is a wonderful recipe and I will definitely be using it again!

WOW! This was amazing! This was my first time ever cooking with eggplant and I am so pleased. I took advice from other reviewers and did the sea salt thing. I was out of bread crumbs so I used crushed up Rice Crispies and Italian seasonings. The breading didn't stay on as well as I had hoped but in the end it didn't matter.   This is amazingly delicious!! Make it for dinner tonight!!!

This was very tasty.  It is a bit time intensive.  I have always been told (and followed as a rule) that eggplant needs to be drained with salt to get the best out of it.  So I salted and then washed off the eggplant before hand.  I also sliced some zucchini and then followed the same steps as the eggplant.  I found, like many, that the baking time needed to be increased.  Also I found that leaving the whole thing to bake longer was better too.

Good recipe.  My husband really enjoyed it.  The first time I made it, I used the egg dip.  The second time I did not use it and the coating stuck pretty good.  So, I don't think I would use the egg anymore.  Also, I pan fried my eggplant instead of baking.

This is so yummy! I was a little nervous to try this because I have never cooked with eggplant, but it was delicious. I didn't do too much different, just spices and eggplant crunchiness to my liking. Thanks so much!

This was good, although I personally think frying it gets a better flavor (really, what isn't better fried?)  As odd as it sounds, the eggplant flavor is a little too strong when you use this method.   Also, with just two eggplants I went through 5 eggs and three baking sheets worth of slices, cooked them 10 minutes on each side but it wasn't done after 35 minutes in the oven.  I still must not have cut the eggplant thin enough!  So for everyone making the recipe - cut the eggplant very very thinly!

I tried this recipe after reading all the great comments shared by others.  It tasted wonderful!  What a delicious and healthy meal it turned out to be!  As others had shared in their reviews, I "sweated" the eggplant for one hour, then I baked it for 20 minutes on the first side, then 15 minutes on the other side, so it wouldn't burn.  I also dipped the eggplant in flour AFTER the egg and BEFORE the Japanese PANKO bread crumbs I used (both also suggested by another reader).  It made a big difference in the taste.  Added a nice consistency to the dish.  For the pan, I used a 9 x 13 inch pyrex baking dish.  I followed directions except that I used three layers of eggplant, and added Ricotta cheese.  It was light to medium layers of Ragu sauce (a whole 64 oz. jar was used when I was through), prepared  eggplant, organic mozzarella cheese, Ricotta, basil and sauce on top to make three layers of each. It was a great success! I must say that when using the long oriental eggplant, it was very time consuming, but worth it.  It took me four hours from start to putting it in the oven to cook. I will defintely make it again. Now that I have, I can shorten the preparation time. I also think next time I will use marinara sauce instead of traditional tomato sauce.  Thanks to all for the previous reviews!

This was my first time using and eating eggplant and I really enjoyed it!  However, I will admit that after I pulled them out of the oven and tasted it I ended up frying them in olive oil to give it more flavor.  My husband HATES marinara sauce so he was skeptical of trying this.  He thought it was okay and our 2 year old ate seconds!  This is a great start to Eggplant Parmesan, but I think next time I will try making this differently... maybe a goat cheese and basil alfedo sauce instead of marinara... or even making a rosa sauce... I think my hubby would like it better, and it is just a creative way to use other cheeses and flavors along with eggplant... we shall see!!    Thank you for a fabulous recipe!!

This was my first time with eggplant..and I loved it! My boyfriend even liked it! I used only 1 very large eggplant and it was plenty for 4 or 5 large servings. I did sweat the eggplant with salt for 10 mins. I baked it on 450 for 10 mins on each side. I also added a can of stewed tomatos and mushrooms to the casserole. and I used a whole 8 oz bag of mozzarella. This was a delicious recipe that took exactly 1 hr.

I really enjoyed this recipe and it turned out marvelously. The pre-cooking of the breading on the egg-plant definitely helped to keep the breading on, though I did not short on sauce.  Thanks.

I was sooooo glad that this was as good as everyone on here was saying it was. I did do the salt and rinse before baking...and I baked each side at 425º for 7-8 minutes each. Out of my 5 kiddos, 3 of them LOVED it...and one of those was my 10 month old! :) I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

Overall, my meal team liked it.  The larger pieces of eggplant were still a little tough in the center, so I would recommend 7-8 per side in the oven.  Besides that it was well received, even by the guys who insist on meat at each meal.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent - so easy to make and I don't find eggplant easy to prepare.  I thought this was really good.  I'll make it again with some homemade sauce and fresh mozzarella and that will make it 10 stars.

Excellent; even my non-eggplant loving husband liked it! I also salted the eggplant and let it sit and baked eggplant in oven at 450 for 10 min per side.  I decreased the baking time of whole casserole to 20 min. and it was still fine (we were hungry and in a hurry!)  I used 3 eggs for dipping and removed the yolks from two.

This was awesome!  I did try to "bleed" the eggplant, but I'm not sure if it made any difference.  I only had table salt, and I simply sprinkled it on the eggplant for about 1/2 hr prior, and actually I forgot to wash it off.  I baked each side about 7 minutes (I did not want it crispy).  I didn't have as much mozzarella as called for, but it was still great.  I ended with a layer of sauce, a bit of paremsan, and a bit of mozzarella (instead of the eggplant being the top).  This was a favorite, and I will definitely recommend it!

This was absolutely divine.  I made it using spaghetti sauce that I made myself, which was meatless, not to take away from the eggplant flavour.  I didn't want to use storebought sauce, because what would be the point?  There's too much sodium in those sauces anyway. Make sure you use the best quality Mozzarella you can find because it really makes a difference, since you are using an important amount.  I used 4 small eggplants, and wished I had had more on hand, because it barely covered the sauce.  I didn't use basil because my sauce was already intensely flavoured. I used parsley instead.  I had a hard time browning the bread coating, so after 15 minutes, I switched the oven to broil and it quickly became golden.

Excellent - this tasted like Chicken Parm!  I made these changes: I halved the recipe.  Sliced 1/4", then sprinkled with sea salt, let sweat in collander for about an hour.  Rinsed well, then set in water for about 15 minutes.  Patted dry with paper towels. Breaded w/Italian bread crumbs. Put a couple tablespoons of olive oil on a cookie sheet and baked slices at 425 for 7 mins. on each side.  Lowered oven to 350.  Placed slices in a single layer in a 9x13 glass baking dish, homemade tomato sauce on top only (not on bottom), lots of shredded mozzeralla on top of each one, then sprinkled with the Parmesan and a little dried basil.  Baked at 350 for about 35 mins.  Very good!  Reheats just fine in the microwave.

Everyone in my family really liked this.  I did thicker slices of about 1 inch thick to give a meatier texture to the meal.  Increased baking time to about 12 minutes each side.  Love that there was no oil involved other than spraying the crumbs with some Pam to give it a nice crust.  Very healthy and tasty.

This was a good meatless option. I had to bake the eggplant for at least 10 minutes per side in order to get them crispy enough, and I topped it with fresh basil instead of dried. We liked it a lot.

This was very good - and quick and easy to make! Believe it or not I was in a hurry and forgot to add the parmesan cheese - and it was still excellent! I served it over pasta to make it a little more filling. Husband was happy and even took all the leftovers for lunch! Give it a try - you'll love it!

This was an excellent Eggplant Parmesan.  I followed many of the suggestions and cranked the oven up to 450 and baked the slices 7 minutes on each side. Then instead of layering the sauce and cheese, I layered all of the slices in the dish and then covered that with a layer of sauce and then cheese.  Then we sprinkled on fresh basil rather then dried.  Granted we were only using one eggplant, so it wasn't nearly as much.  Had we used the recommended number we probably would have layered.  Still an excellent and yummy dish.

I made mine tonight. I followed the recipe exact so I can judge it by the recipe and I think you do need to bake it on an oiled sheet.I will do that next time for sure but it was awesome just the way it is. Husband loved it also.

I made this recipe last week.  It was really good.  We had it on top of angel hair pasta.  The only thing I didn't like was that it took me about 1.5 hours to go through all the steps.  It felt like a lot of food.  I used 3 medium-small egg plants, and I think there are probably 8 servings.

Delicious, fresh eggplant from the farmer's market, a fairly simple prep, and Sunday night dinner was a snap!  I paired it with garden noodles and a fresh salad and it was a hit!!!!  My kids didn't even realize they were eating vegtables!

I made this recipe on Friday evening for my family. This was the first time I've had eggplant and it turned out soo well. My family really enjoyed it. I did sweat the slices first for about 30 mins. I breaded and baked them for about 20 mins. And then followed the recipe from there. It was really an awesome dish.

Outrageous. Best I've ever had anywhere. I sliced them  more like between 1/8 and 1/4" and sweated them. Baked the slices at 400 deg for 5 min/side. I think in a covection or electric oven 350 might work but in a gas oven it needs to be hotter.

I agree that this is an excellent dish.  I also salted the eggplant and baked 10 minutes per side.  It tasted great (how could that much cheese not?) but I shutter when I think about how many calories I ate!!

I didn't have breadcrumbs, so I cubed up some bread and threw oregano, basil, and salt in with the mix.  Next time I'll shred or cube the eggplant (picky eaters here) and stir the bread cubes with the egg and bake it together before returning it to a pan with parm, sauce and cheese (I didn't have mozz. so I substituted cheddar).  It turned out FANTASTIC!

My first time making eggplant parmesan and I don't normally eat it.  I was pleasantly surprised at the crispiness even though it was baked, but the eggplant was a little bitter in my opinion.

I really like this one - especially that it is baked, not fried.  I followed the recipe.  For the tomato sauce I used crushed tomatoes + basil & oregano + salt & pepper.  For the bread crumbs, I toasted bread and crumbled it in the food processor with a bit of cheese and herbs.

Really nice flavor and very easy.  The only downside was that there wasn't enough sauce.  It cooked down so much in the oven that I will need to open a new jar of sauce tomorrow night for the leftover eggplant.  But the flavor was soooo good.  I will definitely make this again, but will increase the sauce by 50%.

My husband and I both LOVE eggplant parmesan, and that is what we always order when we go to a particular Italian restaurant in our town. We have not been able to find a comparable recipe anywhere until now. Thank you so much for posting this!

I have never been an eggplant fan, however this recipe has changed that! Made my own tomato sauce and used smaller homegrown chinese eggplants. Much easier to make than I had expected.

My husband and I are meat eaters but I had tried eggplant parmesan before and liked it and eggplant was super cheap so I decided to give it a try.  I used 1 eggplant and we had enough for dinner and the leftovers went to work with my husband 2 days later for lunch.  We both loved it and my husband said it was even better as leftovers.  I'm buying more eggplant tomorrow before the sale is over ($0.55 each)  I did soak the slices in saltwater for 20 minutes before cooking.

Delicious!!!!  I made this the other night and it was a hit with my relatives from out of town and family.  I only used one eggplant and halfed the recipe but it was a large eggplant.  I didn't have any Italian seasoned bread crumbs in the house so I blended herb stuffing mix into a powder which worked out great.  My family LOVES cheese so I didn't bother measuring.  I also refrained from using basil because some members in the house don't care for it.  This turned out sooo good I can't wait to buy more eggplants.  THANKS!  A new family favorite.

This was my first time ever preparing eggplant, and we loved this recipe. My  9 year old claims it's one of the best dinners I've ever made.  I did not tell her it was eggplant until she asked me what it was the next day!  I sweated the eggplant slices for about an hour and rinsed well with cold water, and it worked great.  Served with spaghetti and extra romano cheese. Very good dinner.

Yum Yum Yum! This recipe is easy and delicious!  As a young student living on my own, I'll make a dish of this and eat the leftovers for days with no complaints!  I like to have bread, or a small serving of pasta on the side to cut the flavor a little.  Cheap, easy, vegetarian cheesy goodness!

So I found a white eggplant at the farmers market the other day and had to buy it!  Found this recipe to use it in and it turned out beautifully!  I drastically reduced the serving to about 1-2, as I was only making it for myself for lunch (no one else likes eggplant).  It was SOOO GOOD!  Don't pass this recipe up...it's a keeper!

My mom used to make this for me and I decided to make it myself tonight.  I only used egg whites and instead of baking the eggplant, I broiled it.  The recipe is a little bit time consuming, but not difficult by any means.  I would have added some salt to the eggplant, but I am a salt lover.

Absolutely outstanding.  I bake this without tomato sauce for appetizers; I bake it with the cheese and tomato sauce for suppers and potlucks.  Fantastico.

This was a great recipe. I used panko  bread crumbs mixed with regular bread crumbs to bread the eggplant, layered baby portabella mushrooms with the layers and used garlic powder, red pepper flakes and italian seasonings on each layer.

This is an ingenious method to unguilt eggplant parmesan.  I am withholding the fifth star because there is much which is subjective...sauce, "Italian seasoned bread crumbs", covered or uncovered.  I have eggplants in the garden this year so I will use this often.  Thanks for posting.

I don't sweat the eggplant like some do, as I find it turns chewy. I use only Market Basket (neighborhood grocery store) brand marinara. It's inexpensive, all natural, and much, much better tasting than more expensive name brands! One thing I do a little differently is to soak the eggplant slices in Sherry wine before the dip/dredge step. This helps do away with the bitter taste from the seeds. Tip: Don't keep eggplant for longer than two days in the fridge. It doesn't stay firm/fresh very long after purchasing. Also, sprinkle the breadcrumb-dredged slices with about 1/2 cup parmesan cheese before topping with sauce and buffalo mozzerella cheese. This all-natural cheese doesn't contain silicon powder like the pre-shredded packaged cheeses do as an "anti-caking agent."

We really enjoyed this, the baking is so much cleaner than frying and, less oil to consume in the end. I followed the tips from NDG42200 by sweating the eggplant first, then baking at a higher temp. We also did not make the full recipe as it would be quite a lot. It was very good. We'll have it again and again.

I made this tonight and it was great.  I followed advice from others by sweating the eggplants first and baking the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side.  I also added angel hair pasta (cooked al dente) to each layer before adding the sauce.  I used 3 layers and only used 20 oz of sauce.  My son and I loved it.  I hope the leftovers are as good as it was out of the oven.

Incredible recipe! The only change I made was to use cheddar instead of the mozarella cheese because that's what I had. Even my husband had second helpings although he usually hates eggplant!

I made this for dinner recently and it was great!  The only thing is that it takes a LOT longer than just 10 minutes to bake the breaded eggplant and make sure it is crispy too.  Also, to keep it from being too "eggplanty" (I knwo that sounds weird) I baked it all in a single layer in the last step.  Yum!

This was very good!  My first experience with cooking eggplant.  The only thing I did differently was to bake the slices longer, probably 10-12 min. per side, before building in the casserole dish. They just need to be tender. But I loved it, and I know I will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe! Baking the eggplant with the crumb coating made it still crispy which is how I like the eggplant. This recipe was very easy to make and I'll be making it often!!

Simple flavors, but tasty nonetheless.  I cut the recipe in half and it still made A LOT of food.  I only used one eggplant and it took two cookie sheets to bake and provided me with two FULL layers in a 13"x9" dish.  Also, I left the skin on because of its nutrients, and it tasted great.

I have to say, I had my doubts about baking the eggplant, but it was beyond incredible, and I didn't feel as guilty as when I fry it in all that oil. I did add ricotta cheese tothe mixture because that is how I am used to eating it. It was awesome!

Delicious! I changed it a little by using half panko and half breadcrumbs, and also salted the eggplant first to remove bitterness/extra moisture. You wont even miss having meat with this dish!

The taste is good.  I will give it that.  But it is quite dry.  Next time I make it ( unless I find a better recipe ), I would have to add a bit of olive oil into the pasta sauce, before slathering it on top of the eggplant slices.  I found that with this batch I made, I had to turn them over and add cheese on top, so as to keep them slightly moist.

I made this last night and followed the directions exactly. It was just ok. Even my husband, who usually devours my cooking, asked if we could add some olive oil or butter or something. If you are used to good home made Italian cooking (as we are since I'm Italian), this dish is not very good. It definitely needs some fat. I would definitely suggest drizzling some olive oil over the eggplant before baking them the first time. Frying in a little oil would probably taste the best. After all, most things probably taste better fried. I served this with spaghetti. My homemade sauce and the spaghetti definitely were the highlight of the dish...unfortunately.

Wonderful!  I made this for a mom's group lunch where we have one girl who is vegetarian - a big hit with everyone!  From other reviewers suggestions, I also "sweated" out the eggplant with salt first to remove some of the moisture and I used four egg whites instead of the whole egg.  I also cooked eggplant on each side for 10 minutes.  To my breading mixture, I added a couple tablespoons of grated parm cheese and a teaspoon of garlic powder to give it more flavor.  I also used italian seasoning in place of basil.  Highly recommended - a little labor intensive but well worth the effort!

Sept 2012 - our second go at it - didn't do much different from the directions and this was fantastic!  My 8 year old had a great time making dinner for us!

Good recipe, I'll definitely try it again. I think my slices were too thick because it didn't get as crispy as I would have liked. And I cooked it for longer than the recipe calls for. The flavor was great though.

I also didn't salt (sweat) the eggplant, just peeled deeply and sliced thin, soaked in cold water and blotted. Yummy!

My college-age daughter was home for dinner last night so I decided to finally try this recipe.  Neither of us have had eggplant before so I wasn't too sure what to expect.  I asked a few friends advice on picking a good eggplant since I've never cooked with it, so I am fairly positive I had a good eggplant.  I followed the recipe exactly and when it was done it looked and smelled great.  My daughter absolutely loved it!  Me on the otherhand didn't like it at all.  I am still giving this recipe 5 stars since my daughter enjoyed it so much.  I must just not like the taste of eggplant apparently.  I will make this again for my husband to try.  He has never eaten eggplant either, and I am hoping he has the same opinion as my daughter!

This recipe is very very good.  However it is only great when it is fresh out of the oven.  Do not attempt to reheat as it does not taste very good.

This was really good, but it was too salty. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and let it sweat for 20 minutes. I did wash it off and pat it dry. But there was still too much salt.

We've made Eggplant Parmesan before and this is exactly how we make it with two changes. 1. To bread the eggplant, we like to dip it in parmesan cheese, then egg, then the bread crumbs. 2. We like to put about a tablespoon or two of EVOO in a pan and brown the eggplant in the EVOO. Then we assemble just as this recipe calls for. It is delicious and a little messy, but wonderful! :)

I made this for the first time last night. Nine servings is not realistic. I would say six servings is more accurate, depending on what else you serve along with this. I used 6 baby eggplants, as the regular eggplants did not look very fresh. I did degorge or "sweat" the eggplants for 30 minutes, and I cooked them in a 400 oven for 10 minutes per side. Two jars of basil marinara sauce (Brand: Barilla) were perfect, and this sauce gave the dish a lot more basil flavor than dried basil alone would have. I used the 5-cheese Italian mix rather than plain mozzarella, which really isn't that flavorful on its own. This is a keeper. Thanks for posting!

I made this recipe once, it came out ok.  The key is the sauce you used.  The texture was right.  I made on with one eggplant and reduced the amount of sauce in the recipe.  I used left-over pasta sauce from the fridge, which made my dish a little dry.  Salt the eggplant first is a must!  It taste really good, thanks. ;-D

Delicious!  Like others, I salted the eggplant first, let it sit for a half hour and rinsed.  I also baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side rather than 5, and cooked it at 375 rather than 350.

I have really enjoyed this.  I ended up using only two very large egg plants.  Over a bed of noodles very nice.  And as a meat eatter filling too!  My wife could not get into egg plant though so I had to knock back a star.

Really impressed with this recipe. I didn't have any eggs, but used a milk / flour paste substitute. I also salted and let the eggplant slices stand like other people recommended. Easy and healthy meal.

As I was making this I was thinking to myself, this doesn't look like something that would get a very high review. All I had was a cheap can of spaghetti sauce and my husband complaining in the background about my choice for dinner. This turned out amazing and my skeptical husband ended up eating his words. I will be making this again. I can't imagine what it would taste like if I had used a good spaghetti sauce!!!

I liked this dish, but my family did not. With traditional pan fried eggplant the eggplant flavour is quite hidden, with this version there is no fat to hide the taste. Personally I think this is a good thing, but I'm the only one in my family who feels that way.

needed more sauce, and the eggplant needs to cook longer before final cooking. otherwise it has good flavor and the smell in the house was great.

Fantastic!  My kids (8 & 4 years old)-who keep telling me they don't like eggplant-asked for seconds!  I followed the suggestions of a few other peope, I salted the slices to sweat them for about 30 min.  Then I baked the slices for about 25 min before adding the sauce & cheese.  I think the baking time depends on how thick you make your slices.  I also added garic, oregano, basil & a little salt to Itaian Style breadcrumbs.  My kids tried it after I baked it but before I added the cheese & sauce and they loved it just like that.  Super easy, flavorful & kid approved!

What a rich taste but healthy choice.  Yum.  My sweetheart raved about it.  I baked this in the oven in the morning and arranged the casserole and just put it in the oven before dinner.  Could do it the night before too.

The breading gets 5 stars. The eggplant gets 1. My husband and I are not very picky eaters, but I guess you have to like eggplant to enjoy this one.

Delicious! My husband loved it! I took the advice of others and salted and my eggplant with sea salt for 30 min then rinsed with cold water and dried it well before coating with egg and bread crumbs.I also cooked for 10 min per side. I served over spagetthi and extra sauce. What a wonderful and easy recipe.

I have been afraid to cook eggplant but this turned out very yummy. I think next time I will add a little bit of water to the sauce so it's not so dry.

Dang, this was good.  I'll admit I was pleasantly surprised since I only had one small eggplant and halved the recipe, didn't have bread crumbs so I substituted crushed crackers, and broiled part of the time to speed it up in time for dinner.  :)  It's the first time I've attempted eggplant parmesan and it was SO good!

This was a great way to make eggplant without having to fry it!  I followed some of the other suggestions and baked it for longer than suggested.  I baked at 375 for about 9 minutes on each side.  I also coated the pan with olive oil before baking & it gave it a nice golden brown color.  I also sliced the eggplant and coated with sea salt and allowed to sweat for 15 minutes.  Instead of using this eggplant for Eggplant Parm I instead layered it in my lasagna.  Great way to sneak some more veggies into the kids favorite meals!  Thanks for sharing - its a keeper!

I followed the multiple reviews and cooked the eggplant 20 minutes (10 minutes per side).  I mixed up at the grocery store and bought stuffing instead of bread crumbs.  This worked great.  I ended up blending the stuffing in a food processor, and I had my own herbed bread crumbs.

I had much more eggplant than I expected, so I made several stacks of eggplant/followed by sauce/cheese, and basil.  I also added fresh tomato slices each stack. The fresh tomato was a nice addition.   I think this still would have been a 5 without any changes.

Absolutely delicious!  I increased the cheese by quite a bit (as well as the sauce), but its easy to adjust according to taste.

This is an excellent recipe and I will make it many more times! I halved the recipe for my family. I used the smaller Japanese eggplants. I did not have quite enough Mozzerella, so I just subbed Provolone slices for the top. I put it under the broiler for a couple minutes to make the top layer golden and bubbly. Such an AWESOME recipe!

I don't usually like eggplant but this was really nice and they looked good too. I cooked the eggplant before putting tomato mix on it.  Tasted great.

This was just okay for us.  I followed the directions and ended up with bland, odd textured eggplant in pasta sauce.  Easy and healthy, but not that tasty.  Won't make this again.

Delicious! I like this recipe becaus ethe eggplant is not fried. It does take some time though to do all the steps - but well worth it! I usually double everything and get 2 9x13 tins of eggplant parmesan, and I freeze one for later use.

Absolutely wonderful!  I did "sweat" the eggplant by salting it and placing in a colander for 30 minutes prior to making the recipe. I sliced the eggplant into about 1/4 inch slices and prepared it as per original instructions otherwise.  It was excellent. My family of 4 ate the entire dish!  Will definitely make again!

One of my favorite foods since I've found this recipe! I do make a few changes. I sweat the eggplant per instructions from other reviewers. I also bake the slices around 8-10 minutes on each side. My first time I made this I didn't slice the eggplant thin enough and it came out very chewy - so I'd definitely recommend slicing the eggplant pretty thinly. I'm also only cooking for two, so I only use 2 eggplants and it's way more than enough. The cheese and sauce and eggplant blend together so deliciously. My mouth is actually watering as I think about it!

I also baked breaded egglant 10 min. on each side. I had mushrooms that needed to be used so i sauteed them and put them in a layer. Just ate leftovers today for lunch and think they taste even better. Thanks

Delicious!  I tweaked it a bit on others reviews.  I cut mine in 3/4 inch thick slices browned for 10 mins a side at 450, on a sheet with EVOO, then baked 35 mins at 450.  I recommend covering with foil and uncovering for last 10 minutes.  I also let the eggplant sweat with seasalt for 20 minutes, followed with patting dry before breading.  I will definitely make this again.  My fiancé loved it too!

I didn't have time to salt the eggplant like others mentioned and it didn't matter at all.  I sliced the eggplant very thinly and it didn't create any excess water in the pan.  Will make again!

I very happy with the results of this recipe! Following other suggestions, I also sweated the eggplant and baked each side for about 10 minutes. I eyeballed the crumbs and put just enough pasta sauce in to cover the bottom of my dish. I only made enough for 2 servings, so I only had one layer in my baking dish, which did not affect the texture at all! Yum.. thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I only had 2 eggplants, so I made the dish in a 9 x 9 pan and it worked great!  Used fresh basil and parsley instead of dried and I also sweat the eggplant before using.

This didn't turn out as well as I had hoped because of how I baked it. My husband hate the oven on in the summer so I am always relegated to using the toaster oven. I don't care what he says...next time I making this as it says to in the regular oven. It still had a very nice flavor though. I will still keep this recipe for my eggplant parm recipe.

Very good recipe! My Mom and my husband loved it. Followed the recipe exactly. (I didn't sweat the eggplant and it was still exceptional) I only used 2 regular size eggplants and there was enough to take some to my elderly neighbor as well as leftovers for another night!
Will make again for sure.
Thanks for posting this recipe!

Not bad, but somehow missing something. The eggplant texture was not really palatable. My dh thought it too salty, and I made the recipe as directed.

Eggplant was very good! Never had eaten nor have prepared eggplant before, but it turned out great! I boiled the slices in salted water for 2 minutes and they were nice and soft then.

I love eggplant and this recipe did not disappoint. I used plain bread crumbs. I used my own sauce recipe which I will post shortly. Served it with a salad and an herb focaccia recipe that came from this site. Molto buono.

Unbelievable! I had no idea you could make eggplant parmesan with no added oil and have it taste like it was fried! My meat-loving husband and his cousins loved this. I will make it again and again. I may stop making chicken parmesan altogether... this is so much cheaper and I prefer its texture and taste over chicken parmesan!

The changes I made: 1) bake for 10-12 minutes per side instead of 5.  2) add a little oil in with the eggs to make the breadcrumbs brown better.  3) increase the number of eggs used.  4) I also had some allouette (sp?) garlic and herb cheese in the fridge, and added a little of that to the casserole as well.  Pretty tasty!

Love it love it love it!!!  I always loved eggplant parmesan, this is the first time making it.  It was a hit at our dinner party last week, so I'm making it again for dinner tonight.

The embellishments I made... I use gluten-free breadcrumbs since I'm gluten intolerant (nobody knew the difference!), baked the eggplant pre-saucing for 10 minutes per side, and sliced fresh mozarella to lay across the top as an extra.  I also only use 2 eggplants, and eyeball the sauce so it is more firm rather than runny.
YUMMY!!!

i really enjoyed making this recipe im 14 and aspiring to be a chef/owner but i did add my own twist on the recipe by adding some thinly sliced baby portabelle mushrooms, they gave the dish a very nice earthy smell and 3 medium size chopped and fried garlic and instead of matzorella cheese i used a parmigiano reggiano chees and topped it off with a extra creamy blue cheese. it was a wonderful dish :)

Came out well. my bro is a meat man but really liked it. I followed the advice about weeping the eggplant and I baked them longer than the recipe but still not long enough. next time I will bake them at least 10 minutes on each side. Also one large eggplant was plenty of eggplant for me.

Next time I think I will use the Trader's Joe's frozen breaded eggplant, which only has to be microwaved for 2 minutes. that will make things much easier.  

UPDATE: I have made this twice using the trader joe's frozen breaded eggplant. just as good but much easier

I used frozen eggplant from Trader Joes.  Cooked eggplant in oven for about 15 min then took out of pan and followed receipe with the layering of the sauce, eggplant and cheese.  Quick, easy and most importantly YUMMY!

OMG... this was a delicious surprise to my family! I had a large eggplant I didn't know what to do with and looked up this recipe by chance... and we now will be making this recipe from now on!!! It is so yummy! I had used homemade breadcrumbs from a loaf of foccacia bread -- and about 1/4 cup of feta cheese with the listed cheeses -- and used a Marinara sauce. YUM.

I made this last night, this was very good.  My husband who is not a big eggplant eater loved it.  I used Fat Free Mozzarella, I will use it again except for the top layer for it did not really melt.  Will be making this again.

This is a great recipe! I am just learning to cook and made this for the first time last night. I chopped up cheese sticks in the food processor to get the mozzarella, which worked really well. Tomato and basil sauce from a jar eliminated the basil, which I didn't have. There were only two of us, so I used 3 little eggplants. At first, I thought I'd have leftovers for days, but that wasn't the case at all! It's nearly gone! The only thing is that I salted the eggplant and no moisture was coming out after 15 minutes, so I rinsed it and continued on with the recipe. I probably wasn't supposed to do that, but I'm impatient! It still was great! I will definitely make this again! I will read up more on if it is really necessary to purge the eggplant or not, before I make this again, though.

I started with the basic recipe and will make that again, but wanted to make casserole like Trader Joe's used to sell that had a phyllo crust. I started with 1/2 pkg phyllo dough. Prepared the eggplant as suggested, though only used two and coated the baking sheet with extra virgin olive oil. Melted 1/2 stick butter; generously coated the bottom of a 9x13x2 dish. Put several sheets of phyllo in the bottom, brushed with melted butter, added more dough (total of probably 8 sheets). Placed a layer of eggplant slices on top; made a chiffonade of fresh basil which I sprinkled over the eggplant, added a layer of shredded mozzarella (slices of fresh would be great); then 1/2 jar of a good marinara sauce. Repeated the eggplant, basic, cheese marinara sequence and then added an additional 8 sheets of phyllo dough brushed with butter. Dealing with the phyllo dough is the hardest part of this recipe. Make sure to keep the unused dough covered with a damp towel so it doesn't dry out. Baked for 30 minutes at 350 and it was fabulous. Served with fresh asparagus and a glass of Merlot. I love baking the eggplant as it is a lot less messy and the eggplant doesn't absorb as much oil. Will do my eggplant for all recipes this way from now on.

All I can say is that my eggplant LOATHING husband LOVED it and raved about how he would eat this over and over again! :)  I sliced up the eggplant extra thin (2 mm) to get them crispier and used whole grain bread crumbs to keep it a bit healthier, with a dash of salt added for flavor.

This recipe was great.  I switched the serving size to 5 and used one eggplant...I cooked for two and had plenty leftover...I also used the parm. bread crumbs and omitted the parm cheese.  I added canned portabella mushrooms as well....I did not salt and rinse the eggplant first and it still tasted great!  Can't wait to have the leftover for lunch tomorrow.  Served on top of angel hair whole wheat pasta this is a very filling meal!

I was so surprised at how much I liked this dish since I'm not usually a fan of eggplant.  I used the type of eggplant that is light purple with white "stripes" on it...I think it's called purple zebra eggplant.  I also sweated the eggplant like others suggested.  Loved it!  I also baked it longer...maybe 8 minuted per side at 450 so they were nice and crisp.  I mixed the Parmesan cheese in with the bread crumbs instead of layering it.  I'll definitely make this dish again.

Terrific eggplant parm recipe!  I love it because there is no frying.  Makes it healthier and makes the cleanup easier.  We love to have this with a side of homemade pasta.  We do what others suggest and let the eggplant sit with a bit of salt then clean them off and prepare.  A household favorite.

Hubby said to give it a 4.  I thought more of a 3, but my taste buds are off from a sinus infection.  It did give me terrible indigestion later...maybe all that cheese. I may make it over someday.

I have enjoyed eggplant in restaurants, but never made it myself. 

this recipe was very easy. My friends loved it!! They went home the next day and made it for themselves

This is a good meal for someone maybe transitioning out of eating meat. or a good alternative. I felt very full

This turned out great!  I made my own bread crumbs (following the only breadcrumb recipe on allrecipes.com) and used home made sauce which I'm sure added to the flavor, but EVERYONE loved it.  It was nice to have an eggplant parm that didn't include frying!

LOVED this recipe!! Good way to get my hubby to eat eggplant! I used a 9x9 pan and 1 eggplant, and 1 jar of spaghetti sauce, which was perfect. I salted the eggplant using sea salt, which I would not recommend (very salty). Next time I'll add spinach in the layers as well. Made just the eggplant part again (with regular salt) for a sandwich and it was wonderful. I'm planning on trying to grow eggplant in my garden this year, so this recipe will be a regular.

Very good recipe, I sweated the eggplant with sea salt prior to breading and baking it. I used cornflake crumbs in place of bread crumbs, and added garlic powder & Italian seasoning to the cornflakes.

Delicious! One large eggplant was plenty for 2 servings.  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and just used egg whites only for the egg dip to reduce calories.  I also used low-fat cheeses.

I substituted ZUCCHINI for the eggplant in this recipe.  I sweat the slices as previously mentioned, breaded (added some grated Parm cheese in Italian Bread Crumbs), baked for 10 minutes on each side.  Perfect!  My husband who normally doesn't eat zucchini had seconds and thirds!  Healthier than frying and tastes great!  (Made Mom's Zucchini Bread with the leftover zucchini!!)

I'm a vegetarian, so it's always nice to find meatless meals that are still hearty. I have made a recipe similar to this for years, but it was a vegan recipe that used olive oil instead of eggs and flour instead of bread crumbs.  Since I'm not a vegan I wanted to try this version for a little more flavor.  Loved it!  When I brown the eggplants though I put on broil instead of bake, they brown much quicker that way and still are cooked completely after they bake in the oven.

My picky husband and children loved this dish. Too advice of others and salted the eggplant for 30 minutes before breading. Used egg whites and then dipped in breadcrubs in a ziploc bag.  Baked for 10 minutes each side.  Final bake time only needed about 25 minutes as it would have burned at 30 minutes.

I made this for dinner.  I've never used eggplant before so I was a bit nervous.  My family loved it, all four kids and my husband and I, that rarely happens.  Make sure to peel the eggplant first, somehow I noticed that too late.  I also used egg whites and made my own bread crumbs so I could make it healthier.  I cooked the bread for a couple of minutes in the microwave, then chopped them up and added some italian seasoning.  I also cooked the eggplant longer, around 400 degrees for 8 minutes on each side.  Everything was excellent.

It does really take about 2 hours, but there is alot of downtime to relax or make a side dish. A hour of that cook time is waiting.  30 minutes for the eggplants to "sweat" and 35 minutes for it to cook.  So its really not that bad and the taste makes it worth the effort.  You dont need 4 cups up breadcrumbs, 2 would probably be just fine.  Do add the parmesan and Italian seasonings to the bread crumbs and a little salt.  Very light dinner, won't weigh you down.

I thought that this was a great recipe.  Neither my husband or I eat eggplant and we both liked it.  This was my first time cooking eggplant.
I did salt it so that it would sweat and was sure to dry it real good.  One eggplant would have been plenty.  I used 2 egg whites and one cup of bread crumb.  I could have used just half cup of bread crumbs and it would have been just right.  I had lots of left over crumbs.  I baked on each side for 10 minutes and they were not as crispy as I would like, so I broiled them for 4 min on each side and they were perfect.  I also baked them on my pizza stone coated with cooking spray and they turned out perfect and crispy.
I used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce to save some calories.  I put the crushed tomatoes on the bottom and then I sauteed chopped bell pepper and onion and missed that with a can of diced tomatoes which I put on top.  I was wanting to add more vegi's and it turned out yummy!  Great recipe.

I made this recipe with 1 giant eggplant and had enough to feed me for up to 3 days. I usually get tired of eating leftovers, but not with this one! I ate this by putting it between two slices of bread as a sandwich - awesome! Including sweating the eggplant, this recipe took really long for me to make (upwards of 2 hrs since I had more eggplant than could fit on my one baking sheet).

Delicious!  I cut the recipe down to one eggplant and used an 8x8 inch baking dish.  The result was plenty for two people.  I used Classico Italian Sausage spaghetti sauce, which I'm sure added a huge flavor blast to the dish.  It seems that whatever spaghetti sauce is used for the dish would have a big impact on the final taste.  Also, the eggplant parmesan would be perfect on angel hair pasta, which I'll make for it next time.

This is my favorite recipe ever!!! I'm not kidding. It's my husband's as well. And my mom's. And my...well...you get it.  I get requests to make this all the time and everyone has asked for the recipe. The has quickly given me the reputation as a very good cook! I use Prego Traditional sauce and it is the best.

This dish was delicious!  I used one medium eggplant and it was plenty!  If you slice the eggplant thin enough, cooking for 5 minutes on each side is perfect.  I also used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I will definately make this again!

My husband loved this, but i wasn't completely thrilled. This was my first time making it and one eggplant yields so much! I will make it again but i liked how the other recipe fried it first to make it crispy then baked it. I think I needed to soak it a little longer on the salt, it was slightly bitter

I have been making eggplant like this for years. I use eggwhites instead of whole eggs. I broil the breaded eggplant before arranging in the baking dish. I don't bother salting my eggplant. This is much healthier than traditional eggplant parmesan.

This was a meal that I really enjoyed. I would definitely recommend this to the veggie lovers. The meat lovers might prefer something more filling. It was a great way to use the eggplant I had sitting in the fridge and healthy too! I halved the recipe, used egg beaters, and sprinkled italian seasoning over the top. Other than that, I followed the recipe.

This is a solid recipe. My husband and I both enjoyed it. I recommend salting/draining the eggplant before breading and baking so that it isn't bitter. However, I did use plain bread crumbs and added my own Italian seasonings to them, and I also only needed 1/2 the amount of bread crumbs (2 cups) that the recipe called for. Though eggplant is a bit work-intensive, I will probably make this again.

I usually love eggplant parm., but not this version. The eggplant did not get crispy enough for me. I sweated them out with salt for 20 mins. as others have suggested and then I cooked 10 mins on each side with some pretty thin slices. Still, it didn't have that crunch I was hoping for. I will stick to frying them next time...the extra fat is worth it! =)

Very easy, quick to throw together and the results were very good.  I love eggplant parmesan...I've had better, but this was very good too.

I used three medium sized white eggplants and it was a bit too much.  I needed another egg which I thinned out a bit with water, and some extra bread crumbs to get everything coated.  I upped the parmesan cheese to one cup.  I mean, after all, this makes a nice big pan of eggplant PARMESAN, so I wanted to taste the parmesan.  Best warmed over too...mmm.

This recipe was just what I needed as a starting off point.  My Italian grandma never baked her Eggplant, it was always served breaded above a bed of spaghetti with sauce.  I used the recipe to slice, bread, sweat and bake this eggplant.  From there I placed a few slices over a bed of noodles and some sauce.  EXCELLENT and my Grandma must have been a time cruncher because the total recipe probably took 30-40 min. including prep

Very tasty and easy to prepare. For a lower fat/cholecterol recipe I dipped the eggplant slices in rice milk instead of egg. I skipped baking the eggplant slices for 5 minutes on each side because there were too many to fit in my oven at one time. After everything was assembled in the pan I added 1/2 cup rice milk. This gave the recipe enough moisture so the eggplant cooks up nice and soft.

My family really enjoyed this meal and we plan on making it again. The only problem I had was getting the eggplant crispy enough. After putting it in the suggested extra time without luck I put it undert he broiler (under close watch) for a few minutes. This helped me a lot!!! I loved this recipe!!

This was so good!  I also baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side as others suggested.  I chose a really tasty spaghetti sauce which added more flavour too.  I would definitely make this one again!  I used low fat mozzarella and whole wheat bread crumbs to make this a healthy meal.

I would like to preface this review by saying that I have never cooked eggplant before and have never eaten eggplant parmesan.  I made this for dinner tonight for my DH, mom and I...and we all thought it was absolutely terrible!!  This dish tasted like chunky tomato sauce with bread crumbs in it.  I really have no idea how so many people have rated it so high...needless to say, we will not be making this again.

I prepared the eggplants like the previous suggestions (salting and sweating for 30 minutes prior) and cooked them for 10 minutes on each side. The recipe was delicious! I served it with a bed of angel hair pasta. A little time consuming...nevertheless, it was a great recipe! Thanks!

I made this last night and my husband devoured it!!!  It was awesome. I will definitely make this again.  The only thing I changed was the oven temp and time.  I raised the temp to 450 and cooked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side.

This was my first time cooking eggplants. My family said that it was the same or better than the restaurant! I did change the eggplant bake time to 15 min/side. It's definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed others' advice about sweating and baking the eggplant beforehand. I found that it took a lot longer for the eggplant to bake. Also, I only used 1 eggplant and 2 eggs weren't enough even for that. 
The rest of the recipe I followed it as it said. I was making for just myself, so I just used half a large glass pan and it worked out fine. Also, since I love broccoli I put it in the dish as well (raw, on the same level as eggplant) and it turned out great. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I love this recipe, however I did change a few things... 1. I layered ricotta cheese with the motz cheese 2. 
I'm a fan of double dipping...breading the eggplant once and then repeating the process again. Great recipe!

I had never cooked with eggpany before, but I really likes it. I was able to give it to my daughter, who loved it, and even my mom, who insists she HATES eggpant likes it. Overall a good recipe! I will make it again.

I can only give 4 stars because I used this recipe as a base and modified it a bit.  First I added ricotta cheese, I oven baked the eggplant and then lightly toasted it on the stove, I added oregano, garlic, onion powder and a dash of celery seasoning to it as well.
It turned out delicious with the extra cheese and garlic.  I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

Awesome recipe although I'd peel the eggplants first next time. I found the peelings were a little tough. I did have a little too much eggplant as well and also used much less bread crumbs. Flavor though was fab!

Fantastic.  Really good.  Time consuming but so tasty.  I cut and salted the eggplant the night before and layered it between paper towels.  I put it on a plate with a heavy bowl on the top and it really took out the bitterness.  Fantastic meatless main meal.

Excellent!  I would think that the sauce you use would be the greatest determinant of whether or not you wind up liking this recipe.  I used slices of LIGHT mozerella because I like the look better.  And I used tomato basil sauce by Classico (no added sugar or nasty additives).  It was a huge hit!  Even with the 20-month-old!  For company, I would make it without the low fat ingredients.

I did not care for this; I have another recipe for eggplant parmesean where you fry the eggplant in olive oil first, and it is delicious, although messy to fry...  So I thought I'd try the baking method.  When doing this recipe, I didn't change anything, however my eggplant was soggy in the dish (and yes I baked them) and I thought it was waaaay too saucy...the tomato sauce overpowered the eggplant.  Maybe I did something wrong, but this dish was just a soggy mix of eggplant, a ton of tomato sauce and cheese.

Very good recipe.  I used the tips about salting the eggplant before cooking it and also baked it for the 10 minutes as recommended by others.  This recipe tasted great and even my picky 3 year old loved it.  Definite keeper!

I like this recipe since you don't have to fry the eggplant.  Very healthy.  Make sure you cover all of the eggplant on top with sauce so it doesn't dry out.  Excellent!!!

Ok I fry this first, it's heaven on a plate, served with french bread and tossed salad. Not very kid friendly unless you hide the eggplant with lots of sauce and cheese! Us adults loved it.

This was pretty good while it was very hot, but I found that as it cooled it took on an upleasant flavor.  We are not eggplant lovers, though, so if you love eggplant this is probably a winner for you.

It took FOREVER to dip and bread.  I tried using 3 eggplants as the recipe said, but two eggs were not enough, I ended up using 5 eggs.  Then it was just not cooked right, it was still crunchy by the time it came out, so on my second batch I cooked it a little longer, but it just did not taste right.  The primary taste was the marinara sauce and mozarella cheese.  My family loved it, but I was satisfied with it.

This is delicious! I'm eating some right now! I had no problem with bitter eggplants, so I didn't follow suggestions involving "sweating" with salt. What I did have to change were the portions. I used 2 eggplants which required 3 eggs and I cut the bread crumbs quantity to half. This is so delicious and healthy!

This was so good and super easy.  I went ahead and baked the eggplant on both sides for 10 minutes b/c that is what several people suggested.  The eggplant was the perfect texture.  Don't know if it made a difference, but because this was just for me, I used only 1 eggplant and eye-balled the ingredient amounts and used fresh chopped basil since I had some on hand.  I also used my George Foreman Toaster Oven/Broiler to bake this.  My spaghetti sauce was Classico and included mushrooms.  I served it over linguine.  Thanks for the great dish, Dolores.  Will definitely make again!

Pretty good, but just seemed to lack something.  I used Barilla marinara for the sauce, so maybe it was that, or it could have used more spice.  Everyone else liked it though.  I'll file this recipe in the "maybe I'll make again" pile.

I wanted to see if baked eggplant was as good as fried, and I do think it is! The only suggestion I have is to use fresh basil, it makes a huge differnce!

This was really good and is a new staple in our house. It was just a little bit too salty, so I used low-sodium cheeze. That made it twice as good. This is really simple, a perfect last-minute meal.

Okay.  Eggplant parmesan normally isn't anything special, and this wasn't
an exception (but maybe I'm just not a big fan of this dish in general?).
The preparation is easy, though time consuming.  (Following other
reviewers advice, I (i) "sweated" the eggplant and (ii) in step two, baked 
the eggplant 10 minutes per side, so total time took even longer than in  
the unmodified recipe.)  After a bit of experimentation, I found I enjoyed
it more when I skipped putting spaghetti sauce in the baking dish -that  
made the eggplant a little damper than I'd prefer- but rather added a few 
drops of sauce spread on top of each piece where its flavors ended up
meshing well with the bread crumbs.

Had friends over for dinner and we loved this. 

I used a combo of fresh mozzarella balls and sliced mozzarella rather than the shredded stuff. Also, I salted the eggplant, drained (@20 min) and then rinsed w/cold water before putting on breading.

This recipe was excellent.  I salted the eggplant ("sweated" it) so that it wouldnt be bitter, and used Paul Newman's marinara sauce.  Added a little more cheese.  My whole family loved it.

This was excellent and easy. I did slice the eggplant, sprinkled with salt, layed them on paper towels to help drain out some of the water. I also sauteed some onions and added them to the sauce. Easy and good.

This is delicious!  Even people who don't like eggplant will eat this dish.  I like to add a little more cheese to mine and I bleed my eggplant first by soaking them in salt for 20 minutes & then rinsing.

Oh, this was so yummy. We made it using ine eggplant, and it fed 3 people with some leftover for lunch the next day. We added a teaspoon garlic to the bread crumbs and baked for 10 mins on each side @ 375. It was the best Ive ever had! Defiently going to make this one for the fiance! Awesome, Thanks!

This was my first time cooking eggplant. As other reviewers suggested, I fried my eggplant, which makes it more fattening I know. Although, I felt the recipe was very time consuming, it turned out delicous. My picky husband said it was the best thing I had ever made.

Ok, I didn't LOVE it. It was a little bland. It needs something more than the fresh garlic I added. I also used fresh basil instead. I agree with the other reviews re: sweating the eggplant...need for more sauce, etc.
But, I will say that it was fairly easy to make.

great recipe, thanks for sharing! Would just add an extra layer of tomato sauce on top of the last layer of eggplant, it was too dry without it.

I am extremely picky about my eggplant parmesan and literally, before this recipe, there was one place in the world where I would get it (a small Italian restaurant in New York City) where I knew that I would actually like it. Now I have another. 

I scaled this recipe down so that it only called for one eggplant, and my boyfriend made a homemade sauce with fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, basil and a few other spices. I let the eggplants "sweat" for about 10 minutes as other reviewers did and used egg whites instead of a whole egg. 1/4" is the best slicing thickness and anything smaller got a little "extra crispy" as I followed other reviewers' suggestions to bake the eggplant for about 10 minutes on each side. 

This was a GREAT recipe, and one that even my picky boyfriend said that he would have again if I made it again. Thanks!

This is the recipe for eggplant parmesan I was looking for. I used only 1 eggplant and I made this entirely in the microwave. Yep, including "baking" the breaded eggplant slices in a single layer for a 3 1/2 mins. (I had to do 3 pans ). I figured they didn't have to be that crispy since they were going to be baked again in the sauce and cheese. It made the process a lot faster too. After asembling (I forgot the basil but didn't miss it) I baked the pan full and added the mozz. and parmesan on top in the last few mins. Delicious. Oh I did assemble this (except the last cheese ) ahead and refrigerated it until I was ready to bake. Then the baking in the microwave was quick and easy when I was ready. No one will ever notice the eggplant isn't fried! I suspect you could do the work ahead and freeze it like this too. Don't know if it helped but I definetly peeled the eggplant and I did the salt and rinse thing. I did get one comment that it was salty the first night. Didn't notice it the second night--leftovers better than original.

Delicious! This was easy to make, though pretty time consuming due to all of the steps. I did follow a lot of the other reviewer's tips, like salting the eggplant slices and baking in the oven ten minutes on each side. I did not change anything as far as ingredients, exept using just egg whites instead of the whole egg and we didn't use nearly that much bread crumbs. This is a must try!

This was really delicious.  The one drawback is that it's very time consuming.  Some previous reviews suggested salting and rinsing the eggplant prior to breading, while others suggested parboiling for a few minutes, so I did both.  I saw no reason to slice my eggplant in rounds, so I sliced lenghthwise for cutlets, which fit better in the pan anyway.  Even with parboiling, I still baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side. It browned better with a very light coating of olive oil cooking spray. This would have been even more excellent with a homemade sauce.

The eggplant I sliced VERY thin was crispy and tasty, but the thicker slices (and they weren't thick) didn't taste done.  I peeled and salted the eggplant first, then cooked with increased time per recommendation.  I might make this again, with thinner eggplant slices, which I'd be tempted to just eat rather than baking with the sauce. They're tasty.

Great recipe.  I tried what others had suggested by dabbing each side with some olive oil and sprinkling it with some sugar than I baked it on each side for 15 mins.  Will make again.

This was a great low fat version of this dish! I used my own spaghetti sauce and halved the recipe and we still had leftovers. I was surprised at how much it tasted like the fried version. Thanks for the recipe!

Eh, it was OK.  I made a ton of eggplant, like trebled the recipe.  I think the trick is to get the eggplant sliced really thin, like chips almost.  Anyway, I'm not blown away.

Very good, I make this often. I always make sure to briefly boil the eggplant in salted water, then rinse in cold water. Sometimes I cube the eggplant and mix it with spaghetti sauce and cheese- delicious!

Was very skeptical about this recipe, but my insecurities were melted away. I made my own Italian bread crumbs as well (oregano, paprika, parmesan, garlic) and I also salted them and let them sit for about 15 minutes. I did not use any cheese other than parmesan (preference)... but i put fresh sliced tomatoes on top about half way though. Excellent recipe, but definitely takes time.

This was sooo yummy. I had to cook the eggplant for about 10 minutes a side to get it nice and brown and crunchy- and it took several trays full to get it all baked. But it was worth it! My husband and son both loved it- and even the leftovers are good!

This is wonderful.  The best way to make the eggplant.  It did require a bit longer time in the oven to get crispy and browned.  I make this a few times during the season.  Now I have a even better way.

I really loved this dish. I am a huge fan of chicken parmesan but I think this is even better. I did have to use 4 eggs in order to coat all of the eggplant and I cooked the eggplant for about 12 minutes on each side on 375, my slices were not very thin though. I brought some into work the next day for lunch and it was absolutley delicious!

Love the idea of baking, not frying the eggplant. I used more sauce- I didn't think the stated amount would be enough. Whole family enjoyed, even hubby who generally dislikes vegetarian meals.

My mom used to make the fry version, and I wanted to try this to see how it compares.  You can tell the difference because you don't taste the fat.  I loved it!  I think it was even better a day or two after I cooked it.  I love the consistency!  Thank you for the healthy alternative to the fat-filled frying recipe!

This recipe is terrific. I love that it is baked and not fried.  I found that the eggplant was not as mushy as it is in fried versions.  I enjoy a spicy sauce and tried a spicy red pepper spagetti sauce and it was excellent.  I also tried a sharp cheddar cheese instead the mozeralla and it was great as well.  Definatly try this recipe out!

I made it exactly as the recipe said and loved it.  Neither my boyfriend or I like eggplant, but decided to try something new and we both loved it.  It is mushy (which I thought I didn't like)but tastes exactly like pizza.  Yum.

I really liked this dish, but I made several modifications.  I only had one eggplant but it still made a meal for two people with some leftovers.  I sweated the eggplant per several suggestions and instead of the egg merely rinsed the eggplant with water and then dipped it, which worked fine.  I used cornmeal mixed with some Italian seasoning for the dip.  It tasted great but it takes a while to make.

I have made eggplant parm before, but i have never made it by baking the eggplant first. I tried this and now i don't know how i could possibly go back to the old way. It is healthier. I also sweated the eggplant first and i think it makes a big difference.

This was very delicious. I was given a beautiful, large eggplant from my neighbor's garden. It was fresh, firm and had few seeds. This one eggplant was enough to fill the casseole. It was wonderful. Next year I growing some eggplant!

Eggplant was too hard and bitter.  Personally, I prefer the soft eggplant you get with stove-top frying.  Too bad, because this is a healthy and easy recipe.

First time making eggplant parmesan.  It was time consuming but pretty easy.  I used Kay's Spaghetti and Lasagna Sauce instead of the recommended spaghetti sauce, and I thought it was quite good with both recipes!

I agree that the eggplant needs to be cooked a bit longer in the oven.  5 minutes a side was not enough to make it golden brown. Also, two large eggplants were more than enough though you may need three eggs instead of two.  Well received at my house (my first foray into the field of eggplant parmesan)

We LOVE this recipe! Super easy and absolutely delicious, this has quickly become a repeated favorite! A great variation if you have a little extra time is to make a simple tomato sauce with minced carrots, celery, onion and garlic softened in a little butter then add a 28oz. can crushed tomatoes and simmer for 15-20 min. Enjoy!

All my friends (even the ones that usually won't eat anything that doesn't contain meat) think that this is an excellent dish.  I usually add some minced garlic and crushed red pepper to give the eggplant a kick.

This recipe was delicious.  My only suggestion would be to make sure that if you use 3 eggplants, they should be small and use 2 eggplants if they are of larger size.  I found that this was even better after letting it sit overnight.

I only made 2 small eggplants (different variety I can't remember the name, which tastes sweeter than the large one) I cut both in half and I only did one layer.  Both the egg and bread crumbs (out of saltines and blended) were seasoned with All Purpose Seasoning (herbs and salt) It was very good and tasty.

This is a delicious recipe. Can eat it over and over. The only difference I found is I feel the recipe is a little backwards with the amounts. 2 eggs is not enough. I used 3 large. 4 cups of breadcrumbs is way too much. I used 2 and they were coated nicely. Also I baked about 7-8 min on each side. 5 is not enough. You can always add more breadcrumbs if needed and more egg as well.

Amazing. My family loved it—even the picky eaters. As some others, I had to bake the breaded eggplants ten minutes each side, but that’s just the way individual ovens vary. The flavor was perfection. This recipe is going in my regular rotation.

I only used 1 eggplant,  so I scaled back the proportions. I also peeled it, salted it, waited 30 minutes, then rinsed and dried each slice. Breaded and baked the slices on a rack for about 25 minutes, at 375. Next time I will use less sauce, and somehow sweeten it up a little (the Traditional sauce was almost bitter). I have never attempted to make Eggplant Parmesan before, and this turned out amazing!

My man does not like eggplant. He is also gluten and lactose intolerant. Cooking can be a challenge. I made this with gluten free Italian bread crumbs and used mykos mozzarella substitute on the top. It was a hit. He went back for seconds.

Really liked this recipe!  Baking the eggplant slices first gave them a great texture, not rubbery and not greasy.  As my husband really liked it I will most definitely make it again.

I made *almost* no changes.  I thought that tomato puree was bitter..so, I added garlic salt and Italian herbs. Otherwise, that was it, I followed the rest to a tea.  I was able to make 4 layers with 3 eggplants.  I have been pretty sure I hate eggplant. But, I LOVED this.  The Parmesan really helped offset that bitterness of the puree!!  This will definitely go into the rotation!

It was delicious! The modifications I made were to salt the eggplant slices for a half hour to draw out the water, since my husband hates soggy eggplant. I also baked the eggplant slices 10 minutes on each side, until crispy and golden brown. My husband despises eggplant but he liked this! Even my teenagers enjoyed it.

This received a "just OK" review from our young family.  Everyone thought the dish smelled good while it was cooking.   But it was too salty for me, which I attribute to the bread crumbs, plus I have a soy sensitivity so I might try it again if I make my own. But my husband thought it was just OK too and two of my three kids did not like it at all.  The 11YO will normally eat anything and although she liked the taste OK, she does not like the texture of cooked squash so she did not eat her serving.  On the other hand, my normally picky 9 YO absolutely loved it and thought it tasted like pizza. It was a healthy, meatless dish but time consuming to bread the eggplant slices.  Since it was just OK, I would have to look at making some changes before trying it again.

I made this for my husband and I and it is a keeper recipe.   I did cut the recipe down and only used one pretty large eggplant and it was more than enough and had leftovers.  (The leftovers were actually better than the first night!)   I cooked spaghetti noodles to serve with it but ended up putting the cooked spaghetti noodles as the bottom layer in the baking dish (over a small amount of sauce).  I layered the eggplant, sauce and cheese on top of  the noodles then baked.    It was DELICIOUS!

Second time I’m using this recipe. I use stale take and bake  French bread classic breadsticks, which I grate and add powdered garlic and dried oregano. I drizzle a small amount of garlic infused olive oil on the bottom of the pan then begin layering. It’s more delicious days later. Not the quickest prep as the baking of the eggplant takes some time. But once all the eggplant ?? is baked, the assembly is straight forward. I cover the pan with foil, which I remove five minutes before removing the pan from the oven to brown the cheese. Delicious!

My husband and I made this tonight.   We followed the recipe as written.  He loves eggplant parmesan. I don't recall ever having it.  Neither one of us liked this recipe. The breadcrumbs became mush, and it was not good at all. He requested this for dinner, and he was very disappointed.

The big problem with this recipe is the baking time for th eggplant.  5 minutes does not cut it.  I ended up baking 20 min per side to get real tender eggpant which is the way I like it

I general don't fry things bc it's intimidated to me so I've never made eggplant parmesan. I just thought a baked recipe wouldn't be good. WRONG! This is my favorite now, it's so easy and so delish!

Turned out really well—I halved the recipe since there’s just two of us and I baked the whole thing for 45 min. I sweated my eggplant with salt before I breaded it too. Very easy eggplant parm!

Excellcent recipe.  I fried the eggplant for flavor and had left over sauce (one jar) and eggplant (one eggplant).  Didn’t salt eggplant...research said “wouldn’t make any difference in flavor or texture”.  And it didn’t.

Excellent recipe. Made it exactly as written, as I always do. Just the right amount of crumbs and cheese. And the recipe says nothing about jarred sauce. It says 6 cups of spaghetti sauce. I used my homemade marinara and it was great!

I used Japanese eggplants I grew myself and sliced them vertically with a mandoline. It gave me beautiful slices of uniform thickness which I used like lasagna noodles. I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs on hand, so I added Italian seasoning, salt and pepper then followed the recipe as written. When I placed the eggplant slices in the 9"x 13" pan,  I laid the first layer longways and the second layer crossways. I just happened to have a jar of tomato basil spaghetti sauce on hand and it was perfect for this recipe!  I will definitely make this again, especially when we have an abundance of eggplant! My husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, but this was so good, I don't think he noticed there was no meat. Score!!

I didn’t have any  mozzarella cheese so I subbed with mild cheddar and used grated parmesan. Breaded with  Italian panko bread crumbs with some added garlic and onion powder, baked 10 mins on each side as recommended,  added some chopped peppers and onions to my spaghetti sauce and a LOT of basil. Didn’t salt the eggplant mostly because I didn’t feel like waiting and it was fine without it! This was the bomb and I will definitely make it again!

Very pleased with this recipe that used a goodly amount of our garden egg plant! A definite do-over; hearty for a vegetarian dish. However, I'll reduce the amount of tomato sauce by 1/3 to 4 cups.

No bueno! Baking the eggplants for 5 minutes per side is not enough. I should've known better but was in a hurry. I've always fried the eggplant in the past. The eggplants were spongy and nowhere near cooked through based on these instructions. Jared sauce is a quick solution but certainly needs some doctoring!

Delicious! As other reviewers suggested, I sliced and salted the eggplant. Then followed the recipe except I make my own marinara so I just ignored the spaghetti sauce and simmered away until the eggplant was golden. I topped with some sliced buffalo mozzarella to make it even more fancy. Eggplant was from our garden.

Fantastic!! I only had 2 eggplants and one 24oz jar of sauce and it turned out excellent! Added some additional seasonings to the Italian bread crumbs (salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and cumin). Only needed less than 2 cups of crumbs. Excellent recipe!

Great basic recipe for "baking" instead of traditional frying. 
I took the advice of other reviews & salted the thin slices of eggplant leaving them to rest for half an hour, then rinsing & patting dry. I've never done this before & I believe the exceptional flavor & texture was enhanced by doing that. I also flipped the slices several times, on the parchment paper lined pan, to get the crispness & cook that I preferred. 
I stacked my eggplant layers with a dollop of tomato sauce, mozzarella, grated parmesan AND cottage cheese.
Fresh basil from the garden atop as well.
This was a very fragrant & light eggplant parmesan compared to the more common fried heavier versions. I believe I will be using this baking method from now on...

This was incredible! I made it for my husband, mom, and her husband and they could not stop talking about how amazing it was the whole time they were eating, and even the next morning. My mom said it was the best Eggplant Parmesan she has ever had and her husband said it may just be his new favorite dish. 
I used Prego Marinara sauce, and put a little Tony's Creole seasoning in between the layers and Italian seasoning on top instead of basil. And I did more parmesan cheese than it asked for because, well, parmesan cheese :)
I will definitely be making this again.

I read the reviews and took the advise to sweat the eggplant. I tweaked it some by adding a layer of spinach and a layer of cooked ground turkey. My jar of spaghetti was probably closer to 3 cups. All and all, a good midweek meal if my assembled it on the weekend

Just put it in the oven but I think some of the ingredient are way off.  I had to use 3 eggs instead of 2.  Also 4 cups of breadcrumbs is way too much.  I poured 2 cups into a bowl.  After doing all of the dipping I had about a cup left over.  1 cup is probably all that is needed.

Made no changes the first time, used shredded parmesan the second time and tasted just as wonderful. I've fried eggplant in the past and this no fry version really is just as delicious.

I used Appel Foods nut crumbs Spicy for my breadcrumbs because im on a Keto diet. I sprayed my slices with olive oil after dipping them in egg and the nut crumbs. Also, since I was soooo hungry i totally skipped the salting part. Guess what!! Not bitter, not salty, and perfectly cooked. I first browned them for 15 min total and then spread with a mixture of ricotta and mozzarella then pizza sauce. I sprinkled with parmesan cheese and covered with foil. Cooked at 350 for 50 min. Perfectly cooked. I love this recipe.

I didn’t use as much of the ingredients as the recipe called for because I made it for 2. Easy to adjust and still turned out amazing! Instructions were super easy to follow. This dish is comparable to what I’ve ordered at restaurants! And I did follow the advice listed in the comments about sprinkling salt and letting the eggplant sweat prior to coating the pieces in breadcrumbs. Will definitely make again!

Very good recipe.  I added a little ground beef over the finished dish just to have some meat.

Eggplant needed to cook longer than five minutes each side. I usually cook mine at a higher temperature to oven fry it.

Need to weep the eggplant prior to baking it.... salt, let it sit and then dry between paper towels before dipping, breading and  baking.  Did what the recipe said and it was soaked in water from the eggplant.  Terrible waste of  cheese, homemade pasta sauce, homemade low carb bread crumbs and time..................

Before I make this, I slice the eggplant and put the slices on paper towels.  Salt it on one side and let it sit for 5-10 minutes.  The acid will bubble to the top.  Wipe the slices off, turn them over and repeat the process.  This removes the acid that irritates the inside of some people’s mouth.  Then proceed with the recipe.

I made this delicious meal! Of course I didn't read the whole thing and I left the skin on LOL. It still was amazing. I only did 1 layer using a small single eggplant since it was just for myself.  Also, I realized late I only had sliced pepper jack cheese!! Well it actually was delicious!! I loved the kick!!

This is definitely not a long enough cook time. Also, the eggplant slices did not brown or crisp up adequately in the prebake stage, and I even gave them a few additional minutes. It did not replace frying, which was the point of the recipe.

Pretty simple and good! I did have to salt the eggplant for 30 mins just to get the bitterness out. Just make sure to rinse it out well.

The only thing I will do next time, is add more cheese. I felt like the  very top layer was a little saucy and could do with cheese, but that could be my fault. Overall, it was REALLY good! I loved it! My sisters ate thirds!

This is the BEST eggplant recipe ever.  I am dairy free so I don't use any cheese.  I just layer with eggplant and sauce.  In my opinion you don't need the cheese, it's that good.  I don't sweat my eggplant, no idea why people do that?  I use three large eggplants and make a large pan and smaller one.  You only need 2 1/2 cups of breadcrumbs and way more than 2 eggs for breading.  I think I use 5-6.  You also need to bake the eggplant  for 10 minutes on each side. Cut your eggplant very thin and it will come out so much better.

I had some eggplant in my garden and was looking for a simple, but tasty, recipe for it.  Tried this  one and it was great!  I used my great grandmother's veggie slicer to get the perfect slices and I also threw in some diced green bell pepper (also from my garden) when assembling the dish.   Even my dad liked it and he's not big on eggplant!  Will definitely make it again.

Couldn’t even eat!  The eggplant was rubbery and terrible.  I should have fried it like I was going to, but followed the recipe.  I’ll stick with fried eggplant sandwiches from now on.

Worst eggplant Parmesan I ever made. I've made a lot. The eggplant remained raw even though I sliced it thin, less than 1/4 inch, baked it for 20 minutes instead of the 10 recommended. The bread crumbs soaked up all the sauce. Basically, not very good. I will not make this again, nor do I recommend that you try it.

I made it as directed. It seemed dry as if all the sauce was absorbed by the eggplant or crumbs.

Delicious I would add more eggplant. I also made a homemade red sauce with beef inside and I added more than 6 cups. Also made a homemade white sauce for more creaminess

I made it last night, very good. I baked the eggplant slices twice as long and at 375. I wanted them a little crispy, so the dish wouldn't have soggy eggplant slices. We loved it and will be making it again. I also added some mushrooms that I had, and used alot less cheese, about 1/2.

Pre baked eggplant twice as long. Should have been higher than 350 degrees. Later discovered it was still hard. 

Assembled as directed. 

Bread crumbs permeated sauce and this was not appealing. 

The whole taste appeal of dish was nil in our home.

I've only cooked eggplant once in my life. This was easy, delicious, cooked perfectly. I tried it twice and great with both lots of sauce and a little sauce. Will be making again.

Baked the breaded eggplant slices for 25 mins to get a better crust. Also, didn’t want to use egg so I first dipped in flour, then unsweetened almond milk and finally the breadcrumbs.  Delish!

I would recommend taking the advise of others and sweating the eggplant and cooking much longer than 5 minutes. It came out pretty good, but I think the eggplant could have been cooked longer. It's very good, although at the end of the day, it's eggplant.

Excellent flavor.  Used suggestions from reviewers:  Only 2 good sized eggplants and salted the slices first for 30 minutes, dried, and baked for 6 minutes per side.  Mixed 1/4 c. of grated parmesan with 3 c. of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs which was about 1 c. too much.  Also only used about 4-1/2 c. of sauce which was plenty.

Made this for friend and they loved it. They request it everytime I see them. They like spice, so I did add red pepper flakes and made my own bread crumbs because of a food allergy.  Amazing.

I made this using the ingredients listed except used Panko seasoned bread crumbs.  Did not measure exactly but was in the ball-park of the measurements shown.  It was delicious.  Tasted like a vegetarian lasagna.

We loved it- and my husband is not normally an eggplant eater.   I added some Italian herbs to the bread crumbs, used a zip lock bag,  used fresh Parmesan and mozzarella (bags from the dairy aisle), used parchment paper which I sprayed with Pam (and lightly sprayed the eggplant too). Cut way down int the normal amount of fat you normally get.  A  do-again recipe!

I have made eggplant Parmesan before, and unfortunately I have lost previous recipes I’ve used. I gave this a try and it was amazing! I did also add Italian seasoning to the Italian breadcrumbs, and I also added some fresh basil, but regardless this was one of the best eggplant Parmesan dishes I’ve ever made. My hubby also asked for it again!! This is definitely on my list to make again!!!

I love this recipe. The only tip I have is that next time we make it, we’re going to nuke the eggplant a bit before we put everything together, as it was still a bit raw after baking. Could just be our oven? The flavor was as good as I have ever tasted.

This was delicious!  It was so much easier than frying the eggplant slices and much healthier.  I will definitely make it again and very soon!

This eggplant Parmesan was the bomb! So good! All my guests loved it!! To make it extra special like an eggplant parmigiana I had in Liguria, Italy, I added prosciutto in between the layers! Yummy!!

It's so flavorful! I think the eggplant needs to cook longer. I used two eggplants which was plenty. I will very likely make this dish again.

I made this but I'm on a low carb diet so  dipped my eggplant in 2/3 almond flour, 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese, and 1/2 cup of  of Italian bread crumbs.  Also fried the eggplant in Olive Oil because I wanted some healthy fat and it made them super crispy  then  finished them off in the oven.    Used 1/3 cup of grated Parmesan cheese and 12 oz of mozzarella because that's all I had.  It tasted amazing.

Followed recipe exactly...Took it out after 35 minutes as the instructions state, it was completely raw. So we put it back in and turned the oven up. Hungry and waiting patiently. Not happy..

This recipe is great! I followed some suggestions: cut slices about 1/4 inch thick, salt and let sit for a half hour and then rinsed and potted dry, dredged in flour, then egg, then Panko bread crumbs. Placed on parchment paper and baked at 450 degrees, 10 minutes per side. My husband who hated vegetables and has never eaten eggplant had 4 pieces!

Turned out great. Easy and fast prep with better than restaurant flavor. I cut the eggplant 1/2 inch thick though, as that is how we prefer it.

I listened to other reviews and sprinkled salt on both sides of the eggplant and laid them on paper towels, flipping, and blotting them for an hour.  ALOT of water came out!  After I dipped in egg and breadcrumbs,  I put them in the oven for 10 min, then flipped them and ut them back in for another 10.  While they were in the oven, I also put thinly sliced onion on a cooking sheet and roasted it as well. (onion roasted for 20 min.  I didnt turn it)  
After it came out, I poured a jar of Prego in a 9x13, put one layer of the eggplant on top, THEN I laid all the roasted onion slices on top of the eggplant, THEN a layer of sliced fresh mushrooms, THEN a can of drained whole plum tomatoes.  Sprinkled a bag of mozzerella cheese on top of the plum tomatoes, then laid another layer of eggplant, then a jar of sauce,  a little mozzerella, and parmesan cheese and I sprinkled dried basil, a little garlic powder, italian seasonings on top.  Covered the whole top in foil and baked for an hour at 350.  MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVED THIS!  It is amazing!

Very Good recipe.  Time consuming but worth it.  My family does not like the bitterness of eggplant, so I peeled and sliced my eggplant, coated in salt, placed in a colander and covered with a very wet paper towel to "sweat out" the bitterness for 15 minutes.  Then thoroughly rinsed and patted dry before putting in the beaten eggs.  I used Panko breadcrumbs, Italian seasonings and parmesan cheese mixed together for the dry mix.  Then baked at 450 degrees at 7 minutes on each side.  Placed in baking dish with sauce and mozzarella cheese and baked again at 450 degrees for 17 minutes.  I found these suggestions and my alterations helped a lot.  Thank you for the recipe!!

A good basic recipe; I'd only add that 35 minutes in the oven isn't enough to completely cook the eggplant.  And though I suppose it depends on which eggplant you choose, the three I picked for this dish were more than enough; two good-sized eggplants should be enough.  Like another reviewer mentioned, I'd highly recommend making your marinara from scratch, simply a better tasting sauce...

This recipe turned out great! Several reviews recommended salting the eggplant slices and crisping them longer in the oven, and these were both great suggestions. In fact, I accidentally burnt one pan and they were the tastiest pieces. Next time, I'll buy one fewer eggplant and bake them much crisper.

I used this recipe to make eggplant Parmesan for the first time and I thought it was great! The only thing I would change is the baking time of the breadcrumb-coated eggplant slices; 5 minutes per side was definitely not enough to get them crispy.

Turned out amazingly well.  Everyone loved the flavor of the breading.  Only modification is that after I sliced the eggplant, I  generously salted (course kosher salt) both sides and rested it in a colander for about 40 minutes.  This process helps pull out some of the water from the eggplant and bitterness.  I rested the eggplant on paper towels and then placed another layer of paper towels on top to pull out more water.  I put a cast iron on top of the eggplant slices for added pressure.  After this, I followed the directions accordingly.  I did add shredded pecorino romano to the mozzarella, which added a nice flavor for the topping.

It was simple and delicious     After baking eggplant got impatient and broiled it.   Added more spices to sauce to taste and cooked at 350 for 35 Mins       Served with pan cooked shrimp, calamari and garlic bread.  Out of sight.   Recipe fine just added more taste.   Hubby really liked it

1.29.18  I sweated the eggplant slices just as many other reviewers have done.  Salted the slices, placed them on a rack over a foil-lined cookie sheet, and let them sit for 30 minutes.  I then put the slices into my water-filled salad spinner, spun for about five times to remove the salt, drained the water, and then gave it a really good spin which got the eggplant pretty dry.  After breading, they went back onto the same rack, and into the oven for about 25 minutes.  Since both sides of the slices were exposed to the heat, there was no need to flip halfway through, both sides crisped up nicely.  I checked for doneness, they were just slightly undercooked and a light brown, so then I assembled the casserole. Honestly, I didn’t measure anything, just eyeballed quantities.  Would recommend that you use a spaghetti sauce that you really like because that definitely will be what you taste the most.  I used a jar of Priano Spicy Garlic Arrabbiata Pasta Sauce from Aldi which has lots of flavor and just a little kick.  I love eggplant parmesan, but have never before made it, but I certainly will be making this again.

In our house we do use jarred spaghetti sauce and tastes just as good.  Used only two eggplants and baked a while longer and it came out SUPER!!  This is a keeper for sure.

I've made this twice now and it's a hit at our house. I do agree though that it needs to bake longer for the eggplant to become tender, unless you are using small eggplant. The second time, I didn't add the sauce, just topped with mozz and parm till melted and served it with Chicken Cacciatore and whole wheat pasta for an awesome comfort meal.

Overall, a delicious dish!  The recipe doesn't mention much about how to slice the eggplant.  I would suggest thin slices and would bake them longer than the suggested 5 minutes.  Also, I would only use one large eggplant.

We used one large eggplant and it was plenty! We just did the eggs and breadcrumbs as needed. We went light with the cheese and the sauce, and baked the eggplants before assembling for 15 minutes each, flipping every 5 minutes. We baked until the cheese melted, and then left the dish in the oven turned off while we made quinoa gluten free noodles. So good!

Before trying this recipe I always deep fried my eggplant for Eggplant Parmesan, but the oven backed turned out perfectly wonderful, delicious, and way healthier!! I also did the same baked breaded eggplant for my Eggplant Alfredo Parmesan and it turned out fantastic!

This was my first time making it, and it didn't work out.  The eggplant was WAY undercooked.  The recipe is also a bit vague - how thin is thinly sliced?  How many slices should you have, even approximately?  Three eggplants seemed like a lot (I had leftovers compared to the amount of sauce & cheese and room in my pan.  After baking the eggplant, should it be golden brown?  Mine was not - really didn't cook at all - what was the point?  The flavor was good, but it was barely edible.  I'm not sure why the reviews are so high  . . .   I see others (in hindsight) gave it 5 starts, but altered the recipe by either frying the eggplant (defeating the point) or raising the oven temp and/or cooking time.

Everyone was right, hands down the best recipe! I had never prepared eggplant before finding this recipe. I was super nervous because I didn’t want to mess up the eggplant. I read the first few reviews and even watched the video and did everything exactly as written and suggested. I couldn’t have been more happier with the way my Dish turned out! It was so delicious, I just kept eating and tasting away! Totally will recommend this recipe, thank you so much! I so so love this app!!!!

The only changes was using one nice size egg plant for three
of us and it was more than enough. Reduced the rest of the ingredients to accommodate. The results were amazing. Very delicious. I added some panko to the breadcrumbs and the finish was nice a toasty. I told my husband next time I'll bake the egg plant, but add grated parm cheese to the breadcrumbs, and make a marinara sauce for dipping. It would make a yummy appetizer. Thank you we truly enjoyed baked egg plant

Baking the eggplant rather than frying was great.  Much lighter and flavorful.      Fewer calories was a plus as well. I've made several recipes for this dish in the past and this one is a keeper.  I did add a personal touch that others may or may not like.  I sweated down a sliced red onion in a little butter and balsamic vinegar,  almost a relish, then added that to one of the layers.  Nice touch of sweetness.

This recipe is delicious. It’s going to be as good as the sauce you use, however. You could even make your own sauce to layer the dish with (not necessary though!). Yum!!

This recipe is delicious.  My husband who is a picky eater ate two large helpings.    I used parchment paper on my cookie sheet as was suggested and it was perfect and did not stick.    I was so glad to find a recipe that you did not have to fry the  egg plant in oil. That is not necessary at all.    I left it in the oven for 10 minutes and then turned it for another 13 minutes.   Since it is just my husband and I, I used one large eggplant and 
sized  down the other ingredients to match up with that  and making two layers in my 9x9 casserole dish.  Perfect!!

I made the recipe exactly as written. It was ok, but would have been phenomenal if they would change the instructions to increase the bake time of the eggplant, or change the temperature. My eggplant turned out tough instead of tender.  I was bummed because I was trying to introduce eggplant to my hubby and kids.

We liked this a lot.  Sweated them in salt for about 30 min, rinsed, and patted dry.  Baked at 450 for 12 min. (no turning).  Used Italian panko.

This is a very good recipe, especially for vegetarian guests. Three eggplants are way too much.  I used two and had lots of eggplant leftover.  Also, it is important to rinse off the salt after draining the eggplant.  Next time I will use a four cheese combo instead of the mozzerella and parmesan.  It should be tastier.  The recipe is easy but still takes time to do all the steps. And the eggplant needs 15- 20 minutes of baking prior to the layering process.

Made exactly as listed as far as preparation but cut way down on amount. Cooking for two. Used 1 eggplant . Really just eyeballed how much sauce & cheese. So much easier than I expected. And really delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

To be fair I never did like Egg Plant very much but I thought that the cheeses would improve the recipe, a waste of good cheese, egg plant sucks to put it mildly.

This was very good!  I also salted it first before breading it. I agree with other reviews that it needed to cook twice that amount. 
I do encourage you to whip up a quick batch of marinara. Saute an onion and some garlic then add 2 cans crushed tomatoes and a bit of salt and cook down. thats it! everyone loves it and it couldnt be easier. 
I am definitely making this again. Baking the eggplant makes such a difference!

Made this and we loved it!  My husband has never been a fan of Eggplant (& have to admit that I'm not a huge fan either) but I made this one and we really enjoyed it.  It was crispy on the outside (which I loved) and smooth on the inside.  I will definitely make again.

It's great to find a healthier recipe than my usual eggplant parmesan.  Don't get me wrong...my family and I love my standard one with the fried breaded eggplant, but we don't need all that oil!  Plus, it's wonderful to save time by not having to fry each slice of eggplant.  Baking the slices instead really helps lessen the time spent on an already labor-intensive dish.  Another bonus...less messy clean-up.

I have to say though that when I took the baked slices out of the oven, they did not look or smell nearly as tempting to eat some right away (like the lightly pan-fried ones do).  But I ate one anyway,  just to compare.  Gotta say, it wasn't the "OMG, this is sooooo good" experience that I have with my old recipe.  

I wouldn't bake the eggplant slices again if I were going to use them in a more naked recipe, BUT in the finished eggplant parmesan, it was hard to tell the difference.  Maybe not quite as tender, but for the "just noticeable difference" it makes, this recipe is soooooo much healthier and saves so much time!  I will definitely make it again and maybe not tell anyone which way I cooked it!

It was awesome, but I would use maybe 1-2 egg plants. My husband just loved it.

Dolores is "right on" with this recipe! I have baked my eggplant slices for years. My variation slices them about 1/4 to 3/8 thick and I add some parmesan ( dry grated) to my crumbs. Bake at 400, turning once, until they start to brown. Maybe 10 - 15 minutes. Then continue with the layered casserole.
    I like to make sure a few of those slices don't fit into the casserole and just eat them on the side!!!

Although I messed up at the end and put the final layer of cheese on before the eggplant, this still came out tasting delicious. I like that the eggplant is baked and not fried, but still has enough crunch to satisfy.

Great flavors. You do not need 3 egg plants, however. Two is enough. You do need to use another egg for coating before the breadcrumbs, as 2 were not enough. I would definitely make it again and like someone else mentioned, leave it in the oven for about 45 minutes rather than 35.

This high rating is because it was so clear and straightforward and seemed to have rave reviews from many. I wanted a no-hassle recipe because my eggplant was old from holding in fridge a bit too long and the skin had lost its deep purple color. Was it still salvageable?   I did not want to waste it or try something exotic with it so I went ahead with prepping late at night.  After slicing and peeling and tasting raw the eggplant still seemed fine. The simplicity of this recipe inspired me to go ahead and make it into a parmesan. 

The breading & baking worked great. Modifications included coating my ancient baking pan with a light coat of olive oil, chopping a Spanish onion, browned and added to the canned sauce sauce, and using fresh mozzarella.  It looked great coming from the oven and a corner test indicated it tasted as good as it looked. I will refrigerate the casserole dish and reheat-bake tomorrow.

I love this recipe of the Eggplant-parmesan!  I love the idea of breading the eggplant to make it taste better and hold it's shape.  And pre-baking the slices before building the dish is a nice way to keep it crunchy!  This is now my go to eggplant dish.
Thanks

I made my own sauce, I reduced to 2 eggplants and sliced one vertical and one horizontal as I wasn't sure how the recipe wanted it to be done, I went through more eggs and bread crumbs than the recipe called for.  perhaps an idea of how thick/thin the slices should be would have helped.

I followed this receipe to the "T" and the eggplant came out crunchy.  I did 5 minutes on each side, should've been 15 minutes on each side.  35 minutes should be 45 to 50 minutes.

I'm recooking this again.  UGH!

I added cooked ground beef to the spaghetti sauce, added seasoning but cooked the eggplant as recipe said and everything turned out wonderful. My husband loved it and we will make again. This turned out more like an eggplant lasagna and it worked for us!

The recipe is great, as it is, but I am following a low carb-low cal diet, so I had to make some changes.  I baked the eggplant slices both sides (sprayed with pam, garlic salt and pepper) and layered them with tomato sauce, mozzarella and parmesan, finishing with parmesan. It is an eggplant lasagna and the next time I will add tomato with meat sauce. Just when I want a little splurge. I personally like the breading, I just eliminated it for calorie saving purposes.

This was my very first time cooking with eggplant. I was drawn to this recipe because it was no-fry and highly rated. I planned to use homemade meat sauce and fresh mozzarella, so the eggplant was the only true wildcard. I used this recipe as a guide, rather than following it exactly. After viewing other comments, I opted to cook the eggplant at 400* and for slightly longer cooking times. I also had to use an additional egg. Still, I was very pleased with the final entree.

Wonderful dish!!!  Made it last night for dinner and we both loved it.  Didn't make any changes to the recipe except maybe a little extra cheese.  The eggplant does take about 1/2 hour to really crisp up so allow time.  Will make again for sure.

I have never made Eggplant Parmesan but plan to make it again!  Loved it! I made it per the recipe with the variation of  dipping the eggplant in the egg mixture  then the  bread crumbs and putting it on 450 degrees for 5 minutes per side. They were a little crispy and delicious!! After they were done I added the  the sauce and parmesan cheese at 350 just long enough to get the cheese melted! Great the next  day for lunch!

Did what others had mentioned. Salted the eggplant first. Also used 2 large eggplants 4 eggs and baked initially for 15 min total. Then I crisped one side of the eggplant slices under the broiler for a minute-- then building the parmigiana and cooking as suggested. Delicious.

I like it but I did add to it. I made a ricotta cheese mixture and I put it after the sauce. Also I pan fried the eggplant I wasnt sure about oven cooking

Really good, but a very time-consuming pain to make (hence only 4 stars). Notes to self for next time (because there NEEDS to be a next time!):
1.) Only use the egg-shaped eggplant, not the long snake-like kind. Bigger slices mean less dipping time and less hassle.
2.) Make sure your bread crumbs are FINE and DRY. It would be worth buying the store-bought kind for this. Otherwise, the egg mixture comes off on them, and they end up gooey, and the eggplant slices don't get breaded.
3.) You'll need at least 4 eggs.
4.) Don't skimp on the sauce.
5.) Make an extra-big batch and freeze some so you can get two meals out  of not much more work.

This was wonderful exactly as is, but to transform it to a main meal I added pre-cooked meatballs (quartered) and pre-cooked mozzarella sausage (sliced into discs) to the eggplant layers.  Scaled back to 1 eggplant and a smaller casserole dish, as it was just my wife and I. Served with a green salad.  DeeLishus.

If I did it again I would do with half Italian and half Panko bread crumbs and fry rather than bake for a crispier crust.

This is an awesome dish.  Very easy to make and no frying! I made a small change and dipped the eggplant in egg  before and after the bread crumbs and layered with onion slices and zucchini as well.

Very good! It tastes just like Lasagna, which is nice since I had to find a way to cut out as many  "bad" carbs in my mom's diet and she loves lasagna.  I did read the reviews and made a couple of adjustments (which is why the 4 star rating, it's five with my adjustments). I did use jar sauce (which is fine, you just have to KNOW your jar sauces and never use them as they come, always "doctor" them), and it turned out perfectly fine, despite other reviewers claims that  jar sauce is a no-no or something.  (I mean, homemade it always better, but I don't have the time!).

at $2.69 a ppound for eggplant, we'd be better off just buying skinless chicken or veal.  Cannot afford to spend over $15 on a single meal.  I wish these recipe sites would be a little more practical on ingredient choices

I made this last night and found this recipe to be a lot of work and the whole thing tasting bland. I ended up needing more eggs and much less bread crumbs. I wouldn't make this again.

Delicious, with a lot of flaws. First off, double the eggs and halve the bread crumbs. Second, double the baking time and increase the temperature for the eggplant slices. I did mine for 10 mins a side at 400 degrees. But my biggest complaint is the time. This. Took. For. Ever. Baking the eggplant slices added an insane amount of time to the overall prep time. So much that I almost wish I'd deep fried - health be damned. I didn't get dinner on the table until 930pm. It was delicious, but I'm never making this again.

This was excellent!!!  My husband and daughter say that this is a keeper.  
After reading some comments I did sweat the eggplant for 30 minutes.  To make this a little bit more healthier (husband has diabetes) I used ground almonds and Italian seasonings instead of bread crumbs.
I tried the  "shake n bake" method, unfortunately the almond meal absorbed a lot of moisture and would not coat all of the eggplant slices after a while, so I may try to dredge it next time and see if it coats better that way? 
This is now a family favorite, thank you so much for the recipe.

I followed the recipe but did sweat the eggplant slices for about 30 minutes,then rinsed  the excess salt off with cold tap water and dried them with paper towels. I also used my homemade sauce. This was the first time I tried baking the eggplant instead of frying it and was very satisfied with the way it tasted. I served this with fettuccine pasta tossed in a light garlic butter and topped with more of my homemade sauce, sprinkled some chopped parsley over the top for some "green" and crusty bread. I'll make this again!

It was very good!  I will make this recipe again!   However,  If you are worried that the eggplant might be bitter, slice it, then salt it liberally and allow it to drain for an hour or so before cooking.

I baked the eggplant slices for 10 min on each side at 350 and then baked the assembled dish for the suggested 35 min at 350. This left the eggplant with the exact right amount of firmness. I think only baking 5 min on each side would leave it a bit too firm. I sprayed some oil on the pans before baking the eggplant, which helped it a bit with browning. I did not peel the eggplant or let sit with salt. (I just don't find the taste of eggplant bitter, salt or no salt.) The next time I make it, I'll spend some time on the sauce. I think a tomato sauce heavy on garlic and basil would be a nice complement.

I was eager to try Eggplant for the first time (I am trying to add new things to my diet) . I assumed it was a healthy choice- then I found out it has Lectins - a thing that slowly attacks your immune system - A DOCTOR SAID AVOID AT ALL COST!!!
just a friendly reminder for anyone reading this - btw in general it was an ok dish tasted eh -

Before breading, I peeled some of the skin off. After breading I placed on racks and baked for 30 min at 400. I added a layer of provolone cheese along with the mozzarella and parmesan.  Covered in tinfoil and refrigerated until next day when I cooked it for  35 min. at 350.  Delicious.

Amazing. Loved how it comes out with baking the eggplant - I had always fried it but see there's no need. I followed what others said and drew the water out first, then baked the breaded eggplant at a high temp. Used good quality sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese, and husband said was amazing

I used 1 large eggplant, sweated in kosher salt for 30 mins, 3 eggs, 1.5 cups breadcrumbs and baked on parchment paper at 440 with a drizzle of olive oil for 8 minutes on each side.  After the eggplant was baked on each side I followed the recipe to finish in the oven but added oregano on top with the basil.  Delicious!!!! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I did as others suggested and after peeling and slicing eggplant i sprinkle with salt to allow eggplant to sweat for 30 mins or so. Rinsed and then layered between paper towel. In the meantime beat my eggs and put my Italian bread crumbs in a 9x9 pan. I just threw all the eggplant in the eggs and mixed with my hands to coat. Then covered in crumbs. My husband and son and all..i do mean all of my family has always raced and craves my lasagna for over ten years... My husband just informed me this is the replacement and lasagna is now number two.  Whaaaat!!???

This recipe was easy, but it took longer that anticipated to make.  I used panko bread crumbs (that's all I had) and added Italian seasoning. It turned out delicious! I love the how to video for this recipe.

I only had one eggplant so made in a 9x9 pan as a side dish and proportioned ingredients down. It was delicious and whole family raved. Didn't need as many Italian breadcrumbs as recipe called for even when proportioning down. Will make again. Super easy recipe

I followed others advice and salted the eggplant first and baked for 10 mins each side, otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious, the best eggplant I have tasted.

It was pretty good, but it didn't seem like the five minutes in the oven on each side did much for the eggplant slices, and the bread crumbs didn't cook hardly at all. I don't think they were too thick on there. The eggplant did cook all the way through, which was good. But I feel like a different type of breading could be better.

I salted the egg plant first, and I don't think I rinsed it well enough. It was a bit salty.

Delicious and easy! I think you can get away with only using two eggplants. I used three and had so much left over. My whole family enjoyed this recipe. Will definitely make it again!

I made a simple sauce of tomato purée, onion, garlic, basil, crushed red pepper flake and parsley. I used that instead of jar sauce but otherwise followed the basic recipe. The dish tasted very good. I prefer the eggplant fried but opted to keep the dish healthier. I would make it the same way again. My compliments to the recipe.

Excellent recipe! This was my first time cooking with eggplant and it turned out wonderfully! As previous reviewers suggested, I did not peel the eggplant, but salted the 1/4 inch slices and let sit in a colander in my sink for 30 minutes first. I didn't have sea salt so I used regular salt instead. After rinsing and patting the eggplant dry with paper towels, I seasoned them lightly with salt, pepper, garlic power, and onion powder before dipping them in egg followed by Italian breadcrumbs. I lined a cookie sheet with foil and sprayed a coat of Pam on top before placing the eggplant slices on top. I set the oven to 425 and cooked them for about 13 minutes each side. Once finished, I layered the bottom of a Pyrex dish as indicated in the recipe using Classico traditional sauce, eggplant, and Kraft Italian five cheese blend (Parmesan, mozzarella, provolone, Asiago, and Romano). For the top, I layered eggplant, sauce, then topped everything off with cheese and baked at 425 for 20 minutes. 1 eggplant made about 3 servings. I can't wait to cook this for friends!

I made this with the adjustments that other reviewers suggested but I found it came out ok. I didn't cover it as it was baking, idk if that would of made the difference. All the work that it took me to prep this and it didn't "wow" me, I won't make this again.

This was okay. Nothing special. I would skip the breadcrumbs if I made it again as they just added a layer of mush around the eggplant. My sauce was  very good so it was edible. I may mash it all up and use as a dip.

I loved the crunch before all the sauce, however it calls for way too much eggplant, and the flavor was bland. My husband had to do a lot of sprucing up to it to give it more flavor. To be fair, he didn't put sauce on the bottom, so it stayed crunchy, which in the end I felt it needed more sauce.

So delicious. Made it with homemade spaghetti sauce. Also used a mixture of cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. I also baked the eggplant for about 6 minutes of each side before I dipped it in the bread / egg. From there, I baked them again in the oven for about 6-7 minutes on each side. Came out incredibly delicious. Will be making it again soon.

I make a half-recipe, following most of the tips of the top reviewer. I used an Italian blend cheese, but it didn't seem to melt as good as a straight mozzarella cheese would. Nice recipe, though.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for a couple of years ago, I have never changed the recipe and every time we have a potluck lunch at work, I get an overwhelming amount of people asking me to make this! I have made it probably a dozen times now and it is always fantastic.

A great basic for me.  Removing the brown, bitter taste from the eggplant is truly necessary.  I've tried it without salting and the bitterness does come through a bit, but enough to notice. I use organic multigrain bread crumbs and add my own seasonings - dried garlic, and pepper. I added dried basil, garlic, parsley and a wonderful spice called mushroom truffle mix to the egg mixture, let the spices open up before dipping the eggplant. By lightly spraying olive oil into a large nonstick pan took much less time than baking. I shake off excess breeding and follow this recipe. It turns out perfect. Laying the eggplant, sauce and cheese on organic spinach linguine sealed this as a go to for any occasion.

I used several sweet onion slices, banana pepper and garlic in a purée added to the sauce to lighten it. Turned out great. I also added yellow and zucchini squash to the top.

I ended up using six eggs and almost an entire canister of breadcrumbs.  Baking all the eggplant slices took much longer than I'd expected and ended taking a half time break and refrigerating the eggplant after baking.  Put it all together the next day and it came out perfect. Reheats well too!

I have never had eggplant before and I really love how this turned out!  I opted out of breading mine because my main dish, chicken, was breaded. I LIGHTLY evoo'd the 1/4" sliced and baked 10min on each side. In the dish I added a thin layer of spinach leaves.   The husband loved it so we'"" be having this again!  HUGE POINTER: for the sauce I used the recipe from "spicy spaghetti squash". Phenomenal:D.

Absolutely five stars!  Made E.P. many times with various recipes, but this was the best! I brined the eggplant slices overnight plus a few hrs., rinsed & paper towel dried, then followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, and it was awesome!  This one goes into my "book".

My meat eating family liked this and said it was a "Do Again" I liked it better than my old recipe because there was no frying or soaking. Very easy. 45 minutes from start to table.

Loved this recipe I left mine a little longer in the oven when baking the eggplant slices. I like mine a little more firmer.  One of my all time favorite recipes have made it several times and it never fails me.

I used only one eggplant, a little bit more than one jar of sauce, and 8 oz of mozzarella. I added ground beef to one and made a little side one without ground beef, because I had some meat to get rid of at the time. It tasted great, both of them. I make this recipe fairly often usually some with ground beef and some without both are good. It's easy and makes a great meal.

The tinned pasta sauce made it not taste great. It also was a lot of work for something that didn't actually taste that amazing. If making anything similar again, I would also add more cheese.

So much flavor! I used my own marinara sauce rather than canned, which I would suggest. Salting and letting the eggplants sweat made them so much more tender.

It was so much work.  Peel the eggplant   Slice it in even long elegant slices.  Salt them and let the bitter leach out.  Egg wash. Bread crumbs. Bake.  Make sauce. Assemble   And so on and so forth.   The end result was lovely but you really need to love the people you are cooking for to go through this much effort.

I used Panko for the bread crumbs because my family and I love the crunch it maintains when cooked. I added garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Also, I sprinkled the basil on each layer for more flavor. The sauce I used was created fresh from my garden which added even more of a fresh flavor. This recipe was great as a base line to go off of.

I did make several changes and yes, I will definitely make it again. Since there are only 2 of us, 1 eggplant sufficed as an entree. Therefore, I cut the recipe by 2/3. Since we also must watch sodium intake, I used (and always use) Panko breadcrumbs; they served us well in this recipe. The brand of Panko I use has 110 calories and 35 mg. of sodium in 1/2 cup. I also used a pasta sauce with only 120 mg. of sodium in 1/4 cup. We found no loss of flavor. Great recipe! Thank you. I forgot to add I baked this in my dual convection oven at 350 for 25 minutes, checked the eggplant and it was perfectly cooked.

needed to cook longer than stated.  Probably 30 to 40 min and should be cut thin.  Mine was a little too thick.  Would make again.  I salted and let it sit for 30 min then rinsed offf.  Cookie sheet needs some oil or sray on it to help it crisp.  Did mine on parchment paper - definitely needed some oil

My husband didn't know he liked egg plant until I made this recipe. Absolutely delicious! I would only suggest leaving the egg plant on the cookie sheets longer. I did 10 min one side & 15 the second side.

This was simply delicious.  I use an onion bun instead of bread crumbs and Prego sauce with garlic and herbs.  This will be one of our favorites.  I did use just one eggplant. There is no way the egg and bread crumbs will cover three.

I added salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning to the egg, and also used seasoned breadcrumbs.  I use some canola oil on the baking sheet to oven fry the breaded eggplant, and toss garlic cloves in the pan as well..I cook till light to medium browned. II always have home made sauce on hand (freezer)  I use lots of mozzarella, mixed with Italian cheese blend also, and grated parmesan and romano cheese. Always a big hit when I make this for gatherings.

The end result was good but the recipe was not accurate. It took me at least an hour to prep the meal, not 25 minutes as stated. There's no way that skinning, breading and baking the eggplant and then combining the marinara sauce and cheese takes only 25 minutes.  Also it recommends using 3 eggplants which would have required an additional 9x13 pan. 

Overall I give this four stars because it tasted good but it definitely took longer than expected.

I also sweated the eggplant slices with kosher salt for 30 minutes, rinsed and dried them well. Put a little EVO on the baking sheet at 425 for 5 -7 minutes on both sides or until crisp.

I made this without salting or peeling the eggplant.  I grilled the eggplant on the stove in a grilling type griddle.  (No egg or breading)  It came out delicious.   All six of us loved it!

Will make it again but definitely use more source and less cheese on the top. I followed the time given in recepy and the top came out burned. Was I supposed to keep it covered the entire time in the oven?

I've made the dish a few times...this last time I decided to omit the egg and breadcrumbs after reading a few reviews.  Honestly, the dish was just as good and a lot less work!   Leftovers are excellent, too.

Great recipe.  I always have to make eggplant parmesan for my son, who doesn't eat meat, when we have chicken parmesan.  I like this recipe because the eggplant wasn't soggy.  I also liked how it is sliced thinly and layered.  I use Rao's Homemade marinara.  Very easy to make and delicious.  Highly recommend.

it turned out perfect!  i used my own marinara recipe and sautéed the breaded eggplant on a plancha.  Probably used more cheese too and added a  chiffonade of fresh basil.  next time i will cook a little longer in the oven but it was a big hit.

In the pan I used, I was only able to fit 2 layers of eggplant  instead of three. I didn't have dried basil so I used dried Italian seasoning   I used 3 eggs instead of 2. 16 minutes in the oven instead of 10, turning over after 8 minutes. The end result was DELICIOUS.
I made a second  pan for a neighbor and we both agreeded it was Delicious. Will definitely make it again.

This was delicious. It is laborious to peel and cut the egg plant but well worth the effort. My family loved it and said it was better than what they order at the Italian Oven (a local restaurant ) Thumbs up, definitely!

Getting the saltiness right is a little tricky.  If you do not rinse the salt off of the eggplant slices prior to cooking, the dish can be too salty.  Wiping the slices with a paper towel is insufficient.

I cooked this dish tonight for dinner, but I started it last night, and I am so glad that I did. I used 3 medium sized eggplants (which is relative as to size). I took me a couple of hours to peel, slice, bread, and bake the eggplant. I did sprinkle each slice with salt, and let them sweat for 30 minutes. Then I laid them out in batches on paper towels and used another paper towel on top to absorb moisture. In batches, I dipped in egg and breaded, and laid them on the baking sheets. For the medium eggplants, I needed two large  baking sheets that are 20" x 15". So each baking sheet used a rack in my oven. I was concerned that baking two levels wouldn't bake them evenly. So I baked them separately at about 10 minutes per side. After they cooled, I put them in a zip-lock baggie for construction of the dish the next day.  For the breading, I needed 4 eggs and closer to 5 cups of breading crumbs. 

Tonight, I layered the spaghetti sauce ( 2 jars of Ragu), grated Parmesan, and mozzarella as described, but I used more Parmesan and mozzarella than called for in the recipe. I just used what was needed for each layer. All of the eggplant slices fit into a 9" x 13" casserole. Baking for 40 minutes at 350 degrees, the casserole was only 89 degrees. So I increased the temperature to 375 degrees and baked for an additional 15 minutes. At this point, the casserole was browned and at 120 degrees. Personally, I didn't care for it, but maybe I just don't care for eggplant Parmesan.

This is a simple recipe, easy to follow. By the time the cheese browned, the egg plant was mushy and the cheese was hard as a rock!  I might experiment on a small scale, but not for guests.

Good recipe, but eggplant needed to be baked longer to soften.  Casserole could have baked an additional 15 minutes as well.

I like that it was baked instead of fried, but it wasn't as tender as fried. I found it more involved than I expected. However, I appreciate the submission.

I never used this recipe before and this is my 2nd time making it ever. 1st time I made this,  it melted in your mouth and cut like butter, this time idk what happened..

I like that the eggplant is baked and not fried first.  However, too much sauce and too thinly sliced eggplant make this mushy.  Perhaps you could put an egg on top and call it hash.

I make this but slice my egg plant super thin and fry it.  Then I layer it with mozzarella cheese and dabs of ricotta cheese and more mozzarella.  I make my own home made marinara sauce I never use jar sauce.  I layer it like lasagna and bake it in the oven till its heated up.  My husband hated eggplant till he tried mine. The trick is slice it thin and change the oil when you are frying it.

Loved it, loved everything about it. I did bread and fry the eggplant before layering in the dish to bake. And, I made the sauce with some extra veggies like peppers and onions etc. This was certainly a fan favorite as soon as it came out of the oven. The leftovers got a bit soggy, but the flavors blended so well nobody could stop eating it. 10 out of 10 would make a gain!

I have never made Eggplant Parmesan before because I generally dont like it, but this was delicious! I used 2 eggplants, 3 would not fit in a 9X13 pan, and one was smaller.  I did use Mozzarella slices on the first two layers, and did cook the eggplant longer than the recipe says.  I would recommend adding some sauce to the top layer, my son the chef said it was too dry.  Very delicious and did not even need extra seasoning!

It was delicious....the only thing I did differently was a suggestion in another recipe to salt the eggplant slices to draw out water and bitterness. I then washed the salt off and patted dry the eggplant.

Outstanding. This will now be my "go to" recipe for Eggplant Parm after many years and many different recipes. The ricotta is the key!
I will admit I cheated a bit. I used frozen breaded eggplant! One of the reasons I don't make this dish more often is because of the time and effort it takes to prepare the eggplant. While I prefer using fresh when possible, I found that this simple change will make it much easier to have this more often! I couldn't tell the difference in the completed dish.
I also used my best friend's recipe for the sauce. She comes from a long, long line of Italian cooks and this sauce made this wonderful dish even more special!

I followed the directions, but instead of store spaghetti sauce, I used my own that I had canned.  

This is a great dish!  My husband ate most of it.  That is how much he likes it.  This is on my list to make again.

Thank you for the recipe!

Slice eggplant in 1/2" slices, generously sprinkle with kosher salt and place on colander for at least one hour to get the bitterness out. Take out and rinse well and pat with paper towel to dry.

Only gave this 4 stars because I needed to change the baking time to 20 minutes to brown the eggplant, otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars.

My first time making eggplant and i loved this. I salted the eggplant for 2 hours and baked it for 10 minutes per side, using parchment paper. Next time I will make this without salting to see if it makes a difference. I only used one eggplant and it was plenty for 2 people. Would not hesitate to bring or make for guests.

Didn't work for me. Salting  an peeling is not necessary. Egg dipping and bread crumbs stuck to the foil and the eggplant was not done in 5 minutes on each side. I let it cook 35 minutes and the eggplant was tough or not done. The recipe needs major changes. Very disappointed.

Made one-third recipe in a 7"X 11" baking dish, using one eggplant. Flavor was good, but I made changes as suggested in numerous reviews: sweated the eggplant slices, rinsed, patted dry; used ww homemade breadcrumbs seasoned with garlic, oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper; dredged the slices in flour, then egg, then crumbs; baked at 375 for twenty minutes on a rack without turning. After I placed the slices on the rack, I sprayed them with vegetable oil spray to facilitate crispness. Plan ahead? Discovered that I didn't have spaghetti *or* jarred marinara = / ... so threw a sauce together and used rigatoni.  I haven't made eggplant or chicken parm, so can't speak to the traditional recipe, but what I like is the crispy with the sauce and cheese, which won't happen with layering the slices in sauce. I sprayed the baking dish with vegetable oil spray, added a single layer of pasta, covered the pasta with sauce, placed the eggplant slices atop, put just a teaspoon of sauce on each slice, then sprinkled each slice with Italian blend cheese. Baked at 375 until bubbly, then turned to broil for a couple of minutes. Next time...just personal preference...I think I'll just assemble everything at serving so that the eggplant remains crispy. I may even increase the temp for baking the eggplant. I think a lower temp takes longer to crisp at the risk of over-baking the eggplant. Oh...and I prepped the eggplant in the morning. After rinsing and patting dry, stored in the frig layered with

This takes longer but worth doing. I got this from another reviewer.
 5 stars. Baking the eggplant instead of frying does not take away from the flavor of the dish one bit. Also, I chose to sweat the eggplant before breading by peeling, slicing, sprinkling with sea salt and placing in a collander in the sink for about 30 minutes. This pulls out any bitterness. Just be sure to rinse it well with water and pat dry with paper towels before breading. I did two layers of eggplant. You can layer however you like, you just to be sure the top layer of eggplant is topped with sauce and then cheese. I would also add 2 fresh garlic  next time.

Great base, I also added onions and mushrooms. Cooked eggplant at 450. Was a big winner with everyone. Its nice to have a great base recipe that you can play around with and several variations depending on your mood.

Have made this 3 times now in 3 weeks! Everyone loves it & likes that the eggplant isn't fried.  This is a great recipe & has been well received by a diverse group of people.   I did make minor changes , most were related to only wanting a 9" square panful.  I used one large Italian eggplant and adjusted the measurements for everything else by eyeballing it. I don't think you need to measure precisely for this.  I used Italian breadcrumbs and added some garlic powder, oregano and freshly ground black pepper.  I did find that I needed to bake the breaded eggplant for about 50% longer than suggested.(.at least 8 minutes per side).  I did two layers of eggplant/cheeses /sauce combo.  I also baked first 20 minutes with aluminum foil covering the pan, then removed for the balance of baking time. They cheese still got nice and melty and thick /chewy without being burned. Definitely a keeper!!

I will definitely make this again. I made modifications simply because I didn't have quite the same ingredients. I substituted muenster for the mozzarella and grated Parmesan for the shredded Parmesan. It came out wonderful. I'm not sure if it was because of the modifications or the altitude (5800 ft), but I did have to remove it from the oven ten minutes early. I love that this recipe is "no fry." Thank you so much.

OK, first off, pretty yummy recipe! Never had eggplant before and was looking for a semi-healthy recipe, thanks! I did make a few tweeks though, first, I only used 2 eggplants to feed 4 of us, and there were leftovers! I salted each slice and let it sit for about twenty minutes before rinsing in cold water, as per another suggestion, and then found that 2 1/2 cups of breads crumbs and two eggs sans yolks were plenty to cover all the eggplant slices and then some... I did choose to use Gluten Free garlic crumbs for a kick and then just the egg whites. Finally, I cooked the slices for 10 minutes a side, like someone else suggested for more crunchiness, and it worked.  This was very good and will definitely be made again!!

This was really simple and so good! I actually fried the eggplant before baking thinking it would be extra crispy, but it was totally unnecessary and I won't do it in the future. Definitely recommend a quick homemade sauce over jarred sauce - I think it works better to complement the flavor of the eggplant without overpowering. I also used fresh mozzarella instead of the packaged shredded kind and I think it made a huge difference. Not much more expensive either.

Very good.  I did bake the slices longer and hotter---400 for 8-9 minutes per side.  I didn't want them to get to soggy in the sauce later.  I couldn't tell the difference between this and the fried version so it will be my go to from now on.

This had all the richness of classic Italian restaurant Eggplant Parmesan, but without the guilt of the deep fried eggplant. I highly recommend salting and 'bleeding' the eggplants to give it the right consistency. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Very good. I like the fact that it's not fried. I used a good jar of sauce (Muir Glen organic). I followed the recipe and the top came out lightly brown. Ovens may vary; the eggplant was a bit undercooked. Next time I want to try cooking the eggplant  at 450, five minutes each side. And then finish it at 350 for 40-45 minutes. Highly recommended!

This is the millionth time I've made this. I usually add spinach to it but it's really good!  I've tried it fried too but prefer it baked. I use panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs too, and I sweat the eggplant for 30 minutes first. Very good

I had never bought an eggplant. I had never tasted an eggplant in my entire 50+ years. I finally bought one as I am trying to broaden my horizons in the veggie area. I looked up eggplant recipes, found this one and viola!! I made it!! Recipe was easy to follow and it turned out AMAZING!!! I loved it!! Will definitely be making it again!

Definitely only needs 2 eggplants, and more eggs. And a LOT more cheese :) I coated eggplant in flour before egg/breading, seems to have dried it out a bit but still delicious. Salted each layer, added a thin breadcrumb crust layer about halfway through cooking. Will definitely make again!

This was fantastic!  Everyone loved it.  I did not have any breadcrumbs, so I used a mixture or cornmeal, Parmesan, and Italian seasoning.  I did have to  bake for about 10 minutes and then broiled for 5 on each side so the baking was longer than shown in the recipe.  Will definitely be making this again.

Delicious but I'd say add a little more time to the baking to really cook all the way through

One of my family's favorite. It tasted like I was eating at a really good restaurant.  We all loved it. The first time I cooked it was on Valentine's Day 2015. It was perfect.

This was out of this world amazing! We had ordered this at a restaurant and it was nothing like this recipe. I can't recommend this enough.  I didn't  have any basil so I left that part out and we are a smaller family so I only used one large eggplant and layered it in an 8x8 dish but it was very impressive. Going into the recipe book for sure! Thank you so much for sharing!

The only thing I did different was sprinkle sea salt on the eggplant slices to sweat out the bitterness for 30 mins. Then I used fresh garden herbs in my breadcrumbs. This was a huge winner. Everyone in the family loved it.

I am giving this 5 stars for flavor.  3 eggplant ended up being double what we needed!  1 - 1 1/2 would have been perfect. However, the whole family loved the flavors, and I was delighted in the fact that it was a no-fry version!

Lined pans with wax paper before pre baking the eggplant. Used 2 eggplant, 4 eggs, lots of breadcrumbs, 1 jar pasta sauce and 2 tiny cans of tomato sauce.
Needs to be sliced very thin. It comes out so much tastier when thinly sliced.

I love this simple recipe, but choose to make my own marinara - using fresh vegetables and herbs from my garden.  I also slice the eggplant a bit thicker, soak it in salted ice water, and bake for about ten minutes on each side.  My family lives it!!!

First of all it's an awesome recipe.  I picked up 2 eggplants at our farmers market,  and there is no way I could have used 3 eggplants, except maybe the little scronny ones they have at the grocers.  I loved the baked part of putting the dipped and panko'd eggplant in the oven.  I have my oven at exactly 350 degree's and it took longer than 5 minutes to brown each side.  I would just keep an eye on your time frame.  I did not use any basil, because I forgot.  I was in a time crunch so I used canned Hunts Spaghetti sauce.  I went through two large cans and probably could have used 3.  I used a mixture of the cheeses I picked up at a large grocery chain.  The cheese contained an "Italian mix" of cheeses.  I used two 8 oz. packages.   It was a very very good recipe and everyone who got some loved it.

Loved it! Did Bake it longer on both sides till it was browned prior to putting it into the pan with the sauce. Cooking is defiantly not my strength,  however this was easy to follow.  My husband loved it!

Turned out great, but it takes much longer than it says - salting & sweating the eggplant adds 30 min & it took 20 min for the breaded eggplant to turn golden brown

Excellent! My wife says it is better than Johnnie Carinos. That is high praise. Prep time not too long. Very pleased with the finished product. We didn't use the spaghetti this time and it really didn't need it.

Taste was really good but 3 eggplants were too many and I ended up needing 6 eggs. It's VERY time consuming.

I have been making a similar version for several years now.  Because I eat 'low carb' I have been baking eggplant slices without breading them, then assembling the parmigiana as usual.  I mist the slices, both sides, with olive oil and dust with salt and pepper.  So long as I am judicious with the tomato sauce and cheese I can enjoy one of my favorite dishes.

Fantastic! Had 1 eggplant so I made it as a side to steaks. Hubs had 3 servings and he said he didn't like eggplant. I also salted and let it sit in a colander for about 30 minutes. I had picked it from my neighbors garden and made it that night. Can't wait to make it again.

It's very hard to find a meal for my family who are picky eaters and doesn't like the same thing but everyone ate it and the 3 yo. 
I did half the recipe,used panko bread crumbs and whatever seasonings I had.
Instead of baking it for over 30 mins, I used a little bit of oil and fried each side of the eggplants for 4 min,melted cheese over it under the boiler and severed over pasta.

This was DELICIOUS, and not very hard at all to make! Maybe a wee bit time consuming, but not bad at all! It was so, so good I was sharing it with the entire neighborhood!!!.. I will definitely be making this a lot more often, and in place of hamburger and spaghetti!.. Everyone loved it, and it was picture perfect, but I forgot to take a picture of it, before it was all gobbled up!!!:-) :-)

I've been on a spree to try out new and varied veggies with my family and, in that vein, I decided to try this recipe after reviewing this and several other eggplant recipes on this site. Now that I've made it, I must say that the end product is delicious and I recommend it to anyone and *especially* if you like eggplant. My wife, who detests eggplant, even ate and said that it was pretty good the second day (we liked it even better as leftovers the second day).

My two girls wouldn't touch it, unfortunately. They view all kinds of veggies with suspicion and I think that it carried over to this. That, coupled with my wife telling them how bad eggplant was really did this recipe in for them.

Excluding the personal drama at home, I definitely recommend this recipe. The eggplant came out perfect after baking and I could have eaten it up right then. Adding in the sauce and cheese just made it all that much better. I'm giving it 3 stars because of how the rest of the family took to it but if I were rating it based solely on my experience I'd give it 4.5.

This dish is really good!  I didn't have some of the ingredients needed, so I used what I had.  I had a shake n' bake bread crumbs that was parmesan crusted flavor and I didn't have mozzarella cheese, but I had fiesta blend of shredded cheese (shredded Monterey jack, cheddar, queso quesadilla & asadero cheese) and grated parmesan.  Oh, and no eggs, either.  I did bake the eggplant slices for 10 minutes on each side, since it seems everybody else pretty much prefers to do that, too.  So, all and all, still very delicious!

The final result was ok, but forgettable. When I got around to eating it I regretted that I used eggplants rather than chicken. I may have chosen a poor choice of sauce, but I enjoyed this less than simple spaghetti.

This recipe was fantastic. I salted and sweated the eggplant (only used 2, not 3), followed by a good rinse and drying, like everyone suggested. I baked the breaded eggplant in the oven at 450 for 7 minutes on each side, and followed the rest of the recipe verbatim. The taste and texture were PERFECT. I will be making this often.

This recipe is an excellent starting point for your family's new favorite dish! One large male eggplant was enough for DH and me to have second helpings for dinner as well as lunch the next day. I skipped salting/boiling, layered the breaded slices with parm. cheese EVERY level and used very little sauce (1/4 cup marinara) and moz. to avoid sogginess. Following other posters I baked the casserole in a hot oven (400) for approx. 25 minutes plus for a drier crispy top and tender but not mushy center (personal taste preference). We were out of bread crumbs so I crushed up plain croutons and added Italian seasoning to taste-- delicious! Served over spaghetti (with extra marinara to taste). Delicious left overs!!! In the future I'll  make full recipe and freeze half.

Didn't have mozz cheese in the house so I used Parmesan instead. Great flavor overall and easy to prepare. I followed the other reviews and let the eggplant sweat, washed and dried before using. I ran out of egg using two large eggs, so I added a third.

Easiest and best eggplant parm I've made yet! I used one large eggplant, baked for 10 min on each side, made my own sauce by sauteing garlic and onion together, adding tomato sauce, and then basil, the layered as suggested and baked for ~30 min. Thanks for an easier, healthier recipe!

I don't know what happened to my eggplant but it had an awful taste to it. I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe because I didn't soak the eggplant in water like some of the reviews mentioned? I don't know but it was not so good.

Delish! Next time use half the recommended amount of bread crumbs, I threw so much away.  I baked for 10 mins a side.  Will make again.

I made this for dinner and it was really good. I thought the skin was a little too chewy, then I came back to the video and read the instructions again...alas, I was supposed to peel the eggplants. I also baked the eggplants for 10 minutes before putting it all together.

This was good, but I had some trouble with the directions. I was thinking the sauce would be layered with the eggplant like a lasagna so when I saw that there weren't specific directions for layering the sauce I decided to layer it anyway because it seemed odd to just have the sauce at the bottom and the eggplant pieces layered with cheese by themselves.

This recipe was outstanding!! I have never made eggplant Parmesan before and it came out  picture perfect and delicious!! I did salt the eggplant like it said in the video, and I also drizzled them with olive oil before baking them the first time around. 400 degrees turning them twice about every seven minutes.

I have used this recipe many times.  However I prefer to slice the eggplant boil in salt water 30 seconds.  There is less calories this way and is still yummy!

This recipe was very plain. So I made my own homemade sauce with tomatoes, red peppers, mushrooms, cayenne, salt, pepper, basil and cheese, then followed the basic recipe. This made it absolutely amazing.

It was very good, my husband and daughter liked it. I've never used eggplant before, so I really should have used some of the recommendations of other reviewers when it came to preparing the eggplant. It turned out a bit too chewy for me for that reason, and I feel like the eggplant should have been cooked longer, maybe an extra 10 minutes? Other than that however, the recipe was very nice and it was eaten up. I added fresh spinach to the recipe, and used a mushroom  spaghetti sauce. Next time, I may add some onion. Really enjoyed this meal, thank you!

My family loves this recipe, especially my 10 month old.  I have managed to convince my kids that it is chicken and they don't complain one bit.  I use Panko bread crumbs to dip the eggplant in and bake it a bit longer for 20 minutes.  Other than that, put on some good whole wheat pasta and bon appetit!

Fantastic recipe, but I go light on the cheese otherwise I find it a bit salty. My meat-loving husband loves this dish and was emphatic about adding it into the rotation

I think maybe I couldn't pick an eggplant, or I didn't know how to 'draw out the bittnerness' right, or something, but... for some reason I wasn't too impressed with the eggplant part of this dish. The boyfriend liked it a lot, but I think I mostly liked the cheese. I'll try it one more time and revise my rating if necessary.

Superb dish!  My husband is on a new diet eating a lot more veggies and fish.  I tried this one, and it was a hit!  Kids think it's pizza, my husband is happy to have the eggplant not fried and tasting great.  I'm happy this is delicious and simple dish to make.

I used authentic Italian sauce, and next time I would only use one large eggplant and a smaller dish.  Also, use a slicer to cut the eggplant in thin slices. The ones I cut by hand were too thick and, as this was our first attempt at having eggplant in anything (ever), I didn't realize how gross the thicker portions would be.  I tried to cut down on prep time with the thicker pieces and really regretted it.  If I had behaved it would've been phenomenal. Everyone loved the flavor.   Followed recipe, except for my poor decision in slicing.

I kept the peel on and sweat the eggplant beforehand as other reviewers suggested, but I found the end result a bit too chewy and too salty.  I'll probably try it again, but slice the eggplant thinner.

Great tasting recipe!  After cutting up the eggplant, I took others advice and pulled the moisture out of it by using the sea salt.  It kept the eggplant from getting soggy, especially for leftovers.

Loved it, especially that it is baked not fried. Only change I would make is that it really takes more than 2 eggs, I had to use 4. I used smaller eggplant so I would not have to salt it. It was so good, even my (almost) 3-year-old loved it!

I had never cooked anything with Eggplant or in a parmigiana style before and used this Recipe as a reference to get the basics down, as a reference it was very good and I made very few changes. If your attempt at this recipe turned out flavorless as another reviewer claims than I honestly think you're using the wrong spaghetti sauce, most store bought ones are quite terrible in my opinion.

Great recipe. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it. I only used two eggplants, but adding one more as the original recipe said would not have made it worse.

Delicious!!  I couldn't believe how good it turned out.  I "sweated" the peeled eggplant slices, and I think that made the difference.  Used half the amount of mozzarella, and it was still yummy.  Used Prego traditional sauce.

OMG this recipe was unbelievable!!  I took it to Christmas dinner and it was a HUGE success.  The biggest sign for me that this is a great recipe that I will continue to make in the future...the kids loved it!!!  I thought for sure they would stay away from it, but all 3 kids at the family dinner tried it, ate it, and LOVED IT!!!!  I followed some of the previous reviewers suggestions and it came out phenomenal! (I sweat the eggplant for 30mins, I didn't have enough time to do it for any longer than that but still came out great; I also baked for 7 mins on each side).  I used egg whites only and Panko crumbs (love the crispy texture more than regular bread crumbs).  Next time I will use flour on each piece of eggplant before putting it in the wash, but otherwise, this was a fantastic recipe!!

I loved this! Seriously awesome. I always thought I hated eggplant but I was so wrong. The finished meal was delicious but apparently eggplant isn't supposed to be chewy although I didn't mind that, better than overcooked and soggy really, (I'm reading reviews here after the fact) so perhaps I will bake the eggplant like 7 minutes per side at a higher temp like other reviewers suggested. (I did the first bake 10 minutes like the video suggested and 25 minutes for the assembled meal since I only cooked one eggplant instead of 3.) Anyway you slice it, it was good. I also added FRESH basil which I think makes a difference and smells divine when cooking. Thank you Doery!

We get free eggplants from our food ministry and none of us know what to do with them.  Now we do!  This was wonderful!  I made if for our church Bible Institute and it was such a hit.

Liked the no fry version. Gave only 3 stars because it needed to be tweaked. Otherwise th taste basically depends on your sauce and quality of cheeses. 1. Bake eggplant slices until fairly soft or else they will end up chewy in your final dish. 2. Make sure your sauce is on the liquid side to give needed juice to the dish when baking. 3. Cover the dish with foil while baking to keep it from drying out and remove last few minutes for cheese to brown and bubble. I actually drizzled some olive oil over the top as the whole thing was just too dry. Know what to do next time now.

This is my go-to eggplant recipe. I sweat the eggplant first and use Panko breadcrumbs if I have them. I only use one can of tomatoes and and enough fresh tomatoes to make up the difference. We love this.

I too sweated the eggplant before baking.  Baked 7 minutes each side...could've been even a little longer for extra crisp.  I used way less sauce...half can of hunts (yes...the cheap stuff!) with pre-shredded Mozerella and Parm...a cup or less of each.  Some dried Basil and Oregeno....Baked at 350 for 20 minutes (we were hungry!!) and it was perfect!

This is DELICIOUS. And so so so easy. Oh my god. The bread crumbs really make it. Perfect thing for college, I've gotten tired of eating pasta day after day - I can make a big pan of this and it'll last me the week. SO YUMMY. Thanks for a great recipe.

Loved it.  Used homemade sourdough bread crumbs instead and added garlic, Italian seasoning, a little cayenne (always to give it a bit of a kick) and basil.  I will definitely make this again.

great recipe, just added lots of fresh parsley and basil in the sauce and slowly fried garlic.  Salting the eggplant does take the bitter taste away.

This recipe is sooo good.  1 1/2 eggplants was enough for my family and I used egg whites and part skim mozzarella cheese.  I used less than 1/2 the amount for both cheeses.  I also used a lot less sauce & bread brumbs than what was listed.  I sweated the eggplant as well.  I will definatley be making this again.

OMG, loved it. I made a smaller recipe as there are only 3 of us. I also made sweet Italian Sausage. My husband isn't a fan of Eggplant but he liked this. I did bake the first time for 10 minutes instead of 5 making it a bit crisper. MIL wanted to know if there was enough to have at another time. She never wants leftovers. Kudos to Doery

The recipe is good, but I agree with some of the suggestions made in other reviews. I used a rosa blanca eggplant, so I didn't need to peel or sweat the slices, but I did bake them longer--almost 20 minutes. Also, given the bumper crop of tomatoes and zucchini we have right now, I made a chunky tomato sauce with coarsely chopped onions, red and yellow peppers, zucchini, celery and lots of garlic. In addition, I had some grilled portobello mushroom caps left over from a barbecue and I layered those with the eggplant slices. It makes it a vegetarian feast and worth it if you have the extra time.

Very easy and very delicious! I waited until the last 15 min. to add the cheese and basil on top so it wouldn't get too brown. I took this to a family potluck and people I thought wouldn't even try it liked it!

This was excellent.  The only thing I did differently is cooked the eggplant after I had breaded it about twice as long.  It didn't look very crispy after just 10 minutes.  I used panko and it was so yummy!

OK, this is really, really tasty. Eggplant-hating husband even took seconds. Had a large eggplant, so one was plenty. Sweated it first, otherwise followed recipe. A keeper.

I'll try this again. I'd never cooked with eggplant and didn't know what to expect but it turned out pretty good - even my 4 apprehensive kids ate it. I used 1 very large eggplant and it filled two baking sheets. It was enough to do two layers in the 9x13 pan and have some leftover. Before breading, I salted and sweat it. Because I had two pans I did convection at 375 for 10 mins on each side. They were a great texture. Then I did 350 with sauce and cheese. The meal overall took awhile to prepare, but for a veggie meal on a night you have time, go for it.

Amazing!  This was super easy to make and turned out beautifully.  I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of the cheese.  I'm dairy free so we used Manchego (from sheep's milk) and it didn't seem any different.  I also had some leftover zucchini, so I made a few of those too.  It was all delectable.  I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious! Made with home-grown white eggplants. Baked on cookie sheet with cheese, but not in sauce which kept them crisp and not soggy. Placed them on top of speghetti and sauce. Yum!

This was very easy and very tasty! I halved the recipe, using one large eggplant and it turned out more eggplant would have been better. But the flavor was nice. I made my own breadcrumbs but  I found tbe breading got clumpy and didn't stick well to the  eggplant (which I also sweated, per other reviewers).  I think the bread was too moist. Next time I will dry the crumbs frusta. I'll also use fresh herbs, why not?

Very good recipe!  This is my first time trying eggplant and this seemed a pretty good/traditional way to try it out.  Breading and baking all the eggplant slices seemed like a lot of work, although probaably worth it.  Next time I may try just soaking it all in egg/milk mixture in a bowel and then shaking it all at once (or twice) in a ziplock bag with the breadcrumbs, and bake for ten minutes without turining.  Taste was very good although some of the eggplant seems a little bitter.  I think someone suggested peeling a little deeper or soaking in saltwater.  May be a good suggestion.

My family really liked this recipe, except that I did "sweat" the eggplant, rinsed very well & it still tasted quite salty. I will definitely try this again with just a few adjustments. Also, I used fresh basil & it added a great flavor. Tks for the recipe!

tried this for dinner, and it was my first try of making eggplant ever. It was pretty good. Going to make it again to see if I can work out my kinks with it! Is it normal to taste any saltiness to it, or is that just me not washing the salt off enough? Oh well! Still a great and easy dish :)

So easy and so good!  This is a keeper for sure!
I cut the recipe and used about two-thirds of the recommended ingredients, using an 8 x 8 pan (only making dinner for two) and it was great.
This was even better the 2nd day re-heated.

Very good! It was easy and fairly quick.  I used an oriental variety of eggplant and did not peel it.  I pretty much eyeballed the amount of ingredients in the layers because I reduced the recipe size somewhat.  My husband really liked it and he hasn't been a big fan of the eggplant so I consider this one a winner!

I only had 1 eggplant left and scaled the recipe down sort of proportionately. I also used fresh mozzarella, panko bread crumbs (as that is what I have on hand) with some thyme, basil and black pepper seasoning and I forgot to sprinkle the dried basil at the end. It is so good! I will definitely be making this again. And fresh mozzarella is the way to go.

The eggplant needs to be cut super thin and cooked longer than 5 minutes on each side. Other than that it was OK.

Wonderfu!! I just cooked this for my family and it was great.  My husband just kept on bragging.  I cooked the eggplant in the oven at 400 deg. for 10 min. on each side.  Then layered it according to directions.  Will definitely make it again.

This recipe is the very best...have shared this with all my cooking friends and all have said it better than theirs.  I make extra sauce cause I prepare the dish with angel hair pasta on the side and spoon on a couple of tbs. of sauce. I do slice and sea salt let sit as well to get rid of the bitterness but I let it sit in water for at least 1 hour. This is a 6 star recipe

Absolutely delicious. I heat the breaded eggplant in a nonstick skillet instead of the oven and then cook it as instructed. Not watery...perfect. My husband and I LOVE IT! Thanks!

This got awesome reviews so I thought in my quest to have more vegetarian meals I'd give it a shot.  Now maybe it's just me or maybe this is the way eggplant parmesan is supposed to be, but this is the very first meal I ever threw into the trash.  I made it as written and it was a slimy, soggy mess.

Delicious recipe.  I substituted the Italian bread crumbs for Italian Seasoning Panko bread crumbs.  I think another thing I'll change next time is the cooking time.  For me 35 minutes was a little too long and it dried out.. although the flavor was all there.

OMG! This recipe is so easy and so delicious. I appreciate a no fry alternative. I don't even bake the eggplant once it's coated, I just dip and start layering and it is so good. Go for a good buffalo mozzarella cheese, you'll be glad you did.

Delicious!  I tried keeping the skin on because I like eating the skin on most vegetables.  Next time I'll peel them because the breadcrumbs will stick better and it will be easier to eat!

Easy and totally excellent.  Had no mozarella so substituted swiss and traded basil for oregano. Prep time seemed much less.  Nice texture and very "meaty" for a vegetarian dish.

Great!   I did the 10 minutes per side like others have suggested and used 6 in 1 ground tomatoes with garlic, fresh basil, fresh oregano instead of spaghetti sauce and we love it!  I also put a layer of fresh tomatoes in there that was a nice touch

Healthy and delicious Italian dinner! I made a couple changes though as I only cook for myself and my boyfriend. Instead of regular bread crumbs I used panko, seems to make the breading hardier, which I like.I also only used half the recipr. Finally, instead of cooking in a casserole dish with sauce I simply put a spoonful of sauce and low-fat cheese on top of each cutlet after it had been cooked. I then popped it back into the oven to heat the sauce and melt the cheese. They came out wonderful and crisp!

I guess there is a reason that eggplant parmesan has been made the same way for generations.  This was good, but for me, just not as good as the traditional way eggplant parmesan is made.

Delicious! I recently became vegetarian and this dish is going to become a favorite for sure. After reading some reviews I sliced the eggplant very thinly and baked at 450 for 6 minutes, flipped, then baked another 6 minutes. I ended up with 3 layers of eggplant.

I made this last night and would like to know what I did wrong because it was too salty for me to eat.  I had the eggplant peeled really thick and I salted all the slices and let sit for about 30 minutes then rinsed them well.  I also dried them then preceded with the recipe but I may have gotten the "sweat" confused by salting them and not placing them in a saute' pan.  Anybody that can help me please because I was so looking forward to trying this dish.

This was the very first time I have ever cooked eggplant and it turned out great. The best part about it is that I whipped it together in no time at all. So simple but so good.

Absolutely delicious. Just one note that I might add to the recipe: thickness of the eggplant slices! Eggplant size/weight also might help. I bought two and did not realize they were gigantic compared to the standard eggplant. I also sliced them really thin (1/8-1/4 inch), so I was breading for a long time. 5 eggs and 3 cups of seasoned bread crumbs later, I had too much eggplant to even fit in the dish, so I have a whole packet of breaded medallions to freeze. This recipe was a bit time consuming, but I would definitely make it again.

I had never made eggplant parm and this recipe was very easy for a novice like myself. It's delicious and even my picky 4 year old eats it!

I did not like this at all. I have never tried eggplant before, so I was expecting something different. The recipe was great, but the eggplant was not my favorite.

So good! It is time consuming, but definitely worth it. All of my friends were so impressed! Remember to sweat the eggplant with salt and rinse before cooking, to get out all of the eggplant's bitter juices!

Awesome! I hate giving my family fried food so this offered a great alternative that i believe tastes better than fried. In fact, my wife who never liked eggplant actually enjoys this. I too salted and rinsed the 'plant before baking and that worked quite well. None of the infamous bitterness was detected.  Thanks for this great recipe, its a keeper for me!!!

Quite yummy.  I sweated the eggplant as recommended by other reviews and added onto the time on the original browning.  Through sheer luck of which grocery store I used, I ended up with whole grain bread crumbs.  I didn't notice too much difference from regular, and I'm sure the extra fiber doesn't hurt.

Very easy recipe and very tasty. Even my husband, who always wants meat for dinner, ate it & liked it. Definitely be sure to salt the eggplant before baking and bake for longer than 5 mins.

I really enjoyed this.  I needed to do it gluten free so I mixed rice flour and coconut flour in place of the bread crumbs.  I also added a bit of salt and cooked it a little longer.

I did not like this recipe very much. It tasted like it was not cooked long enough. I would not recommend this as a good dish to serve. It was pretty easy to make, but making can not describe the taste. Overall I was not very satisfied with this recipe.

This was good. I added spinach and mushrooms to the sauce. I could have dealt with a little more flavor though, maybe some red pepper. Overall good recipe though!

Very good, but I'm not sure it was the best. Took another reviewers advice and put the sliced eggplant in a collander and sprinkled with kosher salt and let it sweat for 30 minutes.

Thanks for the winner! I chose to salt the eggplant slices ahead of time to draw the water out, because I like the flavor and texture better. I used part spaghetti sauce and part of Bud's tomato gravy from this site. I also tossed in fresh basil instead of dried and soem fresh spinach. What a great way to use up tons of veggies from my garden last night!

This is a wonderful recipe! It's fast, tasty, and healthy. Now I look forward to getting eggplant in my foodshare!  My boyfriend balked at the idea of eggplant, but he loves this recipe. I usually just make one eggplant for just two of us and serve it over pasta. There's usually at least a lunch leftover, depending on the size of the eggplant and/or how hungry we are.

So, so good!  Made it for my boyfriend and brother and they ate the entire pan.  Eggplant took about 20 minutes per side to brown at 350, but I used home made bread crumbs so that would explain it.  Will definitely make again!

Yum. Hold off on the bread crumbs and use low-fat cheese for a healthier version!

My husband loved this dish! He loves anything eggplant and so I decided to make this amd he loved it. I used my own sauce recipe using fresh tomatoes and it was awesome! I also used fresh basil instead of dried.

Turned out yummy.... I am use to frying the eggplant, I found the baking to be just a little time consuming vs just frying in in minutes. I'm glad I tried this recipe it was worth baking because its healtier.

Iused 3 eggplants, on 3 cookie sheets and the sheets on middle rack and bottom rack never even got brown.  I guess I'd better cook one sheet at a time.  450 for 7 mins.  Then again when all was put together and served, I'm the only one who knows they were all not browned  :-)

Remember to sweat the eggplant after slicing but before baking to remove some of the bitter taste.   Also, there's no such thing as too much cheese.

I made this dish for my friend and I, and I thought it tasted great. Even my friend, who doesn't care much for eggplant, thought it was pretty good. My only criticism is the sauce made the bread crumbs a little soggy, but the flavour was good.

This was wonderful.  I also salted the eggplant and sliced mine about 1/4 inch, but in hindsight I would have gone a little thinner.

This was my first experience with egg plant and this was a good recipe.  Mind you, the actual egg plant taste was quite mild compared to the other flavors.  I used a jar of Classico sauce, 2 egg plants and extra cheese.  The only real change I did was too bake slices for 20 min.  Thanks.

This recipe is great. It does take a little bit of time but so worth it if my son is eating it. It's the first time I ever had eggplant parmigiana, and this was wonderful. Thanks for sharing your recipe. I did however use fresh mozarella that I sliced up instead of the shredded and the baking time took longer for it to crisp up.  It was great as leftovers also.

This was really good. I made it with just one eggplant and cut the pieces a little thicker, maybe 1/2 an inch, salted them, and let them stand while the oven preheated. I baked mine for 5 minutes on each side, as directed, but they could've gone for longer. Either way, it came out delicious and I will definitely be making it again! Thanks for sharing!

I have celiac so I used GF bread to make the crumbs from scratch; I also "sweat" the eggplant as suggested by other reviewers.   Additionally, I made my own spag sauce: dice an onion, sautee w evoo, add crushed tomatoes and herbs, simmer/reduce.   My boyfriend, who is a Cooks Illustrated junkie and has never made a failed dish, was impressed. Win. :) This was delicious! Thanks!

I liked that the eggplant was baked and not fried, however, mine took a lot longer to start to brown than 5 minutes on a side.  Overall it satisfied my desire to make eggplant parmesan, but I didn't think it was anything outstanding.

Turned out really well, even better than the restaurants. I like my eggplant slices well cooked and a little easy on the tomato sauce, not dripping in it. This recipe's a winner!

A very good basic recipe that really needs no adaptation.  We salted and rinsed our eggplant to get rid of some of the bitterness and it was perfect!

This stuff is amazing and SO easy to make. My boyfriend loved it so much that now I've added this recipe to our regular rotation. I buy some extra eggplant and slice it and freeze it so it's even easier to whip up the next time we want it. Requires so few ingredients that it turns out to be a pretty cheap meal too. Love it!

This was as good as any nice italian restaurant! I did follow other reviewer's suggestions and put the eggplant out for about 30 minutes with sea salt to "sweat" it and it really helped to make the eggplant crispy instead of soggy. I followed the recipe exactly other than adding a little extra on the parmesan cheese. I also think the sauce you use is key to good flavor....you have to love it. I used a meat sauce out of the jar called Mid's. Delicious! Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious! I used homemade sauce and this was so good. The only change I made was not peeling the eggplant. I also didn't salt the eggplant before baking it, I like the flavor of eggplant. Oh, and I baked the slices for 10 minutes on each side at 400, then lowered the temp to 350 and baked for an additional 20 or so minutes. Addition: I've tried this several different ways, and it's really good as written, but when I broiled on low for 8 minutes per side and didn't bake with sauce it was much crispier. Just topping with heated sauce was good enough. Baking it really isn't that necessary.

Great!  Used Corn Flake Crumbs instead of bread crumbs (which include partially hydrogenated) and dipped in whisked soy milk instead of eggs.  Very tasty.

Not so good result for me sadly. It might be because I have to use gluten free bread crumbs with Italian seasonings added. Maybe it would have been less bread tasting if I fried the slices. Oh well, if I ever try again it will be with regular Italian bread crumbs not GF.

Have tried this twice and it turned out average both times. The first time was about 3 stars, but quite plain. The second time was about 1.5 stars, still plain even though I added Italian seasoning, oregano, salt and pepper. I think the one eggplant I bought the second time was not quite ripe enough, but even with my modifications, it turned out worse than the first. Consider following other reviewer's suggestion of adding salt and rinsing it to get rid of the bitter taste. I will not be making this again.

Not bad.  I sweated the eggplant like many reviews suggested.  It was still a little bitter but not bad.  All in all this is a decent recipe.  1 eggplant was way more than enough for my family of 4.  I would probably make this again but sweat the eggplant for an hour next time instead of 30 minutes.

This was okay. My husband and I found it rather rich and that the egg planet was rather hard to cut through it ended up being more squashed the crispy. I might try this again and change the cook time to a little less.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe (I don't really like eggplant), but I did take the extra steps of salting and pressing the eggplant.  I'm not sure what the texture would have been like without prepping the eggplant first.

I've only had eggplant parmesan once, and quite enjoyed it. So I thought I'd give this recipe a try and make my own. I followed the recipe exactly, just made a smaller amount with one eggplant instead of three. It was really good!! Next time I'll use a more favourful sauce and maybe cook it for an extra 5 minutes. Overall, a really good & easy recipe that I'll definitely make again.

Followed recipe exactly.  It was good but I wouldn't give it 5 stars.  It did get me to eat my veggies though!  I sweated my eggplant first.

I always have a rough time when it comes to breading things, but the eggplant looked awesome! I went with the recommendations of salting the eggplant for a half an hour before baking and then baking for ten minutes on each side. It was delicious!

Simple, solid recipe. I think three eggplant is more than enough. Usually, I end up using 2 1/2 and have to figure out what to do with the rest.

We LOVE this recipe and it is now my 9 y/o daughter's favorite meal.  I use olive oil cooking spray on the baking sheets and then give a light spray on top of the breaded slices.  We live at high altitude so I end up cooking these at least 15 min. each side, a little bit crispy.  Since there are just 3 of us, I usually use one eggplant, add choppped spinach to the sauce (more vitamins!), and use an 8x8 pan.  IF I have excess eggplant slices, we store them in the fridge and eat as a snack by warming up and dipping in sauce.  THANK YOU for this no-fry recipe!!

This is a family favorite.  I've made this so many times already and keep forgetting to write a review.  My hubby doesn't care for eggplant and would refuse to eat any...until now when one day he tried a bite and went for a full helping and then had seconds...You just have to try this, its easy to make and so good.  I follow the recipe exactly but today I'm adding mushrooms to the spaghetii sauce for variety.

YUM!  Followed the directions exactly!  Next time I will let them cook in the oven for about 5-10 more minutes, as some of the pieces weren't quite cooked through.  Otherwise this is a FANTASTIC recipe.  HIGHLY recommend!

Very delicious, kind of reminded me of a low carb lasagna! I used my bf's awesome, homemade recipe for the spaghetti sauce (which I added sliced mushrooms to). I used a pre-grated Italian cheese mix that had parmesan, romano and other Italian cheeses. Before making I read in some of the reviews that it tasted a bit bland. I'm guessing that is probably due to the kind of spaghetti sauce that they used since that is obviously the main flavor in the recipe. Our eggplant parmesan was far from bland. The one thing that I would probably do next time is to use a peeler to take the skin off the eggplant since the skin made it a bit too chewy for my liking. I would also make sure to cut the eggplant slices thinner.

I was very hesitant to try eggplant, but with this recipe I'm sure I'll be having it again.  This was a delicious dish.  I changed a few things according to other reviews.  I only used one eggplant (medium/large) and it would have fed 6 people, 2 cups of bread crumbs (could have probably used only 1 1/2) and omitted the parmesan cheese (to save calories).  I also did not peel the eggplant (mom always said to eat the skins - there's where the nutrients are) and I ended up having to bake the 1/4" - 1/2" slices about 15 minutes per side.  Some say salting it will help diminish the bitterness, but what I've read is if the eggplant is bitter, then it was overripe. Was a great dish and will definitely be making it again.  Goes great following a side salad!

Very good! I did forget to add the dried basil to the top but it still tasted great...must taste even better with it. DO sweat your eggplant! (salt for 30 minutes, rinse and pat dry).

This recipe converted my husband to eggplant!  I followed the advice to salt the eggplant and to cook it for about ten minutes in the oven, and it turned out perfectly.  I only cooked the finished product for about fifteen minutes--any longer and the cheese would have been black.  This was marvelously easy and quite tasty.

Lots of flavor.  Baking vs. frying was easier, but I did switch it to broil to make the eggplant crispy.  I also added ricotta cheese. It was perfect on a snowy day like today.  My husband loved it, Thanks.

I think there might've been some cook's error in this!  I did a combo of this recipe plus used about 10 people's suggestions, including: sweating the eggplant for 30 mins, rinsing, boiling in water for 2-3 mins (wouldn't do that again - too mushy), baking on parchment paper, baking at 450 for 7 minutes a side, cooking sauce separately and ladling it over the top to keep the slices crisp.  I might try this again sometime.

Yum.  I left the skin on the eggplant, which of course was "chewy" but much quicker to prepare and did nothing but add more fiber to the recipe.  I breaded lightly as I am on the South Beach diet.  Ditto to all below...cooking 10 mins per side is a must.  Grease cookie sheet.  Use plenty of sauce.

I normally LOVE a good eggplant parmesan but this recipe was disappointing. 3 eggplants is WAY too much, I think 1 or 2 at the most would have been better. I thought the taste was rather bland, needed some spicing up. And it definitely needs to be baked longer on each side before putting dish together. 5 minutes on each side did not crisp it at all, it didn't even brown. I suggest leaving it in for 10 minutes per side. I may make this recipe again with some major alterations but it doesn't look promising.

This is one of my favorite recipes! It is easy, and I always have leftovers that I use for a sandwich the next day. Since my boyfriend doesn't like eggplant, I follow these directions exactly, but instead of eggplant, I use chicken breast, and we both have a wonderful meal. I love it, and make it quite often!

everyone in the family LOVED it.  My husband was iffy and asked for the eggplant 'the usual way', which is garlic butter on the grill because he doesn't like parmesan cheese.  After the first bite he was hooked and said I need to make it more often, my 6 and 7 year olds LOVED it too - so easy and so tasty.

I cannot belive my husband actually loved this.  He was convinced he would hate eggplant, but he really enjoyed this and cleaned the plate.  I did extend the baking time just to be safe.  Yummy!

This recipe was wonderful.  My 11 year old son just raved about it and husband said it was delicious.  Made my own sauce and baked the eggplant a bit longer on  each side as other viewers suggested. I also used sliced fresh mozarella. Excellent!

very nice healthier version of an old classic. i followed the reviews and sweated the eggplant w/salt. i agree that 10 mins each side is a more appropriate time to oven fry the eggplant slices. to make this even healthier i left the skin on my eggplant and used a little less cheese. was delicious w/ a side of buttered pasta and an italian salad

This came out amazing. I made one small change rather than place in the often for 5 minutes I used cooking spray and cooked for about a minute on each side then layered. Be light on the cooking spray...

This recipe is very easy and we really enjoyed it. The only thing I would point out is that it's more like 2 cups of bread crumbs and 4 eggs. I only used 2 large eggplants but the egg kept running out. Also by salting my eggplant it kept them firm and took out all the bitter juice that will sit in a larger eggplant while it cooks. But otherwise the recipe was great!

This was a great recipe, really easy and relatively quick.  Salted the eggplant and let the slices sit for about 30 to draw out excess moisture before I breaded and baked.  After I baked the eggplant, I stuck it under the broiler to make it extra crunchy.

This was awesome. My 9 year old walked up as I was about to take it out of the oven and said, "Mom, I don't like eggplant." I told her she didn't know if she liked it our not and she had to try it. She cleaned her plate and asked for seconds. The next day she told me she really liked it a lot and we should have it more often. This recipe is definitely a winner.

My husband was scared about eggplant but after trying this he now asks for it on a regular basis!  This recipe is easy, fast prep, makes great left-overs, and tastes amazing!  I've made it for company and gotten RAVE reviews on it.  Love it!  It is a family favorite :)

I made this for Christmas and I don't know what went wrong, but I didn't particularly care for this recipe. I was cooking quite a bit and maybe I missed something, but I actually hated it.  My dad on the other hand LOVED it, he was the only one - I wanted to throw it away, but he wouldn't allow it, he froze what he couldn't eat and just had some the other day and said it tasted better than on Christmas. For that reason only I gave it 2 stars, but again, he was the only one, no one else cared for it.  I may try it again, but not anytime soon.

Hubby gave it 3 stars, I gave it 5 so here it is a 4 rating.  I baked the slices at 450 after I'd sweated them using Egg Beaters for the eggs and reduced fat cheeses.  I thought it made a great meal but hubby thought it needed some meat and it would be better as a sidedish.

Very good overall. Love that it is baked, not fried. Like many, many other reviewers I had to cook the eggplant much longer on each side than instructed, I did 15 on each. I think I will try a higher temp and lower cooking time next time. Also, I used buttermilk instead of egg for dipping, I think it tastes better, and half-made my own Italian bread crumbs (I used plain and added the spices).

A good recipe and a tasty result. It didn't make the "please make it again right away" cut with the family, however, so that is why 4 instead of 5 stars. Still, every one of the 7 of us had seconds, so it wasn't bad either. Since eggplant is a seasonal veggie anyway, having this once or twice a year is good enough.

Just delicious. I love that it's baked instead of fried. I put a layer of fresh spinach leaves in there too.

I have had the recipe saved for ages and was excited to try it out. It was my first time cooking with eggplant, so I heeded the advice of other reviewers and salted the eggplant for 20 minutes prior to breading and baking. I baked the slices for 15 minutes one each side and another 30 minutes once assembled. The eggplant was not cooked enough (perhaps I sliced it too thick?) and the flavor was really disappointing.  In hindsight, I should have halved the recipe.    I'm giving this recipe 2 stars because I must have done something wrong along the way, clearly 1,000 other reviewers loved it.

Delicious! The prep took forever! NExt time, after slicing the zucchini, I am going to dip them in the egg whites adn shake them in a bag with the bread crumbs. Individually coating each slice with the bread crumbs took way too long. I am glad I baked them though, because it added an extra special flavor.

Yum!! I'm always looking for tasty and filling vegetarian meals... and this is it! I did prepare it a little differently because I was only working with one eggplant. I increased the bake time and temp to 10 min per side at 400. And instead of putting everything together in a baking dish, I just made individual rounds. Kept the eggplant on the baking sheet, topped each with a good amount of sauce, and a slice of fresh mozzarella. Then back in the oven for a few min to melt the cheese. They looked pretty and tasted amazing!!

This tasted pretty good, my only problem is that it took a lot of dishes to bake all that eggplant (I gave up after loading a 9x13 & an 8x8..didn't want to dirty tons of dishes) So I ended up using less eggplant than needed, and it wasn't as filling as it would have been if I could have gotten all the eggplant into it. It tasted great though! So, next time I'll just have to use more pans so I get the full 3 eggplants in there (I used 2)  Also I used Ener-g egg replacer instead of eggs, since I didn't have any. Usually it ends up just fine, but I had to use twice the amount of mix, for less eggplant.

This was fantastic!  My family and friends loved it and have passed the recipe on.  My only other comments:  1.) I only needed 2 eggplant (mine were large and sliced very thin) and were still enough to almost overflow my 9x13 dish. 2.) 2 eggs is misleading - we used 5 eggs.  3.) We only used approx. 3 cups of bread crumbs.  I will make this again and again.  Fantastic!

My mom said this was the best eggplant parm she has ever eaten! I followed the recipe with the exception of sauted kale. I added it more to boost the nutritional value than for taste. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I love the no-fry aspect of this dish.  But the amounts are off (I used 2 eggplants, 4 eggs and 2 c of bread crumbs).  Also -  how thin is "thinly" sliced (I did 1/4" slices) sliced horizontally or vertically?  I like more specifics.  Besides the no-fry I chose this recipe b/c I didn't have to salt the eggplant and let it sit.  However, now I'm sorry I didn't because it turned out tough.   Good idea, but disappointing results.

This recipe took alot of work since I took the advice to "sweat" the eggplant slices and bake them for longer than the recipe calls for however some of the slices came out a little tough. Maybe I just dont know how to pick out eggplant? I enjoyed it but it wasnt my husband's favorite :(

I made the mistake of asking my coworkers if they would like to try some...gone!  I used a olive oil based pasta sauce with a little extra pinch of red pepper, which really gave the overall taste an extra kick.

The proportions in this recipe are a little off (you need more eggs) and you need to cook the eggplant longer.

My vegetarian sis enjoyed this but the others barely ate any. I even took the extra step some suggested and "sweated" the eggplant. Was not very good. I guess we prefer our eggplant parmesan fried!

I made this and it was just okay for me. It was the first time I ever ate eggplant, and I think I just didnt like the eggplant itself. I'm giving it 5 stars because my roommate and her friends loved it, and even asked me to give them the recipe. For me, I just think I'll stick with chicken.

Pretty much the way I make eggplant except I add a slice of provolne before dipping and breading the eggplant. It melts under the breading while it bakes.  try it, it is really good.

This was a very tasty recipe. The only suggestion I would make is to brown the eggplant to your likeness. I like mine crispy so I browned them for 12 minutes on each side and they were a big hit.

Easy, cheap, good!  I didn't have italian seasoned bread crumbs so I made my own w/ some plain + italian seasoning + garlic + parm then I mixed in some panko bread crumbs for extra crunch.  It was super good and made my tiny apartment smell soooooo good.  I hope it made my entire floor hungry!  I used Culinary Circle's Florentine Style Pasta Sauce and it was perfect.  I did not salt the eggplant or whatever others suggested (I don't have time for it and I don't want the extra salt) it came out perfect w/o it since I seasoned the bread crumbs well.  I also chose to keep the skin on and prefer it that way.

Super yummy!  Made the recipe pretty much as is, except I added italian seasonings to the breadcrumbs and added garlic to the sauce.  Were not big eggplant eaters, but grew some in the garden, after this recipe...we are big eggplant eaters:)

I really really loved this dish. I made it with the 'Simple Marinara Sauce' recipe from this site. I also prepared some tofu the same way I prepared the eggplant. I added the tofu as a layer for an extra protein kick, and nobody noticed! They thought the "white stuff" was cheese.  This was simple, classic, and delicious. Will definitely make it again.

I used this recipe the first time I ever made Eggplant.  It was very, very good and I like that it is not fried.

This recipe was very good and easy, but time consuming.  As suggested by other reviewers, I let the eggplant sweat for 25 minutes.  I would def make again.

I wasn't too impressed with the taste and texture of the eggplant. My husband and I were thinking it would be great if the eggplant slices were fried versus baked.

This is a great recipe and not too hard for a beginner cook like me. I did do the salt and soak of the eggplant and used sauce I made instead of the jar stuff. It was my first time cooking eggplant and this was great. Thanks for posting

i made this recipe for my roommates and it was a HUGE hit.  It was super easy to make in our dorm room, plus it was relatively inexpensive and tasted amazing. (not to mention quite a step up from ramen!)

I love eggplant parmesan and was really looking forward to using this delicious recipe.  But the no fry method just doesn't work with eggplant parmesan.  Also, the photo is very deceiving.  Eggplant that is not fried does not look like that photo!  Even the shape of the food doesn't match eggplant, it looks like chicken parm.  They must of used something else in this photo or used the wrong one.

This recipe used a TON of spagehtti sauce!  Otherwise, not too shabby.  The kids ate it and my husband loved it.  I think I'd prefer it fried though.

This was absolutely fantastically delicious! It was the first time my boyfriend had ever tasted eggplant parm, and he adored it. I had wanted to show him what my favorite Italian dish tasted like, since it's unavailable in the Italian restaurants in Israel, and it came out perfect - like an eggplant parm lasagna. I followed it to a T, just decreased the serving size for 2. Served over pasta it is absolutely divine! Thank you for a fab recipe!

Very nice recipe. You do need to bake the eggplant longer than indicated. Take the time to drain the eggplant by sprinkling it with salt, letting it sit for 20 minutes, and then rinsing it before baking. I served it with rigatoni on the side and had plenty of leftovers.  Nice change from meat.

Delightful! I was out of breadcrumbs so I crushed 1 pkg saltine crackers with 1/4c. parmesan cheese and 1 tbsp italian seasoning. I also increased the oven temp to 425 and cooked eggplant for 10 min on each side. This was so good that you could eat them without the sauce or  cheese. Great recipe!!!

Excellent directions for Eggplant Parmesan! I took the suggestion of some other reviewers and "bled" the eggplant for around 20min in some sea salt. I did have to bake the eggplant for 10-15 minutes per side to get it the right color. I prepared a ricotta cheese mix with parmesan, 1 egg and some seasonings and added that to the layers. This turned out very well for me with the aforementioned alterations; I couldn't tell the eggplant wasn't fried!

Loved it! Thank you for posting it! I cooked eggplant slices 15 min each side and added drops of cream cheese to the original layering ingredients. It was easy and tasty! Would absolutely make this again.

I always cut the eggplant the long way, and I happen to like the peel, so I never remove it. Fills the pan better, less work. My kids are MAJOR eaters!! and so sometimes I put sliced meatballs or thinly sliced pancetta on top, along with a generous sprinkling of Parmesan-Reggiano. I like the baking part. Makes it even easier.now, if ONLY I could keep enough (away from them) to get it into the oven! Thanks!

This was a great recipe, easy and delicious!  Per the suggestion of others, I salted the eggplant for about 30 minutes.  I made 1/3 the recipe with some pasta on the side, and it was easily 4 servings.  Will definitely make again.

I was very disappointed with the result of this recipe. I followed it exactly. Three eggplants was way too much. No one cared for it and we ended up just eating the side-dishes.

This smelled great and was interesting to make considering I have NEVER eaten EGGPLANT and probably never will again! The recipe was great except for the eggplant, the consistency of the Veggie just didn't sit right with my taste buds. This seems like a great veggie dish but I would pass it up any day for some good ole MEAT!! sorry kiddos...

This was really easy and delicious. I took some other reviewer's advice and cooked the eggplant for closer to 7 minutes on each side to make them crispier. I also added some oregano to the sauce. I made this for my boyfriend and he went back for seconds. I'll definitely make this again.

This was the very best recipe I have ever gotten from this site. I followed others advise and used only 2 eggplants. I also sweated the eggplant and baked it at 375 for about 10 minutes per side. I used my own homemade Marinara sauce and never measured the cheese (I added more than the recipe called for). It turned out absolutely delicious! It is a little time consuming, but well worth the effort. I'll be making this on a regular basis.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This recipe was ok.  The fact that the dish is baked takes away from the overall taste.  It may help with the fat factor but certainly not with the taste factor.  I think baking is a good option, but I also think you need to add something to help give it a boost.  Perhaps some of the other reviews have some suggestions on additional items that can help this dish.

This is just the best.  Used one large eggplant and fresh basil as I grow it.  Everyone raved about it.  They complained when it was finished.  Will make for the holidays for the rest of the family to try.  I know they will love it also.

I tried "sweating" my eggplant with salt as several reviewers suggested.  In the end, I ended up with a VERY salty dish.  Really disappointed.

This was very good.  I cut the serving size down to 1, so some of my measurements were probably off due to rounding error and estimating.  I was an eggplant virgin, so I'm glad that this recipe was here for a good first experience.  =D

This is a very yummy and easy recipe to make. My mom likes eggplant, but yet she thought this recipe would taste bland, and wouldn't be too good, but she loved it! As did the rest of us. She told me to tell the original poster, thank you for the recipe! This one is a keeper.

My wife's brother-in-law is a vegetarian, so when he came to visit, I decided to give this recipe a shot. It was my first time having/making eggplant, so I was a little nervous. It turned out fantastic and was very easy to make.   Everyone loved it, including a 9,13, and 16 year old who are all very picky eaters.

Delicious!  This was my first ever attempt at eggplant parmesan so I followed others advice, salting the eggplant first and baking it a little longer.  I got compliments on this from my boyfriend at dinner, around 11pm and he requested to have the leftovers for dinner tonight.  This recipe is definitely earned a spot in the recipe box!

Pretty good recipe. However, I had trouble with the eggplant crisping in the oven. I took it out after 7-8 minutes and poured olive oil on the baking sheet and baked it for about 7 minutes each side @ 450. It finally browned up after using the oil. Also, I sweated the eggplant. Even though I rinsed afterwards, apparently there was still a good amount of salt which made the whole dish a bit on the salty side (maybe I used to much salt in the sweating process). I might just lightly pan fry them next time and then stick them in the oven with the sauce and cheese.

I made this for my mother-in-law for her birthday.  It turned out great as was expected, and as the other review stated.  Next time I might lay the Eggplant out and sprinkle with salt to seal in the moisture.  Overall this is exactly what I expect my eggplant parmesan to taste like.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! First time I have made it without having to fry the eggplant - love being able to bake it instead. Used my own homemade marinara sauce from homegrown tomatoes, homemade bread crumbs and fresh mozzarella. Labor intensive this way, but a real treat for special dinners or just to wow the family!

Wonderful!  Sweating the eggplant is a must, and I did two separate layers in the casserole dish (sauce-eggplant-cheese, and repeat) but other than that, this recipe is just right.  I served it over angelhair pasta for a hearty meal and lots of delicious leftovers.

We made this for a vegetarian dinner party this past weekend and it was excellent! Don't forget to sweat the eggplant (I'm sure glad I read the reviews so I knew to do it). We made this for our herbivore and chicken parmesan for our carnivores, and I thought the eggplant parmesan was so good I didn't touch the chicken!

Three eggplants for 9 servings?  What size portions are you figuring?  I used one eggplant and it easily served 5 ppl with leftovers.  Now I have 2 extra eggplants I need to use!  Baking the slices was good idea but didn't taste the greatest.  Just an okay recipe.

I was curious when I read the recipe why it never says to sweat the eggplant. I've never had eggplant before, and can safely say I'm not a fan. Not sure if sweating will help the flavor for me, but the whole meal I was dying for any sort of meat taste. I'd never make it as a vegetarian, and I tip my hat to all of you who live life without meaty goodness.

I gave this three stars because I changed it.  I fried the eggplant in extra virgin olive oil until it was soft before adding it on top of the sauce.

I was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out. I never have much luck with eggplant.  One thing I changed was I did not peel the eggplant.  I figured there are vitamins in the skin and it's just too much trouble.  Obviously, this makes it harder to eat, but it is fine this way too.  I like the baking with breadcrumbs method.  I did not salt or soak the eggplant first, and it wasn't at all bitter.  Made a quick garlicky marinara sauce to go with it, and I'll have great leftovers for days.  Good luck!

I was always intimidated by recipes for eggplant parmesan, until I found this one! The recipe is easy to follow and the results are nothing short of amazing! I took the advice from other reviews... I sweated the eggplant first then baked it on 425 degrees for 12 minutes. Thanks for sharing such a fabulous dish!

I haven't had eggplant since I was a child, so I didn't really remember if I liked it, but I know my parents ate it. My 6 yr old daughter tried one bite, but didn't like it, and I ate it, but I don't think I will make eggplant again. The sauce and cheeses make it o.k. if you are not sure about eggplant. At least I can say that I have made this.

This recipe is definately a keeper, I love that it's baked & not fried.  Took others advice and baked it a little longer to crisp it up, and it turned out great.  No leftovers!

I'm trying to eat healthier and if this is what I have to eat, then it will be no problem. Oh my gosh this is unbelievable. Followed other advice, sweat the eggplant, but then I used Panko Italian seasoned bread crumbs and only egg whites for the egg wash. 450 for 7 mins a side for the eggplant  then 350 for 35 mins on the last part. THANKS!

This recipe turned out perfectly after weighted-sweating the eggplant for 30 min.  I am so excited because none of my eggplant parmisana recipes have ever been edible before.  Both my kids even ate it!  I did have to brown them for 10-15min on each side before adding the sauce.  And I used cornbread stuffing mix (plus some extra garlic powder) instead of breadcrumbs.

I'd never made eggplant parm before and wasn't sure what to expect, but this came out great! I took other reviewers advice and sea salted the slices and 'sweated' them for 20 m (they really do sweat!) then rinsed, dried and proceeded witht the recipe. I baked the breaded slices on a broiler pan so it would crisp up more evenly and I wouldn't have to flip them, baked 20m, and I'm no eggplant expert, but I feel like 10 wouldn't be long enough. I used a romano/parm blend, thinly sliced mozzarella and leftover home-made red sauce. I have to say though, using a low quality sauce could easily ruin this dish, so make your own or buy a good one. I've been trying to make more meat-less meals lately and this makes me not even miss the meat!  Healthy and hearty. I'm going to make this and AR's World Best Lasagna for a big Italian family dinner this weekend.  Thanks!

This was great. We make our on sauce which we got off of this site as well and it all blends very well. Next time I will use more mozzarella cheese though. We love cheese!!!

My dad really liked it, but I wasn't that crazy about it. I could eat it, but didn't enjoy it much. It was my first time trying eggplant and the texture of it is just not for me. The recipe is really good though, I'm just not an eggplant fan :(

This was ok.  I think the eggplant needed to be cooked longer, and we cooked it 10 minutes, and salted it ahead of time.  I thought this dish was kind of bland and very complex, not really worth the time.  Perhaps if the eggplant was cooked differently/more, it would be better, but as is, I thought the eggplant flavor was very dominant.  We debated for a long time about this recipe, and ultimately decided to search out another one or stick with the frozen one from Trader Joe's.

Very good. A nice healthy version. If you wanted to be bad, add more cheese! I did salt/rinse the eggplant before per other recommendations.

The only thing i did different from the recipe was i salted the eggplant and let the water come out, and i baked it for 10 minutes per side.  This turned out great!  Even my wife who wasn't that excited about eggplant said she liked it!  Definetly will have to make again, i think next time i'll experiment and a layer of cottage cheese and spinach like in a lasagne.

It was very tasty.  However, I had never had eggplant before and I don't think I like it but also, I had cut it too thick, (about 1/4 inch thick) and if it were cut thinner, I may have liked it more.  I will try it again with thinner pieces, for sure!

This was my first time making eggplant parmesan and this recipe was great. I had some left-over eggplant and was looking for something to do with it. Instead of using the 9X13 dish, I used a little pyrex bread loaf pan and this was a great portion for my husband and I. Overall the dish was easier to make than I expected and it tasted great!

this was good, i think all of the amount really just depend on your personal taste.  i wish i had added more sauce, maybe more cheese too.  i used more sauce than called for, and i used about double the amount of cheese.  "classico" sauce was really good.

WOW!  Sooooo delicious!  If you like Lasanga (did I spell that right?) then you will love this dish!  I used 2 eggplants instead of 3.  I mixed a large can of spagetti sauce with a small can of chopped tomatoes and added to heaping teaspons of fresh minced garlic to it.  This dish came out simply amazing.  I will make this over and over again!!

This is the first time I have ever made anything with Eggplant myself and it was great! My kids are a challenge when it comes to eating vegetables and they went back for seconds. I only used 2 Eggplants and also followed some of the other reviewers suggestions. I tried salting the slices with sea salt for 30 min before using them then rinsing them off and I baked the slices for 10 min, or more on each side (instead of 5 min on each side). I also realized I only had 8 oz of mozzarella instead of 16 oz so I just used a little extra Parmesan. This is going to be one of the ones we repeat alot. Thanks

Holy smokes! This is soooo incredibly awesome that I ate the entire pan by myself within a week: that hardly ever happens. Since I only cook for myself, I only used 2 eggplants and had PLENTY. I took reviewers advice and sweated the eggplant slices with salt. I didn't have basil on hand, so no topping for me. Also I had plain breadcrumbs and italian seasoning; mix the two = italian breadcrumbs. Lastly, I have a tried and true method of coating food with flour for frying/baking, in this order: first flour, then egg mixture, then flour (or cornmeal or whatever the recipe calls for). Supposedly the coating stays on better with the first dip of flour. I hope this helps somehow.

I salted the eggplant and let them sit on a cooling rack for 30 minutes.  Then I rinsed the eggplant and breaded as the recipe reads.  After reading other reviews, I followed the advice and baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side in a 350 oven.  The dish was excellent.

This recipe should not be called Eggplant Parmesan!  The eggplant was  buried in sauce on the bottom layer and dry and bready at the top. I did sweat the slices, pat dry, bake them for 10 minutes each side. I'll try a different recipe next time, maybe "oven-fry" in a little oil at a higher heat.

Verrry Nice. Just have to play with it a bit. eg. Soak eggplant slices in salted water for around 20 minutes. And make sure you realize this is meant for 9 people. One large eggplant was perfect for me and my girlie. Nice and simple nothing hard at all. perfect for the amateur

Mmmm - delicious! I, like many other reviewers, baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side. I also used a mix of 2 cups breadcrumbs with 2 cups wheat germ to make it more healthy, as well as skim mozzarella, and you would never know the difference!
I also only used two eggplants and then used the remaining breadcrumbs/sauce/eggs to coat two chicken breasts for the Chicken Parmigiano recipe on this site. 
Great recipe!

I basically followed the recipe except that I also salted the eggplant & drained in a colander prior to the baking.  I've tried the fried version and this is lighter and tastier.  I added Italian seasonings in one layer to give it some pizazz!

Very good! The first night we had it it was just okay. (I have a few modifications I'll make next time to make it better for us.) I took the leftovers to work a few days later and to my surprise, it was much improved after sitting in the fridge for a day or two! Loved it. Convinced me to make it again.   My changes: 1. Use seasoned oat flour instead of breadcrumbs to coat the eggplant. (Great if you're on a no-flour diet) 2. Slice eggplant no more than 1/4 - thinner will crisp up even faster. 3. Next time I will try pan-frying the eggplant to get them nice and crispy so they aren't soggy after baking.

Great recipe.  I did brown in a small amount of oil before baking instead of in the oven, but followed the rest of the recipe as is and was very pleased with the results.  Tasted very much like the eggplant that I've eaten in Olive Garden.

Like this cause it is a good basic recipe that you can go off on your own with.Also healthier because of the no-frying.I made it and didn't even bother with the eggs and bread crumbs and went with more a lasagna thing and used up some leftover 90% lean hamburger and zuchinni as a layer also.I also garlicked up the Prego mushroom sauce that I used a lot plus added red wine to it.Served it with rustic garlic bread and red wine.Also think the Portabella mushroom idea that one of the younger reviewers here had as an idea would work great with it too.Think I will be eating more eggplant.

Very tasty, and not at all difficult to make. I really like that you don't fry the eggplant. It could have been cheesier for my taste, but my husband, who thought he didn't like eggplant, liked it, so that's great. Thanks!

I'm not done cooking this yet, but I had just had to share how this turned out. I actually fried the Italian crumb battered eggplant before layering it in the casserole dish. I didn't have enough parmesean or mozarella cheeses to suffice, so I added some Colby..We'll see how that turns out. This I am sure will become one of my favorites!

Like most other people, I initially bake the eggplant for more than suggested- about 10 minutes on each side.  As far as ingredients are concerned, I use 1 Eggplant, 1 26oz can of sauce, and a bit less than a bag of shredded mozzarella.  I also substitute egg beaters for eggs. I like to throw some pasta on the stove while cooking and serve the Eggplant over a bed of pasta.  It all also tastes great heated as leftovers.

Loved it! Baking instead of frying/sauteing the pieces was a great idea--talk about cutting down on the calories. This was my first time preparing eggplant & it wasn't bad at all. Some alterations: Before dipping the slices in the beaten egg I sprinkled the slices with a bit of salt & let them sit for 45 min. I then washed & patted them dry. Also used a homemade spaghetti sauce. Will make this recipe again using zucchini instead of eggplant.

I am impressed.  My husband who hates eggplant really liked this.  I added extra cheese and put the extra breading on top before I baked it with the sauce.  I only had 3 cups of sauce and I wish I'd had more! For myself and my little girl, we would have liked more heft to our eggplant slices.  I didn't know how much they would shrink and by the time they were done there just wasn't much to them.  But I may use this recipes again to try to trick the hubby into liking eggplant.  Hey it worked for broccoli and spinach and we're well on the way for green beans...

Yummy! The food tastes good. I hope that in the future we could have some clarification on how thick to slice the eggplant. I sliced mine in 1/2 inch pieces, then realized that they wouldn't cook intime so I then resliced the pieces into 1/4 slices. I don't think we sliced them thin enough still, was a little chewy in some spots. Thankyou for the recipe though, It was good.

This was awesome. I totally left the skin on. It was fine, also I didn't sweat it. No problem there. Also instead of crumbs I used Trader Joes "Just Almond Meal". WOW very good. I also added a layer of spinich. Super easy to make and tasty!!!! Thanks

My rating includes the advice I followed in the other reviews (salting then rinsing the eggplant slices, and cooking them alone first). I served the eggplant with nests of angel hair pasta and white wine mushrooms and followed the meal with creme caramel. The whole thing was impressive, delicious, and not that difficult.

Fabulous!!  My 3 year old and 1 year old couldn't get enough.  We bought 2 eggplants every week at the farmer's market and made this dish.

The most tasty and healthy recipe for egg plant parm! I usually fried with olive oil first. (no saturated fat sure.....but fat non the less and HUGE calories in Olive Oil.) Omit the yolks and use the whites of the eggs only like another reviewer said and splurge your calories and cholesterol on the Cheese.

My wife and I loved this recipe. I did sweat the eggplant with kosher salt and then rinsed. I sliced the eggplant thin and we used our favorite pasta sauce. The result was fantastic. Eggplant Parmesan is one of our favorite dishes from Luigi's restaurant nearby, and we both felt this recipe rivaled theirs. I also love the fact you don't need to fry the eggplant. Thanks for this great recipe.

This is a great recipe! My eggplant was vey tender, so I followed the recipe exactly.  I used only one eggplant because I was making it for only 2 and it was a good size. I was amazed it had such flavor and texture because it was baked. Came out great. This recipe is a keeper!  Thank you so very much!

Fabulous!!  My whole family loved its taste (even my four year old) and I love it because you dont fry you bake the eggplant.  I used homemade sauce, and used freshly grated parm cheese.  Absolutely amazing and I will make this again for sure.  :)

This was WONDERFUL!  I scaled it back, using 1 large eggplant, 1 jar of sauce - but added more cheese. Still filled a 9X13 pan.  I peeled and VERY thinly sliced the eggplant (1/8") and soaked in cold and salted water. Drained and let sit in the fridge overnight.  DH coated the Egglant in egg whites and self-made seasoned breadcrumbs (garlic powder, salt, pepper, parmesan, breadcrumb)using the baggie method (threw the slices in the egg white baggie then dumped the whole thing in the breadcrumb baggie and shook) baked on EVOO brushed on parchment lined sheet and assembled. Baked for 30 min. covered with tinfoil, then broiled for 5 min.  Served with garlic bread baked in breadmaker through the day and spaghetti noodles.  Thanks!

I would give the recipe five stars...but this e-parm takes a bit of work.  You have to sweat the eggplant with sea salt after peeling/slicing for 20-30 minutes.  Rinse very well.  Then, pat DRY.  I used about 1 and 1/2 jars of sauce.  Definitely bake the slices TEN minutes on each side before putting the dish together.  I used grated Parm and Romano.  This recipe is sooo good when done.  Definitely a keeper :)

Very good!!!!  I made the mistake of cutting the eggplant to thin and then baking for 10 minutes which was too long. The slices were too crispy and took away from the flavor of the eggplant.  I salted the slices with sea salt before dipping into the egg and bread crumbs.  I didn't have italian bread crumbs so mixed in some Italian seasoning in to regular bread crumbs.  Will make this again!

Delicious!  Way better than the eggplant parmesan at a local Italian restaurant.  We had enough eggplant that we made a 9x13 pan plus an 11x7 pan. Baked it about 7-8 min per side. Had 1 good sized eggplant and it made a 15 in pan with 1 and a half layers. We sliced it about 1/4 inch thick. Served it with a salad and garlic bread and everyone enjoyed it!

This was pretty good, doesn't match La Vinga's, but its good. One thing I would certainly do is cut the eggplant thinly, 1/8 inch. it soaks up the flavor a lot better. and also bake them so they are crispy on the outside.

This was pretty good. I have not had eggplant parmesan before, so I don't have anything to compare this too. But my boyfriend has and he really liked it. Not sure it is something that I am going to crave though.

This came out delicious!  We actually used this recipe as a guide consider we were cooking the whole thing on the grill and the side burner.  Since we didn't have a broiler we omitted the parmesan.

This was good. I think I did the eggplant slices too thin, they really fell apart when browning them. I just threw some pasta in to serve and it turned out good.  Next day we ate without pasta and it tasted good on its own.

This is the first time I've made eggplant parmesan, a dish I've only ever eaten at my Italian in-laws' house.  I've never liked it, but since my neighbor gave me a few eggplant I felt like I should do something with them.

After slaving away coating and baking tray after tray of eggplant (my slices were very small, having come from rather skinny eggplants), I was ready to pitch the whole idea and order pizza.  However, once dinner was on the table I changed my mind.  WOW!  This was soooo good!  All this time I thought I didn't like eggplant parmesan!  Baking the eggplant cut back so much on the "grease" factor, and the eggplant sliced retained some of their crispness after baking.  I did slice them quite thin, which my husband prefers.  Even my in-laws were very complimentary of this dish!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, only adding Italian seasonings and fresh ground black pepper to the breadcrumbs.  It also took 4 eggs to coat the eggplant, not two.  Baked the eggplant slices for ten minutes per side, as others suggested.  For the sauce, I used home-made tomato sauce from my garden.  The recipe is Homemade Tomato Sauce I here on allrecipes.  The result was fantastic, and I'll be making this again!  Great recipe!

This is so awesome! I do salt the eggplant and drain in a colander for about an hour before breading and frying and add a little lemon juice to the eggs(just some advice I was given). Comes out perfect every time!

This recipe is a keeper, no more frying Eggplant for me.  Its so nice not having oil dripping all over when you eat it.  It was delicious.  I did use more eggs and baked it about 7 minutes on each side but its a great recipe.

So awesome! I too let the eggplant sweat with sea salt for about a half  hour. Never cooked with eggplant before and after reading the reviews I figured I better do it! I patted each piece dry with papertowel. I followed instructions completely. This dish was so great! I served with a piece of Texas toast. Leftovers were even better because the cheese got all crunchy. YUMMY!!!

LOVED IT!  My husband and I never tried eggplant until this recipie.  Since I have made this, I have ordered eggplant at resturants and it is not nearly as good.  Thanks so much, this will be a staple for me!

I have made this several times and always get rave reviews.  Even my mother in law who always finds something to complain about complimented this dish.  The key is to use a good quality spaghetti sauce.  I use Rao's brand which is pricey  but worth every penny.

If you're in a hurry , you can saute the slices in olive oil flavored cooking spray  (or regular , for that matter.)

This was very good..my husband could not stop eating it. The only thing I did different was to layer the eggplant like lasagna. My kids even liked it and called it a pizza casserol.

This recipe was delicious! And so much healthier then the fried version. I salted the eggplant first and let it sit for 30 minutes. Then dipped the slices in egg beaters, coated them in italian bread crumbs and baked them for 10 minutes each side. And just followed the rest of the recipe as it says. I can't wait to make it again. Next time I may add some zucchini or spinach. Thanks!

Just for me, so only used one eggplant; followed the suggestion to parboil for 1-2 minutes and cool and dry fully. Only needed one egg and about 10 minutes per side at 375.

This was super yummy, even right out of the oven after just baking the breaded eggplant.  It is a bit time-consuming, but the steps are easy.  My only complaint was that I followed some other suggestions and salted the eggplant before breading it, and although I rinsed it, it still tasted too salty to me in the finished product.  Other than that, it was delicious and my two year old couldn't get enough.  Will definitely make this again.

The dish needed more cook time; I followed most of the common comments, except I didn't leave it in as long as they suggested. My mistake. I'll try that next time. All told, though, the flavor was nice (bottled sauce nothwithstanding).

I have never made eggplant parmesan but have enjoyed it at restaurant. I followed the directions to the "t." It lacks flavor.  I think there was too much tomato sauce. It was soggy even after cooking the eggplant for about 20 minutes on each side.

I made this a few nights ago, and I loved it. The recipe called for pretty much twice as much bread crumbs as were really necessary, and the three large eggplants I sliced were WAY too much - next time I will use maybe one large and one smaller one. Other than that, this recipe was perfect and easy to make.

REALLY GOOD!  I was planning on making this plus a non-veggie meal but when he got a whiff of this he decided he would go veggie for the night.  We both loved it!  I was in a hurry so I didn't sweat the eggplant as others described.  It turned out fine.  Baked the eggplant for 10 min each side.  Only used 1 eggplant in a 9x9 dish.  Was enough for 4 layers.  Served on angel hair it was enough for the two of us plus some leftovers.

This is great! I did salt the eggplant first, which may or may not have made a difference. I also found that the baking stage took much longer -- like, twice as long, probably. However, all done, it was a great meal over spagettini.

Truly Amazing!  This recipe is a keeper.  Better than any restaurant...and it was made right at home.  I let it "sweat" as other posters have mentioned and I cooked the coated eggplant slices for 10 minutes each side. Thank you!

I just finished cooking this recipe. I chose it based upon the other member's reviews. It was super easy and very, very good. This is my first time cooking eggplant parmesan and I will definitely commit this recipe to my cookbook. I only used 2 eggplant and it was more than enough and I had to use 3 eggs when coating. No biggies...it was great! I want to try adding spinach next time.

Great Recipe!!  I will use this again and again.  No substitutions just made as directed.  A little time consuming to slice and bread the eggplant so give yourself a little time.  My husband loved this!

I've never had Eggplant Parmesan before but had heard that it makes for a tasty meal.

This recipe is excellent.  I combined the information given by the writer and tips from the reviewers to make a wonderful meal.  My husband, who doesn't even like Eggplant, was pleasantly surpised!

Worth the little extra time and effort for sure!

It's a very good recipe.  Only thing was my husband needs a protein source in every meal. To remedy that i prepped some chicken breast strips with egg wash and  bread crumbs, then cooked them in some evoo, and added them to the baking dish with the eggplant.

This is an AWESOME dish.  I first made it when I was still living at home, in high school.  My meat and potatoes parents loved it!  When I lived in a "dorm" I made it for a bunch of the people and staff there.  Everyone loved it!!! I do recommend soaking the eggplant slices in salt-water.  It'll get some of the bitter seeds out.  It's hard to find good eggplant in Nebraska so it's a treat when the garden is done.

AWESOME!!  Hubby had never had eggplant before - he now loves it!  Leftovers were just as good.  I sweated the slices as suggested, browned them in the oven 8 minutes, used 1 large and 1 small eggplant and one 24 oz jar spaghetti sauce, the rest of the recipe as is.  Perfect!

Good, but not great.  Maybe I didn't cut the eggplant thin enough. Seemed that it needed to cook longer to get the eggplant a little softer.  I'll try again. Easy enough though.

This was a wonderful treat and I appreciated the extra instructions.  I made this as a Passover dish by replacing the bread crumbs with Matzo Meal.  I also added a matzo on the bottom ( dipped in milk and egg) and on the top.  Yummy!!!

This is an excellent tasting and very simple dish to make when you are short on time!! My husband is not really into eggplant so I tried it with about 5 chicken breasts cut in half. I pre-baked them for about 15-20 minutes and then prepared it just like the recipe says and it turned out GREAT!! I'll definitely be making this again!

My husband and I have never had eggplant, so we were not sure what to expect.  Since my husband is allergic to chicken, I decided to try this as an alternative to chicken parmesan.  I'm glad I did, this was wonderful!  I did follow others tips and let the eggplant sweat for about a half an hour, and baked them about 10 minutes on each side.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  We will have this again, and often!  Thank you for the post!

This recipe was awesome. I made it for two people so I modified it. I used alot of onions and some garlic too. I used one eggplant and toasted the sliced pieces with mozzarella cheese.

This is my first time making eggplant parmesan. This had a nice flavor but was way too cheesy for me and my family. I will make again but use half the amount of mozzarella. Just a personal preference.

My first time cooking eggplant and it was a hit with the family ( I have a son with autism who is an extremely picky eater). Per the recommendations I salted the eggplant, used italian breadcrumbs with Parmesan cheese for the breading and baked the slices at 450 for 7 to 10 mins each side.

This was our first time ever EATing eggplant, let alone cooking it.  This recipe was very easy and super tasty.  I also sliced the eggplant pretty thin, and cut down on the cheese a bit just for personal preference.  Reduced the servings to 4 and still had lots of leftovers. Served with a little whole wheat spaghetti.

WOW! So simple and delicious. Following the review by NDG42200, I used 1 large eggplant (= 30 1/4 inch slices) and started by sweating the slices. I breaded and then baked them at 350 for 10 minutes on each side (perfect!). I then followed the recipe, deviating only in that I added 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp onion powder, and 1 tsp garlic powder to 2 bottles of store bought spaghetti sauces to add a bit more flavor. Baked 35 minutes. WOW! It bears repeating so I'll say it again: WOW!

i really liked this baked eggplant parm recipe. since i'm only cooking for two, i also reduced the amount of eggplant to two small/medium. i cooked the eggplant for about 7 minutes on each side at 450 as suggested by other reviews. this worked out nicely. next time i will try salting the eggplant slices prior to baking to see if i can improve on the texture.

Awesome!!! Better than any restaurants. I used shredded parmesean and mozerella. I only had regular bread crumbs so i added italian seasonings(ex. parsely, oregano,garlic,basil etc.). I followed other reviewers sweating technique and preheated the oven at 450 degrees. I used Delmonte's canned spaghetti sauce with Green peppers and Mushrooms. I accompanied this dish with whole wheat fettucine.
 This will become a regular meal for me.

DELICIOUS! I didn't change a thing, except that I added 3/4c. reduced-fat feta cheese in between two of the layers of eggplant. Also, I found that since I used fresh eggplant with firm skin and flesh, I didn't have a problem with bitterness at all. Thanks for the post!

I've made this twice now and love it.  My kids think they are eating meat when really it's a veggie (or fruit)not sure which one.  I like to serve over a bed of whole wheat noddles so it is sort of like spagetti, but better.

I have to say this is an awesome, easy recipe! I usually salt & sit any squash that I cook, but this time I was under the gun & didn't do it & it still turned out great. I used one large eggplant & made my own sauce(super easy too). I didn't have any bread crumbs so I put a pkg of whole grain Bistro crackers in the food proccessor w/ some italian seasonings & you would not believe how awesome it was! I won't use bread crumbs next time either, plus this is healthier. Amazing!

I followed the recipe to a T except I added a little aged parmesan and had to use a bag of dried italian crouton's that I crushed. It turned out excellent. I will definately make this time and time again.

Great dish! They were just as good as the original! I used egg whites instead of whole eggs, just to make it that much healthier. They turned out beautiful! Definitely make this over and over.

Hubby loved this so much, he's making it for ME tonight! I only used one egg yolk (and the rest whites), and one eggplant (there's only two of us), but other than that, followed to a T. Really great.

This recipe turned out great!  I prepared this for the first time and my 4 yr old, 9 yr old, and boyfriend loved it.  We have never eaten eggplant before but I definitely plan on making this again.  I sprinkled salt on the eggplant first and let it sit for about 15 minutes before rinsing and drying them.  then I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the outcome!!!

DELISIOSO!!! My husband said that his Italian friend would absolutely love this, and he is a very picky Italian conoseur. Absolutely the best eggplant parmesan I have ever made (I have tried quite a few recipes). However, 2 eggs were barely enough for the amount of eggplant (used 2 medium). I will definitely keep this recipe. Fantastico!!

This smelled AMAZING as I was making it - but was not the awesome dish I was imagining after reading all the great reviews.  We all thought it was "just ok".

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  My girlfriend has been telling me to try this for awhile and I kept putting it off until eggplant went on sale.  Well today was the day and boy oh boy.  I should have tried it a long time ago.  I made two large pan fulls of it and both are gone within 1 hour of coming out of the oven.  Taken by my daughter and boyfriend. Its much much better then expected and I won't be waiting for it to go on sale anymore.  Its a staple on our monthly menu.  Thx for the great recipe. Please try it, you won't be sorry.

This is such an easy recipe and so incredibly good.  My roommate constantly asks me to make this and he rarely shows a preference in my cooking.  I did bake the eggplant 10 mins on each side and sweated it before breading so that it was firmer.  The recipe makes enough to feed us for three meals, but it never sits in the fridge for more than a few days.

This recipes is amazing. I salted the eggplant for about 30 mins prior to dipping it in the egg. I also followed the other reviewers suggestions and cooked each side for about 7 mins. I cooked whole wheat penne pasta with sauce and served it with the eggplant. I will definitely make this again!!!

This was awesome!  It was so wasy and yummy and guilt free.  I read a few reviews and figured I should sweat the slices.  I don't have sea salt so I just used regular table salt -- I don't know if that was "right" but I rinsed and dried them off and everything turned out fine.  I didn't bake them after getting them crispy, I just had them on the side with angel hair pasta covered with sauce and some cheese, turned out wonderful!

This was very easy and VERY delicious.  I baked my egglplant on a pan lightly drizzled with my homemade basil oil. We served it with pasta, bread and a mixed greens salad.  It was great and my guests LOVED IT.

Was a hit, even with my 2 year old!  Wasn't bitter even though didn't salt or press the eggplant.  Really liked that it was baked and not fried in oil, like many other recipes.

Terrific!  We ate it as sandwiches on toasted whole grain french bread.  I used far less cheese than what was called for-just to keep it lighter. Wonderful recipe.

This was good, but an awful lot of work if you take suggestions and sweat the eggplant. Good taste, but we didn't eat till after 7pm.

My husband freaked when I said we were having an all veggie dinner! 
Boy, was he pleasantly surprised.
My addition was fresh spinach layers under the sauce.  Delish!  
Thanks for a great recipe!!

My mom makes THE best eggplant parm ever...so I can't rate this a 5.  But it WAS really good.  My husband loved it - and he is Mr. If-there's-no-meat-I-don't-eat.  :)  I would suggest a slightly longer cooking time though when baking the eggplant.  Some did not quite get cooked all the way through.  I thought they would cook more once the whole dish was in the oven, but only the ones closer to the bottom did.  So the top ones were a little crunchy, but were fine the next day when I microwaved leftovers.

Oh how my husnand loves this meal!!  He would eat it every night if he could.  I usually salt the eggplant for about 20 minutes before breading and baking.  It will sweat out some moisture so just brush off the salt and collected fluid before proceeding.  Also, I have used the italian breadcrumbs and am wondering if panko might be better.  We tend to keep the jars of tomato sauce around and I prefer to eat this dish with the more basic marinara sauces vs the more flavored ones (mushrooms, spicy, cheesy, etc) - I think it takes away from the good eggplant flavor.  Pair it with a salad and you have a great meal.

An All-Star Recipe! The eggplant was crisp, tasty, easy and healthful. 

I made my own breadcrumbs with day-old ciabatta, by pulsing it in my food processor, roasting them in a dry frying pan, adding oregano at the end. At the same time, I pulsed one clove of garlic then added the bread crumbs and pulsed for a few more seconds. The crumbs were of various sizes and provided extra texture to the coating. Next time, I would consider adding grated parmesan to the breadcrumb mixture.

I cooked the 1/2 inch sliced eggplant for 10-min a side at 450 and was thoroughly pleased with the crispy texture. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I have to be honest, I didn't really look at many of the measurements on this recipe, because I only had one eggplant. Instead, I just used the one eggplant and added the rest of the ingredients according to what looked right. Tasted pretty good!

I love Eggplant Parmesan but cheated a little because instead of breading the eggplant I just brushed olive oil on both sides of the 1/2" slices and baked for 10 mins/side.  I also used Bryan's Sweet & Hot Pasta Sauce from this site instead of jarred sauce.  Saved some calories by not breading and I was satisfied with the results.  Oh...I also peeled the eggplant.  I think the peel can be a little bitter and I don't care for the texture of it anyway.

Turned out well but the pasta sauce used was way too salty. Need to make it again with a different sauce. The eggplant was crispy and yummy though.

Pretty good!  I had to tweak it a bit to make it a little bit healthier.  If you are going to skip the frying part might as well be extra good!  I only put mozarella on the top layer (about 6 oz)

I also 'sweated' the eggplant.  I will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the eggplant was not cooked through, otherwise it was tasty. I think it was missing something without ricotta cheese so I will probably add some next time and use fresh mozz combined with shredded. Even though the eggplant wasn't totally cooked, it still tasted great and I'll make it again but bake longer!

If I have time I always try to cook mostly from scratch. This recipe is sensational with a another recipe found for homemade Italian breadcrumb, just for ref (4 cups plain breadcrumbs (make your own) 1 teaspoon parsley flakes (crushed), 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon onion powder , 1 teaspoon sugar, ½ teaspoon oregano or Italian seasoning, crushed ½ teaspoon pepper 1teaspoon salt, freeze left over for later). With some homemade spaghetti sauce, sautéed in garlic. This dish is healthy and delicious.  My boyfriends mouth was watering before it came out of the oven!

This was good for being baked, but it just wasn't what I really wanted...a fried version. At least with this I could eat it without feeling guilty.

Hey, this is pretty good. It's definitely not low-fat. I think I'll convert this into an entirely different animal, since I, too, found myself tossing down the toasted eggplant coins before saucing and cheesing them up. Keep the pasta sauce in a bowl on the side and dip the coins as movie food instead of popcorn. Yum!

This was pretty good! I had never tried making eggplant before and it turned out well after baking 10 minutes on both sides. Not something I'd make again, just because it didn't "wow" me, but it's fun trying new things!

Very good.  Fried eggplant is better in this recipe but baked was pretty good too... so why not save the calories and fat?  I would recommend it.

I thought it was good, not great, but good. My husband enjoyed this more than I did. He has actually ordered this in restaurants before and said it was very comparable!

As a novice, this took me almost 3 hours total. That included salting the eggplant as recommended by other reviewers. I will try this again without salting and without as much mozarella.

I made fresh bread crumbs with garlic and onion powder which made the crust extremely fresh and delicious.  My teenage daughter and I enjoyed cooking this one together and she likes lots of sauce.  We plan to make it again for her birthday.

great/quick recipe...i've seen suggestions for salting the eggplants which is a good tip, if you don't want to take this extra step i suggest getting smaller eggplants, they usually have less seeds and are less bitter letting you forgo the salting process

My first time ever cooking with eggplant was a moderate sucess: I sweated the eggplant as sugested, doubled coated it with bread crumbs and parmesean, and baked for longer before putting it in casserole. My guests liked it, but it was salty, probably my fault for not washing the eggplant well enough after sweating.

Not a huge fan.  My 4 year old wouldn't touch it.  The texture wasn't what I was in the mood for.  The bottom layer didn't get cooked enough either.

This was fabulous! Four stars only because I found the proportions off, taste was a five or more!! I used 2 eggplants, one 26 oz jar of sauce and a 12 oz bag of mozz. cheese.

It was alright for what it was (frankly, this was the first time I had eggplant and I just don't think that I like it). My husband said it was the best eggplant dish he had ever had--he loved it! He said that eggplant never stays so firm as it did in this dish. So, I guess if you like eggplant, then this is a good dish for you.

WOW this was excellent!  I've tried eggplant parmesan in the past and it never turns out well.  This was AMAZING.  My twin 2 year olds even said, "It's yummy mommy!" and scarfed it right up!  As the previous reviewer said, the cooked eggplant itself was delicious before re-baking it!  I will definitely be making this dish again!

i tried this today hoping it'd be good since all the reviews were so good but it ended up tasting like soggy bread. the bread crumbs soaked up way too much of the pasta sauce. overall it just tasted bad.

We've made this recipe twice, the first time we cooked the eggplant forever and it never cooked all the way through.  I think you have to bake the eggplant for 10 to 15 minutes per side before putting in the dish.  The second time it turned out great except the cheese was a little too brown.  Hopefully the third time is the charm.

I will probably make this one again if I am in the mood for eggplant. I prefer the vegetarian moussaka that can be found on this site as well and also uses eggplant however this recipe is simpler than the mossaka. I followed other users instructions and removed the excess water with salt and baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side.  I also added feta cheese.  I think that I will add spinach next time as I have seen this in another recipe and I think that it would be good.

I was extreamly pleased with the results of this recipe as I recently tried it for the first time. Considering how much healthier it is than traditional eggplant parmesan recipes it tastes great.I used Progresso Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, more than 2 eggs and a pasta seasoning blend blend instead of straight basil; everything else I followed the recipe on. This is a good one.

I usually love eggplant parmesan but this didn't trun out quite like I had hoped. It was almost too rich maybe, it's hard to put my finger on exactly what was off. I don't think i'll be trying this recipe again.

We loved it. First time preparing eggplant and this recipe was easy and yummy. The only thing I would suggest is adding some ricotta cheese...absolute perfection. Thank you so much

This was really good. The only real issue I had was that the eggplant turned out kind of rubbery; maybe next time I will prepare it differently as was recommended by other reviewers.  I still really enjoyed this recipe though and the leftovers tasted wonderful the next day!

Maybe its because I've never tried eggplant before, and in this recipe I thought it was icky, but I really didn't like it.  We ended up fishing the eggplant out and throwing it away, and using the sauce for noodles the next day.

I LOVED this recipe!!! The best eggplant dish I have ever had... normally not a very big van of eggplant that isn't coated in breadcrumbs and crackers and fried but this was outstanding! My husband LOVED it as well!! We will definitely be making this all the time!!

Excellent - and the recipe was perfect with the addition of using the other reviewers suggestions of salting and sweating the eggplant and cooking it for 10 minutes on each side.  This only served 6 in our family.

Thanks so much for this easy recipe! I had a large eggplant that needed to be used, so I found this recipe. I ran out of bread crumbs, so I used finely crushed corn flakes, which worked just as well. I also chopped up some fresh basil, which tasted great. I actually needed to cook mine for more than 10 minutes on each side, but oh well.  I've never been a real eggplant fan, but this was pretty yummy!

Ended up throwing more then half the dish out. My husband even requested that I don't make it again.  That's a first! He's never had eggplant before, so maybe that had a part in it???  I thought it was okay the first night.  I didn't like it at all the second day.

Thank you Dolores!  Finally a healthy eggplant parmesan recipe that tastes great!  Per another reviewer, I baked the eggplant an additional 5 minutes on each side.  Served with a side of whole grain thin spaghetti.  Yum.

I decided to try this version as I am trying to lose weight.  My eggplant slices didn't brown in the oven at all, so I ended up lightly cooking them in olive oil in the frying pan.  So much for omitting the frying method.  I used my own homemade tomato sauce and 2% cheese.  The end result was very good, but not the light recipe I was hoping for.

this was pretty time consuming and in the end it didn't taste that good.  I salted, sweated, and rinsed the eggplant, baked 10 minutes each side, and used really good spaghetti sauce but we didn't like it and ended up eating something else for dinner.

I'd give this dish a better rating, but my fiance didn't really care for it. He's not terribly fond of eggplant. Our vegetarian roommate and I enjoyed it very much. It was a chore to get the crumbs to stick on the eggplant, but overall not too hard.

This recipe was good a bit time consuming though.  I did sweat the eggplant between paper towels as suggested and baked the eggplant about ten minutes each side. Although tasty it takes as much time as if you were to fry the eggplant which is the way I think I prefer it.

Made this for my daughter and her family. Makes a LOT. I used extra cheeses and sauce. The eggplant holds up better than when fried and had more "tooth" to it than I like, but very tasty. Was certainly a lot lower in calories and fat.

I only used two average sized eggplant and I ended up using 2 big jars of sauce to make this recipe work.  Not very good in my opinion.  Try Eggplant Parmesan I from this site.

Reduced the sauce. My eggplant did take longer to cook as well. This was good but I don't think I would make it again considering how time consuming it was. Good though. Added a few extra Italian seasonings.

I have never made eggplant parmesan and my friends reported how difficult it was to make.  This recipe is easy and delicious.  My husband loved it.  It is a bit time consuming.  I "sweated" the eggplant between papertowels like another review had suggested.  I used 3 baby eggplants and had more than I needed.  It turned out wonderful.

I hate to say it, but I'm with Sandi.  Although I brushed the eggplant pieces with a little olive oil before I placing them in the oven, the entire dish turned out extremely dry.  It definitely needs a little more moisture if you are planning on baking your eggplant pieces twice.  Possibly use a slightly thin spaghetti sauce to accommodate?  I think I will stick with frying my eggplant, and just *try* to eat it less often.

Tastes great; this caused my guy friend to become my boyfriend!  Later, my roomate made it with extra sharp white chedder instead of parmesan and that was really delicious too.

This was delicious!  A big hit, even with my husband and son, who up until now did not like egg plant.  I only used 2 eggplants and it was still too much.

Really tasty recipe.  The eggplant was not as tender as I would have liked it.  Next time I will try frying instead of baking the eggplant prior to layering.  Put in a layer of ground chuck and turned out great.  A meal-in- one.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely WONDERFUL!  I made it exactly like the recipe and it was great.  My 2 year old ATE IT UP.  I will note, I had plenty of eggplant leftover though, so I had a ton of leftovers... and I didn't use 3 eggplants.

I did this recipe but when I baked the eggplant it didn't really seem like it cooked, so I fried them in a little bit of olive oil and they were perfect!

Eggplant came out slightly soggy but had a delicious flavour.  I would definitely make again, cooking the eggplant for longer.

I don't know if I will make this again, the taste was okay but the texture was really bad.  I think it would taste better if a homemade sauce was used instead of jar. Also, baking the eggplant slices for longer is a must.

This was really good and I will make it again.  Perhaps next time I will cook longer than the alotted time as it was a little firm.  Leftovers would make a great sandwich- if there were any!

Okay, but not fantastic.  I'm not sure why, but I didn't like the overall 'feel' and texture of this dish.  Not sure, but it might have been the consistency of the tomato sauce I used.

Easy and tasty!  I followed the directions almost exactly, although I did adjust some of the amounts for two people.  I followed some of the advice here and put salt on both sides of the eggplant slices.  I rinsed after I had prepared everything.

I used jarred sauce...Ragu's Chopped Tomato, Garlic, and Olive Oil.  It was a perfect choice.

I think the slices need to be thinner than I made them, as eggplant parm is usually softer than mine came out.  However, it was great for my first attempt and I will make this easy recipe again.

Thank you for sharing!

This is now a regular in my household. My 2yo eats it up (of course he thinks the eggplant is sasuage) and DH who hates the idea of no meat has seconds. I like to add a can or two of tomato sauce to make it more 'saucey' for pasta. I don't like to peel eggplant so I find baking then frying to be the best method to prepare it.

I found this recipe really simple to make but extremely heavy- I could hardly chew and swallow!  I am cooking for one person, so I saved some of the breaded, baked eggplant to make a second dish fresh the next day, and found the breaded eggplant slices to be a nice snack straight from the fridge, free from the heavy burden of cheese and tomato sauce!

My first time using eggplant. I have tasted Eggplant Parmesan before, so I had an idea about what taste I was aiming for. I served it over spaghetti noodles. This dish was not a hit with my guests and I really think it was b/c the eggplant needed to be baked longer prior to adding it to the dish and maybe even longer in the oven. I plan on making this dish again in the future and cooking it longer. I really think it will make a huge difference ,as the texture of the eggplant was still too firm in my dish.

I agree with many other reviews- eggplant needed to cook a bit longer and too much sauce.  Besides that it was very good.

I changed the recipe around to lower the calories.  It turned out nice and healthy.  I left out a lot of the cheese and used all fresh veggies and homemade sauce.

I am 100% certian that I made this dish correctly, it looked perfect, and had good consistancy. but my family and I just didn't like it. Maybe we just don't like eggplant. also it took longer than the estimated time.  oh well.

It was okay, but I have a few changes that I think would make it better. Firstly, more mozzerella... the parmesan doesn't need to be as much, you can still taste it. Also, I would bake the eggplant slices for longer if I make this again, they were sort of hard. Although the recipe says peel the eggplants, I only peeled two and left the thrid unpeeled and it was great. Also, it took me almost two hours to prepare it, much longer than the original recipe states. Although I may never make it again, it was pretty good. Overall, just kind of so-so.

I thought this was too saucy, it overpowered the eggplant.  Also the eggplant was still a little too hard, would suggest baking it for 10 minutes on each side before layering it with the other ingredients.

Just had this for lunch and it was difficult to have only one portion!

I thought I had more Parmesan in the fridge than I actually did so I mixed what I had with some cheddar and it worked just as well.


I used 2 jars of Classico Tomato-Basil sauce which I use for my lasagne and other similar dishes. 

I chose to try this recipe because I could sidestep the frying and spattering and all that extra oil that is usually needed.  No mess - wonderful!

This is the way I am going to make Eggplant Parmesan from now on.  I still get the breading that I love but I can skip all the fat!

My husband had never eaten eggplant before, so I made this for him. I really liked it. It was easy to prepare, and tasted very good! I sliced the eggplant fairly thin and baked the slices for 10 minutes on each side, as some reviewers suggested, so they came out nice and tender.

Although tasty, this recipe just seemed to be missing something. Needed a little more kick to it, maybe some more spices or something. It also made a LOT of food. I would definatly downsize the recipe a bit because the leftovers weren't near as good as the fresh made dish. I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe.

Very good eggplant I loved it not greasy and not at all dry. I loved it in the oven instead of frying it.

I didn't bread the eggplant before frying but still dipped it in egg so that it could be South Beach Diet approved.  it was great.

Not very good as the recipe has it, but I think I sliced the eggplant too thickly.  My husband and I didn't want to eat the leftovers, but we chopped up the eggplant and used it over pasta.  It was great that way.

Next time when I make this I will soak the eggplant in less salt and for less time! Otherwise, it tasted great and my husband didn't notice it has too much salt...

I found that the eggplant was completely lost in this recipe.  Once you baked it, then smothered it, then baked it some more, all you really tasted was spaghetti sauce and cheese.  I think I'll just stick to grilling my eggplant.

This recipe was tasty.  I was in a hurry and did not peel the eggplant.  It was still good but I think it would be better peeled. I like my eggplant to be soft so I cooked it a bit longer.

I will make this again. I used one eggplant and eyeballed the remaining ingredients.  Like another person posted, this recipe is more like eggplant lasagne than eggplant parmesan, but that may depend on how big a pan is used to layer.  One layer would be similar to parmesan. I used a 2 quart casserole and had 3 layers. This was good.  Alter the cheese and sauce to taste.

We didn't like this one.  Not sure if it's because we don't normally eat eggplant, but it was sort of mushy and just didn't taste very good.  I liked the breaded eggplant better than the finished product.

Okay dish but not great.  I kept the skin on because I likes my eggplant skin.  Also, you need to BOIL THE EGGPLANT for at least 30 minutes before you begin!  Most people underestimate the toughness of this wily veggie and that results in a bad dish.  Eggplant is best served soft, to the point of mushy.  If you slice it too thin and then bake, it'll just be dry.  Also the recipe called for way too much sauce, it drowned everything.  Next time, I'll stick with the old fried way.

Very good!! The only change I made to the original recipe is that I "sweated" the eggplant before cooking, and baked for 10 minutes on each side rather than 5. I think next time I will wait and sprinkle cheese on top after cooking, the layer of cheese was a little much for me.

excellent! More like an eggplant lasagna than anything else. There was definitely more than enough eggplant called for in this recipe. i used 2.5 and made three layers in a dish. This fed around 15 and everyone was stuffed.

I made this recipe last night, and there is nothing left!  Absolutley delicious.  I had to use 2 eggs for 1 eggplant, which was fine.  As well the italian bread-brumbs made the eggplant moist and delicious.  I sliced it thin, and backed it for 10 min on each side, and it was perfect!  Delicous, I will make it again and again.

This was pretty good.  I'd never made anything with eggplant before.  My only problem was that the bottom layer of eggplant got really soggy.  Not sure how to fix that.  The top layers were good though!

It was good, I like my eggplant breaded and fried but tried the baked to save on fat but it loses alot of flavor in my opinion,plus the eggplant seemed chewy to me, cooked it longer than stated and it still was tough, frying does a better job. But it was easy to prepare.

This has an excellent flavor since it isn't bitter.  Even people who snub their noses toward eggplant like it.  I add a small jar of sliced mushrooms throughout the dish to add more texture.  You can even eat the eggplant by itself after baking and just use pasta sauce as a dip for appetizers!

Simply wonderful!  Only changes I made were: I too sweated the eggplant after first baked, I used homemade breadcrumbs made from Country Seed Bread from the Whole Foods Market, and my choice of spaghetti sauce was Muir Glen's Garden Vegetable.  It was very easy to make!  My 9-year-old daughter asked for seconds and my oh-so-finicky 7-year-old daughter made sure I put her 'seconds' aside for tomorrow's lunch.  They asked me to make it again tomorrow.  This is not going to happen, but I will surely give this recipe a place in my family recipe box.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe. I baked it 12 minutes instead of 5, as suggested by others. It was delicious and leftovers were devoured too. Thanks again!

We scaled the recipe down for 2 people. Tasted great for the most part. However, I don't think we cooked it long enough. Some parts of the dish had the texture of apples. :(  It was good advice to salt/sweat the eggplant first. Ours didn't taste bitter at all!

Wow!!  This was my first time cooking and eating eggplant....I was a little nervous.  I followed the advice in letting it sit out for twenty minutes before preparing the meal.  The end result was very delicious.  I will make this again.

The recipe would have been better if I asssembled the casserole in a different way. My recommendation is to put the final layer tomato sauce on top of the eggplant and then add cheese.  I placed the last layer of eggplant on top of the casserole (as the directions stated) and then sprinked it with cheese.  It was Very dry and crispy.

mmmm good! i even forgot to use oil or spray the pan and it still turned out good. I used seasoned bread crumbs so it was very tasty! i added basil & pepper to the bread crumbs. I think next time I will cut the eggplant in thicker slices. I cooked the eggplant longer than the directions said...overall I think I cooked it about 15-20 minutes first. It's the first time i have ever cooked w/ eggplant. My boyfriend loooved it! thanks!

This was awesome! I only had one eggplant so I made this as a co-dish with pasta. I sliced the eggplant lenghtwise and very thin (I got 13 slices from one eggplant).  I did spary the baking pans with a no fat cooking spray, but would also spread olive oil with a paper towel as another option.  It baked perfectly in 5 mins on each side.  Also, I alternanted my cheeses with each layer ending with mozerella on top.  I did not put much cheese in the layers and saved most for the topping.  This was yummy and heathly!!  A definite keeper!!!

I wanted to try this eggplant parm because it seemed so much better for you. Well the only way I could get the eggplant to brown in the oven and get soft was to drizzle olive oil on all of them. They do take about 15 minutes on each side as well so this is very time consuming recipe. It did taste great but I'm not sure mine was that much healthier then the fried version due to the added oil. As usual with most casseroles it tasted much better the next day.

I had doubts about the recipe because the eggplant was not fried.  After trying it, my doubts were gone.  This is every bit as good as Eggplant Parmesan that my Italian MIL and her mother used to make!  Of course, I used their homemade version of Italian gravy instead of a canned variety.  I loved it!

I made this.  My husband loved it.  That doesn't happen that often (since he is a much better cook than I am).  I added Tony Chachere's to make it a bit spicy.

It's very pretty and tasty.
However, baking the eggplant makes it quite dry. I wonder if others have the same problem.

What a surprise! I didn't think I liked eggplant until I made this dish! I didn't follow the recipe exactly but used it as a guideline along with some other reviewer suggestions.

This was certainly tasty and recommended.  I am not sure if I read the recipe incorrectly or not, but I had far too much bread crumbs and not enough egg (based on the recipe), so I would adjust for this.

A good basic recipe, though frying the eggplant slices, while less healthy, really tastes SO much better.  Also, I would recommend simmering a "homemade" tomato sauce while the eggplant slices are baking/frying - it tastes so much better than the store bought corn-syrupy kind, especially when it involves several cloves of garlic....

I love Eggplant Parmesan, and now I dont have to go out to get it!  This was a wonderful recipe, and a learning experince at that.  It took me a couple tries to not get the eggplant mushy, but I finally got it right!  I also added a tablespoon of red wine to the sauce, and some garlic powder, and that worked great too!

This was my first attempt at making eggplant parmesan.  I realize this is listed as a vegetarian meal; however, I added lean ground beef.  To reduce the high sodium content, I omitted the Italian Bread Crumbs and used yellow cornmeal which I flavored with Mrs. Dash italian seasoning mix.  I also added some cottage cheese.  My husband was surprised at how good this tasted, but he said it's missing "something".  Not sure what it is!  I plan to try this one again using ground chicken or turkey and soy cheeses.  Thanks Dolores!
