This recipe is delicious!  I've made it as is a couple of times with huge compliments.  Last night we made it with just harvested collard greens.  Really you NEED to make this!  Don't change a thing the first time.

I have made this a few times, but we do not like very spicy foods.  I used one small red cherry pepper and the pinch of red pepper flakes and it still had a nice kick.  I used cannellini beans, also.  Very awesome recipe.

Absolutely delicious. The only change I made was I used a specialty bacon from a local smokehouse instead of pancetta. The bacon is smoked with ghost peppers and added the perfect amount of heat! ???

Being from WNY we make this on the regular.  Adding and subtracting ingredients based on what’s in the pantry.  I use jarred hot cherry peppers and usually add quartered artichokes.  Love it as a side or main dish..

My ex’s mother made this. I find to be an energy boost during the cold months. Not a fan of kale but besides the escarole I include  collard green and Swiss chard just for the nutrients. The one thing I noticed in following her, no othe recipe includes smoked ham hocks.  These add flavor  as well as  a lot of  collagen.  delicious.

Love this dish with a little alteration.  It is an Italian dish made in Utica New York.  Very Italian population.
