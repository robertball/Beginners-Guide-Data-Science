Unfortunately this wasn't edible. I followed the recipe very closely except for the fact that I reduced the amount of onion as 1 cup seemed excessive for this small dish. I served this to seven family members, 6 of which like zucchini. Nobody took more than 1 bite and the rest ended up dumped. Luckily it wasn't a very expensive dish to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand. The consistancy was unflattering and the onion (even reduced) was so overpowering my family thought it was an "Onion Casserole". Usually I try each recipe more than once if I think it has potential but for my family this is a no-go.

Good Recipe.  I modified it a bit by adding tyme, garlic salt and white pepper.  I did not smash the veggies, I kept them chopped and it was tasty.  It complimented my chicken stuffed with fresh spinach and gouda cheese. Thanks!

This is a great summer time dish! I recommend putting more spices than just salt and pepper and maybe a table spoon more horseradish.  Other than that I love it!

At fist I wasn't sure about this.But once I tried it I have to say I'm a fan.The best thing is the kids ate this and didn't know they were eating something good for them.The opnly thing was that the prep time was definatly more than 15 minutes.Other than that it was great.

This was tasty. I did reduce the onion because just looking at the recipe I could tell it would be too much for me.  I used butter flavored seasoning, a mixture of summer squash, a whole egg and had some leftover cheese crackers that I used on top

We liked this, although I did double the horseradish and could have added even a little more. I think garlic would be a good addition, too.

very good flavor, but WAY too much butter.  We are going to try it again with about 1/3 of the cutter the recipe suggested.  But I thought it had a good flavor and lots of potential.

This my favorite zucchini recipe.  I use 2 cups of cracker crumbs and after adding the butter to crumbs I add about 1/3 of crumbs to zucchini mixture.  Also add 1 cup cubed American cheese.  The horseradish gives this a unique flavor.  Don't leave it out.

I added a heaping spoonful of the horseradish and it seemed to be the perfect balance.  Really nice as a side dish to a red meat meal like roast or steak.  I added the whole egg instead of a Tablespoon to save wasting it.  It tasted fine, and it didn't ruin it, but it was a bit too much.  I would stick to the amout called for.  I didn't like that I had to wait for the veggies to cool before adding the egg (didn't want the egg to set before baking time) and that is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars (I hate waiting).  I will make this again, but next time use bread crumbs and butter instead of crackers, and maybe top it off with a bit of chedder.

tastes a lot like quiche. we thought a little meat and cheese or spinach and cheese, it would be an excellent quiche. Loved it and it was a great way to eat some of the tons of zucchini growing in the garden.

Don't rate this highly at all. For the anount of work, the result had poor texture and the cracker top was inconvincing. I wouldn't do it again.

I have made this for many years but I have always put some grated cheese in it.  I really like it with cheese, I imagine it would also be good without. Also I don't mash the veggies.

Tasty and easy; didn't really notice any "zest" from the horseradish.

Very delicious. Used the whole egg, added garlic to the boiled mixture, used garlic salt instead of regular salt, used panko instead of crackers, and added flax seed to the panko mixture. Will absolutely make this again.
