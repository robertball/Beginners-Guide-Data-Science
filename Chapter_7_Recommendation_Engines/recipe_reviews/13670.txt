Great moist stuffing - even cooked inside the turkey.  I used some chopped portabello mushrooms instead of all button mushrooms to add some additional flavor.  Also, to save time, I made the stuffing and refridgerated it overnight before cooking and it turned out fine.

I have made this recipe for the last 3 years and it is always a hit. I've shared the recipe each year with family and friends. I don't measure the bread crumbs but dry 1 loaf of bread, cube it and then double the broth and poultry seasoning. I also use less than a cup of onion and celery.  One cup of each is a little too much for us. This year we added portabella mushrooms and it was wonderful.  I didn't put the apple in but may have to try it the next time. This is a very good recipe and there are never any leftovers. Thanks for sharing your recipe Christine!

Okay, there are a few things you need to know about this recipe.  It is a good blueprint for stuffing, but 1) DO NOT USE CRUMBS!!!  Substitute for cubed bread, I used a bag from the grocery store, which turned out find.  Also, 12 cups is too much, 10 cups of cubed bread worked very well.  2)  USE AT LEAST 3 CUPS CHICKEN BROTH/STOCK.  This made it moist and delicious!!! 3)  ADD ONE CLOVE GARLIC to the onion/celery saute.  And finally, 4) USE A VARIETY OF MUSHROOMS, this will add to the depth of flavor of the stuffing.  I used a gourmet mix and 'baby bellos'.  I did a 'rehearsal' of this recipe tonight and it came out absolutely delicious with the changes I listed above.  If you have any mushroom lovers in your house, this will surely be a winner!

I didn't think anything could rival my mother's stuffing recipe, but after making this for Thanksgiving, I now know I was wrong!  Delicious, the whole family loved it!!

I made this stuffing for thanksgiving 2003 and it was a disaster.  12 cups of bread crumbs is way too much for this recipe.  I would suggest using only 6 cups.

Everyone loved the stuffing!  It was great.  I did change how much broth I added.  I almost doubled it so it wouldn't be dry.  The stuffing cooked in the casserole dish was just as moist as the stuffing I cooked in the turkey!

This was excellent tasting, but far too dry.  In the end I found that it needed about 3 times the amount of liquid suggested.

This was the alughing stock of my 2003 Thanksgiving. I might have known that 12 cups of bread crumbs and only 1.5 cups of broth was suspect. Don't waste your money or your ingredients. This wasn't even edible.

I followed the advice of other reviews and doubled the amount of chicken broth, and used baby portabella mushrooms.  Overall, I was pleased with the results.  My dad felt it was too oniony, however, my brother who has never like stuffing really liked this recipe.

I think I must have done something wrong.  My stuffing came out very dry.  Even before putting it in the oven I had to add extra broth to get it to a moist state.  The taste was good but it was dry.  I would probably make this again just to see if it came out any different.

This recipe calls for 12 cups of bread CRUMBS. This has to be a typo. I believe cubes or crutons is what is ment to be used. I made this recipe today and there is no way that 12 cups of bread CRUMBS is accurate. I ended up using 1/2 a gallon of broth just to make it managable. The end result is pretty tasty...but I doubt it is what the intended result should have been. The single star does not represent the quality of the food, rather the accuracy of the recipe. I will be making a second attempt tomorrow, with cubes/crutons,  and I will post the results.

I made this for Thanksgiving 4 years ago and my mother-in-law has requested it every year since.  It's delicious!  I add some garlic to the mushroom/celery/onion mix and a little sage.  I also double the amount of broth to get it the right consistency, as suggested by previous reviews.

This recipe was very good but I did make a few changes.  I made it with cubed french bread that had been toasted.  I also added way more salt, pepper and poultry then the recipe called for.  I am glad because I think it would have been very bland otherwise.  I also did not add parsley because I did not have any.  I will be making this again for sure.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was quite nice, although I think it could have done with a bit more punch to it, perhaps a bit more onion than the recipe called for and some sage as we found it slightly bland. I also think it would have worked better with cubed bread rather than finer breadcrumbs.

This recipe turned out amazing! Thought it might come out dry but read the other reviews and added more broth, perfect! I also put a little spin on it and left out the apples but added some sausage. Before it went into the over, coated it with some parm. Gave it that crusty yumminess! Thanks for the recipe!

This is the third time I do this recipe. i love it, everyone loves it. It's traditional but the sweetness of the apples adds a modern twist to it. Try it once, you'll love it too.

This stuffing is wonderful, I too added portabella mushrooms and used a lot more chicken broth than stated. I turned out very moist and flavorful. I also melted a stick of butter and mixed in. Everything is better with butter and its a special occasion so I figured what the heck!! My daughter can't keep her hands off of it!! Thanks so much.

This was great. I left out the celery and the apple, and I only used one loaf of bread that I broke up and dried afew days beforehand, I didn't measure it by cups. It was perfectly moist, and had the taste I was looking for. (I am really picky about stuffing.)

This stuffing was very good.  I would cut back on the chopped apple or maybe use a red or yellow delicious instead.  Will make again.

I used 6 cups of garlic seasoned croutons. 12 cups of bread crumbs seemed to be too much. Don't be afraid to tweak recipes for your own taste. :D

This is an excellent recipe. I use it every year with shittake mushrooms and I make my bread crumbs out of Tuscan bread. Add enough broth so it looks right.

Do not use bread crumbs!!!  Use cubed bread.   Needs way more chicken broth, probably at least 3 cups.

I really liked this recipe. The mushrooms I used were chanterelles and portobello. Chanterelle mushrooms are my fave and the portobello adds a meatiness in the stuffing. I also had some broccoli on hand so I threw that in for more green. Before making this, I did refer to the other reviews about adding more liquid and what a great tip that was, however, because I had to scale the recipe greatly, I had to be careful not to add too much liquid. Overall, a solid stuffing to compliment your turkey and gravy!

I can't see how this recipe can possibly work with the quantity of ingredients listed. Even after mega tweaking it was dry and bland to our palate.

My husband and our guests would've given this 5 stars but I wasn't blown away by it. I used half the bread cubes, twice the chicken broth and portobellos instead of regular mushrooms. Probably about triple the spices too.

This stuffing is delicious! I cooked some of it inside the turkey and it was very moist.

Really disappointed in this recipe; I even doubled the broth to 3 cups for 12 cups of bread crumbs and it came out dry anyway. I do not recommend this stuffing recipe.

Made this for thanksgiving last year and plan on making it again this year. Instead of bread crumbs I used a loaf of cranberry swirl bread cut into cubes. It was the best stuffing I ever had and everyone raved about it.

The first time I made this recipe I did not realize how much this stuffing is made to serve, that was a mistake on my part haha.
I've played around with this recipe a bit I find that when I cook down the mushrooms and onions long enough before adding the rest of the fresh ingredients I have enough stock to moisten the large amount of bread crumbs. I've made this recipe multiple times and cooking down the mushrooms is the most important part. Too much cooking down and the stuffing will come out sopping wet and not cooking down enough and you'll have inedible stuffing.

Too dry. And I used less bread than the recipe called for! Really super dry and not that tasty. I admit I cooked it separately: I guess it works best if you stuff the bird with it but I did not want to stuff the turkey. I’ll try another one next year.

literally unappealing.  Decreased amounts of ingredients for a side to go with Cuban Style Roast Pork (fantastic on this site). despite the seasonings recommended and the addition of plenty of chicken broth, switching out salt for additional chicken bouillon, and adding a dash or two of mushroom flavored soy sauce, this could not be redeemed. perhaps a little more flavor if cooked inside a bird, but wouldn't 
go there again.

I cut the bread in half to 6 cups.  I also dropped the apples while doubling the mushrooms.  I mixed half Portabella & half Shiitake Mushrooms.  It took away a little of the crunch but made the flavor much bolder.

This is a pretty decent recipe. I myself really like sage stuffing so missed that a bit. The bread I used was a little too sweet for stuffing but overall the recipe is simple and easy enough to mix up for dressing. Will have to tweak the seasoning to match my tastes is all. Thumbs up!

This recipe is a keeper.  As always I make changes based on what I have on hand.  I chopped up six strips of bacon and sauteed the mushrooms, onions and celery in the bacon drippings.  I didn't have enough chicken stock so I added fat free half and half to make up the difference in the liquid.  Cooked it in a covered casserole dish, which kept it from getting dry.  It was perfect!  I will make it again.

Read the other reviews and doubled the amount of broth. I also used pre-seasoned bread cubes (made for stuffing) instead of the bread crumbs, spices and parsley. Turned out pretty well. Also reheats well - the sweetness of the apple dims as it sits.

This is my first time commenting.
Is asks for 12 cups of bread crumbs (equivalent to 12 full large containers of panko breads crumbs, way too much), I had to assume it was meant to read 1/2 cup not 12 cups. I bought bread cubes and extra liquid.   
My adjustment to keep it moist were
 1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 cup bread cups
8 oz of organic cream of mushroom soup
extra chicken broth for desired texture
It came out tasty but in truth I would not make it again and try another.  Lacked any type of savory flavor.

I finely chopped the mushrooms along with the onion and celery and used 2 more tablespoons of butter so next time, I'll just use the whole stick.  I did not use bread crumbs!  That is rather odd.  I always use the bagged bread pieces the grocers offer.  This was very tasty and I will make it again.  Everyone loved it.

I used 12 cups of bread CUBES, 2.5 cups of vegetable stock, 1/4 cup of cream, 4 ribs of celery, 5 shallots instead of onions, and added 3 sprigs of thyme, 6 sage leaves, & 1 sprig of rosemary.  I omitted the apple, the poultry seasoning and the parsley, and cooked it in my largest round Corningware casserole dish.  I LOVED it and I wish I could eat it every day.  However, this dish requires a fair amount of prep time, especially the cubing and baking of 3 batches of bread cubes (10 minutes per batch).  Definitely not an everyday dish.

You don't use 12 cups of crumbs! You use 12 cups of dried CUBED bread.  I just tear up a loaf of bread into crouton size chunks the night before and let them air dry till next day. Awesome, easy to adjust to personal preferences.

I made this for my vegetarian sister and it was pretty good. Not my favorite stuffing recipe but definitely tasty.
I changed it up just slightly... I used roasted garlic bread loaves purchased from Costco. Tore it into pieces and let it dry out for almost 24 hours. I then proceeded with the recipe. I used baby bella mushrooms for the shroom part. I added a teaspoon of dry sage along with the poultry seasoning stage, because stuffing just isn't the same to me without sage (personal preference :). I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to honor the vegetarian eater and I didn't measure how much... I just added it slowly until it seemed to be appropriately moistened. I think I used about 1 1/3 cans. Turned out quite well. :)
