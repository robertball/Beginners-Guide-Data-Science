This was so good. I was a bit Leary since it seemed like such a strange combination of ingredients. It was messy, but the entire family loved it.

Delicious! The entire family gobbled It up! I cooked my own pulled pork in the slow cooker during the day and then made these quesadillas at dinner. I made my own “spicy” cream cheese using neufatchel, garlic powder, and mild diced chilies so they weren’t too spicy for my children to eat. Highly recommend!

These were so good! I loved the cream cheese and jalapeno taste with the leftover BBQ pork I used. Mine were a bit messy from the sauce, so I should have drained the meat a little better.

Love the flavors of this recipe. I prefer corn tortillas so didn't fold them but may have to try the flour next time. Used leftover pulled pork from "Pulled Pork Y'all"
