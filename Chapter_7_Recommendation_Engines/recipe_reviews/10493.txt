This is a very easy recipe and a good way to use up "leftover" egg whites! I doubled the recipe and used unsweetend coconut flakes. The coconut gives the meringues more flavor and makes it more dense than the regular light and airy meringues. I tinted it blue - we call them meringue clouds. They just melt in your mouth!!

Easy & Good! Bonus is these goodies won't derail your diet at the holidays.... I made a few batches and experimented with different extracts but the coconut ones were by far my favorite! I added 2 drops of green food coloring with the extract. I think next time I might tint the coconut RED and the meringues Green... very festive!   One more tip- instead of dropping them by teaspoons I put it in a Qt size ziplock bag and cut the tip and piped them on so I could add a slight swirl- they turned out great and look pretty- see picture

This was my first time making meringue, and it turned out perfect!  I beat it until the egg white mix didn't slide around in the bowl when I tipped it- took about 15 minutes on med-high.  I did not add the almond extract. They were a bit too sweet, next time I will use only 1/2 cup powdered sugar, or make sure I use unsweetened coconut.  I will also double the recipe, because 12 of these was not enough!  My kids called them "cloud cookies", I will definitely make them again and again!  Thanks for such a fun recipe!

These were very good, I enjoyed them a lot. I don't think I will add the almond extract next time though.

This is a great recipe! I will make it again and again! I took the advice of fellow reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, because I was using sweetened coconut. I also added 3 drops of blue food coloring to make them more cloud-like. I did have to bake them for an additional 10 minutes, but I am working with a new oven. All in all, fluffy, adorable, and VERY low cal. Thanks again!

Followed everything to a T. My roommate loved them but I could barely eat one of these because it was far too sweet in my opinion. It's definitely one that you either love or hate.

Excellent recipe.  I doubled it up, since I had 4 egg whites to use.  I also chopped the coconut in a food processor for a few pulses, so the coconut was not so "stringy" and used half almond extract and half coconut extract.  Delicious on their own but even more incredible when sandwiched together with whipped cream (I added a couple of teaspoons of cream of coconut instant pudding to the cream instead of sugar when whipping!)  Wow!

This is a very yummy meringues, however the sugar can be cut to 1/2 half cup. 3/4 cups is just a little too sweet for a meringue.
Also, I only got 12 small cookies with the original recipe. I'll definitely double or triple the next time around.
Might even try adding a couple tablespoons of cocoa powder next time...what's not to like about a chocolate coconut combination

Easy and delicious. I added a bit more coconut because I love it - maybe another tablespoon.  Baked them on a Silpat mat.  Will definitely make again.

These were great!  I doubled the recipe as I had 4 egg whites to use up.  Also doubled the amount of coconut after that.  I used unsweetened coconut and they turned out perfectly.  I used them as a second desert along with the lemon cake with lemon filling recipe on this site.

The taste was good, but they fell apart and were very flat.

What a delightful way to use up extra egg whites. I  made these today after I read reviews,I also only  used 1/2 cup  conf sugar. They were  sweet enough. I  will  make again  and  I   made   15  bite sized  meringues from  this recipe.

I tried these meringues because I'm dieting and wanted a sweet treat with minimal calories and fat.  They are DELICIOUS!  I also found them very easy to make.  I did not have any cream of tartar in the house, so I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 teaspoon white vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  I only used about 1/8 teaspoon of almond extract, even for a double recipe.  They were perfect - there was a tiny, tiny hint of almond, but it was not overpowering for these delicate cookies.  The coconut was a wonderful addition of texture and flavor.  I will definitely be making these again, and I suspect they will be a go-to diet dessert on many occasions!

For the life of me I couldn't get this to work at all. As soon as I added coconut they turned to mush and became liquid globs. When I cooked they stuck to the pan. They stuck to parchment paper and they stuck to a greased cookie sheet too so I had to give up. I tried 3x.

First time making meringues. I doubled the recipe, using sweetened coconut. I meant to only use 1 total cup of sugar but I was rushing and ended up putting a cup and a half anyway. I baked for one hour, cooled a few mins and some insides weren't dry. Did another 10, same problem. So I did another 10 and they were fine. I used 2 extra large airbake sheets and parchment paper. I piped them using a large ziplock bag. This made about 60 bit size pieces and a whole bunch of little dots (had leftover in the bag) Next time I'll add more coconut and less sugar, and bake for an hour and 15 in one shot.

I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla. Excellent recipe. I also used a piping bag and the mixture was easy to use.
