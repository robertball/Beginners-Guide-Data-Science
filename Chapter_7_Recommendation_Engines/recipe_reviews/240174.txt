Made it for a 80th birthday party - young and old alike loved it. We were not allowed to have anything red for beverages at the venue so used sparkling white grape juice instead. It was a huge hit. Granddaughters'  request it for Christmas as well

I made this for my lunch tables thanksgiving potluck, and everyone loved it! Although I didn't include the sparkling red grape juice, it was still very yummy. I put it in a cooler with ice blocks and even though the cooler barely fit in my locker, it stayed cold all the way until lunch time! Great recipe!

I made this recipe tonight for our Bible Study group and everyone loved it. We drank it cold and warm and both ways was delicious. Everyone went crazy over it.
