This is my recipe, and I just wanted to add that this is a great thing to take to a holiday party, and use red and green diced peppers on top!

Mayo in the recipe caused me to hesitate.  I didnâ€™t have Italian dressing packet either. I made an Italian dressing recipe I found online and gave this recipe a shot (even the mayo). My kids and husband love it. They have raved about how good this tastes and told me over and over that this recipe is a keeper. I followed the recipe and will definitely make it again.

3.23.16   Used red, yellow and orange mini bell peppers instead of green, otherwise, followed the recipe.  This is a tasty combination of cheesy-creamy with just the right amount of tang from the Italian dressing.  This mixture can be mixed up early in the day and then spread on the baguette slices just prior to baking later.  We enjoyed them best right out of the oven, but they were still good even when they cooled down.  And as a bonus, they're EXTREMELY quick and easy!  Melanie Wiens Craddock, thanks for the new appetizer, it's a keeper.
