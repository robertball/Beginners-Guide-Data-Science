Totally charmed by the name of this confection and knowing that my third graders would love it too, I had to try the recipe! Total hit! I gave each of them a copy of the recipe to try at home. I did substitute Corn Pops for the corn puff snack as my store didn't carry them. I'd like to try again when I can shop around for the corn puffs. Thank you, Jeannine!

I didn't know what butter flavored corn puffs were, either, but I googled them and found there are several brands of these puffed but hull-less popcorn.  The most popular is "Chester" (from Frito-Lay) and has a limited distribution area.  If not in your local store, Amazon carries 12-4.5 oz. bags for about $28 [ouch!]

YUM, this was good! I just eyeballed everything and spooned them into candy papers to make life easier. This combo has really great flavor...I added some sprinkles to the top for the little guy. This was easy, fun and a definite do-over recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

YUM! It's pretty rare that I make any sort of sweet that my husband will eat, but he LOVED this stuff. It wasn't too sweet, which is the key for him. Stole Christina's wonderful idea and spooned it into paper candy cups and sprinkled with shamrock sprinkles.  Seriously addicting stuff. Thanks! :)

Just not a good day for me in the kitchen.  The chocolate chips started to seize in the microwave, so I transferred them to a double boiler.  I had to add a little bit of cream to the chocolate to make it a coatable consistency for the puffs.  I don't know how much coating the puffs should have, but it didn't seem like quite enough to me.  The white chocolate does taste good, and it is super sweet (almost too much so for us).  Thanks Jeannine for a 2-ingredient recipe.  There aren't too many of them around.

I used almond bark instead of white chocolate chips, one pound of bark per bag of Chester's Puffcorn. Wonderful and so easy!

I use the Kroger brand almond bark that comes in a microwavable tray, dump it over a bowl filled with an entire $2 bag of Chester Cheetah popcorn  puffs, toss it around for a while (it never seems like it's going to be enough, but it always is), pour it out onto a cookie sheet lined with wax paper, pop it in the freezer for a few minutes until it's hardened, take it out, break it up, and voila.  Easiest recipe ever and everyone will go nuts over it. I have family members who camp out next to the bowl at holiday functions bc they can't get enough of this stuff.  If you do add sprinkles, add them on the cookie sheet right before they go on the freezer.  If you add them before tossing, the sprinkles will melt.  If you add them after the freezer, the sprinkles won't stick.

I made this for Christmas last year to sprinkle over my cookie trays. It was a hit! I sprinkled red and green jimmies on it to make it festive.
So for a halloween party this year, i used regular chocolate chips instead of white and called it devils poop. I added some edible eyeballs to 'fun' it up.

I just now realized this called for the hulless popcorn- last year I made this twice, but used a bag of microwaveable popcorn- my family loved it! To make it more Christmas-y, I drizzled melted  green and red candy melts over it while it was drying... it was a super simple, quick, but yummy treat!

The only corn puffs I could find were Kroger brand Corn Puff Poppers Extreme Butter. I used 2 five-ounce bags but covered the puffs with an entire 12 ounce bag of white chocolate chips. After combining I felt that I needed more, so I added some white Ghirardelli melting wafers. I like the melting wafers better because they melt thinner and spread better.  I added some Brach's Autumn Mix (pumpkins and candy corn) to make this a Halloween treat.

05-04-16 ~  I have made this recipe many, many times over the course of many, many years.  This was the first time I've heard it referred to as 'Angel Poop'.  lol  I made this for a United Methodist Pastor's Conference.  Made a double batch and added a few sprinkles for color.  Great recipe that I know will be made again and again.
