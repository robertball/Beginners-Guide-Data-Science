This was very bland. I added extra bread crumbs and butter still bland. I had to add boullion cubes to it to give it flavor.

You really can't go wrong with sour cream cream cheese and green onions in mashed potatoes. I think it would be better with more almonds though. They provided a little bit of texture but more or less got lost in the potatoes and provided little to no almond flavor. Could use more crumbs on top too. I don't care for whipped potatoes so I beat the cream cheese and sour cream together and stirred it into the mashed potatoes along with the S&P and green onions-worked great for my preference. Will try again with more almonds and bread crumbs.
