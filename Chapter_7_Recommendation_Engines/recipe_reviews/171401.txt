Pretty close to what I grew up on in my greek family. I nix the capers, and dress it with olive oil and vinegar, maybe a bit of lemon if I have it on hand. Make sure you use Kalamata olives. Also great with avocado if you have any on hand. Not authentic, but it goes really well with the mix.  thanks for posting! =)

I made this for my Son, Daughter-in-law and two of my teenaged grandchildren last night. My grandaughter is vegan and loved it and my grandson ate his (telling me all the way through how great it was) and ate the last half of mine because I am not a big eater. What is amazing is that my b-i-law who was a cook and only eats meat and potatoes and doesn't like salads ate the whole thing! The only thing I did different was hollow out big tomatoes and stuff them with the salad and put it in the fridge until dinner. Served on a salad plate with romaine lettuce beneath. They loved the presentation. I used Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House dressing from this site. TO DIE FOR!

I just use olive oil and sometimes balsamic vinegar to dress this salad.  Capers are a nice touch, as are red peppers.  Also AMAZING with fresh dill.

This makes a fairly authentic Greek Salad.  When I have capers I definitely add them with a little of the brine as well.  I learned that from my Greek husband, Kostas.  In Greece, instead of dressing  they often use just  olive oil and oregano but we always added a little red wine vinegar too.  You could also add a bit of green pepper if you like.  Also important would be the quality of the feta and the oil.  I would get a feta made with goat and/or sheep's milk as the typical grocery store feta is not nearly as good and doesn't have the nice texture of the goat or sheep feta.  Also, use a first cold pressed extra virgin olive oil.

Per a month in Greece (Athens, Rhodes and Santorini) I'd agree with AmyLynn and nix the capers. However, I've got to say this is pretty close to what is considered a Greek salad. For dressing I juice a couple lemons and shake it with 2 tbsp EVOO, turns out great - nice and light - plus it saves you finding Greek salad dressing in the South ;)

This was awesome. I made it with balsalmic vinaigrette dressing and added oregano. I'm not a tomato person but i like them in this salad ^_^ I, too, like that it doesn't have lettuce, my mom's allergic.

I don't remember capers.  But everything is right on.  I like to rub dried oregano on it and make my own dressing (my husband prefers non-bottled dressing)  but thank you so much for offering a "no lettuce" authentic greek salad.  I couldn't improve on it.

I used EVOO instead of the dressing with some Greek Seasoning (from this website) and it was absolutely delicious.  Will try again after I get some of the Greek salad dressing to see if perfection can be improved on...

Wonderful as is!  I have made this several times since and I omit the capers and use the "Absolutely Fabulous Greek Dressing" on this site.  Very fresh and light! Thanks for sharing!

I did marinate  1/2 of the feta cheese in some dressing for about 15 min. before serving and added some romaine lettuce, this was very good.

This was a big hit at a potluck I recently brought it too.  I Used the Absolutely Fabulous Greek Dressing recipe from this site as others suggested and it turned out wonderfully.  I combined the tomatoes, cucs, capers and olives and kept the dressing, onions & cheese separate until right before serving.  My only suggestion would be to cut back the capers to 2 oz and rinse them well.  4 oz was just too many capers.  I'd use about an ounce less feta next time too.  Over all great recipe!  Thank's for posting Lisawas!

I followed the recipe exactly, made it in the morning and let it marinate all day, then served it at dinner. It is a truly delicious salad. The addition of capers really add a nice flavour. I served this with the chicken souvlaki recipe from this site. This will be a new go-to recipe for us. Thank you.

Fantastic little recipe!!  I didn't have the capers (thought I did!) so I left them out.  I loved it and put it on sandwiches and ate it plain as well.  Was great leftover.  YUM!

I served this with Chicken Piccata, so I didn't add capers to this too. I used 2 cuckes, fresh dill, fresh basil. I'm particular about my feta, it has to be in the brine, sliced and crumbled by hand. I had some aioli (crushed garlic with lemon and olive oil) and added it to "the dressing" with basil/oregano flavored balsamic vinegar. Kosher salt, dill and basil go on top at the end. I only had grape tomatoes, sliced in quarters. The only "problem" is watery on the bottom. I drained it a few times while I kept adding ingredients. If I had time, I would've salted the tomatoes and cukes and drained, but if you serve with a slotted spoon, it is fine. The whole family loved it, I just made it for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day. I left the leftovers, and she was grateful!

I left out the capers.  I knew it wouldn't go over well.  Otherwise, followed it as called for.  I do not like red onions but I didn't notice them.  This was outstanding.  Everyone but the 8 year old liked it with the adults going for seconds.  Leftovers will be calling my name tonight but will try really, really hard to leave it for lunch tomorrow. I don't think I stand a chance though.

Nice! Greek salads are very simple. No salad dressing..keep it simple,healthy and fresh!! Tomatoes,cucumbers,onion,feta,olives,vinegar(red wine) and of course olive oil!!!! That's what the basic Greek salad is like and especially when you go to Athens. Just don't forget vinegar...just red wine vinegar and olive oil makes a whole difference! Ahh, I almost forgot..salt. Most important!! Also if you want balsamic is nice too but authentic GREEK salad is with vinegar :-)
