This is so good. It's much better than the kind I've had from the store. The fresh roasted rice flavor makes the difference. I made jars of this as gifts for friends. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I was going to make a double batch, so had twice the amount of rice but then changed my mind. So I had twice the rice in mine and everything else was about the same as the recipe says. It's VERY good tea. Will be a staple for me now.

Thanks for posting this. I used to drink brown rice tea a lot when I worked in the city, but haven't been able to find it anywhere else.  I followed this recipe (double the rice, minus the green tea) and it's perfect.  I just threw the rice in the coffee maker (with filter) and it came out okay, but I think stovetop would pull the flavor out better.   This looks like a great gift idea too, easy & inexpensive. Thanks for sharing :D
