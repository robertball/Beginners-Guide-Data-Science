I am not one to usually write reviews but this recipe deserves the time.  This is an OUTSTANDING recipe.  These cupcakes appeal to all tastes.  I made 130 of them for a cupcake tower for my daughter's graduation.  They are not fussy however they are special enough.  Everyone LOVED them... even the chocolate lovers.  I would also like to add that the frosting held up in 90+ degrees in high humidity.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It has been added to my favorites in my collection and already been passed on to several family members.

I wasn't too sure about the combination of brownies and cake, but these are incredible!  The trio of chocolate, strawberry, & vanilla are just perfect! They are also quite visually appealing.  Super sweet, but hey it's a cupcake not a muffin!!

Absolutely wonderful! I wasn't sure  how these would turn out, but my anti-sweets husband LOVED them. They do need to stay in the oven another 4-5 minutes so they cook all the way, but they are wonderful.

I tried this yesterday and they were the best cupcakes I've ever made. Very moist, and extrememly delicious! Like other posts, I agree that there is too much brownie mix to cupcake mix. For 24 cupcakes I used a box of the cake mix and only half of the brownie mix... and it came out to the perfect proportions in my opinion. I filled each liner with 1tbs of brownie batter and 3tbs of cake batter. Since this was inspired by the neopolitan ice cream as well... I went ahead and piped my vanilla frosting into a McDonald's styled icecream swirl, adding a cherry on top for extra visual appeal. Definitely will be trying this recipe again!

Love this recipe. Chocolate and strawberry taste so good together and the frosting is perfect. I ran out of the strawberry cake mix after filling 30 cupcakes so I put the extra brownie mix into a small pan and baked it so I have brownies too. I used 2 different types of cupcake pans, 1 Faberware which is heavier and a little darker and my 40 year old Sears aluminum, so 1/2 of my cupcakes were burnt on the bottom. The ones that were not burnt are delicious. Will definitely make these again.

I added sprinkles after piping the icing with a stemmed cherry on top and half a pirouette poked in like a straw. Ridiculously cute! The niece, who never eats more than the icing on cupcakes, devoured this one entirely and asked for but was denied a second one.

This turned out good.  I was really pleased with the aesthics.  However,next time instead of making a double batter of brownie mix and one batter of strawberry cake mix, I will make a double batter of strawberry cake mix and one mix of the brownie.  I was scraping the bowl of the strawberry cake mixture to create 24 cupcakes and was left with tons of brownie mix. Not a big deal because I just baked the brownie mix on its own.

I was really afraid with the 2 different densities that this would not work out,  but to my surprise and everyone's delight it was perfect.  

I also could have used 1/2 the brownie mix.  I only put about a Tablespoon of brownie and then filled the rest with the strawberry and it came out perfect,  but I only got 30 cupcakes and an 8X8 pan of brownies which no one complained about.

This went over very well. I had to make the strawberry cake from scratch because our stores do not sell it. They even smelled like neapolitan ice cream. Will make again.

I didn't need 48 cupcakes so I used one strawberry cake and one brownie mix.  It still came out great and made about 30.

This recipe was a hit at work and home.  I used 1 tbsp of brownie mix instead of 2 since the first batch brownie portion was not baked all the way. My family and co-workers always beg me to make these! This recipe is amazing and adorable to the eye and taste buds!

I absolutely loved these!! The only change I made was the frosting. I used a white chocolate pudding frosting and topped with little sprinkle of chopped pecans and a maraschino cherry.

These are delicious!!! I used the Duff strawberry cake mix and ghiradelli brownie mix(only used one package and halved oil, eggs, and water) since other reviewers commented on having too much brownie dough.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Made them for my daughters pinkalicious birthday party and they were a hit.  They keep very well, they looked and tasted great even after sitting out at the party all day.  YUM!!!

I have used this recipe several times for parties. I used the mini muffin pans to make small cupcakes for bridal showers and both large and small ones for birthday parties. My husband likes the small ones best because you get all flavors in one bite.

Believe the other reviews -- it really does taste/smell like the ice cream!  I didn't have any brownie mix so I just made a batch from the Bakers Unsweetened Choc box repice.   I put 1 Tbsp of brownie batter in each muffin cup and topped it with 1 to 1-1/2 Tbsp strawberry cake batter.   The cake mix I had was 15 oz. or so (I think they used to be 18 ozs but the economy had crapped out and now they are less!)  I got 24 cupcakes out of this, plus some extra brownie batter which I baked separately (for my chocoholic husband).

I've been wanting to try this but looking for a great occasion to bring in.  Well, it was a success to the young and old!  It looks exactly like the photo!  Didn't change a thing in baking these cupcakes but used the cream cheese frosting that I still have. It didn't change a thing - my 2 dozens --they were gone in a few minutes!
Thanks for sharing!  It looked great as well!

I admit I was skeptical of this recipe although it sounded so yummy.  I only used 1 box of brownie mix and 1/2 the frosting to make 30 cupcakes.  The brownie mix was just enough but I am sorry I cut the frosting in half.  They were SO delicious.  They are a keeper for sure.  Thanks so much.  They will be a perfect addition to my recipe on here for Crab Dip during football games on Sunday!!!

Very simple and very tasty. Based upon reviews, for 24 cupcakes, I used 1 package of each mix, using the proportions of ingredients on the package (brownie mix was different than the recipe). Two cooking tablespoons of brownie mix didn't make 24 cupcakes, so I just redistributed the brownie mix until I had the bottoms of 24 liners filled equally. I had plenty of cake batter for 24 cupcakes. Frosting is also very good, but one really doesn't need to sift the confectioners sugar since you are beating the heck out of the frosting. Thank you!

These are really good. Think these can look very impressive to serve, the different elements make them nice. I've only made once so far and learned you need to use liners to keep it all together. I didn't make frosting as this is something I haven't learned yet but in the process. Wait for next get together to make these again as all my family loves brownies.

I didn’t get a taste yet, but they look adorable!! I added a splash of milk to the frosting because it was way too stiff to pipe. I hope they taste as good as they look!!!!

I made these for a friends birthday and they turned out good. When making in the future I would add some sour cream to the cake but otherwise great:

The biggest problem is that the brownies stuck so badly to the paper that they separated from the cake layer, creating a big frosting mess and genuine frustration. Also, if you don't like the cake box taste, you won't like these.  It's a lot of effort for a cupcake that doesn't taste homemade.

Something went wrong with mine, the strawberry tops sunk inward and the brownie bottom didnt cook all the way. They taste great but its a bit of a goopy mess.

Like many reviewers I think cutting the brownie mix on the bottom by half and then adding strawberry flavoring to the strawberry portion balanced out the flavors better. Otherwise the brownie overwhelms the strawberry. Beautiful cupcakes, delicious when flavors are balanced.

This was so good! I used only one box brownie mix (didn't end up using all of the batter) and 1 box strawberry cake mix. I used a doctored up cake mix recipe for the strawberry mix which worked perfect, moist and lovely. I also found a recipe for a strawberry cream cheese icing. This is one of the better cupcakes I have made. Thank you!

These were great!  I must've filled my cupcake liners a bit more full than indicated, because I only had about 30 cupcakes, which was fine. I frosted them with canned vanilla frosting because I was short of time. They were wonderful!

I will be making these for the 3rd time tomorrow - they are moist and the combination of strawberry and brownie is perfect.  Plus they are very cute.  Always a hit.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe. I usually don't like icing but the buttercream icing was so fluffy and just the right amount of sweet.

I make these every year for my kids on their birthdays to take to school. The kids in their classes always rave about them, and spend the rest of the school year begging me to make more. Definetly a favorite.

Cupcakes were a flop. =/ The brownie batter takes much longer to cook then the cake batter so I ended up with an overcooked top and the brownie was very raw in the middle. Also I am not sure what brands of cake and brownie batter were used by the author of this recipe but I was unable to locate brownie mix or strawberry cake mix in either of the correct sizes and this recipe made no where near 4 dozen cupcakes.

Tasty. Didn't make the frosting as I thought that the cake and brownie combo would be sweet enough. I ended up making 18 cupcakes with 1 strawberry cake box and 1/2 brownie mix box. The recipe doesn't adjust very well, but you can eyeball how much extra mix you need to make if you run out of one like I did.

Yummy! Use 1 tbs brownie mix and 2 tbs strawberry cake mix. Makes perfect size.

Also bake one cupcake at a time for even cooking with my oven.
