My husband thought this was excellent.  I also added some BBQ sauce to spice it up.  I think I would add onions next time I make it.

This was REALLY good.  I was surprised that the ingredients did go together.  I didn't read the directions well enough so I made several changes (without even knowing it).  I used 1/2 lb. bacon, 1 lb. pasta shells, 1 diced onion, 1/3 cup BBQ sauce, 2 cans tomato soup, and 1 can cheese soup along with the ground beef.  I mixed it all together and transferred it to a 9x13 baking dish, covered it with the cheddar cheese, baked it for 30 minutes at 350 and it was GREAT.  My small children GOBBLED it right up.

This was fantastic!  Based on some of the reviews, I tweaked it a bit.  I cooked the bacon first, then the beef with about 1/2 cup onions and 2 cloves garlic.  I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to the beef mixture.  I also added 2 cans of soup instead of one.   I didn't have BBQ sauce, so instead I added ketchup, brown sugar, and some worcestershire sauce, and mixed that in at the end before the cheese went on.  I used about 2 cups of cheddar on top rather than the 1 cup it called for.  All in all, this was SO good that I even ate the leftovers, which I normally never do.  I will definitely make this on a regular basis, as my husband and kids loved it as much as I did!

We really liked this recipe, including my 18-month old.  I did add the BBQ sauce (about 1/2 cup) and chopped onion, both of which we felt were good additions.  It probably would have been a little bland otherwise.  No mustard though; just a personal preferance.  I will definitely make this again and again.

very good and simple to make.  I cooked up the ground beef on the stove and cooked the bacon in the oven so they would be done at the same time.  I did add an extra can of tomato sauce to the recipe because I changed the quantity to 4 recipes (2 16 oz. boxes of pasta).  Campbells tomato sauce is very plain, but I think its suppose to be because of the ground beef, bacon and cheese flavors you have going on in there so I kept it simple and only added tastefully simple season salt and pepper.  was very good!

Wonderful! We loved it. Tastes like Hamburger Helper, but doesn't have the fake "out of a box" taste.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit with the finicky eaters in my house. I used this as a base recipe because it was a little bland for my family and added some ingredients I normally put in my burgers.

I call this "kid friendly" my grandchildren smiled, said MMMMMMM, and gobbled it up! Fun to use different pasta shapes bow ties, wheels etc.I just made it with bacon, hamburger, soup, pasta and mild cheddar cheese, no extras.  try using Velveeta or American cheese, as they would melt better...cheddar is a bit stringy.

My 4-year-old loves this stuff!!  It's quick and easy.  Just to make it extra good, I brown the bacon first, drain out most of the bacon grease and use a little to brown my hamburger and onion in so the bacon taste is well distributed.  I also use 2 cans of the tomato soup and add a dash or two of Worchestershire sauce mixed into it.  Yummy!  I think I'll make it for dinner Tuesday!

I added onions and garlic powder to the beef while it was browning. Also added spaghetti sauce to the soup mixture. It was really good but I think I'll leave the bbq sauce out next time and try it that way.

This was a great, simple recipe.  Adding BBQ sauce is a must, however.  Otherwise, a bit too bland.
I will definitely make this one a regular at our dinner table.  My teenager said it reminded her of a Carl's Jr Western Bacon Cheeseburger - only better!

Something was missing in this recipe and the flavoring was off. I have since found a much better bason cheeseburger pasta dish and will continue to use that one.

For a canned soup-based casserole, this was pretty good.  I followed the recipe as written, except I added more cheese (you can never have too much cheese!). I think more bacon would be appropriate ;-) .  I put KC Masterpiece Honey BBQ sauce on mine, but my husband loved it as it was.  I might try some chopped dill pickle next time, as that is a must for a real bacon cheeseburger!

My husband loves this recipe. As other reviewers have said, it is not fancy, but it is quick and easy.  I usually use two cans of soup and I add a can of corn for some crunch.  I use lots of cheese on top, because we love cheese!

I made this because I was looking for a quick meal. My husband and I really enjoyed it, and it only took about 20 mins to prepare. I did the same as some others; I used 1/2 of the tomato sauce and 1/2 of a can of cream of cheddar soup. Will definitely be adding this to our meal planner.

It was just "ok".  It was lacking flavor and was EXTREMELY heavy.   After the initial tasting I added onion powder and garlic powder. It still just didn't make the grade.  We decided that this would be better if it were used as a side dish portion with a veggie main dish or salad. 
The ketchup on top or BBQ sauce was a necessity.

Quick and easy weektime dinner. Nothing outstanding, but good meal that all the family enjoy. I cooked the bacon and ground beef in two separate skillets at the same time. Instead of sprinkling the cheese, I mixed it with the sauce until melted.

My husband liked this a lot.  It is a good meal for just the family.  One thing, I salted my pasta and the dish was REALLY salty.  Next time I just wouldn't salt the pasta and let the other ingredients be.  Oh, I used half a can of cheese soup and half of the cheddar cheese as another review suggested.  And I added some chili powder and season salt to the meat.

This was just okay I thought.  I added some garlic powder and seasoning salt...but I think it tasted like Spam casserole, which I don't care for very much.

Very easy to make and very delicious.  I added a little bit of chopped onion and was a bit more generous on the bacon.  Thanks for the recipe!

As others have pointed out, this recipe isn't the most complicated.
That's what makes this one great. 
I made it for the 1st time tonight & my 16 month old daughter loved it and my wife I both liked it a lot. 
I'll make it again & might make my own variations but I know I can always go back to a really good meal that didn't take long to make.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe, although I agree with a lot of people in that it needs some spicing up.  One thing I added was 1/2 can of Campbell's nacho cheese soup.  It made it really creamy and cheesy and I did not have to add that much shredded cheese.

This is a great, uncomplicated dish to make when you're in a hurry and fancy doesn't matter.  My husband really liked it, and didn't even feel the need to add hot sauce!

NO tomato soup NOT a problem you can use tomato sauce and water. Try 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt & 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning in you sause to spice it UP! Mummm....

Bland and dry.  I think adding tomato sauce might help.

Everybody in my house and my neighbors loved this!  I added an extra slice of bacon because I needed to use it up, but it would have been great without it too!

I liked this. It was like a gourmet (and better tasting) Hamburger Helper. Quick and easy, but I think that it needed some more cheese.

My husband and I thought this was o.k. My 6 year old daughter spit it out and asked for something else. I don't think I will make this again.

Great recipe, but it was a little bland. Try adding garlic powder and chili flakes generously, and any other of your favourite spices - it can use the kick. Next time I think I will also add a little more tomato base.

Pretty good for a quick, filling meal.  I've made it several times with various changes and it always comes out well.  It's a good "comfort food" for a cold day and kid-friendly.

Some changes I've made include using tomato sauce, pepper jack cheese, and some spicier seasonings (like red pepper flakes) for a bit of a kick.  I've substituted vegetarian "ground beef" crumbles.  I used rice instead of pasta once, and it wasn't as good.

There was just something missing. I added onions and garlic powder, we even put BBQ sauce and mustard on it, but it was still blah.  It was fairly easy to make, but my husband told me not to make it again.

This dish was so easy to make and is very tasty. My bacon hating son ate this without a fight and even wanted more. I did add some diced onion and garlic and added about a half cup of barbeque sauce with the cheese. Will be making this again and again.

This is a simple, hearty meal, and with the addition of a few spices is really tasty. I threw everything in a casserole dish and baked it, and it really did remind me of a juicy cheeseburger. (I even used tofu 'ground beef', and after dinner, my husband was shocked to realize he had just eaten tofu. Heh heh!)

This was really delicious but i agree that it would be pretty average without the bbq sauce.  I also added some frozen peas to it as a way of making sure my children had their veggies.  They loved it and so did my husband.  Simple and satisfying!

This was quick and easy. I agree with other review, that it is just like Hamburger Helper, only less salty. I used a garlic honey bbq sauce (1/4 cup) and I thought it was a little too sweet, so I added 1 T mustard. I think a spicier bbq sauce would be better. I also cooked my bacon before the hamburg and used about 1 T grease to fry the hamburg in. I am not a fan of Hamburger Helper, so I wasn't crazy about this and kids thought it was alright. I don't think I will make again, I wasn't impressed with this. Sorry.
