As an Italian, and a good Italian cook, I can tell you this is one, nice dish. So many people think that Italian food is heavy with cloying,sweet, red sauce - not so. This is a pasta dish as it should be-fresh, light, delicate and pretty. Grated Romano or Parmesan cheese is considered a real no-no in Italian pasta dishes made with seafood. Loved this!

Excellent flavor! Husband went back for seconds, and said it's a keeper.  Tweaked the recipe a bit by adding equal amount of butter w/olive oil, 3 TBS. dry white wine with the tomatoes, doubled the spinach, and used part mozzarella and fresh shredded parmesan (as that was all I had on hand).

I used dried herbs, canned tomatoes (drained), and 8oz of frozen spinach (thawed & drained). I did not use food processor. I added sliced greek olives, chopped sun-dried tomatoes and subbed low-fat feta cheese for the mozzarella. Only needed half the amount of pasta (I used whole-wheat angel hair). Sprinkled with crushed red peppers. Heavenly! Quartered artichoke hearts might have been good too, maybe next time.

I had to add alot to this recipe to make it good first I used raw shrimp so I sauted it first with onions and garlic and seasoned it with old bay and seafood seasoning, then I removed it from heat and in that same pan with the pan drippings I added fresh spinach and mushrooms and fresh tomatoes along with sundried tomatoes let it saute a little then added the pasta and some red pepper flakes and the shrimp and served it with some fresh grated parm cheese...no leftovers.

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  I would recommend that you do not skimp on any of the ingredients.  I made the mistake of not adding as much of the seasonings and it was bland.  I have also made it without fresh basil and oregano but I would never do it again.  Fresh is imperative to the flavor of this recipe.  I also add at least double the spinach if not more and it still doesn't overwhelm the other ingredients.  Lastly, I like to use freshly shaved parmesan cheese instead of the mozzarella at the end.

Added 2 cups spinach and just 2 tomatoes 'cause that's what i had on hand. As other reviewer said, added a splash of white wine to the sauce. I must say my mom and i were very skeptical about this recipe, but it ended up being a huge success. After mixing the pasta and sauce together, let them sit for a while before serving. Didn't add the cheese.

Yum! "Restaurant quality" according to my hubby! I used a can of diced tomatoes with chiles (we like spicy food) instead of the fresh tomato, used dried herbs and whole wheat thin spaghetti. Used the fresh mozzerella, but I bet it would be great with feta, as well!  Very tasty and pretty healthy, too!

This is very good. I used whole wheat pasta. And, I didn't mix the sauce with the pasta. I was afraid the sauce would run to the bottom of the dish and all we'd have is pasta with some veggies. I added the aromatics but, I didn't run them through the blender. I wanted the veggie pieces to be recognizable. We served the pasta in bowls and spooned the sauce over the pasta. When I plated the pasta and shrimp, I added 4 or 5 cherry tomato halves on top and sprinkled it with Parmasean cheese. We will definitely have this dish again.

Such a nice change for pasta! The sauce is light and clean tasting, rather than heavy and overwhelming. I didn't have fresh oregano and used 1 Tbs. dried instead; worked just fine. Also, I used the frozen 30-40/lb. shrimp and put them into the sauce at the same time I put in the spinach. All came out perfectly cooked and lovely. Hubby says this is a keeper!

I love this recipe considering I'm not really a big fan of spinach. Definitely a keeper!!! I also used butter with olive oil and doubled the spinach the second time I made this.

I really loved this sauce. Some of my family members weren't as wild about this as I was, maybe because of the spinach, but I'm going to go with 5 stars anyway.  After reading other reviews, I decided to skip mixing in the mozzarella to avoid the gloppiness and instead sprinked Parmesan cheese on top.

Very good but the fresh mozzarella just melted into globs.  Next time I'll omit and instead sprinkle fresh grated Parmesean before serving.

We didn't add spinach b/c we didn't have any on hand.  Used Muir Glen Organic Diced Fire Roasted Tomatoes.  Absolutely Excellent!!

This was soooo good. I went to the farm market and got the freshest, ripest tomatoes. Used the food processor for the garlic and onions - I cooked the onion for a looong time so that it was sweet and golden. I let the tomatoes marinate with the basil, olive oil, and lots of crused red pepper. I tried to keep the tomatoes chunky, as they cook down a lot. I will make this over and over in the summer!

Tasty and easy to make.  I skipped the shrimp to make this a meatless dish and added a couple more cloves of garlic.  I didn't use the food processor at all.  I used my garlic press and knife.  I didn't have mozarella so I used ricotta salata.  Used rotini instead of fettucini.  Added in a big pinch of red pepper flakes (aleppo).  Since each ingredient pretty much stands on its own in this recipe, fresh herbs are highly recommended.  I used lemon basil which added a nice lemony flavor to the dish.  A teaspoon or so of grated lemon zest would be a nice addition to this recipe.

changed slightly...substituted pecorino and Parmigiano-Reggiano instead of mozzarella, tossed at the end.  Added a few more garlic cloves, sliced cherry tomatoes instead of med. toms, and added some red pepper flakes for flavor.  Super delish.  Will use a bit more spinach next time.

Delicious, light pasta dish. Per other's suggestions, I added crushed red pepper and white wine. The hubby and I loved it and this will be a keeper!

This is awesome! I didn't change anything but our local grocery store, (HEB), did not have fresh oregano and I had tried to get it for over a week. I finally just used 1 1/2 tblspoons of dried oregano and it turned out great. Also, you should make sure to prep everything before you start cooking. The first time I made this I didn't do that and because I always use fresh shrimp, it wasn't as good because the sauce cooked too long. I spent too much time peeling the shrimp while the sauce cooked. This is absolutely a keeper and don't forget the cheese because it binds the sauce and noodles well. Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic! I made as stated but added fresh mushrooms and some black olives along with white wine. It was sooooo super good. I did not have fresh oregano so I used dried and I used canned tomatoes with basil.

Great recipe.  Perfect proportions.  For my taste, I  left out the cheese, added chopped fresh parsley and crushed red pepper.  We just loved it.

Yum!! This was good and a hit with my boyfriend. He usually doesn't like any pasta without a heavy sauce on it, but he ate all of the leftovers! I added some clams and scallops along with fresh shrimp and took the advise of another review and added butter with the olive oil. It turned out great, it is definitely a keeper.

My rating is based on the changes I made, mainly to reduce the fat which to me was too high for a non-creamy shrimp and pasta dish. I only used a tsp. of olive oil to start the sauté and then added some chicken broth for the additional moisture needed. I added a few large, diced mushrooms to the sauté mix. I used about 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and 2 TBS. of freshly grated Pecorino Romano which was great in the dish.

Very good! Light and tasty. I used tomatoes, oregano and basil from the garden, which was a really good call. I did season the shrimp with a little Old Bay which gave it a little more of a seafood taste. But all together it was great. I was surprised that my husband liked it so much since he usually prefers heavy sauces and tons of cheese. This was a nice, healthy compremise for us.

Easy to prepare - but was missing something. My husband and I tried several different things. Siracha, parmesean, more salt and pepper and it was still lacking. It needed more spinach too. I wanted to like it..

This was tasty.  The best thing is that it tastes like it took more time to prepare than it did.  It needs a little something more but not sure what.

This was delish!  Even my husband (who hates tomatoes, cooked spinach, and shrimp) went back for seconds.  I added a splash of cooking red wine.  I added extra garlic and onions too.  I used canned Italian diced tomatoes and dried herbs...it was just on hand, and it worked just fine!

Very good! Crushed red pepper definitely gives it a tasty kick, and a splash of white wine gives it some more liquid. I threw my shrimp in when I added the spinach to the mixture. Used whole wheat pasta to make it an overall pretty healthy meal. My boyfriend and I loved it. He didn't even know he was eating healthy food until the second helping when he pointed to the spinach and said, "What's this green stuff?" :)

This was great.  I also added a bit more spinach and a bit more oil.  The colours were beautiful and my husband loved it.  I think the next time I might not bother adding the cheese as we could not really taste it.  Instead, I might sprinkle the cheese on each serving.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you!!

This was wonderful!  I made this for a Mother's day meal with my parents and my new in-laws and it was a hit!  The only change I made was that I added some white wine when I added the tomatoes.  This was much more flavorful than I was expected.  The fresh herbs and the onion mixture mixed with the tomatoes was amazing!  I think the wine really added something too.

I was looking for a shrimp dish that I could make into something somewhat healthy.  I made this pretty much as is, but used whole wheat spaghetti and low fat mozzarella.  It was terrific.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic!  My husband and I both loved this recipe.  Added some extra spinach, but didn't have to change anything else.  It's fresh tasting, light, and a visually appealing dish--definitely a keeper!

really good pasta... it tastes like something you should order from an italian restraunt... the tomatos I used seemed really juicey and made my pasta juicey... you could add more noodles if you wanted and make sure you dice the cheese fairly small or use shredded... very good combinations though

This was good but needed a kick.  If I make it again, I'd throw some red pepper flakes in and maybe use some tomato paste/sauce.

Very good recipe!  Restaurant worthy.  My whole family loved it.  it is light and easy to make.  I didn't follow the receipe exactly.  I didn't use fresh tomatoes or fresh herbs...per other reviews I added a can of diced tomatoes and used a generous amount of italian seasoning.  Also I had frozen spinach.  It still turned out fantastic.  I can only imagine the fresh ingrediants would make it much better.

This was very good.  I also added sliced mushrooms because I had some in the fridge.  I also used whole wheat penne because that's what I had and it turned out great.

This was pretty good. I used spaghetti as that was all I had, and doubled the spinach, and also added leftover salmon. I really liked the salmon in there too. I felt like there was too much mozzarella, so I'll probably do 6 oz next time, and add some parmesan to give the flavor a little boost. I'll definitely make this again, and probably add even more spinach. Thanks for a great pasta dish!

This is a great recipe! It is super easy to make and it tastes so fresh... I used a small amount of feta instead of the mozzarella but thought it would have been good even without any cheese...

Excellent but here's what I changed:  I used penne rather than fettuccine....used 1 large can of diced tomatoes (better than fresh)...added some crushed red pepper flakes...cut the pasta back to 6 ounces...and used 6-cheese Italian blend.

I made this after doing an ingredient search for what I had on hand and then adapting this recipe. I sauteed all the vegetables first, (used red and yellow bell peppers, onion, garlic and zucchini) and then added one 15 oz can diced tomatoes and 1/4c chardonnay, simmered for 8-10 min and mixed with cooked pasta. I added red pepper flakes for zip. I omitted the shrimp and served this with chicken cutlets marinated overnight in lemon juice, lots of garlic, dried oregano and fresh basil, then dipped in egg mixture and bread crumbs and browned until cooked through in olive oil. I grated parmesan cheese over everything. It was fabulous! I will definitely make this again.

It was ok.  It lacked flavor.  May want to use a different type or add a cheese such as parmasean or romano.  Sun dried tomatoes may also add some flavor.

Easy and delicious recipe that my entire family enjoyed.  The spinach and fresh tomatoes enhanced the flavor.  I added chopped fresh asparagus while cooking the garlic and it was a nice addition.

I made this last night, last minute, when I realized that I'd defrosted some jumbo shrimp the night before (forgetfulness...ugh) and needed to do something with it right away. I didn't have enough tomatoes - only a couple romas, so I added a can of Ro*Tel. It turned out great! It added a little bit of spiciness that really worked! Also, I added the uncooked shrimp to the pan about two-thirds through the sauté step on the onion/garlic; along with a bit of garlic pepper and salt. I may be one of the last people who don't own a food processor so I sliced the onion super thin with a mandoline and then minced it from there. I also used a whole bag of fresh baby spinach. This is really a good recipe and very, very quick and easy to use. My thanks to Lisa Nichols.

This was a refreshing change from boring spaghetti with meat sauce. It had a true Italian restaurant type pasta dish feel to it. The oregano is a bit overpowering, so if you don't like the taste of a lot of herbs, I'd cut down on it a bit. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used diced canned tomatoes (drained first) - of which I had to use about 4. It cracks me up that it says "15 mins" prep time, when in actuality it took more like 30-40 if you count peeling and cooking the shrimp and chopping everything up. Overall, a great recipe and I would make again. Even made it gluten free with the use of gluten free pasta - didn't miss a thing! Oh, and make sure you season the shrimp with a bit of salt and pepper as it cooks, or it will be tasteless.

very good. I made this like it is, and then the next time, I put garlic and onion in my bullet and chopped it. then cooked it in olive oil, added white wine, shrimp and chopped romas, and ate it over wheat angle hair. Both were very good, thanks for posting.

Oh so delicious!!  I followed other suggestions about adding the red pepper flakes which was fabulous.  I had some chicken spinach feta sausage that needed to be used to I used it instead of the shrimp, grilled and sliced.  That was so good, and I can't wait to try it with shrimp.  I loved the sauce, thank you for sharing!

This was really good...made it on a rainy day--really hit the spot! I did substitute the shrimp for slices of cooked chicken breast, and pureed red peppers and added that into the sauce...YUM!

Great recipe! Looked it up at the last minute, so had to use drained diced canned tomatoes. We also had no mozzarella, so grated fresh parm over each plated serving. Fantastic!

Delicious! I can't wait until my summer garden tomatoes are ready this year. Using fresh herbs are a must. I also added significantly more than 1 cup of fresh spinach leaves. This makes a quick and reasonably healthy meal. I'll be making this all summer long when my tomatoes and herbs are ready!

This was VERY good!  I did a couple things differently though.  I used a whole onion and 4 cloves of garlic.  When I put these in the food processor I also added some crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat.  I cut some grape tomatoes in half and used a can of drained diced tomatoes as it was all I had in the kitchen.  Because of the extra onion, it need a bit more liquid towards the end so i added approx 1/2 c of chicken broth so the pasta had something to soak up.  I only used half the pasta and it was the perfect ratio.  My boyfriend is a police officer and wasn't going to be home until later so I didnt even fix myself a bowl.  I just stood at the stove and had my portion right out of the pan:)

This recipe is amazing! My husband and I really enjoy it more and more every time! I add some pecorino romano cheese into the sauce b4 I mix in the pasta and I leave out the mozzarella bc I found that it doesn't add as much flavor as the pecorino. I also add more spinach than the recipe calls for. Another tip is not to eat it all in the first night! Let it sit overnight and heat it up the next night for leftovers. Even better the next day.

Great recipe and I loved the way the garlic and tomatoes come together.  The only thing I would differently is sear the shrimp by themselves in butter and white wine and then add to the sauce.

A nice change from a heavy red or heavy white sauce, however, there really wasn't any "wow" factor for me or the family.  I used fresh ingredients, with the exception of oregeno, which I had to substitute for dried.
I did add raw shrimp early in the pan with the onion mixture.
After the kids ate theirs' I added some red pepper for a little kick, but still nothing to write home about, especially considering  the amount of work that goes into it.

This was delicious. My entire family enjoyed it very much. My father is an extremely carnivorous eater and is always unhappy that I don't cook any other meat than fish and seafood, and this even pleased him!

I cooked my peeled and deveined shrimp in the pan first with a little olive oil and a lot of crushed red pepper (we like it HOT!)  After it was cooked I removed it from the pan and continued with the recipe.  I also added more like half a 10 oz. bag of spinach and used a 12 oz box of fettucine.  My family ranked this one a "keeper!"

This recipe was amazingly good!  I cannot stress the importance of fresh ingredients here- it makes a lot of difference.  I used 1 1/2 tbsp of dried oregano though since I didn't have fresh ones on hand.  I tripled the spinach and garnished the recipe with more basil.  I used uncooked shrimp which I added right before the spinach.  This was a big hit!  I will definitely make it again. :)

I only had raw shrimp, so I put a little olive oil and butter in pan with garlic slices and simmered for a few minutes; added the shrimp until cooked, then removed from heat.  Added back in when the recipe suggests and thought the whole thing tasted great!  Oh, and I probably increased the amount of fresh herbs and put some basil in the food processor and added some with the tomatoes.

This recipe was quite good. My only gripe is that the tomatoes no longer existed by the time the shrimp were warmed through and cooked.  In the future, I might add the tomatoes, shrimp and spinach much closer in time to one another.

Agree with other reviewers that this recipe needs a few "tweaks" such as the addition of dry white wine and some red pepper.  I used fresh mozzarella, but my family agreed that the feta would have added more flavor.  Worthwhile a second try.

Made this for dinner tonight and thought it was okay. Not great and probably not something we will make again, but edible. I think the sauce was a bit too heavy on the onions and did not have alot of other flavor.

This dish was a great hit with my wife, and she is already asking when I will make it again. I substited frozen spinach (thawed of course) for fresh spinach, and since I was short fresh tomatoes, about half of my tomatoes were sun dried. It was still delicious.

I think there must have been user error on this recipe. It was okay, had an interesting flavor. However, I didn't have fresh basil, so someone told me to use dried. I think that may have been the problem. I did like the spinach and tomato combination, though. I'll try again when I have more fresh ingredients. Thanks!

this recipe was wonderful.  The taste of the tomatos and spinach were amazing.  In the future I would add about 1/4 of the cheese it calls for, add a tomato or two more and add just a bit more spinich.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish.  I did double the spinach as had been mentioned here.  I also blackened my shrimp prior and added them at the same time that I added the tomato/spinach mixture to the fettuccini.  It was delicious!  I will definitely be making agian.

Loved it. Just for personal taste I didn’t use the spinach & I upped the servings which resulted in probably not quite enough sauce but it has great flavor! I’ve always been afraid of making a red sauce & this will be my go to from now on! Great recipe!

Made this tonight with Spinach & Chives linguini, and loved it. I made only 2 servings, but doubled the spinach from the original amount (it cooks down to nothing anyway). We didn't find it quite spicy enough; at the table I added hot pepper flakes and hubby added Sriracha.

This was dish I normally wouldn't  try but it was very good.  I would follow the recipe if your not used to cooking with Shrimp.  Once you kinda get what you like to add flavor to Shrimp you can start tweeking it.  I think substituting the Shrimp with Chicken would work well too!

this was pretty good... i did season my shrimp with some spicy seasoning since there was no spiciness in the pasta already. i also used a different kind of pasta noodle... but i guess that really doesnt matter.

SO DELICIOUS! I doubled the recipe but other than that followed the directions exactly. Me and my boyfriend cooked this for my entire family and they absolutely loved it!

Delicious, healthy and easy, what more could you ask for?  I used whole wheat fettuccine, cut the tomato in half and used dried spices (about 1 tsp.) each as I did not have fresh spices on hand.  It is a little bland but with a few shakes of red pepper it wakes right up!  This is one of my new favorite recipes, so yummy!

Loved it!!!  I change the tomatoes to grape tomatoes and sliced in half and added them instead.  I halfed the oregano because I don't like oregano.  Next time around I will add more spinach.  Enjoy.

This is really good stuff. I did make some changes, however.  Four tomatoes was quite a bit of tomato for us, so I just used 3. I also used 1 tbsp of dry oregano and used frozen spinach.  I read the reviews and I know why some people think its great and others bland.  If you want an authentic recipe, leave as is.  However, for many Americans especially, authentic Italian food can be bland.  Even my husband who is part Italian said it could use some more taste so I sprinkled in some crushed red pepper flakes and added a bit of Cajun seasoning.  If you don't like spicy, add very little and it will just provide flavoring.  I gave it 5/5 stars because I loved both the authentic and the "kicked up" versions.

This is an easy,fast and delicious recipe! I did change a few things by not adding spinach but substitued mushrooms instead b/c I did not have any spinach on hand. I added some sherry cooking wine and a little Creole seasoning for a bit of spice! Enjoy!!!!

I wanted to like this, but I just didn't think it had any flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, but since I felt it was so bland I added shaved pecorino romano half way through - always a good addition.

Wonderful flavor.  This is a real keeper.  I used 16 oz can tomatoes, 2 c. fresh spinach, shredded Mozz, dried herbs, and about 1/2 of the pasta.  Very different from the typical alfredo or olive oil/butter base.  Was amazing!

I wasn't sure about this one. I put mozzarella on this either because the recipe called for it or because it was mentioned, but it didn't taste right. I think parm would have been better. It was ok, just nothing spectacular. Definitely easy and quick.

We don't have a food processor, so we sauteed the onion and garlic and then pureed in the blender. We added 1/2 cup fresh corn (we got that idea from another recipe on the site) and skipped the cheese to save calories. Unique meal, will have it again.

This recipe turned out really well.  I used Al Dente Pasta too which was so good.  It's worth looking at the website.  There are a bunch of different flavors of pasta that you can order online.

By the time my husband and dtg went to Taco Bell and to rent movies I had found this recipe and had it made.  Quick, simple, I had everything on had, did sub frozen spinach for fresh.  Was awesome, even my husband had to eat some after all his tacos.  This is on to keep.

This recipe is very pleasent, but is a bit boring and dry. I will next time use the other reviewers advice and add white wine, butter etc.

This was good but not great.  I will make it again and add to it: probably with red peppers, onion, and either hot peppers or hot sauce.
Overall a good recipe.

This turned out very nicely. All my kitchen stuff is in storage (just moved) so I don't have a Cuisinart, but I chopped up everything and it tasted great. Next time I might add some red pepper flakes to spice things up. Good basic, light-but-tasty recipe.

Very fresh taste!  I doubled the spinach, and used shredded parmesan since that's what I had on hand.  But it was a little on the bland side.  Next time, will kick up the spices.

I haven't written a review for awhile but felt this was very worthy of my recommendation.  Fabulous dish.  Delicious, colorful and easy to make.  I will definitely try this on company.  It was a huge hit with my husband. I didn't have fresh oregano so threw some dried in and it was just fine.  I also doubled up on the spinach leaves.  Try this and I know you'll love it.

Really great, simple, fresh! I used canned diced tomatoes. Seasoned to taste instead of following the recipe to the letter. It made for a nice light summer dinner.

This was delicious and so fresh tasting, very summery.  I had fresh basil and mozzarella but only dry oregano.  I halved the recipe for the two of us and it was perfect! I added butter and a bit of broth at the end, as someone else suggested.

I forgot to add the mozzarella, but it was really good. I also used cherry tomatoes because I had them.  Delicious!

Super easy and quick! Added some lemon juice into the tomatoes and spinach - next time I want to put some white wine in there like others have suggested

This dish is incredible and very easy to make. I've never made a pasta sauce from scratch and the ingredients taste heavenly when blended all together. I left out the spinach. We will be adding this to our line up of dishes.

Great with shrimp, but we also made it by substituting lake trout and it was tasty that way also.

There were some tweaks - like marsala cooking wine & just a bit of chicken broth. Quick and flavorful.  My food processor was not cooperating  so used the dried version of the oregano.

Yes, I did double the spinach!

With a moderate amount of effort, this dish will knock the socks off everyone at the table. Fresh vegetables, herbs, shrimp, and a higher quality mozzarella are recommended as I've made this recipe with many variations. Vegetarian style is great, and the sauce is fairly versatile to incorporate into something else like soup, or a pita dip.

I followed the recipe, except I didn't have fresh oregano so I used dry instead.  There really is no substitute for the flavor and aroma of fresh spices, so I'm sure it would have been much better if I would have used fresh oregano in addition to the fresh basil.  My taste buds are either extremely sophisticated or extremely deficient as it takes a lot to get them to stand up and take notice.  This dish was beautiful and had good consistency, but my taste buds found it to be just average.  My husband, however, loved it :-).

I really don't like changing a recipe the first time I make it, but I didn't have everything, like fresh herbs, so I replaced with 1 T  each of dried oregano and basil.  I also did not have any spinach.  Next time I will add it in.  I did add a little white wine, as I like that in Italian dishes.  This was delicious!!  Going to put this in my regular rotation!!

Loved it!

This is my first time making this recipe and my Mom and I loved it! I made some changes to mine though( because I love spicy food) I added two different types of fresh basil, peppermint and another herb, I used both fresh tomatoes as well as tomato sauce and dried italian seasoning. I substituted fresh spinach for frozen spinach and used six different tyes of cheeses including mozarella. I also love the fact that this pasta dish wasn't really heavy. I will definitely be doing this again.

We made this for the two of us, so reduced the shrimp to 8 oz., but left the other ingredients as written.  To make up for less shrimp, we spiraled a zucchini and added it with the spinach - tasted fresh and delicious!  We also used less mozzarella.  The leftovers were yummy; the shrimp and mozz were gone, but still yummy.  Next time, I'll exchange the mozz for either Parm Reg or Asiago to save on calories.  Thanks for the recipe!

Our whole family enjoyed this.  I did a couple things to tweak it for my taste.  Added zucchini, mushrooms and peppers after the onion mix had cooked a little.  Marinated fresh shrimp in with Old Bay for 3 hours and added it at the end.  Doubled the fresh spinach.   If I had it I would add some artichoke hearts.  We'll make it again for sure.

Really good dish, however I think the cheese was a little odd. Sounded good initially but next time I'd leave it out, (or simply put on top when plating instead of mixing in)
Used 1/2 package frozen spinach and canned tomato instead of fresh.

I made this in April when fresh tomatoes have no taste, so I also added 1 large can of crushed tomatoes. I also added olives, because I love  them and red pepper flakes. I used dried oregano, I didn't use the spinach, my husband HATES it cooked. We loved it and will be making it again and again.

I didn't use a blender and I used raw shrimp, (pre-cooked are sometimes tough) cooking them in the garlic olive oil butter and onion mixture and setting the shrimp aside until ready to mix in with the wilted spinach. I will use feta or parmesan cheese the next time - there will be a next time. And will add more spinach as another reviewer suggested. Another reviewer stated the results are mild and delicate, I agree. The more we are the more we liked it...

I added some pepper flakes and white wine and at the end a little chicken broth to thin out the sauce. We really enjoyed this pasta dish and definitely would make it again. Make sure to use fresh herbs!

Tried it for company. Everyone loved it. So glad I had my fresh tomatoes, basil, and oregano from my garden.

Definitely use the thicker pasta like fettuccine and don't skimp on the seasonings! In fact, I sautéed the shrimp in red pepper flakes and oil to add a little spice instead of buying cooked shrimp and it was very good that way.  Otherwise I made it exactly as it called for  and I will make it again for sure.

Aside from the different pasta I followed the recipe. Although a rather simple dish in appearance, it left me with a number of dirty dishes to wash. The flavor is light considering the heavy seasoning which was a little disappointing. The shrimp was there but brought nothing to the dish and had no flavor given it was pre-cooked and simply mixed in at the end. I thought the mozzarella was out of place and can't say I will ever add that to a pasta dish again. Added some parm and crushed red pepper to my bowl after realizing it was bland for my tastes. Overall this was just not worth the amount of dishes to wash so I won't be making it again. Three stars because it wasn't bad tasting, just not great tasting.

YUM. I haven't reviewed anything in a while but I had to get on and say this was delicious. I actually used canned diced tomatoes with the juice strained out, because I did not have fresh. Also overcooked the pasta but next time I'll have timing down a little better. Also did not bother with the mozzarella. Really good and picky daughter ate it.

Very good. I didn't have any spinach on hand so I used zucchini. I tossed it in before the tomatoes and shrimp. I also used chicken broth for more liquid. But I think dry white wine would give it even more flavor. I sprinkled on parmesan cheese and parsley flakes at the end. I would definitely make this one again!

Fantastic dish. It is light and delicate. The presentation is on point. And the flavor is out of this world. I couldn't have done it better myself. This is the best pasta recipe I have come across in a while. I would rate it 10 stars if I could. Thanks so much for sharing. I have a feeling I'll be doing this at least once a week.

This was delicious! Based off some others reviews I added some white wine with the tomatoes & fresh spinach as well as capers with the initial onion garlic mixture (because I love the taste of capers). Yummy!

My whole family loves this so much that I have to double it so we have leftovers for lunch the next day. I normally just use spaghetti since that's what i have on hand. Shrimp is yummy but expensive so we started using artificial crab meat to replace it. it's sweetness i think goes well in this dish so I always add a little extra. I think scallops would also work well.

Excellent one dish meal -- very filling, and hard to pass up seconds.  I made no substantial changes, other than cooking my own shrimp with a little cajun spice.  I think it would be good with extra spinach too -- and I was concerned it would be too much tomato, but it wasn't.  Whole family enjoyed it.

I followed the recipe as noted above, but I did add mushrooms and roasted red peppers as well.  I think the next time I make it, I will reduce the amount of oregeno as I found 3 tbs to be a bit overwhelming.  But other than that, my guests raved about the dish.  This is a great, delicious & quick meal.  Goes great with a nice glass of wine.

Made this last night for dinner. I never use pre-cooked shrimp, so first I peeled some large shrimp, seasoned them with salt pepper and garlic and cooked them in a small wok until JUST cooked. I find a wok works better for this purpose, as the shrimp are easier to stir than in a regular skillet.  Removed them from the wok and then proceeded with the recipe,adding some red pepper flakes as others had suggested to give it some warmth.  Did not use spinach as I did not have any and no one else likes it.  Put Angel hair (lighter than fettuccine) in large bowls, added a little butter and garlic, stirred, and placed the shrimp mixture on top.  Thought about using the mozzerella, but could not bring myself to do it.  Served with grated Parmesan at the table instead and everyone liked that.  Will probably make gain, but next time up the garlic a little to enhance the flavor.

I cook this recipe at least twice a month. I substituted with canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I also used a blend of Asiago and Parmesan cheese. It's a big hit in my family.

I actually miscalculated and only made double the sauce for quadruple the pasta, so I used a can of crushed tomatoes for the second batch of sauce. That batch was a little more sour than the first, but both were delicious!

Big Hit at my dinner party tonight.  I did follow the recipe combined with the suggestions of the review lizd 79 and sautéd the shrimp in the garlic and onion.  The flavor of the sauce was awesome.  THe fresh basil and oregano, garlic was the key.  I did season the shrimp with seafood seasoning and added some red pepper.  I probably tripled the spinach, just wanted more green.   I find a prep time of 15 minutes is not accurate.  There is lot of chopping and dicing, oregano, basil, onions, tomatoes, cheese, clean spinach and shrimp.  took me much longer than 15 minutes but very worth it.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

A so-so dish. Edible, but in the future I would use little to no cheese as once it was mixed in the pasta it totally over-powered what little flavor there was. DEFINITELY get all of your ingredients ready before hand unless you are a chopping pro ;)

I added jarred pesto mix - about 4 tbsp. - in with the onions and cherry tomatoes.  Also added a few shakes of red pepper flakes & parmesan cheese

This was amazing! The fresh ingredients really made this dish...goes to show you that you don't need a whole lot of ingredients, just a few really good ones! It was a restaurant quality meal at a fraction of the cost. 

FYI- I used the whole onion, skipped the oregano and added italian herbs instead (that's what I had ). I grated the cheese and I felt it was a bit much. You can defintely do without the cheese. Further, I added hot sauce to the tomato mixture as it was simmering and also some chicken boullion (about one tablespoon)...this meal can use the extra salt.

It sounds like a lot of changes, but you'll improvise to your own tastes as you go along. Have fun!

This was an excellent recipe.  I don't like to review something that I have changed considerably, but I used ingredients that I had on hand and it was excellent.  The sauce, which I followed exactly, was very tasty.  My changes were: I used swiss chard instead of spinach (because I had it in my garden); I added Kalamata olives, because I love olives in everything and instead of fettucine, which I didn't have on hand, I used penne. I also added some fresh parsley, which I also have in my herb garden.  I can't wait to make this dish for guests.

Bland but taste improved when added some peri-peri sauce (which brought up to 3 stars). Thanks anyway, Lisa.
