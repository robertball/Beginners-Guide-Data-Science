This is a great simple recipe for quality ground beef (not a lot of fillers). To make a juicy burger I suggest grating the onions for mixing into the meat. Not only does this give you the onion flavor, but it prevents chunks from falling into your grill/fry pan and makes the burgers juicy. For a pound, however I would only use half an onion.

Oh yeah! SO GOOD! My husband and I forgot about onion burgers, and now that the SWEET Vidalia and Walla Walla onions are in the store you have got to try these! He sometimes adds a bit of green bell pepper and worcestershire sauce to the mix.
We have used regular white or yellow onions too, but we use less onion because the flavor is so strong.

Yum!  We were in burger heaven tonight!!  I chopped the onion really fine and followed the recipe from there.  They were GREAT!  I doubled the amount of meat- kept the onions / seasoning the same.  I won't make a burger again without sweet onions!  We had some American cheese, dill pickles, mayo and ketchup on toasted rolls. YUM!  YUM!  YUM!!  Thanks for a keeper!

We love vidalias so these are perfect!  Be sure to chop the onion into small bits so the burgers shape better.

man what a pain it was to get in the onions, just a typical burger i think. It still needed tons of ketchup to taste good to me. nothing special about this recipie, burger is to plain to eat without a dressing imo.

I tripled the recipe, but there was no way I could EVER get three chopped up onions into that meat!!  I think I was able to get about 1.5 in, total.  I agree with Wilemon, more seasonings!  And maybe a bit of liquid... ours turned out a bit dry.

Excellent!!!
I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  They tasted like they were beef but they were not turkey.

I make these but I use a grater and grate the vidalia into the ground beef.  Its easier than trying to chop into small pieces and you get the juices from the onion.

We've made these twice now.  Don't skimp on the onion; it makes the burger.  For a little extra flavor and moisture, we used barbeque sauce mixed in with the meat and basted while grilling, and catalina salad dressing.  Both good.

This recipe is super delicious considering how easy it is to make! I made the 4-serving recipe and added a bit of garlic and a small amount of chopped tomatos to taste. My boyfriend loved it!

I cooked my onions first, and since I have a device to stuff burgers, I stuffed my burger with these onions. I added garlic to the meat, because if you're eating onions you might as well go all in and have garlic too. Thanks for the recipe!

One onion is WAY too much for one pound of ground beef. I tried to mix it all in but still had about 1/4 cup in the mixing bowl that just wouldn't incorporate into the meat. I'd suggest adding half of an onion instead. I also added a couple tablespoons of my favorite steak sauce and felt like the burgers were OK but not terrific. With some tweaking this could be a good base for a burger, but "as is" it is inadequate.

I used about a pound and a half of hamburger, and grated about a half a large onion. These were good. If you like onions, you'll most likely to like it.

Very good and juicy burger.  I made a few changes but rated it as if I hadn't.  I added garlic salt, bbq sauce and shredded cheese in the mixture.  Still very juicy and tasty!

What a moist and delicious burger recipe.  We grated the onion in our food processor, then pressed out the excess onion juice until the minced onion was dry before adding it to the burger mix.  We added a little onion powder and Worchestershire sauce as well.

i was surprised that for so few ingredients, it really had some flavor. they were great. i added some worcestershire and chopped scallions to the meat mix. another trick is to put them on the grill and place a a metal bowl on top to steam...really makes it so moist.
