What a simple, easy, and delicious dessert! I had some buttermilk I had to use up and this was just perfect. For the shortcakes, I froze the butter and grated it which is much easier. After dropping these onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and did an egg wash (one egg well beaten with 1 Tbsp. of water) and then topped it off with the turbinado sugar which provided a nice little crunch. These baked up beautifully and tasted wonderful. I served them with "Easy Whipped Cream" from this site. This recipe is a definite keeper!

Great simple, easy and delicious recipe.  I sliced some of the strawberries ahead of time in order for the juice to form. The only ingredient change I made was to sprinkle with light brown sugar instead of turbinado.  A word of caution, watch the baking time. While the recipe does not require whipped cream, I did add it on the side. Going in my favorite recipe file.  Thanks Emmie4life for sharing your recipe here on Allrecipes.

We really enjoyed this. Cut the recipe in half for 6 servings and it worked out great. Tender, moist shortcakes with a pleasant crunch from the sanding sugar (did not have turbinado sugar). I will watch the baking time a little closer next time. Delicious at 15 minutes but I will pull them at 13 - 14 min when we have these again. I would also suggest making these close to serving time. The leftovers were not nearly as tender the next day. I am always looking for super fast, easy recipes that taste and present like you have spent more time preparing and this is a great example. Looking forward to trying all types of fresh fruit this spring and summer with this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Amazing. This was a perfect way to end a good meal. 
Make sure you use unsalted butter or omit the salt. 
Also if you don't have buttermilk add 1 teaspoon of vinegar to the milk. Let stand for 5 minutes before using. This is a keeper!

very nice biscuit, shortcake recipe. I will not have enough strawberries for the number of biscuits (my own fault) so I added some homemade applesauce to the strawberries to stretch them out a little. No need for extra sugar this way and it is very tasty. I used a large ice cream scoop to scoop these into a mega muffin tin, the butter melted down the sides, collecting in the bottom, causing the whole outside to have a crunchy texture. Very good. I made a second batch subbing 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 plain yogurt for the buttermilk and added some sharp cheese. New Fav biscuit recipe.

Fantastic!  These are light, wonderful shortcake biscuits. The only changes I made to the recipe was to decrease the baking powder to 3 teaspoons and I used white sugar on top of the biscuits because I did not have turbinado sugar.  Just ate one with my strawberries and these are delicious!  A must keep recipe!

I've always had strawberry shortcake made with pound cake, sponge cake or angel food cake - never with this sweet biscuit/scone like "cake."
In addition to the turbinado sugar I gave them a good sprinkle of cinnamon sugar.  Nice recipe.

perfect biscuit recipe....makes them light & airy. don't work the dough too much, drop biscuits are great. the strawberry mash is perfect. loved it all. i didn't use cream to top all of the biscuits, they tasted the same to me either way.

Recipe Group Selection:  19, May '12 ~ Oh my gosh, is this shortcake ever delicious!  I usually make a shortcake similar to this, but not with the buttermilk.  Really liked the texture the buttermilk added.  I cut the recipe down to 3 shortcakes because I did not want leftovers.  I used the heavy cream and course sugar crystals on top as I'm not sure what turbinado sugar is.  It baked up nicely and was a soft and fluffy on the inside and golden brown and crunchy on the outside.  I will make shortcake this way from now on as I usually always have buttermilk on hand.  Really enjoyed this week's Recipe Group pick.

This makes a terrific not so sweet biscuit for the sweet strawberries and the cream.  Delicious!  I like pound cake but prefer this old fashion cake like biscuit.

Recipe Group 5/19/12. The buttermilk gave a normal biscuit some moistness. And added a little more flavor. The turbinado sugar was a great bonus. I enjoyed those bites. Shortcake was done at 15 min to a light brown. I stored shortcake in plastic baggie and they stayed moist and tasted better the 2nd day. Made single dishes one day with chocolate sauce on bottom (yum)and a small platter for 4 the next. Great classic recipe.

I have tried a few variations of shortcake from scratch. My family and I loved these and this will now be our standard recipe. I didn't have the heavy cream or turbinado sugar so I just did a whole milk wash with reg. sugar. These were wonderful! This is our shortcake recipe from now on...no more searching for us.

This is THE BEST shortcake recipe I've ever had! I was impressed with the light, fluffy texture which is amazing because I tend to like the dense shortcakes. This simply melts in your mouth. I baked them on the rack above middle to keep the bottoms of the shortcakes from browning too much. I also liked measuring out the dough as the 1/3c seems to be a perfect portion. I ended up having to add more buttermilk, but that is probably due to climate. I also just brushed with buttermilk since I already had it out. As for the berries, I did blackberry-strawberry since these needed to be eaten soon. I also added some opened champagne to the berries and let sit overnight. It helped give more juice and and incredible flavor. THANKS for the recipe!!!

This is a simple, delicious recipe.  So tender that one slid off the baking sheet coming out of the oven and broke apart on hitting the oven floor and began scorching immediately!  Literally melt in your mouth.  Special treat for my newly retired husband tonight.  YUM...

Very nice taste and texture, though both get progressively less appealing with each day they are leftover, so you definitely want to plan the recipe to make just what you need fresh out of the oven! For the record, I used a 1/3 cup measure when making my biscuits on the pan, to be very exact, and I came out with exactly 10, not 12.

Made this for the *RECIPE GROUP*. I'm not much for shortcake, but this one was one of the best! I loved the crunchy delicious topping created by the heavy cream/turbinado. Sooo delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first attempt at shortcake and these turned out perfect! My family raved about how delicious they were. I made a few changes: didn't have buttermilk so mixed whole milk with 2TBS of vinegar and let it sour for a few mins. I added a tsp of vanilla extract (this is what really made them for me), and added about one extra tablespoon of sugar. They were so good that I made them the next day and added chocolate chips to them. Mmm!!!

Followed recipe, no changes other than the turbinado sugar.  I didn't have it on hand and just used plain granulated, it worked perfectly.  We are huge fans of Cheescake Factory's strawberry shortcake, this is as close as you can get!  It's amazing, we've made it like 5 times since we first made it 4 months ago!

Made this for our 4th of July BBQ.  It was a HUGE hit! I didn't have unsalted butter, so I used regular butter and cut the salt in half and it turned out great.

Very good! This recipe was very easy to follow and super yummy to eat! 
Edit*** I made this for a Valentine's Day treat. The recipe did not disappoint. I did not have buttermilk so I mixed up my own using lemon juice and milk. No heavy whipping cream either so just brushed with a little milk and sprinkled on the sugar. Yummy!!

Recipe Group selection 5/19/12. Who can resist strawberry shortcake?  Personally, I found the biscuit part too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the family didn't.  They did bake up  nice and light and golden brown.  Thanks for sharing, Anne.

I froze the butter and then used the mandolin's julianne attachment to cut it.  2% milk and 1 tsp vinegar as a sub for the buttermilk, and 2% and regular sugar for the topping. I used 2 lbs of strawberries. Yum!

halved the recipe, otherwise did the same, but white sugar sprinkle, not turbinado.
these are the BEST shortcakes i've ever made--and I've been at it for over 40 years. A true keeper and sharer of a recipe! Thank you so much!!

The biscuit is straightforward, easy to make, and well-liked. Not a home run in terms of how unique but a solid hit that gets you all the way to  second-base! Tweaking the filling gets you the home run. ;-)

Very tasty shortcake, didn't have any problems except that the bottoms of the biscuits were overdone but that might just be my oven.

Yes. The entire effort, with homemade whipped cream, took about 20 minutes, including cleanup, and made an incredible dessert.  Follow the recipe verbatim.  If you have a stick blender (immersion blender) you can use that to "cut" the butter into the flour mixture, which saves some time.  So good!

Perfect! I had never made shortcake before and this recipe was easy and the texture/flavor was perfect. I added a little tiny bit of vanilla extract to the dough, but followed the recipe exactly, otherwise.

Only used 1 stick of butter and it was still delicious.  The less handling of the dough, the lighter.

Quick, easy, tender and ever-so-lightly sweetened shortcakes that were a perfect way to use up some ingredients I had in the fridge! I wouldn't skip the cream/sugar on top--it makes them so pretty and I love the crunch from the sugar! I halved the recipe and still ended up with 8 good-sized shortcakes! I'd make this recipe again in a heartbeat. I shared with my sister and she and her hubby enjoyed them just as much!

My husband and I have been having late night muchies from the beginning days.  I came home from work and came across this.  I made 2 and ate them both.  Wheat flour was used and I put cool whip.  MAKE MORE JUICE TO SOAK THE BOTTOM BISCUIT WITH STRAWBERRY JUICE.  So dangerous...

Nothing but great things to say about this recipe. The biscuit kind of shortcake is my preferred type, and this recipe delivers. I halved the recipe for 6 shortcakes and it worked beautifully in my 4-cup food processor. 16 minutes was perfect in my oven. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is my favorite strawberry shortcake recipe. The cream on the top with the sugar really makes it! I wasn't sure what turbinado sugar was, because I'm a cook and not a baker, but I used Sugar in the Raw and it turned out great... Turns out they're the same thing. Lol these biscuits can be used with any number of toppings, such as whipped pumpkin cream cheese, and they are amazing.

As a shortbread this didn't cut it for me. It is to much like a biscuit.  Looking at the ingredients I decided to make it to use as a biscuit, a dessert biscuit.  Next time I will use 3/4 tsp salt because I use salted butter.  As a dessert biscuit, absolutely fabulous. I did not use sugar on the tops.

Looking to use up some strawberries and buttermilk, I came upon this recipe. I halved it since it was just the 3 of us. I didn't have the heavy cream and turbinado sugar for the topping. I just sprinkled regular white sugar. I ended up with 4 shortcakes. I baked for about 18 minutes and checked it. It was still a doughy when I lightly squished it. I baked it another 5 minutes more, watching it every 2 minutes. It was a little bit more crunchy than I wanted it when it was fully cooked. Hoping the strawberry juices would soak into the shortbread to make it less crunchy but didn't have enough juices. After it was all dressed up, it was pretty good. Better than the Bisquick that I normally make. Would make again, except to make it the shortcake flatter so it cooks more evenly.

I was out of Bisquick, so I looked up this highly rated shortcake.  It has a great tender texture because of the butter and buttermilk.  One reviewer said to leave out the salt if you use salted butter and I did.  I wouldn't leave it out next time-- I think it needed it.  Nevertheless, it was yummy!  I rolled the dough out into a square shape, cut the dough into equal sized pieces and placed them close together on the baking sheet-- a lot like you would for scones.  It baked up beautifully in 14 minutes.

This is a very good dessert biscuit. Washing the top with heavy cream is I think better than an egg wash. Then topping with a generous dusting of turbanado made the tops beautifully brown, sweet and crispy. What else could you ask for. These went with sweetened strawberries and sweetened heavy whipping cream flavored with a little cognac. Ooo la la

I made these for my sister and her family.  I used the food prossessor to cut the butter in.  I used a little less than a teaspoon of salt.  I needed more buttermilk.  Our personal preference was not to put cream and sugar on the top.  Everybody loved them.  We made them 3 times in one week!  We did do our own thing with the berries and made whip cream.

lovely recipe. My personal preference is cut out biscuits so I kneaded more flour into them the second time I made them and they turned out perfect. They were also great as drop biscuits, I just prefer the cut outs.

These were delicious!  I just used the biscuit recipe though.  I don't like syrupy strawberries, so I just used plain sliced fresh strawberries instead.  Also, I served this with whipped cream (obviously, without the syrup it would have been too dry otherwise!).  The biscuit part was very good though.  I didn't bother with the cream/sugar on top of the biscuits, but I'm sure it would have been even better with it!

Wonderful!! I did not have buttermilk on hand so I substituted. I did 3 TBS vinegar with milk added to equal 1 cup, let sit 10 min. and voila!, buttermilk.(I use this sub. for anytime I have no buttermilk on hand) They came out so tasty, my in-laws loved them after dinner. I did not alter the ingredients but made my own whipped cream to top with. SO GOOD!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband doesn't like desserts that are too sweet, so I thought this might be a good option.  I made it without brushing the tops of the biscuits before baking, and it turned out great!  I also only made 1/4 of the recipe, because I didn't need 12 biscuits for just the 2 of us.

The texture was perfect!!  The inside was soft, and the outside had a delicious crunch to it.  I paired it with frozen mixed berries, because I didn't want to make a trip to town for fresh strawberries.  The berries in combination with that crunch were just amazing.  Ask my husand... he listended to me rave about it the entire time we were eating. :)

Really great recipe! The ingredient substitutions I made were health conscious ones such as using evaporated cane juice instead of white sugar, organic butter, sea salt, and whole wheat pastry flour. Baking for only 13 minutes was perfect, and freezing and then grating the butter as was suggested by another reviewer worked like a charm!

Very good recipe! My brother-in-law showed up this afternoon for dinner carrying a full flat of strawberries! I popped on AllRecipes.com and chose this recipe! Super easy, quick and most yummy! Thanks for posting this recipe. :)
Oh, and I love the one review that talks about freezing the butter and then grating it into the flour mixture. GREAT TIP!!

Absolutely fantastic! You must try this recipe, it was super quick. My batter turned out a bit dry, so I used 1 1/2 cups buttermilk. I used my food processor to cut in the butter and used frozen strawberries. Got rave reviews at the neighborhood potluck.

Whipped this up tonight and loved it! I didn't have any turbinado sugar or heavy whipping cream but regular sugar and milk worked great. Will definitely make again.

I made only the biscuits as per the recipe directions.  I halved the recipe and packed the batter into a 1/3 cup measure.  It made 6 biscuits.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  My family had always eaten strawberries with angel food cake but I wanted to try the shortcake.  I baked for 15 minutes and it was just a bit too long as they browned a little dark on the bottom and were a little dry.  I served with cut strawberries mixed with blueberries and strawberry whipped cream.  Delish!

Wonderful light bisquit perfect for strawberry shortcake. I'm rating only the shortcake because I did not follow the recipe for the strawberry part (I used alot more sugar, no lemon juice and let them sit overnight to maximize the juice). I did sub out 1/2 c. of regular flour and used white whole wheat flour in its place. I brushed the tops with additional buttermilk to put a gloss on them but did not add the additional sugar. When the shortcakes cooled I sliced them apart, spooned juice and berries on top of bottoms, a dollop of whipped cream and layed the top to the side. Delicious! (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*)

Quick, easy recipe.  Turned out great as a half recipe.  Added blueberries and raspberries to the strawberry mixture.  Served with homemade vanilla whip cream.  Delicious.  Will definitely make again.

This is always a huge hit when I make it. I mash the strawberries slightly after they have been sitting in sugar. Fresh lime juice works well. Thanks to another reviewer, I top with the 
Easy Whipped Cream recipe from this site. Perfection !!

Very good! I used white whole wheat flour, which, with the buttermilk,  gave it a lovely golden color all the way through.

Not sure how everybody else did it but it didn't work for me at all.  I followed measurements and instructions to the T and I got a crumbly mess that would not come together.   It fell out of the 1/3 cup measuring cup into a crumbly heap.  I had to knead it and knead it before I could form any kind of shape with it.

I made this recipe three times this week - it is my new go to dessert. It is simple, quick, and delicious. I added an extra tablespoon of buttermilk in my third batch, and it was my best batch by far. I served sandwich style with fresh whipped cream and strawberries. I think we will be having this often this summer!

I think the recipe is good. I had some strawberry sauce from Chef John's recipe ready in my fridge and decided to prepare these biscuits. As some mentioned, be watchful of the baking time and the temperature. Adjust both as needed depending on your oven and baking sheet. I served it with a bit of vanilla ice cream and it was good. I might make this recipe again but with the original strawberry sauce to compare. If you have some fruit sauce try this recipe for the biscuits just follow the suggestions above and you should be fine.

This recipe is fantastic. I’ve made it about 5 times and received rave reviews from everyone. I’ve slightly modified the recipe and would recommend trying this as well. Add about a palm full of brown sugar and a half of a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. It won’t seem like much but the subtleness of those in this recipe make a really intriguing depth of flavor. Thanks!

These are so good!  Easy to make and pretty forgiving if you don't have all the exact ingredients.  I made buttermilk with whole milk and lemon juice, used mild to brush the tops before baking and used regular sugar for the tops.  Still came out great.  It might be even better with all the "right" ingredients, but was great just the way I made.

I followed the recipe as is with the exception of having to add more butter milk than called for because the dough was dry. They turned out wonderfully, pretty & appetizing and were delicious!

Delicious! The buttermilk biscuits are so light and fluffy! I used vanilla ice cream instead of whipped cream. My daughter told me that these Strawberry Shortcakes taste Better than the one at the Cheesecake Factory! That’s is on heck of a compliment! Will definitely make again and again!

Beautiful, crisp biscuits. They crumbled easily (I like mine broken in a bowl to collect more juice) and had a great flavor. I took them to a ladies meeting at church and everyone raved that they were just like they had growing up; two ladies asked for the recipe!

I didn't use the strawberry part of the recipe, just the shortbread.  It was very good!  I cut the shortbread in half and added whipped cream and sliced strawberries!  Everyone loved it!

These are really good. I only needed six so I cut the recipe in half. It worked great. Baking time was only 14 minutes,  came out perfect. Make sure you use unsalted butter bc the added salt is enough. They are not to dense and not to light / airy. Perfect.

We used unsalted butter but worked the batter/dough with a pastry cutter for a long time.  They were delicate, light and slightly sweet.  Truly the best shortcake!!

The only change I made was to halve the recipe. The shortcake recipe was the best I've had or made in the past. Perfect lightness and crumble. Nice level of sweetness.  I will make this again.

Yes. It tastes like biscuits...just like it is supposed to do. We are not fans of  strawberry shortcakes that use those round spongecake holders or other white cake...those are not shortcakes. This recipe is excellent as written. This will be my go-to from now on.  Andy's, the nearby ice cream shop that makes great strawberry shortcake sundaes, has just lost our business.

These Buttermilk Shortcakes are melt in your mouth delicious! I followed the recipe as written except I did not top shortcakes with heavy cream or turbinado sugar. This recipe will definitely be a regular for other desserts calling for shortcakes or biscuits!!

My family loved these!!  Even a few days later they were good by reheating/crisping them up in the oven.  I made them exactly as written but today I'm going to try them with a none gluten flour as we have numerous GF people coming for a barbecue.

Really easy to make and very tasty. I didn't have unsalted butter or butter milk. So I used regular butter and didn't add the salt. As for the butter milk I mixed a cup of milk with 2 Tbsps of vinegar for 10 minutes. 

Only thing I would change next time is less strawberries. The shortcakes have finished, and I'm left with the strawberry mixture. Would recommend using 5 cups instead of 8.

This makes just the perfect biscuit-style strawberry shortcake.  The only change I made was to use honey instead of sugar by adding the honey to a little bit of warmed up buttermilk.  Using a 1/3 cup measuring cup as a scoop, I only got 10 biscuits, not 12.

This was simple & delicious! I didn't have buttermilk, so added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to a cup of milk & it worked fine.  I will shorten the baking time to 13 minutes next time, but will definitely make these again!

Excellent and easy to make. I was out of buttermilk and substituted regular milk + 1 tsp. vinegar, as advised by another reviewer, and it was still over the moon wonderful. I forgot the cream/sugar topping before baking, and brushed on some milk a few minutes toward the end. Worked fine. When mixing, resist the urge to over-mix and, if in doubt about correct amount of milk, don't be afraid to err on the dry side, adding a touch more as you reach the dough for the last few biscuits at the bottom of the bowl

I've made this recipe several times. I have followed it as given: wonderful! I have used Bob's Red Mill whole wheat flour: wonderful! And I have made it savory by cutting the sugar a bit: again, wonderful!

I was looking for a from scratch recipe to replace Bisquick for strawberry shortcakes.  This matched it perfectly, only better.  The recipe makes 12, so I cut it down by half.  I loved the one reviewers comment to grate the frozen butter.  What a great tip!

I followed the recipe very closely. One caveat: I took one cook's advice and froze the unsalted butter and grated it into the flour. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe faithfully and found it a quick and easy dessert to prepare for a summer weekend during strawberry season. I served the biscuits at a father's day gathering. The family all loved them.

I found these biscuits to be very scone like in texture - soft and fluffy and lightly sweet with the crunchy sugar topping. We really enjoyed this version of strawberry shortcake!

I made this exactly as written, not one change and it was too salty. My butter was unsalted but next time I make it I will omit the salt completely. Other than that it was a tender biscuit that soaked up the strawberry juice very nicely.

Cut the recipe in half - still made 8 biscuits.  Brushed tops of biscuits with buttermilk and sprinkled light brown granulated sugar on them - SO good!!!  Husband and teenagers fighting over them.  Definitely will make these again.

I halved the recipe and it came out perfectly. I also added some vanilla bean paste to the dough and it was delicious! The biscuits turned out very tender, yet crunchy on top due to the sugar. This is my new go-to sweet biscuit recipe.

Delicious, easy and not just for strawberry shortcake! Followed recipe as is, just had to add a generous TBSP more of buttermilk to get my dough to come together well. Forgot heavy cream at the store so just used the left over buttermilk to brush the tops with a generous amount of turbinado and it worked just fine. These are great on their own and would be awesome with some whipped honey butter or homemade preserves.

Just right! This is the biscuit kind of shortcake my grandmother used to make for her strawberries. I like that it's not sugary, so the strawberries are the real "star of the show" here. Really soaks up the juices. Yum!

AMAZING!!! This is a delicious recipe.  The biscuits are to die for.  It's such a great recipe that I was able to make it dairy free with a few tweaks and it was still absolutely delicious!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is a family favorite!

The consistency was perfect with these.  I only wish I had cut the salt in half.  I used unsalted butter and still found the 1 1/2 teaspoons to be a little bit much.  That said, my husband loved them and did not think there was too much salt.

Made 1/2 of the recipe to yield 6 shortcakes for the 2 of us.  I, too, have always used the Betty Crocker cookbook recipe.  I'm glad I found this one because I think it's just a bit better overall.  I didn't have turbinado sugar, so I used regular sugar.  Made my strawberries a day before so there would be a lot of juice.  Summer with every bite!

This seriously is the BEST strawberry shortcake recipe that we have ever tried! My family raved and raved- and we'd tried many, many of these over the years. Use hand made whipped cream for a stellar finish! :) Thank you so much for sharing this one!

I made a few changes your doctor would frown on to create a more rich, moist, and slightly sweeter shortcake you'll love with or without a topping. 

Until today, my family and I thought the 1953 Better Homes & Gardens recipe (modified my way, of course) was best. To avoid turning into my grandmother, ("change is bad!"), I tried this one today. My old shortcake recipe seems like hardtack now so I threw it in the recycle bin. 

Changes made for this:  reduced baking soda to 3 teaspoons and didn't add salt because I used salted butter. While stirring in buttermilk, I added two eggs from my own chickens (even if you drive 100's of miles to buy farm eggs, you'll thank me), increased butter and  sugar to 1 cup, and added 2 tsps. vanilla.

This is hands-down the best shortcake recipe (with or without adapting), which further supports my conviction that allrecipes is the only place to go for recipes.  Thank you!

I had buttermilk leftover from a cake I made a week ago and since I had strawberries and blueberries I needed to use, I found this recipe.  ( I did an Allrecipes search using the words "buttermilk" and "flour").
I usually make biscuits or scones for my strawberry shortcake but THIS recipe is amazing!  All that butter and buttermilk made the most flavorful, moist and delicious sweet biscuits I've ever tasted. I just made the biscuit recipe as stated, left off the topping and didn't add sugar to the berries.  Fantastic!

Perfect biscuit-y shortbread recipe! I'm definitely a food processor person for cutting in, but do pour it into a bowl before you add your buttermilk, as the dough ends up being very sticky. You'd leave a ton behind in the processor bowl/blade. I make 8-9 big shortbreads, and keep the baking time at 15-16 mins max (even less if you actually make 12). Make only what you'll eat same day. The leftovers are both tougher and the delicious buttery edges go all soft.

Oh, my!!  This turned out to be one of the best desserts I have ever made!  And I bake a lot!!  I read a few of the reviews, and borrowed tips from a couple of them.  I didn't have unsalted butter, only stick margarine,so.....I used this with complete success and left the salt out of the recipe.  Someone also suggested freezing the butter and shred it.  Worked nicely, really is easier than a pastry blender.  I also swapped out the buttermilk with plain yogurt and sour cream, using half of each to make the right amount.  That sounds confusing, so...for example if your recipe calls for 2/3 cup of buttermilk, use 1/3 cup plain yogurt, and 1/3 cup of sour cream.  I also added approx. 3 TBS whipping cream.  I also didn't have the specialty sugar, so used granulated instead, brushing the biscuits with whipping cream and sprinkling the sugar.  Placed dough in 1/3 cup measuring cup, to shape the biscuits.  I baked these for the full 15 minutes, the biscuits were tender, slightly sweet, and perfect with the strawberries, but as an added taste treat, I halved fresh blueberries and added them to the sliced strawberries, then sugared them and added lemon juice.  Heavenly!!!

I liked it but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  I love the bisquick shortcake but I am trying to get away from prepared foods and this one sounded like it might come close.  It does have good flavor just a different texture than what I was hoping for but that just might be it coming from scratch.  
This is my shortcake recipe until I find something I like better!

Great recipe. I added about 1/4 cup more buttermilk and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and regular white sugar instead of turb sugar. Turned out great!

It was really good. Next time I'll cut the baking powder back to 2 Tsp. I could taste it a little. Other than that, this is my new favorite recipe for strawberry shortcake! Yum!

These were excellent!  Moist with a crunchy top.  My Mom is eating them plain!  Hint:  Make a double batch.

Biscuits are delicious! We made with blackberries we had just picked. They were a mouthful of delight!

Made for Recipe Group 5-21.  I cut the recipe in half and followed the directions with the exception of the turbinado sugar ( used plain sugar ) for 3 of them.  Wonderful taste we all loved them.  The rating is based on that.  The other three, I used some chopped fresh peaches and sprinkled the top with cinnamon/sugar.  Equally as good.  Thank you for sharing.
