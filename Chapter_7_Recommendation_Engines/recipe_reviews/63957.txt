This is the first time I've ever made flan from scratch and it tastes exactly like the first time I had it at a restaurant! One hint... do NOT stir the sugar when it's caramelizing (sp?). It will be VERY clumpy! Make sure the pan you're baking it in is already in the hot water before putting ANYTHING into the dish.

This flan came out PERFECT!  The only alteration I made was increasing the sugar to 1 cup.

[As a side note to those of you who have never made caramel before:  You should only stir the sugar occasionally.  Constantly stirring will cause the sugar to crystalize.]

The sauce was  BITTER!  I was  so  embarrased serving  this  awful mess. If  you do  try  this, make  sure  to  not let  the  sugar get very brown at  all.....the  recipe  directions should have  been  more specific on  the  carmelizing  step, IMO.

I have made this twice.  The second time I added 1/2 pkg of cream cheese and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours on high in the crock pot.  After letting it chill overnight in the fridge I turned it out on a platter and it was beautiful!!!  I served it to my extended family.  It was a big hit.

This is a wonderful recipe that I have made several times in the last couple of months. My Dad and my boyfriend are both flan lovers, and both think this is a great recipe. Whenever I have dinner with my parents, I take two flans to their house, one for dessert and one just for Dad! I did try increasing the sugar to one cup, and the caramel stuck to the pan, so I will probably stick with the 3/4 cup. Thank you for the tip about not stirring the sugar. I was dying to stir it the first time, but didn't. My second attempt, I stirred it, and it got icky.

This was a first attempt and it turned out fabulous. I took the advice of not stirring to carmelize and had no problems. I used a small pyrex bowl and set it in a large oven safe bowl so that the water completely covered the custard bowl to bake. Not quite as firm as the restaraunt but he flavor was just right.

This is the best flan ever and so easy to make! I made it last night; my husband told me that its taste better than the restaurant a lot; and he hog the whole plate. He also suggested that next time I should cook the caramel sugar a little bit longer, which will give a slightly bitter taste to enhance the sweetness of the flan. Thanks.

This recipe was great, and very simple.  It's very good traditional flan.  I baked them in individual dishes instead of the 9 inch round, and it made about 8 ramekins.  I needed about 1/4 cup extra sugar to carmelize in order to make all 8.  Because they were in the small dishes the cooking time was cut by about 15 min.  It was very good with only 2-3 hours in the refrigerator, but next day was much better.  Next time I will probably add a couple more eggs, because I like it just a little creamier.  I will definitely make this recipe many more times. :)

First of all, I threw out the first batch of sugar as I stirred it. Secondly, according to the description, serve warm, I flipped it out of the dish before it had completely cooled and it fell apart. I guess that was my fault. I should have chilled it overnight so where does the "serve warm" come in. I used 1 cup of sugar as someone suggested. I might go back to the 3/4 cup if I make it again. I thought it tasted pretty good. My sugar got to the amber colored stage, maybe a little bitter, but since it was so sweet, I guess it was ok that way. I will try it again but will chill it the next time. My husand said on a scale of 1-10, he'd give it a five. I would try it again but would be more careful.

Great for being so fast to make. I think the hardest part is making the Carmel. I followed everyone's suggestions to not stir it. It's funny how hard that can be. The only thing was I was hoping it would be a little more creamy. I would DEFINATELY make this again. I would think that it can only get better with practice.

I've never really had flan enough to know if I made this recipe right. It was very...wet. And I let it in for about another 20 minutes because it still wasn't done when the time went up. The flavor was very good, but the texture was not. Definitely a chef error though, I'm sure.

This recipe had great flavor and was exactly like Ive had at restaurants.  I did have a problem with part of the flan sticking when I went to flip it onto the serving dish.  I will try a differnt pan next time (might try glass) and see if I have better luck.

I must not have done this right, but it was not good. I followed the recipe exactly, but the caramel was really runny and liquidy. It never set, and I baked for about 90 minutes! The taste wasn't too bad, a little too eggy for me. The texture was terrible, though! Will not make again!

After serving a spicy mexican-style dinner, this was the perfect, simple, creamy dessert.  The only tough part is browning the sugar, but definitely worth the effort.  My picky teenager requested the flan again right away.

I felt so hesitant to make this but I am SO GLAD. USE MILK INSTEAD OF WATER THOUGH! Creamier and more flavor! I did mess up on the caramel part several times until I realized that you have to stir it (unlike others have said) or else it doesn't work. Also, if it dries fast and starts to crack that's normal don't worry it will turn into liquid again when baked. Also, I used 1 cup of sugar. I had to bake mine for longer. My parents were super impressed and said it was just like they'd had at restaurants. My mom said it was the "BEST DESSERT EVER!". I had never had flan before so I don't know how to compare but I love custard so I decided to try it. I really like this and will probably make it a lot and it's so easy! This is great stuff! It seems so fancy and impressive yet it's easier than chocolate chip cookies.

I made this this morning for Beltine. It is so good. It turned out the way it should have. I followed the recipe to the T. I did follow the advice of another and did not stir the sugar. While sugar was cooking I put the rest of the ingredients in my blender and mixed it that way after the sugar finshed and was in my deep dish pie plate. I will be making this often.

Creme caramel has always been my favorite dessert, and this is a lovely, simple version of it!  My man said it was the best dessert that I make (and I make a lot!) and that he'd request it as the dessert to his last meal if he were on death-row, haha.  

Tip 1: To prevent a hardened mass of sugar, add 1/2 teaspoon of lime juice, 1/2 teaspoon of water, and 1/2 teaspoon of light corn syrup (Alton Brown says so!).  
Tip 2: Rather than stir, swirl the pan gently as the sugar turns amber.  Resist the temptation to remove the pan too quickly because the only thing worse than burnt caramel is that sickly, not-quite-there caramel that is the hallmark of the chicken in the kitchen!  I mean, come on, if you accidentally go too long, you'll smell it (which SHOULD prevent you from actually using it and serving it like another commenter on here).  And you can simply fill the pot with hot water, wash it out and start again.  
Tip 3: For the "Bain Marie" or water bath, line a roasting pan with a dish cloth.  Place the flan on top, place in the oven, and then pour piping hot water half way up the sides of the flan dish.
Tip 4: My flans used to turn out "bubbly" for lack of a better word.  I have since discovered that I was overcooking them.  It's scary to remove it from the oven when it still seems so jiggly, but trust me, it'll be okay.  Insert a nice near the center...if it comes out clean, it's fine, no matter how "wet" it looks.  Chill for 4 hours or more for best results.
