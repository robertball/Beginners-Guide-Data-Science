This was simply OK, but doesn't measure up to what I consider traditional German potato salad which has much more of a vinegar-y flavor.  If I were to make again, I'd use bolder apple cider vinegar instead of the milder white, but I think I'll stick with my favorite recipe.

This was a lighter take on the original version that I've grown up on and now make. (I'm half German) It was easy to follow and was tasty too!!

This was ok, though I halved the potatoes because even my smallish potatoes would have been too much for the dressing.  Everyone ate it but no one would have requested it again.

Very good and super easy to make too! I did cut back the recipe, so I made adjustments accordingly. I really liked that this was a healthier version of the traditional German Potato Salad with out cutting out all the flavor (I used real bacon bits in place of fresh cooked bacon to cut down on the fat). After mixing, I seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
