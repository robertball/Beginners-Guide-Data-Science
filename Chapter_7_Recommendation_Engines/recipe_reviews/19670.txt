As the recipe is written, this is a good sauce. I did do a few things to doctor my version of the sauce which I think gave it more body and flavor. I used the recipe with these substitutions: 1/4 C of brown sugar and 1/2 C of white sugar instead of 3/4 C white sugar, 1/4 C of pineapple juice instead of water, 1/4 C of ketchup instead of the 1 tablespoon (trust me on this!), and I used 2 Tablespoons of flour dissolved into a little water. I added the flour/water mixture to the boiling (on low heat) mix of the other items. I thought these substitutions brought more body, flavor, and color.

This recipe was quite good.  I was looking for something fast to serve with leftover takeout Chinese food as we had no more S/S packets.
You will shorten cooking time considerably if you combine all ingredients *except* cornstarch, let come to a boil, spoon out about a 1/4 cup of the sauce into your measuring cup, mix in the cornstarch with it and then slowly add while mixing to the remainder of sauce in pan.  It will take only 5-6 minutes to cook and it will thicken immediately.

I make this all the time and have passed the recipe around to many.  I have followed all the suggestions left by others at different times and no matter what I have done to this recipe, it turns out great!  We put chicken in it, or ground beef, or meatballs and serve it over rice.  I have added veggies also.  You can't go wrong.  It is wonderful!

This was okay but even with my modifications, still needs some work to perfect.  Per previous reviews regards the excessiveness of the soy sauce, I reduced the amt to 2 TBLS but next time I'll reduce down to 1. I also added 1 TBLS of honey.  Next time, I also reduce the vinegar to 1/8 cup and add 1/4 cup pineapple juice.  I'm hoping this might taste closer to the sweet&sour sauces I am accustomed to.

Thank you Linda!  I have been searching hi and low for a s-n-s sauce that tastes much like something you would find in a chinese restaurant.
perfect balance of sweet with sour.  served this great sauce (that you can make as thick or thin as you like) over stir fried chicken and veggies on thin spaghetti.  Tasted really close to Chicken Lo Mein!!!

a great recipe as listed - almost.  Really did need that little tweak of pineapple juice instead of water though 1/4 cup of ketchup instead of the 1 tbsp, and when I divided the white sugar into half white and half brown, it really added the flavour to make it an amazing 5 star!  If you need a recipe for company NOW and don't want to risk trying something that may not be perfect, make the changes listed above (as suggested by others) and I promise you wont go wrong!

I made this on a night that I tried to make my Grandmom's fried chicken fingers and ended up messing them up and they looked like the Chinese sweet & sour chiken strips...so I grabbed this in a matter of 2 minutes and turned them into the Chinese sweet & sour chicken. Anyway, I really liked this!! I thought it was fabulous and tasted just like the hot-pink kind from the Chinese take-outs.

OK, based on alllllll the other reviews, here's what I did:  replaced cider for the white vinegar, used 1/2 c. brown sugar & 1/4 c. white, less than 1/8 c. soy sauce, 1/3 c. water and about 1/2 c. pineapple juice.  WONderful!  I also added the cornstarch after the other ingredients, dissolved into a few tbsns. of sauce, plus added pineapple and green pepper chunks.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to add some carrots!  Thanks for all the tips-

It always amazes me, when I see hundreds of reviews, that have been "tweeked" "added to" "subtracted from" and/or "substituted with". This is not a review people, it is using the information you were given, and then sharing your own recipe. I gave this recipe 5 STARS, mainly because I cook/stir fry a lot of Asian recipes, couldn't find my recipe for the sauce I use in my sweet and sour chicken, and needed a quick replacement. This recipe was delicious, just the way it was offered.  Just Sayin'

(Maraschino cherry juice is the key!) I found this to be a good basic sweet and sour recipe.  However I do not care for the ketchup element as it seriously taints the flavor. After a bit more experimentation, and some internet research I have found that the trick to making perfect sweet and sour sauce is to use maraschino cherry juice.

Quick and simple recipe!  I found that it took a while to thicken.  We didn't use quite as much soy sauce and found the sugar added enough sweetness.  Really nice to have a recipe using every day ingredients to make something special.

Fantastic traditional sweet & sour flavor.  I decreased soy sauce to 1/8 cup and added 1/4 cup pineapple juice.  It's a darker colored sauce than the electric-apricot-colored sauces you buy in the store.  Great dip for chicken fingers!

My husband won't touch the fluorescent red sweet & sour sauces that are so commonly found. I followed this recipe exactly and we both loved it. Next time I might add a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes to turn it into a spicier version. Thanks for this great sauce!

Wow, this recipe has way to much soy sauce!  (I served it with egg rolls)  However, if you only put a couple of dashes and then one drop of red food coloring, it looks & taste just like the kind you get from the restaurant.

This recipe required too many modifications to qualify for 4 or 5 stars, IMHO. In reading the other reviews, I have to agree that  it needed less soy sauce, more ketchup, pineapple juice, no water, and half bro and half white sugar. Sorry, I won't be making this again.

great recipie, pretty simple and flexible. i omitted the soy sauce and replaced it with more ketchup instead. i have also used flour instead of cornstarch as a thickener several times, and it has worked out fine. this sauce works great with chicken or pork, one of my favorites has been with cubed pork, over rice, with some crisply stir-fryed red & green pepper, mushroom, and bean sprouts.

I really liked this sauce, a nice balance of sweet and sour. I can understand why others were frustrated with measurements, however I think that if start with less sugar/soy sauce/vinegar, you can add more to taste as you go. I kept the same recipe, except reduced the soya sauce to 2 1/2 tbsp since I don't like too much salt in sauces. 

When tasting the sauce, I thought it was a bit too vinegary, but didn't adjust it and when I added it to the stir fry, it tasted great with everything.

I thought this had too much soy sauce but with a few modifications it was quite good.  I used with the breaded chicken strips (recipe from this site).

This sauce tastes just like the sauce in Chinese restaraunts!  It's amazingly easy and it was a big hit when I served with with spring rolls.  Nobody knew it was homemade until I told them!

This was a good sauce--not quite your ordinary sweet and sour, but good none the less.  I did substitute 1/4 cup of white sugar for brown, and I had no vineger on hand so I had to use lemon juice instead.  I also cut the soy sauce down to 1 tablespoon.  But the sauce turned out really well, and I served it with chicken last night.  Thanx!

I really like the taste, however I do not add the soy sauce.  Also, I increase the ketchp to 2 tablespoons (vice 1), and decrease the corn starch to 1 tablespoon (vice 2).

I think the recipe calls for too much soy sauce. I was disappointed with this sweet and sour sauce, which I had made for my homemade eggrolls.
Unfortunately it was too overbearing.

This was an amazing recipe!  I made it totally last minute to go with meatballs for a party, and people were RAVING!!  I will definitely make it again.  Didn't have corn starch, so I used a little extra flour and it was still great!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was disappointed in this recipe, the soy sauce seemed to overpower the sauce..I substituted pineapple juice for the water and soy sauce and was much happier with the results

Awesome recipe! Tastes much better than store-bought sauce... and much better than most restaurants in town. Very easy, quick, and I love that everything in it is a staple in my house!

I made mine with brown sugar instead of white, and apple cider vinegar instead of white. If I have a can of pineapples, I use the juice instead of water and it comes out delish!

Needed a quick sauce to go with meatballs in the slow cooker, and I happened to have all of the ingredients for this one so I gave it a whirl... very glad I did! The house smelled amazing the whole time they were cooking and it tasted just like, well, sweet and sour sauce! Thanks for sharing this recipe :D

This is a great sauce.  I did add a little more sugar at the end, I like my sweet and sour sauce more sweet.  And I followed a reviewers advice to do flour/water instead of cornstarch.  Worked perfectly!  And I did the 1/4 cup ketchup.  The only thing I didn't do was the pineapple juice cause that is currently chilling in the fridge for my punch tonight!  But it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is an excellent sauce for egg rolls. I have made a couple of times now. I use 2/3 cup sugar instead 3/4 cup and 1 1/2 tablespoon corn starch instead 2 tablespoon. Try this: Mix everything till the sugar is dissolved. Than pour in to a ice cube tray and freeze. After they are frozen place in a freezer bag. Place 1 or 2 frozen cubes in a microwave safe bowl and cook for about 90 seconds  stirring every 30 seconds until thick.

This is a great and easy recipe.  I use it all the time with meatballs and always get positive comments on it.  I find the original portion too small, though, so I usually quadruple it.  It even stores well in the fridge for the next day - don't worry if it looks like jelly, it'll smooth out once you warm it up again.

very good!  I am trying to get a recipe as good as our fast food chinese here in town, and cannot find one that tastes like it, but this is the next best thing.
Update:  I made this again tonight, and did a few substitutions:  1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup ketchup, and a couple of drops red food coloring.  the only reason i did the food coloring was because my kids are used to the bright red sauce at our chinese rest., and they didn't care for the brown color, so after adding the food coloring, the gobbled it up!!  Excellent recipe

I was "taken in" by the 5 star rating.  This was awful!  If you look at the reviews almost all of them make changes in the original recipe and the changes are varied.  Use brown sugar or some brown sugar, use pineapple juice instead of water, use less soy sauce, use more ketchup.  My advice would be to not "tinker" with this recipe.  Compare several sweet and sour recipes and see if you can find a general consenus. Then try one that seems to agree with several others.  This is not a "keeper"!

This recipe was pretty good.  The soy sauce was a little overpowering to me so next time I will probably cut down on the amount, but it tasted great with chicken.

Excellent sweet and sour sauce, especially for those who like lots of soy sauce.  Just the right combination of sweet and more subtle sour.

Well, I guess it would be ok if there were not so many modifications. I had to change almost everything, amt of soya sauce, sugar, ketchup... I used brown sugar instead. The color wasnt that great either. With sweet and sour, you kind of expect red. I used it for meat balls. They were good, but like I said, this recipe was just kind of a guide line, everything was changed. Sorry Linda

I found this very easy and the flavor was perfect.  I used it in a stir fry recipe and it was just the right amount of sweet and sour.  This will be my sweet and sour sauce from now on.

This was very good. It wasn't the pineappley green peppery flavor I am used to getting so it took a couple of bites to not expect that flavor, but once I got past that it was good. My husband liked this too and went back for more sauce. I will use this again. Thanks!

My husband loves this sauce!  We no longer buy sweet and sour sauce from the store.  Keeps well for a long time in fridge.  just need to reheat it before serving since it tends to gel up in the fridge.

Wonderful!  I only made minor changes to the recipe as suggested by previous reviews --- I used 1/2 cup white sugar plus 1/4 cup brown sugar, increased the ketchup to 1/4 cup, and decreased the soy sauce to 2 Tbs.   I mixed all ingredients together and then poured over stir-fried chicken/carrots/onion/green pepper, and simmered for about 5 minutes, then added fresh cubed pineapple.  Delicious!

I thought this had the perfect sweet to sour mix (although I used rice wine vinegar).  I used about 3 tablespoons of cornstarch and the consistancy was exactly what I needed for dipping my lumpia in :)  Thank you for this great recipe, I won't be buying those jars of red goopy stuff that just never has tasted right.

Excellent!! I'm very fussy about my sweet and sour sauce, and this one is great.  This has become a favorite for when we chicken and steaks "bites"  - thank for sharing!

This recipe was picked because I had all of the ingredients in the pantry, it had a relatively high number of previous raters giving it 4s and 5s, and I had about 10 minutes to throw together an "asian sauce"  (right about what this sauce sounded like it would require).  I did make some of the recommended changes from previous raters  - I changed the sugar to 1/2 c, added 1/4 c brown sugar, substituted pineapple juice in place of water, mixed it with the ketchup so the ketchup would dissolve, and threw in some diced pineapple at the end.  For the whopping 5 minute prep time and 5ish minute cook time, this sauce was amazingly good.  It thickened up nicely and was the perfect complement to the food.  Definitely earned all 5 of those stars.

I followed the advice of other reviewers, and used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup ketchup.  I also used the juice from one can of pineapple chunks.  Once thickened, I added the pineapple chunks and chicken seitan from this site, and WOW!  I can honestly say that this is one of the BEST recipes I have tried from this site (and I have tried a lot).

I use this recipe all the time.  My husband loves it and my children don't complain when we have stir fry.  It is very easy to make and I am sure we will never buy sweet and sour sauce again.

This was basically very good and easy.  I had everything on hand to make it.  However, I too, thought the soy sauce was just a little overpowering, so next time I'll cut back a little on that.  I also added some pineapple juice, and it tasted great.  I'll make this again.

Thank you!

I made this for dinenr last night and served it over vegetarian meatballs and white rice. It was quick ,e4asy, and very tasty.  The ocnsistency came out just right, and it was sweet but stil ltangy at the same time. I used cider vinegar, but then added some regular vinegar to tone down the sweetness a little. This was very good. I'm keeping this recipe!

This was a very good sauce. It was very different from the sauce served at Chinese restaurants near me. Next time, I think I will try some of the substitutions I see in the ratings of others.

I thought this turned out perfect! I used a little less soy, and twice as much ketchup. I also added a tablespoon of honey. This sweet and sour sauce was delicious :)

Excellent, excellent, excellent.

It was quick and simple to prepare, and I used it as a sauce over fried tofu with sautéed bell peppers and onions. I prepared it as is, and I just added cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper flake to add some heat. I'll definitely make this sauce again. :)

A+!

A good basic sauce recipe.  I used it as a 'foundation' for the additional ingredients I added to spice it up a bit. I added a half cup diced pineapple, with juice, 1/4 cup diced green pepper, 2 T diced jalapeno peppers, about 2 TBS extra vinegar and 1/2 cup extra water (to offset the sweetness of the pineapple), and freshly ground black pepper to taste. It turned out great and the family loved it! :)

Very vinegar-y.  Not what I expected.  I might use this for meatballs, not as a dipper for egg rolls.  I guess I was going for more of a duck sauce.

Update:  I tried and loved Sweet and Sour Dipping Sauce off this site.  That recipe was more of what I was originally looking for when trying this recipe.

This is super easy and I usually have these things on hand. Other versions have pineapple juice added, which is lovely, but I usually don't have it on hand. I typically use a bit more ketchup than this recipe calls for, and prefer it a bit thicker. But still, a great basic recipe!

Excellent.  I had taken chicken drumsticks out for supper but didn't know what I wanted to do with them.  I didn't feel like cooking and came across your sauce - it was perfect for our chicken.  I made it exactly as posted and it was fantastic.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

yummy! (I did make some changes though!) omit white sugar, used 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, increase catsup to 2 TBS, substitute 2/3 cup of water with 2/3 cup of juice from a large can of sliced pineapple....then i added 1/4 tsp ground cumin, 1/8 tsp white pepper, and 1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper.  In a little olive oil I sautéed 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1 clove chopped garlic, and 1 tsp grated fresh ginger.   You could stop there if you were just making the sauce, but I was having sweet n sour meatballs, soooooo....next I threw some pre-made meatballs into the onion/garlic/ginger mix, dumped the sauce over, added some freshly chopped chopped parsley and 5 or 6 rings of the pineapple slices cut into chunks.    Excellent recipe NAG_CA!!!! thank you

Decided to make sweet and sour pork for supper while at a friends home and needed a good recipe.  This sounded so much like the one I use at home so I chose it.  The results were empty platters all around!  I learned from our Chinese Chef neighbor when we lived in London to dip pieces of pork from cornstarch to egg wash to cornstarch (not flour) and fry three times before putting it into the sauce and vegetables...makes a big difference in pork!  Stays crunchy in the sauce even when reheated.

I just now made this to go with crab rangoons and it is great.  I followed the ingredient list perfectly, but based on the initial flavor, I added one additional tbsp of ketchup, and two more tbsp of vinegar.  Thanks for a great recipe.

A nice easy recipe with ingredients you always have on hand. I wisked in 2 tablespoons of apricot jam into the hot, thickened sauce for some texture.

This is sooooo  easy and it is tasty.  The only thing I did different to it was I only used 1/2 cup of vinegar and added a teaspoon of orange extract.  It gave it that fruity flavor that sweet and sour sauce should have.  I found that the 3/4 cup of vinegar was too much and that the vinegar dominated the taste.  Otherwise fantastic recipe.

I am a caterer and I needed a Sweet and Sour Sauce for a meatball recipe.  I always make this sauce and let it sit for a few hours before I use it.  It is tasty, the right consistency and perfect!

I have been making chinese for a while and this recipe was very disappointing.  There is way too much soy sauce!  I didn't have time to try it again, but you should only need about 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, not a whole 1/4 cup.  Anyway, I am  sure this is a good recipe if you modify it, but I won't be making it again.

This was fabulous!!!! I was looking for a sweet and sour sauce recipe and now my search is over!. I only used half of the soya sauce and I added more ketchup (my husband doesn't like soya). Next time I will try it with brown sugar instead of white. I also added some pineapple chunks and some of the juice. I used it to make sweet and sour pork, I can't wait to try it with meatballs. Yummy, can't wait for my lunch leftovers!!!

I took the advice from other reviewers and added pineapple juice instead of water, and used half brown sugar/half white.  I also added a can of pineapple (cut in chunks) which gave the sauce a really great flavor!  The texture was perfect, and it tasted great with chicken and rice.

Not bad, I agree about what someone said about the soy overpowering the sauce. Perhaps I'll try using less and adding some pineapple juice as someone suggested. But pretty good overall.

Eh, it's an ok recipe;  nothing to rave over. I made this exactly as called for and, it was simply made. I think it has too much of a soy taste and not enough sweet taste. It tastes nothing like the sweet and sour sauce at Chinese restaurants.

The sauce was okay... I made it with brown sugar instead and added extra vinegar and ketchup. It really was blah! But I didn't mind eating it with meatballs and rice. I won't be making this again!

This makes a good standard sweet & sour sauce. We used it on chicken and broccoli over rice and it was quite delicious. We will try it next time with half and half water to vinegar to make it a little more sour.

This is a wonderful and versatile recipe that I made as written. I really like that it doesn't have that alarming colour that sweet and sour sauce has in restaurants. I used it with some veggie "meatballs" over brown rice with steamed green beans on the side. It was delicious, and a little goes a long way because it is so flavourful. I am going to freeze some so that I can have it on hand for a quick flavour hit to tofu, noodles, veggie stir fry, spring rolls ... The possibilities are endless. Thanks!

Stir-fried chopped chicken breast tenders, onion, yellow pepper, red pepper, homegrown zucchini & fresh pineapple. Served it over steamed Jasmine rice and topped with homemade sweet and sour sauce.
I changed the sauce a little bit but not significantly... I used 1/4 brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, I used leftover chicken broth I had in my fridge that needed using instead of water and I used 1/4 cup ketchup upon another reviewers recommendation. Was strong but mellowed a little once served over the dish. Pretty yummy. It reminded me a lot of Kikoman's bottled sweet and sour sauce.

I forgot to buy sweet n sour sauce at the store and wanted to make a stir fry with pineapple bacon sausage, onion, red and green pepper and pineapple.  I came across this easy recipe and it was very good.  I however used one readers modification for using brown sugar and pineapple juice and more ketchup.  This is a keeper!

Love it, started using it for myself because my husband loves the hot and spicy stuff. My son loves it and my husband finally tried it and he loves it too! It's simple to use and great for making a some in advance and refrigerating it.

I used this sauce when making Chicken Stir Fry. It was absolutely delicious and will be a new stir dish for us to use. I did substitute Splenda for the sugar. I was hesitant to use so much Splenda so I used 1/2 cup. After tasting it when done, it really did need more so I added another 1/4 cup of Splenda to it. Shows that sometimes a recipe is perfect just as it is. When the chicken and veggies were almost done, I added a big spoonful of sauce to the pan and let cook for about 5 minutes. The chicken and veggies were glazed in the sauce (see picture) and were delicious. Thank you for a simple and wonderful recipe!

First time making this sauce.  I was looking for a quick, easy, pineapple-free recipe and this was it.  I made it, threw in some pre-baked meatballs I had in the freezer and served it over rice.  Amazing!  Thank you for this recipe!!

Absolutely delicious! I am in love with this sauce. In fact, I make a small batch to serve over sticky rice (with tons of veggies on top) several times a week for dinner. Yum yum! I do double the ketchup because it tastes more like the sweet and sour I'm used to eating but everything else is good. I still want to try pineapple juice instead of water but so far, I'm enjoying it as is. Thank you very much for this simple and delightful recipe.

Pretty fair. I think the pineapple juice in place of water would be excellent as others suggested but I did not have any. I added a few drops of red food coloring to improve the appearance. Soy content seemed okay but I used low sodium.

This was really good.  I first stir fried an onion, a bell pepper, pineapple chunks and 3 cloves of crushed garlic with a little olive oil.  Then stired in the cornstarch and the rest of the ingredients.  Put it with chicken and it was perfect!

This sauce got rave reviews at my house and I made it just as is! It was delicious and I couldn't believe how easy and fast it was. I had bought some frozen egg rolls and thought they came with the sauce. I put this together and the last second and everyone thought it came from a bottle.

A simple easy sauce to go with your favorite stir fry ingredients. I added a small garlic clove and threw in fresh cilantro at the end before serving. We don't buy ketchup so I used hot BBQ sauce - turned out great (but remember that BBQ has vinegar already in it so plan accordingly). Tomato paste also works just as good. I also substitute honey for the sugar from time to time.

This was great! Multiplied it to serve 75 people and the recipe stands strong. I substituted the water for some pineapple juice, and I blended that with the cornstarch separately while the rest came to simmer. Then I added them together slowly over the heat while stirring. This helps the cornstarch from clumping and causing trouble.

Love this recipe as is - my 4 year old loves to dip chicken tenders in it! Only adjustment I do is to use low-sodium soy sauce, my personal preference. Also, once it's ready I take out some for me and add crushed red pepper to it for some kick :)

For meatballs, this sauce mixed with equal parts bottled BBQ sauce and warmed in a crockpot is easy and delicious!

Yeah, idk, maybe I did something wrong, but this just doesn't taste at all like sweet and sour sauce.  It's just... like sweet ketchup or something.  I tried both with and without modifications but I'm just not that impressed.  Sorry.

An excellent base sauce recipe. I altered this to make several different types of sweet & sour sauce. Going purely by the recipe this is better than any of the store bought sauces.

I tried this sauce with a crunchy chicken finger recipe I had and this is the most amazing sauce I have ever had!!! I crave the 2 recipes together! I will NEVER again buy sweet and sour sauce! My sons (who are 19 & 21) beg me to make this sauce, so I have to make large amounts for use with alot of other foods! (hint: I added a little red pepper flakes to give it more zing)

This is an interesting creature. It is a great base, but when made per the recipe I found it to be a little odd. I used 1/3 cup ketchup and added a little honey and it seemed to make it tastier. Wasn't my favorite sweet and sour but is very quick to make.

Keeper!!!  Flavor is great - can be used as dipping sauce, sauce for meatballs, chicken - and versatile.  You can adjust amounts and ingredients to suit taste - we liked it as is!  (But i've added garlic, ginger and a bit of sesame to it, too!)

This sauce was the perfect sweet and sour sauce for me.  It's a bit more sweet than sour, and my husband said he thought there should be some green pepper and pineapple in the recipe as well.  But as for me, I loved it so much I wanted to drink it!  Yes that's right, DRINK IT!

Pretty good. My changes: Substituted rice wine vinegar for the white. Will probably use a little less of it next time. Used pineapple juice instead of water. Used less than 1/2 cup of sugar total, using a little brown sugar along with the white. Came out a little thicker than I'd like for my vegetable stir fry, so I'll cut down on the cornstarch, which I added as a slurry, next time.

After reading some reviews, I followed the suggestions from others and the sauce turned out fantastic.  I will no longer buy sweet and sour sauce at the store, this is an easy recipe. I tend to double the batch and store some in the fridge so it is available when I am needing a dipping sauce.  Here is the recipe that I use.... 1/4 C of brown sugar 1/2 C of white sugar  1/3 cup white vinegar 1/4 C of pineapple juice and pineapple chunks 1/4 C of ketchup  1/4 cup soy sauce If it is too thin then add a little flour to help give it some body.  Boil on the stove and let cool, it will thicken as it cools.  This is more of a sweet version of the sauce, if too sweet then reduce the amount of pineapple juice and/or sugar.

Used this as my basic idea, but changed it up a little. I used brown sugar instead of white. I also used equal amounts of white and apple cider vinegar instead of just white. I cut way back on the soy sauce, probably only used about 2 tblsp, and increased the ketchup to about 1/4 cup. I baked chicken thighs in the sauce, and served over rice. DELISH!

This was a very tasty and simple recipe.  I did add 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 cup of pineapple juice and an extra Tbl of cornstarch.  I also put some roughly chopped onion and green pepper and a can of pineapple chunks drained. YUMMY!

Made this as directed, however cut down the soy sauce by half,and I was sure glad I did! It can be a bit of an overwhelming flavor.  I tried all white sugar and half and half with brown-Half and half is defiantly they way to go.  Read the review that mentions the quick cook method! SO much quicker. Served with home made pork balls and chow mien.

Delicious sauce! I used this to make sweet and sour pork patties from this site. I did make just a couple of changes. I replaced 1/4 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar. To cook it, I put everything in a pot except the cornstarch, which I mixed with equal parts water. I brought it to a boil and then added my cornstarch mixture. I think it's faster this way.

Mahalo plenty! This is a very delicious sweet n sour sauce, just the type I was looking for : ). I did, however, follow others suggestions and increase the amount of ketchup to 1/4 cup and added the cornstarch in a slurry since I get super irritated if my sauce turns out lumpy : P. Thank you!!! Also I think it is super delicious on baked or even just drained and warmed firm tofu, yum!!!

Finally a good s-n-s recipie!  I said, this is the best one I have ever made and my 6 year old daughter said, "No it's the best in the world"  I think others used more ketchup.  The only change I made was substituting pineapple juice for the water, I had some  from a can of leftover pinneapple.  It was excellent.  Definatly have found a keeper recipie.  No need to buy it anymore!

This was ok, but not great.  It was too watery and definitely needs more cornstarch than called for, and was more sour than sweet.  Next time I will stick with my mom's sweet and sour sauce which calls for pineapple juice and has a more syrup-like consistancy.

I used this sauce over a stirfy, with veggies and beef.  It turned out great.  Next time I would change the white sugar to brown sugar.   EDIT: I used brown sugar, and it made a big difference!!  WOW!  I used it as a dip for appitizer and people coulndn't believe I made it they assumed it was store bought!!

This sauce its AMAZING!!! I made zero changes, it tasted just like something I would get from a chinese food place (americanized of course). My suggestion is before you start subbing all the ingredients (which will obviously impact the overall flavor) make a small batch & decide for yourself. I only use low sodium soy sauce, maybe thats why my batch turned out fantastic as written. My kids & husband thought it was fantastic. I pared it with sweet and sour sausage from this site and served over rice.

Most of the ingredients are household staples which makes the recipe very appealing. Vinegar can be overpowering unless you balance it out with a sweet and a citrus. My suggestion is to use orange zest (and a few tablespoons of orange juice), ginger and crushed pineapple... You will taste a major difference in both balance and texture. Otherwise this is a great recipe for a quick fix!

I had frozen meatballs and needed a sauce, and this was great!  My teen boys loved it!  I used pineapple juice instead of water, and 1/2 cup brown sugar with 1/4 cup white sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  It was very sweet but had just enough sour to it.  It was great the next day as well!

This sauce was great! We had it with our egg rolls tonight, very good! I think it would be best with a lo mein, or sweet and sour chicken, but we loved it as a dipping sauce too. The only ingredient change I made was to use about 1/2c. white sugar and 1/4c. brown sugar. I heated up all the ingredients except the cornstarch, then ladeled a little of the hot mixture into a bowl and added my cornstarch to that, as was suggested earlier. Be sure to mix it well and only add it back in a little at a time. It thickened up almost instantly! Took about 3 minutes start to finish. This one will go in my "permanent" file.

This was a tasty sauce for cream cheese wontons.  I'm sure that the full amount of soy sauce would have been too much for my taste, however.  Half was plenty.  I also used pineapple juice instead of water.  I'd like to try this recipe again using rice vinegar instead of white.

My family liked this better than the red fake stuff in the bottle. I used 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I doubled the amount of ketchup. We like pineapple, so I diced a tablespoon of pineapple and mixed it in, too. It had a great flavor. Great new option for chicken in my house. I ate it with egg rolls and it was great. Thanks!

very yummy!!! Apricot jam and red chile sauce to your liking were great little additions to the already fabulous sweet and sour taste. I liked the soy aspect of it....a little bit unusual....but what a great recipe where all the ingredients are staple pantry items!

This sauce came together in about 5 minutes, which was great. Adding a little pineapple juice with a few pineapple chunks, and even some maraschino cherries would make this a 5 star sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

Great quick and easy sauce to make. I adjust the ketchup and soy sauce to taste and went 50/50 on brown and white sugars to make the 3/4 cup. It is worth the 5 stars.

Delicious. Extremely easy. I used it to dip with egg rolls, on fried rice, and home-made kung pao. You can store it in the refridgerator, and heat up for later. Great recipe, and my husband loved it.  This will become part of my regularly used recipes.

gave this a 5 star based on my own chages- only a half cup of sugar and replaced the water with pineapple juice- I poured it over pork chops and baked in the oven and served with rice and salad and family loved it!

If you use pinneapple juice instead of water and half the amount of soy sauce, it is just like the sauce the chineese rest. have. Also I reccomend sifting in cornstarch so you dont get lumps.

I took advice from others, and changed this up a bit. I put 1/2c sugar, 1/4c brown sugar, 1/4c pineapple juice instead of water, and 1/4c ketchup. This was good with lumpias, and wontons.

It really tastes perfect with pineapple juice instead of water.

i took everyone's advice and used the measurements as guidelines.  since my family is trying to watch its sodium intake, i actually used no soy sauce at all.  instead of water or pineapple juice, i used the juice from a can of mandarin oranges.  YUM!  the sauce turned out great.  we used it for dipping crab rangoons, and as a glaze on chicken.  will definitely make it again.  thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was perfect as written. I didn’t change a thing. Update: I just made this again but I didn’t have any corstarch so I used 3 tbsp flour instead. I made chicken nuggets and put them in this sauce to make a sweet and sour chicken.  Still tasted delicious. This is an excellent recipe.

I didn't have white vinegar so I used apple cider and the whole family loved it! I will use white if I have it but at least I know apple cider vinegar works.  YummAy!

I used ac vinegar instead of white and also switched white sugar for brown sugar. Instead of water, I substituted pineapple juice and have used potato starch instead of cornstarch (we're gluten free so we already had it on hand, white rice flour works too but potato starch works better).  It comes out just like the local Chinese restaurant we used to frequent before going gluten free. Our kids love the sauce, we even deep fry chicken tenders when I make this to make a more authentic sweet and sour chicken, which is my husbands favorite. Very good recipe as a base...no offense, but most recipes I just use as a base recipe and change things to our liking and dietary needs.

This recipe is OUTSTANDING for a starting point, SO SIMPLE!!! Very good with a couple of the tweaks. For instance, I used all of the juice from a can of diced pineapple instead of water, plus about a 1/4 cup of orange juice instead of water. I also added about 2 tbsp of molasses in addition to the sugar and maybe a tbsp of balsamic vinegar as well. It had the taste, body, and color of what I am used to. Lots of tang with the sweet. I poured the can of pineapple pieces into to serve on top of tempura pork and fried rice. I would rate this 5 stars except I think the original needs the tweaks. I started with the original then tweaked after tasting along the way.

So simple, so easy to tweak.  Sweeter?  Add sugar.  More sour?  Add vinegar.  More savory?  Add soy sauce.  We've made this twice now and we keep messing with it.  It just invites your own creativity.  In a try or two you'll be making your favorite restaurant sauce.  It's now a standard at our place and everyone who's tried it loves it.

This was better than the "fruity" one, but not quite "it," according to "The Girl."  :D  When asked if she'd like it sweeter, she said "yes."  She's funny about pineapple, but maybe I'll try Bikerfamily's suggestion on the Buzz of subbing with pineapple juice, or part pineapple juice.

I've made this twice and combined it with pork that I slice up to make S&S pork and my family absolutely loves it.  The sauce is a cinch to make, takes maybe 5-10 minutes tops.

This was perfect. Sns sauce to. T. 
But if you want something less like the fluorescent neon sauce from the store use chicken broth and pineapple juice instead of water, half the soy, keep the ketchup but add 1tbsp of sriracha, half brown half white sugar with a bit of garlic and half and half vinegar and fresh squeezed lemon. Flour to thicken. This sauce is a perfect base to understand the basics and tweak it any way you like, purely simple and delicious.

This is a good one but I agree, use pineapple instead or 50/50 with water. I also get a little creative and add a green onion chopped and some cloves with a touch of cinnamon. Yummy!

This recipe is tasty as-is, but my husband has a thing about soy sauce.  I cut back the soy sauce to just a tablespoon, and I thought it was just as good.

Seems as though you should give the sauce time to cool preferably over night cause it's very nice now. Resembles a real sauce as well..

Turned out really good.  I used the two tablespoons of flour with a bit of water (think/thick consistency) and added one tablespoon of honey.  Just sampled the flavor, can't wait for dinner.  Never realized it would be so easy  and that I would have all ingredients in the cabinet.

Like other reviewers, I changed the recipe a bit just because I can. :) I substituted some of the white sugar with brown sugar (about 1/3 of the measurement). I also used half white vinegar and half rice vinegar. I increased the amount of ketchup by a ton. I didn't add the cornstarch but I did mixed a bit of flour with water and gradually added that to the mixture while it was boiling on the stove. I liked it and ate it with sausage and rice but then again, I rarely eat sweet and sour sauce so I don't think I'm a good judge at it. To me, it turned out exactly what its name is--sweet and sour. Yummy. Next time though, I think I will make it a bit more sour and add a sour liquid instead of water to the mixture; maybe orange or pineapple or lemon juice.

Excellent! Sweet but not too sweet; just the right thickness; not too heavy.  Made just the right amount for approx 1.5 pounds of cut up chicken breast mixed with the same amount of Asian stir-fry vegetables. 

Just cooked the chicken and the vegetables, put them together in a bowl, and poured this sauce over the top! After a good stir, served it up over fresh, hot rice. What an awesome dinner!

I used these measurements and adjustments to make a small batch... 1 TBS brown sugar, 2 TBS white sugar, 1 TBS ketchup, 1 TBS soy sauce, about 2 TBS crushed pineapple(thawed frozen pineapple-about 1/4 cup- that I puréed-leaving some chunks- in the food processor) about 2 tsp white vinegar, and I left the cornstarch and water out, because I didn't want the sauce to be a thick consistency from the cornstarch, and didn't want the water to make the sauce bland. Really really good! Will definitely make this again.

A bit too sweet and I already used less sugar than the recipe called for. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/3 cup white sugar. 1/2 cup pineapple juice 1/4 cup of ketchup.

I've never made a sauce before so I probably did something wrong. It was disgusting! I don't know what happened, but mine turned more sour than sweet, even with extra honey. I think I'll stick to store bought sauce rather than trying to make my own ;)

This is very good. It's not like sweet and sour sauces I've had before because it tastes more barbecue-ish, but we did enjoy it and we will make it again.  Very easy to make and toss in cooked chicken.

This was aweful! Followed the recipe to a T and it was too salty from the soy sauce. Tasted nothing like sweet and sour sauce and will be looking for something better.

Made with no variations, it is very good and my favorite part is that it's not that nasty pink color you get at most Chinese restaurants.

It tasted good.  Will add more ketchup and less soy sauce for a lighter color next time.

I guess the thought of Ketchup in a sweet and sour sauce made me almost pass this up!  GLAD I MADE IT!!!  Follwed exactly but did not have the soy sauce..I used Worchester Sauce and it was FANTASTIC!!! Make it..Taste just like you would get out at chinese rest.

I made this sauce for sweet and sour chicken. cubed chicken breast after breast were almost done I added the sauce and let it simmer for a couple of minutes. It was delicious I did make some changes to the sauce. Instead of water I opened a can of pineapple and used the juice. Also added the cornstarch at the end. Next time I will use brown sugar as other suggestion to add more color to it.  Will be making sweet n sour chicken for a birthday party will come back and add my review on my guest comments....

With 2 minor changes, I thought this recipe was excellent! Even my son, who never eats the takeout sweet n sour sauce, enjoyed it. I took the soy sauce down to 1 Tbl. and increased the ketchup to about 3 Tbl., and I thought it was perfect! Certainly just as good as the usual takeout Chinese versions, and so simple to make. This recipe is a keeper!

Exactly what I was looking for! Ran out of sweet and sour sauce at home, so I tried this--way better than the store bought stuff! I think I'll be making this from now on!

I made a few tweaks to modify for my own tastes, but even as is, this is an excellent recipe.

Way too much soya sauce, 1-2 Tbsp is enough. Start with 1 Tbsp and then add a bit more until it's to your liking. I also adjusted the ketchup to 2 Tbsp and it was just like the restaurant sweet n sour sauce. Everything else was very good!

Awesome sauce, easy to alter to taste!!  I started with less sugar and very little soy sauce... added a bit of orange juice for a bit of citrus flavor.  I also used rice vinegar in lieu of white vinegar.  Turned out AMAZING each time I've made it and I'm saving a fortune not eating out for my Chinese food fix!!

I was really hoping that this would be great due to all of the amazing reviews.. And it could very well be just me... but I followed the recipe exactly and it was just awful. I went with a reviewers suggestion to add a 1/4 cup of ketchup instead, and it didn't help at all. Mine was not even the same color as the one shown in the picture - it was brown from the soy sauce. It tasted nothing like the sweet and sour sauce that I'm used to. Another reviewer suggested using pineapple juice instead of water... that might help.. It just tasted too much like hot sticky soy sauce.

I was looking for a quick and tangy S&S sauce to go with a stir fry, but I did not care for this.

I add pineapple juice to fill up to the 2/3 cups of water as well as some crushed pineapple. Yummy!

I used SHELS77's modifications, the sauce turned out great.  I can't eat at Chinese restaurants due to allergies. When I first tried this recipe I was in heaven, it was the first time in 5 years that I'd had Sweet and Sour Chicken that tasted like it came from a restaurant!   I've made this 3 times since, it's been a big hit with family and guests.

Great! I added only 1/2 cup sugar, half the soy sauce, and no ketchup. Also added 1tsp (1 cube) of chicken stock paste to give it some richness. Thanks for the nice base recipe.

This sauce was not bad at all.  I added a tbs. or so of lemon juice and a good sized pinch of red chili flakes after it was done cooking.  I also used rice wine vinegar instead of white and I used arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch.  I tossed it with turkey meatballs and stir fried onions, carrots, and celery.  I would use this recipe again for sure!

I followed the recipe to a "t". It was fab. We were having company for dinner, so I made sure that I had some store bought on hand just in case. I got a lot of praise for "my" great sauce, and I have an unopened bottle of store bought that I will wind up giving away.

This was really really good.  My husband who hasn't really liked my previous attempts at homemade sweet and sour sauce because he likes the store bought stuff in a bottle better, well, he loved this sauce.  I did replace 1/2 of the water with 1/3 cup pineapple juice and I mixed the cornstarch with the 1/3 cup of water and added that after the other ingredients were already boiling.  Other than that everything else was as written.  Thank you!

I really liked this recipe because it was super easy and can be made with household items that I always have on hand. I think it could have been just a little bit thicker and I'm wondering if mixing the cornstarch with 1/3 of the cup of water and waiting until the other ingredients come to a boil before adding would help. I might try this next time. Otherwise, a great overall recipe!

Great when made as is! I did substitute flour for the cornstarch because I didn't have any and used a whisk. A little chunky, but still great.

I made this for my bf and he loved it, I did however add a few things and reduced the ingredients since I only made about one cup. I added 1 tb of sugar, 1 cup of water, about 1/4 cup of ketchup, 1 tbs of honey, some garlic and hot pepper seasoning, and whatever other ingredients the recipe called for - soy sauce, etc. I also added about 1tbs of cornstarch but it get like it was too thin, either way my bf liked it :).

After trying it per the recipe the first time, the flavor was almost there but still a little off (hence 4 stars not 5). The second time I added a dash more sugar, reduced the soy sauce to 2 tbsp, increased ketchup to 1/4 c, and kept everything else the same.  I think next time I will reduce the water a little so the flavor is more concentrated.  I had no idea sweet and sour was this easy, thanks for sharing!

YUM.  I used this sauce to marinade spam and broccoli for wontons. I also made cream cheese wontons and drizzled the remaining sauce all over after they were fried! Instead of using white sugar, I used brown. I didn't have cornstarch but this still turned out once mixture cooled. I didn't measure anything lol I don't think you can go wrong with this one. Give it a try!

It was a pretty good sauce. I was looking for something a little tangier, but it was still nice. I decided to try it with rice, since the description said it goes good with it, and it was great. I didn't expect sweet and sour to work with rice, but the plain white rice kind of buffered the flavor. I would recommend trying it, the recipe and general and with rice.

Over all, a super recipe. It had just the right thickness but the taste was a little off. There was a little to much soy sauce so it came out really salty,so I added less soy sauce and more ketchup. After that it was perfect! :) Great for chicken and egg rolls!

I was looking for a sweet and sour sauce that was simple and used ingredients I already had.  This hit the spot, but I add a little minced garlic.  Nice flavor and its great base for making alterations for your own version

This is the first sweet and sour sauce recipe I've tried. It's a little vinegary. I also didn't have quite enough soy sauce, oops. Here is what I did: following another's advice, I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, instead of water I used apple jelly. I heated everything except the corn starch to a slight boil (the jelly will melt into a liquid) then I dissolved the corn starch in an equal amount cold water and added it to the pan and boiled again. It came out nice and thick. Next time I would cut back on the vinegar and make sure to use the correct amount of soy sauce. I used this on the sweet and sour pork patties recipe from this site and it was pretty good!

Loved it! Few changes, omitted the vinegar, used 3/4 of ketchup and a tablespoon of honey.  Also like to add minced white onion (if I dont have on hand a couple sprinkles of onion powder is just as good).  Tastes even better the next day.  Poured over meatballs and basmati rice.

This was a great sauce! I took another reviewers advice and added 1/4 cup of ketchup and then did 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also used half and half of pineapple juice and water. I also used an extra 1/4 cup of cornstarch because i enjoy my sauce very thick, with a few drops of red food coloring this looked and tasted just like restaurant dipping sauce. yummy!

This tasted great... If you like sweet sauces this is for you but for those who don't cut back on the sugar a bit... Just like going to a chinese resturant !

This was perfect, I had to use apple cider vinegar instead, because I didn't have white, but it was awesome! I will use the apple cider vinegar every time, because I can't believe it can taste any better than this!!!

I made just as is.  Maybe added pineapple juice.  I used it for a sauce for stir-fried peppers, onion, carrot, celery and pineapple with leftover pork loin chopped in it.  Served over Jasmine rice.  Could totally be vegetarian without the leftover pork and would have tasted great.  Loved the sauce.  So much flavor and really easy ingredients.

I made this substituting 1/4 cup of brown sugar with 1/2 cup of white and increased catchup to 1/4 cup as suggested in another review.  It really smelled like there was too much catchup but once it cooked up everything married nicely.  Great sauce!

This is my first time making sweet and sour sauce.  I found myself searching for a recipe when my takeout order of sweet and sour chicken came with no sweet and sour sauce!! Yes, I was very disappointed!  Anyway, this sauce is wonderful! After reading a few of the reviews, I decided to decrease the soy sauce in half and substitute pineapple juice for the water.  It is much better then store bought and is very quick and easy!  EXCELLENT!

Super easy, super tasty, and way cheaper than the store bought brands!  Yum!!! (I substituted half of the water with pineapple juice, and added a little more cornstarch because I like it a little thicker)

This sauce was excellent! I dumped the sugar in the pan and thought that it looked like a lot but it was perfect. I used this with "Grandma's Crispy Pork Wontons" and it was perfect. I can't wait to use it for sweet and sour chicken! Thanks!

Easy and tasty. Great on Chinese rice, egg rolls, and chicken. I halve the recipe and it makes enough for 4 people [who don't drown their food in sauce]. Also, rice vinegar works if that's all you have on hand. Don't be thrown by the ketchup, you can't really taste it.

Gosh, I´m sorry but this just didn´t cut it. I tasted it as i was making it and it wasn't good. I tried adding orange juice and other tweaks, but that didn´t help much. I served it anyway, warning my family that it wasn´t an ordinary sns sauce, it didn´t taste as bad with the spring rolls and chicken, but definitely not what i was hoping.

This is a good sweet and sour sauce just the way it is.  It has ingredients I always have in the house.  It may need more cornstarch, but that's a simple fix with a little water with cornstarch stirred into it and then cooked into the boiling sauce until it thickens.

I doubled it and used it with chicken, bell peppers, onions, and pineapple (generous amount) and served it over rice. It was terrific tasting, easy to prepare and the kids loved it. This will be easy to remember over and over again, and I have the ing. on hand always.

This sauce was good, but my family and I thought it had too much of a "soy sauce" taste.  Next time, I don't think I'll add as much soy sauce.

I really liked this recipie!  But in addition to the simple ingredients, I added about a tsp. of minced garlic for extra flavor (although, none is needed-this sauce is able to stand on it's own).  I had some chicken thighs but nothing to make with them except for rice and some frozen veggies.  I decided to look on-line for a sauce with ingredients that I already had in my pantry- this was the only one that sounded simple enough to a laymen such as myself.  My reason for five stars: This is a simple recipie for such a great sauce!  It filled my house with the most wonderful, rich aroma... my hubby came home and declared me a domestic goddess.  Yum yum.  I will be making this again soon!  ^_^

liked it worked well.  Only thing I would do different is add just a little somtehing Tablespoon  of pineapple juice and tsp.of hot sauce.  Great texture had to use flour instead of cornstarch turned out fine have to double flour to cornstarch.  Good eating!

FAST AND EASYYYYYY!-- EVERYONE has these ingredients in their kitchen cupboard!   I read several reviews before jumping in.  My take - I only used about 2/3rds of the soy sauce called for, and I doubled the ketchup. I put in about 1/3 lg. can of pineapple and about 1/4 cu of the pineapple juice.  Then.. I added about 2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch and simmered it. It turned out PERFECT... and we loved it!    *NEXT TIME* I'll try the other suggestion of leaving the ingredients alone and adding 1 tablespoon of honey.

This sauce is great.  Very easy to make as well.  I added a bit extra flour as I ran out of cornstarch.  I made it for 6 kids and they all approved and said it was their favorite recipe.  :)  I mixed mine with some ground beef.. I was going to make meatballs but ended up just cooking it in a frying pan and mixing it with the sauce... much better this way.  Served it with rice.

This was quick, easy and, as my seventeen year old says, good enough to come from Panda! :)

Thank you so much for the recipe. I never realized sweet and sour sauce was made from ingredients I always have on hand...

This was pretty good.  The consistancy was perfect.  I thought it was too sweet and not sour enough.  Next time I'll follow the advice of some other reviews and use pinapple juice instead of water.  Maybe a touch less sugar, but not much.

This is perfect! I decided very last minute that I wanted sweet and sour sauce with my dinner, but had none. I hopped on AR quickly and found this one. I always have these ingredients on hand and it was done in minutes. Tasted great! Thanks for sharing!

I used SHEL77's changes, but stuck with the cornstarch.  My husband had been asking to go out for Chinese, but I thought I could whio something up quickly.  This sauce made the meal!  He told me a few times how great it was and went back for seconds--and this all starting with frozen stir-fry blend, added pineapple and soy chicken patties, cut-up.  Thanks!

I did the recommendations from one of the users.  Use these substitutions: 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup of pineapple juice instead of water, 1/4 cup of ketchup instead of the 1 tablespoon (trust me on this!).  I also only used 1-2 TBSP of soy sauce.  These are the other recommendations from the lady that I didn't use but am curious about: use 2 Tablespoons of flour dissolved into a little water. Add the flour/water mixture to the boiling (on low heat) mix of the other items. IF you stick with the cornstarch, use less.

I am not much of a measurer...so I just threw everything in a pot until it looked right and it tasted great! I added some red pepper flakes as well, which gave it some bite.

This was an awesome sauce!!  I'm only sorry I broke my golden rule of not making it EXACTLY as the recipe says for the first time.  I instead used a combination of brown sugar and white sugar....now wish I would have just used the white.  But it was still excellent.  I made the mistake when I served my spring rolls the last time of deciding I didn't have time to make a sauce and instead bought a bottle at the store...yuk!! A waste of money.  Instead I could have made this simple, easy and wonderful sauce.   It will be kept in my box for future use.

This is a great recipe, but instead of ketchup i like to add 3-4 tablespoons of tomato sauce. Also cut down on sugar and only add 1/3 cup since i don't want my sauce to be too sweet. I couldn't eat spring rolls without this!!

What a great and super easy sauce, I used half brown and white sugars and cut back on the soy sauce. The finished sauce is brown and rich with flavor, perfect for dipping eggrolls. Thank you for saving me a trip to the market, this was as good or better than the bottled stuff I usually buy.

great sauce! Make it as written, then adjust as you need to, I ended up adding more ketchup and soy sauce in equal amounts. I think it's better for a dish, not as much as a dipping sauce.

Not a bad sauce as written. I followed the recipe to the letter but want to make some changes myself next time. I like the brown sugar idea and will try that next time. I also want to cut the soy sauce back a little. I found it a little strong.

OK, after making this recipe, and finding it so dark, I put it all into an empty squeeze top catchup bottle and plan to use it as a cooking sauce instead of dipping. I believe it will work better this way. 

Thanks for the basic recipe.

Yep, this is pretty good. While I did as the other reviewers suggested & used the pineapple juice... it still needed some H20. The sauce was just too sweet on it's own. Next time I'd cut the soy sauce in half. I did use a couple tsps of hoisin sauce instead of ketchup and then added a couple tsps of asian chili garlic sauce which realllly gave it some kick. If you don't have a jar of that in your cupboard... you should try it. Use this sauce mixed with chicken, peppers and some asian vegetable over rice. Pretty darn good!

I have tried many sweet and sour sauce recipes and none of them were right, until now.  I subbed pineapple juice for the water as suggested by other reviewers, and it is PERFECT.  Sweet and tangy and delicious.

Like other reviewers, I used pineapple juice instead of water, and I cut back on the sugar. It wasn't quite as good as the s&s sauce at our fave Chinese restaurant, but it was good nonetheless. Thanks, Linda!

I was a little worried while stirring this on the stove, as the ingredients did not look like they were blending. It came out really well though, and I only used half the soy sauce it called for. I also used mostly pineapple juice instead of just water. I would definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe!  I have made it several times for stirfry and have cut it down to 4 servings so that I wouldn't have leftovers.  I also have substituted the sugar for Splenda which has worked really well.  Thanks!

I made per instructions, and boiled to the consistency we wanted.  However, the smell was horrendous!  I thought I had screwed it up, until my brave husband tried it and it wasn't bad.  He was right!  
I had problems with the ketchup dissolving so next time, I'll mix that with the water before I add to the mix.  Maybe then I'll get the red color, as tonight it was brown.  
We'll use again though.

I was surprised at how simple and delicious this sauce was!  I had all of the ingredients on hand, and it came together very quickly.  It was more sweet than sweet/sour, and a little bit thick, but it tasted great.  I'll be using it again!

This sauce was awesome. Very, very easy and very delicious. I did substitute the water for pineapple juice like recommended by some reviews... I poured it over chicken and it was a hit! /Update: Made this with water as stated and it was just as yummy! I also added a few drops of red food coloring. Delicious!

I had never eaten sweet and sour anything until last night when my hubby requested s-n-s chicken. This was the perfect recipe as I don't keep pineapple around. We served it over chicken and rice and even picky me loved it. Thanks! (And I thought the amount of soy sauce was good!!)

I loved this - instead of cutting soy sauce down, I used a low sodium soy just aiming for the balance of sweet and sour  that I like best for what I was putting it on today.  Other than that, I just tasted the mix all along the way and it fit what I was looking for.  I used it for crab rangoon - if I want a s&s sauce for eggroll, I'd increase the sweet content maybe but this is a great all-around sauce and I wouldn't be disappointed to use it exactly as written with anything whatsoever.  Recipes give you ratios, technique and beyond that, it's personal taste.  I didn't compare this to a restaurant, memories of my former favorite, etc., it's just good on its own!

I opened my bag of carryout crab rangoons tonight, only to find no sweet and sour sauce! Not having any pineapple juice on hand, I did a quick search and came up with this recipe. I followed the recipe to a tee (how can you rate a recipe when you change all of the ingredients?) I thought it tasted good, and it did the trick for the rangoons, but I have to admit that it was a little heavy on the soy sauce. Next time I make it, I'll cut the sauce to 1/4 cup.

This recipe is pretty good.  I tried it because I didn't have any pineapple juice (which is usually necessary in most sweet-and-sour sauce recipes).  It's not bad, but I agree with those who used pineapple juice, it's probably better with it.  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand to use again.

I used this sauce last night in my pork stir-fry and it was good. I followed the recipe to the T except that I just added it to the pork and let it thicken with the meat. I can understand however, how this sauce would not suit eggrolls, meatballs, or chicken strips. I would use it only for stirfry. Eggrolls need PLUM sauce, meatballs need more ketchup and brown sugar instead of white, and chicken strips, well, I'm not sure about that one! Thanks for this recipe, it was great!

I used lemon juice instead of vinegar, used 1/2 c. brown sugar & 1/4 c. white added some ginger, garlic and shredded carrot.  Mixed the sauce with some beef I simmered for about an hour and put it on rice - it was good. Next time I will try pork ribblets. Everyone liked it.  Thanks for sharing

Perfect sauce for dipping lumpia! It's definately better than the store bought jarred ones!  Heck, even better than some of the restaurants out here.  I've had RAVE reviews from friends and family!  Very easy to make. Thank you for sharing!

Good, quick, and easy sauce, served over meatballs & dh loved it.  Added a little more ketchup and little less cornstarch based on other reviewers.  Will definitely keep & make again!

Perfect sweet and sour sauce, I especially love that it's made with ingredients most of us probably have on hand anyways. I usually make my own version of this, but this time was on the hunt for a recipe with actual quantities of each thing(verses my usual little bit of this and that method, lol) I think this would have been delicious on it's own, but I did tweak it with a little maraschino cherry juice, extra ketchup, and some minced garlic/ginger I had on hand. It would have been just as good as is though! I did only add the cornstarch at the end by mixing it with cold water and adding it after the rest of it came to a mild boil - that's just how I always thicken my sauces.

I added some pineapple chunks to the boiling mix and to really nail the flavor added 4 teaspoons of Tamarind sauce. The Tamarind really gets that authentic flavour you see in the restaurants.

It works. Very tasty. Its tangy and sweet but not the uberfake restaurant sauce I'm craving and trying to make on the cheap. Definitely saving for later, but still searching for the commercial sauce.

Good solid recipe, easy to make.  Each time I make it, I vary a little bit until I get to what suits my taste buds to perfection.  Strictly a matter of taste.  Nothing wrong with the recipe itself.

I made two batches: The first was EXACTLY as written, and my guests loved it. I also made a low-sodium version for me, by swapping the soy sauce with 2 Tblsp of amino sauce, (eliminating over 3000mg of sodium!) plus a 1/2 tsp of chili paste to boost the missing flavor. Both sauces were delicious.

This is so easy to make, and my husband and grandkids love it! I did put onions and chicken in this and frozen stir-fry vegetables. I also make an extra batch of the sweet & sour sauce and freeze it, so it helps when company shows up unexpectedly for a meal. Garlic toast is so good with this!!

I followed a few changes that others recommended...added 1/4 cup of ketchup and boiled all ingredients first, then took out about 1/4 cup of sauce and added the cornstarch to it, then it mixed back into the saucepan.  Family loved it!

Instead of water I used pineapple juice; however, next time I think I will use half water and half pineapple juice. There was a bit too much pineapple juice, but better than just water only.

Made this like 2 minutes ago because my son said “wish we had some sweet and sour sauce for the tenders”. Sure maybe pineapple juice or whatever might have “tweaked” it. But as I’m fresh outta pineapple juice, ginger, yada yada and had about 5 minutes before chicken was done I wanted something quick and simple. THIS WAS PERFECT! Just the way it was. Quick, simple, delicious! Thank you so much for this! I didn’t even measure ingredients very well lol. Just started throwing things in. I might try spicing it up when I have time to plan a dinner, just to see, but trust me, if you need a quick go to with basic ingredients, this sauce is it!!!

This is an awesome recipe, great flavor,  I'm diabetic and didn't want to waste my expensive sugar substitute on this just in case it was bad.  But it was great so now I can adapt it to using Sverve sugar substitute and not have all that sugar.  Thanks and kudos to whom ever made this recipe up

So easy & delicious! I swapped fresh pineapple juice for water and soy aminos for soy sauce, also reduced soy to 1Tbs. And I added crushed red pepper flakes for a sweet, sour, spicy sauce. Definitely making again.

Exchanged the sugar for 2/3 cup maple syrup. It was easy and tasty. I had plenty for two recipes of a sweet-and-sour chicken and vegetable stir fry. Will definitely make again.

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and could have reduced more to make it have less sugar.  This was amazing and tasted just like like the sweet and sour sauce you get on sweet and sour chicken at a Chinese restaurant. I made it with with rice, sprinkled a green pepper with pineapples and cherries.  OMG good!

Wow!  Followed some suggestions in the reviews reference using the brown sugar and pineapple juice.  WoW!  Cut recipe in half and made it for the Crab Rangoon. Also made Shrimp Fried Rice. Not a big Chinese Food Fan, but this was over the top, FANTASTIC!

tasted good, but it needed something else to add a more sweet flavor. Pineapple juice would have worked nicely!

This recipe is easy and tasty as written. As others have noted, the flavors are slightly out of balance. There's no need for complicated overhauls though. Just add 1 tsp of black pepper and 1 tsp of garlic powder, or 1 tsp of msg. The recipe goes heavy on soy sauce in  an attempt to compensate for the omission of the msg that is commonly used in packaged sweet and sour sauce.  Another easy fix is to use beef or chicken broth, or even red wine, instead of water.

When you make a recipe as well known as this one, you should taste test it to make sure all is OK.
If you don't know how sweet and sour tastes, go to a Chinese restaurant today!
Hats off to all who TRY to make Chinese anything.

I mostly followed this recipe and added something that wasn't in this recipe but I had seen in a few others I'd looked at before choosing this one; Pineapple juice. I have yet to try it without that so far so I can't say for certain if it's as good, hence 4 stars instead of 5

This is a great base to start with. It was more sweet than sour so the next time I will add more vinegar and the soy flavor was dominating so that will be cut back. I will add more ketchup and a pinch of Korean red pepper powder. It was easy to follow the directions and it thickened just at the boiling point. With a little tweaking this can be fantastic. Make it your own and adjust to your tastes.

Very tasty. I did make one sub; I replaced the water with orange juice for a little extra flavor. The sauce was a little on the sweet side for my taste, so I might reduce the sugar next time.

This was awesome and so simple when you're pressed for time! I made it in a large saucepan, increased the ketchup to 1/4 cup, chopped up a green pepper along with 1/2 a pineapple with the juices, threw them in with it, turned it down to low; defrosted a 1 pound bag of frozen jumbo shrimp, tossed it with some cornstarch and fried it over high heat in 1 tablespoon of oil in small batches, throwing them in with the sauce as I went; steamed some rice while cooking the rest of it. Dinner in 30 minutes. Yum!

This is a great recipe. I have used it many times. I have used it as written or swapped pineapple juice for the water and added a dash of crushed red pepper.  Tastes great either way.

My favourite sauce to accompany my sweet & sour chicken, and I always use pineapple juice instead of water, and I opt for honey instead of sugar.  Perfect every time.

Good basic recipe. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used part brown sugar and part white sugar, replaced about half of the water with orange juice since I didn't have pineapple juice, used half as much soy sauce and doubled the ketchup. It was plenty sweet but not very sour, so I ended up adding a little more vinegar after I'd thickened it. But this is easily tweakable to anyone's personal taste. I will probably make it again.

Made to go with frozen spring rolls as a quick late night snack, this sauce really gave the dish flavor- you would have never guessed the spring rolls were frozen when paired with this sauce.   However I didn't have any ketchup and realized halfway through combining ingredients so I used red pasta sauce instead. It worked out tremendously.. one thing I MUST mention is that this recipient makes a TON of sauce!! I have so much leftover!!

Made by the recipe.  Tasted and excellent! ! I did add a little more ketchup after I tasted.  Just because we like the taste.

Very good for a quick sauce made with ingredients on hand. Not quite like the restaurant orange stuff :) but a decent sub. Used 1/4 brown sugar, 1/2 cup white as some reviewers recommended, and after tasting added an extra tbsp of ketchup and 1 tsp chile paste. Will probably keep tweaking. Thanks!

Good , easy recipe.  I used rice vinegar instead as I was out of white vinegar.   Also was out of corn starch so I substituted about half the sugar for powdered sugar.  Turned out just as well as other times I made it with the exact ingredients although just a touch thinner.

Excellent recipe!  I substituted the water with pineapple juice and also used brown sugar.  Very good!  Served with lumpia when we ran out of  store bought sauce.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and I found it perfect. Not too sweet and not too sugary like other sauces I've tried. My husband and I used this for sweet & sour pork with broccoli over rice and we plan on making this again in the future.

This is definitely the classic sweet and sour sauce recipe I was looking for!  I have another recipe I make that uses pineapple juice, but I don't always love that flavor, it seems to overwhelm.  But this - this is perfect!  And it is simple ingredients I always have on hand.  The only change I made was to use rice wine vinegar instead of plain white vinegar... YUM.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

Thank you whoever wrote this, I didn't have the first clue what makes sweet & sour taste like sweet & sour but I found your recipe and managed to make a really good pork & rice thingy with some celery, carrots, onions, rice (obviously) and believe it or not - Worcestershire sauce! Also had some cranberry mustard so I dumped some of that in there too. Well probably wouldn't win any awards but filled the hole with something DIFFERENT for a change. I probably couldn't repeat it tomorrow but I lucked out today anyway, lol! Thanks!

Super delish. I made this sauce and tossed it with some sauteed chicken, bell pepper, onion, and pineapple for an easy, no fuss dinner. This recipe made a lot so I had leftovers (we are a family of four). Worry not, I threw it on top of some Costco meatballs and pineapple for the hubs to take for lunch the next day. Hubs and toddler approved!

This was pretty good. I made it exactly as written and then added a teeny pinch of ground ginger just to give it a bit of spice. I'd make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

After making this over a dozen times, I couldn't help but think something was off.
I switched the ketchup and soy sauce quantities and used brown sugar instead of white. BOOM. Unreal.

I was looking for a sweet & sour sauce that didn't require pineapple. Like others, I used this as a jumping off point. My changes were as follows: 
1/2 c white sugar + 1/4 heaping cup brown sugar ; 1/3 c rice vinegar; 1/2 c water; 2T soy sauce; 1/3 c ketchup (this made the biggest difference, I think); 2T cornstarch mixed with 3T water, stirred into the rest of sauce ingredients after heating then simmered until thick. I served it over homemade turkey meatballs with stir fry veggies and white rice. It elicited a "TERRIFIC!" out of my 8 year old. I will definitely make again.

So I was planning on making sweet and sour chicken for dinner when I discovered that there was no sweet sauce!  I made this recipe with the following changes:  1/4 cup of ketchup, 2 tablespoons of molasses, 1/3 cup of apple cider vinegar (out of white vinegar), 1/2 cup of white sugar, and 1/2 cup of water.  (Also out of brown sugar and soy sauce.).  I brought all ingredients to a fast boil, then a slow boil.  Since I didn't thicken with corn starch or flour, it was a thin sauce.  However, since it was served over rice with diced chicken breast, green peppers, and onions, it was absorbed into the whole dish.  I may make this going forward, since I had all of the ingredients on hand.  We both enjoyed it!

This is an excellent base sauce.  I needed something that was quick and easy and made with general ingredients that everyone has in their pantry. This fit the ticket. of course I did change it a bit. I used a little less than a 1/8 cup Soy and an 1/8 cup Teriyaki sauce It came to about about a table spoon less than called for.(only because I didn't have enough Soy left and wanted to cut down the salt a little) Also I dice up 2 Peperoncini's and added them. It came out delicious.  As far as using this recipe again. Yes I will but I'll probably change it up a little again a little different tho. But That's just the way I am. I'm giving it 5 stars.

It was too dark ( too much soya sauce) and too thick (cornstarch).  Will try another recipe next time.

I made exactly as directed, and it was yummy!  For serving, I put some red pepper flakes on the table. Folks who like a little spice added red pepper flakes for an extra kick. But it was still great just as is.

I used low sodium soy sauce, otherwise kept the recipe as it was. A half batch in the microwave for two minutes, rest one minute, microwave two more minutes... Perfect last minute solution needed for my egg rolls. I will make this again!

Man man man this was sooooo good. I just made it right now with homemade veggie eggrolls. It was so good and I had no complaints. I doubled the recipe because I made 48 eggrolls. So good. Mines wasn't that thick though but the taste was perfect. I'll always use this recipe.

My fussy hubby loves restaurant sweet & sour sauce, and he was quite satisfied with this homemade version.  I made it as written and added it to a stir fry to coat everything before serving.  Mr. Picky-Picky had thirds, so I know it was a supreme hit.

I thought I had some sauce in the fridge but found out I was out when the chicken strips went into the oven.  I whipped this up and it was ready before the strips finished cooking. I followed suggestions from SHELS77 except I didn't have any pineapple juice.  I almost wish I hadn't put in quite that much ketchup and I used cornstarch instead of flour.  I would make this again, it's a qreat, inexpensive alternative.  Thanks!

I know other reviewers downgraded this recipe because of all the substitutions people used when they made this sauce. I gave this recipe five stars for this very same reason.  There aren't too many recipes around that you can mix up like this and receive satisfactory results.  
For instance, I didn't have pineapple juice so I used 1/3 cup of peach juice and 1/3 cup of water.  I also varied my sugars using 1/4 cup each of brown sugar, white sugar and honey. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Lastly, I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased my soy sauce to 1/8th cup.  This sauce turned out really good, far better than I expected.

I love this recipe. It's quite similar to the older style of s & s sauce that was a standard in US chinese restaurants in the 50's and 60's. I prefer it to the neon red overly sweet sauces used today. It's a bit pungent for some due to the vinegar. If you don't like it that way, add pinapple juice or switch the white to brown sugar as suggested in an earlier review. This will completely change the character of the sauce however so you might as well make the modern red sauce if you like it sweet.

We made it just as directed, but felt it was too runny and had a strong soy sauce flavor.  However, doubling the catsup & corn starch and adding about 1/4 tsp of ginger powder and garlic powder turned out perfectly.

I needed a quick recipe to go with my crab Rangoon recipe and rice. This was it! I cooked it exactly as is and let my husband try it seeing as he is the Asian cuisine expert in our family. He wanted it a tiny bit sweeter so I added 2 more tablespoons sugar and brought it back to a boil just long enough to melt the sugar. It was perfect for him them. I will be making this from now on. No more store bought sauce for us! My mind is wild with all the possibilities for using this sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the best. Just as good as Chinese place.  I added onions, red peppers and pork. Made egg drop soup go with an rice.

I really love this recipe! I have an old sweet and sour sauce recipe that was way too sweet and had a lot more ketchup.  The above recipe is so much better and not too sweet. Perfect! It will be my new go to recipe for s&s sauce.  Thank you for the recipe!

I rarely eat sweet and sour sauce, but tonight I had fixed a sub-par pineapple chicken dish that needed more sauce. I didn't have any more pineapple, so that is why I chose this particular recipe. It was good, and I certainly would fix it again mainly because it uses pantry staples.

The first time I used this recipe it was because I forgot to buy sweet and sour sauce. After I tasted it, I have never again bought sweet and sour sauce. I like that it is made from staples in my kitchen and the flavor is wonderful. My grandma is half Chinese and I have a Japanese aunt, so I grew up eating more Asian food than American food. I love it!

This was really average. Had to keep adding different quantities and still ended up not too flash. Was a bit flavourless, not really what I was expecting at all

Great, I loved it.  It was so quick and easy to make, tasted great, and stored well in the fridge.  The only change was to gradually stir in the cornstarch to avoid lumps.

We eat sweet and sour sauce over tofu with vegetables a lot. I like to try new sweet and sour sauces. We had this one tonight. This is a good one. It's a little plain. Simplicity is a good thing in this case though. I made a double batch and refrigerated more than half. We look forward to having it again soon. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I cut out all the extra sugar.  We use it to make pineapple chicken.  So we drain the pineapple, use the juice from the pineapple in substitute of the sugar and water in this recipe.  It's still extra delicious!

I have mango juice in the fridge. It is sweeter than pineapple juice and I'm going to try it. Probably going to use Teriyaki instead of soy sauce as it is less salty.

I was looking for a sweet and sour recipe that wasn't like the fake tasting stuff at fast food places. I can taste the dye and preservatives in those! This recipe, as it is written, is just sweet enough to enjoy... but without the problem of overpowering the flavors of whatever it is you want to pair this with. It is easy enough to make for me to toss together when popping frozen chicken nuggets in the oven for my kids, but tasty enough to put on top of my recipes that are more suitable for the adult palette. Home run on this one!

Made the recipe as is but for the vinegar.  I had no white vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar instead.  Throughout the meal, my husband and 22 year old son kept saying how good the sauce was.  My husband said, "This one's a keeper!".  Awesome, awesome, awesome.

Awesome recipe. I doubled the recipe and  used  1/2 Cup of brown sugar and 1 Cup of white sugar. I used pineapple juice in place of the water and 1/2 Cup of ketchup. Turned out awesome. This is a keeper.

A very good easy recipe. I did modify it, based on the comments of other reviewers, and I am glad I did. I did half white and half brown sugar, I used blended pineapple tidbits in their juices instead of water, I decreased the soya sauce by half and put 1/3 cup of ketchup. I also added a little ginger. I cooked all ingredients together first, before adding the corn starch, premixed with a little of the broth. Turned out very well, quite tasty.

Awesome! I looked at a few of the other reviews and added a little bit of brown sugar, and just small amount of honey.  Next time I'd try half as much white sugar, and substituting the other half with brown sugar.  Great recipe otherwise! :)

I did not care for this recipe. I expected something like what you can get at the restaurants, but I was sorely disappointed. All I could taste was the soy sauce. Tried it on crab rangoon and chicken.

This was soooo easy to make and was very good!  We did carry out and they left out my daughter's sweet/sour sauce.  Allrecipes to the rescue!  Within 5 minutes we'd put this sauce together and it was perfect on her sweet/sour shrimp.

Love this.  was so simple and had great flavor.  I liked it way better than the stuff you buy in a jar... and did I mention how simple it is?   Will be a staple in the fridge from this day forward.

This is a great recipe.  I did tweek it a bit. I used 1/8-1/4 cup of vinegar, 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup agave nectar. I will use 1/2 cup next time instead of white sugar,  1/4 cup pineapple juice instead of water.  It is much better than store bought sweet and sour.  Thanks for the recipe.

While very good, I changed up the recipe to use organic cider vinegar and organic cane sugar. I strive to use organic ingredients wherever possible.

This recipe was so easy.  I really liked the the ingredients were simple and I already had everything I needed.  I tried one of the other reviewers advice (part brown/part white sugar) and more ketchup but ended up starting over and following recipe step by step.  It turned out wonderful.  Cook time was a little longer than 10 minutes, but the consistency was perfect and the flavor was very good.  This one is a keeper (no more bottled for me!)

Hmm, not too impressed with this recipe but it's a good start; I added my own touch, a little bit of oyster sauce, to make it better. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this sauce about 5 times now. It's absolutely delicious, keeps well and is very, very easy to make. I usually add about a tablespoon of Hoisin sauce for extra flavour, but it's not necessary.

Excellent Sweet and Sour Sauce.  I used the pineapple juice from a can of pineapple bits, which I used in the stir-fry.  This is a keeper!

I had some stew meat laid out and i realized i didnt have the ingredients to make the stew! i was freaking out and i discovered this sauce recipe, it didnt take as long as it said, im not sure if its cuz i used 2 tbsp of flour instead of cornstarch. But the sauce is amazing, i hope it comes out good after the meat cooks.

Made a big batch of this sauce for 60 homemade eggrolls.  It was all gone in a matter of minutes.  I had no idea that sweet and sour sauce was so easy to make.  I will never buy it at the store again. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good!!! The key is to not try the sauce by itself because it is potent!! As soon as you add it to the stirfry veggie's...it's delicous!I did stirfy the veggie's in garlic, ginger and S+P before I added the sauce, just to add more of a flavour base...Yum Yum Yum

I love this sauce - but have also altered it a little - along with using brown sugar, and increasing the ketchup, I also use 1/2 rice vinegar instead of all white vinegar, and I add garlic and ginger. - awesome!

Yummy! I followed all the ingredients and measurements. But I only used 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and instead of water I used pineapple juice. I boiled one green bell pepper in the sauce, whisked the corn starch in, added pineapple chunks in the sauce. Poured the sauce over oven baked chicken breast and white rice. Thank you for a great S&S recipe.

I made a few changes because we are diabetic.  I used 1/2 c Splenda and 1/4 c Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, 1/4 c Ketchup, 1/4 c orange juice (that is what I had on hand) 1/4 c water, 1/4 c vinegar, 1/4 c low sodium soy sauce and 2 T flour (didn't have cornstarch).  It came out wonderful, however I think pineapple juice would have been better, or maybe a little less orange juice, b/c there was a very definite orange taste.  We LOVED this with our Chinese food!

Very yummy! I needed a "duck sauce" for egg rolls and this was the recipe that I had all the ingredients to make.  Next time I will try the brown sugar and use it over chicken, veggies and rice.  A definite keeper.

excellent recipe, my family expects me to make this everytime we need sweet and sour sauce.  I did sub orange juice for the water though, it made it more tangy which is a family preference.

I made it with a few alterations based on reviews.  I used half white sugar, half brown sugar, used cider vinegar, and extra ketchup.  end result isn't anything like a traditional sauce but wasn't bad.  When I tasted it before serving, I thought it would mess up my egg rolls but in the end it complimented it well.

I had struggled for well over an hour trying to make 2 other recipes that I had for sweet and sour sauce.  My husband reminded me as I was almost in tears,  to go to all recipes and find a different recipe. Well I found it! This recipe is quick and easy and tasted wonderful!  Thank you so much NAG_CA I will cherish this recipe.

Great! I halved the recipe and followed it exactly.  It's slightly more tangy then the red stuff you get from chinese restaurants but still very good.

This was not to my liking.  It was either too thin or tasty too starchy when I tried to thicken it.

This recipe is great. My friend and I decided to make it as topper on left over pork chops, and it was delicious. The only difference we made was by adding a little pineapple. It gave it a bit more zing and sweetness. This sauce also goes wonderful on rice, almost teriyaki reminiscent.

I followed this exactly as the recipe states and it was pretty good.  My DD liked it and it was her I made it for so mission complete.  I would like to try a few of the other recipes before I make this one again.

Excellent recipe.  I added a bit more ketchup as recommended in other reviews, and it was better than most sweet and sour sauces I get at local restaurants.  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you!

Tasted too much like soy sauce for my liking- everything else was good, consistency, easy to make.  Maybe just add less soy sauce & replace with pineapple juice or crushed pineapple.

This was absolutely good. I seared chicken breast strips in butter and garlic, and added this sauce to the skillet, simmered in the oven and served over jasmine rice.

This is definitely one of the best sweet and sour sauce recipes I've ever had.  I put meatballs in this and then tried it on ribs.  My husand even had the sauce over rice for dinner one night!  It is certainly versatile and I am anxious to try it on or with other things!

I was skeptical because the receipt didn't call for pineapple but it actually was pretty good. The ketchup was just the right amount to not make it taste like ketchup.  I give it 5 stars.

Family loved this great and quick recipe.  Little boys love sweet and sour chicken so I went ahead and made some chicken and used this sauce.  They loved the sauce and the chicken.  Will definitely add to our list of regulars.  Next time I may try it with a little less soy sauce.

Way to much vinegar and not enough ketchup! This was not really sweet and sour sauce that I am used to. I did managed to fix this by adding some more ketchup and sugar. I used 1/4 cup a ketchup, I highly suggest using more ketchup and cutting the vinegar in half unless you like runny sweet and sour sauce.

The sauce wasn't bad, but it tasted like it needed something to balance out the bitterness of the vinegar. I think there was definitely way too much vinegar in there. I did add the honey someone else suggested and it made it a lot better, but I don't think I'll make this recipe again.

This recipe complimented my chicken stir fry very well.  The only changes I made to the sauce was added about a tbsp of balsamic vinegar and about two tbsps of brown sugar --very delicious!

Really good and simple.  I agreed with some others that it had a bit too much soy sauce, so next time I'll probably half it.  Also, the addition of 1 Tbs. honey was good.  Thanks!

I would consider this more of a soy sauce than a sweet and sour sauce.  But it is convenient in that I had all the ingredients in my pantry.

Pretty good, it was a little sweet, so I will decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup next time as well as the soy sauce to 2 tbs.

I wanted s & s sauce with my chicken and realized I had no pineapple. This recipe was just what I needed, required no pineapple, and I had everything in my pantry! It tastes great!

My husband really didnt' like this, and I just thought it was okay.  I made it as-is, and should have followed suggestions of others to reduce the soy sauce.

Yum! So much better than that bright red stuff we get at the Chinese restaurant - and so EASY.  I will never but s&s souce again.  I did as another reviewer suggested, use brown sugar, more ketchup, and pineapple juice.  I also added the cornstarch (with water) after the mixture came to a boil.

Followed SHELS77 instructions. Way to much soy sauce for me. I added double of all the other ingrediants to fix the soy sauce problem. After that it was pretty good. Next time I will go with a tablespoon or two instead. Not quite resturant like but the kids loved it.

I used this to cook a ham in twice. EXCELLENT. I followed what others said and added more ketchup and and subbed half the white sugar with brown. I also tried this with the pineapple juice and found it almost too sweet. My daughter who east no sauce of any kind on anything loved it said it was the best ham I ever cooked.

This isn't your typical sweet and sour sauce, I think it's better. Although my boyfriend thought it would have been better with pineapple juice, I liked it as is. I followed one reviewers suggestion using extra ketchup, subbing some brown sugar for white and I also added a couple squirts of lemon juice and a little extra soy. Almost had a sweet/sour/teriyaki taste. Awesome! It thickened well before putting the starch water in because of the sugars. Next time I may use splenda for the white sug. and use more starch water if needed for thickening to save me from all that sugar!

This sauce is good, but it just didn't taste like "sweet and sour" sauce to me, because the soy sauce flavor was so overpowering. However, it was still tasty, and wonderful with our homemade egg rolls, so I gave it 4 stars. I tried the recipe again, cutting the soy sauce down to just a splash, adding a touch more ketchup, and some red gel food coloring (just to make it like the pretty red sauce at our fav chinese restaurant) and that was MUCH closer to the sweet and sour sauce that we love!

Yum. Enough said! Made this with the sweet and sour pork patties from this site. Kids (4 of them-- 1yr to 7 yrs) and hubby gobbled them up! Ate them with rice and green beans.

Love this sauce.  Make it simply as is, throw it all in and stir.  So easy and tastier than a bottled version.  For more flavor, I sometimes add red pepper flakes.

Fabulous!  I think that this is even better than what I get in Asian restaurants (of course we don't have very good Asian restaurants in our area). I halved this recipe as I wasn't sure if we would use all the sauce but now I wish I had made a full batch.  I did add about 1 tsp. of toasted sesame seeds and about 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes.  I should have taken Sconnie's advice and mixed the ketchup with the water as the ketchup didn't dissolve but no one complained. I served these with Pot Stickers Traditional (also highly recommend).  I will be making this again soon.  Thank you Linda!

Loved this recipe. I did cut back on the soya sauce like others recommended and added a few drops of red food coolering, other than that wouldn't change a thing! Delicious!

Great sauce. Used a low sodium soy sauce so it wouldn't taste as salty. Went well with crab rangoon.

Found this just ok, my son-in-law makes a great sweet and sour sauce but won't share his recipe.  This just lacks something.  Thanks for sharing.

This turned out really well for a quick, easy sweet and sour sauce.  Needed something last minute for the egg rolls that were cooking in the oven and this fit the bill perfectly - thanks!

This was really good, I made some minor substitutions. I used brown sugar, since I was out of white and apple cider vinegar. I served it over meatballs and rice, my oldest raved about it.

I love this sauce but I did cut back on the soy sauce. Plus I added a couple slices of carrot, bell pepper, onion and a couple of pineapple chunks.  It taste is really good amd it goes well with chicken, egg rolls, meatballs, and pork.

Perfect sauce, nice and dark and tangy, not too sweet!  Loved it, I will keep this one.

How strange...the whole family loved something for a change !Made the sauce and served it over sliced pork tenderloin , sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds , added some spring rolls and shrimp fried rice. Served the leftover sauce on the side for dipping. wonderful and easy,easy,easy!
