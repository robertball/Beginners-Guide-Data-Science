This is a phenomenal recipe--one of my favorites so far from this site.  I did tweak it just a little.  I used a little over 2 lbs of lean ground beef cause that's what I had.  I used 1 cup of italian seasoned bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of sphagetti sauce instead of the ketchup.  I also used the diced tomatoes with garlic and onion.  This made 2 meat loaves for me.  The texture was perfect; moist but held together well and the flavor was amazing.  I served it with bowtie pasta tossed with parmesan and the rest of the jar of spaghetti sauce, garlic bread and steamed veggies.  This was an easy and delicious meal that my family loved!  Thanks for the great recipe.

HOLY COW! This is a fantastic meatloaf recipe. Do yourself a favor though. Use a non-stick meatloaf pan with a drainage insert so as to allow the grease from the hamburger and water from the toms to escape. Otherwise, it'll end up too moist to the point of falling apart. I baked mine for about 1:20, removing the foil and frosting the top with ketchup the last ten minutes. Served with egg noodles, buttered with parsley and Parmesan cheese, outstanding!

This meatloaf was delicious- the best I've ever had!  Along with others who left comments, I made some adjustments.  I used italian-style bread crumbs, canned tomatoes with garlic & onion, chunky pasta sauce instead of ketchup and added 1tsp dried parsley and a pinch of crushed black pepper.  In addition, for the last 10 minutes of bake time I spread some pasta sauce atop the meatloaf and sprinkled it with grated parmesean.  Served with garlic-parmesean mashed redskins and green beans.  Buon appetito!

Omgosh this is delicious.  I used whole peeled tomatoes instead of diced because that's what I had on hand.   I used 93 % ground beef and it was still so moist.  I also added a bit of parmesan cheese.  I had to cook it a bit longer too.    It was the best meatloaf I've had in a while.  My extremely picky daughter even ate it all up.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I will replace my old meatloaf recipe w/ this one. I too used Italian bread crumbs, cooked it for 1 1/2 hr w/ the last 20 minutes uncovered, & sprinkled Mozzarella on top for the last 5 minutes of baking. My husband said it made the best meatloaf sandwich he's ever eaten.

We love this recipe!!

I use only half of the diced tomatoes, it seemed a little soupy.  I also have a hard time getting it all to fit in one pan, I usually split it and make two smaller loaves.

I use the Brown Sugar Meatloaf recipe from this site as my "regular" meatloaf, but thought that I would try this one out.  I was a bit disappointed with it.  I do agree with another reviewer to cut down on some of the spices...it overpowered it a bit.  I wish I knew why this wasn't as good as I had hoped.  Thanks for the post anyway.

This meatloaf recipe is great!  The Italian style versus the American Meatloaf!  

I do tweak it one tiny bit.  Instead of the diced tomato in the meatloaf, I use a can of tomato soup with about 1/2 cup of water and spoon over the meatloaf when it's about 3/4 done.  It makes the most delicous gravy!

When doing this, you need to form the loaf and cook it in a casserole dish that can accomodate the gravy around the loaf.

This recipe was fabulous.  My husband is an excellent chef, so it's very intimidating to cook for him.  I made this for him and he absolutely loved it!!!!!  Thank you sooooo much.

This was a really good meatloaf... with the spices called for, you definitely taste the Italian seasoning. I have a rotation of a few different meatloaf recipes I use, but this is the first I've tried with an Italian flavor. The only thing I'd recommend is using "petite diced" tomatoes instead of the regular ones. The petite diced blend better into the meat and you get more tomato taste in each bite. Also, forget the loaf pan and just free form it into a loaf, then bake on a broiler style pan so the grease has a place to drain off. When you use a loaf pan for meatloaves, the meat just sits and soaks in all that nasty grease.

You know me.  I'm the woman whose meatloaf used to clear a room!  The announcement of "Tonight's meatloaf night" always elicited the response of, "I have plans tonight."  "I'm eating at my friends house!"  "Meatloaf!  AGAIN!"
Tonight I made THIS meatloaf and they were begging me for more!  "When are we having this again?"  "Tomorrow?"  
This was absolutely the best meatloaf I've ever tasted!  I also used spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup, Italian breadcrumbs and instead of garlic salt, I used minced garlic.  I also didn't use the basil, or oregano since I used diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano and my spaghetti sauce had garlic and onions in it.  I did, however use the Italian seasoning and that was perfect!
I also added Parmesan cheese, baked it for 1 hr and 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of cooking time, I removed the foil and sprinkled some leftover moz cheese on the top.  SUPREMO!!!  And it didn't need onions, BTW.  Just fine, moist and tasty without them.
Thanks for this recipe!  It's definately replacing to old, dry boring one I used to use!
I'm adding this little addendum after reading a recipe here for onion encrusted meatloaf and decided I'm going to try the Italian Meatloaf I and just top with french fried onions.  I think they just made Heaven BETTER!!!

I've been making this for the last year and a half at least.  It's a family favorite!  I ALWAYS double the recipe.  I sub 1/3 of the beef for sweet italian sausage (casings removed and just mixed in).  Once in the loaf pan I cover it with a thin layer of ketchup and a layer of provalone slices or italian blend shredded cheese.  I baked it loosely covered with alunimum foil for 50 mins, remove the foil and continue baking for another 15 mins or so.  We LOVE this recipe!

This turned out very tasty. It was really moist, even with me using a very low fat organic ground beef.  I added some shredded parmesan and cut two slices of mozzarella into small cubes. This made for a few gooey cheese morsels in the loaf! Yummy. I would recommend draining the loaf at least once during cooking to get rid of some of the extra oils/fat. I topped mine with a layer of tomato sauce and some more shredded parm. Served it up with organic mashed potatoes and organic corn. Great winter meal!

I love this.  I have used oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs and a pinch of red pepper flakes, ok more than a pinch because I like a kick to my food. I always get compliments from the family which doesn't happen often.

I tried this recipe after talking to a friend who also tried it and liked it.  It was good, but not WOW.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and Italian style diced tomatoes to add more flavor, but it still tasted a bit bland for my liking.  I found that you need to use a very lean ground beef or ground turkey or else your loaf will be greasy (yuck!).  Perhaps, covering the meatloaf with tomato sauce would jazz it up a bit.  I think this meatloaf tasted GREAT the next day because the seasonings had a chance to blend (I will prepare the loaf a day ahead next time for this reason).  I served leftover slices on homestyle bread with a slice of cheddar cheese, romaine lettuce and some ketchup for lunch the next day.  As a meal, this dish went well with hash brown potato casserole (in the "favorites" book and on this website), creamy pea salad (i.e. a mixture of peas, bacon, red onion, cheddar cheese and mayonnaise) and tiramisu for dessert.  It would also go well with mashed potatoes and cut green beans for a quick weeknight meal.  I'll definitely make this again, with modifications. Thanks!

Made this with ground turkey instead of ground beef, and used canned tomatos with green chilies for some spiciness.  Very good, but still felt like it was missing something.........

I used homemade seasoned bread crumbs and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I made no other changes. I did cook this in my Perfect Meatloaf Pan, mine was done at 80 minutes. My family liked this--it held up well and didn't fall apart. He did say this would be good with a little italian sausage. MAKES GREAT SANDWICHES (my husband made one in the middle of the night--he told me this morning)

I made this for my family tonight. As we ate they all spent the whole dinner telling me how delicious it was. My two kids gave it 5 stars and my 18 month old who won't eat meat ate every bite on his plate and asked for more! My hubby doesn't usually like meatloaf but he said "wow babe! This is amazing!"  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great deviation from the normal boring meatloaf.  I used sausage and pepper spaghetti sauce in place of the ketchup, used a can of crushed tomatoes, and used more cheese than what was called for.  I also topped the meatloaf with some of the spaghetti sauce before baking.

First of all, I am not a meatloaf lover. But decided to see if this one was as good as most of the reviews. It was excellent! I made one small change and used hot and spicy catsup. I cooked it an hour and 20 minutes, draining off the liquid half way through. I will definitely be making this again.

Not bad..only recommendation I would make is cut back on the oregano and basil by about 1/4-1/2 of what the recipe calls for..they were a tad overwhelming. Overall it was pretty good.

Exceeded my expectations. Even after reading the reviews, I was skeptical that it would be as good as everyone said. It's just meatloaf, right? But, really, this was SO good. My picky 3 year old even ate it. My 1 year old gobbled up seconds, and I had it reheated for dinner tonight, even better! Just don't add any more oregano than is called for, it'll be too over powering. I didn't have diced tomatoes, so I subbed a can of stewed tomatoes. Ate with mashed potatoes and steamed corn. A keeper, for sure! Also, I baked mine for an hour and 20 minutes, and drained the grease half way through baking, otherwise it would have run over and spilled all over my oven!

This was awesome, Thank you so much for sharing, I also changed just a little I used 1lb gr chuck and 1lb gr pork, used tomato sauce instead of ketchup and 1 cup italian bread crumbs, I udidnt have garlic salt so I used garlic powder, also added salt and pepper. made 2 loaves so I could freeze one for another time, super moist yet still held together nicely, my picky eater loved it. again thanks, will definetly do this recipe again!

I hate to say it, but this just was not very good.  I checked over the recipe just to be sure I didn't miss something.  I found it to have a very mushy texture and the taste was relatively bland.  I was so disappointed because I thought it would be a great recipe!  No need for us to try something different, it's definitely not a keeper for us!

I tried this recipe and loved it!  Unlike some of the other people who tried and reviewed this recipe, I made it according to the original recipe and only substituted my home made marinara sauce for ketchup.  I could not understand how some of the people could change the recipe so much and then complain that it did not meet with their expectations!  Do you think it could have been due to the fact that you did not make this recipe!!!!

We loved this! The only thing I did differently was use saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs. Mine wasn't mushy at all...maybe because I drained the juice out of the tomatoes? Plus, I baked on top of a couple of slices of white bread so it wasn't wallowing in beef fat. Will definitely have this again! We ate it with a salad and the 'toasted garlic bread from this site.

Ehh, it was okay.  Then again, I'm not a big meatloaf fan, however, my husband is.  He gives this a 3 1/2 star rating so I had to bump it up to 4.

Delicious! What a great change from the traditional meatloaf.  This will be a family favorite. All of my kids,ages 8,5,14 months, ate it up.  I followed the recipe exactly except used 2 lbs meat only because that is what I had on hand. For the tomatoes I used the canned petite diced, the tomatoes were small enough to not make my kids want to pick them out. 
  I served this with Campanelle pasta (made by Barilla and it's a fun shape for kids) with butter and lots of parmesan cheese, and also made a fruit salad  to break up all the salty flavors.  Thanks for the  fantastic recipe!

I am very picky about meatloaf, and I usually end up going back to my same boring recipe...until now.  This was the best meatloaf I have made, and it was enjoyed by my entire family.  I will definitely be making this again!!

I make this meatloaf all the time, but I substitute ketchup for Ragu six cheese spaghetti sauce.  Delicious!  I bake for 45 minutes at 375 and then top with another layer of spaghetti sauce and sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top and then bake for 5 more minutes.  My fiance doesn't like meatloaf but he always wants a second helping of this!

I've made this twice now and think it's one of the best tasting meatloaf recipes yet.  I used italian style bread crumbs and italian diced tomatoes and 2 lbs ground chuck (put it in 2 loaf pans) I cooked it one hour covered and then 20-25 minutes uncovered and they came out perfect.  Not mushy at all.

This recipe is delicious.  I changed it a bit, by adding sauteed green pepper and scallions; lightening up the seasoning and using some other seasonings, too.  I also heeded the other reviewers suggestions with the longer cook time (about 1 1/2 hours) and uncovering it for the last ten minutes and putting ketchup on top. I also made a beef gravy that covered it for serving and eating.

Made just a couple of changes. I added a can of diced tomatos (drained), like some other reviewers did. I drizzeled about half a jar of marinara over the top. Awesome!

This was amazing!!! It was delicious,definitely a keeper. However,because I had a bit over 2 pounds of meat I kept it in the oven for 1 1/2 hours..the last ten minutes I put ketchup on it and put it back in the oven..otherwise I just added more seasoning and put 3 eggs and 2 cans diced tomatoes

We always rate our new meals and my family gave this 8-10 stars.  I did delete the canned tomatoes and used 1/2 ground turkey.  I subbed provolone for the mozzarella for a little more flavor.  Even my meatloaf hater gave it 8 stars.

We thought this was a good meatloaf, but the fiance said he thought it should taste more tomato saucy.  I actually used tomato sauce instead of ketchup, but I guess it wasn't enough!  Thanks for a nice change, but I don't think this will be our new "go to" meatloaf recipe.

Tasty but a bit TOO moist. I would recommend removing the covering 1/2 way through  to try to let some of the moisture out. Otherwise, very tasty!

This was pretty good, but not great. I wouldn't mind putting in some green peppers or something so it's a bit healthier. But it's delicious with noodles, bread, and big salad to balance it out!

My son is not a Meatloaf fan. I tried this reciepe and he actually loves it, thanks. I did make a few adjustments. I used a can of Italian Diced Tomatoes and I used shredded Colby & Monterey Jack Cheese instead of the Mozzarella. I also added cooked Bacon. I will make this again.

My family loved this!  The only changes I made:  italian bread crumbs and omited the oregano and basil. Also, I added ital. stewed tomatoes instead of regular plus garlic powder, worchestershire sauce, and a little bit of steak sauce.  I topped the meatloaf with a glaze made with roasted garlic tomato sauce, ketchup and a small amount of brown sugar.  Plus, saved some of this sauce to serve...Enjoy!

This was so delicious! My husband & boys thought it was my best meatloaf EVER! I did not have mozzarella but I had some pesto jack. This would make yummy meatballs also. I made angel hair pasta with the sauce from the Shrimp Lemon Pepper Linguine recipe (sans shrimp)and Ceasar salad. Yummy!

I've been looking for something other than the traditional meatloaf and decided to try this one.   My husband absolutely despises ketchup so I substituted chunky spaghetti sauce as another review suggested.   I do not have a meatloaf pan so I formed a larger loaf (about 10 x 6 x 2) and baked it on a foil lined jelly roll pan.  It turned out moist and delicious.   Husband ate a second helping and said a couple of times that it was really good.  Served it with angel hair pasta with butter and parmesan along with a bakery garlic loaf.  This will be a keeper for us.

A very different twist on meatloaf! I splashed a little worscheser sauce into it, and forgot the garlic powder. (I thought it had enough salt into it from the canned tomatoes) It smelled like pizza, and it was done 1hr 10 mins. Very moist and lots of flavor, husband wasn't in the mood for meatloaf, but was glad I made it. Thank you!

Really tasty meatloaf.  Used spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup and left out the tomatos.  Forgot to add the cheese to the meat, so melted it on top instead.  Also sauteed a small onion to add to the meat and used a large clove of garlic instead of the garlic salt.  Baked on a broiler pan to let the grease drain through.  Didn't make a super-firm meatloaf, but the flavor was very good.

Hubby says it is a keeper!  I substituted what I had on hand, using fresh tomatos (4 small tomatoes - Roma) instead of the canned ones and made due with 1 pound of ground beef.  Also, I used some Arrabiata sauce from a jar in lieu of the ketchup.  The last alteration I made was to divide it between 8 muffin cups.  It reached 160 degrees in the center of the "mini loaves" quite quickly and turned out perfectly.  I served it with the remaining Arrabiata sauce and penne pasta.  The result almost perfectly mirrored my favorite restaurant Italian meatloaf.

We have never been meatloaf people and this was my first time making one.  Great recipe!  Will make again and again.  I added two gloves minced garlic, a half of diced onions, and parmesan cheese.  I also used diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of regular.  Very flavorful!

This is a tasty meatloaf recipe. I agree with one of the other reviewers that it was a little greasy. Next time I make it I'll drain the grease half way through.

This was great!  Made as directed. As other reviewers stated the spices were a little over powering so next time I'll probably cut back a little bit.  All in all though, the entire family loved it. Doubled the recipe for plenty of left overs. Sent some home with my 23yr old son and his roommates loved it too. He told me to be sure to keep this recipe...and he never comments on my cooking.  Thanks for a new family favorite.

This was good but my version is better. I use tomato sauce with garlic because I
thing it holds together better than with tomatoes. I use 3/4 the can and then add the rest on top of the meatloaf. For those that said it was missing something.....it is! ONIONS.....You can't have meatloaf without adding onions! Thus only 4 stars.

Oh my gosh so good.  I used 1.27 pounds of ground chuck.  Really really drained the diced tomatoes and reduced basil and oregano to 1/2 tsp.  Only put 1 cup of mozzarella in the meat loaf and topped it with the other 1/2 cup for the last 10 minutes.  Instead of ketchup, I used pizza sauce.  THIS IS A KEEPER!

I really like this meatloaf. I added finely chopped onions and green peppers and ended up using less then the full can of tomatoes.  Also used a bit more bread crumbs and used a bit more Italian seasoning. Also added black pepper and cayenne and that worked great. The ground beef was 80/20, and it worked fine for a moist but not too greasy loaf. Not sure that the mozzarella is worth it. I couldn't really notice it inside the loaf and any that ended up on the outside melted and made a mess. Maybe adding the cheese in larger chunks inside the roll, or simply as a topping in slices would work better.  I cooked this the way I do all meatloaf; uncovered, on an oiled broiler pan, with foil on the bottom of the pan for easy cleanup. I like the brown outside and the excess grease drips down. Smelled fantastic while cooking, and the leftovers rock! Served with mashed potatoes that had parmesan added. I'll be keeping this meatloaf recipe.

This was so, so good, and I added a can of drained mushrooms too.  To make it even better, I use Italian-style bread crumbs and marinara sauce in place of the ketchup.  Not only was it good the first day, it made great sandwiches for work the next day!

I liked this a lot but don't think my husband liked it as much as me.  I followed the directions exactly except like other reviewers added ketchup to the top and cooked it for about 10 more minutes.  I liked the herbs in it and didn't think they were overpowering at all.  I put it on a rack over a glass baking dish and put that on a baking sheet.  It did drip a lot so I was glad I did that.

I would love to rate this a 5, but I had a little bit of a hard time getting the middle to cook.  I drained the loaf after the hour and then cooked it for 15 mins. more.  I added seasoned bread crumbs and tomatoes.  My husband and I really loved this.  I will be making this again.

I found that this recipe produced a rather bland meatloaf.   My suggestions would be to cut the bread crumbs in half and double the garlic.   And possibly add something to give it more of a bite.

YUM! We loved this. I drained my tomatoes *really* well and added garlic & onion powders. I had a little bit of pasta sauce that needed to be used up, so I replaced the ketchup with that. I drained it several times during baking and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving. Held together nicely. Thanks! :)

I made this for my husband and it was wonderful!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I did add a layer of mozzarella cheese in the middle of the loaf for an extra cheesy surprise inside.  I will definitely make this again!

Tried this recipe today and it was delicious.  I did as other reviewers had suggested and used Italian bread crumbs, and spagetti sauce instead of ketchup.  I didn't have mozzarella on hand so I used parmesan. After 45 min. of cooking I removed the foil and painted the meatloaf with some of the spagetti  sauce for the last 15 min. of cooking.  My husband doesn't eat groung beef, he tried the meat loaf and guess what, He went back for seconds.  This is a keeper.

This meatloaf was way toooo mushy.  I even took the grease out of the pan as it was cooking as one reviewer suggested.  I think if you don't add the canned tomatoes, it could be much better.  Not what I was looking for at all in a meatloaf dish.

I made this recipe to a "T" except I didn't have italian seasoning. I just upped the others a slight bit. My loaf fell apart when I tried to cut it and I let it rest at least 15 minutes. It just seemed to moist. I did drain the tomatoes. I also put two slices of bread underneath the loaf (a little trick I use) and it soaked up almost all of the grease. The flavor was okay but my bf said it wasn't the best meatloaf I had made. I think we're just used to good ole American meatloaf. I doubt I'll make again. Not worth all the extra calories with the cheese in it.

This took a fair amount longer than one hour to cook.  Maybe 90 minutes.  This is without a doubt the best meatloaf I have ever made. My wife says it is the best she has ever eaten, and NOBODY cooks better than she, so it was high praise indeed!!

After reading reviews, I formed a loaf and placed it in a broiling pan to drain as it cooked.  I followed the recipe exactly, but added chopped onions.  This meatloaf was MUSHY.  The flavor okay, but I don't know what the cheese added other than calories.  If I can give you just one tip, just use 1 egg!  It's the 2 eggs that made it mushy.  By the way, I baked it at 375 for an hour, fifteen minutes.

This was a good meatloaf with lots of flavor.  I had to cook it longer than an hour so that it wouldn't fall apart when I removed it from the pan, but after adding some cooking time, it presented nicely and was yummy.  I will probably make this recipe again in the future.

The flavor of this is wonderful but very strong. I used italian bread crumbs and wont do that again. Also it is a very VERY wet meatloaf and takes much longer to cook than expected. DRAIN well the tomatoes and it is just wonderful.
Will make this again.

This was a good meatloaf.  Husband liked it.  We used fresh diced tomatoes instead of the canned and like many suggested, baked it without the foil.  It was very good, and everyone had two helpings, but it was not the best meatloaf we have ever tried.  We will make it again for sure though!  Easy!

This meatloaf is yummy, very moist. My husband  loved it. Our daughter-in-law was here at lunch today she asked for the recipe . Like she said it would also make good meat balls. I did use italian style bread crumbs & used less spices.also put a Catsup, Brown sugar & mustard glaze on top. Very good.

So good! Best meatloaf ever. I could eat this weekly. Didn't have Italian seasoning, but i used Italian breadcrumbs. Didn't have the exact shredded cheese it called for, so i used Colby or something... doesn't matter, it would be delicious with any! And I used stewed tomatoes. Think I added mushrooms as well.

Delicious! Different, in a good way. Lots of flavor. My boyfriend happily ate the leftovers at work for a week. I did not even add any sauce on top, didn't think it needed it. Served with roast baby potatoes and steamed green beans. 
2 things: I realized too late that I did not have eggs, so I added 1/2c oats with water to moisten and I think that made it even better! I also subbed pasta sauce for the ketchup.

Fantastic recipie! My mother, who announced that she does NOT eat meatloaf actually had second helpings! I used diced Italian tomatoes and left some of the spices. I formed it into a loaf and covered it with tinfoil for the first half hour to get the shape and cooked it in a deep dish and cooked my veggies next to it in the yummy juices.

Absolutely delicious!  I increased the hamburger to 2 lbs and the bread crumbs and mozzarella to 1 cup and 2 cups respectively.  The I made two small loaves and froze one for later.  Easy and a nice twist on a traditional favorite.

WOW!....If you are making this, then you are going to make people happy! This recipe had my little brother coming back for seconds. It does need a little tweeking though, i found that cooking 70 minutes nailed it! I took it out in the middle of cooking and sucked the oil out around the meatloaf with a baster and basted the top with red sauce :) then for the last 20 minutes i left it uncovered and the last 5 minutes sprinkled cheese all over the top. I also would consider this a kid/picky eater friendly recipe because theres no onions or peppers ect, next time i will also use 2 eggs instead so it will hold together better.

My family loved this meatloaf ..my only changes was to use whole wheat bread crumbs, fire roasted diced tomatoes, low fat mozzarella cheese and also added bout 1/4c of pecorino romano and some fresh chopped parsley. My daughter said it tasted like a big meatball! Great meatloaf that smelled amazing while cooking. Thanks!

I HATE meatloaf, but I love this recipe! My husband likes meatloaf, so I needed to find a meatloaf recipe we both would like. This did the trick! At first, I thought it was going to taste like a giant meatball, but it really tastes like meatloaf, just more flavorful.

This is definitely a keeper!  My husband loved it.  The bread crumbs I had on hand were Italian, so I left out the Italian seasoning.  As another reviewer suggested, I used spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup.  My can of diced tomatoes were seasoned with oregano, basil, and garlic.  Not only was it delicious for dinner, the leftovers made tasty meatloaf sandwiches with provolone cheese and a little extra spaghetti sauce on a toasted hoagie bun.

I thought this had an excellent flavor.  The only change I made was to use seasoned bread crumbs.  My only complaint, and the reason I can't give 5 stars, is that this didn't set up properly.  It was a little too wet and not easy to slice; I thought my tomatoes were well drained, but perhaps I will try draining them longer next time.  Thanks for sharing - this is a keeper.

I cooked it exactly as it said.  It was just o.k. There wasn't a WOW factor.  Felt it was a bit bland with a extra kick of italian seasoning.  I have tried numerous recipes on this site and have tasted much much better.  Don't think I'll be making this one again.

My husband and I thought this was very good.  Although I scaled back most the main ingredients I used the original amount of spice and it tasted good, may suggest adding some fresh garlic as well.  This was very easy to make, Thank-You!

VERY good recipe.  I don't love tradtional meatloaf, but I made this for Father's Day and we all loved it!  Next time I will cut the spices in half though.  I love bold flavor in everthing, but the seasoning was a bit much.  Otherwise, this was perfect and delicious!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This meatloaf receipe was great!! I didnt have a can of tomatoes on hand so I omitted them and the recipe turned out just right, also instead of using the fresh herbs I used italian seasoning (it comes in a shaker) excellent!  It also saved time and money. Oh and I put ketchup on the top right before it came out the oven.. 5 stars!!!!!

My husband liked this dish a lot but it did not do anything for me. I did not care for the texture at all. It was too mushy and I had even added about 3/4 cup more breadcrumbs. The tomatoes did freak my husband out thinking it was hunks of raw meat. It was different but I will stick to my good ole' meatloaf recipe on the back of my Lipton onion soup mix box!

i love salt and my husband and i love bold flavorful dishes but the seasonings overpowered the recipe and i had 2 pounds of meat. even with more meat and the same measurements for the seasoning, it was too much. next time i make it i will scale back on the spices especially the garlic salt, then this will be a spectacular recipe.

Ok I veered from the original because the recipe had the basic things I had on hand.  I used Italian bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon of Good Seasons Mild Italian, diced tomatoes with oregano, basil and garlic all ready in it, so I cut the basil and oregano to 1/2 teaspoon, I also used garlic powder since I had no garlic salt.  My family who hates meatloaf ate this up and had it for lunch the next day!  TIP: mix together the night before to get the flavors to meld.

Wow!  Thank you - GREAT meatloaf.  I'm not sure why some reviewers said this was too soupy or wet .. I put the tomatoes into a colander, drained them well (even sqeezed them a bit with the back of a spoon) and reserved the liquid because, frankly, this meatloaf seemed really stiff when I put it together.  I added back in 1/4 C of the juice instead of the ketchup and used a bit more to baste the meatloaf during the last 1/2 hour.  Really good!  
It did take almost 2 hours to bake as a single loaf - so I'll break it into 2 loaves next time - and there will be a next time.
Thanks again!
(note - I also had the basil/oregano/garlic tomatoes, so left out the basil and oregano and used the italian seasoning and garlic salt, but will use them next time)

Absolutely fabulous.    Just the right amount of herbs.  I could really taste the basil.  It added a sweetness, and the cheese and diced tomatoes made it so moist.  I followed the recipe exactly (which I rarely do) and I would not change a thing.  Just an extra 15 minutes and it was perfect!!!! Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

Based on other reviews and my personal instinct, I cut the spice amounts by more than half.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  The flavor was fine, nothing amazing, but the consistency of the loaf really turned me off.  Way too mushy and wet.  Plus, the diced tomatoes made it look like there were bits of raw meat throughout.  I'll try other meat loaf recipes rather than make this one again.

This was good meatloaf.  I expect it to be even better tomorrow.  I added a little Lawry's to the meat and used the drained juice from the tomatoes to make a tomato gravy.  We liked it a lot.

This turned out on the mushy side. I sliced up the meatloaf and turned them mushy side up under the broiler to get them browned. Next time I'm going to leave out the diced tomatoes and bake them into smaller loaves or muffins. I also added 1/4 cup sauteed onions to the meat mix.

I used diced tomatoes w/garlic and onion, italian bread crumbs, chopped garlic instead of garlic salt and pasta sauce.  My husband loved it...better than the standard that I usually make.  I didn't use a meatloaf pan, but a regular stoneware baking dish and drained it a few times during cooking.  Will definitely make it again - it was good and easy!

My kids said that it was "Awesome", "Super" I thought it needed something. It was very easy to assemble and just pop in the oven.

Very good recipe. My family loved it and they are not big meatloaf fans.
I did change a couple of things because I used what I had on hand.  I replaced the tomatoes with a 14oz jar of pizza sauce. I also used 2lbs of 96% lean ground beef. I increased the bread crumbs to 1 cup and used italian bread crumbs.  I also replaced the ketchup with 8 ounces of italian tomatoe sauce.

Excellent! I loved this recipe, I cooked it about 20 minutes longer and did not cover. I thought the spices were great, I did not find them overpowering at all. Hubby gave it an A+

This is a good recipe, but I found the need to make a few changes.  First, I used 2 pounds of ground chuck.  I increased the bread crumbs to 1 cup and I used seasoned ones.  I might even increase this the next time I make this to 1 1/4 cup.  I used half the diced tomates which I drained extremely well.  Because we like spicy food, I increased the spices used except for the salt.  I baked my meatloaf uncovered in a 13x9 pan.  I just shaped it in a loaf shape.  This worked very well.  Because of the earlier reviews, I was afraid that it might just boil if I covered it in a loaf pan.  I also put a little ketchep on top and sprinkled a bit of cheese before baking.  It took about an hour and 20 minutes to bake. My husband and I both enjoyed this meatloaf and the leftovers make great sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe!  I plan to make it often.

Great recipe! I'm not a big ketchup fan so I used spagetti sauce instead, it was great.  I rolled the meatloaf out and rolled the cheese up in the center and toppped it with more spagetti sauce, cheese and mushrooms. I cooked spagetti and served the meatloaf "roll" sliced on top of the spagetti topped with more spagetti sauce. It looked really nice. And the crowd went wild. I have a family of picky eaters, so it was nice to hear rave reviews all the way around. Thank you Stefanie.

I made this last night and was VERY impressed. It was so different from a typical meat loaft. I am doing weight watchers, so I adjusted the ingredients to suit my needs. I used extra lean ground beef, egg beaters, and fat free cheese, and it was still tasty. Ended up only being 4.25 points per serving for any of you who are following the WW plan. I would probably add just a little more ketchup the next time, but other than that, VERY TASTY.

What an amazing meatloaf!  The only thing I did differently was to use two teaspoons of Italian-style seasoning and leave out the oregano and basil (I didn't have any).  Plus my diced tomatoes were the Italian flavored kind.  Then on top of the meatloaf before I baked it, I added a layer of ketchup and a extra sprinkle of mozzarella cheese (this was mostly for looks).  The meatloaf tastes amazing and even my husband and father (who are both known for disliking meatloaf) have requested this night after night.  They can't get enough of it!

In my first attempt to make meatloaf, I found this recipe to be a winner!  My family loved it and found it to be very filling as well as tasty.  I left out the tomatoes since we don't eat them, and used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain.  I will definitely make this again!  It was easy to prepare and wonderful to just stick in the oven and relax.  Moist and delicious!

I was looking for a meatloaf with a brown gravy sauce and couldn't find one.  When I spotted this I decided to improvise since I like the spices being used.  I knew what I wanted so what I changed was - I omitted the cheese, ketchup and canned tomatoes - mixed the meatloaf, using all the spices, bread crumbs, only 1 egg and about some of the jarred mushroom gravy I was using for the top.  Formed the meatloaf, put holes in the top with my finger and poured over the remainder of the mushroom gravy.  Served it with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  It was a hit.  I will try this recipe as it is - it sounds good - but as I said - I was in the mood for a meatloaf with brown gravy.  Thanks Stefanie!!

Not good. I'm sorry but I really did not like this recipe at all. This was the first time I made this dish and I thought it was really bad. It was too moist and too much tomatoes. All I could taste was the tomatoes not the meat. I will never make this again.

I made this meatloaf last night and it was very yummy--the spices, tomatoes, and cheese made a superb combination. However, I do think that I could have left the foil off; it was slightly too moist. All in all, for the first meatloaf I've ever made it was a great choice.

I am not a meatloaf lover, but my fiance is - so I make it every now and again.  This time I thought I would try a new recipe.  When I found this recipe I thought it would be a interesting twist so I decided to try it.  And I LOVED it !  It was extremely tasty !!!  I decided to use only half of the can of tomatoes in the meatloaf.  Also, I used a square pyrex dish instead of a loaf pan and molded half of the meat into an oval mound.  Next I added a layer of cheese and the the rest of the meat.  Last, I poured the other half of the tomatoes on top.  This is by far the best meatloaf I have ever had - I plan on added this recipe to my regular rotation.  Happy Cooking :-)

This was very flavorful, but was a bit loose.  We like a real firm meatloaf.  I've made it many times but add 1/2 of the tomatoes and cheese, and add garlic cloves instead of garlic salt. I also do not cover the meatloaf in the oven.  A very tasty meatloaf for the whole family.

I do not like meatloaf, but my husband is quite fond of it.  This recipe is FABULOUS!  I don't cook with salt if I can get away with it. I used dried spaghetti sauce mix instead of italian seasoning and substituted .5 lb of bulk pork breakfast sausage for .5lb ground beef.  WOW!!! My husband loved it and I loved it-it's a miracle!Now I can't say I hate meatloaf any more : )

This is excellent meatloaf! Truly the best I've ever had! I did add chopped and sauteed onions, garlic and leeks.  I left the foil off as suggested by other posts, and it was done in an hour. Instead of putting my meatloaf in a loaf pan, I form it on a cookie sheet. Makes it much easier to cut into slices and remove. My family didn't think the herbs were overpowering as others said. I even used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. This is no ordinary meatloaf, it's superb!

Absolutely the best meatloaf recipe. I don't care for meatloaf but changed my mind after this recipe. We had leftovers so gave the rest to our neighbors. Their kids normally don't eat meat but ate all of it and asked for more. The only change I made based on other reviews was replaced the ketchup for pasta sauce. Will definitely make it again and again.

My own meatloaf is Italian-style so I was eager to try someone else's.  I thought it was really great.  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the Italian seasoning...thought the basil, oregano, and garlic would be enough and I was right.  I followed other reviewers' recommendations and iced it with spaghetti sauce for the last 15-20 minutes along with some more mozzarella and parmesan (and a dash more garlic)  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not five, I missed the whole mushrooms and chopped vidalia onion I usually add to my Italian meatloaf sauce.

I loved that there weren't too many ingredients and I had most of them already. I found it held together perfectly and was moist at the same time.  I made this almost exactly as directed.  Only 1 tiny change... I took the foil off the last 20 minutes hoping to evaporate the excess liquid because some reviewers said it didn't hold together well for them.  It came out looking just right and sliced very pretty. The flavor was 3 stars to me. Not incredible, but edible.  I would change these things for myself. 1) No diced tomatoes.  I think this would be just good without chunks of tomatoes in it and 1 less ingredient to buy. 2) Add minced fresh garlic, 3 cloves I think. 4) Use red pasta sauce instead of ketchup. 
This is a good recipe and was very filling. I served it with caesar salad.

Great meatloaf!  I think the cheese and diced tomatoes really made this recipe.

YUMMMYYYY! I used meatloaf mix instead of beef,  2 cups of cheese, and fresh plum tomatoes skinned and diced and real garlic instead of garlic salt.  This was really good!

I only used 1 egg, and omitted the shredded cheese. Mixed ketchup in the loaf, cooked with tinfoil over it for 1 hr, removed tinfoil, glazed with more ketchup and broiled for about 6-8 minutes. Very good. I loved the full can of diced tomatos in it. I also used raw chopped onion and green pepper which cooked perfectly inside the meatloaf.

Made this for dinner last night and it was good, but it won't replace my TNT meatloaf.  It was fun to try something new.  We had it with a side of spaghetti, sort of like spaghetti and meatloaf instead of spaghetti and meatballs!  Thanks for the recipe.

This gets rave reviews from all 5 of us in my family.  I had only made my husband 2 other meatloaves in 8 years of marriage, since he didn't like meatloaf.  Well, this recipe changed that!  He said it was the best meatloaf he had ever had!  And, my 11-month old who doesn't like much ate up a whole piece.  How I changed the recipe:  Used 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb pork italian sausage, substituted 3/4 cup spaghetti sauce for the ketchup and tomatoes, and cooked for 1 hour and 10 minutes with the last ten minutes uncovered with a bit more spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese.  Looked beautiful!  Thanks for the recipe!

We had this for dinner last night and is was delicious and very easy to make. However, I used homemade sourdough bread crumbs and added garlic and onions. Other than that I followed it to the letter and the entire family loved it. The leftovers made a tasty sandwich for lunch today. Next time I 'm going to try substituting 1/3 of the ground beef with some mild italian sausage.

Yum. I used ground venison, added 1/4 cup grated parm.,  1 tsp onion powder, 1 tablespoon of grated fresh onion, and italian bread crumbs. I also mixed everything together, formed the loaf, then topped with the tomatoes and sprinkled with some more dried oregano.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I'll never make another meatloaf again.  My son who doesn't like meatloaf OR diced tomatoes complimented me on it, too.  It is VERY moist and delicious.  I had no trouble with it being TOO moist and falling apart, perhaps because I saved the ketchup out to drizzle across the top.  (My husband's reason for eating meatloaf is the ketchup topping.)  Do remove the foil for the last few minutes, or the meatloaf will be sickly pale and the ketchup won't have a chance to bake onto the top.  I used two pounds of ground beef, and this ended up making two loaf pans of meatloaf.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it needs something, not sure what.   Maybe it needs some sauteed onions or something, I'm not sure.   Maybe just a package of Onion Soup Mix would help.    Its not a bad base recipe but needs some doctoring.

The flavour is fantastic!  I had to cook it about 20 minutes longer than stated.  The consistency has sort of put me off...it's mushy and almost pours out of the pan.  You can't cut a slice.  I'd almost think it was still raw if I hadn't checked with a thermometer.  If you can get past the consistency it is very good!

I loved this recipe! And I finally got my meatloaf HATING husband to eat meatloaf and he liked it! The only changes I made was to substitute my Great Aunt Betty's italian spaghetti sauce for the ketchup. And then 10 minutes before it was done smothered the top of the loaf with more sauce and shredded mozzarella. It had a great consistency and flavor.

I'm giving it 3 stars because I did not think it was was very flavorful. I followed it to the tee with the only change being I used venison in place of the beef, I know this would alter the flavor a bit, but venison should not cause it to taste bland. I cook with venison quite often and if anything it should add more flavor. I do not think I will make this again.

My husband loves this and so do I!  I did make just a few slight changes that made a huge difference.  Like others have done, I changed the ketchup to pasta sauce.  Instead of dry herbs, I added 1 1/2 tbls. fresh basil, 1 tbls. fresh thyme and 1 tsp. fresh rosemary all finely chopped.  I used the italian style breadcrumbs instead of plain.  I also reserved 1/2 cup of the diced (garlic & olive oil) tomatoes and 1/2 cup mozzarella/parmesan blend.  I baked covered for about an hour then uncovered and spread the reserved diced tomatoes on the top and added 1/2 cup of mozzarella/parmesan blend and broiled for about 3-4 minutes- PERFECT!

I made this recipe last weekend and it was great! I made sure to drain the tomatoes well as others suggested and I also added a bit of tomatoe sauce on top.  Really good.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made. My husband doesn't care for meatloaf (baked hamburger!) but even he loved this.  Will definitely make this again.

I hate meatloaf!!!! But my family loves it! And we all loved this one! OMG! I made almost exactly except I didn't have oregeno so I doubled the italian seasoning, and I accidently bought garlic and herb diced tomatoes with onions... so glad I did ( I didn't even know about these)! Any who it was fantastic, a little grease but I just poured it off at the 45min mark... no biggie! Cooking time and temp was right on. Not only do I have a meatloaf I like but it will be a regular at our house. Thank ya thank ya.

I had high hope from this recipe especially after reading the reviews but I was sadly disappointed.  The whole thing was pure mush.  The flavor was good but I couldn't even eat it because of the mush texture.

I'm not a fan of meatloaf, and my fiancee hates it, but after reading this recipe and liking all the ingredients I decided to give it a try. We both LOVED it! I made it with ground turkey rather than beef for decreased cost and fat content, and used diced tomatoes with chilis (I know it's not Italian but we love spice). I also added diced onion and garlic, and used italian-style bread crumbs. I served it with some home-made cornbread and baked sweet potato fries -- we were in heaven!

excellent change-up for an old standard. Made it exactly as written and it was perfect, not soupy at all.  This recipe will not take the place of regular meatloaf for me but I will do it every 3rd or 4th time for welcome variety.  Thanks for the recipe.

The only canned tomatoes I had on hand was tomatoes with green chillis so, I decided to use cayenne pepper instead of Italian seasoning.  I used the same measurements but next time a little less cayenne.

I gave this recipe 5 stars, but that was after I read the reviews and followed the suggestions. It turned out moist and flavorful and was not too greasy.  I didn't have ketchup, so used chili sauce, left out Italian seasoning, added parsley, a good pinch of pepper, parmesan, dried onions, 3 dashes of Worcestershire, only used half of the can of tomatoes, and less cheese than called for.  It only took 55 minutes to reach 170 F. I think this was better than my BF's meatloaf, but he won't admit it!

So ridiculously good it is unbelievable. I've always turned away from meatloaf because of what I've tasted before it was dry, bland, odd tasting, or more often, a combination of all three. But this recipe, incredible. I used ground turkey and two fresh tomatoes I diced up (because that's what I had) in place of the ground beef and canned tomatoes. It came out moist and flavorful, but I didn't find the spices overpowering as some posters noted. My whole family loved this. Thanks!

I made this last night and my husband went crazy for it!!! I did change one thing. I did not add the ketchup and it came out very moist. I think with the ketchup or any sauce it would be too soupy. I added just a touch of the cheese to the top and let it brown the last 10 min of cooking. 
My husband said he does not want any other meatloaf again :)

Wonderful recipe that my whole family loved.  I was looking forward to the meatloaf sandwiches the following day but, my family whiped it out in one sitting and asked me to make it again the next night.  Oh... I did substitute diced for crushed b/c thats what I had on hand and it still turned out amazing.

OMG!  This recipe is awesome!!  I tried it with 1 lb Italian Turkey sausage and 1 lb ground deer meat.  Also added some chopped onion and celery as other reviewers suggested.  This is definitely the best meatloaf and a wonderful way to use deer meat.

I tried it to see if it'd be an improvement over a traditional meatloaf, but when I tasted it, I thought there were too many flavors and the great taste of meatloaf was lost.

This surprised me, it turned out so moist and tasty. Frankly I've tried lots of meatloaf recipes and they usually don't impress me that much, but I keep trying. This is one I will make again. The only thing I did differently than the printed recipe was to use the Italian-style bread crumbs.

I normally make the brown sugar meatloaf but was in the mood for Itallian and tried this. Very moist and one of my family members said it was the best meatloaf he ever had. I also poured some tomato sauce on top and the last 20 minutes of baking topped with more shredded mozzarella cheese and fresh basil.

Great for a something different dinner. I used a packet of Italian dressing mix as I didn't have any plain Italian seasoning. It definately gave it zing and flavor, maybe too much for some folks. Next time I would only use half the package to tone it down just a bit. I tried the bread trick to reduce the fat runoff which was still overwhelming. I would suggest going with the leanest meat you can find, like a 95/5 blend as my 90/10 wasn't lean enough for my taste.

Mmmm, Mmmm Good!  Simple to prepare!  I followed the recipe exactly except I poured some tomato sauce over it about 1/2 way in to cooking. It took 1 hour and 15 minutes to bake.  I froze the left overs for another day.  A keeper!

WOW!  This is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted by a long shot.  It is so full of flavor.  I did make some substitutions... used 1 lb of ground sirloin and 1/2 lb of ground italian sausage instead of 1.5 lb of ground beef; used quick-cooking oats instead of breadcrumbs; used 12 oz of tomato paste and 2-3 oz of tomato sauce instead of the canned tomatoes.  It turned out fantastic - this is the new standard by which my family will judge meatloaf.  My daughter, who "hates meat" even liked it.

What a nice twist on mealoaf.  The only thing I changed slightly was to use  petite diced tomatoes.  The next time I make this recipe it will be for spaghetti and meatballs.

Yummy!! I only had half of the mozzerela it calls for so I added some grated parmesan to it. It was a hit for my family. My husband doesn't like meatloaf and he even said it was good.

Pretty good! I used italian sausage and ground turkey. Def take the suggestion of only using one egg, especially if you're lo-carbing it and omitting the bread. Very tasty and actually was even better reheated in the oven after sitting in the fridge for a few days.

I made this when I had company for dinner. Though it was thoroughly done it was pretty darn wet and I wished I had cooked it better to dry it out some. I used extra lean beef. The flavor was very nice. I personally did not care for the look of the tomato chunks in it. I would use tomato paste not chucks, if I were to use this recipe again. But that is really just a personal preference. I feel very strongly that food should not only be good but should also be visually pleasing. This meatloaf, to me, was not. But, like I said, the flavor was really nice. Thank goodness I was cooking for my bachelor father who didn't care about the appearance (I think) and was glad to have a tasty home cooked meal.

This was incredibly moist and yummy and enjoyed by all. Made GREAT sandwiches the next day too. My only change is that in addition to the mozzarella I also added maybe 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese which needed to be used up. I used ground sirloin (90/10) and only had to drain it once, after it was cooked. This is a keeper. Thank you.

I used italian style bread crumbs, and instead of the ketchup, I used 1/4 cup of leftover pasta sauce.  This meatloaf came out wonderful, it was so moist and delicious!

This meatloaf is flavorful and moist. I added a handful of celery to give some texture.  My husband, who crinkled his nose when I told him meatloaf was on the menu, loved it!  I dumped out the excess liquid after 20 minutes, and again at 40 minutes.

I made the following modifications to this recipe after reading the postings.
I used the leanest meat I could find 97/3.  I used jar spagetti souce instead of ketchup, and I added more cheese.  I baked the leaf in a small lasagna pan.  (I just shaped the loaf and placed it in the middle of the pan.) I had no "grease or oil".  The meatloaf was awesome.  (I HATE MEATLOAF!  I only made it because I was forced to make it.)  This recipe will now be in my "rotation" of dinners!  THINK:  lasagna without the pasta.

I have to say that I really liked this recipe and so did my husband - and we do not like meatloaf!  I just really wanted to try something different and this sounded interesting.  The flavors are great and it doesn't have that bready taste.  This will become a family favorite!

Best meatloaf ever! So moist and flavorful! I had to use a 9x9 pan to fit it all in, though. Made excellent leftovers, too! Thanks for sharing Stefanie!

Hmmm...I did enjoy this, although it did come out a little runny, but once it was served, it was not bad at all...not quite a five star recipe, but not a three either!  So I took the average!  Definitely great if you are in a pinch for ingredients as most of these are readily available in most "chefs'" kitchens.  Thanx for the recipe.  It did leave a nice after taste and I will say that the mozarella cheese is really the way to go!

Really delcious - my husband who proclaims to despise meatloaf had three servings!  Even my children enjoyed it!!!  I forgot to drain the tomatoes and the meatloaf was incredibly juicy - practically fell apart, but it was not a bad thing.  Enjoy!

This was pretty good.  Nice change from regular meatloaf.  I didn't use as many seasonings though as my breadcrumbs were already seasoned and I thought it would overwhelm the flavor.

Excellent recipe! This has become a regular at our table, and now at my mother's table too! Just be sure to drain the tomatoes really well so it doesn't come out too moist. Thank you for the delicious recipe...it also makes great leftovers!

I would say that this is a really good meatloaf recipe.  For tomates all I had was spicy Rotell tomates with green chilis and it added a zing to the meatloaf which I loved.  My picky family loved it.  My 14 mo old scarfed it down in seconds wanting more, my picky 4 yr old said it was too spicy (but that isn't what the recipe calls for) and my husband liked it.  Will make again normal  LOved it thanks!

This was absolutely great! Will make again and again. My husband and I both loved it! And my husband is very finnicky, so this was a hit!  We both had 3 pieces because it was just so good! I added onions and green peppers to it, and put ketchup on the top during the last 20 minutes.

It does take about an 1hr and half.. I recommend draining the excess liquids out during the baking, and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes after cooked.  This way it won't seem soft as some people may have experienced.

I recommend putting onions in it, even green peppers too, because it really gives the beef a good taste. Topped with ketchup... this was excellent. Thanks!

Yum!  My family loved this; it was much better than a "regular" meatloaf.  Moist, delicious, and enjoyed by all.  I suggest spreading ketchup on top of the meatloaf before baking if you like the look and flavor of a topped meatloaf.  This recipe is great and one I will use again!

Whoa, the aroma of this baking was very good, however all the herbs in this recipe made it taste "grassy" to me.  I hoped it would taste good the next day for sandwiches but was disappointed.  If I were to make this again I would cut the spices at least in half.

I made this for my red meat-loving husband for his birthday the other night and...Wow! He loved it! I loved it! This is by far the BEST meatloaf either of us have encountered. The cheese keeps it really moist and all the spices make it endlessly flavorful.

I made this recipe and I HATE MEAT LOAF... This recipe ROCKS. I also made some substitutions to make it lower fat like egg substitute for egg and Low fat Chesse( Swiss to make it Sharper tasting). I also took everyones advice cooked it for 1 hour and 30 minutes. 1 hour covered 30 minutes uncovered. It was tender and delicious and I even made a sandwich later on at night it was soo goood. I will make this often.. And Hubby Loved it he wanted more at night as well.
Hubby Friendly!!!!!!!!!

Very good!  I added 2 teaspoons of Fennel seed for some extra kick and added 1 pound of ground pork.  I increased the other spices accordingly.  I made 2 smaller loaves; freeze one and the other I shaped into a loaf and placed on a broiler pan so the grease drips off and away from the meat.  Yum!

The spices are very overpowering. It was edible but I will defiantly cut back on the spices if I make it again. My husband said it was grotesque and to never make it again!

This was pretty yummy; the only caveat is that mine took a bit longer to get done ... I think because I used very lean ground beef, which made a dense loaf. Sure was tasty, though.

Didn't particularly like this recipe.  Perhaps that is because I used a beef/pork/veal meat combination that my grocery store packages.  Thought the spices were a bit overwhelming.

No kids, so can't rate the kid friendliness, but it was a great recipe.  Substituted Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and omitted the extra spices (except for salt and pepper).  Squished all the juice out of the tomatoes with a collander and potato masher and left off the foil.  We don't normally like meatloaf, but this one was delicious!

I never enjoyed meatloaf untill this one!  Everyone that has had it absolutely
loves it. I did not cover it while cooking, if you cover the loaf with foil it will take a bit longer than 1 hour to cook.

My boyfriend made this and we both really enjoyed it.  We did not have diced tomatoes so he cut up 2 fresh tomatoes.  Our one comment is it needs onions, which he had meant to do but forgot.  We'll definitely be having it again but with lots of onion next time.

Excellent tasting meatloaf!  Very simple to make.  I added a 1/2 tube of Jimmy Dean pork sausage.  My daughter, who is 3, didn't care for it, but she's a picky little thing anyway.  I'll definitely make this again and have a feeling it'll be a potluck hit.

Based on the other reviews, I left out the tomatoes.  I also used Italian style bread crumbs, so I left out the Italian seasoning so as not to be over-powering.  It cooked for 1 hr 20 minutes and was delicious.  The flavors are great, and the dish is a refreshing change.  I will definately make this again.  I served with baked sweet potatoes and green beans.

This was absolutely wonderful.  This is the first time I have ever made a meatloaf and it turned out great.  We barely had any leftovers which upset my husband, he loves meatloaf sandwiches.  Great recipe!

Very good. I had to drain the fat off about 1/2 way through and had to bake it longer than an hour, probably 15 minutes more. Yummy.

This is a yummy meatloaf! I added fresh rosemary, basil, thyme, and sage from the garden, and it was delicious! I also used oatmeal for a binder instead of bread crumbs. This recipe would only be improved with the additon of some pork sausage. The loaf will  probably need to be drained before it is done cooking, as the mix is quite watery because of the tomatoes. This is an absolutely delicious recipe, and it smells wonderful cooking. Of course my son picked all of the tomatoes out of it!

Very tasty!  I added a can of mushrooms and used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt. My husband loves meatloaf, and definitely approved of this version.  I will definitely make it again!

This was a great meatloaf but it was a bit soft in the centre.  I'd let it cook a little longer next time or not put in as much tomato.  Otherwise it was great!

My husband isn’t crazy about traditional meatloaf and asked me to try this recipe.  The whole family loved it.  I wasn’t sure how the mozzarella would do in it but it blended quite well. I may have been a little generous with the seasonings.  Very nice recipe.

Very good! I used 1 pound of pork/veal/beef mix, 3/4 c. of bread crumbs, 1 egg, a splash of milk, 2 tbl of dried parsley, 1 tsp of minced garlic, 2 tbl of Parmesan cheese, 1/4 tsp of basil, salt, and pepper. I divided the meat in half and put one half in my ceramic loaf pan.  I didn't use shredded mozzarella. I put 1 inch cubes on top of the half and then layered the other half on top. It came out so good. I also use this recipe to make meatballs and hamburgers.

I was never a meatloaf fan, but lately found myself wanting to try it again. Being a big Italian food lover I thought this recipe would be great to try and it was! All the flavors were delicious, my only issue was that it took longer than 1 hour recommended baking time, more like 1 1/2.

This was ok. Maybe I needed a loaf pan with drainage but I think a can of tomatoes is too much for a meatloaf. I used 1/2 a can and way too soggy. I've have always put in spaghetti sauce because I really don't understand the ketchup addition except from my childhood. I would take the can o' tomatoes out, put in fresh garlic, 1/2 cup of yum pasta sauce. Thanks for sharing!

A great meatloaf with different taste then the traditional BBQ style..  The mozzarella in the meat was fantastic and kept it nice and moist.  Used a can of RO-TEL with green chillies for some spicy kick..  one of my favourite meatloafs to date.

This was very mushy. I did not care for the cheese in it. Needed a sauce on top. Won’t be making again.

I did this one by the letter except for one thing. I added a pound of sage sausage. The family loved it! I've been told I have to make it again soon.

This was like a giant meatball so good!! I did use 1.5 pound beef & 1.5 hot Italian sausage.  I added fresh garlic & onion & red hot pepper flakes.  Baked at 350 1 hour & 30 minutes.  Last ten minutes I added more petite tomatoes on top with mozzarella & parm cheese.  Served this with buttered egg noodles. Yummy!

I followed the recipe except for the ground beef:  I had just bought at my lgrocery store a meatloaf combination of ground beef and pork.  I wanted to try this since I have eaten meatloaf
all my life with ground beef only.  I have mixed feelings about it.  I like the recipe and will try again with ground beef only.  Even though I gave it 5 stars I think I will like it better next time.

Absolutely love this recipe!!! I have never made meatloaf before but it's my favorite and I haven't had it since my grandma passed away so I decided to try it for the first time on my own and came across those recipe and everyone in my family loved it!!! Only thing I tweaked was I used spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup and the last 10 mins of cooking I spread spaghetti sauce on top and sprinkle Parmesan cheese on it I cooked mine for an hour and half

as someone mentioned before it was on the different side, therefore I took the chance to experiment and substitute the ingredients I had on hand as far as the cheeses are concerned.
I used sharp cheddar and made my own brown sugar with white sugar and molasses and it was great.
makes great sandwiches. will definitely make again.

Unfortunately, the first time I made this, I forgot the eggs.  Oh my goodness.  Had to throw it out.  But the second time I made it,  I liked it.  Wish I could say that I loved it but it is just a little too mushy.  But the flavor is great.  I'm Italian - not sure why this is called 'Italian' meatloaf.  Nevertheless, I will make it again.

First I will say I used venison instead of ground beef. This turned out great for venison and didnt require adding a bacon or other fat normally called for in a venison meatloaf recipe. The cheese disappears when cooking which is good because I didnt really want a cheesy meatloaf. The meatloaf was moist and the only other thing I modified was adding half of a diced yellow onion and then pan fried the slices to get a crust. This turned out great and I can definitely see myself using this with venison again in the future.

One of the reasons I like this recipe other than the fact that it is pretty tasty is because you can mix all the ingredients in the meatloaf pan without having to dirty more dishes or I've also made mini meatloaves using a cupcake pan.  

I've made this recipe using beef and I've also used this same recipe using turkey and both were extremely tasty.  I like to use the HOT Rotel tomatoes, but that's just my preference.  The only alteration that I make to this recipe is that I use jarred spaghetti sauce in lieu of ketchup.

So if you haven't tried this recipe yet, do yourself a favor and make it, you'll love it.  Besides, it's hard to screw up meatloaf

I have made this recipe for atleast over 5 years, as well as,  have served this  many times over. It is hands down my favorite meatloaf recipe...I use maverick meat ..which is more expensive ground beef  the has  approx 4g  of fat per serving /slice vs sirloin 22g fat per slice or even lowfat  ground beef which is 8g fat per serving...It goes over so well and last up to a week in the fridge for left overs. It s great hot out of the oven or cold in a  meatloaf sandwich......I wish I could personally thank  the chef who posted this recipe....It is the recipe I have made the most from this web page.....and  enjoy it  so much every time I make it!!

I followed this recipe to a T. And it was incredible.  The seasoning was perfect. If I were to make one suggestion it would be to make sure you drain the grease about 10 minutes until it is done. Also take the tin foil off  and let it cook uncovered for the last 10 minutes.

Won't try this one again but if I do, it will need a lot of tweaking.

This is by far the best meatloaf recipe EVER!!! Because I don't eat gluten, I used GF BreadCrummbs and added more spice since these are not flavored. I iced the meatloaf in Heinz Chili Sauce and used Fire-Roasted Diced Tomatoes in the recipe.  I did add extra and placed them around the meatloaf...this recipe will always be a "hit".

I made this today with my own twist--I used 1 lb pork sausage and 3/4 lb ground beef and instead of the seasonings I used Italian breadcrumbs.  I replaced the tomatoes with 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce and I used sharp cheddar cheese since that was all I had.  My 12 yo loves it as well as me and my husband.  This is my new go-to meatloaf!

I've made this many times for my family, and they absolutely love it!  It's so moist and full of flavor.  Instead of ketchup, I use tomato sauce since it's healthier.  I also used whole wheat bread crumbs.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

This has a really good taste. I didn't have Oregano but used diced tomatoes that had basil and oregano in it already. Used 85% ground beef. I highly recommend use a leaner meat. It was a little fatty. But, would recommend......

Being diabetic I stay away from the brown sugar. Recipe didn't say what to do with the mozzarella so I just sprinkled it on top and only needed 1/3 the amount. Used Italian meat loaf meats from my Italian store which is a mix of 1/3 each; ground beef, veal & pork. Then I used  fresh peeled tomatoes & added fresh garlic, onions, green peppers & fresh basil to the other ingredients. Easy to make but needed a 9x6 loaf pan (which I have). Invited mom over...just fab!

This meatloaf had a really great flavor, but a really weird consistancy. I suggest uncovering it for the last 5 or 10 minutes of cooking to brown it up a little on top. I actually put it under the broiler for a minute because it looked almost raw when I pulled it out of the oven.

Tried this last night, minus the cheese (to save some calories) and with homemade marinara instead of ketchup. Turned out great; flavorful, neither too dry or squishy.

Made this last night for dinner and the entire family gobbled up every last bit of it.  Incredible!  My minor changes: fresh diced tomatoes rather than canned, fresh basil rather than dried, low fat mozz cheese sticks stuffed in the middle for a surprise cheese layer.  Zowee! So good!

Was an awesome meal.  I used fire roasted tomatoes, which gave it a bolder flavor.

This was delicious! I used 2lb ground beef with diced tomatoes w/garlic, oregano and basil pre-mixed in the can for the topping.  I also added diced portabello mushrooms.  Used 3 eggs.  Substited the mozzerella with a parm/asiago/romano mixture on top under the tomato.  My husband LOVES it!

I thought this was really good.  I scaled it back to use 1lb of ground beef.  I almost forgot to put the tomatoes in it and I'm glad I did.  It made it incredibly moist.  Next time I will use petite diced- my chunks were a little large.  Very nice flavor to this.  Thanks for sharing.

I followed other reviews and cut down on the italian seasoning.  Next time I will follow exactly as written. My very picky boyfriend, scooted away from the table and said good meal, thanks honey! Quite a compliment from him. To those who said this was too moist and hard to cut: I always slice my meatloaf right after I put it in the pan before cooking. It cooks faster and never falls apart!

I served this for a casual dinner party last night and my guests LOVED it!  My boyfriend doesn't usually get excited about meatloaf, and he raved about it. Further, one of our guests claimed to know his meatloaf and that he's eaten a lot of it, and he said this was some of the best he'd had.  Not only does it taste DELICIOUS, it was so easy!  And I figured that to feed 4 people, it cost about $4.00 total.  Unbelievable.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Very good recipe. I did some changes though.... I substituted the ketchup with Prego Marinera sauce. Bread Crumbs I did it with Italian bread crumbs, can diced tomatoes with basil and garlic (did not drain) I cooked it at 375 and for 1hr 40mins. It was very good. Great with pasta on the side and leftovers...husband made meatloaf sandwiches too :)

It was good.  Great flavor, but fell apart completely. Plus, it took MUCH longer to bake through.  Haven't decided if I'll make this one again or keeping looking, but it was a good experiment.

I thought it baked up nice, altho it did fall apart a little when I cut it. The herbs were a little overpowering for us as a stand alone dish. I sliced the leftover meatloaf & layed it in a baking dish, covered it w/an Italian blend cheese & a jar of chunky spaghetti sauce & heated it til the cheese was melted. It was awesome(5 stars)! Served w/garlic toast & "Garden Penne" from this site, which was an amazing combo!!

It smelled WONDERFUL coming out of the oven, but I would have enjoyed it more perhaps with less Italian seasoning. It tastes like you're downing straight herbs at times.

My husband told me that this was the best meatloaf he ever ate. Score! I changed a little bit of the recipe. First, I used Italian bread crumbs. I used a 6 cheese marinara instead of ketchup. I couldn't find my Italian blend spice, but I figured the bread crumbs would help with that. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Once I had everything mixed in and pressed into the baking dish, I covered the top with more marinara sauce. About a half hour before it was done, I topped with more Mozzarella cheese. It turned out great! Next time, I will transfer from the  baking dish to a serving plate so it doesn't look so bad. There was a ton of grease from the meat and cheese sitting on all sides of the baking dish. To finish off my meal, I made wide noodles with butter and parmesan.I warmed more marinara sauce to top it all. With a side of french cut green beans, this meal was top-notch without breaking the bank or the back!

I do not like meatloaf at all, but my boyfriend does and I wanted to make it for him.  So, I compromised with this italian style one and to my surprise, it was quite good.  However, I think it would be better as meatballs because as meatballs, it became overwhelming after a while.

I have a lot of meatloaf recipes, but this is by far the best. The only thing I changed was I used 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. Italian style ground turkey. Yummy in the tummy!

This recipe is a keeper in my household, the best we've ever had. I made a few modifications though. I used Italian bread crumbs, Italian diced tomatoes and I put the diced tomatoes in a processor to avoid the chunks of tomatoes others complained about.

Everyone LOVED this recipe. My mom had said that she used to make this for us when I was younger, but couldn't remember the recipe. So I found this one. I prepared it almost exactly. I used a can of stewed tomatoes with seasonings that I blended further ((I have kids that refuse to eat tomatoes)) and then when there was about 10 minutes left of bake time I added a top layer of shredded mozz cheese. FABULOUS!! ((oh, I did make mine in a loaf shape but free standing on a pan))

This was pretty good.  The spices weren't too overwhelming except for the Italian seasoning. The only problem I had was the chopped tomatoes.  While eating the meatloaf the chopped tomatoes looked like chuck of uncooked meat.  Over all very tasty!

This recipe did not turn out at all!  It was very soupy and no one liked it at all.  Not a keeper.

My husban - the I will never like Meatloaf man - ate two plates.   I did use spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup and followed several modifications included in the reviews.

This was really, really good!  It wasn't as "done" as I wanted it to be, but that was my own fault.  The husband loved it as well.  Thanks for sharing!

Good meatloaf, but I wasn't crazy about having the diced tomatoes in it.  Other than that, we enjoyed it.

Mixed opinions of taste on this recipe. My husband who is a Meatloaf eater felt it was too mushy, I also felt it was type doft. Meanwhile my two son's who don't enjoy Meatloaf as much loved it. So, for this recipe it is a mixture of opinions, I guess it depends if you like yoour Meatloaf soft or firm.

I have never cooked a meatloaf before and decided to try this one.  I read some of the reviews and decided to modify it slightly.  I used marinara sauce instead of ketchup (though I think it would still be good with ketchup).  I also put some garlic powder in the mix.  Other than that I followed the recpie exactly, and it was delicious.  I loved it and will cook again.  Thank you for a great recipe

Did not like - too watery b/c of the can of diced tomoatoes most probably.  The flavor of the spice mixture didn't work for us.  My kids liked the "Best Ever Meatloaf" recipe better.

The chucks of tomatos turned me off.  Maybe chopping them would help.  I thought the taste was very bland.

Very tasty!  It was very balanced, very flavorful--it didn't need any extra sauce like some meatloafs.  It was  little greasy...but how do you avoid that with a pound and a 1/2 of hamburger?

This really was different, My husband hates meatloaf but said to make this again,We also had a duest who eats very little and she had seconds so I guess it was a great hit. The only change I made was to use spagetti sauce instead of ketchup. Thanks for the recipe

Excellent change to meatloaf!!!  Love the tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.  Mine was not mushy at all.  Followed recipe exactly plus added alittle chopped onion.  Drained and sqeezed tomatoes on a paper towel.  Baked for one hour and then 5-10 minutes with the foil off to brown top.  Tested with meat thermometer at an hour.  Drained grease by tipping pan a couple of times towards the end.  Family loved it!

This recipe is easy to alter for some different tastes.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 lbs of lean ground beef and 1 lb of ground hot italian sausage.  Everyone remarked that this recipe would be great for meatballs too, and better as a sandwich, sliced and served on a hoagie roll with mozz cheese.

Wow, was this very yummy! I followed the directions exactly. (I had to change the servings to 4 because I only had one pound of hamburger)This meatloaf was very moist and tasted exactly like an Italian meal! Will make again.

After reading reviews, I did adjust the amount of liquid - so used one egg, 10 ounces of diced tomatoes and I mixed 1 cup of cheese into the meat mixture (the rest, I added to the top of the meat loaf with about 15 minutes left in the cooking). The result was very moist and tasty. I used panko crumbs and 3 cloves of fresh garlic for the garlic salt (so did add some salt and pepper before putting the meat loaf in the oven). I baked it in a 375 degree oven, without the foil (I used the foil to line the pan) and it cooked in 45 minutes (just the thing for a quicker meal). Delicious and a great change from other meat loaf recipes I have tried. Thanks for the recipe Stefanie.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever made.  Even my picky eater devoured it and asked for more.  I used all the ingredients called for, but just "eyeballed" the amounts.  Still came out fabulous!  This is now a regular at our house.

This was excellent. I did make a few minor changes.   I added fresh garlic and onions. I also put tomato paste on top and added mozzerella.  It is a good idea to cook this on a rack to eliminate the oil from the meat and cheese.

This is very silmilar to mine with a few tweaks.  I use a meatloaf mixture for the meat, homemade or jarred sauce, spices adjusted to taste, and thinly sliced mozzarella.  I layer 1/2 of the meat mixture in the pan, place a good layer of cheese over all, top with the remaining meat pushing the sides together so no cheese escapes. When almost done, I spread a little sauce on top. I've made it for many church pot-lucks and always bring home just the dish!

We liked this.  It's a great change from the old dry meatloaf we all grew up on.  I would cut back on the cheese a bit.  It's VERY moist so it was hard to tell if it was done.  But I used a meat thermometer to check and then baked it for about 15 min more.  Was still really moist and tasty.

This meatloaf was very mushy inside!  I cooked it for 65 minutes, thermometer said it was 170 degrees, but it was so mushy I stuck it back in the oven for another 12 minutes.  Still way too mushy!  Definately not the consistency i'm used to in a meatloaf.  Anyway, flavor was okay, nothing great.  Maybe it will taste better as leftovers tomorrow.

Had to use the 4 serving recipe to make it with 1lb of ground beef. It was a change from the usual meat loaf and very tasty. I will definitely make this one again!

Great recipe!  I made it with deer burger and it came out perfect.  I didn't have to drain any fat or grease off of it.  I think using lean meat, like deer is part of why it came out so well.  Love the Italian twist to meat loaf!

Very, very good. I used some jarred marinara sauce instead of ketchup and diced tomatoes. Very moist and had a nice tang. I sauteed some onions and garlic and added that too.

I thought this was very nice, just needed something for some oomph. Worstershire sauce is a must and some diced onion would be nice. Maybe some salt too? It just seemed a little flavorless compared to what I have eaten before as meatloaf, but otherwise very good.

so i am not a big fan of meatloaf, but wanted to make something that i already had most of the ingredients for.  this turned out to be absolutely delicious-so moist and flavorful.  the cheese was a great addition and the seasoning was nice too.  definitely not my mom's meatloaf (which is a good thing...haha) :)

thanks for the great recipe!

Tasted good, but seemed a bit springier than typical meatloaf.  Next time I'll try less bread crumbs and cheese to make it denser

My mother-in-law makes a meatloaf very simalar to this one.  It is just as good. I tried the bread trick on the bottom of the pan, it worked.  The ccooking time was way too long though.  My husband liked it very much and wants leftovers- a rare thing in our household.

It was my first meatloaf experience. It was too bland for me. I could barely eat it so I cooked some macaroni and mushed it together like hamburger helper, added lots of tomato sauce(Prego), loads of oregano and topped it with melted cheese. Much better.

I'm not a big meat eater but made this for my husband. Not only did he eat half of it the first night, I loved it as well. VERY good!!  I've made it three times now and this last time I didn't have any ketchup so I used what I had - a mild cocktail sauce. It was fantastic - just the right amount of flavor added, but not too spicey. It's easy, cheap, quick and GOOD!

Nice change. I've made this now a couple of times & I like it better using petite or crushed tomatoes instead of diced. You need to drain the juice well. Since I don't make meatloaf very often I don't think I'll go back to the plain type.

Weve been looking for a good meatloaf, one that isnt too sweet, this one is just right.  Only used beef as we arent into pork and substituted the ketchup with chili sauce and topped it with that too.  Next time I'll double the spices though and add an extra tablespoon of Worcestershire like the other reviews mentioned.  Great recipe though!

We made this last night and it was great. The only thing I did differently was I added the spices to the meat and let it marinate in the fridge for a few hours. I also added some Italian sausage. I forgot to add the ketchup but it still came out good. Very greasey I had to drain the grease halfway though. Next time I will try placing bread at the the bottom of the pan to soak of the grease.

Very tasty, very savory. Because it's so moist I suggest baking the loaf uncovered for about 5-10 minutes at the end if you want it a little drier and crispier around the edges. I have also made mini meatloaves using a muffin tin and they turned out great.

Hubby absolutely loved it.  I thought it was decent... which is a really good compliment considering I despise meatloaf.  The italian flavorings gave it a very nice twist.

We absolutely loved this meatloaf! I did alter it somewhat. I added a little extra ketchup. I used the Italian style diced tomatoes so I decreased the Italian seasoning to 1/2 teaspoon. I used 2 tsp. minced garlic instead of the garlic salt. And since I bought a 2 cup package of cheese I used it all. I cook for two picky eaters and they were quick to clean this up and go for seconds. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

My husband and I are not fans of meatloaf, but this was delicious and easy!  Tasted more like italian meatballs than a meatloaf.  I reserved a bit of the cheese and tomatoes to put on top and used juice from tomatoes instead of ketchup.

This is a great recipe - tastes like a meatball!  Even my picky girls ate it and liked it very much. Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, Italian seasoned diced tomatoes and chopped them finer, and cooked for 1 hour at 375. Drained the fat 1/2 way through.  Delicious!

This meatloaf was good, a solid "4". I read some of the comments so was aware it may end up very moist but still used 2 eggs as I figured they'd help bind it together, and I drained the tomatoes thoroughly. Also, didn't have any italian seasoning around so just used extra oregano and basil, and had garlic breadcrumbs so left out the garlic salt. I put it in the oven covered for an hour, but then drained it, and put it back in the oven uncovered for another 10 minutes and it got nice and brown on top. Was probably still a little underdone but we were too hungry at that point to wait any longer! Served with baked potates, it was a nice meal for a rainy night.

I followed some of the other reviews and only used one egg. I also added 3 - 4 T of dried chopped onions and used Italian style diced tomatoes. I cooked for 1 hr 15 minutes at 375.  My family liked it and said it was a 'keeper'.

This is really delicious meatloaf!  It was really moist and tasty.  The loaf was not mushy at all, as indicated in the other reviews.  If you use the exact ingredients and cook for the appropriate amount of time, then it has a perfect texture.  We will definitely make this again.

This is a good recipe.  You can really mold this one into whatever you like--it is pretty fool proof.  For instance, I make mine without the tomatoes and cheese, but with a bit more garlic and it comes out great.  Our favorite meatloaf!

I have to admit, I was not a big meatloaf fan... But, this sounded interesting so I went for it, and now I'm really glad I did.  It was absolutely amazing! I will never look for another meatloaf recipe again.  I only made a few modifications, because that is all I had on hand.  I used half ground turkey breast with half ground italian sausage (I just took it out of the casings) and I used 1/4 cup Classico spicy tomato pesto because I didn't have ketchup.  It had the most amazing flavor and I will definitely have to share this recipe with friends. Thanks for posting!!

I made a few changes to this recipe, I added about a 1/2 cup chopped onions, used italian bread crumbs, and substituted the catsup and diced tomatoes for jarred pasta sauce. I also followed the other poster's suggestion and upped the temperature to 375. Turned out great, not too spicey at all. Would make again for sure.

With so many ratings and reviews I really thought this recipe would turn out very tasty. I'm usually a very good cook but some how this just didn't come out right. Maybe it was the tomatoes but I didn't care for it and wont be making it again.

6/5/17 - always a go-to!  Made a double batch tonight, one for us tomorrow and one to take to a sick co-worker.  Served with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes!  Use 2 tsp of Italian seasoning instead of the herb mix.

5/22/2016 - still my favorite way to do meatloaf, always a crowd pleaser!  Excellent with turkey instead of beef!

12/6/2005 - Awesome!  First time I've ever made meatloaf and it was terrific - my family loved it and I found a recipe for meatloaf that I like too!

I doubled the recipe to feed my large crew, prepared as directed and divided into two loafs at the end.  To the second loaf I added some diced up pepperoni.  This recipe will be added to our monthly menu!  I'll probaly do both loaves again.  Without the pepperoni the flavor reminded us of spaghetti, with it it was more pizza like.

The ingredients sounded great which is why i decided to try this meatloaf. And the time said 1 hour which was perfect. 
The taste was pretty good. I put in extra basil, oregano and italian seasoning. Although, an hour and 1/2 of cooking at 375 and incresingly more heat...it was still soggy. I couldnt eat more than 4 bites before feeling sick. Maybe next time i wont put the ketchup in (the kids use it to dip the ematloaf in anyways) and drain the pan of the grease half way through cooking. I dont knwo if i will be making this again, but thanks anyways.

Sorry, but I didn't care for this recipe.  Maybe I didn't put it together right, because I found it to be much too moist, it didn't hold together well at all, and the taste wasn't what I expected.

I'm sorry, but we did not care for this recipe at all.  It was so moist, it was soggy.  Not as flavorful as expected.  Also, required an extra 1/2 hour to bake.

It was a little greasy. I used extra lean ground beef, added onions, mushrooms and peppers but when i checked on it, i found it sitting in a pool of grease! not sure where I went wrong, but it wasn't very good. I gave it three stars because this could have been an error on my part.

I didn't care much for this meatloaf, and my children didn't want to eat it. It was alittle drier and much more bland than my usual glazed meatloaf, which is sweet. IF I ever made this again (which I doubt) I would not use as much dry bread crumbs.

I don't normally like meatloaf, but this recipe is amazing!!  Very moist and flavorful...I can't wait to make it again!  If you're looking for something more than the standard dry, tasteless meat loaf, try this recipe--you won't be dissapointed.  And its easy too! :-)

I followed this recipe to the letter except I added onions, green peppers, and a splash of Worceshire sauce.  This is the second time I've made this, it's great and my husband and I both love it.  Even better the next day.

This was a very good meatloaf, although I thought it wasn't much different than other meatloaves.  I used italian style tomatoes.  I will make this again.

I changed this up a little to make it fun for the kids.  Even worse is the hubby.  He won't eat ANYTHING but Pizza...so I added pepperoni over the top and substituted half of the ground beef with italian sausage.  I added italian seasonings instead all of the listed ingredients.  The mozzarella went on top of the pepperoni with about 15 minutes left of baking time (uncovered) to get brown and bubbly.  EVERYONE loved it.  What a hit.  Thanks for the idea!!!! No more boring meatloaf for my gang!!!!

This is my first allrecipes.com recipe I've tried. I'm impressed! I've never eaten meatloaf before, and I very much enjoyed this meatloaf. It was very moist, tender, and very very tasty. Seems to taste better as a 'leftover'. Perfect for singles like me. This will be in regular rotation in my kitchen!

This has great flavor.  I always add a little bit more spice than called for. I use fresh garlic and basil when I have it on hand. Also, cooking time is a lot longer that stated and I do not cover with foil. This goes great with suzy's red mashed potatoes also from this site.

This recipe was great!  I did however have to alter it a bit.  Since I didn't have dried herbs on hand I substituted freshly chopped flat leaf parsley, rosemary and sage.  Also, I found that it took a lot more time than stated, mine took almost two hours, so after about 90 minutes in the oven I cranked the heat up to 375 and that did the trick.  Great recipe, will definitely make again.  Thank you!

I will definitely make this meatloaf again!! Great taste and very moist--I added 1/2 pkg (roll)of sausage with the pound of ground chuck and I was short on the mozerella cheese by about 3/4 of a cup so I just added shredded cheddar!! Thanks Stephanie for the recipe, it's a keeper!!

My husband and I did not like this at all.  We thought the spices were overpowering, even though I only used 1/2 of the garlic salt and Italian seasoning.  I also thought it was too mushy.  I will not be making this again.

Tried this one last night, but used 2 lbs of ground turkey instead of the 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef.  My husband turned his nose up when he heard I used turkey until he tried it.  He ended up having 3 pieces than took a sandwich to work today for lunch.  After reading other reviews, I took some advice and used italian seasoned breadcrumbs than omitted some of the other spices.  I kept the garlic salt and added one small finely chopped onion.  Finally, to help keep down on the excessive moisture, I squeazed as much of the juice out of the tomtoes as possible.  Turkey tends to be drier than beef in recipes due to the lower fat content, but this recipe worked well with the turkey.  Oh yeah, it took longer for this one to cook too, but was well worth the wait. I am adding this one to my favorites.

Easy to make!  One of the best meatloafs I've ever tasted!  This gets a 5-Star Rating all the way.  No need to add or change a thing!

I have made this recipe a couple of times. My husband really likes it. I think it is too "mushy", and will cook it uncovered next time, eliminate most of the juice from the tomatoes, and cook it 15 mins. longer. Has a very good flavor.

It's awesome.  My husband and I are not really meatloaf-eaters, but I had a craving one day and found this recipe.  The Italian seasonings are great - I used a 19 ounce can of Italian stewed tomatoes and it was really moist.  I did leave it in the oven for an extra 25 minutes because of the extra juice.  The ketchup made itself into a nice glaze on top.   Superb - and great cold the next day!!!   Thank you so much Stefanie.

This is the third meatloaf recipe that I have tried and is by far the best one.  My husband doesn't like meatloaf, but loved this one!  I did drain it a couple of times during the cooking process b/c it does get watery and I cooked it uncovered for the last twenty minutes.

This was pretty good.  My husband said, 'That is really good loaf' and he usually doesn't compliment my meat loafs.  I think next time I'll half the amount of spices since there was already some in my italian seasoned bread crumbs I think they were pretty over-powering.  Definatley leave the foil off, I had to drain mine after the hour time limit, then I put it under the broiler to get rid of the not-very-well-done look.

This was quite yummy.  However, it took longer to cook than the recommended time.  But a nice change from traditional meat loaf.

I love this.  I think I am going to start leaving out the tomatoes though, as they tend to make it fall apart.  Another thing I do to make it less watery is cook it uncovered.  Overall, a great recipe.

This was the best meatloaf I ever made.  After
reading other reviews, I change it up some.  I omitted chop toms and baked it uncovered until about 30 minutes from being done.  I poured a small can of the roasted garlic tomato sauce over
it and baked it for about 30 more minutes.  My husband thought it tasted like a great giant meatball.

The cooking time needs to be longer - next time I think I will try the last 15 minutes without the foil to make it a little crisper. Overall, the recipe is a good one that I will use again. The ingredients are simple and it does not take long to throw it all together with a baked potato.

My husband really liked the meatloaf and my stepson thought it was pretty good. I personally thought the herbs were too overpowering and it took longer to cook than stated. I probably won't be using this recipe again.

This is a good receipe.  We cut the herbs in half.  We had to cook it a little longer than stated, and it was very moist.  My husband raved over this recipe and my children ate it up.

This was very easy to make. It took longer than an hour and was still a bit too soft on the inside but the flavor was great. My husband loved it. I think with a few changes like less mozzarella and cutting down on the diced tomatoes the meatloaf would have less of a mushy quality. Overall the taste was good...I would definitely do it again with small changes.

This was an exceptionally good meatloaf.  The herbs could be somewhat overpowering if they aren't your favorite type.  I think that you could use half the amount of herbs and still have good flavor.  Try it!

I have claimed for years that I dislike meatloaf but this is really good.  It tasted a little too herbal for me.  I think I will cut back a little next time.  It took longer to cook than the recipe stated.  It was a great meatloaf and I will make it again and again!

Yet another great recipe.  After this wonderfuly meatloaf I will not make any other kind.  Terrific tasting and very easy to make.
