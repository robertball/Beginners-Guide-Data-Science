SO DELICIOUS! My boyfriend raved over these sammys. They're so easy to make, too. I bought a small oven roasted turkey breast and shredded that, the first time I made it. The second time I used left over baked chicken breasts. Both times were phenomenal. I use a whole cucumber and shred it on a cheese grater. This is one of my favorite recipes from allrecipes.com. Thank you thank you thank you!

This is sooooo good.  I didn't have plain yogurt, so I used 1 cup of low fat sour cream.  I made my cucumber the way my Grandma made her cucumber salad.  I pealed the cuke, sliced, then salted it and placed it in a bowl with a dish covering the slices.  I then place a heavy object on the dish to press the cucumbers.  You can leave it for an hour, or overnight in the refrigerator.  This releases the juice and really brings out the flavor and crunch of the cucumbers.  Since I'd already salted the cucumbers, I didn't add any more salt.  This tasted just like a low fat version of Greek Gyros.

I used chicken breasts for this recipe and they were DELICIOUS!  I would definitely make the Tzatziki sauce a day before and let it season in the fridge.  A truly delicious recipe and a way to have healthy homemade gyros!!!

Excellent, easy and fresh.  My husband actually made this as an alternative to the normal left-over thanksgiving turkey meals.  I added some sliced black olives that were also leftover.  I think a few sliced green onions would add a little zip. I loved the cucumber sauce! You could use low-fat sour cream to decrease the fat content. Overall, a very good, fresh taste.  We served it with fresh greek, feta salad.

Its very hard to please my family when it comes to "New Recipe" night.  Everyone loved this sandwich! When my son eats 4, that can tell you something.  The cucumber sauce is very fresh tasting. We will be making this again.

Light, refreshing and delicious.  I used only yogurt, no mayo. Also, I added a pinch or two of sugar to both the yogurt sauce and the chicken mixture. It added extra flavor and softened the tartness.   Would  be great for a light summer meal with a good bottle of wine.

This was delicious and easy to make! The only change I made was adding more red wine vinegar to the cucumber sauce.

Wonderful lunch. I used fat free sour cream and fat free yogurt and English cucumber in the dressing. I also left out the oil. I stuffed the pita halves and froze them. The night before work, I put this in my lunch bag with a container of lettuce and tomatoes as well as a container of dip. Nuked the sandwich for lunch for one minute, assembled and devoured!!

Amazing! I was looking for something to make with leftover rotisserie turkey and Tzatziki sauce I had bought from a Lebonnese family at my local farmer's market. What a perfect recipe! Thanks Pam!

I can really only rate the cucumber sauce because I used a different recipe for the meat, but this sauce was AWESOME!!  It took some prep time but it was yummy.  I could've just dipped pita bread right in it and ate the whole thing.  I followed the recipe exactly and all the flavors were wonderful.  We will definitely make this again.

Instead of using turkey, I used a whole roasted chicken and pulled the meat apart to not quite shredded.  I also added a splash of lemon juice and additional garlic to the cucumber sauce to make it just a little zippier.

As a tip: You can warm pitas by toasting them directly on a (very clean) stove burner for just a few seconds per side on medium to high heat which is how a lot of people warm up their pitas at home--sounds weird but works perfectly :o)  Or you can use an indoor grill for the same effect.   If you're going to heat pitas up in an oven just as they are--you may want to wrap them in tin foil to help retain their moisture.

This is fantastic! Frying the turkey up with onion, oregano and garlic is a great change from the usual bland turkey used in sandwiches. The cucumber sauce is really what sets it apart though - it is REALLY good. The recipe for the sauce alone is a keeper! This will always be a follow up for the day after turkey dinner. The nice thing about this is that you don't feel like you are eating turkey "again".

I'm very picky about trying new recipes. Tonight, while browsing through recipes for leftover turkey- this one stood out. My instinct proved correct! It is amazingly good, simple enough, and a totally different way to use up that leftover turkey (Or chicken, for that matter)!

I followed this cucumber recipe exactly. But when it came to the rest I just filled a pita pocket with mixed salad greens from the farmer's market, added warm shredded chicken(I just bought a whole one from grocery store), feta cheese, fresh tomatoes from the farmer's market, and then topped it off with the cucumber sauce. It was good but my boyfriend said the cucumber sauce reminded him too much of mayo!

My husband told me he would rather I had made soup.  In my opinion, it was bland and only ok.  The only thing that saved it is I kept slathering on more and more yogurt sauce.  Everything else was barely decent and the whole meal was rather bland.

Loved this recipe and the sauce was great!  I will definately use this sauce on other dishes.  The only changed that I did make was reducing the onion amount down.

I used diced roasted turkey breast and these came out great. The sauce would have been better if I had *grated* the cucumber as the recipe suggests, instead of finely chopping it. We'll be having this one again.

Loved it! Will make again. I used chicken and grilled it before I put in the pitas, it gave it a lot more flavor.

I make this using ground turkey and season it up with oregano, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. The yogurt sauce is perfect!  Very easy and satisfying and only use one pan to cook it in ;)

I used chicken instead of the turkey and it was wonderful!  Love the cucumber sauce, worthy of five stars on it's own! I just buy pitas at Spangles (why do they have the best pita bread in town?) and heat it up in the oven.  Absolutely delicious!

We really liked everything in this recipe except for the turkey, we will use chicken in the future, and to save time we are going to use the chicken pieces that can be found in the deli section of a grocery store...other than that we loved the recipe is was very fresh and had a great mix of different flavors.

I doubled the recipe, but made the cucumber sauce without changes.  I didn't have leftover turkey so I used chicken and the sandwiches were very good.  One tip when assembling the ingredients in a pita, put some sauce on the bottom, middle and top of the pita or the end product will taste a little dry.  I would definitely make this again.

I used meat from the monster turkey wings that I used to make Chef John's make ahead turkey gravy. 

The recipe has a nice blend of flavors. I would not have thought to make a Greek dish with turkey but it was delicious!

This is worth making for the sauce alone!  I used diced chicken instead of turkey and added about an 1/8 cup of minced mint leaves to the sauce.  One of my favorite things to eat!!

Awesome. Such a great lunch. I added some feta cheese and olives. I used the leftover cucumber sauce to snack on by dipping veggies in it. I also added some dill to the sauce. YUM.  Loved this. Thanks! ( ADD DILL!!!!)

Pretty good idea. The sauce was a little bland so next time I will double the garlic, but we really love garlic in our house.

We loved this!  It was great for leftover turkey.   Made exactly as recipe states.  Next time, I'll half the sauce (we ran out of turkey long before the sauce) and go ahead and use the whole cucumber.

Made a cold version of this. Very good. I used deli turkey instead of roasted turkey because that's what I had on hand -- next time I'll use the roasted turkey for better flavor.

Very good but the sauce need more flavor, try adding garlic and onion. Also, let it sit overnight.

This was soooo yummy! Both me and husband loved it! 
The only changes i made was i used iceberg lettuce, light sour cream and added feta cheese as well. Just heated the pitas in the microwave for 10 sec to warm up, because they got too hard in the oven and it was just plan easier that way. 
Thanks so much for the yummy recipe.

Great recipe! The cucumber sauce is delicious! I substituted turkey for  pre-fab chicken strips and the pita bread for tortilla shells which cut down on prep time slightly.

I used a rotisserie chicken instead of turkey and it was delicious!  The only thing I would change would be to just mix the chicken into the cucumber sauce first and then fill the pitas!  That way it is more like a chicken salad.

Used chicken instead of turkey. As per someone's suggestion, wrapped foil around pita in oven (good idea - came out moist). Was a little disappointed in the sauce as everyone was so hot about it. It was good but not more. Perhaps a day or two in the fridge for the flavors to mingle.

This recipe was just okay.  Next time I would use less oregano and add a splash of lemon to brighten it up a bit.  The sauce was, as my husband put it "dead on delicious"  This is a good recipe to use up all your leftover turkey in a new and healthful way.

Yum, yum, yum!  We couldn't get enough of this! The only thing I changed was to add a bit more garlic, but then again, I add extra garlic to everything.  We will definitely be making this again!
