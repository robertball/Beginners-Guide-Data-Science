Loved the recipe. But I used 8oz vanilla yogurt in place of the pineapple. Fab-u-lous

I thought this would be a nice change on a breakfast muffin and even though it looked heavier, it would be a nice indulgence.  I wasn't sure how full to fill these, so, I filled 3/4 full and I got 28 muffins.  They didn't rise very much and stayed close to the same size as when the muffins were uncooked. I saw the amount of oil in these cupcakes and it seemed like too much for the amount of ingredients.  I decided to stay with the ingredients in the recipe and instead I should have followed my instinct.  They were WAY too oily.  I would decrease the amount of oil to 1 cup and it may still be too much. The amount of oil resulted in not only a greasy muffin, but, an incredibly dense muffin.  It was also much too sweet for our taste.  2 cups of sugar is a lot!  I would have given these muffins a 2 star rating because they were really sweet & oily, but, my husband thought they were ok, so, I went with a three star.   I would not make these again because there would be too many changes for me to get these to work.
