Outstanding!  I simplified the ingredients list by eliminating Anaheim chile peppers, cayenne pepper, oregano, red pepper flakes and Worcestershire sauce. Also eliminated salt and reduced oil to 2 tablespoons (just enough to cover the bottom of the baking dish and brush onto the fish). Substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes. I didn't have Creole Seasoning, so I threw in a combination of Cajun and Chipotle spices, Ancho Chili Powder, and I brushed some Creole Mustard onto the fish.  Served with a side of Tri-colored Couscous and asparagus.

I loved this dish, as did hubby. I left out the red pepper and half the cayenne to cut down on the spice, and I left out the wine since I didn't have any and don't like it anyway. I used lemon instead of lime and dried cilantro rather than fresh because that's what I had. Definitely worthy of making again! I served it with "Spanish Rice Original" from this site, which was also a winner. Yum!

I reduced the amount of oil used to lighten it up a bit and cut back on some of the salt as well - delicious and perfectly spicy - wonderful recips and sure to be a future favorite.

This recipe is awesome!!  It appears chic/high class but is really quite simple to make.  The first time I prepared it, I found it too salty and a little too spicy.  The second around, I eliminated all the salt (the Creole season I use has a good amount in it already) and cut out the cayenne...PERFECTION!!

This was fabulous!  I had six people so increased the servings.  Added one more chile and couple cloves garlic (we love extra) simmered more than 20 mins to cook down.... but stayed true to the rest of recipe and it got raves. Also great over chicken breasts prepared the same way.  Served with the Best Spanish Rice recipe and dinner was a huge success. Will definitely serve again!

Excellent!  I normally don't like fish and have been looking for a recipe that is good enough that I can add to regular rotation.  This dish did it!  I'm very happy that I'll now be able to have fish on a regular basis.  Restaraunt quality for sure!

This was delicious, but, like other reviewers suggested, DO NOT ADD MORE SALT!  There is enough salt in the Creole seasoning already.  I  think it's more flavorful to use canned tomatoes instead of fresh, but drain them (I forgot).  I served it over red  Quinoa, which is a nice alternative to rice and does a good job absorbing liquid.

We reall enjoyed this.  I cut way back on the olive oil to make this more figure friendly and the fish still had great flavor.  The sauce was excellent.

I really wanted to make this for dinner but didn't have a lot of the specific ingredients so I substituted a bunch.  I used canned tomatoes to save time on prep work, drained them. Also, instead of the Anaheim chile pepper, which I didn't have on hand, I used a sweet red pepper. Didn't have any creole seasoning so I used random spices from the cupboard - dried parsley and cayenne powder. Also, I had a red onion instead of the yellow onion. It all turned out just fine and tasted awesome! My boyfriend even liked it, and that rarely happens. Mine ended up kind of soupy so the rice was a good thing to have to soak up a lot of the juice, and baking the fish made it so flaky and yummy! I gave this recipe one less star though because it turned out soupy and I generally don't dishes like that, however, this was really good still. Thanks!

Awesome!  My whole family LOVED it!  I used a poblano chili, a bit of banana chili, and cajun seasoning.  The taste is SOOO amazing.  Thanks!

I was looking for a new way to make Tilapia and this didn't disappoint!  It had great flavor with a bit of a bite.  The next time I make it (which I surely will), I would probably use a little less salt.  I plan on using the leftover sauce on top of a baked potato!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Mmmmmm It was great! Used Creole Seasoning Blend from this site, used canned fire roasted tomatoes and green peppers instead of the Anaheim. Oh, and I didn't have wine so I used a splash of Tequila instead :) I served it over brown rice with an extra splash of lime juice. **** UPDATE: I bought Creole seasoning and this time the fish came out waaaaay salty, so if you use store-bought seasoning, you might want to cut back or omit the extra salt.

Delish! I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was too salty. Don't add extra salt if using a creole seasoning like Tony Chacheres. Otherwise it was absolutely delicious! I served the fish on top of Santa Fe rice with creamed spinach on the side. Had alot of extra sauce left over.

This was a delicious recipe. I used vermouth instead of white wine for extra herbiness and I used home grown crushed Thai Chili peppers instead of cayenne, and used more garlic because my family loves spicy.  Will make again!

This should be the first recipe that pops up when you type in "tilapia."  So unique and delicious.  I tried to follow the recipe as close to exact as possible, but I always use less oil (olive oil from a spray bottle can greatly reduce the total amount) and no butter.  I didn't realize that I was out of any kind of stock until I had already starting making this, so I just used water and it had plenty of flavor.  I also didn't add any salt and it was plenty salty.  But all of the other seasonings, lime juice, peppers, onions, tomatoes, olives are a must!  I really let the sauce simmer to reduce the amount of liquid and make it more like a warm topping.  It was perfect.  The boy really liked it and he swears he hates tomatoes.  I have also made this with cod and I think I like it even better, but I love cod to begin with.  This recipe is a keeper and a refreshing change of pace from the same old ways of preparing fish.

I followed this recipe exactly and my family raved about it.  Even my picky 13 year old son cleaned his plate.  However, next time they requested I make it WITHOUT the sauce!!  I have to agree, the fish was amazing right out of the oven and didn't need the sauce thrown on top (which also makes this recipe 10 times easier to cook)!  I still give it 5 stars.

I did not have the cayenne pepper, the black olives or the other special pepper. Nor did I have creole seasoning. I made the recipe exactly as stated except for these ingredients and I used a few Spanish olives in place of the black olives. It was absolutely delicious.

VERY SPICY!! We like spicy and this was almost too spicy to eat. I will make it again but cut out some of the hot spices. Great taste and fun to make. The fish was perfect, just the sauce was too spicy.

YUM! So I changed a few things...like no black olives, since I didn't have any, a regular tomato b/c I didn't have any roma either, and red Anaheim peppers instead of green. Maybe a completely different recipe, but all of the base ingredients turned out AH-mazing!! So glad I found this recipe.

Made this for me and my GF - it was DELICIOUS! I think I'm going to make it again tonight! A tad spicy, which we like, and could not find creole seasoning anywhere so we just did without it. Next time, I think I'm going to make my own creole spice...

Excellent recipe!  I made a few changes because I was missing ingredients.  I sprinkled the fillets with Cajun seasoning rather than Creole, I used a jalapeno rather than Anaheim pepper and I cut back on the olive oil.   I did use the kosher salt since I did not have the Creole seasoning but not as much as the recipe called for.  Next time I will be leaving the olives out completely.  They aren’t bad I just didn’t think they added anything to the overall flavor.  This is a fabulous recipe that I will be making again and again!

I was looking for something to zip up Talapia which tends to be a very blah fish.  This recipe did it.  I followed it exactly except left out the olives.  Everything worked well together and was a total success.

So yummy!  I will be making this again today.  My oven is on the fritz, so I actually made it a little differently -- after making the sauce, I laid the tilapia filets on top, covered it and simmered for just a few minutes until the fish was done.  (My kids don't like super spicy food, so I did not add any extra cayenne (beyond what was in the creole spice, and omitted the red pepper flakes -- which can be added after the fact).  I also used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the fresh romas.  Thanks for sharing!

The sauce with this is wonderful and there is plenty of it. I made just as written and it does have a kick to it.   I love serving it with spaghetti squash so you can use the sauce on the squash too.  A couple of my kids don't like fish so I'll substitute a couple of chicken breasts for them.

We really liked this. I used about 1 pound of fish and had plenty of sauce. I took the advice of others and did not salt the fish after the creole seasoning but I did salt the sauce. I also left out half of the red pepper flakes as others suggested. It was still plenty spicy. I did not have any wine so I used a tablespoon or so of sherry. After 20 minutes I felt my sauce was still too thin so I used a bit of corn starch to thicken it. Worked great and the sauce stayed on top of the fish instead of running onto the plate. I'll make this again.

We loved this.  Couldn't follow it to the letter but came close. (used half a bell pepper instead of Anaheim; cajun seasoning instead of creole)  As written it is SPICY so back off on the cayenne and red pepper flakes if you can't take the heat.  Great with pasta on the side, covered in the sauce.  Yum.  My family is usually ho-hum about tilapia because it's so mild.  This really wakes it up and makes it tasty.  Thank you Gibson!!!

this was excellent. Only used enough oil to brush over filets and it was enough. couldn't find 'creole seasoning' so used Cajun. Yummy. Definitely will be making this a lot.

It was ok, but needlessly complicated, and it definitely didn't need that cup of chicken broth in the salsa. If I make it again, which I'm not sure I will, I won't even touch the fish until the salsa is cooked. And I'll add 3/4 of the cilantro to the salsa as it cooks and save 1/4 for garnishing the finished dish, because sprinkling it over the tilapia before baking is a waste. No flavor contribution at all. Also, why use butter instead of oil? With all the bold flavors, you'll never taste it.  And I'll saute the fish in a cast iron skillet and not bother with the oven at all.

I made it as written except, left out the Anaheim Chile pepper,  black olives, butter and wine because I did not have these on hand. I also did not add extra salt, since many reviewers said to be cautious of that. This turned out wonderful! My husband couldn't get enough, he even asked for seconds and he's not a fan of tilapia. This is now in my rotation!

Very good, very simple dish. A word of advice though, don't add any salt, kosher or otherwise, the creole seasoning is quite salty enough. Other than that, very nice recipe!

So I ran out of time tonight so  made the fish & look forward to updating my review when I have time to make the sauce with it. Great fish! I served it with maple roasted brussel sprouts with bacon& brown rice. This was easy& fast. I left out the pepper for personal taste.

The prep time was significant. My husband appreciated the effort, but did not finish the dish. 
Perhaps revamping the ingredients, as suggested by several other reviewers, would help improve the recipe.

This was delicious!! Did not have olives on hand, and per other reviews, I omitted the salt, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper and chili pepper (my creole seasoning is a spicy rub - "Todd's Bayou Dirt" - and I wasn't sure how my 4 y/o would handle it.) It did have a nice kick, and the sauce was AMAZING. Hubby loved all of it & had seconds! so glad we found this recipe! It's now in my favorites!

We will certainly be making this again!  I left off the olive oil and just coated the fillets with seasoning and broiled for 8 mins (just our preference).  Made the sauce as directed, but added an extra anaheim and a zucchini for a bit of texture.  Then cooked up some pearl couscous and added to the last 10 mins of simmering.

I didn't have all the ingredients, probably why it only got 3 stars.

Very full of flavor.  Wanted to try a new way to cook tilapia. I had all ingredients in house (except aneheim chili pepper - substituted a poblano instead) Will be my go to recipe.

Will keep this recipe. I made my own creole seasoning from this website, but cut the salt down a little bit and was missing onion powder. We had 9,000 lume cayenne pepper and I don't know how that compares to the usual so I decided to omit it from the sauce. The only salt I used was in the creole mixture. I used non stick spray in the pan and just brushed olive oil on the fish. I put the remaining spice on my husband's piece and he remarked that it was quite spicy which is a first. Glad I didn't add more.  Quite tasty. I used a 14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes that I blended in place of the whole tomatoes.  I used too much chopped onion by mistake, but it was fine.

This was just ok.  I don't know what I did differently from everyone else.  The only substitution I made was to use sole instead of tilapia but I don't think that should've been a big factor. Too me, it seemed to have too much flavor: too much salt, too much lime, too much cilantro.  And the sauce...that was a lot of sauce and it was watery.  Too much sauce.  Anyway, it took me a long time to make this and my son hated it.  Not worth figuring it out.  There are so many other fish recipes that my son loves and take just a small fraction of the time.

Absolutely delicious! I had to make a couple adjustments based on what I had - kalamata olives instead of regular black olives and red wine instead of white. The kalamatas were great, but I think it made the dish a little too salty. Next time I will wait till the end to salt.
