This turned out great! I do think the flour could use double the amount of seasoning but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

READ THIS BEFORE YOU MAKE IT:
Like the others said, this needs a ton more of seasoning and salt. (I'd say at least 3 tablespoons salt, double the garlic powder) On top of that, 2 cups of flour is more than enough as there was a huge amount of it wasted at the end. 
Also I recommend 10+ minutes in the fryer to get that golden crusty goodness.

Turned out perfect!  This is an easy recipe and can be tweaked by adding more seasoning. Made Valentine snacks with these.

Used the recipe as a guide and adjusted the flavours to what I had and like  ( maple bacon rub, seasoning salt, garlic powder,  paprika and black pepper) I adjusted the flour ratio to the chicken I had on hand.  I subbed a couple dashes of Frankâ€™s Red Hot instead of lemon with the egg mixture.  
My husband loved these.  They turned out very tasty and a wonderful crispy batter.

It would have been better, had I ate it once it was ready. Instead I took it to work for lunch, maybe it was made to eat asap
