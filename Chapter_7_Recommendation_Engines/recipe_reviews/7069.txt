This recipe was awesome but I did make some minor changes that were well worth it. Instead of 2 cups of sugar I did as was suggested by another and used 1-1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I used Crisco butter shortening, omitted the cloves and nutmeg and used only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon (personal preference) I used pecans instead of walnuts and I only had five bananas but apparently they were good size ones cause the bread was very banana tasting. I got A LOT of compliments and I will definitely make this again!!  I put it in smaller loaf pans making 8 and for a variation on it - the batter for the last four pans I added milk chocolate chips which was more popular than the 'plain'. If you are going to make this - try the milk chocolate chips - totally awesome.

this is not your typical banana bread at all, and why i love it so very much and is the only banana bread recipe i use.
there are a lot of spices but that's part of what i love about it, if you want something more like the usual banana bread then this isn't really for you.

i've made this quite a number of times and have done the original recipe as well and it always turns out yummy.

i use applesauce in place of the shortening (healthier), add an extra banana, do half white and half brown sugar. 
(i have done part whole wheat flour as well but usually don't have it on hand.)

Yum! I followed others recommendations by 1) Using 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and 2) Halving the amounts of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg called for.  I also added a dash of vanilla and drizzled melted butter on top.  FYI-mini loaves took 35 minutes in my oven to cook.  Nice and crispy on the top and edges, but nice and soft on the inside...mmmm. And not too sweet either - just right. Thanks!

I have tried many Banana Bread recipes in my life, looking for just the right one. And I have found it in this one. I really don't like Bananas, but this one I LOVE!! My whole family LOVED this one too. When I was making it I thought, this isn't working it is much to running. But I waited it out (about 1hr 15 minutes) and it turned out perfect. I will never use another recipe. Thank you so much so submitting this one for everyone.

I found that the spices over-powered the banana flavor, and it turned out more like a spice cake than banana bread. I would suggest using 1/2 the cinnamon, and omit the nutmeg and cloves if you are seeking a more "traditional" flavor. The bread did have good texture, so I won't give up on this recipe. It was less "dense" than recipes that call for sour cream.

This is the best banana bread I've ever made! I had been using another recipe that used sour cream also but it was always so dense.  This is the perfect recipe - not too dry, too heavy or too light, and the cinnamon/sugar mixture that bakes on the crust adds a little something extra.  YUM!

I am usually a bit disappointed when I attempt to make something for the first time,  mainly because it doesn't turn out the way I imagined so I end up making a few adjustments so it that the next time it comes out the way I think it should as far as taste, consistency, and so on..........BUT...........  this recipe is 100% PERFECT!!!!!  I did leave out some of the spices because I happen to be allergic to nutmeg and don't care too much for the taste of cloves but  this is still THE most delicious and absolute moistest banana bread I have ever eaten in my life!  Make this and you will forever be known for your skills at baking!!  Bravo! and thank you so much for posting this recipe, it's truly awesome!

What is the conversion of bananas to a cup measurement? I cut the recipe in half and used 3 bananas but it appears that there is too much banana compared with the dry ingredients. I wish recipe was more specific! I don't know how it will come out so I am giving it a 3 * for now...

This was very good, and very moist.  Was even better after it had "aged" a couple days.  I thing I did do was add 1/2 Teaspoon of banana flavoring. Sometimes the bananas just don't have the deep flavor you want, so I add this to enhance the flavor a little more.  I got 12 mini loaves out of a batch.

Had a wonderful taste esp. when you add pecans to it.  Has a light, cakey texture which makes it more like a dense cake.

Finally found a great banana bread recipe.  Mixed and baked as directed, didn't change a thing (why do people review a recipe here and then add all the things they did differently?)  I found this recipe very tasty.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe as stated with the exception of substituting 1/2 teaspoon allspice for the nutmeg.  (I was out of nutmeg.)  I love the consistency of this cake.  I do suggest mashing the bananas very well.  If you like a lot of spice, this is the cake for you.  Thanks Candace!

I have tried so many different banana bread recipes and this one was perfect. Not only was it light and fluffy, but it was incredibly moist and had just the right amount of sweetness. It also made a ton of bread, which was great because I needed to feed a ton of people. I'm sure the recipe is great as is, but I made a few changes. I used 3/4 cup of butter and substituted the last quarter with half a cup of applesauce. Instead of 2 cups of white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar, 3/4 cup of dark brown sugar and a tablespoon of honey. This was more than enough sweetness. As for the flour, I used half whole wheat and half unbleached all-purpose flour. I also omitted the nuts and cloves. Some people said they cut the other spices in half, but I thought it was just right! The smell is heavenly!

I cut this recipe in half to make one big loaf. I made one substitution and used a stick of margerine in place of the shortening. This smells very good, like a combination of bananas and eggnog.

I made half the recipe, and baked it for 65 minutes, and it came out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly, and after tasting it I don't see a need for change.  My wife even complemented me on how well it tasted.  Fantastic recipe that is easy to make and made to enjoy!

Bread tastes ok, very moist. When loaves started to cool down after baking, the center of each loaf fell down. Won't be using this recipe again.

Awesome!  Used half the amount of spices, 1 3/4c Sugar, 3/4c walnuts(what I had on hand) and 1/2c of diced dried apricots.  So moist...a keeper for sure.

Awesome! So much better than coffee shop or groccery store banana bread. The recipe my mom made was much more dense, but I really liked this lighter version too.  I only did a 1/2 batch, I forgot to add the walnuts somehow, and only used 1/2 the cloves. It was still great. Perfect for fall! I couldn't find my loaf pan so I baked it in a greased angel food pan for 1 hr. Because it is so light, I might actually serve it as a cake with some lemon glaze.

Best banana bread I've ever made!! I've been experimenting with different recipes and this is by far the best!!  I did make some adjustments: I'm not a big fan of shortening so I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup of extra virgin coconut oil. Came out awesome! Also followed the other recommendations and used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. and omitted the cloves and nutmeg. Used pecans instead of walnuts. I think I over-baked the bread, but that was my fault  :)  Probably would've been good at around 55 minutes, or so.  This will definitely be my banana bread recipe from now on!!  Thanks so much!!  :)

I have been making this recipe since 2001 and always have rave reviews.  It is always moist and freezes extremely well.  I have even substituted with pumpkin and made an awesome pumpkin bread with it.

I *love* this recipe! I throw this together often, the only changes I've made are wholewheat flour, a splash of vanilla, and I use real butter & pecans. This always turns out SO DELICIOUSLY MOIST. Seriously, I can't get enough of this wonderful banana bread recipe - thanks so much for sharing it!

Made this yesterday.  Excellent!!!  Husband told me to make it often.  Everyone that tasted it loved it.  I followed the recipe.  The only thing I may try in the future is to cut the spices in half.  This is a very moist and tender bread.  WONDERFUL!!!

Very moist, great flavor.  However, to suit my own personal tastes, I would leave out the cloves and nutmeg.  It seemed that so many spices overwhelmed the banana taste.  Next time I will only use the cinnamon.

This is the most moist banana bread recipe I've ever tried.  The whole loaf was almost gone the first night.  I did try a variation, I substituted butter and crisco oil instead of shortening.  

This recipe is a keeper!!!

This bread is very moist and really tasty. The bananas came out to 2 cups of mashed bananas (Sam asked in a previous review). I cut all of the spices in half for my kids taste buds but it would be just as good as the recipe stated. This is a keeper!

The banana flavor is gone behind the spices.  It's more like a not-too-special spice cake instead of banana bread.  I wouldn't make it again.

Absolutely the best banana bread. My son-in-law raved about it and I won't use another recipe again. I added raisins instead of nuts and I may try both next time. Thanks

I love this banana bread! Great texture and tones of spicey flavor! I agree with the other review that it has too much ground cloves (makes it a little harsh).  Next time I will only put half the amount the recipe calls for.  I baked it at 325 for an hour and 10 minutes and it came out PERFECT!  Thank you!

I make this Banana Bread a few times a month.Our family either eats the whole bunch of bananas all in one day one or they sit and get brown.  So this is the best recipe I have found. It is so moist, and gets better after a day or so.

I think this is a fairly good banana bread recipe, but not extraordinary.  I normally like the taste of ground cloves, but here I think I would omit it.  It overpowered the banana taste. I think I'd like it to have a stronger banana flavor, so maybe adding an extra one would help. The bread came out really moist and had a nice texture. People in my office gobbled it down, so it's definitely a *good* recipe, but not outstanding.

Delicious!  I substituted butter for the shortening (which I never use because it's loaded with trans fats which are terrible for you)...next time may try applesauce as one review suggested to save on calories.  I also didn't add the nutmeg or cloves (only because I didn't have any) and added vanilla.  I was going to do 1/2 all purpose & 1/2 whole wheat flour but my daughter used all the all purpose flour the other day & didn't tell me we were out so I used all whole wheat (can't tell the difference in taste anyway - I don't think).  Did 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar.  Very moist with a little crisp to the top which I LOVE and the house smelled incredible for a hours! This is a keeper!

I didn't want to make 2 loaves of bread, but now I am glad I did.  It took about 65 minutes altogether to cook, and the bread is still very moist and delicious.  The only thing I changed in this recipe was I cut down on the salt and instead of 2 cups of sugar, I used one cup brown sugar with one cup granulated sugar. Good choice!

This bread was very good.  I couldn't decide whether I wanted the spices in or omitted as suggested by some responses, so I split the dough in half, and did one loaf with all the spices and one with no cloves or nutmeg, and only half the cinnmon.  They both taste great, but my partner prefers the one with less spice, so that's what I'll make in the future.

This is one of the worst "banana" breads I have ever made. I followed the recipe to a T.  It smelled wonderful while baking, and tasted okay, but the texture was all wrong.  I will never use this recipe again. I am so dissapointed and sad that I wasted 6 bananas :(

Followed the Recipe pretty closely. No nuts and had only 5 bannanas. I used glass loaf dishes cooked for 45 mins then another 15 mins and almost overdone. Tastes fantastic...I'm glad it was enough for 2 loafs :)

12.19.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7069/special-banana-bread/ ... Pretty good, but not very identifiable as banana.  K likes better.  I only put in 1/2t cloves & 1/2t nutmeg - & the cinnamon as listed.

This is a wonderfully moist and satisfying banana bread with a good texture. I cut down the spices to half so as not to overpower the delicious taste of the banana and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I will definitely make this bread again----yummy!!

This recipe is great!  I think I might try cutting the cinnamon to 1 tsp and adding a tsp of vanilla next time, just to see what that does.  But I could easily make this just as is over and over again.

Good as written, but just decadent with 1 1/2 -  2 cups butter as the shortening.  We can't stop eating it!

Wonderful and loved the spices.  This is a keeper.  I can't wait until the bananas over ripen!  When my husband had it at lunch, coworkers wanted some it smelled so good.  He did not want to give this one away! :)

Great Recipe!  Very moist without being overwhelmingly sweet.  I think it would be even better with a crumb topping.  The top of my cake turned dark before the insides were cooked.  Next time I would start cooking with the dish covered with foil.  I added diced apples which turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll definitely be using it again!!

I thought this bread was great. I was not sure if my husband would like the change but he even commented how good it was. I wanted to try something a little different then my usual banana bread.  For our personal taste, I did cut back using half of the spices and there was plenty of taste.  I will definitely make again.

I searched this website for the best banana bread recipe and this is certainly a great one.  It is very moist and flavorful.  I made it last night and 11/2 of the loaves are already gone.  Delicious - thanks!!!

I halved the recipe, added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, left out the cloves (only because I was too lazy to grind some whole cloves that I have), and used four 9 inch bananas and baked in a 10 x 6 loaf pan. 
THE best banana bread I've ever had. Took a while for the center to bake (68 min) and I was afraid because it was getting rather dark on the outside, but I figured if it was burnt I would just cut off the outside. It wasn't burnt, but deliciously dark, almost like I added chocolate. I swear it even tasted somewhat chocolatey! Didn't have a hint of burnt taste. It's so good! See my photo of it. 
I am gonna get soooooooo fat! 
Great recipe!

Some of the best Banana bread I have ever had. I used pecans instead of the walnuts because that is what I had on hand but it was very good.

My new Go-to recipe for Banana bread! Made some small changes. Omitted the cloves, increased the Cinnamon to 1 TBL and used 1 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C dark brown sugar.

I cut the fat in half substituting it with applesauce and cut the sugar in half substituting it with Stevia. It is AMAZING!!! Since I am not sensitive to spices and enjoy a full bodied flavor, the spices were right on the mark for me. This is by far my favorite Banana Bread recipe, it is going in my recipe book to be handed down to future generations.

This bread turned out super moist and yummy.  I, of course, made some adjustments...
-Used whole wheat flour to replace about half of the white flour
-I substituted about half the white sugar with brown sugar
-Added about 3/4 of a cup of raisins
-I was out of nutmeg, so substituted 1/2 t. Mace
-Used pecans instead of walnuts
-The only really oddball thing I did was to use about 2/3 of a cup of chia seeds that had been soaking in water, so had become a thick, but pourable, liquid (3/4 of a cup of the thick liquid/seeds, not of the dry seeds).  I did this because my bananas were pretty small, and I was worried about the moisture as a result.

I love this banana bread and so does my family AND all my husband's coworkers! The spices are one of the things we like the most, especially the fresh ground nutmeg! I substitute butter for the shortening, use 1/2 dark brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, use ALL the spices (including freshly grated nutmeg,) and substitute 1 cup mini chocolate chips for the nuts.  Sometimes I divide the batter in half and add nuts to half and mini chocolate chips to the other half, getting two different loaves. Thank you so much for this recipe! It's my signature banana bread and I keep frozen bananas in the freezer to make it as often as I can!

I really made a lot of banana bread with this recipe and I didn't change a thing! It was moist yet dense and that is what I love about it! It has a lot of bananas in it and the spices make it really delish!! I tried another one on here that used sour cream and it was moist and good, although my family still liked it, it was not as much banana or spicy flavor nor the denseness to it. I prefer this one best!
