This is the "Copy Cat" recipe for the Caesar dressing at OutBack Steak House. This is my husband's favorite dressing. We just don't tell him there are anchovies in the dressing

Can't say that I was thrilled with this.  Followed the directions to the letter, but I think it would have been better with olive oil rather than canola, and I think it also needs a healthy squeeze of lemon juice.  I made this with my immersion blender and, yes, it's appropriately named because it is easy.  However, it just doesn't come close enough to a real caesar salad dressing to be a viable compromise for me.  Sorry Angielin, I wish I could have given it a better review.

The recipe wasn't authentic tasting at all. 
My quick and easy recipe for Caesar dressing is equal parts olive oil and mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon of worchestershire sauce, add  juice of a lemon, 1/2 can of anchovies, add one clove of garlic and a few grinds of freshly ground black pepper and sea salt into a food processor. Blend until smooth.
 Toss with iced/crisped romaine lettuce and add the remaining anchovies on top with a sprinkling of freshly ground romano.

I bought some Kraft Caesar dressing to make Chicken Caesar wraps for my finicky son. Once I got home and tasted it I knew he would never eat it. So, I found this recipe. I literally wrote WOW and underlined it on the recipe card! Fantastic Dressing! I had to stop myself from "sampling" it. Just an awesome recipe. Thanks Angielin!

I made this last minute. It was very easy, and tasted very good. My kids are picky eaters and they finished the Caesar salad quickly they couldn't get enough, they asked me to make more next time.

I didn't make this as I found another recipe that more mirrored what I would like.  I used olive oil, anchovies, lemon juice, worcestirshire sauce, red wine vinegar,  egg, garlic, salt and pepper.  To give it over the edge I added two tbs Parmesan cheese.  To die for, lol

Simple, easy and definitely tasty to make. I use anchovies from Italy and also the oil they are packed in (just 4 additional teaspoons of it) and this dressing is a hit every time.  I chill it out of the food processor for 20minutes in an ice bath in the freezer and it is awesome.

I used 1 egg instead of egg beaters and olive oil. Because I was out of anchovy paste and had only tins of anchovies (didn't want to pop a tin for 2 anchovies), I worried about insufficient umami flavor. The anchovy wasn't missed at all, the Worcestershire sauce provided a good savory note. Either would do fine on it's own. What was missing was acid. With only 2 teaspoons of mustard to brighten ? cup oil, the flavor was quite muddy and flat. After adding 1 tablespoon lemon juice, it was considerably improved. With that modification, 4 stars.

Too oily for my taste..lacking in flavor. I can't begin to tell you how I "fixed" it... more garlic, probably would do half oil the oil, added lemon, apple cider, more black and white pepper, it was a hot mess. Will try a different recipe next time. sorry

Not a keeper for us.  Not a true Caesar flavor.
