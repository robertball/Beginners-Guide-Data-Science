This had a great flavor although I tweaked the recipe a little bit. I used fresh minced garlic instead of powder and split the amount needed for soy sauce, half soy sauce half worcestershire sauce(bc i love it)and substituted chili powder instead of chili sauce and marinated for about 4 hours and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!

My family really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe. I made a few changes though, I used 1 1/2 T of chili sauce, one teaspoon of minced garlic and added 2 t of dijon mustard. I cut down on the soy sauce as well to a 1/2 cup and may even cut it down a little further as the one comment was that it was a little salty.

These pork chops are pretty good, but I think a lot of people might be confused with this recipe...  I read through the reviews and most complained of them not being "spicy", but they used the chili powder or chili sauce - the kind you find in the grocery store next to the ketchup which isn't really spicy at all.  I'm not sure, but based on the recipe title and the list of ingredients the submitter may have intended for people to chili garlic sauce, you know the kind you find in the Asian section of your grocery store, now that stuff has a bit more kick to it! I cut the recipe in half, used chili garlic sauce, minced garlic instead of powder, added a little sesame oil, and a pinch of ginger.  I let them marinate all day and grilled them.  They came out very moist and had a nice "spice" to them.

I've used this recipe for several years.  It's my family's favorite for Pork Chops.  The only difference is the recipe I use calls for 1/4 cup soy instead of 3/4 cup.  Everything else is exactly the same.  I use really thick pork chops from Sam's club.  I freeze the chops in a Ziploc bag with the marinade.  When need a quick meal, I just thaw and grill.

My family loved this Chops recipe. I didn't have chili sauce so I used chili powder instead. It wasn't very spicy, my toddlers were able to eat them. We are making these for dinner this weekend for family coming into town!!

I have been using this recipe for several years and we never get tired of it! I do use minced garlic, use lite La Choy soy sauce,and I double the marinade recipe. I also use a charcol grill, place on hot grill, to get a good sear,then move them to the side where the heat is less, then baste with the marinade often, and close the lid for a few minutes at a time, for tenderness.
I always make enough for two nights dinner and they are just as good the second evening!

I didn't have fresh lemon juice so I used bottled lemon juice and I had boneless chops, so it was little different than the picture, I let them marinate for about 7 hours and then my husband grilled them we really enjoyed the sweet and spicy taste...thanks

Everyone said they were the best pork chops they've ever tasted!!! Used chilli powder instead less than 1 tbsp. and bottled lemon juice and only marinated for an hour.  Will cook many more times. Easy to make!!

This marinade had a very nice flavor! Extremely easy to make( bottled lemon juice works great). The chops were moist and tender. My family loved! I will make again. It's nice to have a new recipe for the grill. Thank you

I've made this before but never rated it - we had it again last night and it's just great! No changes to the ingredients needed - however sometimes I just bake the chops and they're very good that way too.

These were good; they weren't spicy though, which is fine.  We ate these up but my husband couldn't tell the difference between these and Chinese Pork Chops on this site; so if you've made and liked that recipe this one is basically the same.

These were great; flavourful and moist after about 6 hours marinating time. I went with Chili-garlic sauce as the "chili sauce" and as per another reviewer, as I wasn't sure what kind the submitter meant, and only used 1/4 cup soya sauce so that they wouldn't be too salty. I made up the difference with the juice of one large orange. Make sure to only cook about 4-5 minutes per side (high grill heat) so that the chops do not dry out.

I found the pork chops extremely salty and not spicy at all. If I were to try this recipe again, I would have to use a sodium reduced soy sauce to make it more edible and add more and different spices. Really it's more like a teriyaki.

Very good and very similar to a recipe I use for pork tenderloin.  The next time the only change I will make is to up the chili sauce.  We like it spicy and with the amount of soy the Tbl. gets lost.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a great recipe. I made it exactly as written and we really enjoyed it. We will definitely make it again, but would reduce the soy sauce by 1/4 C.  This is not "spicy" but very flavorful!

This is by far my favorite recipe. The entire family LOVED it! Since the first time ive made it, ive received numerous requests to make it again, and AGAIN! The only change I made was that I added red pepper flakes. However, it is not necessary to add anything in my opinion.

Words do not begin to describe how simple and DELISH this is!  My husband is incredibly tight with his 5s, and even he said this marinade easily warrants that.  It's so flavorful but not overwhelming at all. It's like each ingredient hits you separately, but they enhance each other rather than competing.  Only change I made was using hot chili powder rather than sauce since I couldn't find the sauce.  Used an almost full tablespoon to compensate for the powder being more concentrated but we still really like hot.  Turned out perfect!!

My fiance does not like pork, but he LOVED these pork chops.  He even asked if we could eat them again the next night.  I served it with the Tangy Coleslaw also found on allrecipes, the tangy flavor was a great compliment to the sweet/ spicy pork chops.

Excellent.  I only had time to marinate for five hours and it still turned out absolutely perfect, nice and moist and the cooking time was right on the money.   I didn't tweak this recipe at all, and I can only imagine that it will even better the next time because I'll marinate it longer.

These were VERY GOOD!  I did change the amts of the ingredients though I did use the right ingredients. 1/4 cup soy, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1/4 cup chili sauce, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2  minced garlic cloves.  Used boneless pork chops and grilled them to perfection.  The ingredients together made for a very savory marinade!   THANKS

This was BY FAR the best pork chop recipe I've ever tasted.  Before this you couldn't even get me to eat pork chops.  The only thing I did differently was that I used 1/2 cup of chili sauce.  DELICIOUS!!!

Ugh.  I followed this recipe exactly, marinating for 8 hours, and the it was so sour from the lemon that it was inedible.  And we love lemon!

These were pretty tasty.But, not spicy.Made them on the grill and they came out very moist and tender.Will make again.Next time i will add some more chili sauce alone with other spices to "spice" them up a bit.Thanks for a great starter recipe :)

Delish!  I decreased the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce.  Couldn't locate my chili sauce so I used dried crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper.  Also used extra brown sugar and added a few squirts of dijon mustard as well as ginger powder, onion powder, chili powder.  I used boneless pork chops and marinated it for about 3 hours and then broiled it for 5 minutes on each side.  It turned out delicious!  I also took the marinade and boiled it and added cornstarch to make a thick sauce to dip the meat in.  Yummy!!

Ohhh so delicious! I actually just threw in the chops,then marinade and shoved them into the freezer for about 11 days when we needed something fast but has already been marinated and let me tell you,I was afraid that after 3 days the soy sauce would overpower everything because it sat too long but it actually still tasted as if I had just mixed it up that day! I loved the flavor and I actually just diced my chops and layer them in a bed of onions and baked them at 300 for 30 mins and they were terrific! I will definitely make this recipe again! I also quadrupled the chili sauce because it wasn't spicy enough.

Really good!  I only changed a few things.  I used chili powder, fresh garlic, Hungarian paprika, low sodium soy sauce, lime juice, and omitted the sugar.  Marinaded overnight and browned in butter.  Then, I made a pan sauce reduction with some no-salt beef broth, balsamic vinegar, red wine and raspberry preserves.  El Perfecto!

These were fantastic!  All 4 of my boys loved it!  I am not a huge pork chop fan but I am in love with these.  I plan on putting this recipe on my family menu.  I used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I used a tsp of dark chili powder and 3 tbsp of ketchup in place of the chili sauce because I didn't have any.  I used bottled lemon juice as well.  I only had 2 hours for marinating.  These were not too salty for our taste.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I used pork tenderloin and marinated overnight.  It ended up pretty salty and we did not get any real "spicy" flavor.

This was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it, especially my picky kids and husband.  I made it with Lea & Perons thick style worchestershire in place of the steak sauce, used a Scottish ale and Sonny's sweet BBQ sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow!!! These were the best pork chops I have ever had! I do decrease the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and add about 1/8 cup of water. Also use 1 tsp of fresh minced garlic in place of the powder. This recipe is amazing, thanks so much:)

Very tasty, easy recipe.  Did follow others advice and doubled the sauce recipe, (used remainder of soup and additional whole can) and added one can of cream of mushroom and one pack french onion soup mix.  If you use this much of the condensed onion soup make sure to increase the water proportionately.  Great dinner to add to my list.

I used chili paste (find in the asian section) instead of chili sauce.  It still was not spicy.  I will next time use more of that and add some other seeasonings to these....but these are very good just as they are if you are not looking for spicy.

I modified the recipe as suggested to reduce the soy sauce- I used 1/4c low sodium (ie low flavor) soy sauce and a few Tbps regular.  The rest I kept the same except adding a teaspoon of chili powder.  I'd say they came out with a pleasant kick but not overly spicy.  No one flavor dominated and they all worked well together, so I'd make it again with the soy sauce reduction and with or without the chili powder.

To use LoL Cat speak...... OM NOM NOM!!!!  I always have a tendency to dry out pork chops, especially on the grill.  These turned out perfectly for me on my first attempt.  I will be making these again.  The only change I made was to use lime juice as I did not have any lemon juice.

Delicious marrinade on the chops.  Adds a slightly sweet slightly salty slightly tangy taste to chops.  I would use a nice thick cut chop for this and grill to med at about 6min per side on high heat.

Should have reduced the soy sauce by A LOT, and added more chili sauce, as I thought there was nothing spicy about these chops. Nice and juicy, but not what we were expecting.

I would rate this a 3.5. Both my husband and I just thought they were ok but not great. The dominant flavour is soy sauce and you don't taste much else. I think it would benefit from using less soy sauce and adding some worchestershire sauce or sesame oil as suggested by others.

I wasn't particularly keen on this recipe. It seemed very salty to me, and I use low-sodium soy sauce. The lemon juice made it very sour also.

Amazing!!!! Direct quote from my husband: "I've never wanted to suck on a pork chop like candy before!!"   I used almost a tablespoon of chili powder instead of chili sauce (didn't want to buy a whole bottle just to use 1 T). I only had about 3 hrs to marinate it, so I can't even imagine how good it would be if marinated 6+ hours!

good base marinade. i didn't have garlic powder, so used fresh garlic, used sweet chilli sauce, and bottled lemon juice. All came out fine, i thought there would be far too much soy sauce, could be cut down a bit but actually, it was fine. My only complaint is that its quite thin, and this would have been great if it was slightly sticky. its a keeer though - my boyfriend loved it!

This was a great marinade. I added extra chili sauce, extra brown sugar and some canola oil. Then I had it marinade for two days. The pork was moist and juicy. I cooked the pork in the marinade and used the extra marinade over rice.

It was unanimous at dinner...these had too much of a soy sauce taste and not much else. I  followed the recipe and marinated for about 6 hours.  Then took them out to cool before frying them at 350 degrees in my electric skillet.They were saved by the sauce that I made from the marinate. I added some water (maybe 1/2 cup)and about 1/3 cup of honey, brought it to a rolling boil for about 15 minutes. It reduced down to about half what it was. Then I mixed a little cold water and cornstarch together and added it to the sauce as a thickener.I turn the heat down and  stir constantly for a few minutes. Thanks for the recipe, though.

I don't know what went wrong with this, I did half the recipe because I wasn't cooking for 8 people. It was way to salty and did not have a good after taste.

Used this marinade on thick sliced pork chops and then cooked them on the grill. They were fantastic. My family loved them and there were no leftovers. Pork chops were juicy and tender. The only change I made to the recipe was using chili powder because I didn't have any chili sauce. Will make this again!

Marinade was good.  I used 1/2 soy and 1/2 worstershire as recommended by other reviewers.  I used chili oil since that was what I had on hand.  No one thought this was spicy at all.  Will use red pepper flakes next time... maybe tabasco.  Otherwise this was a good recipe.

This recipe was alright, but we didn't love it.  It was very tender and moist, so I gave an extra star for that.  I will probably try this again, but with a few changes.

Very good marinade!  Instead of 3/4 cup of soy sauce, my husband used 1/2 cup and then added 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce.  He also added 2 T. of cayenne pepper for a kick.

I have not made pork anything in almost 9 years, but made this last night and we all LOVED it.  The soy sauce flavor was perfect, I may try more brown sugar and Chile sauce next time, not b/c it needs it, but just to try it!

Excellent!!  My family loved this, I  did change the Soy Sauce to 1/2 Cup, as
I didn't want it to be to salty tasting and I also added about 1/2 tsp. of Red
Hot Pepper Flakes as we do like things more on the hotter side!  The Chops come out nice a juicy! We will make this
often!

This Marinade is delicious! I cut back a little on the soy sauce and added fresh garlic. I let my pork chops marinate for 24 hours and they were perfect! Very flavorful and tender. Everyone enjoyed them and I will definitely keep this recipe around.

The recipe was good as is...with NO changes. I would use a low heat level on the grill as the sugar will carmalize quickly and burn.

I changed this recipe a little: used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and used chili powder instead of chili sauce (because I didn't have any). It turned out pretty good, but wasn't spicy at all (perhaps because I didn't put enough chili powder). Definitely a good recipe, but I will have to change a bit to make it spicier next time.

This is an excellent Marinade! I didn't have chili sause but I know it is very similar to ketchup...so I just used ketchup. ;) I also doubled the garlic powder Just because we like the flavor. I did the soy sauce 1/2c. + 1/4c. worchesterhire sauce.  I made it in the morning and let them marinade all day. Tasted Wonderful!! God is Mighty and Powerful! Praise Him all your days!

I did not like this at all.  I made a couple changes after reading comments such as replacing some of the soy sauce for worschestire sauce and adding some cayenne pepper to make it more spicey, but all it tasted like is soy sauce and still was not spicy

This was very tasty, altho certainly not spicy.  I used less soya sauce, no brown sugar and fresh garlic.  Also added a bit of water and oil, so the sauce wasn't so thick.  Only had time to marinade for a couple of hours but still delicious...I also had nice cuts of pork chops which I'm sure helped.

I did make some changes based on other reviews, but this turned out fantastic on the grill. I used both chili sauce and chili powder, cut the soy sauce to 1/8th of a cup, used worchestershire sauce also and marinated them for almost two days. The crispy fat from the grill was FULL of flavor. I usually cut of the fat but it was so yummy. Next time I will probably add a bit of cayenne pepper and paprika to kick the spice up. I may also use a spicier form of chili sauce. Thanks for the recipe to build on!

These turned out perfect. I marinated them overnight and then popped them into my George Foreman grill for 7 minutes. They came out perfectly cooked and really juicy.

This was way too salty.  It covered the taste of the chili sauce.  We want to try this recipe again, but we will use low sodium soy and possible cut the amount. Might even increase the chili sauce since we like it hot.

Recipe was good, but a little too much soy sauce taste for us.  Will try again, using less.  DH said leftovers made a good cold sandwich the next day.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! Probably the best pork chops I've had to date. The second time I made them, I added some Cyanne Pepper for some more heat! But thats just a personal touch... it's still great the way it is!

This recipes was great.  Don't get too caught up on being exact on the amounts!!  I added a bit of water to my marinade to thin it down and it was a huge hit in our household.  Thinning it usually ends up with more flavor in the meat but not the thick sauce you see in the picture.

This is a great base recipe for a marinade.  I won't go into detail on what I added as that completely changes the recipe, but suffice it to say that I made a couple additions.  Even so, I think this would be great on it's own as well.  Thanks!

I wasn't a big fan. It tasted too soy-saucey. The only thing that saved it was by dipping it into hot chile sauce on the side.

I used chili powder and 1/2 soy sauce - 1/2 worchester sauce.  I used bottled lemon juice. I let them marinate for 1 hour (I was short on time) and cooked them in the broiler.  They came out pefect.  My husband loved them and he's not huge on marinades.

Good flavor! I made a few modifications to the original recipe, as suggested by others. I decreased the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and added 2 more spoonfuls of brown sugar. I also increased the amount of chili sauce and added red pepper flakes because I wanted to really taste the "spice". I did not find the recipe to be too salty, it was just right. I will definitely make again.

As the Arctic air descends, we return to comfort food -- mashed potato, gravy, and, my favorite, pork chops.  Piles and piles of pork chops.  Go heavy on the chili powder and these spicy chops will blow a hole in your mouth.  Make sure to get them to the table, piping hot, for your friends and family to enjoy.

Look out...This is the best BBQ for Pork Chops you will ever find.  Have marinated chops with this recipe several times now and Grilled them.  It doesn't get any better than this.  Low sodium soy makes it less salty if that's what you prefer.  Charcoal grill maybe add some apple wood/other wood chips for more flavor if you wish.  Have fun with this easy and tasty recipe maybe try adding fresh ground ginger and Asian chili garlic for the chili sauce.

My wife makes me use soy sauce marinades against my better judgment. It overpowers the delicate flavor of pork and imparts an overly salty flavor.  This marinade did too.

I thought this recipe was really good! I've always stayed away from making pork chops on the grill because I thought they would get too dried out, but this marinade kept them nice and moist and the flavor was fantastic!

WOW. I havent had pork chops in probably 10 years since last living with my mom. This recipe has officially made me a Pork Chop lover. I used a Rendevouz rib dry rub in place of the chili powder (because my wife doesnt like spicy stuff) but followed the rest of the directions exactly and these chops turned out just great... Will definitely be making these again and again!

For a true sweet and sour flavor with a nip ,make sure you use Chinese chili sauce available at most local large grocery stores

This was a great Pork Chop, and so easy. My dad had me do every thing, From picking out the Chops at the store, and putting them in the Marinated bag, and then cooking them on the Grill. And everyone liked them...

Nobody mentions the brown sugar.  That's the best part for superb browning.  Roll scallops in brown sugar and bake or fry-best you'll ever have.

I don't usually like pork chops, but I did like this recipe.  Will probably cut the soy sauce down by half next time, maybe add more chile sauce, as it was definitely more salty than spicy.

Per others suggestion I used 1/2 soy sauce, 1/2 worcestershire sauce.  Didn't have chili sauce so used chili powder and fresh garlic.  Saved some of the marinade for basting, it was great.  Served with teriyaki noodles.

These were fantastic!  I didn't have Chili Sauce, but added a little (a couple of "squirts") Cocktail Sauce ( BTW Cocktail Sauce is Chili Sauce and horseradish)  I also 1/2'd the Soy Sauce with Worchestershire per other reviews and added a couple of shakes of Chili Powder.  I also used real garlic as well as the powder.  I didn't get to marinate them as long as I would have liked (about 2 hours), but they were really outstanding!!!  My chops were double cut and very thick.  I can't wait to try this again and marinate it even longer.  Thank you for the recipe!  It was just what I was looking for :)

Love this recipe! The longer you leave the meat in the seasoning the better it turns out. I love garlic and spice so I add a tad more garlic and chili sauce

This marinade is very yummy. I followed this recipe except I cooked it in a pan instead of a grill. I did not find it too salty; but then again I love soy sauce. My suggestion for those that love spicy, use more than 1 tablespoon. It tastes great as is, but next time I make it I will add more chili paste. Thank you for the recipe.

Our family doubled the recipe and it turned out to be a little salty. We didn't get the chance to grill the meat, so we decided to oven broil it. Next time we will use the grill and use a Less Sodium Soy Sauce. Over all it is a great recipe!

I did not care for this recipe as written. The ratio of soy sauce to brown sugar was way off for my taste. I used the amount of soy sauce the recipe called for and when I tasted it, it was overpowering. I ended up needing about 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1 tablespoon called for. I also added about 1/3 cup of pineapple juice.

Soooo Good! I was looking for a recipe for pork chops on the grill for the summer and this recipe was perfect. I usually make baked pork chops I from this site, which is a nice hearty recipe for the colder months, but this is delicious change-up! I also agree you must use chilli sauce from the Asian food aisle in your grocery store. I use it all the time and it adds lots of flavor and spice! I took the recommendation of a reviewer to baste the marinade on the chops as they cook. I thought they were awesome...my husband thought they were good too, but way too salty. I thought I needed to baste because I only had 4.5 hours to let them marinade so I was worried they didnt absorb enough flavor. Next time I will just marinade and not baste to see if that reduces the saltiness of the flavor. Thanks for the great recipe. Will definitely make again.

My week didn't go as planned, and these chops ended up marinating for three days. They were quite thick, over 1", and once cooked were absolutely delicious.

I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the powder and chili powder instead of the sauce (since I didn't have any).

It was OK, but certainly not spicy by any means.  It tasted fine but was very average.  I'll make again, but it isn't something I'd make to impress.

This was really tasty.  Next time I will cut back on the soy sauce as there was a lot of marinade that just went to waste at the end.  Also, I may add an extra tablespoon of chilli sauce to give it that extra kick.  Thanks for a great easy recipe!

The entire family raved over these pork chops, which is usually no tthe case with a 10, 12 and 15 year old and my husband!  I did cut the soy down to 1/2 cup and increased the chili sauce to 3 tablespoons.  It was delish!

I loved this!  Easy to prepare and delicious!  I used lime juice instead of lemon and cayenne pepper in place of chili sauce because it was what I had on hand - and it turned out amazing.  I used thin center cut pork chops w/o bone, marinated them over night, and grilled them for dinner.  I think I will make Tuesdays, marinated pork chop night from now on!  It was so easy and so good.

I made this last night with both pork chops and country style pork ribs.  It was so easy!  I was a little nervous when I put them on the grill because they smelled like they were burning but they weren't.  The chops were a little salty for my taste but the ribs were terrific!  Even my picky nine year old enjoyed them.  Thanks for sharing!

These were very good.  I rarely bbq pork chops because they tend to be so dry no matter what I do but these were surprisingly moist.  I will make these again for sure.

I don't really care for pork chops and I really liked these.  I let them marinate for 6 hours and then threw them on the grill.  They were moist and tasty, though not very spicy.

My husband flips for these chops!  He'd have me make them once a week if it was up to him.  I do at least make enough for left overs so that I can make a lunch for him to take to work.  I put my roasted red potatoes with these chops and a vegetable and he's a happy man.  The recipe stands perfect the way it is.

I wasn't terribly impressed with this recipe. I didn't really enjoy the flavor combination, and I probably wont make it again. Oh well! C'est la vie!

The only thing I did differently was to use a chili garlic sauce as that's what I had on hand. I marinaded the pork chops for about 12 hours, and cooked them on the Foreman grill. I have to admit I was pretty disappointed with the flavor - I was expecting a lot more. I'm sure marinading them for a full 24 hours would be way better. Thanks anyway!

BRAVO to you "redponygirl".  I like pork chops, but get tired of the same old way of cooking them.  Luckily I found this wonderful recipe, and have made them twice in the last 2 weeks!  I did add additional chili sauce - probably 3 times more - I LOVE it.  So easy too.  Thank you "redponygirl"!!!

These were really good!  I used chili powder instead of chili sauce and double black soy sauce (it makes the marinade a little thicker), and it was awesome.  I also added extra pepper and some red crushed pepper flakes, cause it wasn't spicy the first time we made it.  My husband loved it and we make it all the time now.  Thanks for the recipe.

Splendid chops.  I stuck closely to the recipe with the exception of two things: 1. I used less sodium, light soy sauce and 2. I added about 1 tbsp of sesame oil to the marinade.  Juicy, flavorful, and time conscious.

Loved it!  Loved it!  Loved it!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Used thicker cut of boneless chop and marinated about 10 hrs.  My husband said it't the best pork chops he has ever eaten, and I agree.

Beautiful color and flavor.  I was surprised at how tender the grilled pork chops came out.  I used chili powder, as that is what I had on hand, but will try chili sauce next time.  Hubby said I need to make it again.  This will be a frequent summer dish for us.  Thank you.

Easy to make, and it kept the pork nice and moist. 

I enjoyed the flavor, but it wasn't spicy at all - maybe I'll double the hot sauce next time.

Delicious!  The marinade really tenderizes the meat.  No grill for now, so I did mine in a cast-iron skillet with a touch of olive oil approx. 8-10 minutes per side.  I added Five Chinese Spices (going with the soy theme).  They came out golden brown.

These chops were delicious said my wife who is not a pork chop fan! I used boneless pork and grilled 7min each side which was a little too long I think. Will do 5 and 5 next time.

This is another really good marinade. I substituted chili paste, which some reviewers thought the recipe contributor intended. Either way, it was very good and added a nice twist. It wasn't real spicy, but certainly spicier than chili sauce. I marinated the pork loin chops I purchased at Costco and they were excellent.

Just so you know--Stevia in the raw contains very little stevia! Look at the ingredients list. Maltodextrin is the main ingredient. I called the home office twice and they would not tell me the percentage of stevia in the mix. I reported it to the FDA and they did nothing about it. Seems like they are paid off.

Simple recipe that doesn't really need to be changed. I did use a sodium reduced soy sauce. Nothing like grilling marinated anything on a any day.

Ok so it's 5 stars, and I didn't abandon the recipe as written. Instead of cutting the soy sauce I doubled the red hot cayenne sauce and the brown sugar. Not spicey which was fine with me! Marinated about 24 hours and they came out very moist on the grill. I used bone in and the time was longer but I used a meat thermometer. Great recipe and super easy for a weeknight.

Made the recipe exactly as stated except I doubled the chili sauce amount and used low sodium soy sauce since others complained about it being too salty. I marinated for about 7 hours and threw them on the grill for about 15 minutes or so. It turn out amazing! They had amazing flavor and a good amount of heat, we love our food spicy. My husband was impressed that they turned out so well and it is now on our make again list for the future.

The whole family enjoyed the flavor on these chops.  I was afraid it might be too spicy for my 92 year old mother-in-law but they only have a hint of spice.   The only chili sause I had was Asia garlic chili sauce and it was delicious.

This was a great marinade !!  I would add more chili sauce next time to make it spicier and I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Definitely a saved recipe for me.

I was able to marinate the pork for 3 hours and it was so delicious!  My husband said it was the best pork he's ever had!  I agreed.  I only used half the marinade for 2 chops, so I will be making this again soon!

This was a very good and VERY easy to prepare recipe. We didn't find it "spicy" but that can be very subjective based on peoples tastes.

But it was very tasty and everyone really liked it. 

I used reduced sodium soya sauce to lessen the salt intake - next time I might add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the mix.

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Really nice to marinade in the morning, then grill in the evening it makes a change from plain meaty taste.A

I made this last night for dinner, after letting my chops marinate all day, put them on the grill they were delicious.  I will certainly make these again,  but the next time I will use soy sauce with lower sodium.

Next time I make this it'll be delicious. This time it was good enough. I'll add more Siracchi sauce and low sodium soy sauce. I sorta eyeballed it.

I didn't have the chili sauce, so I used Hoisin. But it's a good marinade and I'll definitely use it again!

This will be a go- to pork chop recipe. I have been known to overcook this cut of meat with regularity! Marinating resulted in more tender and flavorful pork chops. I didn't have regular chili sauce so substituted Asian Chili Garlic Paste and cut quantity in half. They were delicious!

I used a pork tenderloin split lengthwise (not all the way through).  Used the recipe as is but used ketchup and dry mustard instead of chili sauce as I did not have any.  Put it on the bbq and cooked for about 8 minutes per side.  It was excellent, both hot and also cold the next day.
Will definitely use this recipe again.

These are THE BEST pork chops I've ever had!  Just the right amount of spicy (not too) and tangy-ness. I didn't have the Chili Sauce so I used Frank's Red Hot Wings Buffalo sauce and it was PERFECT.  I'm definitely sharing this recipe. (Even my picky teenager raved about these chops -  which never happens. Success!)

I liked the original recipe.  But, please do not use chili powder for the chili SAUCE!  No even the same thing. Otherwise, little tweaks for your preference.

Very good marinade. I did make some changes to suit us. I added 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil. Cut soy sauce to 1/4 cup. Replaced garlic powder with 1tbs of fresh minced garlic.  All the rest was the same.  Would make again.

Skipped the lemon juice, I hate fruit juice on meat. Added probably three times more chili sauce. Also added some course ground pepper, and chili powder. Very good. I would make again!

Loved it.  I'm terrible at making pork chops but this turned out really well.  Not very spicy like others have said, and it is a bit on the salty side (and I love salt).  Next time, I might do less soy sauce, add a bit of worcestershire sauce, and maybe a little bit of cayenne pepper spice.  But still great overall.

My family loved it. I did tweet it some like adding cilantro and olive oil to the marinade. I also made a glaze with the same ingredients to baste with while grilling.

Yum! This recipe sounds delicious, but I didn't have the ingredients on hand. So I took a gallon size ziplock baggy and filled it with a half bottle of Honey Smoke BBQ sauce, 3 big squirts of lemon juice, about 2 tsp. (give or take) of Mrs. Dash Carribean Citrus seasoning blend, and 1/2- 3/4 cup water. Gently shook the bag to mix the ingredients. Added my pork chops to the baggy of marinade I had just made, and marinated the chops for 5 hours in the fridge. After marinating, I seared the chops on my indoor Cuisinart grill for a few minutes on each side, then grilled on High until no longer pink..... They came out tender and moist! Fabulous! I give this recipe 5 stars because, even though I did not have the ingredients, it gave me enough direction to create my own unique masterpiece (which I would give 6 stars ;) ).

Oh yeah. This was one delicious meal. Everyone loved the recipe. My 17 year old son has since asked me to make it again.

The first time I make a recipe , I make it exactly the way the contributer posted it, to the teaspoon. I sometimes incorporate other user's suggestions on the 2nd or 3rd try. With this one, though, I do not think I will change a thing.

I made these chops first for my husband and he rved about them,and he loves the way I usually prepare his pork chops. Then I had our neibors over for dinner and he doesn't really like pork chops, but he loved them prepared that way and had seconds. His wife called me the next day for the recipe. Thank-you for the recipe. Enjoyed it immensely.

Very disappointing!  I can't believe this recipe is so highly rated.  It is honestly one of the worst recipes I've ever tried.  Sorry!  The only positive was the presentation -- the finished pork chops grilled beautifully with a nice rich color and they were pretty tender.  I followed the recipe to a tee (except I did decrease the soy sauce per the suggestion of others).  I can only think this improved the recipe.  Perhaps, others are using some other sort of chili sauce?  I used Heinz 57 and this had absolutely NO spice/kick to it.  Can't figure out what they have the word "spicy" in the title.  Definitely won't be making again.  My husband and boys haven't eaten yet (we girls just ate) as they are still at football practice.  I'm trying to think of a quick way to make these edible before they get here... BBQ sauce, A-1?

My family really loved this recipe. I made a few changes to it though.  I cut the soy sauce to 1/2c. and added 1/4c. steak sauce.  I also used 1 tsp minced garlic and the 2tsp dijon mustard.  I also added a little honey to sweeten it up just a little.  This is one recipe that we will be using in our family for quite some time

We made this as part of our OAMC rotation. Divided the chops and marinade between two freezer bags - thawed and cooked when needed. It was really wonderful. Cooked on the grill for guests. Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  It kept the chops moist plus gave them a great flavor that while spicy wasn't so spicy that my toddler couldn't eat it.  The only thing that I did different from the recipe was that I used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder.

I did not like these.  The chops were dry and its not because they were over cooked.  I think the marinade could have used a teaspoon of some type of oil, sesame perhaps? MY chops were very lean and I think that made the chops less than juicy to start with.  The lemon in this did not help.

These were wonderful! The Pork Chops I used were really thin, but they were nice and spicy.

This was a great recipe!  It was super easy to prepare.  I marinated the pork for about 12 hours.  Grilled on high for about 5-6 minutes per side.  I substituted chili powder for the paste.  The husband and kids loved this!  Will definitely be making it again.

I tried this recipe today and was very disappointed. I did like some others suggested and used part Worcestershire Sauce and I also used the Lite Soy Sauce and a little more Chili Sauce. It was still way too salty. I would rather use a bottled marinade that is inexpensive and no trouble.

I made pork chops on the grill for the first time and used this marinade. My husband thought they were delicious however I felt the marinade was lacking and you could barely taste it after cooking.
