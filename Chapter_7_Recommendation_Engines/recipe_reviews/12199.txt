This is almost exactly the same recipe that my mother-in-law gave me years ago. It is their family favorite so I had to make sure I knew how to make it. The only difference in my recipe is that I use white corn syrup instead of the dark but it is delicious! I call it the poor man pecan pie.

I actually dreamed about this pie when I went to bed last night but it was part nightmare. I baked this pie for easily double the time listed in the recipe. I know my oven is a bit off on temperature so I baked at 355 F instead of 350 F. I think the problem is in the amount of butter used in this recipe. It is double that of any other oatmeal pie recipe. It also uses one less egg than a lot of other recipes. But it was worth it! IT was like eating a caramel oatmeal pie! swoon

This is my all time favorite! I love it so much that I can eat it afterI mix it all up instead of putting it in the pie shells!
