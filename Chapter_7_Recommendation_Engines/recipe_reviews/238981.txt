The first time I made these I didn't have Choclate Chips... But I made them anywy... They were fabulous... I took them to work and they were gone in minutes... The second time I made them (because the office requested them again)I made sure that I had the chocolate to drizzle on... and they were SPECTAULAR! They went in seconds... These were easy to make and fun to do... You have to try these...

Really great recipe. Very yummy. The only thing I think the filling needed was a pinch more salt and since they were very thin, I would personally prefer to make 1.5x the filling ingredients next time.

Someone suggested doing the recipe by 1.5 because they were too thin.  I used an 8x11 pan and it was perfect. I do think 9x13 would make them very thin. I drizzled with caramel and chocolate. They were fabulous

I have made these twice in the last two weeks because everyone loved them so much and they are so easy to make. I also used an 8x11 pan so they would be thicker, I just had to add extra baking time to the crust and the filling. The crust dough seems very dry and crumbly, but it presses perfectly into the pan. Also, I use mini chocolate chips (a heaping half cup) and put them in a ziploc bag and place in a bowl of very hot tap water for some time to melt them and then just make a very small cut in the corner of the bag to drizzle. I can't believe this recipe does not have more reviews.

Sooo good! I did need to cook the crust a lot longer than 15 mins...but otherwise so delicious!

Followed the recipe according to ingredients ans cooking instructions.  The only change I made was spreading the chocolate over the top rather than drizzling.
