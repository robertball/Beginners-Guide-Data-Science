This was a hit with my husband, kids and visiting friends! I'd do it again, but add some seasoning to the cheese sauce and noodles, such as parmesan cheese, basil/oregano/italian seasoning, and some pepper.

Yummy and easy.  I didn't have non-fat dry milk so I used milk instead of the water.  It worked!

This recipe is great.  It is a tasty alternative to lasagne.  I used part of a jar of spaghetti sauce rather than the cans of tomato sauce because that's what I had on hand.  I loved it and will definitely add it to my regulars.

I made this tonight for my family and it was a hit. I did incorporate some suggestions other reviewers had.  I added Italian seasoning to the boiling pasta for more flavor. Instead of tomato sauce, I used Italian style diced tomatoes (pur√©ed). For the milk/cheese mixture, I used 1/2 cup of milk instead of dry milk powder and water. I also added extra garlic, and a splash of Italian seasoning, and Romano Cheese.  Overall, it was quite tasty.  This dish is very easy to make. I will be making this again, but will add pepper flakes or cayenne pepper for a little kick.

This was yummy if you make these changes, it will be easy and DElicious!
use red onion, finely minced
1 15 oz can italian diced tomatoes - pureed instead of tomato sauce
use 1/2 - 2/3 c. milk instead of pwd + water
Add 1 1/2 tsp garlic salt to cream mixture, and 1/4 c. grated parmesan
*and if using more meat, then make more of everything else, or its too meaty.

We really enjoyed this dish and it was put together fairly fast.  I took the advice of others and added more spices to the noodles such as Italian seasoning and more parsley & garlic and added parmesan cheese before I added the mozaarella cheese.  I also doubled the recipe.  Thanks

superb!!  i think i will store this in my recipe book under the label "faked ziti" - tastes very similar to  a ziti or lasagne.  i used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and spices, but otherwise followed the recipe as written and it is really phenomenal.  thank you much!!

This was a good/easy dinner but it was nothing to write home about.  I added more spices, more fresh garlic, and used a can of cream of mushroom soup to help flavor the noodles (as others suggested).  We enjoyed it but I don't know that I'll make it again - I think I'd rather try something a little more exciting.

I took this to a potluck dinner tonight and it went down a treat, everyone loved it, asked for seconds and also the recipe! The only change I made was use ground chicken instead of turkey as that was all I had, but it was still super yummy and a success. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I did not have dry milk or cream cheese so I used regular milk and chevre cheese.  It tasted great that way and I would make it again.

Something good to do with Turkey burger.  Just season the noodles a bit more.  They are a little bland if you dont.  Otherwise VERY GOOD!!

This was very tasty.  I have picky eaters (5 and 3) and they both liked it!  I  made it as directed except used 1/2 cup milk instead of the milk powder and water.  My only complaint is it dirties lots of dishes.  One thing I did to cut down on dishes is I used the pasta pot to make the sauce in.

This recipe was a big hit, especially with the kids.  Since we like our food flavorful, I incorporated some of the other reviewers' suggestions and also more-than-doubled to make the recipe easier.  I used an entire bag of egg noodles, 10 oz. cream cheese, 2 c. fresh milk (not dry + water), and about 1-1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce in lieu of the tomato sauce.  I also increased the parsley and Italian seasoning, and I added some seasoned salt (a white variety) to the noodle mixture.  It just fit into a 9x13 pan.  Oh, and I sprinkled shredded parmesan on top of the mozzarella.  I will definitely make again.

I did not have any cream cheese or mozzarella cheese, so I used cubed colby/jack cheese for the cheese noodle mixture and I used the colby/jack for the topping.  It turned out well.  I think the noodles need a little something and maybe the meat mixture would be good with a vegetable like zucchini or green peppers.  It was a very good start and my family loved it.  I am looking forward to trying it again.

This was tasty.  I almost doubled the Italian seasoning and increased the garlic.  I added cubes of fresh mozzarella to the noodle mixture, and topped with a grating of Parmigiano Reggiano.  I will definitely make this again.

I made a double recipe in a 10x14-inch pan, and my family liked it. It tasted like turkey lasagna. I added a teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper to the turkey mixture, and I sauteed the garlic with the turkey and onion instead of adding it to the sauce. I also used 1 cup of milk instead of the powdered milk and water.

Loved this recipe.  Made it for my husband and took some to my boss the next day, neither one could tell it was made with turkey and was lowere in fat..Its a keeper!  I went a bit heavy on the Italan seasoning, my fault not the recipes.

This recipe is true to form and very easy to make and to add your own flair to without jeopardizing the original intent.  I double the recipe, as I needed to use a whole package of ground turkey (1.25 lbs).  I used whole wheat egg noodles (the whole package), I didn't have tomoato sauce, so I pureed two 14.5 oz cans of no salt diced tomatoes and added 6 cloves of fresh garlic, 1 TBSP dried parsley, 1 TBSP italian seasoning and 1 TSP sea salt.  I also added small amounts of these same spices to the turkey as I browned it in the pan. I used 1 cup of non-fat milk with a splash of fat-free half & half (instead of dry milk powder, had some, but it was expired). I threw it all together as stated in the recipe and topped it off with mozzerrella and parmesan cheeses.  Baked it at 375 for 30 mins, it came out with a perfectly crusted cheese and had the right amount of sauce vs. cheese mixture.  I received rave reviews from my husband and I enjoyed it myself very much, we both went back for seconds.

What a delish dish! There was a bit of tang from the cream cheese which was so comforting. I use lowfat milk instead of powdered and water. I also added a little extra of everything. I used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato. Full of flavor with my added touches!

Easy, but you use every pot in the house! lol. Decided to try this recipe because I have some people who like alfredo sauce and some who like spaghetti sauce....this is sort of a marriage of both!  I also seasoned the pasta before adding the cheese sauce mixture.  Used rotini pasta because I didn't have egg noodles. Used milk instead of milk powder and water...again, didn't have milk powder.  Also increased the cheeses and tomato sauce since I used a pound of turkey and pasta.  Husband loved it and so did the teens.  A change-up from the same old spaghetti.

Outstanding! We all loved this - it reminded us of lasagna.  I used 1lb of turkey, and extra sauce too - my dh loves pasta saucy. Other than that we followed the recipe, well except we topped this with shredded sharp cheddar, our personal preference but we're definitely going to have this regularly! YUM!

A bit dry and bland, but an average dish.  We are always looking for ways to use ground turkey so we will keep this recipe on hand.

This was a huge hit! The cream cheese sauce was delicious but I would use a full 8 oz package instead because the noodles tend to dry out during baking. I love the low calorie count, and it was a great meal to freeze and save for later

Made this for the 1st time tonight and had to improvise with what I had on hand.  Used 1/2c regular 2% milk instead of powder, jack/cheddar/mozzarella mix for cheese, used olive oil & garlic spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, added mushrooms to the turkey mixture and italian seasonings/four cheese potato powder to the noodle "bath".  YUM!!  Thanks Ruby for this wonderful recipe -- my kids have never set the table & gotten ready for dinner so fast!

We loved this, and like some others have said, it is a great alternative to lasagna especially since it only takes 15-20 minutes to bake. One suggestion is to use a sturdier noodle like a ziti. My husband thought the egg noodles were too flimsy for the heavier meat and cheese mixture. Also, I didn't have any cream cheese on hand but did have a soft white, veggie cheese spread. It worked perfectly and added a lot of flavor to the noodles.

Made this last night and it was a hit with my family.  I used a couple of the suggested modifications along with a couple of my own.  I used italian ground turkey and hot italian turkey sausage along with some diced jalapeno peppers for a little added kick delicious will make again.

This recipe is good, but it needs some changes. I used regular milk instead of the powder and water, and it turned out great. I also used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and I think it really helped, as well as lots of seasoning to the red sauce. The white sauce is where the flavor is lacking. I should have followed others advice and added oregano or some kind of spice to it, maybe even a little sour cream to give it a little bit of zing? It's definably a keeper just needs some tweaking :)

Good base recipe. Added a lot of spices (more garlic, fresh basil & oregeno)in with the browning meat, and extra tomatoes. Also, I didn't melt the cream cheese separately, but mixed it in to the hot noodles with the milk (used soy), garlic & parsley and it worked fine. Fewer dishes the better here!

I was surprised how good this was! I made exactly as shown except I used regular milk rather than powdered milk and water since that is what I had. So lasagna-like my family loved it..was even better the next day. I doubled the recipe because we like leftovers for lunch the next day. A keeper and will make again and again!

The only change I made was to use milk instead of dry milk powder and water.  It needs some alterations to make this four or five stars.  Making as written was a little bland.

A very forgiving recipe! I usually have to follow recipes to a T to be edible, but this one is an exception for me. I used farmers and cheddar cheese, instead of creamcheese and mozzarella. I also used tomato paste by accident (can you tell I am a beginner :)... It was fantastic meal!!!! Thank you!

I was really surprised how good this was. Doctor up a must. Used extra sauce because we like it saucy. Used half and half and some milk instead of the powder milk. I added basil, and other spices with sauce. Also added mushrooms when I cooked onion. Used whole wheat egg noodles and turned out better than most lasagnas I've had!

Can you say delicious!  I am ready to make this dish every week.  I did add more seasonings and I also used american and mild cheddar cheese along with the mozzarella, I didn't have any parsley so I omitted that and I used 2% milk instead of dry milk powder and water.  I used lasanga noddles and layed it with the noodles, mix, cheese and then make another layer, it turned out great! Thanks for this recipe.

Making this dish I was very unsure about it, but when it was finished cooking and I took a bite I was sold!
I used what I had on hand which was half a jar of Pasta sauce, red onion, almond milk, chive and onion c.c , whole wheat egg noodles and no parsley. I also boiled the noodles in the seasoning. I did not find it took a lot of time or a lot of dishes. Quite the opposite really! Very good dish!

This is a great family meal, was tastier than I expected it to be.  I changed tomato sauce for spaghetti sauce and the powdered milk/water for skim milk.  My husband was surprised when I mention it was turkey and not beef.  Also, my family of six ate plenty and still had leftovers.  Bonus!

I used the suggestions of the other reviewers, and this was still a bit on the bland side.  I may try it one more time, but use some peppers, more cream cheese, and garlic salt rather than minced garlic.  That may help it out.

Seriously lacks vegetables but are very easy to add - mushrooms, peppers, peas, corn.  Added extra spice to meat - basil, thyme, oregano, clove of garlic. Used regular noodles and pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Used 1% milk instead of powder.  Topped with mozzarella and parmesan cheeses.  With changes, it turned out pretty well.  thanks for a solid base recipe. Cheers.

This was great!  My husband loved it!  I used rotini instead of egg noodles though because that's all I had.

For a college student turned law student (aka cheap), this is a pretty good meal. I didn't read the other reviews before I made it, but mine ended up good. I did add some uncooked can corn into the noodles and then put the sauce on top and then stired in my dish. I also used a full pound of ground turkey, and I think it's a great conmbo, 1/2 lbs may have been a bit bare on the meat. Hope you guys enjoy it like I did!

I loved this recipe - even better, my kids loved it! I will say that the white sauce did not taste good to me while it was in the pan and I was concerned that this recipe would be a dud. I added some salt, pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic powder and finally some chicken bouillon granules to the cheese sauce. It tasted a little better, but I was still a bit concerned. I also used 1/2 a jar of Ragu in place of the tomato sauce (it was all I had on hand.) The result: a very, very taste dish! The sauce on top mingles with the flavors on the bottom. I will definitely make it again!

This was my first time using wide egg noodles so I did this exactly as written so I wouldn't mess up anything.  But, I do remember having to add sugar to the meal because it was a little bland tasting. I also used regular (low-fat, lactose-free) milk instead of dry milk and water. My husband and I are lactose intolerant.  I would make this again!

My husband loved this recipe.  I think the grandkids will love it too. I modified slightly by using 2% milk because I didn't have powered milk on hand. This would be a great dish to take to pot lucks.

I made this for my in-laws who think I'm a really good cook but really I just make things that have 4 - 5 star reviews on this Web site. I thought this was a sure thing with the high rating but it was a real dud. I followed the suggestions and everything else to a tee but found this to be dry and tasteless. I was embarassed especially because it was for a Christmas gathering. There are much better meat/pasta recipes out there.

I made this about 3 weeks ago and it turned out great.  I made a few changes (some others had suggested).  I used regular 2% milk.  I also added some garlic powder to the liquid mixture since I didn't have any garlic cloves.  Instead of the tomato sauce, I used spaghetti sauce and added some canned mushrooms and chopped green pepper.  I topped it with an Italian cheese mixture blend.  I am going to make this again tonight, but this time I am going to add extra cream cheese.  I doubled the cream cheese last time and still wanted more of a cream cheese taste.  I am also going to add some fresh mushrooms. I am a single person and this recipe lasted me days.  I took some to work for a coworker and they really liked it.  I would also consider using this for potlucks in the future.

Made this tonight with whole wheat penne pasta, and a jar sauce.   I had to adjust the cheese sauce to what I had on hand and added extra seasonings but even with these changes it was yummy! Thanks for the tasty recipe Ruby!

FANTASTIC! I only gave 4 stars because I added my own twists. 1/4 cup sour cream in with the white sauce. Prepared spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. Extra seasoning because I like strong flavor. I have made this three times now and my family of picky eaters LOVES it!

This recipe deserves a fancier name! It tastes like a lasagna you would spend a lot more time and money to prepare. The egg noodles, ground turkey, and cream cheese mixture really work - great flavor - very economical. I did take the advice of some other reviewers to tweak: used milk instead of water+powder; used Italian diced tomatoes-pureed; used red onion-minced. Next time I will add more Italian seasoning and a pinch or two of garlic salt. Overall- A very satisfying and flavorful dish!

What a great recipe.  I'm no chef, and I'm amazed by the confluence of ingredients to make this so good.  As other people did, I added lots more seasonings. I also used trinity mix (onion, bell pepper and celery) in place of just onions.  I used low-fat milk in place of the dried milk and water.  Very importantly, I pushed myself away from the table after one serving, even though I could have gone back for more.

My family ate it, but did not care for the "odd" taste of the cheese mix bottom.  I like the idea of it, so I think I will try making it again using a cheese sauce of chedddar & jack rather than the cream cheese.

This recipe is fantastic!  This is the best use for ground turkey I have found so far.  My partner gave rave reviews, he said the dish was "savory" and "the epitome of home cooking!"  I loved how this recipe provided a healthy alternative to lasagne.  I used yoke-less noodles, skim milk (which worked) and skim mozzarella!  Definitely worth trying!

My family enjoyed this meal.  I served it with broccoli on the side but like another reader, I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato because of the preference.   I added garlic salt, onion powder and basil to the dish.  It was very simple to create which I love the most.  It is a keeper.

Delicioso!! I have a family of 4 so I needed to add a lot more to the recipe to make this enough for my family and have enough for leftovers. I used 85% of the bag of egg noodles. 1 8oz and 1 16oz tomato sauce. 8 oz of cream cheese, 1 cup of milk, 2 cups of cheese, 1lb of lean Turkey meat that I seasoned with a Jamaican all seasoning mix. I did also season the noodles as everyone recommended, Parmesan, oregano, basil, Italian seasoning and I baked in a 9x9 dish. It came out incredibly delicious! My boys are picky and loved this!

A great healthy comfort food dish. I used whole wheat pasta and added fresh chopped tomato and green pepper- easy to spice to your own taste and add your touches to the basic recipe- baked ziti/lasanga like dish- smells good baking and tastes wonderful

Great recipe. If you are looking for healthy options this is a keeper. I have made it numerous times and my family loves it. The cream cheese and powdered milk is a great cheat for any white sauce ! Thanks Mrs. Williams.

My two year old loves this.  I added a bag of frozen spinach to the cream cheese sauce and doubled the recipe using one can of diced tomatoes and added spaghetti sauce.  Increased the Italian seasoning and garlic and added salt.  Love it!

to up the flavor, i cooked my noodles in salted water with some italian seasoning thrown in. i added about 1/4 c. of parmesan cheese to my cream cheese mixture, and used only 2 oz. of cream cheese to cut back on fattiness. the flavor is delicious. i sweated my onions and garlic together as my turkey was already cooked. i used milk instead of powdered milk and water, and added a bunch of italian seasoning and pepper to the cheese mixture. i used canned tomato sauce also. sprinkled the top with parm cheese and mozzerella.

This was so good!! I could've eaten the cream sauce plain probably. I did use milk instead of the water and powdered milk and added a little cream and sour cream to that mixture. I also used an 8oz container of tomato sauce and the rest I used italian seasoned spaghetti sauce w/peppers and onions

I made this because it was a conglomerate of leftover items I already had in my kitchen & was pleasantly surprised when it turned out really good. Only changes I made were to add garlic & fennel seed.

This was really good, very easy comfort food.  I made it with rotini since that's what I had on hand.  It was good but I think the egg noodles would be easier.  I have a toddler and am always looking for things the whole family can eat.  This did the trick!  Thanks!

My partner came back for seconds, and she NEVER does that!  I used the regular milk and spaghetti sauce substitutions in lieu of the dry milk and tomato sauce/Italian seasoning, respectively.  I also took the suggestion of adding 1/4 c. shredded parmesan to the cheese sauce and used an extra large garlic clove in it as well.  Very tasty way to use my ground turkey!

I didn't really care for this dish and was glad I did not happen to make it for company.  It was bland despite adding additional spices and throwing in some fresh mushrooms.  I was glad I did not double the recipe.

Like others recommended I used milk because I don't have dry milk on hand. I have made this MANY times and my entire family LOVES this recipe. They call it "lasagna casserole" as if lasagna wasn't already a casserole. :) It takes a few pans to make it, but it is worth every pan. MAKE THIS!

This is a great easy recipe. However, I made a couple of changes to accommodate what I had in my pantry. Instead of a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, I used an 8 oz can and half a cup of tomato soup. I also used the entire 1lb of ground beef. In addition, I added 1/2 tsp of salt to the meat. My family enjoyed it : ) Will def make again. I might sub the italian season next time and just add some basil, salt and paprika.

So yummy and easy. I too changed just a couple things. We have a big family so I used 4 cups of noodles, 6 oz of cream cheese, 4oz of sour cream plus a few additonal spices. Other than that I made it exactly as directed and we all loved it!

A very quick, easy and delicious dinner which will appeal to even finicky eaters.  Like some many others, I added ingredients I like: jar of Victoria tomato sauce, kidney beans and a container of frozen, chopped broccoli to the meat mixture.  And, I doubled the cream cheese, milk and added parm. cheese and shallots to the sauce.  VERY TASTY!

It was a hit with my family! I made several changes just b/c I had to improvise with what I had. I didn't have dry milk so used 1/2 milk instead of water, used spaghetti instead of egg noodles, used can of diced tomoatoes instead of spag sauce and added kidney beans to it! I used more cheese b/c we are a cheese kind of family....I also added oregeno to the turkey instead of parsley....Also added garlic salt...This recipe was VERY YUMMY!!!!! and, super easy!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was a hit with the kids and my husband, and I would feel comfortable serving it to company.  The only change I made was using ground beef flavored with Italian seasoning instead of turkey.  The 'Ground Turkey (Beef) Noodle Bake' is definately going in my recipe box.  Thank you Ruby!

I made this for dinner last night and it was really good, I didn't have any ground turkey, but I did have some frozen left overs from thanksgiving, so I just shredded it,worked great. I added mushrooms and sliced olives in the sauce and used some sour cream for the noodles and we both really enjoyed it.  This is a great basic recipe that so many things can be added to your own liking. I ended up making much more then the two of us can eat so I just froze about half of it.

This is a good base recipe.  I did have to make some changes here and there.  I used whole wheat egg noodles, added more seasoning to the noodles as they cooked, extra seasoning in the turkey sauce and the cheese sauce.  I put some parmesan cheese in the cheese sauce and on top with the mozzerala.  It turned out good, but something was missing.  I think the next time I make it I will add Ricotta cheese to the cheese sauce.  I will make again with some changes.  Thanks for the base recipe!

I doubled this recipe by using 6 cups of egg noodles, 1.25 lbs of ground turkey, 1 very large onion, a 29 ounce can of tomato sauce, 1 cup of 2% milk, 8 ounces of cream cheese, 2 tsp of minced garlic, and 2 cups of mozeralla cheese. My husband and my son absolutely loved it. I think I might mix in some ricotta cheese next time I make this; the cream cheese mixture on the egg noodles didn't seem to give it as much thickness/richness as I was expecting. Overall, a very tasty, fulfilling dish.

I thought this was okay.  The cream sauce on the bottom was different.  I think it needs some help though.  More seasonings maybe...I bought pre-seasoned ground italian turkey and I thought that was a nice touch.  I'll try this again.

I was sooo surprised how good this came out. I doubled the recipe, used whole wheat noodles, fresh broccoli in the noodle mixture, and shredded some carrots for the sauce to add veggies. My husband and 19 months old son even loved it. Def. make this again.

I made this recipe using no-yolks noodles, 99% lean turkey and no-salt added tomato sauce. I expected it to be quite bland but the cream cheese, parsley and mozarella made it so tasty. This was quite filling and even better the next day. I would definitely make this again! Thanks for a yummy recipe.

This was a big hit.  Some called it baked pizza and some called it Baked taco's, I call it a keeper.  A little involved but totally worth it.

I really liked this and so did my boyfriend. A great creamy pasta dish for those watching their weight. Easy to prepare and very tasty leftovers too. I will make this again and again.

Kids loved this! I used Fettucini noodles instead of egg noodles and spaghetti sauce (since that's what I had on hand). Turned out fine!  Noodles were a little tasteless, like other reviewers stated.  Next time will add more spices to noodle mixture, but otherwise a great dish.  Easy to put together.. will make again.

Great casserole! Used 2% milk and a can of plain diced tomatoes as that's what I had. As suggested I added extra garlic, black pepper, and parmesan to the cheese sauce. Still needs a bit more flavor so will add some sauted veggies to the meat mixture next time.

This is a great caserole that I thought tasted even better the next day.  I added parmesan cheese to the cheese sauce and an extra tsp of Italian seasoning to the tomato sauce.  The flavors blend together very nicely and it's kid friendly too!

No offense, but I wasn't impressed by this and neither were my kids. Maybe it was just our taste buds.

Yummy.  I will make again.  I will make a little more of the cream cheese sauce to make it a little more moist.  Be careful not to over cook the pasta, I wasn't watching closely and it was a little mushy.

I may have made a mistake in the recipe, but I was not thrilled with this dish.  It seemed like a bit more work for something that tasted no better than regular spaghetti using ground turkey.  It was a bit watery in the bottom of the dish as well, for some reason.
