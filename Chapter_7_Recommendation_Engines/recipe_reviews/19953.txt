Depending on the region, or even the particular cook, this richly flavored dish can be prepared in any number of ways, but what is common is that it is meat, usually beef but sometimes veal, about 1/4" thick, that is rolled with some sort of stuffing, then braised in a "sugo," or sauce. In Sicily this is called braciole and typically stuffed with raisins and pine nuts. In Italy this is called involtini, and is sometimes stuffed with a mixture of bread crumbs, Romano cheese and eggs - or with carrots, onions, celery, garlic and parsley. A variation I often make is with garlic, prosciutto, fresh basil leaves and Romano. (Which is also how I recently enjoyed this dish in Rome) No matter how it's stuffed these beef rolls are braised for about 1-1/2 hours in tomato sauce, and usually with beef stock, red wine and garlic added. This version, while maybe not traditional, is a perfectly acceptable short-cut variation.

My high school sweetheart's mother made braciole for me for my birthday.  Hers was rolled with a bread stuffing with mushrooms and cheeses and prosciutto.  Amazingly tasty, and the sauce in which it was cooked was divine.  Why didn't I marry that girl?!?!

Ok.  Needs more Italian spices.  I've seen the recipe with Italian bread crumbs in it and raisins also.  If your going to take the time to make this don't use jar sauce, make your own.  Oh, the spelling is wrong, should be Braciole.

My husband is from Italy, and I made this to his liking using proscuitto, pecorino romano, and fresh basil leaves as the filling.  I used my own homemade sauce and followed the recipe directions in the preparation.  It was WONDERFUL!  Served it with fresh homemade ciabatta bread for soaking up the sauce.  Will make this again.  Thanks!

I tried this recipie in hopes to find something different for my family and it was wonderful.  I did not change a thing and it was a hit at our dinner table. I also accompanied the dish with the pasta carbonara also from this website and it went really well together.

I thought the meat turned out too dry. My husband, who likes well-done beef thought it was very good (he rates it at 4 stars). If I made this again I think I would fully cook the bacon first and cook the meat roll less. It did have a good flavor (I used Italian seasoning instead of parsley).

I really liked this, but I've never had it before, so couldn't compare it to anything like the other reviewers did.
Though I did agree with one thing, it is only as good as the sauce and also quality of meat that you use.

Used prosciutto instead of bacon....delish and putnesca sauce (capers, kalamatta olives, portobello mushrooms and artichokes).
