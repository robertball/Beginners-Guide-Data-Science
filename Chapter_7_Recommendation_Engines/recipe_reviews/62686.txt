Yum, substitute the dressing for 0 carb rasberry vinegarette for Atkins folks. I served it to both low carb dieters and normal eaters by serving the dressings on the side.

This was the perfect salad for a dinner I went to. One of the women there ate at least 5 bowls! I served the dressing on the side so everyone could just put however much they wanted on. I also used "Spring Mix" pre-packed lettuce instead of Romaine.

What a pretty and delicious salad. Instead of almonds I used coarsely chopped pecans, but I still roasted them per the directions. I used the pre-cut romaine salad in a bag - could have used two bags since I had more of the other ingredients than I needed for 1 bag of lettuce. I wouldn't dump all the dressing on at once since it makes a generous amount even for 2 bags of salad. I tossed some in then put the rest in a cruet for people to add. Don't hesitate to serve this at your dinner parties - my neighbor asked for the recipe! Thanks for posting it!

This is a great salad you'll want to make again and again.Some people may be confused by the combination but after one bite they'll change their mind.I use the raspberry vinagrette in The Harvest Salad recipe.Yum!

My mother and I both loved this salad.  The sharpness of the feta balanced the sweet strawberries perfectly! The only problem I had was that the dressing was too heavy; I think reducing the oil a bit might help.

My husband and I don't agree on many food items, but we both really enjoyed this salad.  We did use cider vinegar instead... I just can't buy another vinegar bottle!  Very, very good.  And a nice short cut, buy the almonds already roasted and packaged in the salad area.  Will definitly put in our favorites!

I served this for bunco last night and it was a hit.  I doubled the salad part of the recipe (my ladies live for salad!)  Prepared the dressing for one recipe as suggested by others, and it was super.  Strawberries are in season right now, so I will be making this one again.

Great recipe. Kids liked it as well, excluding the feta cheese for them. Very quick and easy. Cannot wait to make this again.

I didn't really like the combo of strawberries and feta, however I liked the dressing. I used half of the oil it called for and I substituted olive oil. Won't do the salad again but will make the dressing.

This is very good!  The raspberry and balsamic dressing is a great compliment to the strawberries and tangy feta.  The almonds provide a delightful crunch.  I did add a tiny pinch of salt to the dressing, just to brighten the flavors.  Also, I think it’s easier to toast the almonds in the oven – 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly golden.  I think that’s easier.

I really enjoyed this salad. It has an interesting combination of flavors. I now make this dressing and keep on hand. It's good on any kind of green salad.

Ok, that was AWESOME!!!  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and 1/2d the oil (good suggestion).  I used pomegranate vinegar because my raspberry vinegar was flat and, well, pomegranate is the new raspberry! :-)  Thanks for a tasty, healthy idea!  Tomorrow I am going to have the salad for lunch with some grilled chicken on top.  Can't wait!

The only change I made was using mixed greens instead of romaine.  I doubled the recipe and took it to a July 4th BBQ.  WOW it was a big hit.  No leftovers and a lot of recipe requests.   Thanks MSCHEF  Oh, I almost forgot the only raspberry vinegar I could find was raspberry balsamic.  So I used that for the raspberry vinegar and also the regular balsamic vinegar.   The salad was fantastic.

Took this to a book group gathering and got raves from a bunch of real foodies! An absolutely delightful summer salad. Agree with some other comments that that amount of oil could be decreased (which I did - I added 2/3 cup instead of 1 C). The raspberry vinegar part of the recipe really makes all the flavors pop! Will definitely make this again and again.

This is a great salad except it seems to be way too much vegetable oil in the dressing, I ended up dumping some of it out.  I'd cut the oil in half next time.

Yum yum yum! I never would have thought to put strawberries and feta together on my salad but they are a perfect match. The almonds add a nice flavor and crunch too. No one is ever disappointed when I make this salad!

I actually got this recipe from a local grocery store, they called for Almond Accents instead of cooking the almonds. This dish is great, served it at a cookout with family, and handed out the recipe to several people!

I tried it as is and it was excellent (always do this). Tried it again using spinach instead of romaine and added crumbled bacon for a smokey sensation. Even better. Will try it again as a main course salad topped with grilled smoked duck breast. Very much looking forward to that. Thank you for a delicious and versatile recipe! If I could find collard and mustard greens I would experiment further.

The strawberry & feta salad is most definitely a 5 ******.  The vinagerette was not too acidic, it was tangy and smooth tasting.  One thing to be careful with this recipe is when you're toasting the almonds...they brown quickly.  Most definitely a hit with my family and friends....  A must make!!!!!

So easy to make and everybody loved it! I make this regularly. Sometimes I use a sweet dressing from the grocery store rather than making up the dressing called for in the recipe, but the one in the recipe is absolutely the BEST dressing for this salad!

This salad was very, very good.  I had a few friends over for dinner and this salad stole the show.  I halved the recipe.  I will make this salad again and when i do I will halve the dressing.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I plan on making this 2 more times this week!

I made this salad for a dinner party...it was everyone's favorite dish! It may seem like a lot of strawberries, but it is just right...so delicious!  I also offered a choice of feta or blue cheese.  Try this one, you won't be disappointed!

Wow!!! This salad is awesome.  Everyone who eats it wants the recipe!!
Great salad to bring to a pot-luck. Do all the prep work at home and bring all items in separate dishes, toss when ready to eat.  This is a salad to make!!

I made this salad when having my parents over for dinner.  They loved it and so did I.  My husband wasn't crazy about it, but he doesn't usually go for mixing fruit and greens.  I'll definitely make it again when we have company.

I was skeptical about making this salad because i'm not a big "fruit" lover. OMG!!!! This salad was sooooo good!!!! I cut the oil in half and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil in the dressing. I also used red wine vinegar instead of raspberry vinegar (because i didn't have any on hand). I will definately make this again!!!!!

I made this salad with a spring mix from Sam's and feta and fresh strawberries. the dressing was fantastic.  I substituted raspberry vinaigrette for the 2 vinegars and used garlic powder instead of real cloves. I am going to try it next time with olive oil, instead of vegetable oil, to make it healthier. Very good dressing as I made it with the above substitutions.

This was very good! I had some raspberry jam I needed to use up, so I used that in place of the raspberry vinegar.  I also used a big clove of garlic which was very overpowering and made the dressing somewhat spicy.  Next time, I will use a smaller clove or garlic powder/salt.  I will also serve the strawberries on the side as they got soggy.

I accidentally combined 2 salads that I had been wanting to make, thinking they were one. So basically I didn't really make this salad but it would still be good if I had. I used fresh baby spinach, toasted almonds, mandarin oranges, sliced strawberries, feta, and then used Brianna's blush vinaigrette instead of making a dressing. It was good.. next time I'll try to make it as written.

Delicious. I didn't have any raspberry vinegar (too expensive) so used red wine vinegar as another reviewer suggested. It is a very refreshing salad.

This is a great salad! The dressing has become our new staple in our house! Instead of raspberry vinegar we use fresh raspberries and mash them a little and then use 1/4 cup white wine vinegar! We also cut down the veg oil like others said. So yummy!!!

This recipe sounded interesting, so we tried it. However, while it looked good, I was less-than-thrilled with how the strawberry and feta flavors went together. It just didn't taste right. It's pleasing to the eye, but not the tastebuds! I wouldn't make again.

This is sooooo delicious.  I don't like sweet dressings but I was willing to give it a try.  I couldn't find raspberry vinegar so I bought Girard's light raspberry dressing and mixed in dijon mustard.  Delicious.  Crunchy, salty, sweet, and pretty healthy.  thanks

This was okay.  I used only 1/4 of the oil called for, but the dressing still felt really heavy and greasy.  We have used the same salad ingredients with a raspberry or strawberry vinegarette and gotten better results with less effort.

This salad was delicious! And that's saying something, coming from me. I don't like salad or salad dressing, but I loved this! My whole family loved it as well. We all agreed that the dressing was much better than the store-bought stuff.

I made this salad to go with our Valentine's Dinner on Saturday and I have to say-this is wonderful!!!!  My husband who is a meat and potatoes kind of guy was blown away!  He loved it and actually said "I don't want to be done with this-do we have more?"-pretty high praise-especially considering the fact that there was a filet mignon on his main dish plate!!!  Anyone who is on the fence with this one-make it!  I am a ranch dressing girl-and I love this!!!! Fantastic!

Fabulous, like others have mentioned, this is becoming one of our family favourites.  I'd give it five out of five if the receipe reflected what most others say with relation to reducing the level of oil.  I substituted 1/2 cup of olive oil for the 1 cup of vegetable oil.

This was awesome for a hot summer day! We used baby spinach instead of romaine, added a yellow bell pepper andused 1/2 c olive oil instead of a full cup. It was so good! We'll try pine nuts instead of almonds next time, but this will be a staple salad for guests! Mmmmmm. Thanks!!

This is so, so, so delicious. I made it almost as written except I used red wine vinegar instead of raspberry since that's what I had and I cut the oil in half as suggested by other reviewers. Absolutely fantastic.  I served it with grilled tuna steaks and grilled asparagus with a balsamic reduction = it was the perfect meal! Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

This is a wonderful salad! My husband (who is NOT a big salad fan at all), gobbled it up & said it was great, which is a big compliment! We both loved the dressing for it. The only change I made with it was to use a very light tasting olive oil instead of the vegetable oil & it was super. Will definately be keeping this recipe.

I halved the recipe and I felt there was too much dressing and too many almonds for the salads (put less on next time).  However, I made it for a dinner party and it went over well.  I'd make again with less almonds and dressing :)

I added some finely cubed apples, which added more texture to the salad. Also used dark cherry balsamic vinegar instead of raspberry vinegar, because that's what I had on hand.

Delicious! All of the flavors came together beautifully, and the guests at the dinner party I brought the salad to LOVED it! I did make a few alterations to the recipe. Following other reviewer's advice, I only used 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil. I also excluded the dijon mustard, and I used pomegranite vinegar instead of raspberry vinegar since it is what I had on hand. I also used 1 cup coarsely chopped pecans instead of almonds (because I love pecans!). Quite tasty, and I will definitely be making again!!

Pretty good salad.  The dressing was a little oily but I would probably make it again with less oil.

I just made this for an office potluck and it was amazing!  I made the suggested changes from other reviewers (1/2 cup olive oil, red wine vinegar, and spinach) and I received great reviews for this recipe.  This will make a fantastic spring/summer salad and I will definitely make it again this season.

THis was a great salad. I used cider vinegar because I did not have any raspberry vinegar and it was yummy. I made a large salad and still had leftover dressing to use another day.

So delicious!  I love the way the sharp feta and the strawberries go together.  This was a huge hit at a family party.  The dressing is amazing, after I've run out of strawberries I'll just mix a little dressing in with a spinach mix and it's a delicious lunch.  My edits: I only use 1/4 cup oil and 1 T brown sugar, and it works just fine.  I also double the garlic.  Whisk the dressing right before serving, because it LOVES to separate.

I just made it for Lunch. I used less than half of oil, three times the garlic, and a bit more balsamic vinegar than I needed, due to taste. I also burned the nuts- not on purpose- but it tasted great. The sweet and strong balanced each other perfectly and I had cream soda and cheese wheat thins with it. Bon Appetite.

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it- what a delicious recipe!  I used goat cheese rather than feta, because I had it on hand, and it was still good.  It's a nice, pretty salad to put out for a holiday, too.

everybody who has tasted it has asked for the recipe!  the dressing is outstanding and versatile; i've used it in warm spinach salads with great results.  sometimes i make a tropical version of this salad with cubed mango and avocado, no strawberries, and walnuts instead of almonds. i think it's equally good as the original.

This salad was an excellent meal fit for summertime. At first taste, the homemade vinaigrette had a funny taste, but it grew on me after just a little while. All of the flavors mixed together very well and ultimately, a very refreshing entree. I would say, however, that presentation-wise, it might be better to serve the salad with the dressing on the side, as the dressing has a darker tint to it and it hides the brightness of the salad when it does not have any dressing on it.

I made this salad twice, both times it was great but the second time was AMAZING! Both time I did the same thing with the dressing- used half red wine vinegar and half raspberry dressing instead of raspberry vinegar, and apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic,and used olive oil, kept everything else the same. Delicious dressing. For the salad, the first time I just used strawberries and feta and added some red onion which I think is a must. It was great. The second time, I added a can of mandarin oranges, and used mostly spinach because I ran out of romaine and it was amazing!!! I even served the feta on the side in case people didn't want it and it was great without it.

I LOVE this recipe.  I don't have any raspberry vinegar right now, so I used red wine vinegar instead and it was incredible.  The last time I made it I ran out of strawberries and so instead I used dried cranberries and green apples....ummm, yummy!

I halved the amount of oil and added a pinch of salt as other reviewers said. Oven roasted the almonds at 350 for 10 minutes to make it easier. Used a ton of spinach because that's what I had. Huge hit.

This is a delicious salad. The raspberry flavor was a little overpowering so I will use less next time. Other than that, this was a huge hit with the family and I will make it again and again- thank you!!

Delicious and so easy!  Both my boyfriend and I loved the combination of flavors. For the dressing, I'll cut the oil by half next time. I can't wait to make this salad again!

Loved this!  I couldn't find Raspberry vinegar, so I used a store bought Raspberry vinegrette and omitted the dressing ingredients ~ it was a hit!  I made for 10 servings, had 6 at the table and there was no salad remaining! A keeper!

Just finished e-mailing this recipe to friends that attended a party last night, in which I brought this salad.  They all loved it, and had to have the recipe!  Reviewers are not kidding when they call this salad a crowd pleaser!  It was well balanced and refreshing.  Thanks for this excellent recipe!

I used half the oil which was called for and had plenty of dressing for the salad.  With this slight modification this is a 5 star recipe!  I took it to a BBQ and everyone loved it!

Most excellent.  Thank you!  I only used half the oil called for in the recipe.  I'm glad I did that.  If you didn't wan't to putz with home made dressing, a rasp. vinegrette or poppy seed would do just great.  This was a big hit, thanks again!

I became a member just to rate this salad! I made it for the first time at a party where I knew only one other person. Boy was it a conversation starter! I actually had a man ask me if I had made the salad and when I said I had, he told me it was magnificent! Magnificent! What a great word! About 5 people have asked me for the recipe since then. It is so yummy and quite the crowd pleaser. I live in Australia so made some adjustments based on what I could find here. I read the other reviews about being too much oil so I used just slightly over 1/2 cup and it was yummy. Couldn't find straight raspberry vinegar, but I found a raspberry balsamic which I used instead, and because it already had balsamic in it, I used apple cider vinegar instead of the 2 tablespoons of balsamic. This is my new favorite recipe and once you have the ingredients, it is so simple to make. Thank you for posting this!

I made this last week for a picnic with family and friends - everybody LOVED it! My husband liked it so much, he has asked that I make it again for a pot luck this week. The only change I made was cutting down on the oil as another reviewer suggested. Thanks for sharing MSCHEF!!!!

Made the dressing with 3/4 cup of olive oil, mixed in blender to emulsify.
Salad tasted wonderful and was a big hit with everyone.

I served this at a work potluck for 40 people I adjusted the qty but it was a huge hit I should have made more . After reading the reviews I used less oil, it would have been too oily had I not. Also use mandarin oranges, I also toasted the almonds and tossed with sugar at the end of toasting to give them a sweetness.

Yum!  I substituted raspberry vinaigrette for the raspberry vinegar and used only 1/2 cup of oil in the dressing.  With a full cup of oil, there would be WAY too much dressing.  I wasn't sure if I would like the almonds, because I'm one of those people who usually leaves nuts out of my recipes, but they definitely worked in this one.  My mother-in-law thought this salad was so pretty that she took a picture of it!

Love this dressing! I've been making big batches to use on all my salads. Sometimes I'll use a different vinegar or other spices (onion, garlic, thyme, oregano, etc) so switch it up a little.

This went over so well.  My father in law, who isn't usually a huge salad fan, had multiple helpings!
I could not find rasberry vin, so I used rasberry balsamic and added a container of crushed rasberries to the dressing.

Oh my goodness is this recipes ever soooo good! I made this for my best friends baby shower and it was a huge hit. I used spring mix lettuce and I couldn't find raspberry vinegar so I used 1/2 rasberry vinegertte dressing and i/2 red wine vinegar in place of it. Not only is this recipe delicious but it is the perfect girly dish for baby showers, bridal showers, ect. Yummy!!!!

Refreshing and light, and a creative combination of ingredients! I mixed the dressing ingredients in a canning jar and shook it up, and didn't dress the salad until just before setting it out for a potluck - I used only about 3/4 of the dressing. As an FYI, I use President brand feta cheese, which I think tastes way better than other brands.

My whole family loved it.  I cut the oil down to 3 Tbsp and used apple cider vinegar since that's the closest I can come up with.  I even consider to cut the oil more the next time.

A beautiful salad & tasty too.  I prepped the salad the day before (cut salad greens & wrapped in paper towel, then placed in a ziploc - sliced strawberries & placed in separate ziploc - made dressing) so party time, it was easy assembly.  Replaced almonds with Trader Joe's Candied Walnuts.  Yummy!!

Delicious!  Simple.  To save time if necessary, use bottled raspberry vinegarette.

Delicious! I couldn't find raspberry vinegar, but added red wine vinegar as a substitute and halved the oil as another review suggested. It turned out excellent!

Awesome.  used 1/2 the oil.  Used Agave Nectar instead of honey because that is what I had.  Marinated shrimp in some of the dressing and then grilled and served with salad.  Will also try with spinach.  Thanks!

BEST salad ever.  We use toasted pine nuts and spring mix salad from Walmart.  Otherwise we follow the recipe.  I love it and so does everyone we've served it to!

This was absolutely delicious.  I used extra virgin olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and I used whole roasted almonds instead of using the slivers b/c the whole almonds are so much less expensive.  I started to sliver the almonds myself, but quickly got tired of that and just added them whole and they were wonderful.  We really loved this salad.  Thank you for the recipe!

This salad is wonderful, especially the dressing.  I have made it several times since the first time I made it. I have subbed in other fruit for the strawberries, but it's still the best with the strawberries.  I would highly recommend it!

Love this...I use the raspberry walnut vinaigrette dressing to skip a step and sometimes when out of almonds I use walnuts/pecans. I love to mix this with lots of fresh spinach too.

This is a nice recipe. Do be sure and put the dressing in a container you can continue to mix well, as it separates pretty fast and needs to be shaken up. I put mine in a cruet that was a bit too small so I got mostly oil on the first serving! Subsequent servings were delicious, thanks for the recipe :)

I have made this salad numerous times and my family/friends love it.  Usually I used mixed greens or arugula.  Either way it is great.  I have made it with feta cheese only once, and have to say I prefer crumbled goat cheese.  I often make this as a meal and top the salad with jerk chicken.  It tastes great with the sweetness of the dressing and the strawberries.

Very good salad, I did think that it made way too much dressing for the salad.  In fact, next time, I would only use 1/4 of the dressing.  Thanks for the recipe!

I believe I liked this more than any other salad recipe that I have tried on this site.  I didn't have any raspberry vinegar so I used salad vinegar and 3TBS cherry jam. We don't like almonds so we subed toasted chopped pecans. I can't wait to take this to a party!!!

awesome awesome salad! Everyone now requests that I make this to whatever function I attend. I had trouble finding raspberry vinegar so instead, I added a little bit of raspberry jelly and whisked it in, gives it a little more raspberry flavor, which is incredible. Also, I added sundried blueberries in there as well, so good!

This is a great, easy salad to make.  The only thing I would suggest is to either put the dressing on the side, so people can put as much on as they want, or halve it.  Other than that, we love it!

I made this last night for our main course for dinner - excellent!    I am a very picky eater and this sald was perfect.  It had the sweet and tanginess of the dressing; the crunch of the almonds; the flavor of the feta. thanks !

Good: Overall, great fresh-tasting salad, and - most important - its ingredients are simple (I had most of them already).  Not good: I thought the dressing was too oily/not tangy enough (and too much dressing for the salad) - next time I will halve or 2/3 the oil.  My husband had some other suggestions (sesame seeds), but I don't agree with him because what I like best about the salad is its simplicity.  If I wanted to buy a bunch of ingredients like sesame and poppy seeds, I would have tried another salad!  I really thought it was great without the seeds.  Tip:  The recipe is enough for two salads for 2-4 people, so I divided it (before dressing) and we will have the second half tomorrow night.

Great salad. Beautiful presentation too. I used a blend of baby spinach and romaine leaves. No one else here would try this although I guess it really isn't "man food". I enjoyed it quite a bit, Thanks for the fantastic salad!

First tried this one as is and it was excellent!!! The dressing really is the star here.... I sometimes switch things around depending on what I have on hand but it is always delish!!! Some of the other variations I have tried are mandarin oranges with pecans or walnuts and Parmesan cheese instead of feta but whatever I use it is always very good.  Thanks for this wonderful dressing. I am keeping this on the books as it is very addicting!!

I wish I could give this salad more than 5 stars!! It was excellent!  Followed the recipe and did not change a thing.  I have to say it made a ton of dressing, instead of putting the dressing on the salad I put it in a cruet for everyone to add there own, the dressing almost did not fit in the cruet! and we had a lot left over.  That did not matter because the dressing is so good, we could have it on salads for the rest of the week.  Excellent!

I was a little skeptical about this salad, especially the dressing.  BUT, this salad was first rate and the dressing was wonderful!  My dh raved about it (which is rare!!).  I used the packaged Spring Mix salad instead of the Romaine.  I also did not have raspberry vinegar, so I used half red wine vinegar and half raspberry vingrette.  We'll definitely make this again!

Mmmm...this was so yummy! We did not have raspberry vinegar (or any other fruit vinegar) so I used coconut vinegar as a substitute. (This is made from fermented coconut sap and is not just coconut-flavored vinegar). I also added sweet purple grapes and some oranges. The sweet and tangy interplay was good- both in the dressing and the fruits. The only problem I had was the feta crumbling into a mushy paste but I think that has more to do with the kind of feta I use (Auroville, organic & hand made) than anything else. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is the best!  I used a combination of spring greens and romaine.  I didn't use all the dressing - this was enough for two salads.  What a delicious salad.

This salad is AMAZING!!  I loved it.  We made it for dinner the other night and both my boyfriend and I had 2 servings each.  I served it with fresh warm italian bread!  I will definitely make it again.

Simply wonderful.  Seemed like an unusual mixture of ingedients but the taste was absolute superb.  The sweetness of strawberries and the saltiness of the feta covered with the honey dressing made this recipe one of our favorite salads to serve.

I just made this for the first time, and really liked it. (As did the hubby and teen!)  For another twist of flavors, I added cracked black pepper--even yummier!

Absolutely fantastic! Loved the surprising combo of flavors. Decided it was too much dressing for just this salad so put in a carafe and let everyone drizzle over to suit their tastes but the dressing is good on its own and will use on my salads throughout the week.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I have become addicted to it but now must give it a rest so I don't wear it out.  :)  

I made this for Valentine's Dinner as the recipe called for.  Then I decided I could make it last longer if I didn't toss it all together.  I make the dressing and toast the almonds and store them in a their own containers so that each night I can toss together my own salad and it doesn't go limp.  

I did however cut the oil back to 3/4 cup.

Very good. I used 1/2 cup olive oil in place of vegetable oil.  I used pomegranate vinegar instead of raspberry vinegar.  This is one of the best salads I have made

Delicious! I added a bit of fresh mint, which complemented the flavors. Also, since I didn't have raspberry vinegar, I substituted a tablespoon of raspberry preserves and plain white vinegar.

Delicious and I only used balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  Trying to stay away from the sugar.  This is definitely on my list to have on a regular basis.

Really good! I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic in the dressing, and about a third of the oil called for. Also used olive oil instead of vegetable. A good, refreshing combination, sweet but not too sweet. Thanks!

Enjoyed the salad.  Followed recipe to the T.  I think there was way too much oil.  I would cut it back to half next time.  I think a few cranberries might make this a home run for us.

This is a very good and simple salad recipe. I especially liked the dressing but did as other reviews and only added half of the oil. Still turned out great.

Wow!  This is delicious!  However, I must admit that I changed it up a bit due to not having all ingredients.  I substituted candied pecans for the almonds and I substituted goat cheese for the feta.  I also did half vegetable oil and half olive oil.  It was an amazing salad!  I think that it's one of those recipes which easily lends itself to changes and tweaks.  It does need nuts and berries though.

This is my first review.  This recipe was a HUGE hit with my family. I altered the recipe slightly by chopping the almonds and toasting them in the oven.  Also used olive oil in significantly amount and all raspberry basalmic vinegar. I really didn't rmeasure my ingredients, just eye-balled it and the result was terrific. Oh, and we used a mixture of different lettuces.

A good salad when serving guests who are picky eaters & prefer to avoid anything green.   If you are accustomed to lots of veggies & vinegar in your salad, you may find this a bit sweet.   Overall, a good recipe with the appropriate pairings.

Super yummy! I wasn't sure how the strawberries would go with the feta, but it was awesome.

We love this recipe and can't wait to share it with family and friends.  We have used maple syrup when honey wasn't available.  Also, we have added grilled and sauted chicken.  As for leftovers, we had the soggy mixture on hard rolls with a slice of American cheese!  YUM!

Made this for dinner tonight. I added some cukes and used walnuts instead of almonds. Both my husband and I agree this salad was excellent. I have been sick of salads and this was a nice change.

Great recipe!  Brought it to a family dinner and this salad was a hit.  Used 1/2 cup olive oil and it was still fantastic.   Had enough dressing left over for another small salad.

Very yummy-great flavors.  Too much dressing, though.  Next time I will cut the dressing in half.

Wow! Absolutely wonderful. I used a spring mix salad instead of romaine, and it looks gorgeous! I made it just for my husband and I for dinner, but I will definetely be using this recipe the next time we have company. LOVE IT!! My husband, who is NOT a salad fan, said this was the best salad he'd ever had, and has requested that I make this all the time! I made a chocolate cake for desert, and he didn't want cake, he wanted more salad!

This was a very nice salad.  I didn't have raspberry vinegar, so I added half the amount in white vinegar and a teaspoon of raspberry jam.

Very beautiful, simple and yummy summer salad.  The dressing, however, didn't have much taste.  When I again prepared the salad another day, using the leftover dressing, the flavor was more intense.

What an unbelievable combination of flavors in this salad! Just perfect!! The dressing pops with the berries and toasted almonds. I could eat this salad every day! I did use spinach and flavored feta.

Really wonderful. I made it exactly as stated with the minor exception that I added a small pinch of salt to the dressing, since salt helps bring out flavors, including sweet ones like are in this salad. So delicious. You can leave out the feta and make it more of a side salad. It's still an absolute winner. Will make often.

I make this recipe for parties and everyone loves it.  Mix the balsamic mixture in right before serving and don't let it sit for too long getting warm.  I also use a mixture of romaine and baby spinach.

This went great with our Turkey Gyros.  Although any raspberry dressing would be great with it if you don't feel like making your own.

Amazing salad and dressing!!! I'm not a huge fan of balsamic and this recipe also called for a lot of ingredients I was afraid to use but it turned out Delicious!! I made it on Valentines day to go with a provolone chicken dish. My boyfriend LOVED it.  The only thing I omitted was the feta cheese, neither of us are a huge fan of it.  Can't wait to make it again, Thank you.

Excellent recipe. I used a mixture of greens instead of romaine by itself. It does make a lot of dressing - I feel like I use a lot of dressing with salad, but I still had a ton left over. I love this recipe and will definitely make it again!

We LOVE this!!! Mmmm, my mouth is watering just writing this! I am going to make it again tonight. We change out the greens and usually use a spinach blend and cut back a bit on the oil and add a bit more sugar. With strawberries in season now this is SO GOOD! We love this flavor combination. Thanks!

A keeper! Delicious and very pretty!
I followed the recipe except for the 1 cup of veggie oil which I substituted for half a cup of olive oil as per others' suggestions.  I added a few blueberries too, and would have taken a picture but the fam was too eager to chow down. Great accompanied with bbq chicken.

WOW this is really good. Might go lighter on the oil next time, say, 1/2-3/4c instead. Olive oil might be too strong a flavor for this. Also, I just happened to have these vinegars so I went with it. So glad I did!

 Make this. You won't regret it.

I used strawberry blush wine vinegarette as the dressing, it’s a nice tangy alternative to regular dressing. I found my dressing at Safeway  “Breann” is the brand.

I tweak the ingredients but stay close to original...I added some cherry tomatoes, spinach, celery, and shaved carrot. The dressing was pretty much the same. The wife loved it.

This is a delicious salad but could earn the 5th star by adding chicken and raisins/craisins and maybe even some chopped apple and red onion. The dressing was really good an I will likely make again- I did use olive oil (refuse to use veg oil unless necessary) and I cut this down by half.  Used blueberry vinegar instead of raspberry as that is what I had.  Will certainly make the dressing again and add all the goodies mentioned next time.

Used raspberries instead of strawberries and only used 1/2 C oil and 1 T balsamic vinegar.  Added real bacon bits on top. Yum!

Great recipe, no modifications needed. I tried it with the dressing tossed in with the salad and dressing on the side. I prefer tossed in with the salad as the flavor is more balanced than on the side.

We had at least 8 different dishes served over dinner, and this is the one that I received the most compliments on! The dressing by itself is a keeper, but when the salad is loaded with ripe strawberries and crumbled feta, you just can't go wrong!

Beyond amazing. I love the recipes where flavors combine perfectly to provide an exceptional dining experience, and this dish will NOT disappoint.  To top it all off, it's simple to make! (The only caveat is that I found the raspberry vinegar to be a bit on the expensive side, at least at Whole Foods, but what isn't? I was afraid to substitute.) I changed the serving size to 6 as it wasn't the main course. I'm seriously contemplating making the dressing and keeping it in the fridge so I can have this salad anytime!

Delish!  Made this salad, cut down the oil to 1/2 cup.  At first everyone was skeptical but they tried little servings and kept going back for more and bigger helpings.  The bowl was pretty much licked clean.  So good!!

This is delicious!  I thought the vegetable oil might be too much but it actually worked out well.  I was not able to find raspberry vinegar so I used pomegranate vinegar and it was still super delicious.  I also used  butter lettuce instead of romaine, pecans with almond pieces (which I did not toast) and the dressing.  Yummy! UPDATE 07/08/2012 I had to update this review because really, this salad is awesome.  I am not able to find the raspberry vinegar and using the pomegranate vinegar is really tasty.  Since strawberries are not entirely in season now, they aren't as naturally sweet and this dressing brings their flavor out perfectly.  The feta adds a lovely tang combined with the crunchy almonds.  If there was such a thing as a perfect salad, this would be it!

Excellent.  Recipe makes a ton of dressing...be careful not to overdress!

Beautiful before the dressing was added. However, once I mixed in the dressing it gave the salad a very wilted/browned appearance - not very appealing at all. I would suggest not going with the dressing at all, the salad doesn't seem to need any, and definitely not as much as the recipe calls for (although this could just be my own eccentricity), or at least serving the dressing on the side. -------- I also tried making another salad like this except substituting chopped green apples and soaked craisins for the strawberries (as suggested by another reviewer), minus the dressing, and it was as delicious as the strawberry one, but in a crispier way.

Im going with the crowd on this one.....AWESOME! My boyfriend said this was the one salad he has eaten that didnt even really need the dressing. The dressing, however, was awesome! I do agree with the others tho..watch out for the oil!

Pretty good.  I tried it with watermelon since I'm not crazy about strawberries.  Would like to have the dressing have some more bite - perhaps a bit more balsamic vinegar?

Like another commenter, we used fat free raspberry vinaigrette instead of the dressing here.  We also used pecans & chopped up chicken cooked in a little canola oil with Everglades seasoning.  Delicious!

great tasting salad with the strawberries and feta, but i gave it 4 stars because of the oil dressing.  not a fan of oil dressings, esp. since it separates from the rest of the ingredients and have to have it in a container that you can always shake before adding it to the salad (i let people put their own dressing on).

OMG! I LOVED this salad. If I could give it 10 stars I would.  I had to use raspberry vinegrette dressing instead of raspberry vinegar because I didn't have any, but that was my only substitution. I will start making this instead of the strawberry/spinach salad that used to be my favorite. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

The salad is very beautiful, but there might have been a tad too much garlic in it for my taste.  Maybe my two cloves were way too big.  My husband said he liked it but none of my other dinner guests commented on the salad.

Took this to a BBQ and had a TON of compliments.  I put the dressing on the side and let people put their own on.  There was a lot left over.  It makes a very large portion.

This is a great recipe!  I couldn't find Rasberry Vinegar though, so I used a little rasberry vinagrette instead.  Topped with grilled chicken, this is a perfect summer dinner.

I think I died and went to heaven when I ate this salad!!  I eat the basic balsamic vinegar salad every day for lunch, and after I went strawberry picking, I needed a new thing to do witht the strawberries.  This is the best salad I ever tasted.  I made it 4 times in a row this weekend for different bbq's because I could not wait for others to try it.  Thank you.

It's blazing hot outside & this was the perfect dish for a day like today. Added some chicken & avocado because I used it as a main meal salad. Really great. No changes to the dressing. Tasty any way you put it together. Well liked by everyone.

This was good, though I used a baby spring mix for the greens.  I think it might have given it a different flavor than if I just used romaine.  My kids did not like this unfortunately, but my DH loved it.  I cut back a little on the oil and just drizzled it over each plate of salad.

I made this recipe for our Easter dinner, and everyone enjoyed it.  I added less almonds, (1/2 cup) and also added some sliced red onion.  But the most important part is the dressing, it is insanely good!  My husband loves it so much that we keep a bottle of it in the fridge all the time now. Great recipe!

I made this salad for a Christmas luncheon at our art museum. Was a huge hit! I had people wanting seconds. I suggest serving this salad to any large group of people as it was very easy and a good compliment dish to an entree. I substituted the almonds for mandarin oranges (to give the salad more color) and the vegetable oil for extra virgin olive oil.

Due to some miscalculation and mistakes, I used hazelnuts instead of almonds, raspberry vinegrette instead of raspberry vinegar and skipped the balsamic vinegar. Still very nice and sweet.

Excellent salad!!  I made this for a picnic and it was gone in 5 minutes with everyone asking for the recipe.  Wonderful, fresh salad.  I just decreased the oil like the others suggested.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, I'll be making this one again and again.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I cut back a little on the oil and add water instead to make it lighter.  At our house it is the first choice in salad.  Thanks so much!!

I made this exactly as described and it was great.  I only used about half of the amount of dressing it called for though and even that was too much.

Wow!  This salad is wonderful.  The balance of flavours and textures is perfect, and the strawberries marinated in the balsamic dressing are sooo heady good!  Thank you for sharing!

We really like the combination of flavors on this salad. I added just a bit of white sugar to the dressing as I found it to have too strong of a vinegar taste for my liking.  Very good.  I'll definitely make again.

What a great salad! I'm always looking for unique salads with lots of trimmings, and this one certainly fits the bill. I used walnuts instead of almonds as I had them on hand, and the first time I made it I used some Raspberry Vinaigrette I already had instead of the Raspberry vinegar and it worked great. Make a lot of it because it will disappear fast!

i thought the berries and cheese worked very well together. do make the dressing seperately so that everyone can add their preference. it was a hit with my friends at a recent party. thanks!

I loved the dressing for this salad, but I changed up some of the ingredients a bit. I used baby spinach instead of the romain lettuce, and goat cheese instead of the feta. The creamy, less salty goat cheese added a bit of a different taste. I've also been thinking about using walnuts instead of almonds.

Awsome recipe!!  Makes a lot of dressing, so if you don't like your salad swimming in dressing, don't pour it all on the salad.  Have made numerous times!!!

Terrific salad! We both loved it. The dressing was especially good. We used it for the rest of the week on all of our salads. Will definately make again.

I added raspberries and substituted raspberry balsamic vinegar as opposed to separate vinegars.  I loved it.
