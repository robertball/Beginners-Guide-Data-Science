I used some personalized touches...fried the bacon, onion and garlic together, saving the bacon drippings ( in place of the olive oil) and flavorings..added the other ingredients  of the dressing to the fry pan, heated thru and poured over the spinach, eggs, and mushrooms.. yummy..but eat it all the same sitting...as it does not keep well.

This was yummy.  My family just loved it!  We added a few extra's to the salad, like mandarin oranges and dried cranberries.  We also added some grilled chicken.  The dressing was out of this world and worked well!

Thanks!

I'm going to keep playing around with the dressing in this recipe. For my family, the vinegar was too strong. I think I'll slightly increase the amount of honey and slightly decrease the amount of vinegar and mustard.

This is hands-down the best salad that I have ever had. My fiance was wary of a warm spinach salad, but after we sat down and started eating, he changed his tune VERY fast. I did not have any shallots or fresh garlic (someone keeps throwing my garlic out! The horror!) but used a fourth of a medium-sized onion and it was great. The best part of it is that there aren't really any flavors that dominate...it's crunchy from the almonds, a little salty from the bacon, a touch sweet from the cheese and the honey. We will be making this one again soon! Thanks for a great recipe, brightlightz!

This salad is perfect.  The flavors blend beautifully.  The swiss cheese and almonds are a wonderful addition.  There is a lot going on in this salad and every taste is there making your mouth very happy!  I didn't have enough honey, so I used corn syrup and honey when making the dressing.  It worked perfectly and tasted fabulous.

The dressing on this salad is so good. I poured some extra on some cooked potatoes the next day for an instant potato salad. Great recipe!

This salad is AWESOME!  I don't even like 'wilted' salads and I only tried this recipe because I had tons of fresh lettuce that needed used up.  I didn't have all of the ingredients that it called for and it still turned out fabulous.  I had to use plain mustard and  white vinegar for the dressing and for the salad I only had lettuce and cheese.  I can't imagine how good it will be made with everything the recipe calls for!!  Thanks for a great recipe--It was delicious.

I followed this recipe exactly and my husband's comment was, "It tastes like you just poured mustard on it."   The dressing was too thick, way too strong and didn't cover all the salad. I didn't throw it out, but didn't enjoy it either.

Thanks for adding this recipe.  It's a keeper in my house. The only thing I did differently is to add more bacon.  I'm a bacon addict.

Great salad. I had purchased baby spinach and had hard-cooked eggs in the fridge. I had Provolone slices on hand so I cut it thin slices, used slivered almonds, mandarin oranges and canned sliced mushrooms since I did not have fresh. The hot dressing was the clue to a great wilted salad. It was filling for me and a side dish for my hubby. Loved it. Thanks.

1st off, this dressing is soooooo good!!  I did alter it a little bit- I didn't have any white wine vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar.  Also, I didn't have any shallots, so I just used a little finely minced red onion instead.  I forgot to put extra bacon in the dressing, but I don't think that really made much of a difference- I think there was enough flavor already since instead of sauteeing in EVOO, I just used 1/2 bacon fat and 1/2 EVOO.  Everything else I kept the same in the dressing.  I also didn't have baby spinach, just regular spinach.  No swiss cheese or almonds either, so I just used finely shredded cheddar (just what I had on hand).  I had planned on serving this alongside some simple spaghetti and meat sauce.  Well, we never got to the spaghetti because this salad was just too darn good!!  My husband loved the dressing and the combination of the bacon, mushrooms and eggs with the spinach.  I am sure it is even better (if that's even possible???) with the swiss and almonds in it.  This alongside some fresh bread, and I was satisfied.  I think it would be great with some grilled chicken.  Can't wait to have this again!!!!

This is truly a 5 star steakhouse style salad. It is easily adaptable to items on hand. I left out the cheese and almonds to save a few calories and fat but I did you the bacon drippings to saute the shallot and garlic. I have used different vinegars depending on what I have on had, sometimes white balsamic, sometimes rice wine, sometimes white wine vinegar. My husband and son raved!

I  didn't follow directions.  Mixed  dressing ingredients all together and let it sit all day  then heated it in the end.  Was going to swap the swiss for goat but forgot that.  Turkey bacon instead, and more of it, no mushrooms, added a bit of salmon, more garlic.  Loved it but for us maybe a tad more vinegar.

This a great but I wouldn't say it is quick to make what with having to make bacon, hard boil eggs, and chopping stuff. I would also say you should double the dressing recipe and be sure to use quality ingredients for the vinegar and mustard. Simple dressings require top notch ingredients to really work well. I also think four servings is crazy. This makes at least 8.

I tripled this recipe for a large gathering at thanksgiving.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding more bacon. I was able to make it all in advance (that morning), package the ingredients separately and do a last minute combine and toss at the party in a large bowl.  I reheated the dressing in the microwave just before tossing. everyone absolutely loved it.

This was delicious! I didn't realize I didn't have any bacon, and it was good without it. The dressing was fabulous. Even my hubby liked it, and he's not much of a salad person. This is a keeper!

What an AMAZING salad! Very tasty and light. I think allrecipes got the nutritional info wrong...no way is there 57 grams of fat per serving in this salad. I will definitely be serving this again. Thank you!

This is, hands down, the best warm salad I've ever had. My husband and I are vegetarian, and I just substitute a fake bacon product (on their own, fake bacon products are relatively nasty, but crumbled into this salad and dressing? Amazing.). This salad is diverse enough for a main dish, and cut down to two servings is the perfect side. Let the dressing cool slightly before pouring it into the salad, or your cheese will turn into a gloppy mess (still good. Just rather clumpy).

Loved it!  All the ingredients go together so well.  I have to say my favorite part is the dressing with the bacon.  The only change I made was to sub. 1/4 cup sugar for the honey.

Followed the recipe exactly, except bags of baby spinach leaves tend to come in 6oz. sizes. I used one bag and the same amount of the rest of the ingredients and found that this fed FAR more than 4 people (8 people ate off of it as a large side). If you use the 6oz size, you may find that you can halve the rest of the recipe and it will feed 4 people. If you are serving it as a main course with chicken, then the 4 serving size makes more sense. Otherwise, the vibrant flavors in this dressing are amazing, and using the recipe for the dressing portion alone will be repeated.

This is one of those no-fail salad recipes that holds up well to additions/substitutions or omissions. For instance, I used parmesan, real bacon bits and subbed vidalia onion for the shallot. I also used rice wine vinegar, added craisins and toasted pecans, as well as omitted the mushrooms. I'd suggest plating individual salad portions and pouring the dressing into each serving to avoid a soggy, wilted mess. I refrigerated the leftover dressing until the following day and tossed it into a wild rice dish for extra flavor. I love this salad and any remaining dressing can be repurposed too -- a win-win!

The guys really raved about this one. I read through the reviews and I'm not a fan of overly vinegar dressings, so I did reduce the vinegar a bit, glad I did, for me it was still very prominent but once in the salad, it was fine. All the ingredients of the salad go very well together, the amount of Swiss cheese can easily be reduced, we just topped our salad with it. We took the cooks suggestion and added grilled chicken strips...a nice filling summer meal in one dish.

Used less vinegar and mustard.  Used green onion instead of the shallot.  Cooked bacon and then sauteed onion and garlic in drippings with additional olive oil.  Did not use cheese, nuts or mushrooms.

Made for Christmas dinner and turned out well...there are a lot of steps to this salad, and the dressing needs to be made at the last minute, so schedule accordingly.  I eyeballed all the ingredients, including the dressing and it turned out well.  The only thing I might do differently next time is add 1-2 TBS sugar to the dressing...the honey didn't give the right sweet/tart ratio for me.

TIP:  toss the salad components just before you add the warm dressing to keep the cheese from sticking to itself; then re-toss after adding the dressing.  I prepared this for a Casual Gourmet group and was a hit!

Great way to get almost anyone to eat spinach.   Only tip, the dressing has a very strong vinegar taste/odor. Preparing earlier in the day and allowing it to marinade eliminates this.

Perfection! My only change was to use Karo syrup in place of the honey and it worked out well enough that I'll continue using it because I don't keep honey in the house.   Top it with any protein or have it plain with warmed bread, delicious! I've served it with shrimp, salmon, sirloin and chicken and it's consistently getting raves.   Thanks for providing a summer staple for my house!

Everyone loved this salad, but I couldn't quite give it 5 stars.  I really expected the dressing to be more bacon-y, but it was more of a honey mustard dressing with some bacon thrown in.  Not really sure how you get more bacon flavor - maybe add bacon drippings to it?  The dressing was really good though - I kept tasting for sweetness as the dijon does tend to make it a little salty.

Absolutely Fantastic!!  I would say this salad is comparable to being "restaurant quality".  So many dimensions and flavors. I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used a 50/50 mix of white cooking wine and apple cider vinegar.  My spinach didn't wilt too much at all, maybe because I let it sit out until almost room temp, and I also allowed the dressing to cool a little to thicken before pouring. Definitely a keeper that will be served often. The only thing I will do different next time is double the dressing.

Excellant.  I followed this recipe exactly, served it for Christmas dinner and it was a hit!  For those that think the vinegar is too much, just use a high quality product and it really makes a difference.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used shaved parmigiano/reggiano instead of swiss cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe as it is listed.  If you don't like the tang and tartness of the dijon, then you might want to use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for and add a little more olive oil.  We will definitely make this a regular dish!

Good overall recipe, I would cut the Dijon to maybe 1/4 cup though. Dressing was very overpowering with the mustard taste.

Delicious! I sauteed onion in olive oil then added precooked and crumbled bacon. Stirred in red wine vinegar, mustard, honey and some mayo to mellow the vinegar. To the spinach I added a few sliced strawberries and mushrooms. Topped with warm dressing and combined well. I put some of the salad in containers for lunches and packaged dressing separately. Ate the rest for dinner. Yum!

Made this recipe for a per holiday dinner.  With one slight change.  I did not have a drop of honey in the house.  Substituted agave syrup.  Only four people at dinner.  There were twice baked potatoes left on the plates and a bit of prime rib, however not one ounce of this salad.  It is definately a keeper and have passed the recipe to many.

I hate it when someone rates the recipe on their revised version, but I made a small revision-I did not have white wine vinegar and used rice vinegar instead-it was great!!!  I do not care for white wine vinegar in the first place, so the rice vinegar was perfect, it did not overwhelm the dressing!!  Also added cranberries!!

I made for Easter dinner- I wanted something new on the dinner table.  I followed the directions exactly except I didn't have white wine vinegar, only red.  When I tasted the warm dressing I didn't really love it, or even like it however, on the salad it was sooo delicious.  It was the best salad I have made, and I think I just found a staple for holiday meals.

Overall, this is a good spinach salad.  However, we found the mustard in the dressing to be overwhelming.  It was still reasonably good, but not something I will make again.  I think one key to this recipe is to make sure the mustard you use is one that your family really, really likes.

Very very good! Didn't use mushrooms or swiss cheese (since I forgot to buy them-used some shredded Parmesan) and also left the almonds out for allergy reasons. Made the sauce as directed. SOOOOO good! Made a very  nice addition to our Memorial Day BBQ. Will become a regular on our menu.  Thank for sharing!

This is a great recipes. The only suggestion is to not put the dressing until you are ready to eat it. It gets soggy and wilts too much. Will definitely make it again!

I made it, well, almost.  I didn’t have any swiss cheese, and I thought that cheese would make it heavier than I wanted.  Also, I can’t imagine a spinach salad without red onion, so I added about 1/4 of a red onion, sliced very thin on a mandolin, and soaked in white wine vinegar for about 1/2 hour (soaking onions in vinegar really cuts down the sharp onion flavor, making them mellower and sweeter), and I substituted chopped walnuts for the almonds.  The dressing was very good, the walnuts gave a nice crunch, and the combination of flavors was great.  I’m not sure that I would ever add swiss cheese, though next time (and I’ll definitely make this again) I might add bleu cheese crumbles.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to lightly saute the mushrooms first as I have a raw mushroom hater in the family.  Extra dressing keeps well, we could eat this over & over!

This would have been 5 stars...  first I double it except for the mustard.  Who doesn't like having a little left over.  I use the bacon drippings to cook the onions and garlic.  I also use rice vinegar.  We really love it.

I made slight alterations based on what I had.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and also cooked it in bacon fat and it was delicious.  That was the only change I made to the dressing.  I also added avocado and parmasean.  I left out mushrooms, almonds and swiss cheese because I didn't have it.  I think this recipe was awesome with the changes I made but would also be just as good as is.

I made this for Easter dinner and got rave reviews. I substituted red onion for the shallot and left off the almonds (due to nut allergy), but otherwise this was great! Made double the dressing just so I would have leftovers for dinner salads this week.

This salad was amazing! The dressing was perfect- I have never found a better recipe for warm bacon dressing. Thank you for sharing! I made a few alterations too. I used sliced baby bella mushrooms, added sliced red onion, and subbed feta for the swiss cheese, and used thickcut pepper bacon. Again- thank you!

This was the most delicious salad!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  The only change I made was I used a mixture of olive oil and bacon drippings for the dressing. This is definitely a keeper!:-)

This made a really good lunch salad for me.  I love the dressing - although I did make a couple of changes because I used bacon grease instead of olive oil and cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  Instead of mushrooms I used cubed cooked potato and mixed everything together in the skillet, slightly wilting the spinach.  The potato gave it a slight taste similarity to German Potato Salad.

This dressing is wonderful! I made a double recipe and didn't have enough honey so used half honey and half maple syrup. I also used turkey bacon. I made the dressing several hours before serving so the flavors had a chance to meld and then warmed for about a minute in the microwave. My guests liked it so much I had to put out extra spinach after they finished a huge salad bowl full just so they could have more dressing.

Deee-licious, down to the last drop of dressing!  It's not the healthiest salad, but it's definitely the tastiest. I love the hot dressing (which I heated in the microwave instead of getting another pan dirty).

This salad was pretty good.  I did make a few changes.  I added mozzarella instead of swiss to suit our tastes, and added chicken to make it a meal.  The salad was wonderful, I wasn't too keen on the dressing.  It wasn't the typical flavor I really enjoy in a honey mustard dressing.  I don't really care for warm dressing on my cold salad, so I did not heat it up.  I'll make this again, as both my husband and I really enjoyed the salad, but I'll keep looking for a different honey mustard dressing.

This turned out so well. The only thing I didn’t have was the sunflower oil so I used olive oil. I used a ton of bacon (so much easier with the pre cut pieces from Costco) and it was delish!

I’d make it again even if I don’t ever find the right oil!

I can't get enough raw spinach so I make lots of salads. This was great although I'll cut back on the Dijon next time. It gave the dressing a slight bite I didn't like.

Revision to earlier review. I used crumbled queso fresco instead of swiss and only used half as much mustard as called for. Still 5 stars.

Sooo good, I don't really measure except when baking and after reading the other reviews I added the vinegar,  honey and dijon to taste. Plus knowing it wouldn't keep well and it's just me I tossed the salad  and stored it and the dressing separately.  I ate it as a side to my steak but I can think of so many things to so with this!

Loved this recipe for spinach salad.  I adapted The dressing based on what I had on hand.  I used red wine vinegar, stone ground mustard, and maple syrup.  Very good, the almonds were the perfect crunch, don't leave them out!

Classic flavor combo and relatively easy to prepare. The salad dressing was super-pungent by itself, but great in the context of the full salad.  Next time I’ll lighten it up a bit with more veggies.  As written it served 5 at a dinner party with second helpings and some leftovers.  I’d say it serves 6, not 4.

I made this during a heat wave here in CT. I cooked the bacon on my cast iron skillet on the grill side burner,. Come the first day of summer and I don't cook indoors at all all summer! Made everything table side! I had a half skinless, boneless chicken breast I filleted, cooked on grill with S&P, garlic, fresh tomatoes and some fresh basil in some aluminum foil to serve with this salad, PERFECT! The only thing I did diffrent was no mushrooms or almonds.

I like a warm salad sometimes. The dressing on this is really good. The recipe made enough to coat the spinach. Unfortunately, I didn't have any almonds so I went without.

This is my second attempt. The first batch was amazing, but it was really spicy due to the mustard and vinegar. This go-round, I diluted the vinegar with water and used a spicy mustard dijonaise (instead of the standard Dijon mustard). Now it doesn’t have that much kick, so next time I’ll make some more tweaks, but still it’s a great, hearty salad. Also I deleted the nuts and cheese and instead added thinly sliced red onions and cherry tomatoes. Also, buy quality bacon....it really makes or breaks your salad. My favorite is Trader Joe’s Baccon.

I basically used this recipe for the dressing  with a spinach salad that is similar.  The dressing is delicious.  I will be making this often.

Let me explain my rating....first off, the dressing itself was excellent!  Only change I made was to use apple-cider vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.  But the overall salad we found less satisfying.  Pouring the warm dressing on the salad simply made a wilted, soggy mess, that no one really enjoyed in our family.  I guess our personal preference is for a cold/fresh tasting salad.  I might try this again by letting the dressing cool first before adding it.

I used apple cider vinegar, German hot mustard, and green onions. Skipped the olive oil but fried the onions and garlic in the bacon pan with a bit of drippings. I forgot to add the cheese and it was still outstanding! Even the "non-salad" people in the family loved it! Sauce to spinach proportion was perfect.

I like this as a satisfying lunch when we are craving  “breakfast” but want a healthier meal than bacon and eggs.  I usually leave out the cheese and reduce the bacon.

Excellent recipe. I added leftover grilled steak.  Used sharp cheddar and toasted pecans and pine nuts  instead of Swiss and almonds due to lack of ingredients called for. However looking forward to making  this again as written. Delish

The first time I make something, I try to make it as written and that is what I did with this and it is so delicious as is, not sure what could possibly improve it, but could consider adding Craisins next time. I took it to a potluck and reviews were outstanding so a big hit all around. I will make it again soon.

Surprisingly this was really good! I wasn’t sure because of the mixed reviews & I doubled the recipe & did rough measurements. I also preserved some of the dressing to heat up the next day for leftovers. I will have to update this review & let you know how that works out. I will be making this again.

Update: This was really good the next day. Please note, I saved the dressing separately and heated it up to pour on top of the salad the next day. Will be making this again and my son loved it!

Yum!  I must admit that I replaced the oil with bacon fat (which upped the calorie count significantly, I'm sure.). But I also eliminate the cheese and cut back on the honey and Dijon, so....  At any rate, it was delicious. We had it as a main dish, along with rice pilaf and fruit salad.  We will definitely put this one on the menu again!

I thought this was a very good recipe but as always I make alterations.  I couldn't understand why use olive oil when making a bacon dressing, I cooked 6 slices and used the bacon drippings for the dressing, and it was incredible.  The rest with the dijon, white wine vinegar and honey all worked very well with the garlic stir fried into the bacon and whisked the other sauce ingredients and it was so tasty.  My husband said I could sell it.  I did omit the almonds, which I am allergic to, but I'd not have used them anyway, and I used mozza not swiss, because I didn't have swiss on hand.  I had no shallots so used two fresh cloves of garlic, and poured over fresh same day spinach and local, it doesn't get any better.  I rated it 4 because of the olive oil, made no sense to me.

This was a very flavorful salad and it makes a lot! I will probably use less spinach or make more dressing next time as my husband wanted more dressing on his. My daughter was unsure about how well these ingredients would go together, but was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it very much.

I had saved this recipe a while back as I love spinach salad and really wanted to try this dressing. I made it a couple days after Easter when we were craving something light and healthy. Used spinach, mushrooms, red onions, grape tomatoes and basically what I had in the house. Skipped the bacon and cheese this time, but used a little bacon fat to make the dressing. Used rice vinegar as this is what I had. The dressing made the salad, it was so good I can't wait to try again as written. Add some chicken strips to make a full meal.

This is a great spinach salad! I've started taking it with me to potlucks and everyone always asks for the recipe. It's super healthy and hearty enough to eat it for lunch. Toast the sliced almonds in the oven while assembling the salad. It gives them an amazing flavor. This was the first salad my 8 year old daughter would eat. I've omitted ingredients here and there, but I love the original recipe as written.

I looked for over  a year to find a warm spinach/bacon/egg salad recipe like the one we used to serve at a country club i worked at - this is it!!! Even my husband who is a true carnivore loved this salad.  Could even stand to use only 1 piece of bacon on each salad if you wanted to cut down on the fat since the dressing has bacon in it already.  I made it exactly like the recipe directed and it came out delish!

It was perfect the way the recipe was written. No changes needed. Flavorful and tasted like a salad at a 5 star restaurant should taste. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Dressing was my favorite part of the dish.... Yummy. ??

I made this salad for New Year's Eve and everyone loved it and many commented that it was the best salad that they have ever had!  Highly recommend! I added a plate of sliced avocados, baby Bella's, organic grape tomatoes and some red quinoa, more for looks than anything, but everyone was adding things. Quite colorful and hearty. Not sure if it enhanced the salad, but it was fun!!  We served it with mountains of crab legs and butter, and home made Artisan bread. Unfortunately I forgot to take a pic!!  Happy New Year!

Put in 1/4 cup mustard and honey and added roughly  2 Tbsp more vinegar. This was a hit at the dinner party.

I made a very scaled-down version of this. Great salad and simple, flavorful dressing! I did not have the cheese or almonds to add, but I imagine it would be so much better with those.

Delicious salad, and one that I'd make again! I skipped the mushrooms, because I didn't have any. I adjusted the dressing ingredient amounts, because I knew that equal parts of vinegar, honey & Dijon mustard was not going to work for us. I used 3 Tblsp of the vinegar & honey, and only about 1 Tblsp of the mustard, and then also added some EVOO as well. It was really really good, and the kids gobbled it up too (and it's a struggle to get them to eat salads)! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I will definitely be making this salad again!  Turned it into a main course by adding grilled chicken.  I also used the bacon dripping after discarding the grease to sauté the garlic and shallots. I substituted shredded cheddar cheese instead of the Swiss.

The family loved it.  We combined the dressing ingredients (except I substituted the wine vinegar with white cooking wine)in the same skillet we cooked the bacon, using some of the residual drippings.  We heated the dressing until it thickened; which took about 5 minutes.  The dressing clung to the salad better and tripling the mustard, wine, and honey made enough for our family of five.  Will definitely serve it again, and book marked it!

This was a wonderful & delicious salad. I changed it up a bit. I added chicken (for a more filling meal & our protein), sautéed the mushrooms & then added the shallots & garlic, & also Gorgonzola instead of Swiss.

I tweaked the dressing a bit -- used agave instead of honey and honey mustard instead of 
Dijon.  I also used rice vinegar as it isn't as acidic.  My husband and I loved it and will make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly always the first time I make it and then tweak it to my family's likings  Thought that the vinegar was a little strong the first time we ate it but second time reheated the dressing it was great. Hubby said it was even better than the first time. My suggestion double the dressing , store in refrigerator it's great for a quick meal

Loved it! This is a classic, and one of my favorite salads; this is the first time I have found a dressing recipe that completely killed my craving for a spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. This will be a frequent flyer at my house.

My pantry was a little short on the honey and mustard but I did my best to adjust.  Loved the dressing but like other users, used some bacon drippings for extra flavor.  Thanks for the recipe and I'll be making it again!

This was the BEST salad recipe I've ever tried.  I didn't have shallots, so I used a Vidalia onion, but for the most part I followed the recipe exactly.  This will definitely be on my Favorites list!

Made this twice so far.  Added some turkey from previous night's dinner plus some mushrooms.  Turned out to be a nice touch making the salad a complete meal.  Second time made as written as a side salad with grilled cheese sandwiches.  A good go to salad when you want something  a bit off the ordinary path.

Absolutely the best salad I have ever made from scratch. I added dried cranberries because I found a bag at Publix that has the toasted almonds and dried cranberries in it.

The salad absolutely wonderful and I just don't like vegetables but I sure ate this

I made this for a meal for two people.            I reduced the spinach to ~6 oz, cut the cheese to 5 oz.
substituted sunflower seed for the almonds, etc
but I made the full amount of dressing.

Yummy!  Didn't have shallots but sliced yellow onions thin.   Dressing was very mustardy but really good. Lots of dressing, I actually used more spinach than was called for. Really good.

Great recipe! The almonds didn't add much except a little crunch. I'll try toasted pecans next time. Will become a regular recipe in my rotation!

This recipe is awesome. Have been making a similar one for years and would have a hard time picking a favorite. I've made it with both spinach and lettuce. I like the spinach best.

I really enjoyed the salad, I used balsamic vinegar instead.  However, unless I am particularly slow the prep time is way off.
The recipe says 5 mins, it takes at least 5 mins just to cook the bacon.  Take a good look at the steps and judge your time accordingly.

I hate to say this, but I have made this 6 nights straight now changing it up with different meats, pork, chicken, beef and shrimp. Absolutely the best recipe I have ever made. FANTASTIC as a main course and I have not eaten a "salad" in 10 years:) I really recommend adding the meat to make it a main dish. Tonight it is terriaki beef strips!

This was a Keeper in my recipe book!   I used half of a large box of spinach, so it may be 6 oz.  I followed the rest of the recipe, but cut the mustard to 1/4 cup, since a reviewer said it was too strong.  The dressing was perfect and no need to add salt.  The amount of dressing was perfect for that amount of spinach.    I may toss the salad before I add the dressing, because as another reviewer said, it could get gooey with the cheese.  Great find!

This was so good! Added a few more ingredients from another recipe I found here (beautiful salad). Husband gave me a thumbs up and he's not a fan of spinach. I was so proud of myself for getting the dressing right. Will be making it again!

This recipe had a few different twists than some traditional warm spinach salads I've made. We really liked the flavor of the dressing and the sprinkle of shredded Swiss cheese. We loved this salad  and it was easy to make.

I think the trick to this is to get the dressing very, very hot, so it wilts the spinach. Mine wasn't hot enough, so it turned out kind of gloppy. I wish I could review without giving stars because the result was more my fault than the recipe's.

I loved it as did my husband.  I didn't have Swiss cheese so I grated some cheddar.  I added cranberries.  I followed the suggestions of jshanson and used bacon drippings and added the dressing ingredients to the pan.  It was quick, tasty and easy.  I will definitely make again.

the dressing was delicious.  Had to use half truffle mustard as I ran out of Dijon and no wine vinegar so used white. Still fantastic. Baking potatoes now so I can have warm potatoe salad for supper.

Very good but I substituted my old fashioned dressing for the mustard one.   Mine is:  1 cup oil, 2/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1/3 cup catchup, dash of salt & pepper and 1 tsp sugar or use an artificial sweetener -just a dash.  I half the amounts since I don't need that much.  Keeps well in the refrigerator.

This recipe was incredible! You can change up the ingredients on top – I added fresh bean sprouts and left off the nuts – and it doesn't matter. The dressing makes it. The dressing was a little sweet for my taste, so next time I'll pull back on the honey a bit. But it really is awesome as is.

Made this for a large gathering at our house and everyone loved it.  I found the dressing too vinegary for my tastes, but others thought it was divine.  Next time I make this I'm going to go easy on the vinegar.  The type of mustard used will have an effect.  We have a very strong, vinegary French brand available here that I use, and it put a lot of zing in the dressing.

Very delicious salad. We did not have swiss cheese so subbed cheddar. Serves 6-8 rather than 4 in my opinion. We had so much left over and had to throw away due to dressing.

I liked this but it was VERY sweet.  I'd  definitely reduce the amount of honey.

Found that the dressing was incredibly strong for my tastes.  Luckily I found this out before putting it on.  Lightly tossed with a mixed quinoa (red, white, black), red onion (paper thin), and raw red pepper made the salad perfect.  I did fry the shallots  and garlic in the bacon drippings.  Good touch.  I also cooked some jerk shrimp to counter the sweetness of the dressing which turned out to be a great idea.  Lastly i added a small ice cream scoop of guacamole.  Overall, my parents, brother and I loved it.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I made this for my family and everyone enjoyed it.  It's easy to make and all the ingredients are readily available at any supermark without the hassle of going to a specialized market for some unique ingredient. It's been added to my recipe box and will definitely be used repeatedly.  DMcClure

I've made this a number of times. Super delicious and everyone loves it.  Reduce the vinegar to 1/4 cup as 1/3 is a little overwhelming.

This is a tasty salad. I skipped the dressing, not a mustard fan so just used a nice vinigarette. Also added tomatoes and a little feta. A good recipe with flexibility, thank you.

Deeeelish!  Made this today for the first time.  I will back off of the vinegar just a tad to suit my taste buds.  A very delicious salad and filling, as well.  Will make for friends and family this summer, for sure!  Thanks for sharing :0)

Oh my gosh this is a must when you need a great salad! I served this on the side with a couple of grilled T-Bone steaks although the steaks were awesome everybody raved over the salad. I omitted the boiled eggs b/c my bf doesn't care for them but followed the rest of the recipe to the T. This is definately a keeper and I can't wait to make it again! Thanks for sharing!

I substituted maple syrup for the honey and Seville bitter orange marinade (sold by Goya) for the vinegar (adding 2 tsp white vinegar for extra tartness) for an excellent dressing.  I skipped the egg, cheese, and almonds, but added 1/2 cup of roasted whole garlic cloves for a simple and satisfying dish.

I really liked the dressing, but I felt it had too strong of a mustard taste. I added more honey to neutralize the flavor, and it helped. Other than that, it was a hit! I will make it again.
