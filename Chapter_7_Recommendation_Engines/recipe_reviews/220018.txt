Yeah!  I finally found a recipe that my entire family raved about.  I made this as written for the most part, but used Velveeta shredded cheese in the grits.  I thought this made the recipe even richer, so next time I will use cheddar or Gouda cheese.  This is a very rich dish.  This makes alot of sauce, so next time I will use 2lbs of shrimp and more spinach and mushrooms and get 2 meals out of one recipe.  I don't think my family would frown over leftovers of this recipe.

I'm from Pensacola, FL and Chef Jim Shirley did, indeed, come up with this recipe at The Fish House.  It's a favorite on their menu and a favorite on our table.  If you want the grits a little thicker just cook them a bit longer, and if you want the sauce a little thicker just don't add quite as much heavy cream.   WONDERFUL!!!!

WONDERFUL!  I made this over the weekend and it was devine.  Next time I will make a few changes.  I will cook the grits in water instead of the chic stock.  Also at the end I will add only 1 cup heavy cream instead of 2.  I found that two cups left too much sauce behind.  1 cup will leave you with a thicker gravy.  I will definately be making this dish alot.  Thanks Irene.

I have never made or eaten grits before.  I wasn't even sure what grits were or what they were made out of until I googled them.  I used a yellow cornmeal to make them.  I also didn't have cream, so I used homo milk instead.  To thicken the sauce I added a bit of cornstarch mixed with cold water.
Tasted great, although I felt like I was eating cream of wheat cereal for supper. lol

Awesome! Will make over and over minus one cup of cream.  Family went back for thirds but, many noted you couldn't really find the grits, so to speak, because it was so soupy with cream.  I recommend just one cup at the end.  You can always add more, if needed.  I despised grits until this recipe.  Thank you SO much for sharing!!! I can't wait to make it again.

This was yummy!  Fairly easy... I didn't have the shallot or the spinach.  I also got mixed up halfway thru cooking and I accidently got 5 min grits.. So I put my cheese and 1/4 c cream in the grits... then added my chopped bacon.  I then sauted my mushrooms and onions in the skillet.  Added them to the grits. I had extra cheese so I added that along with the rest of the cream.  I then cooked the shrimp and just added it to the individual bowls.  I had a lot of grits left and no shrimp so I plan on freezing the grit mixture into individual grit cakes.  I will bread and deep fry them.  Then will make this sauce the correct way and serve with my grit cakes......Cant wait!

I tried this grits recipe after having a similar dish on vacation in Florida a few weeks ago & it turned out just as good as the one we had then!  I only fixed the grits but it was delicious & easy!

Amazing! My husband's favorite meal is Shrimp and Grits, so I made this for his birthday. He said it was the best he's ever had, which means a lot because he always gets it when we're out at various restaurants.  It does make a lot of sauce, which was great for an easy dinner tonight. I did thicken the sauce with some corn starch. Next time I will use more spinach and mushrooms because I like veggies and their nutrients!

Excellent shrimp and grits dish. Based on reviews, I used 2 lbs. of wild shrimp rather than 1 lb., cut back the heavy cream to 1-1/4 cups rather than 2 cups, and used about 2X the mushrooms and green onions only because I wanted to use up what I had. Next time, I'll go with another modification suggested by a reviewer to 2X the baby spinach. There was ample cream sauce even after cutting back the heavy cream. Served with "Perfect Fried Green Tomatoes" and "Sour Cream Cornbread". Great recipe Irene and thank you for sharing.

I doubled the smoked gouda in the grits. I like to have the gouda be almost bold. I plan to increase the time I reduce the shrimp sauce to 12-15 minutes. The flavor was great but the sauce was runny at 10 minutes.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I would recommend is to double the sauce which I did.  Each person gets more shrimp, about 5 pieces.  I served 6 people and had about 2 servings of the sauce left over.  Everyone raved about the dinner.  Absolutely will make again.

Grits with cheese has always been one of my favorite meals.  This is a new twist.  I like the grits cooked with cheese, butter, cream and stock so much that sometimes I simply make my grits that way.

We've made this complete dish as written a few times now and love it each and every time.  I have found that there is always extra sauce so we do one of two things: double the grits or put the leftover sauce on pasta.  I prefer this dish with gouda rather than smoked gouda, but that is truly just a personal preference.

One time I didn't have enough grits and I used some grits and some Cream of Wheat.  While I prefer it with grits, it worked surprisingly well with Cream of Wheat.

This is a very rich dish.  It is easy to overeat because it tastes to delicious.

I could not find regular grits anywhere and was forced to use the packets of Instant. Use 6 packets and add a little extra cream if needed. Recipe still comes out GREAT. I also prefer the shrimp chopped instead of whole. Doesn't look as pretty but tastes better because you get some shrimp in every bite.

I tried it for my husband for Father's day, and we all loved it! I left out the shallot and garlic and accidentally left out the bacon, which I will continue to leave out. We are making it again tonight, and we only need to buy a few ingredients, since we have most already. Can't wait to try it again!

This was so good! I love shrimp and grits but this was a little different. I do agree with another reviewer that this is very rich. I think the next time I make it I will cut back on the chicken stock for the grits a little. My grits seemed a little too runny for my taste. I had to let them cook longer to thicken them up. And it needs to be noted to use REAL grits, not the quick-cook kind. If you can get some from a mill, even better! I used stone ground yellow grits and, other than being a little thin, they were great with this recipe.

Best Shrimps and Grits EVER.  Made this for our Christmas brunch.  It screams "special" and that it is!  Served 4 adults and 3 children, so we doubled the grits and used chicken stock an milk to cook them.  If you aren't from the south and aren't familiar with grits, you need to cook them much, much longer than any directions call for (my directions say 20 minutes, but I cook them for at least an hour and 45 minutes - just add more milk, cream, or chicken stock as needed to keep them going).  We aren't big on onions, or shallots, so I only used half of a shallot - could have used the entire thing - it wasn't noiceable.  Next time, I'll use more spinach, maybe double.  All in all - this dish is amazing.  So rich and so tasty.  Saved the left over sauce and had the next night over pasta - fantastic again!

This is an awesome recipe. The original chef of this recipe is Chef Jim Shirley from the Florida Fish House in Pensacola. I've made it many times and it's always the party favorite. Just wanted to give credit to the originator.

Must try!  If you have never had gouda grits you are missing out!  I tried this recipe Friday night for the first time and it was a huge success.  I was only serving three people, but made enough for six so there would be leftovers.  Little did I know that it would be such a hit and would all be gone in one sitting.Can't wait to make this again!
