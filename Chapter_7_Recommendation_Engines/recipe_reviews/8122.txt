This was so great!! What are the chances I'd actually find a caterpillar cake when I looked for one.  I used a bundt pan that had angular peaks in it (because that's all I had!) but it came out well!!  I modeled mine after Eric Carle's "Very Hungry Caterpillar" and used it for my baby's 1st birthday.

I used a different cake recipe, but I used the decorating idea for my boyfriend's birthday cake.  (He's a kid at heart!)  I actually based my caterpillar on the Eric Carle "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" and it was a big hit!  I used spiral candles for antennae.  Also, I used mini-Oreos coated in red icing as ladybugs.  Very fun!

I didn't use the cake, or the frosting posted here (I made it all from scratch), but my 5 stars is for the great idea of using a bundt pan! wow! i have been making caterpillar cake for years now, for each of my children's 1st bdays, but i use a martha stewart baby idea, which requires a lot more work & using fondant- so it takes foreverrrr! this is great, easy & cute! i didn't make mine look so realistic like yours b/c that looks too much like a caterpillar & makes me want to gag :D i used candy covered gum drops for the legs & necco wafers for dots on top. so cute. thanks for the great idea!

This was a little more work than I had bargained for, but it turned out so cute, I can't complain. I made a smaller version of this cake for my son's first birthday and everyone just loved it...the birthday boy in particular. I placed it on large buttercream fondant leaves I'd made from a recipe on this site. I omitted the coconut (don't know if he's allergic yet) and decorated with Fruity Cheerios for spots and mini-marshmallows for eyes. I put extra frosting along the back and spiked it to make 'fur'. If you're no wuss when it comes to putting a little work into your baked goods, this is a fun little cake to tackle.

Absolutely adorable! Beautiful presentation! I received many compliments. Allow yourself extra time to ice and decorate the cake. I served this at a spring brunch! Everyone loved it and it was so yummy! My guests were afraid to cut the first piece though because they were afraid of ruining it!

I trippled this recipie for a large gathering, and it was amazing! The cake was inhaled! There was nothing left except some smears of icing and a few pieces of coconut! This was the easiest cake I've ever made, and was a total smash hit at my gathering.

This was perfect for my two year old's birthday!  I added a box of vanilla and a box of chocolate pudding and upped the eggs to 5.  Beat in a mixer according to directions.  I added swirl chocolate (and white chocolate) chips...a whole bag.  I also went with the very hungry caterpillar theme.  I put hershey kisses for the legs.  So cute!!!!!

I made this cake a few months ago for my son's birthday and it was a huge hit!  I saw the recipe somewhere else and it didn't call for the coconut, and I never thought to add it.  Everybody thought it was the coolest and it was all gone by the end of the party!

I made this for my daughter's 2nd birthday. I used Jr Mints for the eyes, M&M's for the back, orange slices for the feet, and surrounded it with green colored coconut flakes and some chocolate rocks. It was a big hit and I still get compliments from people when they see the pictures.

awesome idea! I made this with my two year old, & we had a blast making & decorating. made my own icing, & used stuffing icing to make stripes.
