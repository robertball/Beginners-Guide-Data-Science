This “cake” is more the texture of a dry pudding. I thought as I was making it that there was just too much spice for an 8X8 cake but really there’s not- the spices are just right! I did use a 9” springform pan, greased the sides and used parchment paper on the bottom which worked out very well. I was able to easily move the cake to a decorative plate. The maple and cinnamon whipped cream is absolutely the perfect topper for this dessert. I did add a whipped cream stabilizer as there are just two of us and we won’t finish it in one sitting. Thanks for sharing- it’s a keeper!

Great texture and taste was pretty good. Nice pumpkin flavor. Only gave it a 3 stars because I thought it was a lot of work.  It got a lot of dishes dirty and I am super lazy.  Mix the pumpkin with milk in a separate bowl?  Why?  I followed the directions exactly but if i did make it again I would not get so many bowls dirty. Like I said it has a really nice texture and - the topping was amazing.

I love pumpkin and have tried loads of different recipes over the years but this is the best one yet. I used buckwheat flour instead of all purpose flour and it still was the best pumpkin cake/pudding I've ever made or eaten and the icing is easy and has such wonderful flavours to accompany the cake. I love this recipe! And look forward to making it again.

Friends this is the best dessert I have ever tried! I made this as a little surprise for the man of my dreams, Talking about it  has my mouth watering and Taste buds going crazy.  It came out so good I finished the entire batch before anyone got home. I made it again the second night and didn’t have any until after dinner.  It was so good! Do yourself a favor and make this. You will be a hero.  I’m resting my feet right now while my family washes the dishes.  That’s right ladies and gentlemen they said it was so good I could rest while they cleaned.  I’m a lucky woman!

This is not a 'Magic Cake' since it did not separate into 3 layers as you can see in my photo. Did not care for it and will not make again.

I hate to say this but I would not make it again. It was disappointing. The color was unappetizing, not like pumpkin pie filling at all....kind of dark and almost gray. The maple whipped cream really does help it a lot. I just didn’t like the texture of this “cake”. The taste was not bad but not good enough to make again. I made it mostly as written except I did not whip up egg whites and fold in. I followed someone else’s advice on beating the whole eggs together in the batter. I didn’t think that would matter as pumpkin pie filling uses the whole egg as well and is a custard. My husband liked it ok but did not rave about it either. Oh, well, you try some and some are good and some are not. I’m going to try some pumpkin bars next. Fingers crossed.

2.12.20 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/259447/pumpkin-magic-cake-with-maple-cinnamon-whipped-cream/ ... 'Rated this four stars initially because it tastes good, but I won't be making again.  It isn't worth the steps, calories or fat; & most of this was thrown out.  A cup of sugar would be enough - especially with frosting, which I didn't make.  The texture is what I would describe as a wet/buttery mousse or a baked French toast.  It's different.

For those of you who read other reviews and wondered, "What's a dry pudding and what does it taste like?"  I would describe this as more like a custard in one layer and a moist flour base in another.  

I made it as my birthday cake, but it really is not that kind of a cake at all.  I think it would be better off replacing a pumpkin pie at a family gathering.  

It does not rise at all.  I thought with all the eggs and fluffiness it would at least puff up a little bit, but nope.  Don't be worried about filling your pan too full; it will not run over.   If I try this again, I will try adding some baking soda and/or powder.

Amazing!  A perfect balance of pumpkin, spice and sweet without being overly sweet.  Wonderful, moist texture.  I will be making this instead of pumpkin pie from now on.  It was a big hit with the whole family.
