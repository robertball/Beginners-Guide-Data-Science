This was one of the most simple and neat treats that I have ever made.  We took this to a party.  It stood out from the other foods.

I loved this recipe.  It was sooooo easy and so yummy.  I love the chocolate and peanut butter combo.  It was a hit with adults and kids alike at both parties that I took it to this year.  And it's so cute for presentation.  Thanks!!!

Very easy, similar to Rice Krispies Treats, but very rich, especially for younger kids. I served it at a school party, and while the kids ate a few bites, the grown ups gobbled it up.

LOVED IT! I took this to a Halloween party and it was a hit! It was so easy and came out as pretty as the picture. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the chocolate morsels.
