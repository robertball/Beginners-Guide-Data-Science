If you are not following the steps I really don’t think it is fair for you to rate the recipe. All reviews are helpful, but rating a recipe poorly after you clearly state that you didn’t follow the steps seems a little unfair.

This was excellent, ingredient-wise,  but written with far more steps than necessary. I skipped the marinating and browning steps entirely with excellent results, and just added the spices and seasonings to the liquid in which the pork was slow-cooked. I may reduce the amount of cinnamon next time I make it, though. My husband couldn't stop raving about this one!

This is a very delicious version of pulled pork . As always, I like to over do things, so I went double on everything but the rootbeer and whiskey and it was so good I wanted to jump up and slap somebody!!!

This was awesome! I had a 8lb. pork roast so I doubled the recipe. I used a spicy brown sugar BBQ sauce and it tasted superb. I made a ton to ensure that we would have plenty of leftovers. Which was not the case...we couldn't stop eating it! My husband called his mom and grandmother and bragged about it endlessly...needless to say by the time the pack off wild Bulls (our surname) was done all the meat was gone! It would have been real good with a little something to make it hotter...i'm a sucker for sweet heat! Thanks for posting this recipe! Readers, don't let the rootbeer and whiskey scare you off. It's the BOMB!

Very flavorful, but I added more liquid at the end of the slow cooker.  We like our pulled pork very moist. One of the better recipes for pork. I find most of them are either too spicy or too much like BBQ sauce

Fantastic.  Marinated a 5lb. bone in-pork shoulder in A&W Root Beer for 10 hours, applied rub, wrapped in Saran wrap for 3 hours, seared to perfection and into the crockpot on low for 7 hours. Substitued apple cider vinegar for the whiskey (didn't have any). Piled on a steamed kaiser roll with coleslaw, and I spread microwaved Sweet Baby Rays Hickory bbq sauce on the both sides of the bun like you would other condiments for your favorite burger and it was superb.  You can eat the pork like pot roast too which is why I didn't want to sauce it all up.  The next day it was great used for pork tacos, with fresh cilantro and finely diced onion on a corn pan fried corn or flour tortilla. The kids prefer flour.  Top with your favorite hot sauce and hang on as your taste buds take you for a ride. AWESOME PORK for three totally different dinners!! I might try a little liquid smoke next time as others mentioned just to see if it improves the outcome.

Wonderful recipe!  I got rave reviews from the 1st group and the left-over group.  I forgot to marinate it overnight and it still was great.  Everyone wanted the recipe and couldn't believe there was root beer in it.

perfect.  It was a bit of work but i always feel pulled pork shouldn't be 'add BBQ sauce and put in crock pot' but needs to be more authentic.  It has a lot of ingredients however that makes it more versatile because is you are missing something (i had no onion salt) you can go without or improvise.  I added reall chopped onion.  It was overall the best pulled pork i've made (and i've tried several and never felt impressed enough to comment) and worth the preparation time.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I'm not sure I will make this again.  It was a LOT of work and I'm not sure it was worth the effort.  The taste was ok but I think it could have been better.  I used Sweet Baby Rays as the BBQ sauce.  In the end the taste was just bland.  I ended up adding a little misquite flavoring, worchestershire and red hot just to try to spice it up a little.

Excellent, I changed the recipe just a bit. I didn't have ground ginger or any whiskey. Instead I added Yukon Jack, it is a Candian Whiskey 1000 Proof. Very nice taste after all. My family loved it.

I made this 2x following recipe.  I would not skip steps and really, it's not too labor intensive if you plan ahead. It's a tad too sweet for me, but my guests have loved it.  2nd time I made the day before through step 5.  After shredding the meat and reserving the juice, I put it in the fridge.  An hour before serving the next day, I put it in the slow cooker on low with reserved juice & bbq sauce.  It was just as delish and a GREAT make ahead meal for company.  Served with a buttermilk cornbread recipe from this site and homemade applesauce.

Delicious.  As other reviewers noted, many of the steps can be cut out without impacting the flavor.  I didn't marinate it overnight in root beer, just for a few hours, and then threw all the ingredients into the crockpot together.  No searing, no double-marinating with the rub...  just cooking with all those delicious spices together.  I usually pour on the barbecue sauce with pulled pork as it tends to be bland, but this one stood on its own two feet and needed no additional sauce.  So tender, juicy, and mouthwatering!

I did tweak the recipe a bit . . . but this pork was amazing.  So good on potato rolls/buns.  I made this for a family gathering and there were NO complaints!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the way the recipe is written is far more complicated than what it needs to be.  Flavor wise, this is five stars all the way! Thanks for sharing!!


Tweaks: I used Diet Dr. Pepper instead of root beer ('cuz that's what I had in the house). I didn't do all the marinading part nor the pre-browning part -- seemed too complicated, messy, and time consuming -- but just put everything together in the crock pot.  I did fork and then rub the pork with the spice mix, but then put it directly into the pot.  I didn't have any ginger, so I omitted that, but increased the dry mustard to 1 tsp, and used 1/2tsp garlic powder instead of 1/4tsp garlic salt.  And I used 2oz whiskey because I was too lazy to try to eyeball half a shot in my 1 oz shot glass. :)  I used Bull's Eye Hickory Smoke bbq sauce, and I think that hint of smoke really complimented the recipe well!  My roommate loves his food spicy hot, so he added 1/2 tsp Frank's Red Hot to his sandwich after I plated it.  He thought that made it perfect.

Hey this Is for those who want to taste the meat not the spice.....  I used 4 lb pork shoulder roast (next time I want bigger & more) turned out YUMMY great!  My husband loved it for his b-day dinner.  I too used Dr. Pepper for overnight marinade. After dry rub I didn't have time to wrap & refridge. either. While searing I made baste w/balmic dressing & tequilia in lieu of whiskey & vinegar & upped the b. sugar a little. I bbq'd on cedar planks 5 hrs. (it was 1:am put roast & baste in refridge.) Next am 11ish crooked roast on meat rack with baste in bottom for 'bout 5ish hrs. Beautiful grilled thick crust!  Removed meat, shreded (meat oh so moist inside yummm) & returned to crook w/o rack.  Added a little bbq sauce to  baste left in bottom. Couldn't keep hubby out of it so we ate it w/in 1 hr./!!

I've made this, per recipe instruction, several times and LOVE IT! The steps are not a problem at all. When I put it in the marinate, I fix a container with my spice that night so they will be ready in the morning. I try to leave it at least 1hr in the fridge with the rub on before searing and putting in the crock pot. 

I've even frozen a portion of leftovers, and it is just a good a week or 2 later.

And I agree with Ms Strayredbolt. IF you're not making it according to the recipe, you shouldn't be criticizing it! I don't see how anyone that likes pulled pork, could not like this recipe...I think it's GREAT!

Awesome pulled pork, the best I've ever had!!  The only thing I changed in the recipe is I didn't add any brown sugar to the liquid I put in the slow cooker, I found it made it too sweet the first time I made it.  But I always use brown sugar BBQ sauce to toss the meat.  Yummy :)

This recipe had a lot of steps and a lot of work compared to similar recipes I have used. It was OK, but nothing special. I found it way too sweet for my tastes.

Made this yesterday for the first time.  I like to follow recipes to the letter the first time I make them so I can figure out if I need to make any little tweaks later on if I make it again.  I was happy with the finished product.  It was tasty, so I have no complaints there.  However I did NOT like the smell while it cooked in the balsamic vinegar/rootbeer liquid for 6+ hours.

This is the first time I am rating a recipe on this site, because this was AWESOME! absolutly amazing flavors, so unbelievably tender, and just all around comfort food. I thought it was easy to make, but can understand how some felt it had too many steps. I wouldn't skip the marinating step though, I credit this for the amazing tenderness. Thanks "strayredbolt"!!!

This is fabulous pulled pork!  Moist, favorfull, just the right amount of spice.  So good!  I didn't brown the meat and did add more of the liquid back in at the end (probably more like two cups), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This is a keeper!

Yum!  The flavor was great, and it made the whole house smell fantastic!  We didn't have root beer, so substituted Dr. Pepper, but it was still wonderful.

I read other reviews for help and took some of their advice.  There are too many steps and you can jump over them and still have a wonderfull receipe. Since I don't read directions well, I patted the pork down first with the dry ingredients and then added Dr. Pepper (I had no root beer).  Covered in air tight bag for about 2-3 hours. I did not braize. I put the pork in a large slow cooker, added a little of the Dr. Pepper/dry rub mixture to it along with the added soda pop and whiskey etc,as the directions said.  After cooking 6 + hrs, I shredded, add Sweet Baby Ray's and a little of the Pepper liquid.  Let's just say I never got to taste it.  I was gone before I got out to party to eat any!

I made this for a Church Pot Luck yesterday.  I followed the recipe except I doubled the rub ingredients, because I could only find a 7 pound pork shoulder.  I was able to marinate for 7 hours only, and the rub was only on for 30 minutes before I put it in the crockpot to cook overnight.  I think it would only be better if the full marinating and rub times were follows.  But that being said, it was Awesome even with the shortened times.  I had several of the guys tell me that I could make a living 'selling that pulled pork'.  I was also told to make sure to bring it to the next potluck.
Thanks for another great "keeper" recipe.

I made this for my Memorial Day Party.  It was super delicious!  I must warn those who do not cook pork that often, that IT WILL SHRINK so DON'T FREAK OUT like I did!  This one will be the family recipe for years!  Thanks for sharing it!  No adjustments were made to this recipe.

This was delicious.
It even impressed two picky family members who have smokers and think the only "real" way to prepare this sort of dish is with a smoker. Many thumbs up.

Absolutely Fabulous! The pork was moist with just the perfect hint of sweet.  The spice blend in the rub took it to an entirely other level of wow. I followed the recipe almost exactly (I was out of balsamic vinegar so substituted with apple cider vinegar).  No BBQ sauce needed or wanted. Yum!

As anyone who's been cooking for more than their college/ first boyfriend years, I would agree that the recipe additions are excessive and that you can make do with any 3-4 picked out of the mix.  Any seasonings  you like most will work just fine, whatever you pick!

E.g., I hate vinegar and never put it into any of my 1hr/overnight marinades, and the meat still turns out amazing; you just need some sour (or oily/creamy) ingredient there.

As for browning the meat, you can do it for the crust, but no one would notice it you don't. The flavor and look would be more enjoyable I believe, but this argument is like comparing Brad Pitt to Ryan Reynolds. Both perfect. Just a bit different :)))

I loooooove pulled pork so hope this recipe will work for you w/o busting anyone's insides :)

I have made this about 10 times over the past year or two and it is delicious!  I have tried other similar but less time consuming recipes and they are not as good. This is my favorite pulled pork. It is better than any pulled pork I have ever had. Don't skip steps on this recipe.  It's worth the time.

Excellent and in my case, easy. I didn't have time to marinate and didn't see the point of browning. I was really short on time and I liked the sound of this recipe, so I took the liberty to improvise. I don't keep many dried herbs and spices on hand because I prefer fresh, so I had to make a dry rub out of what I had. Viola, Red Robin season salt had most of the ingredients that were in the rub and I wasn't looking for the the cinnamon flavor.  I used Virgil's root beer and Crown Royal, in the liquid. I had some killer BBQ sauce my brother had given us from the south, I only used about a half cup, which was plenty. (2 1/2 lb roast). We ate it for two days, and it was just as good the first day. My husband, who is a pulled pork snob, loved this recipe. Wasn't too thrilled I used his Crown Royal, until he tasted it. Making it again for Mother's Day, not sure if I will marinate or not, it was so good without the extra steps. Each to his own, and I hope I didn't insult anyone!

For an unsmoked pulled pork recipe this is fantastic.  There are a lot of steps but I don't think they are a lot of work.  You just let the thing sit in the fridge and then sit in the crockpot.  Instead of smothering the pork in store bought sauce, I strained the liquid from the crockpot and put it in the fridge overnight so the fat could rise to the top.  The next day I scraped the fat off and then put the congeled sauce in a large pan.  I added another 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1/2 cup root beer, let it come to a boil and then simmered until reduced into a thick bbq sauce (about 30 minutes).  It was fantastic and full of flavor.

Fantastic. Cooked on LOW for 8 hours. Omitted the whiskey (didnt have any)and subbed apple cider vinegar as someone else did.  PLEASE DO NOT OVER COOK the meat- it will have a somewhat chewy and coarse texture. I checked mine at 8 hours and it was SOOOO good and tender.. left it for another 2 hours... I should have turned it off at 8 hours (it was a PERFECT tenderness).. Though the texture changed a little, the taste was right on- even better 2 days later. You can eat this PLAIN (it's awesome as-is!) or try this with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, and the Sweet Restaurant Slaw recipe on this site for a mental "Rendezvous back to Memphis!!"

I made this recipe exactly as written. It sounded like a lot of instruction at first but it really couldn't have been easier. I did not need to discard any of the juice at the end and added the BBQ sauce directly in with the meat. My husband really liked this and I thought it was good but we have never had Pulled Pork before so I don't know how it rates among other recipes.

This is the best slow cooker pork recipe I've ever prepared.  The only things I changed is that I used diet root beer and I didn't brown the roast before putting it in the slow cooker.  It made the house smell wonderful - we could barely wait for dinner!

I made this today for dinner. I used much more pork than what the recipe called for and it turned out very very good. The best pork barbeque I have tasted. Root beer and whiskey made it a hit. I will definitely save this recipe. Flavor was out of this world.

Oh my gosh! This was fantastic! The only change I made was to skip all the prep work in the beginning. Added the rootbear, all the seasonings and spices (minus whiskey- none of us drink it), dropped in the meat and let it go for 6 hours. It was the best pulled pork I've ever had. My mom was begging for the recipe. If I could rate it 6/5 I would!

This was best pulled pork recipe I've ever tried. Marinated in rootbeer 24 hrs, then allowed rub to remain for 12 hrs. Prepped over several days but worth the effort! Made this for friends in Colorado during vacation and they loved it too! Will keep recipe and share many times! I added some Bourbon BBQ sauce when making up sandwiches. Excellent...

Thank you for posting this recipe.  Great flavor!  This recipe brings out pork's own flavor that gets lost if you cook your meat drowned in BBQ sauce.  I admit that I took the shortcut from other reviews.  Except for the changes below, I used all the ingredients listed.  

  - Skipped marinating, skipped rubbing
  - Browned the unseasoned roast with oil
  - Combined all ingredients in pot
  - Total brown sugar used: 1/4c
  - Total root beer used: 1-1/2c
  - Reduced cinnamon to 1/8 tsp
  - Doubled the whiskey for good measure (Took a sip)
  - No onion powder on hand... 1/2 large onion dumped in pot
  - Cooked on low for 8 hours, turning twice.

   Only added 1/2c mild BBQ sauce at the end, then served with 3 different (mild, hot, Carolina style) sauces on the side for people to choose.  Everyone had 2nds and 3rds.  Even people with their own smokers wanted the recipe.  

   Sorry to have changed the recipe, but you nailed the seasoning combination.  It really is a great, versatile recipe even for a lazy cook like me.

This recipe is divine! I received a printed copy, without realizing it was on allrecipes. I just left the paper copy in the grocery store.  Rather than trudge back to the store, I thought I would "google" the recipe and low and behold...I find the exact recipe on allrecipes.com (my favourite site for recipes). I hope someone at the store takes home the recipe and enjoys it as much as I do!

I used this recipe and doubled what it all called for to make an 8.5 lb shoulder. It was done in about 8-9 hrs. absolutely EVERYONE loved it and said my pulled pork (the first time i've ever made pulled pork) was better than most resturaunts! woohoo!! I wasnt able to let the shoulder sit in the root beer overnight, but it did sit for a good hour, and then in the rub for another 2 hours before going into the crock pot. I used an aged rum instead of whiskey because thats all i had on hand. I'm not typically a fan of pulled pork, but if i make it from now on, i see me becoming an addict!! yum!

I made this for my party. Never made pulled pork before.  I used a 10 lb pork shoulder.  It was all the rave. It cooked in seven hours. Will make this again.
A definite crowd pleaser.

Very excellent!  I replaced the whiskey with 1 tsp liquid smoke.  The balsamic vinegar is worth it (I've also made this with cider vinegar -- good, but best with balsamic).  The pre-slow cooker browning of the meat makes a difference, so don't skip that step!  I served this with Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site, and my guys loved it!

I didn't have whiskey so I used apple juice and cut out the brown sugar from the liquid mixture.  It was really really good and very juicy!

Follow the recipe exactly and it is superb! You can taste the root beer flavor until you put the BBQ sauce in them at the very end.

Very delicious..but a warning- be wary about placing this on "high" for 6-8 hours instead of medium/low for longer.  My "high" is really high and it wound up blackening all the sauce and almost burning the pork.  However, it gave the outside a nice caramelized touch!

I've made this a few times and it's excellent.  I didn't marinate or bother browning it.  Maybe that's why the root beer wasn't overpowering.  I used Stewart's root beer, and made extra mixture to add to the crock as needed. 

Sometimes I use prepared sauce, sometimes I make my own.  Either way its great.

Super recipe.  Skipped the overnight step as I didn't allow time, and it still turned out great.  Rave reviews from all who I have served it to.  The mix of spices really gives it a unique flavor.

Very flavorful, and on the sweeter side. To make it a little spicer next time I'll use spicer BBQ sauce. I served the pulled pork on kaiser roll and topped it with creamy coleslaw, so good and had an extra crunch.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful! The flavor of the pork just out of the cooker is good just as is. We like a spicy sweet barbeque sauce, so topped it with that. Thank you for a great recipe!! It's definitely going in the "make this again and again" file!

Absolutely the best!  I've become famous, in my neck of the woods, because of this pulled pork recipe. The rub, alone, is award-winning. I make my own hamburger buns to go with it and people line up for more. Thanks!

I didn't have any mustard,ginger or whisky on hand but went ahead with the rest of it. Cooked up perfect! After pulling it apart, I returned it to the crockpot and added "Mustard Based BBQ Sauce" from another recipe on site. Delicious!

This recipe has a lot of spices and seasonings but it was totally worth it. We're still working on finishing it but it will not go to waste. Lol, I ate three sandwiches yesterday! Perfect recipe for my first time doing a pork shoulder. I was not put off by all the spices that go into this as I had all of them already. I'm going to use this rub on a beef brisket just to see if it gives the beef a better  flavor than what I'm usually getting. I'm also going to double or triple the mix so I will have enough left over for something else. Have you tried making a large batch of this rub? If so did it work? Believe me folks...this recipe just looks complicated but it's absolutely going to change the way you do your pulled pork. Cheers!

End result is not worth the effort. Bland... Did not taste any root beer, whiskey, any of the 50 spices you have to put into this thing... (with the unfortunate exception of tasting a hint of nutmeg) Honestly, it didn't smell spectacular either. i would have given this a 3 since it was edible, but, it lost a star for the multiple marinade phases.  that were a complete waste of time. There are plenty of other recipes and methods that not only take less effort, but taste way better too. Every pulled pork sandwich I've ever had in my life was better than this.... And I've even had "Subways" pulled pork once lol. (store bought premade lloyds excluded... Thats just a bucket of sauce with a pork nugget in the middle...they might as well sell that  in a squeeze bottle)

I've made this several times, and it is definitely a keeper!  The first time I did all the steps, but since then I've cut out the first step of marinating overnight in root beer (but mainly because I forget and don't allow myself enough time).  But I recommend letting the roast sit for awhile with the rub and searing it before slow-cooking - the searing adds more depth to the flavor.  The past couple of times I've made it, I did not do the last step of mixing in the BBQ sauce and cooking - instead, I shred the meat and let it cook for a bit in its juices.  I've found that it really doesn't even need BBQ sauce - the meat is yummy as-is -  so I just put BBQ sauce on the table and let people add their own.

Made this today with an 8 lb Boston butt, minus the whiskey and root beer (only because I didn't have on hand)  and we used a tiny bit of our fav BBQ sauce (jack Daniels) and it was delish! My family is not into BBQ but I wanted to try something other than carnitas with an extra Boston butt I got on sale. This was great, and my 10 year old picky eater even had seconds! Next time I'll def do the root beer and whiskey for even more flavor.

I made this yesterday. I used a 4.5 pound pork shoulder (bone in) and was disappointed by the amount of meat (or lack thereof). Browning the meat beforehand will activate the flavors in the rub so would recommend not skipping that step but some work if looking for a typical easy crock pot recipe. I cooked with the fat on an is pretty gross when removing after cooking in crock pot. Are you supposed to remove beforehand?

Hi!  I just put it in my slow cooker and can't wait to try it later.  I had no whiskey and didn't marinate it because I'm making it for tonight.  I had all the other ingredients and my son was willing to donate a root beer.  Will keep you posted

I made this and it was a lot of work with the same taste as the simple version I made.  Crockpot with the meat and add about half a bottle of root beer.  by kids love it this way.

I have never tried making pulled pork. Last week was my first time. Wow! This was super delicious. I have had pulled pork a hand full of times but never liked it because there was always too much BBQ sauce. This recipe is as it says "sweet and savoury".  Follow all of the ingredients to the exact measurement. The only thing I did different was the marinating part. I let the pork sit in in the root beer over night and then it marinated with the dry rub for 3 hours.  Do this recipe, you will not be disappointed!

Super yummy pulled pork!! Excellent flavor and real tender.  I did not sear the meat and I only had regular Coke on hand instead of root beer. I also did not let the meat rest after I applied the rub-another unnecessary step. I purposely did not sear the meat because it is completely unnecessary and an extra step that will give no extra value to the final product. The reason you do not need to sear the meat is that is is being slow cooked in a slow cooker, this cooking method is a moist method.  Searing meats are beneficial to dry cooking such as roasting.  Had this recipe called for a dry roast I would have seared.  There is plenty of liquid that the pork cooks in, and searing it would just be a temporary roadblock for the liquid to penetrate the pork and keep it moist. So searing AND cooking in a slow cooker with liquid is very counter productive. I also cooked mine on low for 6 hours, then high for 3.  I think with some tweaking of the directions this recipe would be OUTSTANDING! Ill definitely make again and again, but will not follow the 2 steps mentioned above.

I have done this twice and my kids think it is like candy. My oldest has stated, he could eat this every day!
I double this recipe because it is so popular and I just add two 4 lb. shoulders. 
Do yourself a favor and do not short cut the ingredients. Even if you are concerned about the whiskey or root beer, it adds greatly to the flavor. I will probably make this another half dozen times this year due to demand!

I stayed pretty much to the recipe.  Added more Barbecue sauce than it called for (Bottle and a half of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue Sauce).  Probably one of the better pulled porks I've had.  Thinking this could be adapted to chicken, also.  Oh, and I used pork butt rather than the shoulder, so there were no bones to remove.

This is one of the best pulled pork recipes I have tried. The only thing missing is the smoke. But since I can't have a smoker, this is my go to recipe. I have tried it with scotch and bourbon, it all works well. You have a hint of the whiskey flavors, but it isn't overpowering.

Loved this recipe!! Ate it all week in sandwiches for my lunch. Next time the only thing I'd try different is using apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic (just not a big fan of balsamic is all)

This was an awesome recipe.   I always think browning the meat before putting in the crockpot make for a better flavor as you get the caramelization and the juices from deglazing.  I made a homemade BBQ sauce from scratch that included the seasonings in the dry rub.    This is a definite keeper .

Awesome! Just served this as sliders to 10 fussy eaters and they couldn't stop raving!  Soaked on Thurs, Rubbed and slowcooked on Fri, and reheated in BBQ sauce on Sat. Not a big deal. Followed the steps exactly. Very tender and delicious!

I made this recipe with a 3.5 lb pork shoulder - and I didn't sear it before putting it in the crock pot. Since I knew that I would be at work all day, instead of cooking it on high for 6 hours, I cooked it on low for about 12. Once I got home from work I flipped it and let it cook for a little longer - I kept a cup of the marinade it slow cooked in and mixed it with the shredded pork then I put the crock pot in the refrigerator and the next day I warmed it up in the crock pot for a back yard pool party. It was a hit - some ate it with barbeque sauce, some didn't. Many people said that they were impressed with the flavor. All in all - if you are looking for something different to take to your next summer pot luck - this is a great recipe.

We really enjoyed this, esp my 4 yr old.  My husband wished it had some spice toit, but he added hot sauce while eating.  I was in a hurry so I didn't brown the outside and i used boneless picnic.

The pork was tender which is the most important thing for me. however, I didn't get a burst of flavor that I wanted. I'm picky with meat. I had it sitting in the spices too for a few days, and didn't get the wow. Still it was good and I will make again.

AMAZING!! I cannot stress that enough. It is so good! I followed all the steps and stuck to the recipe except for I cut out the carbs. I used diet rootbeer and used splenda instead of sugar probably only 2T though. This is so good you don't even need the bbq sauce at the end! This is the only way I'll make pulled pork ever again.

Everyone loved this.  i used more black pepper than it called for and coke instead of root beer.  It was really good.  I didn't use the whiskey either.

This was absolutely delicious!  Not too hard to do, just had to plan ahead.  This is a company worthy dish.  I can't eat tomato products so put the BBQ sauce on the table to be added later.  On the recommendation of a friend who tried this first, a little mango jelly added to the sandwich is a great alternative to BBQ sauce.

I usually don't take the time to write reviews but I wanted to do so for this recipe.  Ok I thought the rootbeer was a little weird but have to say that this is a fantastic recipe.  I am a vegan but the only one in my household so have never tasted this but the aroma is outstanding and those I make it for have all given a thumbs up.  I haven't changed a thing.  I do compliment it with a Jim Beam barbeque sauce I make myself.  It's Super Bowl Sunday and I am off to put the pork into the slow cooker.

Very good recipe!  I marinaded the pork overnight, rubbed the spices on the meat in the morning and then added all ingredients in the slow cooker.  I cooked the meat on low for 7 hours and it fell off the bone!  I also added a touch of liquid smoke to the ingredients!  It gives it more of a smoky flavor.  I added sweet mild pepper rings to my sandwich bun and stacked the pork on top  This recipe would be good with beef if you followed all directions but layered the slow cooker with sweet onions first!

This is really good. Made it as directed except that the smallest roast I could find was 7 lbs. I ended up having to cook it almost 10 hours and used about 1.5x’s the other ingredients. I used Sweet Baby Rae’s bbq sauce original. It was good but would like to try hickory smoked sauce next time.

So yummy!  My family agrees that this is the new "go to" for sweet pork bbq.  I did not have time to marinate the meat but aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly.   Note: I feel strongly that the pork should be seared (ideally using a cast iron pan), so don't skip this step.

I made this dish for an 11:00 am tailgate party. It was a big hit and a couple requests for the recipe were requested. My preparation and ingredients included a couple shortcuts.
I used apple juice instead of root beer. The bone-in pork roast was 8.5 lbs. I did not sear the roast, rub with spices or marinate it.  All the ingredients were added to the roast in the crockpot  and cooked on low overnight. Shred and drain juices per recipe. The BBQ suaces were served on the side instead of mixed into the meat. Yum!!

Tried this for a family reunion and it was awesome! Made 2 8lb shoulders in 2 crockpots, one with bbq sauce and one without. Didn't even need 2 forks to pull apart, it just did it on it's own with 1 . As a matter of face I am making this again tomorrow and hopefully have tons of leftovers just for us!

This was the absolute best pulled pork recipe I have ever made.  I did substitute apple cider vinegar for the whiskey, but everything else remained the same.  Can't wait to make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly. The smell was balsamic vinegar for the first three hours, thereafter it wasn't too bad. The taste was odd. After all the rave reviews, I was disappointed. My children (15 and 12) didn't like it either. I will not be making again.

Waaay too sweet.  Would have had good flavor otherwise.  were I to make this again.  I would double the savory and cut back on the root beer.

I followed this recipe 100%.  It turned out absolutely beautifully!  I have to admit that it is quite honestly the best pulled pork I have ever eaten.
We served it on butter grilled buns topped with a scoop of fresh coleslaw.  Delicious and worth every step involved.

Awesome!  I made this for my Bunko group!  It was a hit.  Everyone loved it and ask for the recipe!  I served on Hawaiian rolls, with Grandma's cole slaw, pickles and chips.  
Great thing about this was all the work was done before my friends arrived and my kitchen wasn't steaming from cooking something this tasty!

This is my go to recipe for pulled pork. My wife and daughters like the sweetness of the recipe. I have done all the steps but there are times when I skip the browning stage and just throw it in the crockpot.

Did not make any changes to this sweet and savory pulled pork. Everyone enjoyed it. Served it for my Mom's 97th birthday party. Would certainly make it again.

I think stayredbolt needs to chill out. If someone changes the recipe and then rates it, they are rating the changed recipe.  I didn't do any of the marinating, didn't have rootbeer, cut the brown sugar in half, used an organic bbq sauce, used diced onions instead of onion powder,  and used bourbon for whiskey, It came out great!!! I did braise the sides of the roast for 3 minutes each to add a crispy texture and lock in flavors. After cooking initially with fat on I then pulled the fat off for a cleaner end product. The pulled pork had great flavor and texture.  I did follow the cooking instructions.

I thank stayredbolt for getting me started on the recipe but she needs to watch the Picasso series on PBS.

I used a boneless pork roast and came out real good.  You need a little more then the one cup of the liquid so save it all until you use what you think is right for moister  and it take a little more then the one cup of BBQ sauce also.. When I added the cup of each still seemed a little dry for BBQ. Also helps to add some extra salt after you shred the meat, before adding the liquid to get it into the meat. I would make it again, and it's a real good recipe for a work pot luck.

I made this today. Finished product was super! I haven't had BBQ pork in awhile and this just hit the spot!  I served with cole slaw.  The pork had a depth of flavor that was unbelievable!  I followed the recipe EXCEPT instead of root beer, I used regular beer and I had no whiskey so I skipped that.  I used Sticky Fingers BBQ sauce.  Since there are only 2 of us, I have left overs but will definitely make this again!

Made this almost exactly as written. The only thing I changed was an addition cup of liquid and BBQ sauce at the end. I started out with a 7.2 lb. pork butt and ended up with 2.5 lbs. of edible pork. I was going to smoke this for several hours before the sear and as it turn out, I didn't have to after using Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. It's plenty smokey on its own.

I love this and will make it again.

I have made this recipe twice, the first time I followed the recipe exact, the sauce was to thin making the bun soggy and the meat a bit bland. We didn't care for it. The second time I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the reserved liquid and it thickened it up and we loved it. Only thing it needed in my opinion

This is so good you don't even need bar bq sauce , My son and daughter in law love this. My son is allergic to bar bq sauce and my daughter in law doesn't like pork but this was a hit with both of them. It is the best recipe for this wonderful treat. I let mine set in the root beer for a couple of days in the fridge and than I put the spices in and let it set for at least a day in the fridge I then slow cook it and it is so tender and moist. If you like pulled pork try this recipe it's delicious .

I took most reviewers advice and just put the rub on and put it in the crockpot with the root beer mix.  It turned out great, but maybe it would have been better if I followed all the steps?

Love this recipe! Great flavor with the root beer and all the spices...yum! We made this just as it says. We used a sweet bottled sauce the first time and a more smokey sauce with a little heat to it the 2nd time. Like the 2nd one better. The recipe is sweet enough the smokey heat added just the right touch.

Amazing recipe! The flavor of the meat still shines even with copious amounts of BBQ sauce. I skipped the searing step and went straight from the marinade into the slow cooker. The results were still amazing.

after all that time and energy marinating and putting the rub to it, the flavor at the  end just came from the bottled bbq sauce.  it did boil over in my crock pot, as well.  however, it was good.  better on the second day, gone on the third day.  i was the only one eating it.

I made as directed but wasn't sure what to do with the extra rub that was too much for the pork. I left it out. Big mistake. Next time I'll add it to the liquid. It would have added to the flavor. I took others recommendations and didn't pre-sear it. Didn't think it was necessary.

I've made this many times and it's always a hit.  The spice rub is wonderful and adds great flavor (it doesn't just taste like bbq sauce ).     Like  others, I do not sear or marinate the meat.  I do leave the pork shoulder overnight in the refrigerator with the dry rub on.  I cook the pork on low for 8 hours.   It's an easy, delicious crowd pleaser.

My family loves good barbecue and we are all very picky.  We have always had barbecued beef but we have all been converted to this pulled pork recipe!  Everyone I have made this for has gone crazy about it and will still talk about it a year or two later.  It is a bit of a pain because there are so many ingredients and so many steps but it is totally worth it.  I make this just as the recipe calls for but I leave out the mustard since I am not a fan.  It is still great.

I made this exactly as written. The pork does LITERALLY fall off the bone so I ended up having to pull it in the slow cooker. Saved on washing ;) 

My husband asks for this often and brags to EVERYONE about how great it is. Making it now for my mother-in-law. Hope she is just as excited. 

My husband generally doesnt like his food sweet and he loves it so it isnt "too" sweet as others have reviewed. Yes, there are a lot of steps but nothing terrible. All the spices I already had so I really only need to buy the meat and rootbeer when I make this. 

Thank you for a great recipe!

I did not add the BBQ sauce.
I left it for each person to add as wanted.
we loved it.   a little worried the rootbeer was going to be weird but oh my stars it was wonderful.  We love use our smoker but this does not need it at all.

the first time I've  tried my new slowcooker. This pulled pork recipe was a succes!
Instead of rootbeer I used a light beer to marinate the pork in. 
And later I poured a mixture of  sugar, ginger ale and light beer over the spiced pork in the slow cooker- cooked on high for 6 hours. we don't like it too sweet, so I kept the sauce separated, to add to preference later. Love it, Thank you!

I followed this recipe exactly as written. The only exception was after using the rub on the pork, there was some leftover so i put that in the slow cooker with the root beer/vinegar mix. It came out amazing! Honestly I liked it better without the bbq sauce, so I reserved 2 cups of liquid instead of 1 and ate it like that! The bbq sauce tastes great too but this is so good it doesn't even need it!

Oh my goodness this was AMAZING. I had 10lbs of boneless pork, and I had to expedite it a bit due to time constraints. So I marinaded it in the root beer for about 2 hours, then in the rub for about a half hour. Also, not sure if it was because it was boneless, but I put it in the crock on LOW overnight, and in the morning it was falling apart! Absolutely to die for. Everyone was raving about it for days. DEFINITELY a keeper! Thank you!!

Five stars isn't good enough for this recipe!  I made it according to directions except it marinated in the spices overnight rather than two hours and used less barbecue sauce than called for.  It was so good I hated to put barbecue sauce in it.  Made it for a block party.  The crock pot was empty at the end and 3 people went out of their way to tell me how good it was!  I was going to let it cook for 8 hours but I tried it at the end of 6 hours and it was already falling off the bone.  Make this, you can't go wrong.

I accidentally added the bbq sauce for the cook process and it was pretty tasty and then add sauce to taste before serving

Just made this for a department baby shower and it was a hit.  I didn't have root beer to make the initial marinade, so used Dr. Pepper.  The only ingredient left out was the celery salt and I substituted garlic powder for garlic salt.  I served it with hawaiian rolls, pickles and two barbecue sauce options on the side.

I followed the directions exactly...marinating in root beer, rubbing with spices, etc..... except for browning the meat before putting in the slow cooker.  Seven hours in my vintage slow cooker produced the MOST savory pulled pork.  I will definitely do this again!!  I'd give it SIX stars if I could.

I followed the directions as written except that I didn't sear the meat before putting in the slow cooker (mostly because I just forgot).  Everyone really liked this "less porky more sweet bbq"  pulled pork, but not as much as my usual recipe.

Made it tonight for dinner. I marinated it in A&W overnight (actually closer to 10 hours). Made the rub-did not have the mustard, celery salt, or onion powder so I added garlic powder-had everything else-left the rub on for an hour. I did not sear it as I was running short on time-I have problems with timing when cooking. Put the 4 pound pork tenderloin in the crock pot for 6 hours on high. I did mix the bbq sauce with 1 3/4 cups of liquid (rather than the called for 1 cup) as I like a moist bbq and was worried that b/c I had the tenderloin (which is more lean than the boston butt) that it might dry out when I stored it in the frig. It was almost too moist-so next time I will sear the meat and use less liquid (but I'll keep the extra just in case)! Great flavor-I'll be eating this for days.....unless my co-workers are lucky and I take some in tomorrow!

So although I did not marinate this over night and skipped the browning step ( I am pretty lazy but really liked the concept of this pulled pork) this turned out fantastic. One of my favorite recipes. The only changes I made ingredient wise was used Dr. Pepper instead of Root beer  because of preference but I doubled the recipe (had a 10lb roast) and I cooked it on low for about 15 hours. It was incredible I imagine it would be just as amazing if you followed this too a T but  even with my changes It was so good.

The meat was so good I ate it without the BBQ sauce!  The fact that there is no chopping makes this recipe pretty simple,  actually  (I disagree that it's too much work ).  I have a toddler, so I prepared the rub mixture the night before as well to minimize the work during the day.

I was a little let down by the lack of flavor the pork had. I added my favorite barbecue sauce on top of it when serving.

I made this recipe for a Super Bowl Party and it was a big hit!  I follow it  exactly but served some without barbecue sauce.  I probably will save a little more of the reserved liquid to maintain moisture in the slow cooker while it is on warm  for serving.  This will definitely be my go to recipe for the future!

I had a 4.09q lb pork butt that i used. I marinated it overnight, brined it for about 13 hours (because of my work schedule), and then i had it in the slow cooker for 7 hours and it is amazing. I've been looking for a pulled pork recipe that has less barbeque sauce (i know, kind of silly), and I found one that exceeded my expectations. It is moist, flavorful and rather addictive. 

There are a few more steps than other pulled pork recipes, but don't knock it til you try it. In my opinion, it's worth the work,  and they're not even tedious or time consuming steps, which is nice. 

I would recommend this to anyone who is interested; it is very much so a keeper in my book.

This was an amazingly delicious recipe!  The prep and waiting time was well worth the outcome for sure!  I am on shift work, so I let the roast marinate in the root beer for about 18 hours before I cooked it.  I couldn't find any small bottles (1 oz) of whiskey (I don't drink) so I didn't add that to the recipe.  Let me tell you, this was one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had.  I will probably make this every other month, if not more frequent!

I love this recipe and have made it dozens of times, all to rave reviews. Other than leaving out the whiskey for my teetotaler family, I don't change the ingredients... I've never felt the need to, because it's delicious as is. The first time I made it, I did the marinating and braising steps. The second time, I was short on time and just rubbed the spices on and threw it in the crockpot. I couldn't tell the difference, so I've never done the marinating and braising since.  I highly recommend trying this "as is" first before tweaking it, because otherwise you may miss out on what makes this recipe so special.

The only recommendation I would add is to save the juices if you plan on refrigerating for later; that way you have some to add for moisture. Otherwise this is an awesome recipe!

Ok after reading the reviews I had mixed emotions on weather to skip a step. The only thing I did skip was the step you rib it down and refridgerate, I rubbed it down and went to the next step with out the 20 min in the fridge. I think the reason some said it was not as good is those spices are what make it taste so good. My family loved it, I used exactly what it called for minus the whiskey. (only because I don't drink) But it was amazing, so tender and juicy, thankyou for the recipe.

I have tried this recipe twice (today was the second time). I really liked it a lot. The only thing I changed was that I doubled the dry rub because (to me) it didn't have quite enough salt with the amount called for in the recipe. Overall, I think this is about as good as any bbq I have ever had and I have had some really good bbq.

Easily the best pork I've ever tasted.  I feel bad for those who skipped the searing step... it sealed in the rub and added so much to the flavor.  Yes, there's a reason why it's in there!  Delicious!!!!

I followed the recipe almost exactly but didn't have any whiskey so that's the only part that got left out.  It was a little too sweet for my taste so next time I'll cut back on the sugar a bit.

I have used this recipe many times in my catering business simply eliminating the whiskey and adding a small secret spice so I can call it my own. Thank you for the start of a popular dish with my business.

Turned out delicious!! We served it at a Christmas potluck dinner and it was a fav.  At first looking at the recipe, it seemed overwhelming but it was actually quite easy to follow once started.  We ended up doubling the recipe and used an 11.5 lb pork shoulder (its all the store carried) but it was perfect.  For about 30 people, we maybe had 4 servings left.

This turned out so delicious and tender, highly recommend! The only modification I made was a boneless pork shoulder trimmed and tied for even cooking.  I cooked it for 6 hours, it was 4.3 lbs without the bone.  Yummy!

WOW !!!  This was really good.  I used Dr Pepper (cause that's what the neighbor had - we don't drink soda) didn't used whiskey (used small amount of apple juice in place) and didn't get the chance to let roast sit w/ the dry rub on it - a time issue. So good - for those of you that skip the searing part - don't, it carmelizes the brown sugar mixture and gives it such a great flavor, cant express enough I think it truly adds to the flavor in the meat.  So yummy really doesn't need the bbq sauce (made some homemade too).  Made some fried rice to accompany - excellent Sunday Football meal ! and the Patriots won - great food great win great Sunday !!!

I tries this recipe for the first time back in early 2012. I have made it probably 7 or 8 times since then and it always turns out amazing! I always follow the directions exactly and I swear its the best pulled pork EVER! There's been 2 times that I didn't have whiskey in the house so I didn't use it those times, but it tasted the same without it. Thanks for the recipe that I will foreer keep in my house!

This was absolutely, hands down, amazing.  It IS a lot of work, don't be surprised, but it was worth it.  I followed each step exactly, with only two minor deviations.  I prepared the shoulder the night before, by following steps 1,2,3,and half of 5.  I put the shoulder in the crockpot in the fridge overnight, and mixed the liquid and poured over in the morning when I turned the crockpot on, and I set it to low, since I knew I would be out of the house for 12 hours.  I made the mistake of discarding the fat/skin layer, I should have shreded it with the meat.  That's the only thing I can think of that would have made this dish better!  Not to sweet, which is what I was afraid of, and not vinegary, like most bbq recipes.  I used Kraft Honey Hickory smoked BBQ sauce, and it was fantastic.  The other half added more to his sandwiches, but I enjoyed it as is.  It's a new family favorite.

I followed this exactly up to the part for the sauce going into the crockpot. Boyfriend had drank the rest of the root beer! Diet dr pepper was the closest alternative available, and everything went smoothly from there. The meat was so incredibly tender and flavorful without being really saucy. Great recipe!

I was not fond of this recipe. I did not like the root beer flavor.  It gave the dish an off flavor.  Also, Overall this is a lot of sugar.

Well, I haven't actually cooked it yet, but I just wanted to say the spice rub is glorious! I actually put the spice rub recipe in my 'special' cookbook that I reserve for my children when they grow up. All my favorite recipes go into it, and that says something because I'm a serious foodie! Will post my opinion of the end result.

This recipe was awesome.  I followed it exactly.  I used a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce, to finish it, but it was delicious without it.  Next time, I might take some out to use with the sauce it makes, just put the sauce in the fridge, and when it's cold, scoop out the fat accumulated on top.  That way, I can have barbecued pulled pork and  also, make something entirely different with the original sauce and plain pulled pork.  Great spice rub!  Thank you!

I took the advice of a previous reviewer and skipped the prep steps, just dumping all the ingredients in my slow cooker with wonderful results - it makes the house smell wonderful and my husband couldn't believe it had root beer in it!

To serve, I bought a long baguette, cut it into 6" sections, cut them open and toasted them for open-faced grinders.  Pile the pork on and top with kale sauteed in a bit of garlic, a drizzle of apple butter, with sweet potato fries on the side.  Made for a great remake of an amazing grinder we had at a local Chicago tap house.

Thanks!

Great recipe!  I needed to make pulled pork, but one of our guests had a SERIOUS aversion to barbecue sauce.  But I found this recipe, and I didn't need a drop of sauce.  Very flavorful!
