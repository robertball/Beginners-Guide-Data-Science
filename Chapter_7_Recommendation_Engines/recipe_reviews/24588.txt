I only used one tsp of lemon juice and I am glad I did.  This was good, but I like some other dips better.

This veggie dip is awesome!  You have to let it sit for several hours to let the flavors blend as the recipe calls for.  The kids even ate their raw veggies "all gone"!  Try It! YUMMY!

I did not add the extra salt. I thought this was okay but my family did not. Next time, I'd cut back on the lemon juice and maybe use something besides curry powder. I don't know if I cared for the combination of the italian dressing and the curry powder. I don't know if the longer that this sits that it gets better but this sat all day and it tasted just.....off. I'm sorry, this dip wasn't for me or my family.

This is one of my favorite dip recipes! Letting it sit overnight really enhances the flavor. I added small chopped fresh white onions, since the first time i made it i didn't have the dried onion flakes. This is a great dip!

Very good. I took others' advice and used less lemon. I also added chives in place of onion flakes and some minced garlic for kick. Very good with my veggie tray!

This did not turn out well at all.  I followed the recipe exactly, but came up with a mixture of flavors that did not mesh what so ever.

Loved this!  I was looking for a veggie dip using ingredients I knew I had available at home, this one fit the bill.  I did decrease the amount of lemon juice to 1 teaspoon.  Otherwise, I left the rest the same.

I tried adding a cup of low fat yogert instead of mayo...and it did not work out. Also, I had to add more spices because it was a bit bland...

I made this dip last night on the fly.  I had all the ingredients except for the curry powder.  It was delish.  Easy to make with on hand ingredients.  I only let it rest, gel, sit in the fridge until I got my veggies cut up so I'm anxious to taste it today.  I think the flavor might be even better after sitting in the fridge.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was a very tasty dip and my guests enjoyed it as well.  I used equal parts mayo and sour cream because I like the sour cream taste.  I also was out of curry powder so I just used the entire package of Italian dressing mix.  Great snack for watching tv or just munching.  I'll definitely make this again.  Most ingredients are always on hand and it's quick and easy to make.

Out of deference to several friends' diets, I made this with reduced fat mayo.  It seemed to change the consistency a bit. I think it would have been better with regular mayo.

Used for a big platter of veggies, including daikon, at my daughter's 19th birthday party, along with lots of potstickers, teriyaki chicken, edamame, and pineapple.  The kids ate everything in sight!  Added at least 2x more curry, just right!

Good, easy to make.  I had all the ingredients at home - so no need to run to the store!  The only thing I did diffrent was to double the itailan salad dressing mix (after reading other users comments).  I brought this to a baby shower and there were no leftovers!

Even though there's not much curry in this recipe, that's all I could taste in the dip. It was just okay, and my guests didn't seem to care for it much.

It had souch a small amount of dressing and curry for such a large amount of mayo and sour cream!  I would recommend at least doubling one of the two ingredients (not both, like I did), depending upon who's eating it--most people would probably prefer the italian dressing mix to the curry.

The dip was okay.  I would skip the curry powder next time, it doesn't make sense to me flavor wise.  Served with zucchini and summer squash sticks, baby carrots, and green pepper slices.

I had to use extra sour cream to tone down the mayo taste, but it was overall very good. There were many compliments on this dip from the party I took it to.

Very yummy!  I used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream to shave a few calories & it still tastes wonderful!!

Absolutely delicious.  I discovered (too late) that I was out of curry powder, so I put in dashes of cumin, cayenne, and mustard powder and it seemed to do the trick.  This is a great variation from typical ranch or french onion dips - it's just the right blend of creamy, tart, and savory flavors.

This dip was better than I expected! I am bored of the usual ranch variety. This was very tasty, very original! Will definitely make it again.

I simplified this recipe and it was delicious!  I used 3/4c mayo, 1/4c sour cream, and 'Garlic & Herb' salad dressing mix to taste (I eyeballed it, but it was maybe 1/2t or so)  It was really tasty and really simple.

Once I added more of all the seasonings to taste, it was great.  The original recipe was too bland.  It was a nice change from the standard dry ranch dressing mixed with sour cream.  Yummy :-)
