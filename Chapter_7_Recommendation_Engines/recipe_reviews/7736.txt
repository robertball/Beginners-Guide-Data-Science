I am a pastry chef, and this is the only chocolate cake that I will make from now on.  I separated the eggs and whipped the whites separately with some of the sugar, then folded it all together to make is extra airy.  This recipe could easily be flavored with coffee, juice, or buttermilk in place of the water. FANTASTIC!

My Mum and I found this recipe and decided to use it for my Sisters wedding cake.  It was perfect!  Everyone loved it.  We made 3 tiers.  The bottom tier was 2 batches (we made them seperately and cooked them together, I don't think it would work if you doubled it)  It was huge and took 2 hours to cook.  The 2nd tier was 1 batch.  We made the top layer carrot.  It was iced with white chocolate truffle icing and it was just amazing. I'm going to put a photo of it on this site.

This recipe makes a very pure, clean-tasting chocolate cake with a fine crumb and a texture that can be moist or dry depending on how long you bake it and how long you let it air-dry. I followed other reviewer's suggestions: substituting butter-flavor Crisco for butter; creaming with the sugar for over 2 minutes; and baking in a single 10-inch springform Bundt pan. It came out quite well on the first try.

I also tried whipping the egg whites separately, but that made little difference, as this is a pretty solid, moderately dense cake, so I wouldn't bother with that in the future.

The flavor is such a pure, moderate chocolate cake that it would be perfect as a base for a wide range of desserts using added flavors. Vanilla whipped cream would be a great accompaniment. Unaccompanied, it's nice but a little too plain.

Caution: grease the pan quite well, as the cake is clingy when hot and you don't want to tear it.

I get tired of my usual choc. cake recipes so am always looking for something new.  This is a very good cake.  I made it in a 12 cup bundt pan but other than that followed the recipe exactly and found it to be sweet enough with a good chocolate flavor and I had no problem with the cake falling apart. For those who thought it was dry:  make sure the cocoa-boiling water mixture has cooled thoroughly before proceeding with the recipe otherwise the cake may turn out heavy and dry.

I have made this cake recipe for every family birthday for the last 4 or 5 years.  I have 4 children, so I know this recipe off by heart now!  It is a little crumbly, but I make it the day before and put it in the fridge.  This seams to change it into a very moist cake.  I consider this a good thing, because then I always have the cake ready ahead of time. It does stick in your pans terribly, so be sure to line your pans with baking paper (or parchment) and not just butter or butter and flour them.  This is a really delicious cake.  I would make something different for each birthday, but my husband and kids ask for this chocolate cake every time.  Now if they would only learn the recipe and make it on my birthday.....ha ha.

Thanks so much for the recipe!  I've made this cake twice to rave reviews.  I almost didn't try it because of the warnings about its dryness from other users.  If you are getting a dry cake from this recipe, I believe it could be a technical issue.  Insufficient creaming of the butter and sugar could cause the cake to be dry.  I allow at least 2 minutes of moderate-speed blending.  I also used butter-flavored Crisco (1c butter = 1c Crisco + 6t water), which can also make it moister.  You could also be overbaking, either by giving it too much time in the oven or by having an oven that's too hot.  If you enjoy baking, do yourself a favor and invest $6.00 in an oven thermometer.  You won't regret it!

Quite disappointing after all the excellent reviews.  Like many, I've been searching for 'the' chocolate cake recipe and this is not it.  I'm going to stick to oil as my search continues -- the butter-based chocolate cake recipes I've tried resulted to rubbery textures, and oil-based ones consistently give better results. (If anyone knows the explanation, or better yet the solution, to this, it will be much appreciated!)

One of the few chocolate cake recipes truely from scratch. Thank you. I used strong coffee instead of water. Topped it with cream cheese frosting (8 oz + 1 c powdered sugar, milk and Vanilla). Very good. Made it in a 9 x 13, baked it for about 35 minutes. It was a very thick cake, but not too dense and went over very well. Not as chocolate as I would have hoped for tho but a nice alternative from scratch.

Some cakes, like the Black Magic Cake or the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III, are VERY moist, and have a relatively dense, compact crumb. This cake, being a butter cake, (meaning that the fat and sugar are creamed together to incorporate air), is light, tender and fluffy. Neither type is better than the other, it's either a matter of personal preference or what you want for a particular project. As a butter cake, this recipe is very good, and I know it wil improve by the following day. I halved the recipe, which yielded 12 cupcakes and one small loaf cake. Other than using freshly brewed coffee for the water, I followed the recipe as written and was quite satisfied with it.

I made this cake for the first time yesterday and it came out really moist and delicious. I used coffee instead of water as suggested and I cooked the cake in 2 pans and cut each cake into 2 layers. I used whipped ganache with rum as filling and i decorated the cake with fresh berries. It was a huge success!

Moist and elegant, yet a bit homey! A winning combination. I made no alterations, none were needed! Here IS a tip, though: Use a simple frosting. The cake is rich enough by its self. I used a mocha frosting. Delicious, if you don't mind the fact you proably won't be able to hold down a big piece!

Here are a few tips that you can apply to most cakes.  1) Grease your pans and then line with parchment paper, grease parchment paper 2) Use 1 cup coffee and 1 cup milk 3) You don't have to sift the dry ingredients, just take a whisk after you combine them and whisk well 4) Use a LARGE Tablespoon of Mayo when you add the eggs 5) Add 1 Tablespoon vegetable oil with eggs 6) Replace vanilla extract with vanilla bean paste 7) Replace all-purpose flour with cake flour  Also, if you plan on frosting this, let the cake cool completely.  Cover with plastic wrap (make sure no cake is exposed to air), then stick in the freezer over night.  Take it out and put it on your cake board pulling off the parchment paper ONLY when you are ready to add the next layer..this will keep your cake from falling apart on you.  "Crumb" coat it with a thin layer of frosting and stick in the fridge to harden up.  This will prevent crumbs from getting into decorating frosting.  Hope this helps!  This will add moistness for those of you who were finding this cake to be dry!

Wow Wow!!  This cake is awesome!  I bake just about every day and have tried dozens of chocolate cake recipes.  This cake is easy to put together, has deep chocolate flavor, is moist and is just sweet enough.  The recipe calls for 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder.  I used about 1/2 cup regular unsweetened cocoa powder and the other 1/2 cup was King Arthur Flours BLACK cocoa powder which is just about black in color and is SUPER dark chocolate.  As you can see from my photo - my cake is VERY dark chocolate.  I can't believe some folks say theirs is dry - mine is very moist and fine crumbed.  I used my 3 layers for a tuxedo cake. Filled and frosted with the white marshmallowy type of frosting and then spread chocolate glaze on top and down the sides.  It's honestly one of the best cakes I've ever made.  Completely delicious.  This recipe fills 3 pans nicely.  The cake does not dome very much and upon cooling - actually flattens out. I recommend this recipe.  Superb and easy.

Some reviewers found this dry, but mine turned out really moist. I used half coffee and half plain boiled water, because I was afraid the taste would be too strong for kids if I used two whole cups of coffee. This was perfect. I used a dark chocolate glaze on top, and it was so delicious!

Excellent chocolate cake! Very chocolatey and moist and not overly sweet which makes it great for frosting and filling!  I made this cake for my husband’s birthday and he said it was the best chocolate cake he’s ever had.  I made a semi-sweet chocolate mousse for the filling and covered the whole thing with a bittersweet ganache. The only thing I did different from the recipe was dividing it into two cakes so I would have two thick layers and with a little extra cooking time they turned out beautifully.  I used greased parchment paper on the bottom of my pans and the cakes came right out without a problem.  I will be using this cake recipe for years to come! UPDATE: I made it this year with peanut butter mousse(Melt 1cup pb chips with 1/2 cup cream, add 1 tsp vanilla and 2 Tbsp pb. Beat 1+ 1/4cup cream with 2 Tbsp sugar until very stiff.  Fold everything together (I added extra pb chips too) Put in between layers, chill overnight. Frost as usual.  To DIE for!

I tried a half dozen chocolate recipes before this, and none after. I use this recipe for cupcakes, and people will pay whatever I ask for them!  

Everyone who rates this recipe poorly has done something wrong. Ive made this cake at least a dozen times in the last 6 months, and I've found temperature is key. Keeping the butter on the cool side, not warm will thicken the batter and make it fluffier in the end, reducing cooking time. Mixing the cocoa with water to disolve, and then allowing to cool while you do the rest helps too.  Light brown, fluffy batter Used for cupcakes will take about 14-15 minutes. Darker brown, runnier batter will take closer to 17-19 minutes.  I measure my cupcakes with a 1/4 cup measuring cup and get about 30-32 cupcakes from a full recipe. So beware! It makes a ton!

Combined with a cream cheese, whipping cream frosting flavored with cocoa and coffee or cherry jam, this is a sure thing. It's a good thing it makes so much, you'll need extras!

This is absolutely the best chocolate cake ever. If you follow the directions it is fool proof.  My customers devour it every time I make it. I make it with a White Chocolate Butter Cream Icing and it is the perfect mixture.
Icing: One cup of butter (cold)
approximately a half of bag of white chocolate melted in 2 (tbls)of whipping cream,beat together.Add 1 teaspoon vanilla, 2 1/2 cups of powder sugar or enough until thick.

This was the first cake I have ever made and it came out great!  I used cake flour instead of regular flour and unsweetend Hershey's chocolate bar instead of cocoa.  I used this as the base for Chocolate Torte on this site.  Next time I will be sure to let the cake cool completely before starting to assemble it. I thought it was cool - turns out it was on the outside I don't think it was cooled all the way through.

What a delicious cake!  It's my first time baking a cake from scratch and I was a little intimidated, but was worried for nothing.  It was an easy recipe to follow and the only thing I cut down was the sugar (only used 2 cups vs 2 1/4 cups).  I also poured the entire batter into a bunt cake pan instead of 3 cake round cake pans.  I baked it for 55 minutes on 350 and it turned out perfect.  It was really moist and since the recipe didn't include a frosting recipe, I just paired the cake with store bought whipped cream.  A nice lite addition for the moist cake.  Unlike the other reviews, I had no issues with the cake sticking to the pan.  All I did was spray the bunt cake pan with some baking spray.

I took the reviews into consideration when I made this cake, especially since I've had a hard time finding a really good chocolate cake.  I scaled the recipe to 1.5x (18 servings instead of 12) and baked in two 10" pans @ 300F for 40 minutes (rotating halfway through).  Once stacked, these two 10" layers ended up becoming a cake a little more than 2.5" high.  If torted and filled, the cake would probably be 3" high.  I replaced 2/3 of the water with milk and used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa.  It's important to let the boiled cocoa cool down to get the right texture.  Also, I beat the butter/sugar for 5 minutes to make an airy cake.  The final product was perfect for me.  It was NOT overly sweet (after I reduced the sugar by 20%) which is great since I wanted to cover in ganache and fondant.  I also filled with thinned strawberry preserves.  Oh yeah, since everyone was talking about these cakes falling apart, I generously sprayed nonstick spray into the pans and let them cool in the pan for ~30 minutes before moving them.     UPDATE:   I saved the cake scraps and turns out the cake actually got sweeter the next day.  I don't know if everyone else had this same experience, but I will make note of this next time.  Absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever had!

Okay! Here's my scoop on this cake!
  I read the reviews on this cake and as most, I tweeked it to my liking. I made the cake as directed and as some others did, I whipped the whites and then folded them in at the end. I used hot 4% milk instead of water. I baked it for 30 minutes as directed. After the cake cooled I filled it with a pack and a half of softened creem cheese and about a cup of strawberry preserves mixed. You can add or take away the strawberry preserves to taste. After I added the strawberry filling a covered it and chilled it until it cooled and the filling was firm. Then I topped it with the "One minute icing" recipe on this site. I wanted to use a chocolate ganache but I didn't have heavy cream, so I oppted for is icing but I didn't whip it. Instead, I cooked it as directed and then let it cool for about 5 minutes and poured it on top. This not only is a beautiful cake but it is very delicious and it has just the right balance of sweetness. I can't wait to make this for company. I use my neighbors as my taste testers on a daily basis for so many kinds of foods and they said it was very good and beautiful!!! A KEEPER!!!

i used margarine, but it came out fine. and halved the recipe and still ended with two not-too-thin 9 inch cakes. filled it with whipped chocolate ganache and frosted it with a mint frosting. yum.

my cake decorating teacher liked it!

I just made this cake & it's absolutely delicious! It has a very fine crumb, which is perfect as I am going to use it tomorrow to make a batch of cake pops. I noticed that some people changed the recipe, thought that the butter made it rubbery, etc. I made the recipe "as is" but I changed the servings from 12 to 9. I think that creaming the sugar & butter REALLY well made a hug difference in the end product. Also, when alternating the flour & cocoa mixture, start with the flour and end with the flour. I baked the 9 serving recipe in a metal 9 x 13 pan (buttered with the wrappers from my butter sticks - no sticking problems) for 30 minutes. This is my new go-to chocolate cake recipe!

I made this cake for a birthday party and although it does taste very yummy, it is a cake decorators nightmare! The cake itself is VERY soft and CRUMBLY!  If you want a yummy cake to enjoy at home, make this one, but if you are looking to stack and decorate, NO WAY!

WOW!!! I halved this recipe because I was making a 6 inch round layered cake.  For frosting I mixed 1/4 c. softened butter with 1 1/2 - 2 cups powdered sugar, about 1/4 cup Bailey's, and a tiny bit of milk as needed to get the right consistency.  POW what a great combination!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitely the greatest cake I've ever made, and I've made quite a few :)

Perfect!  I heard that it turns out more moist when crisco is used.  So I used 1 cup of butter flavored Crisco plus 6 Tbsp of water in place of butter.  It turned out so moist and yummy!  Also, I read comments that the cake stuck to the pan really bad.  I made cupcakes with this recipe using the paper liners sprayed with cooking spray.  They didn't stick at all.  This made 36 regular sized cupcakes.  I used the muffin pan of 12 count, and baked at 22 minutes.

This recipe is great, I now use it everytime I make chocolate cake, the only thing I added was a half cup of sour cream, it turns out incredibly moist each time I make it.

Amazing cake!  I made a few changes due to personal preference.  First, I used cake flour rather than all purpose flour, margarine in place of butter, and added two teaspoons of International House suisse mocha drink mix.  I also beat the egg white separately until it started to form peaks, though not to the point that it was as stiff as meringue and added to the batter just before pouring into the pan.  I made a single bunt cake rather than three round and had to bake it an additional twenty-five minutes.  There was just a little too much batter for the bunt pan and I had to remove about an inch off the top when it was finished before turning it over.  This is the best chocolate scratch cake I have ever had.  It has just the right amount of chocolate flavor and is irresistably moist; so much better than box mix.

I used Ghiradelli cocoa powder.  The quality really does make a difference.  If your cake tastes bland, it may be the type of cocoa.  The cake was moist and had a great flavor, but it was a little challenging to handle.  It is delicate (light & airy) so taking it out of the pan and cutting it into 4 thin layers was difficult.  To avoid losing the bottom half in the pan, butter and flour pan well, use parchment if possible, allow cake to cool slightly before removing, and be gentle.

I chose this recipe pretty much at random because I wanted to make good cupcakes, and this recipe is reviewed well. And these are  good cupcakes! I cut down on the baking soda (I don't like the taste) and upped the baking powder to compensate. They turned out lovely and fluffy and oh-so-moist. I also cut down a bit on the sugar, because I was going to ice them, and tend to like bittersweet chocolate anyway. Careful, though: this recipe makes 36 decent sized cupcakes. I topped them with a simple vanilla icing, and dipped the tips in rainbow chocolate sprinkles (just for fun). They turned out fantastic. I only have one problem now: What the heck am I going to do with thirty six cupcakes? Party at my place!

i've been making this cake since 2006. the first couple times i followed it exactly. 
then..
i got lazy about boiling the water and instead i added the cocoa powder to the flour (sifted it all together of course) and used milk instead of water.
wow! moist and yummy!

I have made this recipe twice now and both times it has come out perfect. First time I baked in a bundt pan the second time was in a large square pan. I followed the directions to a T. Cake was super moist and to die for. I made sure that the cocoa and boiling water mixture was completely cooled before I started to incorporate it with the flour. Both times I made it for friends parties and everyone loved it! Tastes really good with cream cheese icing. This is my permanent chocolate cake recipe!

Perfect recipe, I made it exactly as the recipe follows. I was able to bake a 9X13 and a square 8X8 cake from the batter. I made the chocolate ganache icing for the larger cake and I dusted the other with powdered sugar, tastes just like this cake that I buy for $6.00 a slice at a nearby chocolatier.

I've made this recipe twice, once i halved it and made it in a bundt pan, and the other time i added mini chocolate chips and made cupcakes. Both times they came out beautifully. I don't know what other people are talking about, it being too dry. My cake/cupcakes came out deliciously moist. So if you follow the recipe exactly like I did, you should have a georgous result.

I have never been able to find the perfect chocolate cake recipe. I love a moist, rich, melt-in-your-mouth chocolate cake and other recipes always tend to be on the dry side. I tried this recipe yesterday out of desperation after another recipe I tried turned out disastrous and it was for my daughter's 10th birthday. For extra chocolatey taste I added 1/2 cup Hershey Chocolate Flavour syrup to the batter, baked in a 9x13 pan for about 50-55 minutes and hoped for the best. Well the cake sold out in seconds! I got to taste the crumbs and I must say I will definitely try this recipe again. It was the BEST!!! Everyone loved it.

I found this to be VERY DRY.  I greased some small heart shaped cake pans and baked them. When I couldn't get them out of the pan, they broke up, and I tasted one. It was incredibly dry.  So, I added some applesauce to the rest of the batter and baked that. That was the only thing that saved this cake.  Sorry, but I won't make this ever again.

FABULOUS!!  This cake is moist and rich.  Very chocolately, but not super-sweet.  My boyfriend & I love it, and we just made it for a big family dinner and everyone raved about it.  We don't ice the cake - we just spread seedless raspberry jam between the layers, and garnish with a bit of whipped cream and some fresh raspberries.  Perfect dessert!  We'll definitely make it again!

Oh...my...god...is all I can think of to say. That was the best cake I have ever tasted. If you make it with the Chocolate Frosting I (on this website), you will really, truly, honestly, think you have died and gone to heaven. I swear. Except, here's a tip for the people who decide to make the Chocolate Frosting I, you have to double the recipe for frosting! But oh...my...god, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE! IT IS TO die FOR!!! *dies on the spot* =P

I edited this recipe just a little. Made it in 13*9 added one cup of chocolate morsals. I frosted with cream cheese frosting and shaved coffee flavored chocolate on the top. Increase the baking time by 5-10 minutes as needed. Smelled so good I could not get a picture before the office guys tore into it!

Good cake.  I had to bake it in a 9x13 pan, which made it a little too dense.  I frosted with peanut butter icing.

This was super. Very easy and was nice and moist dark chocolate but still had a nice fluffy texture.  I made a White Chocolate Mousse frosting and served it with a raspberry sauce over the slices.  I also made it again with a regular chocolate buttercream.  This is a keeper.  Very easy to dress up or just serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and its a hit.

THE BEST and easiest "from scratch" chocolate cake recipe ever. Also makes yummy cupcakes! Just bake for about 20-22 min instead, till a toothpick comes out clean. Top with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" by Janni. Yummy Chocolatinessssssss.

I made this cake 2 weeks ago. I am a pretty good baker. I've been lucky enough to spent time in France AND learn a few things. Still, I could not make a decent chocolate cake until now. We just had the last piece and it was just as moist as the 1st day. It was very well covered. My advice is use the best chocolate you can get your hands on, melt the bars well into the boiling water. The better the chocolate and vanilla, the better the cake. Do not add the vanilla into the hot water, mix it with the eggs and then add it to the wet ingredients. Makes great muffins and cupcakes for bake sales too

Lovely tasting cake, I've made it twice already in the same week.  First time I used the three pans as suggested and everything was right on the mark.  The second time I decided to use a bundt pan but I wasn't prepared for the amount of baking time.  Jeez Louise, it seemed like 2 hours before that thing was done.  It still came out alright but a little too moist for me (how did THAT happen?).  Nice recipe, I like it alot and it went over very well with the fam and friends.  Thanks, Carol.

Very good and rich chocolate cake! Great chocolate flavor, wonderful airy, light texture... I added a couple of things to my second batch to spice it up a notch; 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 package of chocolate pudding. It turned out phenomenal! Also, you can easily halve this recipe with no problem if you don't need to make that much cake. All in all, excellent scratch-cake recipe!

A wonderful cake. Made it for a friends birthday and she loved it. I filled two 8" cake pans and used the left over batter for muffins. When the cakes had cooled, I stacked them with a raspberry filling of 8 oz fresh raspberries and 6 Tbs raspberry preserves. I also made a double recipe for Buttercream Icing (By Sharon Gerstman) with vanilla bourbon since I ran out of vanilla extract. The cake looked so professional and it tasted amazing.

I made this as cupcakes and I used freshly brewed coffee instead of water, and i seperated the eggs and brought the whites to a stiff peak before folding them in at the end, and oh my lord these cupcakes are incredible. I changed it to 15 servings and got 3 dozen cupcakes. I filled them to almost the top and they have perfect little domes. I baked them at 180C for 20 min. make sure you have some milk in the house!

This is a great recipe, but if you're a beginning cook, be careful not to overbeat the batter. Overbeating makes the texture of the cake drier which is far more noticeable in a dark chocolate flavored recipe. Greasing and flouring the cake pan, as well as removing the cake from the pan before it fully cools, will prevent tearing when removing the cake.

OH MY GOSH! I made this for my cousins birthday and it was AMAZING! I was very surprised with this. I did have to cook the cake for about 1 hr, which isn't what the recipe stated. Also, remember to grease and flour the pan, cause I didn't do so....

I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with a wonderful, moist, delicious cake.  I buttered the textured pan well, and sprinkled it with cocoa powder - the cake fell right out.  I mis-chose the frosting - using a cocoa buttercream.  I think this cake would go best with a mildly sweet frosting - something sour cream-based or even a whipped cream topping.  It is really so nummy on its own.  I wonder if some of the negative reviews were from those using Dutch-processed cocoa.  The baking soda will not leaven properly with this kind of alkylized cocoa  See Joy of Baking for details.

Brilliant cake to make.  Completely moist and tasty.  The problem people have with this is that making a cake is an art and you really have to watch the directions carefully.  Several tips: Let the cocoa mix with hot water be completely cool before using it.  Actually SIFT the flour, soda, powder and salt (if you don't have a sifter, use a tablespoon and sift over and over again.  Make sure that the mixture is light and fluffy when mixing (such as the sugar with the butter) and it should be fluffy throughout until the end, when it becomes a batter at the end.  I took the advice as well that the cake sticks - use the old method of buttering pans liberally and then sprinkle plain flour on the bottom so it comes out clean.  Beautiful recipe.  A real joy to make.

Awesome! This cake is very moist and chocolately. I made exactly AS IS. I sprayed my pans well, but 2/3 the cake stuck at the bottom so parchment is a MUST! In case anyone is wanting to use a differnt sized pan...this batter measures aprox. 9 cups of batter. It worked perfectly in my 11x15x2 sheet cake pan.

This really is a great cake recipie. I get raves everytime I make one. It crumbs more like a brownie than cake and is very dense and moist. The only tip I have to add is to use 1/2 the boiling water than called for when disolving the chocolate. After it is disolved and smooth add the remaining water very cold. This way you dont have to wait for the mixture to cool or risk melting the butter if you dont wait long enough. Cheers!

Really decadent cake. Not too difficult.
I made this cake in a 9x13 pan. It was hefty, but came out perfectly. I will say that it got better the next couple 
days as it added even more moisture.
So. Good.

I made this cake for a birthday party and it was a big hit! I accidently used 11-inch pans, but it worked out fine, just cut a few minutes off the cook time. This is a great substitute for the trans-fatty box cakes (as long as you don't add trans-fat margarine). For the frosting, I used the "Chocolate Frosting I" from this site.
       
UPDATE: I made this recipe vegan by substituting the butter for trans-fat free vegan margarine (Nucoa or Smart Balance Light) and using 3 tbsp applesauce for each egg. It turned out even better than the original recipe because the applesauce made it VERY moist!

Hands down the best chocolate cake ever (and I bake ALOT). Deserves 10 stars for sure. I dont know what all those other crazy people were talking about when they said this cake was dry and crumbly. They must have over-baked it or under-creamed the butter/sugar. This was the moistest, softest, tastiest cake. It did not stick as mentioned previously, although I use silicone bakeware so that may have helped. Nothing ever sticks to that. Fantastic cake. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this cake. Many thanks to whomever posted this recipe.

Dry D-Dry Dry Dry.  I was expecting this recipe to be the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted,well it wasn't. I was kind of put off by the overload of chocolate, which I felt was too much.  I also like my cakes sweet, and this one even with the 2+ cups of sugar, wasn't sweet enough. If you do make this recipe, follow the advise of another reviewer and have a glass of milk with it.

I only have 2 words for this cake--De Lish!!  I frequently bake this cake for friends, family and catering clients and usually frost it with Carol's Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting.  Incredibly moist with strong flavor. For fun, I decorate the cake with chocolate covered strawberries.  Sometimes, I split the layers and use a raspberry filling (filling between 2 layers and chocolate frosting between the other). I haven't had problems with the cake releasing from the pan.  I always spray pans with Baker's Joy and the flour from the spray doesn't affect the chocolate color when the cake is released from the pan. Also, I line cake pans with parchment paper circles or liners.  YOu can cut the circles yourself or order pan liners in bulk from www.sugarcraft.com.  I bake so many cakes (and I am so lazy) that it is worth it to order.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Everyone who has eaten this cake says it is perfect. I used 1 1/4 cup cake flour instead of all purpose flour to lighten the cake a bit  I also baked it in three 8 inch round aluminum foil pans as three individual cakes. The foil pans are very good coz I didn't have to remove the cake from the pan before giving it to people. (There's a nice plastic cover for each pan, so I can just frost the cake in the pan and pop the cover over--very convenient and also a nice presentation) I toasted almon slices and generously sprinkle on the frosted cake. The end product is sooo beautiful and obviously delicious.

This cake is so light and moist.  The only thing I change is to use 1/2 cup of espresso and 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk in place of the boiling water.  Even people who don't like chocolate cake love this cake.

WOW! I am an amateur baker who needed a recipe to try out my new bundt pan and this recipe is all that and a bag of chips!  The chocolate of the cake was not overly sweet, so it allowed me to drown it with chocolate ganache to the rave reviews of my dinner guests.  So for a newbie like me, I will forgo ever buying a bakery cake or even bothering with a box cake, this cake is AMAZING!  My husband who used to be a professional baker (which = him abstaining from almost all cakes and pies) gobbled this up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  So when you are having company and I mean the kind of company who are "cake snobs" (like my sister-in-law who has the nerve to spit a bite of cake into a napkin if it not as perfect as she makes it!) let them eat cake and let it be this cake, they will be begging for the recipe!  And of course being the fabulous baker you are, be selective who gets the recipe (definitely not the sister-in-law with the napkin, I mean really, who does that?!!) My secret weapon ganache:  bring 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup heavy cream to a frothy boil while whisking regularly, then add 1/2 stick butter sliced into cubes, 5 ounces unsweetend chocolate and 1 tsp vanilla, whisk until melted.  Allow to stand until it is the consistency you need, (it can also be refrigerated until it stiffens up) and voila! Perfect for this cake, enjoy!

Good but not great! The original recipe is not very moist but it's much better with 1 cup of sour cream added to the batter. Added coffee to the hot water/cocoa mixure.

This cake tasted amazing.

I was making cake pops with it, and I tried the cake pop recipe, which did not turn out whatsoever. The balls fell apart and didn't work. So, since I had the other cake, I frosted it with some buttercream frosting, threw on some sprinkles, and took a slice. It tasted great, was easy to bake and frost, and had just the right amount of chocolate. Not too sweet, but not lacking any flavour. I did not find the cake dry at all; I found it to be very moist. A quick tip: let the cocoa powder/boiling water mixture cool thoroughly. I waited an hour before mixing in the other ingredients. I also added a special little twist to the cocoa powder/water mixture that made the cake fudgy and a little more chocolatey: 1 square of unsweetened chocolate. I melted it, no butter with it, just completely by itself, and added it into the mixture. I also kept the exact 1 cup of cocoa, and it turned out great. I will definitely be baking this again. (I also made mini muffins that are just about the best muffins I've ever tasted!) I'll be recommending this recipe to anyone who wants to bake an amazing chocolate cake, that's super easy to bake.

I was really disappointed by this recipe after reading all the positive reviews for it.  I made the cake as written, and I found it lacking in flavor and dry.  This was not the fudgy, dark, rich, moist cake I thought it would be.  Very bland - the Betty Crocker cake mixes I've made were much better.

I made it a day before Thanksgiving Dinner and kept it in the fridge, which kept it moist. I only made one change which was to substitute the boiling water for coffee; it gave it a nice flavor. I baked it in a Bundt pan for just over 50 minutes. Frosted it with cream cheese and cocoa frosting. Everyone loved it.

If I could I'd give this cake a 10 star rating, it was moist and so chocolaty, the only problem I had it took a little longer to bake 35 - 40 mintues. I didn't have 9inch pans I used 3 8 inch pans.  For icing for this cake I used the Icing from this site Extreme Chocolate Cake that has the BEST BUTTERCREME ICING.    My husband said, it was the best chocolate cake I have ever made and I only made 2 from scratch. ha ha, he said the BUTTER CREME ICING WAS DA BOMB.  he rates this cake 10+ as well and the icing he said is 20+ stars.  I think next time I make another chocolate cake I am going to use the one from the icing recipe... Extreme Chocolate Cake.

I will never use a box cake mix again!! This cake is rich and moist and dense. I made it as a Bundt cake which increased the cooking time to an hour or so, but it was worth the wait! I didn't even frost it, just drizzled a little glaze of vanilla and powdered sugar. I followed others' advice about letting the cocoa mixture cool. I also really creamed the butter to let it get light and fluffy...probably 8-10 minutes. The only ingredient change I made was to use Mexican vanilla because that is the only vanilla I buy. Also my children who don't have baking experience helped and found the recipe easy to understand and follow!! YUMMY!!! I printed this recipe and put it in my recipe book labeled "Mom's Birthday Cake" so they can make this same cake for me next year!!

So good!  Made them as cupcakes and they turned out nice and moist.  Would probably make an even better cake.  Can't wait to try it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe to make my wedding cake! I LOVE this recipe! I use strong fresh brewed coffee in place of the hot water to give it a fuller flavor. I also add a 1/4 cup more cocoa mixed with oil until it makes the consistency of melted chocolate this gives it not only more of a chocolaty taste but also adds to the moisture of the cake.

This cake was good, but I've certainly had better. I cut the recipe in half and made cupcakes (approx. a dozen) and used the 'buttercream icing' recipe from this site. The key is to use a high quality/great tasting cocoa. I only had Nestle on hand, so when I make again in the future I will be sure to purchase a specialty powder. The texture seems to change after the first day. Initially mine were moist and perfectly dense, then day two the density increased; all the while still very edible!

I've made this cake a few times, and I've learned something very important! The hotter the cocoa mixture is when you finish the recipe, the more dense the cake will be. You can literally decide how dense or how fluffy you want the cake by waiting or (usually in my case) being impatient!!

Warning:  This is NOT a rich chocolaty cake.  Do not be fooled by descriptions and reviews.  It is very moist and fluffy and lovely, but it is not richly chocolaty.  If you are looking to make a rich chocolate cake and you make this one, you will be disappointed.  It is, however, a lovely moist cake.

This is a really delicious chocolate cake.  I cut the recipe in half in order to make 16 cupcakes.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used hot milk instead of water.  I also whipped the egg whites and folded them into the batter.  The result was an incredibly rich, fluffy cake.  I will definitely make this again.

So disappointed!!! After much recipe research, made last night for Valentine's Day and ended up throwing it out! The cake completely fell apart after being cooled for two hours and was a mess when I cut and frosted it. The texture is not firm enough for a solid layer cake. I gave it two stars because it really does taste good, but as far as being easy, it just doesn't hold together well for a presentable cake. Still on the search and looking for the ultimate chocolate cake recipe to keep in my recipe box!

Thos was good, nothing special. I don't think I'd call it "elegant".  Actually, I was thinking a cold glass of milk would go well with it.

This cake turned out great!  I had small eggs, so I used 6 insead of 4 and also ran out of coco.  I used about 3/4c (or less) coco and it still tasted great, very chocolate (w/ chocolate frosting).  I don't have round cake pans, so I baked it in 13x9 inch pan for about 25 extra minutes.  My husband loved it - definately a keeper!!

I used this recipe for a birthday cake - turned out quite well.  I used a store bought frosting, and it tasted quite nice.  I only made two layers so made some cup cakes with the extra batter - have to say they tasted better after a few days.  This cake is very light because of the water so I think it's a little delicate when first made.  Didn't taste as chocolately as I would have liked though.

I made this for my son's birthday the first time and now he wants it this year too.  It is a wonderful tasting and moist cake.  It is important to really take the time to cream the butter and sugar until it becomes fluffy and almost white in color.  This will be the basis for the texture of the cake.  It is also important to let the cocoa and boiling water mixture cool to room temperature before mixing up your cake. Try it.  It is a super tasty and great textured cake.

Wonderful, wonderful, cake! Comes out perfectly if you let the first mixture cool and are sure to beat the eggs in well. Scaled it down to a one- layer cake, iced with dark chocolate fudge icing and added fondant. Doesn't have the bitter taste that is sometimes associated with dark chocolate. Delicious!

I made cupcakes with this recipe and they came out very well.  I must say this is my favorite chocolate cake recipe I've ever used.  I didn't make any alterations but if you are going to make cupcakes with this recipe, you have to make sure you don't cook them too long because the edges get too brittle.  Very tasty!!!

This cake is very dense and rich. If you happen to run out of unsweetened cocoa powder and have to use half a cup of Dutch process cocoa, it's okay.

Very good and easy!  The only thing I did different was to use buttermilk instead of boiling water.  I just heated the buttermilk and cocoa on the stove to boil.  Will be making this again.

I know my way around a cake, but this was a complete fail.  I followed it exactly - no changes.  Baked for 27 minutes, until done.  The cake tasted good, very moist, but they fell apart when they came out of the pan (greased very well per another reviewer's suggestion, AND using non-stick baking pans!). I will not be making this recipe again.

This is an EXCELLENT cake. Not dry AT ALL. I am sorry to say, but if your cake was dry it was due to error on your part. I followed a lot of the reccomendations and all of the instructions to a T! I beat the butter and sugar with a hand mixer for 2 minutes. I also replaced the water in the recipe with strong coffee. I also seperated the eggs and whipped the egg whites and folded them in at the very end when the batter was complete. I made 30 cupcakes out of this recipe. They were delicious. I baked them at 350 for 18 minutes and perfection! This cake requires effort, but it is light, fluffy, moist, and delicious!!

hands down, best cake ever. I made a layer cake the other night, and cupcakes tonight (baked 16 minutes at 350) and they were absolutely fantastic. moist and fluffy, could have gone without frosting (but obviously that's no fun). this will be my new stand-by chocolate cake, replacing Elizabeth's Extreme Chocolate Lover's Cake from this site. that one's also superb, but this one is just as good, if not better, with fewer, more readily-available ingredients (in my kitchen, anyway. I don't keep sour cream around, and I hate using 6 of the 8 squares of chocolate in a box). 
make this cake. lick the bowl. then don't share it.

Delicious!  My new go-to chocolate cake recipe.  I made this into cupcakes, which I iced with Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  Perfect!  The recipe made 24 large cupcakes (3/4 full).  Also tried it in a 11x13 glass pan, which took 40 minutes.

OMG this is a great cake. I made it tonight as a test run before I make my daughters birthday cake next weekend :) My only complaint is that it was a little too crumbly for my liking so I am going to add a cup of sour cream to the next batch! Thanks for the recipe :)

I found this recipe on another food site and it called for about four minutes of creaming the butter/sugar mixture, perhaps this would help those who had a problem with it being dry. Also there was no mention of sifting the dry ingredients and this was from someone who said their family had been making this for years.

Awesome. I used the chef's suggestion and beat the egg whites extra foamy and a little of the sugar (1/4th cup) before mixing it with the yolks. The butter and rest of the sugar i beat really fluffy on the kitchen aid for about 4 minutes or so.   I used Starbuck's Casi Cielo coffee instead of water.   after mixing everything together, I then beat at low speed for about 30 seconds in the kitchen aid and then on medium high for another 1ish minute to mix out the flour chunks and add a little more air to it.   Cooked it for 25 minutes. Most of it in a 13x9 glass pan, and the remainder in a 9 inch. but you could just pour all of it in the 13x9 for a higher cake. just cook a few more minutes.   amazingly moist and super without frosting.

About the dryness issue some may have:       Boiling water:  You may be getting a dryer crumb as you measure the water and THEN boil it.  Doing it this way, one gets loss of water via evaporation.  Always go over some on the boiling water, and then you don't have to worry about losing a significant of water.       Creaming butter/sugar:  I recommend folding the flour mixture into the butter/sugar mix (pretty much a buttercream really) in three segments.  Each segment, use a third of the flour and add in the next amount once the first is all incorporated.  This ensures a well mixed flour with little or no lumps.  Also, it helps keep the fluffy texture you created by whipping the buttercream together.  This fluffiness wil help the crumb seem more "moist" as it won't be as dense(as opposed to just stirring it all together).

THIS CAKE IS LIKE CRACK!!! I could not stop eating it, it was so good. I did a bundt cake and did chocolate glaze and white glaze. Seriously I ate the entire thing in two days. SO BAD! Use a high quality cocoa and this is the best cake ever! I used Giradeli (spelling) and it was so worth it. I am now making another one to cover up my naughtiness ;) the hubby will be home in three hours from out of town haha.

Make ABSOLUTELY SURE you allow the chocolate mixture to cool completely before mixing it with the other ingredients, or else the cake won't rise much.  I made this mistake, and my layers turned out to be dense, and not very tall.  It still tasted great, just wasn't as tall and impressive as it should've been.

My husband is German and loves blackforest cake, and this is the perfect base for it! I add half a cup of rum and a teaspoon of rum extract to the dough. It makes a moist, dark cake very suitable for cherries and whipped cream. =D

This is the best chocolate cake recipe that I have ever made.  It's not cloyingly sweet, it's moist but holds up to icing.  My chocoholic boyfriend loved it!  This is my "go to" recipe for chocolate cake from now on.

This recipe is superb just the way it is, but I've been using 1 cup heated milk and 1 cup boiling water instead of 2 cups boiling water  The cake is dense and moist, chocolatey, but not too strong.  I've been making it in a bundt pan and drizzling vanilla icing overtop.   GREAT chocolate cake recipe.

Great cake!  Made a wonderful birthday cake for my husband who loves chocolate.  It was easy to make and stayed moist.  Did a crumb coat with the quick and almost professional buttercream recipe from this site and covered it in fondant.  Yum!

Delicious! Very easy to make. I made it in a bundt pan, and needed to cook it about 50 minutes. It was a fluffy, moist and very chocolately cake. I greased the pan and it came out perfectly, no breaking.

Spectacular!  I made 2 batches: - Batch one was a half batch, which I made into 12 large cupcakes.  I replaced the boiling water with boiling coffee and used canola instead of butter.  Turned out lovely!  About 20 mins at 330 F approx.   - Batch 2, also a half batch, I made with spelt flour as I can't have wheat.  Same as above, oil for butter and coffee for water.  This time I added some instant coffee to the coffee to give it a bit more coffee taste.  Turned out AWESOME!  These were even fluffy which is difficult for spelt.  For both batches, I took the advice of others and whipped the egg whites separate and folded them in....this may be why they turned out so fluffy and nice, not dense like some people have claimed :)  I decorated mine with whipped vanilla icing and plain M&M's.  YUM! Thanks, this one is for keeps!

The flavour of this cake was really good. Very chocolatey. However the texture was much too heavy. Almost like mud cake. I think there are too many eggs in it.

I would give this as many stars as humanly possible.  I made this cake for my dad and family for father's day.  I made it in a heart shaped pan with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" in between the layers and "Rich Chocolate Frosting" for the outside frosting (altered to make less).  I used Hersey's Special Dark Chocolate unsweetened cocoa powder for the cocoa powder in both the cake and chocolate frosting.  I was told it was better than the Factory Mud Pie at the Cheesecake Factory and that if I didn't bring it for his birthday in two weeks I would be disowned.  Thanks it was an awesome cake!

Excellent homemade cake.  I made a 9x13 cake and had some left over to make small individual bundt cakes in my pampered chef stone.  Next time I'll make 2/3 recipe and that should fit nicely in the pan.  It's a nice, dense homemade cake.  Rave reviews every time I make it!

Nice texture and flavour, but note that this cake is not super-chocolatey. I definitely could have used a stronger flavour, but I made a layer cake with cream cheese frosting and strawberries-and-cream filling, which helped dress it up a bit. I reduced sugar by about a quarter.

OMG.

This cake, it's beyond words. Moist, chocolatey, not-too-rich-or-too-light, sweet, decadent

just perfect. I won't be needing ANY other chocolate cake recipe. This is THE one.

I'd never made cake from scratch before that actually turned out good until i tried this recipe! It is now my go to recipe for chocolate cake. I've made several wedding cakes with it and it is always praised to high heaven! Just make sure you beat the eggs/butter/sugar really well and you cant go wrong. Mine usually resembles yellow whip cream, and once you add the flour don't over mix. Make sure you don't over cook or it will be dry. I made that mistake once but it was easily remedied by wrapping in plastic wrap and letting it sit overnight.

This cake was amazingly good.  I used 2 pans, and this made the baking time about 15 minutes more.  I also separated the eggs and whisked the whites with 1/4 of the sugar, although I don't know how much of a difference that made.

This is an unbelievably moist, delicious chocolate cake. Very decadent! I highly recommend this to anyone considering making it.  I used it for my daughters birthday cake, and got rave reviews from all my guests!! I topped it with "Special Buttercream Frosting" also taken from this site, and it was out of this world. I do have to say I was a bit nervous about the recipe after mixing it up and pouring into the pans, the batter was very thin and I thought no way it was going to bake up right but it did, and I used two 8" cake pans, and was concerned about overbaking, but I only had to add about 5 mins on to the total time and they came out perfect!! I will definately use this as my Chocolate Cake recipe from here on out!!!

I LOVE this recipe! The cake isn't too sweet which is great, and it goes perfectly with ganache. They freeze well, too, which is perfect for those of us who don't have enough people around to eat a whole three-layer cake. :) I would suggest mixing the cocoa powder and water an hour or more before you plan to mix up the cake batter. The longer the cocoa/water mixture is left to cool, the better, because it gets thicker as it cools. This is a recipe that I will definitely be making over and over again - thanks Carol! =)

after reading a bunch of reviews, i did the same thing as ROSEMC91. i used milk instead of water in the recipe, i added a little extra cocoa powder, and i used cake flour instead of all purpose. i frosted inbetween the layers with raspberry cream cheese frosting using the same kind of recipe ROSEMC91 stated.  i used a chocolate frosting recipe i found on this site to frost the sides and top of the cake. DELICIOUS! the cake is light, fluffy, and very chocolatey. just wonderful!

I needed to find a cake recipe to use for my son's birthday cake. The boxed cake that I made got burned on the bottom and sides and seemed too thin and I didn't have time to run to the store to get another one. So, I decided to give this one a try. I am so glad I did! I made it in a 13x9 pan and it rose really well so it was nice and thick. I was actually surprised at how much flavor it had, too. It was really delicious! I was very tempted to eat some of the leftovers for breakfast the next morning! Forget the boxed cake mix, I am going to use this recipe from now on! It is well worth the few extra minutes and ingredients!

At first taste out of the oven, I thought this recipe wasn't quite chocolatey enough. I added an egg to make cupcakes, which I then filled and glazed. The end product is a much tastier version of a Hostess Cupcake specifically for a themed office party. The cakes rose quite nicely and came out moist and tasty. I filled them with Cool Whipped Frosting from this site, then used Hard Chocolate Glaze to coat the tops. I am incredibly pleased by how this recipe turned out.

I made this recipe because I had a sweet tooth.  When I mixed all the batter together there was big doughy balls, and I fallowed the recipe.  But it tasted really good over all.

I made this recipie into cupcakes for my cousin's 6th and he loved them! It made 24 LARGE cupcakes and they probably should have been cooked for 20 minutes, but i left mine in for 25 and the bottoms burned, just a little bit. They were really moist, even though I over cooked them :)
Thanks for the recipie!

Excellent cake!!! After reading all these great reviews, I decided to try this recipe. This cakes tastes best when it's one day old (i.e. one day after being baked). The cake was very moist and had a rich "chocolaty" flavour. I topped it with chocolate frosting and my friends devoured it!! Definitely a "must try"!!!

I followed the recipe exactly (except (I used a 10x14 inch pan, which worked great). The texture was perfect, and it might have been the most evenly shaped cake I've ever baked. LOTS of compliments on the flavor of this excellent cake!

The unanimous decision was that it tasted like a three brownies layered on top of each other.  Followed the recipe word for word, but it came out heavy.  Not sure if that's what the "dark" part is supposed to be.  But I will not use this recipe again, except perhaps to make brownies.  If you like heavy cakes, then this is the recipe for you.  If you like a more airy cake, then look somewhere else.

This is the BEST chocolate cake I have ever tasted.  I'm a cake baker/decorator and everyone I've made this cake for so far has said it's the best.  Thank you.

This is a very good recipe after I made several changes. 1 cup of cocoa seemed like too much; and I am glad I reduced it to 3/4 cup otherwise the cocoa flavor wouldve been too overpowering. I also increased the baking powder, elimated the baking soda, using 1 tsp. of salt. used milk instead of water and added a box of instant ( chocolate fudge flavor) pudding. It came out great! very moist and rich chocolate flavor :)

I have to say this is a great recipe.  Instead of using butter, I used 1 cup of crisco plus 6 tsp water.  I don't have 3 9" rounds, so I used 1 12x12 and 1 8" round to make a layer cake.   It took about 35 minutes to bake in 325 degree.  From other reviewer's advise, I went get an oven thermometer.  Turned out my oven was 25 degree lower that it should be.  So, I kept it at 350 (which should be only 325).  The cake came out really good texture, easy to handle (flipping, etc).   I frosted with a special buttercream recipe from this web, by Rick.  The cake was presented at work yesterday for someone's birthday.  Good comments I got.
I will make this cake all the times for my chocolate base cake.  Thanks Carol!

This recipe is overrated. It was too dry and because of its size you need 3 pans (i only have 2) so I had to wait and cook the third layer later. 

I make a great choc cake recipe (on the side of the cocoa box) and delicious frosting (French Silk Frosting) from the Betty Crocker cookbook. I was hoping to top those recipes but NO way.  If you want a superior chocolate cake use the one on the side of the Hershey's Cocoa box with the Betty Crocker French Silk icing.

Oh my!

We made this cake for my husband's birthday. We were looking for a scratch-built cake that would be rich & large enough to fill a bundt pan. 

We followed the recipe exactly, remembering to dust the pan before putting the batter in, and it turned out perfect. With the depth of the bundt pan it took 45 minutes to bake, but it was well worth the wait! After drizzling chocolate syrup over the top it was beautiful!

WOW! I lost my usual recipe for chocolate cake (which I liked because it made a large 3-layer 9" cake) so I went looking here and tried this one. It made a big 12x12 cake for my niece's birthday that was chocolately and MOIST! I've never had a chocolate cake this moist before. I have stopped looking for the recipe I lost because this one is all I need!

Delicious!  I made this for a dinner party with friends and it was a hit.  The cake was still warm when I took it out of the pan so it stuck a bit, but it still came out beautiful. Next time I'll wait unitl it cools completely.  It wasn't overly chocolately or sweet but had a good dark chocolate flavor and was moist.  Definitely good enough to eat without frosting and good enough for this chocolate lover. Will be making this again!

I listened to the advice of other reviewers and lowered the temp to 325°. This extended the cooking time and it still came out partially uncooked. Next time I would follow the recipe as written. Good flavor, very "moist" (if you considered 1/2 baked moist..) I also added some white chocolate chips which may have been part of my problem.

This cake is amazing!  It's super rich and moist and the deep reddish brown colour from the cocoa makes it look beautiful.  I made it in a bundt shaped pan and used the buttercream frosting recipe from the deep dark chocolate cake recipe as the topping and added fresh raspberries - wow!!  My friend's dog stole the cake right off the counter.

I typically hate cake in all forms, flavors, with any fillings, toppings or icings. I do not like cake flavor or cake texture. This cake was made on a whim since I wanted something chocolatey and the husband wanted cupcakes I decided I would try to find something that worked for both of us. I intended to make a ganache to go with it but as I didn't have all the ingredients necessary, I ended up sprinkling my cupcakes with a dusting of powdered sugar. They probably didn't even need that. The reviews do not do these justice. Honestly, they were amazing. I want another one but I am on a diet so one a day! I can barely wait until my one tomorrow though lol. Honestly, these were perfectly most and full of chocolatey flavor. The recipe was 100X better than any boxed cake mix and not hard to accomplish albeit a bit time consuming for a person making their first from-scratch cake. I made sure to beat the sugar and butter for at least 2 minutes as others had suggested to insure these came out moist and they did. Seriously, a moist cupcake is what I got out of this. It was dense and airy at the same time if that is even possible. I would follow the recipe to a T but I am so happy to find something that works for us that I will probably add things to it now for future baking trials! Can barely wait to flavor it with coffee as others have suggested!

I made this for Christmas and it was delicious.  I used white chocolate ganache and raspberry filling between the layers and I poured a semisweet chocolate ganache over the top layer.  Three fresh raspberries garnished the top. My stepson gave it 2 thumbs up.  I had it for breakfast the day after Christmas.

I did have a challenge getting the layers out of the pans.  Two of the 3 pans had a lever that loosens the cake sides & bottoms. One of these layers cracked when I tipped the pan onto my hand to remove it. I had to place the rack over the top of the pan and flip it to get it out safely.  The layer in the pan without the lever stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I scraped the stuck part and pieced it back onto the layer.

The recipe only says to grease the pan.  Next time, I will dust with cocoa as well.  I just watched the video and it says to cool the cake completely before removing from the pan.  The recipe doesn't say this and I cooled 15 minutes (like many cake mixes instruct).  Perhaps this is why I had the cracking, but I don't think this caused the sticking.

Amazing!! Even the batter was amazing! I first made cupcakes - sprinkled with powdered sugar. Makes 18 and required 25 minutes. Not sure if anyone can really answer this... but has anyone else noticed the cupcakes have a difficult time releasing from the pan? I sprayed with non stick and nothing was over cooked, I did let them cool completely before trying to remove. If someone has the opportunity, I'd love to hear how you handle this issue. 
I can't stress how amazing these are!!

I made this cake for a very special family reunion, and it was AMAZING!!! It came out light and moist, and tasted delicious with cream cheese frosting II(from this site) and strawberry cake filling(also from this site). I had no problem with the cake sticking to the pan. My trick for taking it out was to float the pan in a container of cold water for about five minutes. i then put a plate over the cake, turned it upside down, and patted the bottom of the pan. the cake came right out onto the plate, and i turned it over using another plate. Beautiful cake, elegant and tasty.

Yum! This cake is moist and chocolaty but its not very sweet so you can add any frosting/icing you want or just dust it with powdered sugar. It's fantastic with fresh raspberries on the side. Even my mom, who hates sweets liked this recipe. Also, it was a simple recipe, which is great for a teen who loves to cook like me. Thanks for submitting.

DID IT IN THE MICROWAVE!! I halved the recipe just to try it out (had trouble computing a fourth). PERFECT! (I did reduce the sugar to about the same weight as the flour I used). I reduced the boiling water by 1/3 its original quantity, since I'll be baking it in a microwave oven, added a teaspoon of Nescafe to the cocoa powder, then left the rest unaltered. I filled my 4-inch ramekins half-full then baked them one by one in my microwave for 2.5 minutes on Medium-Low (#3 of 7 power levels) and they came out great! This is gonna be the recipe for my daughter's birthday cake and cupcakes! THANK YOU!!!!

Not sure what happened with this one but it came out very heavy.  More like a brownie than a cake which was not what I expected.  I didn't change any ingredients but I did bake it in a glass 13 x 9 pan as another reviewer did.  Although the taste was still VERY good, this was not what I would classify as a "cake".  I used all organic ingredients, as I always do but will have to continue my search for the perfect "made from scratch" chocolate cake.

i'll try it one more time but I wasnt much of a fan. Someone else mentioned this is best with an added glaze or frosting and I find this to be true. I found a raspberry glaze that does a great job (raspberry jam 1/4 c, 2 tablespoons apple juice, 1/2 teaspoon rum extract)

This cake had the best texture and the best flavor of any other chocolate cake I have ever made.  Light, fluffy and oh so chocolaty!  I used a high quality dark chocolate and subbed almond milk for the water.  I made as directed in the 3 pans and they baked quite evenly.  This cake is so good you don't even need frosting!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect! I used this to make cupcakes (20 minutes bake time) frosted with Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting by Mary Beth Guba which was a perfect fudgy compliment to this moist, thick cake.

I'll give it a 5 star as my hubby, 2yo son and colleagues loved it!  I baked yesterday and poured choc ganache over it (recipe also from here).  I baked 2 cakes plus had leftovers that i used to make cupcakes instead. Hubby ate the cupcakes when it was fresh...he said it was moist.  This morning, i brought to office (which i kept overnight in the fridge), I find that it tastes better than yesterday.  It's not too sweet which goes well with the choc ganache.  Colleagues said that it's still very moist and delicious.  Had it with a cup of hot coffee. :)

I followed exactly as per recipe...no changes.  I followed the advice of letting the hot cocoa mixture to completely cool before i added to the batter.  I baked the cakes for 30 minutes and 17 minutes for cupcakes.

I let the cake to completely cool before I remove them for their pans.  I did find that I had to handle the cake with care while i was torting the cake.

this is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever used, its moist, dark, and has a nice texture, not too light or dense, perfect crumb with no dryness. I halved the recipe and made cupcakes, they came out fantastic and did not stick to the cupcake papers

I was disappointed in this recipe and will not make it again.  I didn't like the texture and it fell apart.  I much prefer other chocolate cake recipes that use squares of chocolate and buttermilk in them.

I cut this recipe in half and it worked beautifully. Very moist. Paired with pie cherry filling and mounds of almond whipped cream, the cake was a hit. Thanks :)

Great chocolate cake.  Made it for my daughter's birthday and it was devoured.  Frosted it with Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting on this site.  Delish!!  Thought the batter was runny and i was a bit worried, but it came out fine.  Use parchment paper in your pans to make sure it comes out easily.

Love it!! super moist and fluffy, maybe a bit crumbly but I don't care cus I eat it as is and no need for decoration :) Will keep this def. for future bakings. I only used 1 3/4 cup of sugar cus I dont like it too sweet and turned out perfect! The only problem I had was the baking time, I baked one in 8x8 glass and one in 8" bundt pan, both took 45min to bake fully.
The texture was very different from the "Extreme Chocolate Cake" from this site, this is alot more softer and fluffier.

5 STARS HAND DOWN! I have tried a lot of "from scratch" cake recipes, and this is BY FAR my FAVORITE!  It is dense, flavorful, and easy to prepare.  I worried about a dry cake from the other reviews, but didn't have any trouble with anything.  A perfect cake to frost with 7 minute frosting!

This is an excellent cake. The batter keeps its shape and isn't runny, so it's easy to put into cupcake shape. In the future I will use whisk the cocoa into 1 cup boiling coffee, then as it cools add 1 cup buttermilk, so that I have the best of all possible chocolate flavor combinations. As written with water, this recipe made 36 cupcakes (1/2 to 2/3 full) at 142 calories each. Thank you for the recipe!

Very good cake.  I was about 3 TBSP short of butter so I threw in about 1/2 C sweetened apple sauce.  Since I thought that 2 1/4 C sugar seemed like an awful lot, I decreased it to 2 C.  Frosted with store bought cream cheese frosting.  I received many compliments at work about how moist the cake was.  I will use this again!

Great cake! Moist all over, baked it at 340 degrees a little longer and used coffee for the water. Also put 2 tablespoons of brandy, a few drops of almond extract, coconut and chopped pecans in the sour cream icing... Tastes kinda like a dark chocolate Almond Joy bar! If you can find cocoa done the Dutch way, try that.

Very good cake didn't have problems with it being dry. I did make sure the cocoa mixture was cool and folded in the egg whites separately. It made about 28 cupcakes.

I made the cake exactly as instructed except that I added 2tbsp of ground cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of chili powder in an effort to make a Mexican Chocolate cake. The spices were very subtle and delicious! Next time I'm going to add even more. I used shortening to grease a glass 11"x15" glass pan and baked for 40 minutes.

Loved it, didn't change a thing!  Using the serving size given, I got away with making 24 cupcakes more than 3/4 full just so I could get away with cooking them all at once not 2 batches, only had a little batter leftover.  15 minutes was perfect at 350F, they were not huge as I feared.  I used a new trick I learned on Food Network, pour batter into a zip-lock and cut a tiny hole in the corner to squeeze it out into the cupcake pans, very easy!

this is a great recipe for chocolate cake.  I've been using it for several years now, and it's my kids' choice for birthday cakes.  It also works well as cupcakes too.  I have substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose with no noticeable difference - it still stays moist and delicious, and it gets even better the next day (and the day after that, if it lasts that long!).

So much better than cake mix! Tastes chocolatey enough in my opinion. I baked the mix in two 9 inch round pans, filled it with dulce de leche and cream cheese mix and frosted it with Wedding Cake Icing (from this page) Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted good, but it complete crumbled!!  I've never had a cake that was so hard to decorate in my life. :(  Yummy to eat, but not fun to look at since it comes apart so easily.

I had high hopes for this cake...it way waaay too dry and tasted exactly like a box cake! NOT worth the calories. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it looked pretty.

I normally don't like chocolate cake but this one is great---moist and flavorful.  I took some advice from other reviews and whipped the egg whites and added 1/2 cup sour cream.  I frosted it with Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting from this site.  Way yummy and no leftovers!

I made this for our son's birthday, I made it into a 9x13 size (it filled the pan perfectly). Baked at 325' for 58 minutes. I frosted it with Hershey's chocolate frosting. We loved it. It was moist, rich and super chocolaty! I just blogged it today on "Mommy? I'm Hungry!"  and it's gotten great reviews already! This is a keeper!

This was an excellent cake!  The only thing I did different was scale down the recipe to 1 pan because its just my husband and me.  I read the review from Christmas8 who said its not 'the' chocolate cake and I have to say that this cake, like most, need frosting and if you overdo it on chocolate or sugar, once you put that frosting on top it will be overkill.  If you want a very rich cake, try one that does not need frosting like the flourless cake from this site.  Otherwise, enjoy this cake with whatever frosting tickles your fancy.  I made this with the Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site and it was a match made in heaven!  Its already made it into my recipe book.  I think my search for a good, basic chocolate cake has ended, thank you Carol!

I used hot coffee instead of the water and oil instead of butter. I made mine in a bundt pan that was dusted with cocoa powder. I love the texture. It slices nicely and it's moist.

I’ve been looking for a chocolate cake recipe for a long time and now I have found it.  It’s fantastic and when paired with the “Heavenly Chocolate Mousse” from this site as a filling it is, well, HEAVEN!  In addition to the chocolate mousse for a filling, I covered the cake with whipped cream, toped with chocolate curls and covered the base of the cake with strawberries.  DELICIOUS!

This cake STUCK to every pan I used! It tasted good. But the instructions state to only grease the pan. I used 2 types of pans(non stick & aluminum, greased) & it still stuck. I even floured & greased a pan. The recipe is simple to follow though. I just couldn't appreciate the cake to its fullest w/it faling apart.

I made this cake yesterday for my Hubby's B-day! It was awesome & moist!! I have already been asked for a recipe! I did leave out aprox. 1/4 cup of sugar, as I thought it was going to be too sweet. And I used a store bought frosting, which is usually sweet enough, so I was glad I left some sugar out.  After all....wonderful recipe, definitely will be using this for another occasions....loved it!

I feel it's unfair to rate a recipe when its not followed exactly. But the outcome of my variation turned out so well I had to share it. I used 1/2 cup cooked mashed apples (a homemade attempt to make applesauce) and 1/2 cup olive oil instead of the 1 cup of butter the recipe calls for. Let me say it turned out to be a very delicious and healthy version of this recipe! It was great, even without topping (I don't like excessively sweet frosted cakes). Hope it helps!

I was disappointed with this recipe. I think with all the positive reviews, I just had my hopes higher than they should be. To me it just tasted like a boxed cake mix. I may try again and use buttermilk in place of the milk, and try a different cocoa, hoping for a richer, and a darker chocolate taste.

This is a very delicious recipe. Having been searching for a moist choc cake recipe for awhile, this definately fits the bill. I find it still tastes good the day after, even better in fact, and probably goes well with most icings, ganache being my favorite.  Two things my mom and I have experimented and found to be helpful in this recipe is  1) Adding in a tsp of instant coffee to the cocoa/water mixture as suggested by a previous review 2) Using pure cocoa powder (like vanhouten) really improves the flavor 3) Folding in bits of choc/choc chips into the final batter makes the cake very moist and gives an extra chocolate "kick". Nuts probably can be nice too.

This is my 'go-to' chocolate cake recipe. Most homemade cakes can be dry and dense, but this is very light and super moist.  I highly recommend it.  I also puts up to carving, if you like making 3D cakes like myself.... Enjoy!

I made this cake for a shared birthday between two of my roommates. They were both surprised that I had made it and surprised at how well it had turned out. Amazing recipe. I paired it with "Best Buttercream Frosting" by Jennifer. It was a hit. I will definitely make this again the next time I need a great birthday cake recipe or need to impress someone.

I made one layer (1/3 or 4 servings)and used 2 eggs instead of "1 1/3", which produced a very moist result. i also used hazelnut-flavored coffee instead of plain water. when the cake was done, i sprinkled chocolate chips on top and let the residual heat melt them so i could spread them into a smooth top (note: if you do this, make sure to cut into peices before chilling, otherwise the chocolate will be very hard and not cut well).

Im sorry for the low rate.. but this cake just wasnt what I was looking for.. I read several reviews before making it and decided to make cupcakes because some people said it sticked horribly to the pan.. well it sticked to my muffin papers as well! 
The taste was good thats why I give it 3 stars, but the texture wasnt good at all. I think cakes must be moist but dense enough to hold together!!
Maybe its just to much water. 
update: i have been thinking about this cake and how it turned out LOL so im going to give it a second chance.. maybe i will add only 1 3/4 cup water and make a cake out of it. maybe cupcakes were a bad idea , you have to have a good frosting for this cake. 
Update: Ok, havent made this again but did make one similar and found out that you have to use parchment and grease your pans well. Problem solved!

I will NEVER use another chocolate cake recipe!!  I have tested so many cake recipes and always have issues with them.  I follow this exactly and it turns out fantastic everytime.  I used this recipe with a raspberry filling and whipped cream cheese frosting AND chocolate ganache.  It is to die for!  I served this at a birthday party and at a company luncheon and many rave reviews!

EXCELLENT!!

I only had 1 8" round pan, and a 9" round inch pan, so decided to just make 2 rather thicker cakes instead.  Was a little worried, coz the batter was still very jiggly after 20 minutes of baking - had to add an extra 20 min or so, but it turned out great!  Moist and beautifully chocolatey.  

Due to lack of time, and the fact that I had 2 separate (very) small family gatherings to attend over the weekend, I decided to use the cakes individually.  For the first one (shortly out of the oven), I just thinned out some raspberry jam with hot water, and spread all over the cake and sprinkled blanched almonds on the top.  For the second cake, (the next day) I sliced the cake in 2, sandwich with cherries and whipping cream.  I made chocolate ganache icing (fr this site)as topping, and again decorated top with almonds and walnuts.

Big hits with my family!

Excellent recipe!  Splurged and got some good Ghirardelli Cocoa and also added about a tsp. of instant coffee granules to the cocoa mixture, then made two 10" round cakes.  Perfectly moist, tender, chocolatey, sweet - be patient and let it cool completely before trying to work with it!  I did not, even though I know better, and one layer crumbled when I tried to move it - that ended up in a trifle with strawberries. vanilla pudding/bananas, whipped cream and chocolate curls for garnish.  The remaining cake was covered in Special Buttercream Frosting, which I thought was too heavy and sweet for this cake.  For such a flavorful cake, a fluffy, not-to-sweet frosting would be perfect, although the the raspberry buttercream filling I used was divine with the chocolate - I even brushed the inside of the cake with slightly melted raspberry preserves before layering the filling.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe! Will use it again and again!!

Awesome recipe!! If you want to make it non-fat, just replace all the butter/oil with applesauce!

First, my changes:

I used 2c hot milk instead of 2c water.  I accidentally bought medium eggs instead of the standard LARGE, so I used 5 eggs instead of 4.  And I made about 36 large cupcakes instead of layers.

Result?  It was without question the most unbelievably moist, tender, melt-in-your-mouth cake I've ever eaten.  It was super chocolatey but not overly sweet, which made it the perfect partner to a rich buttercream frosting.  

I will definitely make this again, if only to meet the ever-increasing demands of my friends and colleagues.

The first time I made it, I wasn't too impressed by the taste of this cake. There was a lack of flavor and depth to the cake. The second time around I used 1 cup of chocolate milk with a cup of water. I also added a melted 4oz Ghirardelli 60% Cacao bittersweet chocolate baking bar to the batter along with using Ghirardelli unsweetend cocoa as well. The small tweaks to this recipe changed the entire cake! It turned out firm and moist and fudgy. Truly deserving the name of "Dark Chocolate Cake". I only gave it 3 stars for the original recipe but after my tweaks it was a 5 star cake!

I made this for a dinner at my girlfriend's parents' house.  It is a very rich cake, that must be eaten in small pieces. I separated the whites from the yolks and whipped them until thick peaks, then folded them into the batter to make the cake more fluffy.

here is the chocolate-almond buttercream frosting recipe I used.  --1 stick butter(soft), 1/2 stick of butter shortening, 1 1/2 tsp. of almond extract, 4 1/2 cups of sifted powdered sugar, mix that all up and melt another 1/2 stick of butter in the microwave with 2 squares of unsweetened chocolate and 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips. Then add to the frosting while blending. If you think it's too thick, add 1-2 tsp. of milk to thin it out.

I was pleased with this recipe.  I'm a novice at baking cakes but this one was SOOO easy.  I never made a cake unless it was a cake mix.  Let's just say, I'll never go back to cake mix.  This was so moist and the batter was so smooth.  Good flavor too!  I used a cool whip icing for it and it was a big hit with our company.  I'm baking this cake for a second time right now!  Very good!

Excellent cake! I use it as the base for many birthday cakes and it always gets rave reviews. Using the cocoa instead of chocolate gives a much deeper chocolate taste.

I have made my husband many a chocolate cake, but he deemed this as "The cake I have been looking for all my life."  If made a day in advance and frozen, it is even richer and more moist.  I topped it with a ganache, and everyone at our party thought it was amazing. I'll be using this recipe the rest of my life.

Amazing!  I don't know why so many others came out dry but mine was very moist and bouncy.  I was scared that it would be too rich but I used the buttercream icing recipe on here as well for a frosting and it was GREAT!!!
I would recommend this again and again with the buttercream frosting!

Wow!  This cake is amazing.  Dense and rich and moist, not too crumbly, not to heavy.  Perfect!  I did substitute 1/2 cup of the water for 1/2 cup Chambord Raspberry liquor in order to make a dark chocolate raspberry cake and it worked out perfectly.  In my opinion, this was the perfect substitution as the cake remains primarily chocolately but with a delicate raspberry finish.  I also used dutch processed cocoa.

Fabulous! I halved this recipe and made cupcakes, as I don't have any cake pans currently. Cupcakes came out light, fluffy and moist with a gorgeous rich chocolate flavor. Will definitely use this again and am looking forward to making a real chocolate layer cake with this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Not one of the better chocolate cake recipes out there...by any means. It did not seem to be sweet enough or even chocolaty enough and it also was very dry. I will keep my eyes out for the ultimate chocolate cake recipe but this definitely is not it.

OK - I don't know what those poor reviews did to their cakes - this is hands down the BEST chocolate cake recipe ever.
Word of caution that I've seen in other reviews: this cake is so moist it does fall apart easily, so get an extra set of hands to do your flipping. Regardless, I would eat this cake in pieces - it's so good it doesn't even need frosting!

I served this cake for a 4th of July picnic.  I couldn't believe how fast it went.  This cake was very moist and very chocolatey.  A chocolate lover's dream!!!  I frosted the cake with "Fudge Butter Cream Frosting", a recipe I retrieved off this website.  Both complemented each other very well.  I will definitely make this again.

This cake was fabulously moist and decadent!  I didn't have 3 cake pans the same size, so I just used what I believe was a 10 inch springform pan and had to bake it for approximately 45 minutes.  I was worried it would come out dry as others had mentioned, but it was so moist it almost tasted like a pudding-in-the-mix type cake.  Wonderful--can't wait to make it again:)

Personally I did not care for this cake.  I thought it was dry and just too much dark chocolate.  Easy to make though.

This is a great moist cake that holds up well. I've made it for school functions as well as a wedding and have gotten compliments each time. I highly recommend this cake for any occassion. It is in my "use regularly" recipe box.

This is my favorite choc cake recipe. I make it all the time. I make four layer caes with it. And i freze the cakes wen they are cooled for a while. It sets them and then when it comes to frosting, way easier. After it thaws it is perfect texture and looks great. I use Hersey's frosting recipe. Then shave choc over the top to give it a great look.

Absolutely delicious. Having read some of the other comments on this recipe, I decided to grease my cake pans, then line with wax paper, then grease again, and I had no trouble getting the cakes out of the pans. To prevent the dryness a few other cooks say they experienced, I preheated the oven to 350, then turned it down to 325 after I put the cakes in. I baked them for exactly 25 minutes and they were perfect - moist, rich, wonderful texture. And Carol's Chocolate Cheese Frosting recipe was great with it!

You must make this cake.  I will never make another chocolate cake.  This is by far the best there is.  It turns out very moist, light and chocolately.  I cut it into a heart shape and frosted it with the chocolate cream cheese frosting and topped it with fresh raspberries for Valentine's Day.  My boyfriend loved it and ate the rest for breakfast the next morning.

A good cake batter for all needs! I use generous coat of cooking spary on non-stick bake-ware and it come out perfect after slight cooling in the pan.
I have used it for layer cake, cup-cakes and mini-cup cakes.
I use only 2 cups of sugar, and the rest, just like the recipe.
Baking times: if you make 2 (thicker) cakes: 45 min
in muffin size: 15 minutes
mini muffin size: 10 minutes.

This is a fantastic recipe for a three-layer dark chocolate cake. To make it extra dark, I simply used Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Cocoa Powder and mixed that in with fresh-brewed coffee (instead of the boiling water). I used the "Special Buttercream Frosting" recipe on this site for the frosting and it created a sort of "cookies-and-cream" look for the cake which was fun. It was delicious and everyone loved it. This will definitely be my go-to chocolate cake recipe for the future. Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as written except in a 9x13x2 glass pan. Oh wow! It is just the right amount of chocolatey goodness. It was moist and not too dense. This will be made again many times I'm sure! Thanks!

The only chocolate cake I will make from scratch from now on.. I cream the butter and sugar together for a good 5 minutes.. The flavanols in cocoa are soo good for you, but MILK blocks their absorption so I was tickled that this recipe  uses water. I have made this several times for large family  birthday parties..I tripled the recipe to fit in a 12 x 18 x 2 inch.. Worked wonderfully

Fantastic! I used this as my Wedding Cake, layered with some yummy chocolate mocha mousse. 
We baked and frosted it a day and a half before and it was still rich and moist when we cut into it at the wedding. So Good!

Fail proof yummy. I got it backwards! I put the sugar and flour together (all the dry ingredients, in one bowl) when I realized what I did, I just plowed on through. I mixed the wet and combined them and said a little prayer, and the cake was heavenly!!!

I have made this cake twice within two weeks. Needles to say, my family loves this cake. It is very moist and decadent. Every time I make it there is not much left. I will not be going back to box mixes for chocolate cake again.

It seems like most people like this cake, but unfortunately I didn't. It smelled like I was making popcorn the whole time it was baking and even with all that sugar it wasn't sweet at all. I also didn't care for the aftertaste.

To virupsg, the recipe meant to add part of the flour mixture to the creamed mixture, mix it in then add part of the cocoa mixture to the creamed mixture and mix in. Continue adding each in small quantities to the creamed mixture until you have it all mixed together. Then put in pan.

I made this cake yesterday and thought the flavor was outstanding. I followed the recipe directions exactly and, like some other reviewers, the cake turned out very crumbly. It wasn't dry, though, just crumbly. I think the next time I make it, I will use oil instead of some or all of the water. Very good, but not quite 5 stars as is.

one of the best cakes i have ever made. i always get compliments on this one. It is very chocolaty, moist and airy. i hate tightly packed, hard and dry cakes and this is as far from that as you can get. i use the brownie frosting (from this website) on this cake and wait for it to dry and harden before covering it. it keeps well for many days.

This was pretty amazing!  I was kind of concerned with some of the negative concerns, but it turned out perfectly!  I distributed the batter between 3 - 9inch cake pans. I used a raspberry butter cream and chocolate gnache as the "icing on the cake"!

I made this last evening and it turned out EXCELLENT. I halved the recipe and made 12 cupcakes and a 10mm high 8 inch diameter round cake. I am waiting for these to get over and try to make more, more and more.

I loved this cake!!! It was very easy to make and nice because it's ingredients were all things I had in the house! It calls for 3 cake pans but I only had 2 so I filled two and used the left over batter for cupcakes! You should make this!!!!

Made this last week for my boyfriend and he loved it! I did not split it into 3 parts, however, I just baked it in one pan, it was still soft, moist and delicious and in my opinion goes great with a cup of coffee! :)

I am a lover of chocolate cake! While the taste of this cake was good, it was really dense, and more of a brownie consistency. I don't know if I didn't cream the butter/sugar long enough to get air in, or if it was something else. I creamed the butter/sugar for about 5 minutes and it was still dense. I may try this recipe again to see if I can get rid of the brownie texture.

This was delicious! I didn't have enough ingredients, so I cut the recipe in half, and even then I didn't have quite enough sugar and I had to sub some whole wheat flour. I was sure it would be a disaster, but they (I made cupcakes) turned out perfectly. It tasted EXACTLY like boxed cake mix... so if you want something better than cake mix, I'm not sure this is the recipe for you.

Turned out great... but didn't really follow any of the instructions, mixed it all with a wooden spoon in a bowl wet first dry second then mixed the two together. Only had 1 tin so 1/3 into that then I made mud pies with the rest of the mix in shallow 12 x tray got 18 and really quick to cook in hot oven, the digits have been rubbed out so oven set to just off max.
But brilliant cakes 5* all the way

It wasn't as great as the reviews made it out to be. My boyfriend loves brownies and all things chocolate but he didn't love this chocolate cake. it wasn't sweet enough for him. I tried it too and it was a good dark chocolate cake but it wasn't something I would make again.

Only 4 stars because this cake is a little dry for me. Other than it not being as moist as I hoped, it was very good. Nice dark chocolate taste and I love the fact that the ingredient list is simple. Thank you!

This is the BEST chocolate cake ever!! I substitute the 2 cups boiling water with buttermilk, and add the cocoa powder with the flower mixture. Then I mix it the same - best chocolate cake you will ever eat!! If you like dark cocoa, use special dark chocolate powder and up the sugar to 2 1/2 cups. SO DEVINE!

What I like most about this cake is that it doesn't stick to the pan at all! In terms of taste, however, I prefer something richer and more decadent. I halved the recipe and used 2 8-inch-pans instead. This is a good, plain, simple cake that would be delicious with a sauce, frosting, or even ice cream.

I've wanted to try out this recipe for several years,and finally had the chance this weekend.  I made cupcakes for my 3-year old's birthday, but found the cake overly dense without a lot of flavor.  I much prefer the Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe from this site.

Great texture, moistness, easy to make. I am "encouraging" a 15 year old to  bake and this was her choice for her birthday cake. made it today for the first time, and I highly recommend it for all ages. We put chocolate pudding  betwen layers. Very tasty. Will make this again for sure.

Okay, so I halved both recipes and made this cake and the Extreme Chocolate Cake in the same day so that I could better compare them. I, like many others, used hot coffee in place of boiling water to amplify the chocolate flavor. Both cakes have good qualities. If you are looking for a cake that is rich, moist, and almost fudgy, go with the Extreme Chocolate Cake. If you prefer cakes that are soft, fluffy, and not as chocolatey or sweet, then this recipe for Dark Chocolate Cake I is for you. I personally liked the Extreme Chocolate Cake better but my boyfriend preferred the Dark Chocolate Cake I hands down. I think I will try to experiment with the two recipes to come up with one that balances the flavor of the Extreme Chocolate Cake with the wonderful texture and stackability of the Dark Chocolate Cake I. Thanks for the recipe Carol!

I decided to make this one night because I wanted chocolate cupcakes but didn't have any box mix.  I will NEVER use a box mix again.  This was such an easy recipe to make and follow.  I cut it in half and it made 21 cupcakes (1/4 cup batter each). I only gave it 4 stars because it wasn't chocolaty enough for me, but maybe next time I will add mini chocolate chips.

Great cake! Amazing for decorating! It literally comes right out of the pans with ease, and does not crumble when you are trying to decorate it!

I wanted to make this cake taste like mocha chocolate so i added 2 tsp coffee grounds to enhance the chocolate flavour, 1/2 cup chocolate pudding mix, and 1/4-1/2 cup cocoa powder instead of a cup. :) It was sooo good! Very moist.

This has a wonderful taste!  However, I added a 3 oz. pkg of chocolate pudding mix and a dash of almond extract.  This cake was gone in little over an hour.

Exceptionally delicious! Remarkably outstanding! We couldn't get enough of this cake. Paired well with a simple sprinkle of powdered sugar or peanut butter frosting. Yum!

This cake was amazing! My sisters hate dark chocolate and said they didn't want any cake but had some and loved it. We all fought for the last peice! This cake is a definite keeper. The only bad thing about it was when we put it in a container, something happened with condensation and got peices too moist. But mostly the other pieces were delicious and just moist enough!

My 1st attempt at making a homemade cake from scratch was a success!  Not as time friendly as a cake mix but worth the extra work knowing that you made it yourself!  I baked the cake in a 11 x 17 pan for a birthday party and it was a success!  Not a crumb was left!  Will make again!

I will give this 3 stars for taste but I don't know why it was so dry.  It could be my fault, maybe I would sift flour and measure to make sure I don't put too much flour.  Also, maybe I cooked it a few minutes too long.  But, it was so dry and I made just as it said.  I bake a lot of cakes and love cakes.   Sad thing is, I've had way better so I won't try it again.  Sorry!

I can't give a true review because of my substitutions I used  sugar free applesauce for oil, splenda for sugar, and egg beaters for eggs. However it was delicious my diabetic father who actually hates "diet food" loved it, and so did my class who coudln't believe it, many asked for the recipe. It came out more like brownies but still very delicous!!!

Used this recipe for a Baptism cake and it was amazing. Everyone loved it. I took the suggestions of adding coffee instead of the water and then made a butter cream mocha frosting which by the way was also amazing. Highly suggest it!!

I made this cake for my buddies 25th bday. He is a chocolate lover like myself and let me tell you it was awesome. I took some of the suggestions on here and added 1cup hot coffee and 1 cup hot water. and the cake was perfectly moist and had great deep chocolate flavor. My girlfriend who hates chocolate (yes a girl who hates chocolate) loved it too. I also used the recipe Chocolate-Ganache-Icing with it and added a tiny bit of coffee liquor to it and OMG it was awesome. I would definitely suggest this recipe to anyone who is as much of a chocolate lover as myself.

While the cake was good, I can't say that it tasted much different from a moist Devil's Food cake out of a box. I suppose to make a box cake as dark as this one, one could add a little more unsweetened cocoa powder and reach the same effect. It was good, but not worth the effort when the same thing can be achieved with a box cake.

I made cupcakes with this recipe.  I didn't make any other changes to the recipe, and baked for 20 minutes.  Worked great with "Rich Chocolate Frosting" by A. Via (I cut that recipe in half and still had more than enough frosting).  Perfect birthday cupcakes!

Cake was good.  Greased the pan well, but the cake really stuck.  Would use some wax paper on the bottom before cooking in the future.

This cake is sooooo good.  The only changes I made were to use 1/2 c. butter flavored shortening & 1/2 c. butter to replace the full cup of butter.  I also added instant coffee to the boiling water.  Finally, I used a well-greased bundt pan and cooked it at 350 for 45 minutes.  The cake was moist and crumbly, very delicious.  I didn't have issues with the cake falling apart or sticking to the pan.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Beautiful texture, dense and moist.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  Made the cocoa(1 1/2 cups of special dark cocoa) mixture with coffee, sweetened that mixture wi/ a tablespoon of NuStevia extract.  Added cinnamon and a hint of chili pepper to make it a Mayan dark chocolate cake.  Est muy bueno!

Delicious, moist cake! I add 2 Cups chocolate chips for extra bursts of chocolate flavor.  Only complaint is that  the cake doesn't stay together very well. Tastes excellent.

This was a really good cake. It's not too sweet and it looks like you could do alot of alterations to it to fit your needs. I'm giving it a 4 because it is crumbly and broke in half when I tried stacking it into a two layer cake. I will definitely make this again. Through I will warn you, when you first make it, the cake seems really watery. It will bake up fine.

I made this for a party and someone who typically doesn't like cake proclaimed it was " good cake."  Other people told me it was even better the next day.  It makes a nice dense, moist cake.  I filled it with whipped cream and crushed oreos and frosted it with chocolate buttercream.  Will definitely make again.

Yummmy, delicious, decadent cake to make and eat. My 2 year old daughter and I made it last night. She enjoys baking with me.... lol.. she got more chocolate on her than in the bowl. lol.. .. It was really a delicious cake.. we used half white sugar and brown. I used fresh brewed strong coffee.... I was making this cake for my husband.. the chocolate lover...:)  I have made the Hershey cake from this site also.... but I like this cake recipe because it is a dense. chocolaty cake... holds better... I still like the Hershey cake for cupcakes....its fluffier.  I also made it in a bundt pan and it turned out great.. cooked it for 1hr. 1/2. I made a glaze also... I melted choc.chips and thinned it out with milk and added honey for shine.... and shaved some milk choc. on top... was a great cake.. thanx

This was easy to make and baked up great.  Somewhat moist with a good crumb.  Didn't have a lot of flavor though.  Tasted like a box mix/walmart cake.  The Hershey recipe has much better flavor.

Excellent! Made exactly as the recipe is written.  Great chocolate flavor, moist and not too sweet.  Some reviews said this cake was dense.  I thought it was just the oppsite - light and fluffy.  This is definitely a keeper.  I recommend using a good quality cocoa powder to produce a cake with good flavor, not one of the store brands like Hershey's.

Decadent, moist, and versatile.  I made according to the recipe and it held up well when made in three 8" layers that I split to make 6.

Wonderful, moist cake. I paired it with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting on this site. Very rich and delicious.

I made this for a baby shower and substituted a few things. Instead of coco, I used chocolate chips (melted) and about half a cup of water instead of two. Also I used about 1/2 or 1 cup less of white sugar due to the chocolate chips sweetness. The cake turned out great and was a huge hit. The one downside was that the sides rose too much and I'm trying to fix this. The entire cake was demolished and I didnt get a single slice!!!

LOVE this cake - I am in danger of eating the whole thing myself!  I made it for my family on a rainy day when i felt like baking.  I made it in a bundt pan, which takes an hour to bake, but it came out SOOO moist - it didn't need icing!  I just put a little sugar glaze on it.  I will make this again!

Awesome. I did use coffee for the water and separated the eggs and beat the whites until stiff. This cake was just as moist and tasty five days later than the day I made it although I did keep it refrigerated due to a chocolate whipped cream frosting. This recipe would be perfect for do-ahead wedding cake/cupcakes.

This was really good, and easy to make. I used coffee instead of the water. I fit most of the batter into two 9 in round pans, the rest of it I made into 2 cupcakes. I made the "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" from this site to put on it. So good.

I expected something different from a from-scratch cake, but it was very good. I would not take a star away because it did not match my expectations. It was delicious BUT it was nowhere near as fluffy and moist as cake mix cakes. I read that they actually coat the flour with oil in the cake mix and that's why it's so moist.

Very good cake!  Made it in a bundt pan instead of 3 shallow pans as I didn't have anything to make filling.  Cooked in a VERY greased bundt pan for 60 minutes, let cool for 20 and then extracted to a cooling rack.  Excellent!!

I made this cake for a Christmas party and it was a hit. I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out very moist and yummy. I also use the icing recipe from this site; One Minute Chocolate Icing. They did go well together. Many thanks for sharing this.

While it was more labor-intensive than other cakes I've tried, it tasted the best by far.  I think if I make it again it will be easier because I'll know what I'm doing.  It's absolutely delicious.

Not only was this cake dry and crumby, it was ridiculously difficult to work with.  I could not get the dang thing out of the pan without it breaking every 30 seconds.  I would recommend this recipe to NO ONE.  And I hope that in the future, when you decide to share a recipe, it is worthy of some sort of recognition other than just it being all around terrible.  Frankly, I found this cake utterly repulsive and unworthy of the time I spent trying to get it to work.  Because of the extreme grainy texture of this concoction, I was unable to even frost the thing, if it could even be called a thing, making the appearance grossly unappealing.  Further more, this cake was for my mom's birthday!  I had one shot, and because of these false rave reviews, I have produced none other than an abomination and a disgrace to the world of baking!  I have given this ONE star, simply because the batter could be considered edible.  Please, take a look at the lovely photo I have of this cake if you are still even considering making it.

I made this cake for the first time last night for my dad's birthday and it turned out great! I followed the recipe but added chocolate chips and baked it for at least an hour in a bunt pan. What really complemented it was a almond based cream I drizzled on top with some choco chips and crushed walnuts. I really recommend this recipe it comes out moist and perfect. I will definitely make this again. Everyone at the party loved it!

This cake just came out of the oven about 30 minutes ago, and all I can say is WOW! I used low-fat buttermilk in place of water, and folded in the egg whites last after beating them with a small amount of the sugar. The cake came out rich and moist, but still fluffy, and has a perfect chocolate taste. It's just sweet enough that you could get away with skipping the frosting if you wanted to, but it won't become overpoweringly sweet with frosting on it. This one's a keeper!

I have never been a chocolate cake fan. But this cake is delicious! I made it with 1 cup of Kahlua and one cup of starbucks Verona coffee. did a crumb layer with Nutella hazelnut spread, and another hazelnut layer in the middle. used Chocolate icing, and shaved chocolate on top.

I first made this for my son and nephew's birthday. Since then I have made almost every week because everyone loved it so much and has ordered it for pretty much every party. It was fantastic and now I can stop looking for the perfect recipe. This is it!!! Did not have to make any changes. It is great as is. Thank you!

I expected this scratch cake to taste better than a box mix, but I like my box mix cake just as well and this one I had trouble with sticking to the pan which I never do with my box cake.  I'll keep looking for a great chocolate cake recipe.

I chose this recipe after I read the review from the pastry chef despite the other negative reports. Bad choice!   It took longer than the 30 minutes for a toothpick to come out right in the middle and by that time, the cake was dried out. My cake was so dry I threw it out.

This is a great chocolate cake recipe.  Like the others recommended I used a cooking spray that had flour mixed in and covered the cake pans.  I used cake flour instead of regular flour and still siffed the flour,powder, baking soda and salt well together. And I substituted herseys special dark powder instead of the regular cocoa powder.  I had to extend my cooking time by 10 minutes due to the centers were undone.  I did turn down the temperature to 320 so I would not dry or burn the rest of the cake.  It came out so light and fluffy with the perfect chocolate taste!  I did use the cream cheese frosting II as a crumb coat and the chocolate ganache recipe from this website.

This was an excellent dark chocolate cake! It reminded me of an oreo as I used a butter cream frosting.  I thought it was even better the next day when it had been refridgerated overnight! This one is a keeper!

halved the recipe and made 7 jumbo cupcakes and 6 mini cupcakes. Shaved some dark chocolate and put on top of batter before baking. Mini cupcakes were done in 14 minutes, probably could have taken them out earlier like around 12 minutes. The Jumbo cupcakes were closer to 20 minutes. Delicious.

I made this cake twice , in metal pans and then silicone after care of the pans the cake crumbled at the bottom.  I've used over 30 recipes from this site, this is the only one that failed. Would not try again.

Very easy, very chocolaty! I had all of the necessary ingredients in my pantry. Makes enough batter for one half sheet cake. I will make this again, my family loved it. Fun to make with kids!

My 9 yr old Grand daughter made this cake and it was excellent. I put a copy of the recipe in her pocket, to take home. She will make it often, I sure.

I made this for a birthday, I love it. Intense flavour and great fun to make combining the mixtures. Whip those eggs a good 5 minutes all fluffy and beautiful. My cake turned out moist enough but I highly recommend adding moisture with a topping. I had one problem but don't think it's the fault of the recipe- I took advice to grease pans well, the edges of my cake were crisp and hard! Will try again as a more 'managable' (cutting and serving size) two layer black forrest cake and I'll re-review. I think this cake will be heaven with cherry sauce soaked in.

This recipe make one huge, moist, rich, decadent chocolate cake. 3 layers of chocolate heaven. I added one tablespoon of instant coffee to the chocolate/water mixture and I used cake flour instead of A.P. I frosted it with Rich Chocolate Frosting from Allrecipes and polished off a piece for dinner tonight. I usually don't replace an entire meal with dessert but this was worth it. Bravo!!!

Wow, this is the best from scratch chocolate cake recipe I have ever made!  I will use this from now on!  I went right by the recipe and it came out perfect.  The right amount of chocolate and the perfect consistancy.  I frosted it with chocolate frosting...so yummy! I wouldn't change a thing.  Much better than a boxed mix!

This was great!  I was looking for a homemade cake recipe that didn't call for buttermilk or chocolate squares, as I had neither on hand.  This did the trick!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this cake for my mom's birthday using vegan butter substitute (and a simple vegan chocolate frosting), and it was *phenomenal*! I think the coffee was an excellent substitution for the hot water, and created a level of flavor that had my mom wondering if I'd spiked the batter with liqueur(!). I also ended up using a very high quality cocoa powder, which may have helped, and used 2/3 of the recipe to create a 2-layer cake with berry-frosting in the middle that seeped into the cake and made it absolutely decadent. I love how Allrecipes has my family convinced I'm a baking pro!

My cake came out a bit chewy.  Maybe I mixed it too long.  I made it as a Valentine's Day cake for my boyfriend and he seemed to like it though.  I just would have liked for it to come out more moist, soft, and cakey than dense and chewy.

I will never make another chocolate cake recipe, although I did alter this one a tiny bit by using only 1 1/2 c hot water, whisking chocolate in, and then adding 1/2 c buttermilk.  Also, jumbo size eggs help.

The best chocolate cake I have ever made! I made a thick 4 layered birthday cake and it turned out amazing! It wasn't too sweet and it was definitely moist. I finished this cake with the Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting recipe found on this site too! I will never use cake mix in a box ever again!

With my secret ingredient of a teaspoon of tapioca starch for extra moisture this is "THE chocolate cake" recipe. Found it here and will use it forever. Everyone comments on how good this is in cupcake or cake form, even whoopie pies and swiss chocolate rolls!

Followed others' directions to cream sugar and buttter for atleast three min.  I also used cake flour and sifted in a small box of cook and serve chocolate pudding. Used the one minute chocolate icing (double batch), but didn't allow it to set up. Made holes in the cake so it could soak in. Just had a piece (still warm), so awesome.

Followed the recipe.Came out excellent.I usually don't like chocolate cake that much.But today I just had some craving for chocolate.And I was surprised with the taste of this cake(I halved the recipe and made 6 jumbo size cupcakes and baked for almost 35 minutes).Moist,not too sweet,delicate.Probably will be really good with some frosting(I skipped extra calories).

This would be 10 stars if they had it!  It was the best cake, chocolate or otherwise, I've ever eaten.  I made it for my sister's birthday--she loves chocolate cake and chocolate icing.  I was concerned as I read reviews that said it was dry.  It was the moistest cake ever!  I took the suggestion to cream the sugar and butter for 2 minutes.  My cocoa mixture sat for at least two hours while I was waiting for a pumpkin pie to bake so it was thoroughly cooled.  I whisked it again before I started incorporating it.  Once I got all the wet and dry ingredients incorporated, I then beat it for an additional 2 minutes (like all box cakes say to do).  Oh, I have dark, non-stick pans and reduced the temperature to 330 degrees.  Since I only own two 9 inch pans, I made 12 cupcakes with the additional batter.  My husband and I both dislike chocolate cake but we both ate several pieces; everyone else loved it! Awesome!

Instead of making a 3 layer cake, I made cupcakes. This recipe made a total of 29 cupcakes, filling the liners 3/4 of the way full. I reduced cooking time to 20 minutes. The only other change I made was to use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup margarine beings this is all I had on hand. This is a great recipe! The kids loved the cupcakes this recipe made! Thank you for sharing

PERFECT!  Just how I like it.  Chocolate, dense, not too sweet.  I love this cake and it holds up well for all frosting, filling  or decorating.  I follow exact directions.  Forgot to use the coffee in place of hot water.  The coffee really inhances the chocolate so use it.  Last night I just made a dark chocolate butter cream for frosting and filing and as always the cake was loved by all.

This was an execllent cake! 

I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used espresso instead of coffee.  I also let the coffee cool completely.  I forgot to add the chocolate chips but it didn't need it. 

I did let the cakes cool completely and they came out of the pans very easily.

I used red raspberry jam in between the layers and chocolate frosting.  It was to die for!

Very disappointing after the rave reviews.  I am sure I followed directions carefully, and this was the worst cake I have ever made.  I sure wish I had succumbed to temptation to be fast and made a box mix--it would have been much better.  It was heavy and no one liked it.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and it turned out beautifully!  I followed the recipe exactly exccept for the eggs, which I separated and then whipped the whites into soft peaks with a little of the sugar and folded in later.  I frosted it with the following buttercream frosting: 2 c milk, 1/2 c flour cook until thick, then cool.  Cream together 2 c butter and 2 c white sugar.  Add cooled milk mixture and 2 teaspoons vanilla, beat until fluffy.  I frosted the cake with this frosting and put sliced strawberries in between the layers and on top.  Then I put cake in refrigerator for frosting to set up.  Absolutely wonderful!!!  Definitely my chocolate cake recipe from now on!!!

This cake was good, a little tedious, but pretty tasty.  Unfortunately the frosting I used ruined it so that's probably having an effect on it.  I'll most likely give it another shot.  Do you have any suggestions on a good frosting to compliment this cake?  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious cake! I followed the recipe to a T and made it into 'fauxtess cupcakes' with cream filling and ganache icing. They were quickly gobbled up!

I wanted a chocolate cake for my boyfriends birthday and I chose this one. . .  the story went that i split the batter into 2 and the first batch sunk in the middle but the second came out perfect! (i have no idea what i did!) Everyone loved this cake and I have given the recipe to three of my friends already! (one a chef!) The sunk cake did not go to waste... heated up with some ice cream and it was amazing! 

Thank you very much for this! A definite keeper! :)

This was good, but not exceptional in my opinion. I used coffee instead of water and I think this really intensified the taste...in a good way. It was a little on the dry side the next day. Interestingly enough I thought it tasted best right out of the oven without the frosting!

This chocolate cake is outstanding!  I used it to make cupcakes, and it yielded a ton.  They cook up quickly, so keep an eye on them (mine were done in 15-20 minutes on 350).  I am not a huge chocolate fan, but for some reason I can't stop eating these!  I filled one batch with "Cool Whipped Frosting" and topped with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze."  The other batch I topped with "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting," all from this site.  Both were delicious, thank you!

This was a superb cake. It was firm enough to cover with fondant, and moist enough that the raves kept coming. excellent recipie.

My suggestion - this cake, cherry filling, and white chocolate butter cream frosting (marshmallow fondant if you're adventurous!) - both frostings flavored with almond extract with bring out the cherry in the filling.


- I used this cake once more recently, this time - I added a bag of semi-sweet mini chocolate chips! MMM!!!

Make sure to thoroughly mix cake otherwise you get a "crunchiness"

Not too sweet.

Make sure to cool all the way! Otherwise it crumbles out of the pan.

I served this cake as we sat down to watch a movie. I didn't hear the first several minutes of the movie because my Mom was raving so much about the cake! Hubby loved it too. It was light and tender and the kind you like to mash your fork around the plate to get every crumb. I used Creamy Cream Cheese Frosting as the filling and a vanilla butter cream cheese icing. This is great cake!

An excellent cake! I made it for my mother's birthday and everyone loved it. I used skim milk heated to the point of boiling rather than water. Next time I will try substituting coffee for the water. It wasn't dry at all - just be sure not to use Dutch processed cocoa because it can cause it to dry out if the recipe doesn't call for it. I followed the advice of a earlier reviewer and lined the cake pans with parchment that I sprayed with vegetable spray. I used a cream cheese-pecan frosting. Very yummy!

To keep your cake from sticking to the pan, before you grease the pan, measure it and cut a piece of wax paper that fits the  bottom of the pan.  After you grease the pan with spray or butter, press on the circle of wax paper. Then pour in the batter. When cakes come out of the over, peel the wax paper off - no stick!
I also changed the water to room temperature milk.
And, I sifted the cocoa powder with the flour mixture.  
Milk made it tastier and the wax paper and sifting made it easier to do.

This cake was really good. Light and fluffy, not too sweet. Not overly moist, but not dry either. I used baking powder, as I didn't have baking soda.

This cake came out WONDERFULLY. It was rich, dense, moist, and delicious! The texture is somewhere between a brownie and cake. I used this recipe to make my take on a black forest cake. I  substituted the water with coffee too. Absolutely fantastic! I'm keeping this recipe for all the chocolate cakes I make in the future!

This tasted more like brownies than cake to me, only not as fudgey or chocolate tasting. I wouldn't say it was bad, just not what I was looking for in a cake. It was fun to make though, thanks! :]

this cake had a great flavor and texture but honestly it wasn't the best chocolate cake I've ever had. I found it a little bland. I'm not sure what it was exactly but it lacked oomph. Maybe a knock out frosting would help? I didn't find it that rich at all.

I loved it a lot! Baked it for Valentines' Day and my friends and family loved it too. They thought I bought it! It's not too sweet and it melts in your mouth. I cut down on the sugar though and melted some chocolate with a bit of butter and water and spread it over the top. It was superb. Only problem is, if you plan to save it for the day after, it doesn't taste as nice after being refrigerated. The cake loses its moisture. Thanks for sharing. Easy to make and it's just great.

This turned out great.  I used a large rectangular pan and just monitored the cooking time.  Everyone enjoyed it with the peanut butter frosting.  The texture is quite different than a cake mix texture.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for - a melt-in-your-mouth moist chocolate cake. Creaming the butter and sugar for 2 mins was key, I think. I didn't have the patience to wait for the cocoa mixture to cool so I kept it in the fridge while mixing the other ingredients and then added an ice cube to finish cooling.  Halved the recipe to make a single (fat) layer 9 inch cake.  Baked for 30 mins, lined in parchment, and it turned out perfect.  Looking for a fudge filling/icing recipe to kick it up another notch!

I am happy to say that I made this the night before and it was a big hit. Everyone thought it tasted like a professionally made cake!  It is dark and dense but it turned out perfect.  I did have to bake it 5 extra mins because it wasn't set in the middle. Other than that it was Fab!
Will make again for sure.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I have tried!  It is so moist...I usually make a two layer cake from 9" rounds, and use the rest of the batter to make cup cakes.  So good that you don't even need icing (although I use chocolate fudge icing - my husband is a huge iceing fan), even better the next day!

I made this cake batter last night and put it in mini-bundt pans. Then I made a chocolate glaze with confectioner's sugar, unsweetened cocoa, milk, a dash of cream, and orange extract. The cake itself tasted fluffy and very much like dark chocolate. It melts in your mouth. 

This recipe is a great starting off point in creating some very nice desserts. I think that adding coffee would be nice, but this would be great paired with rasberry sauce, liquor and glaze.

Wow! This cake was so good! Nobody in my family or my husband's family really likes cake, but they all LOVED this one! The cake was so moist, and not too sweet. I put chocolate cream cheese frosting on it, which was a good choice!

this recipe did not turn out well at all. I did exactly what it said and it turned out dry and crumbly. I tried putting frosting out it and it just cracked. I will not be making this recipe again.

The cake is very moist and soft! Has a good bitter taste but still not chocolatey enough. Baking took much longer than anticipated and serving size is huge! 

Modifications to recipe: less sugar, used half milk half water, replaced some cocoa powder with milo powder

This one is a keeper!  I made it into cupcakes, and got more than 3 dozen out of the batter. 17 minutes was enough time for mine to be done.  They are light and moist and extremely easy.  The batter tasted yummy too.  I followed the recipe exactly, and love the results.  This is going to be my tried-and-true chocolate cake/cupcake recipe from now on.  I am topping my cupcakes with chocolate ganache and the icing from "Chocolate Torte" (also on this site).

Was a good cake, moist, and chocolatey.  I had all the ingredients already, which made it nice. I also baked it in a bundt pan for 45 minutes and it came out great except next time not only will I grease my pan but will flour it too.  I did notice that when I brought my water to a boil it was reduced quite a bit so be sure to measure after it boils.

So, I decided to make the Better Than Sex cake with the Dark Chocolate Cake 1 as the base.  I wrote down all of the ingredients on a shopping list but lost internet access before I could get the directions.  I also ran out of flour, so I used a little less.  I used milk instead of water.  I make the dark choc cake in two layers.  Unfortunately, I didnt know how to make the better than sex cake topping.  I ended up putting the condensced milk, caramel, whipped topping and half of the toffee candy on the stove and then drizzled it on each layer with some more of the toffee candy sprinkled on top.  The cake ended up very, very rich.  My boyfriend loved it!

This cake was okay. it was moist, but a little spongey for me. Not very chocolatey. The cream cheese icing I used made the cake better. I could find better cake, however, in a bakery.

Turned out well, easy to make, but really nothing special. Although it was a decent and moist chocolate cake, it really just tasted like a cake mix cake - it didn't have that "homemade" taste.  Although that's not necessarily bad, I suppose.

Simply the best! SOOOOOO easy and SO delicious! I'm by no means a "good cook" and mine turned out perfectly moist and chocolately. The best chocolate cake I've ever had! Whoever's cake was dry- you might want to try again! I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was FANTASTIC! Will make again & again and take ALL the credit for it ;)

Thanks for posting this!

This was wonderful, so moist.  To the reviewer who had to add applesauce because of dryness- you probably just cooked it too long, I did that the first time.  I also always line my pans for easier release.  Was wonderful, will use forever!

Very good! I loved the fact that this wasn't sickeningly sweet. I only had two pans to use---three layers would have been disastrously big, I think---so I upped the baking time to about 30 minutes and took them out when the very middle was still somewhat "gloopy" and set them on the counter. They finished cooking that way. Do try it with Carol's Cream Cheese frosting.

This recipe gets 10 stars from me. This recipe is unbelievably easy to make for a beginner like myself trying out cake recipes. The cake came out moist and was heavenly! I didn't change a thing with the recipe, except that I didn't have large eggs, so I used 5 medium eggs instead. Wasn't sure how big the cake would turn out, but it was just right for the Mickey Mouse head pan I intended to use and baked it for a total of 40-45 mins. For the frosting, I made chocolate ganache - this made the cake very rich but really good especially for chocolate-olics. For the chocolate ganache, I used 1 lb semi-sweet chocolate, 2 cups whipping cream, 4 TBSPs light corn syrup, 1 TBSP vanilla extract and 3 TBSPs butter. I whipped 3/4 of the ganache for the layers and the rest, poured over the chocolate. Everyone loved the cake and my cousins had seconds. My mom, who bakes cakes often for orders and always critics anything I make in the kitchen, said this was really good, that she asked for the recipe! So that made me really happy!

I made this cake for Christmas instead of the traditional "chocolate log" cake.  I made it in three layers and used chocolate fudge icing.  I decorated it with removable greenery with red berries and it was beautiful under it's glass dome and it was delicious!  Don't let it cook too long and please use parchment or waxed paper to peel off at the end.. you won't be sorry for the extra effort.

I made this fabulous cake for my new son-in-law's birthday -- what a hit!  I would suggest not changing a thing with the recipe.  It is the best chocolate cake I have ever had.  And the Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting was wonderful.  The cinnamon livened the chocolate flavor with a zip!  Thanks Carol for sharing this gem.

This Dark Chocolate cake was awesome.  My husband wanted a Betty Crocker Chocolate Cake but I had found this recipe and decided to bake it.  It turned out so delicious, HE LOVED IT.  This was my first time baking a cake from scratch.  My husband doesn't want Betty Crocker now.  I will keep baking this cake.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was simple to make & turned out so delicious & moist!  For once, I actually followed the recipe exactly as written.  I had baked it & frosted it with the Chocolate Cheese Frosting (also found on this site, submitted by Carol) the night before my husband's birthday dinner party.  Then I had placed the cake on a glass cake holder w/ the glass dome cover on my kitchen counter overnight.  I was worried that the frosting would go bad overnight b/c it wasn't refrigerated.  However, our guests, my husband, & I were pleasantly surprised by how beautiful, delicious, & moist the cake was!  They couldn't stop raving over it!  I will definitely make this cake again!

This had to be the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. My whole family (and in-laws) loved it. I frosted it with Carol's Chocolate Cheese Frosting and it complimented it perfectly. I did use a suggestion from a rating below to line the pans with wax paper and the cakes came out of the pans effortlessly. This is now our new family favorite.

Fabulous!  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings to make cupcakes (I ended up w/ 13).  Moist, deep chocolate, delicious!  They're great unfrosted.  I can't wait for an excuse to make the cake with Carol's chocolate cream cheese frosting!!

What can I say.  I LOVE this cake.  I made it for my daughter's first birthday party.  It went over very well.  very moist and chocolatey. It tastes just as good without the icing.

This a great chocolate cake recipe. I used dutch processed cocoa rather than regular and it gave it a wonderful dark chocolate flavor. I've never been able to do a layered cake because the cake always stuck to the pan, but thanks to the suggestion below to line the pans with wax paper, it turned out perfect!

I cater, and there is no telling how many times I have made this PERFECT chocolate cake recipe. Tip: if you want to prepare days or hours ahead, mix the water and cocoa and place it in the fridge until you are ready to use it. Another reason I like this cake is because I do not have to trim the cake's top...it always cools flat, so there is no waste. I will never use another chocolate cake recipe again...this one is the absolute best.

I made this as a birthday cake with my own chocolate buttercream icing recipe and it turned out great!!  I got rave reviews about it - everybody said that it was the best chocolate cake they have every had!  It is a nice light cake, not too sweet.

This cake tastes great! *VERY* moist and dark. *Really* tasty. It wasn't too sweet, just right with a vanilla icing. This one's a keeper. :)

this was amazing. It was also the only recipe I could find that didn't call for milk, which is why I made it in the first place. But from now on I won't be baking any other recipe.
it tastes GREAT with cream cheese frosting, also homemade ofc, but definitely try that!
thank you thank you thank you for making it possible to surprise my husband with an early valentine's day cake without keeping milk in the fridge lol

At our home, this cake is called "The Birthday Cake".  Everyone wants it for their birthday. It is easy to make and super delish!
Make sure to bake it for 20 minutes and then check every three minutes.  It does dry out.
Also, as stated before, be sure to use parchment paper in the bottom of your greased and floured pans!  Very important!!
I use "Chocolate Frosting I" for the frosting and it is great!  The consistancy and quantity is sometimes tricky, though.  Quantity is just a little short.
Thank you, Carol!

Brilliant recipe!  I too used coffee (very strong) in place of water, turned out gorgeous.  If you learn anything in cookery school, it is that SIMPLE can be the BEST at times, and this recipe warrants both titles!  Absolutely perfect.  Thanks for recipe addition to my ever growing collection.

Everyone in my family requests this for their birthday cake EVERY YEAR. I've had friends walk out the door scooping the leftovers into a to go cup at the end up a party, begging me to send them the recipe. They love it. I don't like cake, but I love this cake.

This recipe is really good. It's tastes amazing and it's really moist. My only problem is that it completely fell apart when I tried to take it out of my pan. Any hints on how to NOT make a cake stick? That'd be great.

Rich and dark, but not too dense. Loved it. Whipped whites separately and folded in. Otherwise, made to recipe.

made this cake into a 2 layer cake and 10 cupcakes, for a father's day dessert for my dad.  i added some raspberry mousse to the middle and topped it off with some ganache.  needless to say i found a cake my dad and brother couldn't stop eating, so i won't have to look at any more recipes.

I absolutely loved this recipe! It is so easy to make and everyone at my work loves it later today I will be teaching to 5 students because it is so easy. I tried this with a cream cheese frosting ad turned out very well. It is so easy to cut and very little crumbs. Just amazing!

Amazing chocolate cake recipe! First time I made this cake, I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! The second time I did 1 cup of boiling water and 1 cup of strong fresh brewed coffee to bring out more of the chocolate flavor! Perfect!

I made this cake for a friend's birthday and it was wonderful!  Everyone loved it!  I made one sort of accidental substitution, I used butter flavored Crisco +2 tbls of water instead of butter, I'd been reading through a bunch of recipes and couldn't remember what was needed when I went shopping.  The cake was moist and delicious, with a rich, but not too sweet, chocolatey flavor.  I frosted it with Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site and with my own buttercream recipe, I also filled it with a blackberry filling to cut the chocolate upon chocolate.  It was a huge hit!

I doubled the recipe to make a 12x17" sheet cake for my daughter's baby shower and it was wonderful.  As others suggested, I did add a packet of instant coffee and used half regular cocoa and half dark cocoa.  I saw the reviews that said it stuck to the bottom of the pan so I used cake release (look in the cake decorating section or a hobby store) and had no problems or the funny crusting that you get sometimes with the grease and flour sprays.  I also stored it in the freezer for a couple of days to maintain/increase moisture. My learning experience during this was that a cake that size needs a piece of plywood under the cake board. I covered it with a pretty piece of fabric and it made the final product even prettier.

I have tried many chocolate cake recipes and this one is definately the best. The texture is perfect if the directions are followed properly. I've tried whipping the egg whites but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I do use dutch process cocoa and strong coffee in place of the water. It gives the cake a deeper, more rich chocolate flavor. It actually  gets better the day after you bake it (if it lasts that long!) The flavor really gets more intense after sitting overnight under some frosting. About the cake getting a dome in the middle, bake at 325, don't overfill the pan, and I use bake even strips for anything bigger than an 8" pan.

This is my o to chocolate cake recipe. I make cakes as a side business and hobby for birthdays, graduations, etc,,and this cake always comes out moist, but durable. The taste is fantastic.  As another user said, the cake is much better if you substitute the water for other liquids. I always use 1 cup of hot coffee in place of the two cups of boiling water, and mix the cocoa in with that, and then use 1 cup of buttermilk added in to the rest of the ingredients. Amazing!

I made the recipe, but re-made it adding and extra Egg Yolk & 1 Cup of Sour Cream.  When adding the eggs one at a time, I just added the extra yolk last.  After the last of the cocoa mixture was blended in, I slowly mixed the Sour Cream in until thoroughly blended. Baked at the same 350 degrees but for about 5 minutes longer. Made sure a toothpick came out clean.  This addition of a yolk & sour cream helps add moisture and makes it a richer cake with a bit more density. Try it with a Cream Cheese Frosting! 
Four Stars as is, but 5 stars with my upgrade.

It was indeed dark and pretty easy to make. 
It made a lot of cake and I couldn't be bothered frosting, so I just dusted some powdered sugar on top. I was good, but I think it need frosting to be 5 star.

The DH said it all as he savored the last forkful of this cake,"HEAVENLY"....I did not change the method, however I did make a few small changes which I am certain "did not" make any difference in the wonderful texture of the cake. I used white whole wheat flour, 1 cup freshly ground & brewed french roast coffee & 1 cup vanilla almond milk (heated). Instead of butter,Spectrum non-hydrogenated all vegetable shortening. I baked the cake in 9x13x3 stoneware lined with unbleached parchment paper with no sticking after cooling completely. Stored overnight in airtight container in fridge. It is not "crumbly" or "lacking on moisture" or any of the unmpteen other negative adjectives I read in the reviews. I used my Kitchen-aid for mixing and convection feature on my oven for 30mins. If I had chosen to frost it obviously wouldn't have been a problem and I would have placed the cake in the freezer for a bit prior to that step. Maybe others with frosting problems should have done that. Oh, we used a dollop of Truwhip on some pieces which is a healthful alternative to Cool Whip (no GMO's or all the other nasty stuff including high fructose corn syrup)& it tastes more like a rich whipped topping should. So cheers to you Carol for a very easy recipe with room to "tweak" or just as written....decadent and chocolicious!!!! Thank You;)

I applaud you and this cake! Its fluffy and moist. Also  most of the popular chocolate cake recipes on here are plagiarizing the Hershey's chocolate cake recipe, which i found to be pretty disappointing... to finish it off, I cut the cake in half and placed sliced strawberries on the top and in the middle with some whipped cream. Thank you for this recipe its delicious!

This is a good chocolate cake recipe - moist with good texture. I made half the recipe resulting in 18 cupcakes.  Next time I would add some espresso powder to enhance the chocolate flavor.

I have made this recipe about five times, and I've tweaked a few things here and there.  EVERY single time I make it, it tastes like the kind of thing they'd be serving in fine dining!  

Listen, I've tried to bake other things, and always failed miserably, but for this cake, it always turns out amazing!

My tweaks:  I recommend using two cups of dark roast coffee when mixing the cocoa instead of water, as well as a hair more vanilla extract, about 1/8 cup less white sugar, and sometimes i use about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Oh, and in a pinch it still tastes great with margarine, though of course don't skimp out; use butter (even salted is yummy)!

*Usually layered with a homemade vanilla icing, though i've tried many different storeboughts.

This is definitely the best chocolate cake recipe I've made. I'm making it for the second time this week. I took another reviewer's recommendation and separated the eggs and whipped the egg whites until soft peaked, and folded them after the rest of the batter was finished. The batter looks so delicious and velvety before it goes in the oven. Other people said it was dry and crumbly but mine was far from either. They were quite moist and (not sure how to describe this) firm but not dense. So good!!

This is a good recipe, the cake has a nice chocolate flavor without being overly sweet. I made this recipe as written, except I replaced one of the cups of boiling water with very hot coffee, to get a richer, darker flavour. Baked in two pans instead of three for a double layer cake, and had no trouble with it coming out of the pan as others have mentioned. I did grease the pans and lined the bottom with greased parchment paper, worked perfectly once the cake had cooled it came right out.  It is a very dense cake however, so if you're looking for a light, moist cake this is not your recipe. It's almost like a chocolate pound cake, it is so heavy.  4 stars instead of 5 because it was so dense, not a bad thing just unexpected. I will use this recipe again.

I love this recipe. I bake a LOT including wedding cakes and this recipe is my go to since the first time I tried it years ago! It really lets the chocolate shine in a not overly sweet way and you can customize with frosting and fillings without it being overkill. I usually cut down on a cup of sugar to count the frosting. If the cake should stand on it's own (which it can!)- leave both cups. I switch out applesauce for butter when I want to save some calories. Works well too!

I made this recipe for a friend of mine at work that has a dairy, corn and soy allergy.  I replaced the butter with Spectrum Organic Shortening (Made with organic palm oil). It came out AMAZING.  Other than the butter substitute, I made it exactly as written.  Cake was moist and not dense at all.  Perfect for cupcakes.

I cut the recipe to fit one pan.  It came out very much like a brownie.  It was pretty good for a brownie, which I topped with ice cream and whipped cream, but it definitely didn't come out like cake.

I made a 6 serving size of this recipe to make 13 cupcakes for my son's 8th birthday. Used Pastry chef "ZZZORBA" suggestion and replaced 1/2 of the water for Buttermilk. You will need some of the boiling water to mix with the cocoa powder, let it cool then add your buttermilk. Half of the above recipe made about 13 cupcakes which I baked for about 15 minutes @ 350.  We will be enjoying this recipe for many special events to come!

I had to make a last minute cake for my grandson. Of course, it had to be chocolate. So I decided to cut the recipe in half and make cupcakes. The only thing I changed was I added 1 cup of sour cream ( sour cream makes it light and fluffy). It turned out wonderful!

Absolutely delicious, and not the least bit dry as some have claimed. I used fresh-brewed coffee instead of boiling water to add even more richness to the cocoa. I was out of granulated sugar, so I substituted 1.75 cups powdered sugar for every 1 cup granulated, and it turned out just fine, possibly even smoother than it might have. I used a brownie topping recipe as a filling (2/3 cup softened butter, 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tbsp honey, 2 tsp vanilla extract, 1&1/4 cup confectioners' sugar; warmed slightly for easier frosting, allowed to cool before adding layer) and lightly frosted with whipped cream. This will be my go-to chocolate cake base from now on!

This is a super recipe. The cake is moist and tender, and has excellent chocolate flavor. It's also sturdy which is why I chose it, as I'm making a cross cake that I intend to cover with buttercream and fondant. I will use this recipe often.

Absolutely delicious and easy cake. Fine, tender texture. I didn't cream the sugar and eggs together, I accidentally just mixed the sugar in with the flour and other dry ingredients, and it still turned out magnificent. My only complaint is it pulls apart really easily when applying frosting. It's so tender it falls apart.

By far the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever used. I use this on its own, or as a base layer for another cake I make and I always get compliments on it. There is not one thing I have changed in the recipe either. It doesn't even need icing it's so good just on it's own!

This cake is AMAZING- so moist. I use coffee in place of the water, it really brings out the flavor of the chocolate without overpowering it. Great with chocolate frosting but my favorite is cream cheese frosting on this one. This has become my signature recipe for birthday cake.

I just made this cake and tasted it. I'm not a chocolate lover by no means but I really like this cake. It's really tasty and I will make it in the future when I need something like this. The only change I made was that I cut the sugar to 1 3/4 cups because I  don't need a dessert to be too sweet. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! I did it in a bundt pan and melted white chocolate over the top afterwards. It was a hit! It's rich, in a great way, not over the top.

This was the best cake I have ever made!  And only because once I started mixing I realized how many things I was out of I made a few substitutions with perfect success:

I only had one stick of butter so I added a half cup of natural applesauce.

I was short one egg so I added a tablespoon of mayonnaise.

Because someone recommended it and I'm obsessed, I substituted brewed coffee for the water.

So perfect!!

Yummy!  The cake was a tiny bit crumbly, but we were very happy.  It was our first homemade chocolate cake.  We were sure to beat the butter and sugar for over 3 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  It turned out great!

This cake was really good.  I substituted self-rising flour in place of the all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt and it turned out great! Very moist.  The perfect chocolate cake.

I am giving this cake 5 yummy stars, 'cause it was just downright good. 5 stars for easiness, 'cause it was a very simple recipe with everyday ingredients. The only 4 star part of this recipe was that it didn't have a frosting recipe with it. But I did some looking and I found a super easy yummy Chocolate Mousse Frosting on a different recipe, which brought the recipe from a five star to a ten star. If you want the mousse recipe it was called, "Chocolate Mousse Cake" and it was put on All Recipes by Eagle Brand. And I just used the mousse part of the recipe as the cake on the recipe was a box mix. I would recommend you make it ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge for several hours if not overnight, as this made the cake more moist and the mousse was able to set. Also, I would make a double batch of the mousse next time, as my family loved it and there was just enough to put a thin layer in the center and on the edges, and it would be nice to put a thicker layer over the whole cake.

This was a great simple cake recpie. It was moist, and light. I did think that the chocolate flavor could have been a little stronger. I will make it again but i will try different brands of chocolate to see if that will help, also i do not have 3 round pans so i baked it in a 13-9-3 in pan the edges were a little over cooked but the rest of the cake was great. My three year old and i put it together in no time at all.  I am still going to lool for a super chocolatie cake though, but i will hold onto this as a back up

Absolutely wonderful cake to make. Easy. Did not sink or stick. 

I used Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate and it adds such a rich flavor compared to regular cocoa. 

I did not cool the boiling water/cocoa mix fully, but it didn't matter-- still turned out great.

I added a little extra vanilla bean extract. 

Baked in a 350 preheated oven for 29 minutes. 

Be sure to grease your pans! I used aluminum round pans sprayed with Baking Pam spray and then coated with a thin coat of flour. Worked like a CHARM. No sticking. 

The cake is moist and fluffy. Absolutely delicious. Make it!

I just made it for the first time today, and I followed the recipe exactly, more or less, and the cake turned out really flat and hard, with the sugar/butter cream oozing out. One possible mistake might be that I just waited about 5 or 10 minutes for the cocoa mixture to cool before adding the flour. Also, I'm not sure what it means by "alternatively" adding the flour and cocoa mixtures? I just put a layer of the cocoa mixture, then a sugar/butter layer, and then another cocoa+flour layer. Was I supposed to mix it together first? Thank you, in advance! I'd really like to make it up to my friend with an amazing cake asap!

What a great cake! I had cake-flour handy, so used that instead of the all-purpose, but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. The cake was moist, and delicious. I paired it with a Fluffy White Frosting recipe also on this site. Kids loved it. THANKS! I'll definitely make this again.

Made this exactly as the recipe stated, even let the cocoa mixture cool to room temp and beat the butter and eggs for ten minutes.. and it was still a little dry. Definitely dark chocolate, which we love, but I think next time I'll use some applesauce instead of half the butter, to make it more moist. I made this with the Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting, big hit for a birthday!

I followed all of the hints from the other reviews with the butter Crisco and the coffee, etc.  Maybe it would have come out better by following the recipe exactly but I doubt that much better. I made this for my sister in law's baby shower and was horrified when the cake fell apart before I could even assemble it.  PLEASE  do not make this cake for a special occasion, test it out first which is normally what I do.  I would try to make this cake again by following the exact recipe, but I just don't want to because the substitutions were not that big to make a difference.  This was way to dry, crumbly, not sweet enough. To all of the other users who made this cake a success, I congratulate you on a job well done.  I will be sticking to my old recipes in the future!  I have to rate this with one star, but I am really giving it ZERO STARS. I'm sorry my experience was just to terrible.  I would love any feedback.

This cake is phenomenal. We served it to a few long-time cooks/chefs and they insisted upon the recipe. When I gave it to them, I realized I had accidentally used half the amount of butter asked for (1/2 C.) which may have been why it was so moist and tasty. I also used (organic) whole milk instead of water and organic cocoa powder. 

This recipe is great.

I just made this cake tonight and it came out great, nice chocolate flavor and moist.  I halved the recipe because I didn't want that much cake, made cupcakes and it worked fine.  I also used margarine because I have an allergy to milk.  Will definitely make this again.

I have an incredible chocolate cake recipe i currently use - and thought this one might top it. But like another baker, i prefer oil based cakes. They're much more moist and moorish. Will stick to my original recipe i think.

Excellent chocolate cake!  I hate using mixes, but it seems hard to find a chocolate cake recipe without one... after trying this one, this will be the only one I make in the future!  I used a strong coffee with a tablespoon of caramel syrup (the kind that you would put in coffee to make a latte) and the flavor was wonderful!  I would highly suggest doing this... It doesn't taste too "coffee-y", it just tastes very rich and chocolatey.  Also, I made cupcakes instead of a normal pan cake.  I still cooked them at 350, but I took the time to about 17-19 minutes.  I used a 7 minute frosting, because I didn't want anything too rich to overpower the flavor of the cake.  Very good!!

I tried this cake,it was good but I have had better...it's great if you like a light,fluffy chocolate cake , I prefer dense and VERY moist. Over all it's a good cake but I'll stick with my recipe and will post that soon. Ty for the submission , it's fun to try new things.

Amazing!  I took the suggestion of another user and separated the eggs.  Whipped the egg whites into soft peaks and added alternately with the chocolate mixture.  Also added about 1-2 tsp of instant coffee powder to the hot water.  Made into cupcakes cooking about 20 minutes and they had beautiful domed tops.  Next time I might cook a little less (about 18 minutes) as they were a little overdone.

This is by far one of the tastiest cakes I have ever tasted. I add natural orange flavor and the juice of one orange to the chocolate and the rind of an orange to the flour and that turns this cake into something truly extra ordinary!

I made cupcakes, I got 34 that baked in 15 minutes, I added 1/4 cup more water, reversed baking powder and soda amounts, used brown sugar instead of white and doubled the vanilla. I filled with cream and glazed with ganache to make HoHo's, were very good, will add more water next time maybe 1/3 cup as the batter thicken upon cooling.

I too believe that this cake is far too dry, dense, and lacking in flavor. It does hold together very well and is great for layering. I poured half of the batter into a 9 X 9 rectangular dish and frosted with a coconut/semisweet ganache - far too dry. I mixed the remaining batter with a half cup of raspberry preserves and made 16 medium cupcakes. Still a bit dry, but very pretty. Won't try this one again.

Dense, rich, heavenly.  This recipe will remind you of the way chocolate cake is supposed to taste - not like a boxed mix!  I used buttermilk in place of the water for more depth of flavor.  I baked in a bundt pan, and it took about 40 min to cook, but set beautifully.  Topped with whipped cream frosting and strawberries.  DEEEEELICIOUS.

I'm huge on flavor, not so much on sugary sweets, so cake isn't typically my first choice dessert. That being said, this particular cake was quite good. I made it into cupcakes for my daughter's preschool class and threw on a coat of cheap-o frosting, and everyone loved them. Even stingy old me. I would've preferred slightly more of a chocolate punch, but I think I'd be verging into brownie territory at that point. I definitely liked this more than the Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe, but, again, I prefer a lower sweetness level.

Out of all the chocolate cake recipes I could find, THIS one worked the best for me. It doesn't have any ridiculous ingredients that I never have on hand, and it turned out sooooo soft and yummy! I loved it, even my fiancee who isn't fond of sweet things. He thought it was great! :D THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!

I made this for a St. Patty's Cake.  I tweeked the recipe somewhat.  Instead of butter I added 3/4 C of Sweetened applesauce & Decreased the sugar to 1-1/2 C.   I also made a plain confectioner's icing w/ a drop of mint extract.  I colored sugar green and topped the icing w/ colored sugar.
Let me just say we usually have a cake for several days.  My family devoured it!!

This cake was so crumbly and fragile it cracked and fell apart even as it was cooling off. Followed it to the T. As they were breaking beyond hope, crumbled them all to make cake pops and the tossed the other tray which had a weird eggy taste. I have never had such cake disaster and am still puzzled the way the this cake went.

I found this recipe on a message board and decided to try it out for my nephews birthday cake.  It was very easy to make and the cakes came out perfect! I did 3 tiers and all of them baked and stacked perfect.  It came out very moist and tasty too! I would definitely recommend it and I will use the recipe again!

This is the best recipe I've found for chocolate cake. My family and friends all BEGGED for it! It is a lot of steps and I recommend sifting the cocoa but it came together nicely, layers baked evenly and the taste is moist and incredible!

Made this today and it is excellent.  I used left over morning coffee instead of the water and used dark chocolate cocoa power instead of the regular cocoa.  The cake is very dark in color, very rich and moist.  I baked it into a sheet cake pan for 30 minutes and used cream cheese frosting.  This recipe goes into my box.

I was looking for a recipe that DIDN'T call for a boxed cake mix. I made this for my daughter's birthday, followed the recipe as written and used 2 8" round pans and with the extra batter made 5 cupcakes. Added about 15 minutes to the baking time. It turned out delicious!! It was very moist and I had no sticking issue at all.

The flavor was good, but the completely fell apart when I tried to remove them from the pans! I had to make a whole new cake using my "old faithful" chocolate cake recipe. Wont try this one again.

Not sure what happened. Taste was okay. Very light and airy which made it hard to frost. If I make again, I will follow the suggestions to put in a bundt.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It isn't very chocolatey, and it has an odd flavor.

This cake did not have a very chocolaty taste. I am a huge fan of from scratch cake and this is not it. I gave it three stars for the easy of making the cake.

I have used this recipe for two cakes.  One was a two layer Canadian Flag cake and the other was a sheet cake, both were delicious!  Thank you.  I did separate the eggs and whipped the egg whites as well as let the water and cocoa cool before adding it.  Yummy!  Thanks.

I made this cake to take to a cookout...everyone kept telling me how good and moist it was:)Substituted strong brewed coffee for the water. I followed another reviewer by seperating the eggs, and beating the egg whites with the sugar. I made a bundt cake, with a caramel cappuccino cream cheese filling, and  topped the cake with crushed heath bars and drizzled with melted milk chocolate chips. Made for a great presentation! I wish I had taken a picture of the cake. This is a great recipe, you can make as is, or use as a great base. Will make again & again. Thanks for sharing!

I LOVE THIS CAKE. I make it exactly as the recipe states and it always turns out delicious. I usually use Ghirardelli Chocolate, but have also used Hershey. I always serve with cream cheese icing. I agree that it is better the next day, I usually refrigerate overnight for this reason, but will also happily eat it fresh from the oven. If you don't think it is chocolaty enough, just add chocolate chips to the batter.

Tastes just like a cheap cake mix, sorry to say! Didn't have much flavor without the homemade frosting I added and was really a dense and heavy cake.  Won't be making again!

I used 2 cups hot coffee instead of water and it was amazing. It was so moist and the perfect texture. The subtle hints of coffee were the perfect touch for the coffee lover or someone that hates coffee. This is my main chocolate cake recipes from now on. It was so easy to make too. I made it in a 10 in spring form pan, but I had to cook it about 20 min longer for the whole cake to cook, but it was worth the wait. I paired it with a coffee icing. It was great.

This cake was to die for. I made it into cupcakes and overcooked some of them, and they were still good! Perfect, moist texture, rich taste... Especially delicious the next day. It took a long time for my water/chocolate mixture to cool; I think I'll do that before I even turn on the oven next time.

Great cake to that works great with so many ways.  made this 3 layers with a ganache filling and extra-chocolately frosting and with a whipped cream cheese frosting from this site flavored lightly with orange ... yum, yum!  Also made as a bundt with a powdered sugar icing drizzle.  Do not be worried by the list of ingredients, a very easy recipe, just adjust baking times when using different size pans, use similar times from packaged cake mixes.

The cake turned out really good. Moist, fluffy, and not too sweet, just about right. But it's a little bit complicated to make and I'm not sure if I will make this again.

This was a great cake. I followed the directions the first time and it was delicious. I baked it in a bundt pan and it took about 45 minutes. The next time I needed cake for a big party. So, I made a large half sheet. Cooked quickly... about 18 minutes. I added 1/4 c. orange marmalade and 4T orange liquor to the boiling water (which I cut by 1/4 c.). It was great covered in powdered sugar. No leftovers from the pot luck. Ah well, I will have to make another one.

Almost perfect.  I've made this cake twice now. Most of my cooking and baking supplies are in storage so I've been doing everything by hand. No mixer! It turned out really well this time but I think I may have over beat or taken too long to combine all ingredients as it turned out a little dryer than the first time. still great though and I definitely will make it again!

I made this based on all the reviews. I wasn't impressed. It was pretty dry. Such a waste of 4 eggs. The batter was pretty good, so I thought it would turn out really yummy. I did everything based on the recipe. It was dry. It still was tasty. But just your typical cake tasty. Nothing like "wow! what's the recipe for this cake" tasty.

This cake was easy to do and came out incredibly moist. What I really liked about it was that it was not very sweet allowing me to add a sugary butter cream frosting on top. And I feel like I could play around with the recipe to make it more or less sweet as I need in the future. It took a bit of time to really beat in the butter and batter together but it was totally worth it.

I am very happy with this recipe.  I was looking for a good recipe for making chocolate cupcakes.  This one worked perfectly.  Very nice flavor, moisture, and density.  Great in combination with a buttercream icing.  Thank you, this is now my chocolate cake recipe of choice!

I made this cake for my mothers birthday and everyone loved it!  I can't say it was the best chocolate cake I've ever had, but it was tasty.  I made a few changes to the recipe however, by replacing the water with freshly brewed coffee, using whole wheat flour and adding about 2 heaping tbsp. of sour cream (to add more moistness). It wasn't as sweet or moist as I like my cake to be, but it also wasn't as crumbly as I thought it might turn out.  Made this with a nutella glaze with chopped hazlenuts on top.

I made cupcakes.The only thing i changed was i added 5 chai tea bags to the boiling water & let them stand for 5 minutes and then let it cool before adding the the mix.The flavor was amazing! But, i did find the cake a tad dry.Next time i will add a bit of sour cream as others have suggested to make it more moist. Topped the cupcakes with dark chocolate chai tea butter cream for a perfect combo and they were not overly sweet!Thanks you for a good recipe :)

Needed to make something chocolate fast so cut it to 4 servings and made cupcakes.  I partially melted the margarine, whipped it with a whisk instead of a mixer.  Baked and dipped them in a chocolate ganache - FANTASTIC!  A new addition to my personal cookbook!

Loved this cake, deep, dark chocolate.  I have made this several times, after my initial try with the recipe as written I have used coffee instead of water which really adds depth to the flavor.

It came out too beautiful to eat! I ogled it until I could refrain no longer. And its taste, out of this world. I made it in a Bundt, but next time I'll try it as a regular choco cake with vanilla cream filling. I'm sure it will come out even better (if that were even possible).

Delicious! I baked in 2 cakepans for up to 50 min (thicker cake). I added 1 tbs instant coffee as suggested by previous reviews. I also added 1 tbs vegetable oil to increase the moistness of the product - it helps but I will add more oil next time, maybe up to 1/2 cup.

amazing! thanks to a many other reviews i did changes, i used half milk and half water for the cocoa mixture and added more cocoa than measured.i then put into a 10cup bundt and baked for over 1 hour, well worth the wait!  in a rush i grabbed a can of duncin hines cream cheese icing and "watered"it down with milk to make it pour over the cake like in the picture.  even the most picky chocolate cake tasters loved this. will keep this one. it would be fantastic with different flavours.

This recipe makes an AMAZING chocolate cake! I followed the recipe exactly and took another reviewer's recommendation of making sure the cocoa/hot water mixture had cooled thoroughly before mixing it in with the other ingredients. (Note: the bottom of the bowl was still warm, but the mixture was no longer hot--tepid, at most). I poured the batter into 12 mini-bundt pans and was rewarded with rich, MOIST, decadent chocolate cakes. I made them for a party and served them with raspberry sauce, and not one was left by the end of the night. This is now my go-to recipe for chocolate cake.

This is a excellent cake. I've made it twice now. The second time, I took the suggestion of another member: adding a tbs of mayo and tbs of vegetable oil. It did help make the cake a bit more moist.   I highly recommend making a frosting for this cake. Its a great cake but needs a little something. I used the one minute icing recipe; paired fabulously!

Love this cake!  It is so simple and so versitle!  I have used it for cakes and cupcakes.  Always the same great results!  I have tried it with both dark and regular cocoa powder, and like the regular better. This is my go to recipe when someone asks for a cake!  It is so good with just a chocolate glaze or chocolate ganache!

I love a good chocolate cake-even a dense one, but this wasn't what I expected. Granted, I didn't have 3 9" cake pans (who makes a 3-tiered birthday cake anyway?), so I made it in 2 and had to cook longer to get the middle not to be soupy. But overall, the cake wasn't crumbly but wasn't mosit, light, and fluffy either. Everyone thought it was good (but rich), but I don't think I'll make it again. Definitely don't eat it by itself-I relied on icing to make it a bit more moist (still not enough for me).

Great recipe-I made it exactly as given, except I made cupcakes instead.  Makes about 2 1/2 dozen cupcakes-baked at 15-17 min.  They are delicious & really don't need icing.  I will definitely use this recipe again!!!

This cake is delicious!  It's very chocolaty, moist, and isn't too sweet. I've made it several times and now it's the only recipe I'll use for chocolate cake. But when made exactly as described it's very dense.  As another reader suggested if you whip egg whites until they form soft peaks and then fold them into the batter, the consistency turns out much lighter.  I use 6 egg whites and fold them into the batter as the last ingredient before pouring into 9-inch cake rounds.  Also, cutting the cake lengthwise to make extra layers helps lighten it up too!

This is an excellent cake.  It makes 6 2/3 cup batter - and holds up to a 3D pan.  Great taste - great texture (I did sift it!)

I did it today. It was soft and testy. This cake was topping with strawberry sauce, like strawberry cheesecake topping. You should try!!! The test goes along together well.

I tried this recipe and the one bowl chocolate cake III recipe, and liked the latter better. This one turned out a less moist than I would've liked and a little less flavorful. Probably won't use it again but its a good basic chocolate cake. Just not my favorite.

Made this for my son's birthday.  Everyone raved about how yummy it was.  Lots of seconds even!  Only thing I changed was mild coffee instead of plain water as the other reviewer suggested to enhance the flavors.

Delicious Chocolate Cake!  I used Coffee instead of the boiling water and added an extra 1/4 tsp of salt (kosher of course) and an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla and just a little extra cocoa powder since some people said it could have a little more chocolate flavor.  This was a really good Moist cake, better than any box mix by far!  Also I found that I only had 2 9 inch round cake pans so I squeezed it into the 2 and they baked just fine.

My 10 yr old daughter found this recipe when she was planning to bake a cake for my birthday last weekend.  She read the reviews and decided that this was THE ONE.  She followed the recipe and made it herself and it was AMAZING! Lots of flavour, not too sweet, moist and delicious!!  She used one large rectangular pan since we didn't have 3 round ones, that was the only difference.  I would definitely recommend this cake - easy to make and it came out perfect!

Love this chocolate cake. It is so yummy. Then only change I made was instead of boiling water, I used hot coffee. I find it brings out the chocolate flavour. Also, I would recommend that you grease and flour the pan, it makes a HUGE difference.

Moist, rich, and a great crumb. I added 1 tablespoon of instant espresso powder, and I folded in whipped egg whites just before pouring the batter into 1 9" round pan. Thank you for posting!

Mistook the cocoa powder for 200g instead of 80g, and put the whole mix into 1 9inch springform.  Baked for 1.5hr and turned out great.  The creaming didnt really turn the mix light and fluffy for some reason, but the cake was  nt dense and was ok lightness.  I subbed half white sugar for brown sugar, and even though I added 120g more cocoa powder by istake the cake was just the right sweetness.  It wasnt at all dry, as i heeded the advice of waiting for the mixture to cool before proceeding.  Would definately try again and create 3 batch tiers!  Overall would seem to be an A+ recipe.  Covered it with chocolate ganache from the website.  Brother said it was hugely satisfying!  :D

So good and not complicated to make either.  Have made it a few times now and have added coffee and other flavorings to make it different each time.  So tasty when combined with the frosting from the "chocolate torte" recipe on the AR website.  Thanks for sharing!

Wowza. Perfection. I actually forgot the vanilla! But it was still amazing. Very light and moist and chocolaty. I generously sprayed the pans and they slipped out with no problems. The only thing was, that the first cake I left in too long... it's done if the fork comes out with no batter, cake crumbs are ok! Second cake was perfect : ) THANK YOU!

I did sub oil for butter as butter tends to leave cake dry.  This cake was not too sweet and intensely chocolate. Yum!

I don't know where I did wrong since I followed this recipe to a tee but it seems that other reviewers got better results than I did. My cakes came out fairly dry and dense. Maybe there's something wrong with my cocoa powder?

I picked  this one based on the review of the pastry chef (and because I was out of mayonnaise and could not make "aunt Joyces Chocolate Cake"from this site.) They made the suggestion of subbing buttermilk for the water. I went with 1 cup buttermilk and 1 cup boiling water. I also greased AND floured my 9x13 metal cake pan ( I don't have any round ones)I had NO problem getting the cake out. This cake took about 35-40 minutes before it was done using the toothpick check. Even though we all liked it, it was a bit dry. If I ever find myself out of mayo again, I will pick a recipe other than this to try. Maybe if I had used the 3 round pans it would have worked better. 4 stars is still good...just not my favorite.

Like many other reviews on this cake, I could not get the cake out of the pan. it came out very dry and crumbled and I couldn't even salvage it to frost it.  I tried this recipe twice as I floured the pans the first time I tried it.

I get requests for this cake ALL the time.  I didn't tweak any of it the first time and it was excellent.  The second time I just added 1/4 cup of strong coffee and using only 3/4 cup of cocoa/water mix and it tasted even better.  Super moist and fluffy.

We couldn't stop eating this cake! It was amazing! The only thing I changed was whipping the egg white with half the sugar and then folding it in.

Very good. I used Hershey's dark chocolate and cut it back a bit. It turned a lovely black color and looked gorgeous. I also froze the cake after it cooled a bit and it gave it a professional texture that worked great for what I was making it for. I'll make this again.

i'm a novice baker and had no problems with making this cake. it's a simple recipe, but it was too sweet for my taste. other people seemed to enjoy it, though. a few suggestions, though: whip the egg whites before adding it to the wet ingredients as it will have a more pleasing consistency; don't whisk the cocoa into the water WHILE it's boiling as you will soon be drenched in hot chocolate (i can attest to this); and choose a simple icing because it is a pretty sweet cake despite it's title as 'dark chocolate'. Also, one last note, I had to keep the cake in the oven for longer than suggested.

This cake is very rich. This does not taste like chocolate cake that I expected, instead it tastes like oreo ( so I gave 4 stars instead of 5 ). However it's delicious and moist.  I also put whipped cream frosting and chocolate chunks on the top.

This cake was delicious! I used a bundt pan & had to leave it in a little longer than the set time. I think I left it in a little too long, & was a little dry! Next time, I won't leave it in so long. Definitely will make this recipe again! Thanks so much for sharing!

This cake didn't live up to my expectations. It was good, but not great. For the effort that it took to make a homemade cake I thought it would be better than the kind you get from a box, but it wasn't. My husband did like it though, but it might have been the peanut butter butter cream frosting that made it disapear. I will be trying a different cake recipe next time.

Very good cake, moist enough. I did half of the recipe and turn out very tasty. I used hot cocoa mix, special dark from hershey's and added some chocolate chips. Baking time 15 minutes. I will keep it!

Mery moist cake. I halfed the recipe and cooked it in one 8X8 pan. It took about 40 minutes in the oven but I don't know what temperature the oven is because I have no numbers on my dial. I also substituted the water with coffee and the butter with oil.  It came out very good and I will be making this again.

This cake turned out pretty well except for it being a little too dry. I baked the three cakes together for 27 minutes and I think that was a little too long. Next time I will either lower my bake time to 20-22 minutes or slightly decrease the oven temp. I replaced 1 cup of the water with 1 cup of Kahlua and added 1 cup of chocolate chips. Yummy! I filled the layers with a Baileys and chocolate mousse. It was great!

if you are in the mood for a chocolate overdose..this is the cake to eat.  it was more like a brownie than a cake.  i made it in a bundt pan.  it was very moist and very dense...but bery good!  i topped it with powdered sugar and some melted giardhelli chocolate.  i also took the advice of the other reviewers and put coffee in it.  i will definately make again for when im having a bad chocolate craving

Great recipe, although at first I thought the cake might be a crumbly mess like other reviewers have stated but it turned out perfect.  I had to experiment with the sugar because both my in-laws are diabetic.  I did cut the butter in half and used 1/4c of applesauce.  I didn't use splenda but canderel since splenda is rather expensive here.

Excellent recipe! The cake was moist and tasted perfect!  I added instant coffee granules to the 2 cups of boiling water--which added extra flavor.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Wow... this is a fabulous chocolate cake!  I just made them into 12 jumbo-sized cupcakes and glazed them with the ganache from this site as well, and topped with a strawberry.  Beautiful and delicious!

I just finished baking this cake and had a taste test.  This cake is very moist, has a good spongy texture, and is flavorful.  I am giving it 4 stars because it reminds me a lot of the boxed deviled cake you buy at the store and I always hope for something a little more for a made from scratch cake.  But it is very yummy and I will use this recipe again.

This was a perfect chocolate cake recipe from scratch! I followed the instructions exactly and I got a great looking, wonderful tasting chocolate cake. This is a HUGE recipe however, I made a bundt cake and 9 cupcakes. I also used margarine instead of butter and used an electric mixer. Yum!

With all the great reviews this cake has, I decided to make this for my little sister's b-day. I was a tad disappointed with the outcome of it, however. The cake texture was okay (though I added a bit more liquid to the batter), didn't have a problem with the cake sticking to the pan or falling apart as others did, the color and presentation was beautiful, and the chocolate flavor was pretty strong, but I think what lacked was a little more sweetness to it. Also, though the cake was very soft, I personally like mine a little more moist. I frosted the cake with "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" from this site, which definitely helped with the sweetness factor. Overall a good recipe, but I'll probably try this again with some more sugar and possibly some oil/applesauce next time.  :)

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't cut or tasted this recipe yet but so far it's perfect!  The color is a rich dark brown.  I followed the recipe exactly but creamed the sugar and butter for about 5 minutes before proceeding.  I made a shiny chocolate glaze to drizzle over it and it's setting up now.  Others reported having issues with the cake sticking and crumbling as it came out but mine came out perfectly!  I baked in a heavy Nordicware non-stick bundt pan that was generously sprayed with bakers spray.  No crumbs were left in the pan and the crust is tender, not tough.  I baked it for about an hour to ensure that it was done all the way through.  I almost don't want to cut into this cake because it looks so beautiful.  If it tastes as wonderful as it looks, I will definitely be upgrading to a 5.  I'm going to finish this with a dusting of powdered sugar when the glaze sets up a bit more.  UPDATE:  I finally had a taste of this cake and WOW - this one is definitely a keeper!  I had to change my rating a 5!  My family loves this and colleagues did too.  I'll definitely file this one away and will bake frequently.

WOW!! This cake is amazing. I've tried recipe after recipe to find a great, moist and rich chocolate cake! This is it. I throw so man baby showers and parties and this is perfect for any occasion! When I made it for a birthday party for a girlfriend they got stuck with half the cake, since it was a small group, so I expected her hubby to take it to work to get rid of it! NOPE!! He ate the entire thing that week!!! Truly...try it once ...you won't regret it!

I substituted 2 cups of milk instead of the water. I lined two cake pans with wax paper and greased them as well. Then I put them in the oven for about 10 minutes longer. I frosted the layers with cream cheese frosting to make a delicious birthday cake for my dad. Thank you for a reliable chocolate cake recipe!

Perfect in every way!  I made this for a friend's birthday.  I used a Chocolate Ganache recipe from this site as the icing.  I contemplated omitting one layer, but I am glad that I left it as a 3-layer cake because it looked much more professional.  And it tasted GREAT!!!

Very delicious!  I took previous review's advice and substituted water for strong hazelnut coffee and also beat the egg white separately.

This was a very good "solid" cake.  I found the texture to be close to pound cake.  Very hearty, not light and airy. We found you didn't need a "BIG HUNK" of cake to be satisfied.  Excellent with butter icing also.

I think this cake is amazing, its moist, with just the right amount of chocolate. I followed the recipe but just used two 8 inch cake pans instead of 3 the cake took longer to cook than what was recommended and it came out really high I had to cute some of the tops off or else it wouldnt have fit in my cake caddy. I will use this recipe again

This is the only chocolate cake recipe I will use. It is so delicious. I don't recommend doubling the recipe unless you have a very large mixer and you can use two cake pans as long as they are three inches deep otherwise it tends to burn in regular 8-inch pans.

I have never been a fan of chocolate cake, but this is my new favorite!  Amazingly wonderful flavor as is.  I made this twice in one week & my family devoured it!  I used buttercream icing from this site & the combination was incredible!  Absolutely delicious! No more box cakes for my family....EVER!

I followed the recipe as indicated.  I don't know what happened, but like a few other people, the cake fell apart.  It was a mess.  I also didn't over-bake it, but it was not moist.  I won't be making it again.

I made this cake just as written and it was super yummy!  Didn't have any trouble with sticking; just greased and floured the pans.  The cake came out very moist, very dense and very rich.  I used the Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site and it was very good, but I think it will be even better with a vanilla frosting.  Will try that next time.

I don't eat chocolate cake but I can tell you my kids loved this cake! They inhaled it. :) Box cakes are so easy to make but I find it so satisfying to make a cake from scratch, even though they are a lot of work. Thanks for the recipe!  :)

My 5 year old daughter picked these out for her cupcakes she made for her grandaddy... I thought at first that they might be to dark or to rich, but decided to try them anyway. Boy am I glad we did! She made them mostly with a little help with measuring, but they came out PERFECT! They are sturdy for icing, moist, but don't crumble. The flavor was PERFECT! They were a HUGE hit! We iced them with cool whip icing that we had died pink, and pink sprinkles(as that is my dd's favorite color!). Will DEFINITELY be making these again!!

Made with brewed coffee for a more intense flavor and due to may reviews, switched the butter to butter flavored Crisco and it was still a little dry.  I can't find a scratch cake that is as good as a box cake and not sure why I keep trying when the box is so easy!  Sorry but I'll have to go back to box.  This was tasty but it needs to be more moist.

Really good recipe.  I have been trying many chocolate cake recipes from this site, and this is the best so far.  It is very moist and light, with an excellent chocolate flavor, not too sweet.  I did not have problems with the cakes sticking to the pan as others have, and I only used Baker's Joy.

Very moist cake; perfect birthday cake for decorating, as it bakes nice and flat-topped(as some others have noted). I made 2 layers in greased and cocoaed (used plain cocoa rather than flour to not spoil the color) springform pans lined with parchment circles. This was essential, I think, to being able to remove the cakes easily from the pans. I baked them late and night and let cool to morning, covered, before frosting.

I used the Buttercream icing (submitted by Sharon Gerstman) on both cakes, but split one of them first and filled it with whipped chocolate ganache (submitted by Ingridevogel). Everyone loved it, and this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Excellent cake!  I only had 2 eggs, so we cut the recipe in half.  Also, I added a tsp of vanilla and cinnamon - yumm!  I served it with sliced & sweetened strawberries and whipped cream.  The cake was gone in 30 minutes!  I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe turned out perfectly!!! I made 30 Large cupcakes instead of a cake and within 10 minutes, 10 of them were eaten by the family. They were very moist and held together well. Had just enough chocolate taste and sweetness. The recipe was so easy to follow and make. This will be the ONLY chocolate cake recipe I will use from now on and I will be passing it on to friends and family. Thank you so much for this!

I loved this recipe! I actually doctored it up a bit, but will still definitely make it again.  I added a box of chocolate pudding, melted baking chocolate, and milk.  I also used a chocolate butter cream icing for the base decoration and glazed the top with melted chocolate.  I finished off the top with large strawberries.  I made it for my husband’s birthday and everyone loved it.  It is very chocolaty but not too sugary sweet…..very decadent.  It kept very well too.  I made it on a Friday night, then refrigerated the three 9in round tiers to decorate Saturday.  I didn’t serve it until Saturday night at a BBQ.  After everyone left, I forgot to wrap the remainder of the cake.  Only the exposed part of the cake dried out.  The rest of the cake was still very moist on Sunday, even Monday evening.  I'll post the exact recipe I used, and a picture of the cake, for anyone that is interested... under Cyndi's Decadent Chocolate Cake......Thanks for the original recipe posting!

I had the same problem as Brenda H.  The cake layers fell apart and were a mess!  I will not make it again.  My poor sister...she has a really sloppy birthday cake.

I made this for a friend's birthday (with the rich chocolate frosting).  It was so good!  Takes a bit of work, but it's well worth it.  I'm definitely making this cake again, although I'm going to cut the recipe down.  12 servings on a 3 layer cake is huge!

Oh My Goodness! I made this cake for a co-workers birthday party today, and I got absolutely rave reviews. This is the best chocolate cake that I have ever tasted!! I used Hersheys One Bowl Buttercream Frosting from this site and I decorated the top with chocolate covered strawberries...need I say more!

Super delish! Nice & moist with a deep chocolatey flavor. I used Hershey's Special Dark for the cocoa powder. If you make sure to let the cocoa mixture COOL COMPLETELY, you will not have any problems with a runny batter. Mine was thick enough that the mixer paddle could stand up in it. This was enough batter to make two fairly thick 9" layers and one 7" layer of the same thickness. This will be my "go-to" chocolate cake recipe from now on!

GREAT cake.
will not lie...it is a bit crumbly. I sat it out for about 5 hours... still crumbled. BUT I used a thick (but not too sweet) icing, held it together for presentation. --as soon as you tried to cut it, mind you, it fell to pieces! Nevertheless everyone LOVED it and requested I make another one!!

This is Good! This was the second time I made it, and now I think this will be my only choc cake recipe! My family does not fancy the really sweet cakes, so I had to reduce the sugar to 1 and 3/4 cups, but that was still sweet with frosting. Without the frosting, it was just perfect!! Very fine crumb and very moist cake. This is definitely a keeper!
I did goof up a little bit though, my baking soda was kind of old, so did not want to risk using it, and instead used just 2 tsps of baking power. Seems that was not enough, as the cake did not rise as much as it did the last time I made it. Now I know what to do next time! Overall, I love this cake!!!!

Tasty! However, I would have benefited from a different cook time/temp since I used a Bundt cake pan. Because I didn't do the research the cake wasn't near as moist as the other reviews stated. I'll try again and follow the original instructions for baking. (I did use coffee in place of water and added a cup of chocolate chips).

Incredible cake!  I used Hershey's Dark Chocolate Cocoa and followed the recipe to a 'T'.  I made raspberry filling for between the layers and a ganache frosting for the top which was delicious.  (I can't wait to try it with a mocha or orange filling)  It was just the right texture, not too dry or dense like other homemade cake recipes.  Will definitely make again! Thanks for a great 'keeper'!

This cake is sooo good. I used coffee instead of water and followed the recipe exactly. Very moist and soft and soo chocolatey. Use good quality cocoa powder!!! I used supermarket brand cocoa once and it was awful. I'm still working on the perfect frosting.

I recommend substituting 1/2 cup espresso and 1 1/2 cups boiling water to enrich the chocolate flavor. Be careful not to bake this cake too long -- it can dry out quickly.

Oh wow!! This recipe just makes the most moist, light, and airy cake! I was so pleased with the results. It made a good size cake which I was able to decorate with ease. I actually had large eggs and only needed 3. I won't be making any other chocolate cakes ever again!

An excellent, moist, rich chocoalte cake that is very easy to make, and quite reliable.  I layered this with the chocolate ganache recipe from this website, whipped cream, and sliced ripe strawberries.  It was a three layer cake, and I used the remaining ganache on top of the cake - it got rave reviews, and was delicious!

I think this will be my "go to" chocolate cake recipe. It was fantastic and an impressive three delicious layers. Frosted it with vanilla buttercream (from the Magnolia Bakery cookbook). I would make this ahead because I find it better the next day.

This was a different cake then you would expect. I think it had more of a decadent taste to it and would have been the absolute best with like a chocolate ganache icing or maybe even sprinkled with powdered sugar and topped with fresh strawberry. I made the recipe almost exactly as stated in the recipe that was submitted. The only thing I changed was the pan. I made it in a huge cake pan instead of three rounds. We were very pleased with the results and would make it again just with a better frosting then what we used.

Fantastic! A dark but airy chocolate cake that tastes delicious. I followed the recipe but also did as one reviewer suggested and separated the eggs, whipping the whiites separately with some of the sugar. In a large Bundt pan the recipe took over an hour to cook, but came out lovely for a birthday cake. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I just wanted to put a review up because I baked this cake at high altitude, about 6000 ft above sea level. I added 4 T water and 2 T flour. I used only 1 3/4 t baking soda, a scant 1/2 t baking powder, and only 2 cups of sugar. Lastly, I used 5 eggs. Everything else I left the same.  It turned out fantastic!! It wasn't too dense or anything; rich and sweet and perfect!

Very good!  The cake came out of the pan flawless and was easy to frost.  The only downside was it was a little dry, but IMO, that can be said of most cakes.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  I used a chocolate ganache between layers 1 and 2, and cool whip and strawberries between 2 and 3, frosted the cake with buttercream and sprinkled crushed Oreos on top.  Kind of a hodgepodge but everyone loved it!

Very simple and tasty. However, my boyfriend prefers Sandy's chocolate cake to this one. The flavor in this cake is a bit lighter as Sandy's recipe calls for brown sugar and sour cream.

I added 6 Tblsp of Ghiradelli mocha mix into a 1c measuring cup, then filled it to the top with unsweetened cocoa.  This recipe yielded 42 mini cupcakes and 12 regular cupcakes.  Perfect "moistitude" as my boyfriend put it.  Topped off the cupcakes with a buttercream frosting.  Oh so good!  20 minutes in the oven for mini cupcakes and 25 minutes for regular-sized cupcakes.

This cake did not turn out good for me. Very dry. It looked beautiful!  First cake I ever made that came out perfect and no problems getting out of the pan.  Just a good looking cake.  The only thing I can think of that I messed up is I didn't realize how long it would take the cocoa mix to cool and went ahead and started the next step with the butter.  I put it in the freezer and it still took a long time to cool, meanwhile my butter mixture was just waiting. When I went back to it it was a little droopy even though I mixed it briefly again. The other thing I did was refrigerate it overnight before serving.  It was iced but just on a cake stand with cover - not air tight.  I may make this again - with what I've learned because it was so beautiful.  Nice color, firm, sharp edges, and almost completely flat.  Not crumbly so it was easy to ice.  Just beautiful.

This was honestly the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted in my life.  I am a beginner when it comes to this baking stuff, and I can honestly say, I was PROUD to make this yummy thang.  This is a keeper!

The cake was OK, not what I would have called "dark chocolate". Not the best and not the worst chocolate cake recipe that I have made. Better once we drizzled with amaretto and added cherry pie filling and hot fudge on top.

I TRIED THIS RECIPE YESTERDAY AND MUST SAY IT IS ONE OF THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPES I HAVE BAKED IN A LONG TIME. THE CHOCOLATE FLAVOR IS VERY INTENSE. I ADDED 2 TEASPOONS OF INSTANT COFFEE TO THE CHOCOLATE MIXTURE WHILE STILL HOT. ALOT OF HOMEMADE CAKES COME OUT WAY TOO DENSE BUT THIS ONE WAS PERFECT. I PAIRED IT WITH A CHOCOLATE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING BUT IT REALLY DIDN'T NEED IT. NEXT TIME I'LL JUST MAKE IT PLAIN. I ALSO HAD TO ADJUST THE COOKING TIME A BIT BECAUSE EITHER MY OVEN WAS OFF OR RECIPE DIDN'T CALL FOR ENOUGH TIME. CHECK WITH YOURS IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT I HAVE AN ELECTRIC OVEN THAT COULD BE WHY. THIS CAKE IS FABULOUS MY HUBBY AND MY NIECES LOVED IT.

This cake was fun to make, and my first homemade cake!  It turned out deliciously moist, and was devoured as soon as it got to the table.  It did take me a while to get through though, probably only because I haven't done this yet

My daughter requested a chocolate cake w/ butter cream icing for her 7th birthday.  I followed the recipe. It was delicious! I had to "carve" the cake/freeze, so it was frozen twice and DID NOT turn out dry at all! It was a big hit and I will definitely use this recipe in the future!

Too dry!!  I followed the recipe exactly as directed.  Maybe the baking time needs to shortened.  I made the cake for the guys at work and I wound up throwing away leftovers.  There has never been leftovers for any other cakes I have made before.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what but this cake wasn't extremely moist and a bit bland.  It was good don't get me wrong, but it was definately NOT worth the effort...I have a one bowl chocolate cake recipe that is a 100x's better.

I made this recipe for my husband, he wanted a chocolate cake and assumed I would go buy a box mix but I know that the boxes don't really taste like chocolate so I found this recipe. I took the advice from other reviews and whipped the egg whites. I didn't tell my husband I made it from scratch until he tasted it, he said it was the best cake he ever had and he couldn't believe I made it from scratch. I made it a second time and it was not good, it was very dry and I did everything the same. I am not sure what happened but I don't think I will be making this again.

My husband made this cake for me for my birthday.  It was EXCELLENT!!  Moist and delicious, had a great texture!  My husband does not cook or bake and it was one of the best cakes I've had!  He followed the recipe exactly.  He topped with a chocolate sour cream frosting, the cake was the star though.

Delicious!  Instead of water I used hot coffee.  Also, cut the sugar down to 2 cups.  I filled it with homemade chocolate pudding and topped it with a dark chocolate frosting glaze.  Wow!

It was a bit time-consuming but well worth the effort - I normally don't like chocolate cake very much because box mixes and even most bakery chocolate cake just doesn't taste much like chocolate, but this was delicious!! I separated the eggs and whipped the whites into a meringue first (per one of the reviews I saw) before adding to the rest of the batter, and it made for a nice texture when finished.

I added an extra egg and made 24 cupcakes. They tasted good. Great for a chocolate fix, though the taste is not much different than boxed cake mix.

I made this cake for my brothers 15th b-day and my family said that it was the best they had ever had......  Besides the flourless chocolate cake that I make.  It was realy moist to, but I made it in a bunt pan and poured all of it in, so I had to cook it for another 20 min.

Best Chocolate Cake I've ever had!  And I don't even like cake!  Boyfriend and mom loved it! Made no substitutions, however next time I think I would try adding cherries and drizzle with chocolate because I love cherries and chocolate! A definite keeper!

Very easy and very chocolatey. I've made this twice. I used 2 cups of hot milk instead of water, to mix the cocoa powder. And right after baking, I drizzled hershey's chocolate syrup on the cake as it cooled. Yeah, I'm mad about chocolate. Didn't need any frosting this way. Took a little longer than 30 minutes to bake - more like 40, but it could have been my dingy oven. 2nd time I made this, I divided the batter into 2 baking tins and then, it turned out in exactly 30 minutes. So, I guess it's meant for layering. However you make it, layer ... cupcake ... it's gonna be good. Promise.

This is by far the best chocolate cake I have ever made- and it's the first one I have done from scratch!  I used a cinnamon icing on it, which tasted wonderful, and fondant, which helped seal in the moisture.  It was so delicious and chocolaty!

I love this cake.  I replaced the vanilla flavoring with some dark rum and cointreau and it turned out amazing.   very moist and delicious.  I can't comment on how well it keeps because it's never lasted very long.

What a moist cake!  Just be careful to have your mixer on low when you add the cocoa/water mixture.  My daughter was "helping" me and the batter got everywhere!

All I can say is FABULOUS!!! Incredible color, taste, and smell! Very easy to make too. Dense and chocolaty (for those of you who said that it wasn't or was too bland, perhaps you should use better quality ingredients, they DO make a difference) but not sickly sweet. Just an all over beautiful cake! Will DEF. be making this one from now on!

the first time i made this cake, it was a bit dry and crumbly. the second time round, i realized that i used medium sized eggs, so instead of 4 eggs, i used 6 medium sized eggs and ta-dah...the cake is moist and delicious..i also used milk instead of water and used 2 cups of brown sugar.i topped this cake with Caroline/s Chocolate Fudge Frosting (recipe can be found in this website) for that extra chocolaty taste..yummy!!!

Rich and tasty cake!  I did have trouble getting it out of the pans, however, and lost a layer. I was forced to have the unusable layer for lunch :-). Next time I will use parchment paper on the bottom of the pans as another reviewer recommended, but I neglected to do.  I filled the layers with raspberry chocolate chip ice cream and topped with chocolate frosting.

This cake is perfect. Moist, dark, tasty and not too sweet. I love a sweet icing so I like the cake to be less sweet and this is it. Bravo! Will definatly use again.

This turned out very well.  I followed the recipe exactly and for a frosting used the topping/frosting that goes with the Mint Chocolate Cake recipe by Virginia Horst.  Everyone at work gave it rave reviews!

This was ok, pretty dark, not too sweet, a little bit mushy and dense, but eatable though. I added 2 tablespoons chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon decaf coffee. At first i was a bit scared about all the amount of water but don't worry about it!!! I also had to cook it for almost 1 hour 'cause it was liquid in the center. I guess i prefer fluffier cakes so i'll keep trying different recipes...

It took me extra 15-20 mins for the cake to be cooked.It's abit too dense for my taste.I won't say this is the best chocolate cake because i have tasted better ones.Remember to grease the cake dish properly or else the cake will stick and it'll be hard to remove it from the pan.

This was a hit with my family! I lessened the butter and sugar cos I wanted it to be less fattening. Yet, the cake still tasted moist and fluffy! Instead of all-purpose flour, I used self-raising flour and a 1/2 tsp of baking soda (disregarding the baking powder) and the cake was just nice, not too dense. Good on its own, but better with frosting.

This cake tasted good, but I didn't like the texture.  I followed the directions as given but the cake came out very dense and heavy.  I used a choc cream cheese frosting from this site which was great, but just wish the cake had been a little lighter in texture.  Not sure if I will make it again, but I am glad I tried it.

Very rich and moist. We made 1/3 recipe so it only made one small round cake and it worked fine for four of us. Didn't use icing...used the Raspberry Sauce recipe on this site instead - great!

Such a rich, dense, and moist cake! I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and received rave reviews from him, his roommates, AND his very picky family. I made a simple vanilla frosting that was the perfect compliment. It also looked beautiful and professional. Great dark color. I used three 8-inch pans instead of nine inch and the thickness of the layers was nearly perfect. Thanks for this recipe! I'm making another one tomorrow for my best friend's birthday party!

An excellent cake.  I substituted coffee for the water.  I put whipped cream frosting in between the layers and chocolate butter frosting on the sides and top.  I will definately be using this one again.

Turn out excellent, moist and chocolatey. Prepared as mini cakelettes and initially prepared a rich ganache for them, but it overpowered the perfect flavor. Opted for a simple confectioners glaze and they were a total hit.

Not sure what I did with this easy recipe, but I was not impressed.  I like a rich chocolate cake and this was not it.  The flavor was bland and just over all blah.  Made a ganache to drizzle on top to make it better.

Very rich, very tasty with chocolate cream cheese frosting. I didn't have any problems with it, though based on other reviews I was expecting it to be dry. And it was quite moist. The last quarter of it started drying out after nearly a week, but that's understandable. Would definitely make again when I'm crazy craving some chocolate.

Although the cake tasted great, I also found it crumbly.  I added rasp. choc. chips, so next time I will omit them and see how it turns out.

Does this cake need any more super ratings/reviews?  YES!!!  I couldnt' sleep tonite if I didn't let everyone know how incredible this cake is.  It is easy to make, and turns out wonderfully.  I will make it again and again.  I filled the layers with whipped cream, and it was decadent.
YUM YUM and YUM.
Thank you so much!

a brillant cake on it's on. very moist, dense and filling. not too sweet, exactly as i like it. i made it with chocolate ganache, which was just a bit too thick and chocolatey. i floured the pans after i greased them and the cakes had no problems coming out. also used two cups freshly brewed expresso in place of the boiling water. next time i make this for christmas, i'll probably whip the egg whites and some sugar seperately to try and make it lighter + fluffier. all in all, a good cake on its own, friendly to modifications.

I absolutely love this recipe.  It's very moist and tasty!  I prefer it without any frosting/icing.  But if I do, I usually use a cream cheese frosting.

I made this as a bundt cake in a greased and floured pan.  It baked for 52 minutes but I probably should have taken it out at 50 minutes.  Hubby thought it was a bit dry, probably due to overbaking.  I thought it had good flavour, especially for a cake made with cocoa (and not 'real' chocolate) I topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze (from this site), which was a really good match, as per previous reviewers.  This cake is quite dense, so if you like more airy cakes then this is not for you!  Next time I make it I will add about a cup of sour cream for extra moistness. All in all, a pretty good cake.  I will still test-run other recipes, in search of 'the' perfect chocolate cake.

I made this cake for a party and paired it with a chocolate creame cheese icing from allrecipes. It got great reviews. I lined the cake with strawberries for a nice presentation and complement to the chocolatey taste.

This is a very good cake. Nice and moist with a good flavor and texture. Best of all, it is very easy to make. Just mix and dump in the pan! I topped it with the chocolate cream cheese frosting from this site and it was excellent together.

This was definitely better than a boxed cake mix - more moist and flavorful.  I usually make my boxed cakes with a box of small pudding added for moistness, but did not add that to this and it did not need it.   I frosted it with chocolate cream cheese frosting and it turned out great.

I was very disappointed with this cake.  I made it for my husband's birthday because he loves dark chocolate, and I wanted it to be perfect.  I followed the instructions to the letter.  The cake was not chocolatey!  I liked the fact that it was not too sweet, but it was bland.  You couldn't even taste the chocolate.  The only thing that saved it was the fact that I used a very chocolatey frosting.

If I were going to make this again, I would use twice as much chocolate.  But I'm not going to make this again due to another problem:  the cake didn't rise!  Since no one else mentioned this, I guess I must have done something wrong.  My layers were flat as pancakes.  When I saw the huge amount of batter, I thought I might be able to split the layers and make it a 6 layer cake.  But each of the 3 layers was too flat to split.

I was actually quite disappointed with this cake.  It wasn't extremely moist, and the flavour just wasn't chocolately enough for my liking.  I could really taste the bitterness of the cocoa and the baking powder.  Still on the look out for a great chocolate cake recipe!

I cannot stress this enough - grease, flour and add a circle of parchment paper to your pan!  Foolishly, I did not heed the advice of other reviewers and have cakes missing their tops and a heap of cake crumbs in the bottom of my pans.

I found that I needed to keep the cake in the oven longer - I did not make 3 9 inch - only 2 8 inch so, not surprisingly, the centres were a bit raw.  Another reviewer suggested preheating the oven to 350 and then knocking it down to 325 when you put in the cake - this may have taken care of the bit which did not cook through properly.  (Although the recipe called for 4 eggs - I managed on 3 large ones as I couldn't be bothered to go out to the store for another dozen.  I seemed to have gotten away with it.)

I experienced difficulty in frosting the cake as chunks were coming away when I applied it.  That may be down to my technique and not the cake itself.

The cake is for a party tomorrow afternoon so I do not have "flavour" feedback.

Thanks for a great cake! I kept the proportions the same and baked it in a 9x12 cake pan.  Had to increase the cooking time a bit but it turned out great! didn't fall apart when I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II (submitted by JJ).  It was a hit!

Very good! Cooked all the way through. I omitted about 2-4 tablespoons of cocoa powder for I knew it would be gagging if I didn't. Came out nice and chocolatey. I added cinnamon on top which gave it a great flavor! Will definitely make again, but w/ a light whipped frosting.

Delicious!!! I recommend following the suggestions from other reviewers and let the oven preheat to 350, then turn it down to 325 when you put the cake in. Also, I greased and floured the pans and the cakes popped right out!  

Carol's chocolate cheese frosting was divine atop this masterpiece, but will go "death-by-chocolate" next time and lose the cinnamon in the frosting- a bit out of place! 

Overall--worth every minute- Spendid!

Sadly cake did not turn out moist for me...possibly overcooked, but when it was checked, toothpick came out gooey.  Cooked about 2 min. longer, and cake turned out quite dry.  Also, the taste seemed to overwhelmingly like the unsweetened cocoa - not the wonderful taste I expected.  Probably would not try this again.  Sorry my review can't be better.

This cake turned out very dry and crumbly, I must have overcooked it.  At 30 mn my toothpick came out gooey still and 5 mn. later it was dry.  I know the temperature on my oven is accurate.  Maybe I'll try it again but not likely.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday, and I made it the day of, because I wanted it to be fresh, but I wish I made it the night before.  It was much better the next day.  I filled the cake with a thick chocolate pudding, and it was great!

Dark and moist! Not too sweet, though which works well with icing. Made an impressive birthday cake.  It was even great several days later.

OK - THIS IS THE BEST CAKE I EVER TASTED - HONEST! STUPENDOUS kinda sounds corny but it truly is. I baked it in my bread machine ( no other tins handy) and exchanged SPLENDA granular sweetner for suger in the recipe. I used the cake bake option on the bread machine and let it sit in the tin ( very important) untill cool before turning out. Taste?...well think FUDGE with a cakey feel! AMAZING!I sliced into small slabs and used some melted milk chocolate as a topping - totally unnecessary but I coulnd't resist it.I am now the most favoured person in my family - THANKYOU!!!

Very moist flavorful cake.  The texture is fine-grained, but kind of crumbly.  We have only one oven rack, so I had to bake it in 2 10" springform pans instead of 3 9" pans--that could explain the dense crumbly-ness.  Really homemade chocolate flavor.

Excellent cake! One slight problem: even though my oven thermometer said 350, when I checked after about 10 minutes, it looked as if the sides were getting too dark. They finished baking quite a bit earlier than time given. The cake did turn out to be excellent.

A very easy cake to make.  I also made the Raspberry Sauce (found by searching "raspberry sauce") and spread it between the layers.  After dusting with powdered sugar, this cake was a hit.  You can still serve the raspberry sauce on the side.  I loved this cake!

MY GOODNESS!!  This is by far the best cake I have ever had!  You would never know it was as easy to make as it is by its appearance and great taste.  I added my own variation between the layers: a cheesecake filling.  I dont usually toot my own horn when it comes to baking, but this cake is surely a masterpiece!  Thanks soooo much for this recipe!

This is a dense cake.  Not too sweet.  The chocolate cream cheese icing is a nice compliment.  My husband said he wished the cake were just a little lighter or fluffier.  I thought the cake was nice as it was.  Not the best cake ever, but pretty good.

Wonderful Chocolate Cake! I made it with the Chocolate Cheese Frosting for my wife's birthday, and it was fabulous. The cake is dark and moist, and the icing is to die for! I used 3, 8 inch round pans so it took about 35 minutes to cook. Hands down better than any cake made from a box.

This has my go to chocolate cake recipe since I found it years ago. I have made this cake, as written, for bunches of holidays, birthdays, graduations, and all sorts of occasions and non-occasions, always to rave reviews. I usually put it with a white butter and powdered sugar frosting of my own making. Simple, reliable, delicious. Thank you!

Tips-if you don't have butter with a very low water content, (most butters do, sadly) your cake will be dry and stick to the pans. Challenge and Tillamook Butter, unsalted are 2 that I've learned are superior for baking. If in doubt, use 1 cube butter and 1/2 c oil. Cream butter and sugar together 1st and mix VERY well before beating in oil and other ingredients.
Allow your boiling water/cocoa mixture to cool completely before adding . 
Sift dry ingredients together. I use cake flour instead of all-purpose.

Oh boy, oh boy! This came out great! Followed the recipe exactly and there was nothing to change. By far my favorite cake recipe and much much much better than a box cake.

This cake was amazing! I got a “best cake I’ve ever had” from the two pickiest sweet eaters in my family.  I used dark chocolate cocoa because the darker the better I think.  I then frosted it with the highest rated german  chocolate cake frosting recipe on this app.  It was fantastic. The sponge is super moist and beautiful. I also only used two 9” round cake pans; it just needed an extra 5 min cook because of the extra batter.

This cake is amazing! My wife and I took another commenter’s suggestion and mixed coffee in place of the water with the cocoa powder and it turned out great! We baked for 25 minutes and the cake was perfect - I feel like 30 minutes would’ve made it a bit too dry.

Well for one thing, the cake took 5 hours to make, mainly the clean up after. There were crumbs Everywhere ! Mind you, I am an experienced baker, and have few disasters before. There  were crumbs on all the counters, the floor, all over the stove and on the cat. When baking, the edges began to burn,  and the middle was still soft, so when the came to take it out, I touched the top and it flattened like a pancake. The others were almost burned and I could not loosen them from the pans, the came out in pieces. I put them together with frosting, and it was good there were only 2 saved layers as I ran out of frosting. It ended up,  everyone went to bed by the time it was finished. It was delish !

This cake was phenomenal. I made it into cupcakes and halved the recipe. It made 16 cupcakes with half a recipe. I couldn't be more pleased. I made fluffy whip cream frosting. I'm extremely impressed with this recipe. I will definitely make this again and again.

I could of picked one of those easy one bowl cakes to introduce my roommate to baking, but this recipe did things the better way, with sifting flour and melting cocoa to name a few.  I wanted him to learn why those things mattered in a good cake.  He's just happens to be a cook at a substantial national chain restaurant (which boasts of having a "bakery") who claims he's not a baker.... What does that mean anyway?  I'm not a baker either but I can make some delicious baked goods.  And now so can he thanks to this wonderful recipe!  
When we were done mixing all the ingredients  I thought the batter looked rather fluffy,  but since this was my first time making this cake I thought it would be best to stick to the recipe.  We filled a cupcake pan first,  then I took liberties with the rest of the batter to make it look more like the consistency in the video.  I added more liquid...this time 1/2 cup of fresh brewed French roast coffee.  Due to the difference in batter consistency  I was thinking one batch would not be as good as the other,  but I was wrong.  The cupcakes and the pan cake with the added coffee both came out great.  And they were both delicious with just a bit of icing or powdered sugar. I'm going to have to give this away quick before I eat it all!  Next time I'll teach him how to make the frosting:)

I've made this cake twice, 8 years apart, and both times it was just fantastic. I don't know why I ever made anything else. I'll be using this recipe every opportunity I have from now on. It pairs well with lemon and raspberry for a spring/summer birthday, or pumpkin spice buttercream for fall. Just wonderful!

I made this chocolate cake as a base to go with whipped cream icing and strawberries. It was moist and delicious. I used a 13 x 9 pan of three cake pans, and then cut the cake in half & put strawberries and some chocolate ganache between the layers. It took 45 min of oven time. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Look no further if you are looking for the perfect chocolate cake recipe. This is my go to recipe for chocolate cake.  When I make it, I use dutch process dark cocoa powder, and freshly brewed hot coffee instead of the boiling water. It creates the classic dark richness you expect from this cake everytime. Additionally,  I separate the yolks from the eggs. then put only the yolks in after the butter and sugar, and then beat the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold them last in after all the other ingredients have been mixed . It is an easy to make cake. The richness of the cake will depend on your icing, the cake itself is very chocolately, but not too rich, allowing for a myriad of icing options for your choosing. I like to make it in layers and have tried many icings with it...  it could be made fancy, I've made it with ganache and whipped cream icing and was very good with it, and I can't wait to try jam in the center. However my husband's favorite is the classic:  dark chocolate cake with a lighter  medium chocolate buttercream for contrast. (The cake with dark dutch process cocoa and the icing with regular cocoa)  I can't blame him, Delicious every time!!!

I do not like to try recipes with changes the first time. That said I followed many review changes and my own. Converted to gluten free. Necessary! Used coffee instead of water, and changed incorporation of it. I beat the sugar, butter, and eggs per recipe, then added cocoa powder to that. Fat nut that cocoa! I then added flour mixture and cold coffee alternately. it turned out great!!

I think this cake is OK. I followed many of the suggestions for a better outcome hoping for a good result. They are all alright and make sense. In my case, I halved the recipe to put it into an 8" X 3" cake pan. The cake was not dry, but I must say it was definitely dense. I stored it just like many mention here however did not put it in the fridge. It stayed moist through the night. I cooled off the water and cocoa mix in the fridge while I prepared pans and the rest of the ingredients. It took me a long time to bake I would say around 50 minutes. May bake it again.

I personally like this recipe a lot. It is a good versatile cake, not too sweet and a little tooth to it but still moist. For a little info on servings it will make around 6 dozen mini cupcakes, or a full sheet cake. I replace 3/4 of the butter apple sauce and I think it gives it a great texture while still being able to support even hefty frostings like german chocolate. I use dutch blend, dark chocolate cocoa as it adds a great deep dark color like the photo. Lots of great recipes here but truly enjoy this one.

I just made this cake today, following the recipe exactly except that I separated the eggs and whipped the egg whites before adding them.  The result was moist, chocolatey and had a very nice texture.  I used parchment paper to line the pans and as an experiment I coated the parchment paper of one pan with butter and flour and used parchment paper only in the second pan.  Both layers held together just fine when I lifted them out of the pans and the paper came off with no problems, so in the future I'll just use parchment paper and skip the butter/flour step.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is by far my go to recipie with my own little twists. My only issue is everytime I make them they fall in the middle. And the liners are very greasy. Id love to get help on them not falling, I think its due to me over mixing when I add in the flour and cocoa mixture as I alternate then make sure each addition is mixed well. Ive already one time used brand new baking soda & powder thinking that was the issue. This last time I made them I baked at 350 for 20 min and never once opened up the door. Any suggestions would be helpful. THANKS

Very rich delicious chocolate cake.  I've made it as a layered cake and as cupcakes.  Do not overcook, or they'll dry out - especially the cupcakes.  My favorite way to serve these is cupcakes with a cream cheese buttercream icing.

It is important to mix the chocolate and boiling water before adding the mixture to the other ingredients.

It is about as chocolatey as you are going to get with just cocoa powder, and I would definitely make this again. I baked it as a sheet cake in glass pan, and it cooked very evenly. I had to sub the butter with coconut oil and used 6 1/2 tsp baking powder as I couldn't find the baking soda. I think it turned out very well and plenty moist. I also served it with a cherry compote.

Second cake I tried ... came out really pretty and easy to make for a Novice!  Taste is ok, I will try making this recipe again using Crisco instead of butter as many others suggested.

I substituted butter for the butter flavored Crisco, but other than that I followed the recipe. I did not like it at all. It just tasted a little bland.

this was good... we made it and shared at the Bible institute~!!!it was to share for my husband's birthday..  Most didn't try it but I don't care, more for us!! haha !! I think they like the more sugary one available,.... my birthday is tomorrow so this cake will do for both of us.. I used blue agave to sweeten the frosting somewhat...however I tried the one they mentioned in the recipe~~ since they didn't give an actual recipe forthe frosting....I separated the eggs and beat separately and added dark chocolate chips .. the cake base is a typical cocoa based cake~! It doesn'thave a devil food cake flavor.. you would have to try it .. my husbandliked it and that is all that matters ~!!

I've made this A LOT. Sometimes I add some high quality chocolate chips. Other times, I leave it as is. I'm pretty liberal with my vanilla. The texture can actually vary quite a bit.

 If I mix it fully by hand, from start to finish, every step, with a spoon or whisk, and use chocolate chips, I've been able to make it VERY dense, heavy even. 

If I skip the chocolate chips, and use an electric hand mixer, and spend the extra time to get it pretty well whipped up, I can get it so light and airy, it becomes actually delicate, and melts in your mouth.

This is THE chocolate cake recipe, for my family. It even left a friend impressed, who HATES cake!

This is amazing. Very moist. I used half butter and half shortening. I did add about a teaspoon of almond extract. Once the cake was done I filled the layers with a blackberry pomegranate preserve. Then frosted with a chocolate cinnamon cream cheese  frosting. Yum! Will definitely make again.

Fantastic recipe! It actually IS dark chocolate, and is a perfect recipe if you're looking for something packed with chocolate flavor and not too sweet. Out of personal preference, I added a tiny bit more salt and used a tiny bit less sugar, but it's good just the way it is.

I made this cake for my mom's birthday, and it turned out great! I always hate using boxed mixes, and so I had been searching for a really good chocolate cake to make. I've tried some that were good, but just weren't chocolate-y enough. This recipe fits that requirement! This was easy to make, the texture was wonderful without being too dry, and tasted so good. I will definitely make this one again soon! (now if I could just learn how to decorate cakes, but that's a whole other issue)

This recipe is wonderful and elegant. I don't mean hold-the-teacup-with-your-pinky-out elegant, I mean that it is a simple, well-designed recipe which gives the intended result without unnecessary complications. 

Most wonderfully, this recipe is forgiving. I followed it as accurately as I could, but I was baking in a shared kitchen in a university dormitory. I had to cut it by 1/3 because we only have two pans. We don't have tea spoons or table spoons. We just have spoons. Our measuring cups are nearly worthless. Our oven is unreliable. I still got a beautiful, moist, flavorful, velvety dark chocolate cake. It rose a little more in the middle than I wanted, but I think that's because I couldn't measure the baking powder or baking soda. 

For the middle I made and used a quick rhubarb-cinnamon compote. The sour tang really paired well with the lush chocolate of this cake. Wonderful recipe!

This is my go to chocolate cake recipe.  However, I do make one slight modification.  I add one Hershey's Special Dark Pudding Mix and reduce the amount of AP flour by an equal amount (about 3/4 cup).  This makes the cake exceptionally moist. Make sure you beat the sugar/butter for about 5 minutes to make it light and airy.

I also like to add 3/4 bag of Special Dark chocolate chips in the mix.  This add that unexpected bit of texture to the cake.  This is especially nice if you are using this recipe for cup cakes.

I made this recipe for a family dinner and it was a huge hit!! As others suggested I whipped the butter and sugar for over 2 minutes. I also cooked it in 2 10" springform pans. It made 2 good size tiers. I put strawberry filling between the layers and frosted it with cream cheese frosting... Delicious!! I will definitely use this as my go to chocolate cake recipe from now on. Very moist and versatile!

I have been baking this cake for years now, what I did to make it more moist is add a cup of chocolate pudding, I do not take anything out from the recipe. It is a hit for anyone and anyone I make this cake for. In fact it is so good that I have to fight with people to try other cakes when I bake.

Best cake ever!  This was a really easy recipe to follow.  I used 1 cup of instant coffee and one cup of hot water.  I also made it in a bundt pan for 45 min- this is a keeper! 

Everyone at the party requested the recipe.

Amazing! This is my go to birthday cake recipe, it's perfect. I substitute oil for butter so it stays moist.

Fantastic. I braved it and made it without alteration. I do a -lot- of cooking and baking from scratch, and can say this is the best consistency chocolate cake I've found for a moist, soft, springy cupcake. If you like a denser, richer cake, you might want to try a different recipe (I personally use my mom's triple layer cake recipe). But if you're looking for that perfect cupcake texture with a delicious, not overly sweet flavor, look no further.

It's the second time I've tried this recipe and it's been a hit both times. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to use 1cup boiling water and 1cup of coffee (instead of 2cups of boiling water). Not dry as some reviews claimed.

This was the very first chocolate cake I have ever baked, and it was fantastic. I baked it for my father's birthday party, and everyone was beyond impressed! It was deeply dark, soft, fluffy, and so delicious that my mom, who usually cannot stand anything with chocolaty flavour, raved about it after finishing a whole piece! I only made a couple of small adjustments to suit my pantry at the time: 1) I had dutch-processed cocoa powder, so I added 2 tablespoons of sugar to the recipe, and 2) as I only owned two 9-inch pans, I divided the batter into two cakes and baked them for 50-55 minutes at 340 degrees F. Once they were cooled, they were topped with some store-bought vanilla frosting, then one was decorated with raspberries along the edge, the other with almond slices. The toppings didn't really matter in terms of the flavour as the cakes themselves tasted far superior than any other cakes that I have ever had, but they sure helped with the looks! Everyone ooh-ed and ah-ed when the cakes entered the dining room.

As a super market cake decorator, I never baked my own cakes.  The was my first cake from scratch and it was great.  I made it with 2 other recipes from here...chocolate ganache and a whipped topping made with sour cream that went great with the dark chocolate.

This is the easiest and best chocolate cake I have ever made. This is my new official chocolate cake recipe. I was surprised at how delicious & moist it was. Can't wait to make cupcakes out of this & top w/ a nice 7 minute icing! Perfect :)
p.s. I used even amounts of butter & coconut oil.

This is the ONLY chocolate cake recipe I will ever use. Not too sweet but a very deep true chocolate flavor! You get a big cake with this recipe so I often cut it in half, somehow when I do that the batter always ends up a bit thin so I just add more flour. Holds up beautifully for decorating and does just fine as cupcakes. If you are looking for an amazing (and easy) chocolate cake recipe, stop here!! You found it!!

I can't say how it would be made with butter, but I made it substituting coconut oil (for a chocolate coconut cake). I also used dark chocolate cocoa and milk instead of water. The cake was sooo good! Very moist and not overly sweet.

Made it with coffee in place of water.  It was very good and very rich.  Next time I will serve it with just some whipped cream or a sprinkle of powdered sugar instead of icing.  I made this in a non stick bundt pan, sprayed with pam and dusted with cocoa powder and some still stuck.  next time I will use butter or Crisco instead of the spray.

This recipe is great! I cut back on the sugar by using just under 2 cups. I have also made 1/2 the recipe and bake 48 mini cupcakes! I use fun paper liners, bake for 12 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a conventional oven.

So disappointed! I'm looking for a dark chocolate cake to use for my wedding cake so I spent the extra on cake flour and top shelf ingredients. This turned out very dry with very little chocolate flavor.  I live at almost 7,000 feet but don't know that it would have anything to do with it. Wish I knew what went wrong, it looked so promising!

Huge hit! Home run with this one. Cake was firm and dense without being hard or dry. Full flavor. I used half regular coco and half dark chocolate coco. Making my second one right now! Making cupcakes with this one. I used a whipped cream topping on the first cake a make and it was a perfect match for the flavors in the cake. Thank you a million times for posting this!!

I made this cake for a coworker's birthday at work and everyone raved about it! The first time I made it was a little too rich for my taste, so the second time I added a little less cocoa powder.  I also did a raspberry jam filling, chocolate frosting and put fresh raspberries on top.  I served it with raspberry chocolate ice cream. I'm still getting praises about how good it was.

Just made this and so far, I am not impressed.  I'm no expert, but I followed this recipe to a T and it's dry and crumbly.  Not very rich tasting either, as you would expect from a dark chocolate cake.

Cake has good flavor (licking the bowl was fabulous!), but it stuck to the pan so bad that it came out in pieces/crumbs.  Going to look for some sort of recipe that calls for cake pieces, trifle maybe, so that I can just put it in a bowl.  Cutting it with a knife is out for sure.  Glad I was just making this for my family and not for an event.

Yum, I put half brown sugar and half white sugar and a half a cup of sour cream and it tasted like brownies! I will use this as one flavor for my wedding cake since it stays together well. I was wondering what would happen if I used brownies as wedding cake anyway so this is great!

The texture and moisture were fine, but even with a thick layer of chocolate frosting, I didn't find the cake to have very good flavor.  It wasn't nearly sweet enough or chocolate-y enough.  I'd rather have a box-cake any day.

This was FANTASTIC! I ended up halving it and making a different layer from a different layer.  It worked out great but I really recommend watching the cooking video.

This cake is incredibly moist and delicious! The only thing that took more time than I expected was cooling the chocolate mixture. I would recommend making the chocolate mixture in advanced for this reason! Otherwise this cake is amazing!

Made this for my Dad's birthday.  Should have tried it out first...

I have to join in with the many folks who say it was too dry (it WAS) and too hard to get out of the pans.  I did use the coffee trick, so the flavor was quite nice.

We tried to save it by eating it with vanilla ice cream, but still too dry.

This cake is wonderful!!! It is very velvety yet still light. It has a nice rich chocolatey fudge flavor to it. I took the advice of another reviewer and used strong brewed coffee instead of water and seperated the eggs and beat the egg whites seperately with about 1/4 cup of the sugar. I will make this cake again...probably next week for a party :) Thank you!
UPDATE: I made this again with the three layers and made a double batch of Chocolate Butter-Creme Frosting found on this site between the layers and One Minute Chocolate Icing, also found on this site, on the outside (gives it a wonderful chocolate glossy coating that helps seal in the moisture). To me it was the perfect combo of sweetness and rich fudgy chocolate!

This is the only chocolate cake recipe that I use now.  I had a one bowl chocolate cake recipe of my Mom's that I thought was the best, but this is a topper.  Used this recipe to make a few hundred mini cupcakes for a wedding they turned out perfect.  Makes a lovely moist cake that is not crumbly.  Perfect for cake decorating.  Makes a very large cake (3 layer) or about 3 dozen regular cupcakes.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! Very dense but very moist. My largest glass mixing bowl was just barely big enough and the batter appeared a little runny going into the pans, but all turned out great. I also used 2 - 8 inch round cake pans with the listed ingredient amounts.

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet. This is by far my favorite chocolate cake recipe EVER. First off, a few adjustments: instead of boiling water I use very strong freshly brewed coffee, then, at the very end after all of my ingredients are mixed I throw in 8 spoonfuls of Plain Yogurt (NOT fat free and NOT sugar free). 

Definitely split between three 9" rounds - I used 2 and one of them overflowed (although this only happened ONCE out of the 6 times I've made this cake). 

This cake is *always* a hit, it's super moist and dense and I've been told "this is the best chocolate cake I've ever had" from other fellow bakers. Pair it with a butter cream frosting, cream cheese frosting or better yet... a butter/cream cheese frosting!!!

This is a beautiful tasting moist chocolate cake that looked great as a two layered cake once i covered it with cream cheese frosting. My problem is that I couldn't get mine out the pans without the edge sticking and crumbling off. I used baking paper but it stuck to it! I made sure my butter and eggs were room temp and I creamed the butter and sugar well to make sure it was aerated. I allowed the water and cocoa to cool and I added flour first and last when adding it with the chocolate water to the butter mixture. I'm not sure what went wrong?! I did add a shot of expresso but that was my only change.

I have to say - this is one of the easiest recipes ever, and comes out so delicious, rich, moist, fluffy.. I've made it many times and I love it.
Notes:
-- I usually make it with cream cheese frosting.
-- This cake should stay in the fridge for about 2 days before eaten. The time there makes it nicely moist.

I'm still new(ish) to baking, but this recipe was easy and delicious.  I only had half a cup of cocoa powder, so I used some melted unsweetened chocolate to make up for the difference and it gave the cake a nice fudginess.  I used a chocolate-raspberry cream-cheese frosting and it went really nicely with the cake.  I think I'll bake it just a minute less next time, though.

This is a great recipe. Like another reviewer, I added the juice from one orange (about 1/3 of a cup) and it didn't change the consistency much, but added a VERY light orange flavor. I made one cake in a springform (filling the form 1/2 way) and had to bake for 50 minutes at 350F. I made mini cupcakes with the rest of the batter, filling 3/4 high and baking 12 minutes. They were FANTASTIC!!

After finding this recipe, I scaled it to serve 20. (Sheer bravery for a first use of the recipe!) I baked in 10" oversizes cake pans and split the layers, so I had a tall cake. I then used it as basis for a black forest cake. I drained dark sweet pitted cherries and used the juice to moisten each layer as a put it together.  After that, I covered each layer with ganache and topped with cherries that had been drained.  After the top layer was on I covered the whole thing in ganache, topped heavily with the drained cherries, and used a pastry bag to rim the very bottom of the cake with whipped cream mixed with confectioners sugar.  I also did a rim around the top circling the cherries.  This was done for my son's birthday and he and his friends thought it was awesome.  It was pretty, however, I bake a lot of cakes and I thought the cake was dryer than I prefer.  I'll do it again, but figure out some way to moisten it up.  But all in all, good recipe!

Great basic cake!  Amazing as is, moist and very chocolatey, but can be dressed up in many ways.  I added cherry preserves to the batter and a cherry buttercream filling and made Black Forrest type cupcakes.  This has become my go to chocolate cake.

Made this with strong coffee instead of water, two tablespoons more cocoa, and half-butter and half-applesauce. Baked in a single pan. The texture was great, and the cake was very moist, but it was a little bit bland to be had on its own. With the One Minute Chocolate Icing, though, and a bit of strawberry sauce, it was amazing. Will make again!

This is my new chocolate cake recipe for everything!  Most importantly, I find it an extremely easy and tasty recipe to adapt for my daughter who has food allergies.  By using gluten-free flour and bananas in place of eggs we have an excellent cake.  She never feels like she is missing out on anything.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  We use it all the time. :c)

I have been making and decorating cakes for years now, and I have a "go to" chocolate cake recipe.  Well after trying this recipe - I have a NEW "go to".  This cake is so moist and delicious - very easy to make with excellent results.  Did not change a thing - made into cupcakes with a peanut butter dream filling and the "fluffy white frosting" recipe from this site.  Absolutely awesome!!

I have been making this cake for many years now, and used this recipe to make two wedding cakes (including my own). I am not a professional cook, but this cake turns out perfectly every time. I generally substitute 1/2 c or 1 cup coffee/espresso (depending on how strong it is) for some of the boiling water, which adds a lovely depth of flavor to this already rich cake. I love this with a raspberry filling and a coconut lime buttercream frosting. A dash of rum goes beautifully in the frosting, or (if it doesn't need to be kid friendly) I brush a thin layer of rum over the top of the cake before adding filling/frosting to keep the moisture in as well. Enjoy!

This is a good recipe that i have found so far But in my oven it took nearly one hour to bake it. Again one more problem that i faced was, my cake does not bake well in the middle even if it bakes nicely around the center. The center part of the cake gets a u shape, which rises up from the other surface of it.

This is a wonderful recipe and it's easy to make.  I made one 8 inch round cake and 18 cupcakes.  If you like moist cake then don't bake it more than 25 min. The surface does dome up and crack.  Like someone suggested, I used the frosting from "Extreme Chocolate Cake" and it worked with the cake very well.  The frosting does get a bit sweet so I cut down half cup of sugar on the cake.

This was the FIRST chocolate cake recipe that I've found that doesn't taste "watery"! Everyone who has tried it LOVES it! I love to bake from scratch, and I will be making this cake recipe for years to come! It's the perfect chocolate cake! It's thick, moist and super rich!

Exceptional recipe! Super moist and just dense enough! The only change I made was to use 1/2 cocoa powder 1/2 dark cocoa powder - just a personal preference for super dark. I've used it for weddings, showers, birthdays - you name it! By far the BEST chocolate recipe out there! Thank you!!!

I have made this recipe so many times...and everytime people rave about how moist it is. I have made it into cupcakes and adjusted the times, and it came out perfect. I topped the cupcakes with chocolate ganache, (another recipe on this site) and those things disappear like candy. I am now baking a birthday cake for my husband, and I am going to make some chocolate mousse filling. Its going to be superb!

Great and easy cake recipe.  I used this to make a Dora cake for my daughter.  The batch fit perfectly in a Wilton cake form.

What a yummy & moist recipe!  My only issue was turning the cakes out.  I think that was my fault!  I made a three layer dark chocolate with my own peanut butter creamchees frosting cake. People couldn't get enough! It was like induldging in a giant peanut butter cup!  I did add a quarter cup extra of the cocoa powder, being a chocoholic and all...lol!   Absolutely awesome cake recipe!

Incredibly tasty and rich cake.  I used coffee in lieu of water as well.  My only complaint was that I did not get a very fluffy cake.  It was a bit denser/heavier than typical.  This was my first cake from scratch - a relative said that she has never had a scratch cake turn out very fluffy, but that's ok.

Awesome, and I made them healthy with half-applesauce and half-oil. I also used whey low and splenda in place of the sugar. They were so moist. Oh, I also added 3/4 t. cinnamon extract.

Absolutely amazing! I used coffee instead of water and baked it in a 9x13, and it came out very moist and pretty much perfect. Definitely a recipe I'll use again!

I followed the directions to a T, used Mexican Vanilla and scraped a vanilla bean into it. I made it Black Forest style with some homemade cherry filling and 1/4 c. chocolate chips. Then made it into cupcakes with some of the cherries and a chocolate drizzle (from the Quick Black Forest Cake recipe). People went nuts over it. They are still talking about it weeks later!

I love this cake!!! It tastes wonderful and has great texture!!! It does take a night in the fridge to harden enough to frost and put fondant on though.

Very good indeed, I substituted probably 3/4 cup boiling water with hot coffee and it turned into an intensely dark, chocolate, coffee flavored cake! I used a caramel frosting and topped it off with ganache. Great recipe.

Tasty cake, very crumbly. Tried to use with the wilton heart tasty fill pan but not very successful. Would think that a bundt pan would have worked great.

Very yummy! I replaced half the butter with 1/2 cup of mashed bananas to reduce fat. Gave it a bit of a banana-y flavor. Baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 35 minutes, and the cake came out with perfect texture and density. Iced it with my basic butter icing recipe, in the chocolate variety, and its wonderful! Definitely will be making this cake again!

it was  crumbly, dry, sort fudgy. I didnt like the cake but it had good taste. its also stuck to pan, icouldnt gte it out of my bundt pan by any means, even  tho i buttered nd greased it well enough or s it seemed. I used oil insteand of butter yet it turned bad but no tthat, usually choc cakes made w/ oil tastes better than butter for me atleast. i also used hot milk instead of water and i think thats what made it goodc to eat and not throw in the grabage.  the recipe is similar to one bowl choclatte cake in this website. Not so good. I wont make it again

Was also a bit disappointed after reading all the awesome reviews.  I found that this cake was a bit too dense, not quite sweet enough, and slightly dry.  I would try it again with more baking powder, sugar and possibly a little milk.

My husband is a chocolate lover.  Last year for his birthday, I chose this cake for his celebration and made him a three layer cake.  This year, since I decided to make it as a bundt.  Both delicious, but, I have to say that we prefered the three layer method.  It truly brings out the airiness of this spectacular recipe.  I used the buttercream fudge frosting recipe also from this website substituting the hot fudge ingredient with Nutella.  Any chocolate lovers out there, you owe it to yourself to bake this heavenly cake!

If I could give this recipe over 5 stars - I would. It is, by far, the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever made and, subsequently, eaten.  After reading all of your reviews, I decided to go for it and I do not regret it for a second. It came out moist, dense but, simultaneously light and fluffy. It has the perfect chocolate/sweet balance. I had no trouble with it sticking to the pans as I lined them completely with parchment paper first.  A cake I will make again, again and again. A++

I wanted to make a birthday cake for a Swedish friend who loves chocolate - but of the European kind.  More rich less sweet.  This was perfect.  Substituted a cup of cafe mocha for one of the cups of water. Iced with with Kahlua icing.  Filled it with Mocha Mousse.  A huge hit!

Made this today for my husband's 60th birthday...absolute perfection!  I added 1 tsp instant coffee to boiling water & upped the vanilla to 2 tsp (by accident).  Simply the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made - and everyone agreed!  I frosted it with the simple Cream Cheese Frosting II.  This is truly an amazing cake!  Thanks Carol!

Used this recipe for the top of my daughter's princess castle cake (bottom was David's yellow cake). I have baked store bought and from scratch chocolate cake many times, but this is fantastic! At least I know what's going into the cake and it's from my own pantry. I loved how this cake turned out! Just the right amount of chocolate. My daughter is a chocolate lover (just like mom). Followed the recipe, and the end result was a moist, just enough sweetness, and delicious chocolate cake. I baked the cake for 35 mins (older oven) and turned out fine. I used a stick to pierce middle of cake around 30 mins time, and came out unclean, so baked for another 5 mins. The recipe is easy to follow. I decorated castle cake with buttercream frosting. I will continue to use recipe and recommend to friends. I post post pic of cake soon. Thanks for recipe.

I would actually say 3 & 1 half. This recipe was ok it defiantly the best chocolate cake recipe I have tried. To make it better I would add more sugar and flour.

didn't have boxed mix so I needed a scratch recipe.  This was good, better than box mix, but wasn't exceptional, would have liked a moister cake.

This was delicious!  I made it for my fiance's birthday over the weekend and it was a big hit at his party.  I don't think I will ever buy boxed cake again.  Definitely a recipe I will make again and again.  P.S.  I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing about it.

I had expected it to be a little more moist. This is not the moistest cake I've made. The cake turned out only ok moist when it first got out from the oven but turned a little on the dry side for me the next day. It might be due to the cold weather.   The cake is definitely not overly sweet but maybe due to the Cocoa Powder I used. I used Valhorna Cocoa Powder and added about 1/2 tbsp of coffee powder to the cake.  I only baked 1/2 the portion as I needed chocolate cake for part of my cake creation.   I did not have problems removing cake from the pan because, I greased and "floured" the pan. Plus I used a Spring Form Pan to bake it.

We love this! I make it all of the time. It's the best recipe I have ever come across... and so quick to whip up! I don't have round pans, so I put it in a casserole dish and a half-casserole dish. It turns out moist and delicious every time!

Loved the taste and didn't have any trouble with it sticking or being dry.  Like other reviewers mentioned, always cream the butter and sugar really well so they are fluffy.  I sprayed a bundt pan well with cooking spray and it slid right out.

This was soo friggin good its ridiculous. I made it for my moms birthday and now everyone wants one. I made 3 batches for a big rectangular 3 tier cake, placed strawberries and whipped cream in the middle layers and topped it off with butter cream frosting and chocolate shavings. Gorgeous!

Since I'm using a springform pan...I reduced the boiling water to 1 cup. I didn't used butter but replaced it with oil instead. I add a tbsp of coffee essense..you may used coffee granules by mixing it with the hot water.The cake taste amazing....I really like it..thanx Carol!!

My family loved this recipe! I'm no great baker, but I had no problem making this come out perfectly. The only thing I changed is that I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder to make it extra dark. It worked!

I gave this recipe a 5 because my family absolutely loved it (topped it with a homemade cream cheese frosting).  I thought it needed to be sweeter, but other than that it was really an easy to follow recipe.

This cake was super moist and delicious, I substituted buttermilk for the boiling water. I baked it in a bundt pan and couldn't get it out... It turned into a bit of a souffle and puffed up! As it sat on the counter to cool (on a rack) it fell in at one spot. It was so moist and delicious that the ruined presentation didn't make any difference.

This is a lovely cake. I used the coffee variation instead of boiling water. I also used homemade cherry jam to spread between the layers, then used a mocha icing to cover and decorate the cake. It was a big hit at the dinner party I took it to. I'll be making this cake again today for my nephew's 7th birthday, without the coffee. This cake has an excellent moist, slightly dense texture that keeps it from being too crumby. Also, the recipe is super easy.

I made this with only one change--I subbed coffee for the 2 c. of water. It made a 9x13 pan and a smaller 8" round. I topped both with a simple vanilla buttercream frosting. Delicious!

A great chocolate cake. I made it for a co-workers birthday, paired with simple vanilla buttercream, and it got rave reviews. I only had two round pans, so I made two, taller layers and discarded about a cup of batter. Great chocolate flavor.

Wow. I used this recipe, but cut back on the sugar a bit and added a little more cocoa. I also replaced the wheat flour with Oat flour as my son is allergic to wheat. I also added strawberries to the mix and WOW! Is was sooooo yummy and moist as I put it in a deep pan. The key is to always under bake about 5 - 8 minutes. It went in less than 20 minutes. Great recipe!

An easy to follow recipe with outstanding results! The cake was sweet enough on its own, no icing was required. I did however top it off with a sprinkling of icing sugar to give it a finished look.

Never have made a cake before this one and I chose to use it to make a three layer cake and it came out great! I would give it four stars for the taste but I figure that since it was my first one someone with experience could make this cake taste divine.

This cake was easy to make and everyone loved it. BIG HIT! I don't usually care for Chocolate Cake but this one is just "wow". Since it got good reviews I decided to give a try and I have no regrets Will make it again, that's for sure

I have never made a chocolate cake before and followed this recipe to the letter. It was easy to make and comes out so beautifully. It was moist enough, rich, and really pretty. Everyone liked it and I would definitely make it again.

this cake is good and moist. i didn't have problem takin it out from the pan unlike some other reviewers. i made it 2 times already,1st w/ creme patissiere filling; 2nd w/ caramel sauce. the latter one is better.it's good as basic cake, but your filling gotta compliment the cake, otherwise, it'll either be too heavy or just plain.. but all in all, this recipe is a keeper! thanks for sharing!

This is the worst cake I have ever made! I followed the directions exactly and the layers just cracked and fell apart! I have never seen anything like it!  I thought maybe I did something wrong, but looking through the other reviews, others had the same exact problem. It tasted ok, but what a huge mess.

I love this recipe.  I gave it four stars, but I always add a big packet of chocolate fudge jello and it's definitely a 5!  The rest of the recipe stays the same.

Excellent cake! Very easy to make with straight forward directions.  Goes great with (red) raspberries and a light cream cheese icing.

I'm rating it 5 stars for the crumb and texture.  Perfect recipe to start with. It has the perfect density and moistness I desire.  I would give 5 stars for taste if the recipe had called for coffee and dark chocolate.

This cake was out of this world. I used it to bake the base if a princess cake and it held up to the pressure very well. It had a smooth crumb and silky texture. I did use dark cocoa as we like a very dark chocolate. I might decrease the sugar just a bit next time though if I plan to fill it becausee then it's just a little too sweet.

Okay, though I hate it when people alter the recipe, I'm guilty of doing it for this recipe. I'm sure the recipe is fabulous as is, but I made slight modifications. I replaced about 3/4 of the water with coffee and added a couple of squares of dark chocolate to the cocoa mix. I took out half of the butter and substituted it with 1/4 c. applesauce. Also replaced 1/2 c of all purpose flour with whole wheat and added about 2 T of flax seeds. Other than the coffee, I couldn't even taste any of the substitutions! And yumm man was that cake good eatin'.

This recipe was fantastic! I substituted buttermilk for water, heated it and added 2 ounces of bakers chocolate stirring until melted. It was a nice extra kick of flavor. It can be a little difficult to get out of the pan (my first one crumbled). Luckily I had enough batter for a second cake and I used parchment paper that time, worked like a charm, the cake came out perfectly intact.  Everyone loved the cake, it's great with a lemon buttercream, but I bet plain vanilla would be wonderful as well!

This cake has an amazing flavor. I gave this a 4 star cause the texture didnt work for me.  This was way to soft and crumbly for me. I was hoping to make my girls birthday cake with it but i couldnt get it out of the pan with out it crumbling.  I didnt end up using it for her but we still gobbled it up. Very yummy. I suggest using a dark cocoa for this, it makes it really rich looking. Im not sure if this is how the cake is suppose to be but it was crumbly for me.

Delicious, not too sweet, moist and chocolately - but I had some issues with the texture. I made this exactly as written, except I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9x5 loaf tin (it was done in just 20 minutes). I buttered and floured the loaf tin but it still stuck which was quite a shock to me as nothing sticks to that tin usually. The cake was also really crumbly and fell apart a bit when I turned to out to cool on a rack. The texture was extremely crumbly, soft, moist and airy. I noticed some reviewers said this turned out quite dense - it was quite the opposite for me. Due to the heat/humidity where I live, I stored it in an air-tight container in the fridge. The texture turned cardboard-like in the fridge - completely inedible - but it was less crumbly and easier to cut. I put the slices in the micro for 15 secs and the texture returned to normal. I'm think this might be better made into muffins in individual paper cups so you don't have to worry about the cake sticking to the pan or falling apart.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever made.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and it came out wonderfully moist.  Even my little sister who doesn't care too much for cake loved it.  Goes great with a simple buttercream frosting!

I have a bad history with making cakes. It is definately not my forte, if you know what I mean. Even though I am downright awful at making them, I tried this one and it was amazing! I love dark chocolate so I decided to try it and after it was done, it smelled normal(please don't ask about past experiences, you don't want to know)! My whole family (which includes 5 people) finished a 12 serving cake in 2 days. That might not seem much to you, but it is a lot for us. In conclusion, if you will most likely love this recipe like I do, and if I can do it, you can do it too! Thanks for reading my review and I hope you like this recipe! = P

We didn't like this one at all. Far too chocolaty and not sweet enough.  It was moist and fluffy, and rose well. Maybe more sugar next time would fix it.

I was worried with the batter being so runny but kept faith that it would firm up, i did have to cook it 40 minutes but that could have been due to my altitude. The family love it and is a must for those who love chocolate. Made cream cheese frosting from this site put it on while the cake was warm YUMMY !

I followed the recipe to the letter. It was fast, easy and so good. So good I had to cut it up and distribute it to the neighbors to save me from eating the entire cake. I will surely make this again when I'm sure I have help eating it!

For my sister-in-law's birthday, I made this exactly as directed. Used a chocolate custard filling and chocolate butter cream frosting. My husband and I hate cake. He has asked me to make him this cake for Easter, because it was so delicious!

this is a great recipe,  I took the suggestion of using the coffee instead of just plain water.  It was yummy.  The only thing is you must line the pan with baking paper,  it will stick.  I frosted the cake half a stick of butter,half a stick of cream cheese, pwdr sugar and light cream.  It tasted great.

I made this cake for my husbands 50th B-day and it was a very easy recipe.  I followed the advice of another review and lined my 3 pans with wax paper so it didn't stick.  It came out with ease. The only problem was I baked it for 25 min and it was still not done in the middle so I put it in for the additional 5 mins - which was too long. It came out very dry. I should have checked it at 2 mins.  I will try to make it again based on all the great reviews.  I made it with the homeade frosting from the site-Quick and Almost-Professional Buttercream Icing (plus I added Smuckers Strawberry preserves to it-EXCELLENT). Thanks for sharing

Cake was a little dry and REALLY stuck to the pan.  Iwas able to save the cake and got compliments on it from co-workers.  (I made it for a birthday.)  The hassle really wasn't worth it though.

This chocolate cake was moist and easy to work with for a layered cake. The only changes I made were to use coffee rather than plain water (since it actually enhances the chocolate flavor without leaving a coffee taste) and 60% chocolate rather than cocoa powder (since I had better quality chocolate than cocoa powder on hand). I iced with chocolate italian buttercream and topped it with fresh currants for a two-tier wedding cake. It got amazing reviews. Only advice I have to offer for those doing layers is to freeze the cake prior to cutting into layers. It's easier to cut and as long as it's wrapped tight, no one can tell the difference flavor wise.. You know, as long as it's defrosted before they bite into it... :)

Wow... just wow. BAKE THIS CAKE!  I screwed up by trying to make it in one pan and it had trouble baking all the way. But whatever, it is sooo good.  Combined it with the cream cheese icing recipe, made with 1/2 the sugar called for. Divine.

This is a wonderful recipe that produces a devils food type rich chocolate cake.   I actually halved the recipe because a 3 layer cake is just way too much for our family of four. By doing 6 servings it resulted in 2 nice 8in layers.   The cake is incredibly moist and light and well just darn perfect. I also can say that since I ran out of butter I used Imperial margarine (good for baking with) and it in no way harmed the recipe.

This is a heavenly cake! I haven't really tried it yet but there was a little piece that came off (very tiny) that I tried after taking it out of the oven and it was so good I was thinking of making it a two layer cake instead of three (just so I could sit there and eat one layer of it)! The solution to the cake sticking to the pan is definitely greased parchment paper!

I used butter flavored shortening (no trans fat) instead of butter and it was really good and moist.  I frosted it with the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting from this site, and it was perfection!!

Made this cake twice so far, this time it came out good, very chocolaty and dark. One suggestion though, use less water, I used whipped cream as filling and chocolate ganache as the topping. Tasted even better the next day

SO yummy.   My husband wanted a "Matilda" cake like the one from the movie.   The cake is super moist and delicious.  I've tried it with this icing and I've tried it with a traditional chocolate frosting, and each time it was a hit, it just depends on how rich you want your cake.   Making it again tonight for my son's bday and remembered i hadn't sent a thank you for the recipe!

Cake was ok.  I thought it was much too crumbly, and it stuck pretty badly to the pan. I wanted a cake that was more moist and dense, so I don't think I'll be making this one again.

This cake came out amazing. It was so chocolatey, and the top was a little fudgy...just was I was looking for! I would make it into a loaf style, and not even top it with frosting it was so good. Yum yum! :)

After baking this cake, I wanted to give it 4 stars because I did not finish using all of the liquid. The batter would be very thin if I had and I'm not sure if I should have added everything. Yet, after realising that I've used the wrong flour (self raising instead) the cake still turned out beautifully and I've changed my mind to make it 5 stars. Probably because of the liquid, the taste of egg yolk was pretty strong. I used it for a birthday cake. Freezed the two layers (halfed the recipe) overnight and thawed them. After dressing it up, it tasted wonderful and the yolk taste wasn't as distinct. I did use a white frosting recipe instead and placed strawberries between the layers. Delish. Thank you I would be making this again!

This cake was pretty good, but a little dry for my tastes. Next time I would probably add some sour cream or maybe even oil to make it more moist. I got good feedback from my guests I served it to, so all in all it went over well. Not the perfect chocolate cake recipe but probably a great base recipe.

i've made this cake several times and it's been a hit each time! i've actually been able to prove to my family that i can bake using this recipe :-) one adjustment though, i usually put equal amounts of baking soda & baking powder (2tsp) of each. other than that this recipe is PERFECT!

Excellent recipe. I followed it exactly and came up with a great result. The resulting cake was a bit less stable than I'm used to (when I turned it out of the pan, some of the edge crumbled off), but as it was my first cake from scratch I don't know whether that was because cake mixes are generally more stable, or through human error. :) Still, excellent result, time consuming but not challenging, and I'll be making this again.

First made-from-scratch cake.  I made a mistake and added an extra 1/2 cup sugar, so I offsetted it by adding 1/2 cup butter.  As a result it came out too sweet but that's my fault.  Otherwise it was EXCELLENT.  I never knew I could make such a delicious cake.  Of course, no more store-bought or boxed cakes for me.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

Very rich and super moist! My fiance LOVES this cake! I also like to halve the recipe, add 1 tsp of orange extract, and make chocolate orange cupcakes! Tastes just like a Terry's chocolate orange if it were to be in cake form! Delicious!

This recipe was delicious just reading it. I made this with my 4 year old and we enjoyed every part from start to finish. I topped it with some rainbow chip frosting with some cocoa powder and cake batter mixed in. Add a tall glass of milk and this cake was gone in 1 day in between just three of us. MMMmmmm MMMmmmm MMMMMMMmmmmmm!

This turned out bitter and dry, but looked lovely.  I was drooling with anticipation, until I took a bite.  I have to say dark chocolate is my favorite.  Took time to cream the butter/sugar.  Not sure what happened, but not making again :-(  I did downsize the recipe to six servings, so not sure if something was "lost in translation."

I followed this recipe to the "T", with only one slight modification. I used soft silk cake flour instead of regular flour.  For the former complaint about the cake being dry, I can say after 3 days the cake was still moist. This cake had the right amount of sweetness, chocolate, and the texture was light and fluffy. So, for it to be stated that the cake was a "wal-mart" equivalent and dry, was incorrect. I could see if you use a sugar frosting the cake could seem more store bought, but if you use a  stable whipped creamed frosting the cake will taste like heaven.

Not the perfect recipe for a rich cake but I agree with the other reviewers that it is a great cake to use as a base. The flavor is not very rich so you can add ice cream or very sweet icing and not have it be overwhelming in flavor. I used the recipe to make mini cupcakes and it was too much batter. I will cut the recipe in half next time!!!

Very good ! I've tried a few other cakes from this site but they turned out to be an absolute mess. This was perfect. I am not a fan of dark chocolate but I loved this recipe. It was not too sweet or bitter. 

Loved it.

I will never bake any other kind of chocolate cake again.  My son requested a "rich, chocolate cake" for his birthday and I found this one with it's favorable reviews and thought I'd try it.  I know, you should never try a new recipe for something important but I trust the reviews on allrecipes and it's a good thing-this was the best cake I've ever eaten and I'm not particularly fond of cake.  I too frosted with the ganache and the whole cake was beyond amazing.

Don't change a thing!  I made the recipe just as stated and it was perfect.  The cake was moist, dense, and had a rich chocolate flavor.  I frosted with chilled 'chocolate ganache' from this site.

I really don't know how to rate this one.  It's really rich, and has a great chocolate taste. Other than that, it's just cake.  Nothing overly special.  I don't understand where the "elegant" comments are stemming from? It's a little on the dry side (just a bit), so next time I'll probably add a little sour cream for extra moisture.

OMG... this is the best chocolate cake. I followed directions, but only used two 9 inch pans and increased baking time and it came out perfect. I did make a chocolate/hazelnut mousse and put a think layer on top of the first cake laer, than added the top cake layer (I put a 9 inch springform around) it and then put in the the fridge over night. I topped it all off with chocolate ganache.
I took it to a friend's house and everyone loved it.

Absolutely wonderful! I did add some strong coffee and a handful of semi-sweet choc chips to the cocoa - hot water mixture. This will be a family favorite.

This is an excellent cake. It is moist and taste really good (tastes just like Betty Croker's chocolate cake}. I just make some little personal changes, that I read in other reviews, like for example using olive oil instead of butter 1 1/4.  I separated the egg yolks from the whites and added the last one at the end with a wooden spoon, just folding the batter with the egg whites, also I used dark pans so I needed to lower the temperature 25 degrees.  This work really well and the cake was indeed done in 30 minutes. It is the best chocolate cake that I had baked, I will definitely do it again. It is a perfect cake.

This is a good cake recipe. Not too chocolately... a good base for any cake/cupcake. I hate using store bought mixes b/c of what they use in them so this was a nice find. Used Cream Cheese Frosting II  and it turned out very good. Lots of compliments. Thanks for the good recipe.

In spite of not having all the ingredients and having to substitue items this still came out wonderful.  I didn't have enough cocoa powder and had to use some semi sweet choc squares so I cut down on the sugar. I used half milk and half water. I made 2 rounds and did the rest of the batter into little muffin tops which I filled with marshmallow cream for the kids. I topped the adult rounds with whipped cream and strawberry in between the layers and dusted top with powder sugar

I actually messed up the recipe and mixed all the ingredients at the same time and it still came out pretty good...  I also made some adjustments..

I halved the recipe, used butter flavored Crisco in place of the butter (all I had was Smart Balance and I didnt want to use that), used a little more cocoa powder, melted dark chocolate and added that. I used a silicone bundt cake pan and I am not good with a timer so I just kept an eye on it. It came out a tiny bit dry but was very chocolatey. I may just play with this recipe a bit more. Great overall though! It was perfect for my bundt cake pan as a halved recipe. A full recipe would have been too much and would have not cooked enough in the center.

This is a great cake, very good taste, moist, it even rose well for me in my oven that tends not to cook evenly. It makes a big batch of batter, I used a 9x13 and still had enough for 6 cupcakes! I take "Dark" to mean the color of the cake, but the flavor is a medium chocolate. My mother makes brownies very similar to this and I have always loved those. Cocoa always makes for a great dessert. Yum!

You can forget about boxed cakes with this recipe ~ this cake was sooooo good & so easy too! Next time I will only make it in 2 - 9" pans for a thicker cake. The layers are very thin when spread out across 3 pans & that is fine if you want a layered cake - which was not what I wanted but it worked out fine in the end.

Wow, this cake is great.  So far, its the best chocolate cake that I've made from scratch.  The only thing I changed was to add 2 cups of really hot and very very strong coffee to the mixture.  It really brought out the rich dark chocolate flavour.  I made this batter into cupcakes, and I made 20 large cupcakes.  I thought I would have only come out with 12, as the recipe says "serves 12", but if making cupcakes plan to get at least 20.

I was not impressed with this cake. The flavor was okay but the cake was so crumbly that I ended up having to throw it away and make another batch (using a different recipe the second time around)

I made this recipe and I too separated the eggs.  So I incorporated the yolks one at a time and at the end folded in the egg whites.  But, I also used 1/2 cup of sour cream in place of a 1/2 cup of the boiling water.  Also, I used a high end cocoa.  This IS the best, moistest chocolate cake I have ever made. (But I was very careful not to over beat or over cook) It is a KEEPER!!!!!  Thanks for sharing....

I made this cake last night as a trial cake for my boyfriend's grandmother's upcoming birthday. Amazing. I used three 9" round cake pans, buttered and floured and the cakes did not stick at all. In the cake itself, I used one cup of brewed coffee and one cup of hot water with the cocoa. The coffee isn't pronounced in the end result, so maybe next time I'll try espresso. And the other thing I did was add one cup of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter for an extra chocolate kick. Perfect but very rich! This cake is pretty and very moist. I iced it with the chocolate buttercream recipe from this site. Heaven. And I will be making this for her birthday next week:)

a delightful change from boxed cake mixes. As a baker, i tend to experiment alot, and i have to say, this is one of my better experiments. Very SIMPLE. There was no Time where i was like, "What should i do now?" Best of all, was the simple ingredients that every cook should have on hand

I followed the directions exactly and it came out great.  The reviewer who said it is a "clean tasting chocolate cake" is correct.  No bitterness or aftertaste.  This will be my go-to recipe for a dark chocolate cake.  I also liked the fact that the boiling water melted the cocoa powder so I didn't have to beat the lumps out.  Great recipe all the way around!

I screwed up and forgot the vanilla and it was still pretty good.  I loved the texture, it was fluffy and moist.  I can't wait to make it again and this time add vanilla.  I also used butter cream frosting but will use chocolate next time.

A real chocolatey and dense cake. I made them into muffins and yielded about 20. I added a vanilla frosting to the cake. But it tastes just as well plain. This is a delightfully easy recipe to follow.

First cake from scratch I've ever baked! Turned out beautifully! Mine was a bit on the dry side, but I'm giving it 5 stars as it was probably my fault. 

I used 2 8" round cake pans instead of three (first mistake) so I had to add more baking time. I think I baked them for about 47 minutes total. This is what probably dried them out.  
I followed the recipe except for subbing in boiled 1% milk for the water.I also did was previous reviewers suggested and separated the egg yolks from the whites and whipped the whites with a bit of the sugar before adding them into the mix.

DO use parchment paper in the bottom of the pans! I sprayed my pans with PAM spray, then dusted with flour and then put a parchment round in the bottom. The cakes turned out flawlessly!

I originally was going to do two layers of icing on the top/sides but after my crumb coat was done I found I didn't need anymore...there were no crumbs in the crumb coat!
I used the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting recipe from this site to ice the cake.


The cake held together wonderfully. I only had two layers to my cake, but it looked professional when I cut it. No crumbs or ripped cake to be found!  Do eat this cake with a big glass of milk or scoop of ice cream. It is decadent!

This is really a wonderful cake, it's moist and delicious. I used coffee (Espresso) instead of boiling water. It gave an intense flavour. As for frosting i just used fresh whipped cream and dust it with chocolate powder

This was a very good chocolate cake.  I made cupcakes with it (30) as there was a child in my son's class that was allergic to peanuts.  I'll use this recipe again for the same reason but otherwise will just use a box.

I made this cake in my Nordicware daisy pan.  Didn't turn out of the pan well, but the cake was delicious.  (I am still trying to figure out how to get cakes out of that pan--it can be very frustrating!)  I used the remaining batter (the pan is about 8x10, and holds 10 cups of water full, so there was too much batter for it) to make a dozen cupcakes (baked 18 minutes) and they were delicious.  

The texture is delightful; light, moist and springy without being rubbery or dense.  The chocolate flavor was pronounced (I used Penzey's Dutch processed cocoa), and this would be a great base cake for yummy fillings and frosting.  (I'm thinking raspberry filling and chocolate ganache.)  It was easy to make, but use a taller bowl for mixing or you might have cocoa water everywhere.  Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely moist and delicious!  I won't be searching for a chocolate cake recipe anytime soon.  I was able to use this recipe in a teddy bear cake pan (even though the pan calls for a 2-layer recipe).  I baked it for an extra 20-30 minutes and it was still soft and moist (just needed a little leveling).  Fabulous!

This is a terrific chocolate cake, just moist enough and light in texture--definitely worth the effort. My daughter and my husband who don't like dark chocolate loved it with a vanilla butter cream frosting.

Very moist and great texture, but I found this a bit bland. With a good frosting, though, you can get around that problem.

This cake did not turn out as expected. It had really tasty batter! After I cooked it I let it cool overnight before I frosted it. It turned out to be really gummy and thick. I cooked it enough I am not exactly sure what happened but it really was really gummy and thick. Would not recommend.

Delicious cake!  I made this as cupcakes and the final product was just delicious.  It rose the perfect amount to create nice, smooth domes with SUPER moist and very chocolately cake inside.  This is now my go-to recipe for chocolate cake!

Amazing cake! Really soft and moist. I read some other reviews that said that it can be slightly rich so I added only a cup of cocoa powder and only 1 3/4 cups of sugar and it tasted lovely!

I used whipped cream and a dark chocolate truffle paste as my filling and just covered the whole cake with melted chocolate and a dusting of powder. Absolutely perfect recipe!

I tried this cake twice, followed the recipe exactly but had to bake it in only one (11 inch) springform since I do not have three 9 inch forms. I wanted to slice it in the middle and have a two layer cake like I always do with package cake mixes. Therefore the baking time was a bit longer (35 minutes in all, the toothpick came out wet after 30 min.). However - the cake was both times very dry, and the taste bland. I give it two stars because the dryness might be my fault (because I used the wrong pan size), but the flavor is just not impressive either.

This cake is very easy to make. Mine came out  really moist and soft. I'm not a big fan of sweet cake, so this cake was perfect. I used the chantilly frosting recipe to top the cake, and they complemented each other very well.

This was very easy to make. I didnt even have to go to the store for any random ingrediants. Mine turned out a little dry but I am sure that was my fault, I had to use pie pans to make since I didnt have 3 cake pans, also we are at high alt. 6300ft. This cake is simple to make and that is the best part if you have a baby or a busy family and not much time but want to make something from scratch.

this is one of the best choco cake recipes around. I added coffee water instead of plain water and it tastes great! I accidentaly put the mix all into one cake tin and it ended up overflowing in the oven so read the recipe carefully and use 2 tins! It could taste a lil more chocolatey and the cake is too crumbly! maybe its all the water thats making it verrryy weak and easy to break. Compared to all the weak tasting chocolate cakes, this is very nice :)

I love this cake. It's rich and moist without being too heavy in butter. I converted it to serve 6 and baked it for 50 minutes and it came out perfect every time. I just serve it plain, fresh out of the oven, or reheat it in the microwave. Delicious!

I really had my hopes up that this cake would be just what my husband wanted for his birthday. I was very disappointed. The cake was on the dry side and wasn't sweet enough. I used Hershey's unsweetened cocoa for baking. Maybe another chocolate powder would have worked better. I used the one bowl chocolate buttercream frosting recipe(using Hersheys again) and should have made vanilla buttercream frosting to sweeten/lighten things up. Next year I'll opt for a devil's food cake with vanilla frosting.

This was pretty good.  Quite fiddly with bowls everywhere!  I did make a heck of a lot though so keep in mind to do it in a large bowl.  I used a 2 litre bowl & it only just didn't spill over the edge.  Next time I will halve it as I really don't need 3 cakes at once!  I used the recipe from here too called Butter Frosting to ice it & it was pretty good.  The guys at work sure didn't complain anyway!

This was a great cake. I made it for my granddaugher's birthday and it was declared, "insanely chocolate." A chocoholic at work said it's the best chocolate cake he's had -- and that was when it was nearly 3 days old!

I don't know what happened as I followed the recipe exactly. The cake stuck in my nice new non-stick pans even after greasing them. Maybe I should have floured them also. I baked for 25 minutes, tested with a toothpick, and removed them from the oven at that time. I did not overbake, but the cake was dry and fell apart.  Threw the whole thing away.

Great cake... very rich and moist.  It could almost go without frosting but even more perfect with it.

Better than any cake mix. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out moist and fantastic.  Will never use another cake mix again.

I wasn't so impressed with the taste of this cake, and i don't see how anyone gets 3 layers out of this. next time (hypothetically) i'd just make the 2 layers, because they were so thin as per this recipe as is ... and i really greased and floured my pans and the cake still stuck and fell apart. A few people had suggested using coffee instead of water, and i'd suggest that too.

This is a nice dark cake, just like I like them!  I used coffee instead of water and half butter, half Promise spread.  I will try only Promise spread next time.  I also only used about 2/3 of the sugar.  Mine was a little dry, but I think I left it in the oven a tad too long while I was distracted with something else.  I will definitely make this again.

Def not the best chocolate cake ever.  My cake tasted too much like flour.  Also, I had never heard of using water in a cake.

Was a great cake.  We made 1/3 the size, and only  made 1 cake, but it was still great.  Very moist and delicious and went very well with our chocolate frosting.

Most Excellent!  Turned out super moist!  Made 1/2 the recipe and added some semi-sweet chocolate chips!  Not too sweet.  Great without frosting!  Vanilla ice cream and/or whip cream would be a great on top!!!  Thanks for sharing this is better than box devil's food cake!!!!

I made a coconut cream cheese frosting to go with this cake, and put it in 2 8x8 inch pans instead of the 3 round. It was amazing, according to my lover, who ate it without use of untensils (hey, it's his birthday, his cake. He can do whatever he wants.) He did give a piece to his father who then said "I hope she is a keeper, because this is delicious." My roommate also liked that it was very moist. I myself have yet to try it.

First time cake from scratch maker !!! This cake was soooo good, family that swears they hate cake and will never eat it, ate 2 or 3 servings !!! It was a huge hit! I made a delicate frosting of Heavy Cream, Vanilla, Powdered Sugar and Cocoa to taste. It went perfect with this rich yummy chocolate cake!!! Thanks SO Much!

- easy and fun to make for first timers (thats us!)
- kinda crumbly
- not too sweet, but that's ok
- the cupcakes we made were not moist enough but the cake wasn't that bad
- took us 1 hour to prepare (twice the estimated time) and we had two people too!
- overall, it was kinda good, not excellent....but good.

Although this was very tasty and not too sweet, it didn't work out as a cake for me at all.  It wasn't moist and was very crumbly and even fell apart.  I'm not at all new to cake baking but I can't figure out what happened wih this one.  Oh well.

This cake was wonderful.  It didn't have an overwhelming sweet taste, which is perfect for me, because I like my icing to be very sweet, but not my cakes.  I made this into one round cake (nine inches) and about 18 cupcakes.  I poured a lot of batter into the round pan because so many people complained about it not rising, but boy did mine rise!!  So, I guess maybe they did something wrong or something.  I topped both the cake and cupcakes with Satiny Chocolate Glaze and it was just the perfect compliment to the cakes.  Will be making this again and again!  It was so quick and easy to make!

I am on a mission to try as many chocolate cake recipes as I can in an attempt to find the perfect one for me.  This one was pretty good, with a rich cocoa taste and a tender, melt-in-the-mouth texture.  Although it hardly rose at all, it seemed so light that it was hard to stop eating it!  But all in all, I found it a little too crumbly for my liking.  I am looking for a cake with a slightly firmer crumb.

I made two rounds and one square cake with this recipe. I cut out approximately one inch out of the middle of one of the round cakes and added the curves to the square one to create a heart cake for my sweetie. The other round, I took to the Chaparral Trail Riders in Houston who ride with the Sam Houston Trail Ride Association and was invited to go on their trail ride in April as long as I bring another cake! It was enjoyed by all. Thanks!

This is by far the best chocolate cake recipe I have found.  It stays moist and has such a great chocolate flavor.  As easy as it is, there is really no need to make it from a box. I was able to make a dozen cupcakes, and 2 two layer cakes with this recipe.  UPDATE: I brought this cake to a chocolate tasting party and one comment was "This is the chocolate cake I aspire to make" Too Delish!

This cake was very good, just not moist enough for me.  It had a great rich flavour and I turned it into a black forest cake which everyone loved using the best ever white icing recipe on here.  Was VERY good but I'm going to keep looking for a lighter moist cake recipe.

Excellent cake.  People at work loved it.  I followed a reviewer's recommendation and heated oven to 350 first, then baked at 325 for 30 minutes.  It was very moist.

Thanks for an excellent chocolate recipe to show off gourmet cocoa - I used Scharfenberger cocoa (LOVE IT), and I used cake flour for a very light, elegant cake.  I served this Dec 31 and even the people who don't like sweets much liked this cake.

WOW!! This is one rich, moist cake!  Everyone that has tasted it loves it. It has just the right sweetness with a rich chocolate taste. This is the best chocolate cake from scratch that I've tried and is THE one that I'll use from now on.  (When you pair this cake with the Chocolate Cheese Frosting, it's SCANDALOUS!!!) MMMMmmmmm....Thanks a bunch!

This cake is delicious--however, I have never been able to make it so that it comes out of the pan! I tried to make it for my dad's birthday, and we ended up spooning out chunks of it into bowls with ice cream and chocolate sauce. Very yummy, but not very pretty.

In a hurry, I made this cake to impress my friend's family. It was easy, and although looked like your normal chocolate cake, it tasted rich, and just sweet enough to please almost everybody. To make it truly elegant, frosting is needed. One guest swore never to buy from the bakery ever again

I made this cake for my sister's baby shower and it was a hit.  I had never made a scratch cake before and I was a little worried that it wouldn't turn out, but it was great.  It was so easy too. Very moist and delicious, everyone loved it. Several people asked me for the recipe and I told them to come here to get it.  Thank you for the recipe.  I will make it again.

I thought this cake was the best tasting cake ever but the cakes would not come out of the pans - glued in and I've been baking for 20 years.  Thank God I used extras batter (only used 2 pans) for cupcakes - which worked or I would have been in big trouble.  I will make again - but only as cupcakes.

Excellent Recipe! It was a hit at work. I did have to make some modifications. Unfortunately, I broke rule #1 when cooking :). Make sure you have all of the ingredients. I had 1 1/2 sticks of butter so I added 1/4 cup of apple sauce to make up the difference. I also used "egg beaters" rather than regular shelled eggs. I also shredded part of a large hersey kiss into the batter! Really moist and less fatty since not using shelled eggs. I also added a tad of artifical butter flavor to make up for some of the butter I didn't use. I will try this recipe again without modifications! I just had to improvise :) Thanks

OH MY!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It is the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  Can't wait to try it on company.  I made it in a Bundt-style pan and baked 325 for 50+ mins. Perfect. So delicious it didn't need icing...though I WILL be trying it that way. Thanks again Carol!

This is a great, simple recipe but I recommend that the cake is left in the fridge overnight before serving - it improves the texture and makes it fudgier.

Perhaps I am pickier than most but I found this recipe to be somewhat dry with lots of crumbs.  I wasn't too impressed with the taste either.  For a great chocolate cake that I just baked, try the Deep Dark Chocolate Cake by The Hershey's Kitchens.  It is the best!!!

Excellent chocolate cake--everyone was very impressed.  Strangely, though, when my mother made it a second time as a sheet cake, it came out tasting a lot different, like a box cake.  But it was very good both times, just different.

My 11 year old daughter made this cake for our County 4-H Fair and won 1st Place.  It is delicious. She used a Chocolate butter cream icing on it.

A pretty good cake, but not as moist as I'd like

I loved this recipe.  The cake has a slightly red hue, like Devil's Food Cake, due to the chemistry of the cocoa and soda.  It is moist and tender.  It makes three 9-inch layers, but I also baked it in 2 10-inch pans.  I baked the layers at 325 and they were done in 25 minutes (both the 9 and 10 inch sizes). Highly recommend this  cake.  Thanks to Carol!

Great recipe, EASY.  I put it in two layer cake pans and had to cook it 15 minutes extra.  This is a keeper. 

Thanks!

This cake was absolutely delicious!!!  I would highly recommend it to everyone.  Watch out to make sure that all the pans have even amounts of batter, that was my original problem.

Very easy and the end result is excellent.  No need to look for other recipes for chocolate cake.

I have made this cake twice for two different friend's birthday parties.  It was an absolute smash hit.  Every single person who had the cake (over 20 people) said it was the absolute best cake they'd ever had.  I have e-mailed this recipe and copied it and passed it around so much in just the few weeks since I first made it.
WAY TO GO!
