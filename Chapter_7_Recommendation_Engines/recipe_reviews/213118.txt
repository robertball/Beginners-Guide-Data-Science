I didn't actually make the pasta/only the pesto sauce...I was looking for  a pesto recipe for another recipe that needed pesto sauce in it. This one was a keeper. For the "to taste" I used 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper. Update: I later made it again as a whole recipe. Everyone liked it though I did cut down on the cayenne....used less and used red pepper flakes (what I had on hand) as I thought it would be a little too spicy for our tastes.

A lot of work, but VERY good!!!! I didn't do the Pesto sauce instead I made a Alfado tomato sauce to go with it.

I just made the filling portion of this ravioli--I made my own pasta and used the best marinara sauce yet recipe for the sauce.  I am giving this 5 stars based on the filling, which was delicious with just the right amount of heat.  I did use mild Italian sausage and the full amount of cayenne pepper and it was perfect.

I thought that this was a great recipe.  I only used the filling for the ravioli this time and it was a winner.  We made our own pasta sheets and stamped out our ravioli.  The stuffing made about 145 small raviolis, which was way more than 6 servings for us.  I laid them out on a cookie sheet and flash froze them and moved them to food storage bags.  I figure that our family of three will get 3 meals out of this recipe.

Great recipe. It was a bit of tedious work to make the raviolis but it was worth it in the end.

Good recipe.  I strained and set them in warm hunts spagetti sauce with a sprinkle of parm and fresh parsley.  Fun to make - the filling makes alot of ravioli!

It wasn't bad.  I will make it again but use half as much onion.  I like onion, but ended up being the dominant flavor.

To be honest, I did not like these. They looked weird as the wanton wrappers I got were large and they were transparent when they were cooked. Also, they were very bland. I added some cream cheese to add to the taste, which gave it a little bit of a taste, but I still wouldn't make these again.
