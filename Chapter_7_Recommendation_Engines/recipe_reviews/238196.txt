I really try to follow the recipe, particularly if I'm the first reviewer, but I must say that I had my doubts about 2 tsp of lemon extract, but I added it.  Well, I was right, not only does the lemon extract overpower everything, it also leaves it very artificial tasting. I tried to weaken the lemon extract by adding a little vanilla which helped a bit.  I would recommend starting with 1/2 tsp, taste, and if more is needed, add it.  The vanilla wafers thickened it nicely and contributed good flavor, but overall, this smoothie was a disappointment.
