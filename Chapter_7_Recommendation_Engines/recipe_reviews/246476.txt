The title of this recipe is misleading - Ice cream should be sweet and spoonable. This isn't. It's more like a smoothie. I ended up adding a little stevia and a scoop of protein powder and calling it breakfast.

This was simple and delicious! My kids loved it. I had to use light vanilla almond milk (25% less sugar) because I didn't have any unsweetened vanilla almond milk. The extra sugar made it very sweet so I think following the recipe would make for a perfect healthy treat that my kids would have still loved.
