This is a great recipe!  I made only one slight change.  I added one tablespoon of melted butter to the batter.  I really like that it isn't sweet and that the crust is crunchy, but the inside is tender.  I don't understand why anyone likes to eat sweet cornbread.

This is such a great cornbread recipe! It's just like my grandmother makes. I like my cornbread to have more of a corn meal texture than a floury texture. 

The recipe is made even easier if you just use a nice self-rising corn meal and follow the recipe as printed, just leaving out the baking powder, soda, and salt. I've also made it with plain milk as opposed to buttermilk and I really can't taste a difference. I keep powdered milk on hand for recipes like this, and it's just as good when I substitute that as well.

I love the fact that it makes just about four servings (although when I make it for just my mom and me, there's never any left over). Thanks for posting this!

Good old fashioned cornbread! I added 1/4 cup sugar cuz I like cornbread a little sweet. I used a regular 8x8 pan sprayed with nonstick spray. Baked it at 375º till done. I like the small amount of flour in this recipe, the cornbread comes out course and not fluffy like a cake. I'll make this again!

I don't have a skillet, so I just used a glass baking 8x8 dish and I love how the batter sizzled as I poured it in and clean-up was a breeze!  I too, like a sweet cornbread (sorry - I was raised on jiffy mix cornbread) so adding the 1/4 cup of sugar was perfect for what I am used to.  Served this with black-eyed peas and BBQ chicken and there wasn't a crumb left in the dish.  Enjoy ya'll!

NOW THIS IS CORNBREAD!!! This is just like the cornbread that my grandmother and mother used to make "using the seasoned black skillet". I did not use the baking soda and I used melted butter instead. Make it all the time. YEAH...NO SUGAR!!!

This is the recipes Ive been looking for, and it was great. I followed the recipe as is except I replaced the vegetable oil for butter and I didn't put the baking soda in the mix only the baking powder, and I let the mix set for about 10 to 15 minutes before pour into a hot bacon greased iron skillet.I also like this recipe because it tasted more like the cornbread mom use to make and it's ideal for just two people. Thank a lot well. Will be make this again my husband love it too.

Very good corn bread. I added 1/4 C. of honey to sweeten.  Served it with honey butter and it was very tasty.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Good basic recipe, very flexible, and the buttermilk give it good flavor. If you like it sweet, add sugar; want it moist(er), another tablespoon melted butter. It was a bit salty as-is. Next time I'll use just a scant 1/2 teaspoon.

very good!  i loved it--great taste, great texture, good height.   my finace thought it was too salty--i.e.  it wasn't his mom's who makes tasteless, flat cornbread.  i will make this again instead of the mom's recipe.

I used Polenta cornmeal & baked it in a muffin tin (6 large) at 375 degs. for about 18 mins.  DH & I loved it!  It isn't sweet at all, though, so if you like it sweet you'll have to add sugar.  (As a beginner, I also loved this recipe b/c it was so quick and easy.)

Good recipe - quick and yummy.  I substituted 1 cup of homemade kefir that had over-soured for the buttermilk.  Serving with chili - classic!  Even passes the "particular husband" test!    Next time I will use a less coarse grind of cornmeal.

Personally, I like the cornbread that is a little sweeter, but I made this because grandpa is diabetic. It was SO easy and quick! I had lots of fun making it. And since I like it a little sweeter I just spread on a little butter and honey. Super good recipe! Thanks!

Great Recipe... I am gluten free and only one person so I needed a recipe for one, two works. I made this exactly as posted, with one exception. In place of the All-Purpose Flour I used Sweet White Rice Flour... no other changes.
If you want to Microwave this I did it at 4 mins. and 13 sec.
Thanks for the recipe

Great, easy and the end result is perfect.I've been making this for about 5 or 6 years. I always use Old Fashioned Stone ground corn meal because it has some fine and some course texture.  I use bacon drippings 2 tablespoons. I heat the drippings in the skillet and then added 1/2 of the hot drippings (or 1 tb.) to batter before I baked. This is like my Mother and Grandmother made in cast iron skillets. You can't beat that crunchy crust from the cast iron skillet.

We modified a little to suit our tastes by doubling the flour and adding a little honey.  Also, preheated the pan bare, then melted in 2T butter just before adding the batter so it wouldn't burn.  Since the smallest cast iron skillet I have is 10", it was done in 10 minutes.  Next time, I might try cutting out the baking soda, since it just felt like there was a little too much leavening in it.  Otherwise, we really enjoyed it.

5 stars for me.  This recipe is perfect just as it is.  I lost my Great Grandmother's Recipe and was looking for something that seemed similar.  This is it.  Just as good. Just as simple.  Just like it is supposed to be.  I guess I should just memorize it as it is a simple recipe but I like digging through the recipe box each time so I can scan through all of the other old favorites.

I added a tablespoon of honey to the recipe and followed everything exact. It was super easy to make and I just baked it in an 8x8 pan lined with parchment paper. When it was hot out of the oven, my first bite tasted like flour but once it cooled (perhaps it cooked for a few more minutes) it was tasty. I'd probably add a touch more honey/sugar next time but I really like how I didn't need any oil for the recipe. The parchment did the trick! Will definitely be making this again!

I made this exactly how the recipe dictates and it came out beautifully.  Crisp, browned bottom, soft middle, super crispy edges, held together and did NOT crumble like most cornbread, and was perfectly textured:  not cakey or floury or dry.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe.  I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar for the sake of the kids.  The oil on the bottom makes a delicious flavor and consistancy.

FLAWLESS!!!!  I do not have an iron pan so I used what I had. I generously greased wax paper and had to bake it longer, however; it did try several varieties!1. Added Bacon, 2. Italian spices with Parmesan cheese, 3. Jalapenos with Mexican spices and salsa & 4. Sugar & cinnamon. The plain version was higher but the others were very good also! Bake on!

Very good southern style cornbread!  My husband ate it with honey, and I thought it was great plain.  The suggested serving size is huge though!  I would say this makes 4-6 generous servings as a side.  Although if portion control is not important for your diet, I can see why you might want to eat half the pan - it is good!

FABULOUS!  I will use this for ALL my cornbread needs!  This time - I used 1/3 cup sugar instead of the salt. I also doubled the recipe and used a glass 9x15 pan.  I also used white cornmeal. But - the possibilities are endless - next time maybe some crumbled bacon - the next - maybe tiny snippets of dried apple?  This was SOOOO quick and easy!!  Tonight - the butter, honey, and huckleberry jam will be on the table!!!!!

This recipe is wonderful!!!  It's light and fluffy with great texture and tastes like cornbread not sugary corn cake.  The crunchy crust is great.  It doesn't fall apart and rises up nice and high.  I used a cast iron skillet.

I followed this recipe as directed and it tasted bitter and dry.  I can't figure out what went wrong, but it was hardly edible.  The only thing I can think of, is that I purshased fat-free buttermilk (it was the only buttermilk at our market).  Maybe that was the issue, but i would not try this again.

Oh my goodness, amazing!

I didn't have buttermilk, so I substitued 1/2 with milk + vinegar and 1/2 with plain yogurt. Doubled the recipe and made it in my new skillet. Delicious.

This recipe is a good foundation for traditional cornbread; textural, good corn flavor, not very sweet.  But the resulting flavor is a bit flat.  Having followed the directions in the first batch, I've kept the recipe and modified it to improve the flavor.   First, substituting corn flour for wheat flour increases the corn flavor without hurting the texture.  Second, using real salted butter in the skillet instead of vegetable oil gives the cornbread a delicious finish.  Third, try adding a single tablespoon of sugar to the dry ingredients (1 Tbs sugar to 1 cup corn meal ratio).  This doesn't make it noticeably sweeter, but it does balance the saltiness from using baking powder, soda, and salt.   (Baking powder and soda are necessary for adding fluffiness to this buttermilk-based recipe.)  Lastly, I use 1 Tablespoon vinegar and enough whole milk to bring it to 1 cup, then microwave for 30 seconds to warm and thicken.  It's an excellent substitute for real buttermilk, which is sometimes hard to find in stores.

This is THE best cornbread!  I love it.  Good southern cornbread.  The only thing that I did differently is use butter in place of the oil and also used a small amount of melted butter in the batter.  Delicious!

I like this recipe, but took the advice of a couple previous reviews: I added a tablespoon of melted butter to the batter,and instead of sugar I added a tablespoon of honey. I substituted the regular flour with Masa Harina(Corn flour)which really made for a nice batter! I happened to have a bag nearby as that's what I use to thicken my chili with.
This is a keeper!

I'm not quite understanding the great reviews of this recipe.  It was dense and flavorless. To be fair I will try it again.

Made this for my Dad and he said it was really good.  I don't like cornbread so I'll take his word for it.  I liked how easy the recipe was to put together.

Very good classic recipe.  I needed to make a classic cornbread without the sugar as a base for cornbread dressing and this fit the bill perfectly.

Good cornbread but nothing special.  I added 1/4 c. of sugar and baked it in an 8X8 greased pan at 375 degrees for about 18 minutes.

I really enjoyed this for my afternoon tea.    I used margarine instead of vegetable oil.  That makes an excellent tasting crust.  Served with syrup and lavender tea.  Bon apetit!

Wonderful. The corn bread has a wonderful texture and does not crumble and fall apart as most do.  I added approx. 2 tbls raw sugar to sweeten and followed another's advice to use an 8x8 pan (I did put oil in the bottom as the original recipe recommended) and cook at 375 till done.  Very pleased. Husband loved it.
