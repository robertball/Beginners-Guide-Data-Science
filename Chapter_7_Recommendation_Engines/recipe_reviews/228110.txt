Exactly what I was looking for.  I couldn't find my old recipe so I was looking for something similar and this was perfect.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup because I prefer my cornbread less sweet and found they needed a bit more time in the oven.  I guess my oven is a bit cooler than the original poster's oven.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and they turned out great.  Thanks!

YUM! I was out of eggs so I substituted 1 tbsp of milled golden flax-seed +3 tbsps water for the egg, all I had was canned milk so I did 1/2 cup canned milk and 1/2 cup of water + 1 tbsp of white vinegar for the buttermilk and they still turned out great! Will save this one to my recipe box and I may even reduce the sugar and try for sweet cornbread with it. It was sweet, moist and non-crumbly. Held together great! Thanks for sharing!

Here's my healthier version:  I used oat flour instead of all purpose flour, to make them gluten free.  I used 1/4 cup of Stevia in the Raw instead of sugar and added a mushy banana to the wet ingredients.  I used 1/4 cup of coconut oil in place of butter.  I will use only 1/2 tsp. salt next time.  Tasted so yummy!

These came out very well. I used 1 tablespoon of white vinegar in a cup of milk and let it sit for 10 minutes in place of buttermilk, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. These came out much better than I was expecting and are probably the best corn muffins i've ever had, rivaling even my grandmother's. Very happy with the result. :) The only thing I might try next time is a few minutes before I take them out of the oven, i'll brush the tops of them with a little bit of butter so they get a little more golden. They cooked perfectly and the sides and bottom are perfectly brown, it's just that the tops are still pale though that may just be because of my style of oven. 5 star recipe though, my thanks to the uploader for what will likely be something I make often.

Just put these in the oven with one cup corn kernels added to the batter. Since everyone rated this recipe 5 stars, I know they'll be great...wow...delicious! Someone should tell Aunt Jemima to put this recipe on their yellow corn meal product since the one they promote crumbles and is dry.

LOVE THIS!!!!! I never cared much for cornbread & I stink at cooking, but this recipe is quick and easy to make and soo good. We keep this in our house daily now :-D  I make it in 8x8 dish, takes a little longer to cook (20-25 min).

These are very excellent. I've learned through error that subbing flax for oil in corn muffins tends to make them crazy dry, so I skipped that substitution. However, I might try a yogurt sub for some of the butter next time. Mini muffins baked for 9-10 minutes.

9-27-2018 ~Not a bad muffin, but I have a couple of suggestions where the recipe could be improved.  I did reduce the sugar by half, but that’s a personal thing – there seems to be two camps, one who prefers their cornbread sweet, the other not so much.  I’m of the latter, and so I was pleased with the lesser amount of sugar.  I also loved the use of both butter and buttermilk, both of which add great flavor.  One of my criticisms is that I would have liked to have seen more “lift,” more rise, in the muffins.  I should have known when I didn’t see it called for, that because of the buttermilk, this needed baking soda.  I think replacing 1/2 tsp. of the baking powder with 1/2 tsp. of baking soda would have done the trick.  As for taste, these were just a tad on the salty side for me. These would have benefited with 1/2 tsp. less salt.  Great suggestions, but in the end, a different recipe.

Very nice and moist.  I needed a small portion of corn bread for dinner and I wanted quick clean up, hence baking in a small pan rather than muffins.  The buttermilk gave this the moist texture I was hoping for.  Nice quick recipe that I would use again.

Excellent recipe. I realized halfway through that I didn't have any butter, so I used Olive Oil. Tasted AMAZING! I can't wait to try with butter.

This was sooo simple and sooo good!  Didnt change a thing, except I did not have buttermilk so I used 3 tsp lemon juice and added regular milk to make it a cup.  Let it sit for about 15 minutes and then use.  Yummy!  Thanks for submitting!

If you like a sweeter cornbread this one is for you. It is also very moist and tastes great all by itself.

I read all the reviews before I made these muffins.  I wanted them to be dairy free so I substituted coconut/almond milk for the buttermilk.  I used melted margarine instead of butter.  I cut the sugar in half and then added 2 tablespoons of stevia sugar in  the raw.  Finally, I added a small can of corn.

Good recipe. I would have to remember next time to not fill up the muffin cups close to the top. Must fill up half way to make a dozen.  Otherwise, it'll make 9 muffins instead. Delicious tasting and moist. Will make this again.

This is a simple recipe, with a great taste.  I used whole milk and I added 3/4 of sugar ( I like my corn bread sweet) I cooked them for 18 mins.  The texture of the muffin is great it's not dry at all.  Try it!

This is exactly how I like my cornbread. Sweet and not too crumbly. The recipe is perfect as is, but sometimes I omit the salt, add a can of Mexicorn or half a 14 oz can of plain corn and half a chopped up bell pepper to add more flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and very easy. Only thing I did differently was stir 1 cup of corn in the batter as suggested by another reviewer. Will definitely be making these again.

I had to substitute buttermilk with the milk and vinegar trick. Very good warm and fresh. I added cooked bacon to a few and broccoli to a few. Definitely going to try with the buttermilk next time, but was good, quick and easy to make

I never have buttermilk, so I mix milk with vinegar. It doesn't raise as well, so be sure to whisk the batter well to fluff it up. I don't like overly sweet breads, but for me this one needs all the sugar. Yummy in the cast iron!

These were perfect corn muffins that stick together (not too crumbly) and my kids loved them too! I also did the 1tbsp vinegar in milk and let sit for 10 minutes instead of buttermilk. Otherwise I followed it exactly. I made in mini muffin tins and they took about 7 minutes to cook.

Excellent!! I didn’t have buttermilk or milk, so I used a cup of half and half with a tablespoon of lemon juice. I also stirred in two finally chopped jalapeños and about 3/4 of a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. This is the best corn muffin recipe I have ever made!

Straight forward recipe. I used a well lubricated (one stick of butter) cast iron pan which I put the batter into. Takes a little longer to cook but worth it.

I was looking for Corn Muffins not Corn Bread. This was PERFECT. We like our muffins a bit on the sweet side. Next time I'll try the 1/4 cup sugar version.

Very good recipe. I added raspberries to mine. The only problem is the bake time: When I read 12-15 minutes at 400, I thought that can't be right. I baked mine at 25 minutes. I worked in a bakery years ago and knew that they'd likely be doughy at 15 minutes. Other than that, perfect: not too sweet. Not too savory. If you do frozen raspberries as I did, make sure you thaw them and drain them before adding to the batter. I added 2/3 cup. :)

Made as was but replaced the sugar with xyla as a family member is diabetc but reduced the amount to 4tbsp after reading reviews.  Family thought they could use a little more sugar so will try these again with the amount of sugar stated in recipe.  I found them a little dry but that's probably something to do with me as I'd never made them before.   Willing to have another go before trying different recipe

I didn't immediately get them into the muffin pan (just a few minutes) and had to add milk to thin batter--it got way too thick to use.  Otherwise, a nice and easy recipe.  I did use 1/3 cup sugar instead of the half the recipe called for after reading other's reviews.

Tasted ok but batter was very thick (should've added more liquid) and the muffins were very heavy and somewhat crumbly (probably because of the thick batter).  Overall, this is a good cornmeal muffin recipe but I wouldn't say it stands out.  Thanks for sharing!

I made it in an 8" x 8" pan and increased the cooking time by 5 minutes.  This was the best corn bread we have ever tasted.  It was moist and sweet.  No need for honey on top.  Big hit with the children.  This is my new favorite.

Meh. The taste was not great.  I was hoping for a sweet muffin but they were actually kind of bitter!? Nice and moist, which is hard to do in a corn muffin, but I probably won't make these again.

I have made these as written and have also made them with half whole wheat flour or less sugar with great results every time. It is a versatile recipe, sweet and smooth as written, heartier if adjusted.

Made these exactly like the recipe is written.  Baked in 12 greased muffins cups (did not preheat pan).  Hubby said they were the perfect corn muffin to go with his chili.  Will  definitely be making them again.

I used this recipe to make what I simply call, "Corn Bread Cookies".  With a 1/2 cup of sugar these are sweet, so I changed it up a bit with chopped onions and bell peppers and shredded cheese. Then I spooned individual mounds on a baking sheet.  You want the batter to be moist but slighty firm.  Sticky.  Bake about 12 minutes, and it makes 24 cookies.  Because they individually bake like muffins, they tend to stay moist longer too.  Makes a good addition for dinner, or just a quick snack.

Easy to make, and quick. . I used 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet, good for breakfast muffins. Easily could use less sugar to make it more a savory corn muffin for dinner.

I used a little less sugar (as 1/2c just seemed like a lot) I didn't have buttermilk so used 1/2 2% and 1/2 light cream) and a wee bit less than a full cup - I also added pineapple chunks - turned out great!!  the recipe seemed a little watery than previous corn meal muffins maybe due to the milk vs buttermilk...but don't let that scare ya...they were awesome!!

This was excellent.  I made this for my toddler but with whole milk and threw in chopped up hot dogs for fun.  This rose perfectly and was a great texture - firm but not dry, sweet but not too sweet.  We thoroughly enjoyed.  Will make again. Thanks for submitting.

Wonderful basic recipe! Great just the way they are, or you can add sweet or savoury items. I've tried cranberries, pineapple (drain it well!)  walnuts, jalapeños,  and even pesto.  Just reduce the sugar to a third cup for the savoury muffins, and increase the flour by 2 tablespoons .

Love how fast these were from start to finish.  I love that you can whip them up from scratch as fast as a mix.  I reduced the sugar a tad and used some bacon fat in place of the butter for added flavor.  Yum!

Perfect and delicious The only change I made was to use self-rising flour and I was able to omit baking powder and salt because of that and I did use unsalted butter too. These were delicious!

Delicious and moist!  Used an 8 x 8" pan, which was greased with shortening, and baked it for 20 minutes.  I used the milk and vinegar combo, 1/3 cup of sugar, added a 1/4 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 2 good dashes of cayenne. Definitely a keeper!

First time trying corn muffins - moist and freeze well.  150 calories each with modifications:  Splenda, less salt, half wheat flour, 1/2 cup frozen corn kernels and 1 diced jalapeno.  Cook time took longer though at 18-20 minutes.

These were the best corn muffins I have ever made!  I cut the sugar in half just for personal preference, but everything else was exact.  I used 6 extra large muffin cups.  Moist and yummy!  Thank you so much for the recipe!!

This was my first time making corn muffins from scratch.This recipe made it very easy. They came out great! They were moist and very flavorful. My husband never liked corn muffins because he said they were dry until he tasted my corn muffins. Now he loves them.

Disappointed. I didn't like the taste.  I either didn't like the buttermilk taste as much as I thought I would or I added too much salt.  When I measured the salt I didn't level it off.  Still next time I would only add 1/2 tsp salt.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup instead of half cup which worked out well.  Also I used Bobs Red Mill medium grind cornmeal.  Next time see if finely ground corn meal is available, as the muffins tasted gritty.  Muffins were overly crumbly.

I have tried several corn bread recipes, but this one's the best.  When my mom made corn bread for us growing up, it was always dry.  I knew that couldn't be right!  This recipe proves that wrong.  Make sure you eat them in the first 24 hrs though, or they do dry out.

I use vanilla soy milk due to a dairy allergy, and everyone raves about how delicious this corn bread is! Perfect for muffins and using in corn bread dressing.

I would have liked them to be fluffier, and the taste was plain.  It needs something added, maybe cheddar cheese or green chile or pieces of sweet corn.

Just made these and they turned out SO great! I used whole wheat pastry flour in place of the all-purpose and only used 1/4 cup sugar since we eat ours with honey on them typically. Will make this again and again!

Just brought them out of the oven and they are fantastic! Not dry at all and with a superb taste. I recommend these to anyone who wants a nice cornbread muffin that is a little on the sweeter side, which I prefer. I am sure you can adjust the sugar to make it more versatile though. Perfection!
