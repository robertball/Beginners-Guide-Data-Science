my boyfriend ate the whole batch!  I added some shredded cheese and garlic, but kept the rest the same, great!

Loved this recipe - it was super easy. I gave it 4 stars because it took longer than 15 minutes and the rice stuck big time to the bottom of the pan. I did add Italian seasoning to the soup mix because I did not see herbed cream of chicken. It was great and I'll definitly make this again!

Excellent and easy!  I have made this several times now.  It is my new go-to when I am in the mood for something "normal" and easy!

This is a great recipe and very easy to prepare on the fly. I marinated the chicken (with 30 minute herb and garlic marinade sauce) pieces before cooking them. Adds a little more flavorful. From there its just salt and pepper to taste!
