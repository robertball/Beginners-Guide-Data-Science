A gentile with a professional cooking degree in culinary including pastry, I just made these "cookies".   The result is so awful and runny there is no possible way to roll the "dough" up---it is batter. Oy vey.  I suggest adding lots more potato flour and matzoh meal and sugar---then you have a dough.  Problem is though, once you roll the results up and bake them you end up with a brittle exceeding fragile product.  I managed to cut some into bars and sugar them as directed.   Probably could have used another egg to bind since I had to add so many dry ingredients to yield anything workable.

Please don't waste your time with this one-it comes out watery and you can't roll it.  By adding matzo flour or potato starch you give it a dry floury taste.  A waste of time and good ingredients.

I also found the batter to be way too thin, but when I thickened it with about a cup of cake meal, it worked fine and actually tasted delicious.  I preferred the cookies that came out thinner - more like brownies.

Something is wrong with this recipe. Following the proportions given I ended up with a bowl of something the consistancy of cake batter.

I followed the directions exactly and it was too loose.  I had to add at least an extra cup of matzoh meal and an extra cup of potato starch.  The final outcome is good.

I am the recipe-giver, and need to clarify. This must be baked in very small loaf tins, that was excluded from original recipe. I have two metal ice cube trays, with no inserts, they wew around with the old frigidares.  Size about 4 inches by 10 inches.  Or try small foil loaf pans with parchment inside.  This recipe is NOT for free standing cookies.  Try again... I just made them and it works.  SR

These cookies are delicious! We omitted the nuts and instead of all white sugar we did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  We made two batches and only have a few left. We are going to make another batch today.
