Was looking for a cake that I could make for my father-in-law's 75th birthday and test tried this. I wasn't sure about just using 3 eggs to the cake mix since some reviews said it was a little dry. I added 1/2 cup of natural applesauce to the batter. Followed the frosting recipe except I used regular cherry pie filling instead of light. Topped the cake off with 1/2 can of the cherries. It turned out pretty moist and delicious. Definately a runner up on my cake list to make. Thanks!

This was OUTSTANDING!  I made it in a heart pan for a Valentines Day banquet... I used a whole can of reg (not lite) cherry pie filling drizzled over the top and down the sides and in the center of the heart and it was as beautiful as it was delicious!  So easy too... I highly recommend this one!

This is a great recipe.  I omitted the cherries on top, and I also added 1/3 c of butter to the batter.  I baked in a 9x13" pan.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this cake in heart shaped pans for our Valentine's Day potluck at work. Everyone LOVED it! I was concerned about the texture when I took it out of the oven. It was very heavy, and i was worried that it wasn't done, but it was perfect when I cut it at the potluck! I'm going to try it with chocolate cake mix next time.

I made this as a 2 layer cake- couldn't figure out exactly how to do it in a 9x13. Interesting cake, almost a cheesecake flavor.  The men really loved it.  I liked it but it wouldn't be favorite.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving.  I got more raves than I knew what to do with.  It is a very attractive cake-a pretty pink in the middle.  It is undoubtedly the best cake I've ever eaten.

This is a great recipe! No fail and extreme fast and easy! I've made it twice now. First time I made it I only used the one can of cherry pie filling using it in the cake mix. I also decreased the vanilla extract by 1 teaspoon and the powdered sugar to only about 1 1/2 cups, I don't like really sweet frosting... The second time I made the cake I decided to try something a little different, I used apple pie filling instead only in the cake mix and also made the frosting with less sugar like I mentioned above. Sprinkled the cake with a little nutmeg on the top, it was really scrumptious! Next time I make it I might try either blueberry or peach pie filling!!! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

I made this for our 4th of July get together and everyone LOVED it. I did not use LITE pie filling, just regular. I also made it into a single sheet cake instead of a double layer. Will make again and again.

This cake was really good although I think the frosting would be better if it was more pudding like.  I also think it could use about 1/2 tsp of almond extract to bring out more of the cherry flavor.  The only change I made was to add a 1/4 cup of oil to the batter.  It was a very moist cake and tasty.

This is a really great semi home made cake idea.  I have made it several times and received rave reviews from everyone who has eaten it.  I did end up adding oil into the cake mix so that it would come out a little more moist.  I also don't top it with more cherry filling, the filling inside is enough cherryliciousness!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was a great moist cake. I made it exactly as stated in a heart shaped pan.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to used regular cherry filling on the top, instead of light, because I thought it had more of a diet taste and I am eating cake so I want the goodies.

I first made this for my son's 30th birthday and made major brownie points with it.  Then I started taking it to work and had to give the recipe out to a good number of coworkers including some of the doctors who went home and told their wives about it.  Thanks for a great addition to my recipe collection!!

I made this for my sons 15th birthday.  I did not care for this cake at all, and everyone stuck their noses up at it.  It tasted artificial and just heavy.  The frosting was the best part of the cake, but that is how I always make my frosting, so that was nothing new or different for us.  Will NOT make this again.

I made this cake in the 9 x 13 inch pan because I did not want to deal with the mess that I envisioned with the cherry topping. Made the cake according to directions with the exception of adding an extra egg. Turned out wonderful and very moist. Have already had a request from my mom for the recipe. Very good, quick and easy!

I made this cake for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  He absolutely loved it despite the fact that he is not a huge cake person.   The cherries add a nice subtle flavor, and the frosting was absolutely divine! I ended up not making it a 9 X 13 rather than the suggested double.  That being said, I did end up with an overabundance of frosting.  It may be wise to cut the frosting recipe down if you plan on making a single cake unless you are a frosting lover.

I used regular cherry pie filling for the lite. It was okay, but ont really impressive. texture was not fabulous. I likely wont make this again but It wasn't terrible. I think kids would like it.

Great concept.  However, mine turned out with an unpleasant rubbery texture--not the light, fluffy, moist cake I expect.  I was skeptical when no oil or water was added, and I think there was a reason.  I did substitute an equal amout of canned raspberry pie filling for the cherry pie filling.  The flavor was fine, but the texture really turned me off.  I won't make this again.

This cake is awesome!  I have made it several times, including at Christmas when I tinted the icing green.  It was great for the holidays with green frosting and then the red cherries.  The cake is soooo moist and good and the frosting is wonderful.  Everyone loves this and it always turns out well.  Beware, it is addicting-but it's worth it.  Enjoy!
