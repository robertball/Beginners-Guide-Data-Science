I made a few additions as the mixture needed more flavour - used more garlic, added a handful of fresh shredded basil, chili flakes and 1/2 cup white wine to the tofu mixture while it was simmering. I mixed the rice, tofu mix and marinara sauce together and then put it into the peppers, and topped with cheese.  There was lots of filling, probably twice as much as I needed - maybe my peppers were too small.  Made a great vegetable side dish that I served with baked salmon fillets.

This is absolutely delicious.  What an awesome recipe.  So flavorful that even my meat eating husband loved it.  The only change I made was that I replaced the marinara sauce and fresh tomatoes with a can of Del Monte Diced Tomates and Garlic which I had on hand.  I'm glad I did because it seemed to bring out the flavor of the veggies and tofu even more.  Try this recipe and I'm sure you'll make it over and over again.

I thought this was a good one, only changed a few things to cut down on time: Used packaged long grain rice (saved 20 minutes!)and only made half of the recipe. Cooked the tofu with chopped onions instead (no garlic on hand- 1st time ever, I swear!)It looked beautiful and with a simple salad it was a very filling meal. I'd like to try this with couscous next time. Oh, of course, the meat preferring hubby liked it too>   But then, he's just cool like that.

These peppers came out amazingly good.  The reason I gave this recipe a 4 is because if I had not added a ton of spices it wouldn't have tasted like much at all.  I added many extra spices such as curry powder and garlic powder.  I just kept adding until it tasted really good.

I know other people said their peppers came out squishy, but mine were perfect and I followed the cooking time to the minute.

This was pretty good and simple to make.  I did make a few changes, however:  I had to make it a casserole because a couple of my peppers had gotten soft at the bottom, so I chopped the peppers in 1" cubes and sauteed it until they were a little less crisp, I mixed all the ingredients together in a baking dish, I added onion powder and parmesan cheese and a whole jar of spaghetti sauce and mixed most of the cheese throughout casserole, I topped it with the rest of the mozzarella cheese and baked it in 350F oven for 25 minutes.  Very filling and made about 6 nice sized servings.

Bland and squishy.  Fulfills everyones stereotypes about vege food.  Too many corrections needed, but spice up the sauce, mix rice & tofu just before stuffing, and try some parmesan on top.

Wonderful way to incorporate Tofu (something new for me)into your diet.Excellent way to alter the usual ground beef and white rice variety.  I felt so healthy eating this version. Will definitely make again. Next time will mix the marinara in with the rice and have some extra marinara on hand.

Great recipe.  I skipped the salt and used a salt-free seasoning instead; I also added a little red onion.  I followed the water measurements in this recipe rather than my brown rice container and ended up with dry rice.  I should've known better.  This was very easy to make and I will definitely make again!  My boyfriend absolutely loved it!!

This was a good base to work off of for a stuffed pepper tofu recipe. Instead of layering the ingredients I mixed them all together in the rice before stuffing in the peppers. Also in addition to the mozzarella cheese I added parmesan, and ricotta to make it taste a little bit more like grandma's stuffed peppers. Before I placed them into the baking dish I coated the bottom of the dish with a layer of sauce. This helps cooke the peppers and keeps everything moist. Great recipe!

Added extra fresh herbs (basil and parsley) and served with extra marinara for dipping if desired. My friend is a vegetarian and she was in love!

This was so good! I had a bunch of leftover tofu/rice mix (I mixed instead of layering) and spooned it around the peppers, so it turned into more of a casserole. Delicious.

I liked this recipe a lot, however, I did substitute the mozzarella for Parmesan, to make it a bit more flavorful with less fat. I also drizzled the top with olive oil after cooking and added a lot of fresh ground pepper. I think using a good quality tasty marinara sauce also can make a big difference.

I cooked this over the weekend with my brother and it turned out ok. I really like the consistency and taste as to how the tofu came out. However, I found the finished recipe a little bland. I just felt like there was something missing, zest, flavor, I don't know what. Maybe I should have just skipped the rice and stuffed the peppers with just the tofu. I'll definitely make the tofu again, but I'm not so sure about the bell pepers. Everyone liked them, but it wasn't their favorite. A little bland.

I made this as a main dish for a few friends and they loved it. I made a few changes including using tempeh instead of tofu and adding fresh mushrooms. served with sauteed dinosaur kale and carmelized onion lentils. Delicious!

This was a nice, good dinner.  Nothing too great, but very edible and a nice change to routine.  I did add in chopped onion with the garlic and mix the ingredient together (includinging some of the cheese) before stuffing the peppers.  The tomato slice on top was a nice touch and I will add more next time.  The timing for cooking was great, the peppers still had a crispness to them.  I will make again.

My husband was NEVER a huge fan of tofu until this recipe. Simple and delicious. I stir all the ingredients together at the end rather than layer to keep everything simple. My husband now asks for this more than most other of the recipes I make! HUGE SUCCESS!

This was good! Made a bunch of changes - cut the tops off the peppers and chopped the tops (minus stem =)sauteed with garlic and onion.  One can diced tomatoes one can sauce. Added fresh basil, dried oregano, bay leaf, pinch red pepper flakes, salt & pepper to sauce - mixed in rice and cheese.  Blanched the peppers and drained before stuffing.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I did add a few things, to appease our tastes. I added an additional clove of garlic, some diced yellow onion, and a little chopped mushroom. Also, I used fresh mozzarella cheese instead of the shredded, just because I thought it would be better (and it was!). Will be making this again!

This is excellent! I cut the tofu into pea-sized pieces. Also used some minced onion along with the garlic. I used 1 jar of good-quality prepared sauce. Then I added 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley and some dried Italian Seasoning to give it some extra color and flavor. I skipped the tomato slices and topped it with mozzarella. Once plated, I sprinkled more chopped parsley for a dash of color. And don't use white rice.....the brown rice really gives it a nicer texture and nutty flavor. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was excellent! I cooked the rice in the rice cooker while the tofu was in the pan. As others suggested, I added basil, more garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper to the tofu.  I mixed the rice with the tofu and about 3/4 c. of the marinara sauce, skipping the cheese in the mixture itself.  I stuffed the peppers, put them in the pan, and sprinkled cheese on top.  They were delicious with extra marinara on them, and they made for excellent leftovers, too! I'll definitely make this again.

The taste was good, only because I added a lot of other spices, like other reviewers.  The insides were mush.  Probably won't make these again.

Excellent recipe, but I suggest adding some spices to the sauce, particlarly when sauteeing the tofu. I used coriander, pepper & garlic salt, but pick your favorite.

DELICIOUS! Add fresh basil, lots of onion & garlic to the tofu. Only needed half the rice, mixed it all together with sauce, piled it in pepper halves, topped with a shot of olive oil, sliced tomato & a thick slice of mozzerella cheese. Add sauce in the bottom of the baking dish for extra dipping sauce.

This was pretty good. I did add a few extra spices that I like to jazz it up a little. I think next time I make it I will use a veggie burger substitute instead of the tofu unless I can find a way to cook my tofu to make it less squishy.

Great recepie to add tofu too. I used quinoa instead of rice, and added some more spices to dress up the taste. Will make again. Was pretty wasy as well.

This recipe is really good. I wanted to mix it up a bit, so instead of tofu, I used black beans from a can (drained and rinsed). I also sauted green onions and red onions with the garlic. I didn't use any marinara sauce. Instead I served with sour cream. Very tasty!

I added about 3/4 cup of marinara and a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  And also added chopped green pepper, parmesan and textured veggie protein (Morningstar)to the rice mixture.  And no need to divide the layers... just mix it all up, stuff the peppers and sprinkle with cheese!  Very good... and for meat eaters, it's hard to tell it's vegetarian with the addition of soy protein!

These were pretty easy to make but made an out-of-the-ordinary meal.  Next time, I will add Parmesan cheese.

Very good version of stuffed peppers... i might suggest Yyves veggie ground round chicken instead of straight up tofu? I am tellin you the origional veggie ground round (soy beef) and the chicken version are AMAZING.  I've cooked for meat loving farm boys and hunters who can't get over how great these simulated products are... (tacos, spagetti sauce, stuffed peppers, cabbage rolls, etc).. and they get even more protein and half the fat!  Gives them tonnes of energy for working on the farm!

I've made this recipe several times and it's been great each try. I wanted to freeze it for future meals that my husband could just pop into the oven so I doubled the recipe, chopped the peppers and added them to the rice mixture. All hubby had to do was reheat it. It turned out just as good.

This was good but I personally needed more herbs to kick it up a little. added fresh basil and oregano. also I mixed it all together and then stuffed. (minor change).  for a healthy stuffed pepper, it's good. will make again.

This was great, I also substituted with diced tomatoes because it was all I had.  In addition, I mixed the rice and tofu together before stuffing the peppers.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

Loved the recipe but I did change some things. First i found it best to gut the peppers and then boil them for 5 minutes. Dry them upside down on a paper towel with salt added to the inside.  After cooking the rice and tofu per the directions, I mixed the rice (blend of wild, red, brown and white) and tofu mixture (using ground tofu) and added organic worcestershire sauce.  For my vegan husband i stuffed 2 green peppers. And for the rest of us vegetarians i added the cheese to the mixture before stuffing.  Rave reviews from the family including the “veggie hating” teens and the carnivore friends. Noone missed meat as the tofu is an amazing sub.  I printed the recipe and have it on my regular meal schedule.

This is a great recipe, but like all recipes it's a starting point for me. The only changes that I made were the addition of a few ounces of shiitake mushrooms after the tofu was browned, deglazing the pan with a small amount of red wine and mixing all the stuffing ingredients together instead of layering them. A five star recipe for sure!

I normally don't like tofu but gave this a try, and it was fantastic.

Aldi has a really good chipotle pumpkin pasta sauce that we used in place of marinara and it gave it a nice kick.

I added Cayenne pepper to mine and it's really good.  The sauce I used dried up too much so I need to find a more moist sauce, but it was really good.

This recipe was amazing. It was so easy to make. I was a little uneasy as it was my first time cooking tofu but I had nothing to worry about and it came out perfect. The only thing I changed was the cheese. I used goat cheese instead of mozzarella, as I have a lactose issue and even with the low lactose in mozz, I prefer to go with the lactose free goat cheese. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

This recipe was great! I added chopped mushrooms to tofu while cooking, just to add another flavor. Also, I mixed the rice and tofu base right before loading the peppers because I thought the rice might taste a little bland on the bottom alone. Definitely would make again.

Wife and I are trying a new vegetarian diet for a little while for health reasons.  We are meat and potatoes people, so it's a challenge.  However, this recipe exceeded all my expectations.  When this diet is over, this will still be a 'go-to' dinner in our household.  Maybe....just maybe....tofu isn't so bad.

I enjoyed this recipe with modifications.  I used a marinara that had spinach (Classico), Rotel tomatoes with chili (I like spicy) and besides the mozzarella cheese, I used parmesan cheese.

great food.
I added what people suggested and mix most of the filling together.

I added cremini mushroom to the rice, I added red onion to garlic and tofu, spiced it with curry powder and seasoned salt, and added fresh basil.
It was really good, will make it again.

very good recipe - i'm always looking for different things to do with tofu and this puts a good twist on an old recipe of stuffed peppers.
