This soup has been a staple in our house for at least 30 years but I make it slightly different than this recipe. I lived in Australia for many years and it is a common soup there. They call it Pumpkin Soup and you can get it at most restaurants and diners. Here;s the recipe I use:  1 large butternut squash peeled and cubed 1 large sweet onion peeled and diced 1 can chicken broth 1 can eveporated milk additional milk to thin it out nutmeg  Put the squash, onion and chicken broth in a soup pot and bring to a boil. Simmer until the squash id well done...about 15 minutes. Add evaporated milk and mash with a potato masher or whiz with a hand held stick blender. If it's too thick add some regular milk until it's the consistency you want. Add a dash of nutmeg. Serve with a crusty bread.   I just made some 2 nights ago and used a new chicken broth that made it even better than before. It was College Inn Culinary Broth Thai Coconut Curry. I have to get more so I always have some in the cupboard.

This was delicious; however I used chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth.  Also I added 1/8 teaspoon each of the nutmeg, cloves & cinnamon & black pepper plus 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  Can't wait 'till lunchtime to have more.

This is a great "fall" soup! I peeled the squash first, used chicken broth, and cut the onion by half. I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream to cut some calories. Delicious with a salad and crusty bread!

Tasted great! My only suggestion is to peel the squash BEFORE microwaving it with the butter - that made it really slippery and several times I almost peeled myself instead of the squash!!

I roasted the squash and sauteed the onions before pureeing.  The soup turned out great - was literally licking the bowl clean. It was quick, easy, and I appreciated that it was healthy and used simple ingredients I had on hand.

We really liked this soup.  I didn't put in 2 onions, however.  I thought that would be a bit much.

fantastic!  I took the advice of others and cut the onion by half and used chicken stock instead of veg. stock.  I used some leftover light cream and supplemented with 2% milk.  Awesome!  Rich, creamy, delicious!

I peeled and cubed the squash while the onions sauteed in the pan, added them when the onions were golden, then threw in the other ingredients. I omitted the cloves, and went pretty light on the cinnamon and nutmeg. This was some pretty decent soup! Thanks!

This was terrible. i halved the onion and it was still very overpowered by the onion. it was way to liquidy and the flavor wasnt great. plus it was a pain to cut the skin off the squash and puree it all. not worth it to me.

I substituted chix broth for the veg. broth.  It was very good even my 11 yr old loved it. Cooking in the microwave was so simple.  Definite keeper.

I make a version of this all the time, but prefer to buy the pre-squashed squash in the freezer aisle to save a good 20mins! :)  It's with the other veggies, but usually in a block format about the size of a book :)

Very good soup. Although I cooked mine on the stove opposed to microwaving. There were a few things I did different only because I did not have the item called for. I added 2 tablespoons of butter, and I used half a cup of condensed milk instead of half and half. Substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth. I also felt I needed to add extra spices for a little more flavor. All around a good soup.

This is a good, quick and easy recipe.  This would be perfect for a midweek dinner, served with salad and bread.  It's suprisingly filling.

This was my first butternut squash, so I gave this recipe the benefit of the doubt, as I'm not sure if I didn't like the soup or the taste of the butternut squash.  I had about a cup of leftover cooked squashed, so I adjusted the recipe for that.  I also used onion powder, for my toddler.  I only used part of the broth, and then adjusted to suit my tastes in order to prevent it from being to watery.  I did the same with the half-n-half I used, after pureeing.  This was just a little too sweet for me, which was more than likely the squash itself.  This wasn't something I'll make again, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good recipe.

Made this two days ago, exactly as written except I left out the cloves (personal preference) and it was fantastic! Was going to save the leftovers in the freezer for lunch next week but it was so good, I am having it again today! Thank you very much for the recipe.

I used Sue. S's recipe but  I substituted chicken broth for organic vegetable broth and used whole milk instead of evaporated milk.  Paired with asiago cheese bread- this was a hit. I will definitely make again.

This tasted more like french onion soup.  It was soooo awful!  I followed the recipe, and then tried to double it again (minus the onions) to "fix" it.  When that didn't work, I tried straining the onions out.  Too much work and not worth the time/money.

This is a very different type soup, to me anyway.  I used one of the reviewers suggestion's and instead of cream, used cream of cocoanut milk and 1 tsp. curry powder.  Found it interesting that this is a common soup in Australia!  Well, isn't this why we use allrecipes.com...... to experience other tastes?

Very good & easy to make. I also used chicken broth since it was all I had on hand, and it tastes fine. Used fat free 1/2 + 1/2 also.

Followed the recipe as written, except my "dash" of spices was actually 1/4 tsp of each, and I used half-and-half to slim down the fat just a bit.  O.M.G.  What a great tasting soup this is!  I loved the combination of spices.  I had planned to freeze individual serving sizes for eating throughout the winter, but I'm not sure any of it's going to actually make it into the freezer!  :-)  Thanks "stackhawkley" for a great recipe.

Used only half of a butternut squash and cut the rest of the items in half as well. This soup was very taste and also easy to make. If you like butternut squash soup this soup is the one for you.

Very yummy. I don't know what the difference is between stock and broth but I used chicken stock. I only used 3 cups of stock instead of 4 and the consistency was perfect. I took advice of others and used only one onion and peeled the butternut first. Added thyme instead of cloves as I don't like them.

Very good. Just a little bit lacking in variety of flavor. I like sweet and spicy butternut squash recipes, I added a little brown sugar to this one. I followed advice of other reviewers and used chicken instead of vegetable broth. Mine was from a can and the taste of the chicken was more distinct than I would have preferred. Maybe vegetable, as advised, or homemade chicken broth would be better.

Very tasty and pretty easy. Removing the skin from the squash was a little messy and not totally easy... but would definitely use this recipe again.

The soup was very good the first day but was to rich to eat it more than that. I did freeze a container of the soup and will see how it freezes in a few weeks. I put the squash and other vegetable items into the oven while I was cooking other items to help get that roasted taste and that was excellent.

Very good fall soup, but I had to add some brown sugar. I like it a little sweeter and more like a tablespoon of each of the spices! Yum!

I made this and I got rave reviews from my family! I had had this soup on a cruise 2 summers ago to the Bahamas and fell in love with it! I don’t normally care for squash but this was so yummy! I substituted chicken stock for the vegetable stock! When I served it I also sprinkled a dash of cinnamon & nutmeg on top of it! It is so delicious and smooth! Try it even if you hate squash because you will never think of this as squash!

I think that peeling the squash after cooking it for 4 minutes must be a typographical error. I peel the squash first. I lighten this by using 2% evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.

I made this soup and it was delicious. I used acorn and butternut squash and it was very favorable.
