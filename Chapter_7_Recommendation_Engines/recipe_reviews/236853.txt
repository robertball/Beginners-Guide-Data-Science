Loved this!  In the summer here in the desert, the last thing I want to do is crank up the oven, but we so desperately needed cornbread to go with our posole last night.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I started with a about 3 tablespoons of greek yogurt and then added the milk to the 1.5 cup mark.  Great cornbread idea without heating up the whole house.  Now where's the biscuit version?! :)

This is a good basic cornbread recipe for your waffle iron. I like my cornbread sweet, so I added about 1-2 tablespoons of honey and a tablespoon of sugar.

This is so good! I added some cheese and topped with honey. Also, I had to add 1.5Tbsp oil to the batter to prevent sticking to the waffle iron.

My batter was very runny and took a very long time to crisp. But over all a crunchy corn bread. Went good with my fried chicken. Just a little butter and honey

So crispy!!!  I add some sweetener (sugar, honey, monk fruit, or just use maple syrup).

I followed this recipe exactly and the batter was really soupy. I didn't realize before but apparently I prefer sweeter cornbread because this just didn't do it for me. With some tweaks (addition of sugar and less buttermilk) it could probably be a great recipe.

I didn't add full amount of buttermilk to this. Would have been really soupy.  Added gradually and it was a cup at the most. But they were very yummy.

The only change that I made was by adding 1 Tbl.  of brown sugar.  I served the waffles as a bread with a hearty vegetable and bean soup. The waffles were perfect to dunk into the soup.

Good, not great. I should have read some reviews first... I agree with everyone who ended up with runny and soupy batter. I cooked the first waffle exact to recipe and it was just off. Added another 1/2 Cup flour and it got better. Another sprinkle of flour made them as good as they were going to get. I'm estimating that 1 cup of milk is plenty! I also agree with the honey additions. With some tweaks this is going to be really good.
