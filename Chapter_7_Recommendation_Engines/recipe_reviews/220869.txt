Reallly great recipe! I added my own little twist, sauteed a couple of chopped cloves of garlic in the oil and took them out to brown the meat, added them back in with the broth and onions.  I also, "kicked it up a notch", by rubbing kosher salt, ground Indian Malabar peppercorns and some Emeril's Essence onto the meat before browning. Threw in some chopped celery with the veggies and it was Yummy!!
Had that good, spicy but not SPICY, taste along with the traditional flavors, really Good!!
Will be using this recipe again and again!  FYI; even though she doesn't specify in step 3, I used low pressure for the last 15 minutes, the veggies came out perfect!

I made a few adjustments to this recipe, because I wanted somethingI could do all at once. I cut the carrots and onion into large pieces and put them in the bottom of the cooker place the roast on top and used new potatoes left whole and put them on top of the roast ...cook under full pressure for 1 hr 15 or so for a 3 lb roast. As long as the skin on the new potatoes is not broken they stay intact and still absorb all the flavor, and I don't have to cool the pot down. My family love the potatoes they are soft and fluffy when you cut into them.

This is a terrific base recipe, but needed a bit more umph in the flavor profile. I made a four pound roast in an electric pressure cooker for 40 minutes on high pressure with a quick release, then threw the potatoes and carrots in for another 8 minutes on high pressure and a natural release. It was extremely tender but I had to add about a tbsp of steak seasoning, a tsp of garlic salt and finished it off with 2 tbsps of flour to the "juice" to make a gravy.  The next time I make it, I'd probably throw in two or three stalks of celery, some mushrooms, about four cloves of garlic, a tsp of dried basil, 1/2 tsp of thyme and maybe two bay leaves (in addition to the steak seasoning, garlic salt and flour to finish it off).

I made it with 2 lb of carrots and 2lb of potatoes. I added 2 tsp of tomato paste and 2 tsp of soy sauce instead of the Worcestershire sauce. I browned the onions.
Everything else i followed the recipe. When i make it again, i will add a bay leaf and some thyme.

Great base recipe.  I made a few adjustments to accommodate our tastes and cooking at 4500f elevation. I added a small can of V8 juice to the broth and added two stalks of celery with the onion. I added garlic powder rather than onion powder (I was out of fresh garlic) I like my vegetables a little firmer so I cooked the roast for 45 minutes, then added the vegetables and cooked for another 5-10 minutes.  I transferred everything to a serving dish, whisked 2T flour into the broth and brought it to a boil, then simmered for 10 minutes to thicken the gravy. This gave just enough time for the meat to rest before I sliced it. No leftovers!

I made this great recipe and in addition made it more versatile by adding 2 additional cans of broth (if your cooker can safely hold it)and delay the addition of worcester sauce until after the roast is fully cooked. After the roast is fully cooked, pour off the extra 2 cans of broth into a bowl and cool (refrigerate) which will bring the fat to the top for easy skimming. Use the fat free super-flavored beef broth as a base for all French Onion soup recipes. All French Onion soup recipes will be kicked up a notch or two and will never taste bland.

Followed the recipe as written. Very easy and excellent results. The meat was very, very tender--the 6-year-old who usually doesn't like meat asked for more. Potatoes were done perfectly. Carrots were very soft, but still tasty. Popped a spaghetti squash in the oven the same time I started the pressure cooker and with very little effort ended up with a lovely autumn supper. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I did make some changes, I quartered an onion, peeled and chopped in half some large carrots and chopped some celery into about 3 inch pieces and put them all in the bottom of the cooker. I sprinkled the ranch dressing mix on both side of the roast and seared it in a few tbsp of oil in a skillet and then transferred it to the cooker. I put about 5 rinsed golden potatoes (whole) on top of the roast.  In a seperate bowl i mixed together 1 can beef consomme, 1 package brown mushroom gravy mix and about 2 large tbsp tomato paste, 1/4 cup water. Then i poured all of that into the cooker. I cooked it for 42 minutes and it was incredible. the potatoes were perfect! the meat fell apart. i kept the leftover meat and shredded it with whatever was left of the veggies and the last potato. the next night i simmered all of the left overs in the broth as i had a good amount. I added in cooked egg noodles and we had soup for dinner. it was amazing. this will get made very often!

Absolutely loved this recipe!  No doubt I will make this again.  The only difference was I used a can of beef consomme instead of beef broth. I used a sweet onion and it was sooo good.  Next time I will put more sweet onion in the mix. I love pressure cooker recipes.  HUGE time savers!

To keep from having a burnt taste, you should scrape up the bits on the bottom of the pan after you pour in the broth. If the meat is tough, you need to keep it under pressure longer (just return it back to cooking under pressure for about 10 minutes and check again).

Very simple and delicious. Family loved it! The meat could have cooked another 10 to 15 min.

Used an electric pressure cooker, set timer for 55 minutes. Roast was very tender, fall-apart. Garlic cloves stuck into meat gave extra flavor. We cooked vegetables in a pot of boiling water while roast was cooking. That way the vege's can be pierced with a fork and you'll know when perfectly cooked.

The recipe in itself is a good starter.  However, cooking the vegetables for 15 min especially bite sized carrots, will not work.  As someone else stated, they will turn to mush.  Instead, I cooked the meat a bit longer (8 min) and cook larger size vegetables for 8.  I usually quarter or half the potatoes and cut carrots into 3rds or half.

I tried this today and it turned out very good. Meat was tender and vegetables flavorful.  My mother used a pressure cooker a lot and I have used one for 47  years of married life. They are great for cooking fresh green beans, beef stew, chicken and rice pilaf, stuffed peppers and many other dishes.  I did leave out the Worcestershire because I forgot it.  This is a classic meal. Thank you for submitting it.

I didn't have high hopes for this as I've never made a pot roast that I really loved but I was really pleased with this one. My roast was just over 2 pounds and it was a Sirloin tip. After searing the roast I removed it to a warm plate and add chopped onions and garlic and sauteed until brown. I then deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup dry red wine, scrapping up all of the brown bits and added a sprig of fresh thyme.  I did add a bit more beef broth, about 2 cups and cooked for the 30 minutes as directed. I didn't want the veggies to overcook so I cut them larger than directed the Worcestershire sauce was added at this point. Brought the pressure back up and cooked for another 10 and it was perfect. After I removed the roast and veggies I used Easy Blend flour¬Æ to thicken the liquid for gravy. This will be a repeat in our home!!

Before browning my roast I tossed the onion, one carrot, a cut up stalk of celery, and a sprig of fresh thyme in my electric pressure cooker to brown. I then removed the vegetables from the pot, added a bit more oil to the pan, sprinkled the seasonings listed as well as some garlic powder (none of which I measured, a pinch just didn't seem enough) on the roast and browned for 5 minutes on each side. I then added the veggies back in the pot tucking some beneath the roast before adding the liquid. I cooked under pressure for 48 minutes without stopping to add the carrots and potatoes. My husband prefer potatoes and carrots cooked separate. I let the pressure release naturally. The flavor of the meat shines through on this recipe. The roast had very good flavor. I had every intention of making gravy but didn't get that far before digging in. I think 2 cups broth is a lot and may reduce it in the future. Great recipe.

The ONLY reason why I'm rating this 3 stars is that the time was not correct.  Not sure if it's because I used an electric PC or what.   I  cooked for 30 minutes on low and it was not done at all and it was tough.  I then cooked an additional 15 minutes on high.  Then added the veggies and cooked another 10 minutes on high.  The roast was very tender and the veggies were perfect.  I used little red potatoes not cut up and they were perfect.   I also used my own special seasoning that I use for all my roasts.

Made this tonight and it was yummy! Only thing different was that I pressure cooked the meat for 40 mins, then the veggies for 8 mins since they were very small. Yum! Will be making it this way from now on!

This was my inaugural Instant Pot experience.  Woo hoo, is it ever GOOD.  I cut back on the onion soup to avoid some sodium.  I only used half.  I tell you the honest t'Gawd's truth, I had to force myself to quit eating!  We loved it.

I am giving this recipe a 3 star because I do believe that the 30 minute cooking time on low is not going to ever cook and tenderize a chuck/blade roast.  I decided at the last minute to use a different recipe that cooks a 3 to 4 pound chuck/blade roast for 70 to 90 minutes on high.  The roast came out the most tender, juicy and flavorful that I have ever tasted anywhere.  The carrots, onions and potatoes went in at the start.  The potatoes to use are the small ruby red potatoes, whole.  With their skins on and the skins not pricked, they cook perfectly, tender but not mushy and the carrots most tender and flavorful.   Cooked at 30 minutes on low would never cook a 3 pound chuck roast.

When the quantity is changed the time to cook needs to change. I looked extensively for time conversion tables but found nothing. My Power Pressure XL did a great job but I did change the time to 55 min. for round 1. I added the veggies and cooked for an additional 45 min. the roast for 8 people was 6 lbs. We had enough left over for one meal for 2. Whoever is cooking one 3 lb. roast for 8 is starving their guests. Otherwise, I cooked as directed and It's my go to from now on.

Very tasty, fast and easy to make on a rushed night.  I used red cooking wine instead of beef broth and it had amazing flavor.  Will use this recipe again soon.

Very easy and quick. Perfect for any evening. I added a small amount of beef bouillon paste and boosted the flavor. But everything turned out super.

The cooking time was too short. Another 15 minutes on the first round would do it. However, 15 minutes for the second round was too long for the carrots they were soggy. Finally, add flavour. Some wine and other seasonings would be good. I found it very bland.

The meat was dry. There was a lot of liquid left in the pressure cooker. The potatoes and carrots were mushy.

Really surprised how well this turned out. This was my first time using a pressure cooker, so I was a bit nervous and sceptical. As always, everyone puts their own spin on the recipe. For me, I added a pack of salt reduced French onion soup mix and cooked on medium pressure instead of the low, otherwise followed recipe as written. I could have used the regular mix, as we had to add salt to it. This was the best pot roast I've ever made or eaten. I'll cook my pot roasts like this from now on. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Excellent base for lots of improvisation. We put in some red wine (yum yum!) and lots of veggies because we were wanted them, and it cooked up perfectly. Very happy with this recipe, will be doing many of my pot roasts this way from now on.

I pretty much stuck to the recipe except I sprinkled a little McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning on the meat and left off the pepper.  I increased the time the meat was in the pressure cooker and it fell apart! It was great! I will definitely make this again!

My roast was 4lbs. I did my own little twist on my recipe. I made the roast and let it rest on keep warm for an hour. I then added my vegetables. It turned out so moist and tasty.

I have a traditional pressure cooker, not an instant pot.
I trimmed almost all the fat so it was pretty lean, and it came out great! Tasted better than when I slow cook a roast for 6 or 7 hours. This is the way I will make it from now on. It was tender, fall apart, perfectly cooked. 

Changes I made: cooked 5 lbs of meat instead of 3, kept liquid as mentioned but added 1/4 cup red wine. Did not want to add the veggies in with the meat, so I left it in the cooker for the whole 45 min.

This dish came out great.
The chuck roast that I used was very tender and flavorful.
I might use more root vegetables,as the carrots and potatoes pretty much disintergrated.

Delicious, I made a few adjustments based on what I had and suggestions I saw in other reviews! I used Marsala dry wine and beef stock and added mushrooms to vegetables! Cooked it in a cast iron Dutch oven with lid and after browning the meat as in the recipe, I placed it in a 250 degree oven for 2 hours, then increased the temp to 325 degrees for another 2 hours, adding the carrots and potatoes the last hour! I think the cast iron Dutch oven cooks hotter so the lower temp and adding more beef stock as needed prevented burning! Delicious meal!!

I added garlic to the meat while browning it. When pressure cooking the meat I cooked it for 40min on high with thyme on top of the meat. The meat was perfect and tender! I added mushrooms, carrots and potatoes after the meat was done cooking. I read the reviews before making this recipe and I agree that 15min is too long for the veggies to be pressure cooked. I went with 10 and although the potatoes held together they almost were too soft.  - - - I made a delicious gravy to go along with this meal by using the broth, garlic powder, onion powder and a touch of milk along with flour. This was one of the best meals I have prepared in awhile. I highly recommend this recipe especially if you go the extra step to add a few more herbs and spices.

I recently discovered using a pressure cooker for pot roast. I love how it cooks the roast, but the veggies are mush. Last time I made it, I roasted them instead, then added them.

I used a half measure  (1.5 lb) an of beef and changed the cut to bottom round steak which was on sale at the time expecting it to be tough (cut it like a steak and chew I thought). I reduced all the other ingredients by about half except the beef stock so my cooker would be happy with fluid levels. The results were super.  The meat was difficult to get out of the pot with tongs as it fell apart on every pinch. This recipe is a keeper because it taste good,  the meat tender, and had a predictable finish time.

This recipe rocks... Made it once, and was immediately told (by my wife) it should be a once a week dinner. Since then, i've added some stuff... 1) diced and browned the onions. 2) added minced garlic 3) use the whole bag of carrots and 4) add a cup of frozen peas for 5 minutes for 5 minutes at the end, when i have them.  Comfort food... :)

I cooked the roast  45 min  and it was not great.  Dry and somewhat tough. 

It had good taste and once it was cut into small pieces it wasn't difficult to chew but it wasn't great.  

The longest I can set my pressure cooker for is 99 min.  I will try again and cook it 99 min to see if it comes out better.  I like my roast to falll apart when I try to pick it up.

I do think you can cook the roast 40 minutes and add the vegetables  after you quick release the pressure cooker and only cook for 7 minutes.  Cut the potatoes thicker, so they don't fall apart. The flavor was amazing.

Very good! The meat was tender and the veggies were maybe a little over done but good. I thought it could use a little more flavor, maybe some garlic. Over all, I will use this as my basic recipe and tweak it to add a little more flavor.

really delicious and a nice change from the typical beef stew flavour of pot roasts.  i did find that the roast didn't cook through in the middle, and would cook it for 45 minutes next time before adding the vegetables (or cut the roast into smaller chunks).

I've made this several times and every time I love it more and more.  So easy and the roast is so tender.  I always add McCormick Beef Stew seasoning just for more flavor, probably doesn't need it.

My family loved it.  My mother was a pressure cooker queen who made an amazing pot roast.  She passed away when I was young so I wasn't able to learn from her.  I wanted to find a recipe that would be easy for me to do well.  This turned out perfectly and my family loved it.  The meat was so tender.  One thing I did differently was that instead of the onion power and salt and pepper I used some Kansas City Steak Company seasonings.  I also cut my vegetables in quarters so they wouldn't get cooked as quickly.  I made gravy with the yummy juices left over.  So good!  I think my mom would be proud. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

New to the pressure cooking realm. Have a Cuisinart electric PC. @ 30 Minutes my chuck roast (3#) was done  but very tough. My wife usually cooks in a slow cooker all day and meat is tender but dry. I'm going to try again, only this time I will do 55 minutes and 10 additional minutes for carrots and potatoes. Hope this makes it tender. Flavor was awesome. Thanks for the recipe

This was my first try using a pressure cooker. Took me a few minutes to figure everything out. Meat was tender and flavorful along with the vegetables. Sure beats waiting all day for the same flavor. Will definitely make it again.

Very easy to make.  Next time I will use a better cut of meat, but my chuck roast, which is what I had handy did good is coming out fairly soft, it's just too much fat.

I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so used steak sauce. That was the only change I made. I removed everything when done and thickened broth for gravy. Delicious!

This was delicious and so fast for what is usually an all-day meal. Used a bone-in arm roast (highly recommend for flavor), added a bit of my favorite flavors of garlic, red wine, and thyme and cut back 5 mins of cook time on the veggies (kept them a little firm). Will make this again and again!

It seems to be a good jumping off point to experiment. There really is no way to mess this up. I use new potatoes and three cups of broth. There are 6-8 of us eating at any one time and we have zero leftovers. It is important to note that you will have to make this a couple of times to figure out what will work for you.

Just a very simple recipe that always turns out flavorful and delicious.  I only made one change which was to use Better Than Bullion and water instead of broth.

Before I made this I read a lot of the reviews and did alter the recipe a little. 

I have made this a few times since I like it so much. 

I do cook the meat longer and cook the veggies less.

I made this for dinner tonight.  Delicious!! I followed the recipe but when I placed the vegetable in the pot I added some minced garlic and a 1/2 teaspoon of beef base.  Also I thickened the gravy with some flour and then brought the pressure back up and cooked for 15 min.  I will certainly make this again.

I added sweet potatoes instead of carrots; and a can of tomatoes and a package of onion soup mix. The meat wasn't quite tender enough so I removed, sliced and cooked an additional 15 minutes under pressure. I use a pressure cooker as I have not purchased one of the instapots yet. I accompanied my meal with gravy made from the broth and roasted cauliflower and brussel sprouts. My family loved it on a cold winter night.

Used blade roast, used garlic salt instead of plain salt.  Everything else the same.  First time using a pressure cooker and we LOVED the tenderness of the meat and the carrots were heavenly.  Potatoes didn't ring any bells.  Next time I would quadruple the carrots and skip the spuds.  Will try injecting the meat with soy and honey.

I wish the recipe said to put the plate in the bottom of the pot. Some recipes want you to use it while others don‚Äôt. Anyway mine burned badly. I will try it again but this time I will use the plate.

Easy and delicious and economical!  I added in some celery (because I love celery) and I think it made it even better.  

Consider less time on the second pressure cook.  The potatoes were a bit mushy.  Probably could have just done 10m vs. 15m.

I'll be making this a lot this winter!

I added mushrooms.....1/2 with the meat and then 1/2 with the potatoes and carrots.  The mushrooms added with the beef came out much better.  Next time I will add all of them with the beef.  Very tasty!

This was terrific. I'm rating 4 stars on the original recipe, but reading the reviews I made changes that make it a 5 star meal for sure. It is so tender I ate the meat using a fork only; a knife is unnecessary. It is hard to mess this up. Here is what I did:

-Did not brown the roast.
-Placed large chunks of carrot, celery, onion on the bottom.
-Heavily salted the 3 pound roast, then placed in the instapot.
-Added about 4 cups of beef broth.
-Added a splash of red wine, worchestershire, pepper, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. 
-Set the instapot for 1 hr 15 min, and left it alone.
(I wanted mashed potatoes, so I just prepared those separately.) The roast came out so tender and tasted fantastic, but I like salt and added a dash more at the table. We'll follow someone else's idea and thicken the broth, then add noodles to make a soup tonight or tomorrow. This meal is a keeper...just add more spices than the recipe calls for.

This is an ---EXCELLENT--- recipe - Very Tender and Tasty! Like many others who commented, I made some modifications. Instead of a "Pot Roast" I used a Tri-Tip Roast (about 3-4 lbs., fat-cap included). I blotted the roast dry with paper towel; seasoned both sides with Kosher Salt; coated all sides with Wondra Flour. Using my Farberware Electric Pressure Cooker I browned all sides in EVOO on SEAR setting. Instead of Onion Powder, I used 1 Lipton Onion Soup Mix  packet and sprinkled all over top of roast along with an unmeasured sprinkle of Garlic Granules (about 1-2 TBLS) and generous sprinkling of Coarse Ground Malabar Black Pepper. I poured 32 ounces of Swanson Beef Stock over the top; omitted the Worcestershire Sauce completely; quartered 4-5 small Red Onions & placed on top; quartered 4-5 medium-sized Red Bliss Potatoes and place on top. I would have put Carrots in, but no room. I placed lid on, selected STEAK/MEAT setting; adjusted the time to 60 minutes & hit START button. Once done, I did a Quick-Release; removed Onions & Potatoes to a bowl and Roast to a platter (easily scrapping off & discarding all the fat-cap without sacrificing any meat (fat came off like softened butter). Selected SEAR setting again & brought liquid to boil, added Wondra Flour to thicken liquid to gravy consistency; put roast & vege's back in pot, put lid on/locked it. Selected KEEP WARM to keep warm until serving time.

This was fantastic. I used a tablespoon of beef Better Than Bullion and 2 cups of water in place of the can of beef broth. I also doubled the carrots and made mashed potatoes on the side. I sprinkled garlic powder and onion powder salt and pepper with a sprinkle of Tony Chachere‚Äôs. It was extremely tender and the carrots were fantastic! I have made it several times  I always use  different spices ... whatever I have on hand, and it has turned out great every time.

I made this in my Instant Pot this evening and it came out great! Potatoes and carrots were just a little softer (not mushy, just softer) than I like, so next time I'll cut back to 10 - 12 minutes. Also added some slivers of fresh garlic, a bay leaf, some extra salt and doubled up on the Worcestershire. Didn't have beef broth so just used a couple of bullion cubes in hot water. Thickened up the sauce by making a slurry with a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch. Everything came together quickly and perfectly!

This is the first recipe I tried with my new Crockpot Pressure cooker.  I pressure cooked the meat for 1 and 1/2 hrs. (I live at 9300 ft elevation). I cooked the meat first, then steamed the potatoes and carrots after for 10 minutes. The potatoes and carrots were perfect and had such good flavor.  Next time I will add 30 min. time to the meat since it didn't fall apart easily.   A good meal!

Like so many others who reviewed, I modified a bit but largely followed the steps provided.  

I had a 2lb roast and followed the timing as written in the recipe but at high pressure. 

I didn't add potatoes and instead made a mashed potato to serve under the roast (it's just a preference) 

I browned onion and garlic along with the roast.  Used the amount of broth listed in the recipe but added 1/2 cup of red wine.  I always season the roast (and generously) before I brown - I pat into the meat to give it a good coating.  Seasoning is key. 

Insanely delicious.

It was tender,  but the recipe called for way too many veggies (I halved the carrots and potatoes and the final product was still more potatoes than meat) and the recipe calls for cooking the veggies too long. The potatoes were basically disintegrating. If you use an Instant Pot make the second cooking time a lot shorter.

Very easy and delicious and fast!
Did not use onion powder or W. sauce. Used low sodium broth in the carton. Added a few parsnips in addition to the other vegetables specified. Cooked the meat for 1 hour. Wanted to make sure it falls apart, which it did. After addition of the vegetables, recommend cooking for only an additional 5 minutes. 15 minutes results in mushy vegetables. Straightforward recipe.

Earned 1 star since the beef was just OK.  The carrots and potatoes were mush after only 12 minutes, rather than the 15 called for.  If you insist on following this recipe use a maximum of 6 minutes for the vegetables.  I threw the vegetables away and saved the meal by making instant mashed potatoes and frozen corn.  Recipe should be removed from the web site.

My first pressure cooker recipe! My family really enjoyed it. My vegetables were on the mushy side. Next time I will bring the pressure up to low instead of high during the last 15 minutes. I removed the roast and veggies and then whisked cornstarch into the leftover juice (my husband is wheat intolerant). It made a wonderful gravy.

This was really tasty! I did the meat as suggested, and it came out perfect, it was moist, totally melt in your mouth goodness. I did the carrots and potatoes in a separate pot with rosemary, thyme, bay leaves and the other spices. When we put it all together it was amazing!

I made it as written. It has a nice, mild flavor, but the onions were mushy. I would add the onions when I add the rest of the vegetables next time. I also would add a bit more seasoning as I like a bolder flavor. Overall, it is a good recipe and only needs tweaks to make the flavors you want.  I thickened the juice and it made a nice gravy.

I Did not make any changes and it turned out fantastic!  I'm an amateur home cook so I had to look at other sights to determine how long it takes to brown before you cook it.  I found 8-10 minutes on each side from a hot pot worked out wonderfully.

I used Cathcarts method of doing everything at once and am very happy with the results. I added tomato paste and a packet of onion/mushroom seasoning. my pressure cooker timer only allows an hour, but I let it go into keep warm setting for 30 minutes more and everything was great.

One of the best uses for a pressure cooker.  Recipe is simple yet full of flavor, and can be easily modified.

This was my first attempt at a pressure cooker pot roast.  It was so delicious.  It was just as good, if not better than any slow cooker pot roast I've ever made.  AWESOME!

Even after cooking chuck roast for 45 min. instead of 30 min, some portions were still tough. Next time I would either cut into chunks after browning or cook for 60 min. to guarantee tender meat.

This was pretty good! I added red wine and used stock instead of broth and threw in some thyme and used sweet potatoes instead of white. I seared it in rendered bacon fat. Good recipe!

First thing I made in my new pressure cooker. I got the wrong cut of meat (2 lb Chuck Shoulder/London Broil) but 30 minutes on high pressure resulted in it cooking a perfect medium. Because I always prefer whole baby carrots and baby dutch potatoes i reduced the time from 15 minutes to 10 minutes on low pressure (perfect, not too mushy). I removed the roast and veggies, put the cooker on Saute and added some flour to create a yummy gravy. Very very yum!

I made this in my electric pressure cooker. I used tiny red potatoes and pre-peeled carrots otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. The meat was pull-apart render and the vegetables were done. Great Sunday dinner.

Mine was very, very tough...but it was a 4.5lb roast. So, does tenderness reflect in the size of the roast? I was just hoping for leftovers. The carrots and potatoes were divine! Scrumptious! I added mushrooms, too...and they were wonderful. Just a really tough piece of chuck roast! Dang!

This recipe COULD be good but as written, it's just a sort of ok. First off, I'm using a regular PC - - not an Instant Pot; and I am an avid cook. I have a gas stove. Recipe calls for building pressure then cooking on low. I could not get the pressure to maintain when I put the heat to a 5 let alone lower (on a scale of 1 - 10 with 1 being the lowest). So not sure how the author did that per the recipe. Second, this was pretty bland. We will use the leftovers to make tacos, but as a roast, it didn't have enough flavor. We don't particularly like the carrots and potatoes cooked with the roast, so I did just the meat and onions. Since I didn't have to stop it half way to add other veggies, I cooked it the solid 45 min. When I opened the lid to check  the meat, I foudnd it was very tough and not fully cooked. I put it back on for another 15 min. It certainly could have used longer but my son and I had to be somewhere.  Lastly, I love onions and they came out very mushy. So again, I think this recipe needs some tweaking.

this was my 1st meal in a pressure cooker. Meat was super tender a flavorful.  The only problem I had was the meat stuck to the bottom and in the last 15 minutes and burnt really bad in the center of the pan. Not sure why or if I should have used the cooking rack?  veggies were Real good too. (instead of the onion I used dry onion soup packet, saved room for more carrots)Thanks for sharing

Made this exactly was written and it was AMAZING! Even my picky kids were saying it was the best thing they have eaten. Not sure how anyone would have tough meat from this, I did cut my meat in half to speed up the cooking..other than that it was perfect!

The potatoes and carrots  came out a little softer than I would have liked. Ether adding them in foil packs, or a little later  in the cook time might provide firmer veg.

tasty, easy. delicious. word to wise...I made it about 5 hours before serving and had it warming until served. By that time, the potatoes had zapped all of the broth!  If I need to prepare it early again, I will cook meat and keep warming, then add the carrots and potatoes for 15 minutes right before serving!

I just got an Instant Pot and came to allrecipes to find my first dish. I've never used a pressure cooker so I was pretty cautious in picking the recipe. I went with this because it looked very doable, and it was. My hubby and I are on a Paleo diet so this fit it perfectly with the exception of potatoes. It was easy to leave them out. 
Very easy and very YUM! The best part was the onions. I wish I had used more. Some onion with each bite of meat was perfect! No changes except to learn the Instant Pot better. Next time I'll add another veggie - mushrooms or zucchini, and definitely more onions!

Turned out great. Will make again but cook veggies and potatoes 10 mins at most.  15 mins made all veggies mushy. Also I used a round bone roast, which held together nicer than a chuck roast but I prefer chuck roast.

It was a standard pot roast recipe, but it was a huge help in walking me through pressure cooking the roast.  Definitely will experiment with ingredients, but this is a good starting point.

Only added celery. Family really enjoyed it.  Will cook 5 to 10 minutes less next time. We used Fissler Vitaquick 81/2 quart  pressure cooker and the potatoes and carrots were slightly over cooked.

Great way to prepare tough meat.  Make sure to add enough broth to this to keep it from drying out.  I added the carrots and onion at the start and let it cook the total time without a rest.  Now this made the carrots mushy however, it really enhanced the flavor of the meat.

Amazing recipe!! Thank you guys for sharing! :)  I also kept the juice from the soup and add it later in noodles. It was really great as they were small pieces of potatoes, carrots and meat which gave the soup awesome taste! :)

Yum! Juicy and flavorful. My pressure cooker has only a high setting, so I pressure cooked for 20 mins, natural release method. Next time I'll try 18 mins.  Not quite amazing enough for a 5 star recipe, but a great, easy recipe that I'm sure I'll make again and again, playing with the seasonings and added veggies.

I looked up this recipe pretty much just to use up a roast I had been given, but it was so easy and delicious that I think this is probably going to end up in regular rotation.
