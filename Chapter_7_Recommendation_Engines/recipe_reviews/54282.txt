This stew is absolutely delicious!  Great flavors, wonderful spices.  Did not change anything except used 2 cans of green beans, since I did not have fresh on hand.  This is a good recipe if you are following a low-carb eating plan, too.

I love lamb and am always looking for new recipes.  This one is so easy and is really delicious.  I couldn't find dried mint, so I used Greek seasoning which has dried mint in it.  Try it!  You'll love it!

I used to make this a lot and had forgotten about it.  Very good flavor and so easy!  If you have mint growing in your garden in the summer this would be a good reason to dry some for the winter!  My family loved this.  Thanks for sharing.

I used Greek seasoning as suggested by another reviewer, garlic flakes, more cinnamon, and I pureed a can of Italian style stewed tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce. And I served it over white rice. The dish was amazingly good. My husband absolutely loved it.

Excellent!! Although it was much nicer when I sauted minced garlic with the onion Also use mixed herbs or Italian herbs instead of dill or mint

I remember thinking that the recipe was too easy and basic to be that good.  It was absolutely fantastic!  The spices are a perfect blend with the tomato sauce.  It is not a strong flavor for those who like bursting flavor or spice.  It is more subtle and quite delicious.

I am going to add a clove or two of garlic to the onion and celery and before adding the meat. The green beans should be cut or snapped into bite size hunks. Overall, very tasty! My family also enjoyed.

This was delicious!!!!!!!  My aunt used to make this when I was younger.  I forgot all about it and am so glad that I found it again.  The sauce doen't need to be thick so I didn't add anything to this recipe.  I do agree that this is just as good if not better the next day.  I can't wait to make this with fresh green beans from the garden!

Absolutely the best lamb stew I've ever made! I omitted the celery and parsley as we don't like them, and I used fresh herbs instead of dried. I was skeptical about adding the cinnamon but I'm glad I did - it gave the stew a distinctly Middle Eastern aroma and flavor, which I love. It was a little bit watery when I added my fresh green beans but that was no biggie - I just left off the lid for the last 20 mins of cook time. Perfect! Fantastic recipe, Kathy! Thanks so much!

I have been cooking for my fiance for the 3 years we've been together pretty regularly.  She said this was the best thing I've ever made her, and top 5 meals she's ever had.  The broth/sauce was incredible.  Perfectly seasoned, tender, subtle and delicious.  I made a couple additions I highly recommend.  Like others suggested, I sauteed garlic with the celery and onion, and I added carrots.  I used leg of lamb - so much better.  I left the fat on the pieces and cooked the stew with the bones in the pot for extra flavor.  Try it, it's incredible.  Will definitely make this often again!

I also made it with the Syrian Bread recipe on this site.  In my opinion, the bread makes a perfect combo with the stew and my house smelled unbelievable all day.

Great! I added more mint & dill and some fresh garlic. The sauce cooks down very nicely - I was worried it would be watery. The mister says its the best lamb stew he ever had. Thanks!

I am wondering if it is too watery for some people because they simmered it covered, instead of uncovered? The recipe does not say to cover.

Really good and easy to make. Not sure why the lamb has to simmer so long, though. It would also be good with potatoes added.

We couldn't believe how fabulous this was. It was AMAZING. I followed the recipe exactly, other than using fresh dill and mint instead of the dried. I was afraid that it would be bland, but it was anything but. Good ol' lamb. My husband, mother-in-law, and I couldn't get enough. I'm about to cook up another batch.

My kids loved this because it was bland.   My husband not so much.  We eat mostly Indian food so this didn't have that kick we usually like. I added cauliflower and used frozen green beans.  I didn't have mint and celery so I had to skip those ingredients.

I am not sure why my result was so different from the other reviewers!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was WAY too watery (3 cups of water was tooooooo much).  I had to add a lot of cornstarch to thicken it up.  It also had absolutely no flavor.  After my family had a serving, I went back and added a bunch of spices just to give it some flavor.  Sorry, but this was just not good as written.  I hope after it sits with the extra spices, it will be better.

Easy, pleasant and healthy, but quite bland. Tripling the herbs and spices, adding a teaspoon or two of fennel seeds, and replacing the water with lamb stock and red wine helps boost the flavours.

This is an outstanding recipe!  I was a little concerned about the dill-cinnamon combination but wow!  I made it as written and will make it again and again.  It makes me laugh that people  change the recipe quite  a bit the first time that they make it and then rate THEIR  recipe.

I added a clove of pressed garlic to the oil with the celery and onion, which I personally think was necessary, but I imagine the recipe as prepared is also very good.  I also did not use the full 3 cups of water--I started with one and then added a little more as it thickened.  

The result was delicious!  Excellent flavor, and was something different than the basic beef+potatoes+carrots stews I usually make.

Wow great. Doubled the spices except for cinnamon. Added garlic and cook with lid off until you add fresh green beans. Yummy.

I have made a similar dish for my family many times with beef, but it's incredible with lamb!  I didn't have celery, so I substituted a green pepper.  Amazing!  I didn't have mint either, and I omitted the dill and sugar.  It turned out fantastic!  My family ate it up!  5 stars!

I have a Greek neighbor who made this for me but used beef,onions and slow cooked this stove top for 2 hrs till the beans were quite soft..It was very nice.It was served as is with crusty bread and a feta salad.He tells me in Greece families use this method for any type of meat including pork and chicken.I am going to try this tonight using pork.I may omit the mint and substitute sage.To the beef he added a touch of nutmeg with the sugar.Amazing!!!

Good but not great.  I felt more needed to be added to give the green beans some kick.  While I love lamb and green beans, I probably wouldn't make this again.

Some lamb and some green beans and a lot of broth.  I didn't really taste the seasonings and I followed the recipe exactly.  Won't be making this again.

I thought this recipe was great.  My husband on the other hand did not care for it and he usually likes anything. I did add more tomato sauce and water so that there was more gravy and thickened it up with some Wondra/water mixture.  That was good. Served over rice. Scaled to 6 servings. Yummy.

This is my favorite way to make lamb. I threw the lamb and spices in the crockpot and added the green beans about an hour before serving. The lamb was so tender and the spices were a perfect combination.

My family really likedthis recipe and said they'd rather have this than roasted lamb! I thought it was very good but if I was rating on just what I thought I would have given it a 4/5

My family LOVED this!! My husband and kids have never tried lamb before (my youngest son who said the blessing that added "Pleeeeease help this food taste goo, amen" He cleaned his bowl and asked for leftovers the next day. I made it as-is and it was wonderful!!

I didn't actually make it yet. But I definitely will. I grew up eating my grandfather's lamb'n bones.
I looked forward to it every spring. Dipping crusty bread into the tomato gravy and sopping it all up until you had nothing but lamb and green beans. Thanks to whoever posted this recipe.

the broth was excellent.  I think I would add a couple of potatoes next time.  I will make it again.

Very flavourful. Great for comfort food on cold days. I used frozen green peas instead. I added rosemary and fresh thyme.

Forgot to put the pinches of cinnamon and sugar in.   Still great.  I will be making it again and will add them next time.  I did add a couple diced potatoes since it was the only dish I was serving and wanted to be sure it was filling enough for my husband.  Tasty recipe.

I used this recipe as a blueprint this last night for my Greek Easter dinner, and I was very impressed with the quality of the recipe. I made a few changes: I used a leg of lamb instead of the lamb shoulder, and I browned the lamb in the oil first before cooking the onions (with about four added cloves of garlic--it isn't Greek without garlic!). Then I added two 6-ounce cans of tomato paste and about two cups of hot water, along with the lamb, and added my seasonings: a bit of cinnamon, some oregano, salt, and pepper. Then I let everything cook as in the recipe, adding my green beans at the end. So good. I will say that it took much longer than I anticipated, but that could have more to do with the fact that I did it in a college dorm rather than at my own stove. All in all, I hope to make this again next year for Greek Easter!

I added picante sauce with the tomato sauce and did not add the water. I did not use the mint celery or dill. The kids loved it! This was their first time eating lamb and would not try "lamb" when I asked them to. Tried this recipe and did not tell them what the meat was and I got great reviews. I will try this again and maybe use chicken.
