Our family really likes this recipe, but I always
use 5 cups of rhubarb (4 cups isn't enough). Using
either raspberry gelatin or strawberry tastes great. A very quick and easy dessert to prepare. To other rhubarb lovers; this is one recipe you must have in your recipe box. "Thanks Darlene for this wonderful recipe, it's a winner"!!!

This recipe may sound strange - it may sound like "a bit much" but trust me, it's delicious - a family favorite (that I had lost!)...even rhubarb haters will love it.  And it's EASY!

I substituted sugar free jello and used Splenda sweetener.  This was awesome!!  Also good with a couple tablespoons of frozen light cool whip instead of vanilla ice cream.

Oh, I hate to say it, but this was terrible!  It was sickeningly sweet, and it never really turned into cake, more like rhubarb with a crust/crumble.  I admit that I was rather skeptical when I layered all  of the ingredients, thinking that it would not turn into a real cake - and indeed it didn't.  There are such better things to do with rhubarb that don't involve turning into a chewy jammy substance-kind of like fruit leather around the edges.

This was very easy but I thought it was sickening sweet. Next time, I'll reduce the sugar. I also didn't care much for the cake mix powder that was left on the top, but that's a dump cake for 'ya!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! I did not have raspberry jello, so I used strawberry & it was so tasty. I imagine that one could use any of the various flavors of Jello. The ease of assembling this dessert is perfect for the busy lifestyle of today's woman. Thanks, Darlene-this recipe is a KEEPER!!

I loved this cake.  I make it all the time.  I found the raspberry jello a  little sharp so switched it to strawberry and it is even better.

This recipe is now one of our favorites. I freeze my rhubarb and have been making this for over a year now... although I play around with the recipe.(I have made this with strawberries, leaving out the jello) A great recipe and easy enuf for a bachelor or student to make - you don't need a bowl or spoon! HAHA

I have made this a couple of times and people seem to love it.  I don't like to change a recipe much but I did cut the sugar a bit and used sugar free jello.  I was great!

This recipe is delicious and simple.  No mixing required.  I used strawberry jello instead and we like it that way even better.

I was a bit skeptical as I was making this cake. Really? Nothing to stir or mix? Yes, it is really that easy and yes, it is that delicious. The whole pan was gone within 24 hours at my house! I used sugar free Jell-o, and this is going to sound strage, but all I had was strawberry kiwi... it was still AWESOME. My new summer favorite! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I used what i had on hand, so i replaced the yellow cake mix with white and used cran-rasp jello. i also cut the sugar in half and it was still super sweet. I will try it without the sugar next time. Great recipe! It is so simple!

I used 2 cups of frozen blueberries and 2 cups of rhubarb.  Only 1/2 cup of sugar since the blueberries are sweeter.  Cranberry jello instead of raspberry.  Don't be afraid to mix things up.  It's a great recipe.  I used too much water (since my fruit was frozen) so I just baked it longer and i was great!

For those who have never really cared for rhubarb like myself, this recipe will change your mind. We were served this at a relatives cottage with fresh rhubarb.  I politely declined a piece and only had a bite of my husband's after all the raves about it. Ended up having my own piece and got the recipe as well.  A bit of Summer indulgence!

This is a five generation recipe in our family, but we call it Rhubarb Cobbler.  Instead of melting the butter, we cut it into the cake mix (we use 1/2 of a cake mix) until crumbly, then just sprinkle it on top of gelatin layer.  I also add only 1/4 c. of water or less, poured into one side of the dish, as we don't like it too runny.  Either way...outstanding!!!

This is a keeper! Everyone Loves this. 

I used 5 cups of Rhubarb for more of the flavor and gave the top layer light swirls before baking to moisten any dry mix showing. Be care to not go too deep, you don't want to disturb the Rhubarb when swirling.  :o)

We absolutely enjoyed this dish--we added some cut up leftover pheasant the last ten minutes and topped it off with cut up cherry tomatoes as well, only had cheddar shredded.. YUMMY!!  My husband and I had 3 helpings each.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was tried by my husband who insisted there was no mixing or stirring.  Well, there were spots and even large areas of just dry cake mix that didn't combine with the water or melted butter, so I sprayed those areas with PAM  and left it in the oven for 5 minutes.

Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup.    Cake mix stayed powdery on top - will try mixing it slightly next time.  Tastes great - very easy - kids like it too!

This is the same recipe my grandma Ida used for years......it was published in our church cookbook in 1990 and she had been making it for years prior to that.  The only difference in her recipe was that she used white cake mix instead of yellow, which gives it even a lighter taste, but yellow cake mix works very well, also.  Our family loves it.   I substitued a different recipe one time and my family was upset......why would I change something they loved??:)   Lesson learned.....a tried and true recipe.

This was great. The water makes it less rich and of course healthier. I love Rhubarb so I only used 1/4 cup of sugar.This was sweet enough and I had a little tang of the rhubarb. For me this was plenty of sugar with the jello. I did use strawberry jello. My rhubarb was frozen so I followed the directions and used just 1/2 cup of water. The only alteration I made was I did top it with 1 cup of chopped pecans (also like the old original recipe called for).

Excellent recipe.  I too have fooled my rhubarb hating husband with it!  I usually use a white cake mix and strawberry gelatin though.  And I always top it with cool whip. Yum.

I made this yesterday and it turned out great. Very buttery and sweet. I cut the sugar down a bit and used sugar free strawberry gelatin. I also cut the water to about 3/4 c. since I diced up an extra cup of rhubarb. I cooked it about 55 minutes to get the top a golden brown. I will make this again.

I followed the instructions and was overall disappointed. The rhubarb was lost in the jello and the cake mix on top did not come out very cake-like. I will not make this again & most likely will dump it in the garbage. A waste of rhubarb.

I was hesitantly excited to find a recipe for rhubarb cake that was so easy, but once I really paid attention to the instructions, I strongly suspected trouble.  As I suspected. this recipe did not go well.  In fact, this recipe was terrible.  Shame on me for actually deciding to use a recipe with a mix.  However, the mix is not to blame.  This is simply a horrible method to produce a "cake", as member CHINDERS also alludes: "it never really turned into cake".  I was severely disappointed and embarrassed that I had made the poor judgement to make it in the presence of my friends, who thankfully are not the snarky type.

I used a sugar-free cake mix, sugar-free jello, and artificial sweetener.  It is wonderful!  I also added an oatmeal and lite margarine crumble with 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  So good.

I have made this with sugar free or no sugar added cake mix (Pillsbury) and also no sugar jello.  It is sooo good.  If you have someone in your family that is diabetic (like I do), this is a great recipe for them.

I made this yesterday when our friends came over for dinner.  I did not have a yellow cake mix but used a spice cake mix I had on hand.  I also used Jello Fusion - which was flavored cherry, orange, and something else I'm not sure what the third fruit flavor was.  I increased the butter by about 2 tablespoons, I also increased the water by about 1/3 cup even though my rhubarb was frozen - baked it for the full 45 minutes - it turned out wonderful!  I liked the fact that the spice cake added cinnamon and other spices which made it almost seem like a rhubarb crisp!. Thanks for the recipe - simple and quick as our invitation was spur of the moment.  Topped with Blue Bell Vanilla Ice Cream!  Yummy!  Review from:  Pat P. - Parker, Colorado

I gave this recipe to a friend to try.  Before she could bring me a piece to try, she and her husband ate it all.  She made it with strawberry jello.  I just made it for a family reunion and it was a big hit.  My niece's husband couldn't stop eating it.

I just pulled this out of the oven and is cooled enough to taste.  YUM! I added a cup of strawberries, I was just a bit short on the rhubarb and used wild strawberry jello.  Much better than I expected.  Will make again!

This tasted great but I was a little suprised at what I had at the end of process.  It was REALLY more like a cobbler than a cake and I was kinda disappointed by the loose, dry cake mix sitting on the top.  We also used strawberry jello.  But again, it tasted great and was a great recipe for my fresh, spring rhubarb.

My fiance and I love this recipe - used sugar free jello mix.  The combination of sweet and sour from the rhubarb is great!  I wouldn't call it a cake, but rather a bar, but very good.

I was pretty disappointed when I first tried this. The cake doesn't seem to set, so its all slightly gooey. The taste is good though, and I have been enjoying eating it straight from the freezer. I don't think I'll be making this again.

I used strawberry Jell-o. This dessert was a huge hit at a potluck last night.  Definitely a recipe I'll use again.  I do agree with others that it isn't really a cake.

Very fast and easy.  I substituted strawberry jello for Rasberry and I cut down on the sugar because I like it a little tart.  One of my favorite recipes for rhubarb.

Wonderful!! As a suggestion, once everything is in the pan, give the cake mix and water a light mixing.  Be careful not to disturb the rhubarb. Excellent cobbler-type dessert over vanilla ice cream!

This recipe is exactly what I was loking for especially warm with vanilla ice cream.  I was out of sugar and too lazy to go the store so I used powdered sugar instead.  It turned out perfect.
