I wanted something to make with my polenta log that I had, so I searched and found this recipe.  It was fairly tasty, but kind of dry.  Next time, I will make more of a sauce to add to it or maybe use spaghetti sauce.  I did like the fresh peppers and sausage that gave it some good flavor.  I didn't have any of the soft cheeses in the recipe, so I put a handful of shredded mozzerella on top.  Next time, I may put some parmesan as well.

I have a vegetarian, a teenager, Iâ€™m Italian and getting a meal this  fabulously tasty was a bonus.  I added garlic and mushrooms for more veggies  and, made the polenta from scratch. This recipe is at the top of our list for best meals .

Pretty good recipe. I used a splash of rice vinegar instead of the wine. Will probably make again sometime in the future.

Excellent dish!  Didn't have fresh parsley, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Will definitely make this again.  A nice lower carb recipe.
