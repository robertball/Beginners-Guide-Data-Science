I made some pretty serious modifications to this recipe and we loved the result. Unfortunately, I can't rate the recipe as written but I'll share my changes. After seeing the reviews on the vinegar based sauce I decided to omit it altogether and punch up the flavor of the marinade to compensate. I used Greek yogurt, smoked paprika, fresh lemon juice, Sriracha (2 tablespoons), salt, fresh ground pepper, plus the garlic, olive oil, and cayenne.  Be sure to spray your grill with non-stick cooking spray before turning it on or it will stick like crazy. Nice color, super tender, and delicious!

This is a good chicken marinade although it could use a bit of kosher salt in the marinade. I marked this down a star because the 'glaze' has a lot more Olive Oil than it really needs and makes far too much for the chicken.  I used the left over to marinate some peppers & onions to grill the next day.  Thanks for an inspiring recipe Chef John.

I love this recipe! I do not have a grill in my apartment, so I baked the chicken in an oven at 375 degrees. It came out delicious and my fiancee is asking for it again this week.

This was excellent! Marinade was wonderful. For the sauce after its cooked, I'd probably go with half the amount of sherry vinegar next time but thats just a personal preference on my part. I also might try a little cornstarch to thicken it a bit. But overall this was a delicious recipe and pretty easy to make. My two kids loved it, my seven year old even asked for seconds :)
Chef John, thanks for the recipe...

Delish - but I "tweaked" it a little. I had Greek Plain Yogurt in the fridge - used that and way more Garlic that this called for (3 heaping T. of crushed Jar Garlic)- which is our thing. I added two good pinches of Salt to the marinade per other reviews. My Sister had brought me a large bag of Paprika from her trip to Hungary. I can't read the label....so we didn't know that it was HOT Paprika. I did not make the glaze - it didn't need it. I didn't do such a great job at wiping off the marinade either. Just threw the chicken on the hot grill. I kept moving the Chicken around the grill so it didn't blacken. I used boneless, skinless breasts and thighs. Something different to do with Chicken! YEA! Served with Green Beans and Brown Rice. Thank you Chef John. You are one of my favorite Cooks on AR!

This has made it into my family rotation. We used Greek yogurt and Sriracha sauce as the chili sauce. I also added some Garlic salt with parsley and upped the amount of fresh smashed garlic. It was so tender and delicious. Well worth the wait! Thank you, Chef John!

This really IS good frickin chicken! I didn't think the added vinaigrette at the end would add anything flavor-wise but it cuts the heaviness of the yogurt marinade perfectly. Loved it! :o)

Followed recipe as written. Used the sherry mixture as a glaze at the end of grilling. Would use a tad more heat in both the marinade and the glaze. Was still fantastic as written

Wow--this was REALLY good! I was really surprised by the sauce; I wasn't sure how it would be, but it wound up being really good. I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I used 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tbsp of balsamic. I liked it so much I used it for the grilled broccoli and cauliflower we had with it. Great recipe; I'll definitely make this again!  The commenter that said to oil your grate was right, though--it stuck like glue, so be sure to do that!

Awesome recipe!  I have shared it with my friends and it has become a family favorite. It is also good for leftovers. The only change I made was to triple the sauce because it is so yummy.

I love watching you cook, what I  would love to see is a complete dinner menu. What do you serve with the delicious chicken you just made? I have bought far too many cookbooks over the years and they all have, what I see for me,  to be the same problem. Just add a little side dish that goes with what you are making and I will be a very happy cook. Donna

Cut my chicken into bite size chunks, allows the marinade to penetrate more surface area. Plus now i can skewer and grill or just grill the chunks either way the flavour is more intense. Great flavour, great reciepe. Very easy to add personal touches without ruining the essence.

Delicious.  I actually didn't have plain yogurt so I used the top of an unmixed (fruit on the bottom) peach yogurt.  Didn't matter.  It tasted great.  Hot and sweet.  My family loved it.  I will make a bigger batch ahead of time next weekend to take on vacation.  I served it with vinegar marinated cucumbers and potato salad.  This is a great, easy recipe.

This turned out awesome.  I could not find the paste so I used a creamy garlic hatch pepper sauce in its place. In stead of ketchup I used cocktail sauce. This is a keeper.

Isn't 180 degrees internal high?  I have always (since 2004 when the metrics were changed) removed at about 163 degrees, let sit, and it raises to about 165 degrees.  Sweet and juicy at 165 IMHO.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I didn't have plain yogurt and substituted my morning coconut yogurt and it added a yummy sweetness. Also works great as baked chicken.

Very good!!  Grilling chicken makes me nervous but it was so worth it!  Only made changes as I didn't have things on hand.  Used Greek yogurt, extra Franks Red Hot, and smoked BBQ rub in place of paprika( it was as close as I could get!)  This had wonderful flavor!!!  I'll be making this again!! Thanks for the recipe!

I did this pretty much verbatim but did not follow through with the glaze at the end...maybe I should have. I found this to be mediocre at best.

This is not too bad, I will make it again.  I only had time to marinade  for two hours and I thought it was going to be SUPER HOT but it didn't have any spice to it just a good flavor.  I cooked it on the grill but 10 minutes was not nearly enough, especially with the breast meat Tyson grows (YIKES). 

I also omitted the vinegar glaze as others noted and added lemon juice and Shiracha because we had it here.  I would make it again with these modifications.

is it just me or is there no way to cook a 5 lb cut up chicken in 10 min over medium high grill heat?  anyway.. i burnt it initially, then turned down the heat and cooked it a bit longer.  Since it was "blackened" i added some thyme molasses, sugar and allspice to the finishing sauce and went Jamaican on it. i basted it a couple of times while it was finishing on low heat. It actually turned out great!

Delicious! I ended up chunking the chicken and grilled them on skewers. I also substituted red wine vinegar (same amount) instead of the sherry vinegar. The only thing that made this recipe less than perfect, was the large amount of leftover vinaigrette. I didn't use very much, since I brushed it on as a light glaze after grilling.

We used two pounds of boneless skin on chicken thighs. When grilled the skin blackened a little from the yogurt marinade. We didn't have any chili paste on hand but delicious anyway. One of our picky eaters asked for a bite and then seconds! Will make again.

i think bf liked this more than i did.. i cut this in half and used 1 lb boneless skinless breasts that i cubed up to use as skewers on the george foreman.. i upped the garlic and yogurt a bit and used 1/8 tsp cayenne.. i know the name of the recipe has paprika in it.. but i just felt like there was too much paprika.. like too much earthiness.. i started making the basting sauce and before adding the oil in it, i tried it.. i couldn't see using that much oil and tried dipping the chicken in it.. i just wasn't feeling it.. bf said he felt like it contrasted and would have liked some kind of tzatziki sauce with it.. either way it's always fun to try something new
