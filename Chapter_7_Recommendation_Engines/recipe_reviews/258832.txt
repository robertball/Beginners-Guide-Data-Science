This is so good! I added a green onion and used jalapeno stuffed green olives. Swapped out the green pepper for a yellow one (preference). The recipe didn't state what type of vinegar so I used white. Let it sit in the fridge overnight. This would be great to take to a summer potluck picnic!

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. I thought I made as written but looking back over it now I realize that I accidentally left out the sugar. I didn't even notice. This was delicious. The cauliflower absorbed the perfect amount of the dressing taking that bitter bite out of it . Everything just worked together perfectly. It gets better as it sits overnight in the refrigerator. If you are needing to bring a side dish to a summer picnic then this is the one you want to take.  This is 5 stars all the way and one of the best recipes I've tried all year.

I wanted a cauliflower salad recipe which did not use mayo. I made a few changes using what I had on hand. I used canned black olives which I always have, bottled green olives stuffed with garlic and sun dried tomato, a yellow bell pepper and a spring onion. I didn't have celery, green bell pepper nor pimento peppers. My substitutions worked fine. I will make this salad again.
