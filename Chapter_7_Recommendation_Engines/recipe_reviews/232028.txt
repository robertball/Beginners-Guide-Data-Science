I'd give this more stars if I could!  Great combination of flavors.  I used what I had, so there are a few substitutions, but this had a wonderful, light, summery flavor.  I used 1/2 fresh mango with the frozen bananas and peaches.  I only had plan yogurt, but added some vanilla almond milk so the mango wouldn't make it too thick.  Will definitely make this again.

WOW! Normally not a big fan of smoothies, but thought I would give this one a try since I do like Mangos and Peaches - SO glad that I did. Really easy to make, and the taste was a 14 on a scale of 1-10! Especially great in warm weather, as nothing refreshes like this. 7-Star recipe, shame they only let me rate it 5 :-)
