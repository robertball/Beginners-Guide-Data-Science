This is an excellent recipe if you are familiar with southern cornbread but never cooked it and want to try with a basic recipe.  If you are new to making it, some things you DEFINITELY need to know: 1)"Dry Corn Bread Mix" is "corn meal mix" with the baking powder and flour already in it, and not Jiffy or sweet brands. The Aunt Jemima, Martha White or White Lily brands are perfect. Sweet dressing doesn't have the traditional southern taste. 2)Sage is delicious but it is VERY strong. If you are not used to sage, cut the recipe amount in half and add your sage to the recipe before the eggs, so you can taste as you go along. 3)The more you stir and mix this recipe, the more dense and gummier it gets. If its "wet" before you bake it, the stiffer it will be when it's done. It will sit up like a brick! If you like a lighter, fluffier dressing ("stuffing" like), only add as much liquid as needed to be visibly moist like thick stew; it should still be chunky when you pour it in the baking dish to get a light consistency. 4)For non-vegetarians, add meat to this dish! Almost any meat will go well: cubed or shredded turkey, ham, chicken, sausage, ground beef, bacon. Try your favorite. 5)BE CAREFUL if you use poultry seasoning, some blends have salt. Reduce the recipe salt if needed. 6) My grandma told me her secret to good dressing is the vegetables, so use plenty celery & onion. Cook them only until tender and the onions are translucent so you don't lose all the crunch. It adds great t

I made a few modifications to make it more like my Grandma's recipe - increased celery to 1 cup, added 3/4 cup chopped bell pepper, 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning + large pinch of sage, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and used the entire mix of cornbread instead of 3 cups as it says (Jiffy brand comes in 8 1/2 oz. boxes - use 2 boxes). Wow, what a hit with my crowd! I found it easy to bake it for 30 minutes the night before, refrigerate, let it come to room temperature, then bake it 10-15 minutes before serving is perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Be sure to use a cornbread mix that doesn't include sugar.  In the Oklahoma area, Shawnee Mills mix is sugar-free.  Jiffy Cornbread Mix DOES contain sugar.  If you can't find a sugar-free mix, buy a bag of cornmeal and follow the instructions to bake your own cornbread from scratch.  The dressing won't taste right otherwise.  My grandmother used a similar recipe, but added 2 or 3 chopped hard-boiled eggs to the dressing mixture before baking.  The amount of sage you need depends on personal taste and how long ago the jar of sage was bought and opened.  Add sage by single teaspoons (BEFORE you put in the raw, beaten eggs), stir well, and taste test after each teaspoon.  This will ensure you get a perfect pan of dressing!

This was wonderful...but I had to make some changes. The original recipe calls for making ALOT of cornbread and then only asks you to use 3 cups of it, which would have only made 1/2 a pan of dressing anyway. I doubled the amount of cornbread (since there was more than enough there) and doubled everything else too. I also added one can of cream of celery soup. It was YUMMY!!  :)

This turned out a lot better than I expected. My Mamaw is the only one in the family who makes dressing, but this year I'm not going to be home for it. I decided to strike out on my own and give it a try. I have a couple of tips to add. I increased the chicken stock by about a 1/4 cup and be sure you use a glass or light colored baking dish. The dark baking pan will dry this out. Also, I broke the rules and used Jiffy (with sugar) for my cornbread. I have to say, I like the added sweetness. It isn't as sweet as most other brands so it still came out pretty good. It's not the same as Mamaw's, but I don't have left overs either.

This is really similar to the recipe that my grandmother passed down to me. You can also substitute the chicken stock for the pan drippings if you are also cooking a turkey. When prepared with the drippings it is delicious and full of flavor.

This has been the best version I have found, made it for my office party and they went gaga, the key is to chop onions and celery in proceesor so find that the dressing is smooth.  Highly recommended!

Don't make the mistake I did, using the same amount of ground sage as this recipes calls for in dried sage.  I may try it again, but not soon.

This recipe is wonderful! To change it up a little though, I only added 1 beaten egg. And then I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. The soup held the dressing together, made it perfectly moist, and added a really nice flavor to it!

If you add the  sage to the chicken stock and warm the liquid up, it helps tremendously with the sage distribution. Therefore you won't feel you have to add more or maybe use less ( depending on your taste). I also add green pepper to the saut√©.... It's what we call the holy trinity of cooking. I also add cream of muchroom and chicken soup to the mixture as well as prepackged breadcrubs... For added texture I boil the innards of the turkey ( or chicken) with the stock and use the extra meat inside the dressing. Oh yeah, when my mom taught me to make this she told me to make sure the cornbread baked long enough for the bottom to turn at least medium brown.

I love this recipe! I was looking for one that was similar to my mother's. She never had a written recipe, and this was almost identical! It'a simple and easy enough to add extra ingredients for variations. Will definitely make this a Thanksgiving staple.

I've been looking for a good dressing recipe that
would be similar to the kind of dressing my mother
always made at Thanksgiving (we lost her to cancer
2 years ago), and this is it!  The blending of flavors
and moistness of this recipe is fantastic. I changed
the chicken stock to vegetable stock, increased the
celery to 1 cup, and the crumbled cornbread to 4
cups, and it fit nicely in an 8 x 8 inch dish (not sure
why the recipe calls for a 9 x 13 inch dish). Also,
the potency of sage is directly affected by the type
of sage (rubbed, ground or dried), and how old it is,
so add in 1 teaspoon increments, and taste. I grow
and dry my own herbs, and 1 tablespoon was plenty,
to me. Thank you Amy for a true 5 star recipe that
not only tastes heavenly, but brings back memories
of my mother. Highly recommended!!!

You can't call it grandmas if your making cornbread from a box. Get you a med size iron skillet, heat it in the oven with 3 tsp butter on 425. Take 2 cups of cornmeal 2 cups butter milk and about 1/4 cup of flour. Take the skillet out of the oven with melted butter, pour the butter into your cornmeal mixture and stir. Then pour it all back into the skillet and put it in the oven for 25-30 mins at 425. This will make a huge difference in the way it taste. I also use a roll of saltine crackers crushed and boiled eggs oh and thyme.

This is so close to my grandma's recipe. Her recipe calls for 8 cups of corn bread, and 4 cups of cubed white bread. My grandmother always added a tablespoon of parsley and used 4 well beaten eggs. I CRAVE this every year. Also, if you stir this periodically while its cooking it will be more fluffy than dense--maybe not as pretty, but it will have a better texture!

Amy, your grandmother most definitely knows how to cook.  God bless her.  I have tried 5 other cornbread dressing recipes during the past 6 months in hopes of finding "the one".  Was disappointed for one reason or another each time - until I tried this one by your dear grandmother.  A super hit!  As I reluctantly added the entire 2 T. sage, I was afraid it wouldn't be good.  Boy was I in for a thrilling surprise!  It was superb!  So easy and so simple to just follow this excellent recipe as written; however, I did take another reviewer's advice and mix the sage in with warmed chicken stock.  And, as per Jessica's 2007 review,  I did stir the stuffing 3 times in the oven (once every ten minutes) and oh my, the texture was just perfect and heavenly.  I used my own homemade cornbread recipe as we don't have Jiffy easily available here. Thank you so much for posting this, Amy.  Now I can finally relax at Christmas and Thanksgiving and not stress about "what if the dressing isn't any good".  Salt, pepper and sage.  Those are the only seasonings necessary.  Can't rave about this enough.  THANK YOU and God bless your dear grandmother ! ! !

This is the way I do my stuffing and have for years. The only difference is when I bake the cornbread I put the seasonings in it. I usually add more later but by letting the seasonings bake in the cornbread it really melds all the flavors together from the get go.

i love this dressing. reminds me of the dressing we had for the holidays back home. i added a little extra onion and celery because we love it. adding some chopped boiled egg is good also. great recipe.update: made this for family christmas gathering saturday.it turned out great. it was good way back when i made it the first time, but i tweaked it a bit and it was even better! i added about 1/2 to 3/4 tea spoon of sage. we like it "sage" but i think start with about 1/4 teaspoon and adjust to taste. 2 tb was a bit too much. also i added extra celery and onion. i added about 1/2 can more broth and per other cooks suggestions, i added a can of cream of chicken soup. ( i think cream of celery would be great too). as others have said if you don't want it to dry out make it pretty soupy and as it baked it will firm up just right.  i also added about a 1/4 teaspoon of marjoram and ground savory. and 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning. i think it all made a good difference. also taste as you go and adjust to your liking. this time i didnt add chopped  boiled eggs, but it is good either way. everyone loved it and i am definately cooking this for our Christmas dinner at home. NOTE: also it saves time to make the bread (i used martha white buttermilk cornbread mix) a day ahead and crumble it up and put in a big ziploc or container. and i chopped my onion and celery the night before and stored them in the fridge. makes things easier when you start cooking.

This recipe is a lot like the one my family uses (my grandmas).  Only the chicken stock they're asking for is from the chicken we boil, and shred up to put in the dressing. And we bake our corn bread in a cast iron skillet. Green onion is good in it also.

used martha whites corn bread and muffin mix (used 2 pkgs of 6 oz each) and only one egg--the results were great. My husband said this was the best dressing he had ever had.

In my version I used gluten-free cornbread (I have Celiac Disease) and I added 2.5 cups chicken broth. This is by far the best cornbread stuffing I've tried. It is going to be a new tradition at my holiday table!

This recipe is ok but it there are more ingredients that my granny used, like a little poultry seasoning, chopped livers, gizzards and the meat from the turkey neck. And because we didn't like dry food, sometime she would add a can of cream of chicken soup along with the stock from the boiled meat (liver, gizzards and the turkey meat), celery and onions.

2 tablespoons of sage is way too much for this recipe.  I used all of the cooked cornbread, which is more than the required 2 cups, and the sage was
totally overpowering.  I re-made it and only  used
1 teaspoon, and that was perfect.

The key to really great cornbread dressing is before you place in the oven to bake; make sure the dressing is soupy.  This will insure the dressing not to dry out.  I also use day old bread cut up in chunks and of course sage.

The cornbread was DELICIOUS, after making few modifications, however.  The amount of crumbled cornbread given in the directions is about half of what is prepared.  Not using the full amount results in soupy dressing prior to baking when all of the ingredients are incorporated.  Baking it at the time suggested left it soupy, and after an 1 1/2 hours of baking, it was creamy, which is what I'm not used to.  I found that using all of the crumbled cornbread gave the dressing more texture after it was baked.   Also, the amount of dried sage listed on the ingredients is way too much and would overpower the dish.  I suggest using 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out very tasty.  After I mixed all the ingredients and gave it just a little taste, it seem to be missing something else so I also added approximately 2 tablespoons of poultry seasoning and it turned out the way I like my dressing to taste.

Every year at Thanksgiving I called my mother for her cornbread dressing recipe.  This is the first year I won't be able to call her.  She told me the same thing year after year (I enjoyed the call, looked forward to it.)  I did a search and here it is!!!  This is identical to my mother's!  Thank you for posting!  It was always my favorite!

Call me the odd one out, but I did the recipe as is and I loved it. I've never made cornbread dressing and never grew up on it so I have nothing to compare it to, really. Not to dry...not to wet. I did add more sage because I love alot of sage in my stuffing. I made this with baked chicken breasts, gravy, and vegetables. A keeper!

I have never made dressing before until I saw this recipe on the website on Easter. Its a week after Easter and I have made it twice and it is gone the same day with only 5 people eating it and 3 of them are kids. I made by corn bread, cooked only celery, left out the eggs, added 1 tall can of cream of chicken and 1 small can of chicken broth and both times it was perfect. I dont know if people still read this website but this is an excellent recipe and I will continue to use it. Thanks a million.

UPDATE 2: Made this for a Christmas lunch for a crew of 15 hungry men. This is a keeper. I forgot to add eggs. But followed the recipe other. I did add a tad more celery, onions and added bell pepper. Yummmy!   
UPDATE: I made this for Thanksgiving. This was my first time hosting Thanksgiving for the family. We had 40 guests. Anyway, thanks to Grandma's Corn Bread Dressing recipe, mine dressing was the first big pan to run out. There was a smaller pan and it was only half-touched. Yum! I am thankful for the this dressing recipe this Thanksgiving! Will be making this for years to come. 

Good basic recipe overall, and I will be making more of this, and making some modifications to it.
I would add a little more celery and onions in the future. I added 3 eggs instead of 2. Be sure to chop the eggs small enough because if you don't, the rubbery texture is more pronounced than when the eggs are chopped into smaller chunks. :) And finally sprinkle more sage on the top before baking it because my bf loves sage. Have fun modifying it to suit your taste!!!

This came out great. I agree with Jeanne. Be careful of the liquid and use plenty Onions and Celery make the dressing. I also added chicken gizzards in mine.  I still remember growing up with the heavenly smell of celery and onions sauteing.   I knew it was a special day with those smells in my mother and both grandmother's home

This was very easy to make, although it came out a little dryer than I would have liked. Could have been my oven since I have a gas oven and it tends to cook a little faster than most... so I think I will try it again, but cook less time. Other than that, I thought it had a nice flavor and do intend on making it again. Thank you for the recipe.

Nobody I know uses a boxed mix because they contain sugar and that's a "sin" to a Southerner. I made my cornbread from scratch. It was pretty good, but too crumbly to me. Will use more broth and egg next time. Also add more celery.

This is an excellent recipe.  We made cornbread using cornmeal so we could determine how sweet or not sweet to make the cornbread.  I also changed the amount of sage used (I cut it to 1/2 of what the recipe calls for).  We also added stock slowly until the dressing reached the correct consistency that we wanted.  We did not use all the stock.  Thank you for the great recipes, it's a keeper!!

This tasted awesome. I used 2 boxes of the Jiffy cornbread mix and double the directions for the box and used a 8x8 pan to cook both boxes together. In the end I only used half of the cooked cornbread to equal 3 cups so not sure if you can just use an 8oz mix instead. Then I did use a 9x13 pan to cook the entire thing and thought it was thin in the end. So again for me if you want a thicker dressing maybe use a smaller pan and cook a bit longer. Other than these things and not sure if I did something wrong, this is a keeper. The flavor is fantastic, it's easy to make.

This is almost my family recipe. I mix my own cornbread with a package of dressing mix - not the cubed option.  For years I watched my mother put together her toasted bread and cornbread, but the prepared package of dressing mix allows skipping the labor part of the bread prep. Also, the package has the flavorings almost perfect to begin with. Gently allowing the celery and onion to soften in the butter is key here.  My mom finished off this recipe with milk to make it less dense. The aroma from the baked dressing brings them in from the football game, believe me!

I have lived my whole life in the South and this recipe is similar to the way my family has made cornbread dressing for generations.  We don't saute the onions and celery because they cook in the dressing.  We always use stock from the turkey, so be sure to put a little water in the pan where you roast the turkey or else make some homemade stock.  The canned stuff doesn't cut it.  Pour the stock, the amount depends on the amount of cornbread and biscuit you have.  I always add a few biscuits.  Crumble the cornbread fine. When the stock has soaked into the cornbread add the eggs, onions, and celery and then add buttermilk until the dressing makes a batter.  Put in some sage and wait a while and then taste.  Sage gets stronger when it sets.  Add some dryed basil,garlic, salt and black pepper,and refrigerate overnight.  Bake at 400 and baste with butter several times as the dressing cooks.  When you take it out of the refrigerator you might have to add some more liquid because it tends to soak in.

Delicious and easy!  Does well with modifications, too. This time I added about 3/4 cup of corn and a tablespoon of fresh thyme.  It was a hit - even my toddler loved it! Next time I'm thinking about cooking sausage with the onion and celery before adding it to the rest of the ingredients.

I love love love this recipe!  The only cautionary tale I have is that if you make it with brand new sage (not fresh, but a newly opened container of dried) it will come out quite green!!

Made this tonite..first time I've ever made dressing..I thought it was great. Followed the directions exactly as written. Dressing was a little more moist than I've eaten before, but I thought that was a plus. This is on my side dish list definately. Thanks for the recipe.

Yay!!!  My first attempt at making dressing for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE success!  My husband said that it was even better than his mom's...which is really hard to beat!  I was so nervous to make my very first Thanksgiving dinner, and thanks to this recipe, I'll never be afraid again!  It was phenomenal!

I have a recipe I have used for 35 years that is similar and uses poultry seasoning in place of the sage uses pepper but no salt. The broth usually has enough salt in it without extra. I am the only one in the family that does the dressing.

I used the Grandma's Cornbread recipe as my base, then followed the recipe with a few amendments.  I used Fit & Active chicken broth from Aldi, added 3 T of sage and made sure not to over mix.  Once I combined everything, I added one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of mushroom soup.  The result was the best dressing I ever made.  Normally my dressing gets stiff and you have to add milk to loosen it up for leftovers.  Not now.  The consistency was perfect.  Again, don't over mix it.  I lightly greased my dutch oven and baked it it the oven covered for 20 min, then uncovered for another 15.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Awesome dressing....delicious with simplicity. I'm used of doing a dressing adding seafood and meat; but sometimes you just want something different. I fixed it for Christmas 2010 with ham and smothered green beans and my family and I loved it. I fix it sometimes when it's not a holiday.I sometimes cook this dish and add real lump crab meat, and chicken meat. For chicken, I would boil chicken thighs with seasoning and break up;and add in dressing mixture.Then bake!!!!

This was very good and had wonderful flavor. I used onion powder though about 1/2 tsp and some dried celery about 2 T. I used packaged corn bread crumbs Pepperidge Farm brand. I left out the eggs. Great recipe, just like grandma always made. Thanks.

This was delicious! No changes necessary, excellent as is. I agree with other reviewers about making sure there's no sugar in your cornbread. It's not bad if it's got a little sweetness to it, but would be better without.

For the first time in my life I made cornbread dressing and I used this recipe. It was great. Everyone loved it. I adjusted the seasonings for my taste and it turned out great. I added the meat from boiled turkey necks and that sent it over the top!! thanks for a great recipe.

Yum! This was great. It had the sweetness I was looking for with the cornbread, and just the right amount of spice to counteract it. One thing I changed; for the first time, I used only one tablespoon of sage, since I didn't know how I would like it. It was perfect. Just use a little less like I did if you don't want it to overpower the other flavors like the onion and celery.

This is the recipe I use to make dressing. When I'm out of sage I use poultry seasoning. It works just as good. NEVER use Jiffy or any other cornbread mix that has sugar.

I was very curious about this recipe and amazed when I read it. This recipe has been in the Texas side of my family for over 75 years. Some may think the amount of sage is a little too much but for us the sage makes the difference. The only slight difference was my Grandmother would also add a few crumbled slices of stale white bread. Everything else is identical. This dressing is on my menu every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

I did use Jiffy and it turned out great.  I did not use the sage at all.  It was also helpful to let sit about 15 to set after taking out of oven.  It was even better the next day, so making a day ahead and rewarming it in the oven was perfect!

I have never made this before but I love the way it tastes! This was a fabulous recipe to use being a beginner! I added 1 1/2 cup more of celery, onion, red pepper. I also added more chicken broth to make it moist.  I added some smoked turkey meat as well to add a little meat flavor! The baking time was to short due to the added broth but it came out great! I recommend this to anyone!

I have been looking for a recipe that resembles my Grandmother's cornbread dressing for years.  My Grandmother never wrote recipes down and no one thought to get her dressing recipe from her.  This one was it!  I sat down on Thanksgiving and took one bite and actually said 'oh my god that's awesome!'.  Thank you so much for posting.  My whole family loved it and we are going to make this our standard dressing recipe from now on.

I have never made dressing from scratch but after reading these amazing reviews I decided to give this one a try. It was absolutely the very best cornbread dressing that I have ever had!!!!  Now I made some changes. I used 2 boxes of Jiffy and accidentally messed up the recipe, I added way to much milk and ended up adding more corn meal to it (I was following the pancake recipe on the box, oops*) it ended up cutting the sugar, to my delight. I used fresh Sage, added turkey meat, and I used a cup of turkey drippings

I love this recipe! I make it all the time for my 18 month old son and he loves it (so does the rest of the family). I usually add more veggies (carrots, zucchini, broccoli, whatever I have on hand), that way he's getting extra nutrients, then I cut it into squares and he can feed it to himself.  Thanks for a great recipe and for the inspiration to turn it into a KID FRIENDLY food.

I used Jiffy and mixed this too much and it got too soggy. My mother always said the stuffing was the toughest, which is why it's the best! I will have to try another recipe next Christmas :(

I've only made dressing once before and didn't like the results, but this recipe worked out very well for me.  I started by making a 9X13 pan of the Buttery Corn Bread from this site with all sugar except one tablespoon omitted (very important as it's normally very sweet) and let it sit covered on the counter for two days.  It yielded at least double the amount of cornbread I needed, so I doubled the liquid and increased the vegetables and seasoning to taste.  I also added a pound of crumbled sausage.  It made a very full 9X13 pan of dressing with the extra cornbread and sausage. I assembled it the day before Thanksgiving and refrigerated it overnight, then baked it in the morning. Due to the extra liquid I used, I bumped the temperature up to 400 and baked a few extra minutes to make everything meld and absorb.  Good texture and taste-- everyone liked it at Thanksgiving dinner, and I'd definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love cornbread dressing... I have made this for years except I bake my own cornbread a day or two before and I don't add the egg.  I can eat it before it's even baked and you can never get too much sage...mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I am a veteran cook and somehow I have never been the one to make stuffing.  I tried this for my very first attempt at making stuffing.  WOW!  Very simple and the receipe is great as is. Also, it is very easy to dress it up.  I discovered my husband like cranberries, apples and raisen's added.

I am sure that this was good for what it was supposed to be...just make sure you know what you want with this recipe.  I was looking for a great cornbread stuffing recipe.  I should have made the cornbread from scratch, but this had good reviews so I thought I would give it a try. Mine looked exactly like the picture.  The consistency was too soupy and mushy even after I cooked it extra.  Also it was too sweet for our tastes even though I used a very low sugar cornbread mix.

You have to make the cornbread bread using cornmeal and not jiffy mix.  it makes a difference. otherwise this stuffing was good and went well with cornish hens.

Excellent. This is the first time I have ever made homemade stuffing and this was exactly the way I imagined it tasting. Moist and full of flavor.

pretty darn good recipe.  I added roasted chicken and a few other seasonings which gave it a great flavor.  I wasn't crazy that it was more moist than I was planning, but I think that's just personal preference.

I really  thank you for this recipe. It was really good, I also added my touch on it by adding a little turkey stock along w/the chicken stock, bell peppers, and a few more seasonings. Was wonderful will be in my recipe box for years to come.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving, and doubled it.  We nicknamed it the sage casserole. :)  I think there may be a typo with the amount of sage to put in-maybe teaspoon, not tablespoon?  I will try it again with less sage and see how it goes...

We loved this! I forgot to add the sage but it was still excellent. We used leeks instead of onions due to allergies and I added 2 tbls of minced garlic. Made it fabulous.

very good base recipe, I only modified it a little. made my own cornbread, as a prev reviewer sugg, added 3/4C bell pepper, upped the celery to 3/4-1C. used 3C chicken broth and 1 can of Cream of chicken soup. used poultry seasoning 1 1/2tsp instead of sage. added eggs last in order to test my seasoning. Turned out super yummy and very quick to prepare.

This is the closest recipe I have found to the one my grandma made, but I made a few alterations to make it more like hers.  I used pan drippings and added some toasted white bread and chopped boiled eggs.  It was delicious! :)

I and my family LOVED this classic southern side dish recipe.  I have been searching for this exact recipe for a very long time, and I did use Jiffy Mix ( I wanted the sweeter version of a dressing like I remembred).
I used extra veggies including red and green peppers and used loads of sweet onion. I used the amount of sage the recipe called for and fresh ground black pepper.
This is a moist and flavorful dressing, and has already been added to my familys favorite recipe book. 
If you are looking for a  Corn Bread Dressing recipe, please try this one.

Very yummy! I made my own cornbread, and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (for the vegetarians in my family). Will definitely make again.

Wonderful.  Everyone loved it.  I cut down on the sage just a tad, as I'm a little less sage-friendly personally.  Stuffed the turkey, baked the rest separate, and came out great.  Moist, flavorful, and filling.

I didn't have sage, so I added thyme and garlic salt instead.  I prepared JIF corn bread mix with buttermilk (a little more than called for) and added canned corn and sauteed onions, green, yellow & red peppers, chopped up.  No celery.  Then I followed this recipe.  It was delicious - and I usually don't use anything boxed, but the JIF is more like a base for other corn bread recipes anyway...

This recipe is fantastic!! the only thing i do differently is when i make my cornbread i use 2 boxes of jiffy and instead of using the ingrediants i use 1/3 of the honey in the bear container and 16 oz of sour cream.. It makes it super moist and a little sweet.

Heavenly!!! My first attempt at dressing and what a success!! I had to resort to homemade cornbread (another first) and frozen stock as the stores were closed, so naturally it took a bit longer, but OMGoodness! I'm not a fan of dressing or stuffing and I couldn't stop snacking! Well done Amy's Grandma!! Thanks for sharing Amy!

Use FRESH sage!  I use a little less than 1/4 cup (coarsely chopped). When you saute the onions and celery, add the sage at the end and saute for another minute.  Fresh sage makes all the difference!  People who say they hate sage will love it.

I have not made dressing in over 6 years.  So I am rusty.  This was an ok recipe.  My husband liked it.  I liked it too, I am just searching for a more familiear childhood taste.  The search is on, but thanks for the stater recipe.  I plan to try other recipes similar to his at allrecipes.

Absolutely Delicious! This also freezes nicely, as I made it for just myself I had to test it out.  Just a note, the 3c of corn bread is essentially the whole thing.  I made the mistake of loosly crumbling the bread and had soup.  But mistake was easy to correct, crumbled in the rest of the pan and baked until done.  YUMMM!

I've made this each year for Thanksgiving for the past 3 years (at least) and for some reason this year, I realized that it is way too moist for me, that it takes away from the nostalgic dressing/stuffing from my childhood!  I think it tastes great, but the texture is off.  I think next year I will make more corn bread to add to the mix, as well as less chicken stock to make it "breadier."  

Overall, I love the taste!

I used jiffy instead of the non sweet corn bread. it was very good and was a hit at thanksgiving. I used about 4 cups of jiffy instead of 3 so it wouldn't be as runny.

My granny is very picky about dressing. Normally we purchase dressing from a restaurant on Thanksgiving, but I decided to make it this year. I followed the directions exactly except I had chicken broth rather than chicken stock. For cornbread I used the recipe on the back of a bag of cornmeal. I thought the recipe was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. Even granny approved.

I have been using this recipe for the last three years...I thought I would try something new this year but the whole family that I cook for said NO!! It is a hit for  our family and is still good when you accidently use sweet corn bread (ha ha...opps).

I made this recipe when I was in the States and I have to say it is absolutely delicious. Now that I'm back in France I have to make my own cornbread. How many cups of it do I need do make this good dressing ?

This was the first time I baked or ate cornbread dressing.  It didn't have too much flavor, but my husband liked it.

A confession: I am 54 years old, Southern, and had never made cornbread dressing before. LOL! I followed this recipe just as directed and it was perfect. Even better the second day as the flavors 'melded' together. It's the classic corn bread dressing I grew up with!

Made this for Christmas Eve- exactly following the directions.  Not one of the 10 of us liked it.  I will use a regular stuffing recipe next time. I am surprised it is rated so well.

Thanks to the reviewer who said to add cream of chicken soup to the dressing! I tried it once and it was good but my husband (trying to help) added way too much cornmeal! I tried it again with the alterations suggested (less broth and a can of cream of chicken soup) it was perfect! My dressing is now better than my grandmother's!!!

I added the sage in small increments after a few taste tests. I only used about 1 tbsp total. I added two cooked chicken breasts that were finely shredded. I used white cornbread and left the eggs out of the final mixture. Not to re-create the recipe, but I did use this as a go-by since it was my first attempt! Worked very well and the family raved about it for days! Next time I will double or triple the recipe and hope for left-overs!

This recipe is 100% kid-approved!! :-)I am still amazed that my daughter ate at least five helpings of this dressing. My little picky eater told me that I need to make this more often. That makes a mother proud.    The only thing I am going to do differently next time is use less sage. I had read comments about the sage usage but I didn't clearly understand until I actually tasted it. It is a bit strong. I don't want it to overpower the celery and onion.     Oh, and another thing I did was use Vegetable broth instead of chicken broth since I am vegetarian. I was kind of worried that it wouldn't taste good but it was delicious.     Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This is a great starter recipe.  However like a few other reviews said it calls for way too much sage. I doubled everything but the sage.  After reading some reviews I didnt want it to be too much.  However, even then the sage overpowered everything else.  I gave this a 4 because I had to do some major work covering up the sage in order to make it palatable.  Otherwise, its a nice recipe.

Very good. I needed a dressing recipe after I found out that my bread had molded. I found this one and now I'm kind of glad my other plan didn't work out. Very tasty. I did use more celery than was called for but I like my stuffing with extra veggies. Will make this again. Thanks!

I've made a few attempts at this childhood favorite in the past few years and this is very good and extremely close.  I literally smelled my childhood kitchen while I making this.  I used Martha White's cornbread as the base for this.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup, gave up the eggs and added broth til I reached the right consistency.  This was a must when my mom made it.  At this rate...I'll feel confident enough to take the dressing to our next holiday potluck!  Be mindful when making this, what consistency are you looking for in your dressing.  Maybe you'd like to add more or less liquid.  I don't like dressing so thick it needs to can be cut into cubes.  I don't think the dressing should be that thick, a spoon should easily go through it.

Way too much liquid in this recipe.  It took forever for the liquid to cook out, leaving a very dense dressing.  Tasted fine, but sure didn't want to serve it to guests.  Might be better to add cracker crumbs or bread crumbs to the cornbread mixture.  Time to call my grandmother for her recipe - will not use this one again.

I was looking for a recipe like my grandma's, and this is def it!! I loved it! I haven't been home for Thanksgiving in a few years and was excited to try this out on my boyfriends family this Thanksgiving. Big hit, everyone loved it, esp me! The only diff is my grandma puts in it chopped up boiled eggs. Yumm!

This is a good basic recipe; but I tweaked as well to my liking adding 1 can of cream of celery soup and 1 tea. poultry seasoning as others suggested.  Cut back on one package of corn bread mix, sage, and only used 1 can of chicken broth and used a cake pan to bake. Next time will cook 10-15 minutes longer though then original recipe instructs b/c of modifications (denser). Tried to make using another recipe before, but now I definitely have a keeper.

This is a great recipe! I doubled the recipe, as I feed a crew of hungry guys. I added a can of cream of celery soup, a little extra sage, garlic powder and shredded turkey, I also added more broth, per other reviews. I'll definitely be making this one again! Thanks for sharing.

This was a great cornbread. I don't even like cornbread and I liked this. I used hushpuppy mix and prepared it like the recipe said, then baked it like bread. I left it uncovered overnight. I did the recipe exactly and it was a hit! No leftovers and I cooked for an international group. They all said they loved it.

I really loved the flavor of this recipe! I have never used eggs in my dressing and have always been curious as to the texture. I think that I prefer my dressing without eggs, but this is an excellent recipe and I have to give it 5 stars because although the texture isn't what I would have liked it to be, that's an issue of personal preference. Thank you Amy! Very yummy!

This was a good dressing recipe. I will make this again but will cut the sage in half. The flavor was pretty strong with an aftertaste, but the texture was great. I can't wait to try this again.

I used my own cornbread instead of that out of the box (see Amusement Cornbread).  I also did not add any salt to the recipe, which it probably needed to taste a bit better for me.  Next time, I would definitely reduce the amount of sage used - it was the overwhelming flavor.

Very good. I omitted the celery. I used two 7.5 ounce packages of  cornbread mix and probably only needed one. I also might make it in a smaller pan next time for thicker dressing.

I used this as a jumping-off point and made a few changes. My grandma used to make a very similar recipe and I've been trying over the last few years to recreate it. 

I used Aunt Jemima corn meal with the "golden corn bread" recipe on the package. Of the whole pan, I used about 3/4. 
I boiled 4 chicken thighs, shredded the meat after it had cooled, and added it to the recipe. We've always had chicken in our dressing, but I might try a different meat at a non-holiday gathering. 
No sage. I'm not experienced with sage and I know my grandma never used it. Maybe it works for someone else, but I just didn't want it. 
I added a couple slices of bread, crumbled, and more broth. I think my grandmother also uses a can of biscuits but I figured that would just be too much bread for me. I had to up the baking time, it may have been as much as an hour total. 

Overall, this particular recipe is a solid average before changes are made. Being such a simple recipe, it's easy to experiment and improve.

It's the best I have ever found for a recipe!  My family and our guests all loved it and went back for seconds and thirds.  I substituted the chicken stock with pan drippings from my turkey, added fresh garlic to the onion and celery as it cooked, and used a sweet cornbread recipe for the cornbread portion of this recipe.  It's awesome!  Thank you for posting it.  I won't use any other recipe for dressing!

Excellent, and easy recipe! I say "easy" because I'm no cook.  And I've never made cornbread dressing before trying this one!  Success!!! The family loved it!  Before I tried it, I read the comments of the other "real" cooks who explained some things that I would not have known without their valuable information!  Thanks for the recipe! And thanks for the tips!

This is almost the recipe I use, except I make two batches of homemade cornbread in my cast iron skillet. I mince the celery and onion instead of chopping it, and I do like my Granny always did, add in a can of cream of chicken soup! After you crumble the cornbread then add in the butter/veggies (I use one stick butter.) add the can of soup, the the chicken stock. After mixing, the mixture should look almost like pancake batter. If it's not really wet, you'll have dry dressing.

That is way too much sage. I have made this recipe for years and never use over 1/2 teaspoon or it is overwhelming. I do use the dried, rubbed sage.

I have made this recipe for over 40 years and I'm so glad to see it called DRESSING and not stuffing. I always buy new sage each year because dried varieties can lose their flavor. Be careful how much you put in as it can become stonger with cooking.I put lots of chicken stock so it won't dry out with cooking and always make my cornbread from scratch. I add about 10 cooked bisquits torn into small pieces for better texture. Make it a day ahead and refrigerate so you can just pop it in the oven when the turkey is almost ready. Delicious!

I agree with Cranrecipes... The recipe calls for way too much Sage. I will only use 1 tablepoon next time. Also the dish was too big. I will use a square pan in the future or double the recipe when using a 9x13. One other thing. The recipe says to use a 16 ounce package of cornbread mix. They usually come in 6 ounces. I made two bags and only needed half the cornbread, so 1- 6 ounce bag would have been plenty. Maybe that was a typo along with the dish size.

I like this recipe because it is easy to tweak. I have gluten free people in my family. So I make gluten free corn bread mix and add thyme, sage, salt and pepper to the corn bread. I also use fresh herbs instead of dried to give it more color, but you need more. My family loves it and appreciate the efforts to accommodate their dietary needs!

Loved It!  My modification:  accidentally bought veg broth  and went ahead & used it.  Added 4 slices of bread crumbled and a bit more broth just to make it a soupy texture (before putting in oven), as we like our dressing more moist than dry. Tasted just like my mom & grandmas recipe! The whole family LOVED it !!

I used buttermilk corn bread mix which I baked it in a 9 inch cast iron skillet the day before.  This amount worked well when I made the dressing the next day in a 9x13 baking dish.  I also added 1/2 pound of browned crumbled breakfast sausage.  Very nice dish.

This turned out great.  Made it for Thanksgiving and it got raved reviews.  I chopped the celery and onions very fine and cooked them well.  Also I used 1 teaspoon of ground sage.  As for the corn bread, I used 2 boxes of jiffy and added 1 tablespoon of sugar.  I baked it the night before.  I used most of the corn bread to make the dressing.  Use one can of chicken broth with between 1/4 & 1/2 cup of water.  It will turn out great!

I have to say I was not a big fan of this dish. I don't know what happened but it didn't turn out good. I needed an allergy friendly recipe for Thanksgiving so I used a homemade cornbread mix (that turned out great.) I also added a diced carrot with the onion and celery. I will not be making this again.

I like my dressing a little brick-ier and less crumbly. Next time I'll add more egg and broth for a wetter batter, but this is a wonderful recipe and tastes just like what I ate as a kid in Texas. Thank you!

Who needs a box mix?  I made a batch of Better Homes and Gardens' 'Perfect Cornbread' and used it.  This was delicious dressing!  I never liked dressing until I had cornbread dressing.  However, I needed the whole pan of bread, not just 3 c. crumbs.  Also, I think I used more celery than called for, and I skipped the saute step.  Further, I suppose I can't actually rate this because the seasoning really makes a dish and I didn't have any sage to use.  So actually my 4-star rating is for my rosemary/thyme/garlic-flavored cornbread dressing.  =) Oops.  I forgot to mention that this was the first time I made dressing and it was super easy--way easier than I expected!

This is a GREAT and easy recipe.  I followed the directions to spec.  I also modified it for my husband who needs wheat free, gluten free and dairy free foods. I substitued Bob's Red Mill Cornbread mix and made it.  I use egg whites no yolk because he is allergic to the yolk. I didn't use any butter.  He loved his version too.

I made a few modifications. First I made corn bread with condenced milk using the tradional corn bread recipe on Aunt Jemima'a recpie, I also added a can of cream corn into the mix. After I sauted the onions and celery, I added in almonds and walnuts to give it an extra boost. I also added in about a pinch or two of rubbed sage and half a cup or so of minced garlic. After the corn bread was cooled I cut the bottom off (it was a little burnt) and crumbled it all up. Because of the cream corn in the corn bread, it didn't require as much chicken stock. It is very important to make sure the consistency of the stuffing is the consistency of malt-o-mill. I baked it all on 350 for several hours so that it baked from the inside out. VERY GOOD Recipe!

I used 3/4 cup chopped celery and 3/4 cup chopped green peppers.  I only used 1 tbsp of sage.  I believe 2 tbsp would have been too much.  I had to add about 12 more ounces of chicken stock to keep it from being too dry.  Overall, the original was a good start to make it how you want it.

Taste was ok, but this turned out mushy and nothing like what I wanted. Perhaps homemade cornbread would be better (I used a mix). I will not make this again.

This was good and turned out the first time I made it.  It was actually better left over.  Next time I will use a smaller dish, it was quite thin.

This was good, a little soupy and had to be cooked for over an hour but turned out well.  Watch your sage. Go tsp by tsp and taste. My youngest was assisting and dumped a bunch of sage in and we had to double the recipe to salvage the food.

I rate this 4 stars as-is. I've tweaked this to make it 5 stars and work for us in a 9x13 size. I double the portions (Be sure to have about 7 cups of bread. If not enough cornbread from 2 packages; add 1 cup plain bread crumbs to make a total of 7 cups of bread), add 1 lb cooked, crumbled regular sausage, 2 boiled eggs (minced), and I make it 2 days ahead. I cook the day of the event. Be sure to use rubbed sage. Salt and pepper to taste (I used about 1-1.5 tsp each) This is a great recipe.

This was a huge hit in my household.  I omitted the onion and celery, but added a can of cream of celery soup.  I thought the amount of sage was perfect.

I made this dressing to go with my Thanksgiving dinner. It was a HUGE hit!! I definetly plane on making it every year now. Although by the time I got to the store all the cornbread mix that they had left was jiffy, so I used that. And personally I thought the small amount of sugar that's in the mix was perfect for the stuffing. I do however plan on trying it with the dry corn bread as soon as my local grocery store refil the shelves.

Never made corn bread dressing (always bread based) but DH wished to have it with the turkey yesterday! He was right (for once) :)  This was delicious and turned out perfect, but decreased the sage as others stated...definitely a keeper!

Must say I did a lot of changes but it tasted great. Used more celery and onion and added 1/3 of a red and a green bell pepper and a can of cream of chicken soup to the rest of the ingredients. Adjusted the stock to keep the right consistancy. And cut way back on the sage to around 1-2 tsp. Used a smaller pan also.   Maybe a 9x9.

I loved the flavor of the stuffing. The only thing is need to add about .5 to 1 c more of corn bread. And don't forget to add your own lawry's seasoning.

Perfect recipe to recreate my grandma's dressing. My husband, who has never had cornbread dressing before, loved it and so did my 2 year old. I added fennel and carrots diced finely as well and the flavor and texture was awesome.

I made this yesterday for our Christmas dinner and it was wonderful. I too like the sweeter cornbread so I used Jiffy. I also boiled some eggs and cut them up to put in there. I didn't use quite as much sage and it came out perfectly. We have leftovers and my husband and I can't wait to eat them for lunch!

I made this today for Christmas and it was very good. My step-daughter went nuts over it. She's never had anything but Stove Top in her family so this was totally new to her. She LOVED it! I grew up on cornbread dressing but I had dinner at my house and my mom usually makes the dressing so I told her I would do it this year but I wanted to make it a little different than hers. My daughter and I like Jiffy cornbread mix, so I used that instead. I used 2 boxes and all of it and doubled everything that was called for except the sage . I used 1 1/2 tbsps instead of 2. I don't like it TOO sagey but I do like some sage flavor. I also added shredded chcken that I boiled which made it delicious! I bought my chicken stock instead of making it myself and it was just fine and a lot easier! I've got another Christmas dinner Sat. night and will be making it again! Try this recipe! I promise you won't be disappointed!

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving this year because I was at my sister's and didn't have access to my recipes and it turned out amazing. I always cook my dressing in the crock pot to keep the oven open for other things and it did just as well as my own crock pot recipe. Thanks!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out just like my grandmother's. I doubled the recipe but not the sage, taking advice from the other reviewers, and it was delicious served with giblet gravy.

Tip for leftovers: I cut the rest up in chunky squares, refrigerated a few days, then reheated in the oven after pouring melted butter overe the top . I served it in bowls with chili instead of rice and everyone loved it.

This was gone so fast I couldn't believe it.  I thought it had gotten lost, but it was just eaten all up.  I wasn't sure this sounded good, but it is great.  I like traditional stuffing but other members of my family don't.  I would eat this any day though it is easy and very yummy.

I really loved this.  I used the Jiffy mix because I too like a sweeter corn bread.  I wilted the onions and celery, but when I saw how much cornbread I had (I used 2 boxes) I chopped more and put in raw.  I used turkey broth and pan drippings instead of the chicken broth.  I have been trying to find the cornbread dressing of my youth, and I think I found it!

This dressing was wonderful! I normally don't eat dressing but I even like this recipe. I added about 3/4 a package of cooked sausage, which gave it nice flavor and only used about 2 teaspoons of sage(not a big fan of sage). Everyone wanted the recipe...this is definitely a keeper!

This was very good.  It was light and tasty.  I added crumbled Jimmy Dean sausage and green peppers.  I'd definitely make this again.
UPDATE: Original review was on this same date in 2008, my anniversary coincidentally!  9 years later this dressing is still a hit with my family. Sometimes I use stone ground cornmeal (in the bags) for the cornbread, over cook it (not burned) and make ahead of time and dried out. I add shredded turkey neck meat and giblets.  Some of us like oysters in it too.  Just don't over mix it or it will be a leaden gummy mess.

This is very similar to the recipe my family would often make when I was growing up - very good!

Note:  How much sage to add is definitely a personal preference.  I'm one of those that love it, so I add even more than this recipe calls for.  

I also add cream of celery, cream of mushroom and cream of chicken.  (half a can of each) I eyeball how much broth I add afterwards as a result.

I don't mind my dressing being more dense than fluffy, so over-stirring isn't an issue.  

I also love using sweet cornbread!  It isn't the "traditional" southern way to do it, but this very southern gal loves the variation.

This recipe turned out really well. i used it for the first time on Thanksgiving 2007. Before, dressing in my home was awful.  I will continue to use this recipe!!

I love this recipe - and I used Jiffy mix and it turned out great.  My husband doesn't like sage and I don't like celery, so I eliminated these and it still turned out fantastic.  I used dried onions instead of fresh (the kind you get in the spice aisle) - I find this gives great flavor without the soggy onion bits.  I used one can (2cups) of chicken broth, but wish I would have used a bit more - I like my stuffing moist.  This is a keeper~!

The only thing I do different is mix my cornmeal and buttermilk to make a batter. Instead of making cornbread, I fry them like fritters or pancakes, then I crumble and followed with directions, adding some of the giblets also, and extra sage. Oh I also addd green bell pepper.

I have tried for years to find a dressing recipe worthy of making on Thanksgiving. Finally I have found one. I added an extra half cup of stock and made sure I used a cornbread mix without sugar and it came out really great. It was gone before I knew it. I should have doubled the recipe!!

I did use Jiffy Muffin Mix and I also doubled the recipe.  I kept the sage to 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I remember hearing my grandmother's voice saying, " be careful of using too much sage" (she was a great cook).  All 14 people ate the Dressing and declared it a winner.  It wasn't dry at all!  It is a recipe to keep and pass down.

Great for stuffing or dressing.  I didn't use as much sage as the recipe called for, simply because that's a personal preference.  Too much sage can have a lemony taste, also.  Overall, the flavors and consistency were great.  This is one recipe you can make to fit your tastes.  It's a great base for more ideas!

I thought this was rather bland and nowhere as good as the Joy of Cooking regular bread stuffing I've done, but my husband, his mother, and his sister all preferred it.  I guess it's just a matter of different tastes.

i made this without onion, since i can't handle them, vegetable broth, and added green bell pepper. as per other reviewers, do not use a conbread mix with sugar in it (or make your own cornbread to avoid the chance; besides, it's fun)! also, use broth that's low sodium or omit the added salt. my husband loved this so much i made it again for him 2 days later. this is a great dressing recipe!

I followed this recipe almost exactly. I didn't have sage so I used poultyr seasoning. I used Marie Callanders corn bread mix and it is way too sweet for stuffing. The flovor was great except for the sweetness. I will try it again but using a different cornbread mix or making it from scratch with no sugar.

Great recipe. Made it for thanksgiving. I used Mother Lillys I would say stay away from that sweet packaged stuff. True southern cornbread stuffing isn‚Äôt sweet. Doubled the recipe but didn‚Äôt use nearly as much sage as this recipe called for. You don‚Äôt need much sage at all as it it very strong! Baked this the night before and reheated it in the oven right before dinner. I used more chicken starch to keep it moist. Family loved it. I might try adding sausage next year though.

read the recipe carefully. I made the mistake of looking and seeing one box of cornbread. one box was not enough it was 2 boxes so it didn't look so soupy when I followed it. I actually had to cook it longer too. however it is easy and great!

This is a pretty decent recipe although like the rest of you true southern ladies I tweaked a few things. First of all, the cornbread IS important and making it from scratch is really simple. Authentic southern cornbread contains neither flour nor sugar. We're not making cake. Lol
Like another poster, I agree adding more celery to the recipe and a LOT LESS sage. This recipe calls for 2 tablespoons and I'd probably add only 1 teaspoon, if that. 
Another item I'd add is a can of cream of celery, and also agree the batter shouldn't be too wet because your finished product will end up hard. Dressing should be fluffy and light. 
If you don't have actual turkey or chicken dripping, add a tiny pinch of poultry seasoning to your chicken broth. 
I LOVE reading all your tips!!! Thank you for your input.

It‚Äôs good!  Mine was kind of crumbly on top and more firm on the bottom.  Next time Id add a tad more than a can of broth.  Also, I did add about a 1/2 table spoon of poultry seasoning.

I love this recipe! I was wondering if this could be made the day before and cooked on Thanksgiving day? or Would it dry out in the frig?

Excellent! I used a 6 oz pkg of Martha white cornbread mix, it made a little shy of 3 cups so I used it all. I did cook the cornbread the day before and let it set out and dry a little. I also used rubbed sage and this is the closet recipe I‚Äôve found to my nanas. It turned out perfect. Enjoy!

So simple, yet so tasty! I made this with Marie Callender's cornbread mix so it's sweet and savory at the same time. It's exactly the taste I was going for! One suggestion to make mixing it up easier for you: beat the eggs in a separate bowl, then mix in the chicken broth with them, then pour the mixture over the cornbread and smush it together with your hands.

Don't add too much liquid and don't stir much. I put the cooked onions and celery in a Magic Bullet and blended them a little before adding to dressing. I also added Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning and less salt.Be sure to taste before adding eggs! I love this recipe as it is so similar to my Mother's!!!

This tastes just like my mother's dressing (which is the best).  First time I made it found sage was too much.  I now use 1/2 the sage called for in the recipe.

This was the best dressing I've ever made! The only small thing I did differently is add more broth to keep it moist. I hate dry stiff dressing. The celery gave it that nice crunch, the onions added the perfect flavor.It was wonderful with cranberry sauce, especially, the sauce with the whole berries in it.  My family didn't leave any in the dish. I will make this dish for Christmas as well. I can't wait!!

Good recipe, but I had to modify it a little. I bought the 32 oz  pkg Aunt Jemima Buttermilk Corn Meal Mix and used half to cook the corn bread. Then, instead of using only 3 cups of crumbled cornbread as stated in the recipe, I used all the corn bread, 3 eggs instead of 2, 3 cups of chicken stock instead of 2, and only 1 teaspoon of ground sage since it is very strong.  My husband and I loved it!

I used this recipe to make a gluten free version for myself. The cornbread mix I use is Bob's Redmill gluten free cornbread mix. I followed this recipe to a "T" and it turned out fantastic! Everyone ate my dressing, and asked if I'd bring it again. :)

It probably would have been better if I hadn't taken the advice of other reviewers and decreased the chicken broth. Mine came out very dry. The taste was OK, just not something I was looking for in a dressing.

This seems like a pretty generic recipe for cornbread dressing. I am looking for that homemade cornbread dressing. I believe this recipe lacked a certain element that would have added that flavor that I am looking for.

I think this is a great recipe for a beginner!!!  I only used the same ingredients, in the same amounts.  I only added the sage to the cornbread ( a suggestion from a friend.   I added turkey necks ( something my family always did).  I boiled the necks, with salt and pepper.  Instead of chicken stock (Oh I guess I did change something), I used the broth from the Turkey.  I took the meat off the bones, and just added it for taste.  My first time making dressing.  It came out moist  and delicious.

Tasty, but pasty! I must have done something wrong. This never set up. After 30 minutes of cooking it was still soupy. After 2 1/2 hours it was still pasty. The flavor was quite good, but since I have no idea what I did wrong, I won't make it again. Looking for another recipe!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious!  I did use the Jiffy brand corn muffin mix, but made 2 boxes of that instead of one.  Increased the celery/onions to about 1 1/2 cups total.  Used 3 eggs and cut back on the sage to 1 teaspoon.  Used approx. 3 cups of chicken stock.  Turned out great and everyone loved it!  Will definitely make this recipe again!

Used this recipe this year. Made my cornbread with stone ground corn meal and no sugar. No changes other than seasoning to taste.. and it turned out perfectly. Thanks for sharing!  This was exactly the taste of dressing from my childhood!

This is an excellent recipe for a small get together.  I added a little more sage,a cup of shredded chicken breast, the rest of the corn bread, and an additional quarter cup broth.

I did not like it for the fact that it is too dry and has too much sage, so what I did was added bell peppers in my saut√© or if you do not like to cut up fresh veggies you can just buy the seasoning blend bag in your grocery store freezer and I used 1 box of Jiffy mix and then I use the same box and measured my white corn meal to cut the sugar from the Jiffy. As an added bonus, I add 1 box of stove top to my cornbread mixture and I add broth from boiling chicken thighs or leg quarters ( any other meat causes dryness)...I do not use eggs at all. Because the Stove top has seasoning in it, I don't added any salt and pepper but I do sprinkle poultry and sage seasoning on the top of the mixture and then mix in. I also add a can of milk. For added broth if it is too stiff I add chicken broth. I have made this dressing for three years and every year someone wants me to make them a pan or give them the recipe. I think I will post it soon.

Cornbread dressing has been in my family for generations. The only difference in ours is that they would boil a chicken breast and chop it real fine and mix it in. They would also add a little bet of poultry seasoning too. I fix it every year too.

We make Corn Bread stuffing all the time.  I make it the same way as the recipe states, the only difference is that I use Jiffy CB mix and I haven't tried it with sage.  I think I will add sage to see what it taste like.

I have made what is essentially a version of this for about 40 years versus my mothers bread and giblet dressing. I do however usually add southern style smoked sausage run through a food processor or chopped fine (about 1 to 1 1/2 # for a recipe this size) and would often add a half pint of oysters with juice to the food processor (or diced fine)to enhance flavor. I stuff the bird which makes for a richer and moister dressing and pan up what won't fit in the bird to cook for the last half hour.

My family has been making this recipe for decades.  We have modified it some throughout the years.  We use at least two whole corn breads (We usually have 5 or more people and we like having leftovers).  We do not add all the sage at once. You can add some, taste it after mixing it in, and then add more if needed.  Sometimes if we are in a hurry, instead of adding spices, we will add a bag of Pepperidge farms dressing corn bread bag.  They are full of great spices and it goes along very well with the rest of the ingredients in this recipe.  It also adds more texture.  It's a hit every year.

This is a really great recipe.  My family is from the South and this is the only way we make cornbread dressisng.  My mom however never used boxed cornbread mix.  Our cornbread was always made from "scratch".  You can also add chopped mushrooms, a can of cream of mushroom soup and some cooked porked sausage, crumbled into the mixture.  It's great!!

This wasn't my mama's recipe, but it came really close.  I had to cook it a little longer than the recipe requires because it was really wet after only 30 min in the oven.  Mama always put the turkey gizzards in her dressing, but my hubby forgot to remove them before putting the bird on the grill, so I had to improvise and I used spicy ground sausage.  I'll definitely make it again, but I'll use less sage if I decide to put sausage in it again.  In short, I wasn't home for the holidays, but I didn't mind.  Loved it!

Used vegetable broth due to being vegetarian. Only other difference I made was that I used one tablespoon of poultry seasoning, no sage, and it was perfect! Went ahead and used Jiffy mix, two boxes, and it was great. So happy to finally have found an excellent stuffing without meat.

I loved this recipe and so did my family!!!! I did make some modifications such as adding bacon in while I cooked the celery and onion. and I too used the whole box of jiffy!
Will be making this again this year! 
I forgot to update last year (2011) when I made it for the 1st time.

It was really good.  I did use Jiffy mix. It was still good, but would have been better with corn meal without sugar.  I used one tbsp more of sage and that really added to it.  I also put a little bit more chicken stock in it and it had an awesome texture to it.  Great recipe.

I made my cornbread broke it up adding some chicken broth left over from a chicken I'd baked.  It'd been so long since I'd done dressing I'd forgotten the next step.   Well I searched the internet and was so grateful to find this recipe identical to what I'd done in the past minuse the SAGE and salt and pepper :)  Well I mixed in 4 or 5 eggs poured the turkey broth from the turkey and and sauteed the celery and onions.he dressing was a GREAT SUCCESS!!!! Thank you so MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe is similar to the one I use.  But it's definitely much tastier if you add meat such as turkey or pork sausage seasoned with sage, thyme, and etc.  To make the seasoning part a cinch just use Bell Seasoning.  This recipe is so delicious, I guarantee you will have them all coming back for more.

This is very similar to what I make every year.  I use cornbread with little to no sugar.  I also add seasoned bread crumbs I make a few days before.  I add seasoned turkey meat or sausage, chopped boiled eggs.  I don't measure my seasonings but season liberally.  It always is a huge hit at every gathering I have taken it to.

Pretty good stuff... I used whole wheat flour in my cornbread dressing.  I also added some seasoned breadcrumbs and mustard to the mix of things.  YUM.  I'm experimenting with my dressing leftovers in meatloaf mix.. can't wait.  thanks

My sister and I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it is incredible! It's not dry at all and is very flavorful. We skipped the sage because our parents don't like it but even w/out it the flavor is perfect :)

I make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas..the only difference is that I boil my eggs and chop them up and place them in the dressing mix along with condensed milk.  I bit of poultry seasoning along with the sage, salt and pepper.

I made a few changes. I used Pepperidge farm cornbread mix‚Äî 3 cups and Pepperidge farm white bread mix- 5 cups.  You don‚Äôt need to cook it beforehand.  Just go ahead and follow the directions for adding spices and chicken broth and cook per recipe. This has never let me down and I get rave reviews from those I prepare it for

This was really good and since I had no dried sage (go figure)... I substituted with poultry seasoning and it turned well..I will also the suggestion by another reader about the right kind of corn bread and learning the constancy was very helpful for anyone new to cooking cornbread stuffing...thank you for sharing

This has been the base for my dressing for many years.  As the family has grown, the recipe has doubled and then some.  We also enjoy sausage and sauteed mushrooms thrown into the mix.

Very good base recipe for a beginner. First Thanksgiving with me doing ALL the cooking. No family visiting to help or teach me the recipes. Used this recipe in addition to adding a few things my family included in their recipe and its delicious! Taste just like my family‚Äôs recipe. Used all the cornbread made, added 1 cup of the veggies, a cup of chopped bell pepper, 1 can of cream of chicken, cream of celery, and cream of mushroom, boiled a turkey leg & wing in chicken broth and used 2 cups of that juice and the leg & wing shredded w/o the skin.

I thought this recipe was lost after my mom passed away. I was so glad I found this!! This is the same stuffing my great-grandmother, grandmother and mother made. Now, thanks to Amy and All Recipes I will get to serve the same delicious stuffing at my holiday table. I've made this for the last 4 Thanksgivings and Christmases and it's a hit every time. Thank you for bringing this tasty bit of nostalgia back to my holidays.

Made as called, but added this to a box of chicken stuffing using the chicken broth in place of the water in the box stuffing directions. Also, had leftover corn muffins from dinner the other night that I used. When I had made them the other night I had added shredded cheddar cheese, cream style corn and jalapenos to the muffins. It worked great in this recipe! It was a hit with the whole family! Would

What a fantastic dressing recipe!  I doubled the recipe and used a bit less than the called for chicken broth amount, but everything else (including the sage) exactly as written.  I cooked at 375 (due to other things in the oven) for about 45 minutes.  Not sure why it was so much longer than the recipe, but it turned out great!  Was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving meal!

This is an awesome dish, it came out moist, like cake style. I cooked my celery and onions with the cornbread, for faster prep and it turned out great. Will make this again. It is very similar to my Mothers.

This was my first shot at dressing and I was very nervous about it coming out just right. I love this recipe. I added turkey to the recipe. I also had to cook it longer than recommended to get the moisture out and set the dressing properly. I increased the serving size, so that had something to do with the cooking time, I‚Äôm sure.

I am so pleased with the way this recipe turned out! I finally made delicious dressing that tasted just like my mother‚Äôs, who is now unable to make it for our Thanksgiving meals. I doubled the recipe exactly as written, with the exception of the sage (I used rubbed sage as my mother always has and the doubled amount looked like more than I‚Äôd ever seen her use. I didn‚Äôt want the sage taste to be too strong). I also added one piece of white bread to the mix, but everything else just the same as the recipe. I used (3) Martha White cornbread mixes in the white packages, and ended up having a little bit of cornbread left over. And since I doubled the recipe, I baked my dressing for 45 minutes instead of the 30 called for in the recipe. I actually took this out of the oven an hour before we were ready to eat, covered it with foil and placed a couple of potholders over the foil. It was still piping hot when we sat down to eat! Again, my dressing was wonderful and I will definitely be making this recipe again!

The measurements are all off on this recipe. I was following it exactly, I added 2 tablespoons sage, I knew it would be too much. I had some sense when I got to the chicken stock, I only added 1 cup, 2 would have made it very soupy. Then the pan, was too big. I should have listened to my I instincts and made adjustments while putting this together. Very disappointed.

I made this using my favorite cornbread recipe. The recipe does not give a cup measurement for the cornbread but the video does state  that 3 cups were used from the packaged cornbread mix so I doubled the recipe and increased other ingredients as well (did not double the chicken stock, used about 4 cups. Flavor is great and recipe is easy as stated. I premixed everything except dry ingredients the night before. I will make this again

Very good dressing. Can it be made ahead of time and frozen? I need about 6 pans made. If so, how would it be reheated?

Made as the recipe called for. Taste was a little soft on the sage side. But it is a great place to start at. 
Next time, I would increase oven temp to 400 and bake for 30-35 minutes. That would give a nice crust to the top of it.

This was good BUT I changed a LOT about this recipe. 
For starters, I made my own cornbread, simply because I wanted to make this and I had the things to make my own cornbread and not a packaged cornbread. Like others have said, it makes a lot of cornbread and they only ask you to use 3 cups of it. I used all of the cornbread, but I found I didn't need to double the eggs or broth. 
For the broth, I used chicken bone broth. Bone broth is stock (which is bones and ligaments cooked in water for 2-4 hours), but cooked A LOT longer than stock (12-48 hours) so it's a lot more flavorful -  I would highly recommend using this. A normal broth is just leftover meat, veggies, and water cooked for 45 minutes to 2 hours so it's not nearly as flavorful as a stock or bone broth. So, if you want this to be super flavorful I would recommend using chicken bone broth - it's more flavorful and cost just as much as normal broth and stock. 
The other thing I did differently is cooked my herbs (I used rubbed sage, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper) with my onions in celery. When you do this it gets the herbs toasted and releases more of their flavors. I also did NOT use 2 tablespoons of sage- that is entirely too much. I used about a tablespoon of sage, oregano, and thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper. 
I think if I didn't do all of this it would have turned out bland and too mushy. If it was perfect with well over 3 cups of cornbread then I can only imagine how mushy it was with just 3 cups of it.

Made this for my very first Thanksgiving Dinner at our home, was a hit and has been asked for at Thanksgiving dinner every year. I omit the celery for texture reasons and I‚Äôve never heard any complaints over the last 15 years. I now prep everything the night before so all I have to do is pop it in the oven when I‚Äôm ready.

I normally have a couple of go-to dressing recipes, but thought I‚Äôd try a different one for Christmas.  I wanted a simpler one with good reviews, which is why I tried this.  It tasted ok, but my cooking time was WAY different.  At 30 min, it was still completely soupy, and I had to cook an additional hour, and eventually cranked up the temp.  Maybe it‚Äôs because I prepared it the day before and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight?  Anyway, It didnt impress the guests.   I will stick with my usuals  from now on.

I‚Äôve made this twice and both times were good. My main problem Is that you have so much unused cornbread. For instance, I made this for Christmas and doubled the recipe. I didn‚Äôt even make all the cornbread the recipe called for and I had an entire pan left.

This was fantastic!!!  I made it exactly as written with a couple minor changes based on other reviews - - I used left over GF cornbread that was too good to through away, homemade chicken stock I had in the freezer, 1 cup of chopped celery, and 1.5 tablespoons of poultry seasoning (only because I wanted more seasoning than just the sage).  All my non GF family didn't know the difference.  Will definitely make it again!!  Thanks for sharing!

I usually make a complicated southwest style corn bread dressing, but wanted a classic taste & to simplify for Thanksgiving 2017. After reading many reviews, this is how I made it based on this recipe: 2 pans of Jiffy corn bread (has sugar *gasp!* but is the taste I grew up with & it's cheap & easy), 2 cups of the juices from my turkey (cooked in a cooking bag to GUARANTEE that I would have the juice - I will never go back to the old way of roasting a turkey!), 1 & 1/2 capfuls of McCormick's poultry seasoning (stirred into the liquid like another reviewer suggested - tyvm, great tip! This had the sage plus thyme & gave it a good flavor), 1 cup small dice celery (4 stalks), 1 cup chopped yellow onion (the better part of one large), 1/2 cup small dice orange pepper (1/2 a medium pepper) ok, I know this was a lot of vegetables, but it cooked down, but next time I'll do 3/4 C of the onion & celery. I used 1 stick of butter (it was a tad much, rich but not greasy, so it was fine - but next time I'll use 6 TB, not all 8, especially because I used real turkey juice - you CAN ruin your dressing with too much butter. I learned that the hard way one year!), 2 eggs lightly beaten, & additional salt & pepper, because I did not use salted stock. Baked it at 350 in a 9x13 pyrex (I stirred it once after 15 min) for 30 minutes. It came out TERRIFIC! Everyone loved it. It was the taste I was craving & it was SO EASY. I'll make it again & won't wait for Turkey Day either. I'll cut the recipe i

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving this year.  My mom passed away in April and she always made the dressing.  The flavor was VERY tasty - I added a little chopped chicken like mom would do.  My only problem was, it was very dense/thick and wondered what I need to change to make it fluffier - less heavy.  Any suggestions?

Made this dressing for the first time and it was so delicious.  I used Jiffy and love the little bit of sweetness.  It's not sweet like some others are saying.  I will try a corn meal next time to really taste the difference.   I also needed to use a little more stock than the recipe calls for in order to have the soupy look.  Not to soupy though.  But other than that, I hope this becomes a family tradition and when I have grandkids, they will ask for this dressing.  :-)

I love cornbread dressing but In the past I have never liked the dressing I prepare myself. This year was different, I tried this recipe and it was a success! I had to push myself away from the table! Easy and very tasty. Reading the reviews helped me, I was able to adjust the sage appropriately to suit my taste.

Make sure you do not use a cornbread box mix but make it from scratch from recipe on back of cornmeal bag. Also use 5 pieces of dry, white bread (toast it in oven) and crumble it up into the mix. Also is better if you do not use chicken stock with salt in it...use unsalted chicken stock. This is the recipe my mom used - it's really good!

Excellent recipe.   I have always made the dressing by memory from watching my older relatives and decided to try a true recipe this year.   I did triple the recipe as we have a large extended family.  Other than adjusting the onions, celery, sage and eggs to compensate accordingly,  I did not change a thing. Turned out perfect.  Thanks.

Too much liquid in the recipe. I'd cut the chicken stock down to 1 1/2 cups. And the package of cornbread made twice as much as you needed since the recipe called for 3 cups crumbled. You could get away with just using the smaller box of cornbread.

This recipe is really nice :3 but I changed a few things. Instead of directly adding sage I added pan drippings from my Turkey which already had sage and other seasonings in it. I also used Aunt Jemima's Cornbread Mix.

I'm from North Carolina and this is a real deal Southern Dressing  recipe. 

The only thing I do  different is I boil turkey necks to make a stock and add the turkey stock and neck meat to the dressing. 

You can use sweet or regular corn bread/muffin mix. I know however many Southerns feel that using a sweet cornbread  is a big  No, No and not the traditional way. I however prefer a little sweeter taste to my dressing.

My first time making dressing! Because I decided at the last minute to make this for Thanksgiving.  I settled for ground sage. Seemed to work just as well. I added a bit of Italian seasoning and Italian chicken sausage from Trader Joe's (casing removed and browned even though package said fully cooked). I used jiffy cornbread mix. I think the sage and Italian seasoning I used knocked out the sweetness some reviewers warned about.  Overall I think it came out pretty good considering this was my first time. It's been requested again for Christmas :)

I am a novice cook and it was my first time to make dressing! I was so nervous because i did make it with more stuff for a few more people. It was amazing and i was so glad for this recipe. I just tasted as i went.  So excited, thank you!

I made this recipe as a departure from the same old same old dressing for Thanksgiving dinner. I followed some of the reviewers' advice and added bell pepper to the veggie mix. I also used a sweet cornbread mix (on accident) and it was a huge hit with my family! I made it the night before but then brushed a little melted butter over top and heated it through shortly before dinner. Like most, I'm a little gun shy with sage. I used a little less than the recipe called for. Per the reviews, I added the seasoning to the broth and cooked the vegetables down for a few minutes before mixing everything, making it the perfect texture. The only complaint I heard was that I should have doubled the recipe because there weren't enough leftovers for everyone to take some home!

Wow! For the first time since I took over the holiday cooking, all the dressing finally disappeared. Past problems were dryness or lack of flavor. I just followed the recipe. Mine was thick and wet with 8 cups cornbread, 3 cups stock and 4 eggs. Another cup of stock would have made soup. The seasonings were simple and delicious. My 2.5 qt casserole dish made the recipe around 3 inches deep, so it took a little over an hour to cook with a couple of stirs in the last 30 minutes. Keeper.

I used 4 boxes of cornbread muffin mix. I doubled the recipe and only used the original amount of sage. It took longer than 30 mins to cook because I increased the volume. If you do the same then add @ 20 mins more cooking time :) My daughter wants me to make it again which is a two thumbs up because she has never eaten dressing or stuffing because she didn't like it.  For new cooks maybe explaining how many stalks of celery is needed. I chopped 3 big stalks and had 2 cups. I use green onions- 3/4 of the bag- instead of yellow for added flavor and color :)

I've used this recipe for several years now, and my family loves it. I follow the tips from other comments - make sure the cornbread mix doesn't contain sugar, and add the raw eggs last so you can add the sage to taste (the recipe does call for too much sage). I also add boiled eggs to the mix because my grandmother always did.

This is good stuff! Except for the cornbread mix, this is the dressing my family has had at the holidays forever. Other posters are correct. If you use a mix, do not use a sweet cornbread. And the onions and celery or anything else you want to add should be chopped finely. No big crunchy bits.  Also, my mom and grandmother always cooked the cornbread until it was to the point most would call it burned. At least VERY browned around the edges . Along with all the sage, this gives the dressing a deeper flavor. The finished dressing is much darker than a bright yellow cornbread.

Naturally can be gluten free and still  a family favorite for everyone! I created it gluten free totally by accident. Simply buy the Dixie Lilly Medium White  Cornmeal (yellow bag at Kroger) and make the cornbread according to directions which is a southern recipe that uses baking powder instead of flour!  Omit the optional sugar.  The only other modification is to use gluten free chicken broth and you have a great recipe everyone in the family can enjoy.  (Do not get Dixie Lilly self-rising version-it calls for flour. Use medium white )

This recipe was so easy and so good.  My friends remarked how the dressing was not try like others they have had.  I didn't not follow to a T due to I thought I had sage but ended up that I did not have any at home when I was making the recipe.  I substituted the sage for poultry seasoning instead and it gave it more flavor!  I also added some green onions my corn bread mix before baking it.

I loved it and so did my family the only thing I decreased was the sage as it is a little much for  small children. Overall it was very tasty.

My family enjoyed this dish.  It was something different and welcomed to our table.  As mentioned by one of the reviewers you do not need to use Jiffy Corn Mix.  I used a real cornbread mix.  I like White Lily myself.  But all in all a great recipe.

I wasn't sure what kinda of cornbread to buy but my mother-in-law taught me to use self rising cornmeal and water. aid its a waste to make a home made batch with eggs and all. So I used water bread and boiled my chicken and used my own broth sage salt pepper to taste and poultry season added the boiled eggs and of course the cranberry sauce on the side! It was a great starter recipe or just a quick dish.

This is a delicious recipe.  I made it but I made a boo boo the first time I made it by using Jiffy cornbread mix.  I forgot that it is a sweet cornbread so it didn't turn out like I wanted....however, it was still tasty.

Excellent recipe. I was nervous about it being too dense, so I used a little less chicken broth. I should have used slightly more as it needed a bit more moisture for my tastes. We finished the last of it today, and very much enjoyed it. I think I'll make it again soon so I can get the feel for it.

Easy to make. Tastes great. I added some non-saute'd celery to the top for extra color and some crunch.

My first time make it but I nailed it.  It tasted just like my mother use to make.  I did make some changes based on other comments.
1. Instead of chicken stock:  I uses juice from my turkey which was seasoned with salt and pepper and onion only.
2.  I used Jiffy cornbread mix but I added a pinch of sage to the cornbread mix.  Then while mixing the wet dressing I added 3 pinches.   It turned out perfect.

I loved this recipe because it was simple and easy! It's definitely great for the beginner cook. However, I did make a few changes. I found that using jiffy corn bread mix, doesn't make it overly sweet at all. I also made it using aunt Jamima brand corn meal mix, and added about  1Tbs of sugar. Everything else, I followed exactly. Thanks for sharing this holiday favorite. It was delicious!

We've actually substituted the mix with Cornbread bought from our local CottonPatch restaurant.  Theirs are excellent though difficult to eat because they fall apart and crumble everywhere.  However, they are really awesome when used in this recipe!

I love this recipe! Everybody in my family ate all of the dressing  in two days. It is so awesome! Everybody who came around  and ate some asked me for the recipe. I've been making this dressing for the last three years and it's still a winner at Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Alright, let me just say what picky eaters my family members are, myself included.  This dressing is CRAZY GOOD!  I've made it twice now.  The first time I made it, I went strictly by the recipe, and it was a HIT!  I now have to double the recipe because everyone loves it so much.  My grandmother loves sage, so when I double the recipe, I put 1/3 cup of sage in it, and it's perfect!

Used this recipe for a tray that served approx. 50 people for a Christmas Party. Adjusted recipe by adding chicken and turkey sausage added some fennel and red bell peppers, garlic and parsley. It worked very well. It was fast and tasted delicious. Cooking time stayed about the same. I will keep this recipe as a favorite...

I have tried a different stuffing every year, I am done looking this the one I will make every year. I added a pound of Jimmy Dean sage sausage and increased corn bread and broth as needed. Perfect. Thanks so much for sharing.

I get most of my recipes from this website. I can honestly say that this one was the worst.  I made it yesterday for Thanksgiving, took one bite, asked my hubby to take a bite and we decided that is was too bad to serve to anyone.

This was delicious!! I cannot have a lot of wheat so cornbread was terrific for me.  I doubled the recipe but since my cornbread was too moist, I still only used 2 eggs and 1 cup of broth. I used sage, salt and pepper to taste (before adding eggs and broth). Since my batch was larger and quite moist, the dressing needed at least 45 minutes in the oven.

love this recipe. I have made it this way before but would forget little things from time to time. My grandmother would put either creamed corn or whole kernel sweet corn in hers as well.

Great!!! Every year I make stove top but this year my husband mention he misses his grandma' dressing. I'm sure his grandma was a great cook. So I wanted to surprise him and made this dish and he LOVED IT!! He absolutely loved it :)

This is very similar to my recipe. I do add a tiny bit of chopped fresh rosemary and a touch of garlic powder. Sometimes I will brown hot Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage (about 1/2 lb.) and mix it in. It adds a great flavor. I also find it comes out better if I bake the cornbread itself a couple of days in advance.

I doubled the recipe. I also toasted the cornbread under the broiler after chopping it up so it wouldn't be so mushy after adding everything to it. I can't wait to eat it with the turkey!

This was excellent!  Every bite was gone.  I doubled the recipe, with the exception of eggs.  I only used 3.  I also used very little celery and leeks instead of onions, but that is just our preference.  Also used chopped fresh sage (3 tbsp).  I poured a little extra chicken stock over it after it was in the pan, and stirred once during cooking.  I will make this every Thanksgiving!

I grew up making cornbread dressing, but I just don't have the patience to make the cornbread, THEN make the dressing... this recipe combined with a cornbread dressing mix has made cornbread dressing easy enough for me.

In my family, the key to a good cornbread dressing was to get the cornbread,   vegetables, and eggs cooked (we would hardboil the eggs ahead of time) so that you could get everything dumped together (in step 4) and "season it to taste"... (which meant "eat most of it before it even makes it in the oven").

This recipe is good enough that there was very little seasoning needed before it was to my taste... I like a little garlic in mine and a little more onion, I also added about a cup of extra water to get all the flavors to mix correctly, but before I knew it, I was fighting the urge to eat your unbaked dressing by the forkfull... I'll try to remember to post again after I try the cooked product and I will definitely hang on to this recipe so I can use it again at Christmas time!

My first time making dressing/stuffing other than Stove Top. Had never made homemade cornbread before either and this recipe didn't really tell you how to do that but I liked the rest of the recipe and the comments... Some of the commenters mentioned corn bread meal/corn bread mix -- I settled on Publix brand cornbread mix. Followed their recipe on the packing and it was delicious. Then I followed THIS recipe using chicken stock, onions, celery (plus some pecans--minus the sage, didn't have any) and it really was very good. Thanks!

Loved this stuffing.  This Thanksgiving was my first attempt at making stuffing after watching my mom do it for years. I added one pack of pork ground sausage after frying it into crumbles, then I cooked the celery and onions in the leftover fat.  Other than that, no changes made.  I am official.

Very great recipe.... Using fresh scratch made corn bread,I have used this one for over 16 years. To liven it up a little and since I add celery, onion, chopped I only use 1 1/ 4 cups of broth and add a whole can of cream of mushroom soup and 4 oz of sour cream mixed together, reserving the rest of the broth to add in case it is to dry. Also leave in some of the shredded chicken pieces where the backs and necks were used to make the homemade broth seasoned with celery, onion and carrots, sage and S&P. Give it a try.. Its good.

I made this today as part of our Thanksgiving meal.  Everyone one loved it!  I used 2 boxes 8.5oz of Jiffy cornbread mix & used 1 tbl. of rubbed sage.  I wasn't sure how much sage to add because I didn't know the difference between dried sage & rubbed sage.  I found out all "rubbed" means is that it is crumbled.  Next time I make it I will add Jimmy Deans sage sausage.  Very good
