Super-easy and absolutely delicious cake. I took one star off for the runny consistency of the cream/icing. Everyone loved how it tasted but my cake looked very...uh....homemade. My well-drained mandarin oranges slid on the top and the top cake layer shifted and slid on the middle cream layer even after I put the entire cake into the freezer in an attempt to firm-up the cream a bit. I would definitely make this again because of the taste alone but only for very close friends and family.

This cake has a fantastic flavor.  It is moist, citrus-y and the flavors mix beautifully.  I make it with fat free sour cream, egg substitute and add approx. 1/2 teaspoon of either lemon zest or orange peel to the icing.  I agree with the other reviewer- this cake does not work well as a layer cake as the whole thing slides off the layer of mandarin oranges (4 stars).  It also does not keep well, so it's best to be eaten the day it is made. Alternately, I have made this as a sheet cake and as individual cupcakes (single layer only) and found it was a big hit (5 stars!).  I recommend decreasing the amount of Cool Whip and increasing the sour cream to get the icing to the consistency that appeals to your palate. Yum!

An alternative for presentation. Bake this as a bundt or tube cake and prepare the topping separately. Chop the mandarin oranges and stir into the topping ingredients and spoon over individual servings. Other fruits could be used such as pineapple or berries. Or use the topping over a good sour cream pound cake.

I followed this recipe exactly for the cake. The cake, very moist and light with a wonderful citrusy flavor, is definitely one I will make again. I was worried however, about the layers sliding apart as mentioned by other reviewers, and having had problems before with corporate sponsored recipes (I think they must put them down on paper without actually testing them out sometimes), I took the comments to heart and decided to forgo the topping/filling part of the recipe for a stabilized cream cheese/whipped cream frosting and filling instead. I also used fresh mandarin oranges. The whole package together was pretty and very delicious, but I still had some slippage when it came time to cut the cake, although it was minor. It seemed to be the oranges in the middle layer that cause the problem. If I were to make this again, I might slice the top of the bottom cake layer to make it a more stable level, and also mix the oranges right into the filling which would really only work if you use the tinned mandarins (the tiny, sweet fresh mandarins I had were a really nice addition)  Alternatively, forgo the oranges in the middle layer altogether and just pile them on top. Bottom line, the way this cake is put together does need a bit of tweaking, but it's worth playing with as it really is delicious.

Very good citrus theme/flavor.  Oldest son prefers citrus to chocolate, so I made this (along with another Allrecipe - Triple Chocolate Bliss Cake=A+).  However, I made ONE change... instead of white cake I used ORANGE flavored boxed cake mix.  The orange went beautifully with the lemon pudding.  The frosting was especially good!
