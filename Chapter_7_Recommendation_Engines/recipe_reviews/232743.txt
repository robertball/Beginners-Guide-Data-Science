I made this as directed except substituted coconut oil for the butter.  It turned out fantastic.  Years ago I had a great chicken salad like this and have been looking for a recipe that matched that.  This is it.

We all enjoyed this.  In an effort to save calories, I omitted the butter, just toasted the almonds and curry powder in a dry pan until fragrant.  I used garlic powder because I just do not care to bite into garlic in a salad and then I found someone had eaten the grapes I was hoarding to make this so I added a handful of raisins (dried grapes, right?).   I also added some green onions that needed to be used.  I chilled this for an hour as stated, but next time, when I actually have grapes, I will make the salad either in the morning or night before.  This only gets better.  Thanks for a great chicken salad.

Amazing!!!!!  I've been looking for one similar to a local cafe and this is pretty darn close!  I used 1/4 cup plain non fat Greek yogurt with 1/4 cup butter and one cup mayo with olive oil with one cup regular mayo to try to make it less fattening.  Still tastes awesome!!

love this recipe.   I tried using rotisserie chicken and red grapes..... didn't care for it as much as I do this recipe. I do, however, double the curry.

Great  salad! I did make a few adjustments. I used half the butter, and for the other half I used coconut oil. I didn't replace all the butter because you really need some of the butter flavor. I used half the mayo and subbed plain yogurt for the other half. I also more than doubled the curry, and used about 2/3 the garlic. I also added about a tsp of salt. I don't like drenched salad so after making the dressing up I gradually added dressing to the chicken and grapes until it hit the right mix. I saved the rest of the dressing to use on sandwiches. It's too good to waste! Lastly I recommend at least 8 hours in the fridge before serving for the flavors to really develop. The salad was a hit at a potluck and I will definitely make again....in fact I think this will become my signature potluck dish - doubling the recipe of course!

Cut the mayo in half, cut the garlic in half, double the curry and try it. We like garlic but not sure if it even belongs in this recipe.

My hubby loves chicken salad with curry and red grapes. Lots of recipes to choose from but this sounded good.  Very, very flavorful...which isn't surprising since the first ingredient is butter:)  One suggestion...try it with sea salt & cracked pepper almonds (the salad topping kind).  This will be my go-to recipe.

Delicious! I didn't have almonds on hand, so I added 1.5 stalks of diced celery which made it nice and crunchy. This one is a keeper.

This was very good, but next time I make it i will use chopped celery instead of parsley.  I didn't care for the texture of the parsley in this salad.  I will also substitute l cup Greek yogurt for one cup of the mayo to make it healthier.  Although I like garlic,  I would also reduce the amount next time, as there is plenty of flavour from the curry powder.  Overall though a good recipe.

No matter how you tweak it it seems to work. i like a drenched mixture if you dont then cut back on the mayo. i substituted half the mayo with yogurt. I think the curry powder varies in potency so the first time i made this i doubled it and it still seemed weak. this time i quadroupled it. I sunbstituted crasins and apple for grapes. I also cut the butter in half. I think you can omit without noticing a big diff, especially if you are tryung to make a healthier version. I added a sprinkle of cayenne, not enough to really nitice spice but to round out the curry a bit more. As i mentiined mine is kind of muted flavor. I love making this out of my chicken roast leftovers.

I feel bad giving it such a low review but, unless I somehow made a mistake, I found the 1/2 cup butter the recipe called for almost nauseating after it cooled in the mixture.   I actually rinsed it out so I wouldn't lose all my chicken. I'd been especially intrigued because I too had had a place I used to buy curry chicken salad from but I moved and never thought of and regretted not asking before I moved for the recipe.  Without the butter, it would have been good, though nothing out of the ordinary.

This recipe is quick and simple. It was so easy to make. I love the curry flavor. I improvised a little with the ingredients. I added mango and granny smith apples to give it a crunchy texture. Also, adding the fruit made for a nice sweet and spicy contrast.

I love Curry Chicken salad. This is the first recipe I've tried that is exactly right. At first I wondered what was going on, as it asked for butter, then melt the butter, etc. But man, it was excellent. I substituted cilantro for parsley, as I don't like the taste of parsley. Turned out amazing! My husband loved it.

Flavor basically good however,  recommend: one or two cloves of garlic NOT 1/4 cup. My family loves garlic, but in this recipe, it was overwhelming. Additionally, I would substitute or eliminate the butter as the taste doesn't enhance the recipe and adds a ton of calories.

I eliminated the butter, used only half of the mayonnaise and substituted a cup of minced celery for the parsley.   The recipe still had plenty of moisture and I got rave reviews from men and women at the luncheon where it was served.   Would definitely make this again.  I don't consider this a healthy salad due to the mayo but it is nice for a special event since it is so flavorful.

I liked this recipe. I gave it 4 stars because I substituted low-fat plain yogurt for the butter. I will definitely make this again. I might try it with craisins or perhaps dried cherries.
