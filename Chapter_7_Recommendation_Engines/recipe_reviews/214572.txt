AMAZING!  Followed the recipe to the tee with the exception of baking at 425 degrees for 15 minutes vs. deep frying.

This was very good.  I was patient and let the sauce cook down.  I added some green Tabasco sauce to the sour cream sauce, too.  Instead of frying, I brushed the whole thing with olive oil and baked in my convection toaster oven at 400 degrees for 5 minutes, turned over and baked 5 more minutes.  So good!!

This turned out really, really well.  I knew the sour cream sauce had to be good, but wasn't too sure what to expect otherwise.  I would recommend frying them a little longer than 1 minute on each side--they came out a little bit cool, so I threw them in for another minute per side.  If you end up going with the full 3 cups of water, it will take a while to boil down, but it is totally worth the wait.  Will definitely be making again.

i followed the recipe almost..i doubled the seasonings and tossed the chicken breasts in a ziploc bag and let them sit for a couple of hours.  i used all the water which i also seasoned before putting in the chicken breasts to simmer.  i shredded the chicken while it was reducing in the pan to absorb more of the flavors while cooking.  i also wrapped them and sprayed them with low-fat cooking spray and cooked them in the oven at 400 degrees.  for the sauce i used chicken broth instead of the bouillion cube i also added some of the "sauce" from the cooked chicken as well as some adobo and lemon juice for a little tang to compliment the spice..served with yellow rice and black beans and garlic.  BIG HIT with the men in my house!  thank you for the recipe i loved it!!!!

This recipe is insane!  Took the following (4) user reviews and combined them as follows:  "doubled seasonings"..."cut water in half"..."fresh garlic, instead of powder"..."more cayenne, less chili powder"...THEN I added my own twist by replacing green chiles with jalepenos.  THERE ARE NO WORDS! (...not to mention splashing an occasional bite down with a sip of a fresh margarita)

This is an excellent recipe. The sour cream sauce made it even better. I doubled the spice ingredients and it still wasn't too over-powering.  I would recommend to use less than 3 cups of water with the chicken because it took a while to evaporate. Overall, it was easy to make and a great hit!

This is a really great recipe! We had extra large tortillas, so I used 3 chicken breasts instead of two, and doubled the spices. The filling has great flavor and the sauce compliments the chimis really well. Next time I think I will try baking the chimis instead of frying. Hopefully this will make the leftovers a little less soggy (and a little healthier).

This is a great and easy recipe! I did use fresh garlic instead of powder, and because I didn't have bouillon cubes I used chicken broth and didn't add water. Will definately make this again! Thanks for sharing :)

Delicious!
I cut the water to 1 1/2 cups since others had recommended that. Added a little extra spice by way of salsa verde.
I didn't make the sour cream sauce, but I did have butter/flour/cheese on hand, so I made a thin cheese sauce and added green chilies to it. Superb taste. I've never made chimis before, but now I'm not afraid. This chicken is very tasty! thanks for the recipe.

this is a fantastic recipe. the only thing i did differently was instead of deep frying i baked in the oven for 10-15 minutes on 400 after brushing the outside with olive oil like another reviewer suggested, turned out GREAT and even my picky eater ate the whole thing!!

Made these for lunch today.  Didn't add the entire three cups of water as I was in a little hurry, and I doubled the spices.  The filling and the chimichangas themselves were amazing. The family loved them.  the sauce got so-so reviews.  We thought it could have stood more spice and less chicken-y flavor.  Maybe even adding in some cheese would help.  But I enjoyed the learning experience, and thanks for a great chimi recipe!

Oh so yummy!  I am now my family's hero!  Will definitely make this again!  Hint:  Time saver trick for me was to use rotisserie chicken, pull apart and cook with seasonings according to directions.

Definitely one of the best recipes I've tried here.  My husband says it's a definite keeper.  The best part is that both the meat and sauce reheat nicely (just be sure to leave some "juice" so the meat won't be dry), so it's a very easy leftover dish.  Combines nicely with the Mexican Rice II recipe.

OMG!  If I could give this 10 stars I would.  PLEASE use the 3 c. of water and let it cook down.  Those of you who didn't have no idea what you're missing.  The sour cream sauce was so incredible we put it on rice as a side dish.  I did take another poster's advice and baked them at 425 for 15 mins to eliminate some fat.  

So amazingly good.  My family no longer needs to go out to our favorite Mexican restaurant, this is that good.  Followed the recipe as printed and will serve again and again!

Ohhh yummmm!! These are SO good, granted I made a few of my own tweaks (hence the 4 stars...5 with my improvements though!), these really are delicious. I've made them twice, once following the recipe exactly and once with some changes. While it was great the first time, it was WOW the second! :) Here's what I did: double all the spices except salt (this adds SO much and not overpowering at all; really flavors the meat), cut the water down to 2 cups to speed up the time it takes to absorb, used pepperjack cheese instead of just montery jack, baked in a 400 oven for 10-15 min instead of frying. The first time I made the sauce I felt it was a bit bland, so this time I: made it in the same pan I cooked the chicken in (infusing it with the flavors and spices of the meat), added montery jack cheese, and a bit of lemon juice to brighten things up...made all the difference, the sauce was a hit! With my minor changes, this dish was a stand-out for my family and one I'll be making again and again!

VERY good...only changes were to use chicken stock instead of water and bullion. I also baked instead of frying and didn't bother with toothpicks...if you wrap the tortillas carefully and well, the toothpicks aren't necessary and they are a pain to remove!! Topped these with the sauce and shredded lettuce and tomato. Great recipe.

I'm sure I'll make this again, but will use more cayenne and less chili powder next time.  I doubled the spices as suggested, and it was definitely flavorful, but not nearly enough heat (and I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to heat).

Very good recipe. I took some other suggestions and broke the chicken up as it cooked to seal in more flavor. I changed the green chilies to a can of Rotel tomato and green chilie with cilantro. I also brushed them with olive oil and baked them on convection at 425 for 20 minutes. Love the fried flavor without it being fried. Full of many flavors.

Not just for chimichangas!  I double the recipe but keep the water for the chicken at 3 cups.  I make enchiladas.  I followed the recipe but rolled up the tortillas, chicken, and cheese. Place in a 9 x 13 pan, ladle sauce over the enchiladas.  Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  Let set 5 minutes before serving.  Yum!

The chicken in this recipe also works for tacos and sandwiches.

These were really good, after making them and reading some reviews, I might cut down on the water the next time, it took way to long for me to get the water down, so I shreaded the chicken early and I might have lost some of the flavor that way.

Excellent recipe. I definitely agree with the other comments which recommend using less water and more spices.  To the filling I added diced jalapenos, a diced cubanelle pepper, and a full can of green chilies. It definitely wasn't overpowering and could have even used a little more spice.  I omitted the use of the bouillon cube and instead used a cup of the mixture broth and it turned out perfectly!  The leftovers I'm hoping to put on nachos or something. I'll definitely use this recipe again!

Omg I'm in love. I just happened to stumble upon this recipe on Day 2 of owning a deep fryer and I though to myself, "the family loves burritos, and things that are deep fried" (in moderation, of course), after reading the reviews I was excited to say the least. My 4 foodie stepchildren were just as amped. I made the chicken per the recipe keeping in mind that some reviewers doubled the seasoning, so I made another batch of seasoning and kept it to the side. Before shredding the chicken I tasted and decided to add it, and as one reviewer said it wasn't overpowering at all. It was actually just right. I added 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar because...well just because I like it. The chicken turned out so good I'm tossing out my Lawry's Taco Seasoning...and rethinking my life. The sauce was amazing as well, I didn't feel the need to add salt or pepper and it complimented the chimis so well. The kids were already asking for me to prepare it again next week. Thank you sstrawder for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This is fab-u-lous! Really good! Super simple to boot! I have made it several times using fresh Serrano chili's as well as jalapenos, chicken broth instead of water is great too, and it goes well with all sorts of cheeses and 'shells' meaning you can use corn, flour or even healthy one - I love it best using a very thin wheat wrap fried in olive oil. If you want another fabulous gravy, use the cup of seasoned water you stewed the chicken in - it is fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe :)

This has become a standby recipe in my dinner repertoire!  Doing it in a saucepan is a LOT of work, though, so I do my chicken in a slow cooker, all day long, with the water and the spices.  This makes the chicken literally fall apart once you're ready to put it into the tortillas.  I also bake them at 425 rather than deep frying.  
  I make the sauce while they're baking, and voila!  I am ashamed to say that I can eat a LOT of these in one sitting....!

I followed the recipe exactly and these were delicious!  They were a bit more time consuming than I expected, but definitely worth it!

I love this! I put the extra breast in as mine were not super large, doubled the spices and 4 x the cayenne (still not quite hot enough for me) I had enough meat for 8, so froze half. I did up for in shells all at once and stored them in the fridge. Had one for supper and the rest for lunches. OMG they get better everyday. I George Forman Grilled them and used the whole amount of sauce divided by four (wait to cool before adding sour cream so it lasts four days)

With light sour cream and looking up how much you save not frying I calculated each one with 1/4 sauce to be 337 cals to 387. You could also use light cheese and it would be less.

I will always love having these for lunch, it is so fast and yummy. The grill takes 5 minutes. Thank you!

This was amazing! I did read all of the other reviews first which, let's be honest, does help. I mixed all of the dry ingredients and used them as a rub for the chicken which I let sit out for about 15 minutes. I put the 3 cups of water in a skillet instead of a saucepan, and turned up the heat before adding the chicken,  which allowed the liquid to reduce faster. The chicken poached without drying out. I did remove the chicken and shred while I continued to reduce the mixture a little more. My husband loves fried Chimichangas from the local Mexican restaurant but they are higher in fat than I like to do at home. So, as many suggested, I assembled them, sprayed them with Pam Olive oil,  and baked them uncovered at 425 for 15 minutes. They came out crisp and perfect. I agree with the others that the sour cream sauce was delicious! I didn't have a 7 oz can of green chiles on hand but did have 2 4.5 oz cans that I used most of and thought the "heat" was perfect. I will definitely make this over and over.

Wonderful recipe. I made flour tortillas from scratch because you are not able to buy  a decent commercial one in Maine. Then I had to sub the Monterey Jack cheese with 1/2 Mozzarella & 1/2 mild Cheddar. I shredded them & combined into Chicken  mix which had cooled to room temp. Oh, and the can of green chili was subbed with home grown canned Big Jims Peppers which I almost forgot about. Everything turned out perfect.

This was pretty good. I agree with other posters that the sauce was a little heavy on chicken flavor. It also became way to thick waiting for the chimichangas to be done so I think next time I would make them first and then make the sauce.

These were delicious. Only change I made was to add a few squirts of Chipotle Tabasco (green) to the chicken mixture. I didn't have the ingredients for the sauce, so just topped with a dollop of sour cream.  Husband really liked and he's not a favorite of Mexican food.

I thought it was very good but my wife loved it!  Next time, I'll chill the chimichangas in the fridge before deep frying to try to get them to hold together better (ours fell apart in the deep fryer - only used 1 toothpick though).

These were so yummy!  A definite keeper! I baked them @ 425 for about 15 minutes instead of frying.  Also, I just glanced over the directions and didn't reserve any of my chiles. So to give the sauce a little more taste I added about 2 Tbsp of jarred salsa I had in the fridge. It worked out fine and my family of 5 enjoyed them a lot.  Thank you!!!

These were okay - certainly easy to prepare.  Needs a lot more spice as the meat was too mild.  Oh it was good, just not enough flavor.  I didn't wait for the water to cook down to 1C - takes too long. When it wa at about 2+ C, I stopped cooking and used 1C or the chicken "water" in the sour cream sauce - really livened that up. Plus, I baked them which is a bit healthier.  I'd make this again, but up the ante with the spices....

I was impressed when my 8 and 6 year olds enjoyed this so much they asked to have the left overs the next day. I cook a wide variety of things and they are very used to having to at least taste it...i assumed this would be a one bite wonder for them but NOPE! well done!

These were a huge hit for dinner tonight.  They are time consuming but worth it.  Next time I'm going to use less water than what is called for.  I took over an hour to reduce down.  The sauce is to die for.  I baked ours on 400 degrees for 12 mins.  I sprayed a cookie sheet with Pam and also sprayed the tops and they crisped up real nice.

I used to manage Mexican restaurants, go figure a nice Jewish boy in that position, LOL, so I am somewhat familiar with Mexican food.  I'm used to the deep fried chimis and had trouble getting past that with this recipe.  Next time I may try deep frying.  I first tried this as written and it was ok.  The second time I followed the advice of other reviewers and double the spices but also did something else a bit different.  I took a page from roasting turkeys in cooking bags and now do that with my chickens.  I get a lot of great juices left over that I use as stock in other recipes and used it here instead of the bouillon and water.  It came out so much better with so much more flavor but still not what I think of as a chimichanga.  Maybe it's just my bad habit of liking them deep fried.  Let's see what happens when I try that.  All in all, however, when I don't try comparing to a chimi it's a very good dish.

My family raved over this recipe. I don't like sour cream, but even to me the sauce was good. My husband has his own 'Mexican chicken mixture' recipe he uses, so we just substituted that for the filling. Came out great!

Fiance and I made these for the first time tonight... delish! I did think for how much seasoning there was in the chicken it would have a bit more flavor.  Instead of monterey jack we made queso and layered over the sour cream sauce... fiance was very very please as was I!

This was amazing! My boyfriend loved this, and told me I had to make sure I made it again or he'd be mad at me. :) I doubled the spices as other reviewers had suggested, but I didn't have cayenne pepper so that was omitted. I also followed suggestions and used only 1 1/2 cups of water. The sour cream sauce is great, and I'm sure it would taste awesome on enchiladas or other Mexican dishes.

Delicious. It was a lot of work so better if you prepare the meat ahead of time or double the recipie so you have leftovers or enough for a party.  But overall so good. Would make again when there was more than just my husband and I to enjoy it.

This meat mixture gets a 5 star rating, it was delicious even my picky eaters loved it.  I forgot to read the recipe before starting and boiled the chicken first in just water so I then shredded it and added all the spices and water (reducing to 1 1/2 cups as others had suggested) and followed the directions for the meat mixture from there and it turned out perfect.  I also brushed the chimichangas with oil and baked them at 425 for 15 min. and they turned out perfect and much healthier than frying.  I didn't try the cream sauce, as I was feeling lazy, just topped with sour cream and salsa.  This is a definite keeper and next time I will try it with the sauce.

This was good and easy to make. My husband wanted me to double the spices after reading some of the reviews, so I did and it wasn't too spicy.  I let the liquid simmer as mentioned in the directions and it didn't take that long. I don't know what the big deal is. I used chicken stock instead of the chicken bouillon. Instead of frying I brushed each chimichanga with olive oil and baked in my convection oven at 400 until browned about 10 minutes. We all loved. I will definitely make this again.  I might try it next time in the slow cooker.

This is a very good recipe!  I did cut the water back to 2 cups and it worked out fine.  I also baked them to cut down on calories.  The cream sauce was out of this world good!  Thanks for the recipe.

GREAT dish! I made a "few" changes as most people do depending on "their" taste. I marinated the chicken in a Tequila-Lime sauce for 3 hours. I "slowly" fried the chicken in an olive oil, non-salted butter mix for around 10 minutes. I added the chicken to the spice/H2O/onion mix (used HOT mexican chili powder) after reducing for about 5-7 minutes.  I made a Mexi-Rice and added that to the inside of my Chimis also. I DID NOT fry but baked @ 425 and turned half way for a total of 25 minutes...then added the sauce afterwards & heat in oven for 10 minutes after turning off. Will make again. Topped with lettuce & Roma Tomatoes...

Absolutely fantastic! I made these with homemade tortillas (made the process very time consuming), but the end result was great. These had a great flavor and the sauce was yummy. I didn't change a thing! Thank you for this one.

This was pretty good but I don't think I'll make it again. It took almost an hour from start to finish even though I had some already-cooked shredded chicken that I used and it wasn't tasty enough to warrant that kind of time. The flavours of the spices were good but it took forever for the liquid to boil down. And then the filling inside the tortillas ended up being kind of dry because the water that was left was making the tortillas soggy and running out of them, so I didn't want too much liquid. It could use a thicker moist ingredient like maybe salsa to put with the chicken inside the tortillas. I may use the sauce recipe part again, though.

I really love this sauce.  I actually used jarred jalapenos and it was delicious!  My family always loves chimichangas, but this sauce made it especially tasty!

We loved this recipe.  The flavors were fantastic!  We cut down on the water, and doubled the spices as other have, and found it to be just right.  We will definitely be making this again, no doubt about it!

I would give it five stars but I think the recipe was short on the amount of meat to use. I used 3 chicken breasts instead of two and it was just enough. Also, the water took quite a bit longer to reduce down. We're in higher altitude so that could be a factor for water boiling temps. not sure. Finally, I followed other recommendations and added extra spices per their measurements so it was tasty but I played with the original recipe.

This was awesome!  I did wander off the recipe a little as far as technique. Did 1/2 recipe, I threw a large frozen chicken breast into a crock with spices (I did add more cayenne 1 3/4 tsp and chili powder 1/4 tsp and a little more garlic 1/4tsp and 2 cloves garlic) and let it cook for 8 hrs on low, with water recommended. (I probably will cut this down next time). I did not have green chilies so I couldn't use them, but really didn't miss them. Then I added in the onions and garlic and let it simmer for a bit longer.  It fell right apart it was so moist.  For the sauce, I had a little help from the microwave.  I put into one dish the butter and flour, in a separate container the broth.  Heated butter mix just enough so the butter melted, stirred it around and let the broth get really hot and slowly added it to the flour butter mix.  Then added the sour cream, some poultry seasoning, pepper, little kosher salt and done.  I also HATE frying.  I did use less cheese, but wrapped them up (I only had small tortillas), brushed them with oil and threw them into the oven for 15 minutes and then flipped them over and let them go another 10.  They got really crispy and wonderful without frying.  Will do this again in the crock!  With the smaller tortillas, this would be a great snack for a party like an egg roll.  Cut it on diagonal and serve with the sauce for dipping.

I made up a vegetarian version of this with black beans and corn that was delicious. The whole thing seemed very salty to me (and I LOVE salt) so I would omit all added salt beyond the bouillon cube. I also used the refrigerated uncooked tortillas since they were much easier to roll and taste delicious. Serve with shredded lettuce, tomato, and sliced avocado.

This was amazing. I don't understand people calling the filling bland...it was anything but that. I have made this both with chicken and with beef, and both turned out awesome. The sour cream sauce was good, but next time I'll just use cream of chicken soup instead of doing the whole rue thing. I baked these at 425 for 15 minutes after spraying them with cooking spray. They came out delicious.

Very easy recipe. I love chimichangas but they are so unhealthy when you order them at restaurants. I baked these on 400 degrees. I also used low fat sour cream and wheat tortillas. Very good. I loved the sauce.

Like others, I set this on broil for a few minutes, flipped the wraps, put a little cheese on top and a little left over meat then broiled again for a few minutes until brown.

I also garnished with a little tomato and cilantro.  Yum!  Wife and kid loved it as well.

Excellent.  We loved this as well.  I took others advice and did not fry.  Brushed on olive oil and baked on 425 about 6 minutes each side.  I added a little bit of smoky paprika to the cream sauce.

This was GREAT and I will make it again ASAP!   Instead of 3 cups of water I used a can of chicken broth, doubled the spices as suggested, and added the liquid from the can of green chilis.  Baked them in the oven instead of deep frying.  A tiny bit spicy but fabulous!

Wow - I had no idea this was going to be so good until it was in my mouth! I followed the recipe with one exception - I omitted the canned chile's because I didn't have any one hand - and they weren't missed in my opinion. I didn't make the sour cream sauce, but rather just served sour cream on the side. The end result was ridiculously goood - hard to stop eating, authentic tasting chimichangas!

Delicious!!  I just cut down on the chilli powder, as that would have been far too hot for our taste.  Couldn't find canned green chiles, so opted for Salsa Verde instead.  Also added some of the Salsa Verde to the sour cream sauce as well as some green Tabasco as someone else had suggested.  I opted for spraying the chimichangas with garlic infused oil and baked in the oven at 400 for 5 mins each side instead of deep frying.  YUM!!  Definitely make again.

Great recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of water in both the filling and the sauce, omitted the chicken bouillon cube, made the sauce with olive oil instead of butter, and after rolling the tortillas as indicated in the recipe, I laid them side by side in a baking dish and poured the sauce over top.  Baked at 350 for 30 min.  No leftovers!

Amazing. I doubled the entire recipe, except I only used 4 cups of water. Next time I'll only use 2.5 cups of wate as it was still way too much and took a very long time to thicken. A single batch of the sauce is plenty. Everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent I fallowed the recipe, with
the exception of increasing the amount of seasoning. My wife thought it was a tad warm, next time will cut back and fallow the recipe.

absolutely loved it, made it for family who was skeptical to say the least, but made a believer out of them and they already asked for it again. Go figure. The only adjustment I made is, instead of frying it in oil, I brushed the shell with a bit of olive oil and stuck them into the oven for about 20 minutes. They came out crunchy and absolutely wonderful.

This was amazing. There wasnt even a lick left after my family was done. Next time I think I will double the recipe so that I can freeze some for an easy meal when in a hurry. Only thing I left out was the cumin but no one in my family likes that spice including me. Also, I didn't have fresh onion so I used dried onion, and it was still excelent. I'd give more stars if possible. this recipe is a keeper. Thank you!

This receipe sounds good but I have not tried this particular one.  I live in Chimi country and they are very common here and I make them often.  Needless to say I use leftover turkey from the holidays, left over roasted chicken from the store or I will just cook up some chicken or turkey.  They are very good and I use onion, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper but I add roasted red peppers. They make it just great.  Here we fry them crisp and cover them with sour cream with Jalapeno peppers or another pepper of choice.  Finely mince the peppers or put them in a small cusinart.  Then use guacamole on top.  Guacamole is just smashed avacados with lime juice, a little chipped cilantro and again minced peppers.  Add salt

EXCELLENT! the only change I made was to double all of the spices while cooking the chicken. It took about 1-1/2 hrs. to cook the liquid down, but it was totally worth it! I served these w/ 'Black Beans w/ Pico de Gallo' from this site, 'Guacamole' from this site and chips...an awesome dinner. This is a keeper, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very awesome!  The only thing I did different was I added some red bell pepper with the onion and I shredded the chicken while it was cooking down so it could absorb the flavor more!  This was soooooo tasty!

I changed up on  boiling the chicken with ingredients instead I put in ingredients to the chicken after it was cooked.I thought ,oh man I wanted this to be just right( just like the video) well as I was cooking I honestly felt like I was in one of those well known Mexican restaraunts and I was the head cook.Oh and by the way the chimichangas came out fantastic!Heck If I keep this up I just might be one of those good cooks:)

These were amazing!  I followed the recipe as written, except I didn't make the sour cream sauce, just used a dollop of sour cream on top. They didn't last long in our house!  I'm definitely going to make the sour cream sauce next time.

We are not usually fans of anything fried but this recipe is worth it!
If you are baking it then you are missing out. The crunchy deep fried shell covered with the sauce makes the dish perfect! We loved it and even tho it is a lot of work my family loves it. When we are in the rare mood for deep fried I will definitely make it again!!! Instead of green chili's (which my local grocery store didn't have) I used Spicy Rotel and it turned out great.

I love chimichangas, and this recipe is by far the best, even over my favorite Mexican restaurant! I usually double the seasonings because I like mine really bold in flavor, and I only do 2 cups of water instead of 3. Definitely worth the wait though! Love this recipe!

Great! Cooked chicken in broth. Doubled spices. Baked at 425 for 20 min instead of frying. Brushed olive oil on top and turned half way.

These were delicious! I wish I'd used less water as others have suggested to cut down on cook time, but other than that, no complaints. One note from me - I thought I could skip the toothpicks, figuring if I rolled them tight enough I wouldn't need to. My first chimi kind of exploded in the deep fryer, and all of the cheese leaked out. I made sure the rest were held closed with toothpicks! Don't skip that step!

I have made this several times and LOVE it. I have tweaked it a little to make it a little more flavorful and healthy too. Instead of water in the filling and in the sauce I just use chicken broth. And instead of 3 cups I use 2 for the filling. I also set my oven to 375 and brushed them with olive oil and put them in for about 15 or 20 minutes and flip them half way through. Basically until they're browned on both sides.

We made this as is and it was wonderful!  I didn't feel like they were a lot of work at all.  I made the chicken earlier in the day, and after I shredded it and put it back in the pan with the broth and seasonings, I covered it and put it in the refrigerator.  Then, when I was ready to make dinner, I just reheated it and the rest all went together very quickly!  Will definitely make again!

Delicious! I baked mine at 425 degrees for 15 minutes instead of frying them and left them in the oven to cool so they could brown. The sauce is savory and has a nice consistency. I served these delectable chimichangas with yellow rice, black beans or refried if I have time), salsa (or pico), verde sauce (optional), and green onion sprinkled on top. So yummy!

Awesome recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. I wouldnt cut down on the water like some people did. The water helps with the tenderness of the chicken. Its worth the wait, trust me. (I always boil seasoned chicken in water when i need extra tender chicken.) The only thing i would do different next time is double the sauce. The sauce tastes like queso blanco, its very good.

Delish! Tasted just like my favorite restaurant's. I used around 2c water to simmer down quickly. I also started with Perdue's Perfect Portions marinated Italian Seasonings chicken breasts. I used three breasts and only about 2 oz of green chillies in my chicken mixture and that was enough. Think I might try putting meat mixture into the slow-cooker next time to let it marinate and cook slowly for a quick dinner prep. I found it made way more sour cream sauce than was needed but it was soooo good, I don't mind one bit. Thanks for sharing.

I have always loved ordering chicken chimichangas at Mexican restaurants. One day we were having company and I wanted everyone to know what they were like. I found this recipe. It's the best chicken chimichanga! My whole family loves this recipe. We've made it several times. The topping is so good my husband and I make it up to add to several Mexican recipes.

Wow.  We loved these.  Thanks to the other reviewers, I want to recommend that you cook them in the deep fryer with canola oil heated up to 375.  They will cook quickly to the perfect crispy brown. 2.  Used more green chilis cause we like our Mexican spicey.    3. Followed recipe completely and loved the chicken flavor and the sauce!     The second time we made these we used store bought pre-cooked chicken fajita strips (John Soules brand or Tyson chicken tenders).  We made dinner in half the time with pre- cooked chicken that needed no extra seasoning.  A keeper!

I used a rotisserie chicken. I shredded it and let it simmer.  It really pulled in the flavors and it tasted amazing.  My family LOVED it.

Just made this and the only thing I changed was a can of Rotel instead of just a can of green chili's (didn't have any on hand).  Still came out great !!  Will be making again...

This is a five star recipe when it comes to flavor; creamy chicken filling with a twinge of chili to give it the right amount of non-spicy zing. I imagine you can use spicier chilies to your liking..  However, both the amount of chicken and the cooking time were off for us.  Two chicken breasts filled exactly 6 tortilla,s not 8, so we were short.  I will solve that by adding one extra breast. Also, the liquid reducing time for reducing the broth to 1 cup is not listed nor accounted in the recipe.  Add at least a half hour of cooking time if you live in a place where the air is somewhat humid. Here it was raining and it took about 45 minutes just fro that step alone.

Fantastic! I added a can of Mexi corn with the chicken, used low-fat sour cream and baked instead of fried and it was delicious. Easy trick for shredding chicken - use hand mixer on low and you get perfectly shredded chicken in under a minute :-) I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow!

Excellent!
Used three large chicken breasts and made made 11 pc's.
1.5 pc's per person was quite filling.
Cut water amount by 2/3.
Doubled spices as others suggested and reduced to almost all the water was gone.
Made 1.5x the amount of sauce.
Deep fry is the way to go!

Really tasty!!  I substituted half of the sour cream for cream cheese.. made it a bit less tangy that allowed the flavor of the green chilis (and added jalapenos) to really shine through.  Thank you!

I followed the recipe ingredients did not want to double anything until I tasted this first,except I did take the chicken out after 20 min of simmering and while I was shredding the chicken I let the juices reduce to the 1 cup did not want to over cook the chicken and I baked them at 400* for 15 min. poured the sauce over them and sprinkled more cheese on top of the sauce and put it back in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese. I'm glad I read the review and found that so many choose to bake. It was great!!! This recipe is a keeper, my husband really liked this and it was pretty easy to make. Thank you for sharing.

My husband always orders chimichangas when eating tex-mex but I've never made them until this recipe and he loved them. After I shredded the chicken I added more spices, cumin, garlic, onion powder and just a bit of chili powder. To prevent the tortillas from tearing or breaking you need to warm them first on your griddle or directly on the burner [whichever you choose]...this makes them much more pliable and easier to work with. Sour cream sauce was fabulosa...thanks for a really tasty recipe.!

This recipe went over very well with my family of six. I felt like baking them so I sprayed the cookie sheet and lightly brushed the chimichangas with olive oil before crisping in the oven. BTW, it took about an hour to reduce down the sauce but to me it was worth it. I also doubled the sour cream sauce because we LOVE sauce.

Thank you for the recipe!

I got lots of compliments on this from my husband, especially about the sauce.  I made this as written with only a few minor changes based on our preferences: I omitted the diced onion and used fat free sour cream. I also baked the chimichangas in the oven (by themselves without the sauce) for 18 minutes at 425 instead of frying.

I thought this recipe was delicious. IF I have one suggestion it would be to use medium to larger tortilla shells because the smaller ones (which I used)aren't as manageble (I like 'em BIG). And the sauce was the BOMB.COM!

Oh this is so good! My kids (12 & 9)love it.  I also baked the chimichangas instead of frying them.  I'm sure they'd be soooo good fried but made the healthier choice to bake them and they turned out great. The sour cream sauce is delicious! I didn't use green chiles as I didn't have any on hand and forgot to add them to the grocery list. Are they spicy? My kids are a little cautious of spicy stuff so maybe we wouldn't need them if they are. My husband and I put a little hot sauce on top if we feel like having them a little spicier.

Excellent! Chris although would prefer topping it with cheese instead of sour cream sauce but I thought it was good.  Could use half of water to speed up cooking time.

We really liked this recipe.  I did brush on some oil and baked in the oven vs frying and they were just great.  The first time I made the sauce, I seasoned it as suggested with salt and pepper and it was too salty.  Second time I made it, I left the salt out and it was fine.

I've followed this recipe pretty to the letter several times now and get rave reviews each time! The only small difference is that I use the seasoned water I had the chicken boiling in instead of adding the cup of plain water and a bouillon cube. I remove the shredded chicken after about 30 minutes of simmering and then let the stock reduce to a cup and half or so. I added a few pinches of harrissa and some fresh ground parmigiano reggiano to the sauce as well! I tried baking but prefer deep fried for about a minute as it crisps up the tortilla shell nicely!

These were absolutely scrumptious!!! I made them as written (mostly) and they were delicious! My 4-year old complained that they were a little too spicy for him (because of the green chiles), but my fiance and I both loved it. The only thing I changed was baked them instead of deep-frying. I brushed olive oil on top of each one and then baked them for about 10 min at 350 degrees F and then another 10 min at 450 degrees F (turning the pan around when necessary). They were super crunchy, yet not completely soaked in oil. Yay!

This was very good.  I baked it at 425 degrees for 15 minutes instead of deep frying it.  Shredding the chicken makes this longer prep, but it was good.  Next time I might just cut up the chicken before adding it the the pan.

Good, but only about half the amount of water is needed, and pull the chicken out early or it will get overcooked and dried out. The whole dish is very mild - I might choose pepper jack next time to liven it up a bit

The chicken chimichangas are very yummy! Will be making those again. The sauce, however, we didn't like at all. Tastes much better without it.

This recipe is really good.  My kids said it tastes like it came from a restaurant.  I used canned chicken breast and 1 packet of taco seasoning.  Thank You !!

I made these for a Cinco de Mayo party this past weekend (I know Chimis are not Mexican but from Tucson) and these were a huge hit.  I followed the recipe to a tee except added some softened butter to a few tablepoons of flour and then added into liquid that was remaining at the end to thicken it up a bit.  I forgot to add the cheese before wrapping them up, so that is an excuse to make them again this week to see how they are with the cheese added.  Huge thanks to the poster of this recipe!

Excellent recipe! Exactly like the mexican place my family loves. I followed a lot of other users advice and baked them instead of frying. It has become a favorite in our house and has made it into the rotation :)

Fantastic!!  I love the ease of this recipe and the flavor was excellent.  I did bake them rather than fry, but otherwise kept to the recipe.  The whole family really enjoyed them.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family loved how the meat tasted but not the fried tortilla part so I took the chicken mixture and used it in enchiladas and they were great.  I didn't make the sauce but I bet it would be really good enchilada sauce also.

Delicious! I was looking for a good chimichanga recipe because my husband's sensitive stomach can rarely handle the ones you get in Mexican restaurants. He devoured these! I did half the amount of chili powder; I tried the full amount but it was way too overpowering for us. I omitted cumin just because I didn't have any, and I used Kraft's mexican queso quesadilla shredded cheese instead of monteray jack. We're not big on sour cream, so instead of making this sauce I just sprinkled the remaining shredded cheese over the chimichangas. I baked at 425 for 15 minutes as recommended by another reviewer, but had to cover mine with foil so the cheese didn't burn and my chimichangas didn't get too crisp. Great left over as well; absolutely loved this recipe! Oh, don't use Aztec tortillas, they tear horribly.

Amazing! I only had a 4oz can of green chilies so I used 4 oz of salsa verde in the sour cream sauce.  We topped the chimichangas with tomatoes and sliced jalepenos. Definitely will make again but may make filling in advance. It took over an hour for the onion mixture to reduce down to 1 cup.

Very good!!! It took longer to cook down, but worth it. I was afraid it would be overload on spice, but not so. The only thing I did different was use half as much sauce as needed for the number of chimichangas I made. I had leftover chili's because of it & next time I'll use the full amount instead of cutting that back also. Will make again, but probably not to often because of the time, but I may make several bathches & freeze.

The meat was really yummy with the seasonings. I don't care for the warm sourcream. Like it cold ... like on Tacos. I served the Chimichangas with lettuce, tomatoes and Salsa.

I don't write a lot of reviews but had to this time.  These were FANTASTIC!  I made them just like the recipe directed and I also made some with taco meat, green chiles and cheese.  Gotta say, the chicken won!  In addition to the sour cream sauce, I made my favorite green sauce which is just a can of 'Hatch Brand' Green Sauce, 1 chk boullion cube, 1/2 tsp each garlic powder and onion powder, simmered on the stove top.  Just wanted to try them both.  :o)  One GREAT tip:  you can make a big batch and freeze them.  Just lay them on a cookie sheet with waxed paper and freeze, then transfer to a freezer bag.  Heat in a 400-425 oven until heated through.  Just as great as the first time!

Wonderful. Added almost double the spices with 3 chicken breasts, 3 cups of water and from start to finish (on the chicken mixture only) took 1 hour and 10 minutes to reduce down, etc. The sour cream sauce is delish! Topped with lettuce and tomato and made mexican rice and refried beans. Oh almost forgot I baked mine 425 for 8 minutes on each side, crispy and light!

Loved it!  Best recipe I have tried on this site!  But I didn't have all the ingredients so I had just did what I could and added in some other mixed seasoning thing.  I also baked them instead, 10 minutes in 425 degrees.  And the sour cream sauce was awesome too, my family loved it.  I used small tortillas and that worked fine.

I baked these instead of frying like many others.  Hubby whipped up some Margaritas to go along with it.  We loved it.  It was delicious!  It took a long time to make but I will still make this on occasion.

I just LOVED this recipe! It does take longer to cook down the 3 cups of water than I thought but it isn't a big deal. The sauce really added a great touch. I chopped up a few tomatoes and shredded some lettuce to serve on the side. Salsa of any kind would be another good addition. These were better than the ones I've had at restaurants and I will be making these again.

This was really great. Well seasoned and the Sour Cream Sauce will go great over steak. 
As recommended, I prepared the meat ahead of time. Wipped up sauce and filled and fried the chimichangas in about 15 to 20 minutes after work last night.

Delicious! I added fresh orange peppers to the chicken mix. I also added an additional boullion cube as the sauce had a strong flour taste. We loved it!

Really good..I read other reviews and for sauce used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup juices from chicken filling pot. Added xtra cumin, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne powder. Used only 1 T of chili powder. Otherwise, followed recipe. Must be deep fried - unless it is fried it isn't a chimichanga...then it is a burrito!

This is a great way to use leftover chicken. I changed it up a bit though. Instead of garlic and onion powders I used the real thing; diced up and cooked with the chicken and seasonings. Also, I added chopped mushrooms, green onions, and baby spinach instead of more garlic and onions. I  used fat free low sodium chicken broth instead of water and a bullion cube for the sauce. Last but not least I chose to cook it in a foreman grill instead of frying it in oil.

Soooooo good. Not sure the chicken has much flavor but the sauce is awesome! As another person suggested, I baked at 425 for 10-15 minutes instead of frying.

Went exactly by the recipe. It took about 2 hours for the seasoned water to cook down to 1 cup. The sauce was amazingly good. The filing was very good. The attempt to fill and roll was a disaster! I had only reserved 8 tortillas and the first two tore although I was being very careful. I managed to successfully roll 5 but even with toothpicks, the first one came apart in the fryer. I made 4 chimichangas and used the remaining pieces of tortillas, filling and cheese to make enchiladas and baked them 15 mins at 425. Next time I will use larger flour tortillas that are extremely fresh. Excellent tasting!

This is a very good chimichanga recipe.  After we finished dinner I realized i forgot the cheese, and my hubby still rated it one of the best things I have ever made.  I took the advice of another reviewer and didn't deep fry them and brushed olive oil on them and did convection oven at 400 degrees 5 minutes flipped and another 5 minutes.

So Good and Easy. The flavor is in the spice's, use a knife once,  for chopping onion and garlic, that's it. I followed the recipe ( suitable for kids) and the only thing I would "change" would be to double up on a spice to your liking to give it some Kick. And bake? no, no, no, would you make a chocolate cake without the sugar? Do this recipe the favor of deep, easy frying.

Excellent Dish! Before you even start, I highly recommend cooking the chicken in a crockpot and letting it simmer on low. I took a while to cook the chicken and the liquid down. I didn't have the cayenne pepper on hand so I ended up adding some hot sauce on top. It was bland without it. The cream sauce was slightly thicker than I had thought it would be so it might be wise to use 1 tbl of flour vice 2. Enjoy!

This recipe is time consuming, to say the least, but very worth the wait! I took others' advice, and doubled the seasoning - glad that I did. I did take the time to allow it to simmer to 1 C and it was delish, but next time, I will only start with 2-2 1/2 C. Like others, I baked, rather than frying. Glad I saved myself the calories, once I saw the nutritional info. Eek!! But worth the splurge. This was a favorite in my home and will def make it again!

Thought it was good but way too time-consuming and lots of clean-up.  You need to make sure the tortillas are very fresh and at room temperature or they crack when you roll them.

This sounds wonderful and I will be trying it in the near future.  But instead of 1 cup of water and 1 chicken bouillon cube, I will use 1 cup of top-quality chicken stock such as Kitchen Basics.  Much better flavor, plus bouillon cubes are all roughly 80% salt at least.    Also, I know it will add preparation time, but I will use fresh, sauteed garlic and onion instead of the powdered versions.  The powders have zero nutritional value and garlic powder in particular has a destinctively different taste than fresh garlic.  [No, I don't work for either Kitchen Basics or the garlic industry.]  Can't wait to try this.

This is really good, but there is too much chili powder for my taste.  I did double the other seasonings, and the only seasoning I could really taste was chili powder.  I will decrease next time, and hopefully get a chance to try the sour cream sauce!

I used 1 lb of chicken breast tenders. I minced my meat in my blender.i added cream of mushroom to the sauce. It came out so delicious and I didn't deep fry them either and I skipped the cayenne pepper.

The chicken alone was fabulous! All the spices in the boiling water created such juicy, flavorful chicken! I kept some aside to use for salad and tacos.

Easy and very yummy!  I didn't use the toothpicks, they stayed together just fine, used my tongs in the hot oil to hold the edge together.  The sour cream sauce was perfect and can be used on your egg dish in the morning, maybe a baked potato, etc!  Yum.

My wife and I are very picky.! We always stick to a new recipe when we first try it! Then we tweak it up to our taste. This recipe was spot on from jump street!!! Only suggestion it to double the sauce recipe!!!! We had more wraps than the recipe called for. Need that extra sauce for the next day. This was delicious!!!! We tried doing crab and shrimp the same way later in the week. That needed adjustments. Amazing chicken chimichanga recipe right here ! Total crowd pleaser right here !

These were really good!  I did increase the spice amounts,  1/2 tsp garlic powder and onion powder, 3/4 tsp salt.  I also cut the chicken breasts in half and used 2 cups of water instead of 3. Added the onion and garlic in the beginning.  Cook covered for 15 min and 30 min uncovered.   Was able to breack apart the chicken with a wooden spoon.

Made it at a friends request and she said it’s better than a local restaurants where we were first introduced to Brookies.  I did follow the recommendations of others to press the chocolate chips into the dough after spreading it into the pan(s).   I also used two pans so I separated the ingredients in half and it worked out well.  The total cook time was more like 35 minutes rather than the 20 minutes the recipe stated.  Will definitely make them again and next time use the recommended cooking dish to see if that makes a difference.   Definitely recommend!

This recipe has become a family favorite, as well as a family reunion favorite. We've made it at our last three reunions, and every chimichanga is eaten. I make it just like the recipe, although I try to make 60 or more to meet the demand. I wouldn't change a thing.

Turned out very good. I didn't have any ground cumin or onion powder and didn't feel like going to the store, but it turned out very good without it. I also made it with 4 chicken breast instead of 2 and have lots of left over chicken in the freezer for an easy meal at a later date. Sour cream sauce turned out super good and it's something I can see making to dip regular chips in. Maybe add a little something to spice it up for chips.

Very good, basic guideline. Followed directions and came out great. My crowd tends to like spicier things. Will increase spices next time

It was good, I didn’t fry them I baked them at 425F for 15 min after brushing them with some lime infused olive oil. I also think i will try doubling the spices next time as it had a very subtle flavour.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the ingredients exactly but instead of frying I brushed it with olive oil and baked it in the oven at 425 for 10 minutes and it turned out amazing! Will definitely be making again.

BEST CHIMICHANGA EVER! I have been making recipes from All Recipes for years and this is without a doubt my favorite all time recipe. The deep frying process is quick. Make sure you flip it half way through. Every plate at the table was cleaned before it hit the dishwasher. It’s easy to prepare in advance and simply assemble and fry right before you are ready to eat. I placed salsa on the table but the taste was so good, nobody used it. A side of torn lettuce is all you need.

DELICIOUS! I cooked the chicken one day. Next day I rolled the chimichangas, sprayed with olive oil and baked them in the oven. I made the sour cream sauce while they baked and it came out awesome! I can’t wait to make these again.

This was good.  I made the chicken per the recipe, but I opted to bake instead of frying. Didn't make the sauce, just made queso and had the sour cream on the  side.  Served with Spanish rice. It was a pretty good dinner.

Generally I’m not a fan of chicken in Mexican food, so I wasn’t sure if I should try this at all. The sour cream sauce is what intrigued me and caused me to try it anyway. The long list of ingredients looks daunting, but it all worked out well. And, in fact, I think the meat mixture could be made ahead and used when needed. The sour cream sauce was easy enough, and the finished product was better than I had expected.  My husband, who doesn’t care for homemade Mexican food, thought this was every bit as good as what is made at our favorite Mexican place, and he wants me to make it again. (Huge compliment!) I recommenced this recipe to anyone who enjoys chimichangas made at home for very little cost. We will definitely share the recipe with friends!

This is our new Family Favorite.  Don't substitute and you will be pleased.  I have made it both deep fried and also baked and everyone agrees it tastes better deep fried.  Try not to use a can of green chili  as they sometimes put citric acid in the can which can prevent the sour cream sauce from cooking right.  Use fresh green pepper or jalapeno.

OMG!! Better than restaurant taste! I used the instant pot to cook the chicken and reduce the sauce using the sautee function. Since i didn't have canned chili peppers, I used a few tablespoons of picante salsa. Also, I subbed homemade Greek yogurt for sourcream and homemade butterkäse for Monterey Jack, as I ran out of the latter.  I fried the chimichangas for about 1.5 minutes in my fryer at 375. Perfect!  I'm sure the recipe is great when followed to a Tee, but you have to improvise here and there when you don't have all the ingredients. Thanks for the recipe and video.

I didn't have any diced chilies but I had diced chilies and tomatoes so the sauce came out a different color but still was good. I doubled the sauce recipe and I'm glad I did. My husband loved the sauce.  We will definitely make this again.

Very tasty! I used my instant pot to cook the chicken since it was frozen, 12 minutes on high. I also baked the chimis at 425 for 15 minutes instead of frying. Turned out great, will make again!

HOLY TAMALES! These are amazing. I didn't make the sour cream sauce as my daughter is picky, but sssooooo good with just sour cream. I've used the cumin mix that you boil the chicken in several times on different chicken recipes when I've been stuck on what to season with and it's worked on so many levels with so many dishes. We make this on a monthly basis. my daughter asks me to make it everytime we plan out our menu and she NEVER asks for repeats. Hands down 5 stars!

Very tasty. Followed the directions exactly, but halved the quantities since there is just two of us. My wife, who is a Mexican food aficionado, says make it again any time, and that's the definitive test!

This is a Great Recipe.  My new favorite Chimichanga.  I added black beans in with the chicken.  Also used boneless thighs instead of breasts.   It was really good.  You can also take some shortcuts such as using taco seasoning mix in place of the spices.  Overall an excellent recipe.

Wow this was delicious! I only had one 4oz can of green chilies so I put 3oz in with meat and one ounce in sour cream sauce and it turned out fine. I also sautéed onions and garlic before putting them in.  Will be making this again.

It was a hit!  My family enjoyed it so much.  My typically picky eater keeps asking when I can make it again.  I made mine a tad less spicy to meet the needs of my young kids so it wasn't so spicy for them.  We will make it again.

It's so easy and a hit with everyone.  I always make twice the chicken and just double the ingredients.  The left over chicken (after shredded) that you don't use is always great on salads!!!  It's so full of flavor and a great protein!

Good mix on the filling but too much water. And I added more seasonings per other reviews. And  Per other reviews I didn't make the sauce. Pure sour cream and chopped green onions works for me.  Cooked sour cream/flour  gravy doesn't  sound interesting.  But that's just me.   It makes for a good chicken tortilla soup topped with shredded jack cheese, crumbled tortilla chips and a big dollop of sour cream.  Also makes for good burritos wrapped in foil and toasted a few minutes on the George Foreman grill if you want to avoid the hassle of frying or baking
Thanks for recipe.  Overall it was good.

loved it! I used a can of rotel in place of the green chilies because that's what I had, and it was delicious! I also baked in the oven instead of frying as others suggested. will definitely make this a regular!

I deep fried then and followed the recipe to the T. I did use a 3 mix of cheese(Habanero mix), spicy but soooo good. They had a wonderful crisp from the deep fried.

I used bone in chicken thighs then boned after cooking. Homemade salsa on white rice. Vegetable medley sautéed in some chicken grease from main recipe.  Doubled recipe portions.  Brushed oil on tortilla and backed at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. Really good!  Will be part of my rotation.

Couldn't find monterey Jack by itself at Save A Lot so we used the white queso in some then a monterey jack cheddar mix in some.  Also added some hot sauce to chicken mix.  Beyond that we followed the recipe for the most part.  Chicken was bone in though.  Got whatever was cheaper!

This is so good. I accidentally forgot to add the cheese to the wrap, so I put the cheese in the sour cream sauce. It tasted awesome. I also baked them at 425 for 15 minutes after brushing them with oil. The bonus is that I had leftover sauce so the next day I added more cheese and made mac and cheese, which made for a spicy delight.

This review is for the recipe as is. Normally I am not adventurous food wise, so I was a little to try this recipe out. This tasted amazing! First off, that sour cream sauce is to die for! Second, I never boiled chicken before. When I was breaking the chicken apart, it looked dry. I figured it would make the whole meal taste bland. This wasn't the case! Whenever I bit into it when everything was said and done, the chicken was flavorful and moist! That sauce definitely made the meal though. This is definitely a keeper for the recipe book!

This recipe is SO much work but SO worth it. I've made it several times. I now have my own variations for the sauce. Needs a little bit of salsa and a lot of Monterey jack cheese. Love the sauce that way!

As other reviewers have already mentioned, I did find 3 cups of water a bit too much.. I also wish I had added less (probably half or so) water to the sour cream sauce. I ended up simmering the sauce down a bit because of the water making it a little bland. 4 Stars for the recipe as written, 5 stars after these changes. Turned out very delicious. I will be making these again

The only thing I plan on doing different during the next go around is to use the larger tortillas. With the size recommended you are limited to the amount of filling. But, that being said, my new favorite recipe from allrecipes.

Hit the spot! I just moved from Texas to Michigan and can't seem to find any good Mexican/Tex Mex here so I made these and they were soooo good! I doubled the spices as others suggested and made the sour cream sauce using roasted poblano peppers and added cheese to it. I also baked them instead of frying.  Will definitely be making again!

I'm so glad I read the reviews before I made this dish.  Like others, I doubled the seasonings and used broth instead of water; no bullion needed.  After reducing the liquid, I used the leftover in the cream sauce.  It added so much extra flavoring.  I used my corn tortillas to make taquitos and I used 2 leftover flour tortillas to make chimichangas.  I have an air fryer, so there was no need to deep fry, 10 minutes at 390.

This was amazing.  Both my husband & I went back for seconds.  We kept all the ingredients the same, but changed up the technique for the filling just a bit.  To start, I sautéed the onions & garlic in a saucepan.  Once they were caramelized, I added the dry seasonings & mixed well.  Next, I added in the water & chilis, blended all together & then added in the chicken.  The water didn't quite cover the top of the chicken, so I cooked it 15 min on one side & flipped the chicken & cooked 15 min on the other side.  The cooking time was perfect to reduce down the sauce & have the chicken ready for shredding.  Everything else was prepared exactly as written.  The filling ended up being enough for 9 shells, so we have leftovers for another dinner.  We'll be adding this recipe to the rotation for sure.

Update 12/18: This recipe continues to be a regular feature in our dinner rotation with the technique adjustments outlined above.  We  recently got an air fryer, and tried cooking the finished chimis in that instead of a deep fryer.  Brush lightly with oil, set to 350, and cook 5 minutes, flip & cook another 5 minutes.  Delicious and way less fat!

Great recipe with a lot of flavor.  Based on other reviewers' comments, I cut down on the liquid and doubled the spices.  Definitely the right amount of spark for our family. We also baked them for about 15 minutes at 400, turning them over about halfway through.  Next time, and there will be a next time very soon, I plan to double the chicken filling and freeze half for later.  A new dish in our rotation for sure.

I give this 5+ stars for the sauce alone. Oh my goodness. I did my own thing for the chimichangas (used shredded chicken, can of black beans, can of diced tomatoes, some rice, and my taco seasoning mix - simmered, then topped with just a little cheese, then baked at 400 for about 10 minutes). For the sauce, I forgot that it called for broth so I just used water and the taste was amazing. Definitely something different than our usual "top with salsa." I covered the baked chimis with the sour cream/green chili sauce after it came out of the oven. 
I don't think I'll even use broth next time, it was fine with water. The sour cream and green chilies were amazing flavors without it. 
Great base recipe that everyone can tweak to their personal preferences or what's on hand in the cupboard.

My family loves this recipe. Since everyone in this household is a picky eater, I stuck with just the seasoning for the meat. The sauce is delicious. And of course top it off with hot sauce ??

Absolutely fantastic!! Incredibly fast and easy. . I made a couple very minor changes to adapt to what I had on hand.  Rather than regular chili powder I used Gebharts. Why? Because I swear by Gebharts, it's all I ever use. I also substituted fresh hatch green chilis for the canned because, again, it's what I had on hand (roasted them in my broiler first) then used 1 tsp of low sodium chicken bouillon because the cubes leaves food way more salty than we like. I didn't deep fry them in 3" of oil, instead I poured just enough olive oil into my skillet to roll them around in to get that fried surface. I prefer Olive oil for most everything but it's gotten a little expensive so I conserve on the amount I use when it won't have much if any effect on the outcome. The sour cream sauce made exactly to the recipe is pure heaven.  Because I used hatch chilies mine, of course, had a little more bite than the canned green chilies have. Served with a small bowl of pinto beans and a kitchen sink (all the fresh fixings) green salad with salsa as the dressing. Bottom line is these are 5 stars all the way.

I always forget to pull meat out of the freezer, this has become my go to pressure cooker recipe. The only thing I changed is deep frying the chimichangas. As another reviewer suggested, I brush olive oil on them and then bake them to golden brown at 425 for 29 minutes, turning halfway through. I serve with guacamole, refried beans, and shredded lettuce on the side. Delicious.

This recipe is absolutely superb! The taste is so wonderful and it is simple even though it sounds so challenging. 
I did make a few changes though being 1) I did not use a bullion cube ( none on hand), instead I used that delicious juice the chicken simmered in for so long! 2) I used half the amount of Green chiles (4.5oz can) in fear of it being too hot... what can I say? I'm a gringo.
I will definitely be making this again with how highly it was raved about.

I made recipe as it is written minus the chicken bullion cube, I just used straight chicken broth. Awesome recipe! I have also made this baked and it was even better baked than fried! A huge winner and I never follow recipes because I always feel I can make them better but this was one was perfect as is.

The meat itself needed more seasoning , but the sauce was so good having extra seasoning didn't matter. I will make it again, but will try it in the oven instead of frying next time.

Baked it at 400 for 20 minutes after brushing with olive oil.  Added extra spices based on other reviews, and it may have been a little too much of the cumin or cayenne pepper.  Loved the sauce, even though I didn't use any peppers for the sauce.  Added rice to the inside, which made it a little too gummy.  Added tomatoes with chiles and it was a nice touch.

My boyfriend and I loved this!!  Only thing we changed is using jalapeños instead of green chilies in the sauce and blended the sauce after the onions were cooked down bc he doesn't like the texture of onions and we just pan browned them. Excellent!!

I used the large can of green chilies with the chicken and used a small 4oz can for the sour cream sauce.  I used a combination of queso blanco, queso fresco, and pepper jack for the cheese.  The recipe made 7 seven large chimi's and my husband insisted I put all of the left overs in the fridge, because they would all be eaten!

I boiled the chicken in chicken broth instead of water  and doubled all of the spices except for the chili powder. I also added a half teaspoon of chipotle powder. I just threw everything (including the onion and green chillies) into the pot to cook on a low heat with the chicken. It took about an hour and a half for the liquid to boil down to about a cup, but it tasted soooo good. I think next time I'll do everything the same except put it in a crock pot and let it cook all day. The sour cream sauce was excellent, by the way!

This is our go to recipe for chicken filling. The whole family loves it! I have made it as written, but also w/can of rotel instead of green chilies. And reduced the water. We have also added black beans and different cheeses to the filling inside, before frying. I "seal" the edges with a little water and fry carefully so toothpicks are not necessary.

I really enjoyed this recipe. However I did adapt it somewhat to meet my needs for the ingredients I already had at my house.
For instance, instead of chicken breasts, I used about a pound of frozen chicken tenderloins that I had in my freezer.
Second, instead of all the teaspoon measurements of various ingredients, I just used 1/4 of a cup of taco seasoning as a substitute. I used an whole onion (a little more than 1/2 cup) and used minced garlic instead of fresh garlic. Also I had some leftover freshly shredded Sharp cheddar cheese from the night before, so I used that instead of Monterrey Jack. As far as the sour cream sauce went though, I followed that exactly and it was delicious. Also I used 6 in tortillas instead of 8. This is an easy, and highly adaptable recipe to fit almost anyone's needs. I definitely recommend it.

Very tasty recipe. I imagine you could change it up a bit, but really no need...this recipe stands on its own. Restaurant quality!

This turned out awesome.   Instead of frying, I brushed on some olive oil (gave it that crunch) and baked at 400 for about 15 minutes, turning once. My husband is not a big fan of sour cream, so I added some canned green enchilada sauce and shredded cheese instead of the sour cream sauce,  for the last 8 minutes or so.

Yum! I didn't have green chilies so used a chunky salsa instead.  Fantastic! I will most definitely be making this again! Plus my picky husband loved it as well! Big bonus

I have used almost this exact same recipe to make enchiladas. just roll the chicken mixture in the tortilla and place in a casserole dish. cover them all with sauce and bake in the oven. I like a 10 inch tortilla.

amazing. ...my kids who Hate green chilies had 3rds!  I did everything as directed except sautéed the onions and spices in some water  and oil because I used a rotisserie chicken, so didn't need to boil. thanks this is a keeper

This is delicious!  I have made it many times, and I always double the spices, and add a can of corn, an entire chopped onion, and a chopped bell pepper to the meat mixture.  Then I bake the chimichangas at 425 for about 10 minutes, and serve with the delicious sauce in the recipe and also rice with seasoned black beans.  Very yummy.

I always order Chicken Chimichangas at Mexican restaurants, but I can honestly say that I have never had a Chimichanga that compares to this one.  It was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding the cheese to the chicken mixture before frying since I didn't have any.  It was still amazing!

Followed the recipe (minus onions since I did not have any on hand) and used chicken thighs instead of breasts (thawed the wrong bag) was very pleased how it turned out. An easy weeknight meal. I'd definitely make this again.

This was so tasty I keep thinking about it and wish I had more. I made it for my sister and her family and she sent me a text saying she keeps thinking about the tasty chimichangas lol. I didn't have Monterey cheese so I used cheddar and then I accidentally put in extra garlic powder. I used a little extra of the chilies too. Wow that was nummy nummy :)

Really good! Though I just threw everything in with the chicken at the beginning so I cheated. We also didn't fry them but brushed with oil and baked at 425. Didn't care for the sauce but we prefer Daisy sour cream on everything.

Absolutely Delicious! I used a few less chillies in the sauce, only because all I had were fresh ones from the garden which were quite hot. The water over the chicken took longer than expected to boil down, but it was well worth It!

This was very good!  I only added 2 cups water based on others, and I baked at 400 for 15 or so minutes. I was expecting a little more flavor with the sauce, and we wound up with too much of it, so next time I'll just reduce the amount of butter or sour cream (or both), or try something else. The flavor of the chimi itself was great!  A lot of ingredients, and takes a little time, but pretty easy and very good!  Thank you!

Ive been making these for 2 years now. There are a few things I do different. I use twice the spice and I use the same about of liquid. But i cook it for 2-3 hours like I would when cooking anything else I plan to shred. I cool until most of the liquid is gone, remove the chicken shred and return it to the pot and mix so the chicken absorbs the rest of the liquid, that way all the flavour is absorbed! So good! I also use a spiced montery jack cheese or guda! Both good mentling cheeses

One of my family's favorite recipes. Only change I make is I add a bouillon cube to the 3 cups of water to add more flavor to the chicken while it's cooking. Then I don't have to add it when making the sauce and the whole dish has a lot more flavor.

I did not add the cayenne pepper.  I was afraid it would be too hot for my little ones.  I have a 9, 6, and 3 year old.  It turned out fabulous.  Everyone licked their plates clean.  My 3 year old ate an entire chimichanga.  This dish isn't a quick fix for dinner, but it is delicious and will be added to our monthly rotation.??

I made these and everyone loved them. I took the advice of everyone else and added double the seasoning. I added garlic salt and cayenne pepper to the sauce and omitted the chillies in the sauce. I did triple the sauce recipe and added a quarter cup

This probably the best recipe I have ever tried from All Recipes. It is absolutely delicious. As other reviewers stated, you must be PATIENT and let the water cook down. Trust me, the flavor and tenderness of the chicken is worth the wait. I doubled the cumin and onion powder. I also used minced garlic (doubled) instead of garlic powder. My kids don't like spicy foods yet so I only used 1/2 tsp of chili powder and barely a pinch of cayenne. For the sour cream sauce, I used chicken broth so I omitted the water and bouillon. I don't deep fry so I basted the tops of the chimichangas with melted butter and baked at 400 10-15 mins. TRULY OUTSTANDING! I make Mexican Rice II from the is site religiously and as another reviewer stated, it is a great accompaniment. I topped my chimichangas with a bit of guac and oh my gosh. Phenomenal.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!  I have made this several times, it's become a fav of ours...We do double the spice, just cuz we like the heat, and I started adding cheese into the sauce.  I can honestly say, that when we go out to eat, I use to ALWAYS order the chimichanga...well, now I dont cuz it wont stand up to the flavor in this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

this is our new family favorite!! the only change i made was adding homemade refried beans. I cook my pintos then I fry them in bacon grease while Im mashing them.  So I put a plop of beans in the tortilla with the chicken and cheese.  they were to DIE for!!!  We love this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is the closest thing to (and possibly better than) what you get in Mexican restaurants!  Will probably make the chicken filling the day before to let the spices really settle into the mixture......but it was so good, I'm not so sure there is any room for improvement!!   :-)

Loved this recipe! Followed exactly besides baking at 400 degrees for 15 mins & using 1 1/2 cups water instead of 3, as other reviewers suggested. Served with mexican corn and ended with my boyfriend and I in a happy food coma! Will definitely be making this again soon.

The whole family LOVED this meal, I'm still getting compliments! I took some advice from the other reviews here and doubled the spices and used fresh garlic instead of powder.  I also just about doubled the sour cream for the sauce, I felt like it needed more.  Turned out wonderful, definitely going to be on of our regular recipes.

I followed previous reviews and doubled the spices. I used chicken thighs, and put them and the doubled spices, green chilies, onions & garlic in the slow cooker. No water. I let them cook on low all day, then drained and shredded the chicken. I made a double batch of sauce, and because the sour cream had gotten towards the back of the refrigerator, and was mostly frozen, I put in the whole 16 oz carton. My husband likes sour cream so he was okay with that. I sprayed the chimis with canola spray, and baked them in a 450 oven for 15 minutes. It all turned out terrific.

Absolutely amazing taste.  I would make this once a week.  I did have to make a few changes because I thought I had boullion and did not. I substituted 1 can (14.5oz) of chicken stock for the water and had to use poultry seasoning salt and pepper in the cream sauce.  I also bought the wrong tortillas and used ten inch but with the same proportion of filling.  This allowed me to wrap them quite tightly and did not need to use a toothpick in the ends.  After the first 15 minutes I started shredding up the chicken into smaller pieces and continued to let cook just like the directions.  After the second fifteen minutes I shredded the chicken right in the mixture and let it simmer down the rest of the way.  I also added poultry seasoning to the raw chicken and then doubled the rest of the spices except the chili powder.  I generally do not rate recipes I am not following to the letter but this was too fabulous to not comment on.  My only complaint would be the tortilla flavor.  I used mission but the shell did not turn out as well as I have had in restaraunts.  I do not know what they use to wrap with though so these are a fair enough substitute.  The rest of the flavors are amazing.  The next time I will make the filling the day before and reheat to fill.  I think they would be even more flavoful, but there are no leftovers to judge by this time around ~ Thank you for my new favorite chicken dish. Yum!!!

Excellent, but a little bit of work.  I froze half of the meat filling and used it later, which made preparation a little easier.  Definitely going to keep this recipe on hand!  Thanks for sharing!  Also loved the sour cream sauce...so easy, creamy and delicious!

This recipe is AMAZING!!!!  Like others we bake them in the oven after brushing with olive oil for about 20 minutes on 420ish. The chicken does cook in about 20 minutes so I take out and shred and keep warm while the sauce reduces a little more.   Also i doubled the spices as well.  Thank you SSTRAWDER.  Awesome

I substitute the powered onion and garlic for fresh and use chicken broth. I also use a homemade cheese sauce instead of the sour cream sauce. My dad LOVES when I make these.

FANTASTIC!!! The only thing I did differently was I added chicken bouillon in with the chicken and although this may seem like it won't go, I added BBQ sauce to it as well, I found this really helped with the flavor and the family plus neighbours devoured it, the only thing that we were disappointed with is that there weren't any leftovers!

This is an outstanding recipe. After shredding the chicken and adding it back to the liquid, I reduced it down quite a bit. It takes some practice frying these suckers so test it out before serving to company. I used Crema Supremo for the sour cream. You can find it in the Mexican refrigerated aisle at most grocery stores. It is creamier than American sour cream. YUM!

Took the advice of others and doubled the spices, using fresh garlic and baked them in the 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes after brushing with olive oil rather than deep frying.  My kids said "Good job, Mom!"  Thank you Allrecipes,com cooks, you are making me look great!!

Sooo good! Only thing is you should really use chicken broth instead of bouillon for the sauce.  the bouillon creates an unappetizing nuclear yellow coloured sauce which just ends up being very salty, imho.  Leave lots of time for the chicken to cook nice and slow!  My mouth is watering just thinking about this recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Avoid if you are in a hurry though.  It does take a while to cook the chicken but worth it.  The sauce can be a little 'floury' but is easily remedied by adding a little white mexican cheese.  These are great warmed up for lunch the next day too.

I make this all the time, it's one of my family's favorites! It may not be the fastest meal to make, but since my family doesn't always like the same thing, it's definitely worth it to me.

Very yum :) I use this recipes for our enchiladas as well. I use chicken thighs instead of breast and it is fantastic. My family loves the sauce and they are not sour cream fans.

OUTSTANDING! I cannot say enough about the great flavor of this dish.   I used my own El Toro sauce.   My daughter went on and on about how it was better than our favorite Mexican restaurant's version.  Next time I'm going to double the recipe and freeze half for later.   Thanks for sharing.  I didn't change a thing!

I have made these numerous times and my family just loves them! Per others suggestions, I go heavy on the seasonings by doubling them. Also, my local Mexican market makes fresh homemade whole wheat tortillas  so I bake them with some olive oil. YUMMY!!

I don't often leave a recipe as is, but I tried this one just as the author said and it turned out perfectly! The next time we made them I didn't want to get the fryer out on a weeknight, so I made them as enchiladas with the sauce on the top. They were a little bit soggy, but they still tasted delicious! I think the key if you want to make them is to make the filling a day ahead and reduce the liquid down to almost nothing so that they have all of the flavor without the mess. Love this recipe!

I have made this multiple times! The flavor is fantastic! Real green chili to which I always have in hand, makes it all the more wonderful! Make sure to reduce all but 1 cup, it makes chicken flaky. I doubled up on spices. I also rolled mixture into flour tortillas, placed in pan, brushed with olive oil and baked until golden brown! Delish!!

this recipe is so easy and so delicious. I followed with some other reviewer said and I actually bake them in my convection oven at 425 for 5 minutes each side and they turn out great.

These are wonderfully delicious. I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2 and doubled the spices.  I took advice of others and shredded the chicken as it was boiling.  I had used the meat the first night as fajitas (which was scrumptious) and had leftover sauted onions and green peppers, so I put some of these inside too.  Next time I would use a larger shell only because my husband and I would both prefer them to be larger.  I brushed them in olive oil and baked at 425 degrees for 12 minutes.

We have made this twice now, by the book, and it is incredibly good.  And it works just as well as a non-fried burrito, if you don't want the extra hassle and calories of deep fry.  We've had them both ways, just a great recipe.

Prepare the chicken ahead of time, and what a great, easy meal for football parties, stc.  

Thanks SStrawder for a great recipe that we will use a lot!

Wow! And I don't give many 5 stars. Just double the sauce. I get 2 Costco chickens and debone with food gloves (also at Costco). Make 20 at a time. More diced chili's.

So yummy! My husband loved it! Even my 2 year old liked it (except for the chilies).  Be careful when you fry, bc when the juices from the inside of the chimichanga hit the hot oil it sprays like crazy! I will make this over and over again....it's one of those easy dishes that makes guests think you're an amazing chef bc they think it must be hard to make. Plus, the ingredients are pretty cheap so it's grocery budget friendly!

This was an awesome recipe. Takes a bit of time to make but well worth it. This was as good as going out to a Mexican restaurant. I took others advice and made it in the oven. It worked out perfect.

Delicious! I had never had chimichangas before, but I've heard about them. When I saw this recipe I thought i'd be a fun meal to try. The chimichangas were awesome! Nice and crispy, great seasoning and kinda fun to make! The verdict is still out on the sour cream sauce though. Mines was way too salty and even if it wasn't so salty, im not sure it added anything to the meal, but it wasn't bad. I ate this with beans and rice and avocado. I will definitely make this again, though next time I may not make the sauce.

Epic fail.  Everything was going great until I put them into the deep fryer.  At that point every one of them fell apart, dumping most of their contents into the hot oil, and resulting in an inedible mass of burnt chicken cheese crisps over greasy deep-fried tortilla.  Then I went back and watched the video.  I see now how they are supposed to be folded and pinned, and may try this again, but I doubt it.

Agree w/ making the chicken filling beforehand. Double seasonings. Convection oven (brush w/ olive oil). This recipe is fabulous and I will make this frequently.  Thank you SSTRAWDER!!!!!

This recipe is awesome!  I did do a couple of things that were suggested in the previous reviews; such as doubling the spices and baking them at 425 for 15 minutes. My husband always says, "why go to a Mexican restaurant when my wife makes the best Mexican food." This recipe really tops it off!   Thank You

awesome recipe! the only thing I would recommend is to warm the flour tortillas first before you add chicken mixture and cheese. it makes them easier to fold.

These were delicious! All gone in one night. Next time I will double the recipe at lease so I can have some to freeze. The only things I changed was after adding the spices as called for...I added a heaping tablespoon of home made taco seasoning-II from Allrecipes. Also I used 2 lg fresh diced jalapenos rather than the can peppers. A big Hit!

Made this tonight. I like everything about it. I just wish that it was slightly less spicy for my young daughters. If I want to do a kid-friendly recipe, I would probably cut out the jalapenos, but maybe do another pepper, such as bell pepper for flavor.

The sauce is delicious. I only want to know what to do with the yummy leftover broth made from cooking the meat. Thanks.

absolutely loved this recipe! I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices, but still used 3 cups water. I have a ton of jalapenos from my garden so used them in place of the chilies. Used sharp cheddar cheese because that's what I had on hand. Instead of frying (which I'm sure they'd be delicious!) I tried to save a few calories and brushed them with olive oil and baked for 15 min at 425. Served on a bed of lettuce with the sour cream sauce and sprinkled more cheese on top. DELISH!!!

We loved these. I replaced the green chilis with Mexican Rotel tomatoes. The sauce thickened faster than expected so I drained  1/2 cup of liquid into the sauce to thin and added the sour cream just before serving. My Hubbs LOVED this.

Just made this last night...It was AMAZING!!!  I took the advice of some reviewers and doubled the spices in the chicken.  I left out the cayenne pepper(I don't like too spicy).  Shredded the chicken and put it back in the spice liquid mixture to get the flavor all through the chicken.  My husband & son & I LOVED this!!!  The sour cream sauce is so good, you could use it for dip with tortilla chips....

My husband loved the sour cream sauce!  I'm going to try this again using some of my own shredded chicken, which I make in the slow cooker bi-weekly.  Perhaps I can make the onion sauce first (I suspect it will reduce faster without the chicken in it) then add my shredded chicken to warm and absorb the flavors.  It's worth a try.  This was fun to make.  Also, I baked them (@425 for 18mins) but only after brushing liberally with olive oil (which also helps it roll up without breaking).  I'm sure the fried ones are even yummier.

I made it with 5 chicken breasts just added a bit more of everything else.
It came out delicious.

It is time consuming, but worth it.  I was told better then a restaurants.

I really liked this recipe! A first for chimichangas, my family loved it. I don't trust myself with hot oil - so those babies went in the oven!

I wanted a simple sauce recipe for veggie enchiladas & this worked nicely. I didn't care for the "grainy" taste but I may have under whisked? I used chicken broth instead of water to give it more flavor. I will use again and adapt flavor. Hubby & baby enjoyed dinner so it's good enough for me! Thanks. :)

This recipe is amazing!! This is one of my favorites!! It does take awhile to make, but it is well WORTH it! The only thing different that I did was I only used 2 cups of water and I doubled the sour cream sauce. This is VERY delicious and I make it all the time! My husband doesn't like fried food, so I bake his and it's good that way too. Heck, it's even good without a tortilla if you just want to plate the chicken mix and top with sour cream sauce!

I followed the recipe as is:
I thought the chimis were great, but the sauce lacked flavor. It was just like creamy sour cream, nothing special. Also, there's got to be an easier way to roll these without the tortilla ripping. I'll make these again but avoid boiling the chicken, 3 cups of water took forever to boil down.

My family loves this recipe. The only change I mades was I cooked the chicken with all the spices in the crockpot on low for 6 hours, then transferred it to the stove top to reduce the liquid before shredding the chicken.  The chicken was more flavorful this way.  We will definitely make this again. Becky

Moved a few months ago from PA where there was a Restaurant named Fiesta Ole, they had some excellent chicken chimichangas, I missed them sooooo... much until today. I decided to look for a recipe on them and came across this one.  Thank You SSTRAWDER!!! Although I had leftover cooked chicken, I decided to give this one a whirl by boiling the leftover chicken in water and all the spices and veggies provided in the recipe, (also added some leftover chopped green pepper I had in the fridge so that it didn't go to waste) and then made the sr cr sauce exactly as stated with the exception of scaling the servings down to just 3 for both.  It came out so good, I was bragging about it. I don't even think about missing the chimichangas at that restaurant back home. Thanks again!!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I would change nothing. Even my husband who uses no condiment ever on his food loved the sour cream sauce and has plains on using it with other meals. Will make this over and over again.

Ok, I'm eating these as I am typing this. They are SO good that I wanted to do the rating while it was fresh in my head. I did have to change one thing only because I went to the store and they didn't have green chili's. I just chopped a green pepper in half and boiled it in with the chicken. I will definitely make it as written next time but they could only be more amazing with the green chili's. My daughter said they are her new favorite and she wants them tomorrow night lol. LOVE when I make something that becomes a new favorite! Thanks for a fabulous recipe. Very simple recipe too.

Turned out great!!! My husband and two year old son went to town, so we will definitely have it again someday. I deviated from the recipe a little but not too much. I was heavy handed with the seasoning and used a cup or so leftover broth from the chicken(before shredding chicken) instead of the bouillon cube for the cream sauce, also used a Mexican four cheese blend instead of the Jack.

This was soooo good! I did everything exactly and let the chicken sit in the seasoned juices for a while. Doing this let the chicken really pick up the flavors. Th only other thing I did was add cheese to the sauce!

I thought it was overall pretty good. I think the meat had good flavor, I used bone in chicken thighs and also substituted some of the water with chicken broth. The only thing questionable was the sour cream sauce. Mine came out very watery and I had to use more flour to thicken it up some. But I would make it again.

These were so good!  I made the chicken filling ahead of time and did add 3 cups of water.  The liquid will definitely dilute down to 1 cup but the time stated wasn't long enough for it to do so.  I took the chicken out after the 2nd 15 minutes and let the liquid reduce that way, then added the chicken back in.  The sour cream sauce is delicious!  My husband loved them also and asked I could add them to our regular recipe rotation:)

these were a hit at dinner. A couple minor changes....but nothing that changed it drastically. I added 1 TB of cilantro (because I really like cilantro) and used half cheddar/half Jack as that is what I had on hand. I made them with Chef John's Flour Tortillas from this site . The homemade tortillas really made the dish and they were very easy to make.

Use the liquid from the chicken cooking for sauce in addition to the 1cup of chicken broth. Double the spices. double the chicken. Add some cream cheese with the sour cream to the sauces.

I've been meaning to make this recipe for weeks now and finally got to it tonight - delicious!!

I made a few modifications as I discovered I was out of a few things as I went along...

The other reviews are dead on about the time it takes for the sauce to simmer down for the chicken. It takes a long time but next time I'll use a little less water and start the sour cream sauce later.

The sour cream sauce was wonderful!!!

For the chicken, I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I upped the black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon and upped the garlic to 1/2 teaspoon. 

I also discovered I was out of toothpicks, so I decided to bake them at 425 for about 20 minutes with a little cheese sprinkled on top. 

Fantastic! Served with some spanish rice and it was a hit.

The best!  And it's become a favorite of friends also.  I make thisat least every 3-4 weeks.  I use chicken broth instead of water, double all spices, use a 7oz can of chilis in the chicken, and a separate 4oz can of chilis in the sauce.  Baked at 425 degrees for 15-20 min.  And as a BONUS - a second meal!  Take the leftover sauce from cooking the chicken, along with any leftover chicken, heat it up the next day and it makes a great Chilaquiles sauce.  Nothing goes to waste.  Use good quality thick tortilla chips and a good white cheese, wonderful!

Wonderful!!  Loved it!  The only thing I changed was the sour cream sauce.  I would have loved it but the other 4 members of my family wouldn't have tried it so I just used Queso Blanco with Jalopeno's instead.  Great!!!

I made this almost like sour cream chicken enchiladas...I don't like fried foods.... I doubled the sour cream sauce added cheese to the chicken mixture inside the homemade tortillias poured the sauce on top added some shredded cheese and popped them in the oven for fifteen minutes.  Served with chopped tomatoes on top.  The chicken mixture is very very flavorful.  I used 4 frozen chicken breasts with the same amount of water. Didnt have cumin but used mexican chili powder mix with the rest and fresh grated garlic.  Made several times now the fam loves it!!  Great Recipe!

The best part about this recipe is the sauce, very yummy! I made double the amount and it was perfect, even had some left over. I baked it in the oven instead of frying and my only complaint is that it was a little bland(chicken). Next time I will add more seasonings. I served it with guacamole and definitely went back for seconds.

I just made these and they are great.  I simmered the chicken breasts and spices in a crock pot on high for 3 hours and that worked pretty good.  Sauce is soo good.

sooo good.  the sour cream topping really makes it.  I sprayed olive oil on each chimi then baked them in oven at 450 F for 10 min., instead of frying them.

The best dish I have ever made!! This is a restaurant quality entree. It actually melted in my mouth. I served with Mexican rice and refried beans.  AMAZING!! Thank you so much for sharing! BTW, it is worth letting the sauce cook out of the chicken. It took almost an hour, but was well worth the wait.

This was very good.  The chicken has a great flavor and the sour cream sauce is very good as well.  I do recommend draining the juice before adding to flour tortilla.  The juice will cause the grease to pop.  All in all very good but a little time consuming.

Very good recipe. I have never made Mexican food with success (according to my husband), however this was easy. There was a lot of extra liquid, just drained it.

The chimichangas were fantastic! The only change I made were the tortillas--my husband and I love the uncooked tortillas that you cook at home yourself. It adds a few minutes onto the prep time, but it is so worth it. We will definitely make the chimichangas again!

This is an easy and very delicious recipe.  My husband loved it and it was even better the next day as I guess the chicken mixture had time to "party" inside the tortilla overnight.  Truly a great recipe that can be adapted in many ways.  The only change I made was following the suggestion of another poster by baking them in the oven at 425 degrees for roughly 20 minutes.  They turned out crispy and delicious and we did not miss the oil at all.

I actually made this recipe vegan with Quorn brand chicken, vegan chicken bullion cubes, soy cheese and tofutti sour cream. I followed the cooking procedure exactly as listed. These were very easy to make, and I was told they were so good they "changed lives."

This was so fun and easy to make! My husband loved it! The only thing that I couldn't figure out was how to get the tortillas to roll up properly. The sour cream sauce was incredible! I baked these in the oven instead of frying them for 15 mins at 425 degrees. So yummy!

An excellent dish! The chicken took awhile to cook, so I would have started that earlier, but the execution turned out well. The recipe is easy to follow. I added freshly diced tomatoes to the top too, and served with plain rice.

First time I tried anything like this and was rather skeptical but my husband really liked them.  I did also but I left out the cayenne pepper and only half as much green chilies cause I'm not big on hot, spiced foods.  Will make them again but will try baking them instead of deep frying.

Really good recipe.  I baked mine like one of the other reviewers to save on the fat and used fresh chilis instead of canned, so mine had some heat.  My husband and son loved them!  The only thing is I can't see how they would serve 8, There's only 3 of us and they were all gone.

very good my sons loved then. the only problem i had was that the wanted to float and flip to one side only so i had to hold them under the oil to brown both sides. a bit of work but great taste.

This was AWESOME!!!  I doubled the spices and followed the rest of the directions exactly.  I stuffed myself till I was uncomfortable!!!  This will go into the regular rotation for sure.

I love this recipe but I made a few changes. I don't like green chilies so I sautéed a half onion, a quarter of both a green and red peppers with three cloves of crushed garlic. I added this to the reduced liquid with the chicken. I skipped the sour cream sauce and topped them with cheese sauce,(from the Mexican cooler at the grocery store) sour cream and salsa. So yummy!!

These were absolutely delicious!!!!!  My family raved!  I used a lot of the suggestions from other reviews.  Thank you everyone.  1-can chicken broth instead of the water, doubled the spices and baked them.   One tip from me, make the sauce right before serving otherwise it gets lumpy and a skin forms on top.  I added a little cumin to the sauce too.  10 stars!!!

I made these exactly as written and they were FABULOUS!!!!!! My whole family practically inhaled them! Next time I will bake them instead of fry them as other reviewers have suggested to cut down the fat, but even with frying they're right about 500 calories....not bad! Full of flavor and absolutely delicious =)

Hot as heck!  Be sure the tortillas are very fresh or the rolling tightly part will not happen and then the frying will be a disaster.  Don't make the oil too hot.

I have to say, I never rate a recipe because I normally have to tweak them for our pallet but this is an incredibly delicious and easy recipe! I was so impressed! Between the flavor of the  saucechicken and the sour cream sauce...fantastic! I also would recommend reducing the amount of water for quicker cooking time. I used wheat tortillas, low fat sour cram and brushed with olive oil and baked them (as others suggested) for a little healthier version. You would never guess that as delicious as these were! Looking forward to making them as appetizers for football parties as well! Thank you for sharing this!

These were very good, flavorful & tender meat. I too chose to bake them, just sprayed with cooking spray first. Will definitely make again!
