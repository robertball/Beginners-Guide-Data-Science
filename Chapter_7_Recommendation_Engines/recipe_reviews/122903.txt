excellent recipe, absolutely delicious, the cake itself could possibly do with a bit more chocolate or some cocoa, to give it a less subtle taste, but this just depends on your taste

Once again I found a great recipe using the ingredient search feature.I had mini marshmallows, unsweetened chocolate and applesauce that I wanted to use up. This recipe was so good, it tastes kind of like a Hostess Snowball.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever had so far (I tried a lot of them). Just delicious, not dry at all.

I thought the cake was dry and hard to cut.  The marshmallows stuck to the knife.

yummy yummy yummy.
i also added caramel in the glaze, and sprinkled hazelnut on top. 
and i used milk chocolate instead, since that was all i had.
