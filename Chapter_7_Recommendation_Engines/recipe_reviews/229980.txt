I learned how to make this when I had my first Christmas with my husband's family and my mother in law made it for me. Being pregnant at the time, I ate the whole bowl. It's still one of my favorites. When I make it, I will usually throw in a whole small bag of marshmallows.

My mom would make this when I young. My children have had this dessert all their lives for Christmas. Now that they are grown they think it's not Christmas without Pistachio Salad....delicious!  Taste better if refrigerated the night before your event.  Yummo!!

I made this recipe but combined all ingredients together and it was delicious.  I hadn't had this in such a long time and made it for a St Patrick's Day celebration.  It was a hit!!

The basic recipe was fine, but 1/2 C of marshmallows to the other ingredients was not enough to make it fluffy and white.  I didn't have walnuts in the house so I used chopped pecans and also added dried cranberries/cherries for some color.
