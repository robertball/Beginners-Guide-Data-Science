I made the lavash this afternoon, and I'm eating some right now. I found the  recipe to be clear, easy to follow, and accurate. I did use whole wheat flour; in fact, I used all whole wheat flour as the lavash I typically buy and enjoy is whole grain. My lavash turned out very nutty and crunchy. Although I'm eating it plain right now, I see it as an excellent partner for cheese.   To Jellylava who had trouble with it sticking when stacked, I would suggest using wax paper to separate the lavash pieces. This ought to stop the sticking problem. Although you're probably doing this, make sure you flour your rolling pin and work space too.   By the way, I made a half recipe and it turned out fine.

Thank you.  This is a wonderful recipe.  Unfortunately I didn't have any wheat flour so I just used regular.  I also used a pizza stone at 475 for about 5 minutes.  They turned out wonderful.  I also agree with using havarti cheese on top.  Delicious.

Great recipe.  I didn't have whole wheat flour and used AP - it worked fine.    I put about 1T cracked black pepper and 1 T Poppy Seeds in.  I was stunned at how thin these would roll out I dusted the top with Kosher salt, and used a fork to dock them all over prior to baking.      I tried baking on pizza stone and also in a heated ungreased half sheet pan.  I preferred the half sheet pan, my pizza stone has charred semolina/cornmeal on it and the bread rounds picked up these bits.    The next day I put them in a low oven (250) for a couple of minutes to warm them - and they were even better than fresh out of the oven.

Cracker bread is the perfect name. This is thin and awesomely crunchy. The only change I made was brushing on some olive oil and sprinkling some rosemary before baking. It took me a few tries to get the dough thin enough and it seemed to help letting the dough sit uncovered on the counter for 20 minutes or so. Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice! The only thing I did different was brushing on some olive oil and sprinkling them with sea salt before putting them in the oven. I recommend doing exactly what the recipe says and rolling out ALL the dough paper thin before putting the first batch in the oven. I was scrambling to roll them out between batches; my mistake! Very light, crunchy, and strong enough to support my boyfriend's super bowl cheese dip!

Terrific recipe, Betty.  For a killer taste, try brushing with olive oil and cook over direct heat on the grill.  About a minute on each side.  The taste is awesome!  Lost about half the batch - stuck to the wax paper so might need to sprinkle some flour on the paper while waiting to cook.

I made this for the first time today and I am wondering if I will get better at it.  The results were delicious but it took me over 5 hours.  I couldn't keep up with the rolling in order to get them into the oven and so I ended up rolling the rest of the dough and then turning the oven back on - only the last 10 or so were usable as they had stuck together.  I don't know whether to oil them or flour them more to keep them separate and I don't have enough space to lay them all out while waiting so that is why I stacked them. If I try these again I will experiment with using my pasta machine to do the rolling and then cut off sections to bake. In any case it was fun trying and as I said they are delicious.  I am eating one right now!

These were great!  A bit tough to roll out, but that may have been due to my kitchen's temperature (it was rather warm when I made these).  They tasted great fresh and worked well for the next two days in our lunch boxes.    My advise: make sure you have a large amount of counter space for rolling out and make sure your counter is cool (not warm).

Edited to add: 
I tried these again for Thanksgiving with only all-purpose flour... they never rose!  I do not think the flour would have made that much of a difference.  No clue as to what I did differently, but I will try these again.

I tried this today and found it simple and pleasant to work with. I did use spelt flour instead of wwheat increasing it to 1cup. I also used a mixture of white mostly organic flours ihave already mixed for baking. I also use bulk instant yeast so I guesstemated,pretty good. I was greatful for the suggestion of the long  , even so I still had mor than enough, or too little Lavash cracker bread. No problem. I was so tired any way, so I rolled some. Let the rest in the log froze them. This way I can make a batch when I'm tryiny soda bread and sweet Irish bread.Because the ones I did make Iput myhomemade yogurtcream cheese w/ dried onion spinach-oliveoil-jalapeno dip on them, with one of his favorite homemade soups, lima bean. Did he like the cracker bread? No, he loved them, asked me for 3 more, after I intiallt gave him 1 large, 1small. Next, I'm trying them with my homemade fruit butters and yogurt cream cheese/nuts and tea. thanks Betty, I'm going to share with some of my tea loveers!!

Did this last night and didn't have any issue with adding the salt as suggested in the recipe, it seemed to rise just fine.  Took the suggestion about brushing with olive oil and rosmary ... LOVED IT! Now just need to find a good hummus recipe to go with it.  Did take me 3 hours to get done, but definitly worth it. I will be making these again.

Brings back some memories... Lavash is a traditional Armenian bread and my mom used to bake it on a wood stove during the war with Azerbaijan, when there was no electricity and almost no food in Armenia for a few years... :(

These turned out excellent.  Very thin and crispy.  I made them using King Arthur products (3 1/4 cups of Italian-style flour and 2 1/4 t. instant yeast).  I cut each of the 30 small pieces of dough into quarters (after the second rise) and used my pasta maker to get them paper thin.  The pieces were small enough that I was able to immediately use the thinnest setting on the pasta maker, so while one batch was baking, I was getting the next batch ready.  I docked them with a fork, brushed them with butter-flavored olive oil and used various toppings – from sea salt to Garlic Bread Sprinkle to grated parmesan cheese to King Arthur’s Everything Bread Topping.  We like the plain salted ones the best.  I found that they needed at least 5 minutes at 500 degrees in my oven.

Easy base recipe to add spices to, very versatile.  I imagine it would be very tricky doing this one on your own- rolling/cutting the crackers while rotating pans in the oven is a very fast process and hard to keep up with.   Lots of fun to do with friends though!

Yeah, lavash is the traditional Armenian bread. Healthy and tasty! You don't have to use whole wheat flour, all purpose flour will do it! Thanks for the recipe!

Taste great, but a bit difficult to roll out. Second time I made it I added a tbsp vegetable oil to the dough and used my pasta machine to roll the dough very thin. Put parchment paper under the baking pan to insure no sticking.

Spectucular ... this is the best, (most succesful) cracker I've ever made. I sprinkled some sesame seeds on after brushing it with oil, (safflower.) A note about flour. I learned the hard way that it does go out-of-date and loses many properties. I used to buy it in large quantities for cost saving but have learned to buy only what's needed for about 6 months and keep it in the freezer. Lots of info online through KAF and other Millers on this subject.
This cracker is a great vehicle for all pizza toppings as well as Asian salads with their sauces.

I had never tasted nor heard of lavash until I came across this recipe but I must say this tastes pretty good.  I wasn't able to use quite as much flour as the recipe called for, I think I was only able to knead in about 2 3/4 cups of flour all together (so less 1/2 cup than what the recipe calls for) and I used half whole wheat and half white flour.  This was easy to make, just quite the task to be in the kitchen rolling out so many huge crackers with the oven at 500 degrees-- it was toasty in the kitchen!  Definitely worth the effort.

Yeah, no more $20 at the restaurant!  I used my KA to mix it up, and the pasta attachment on the second to smallest setting to roll them out into rectangles (which fit better on the baking sheet).  Makes most excellent 'flatbread' type thai chicken or philly cheesesteak pizza's like our favorite restaurant.  Use parchment and no issues with sticking.

Really enjoyed this recipe!   Used my pizza stone to bake the dough on.  Made the perfect base for a thin and crispy pizza.  Accidently made the best pita bread with one round that didn't get properly docked which was great as I have tried on purpose to make pitas and failed.  Definitely a keeper!

My husband is a master roller I guess. I told him paper thin, and they were more like cracker tasting chips lol. Pretty good with our soup though.

I enjoyed making this. We all enjoyed eating it. The bread has a delightful crunch. Mine didn't look like the picture but it was still quite good. It's a tiny bit tedious to make. But I probably will make it again because it's yummy. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Used food processor,  SAF instant yeast and cool water since the friction of processing will generate enough heat to kill the yeast. Pulsed to mix ingredients and 30 seconds continuous to knead. Tried all whole wheat and much longer rising time. Taste was good but the instruction to use small walnut size dough balls resulted in under-sized breads. Will use larger dough balls next time and weigh them for uniformity. These are essentially thin pitas or nan. A few puffed up but I flattened them with a spatula. The 30 minute “rest time” probably contributed to this as the dough continued to rise. Out of the oven, the breads were softer than crackers. More versatile that way. The nutty flavor of the whole wheat flour obviates the need for toppings like salt and oil.

I would have given this 5 stars but they are very plain without adding oil and salt on top. The recipe worked perfectly for me.

Great recipe! I rolled it thin on a counter sprinkled with cornmeal, then used a pizza peel to slide the extra large pieces onto a pizza stone for baking... Really speeds the process up. Also,  the dough mixes nicely in a food processor,  where you can even leave it to rise in its own little warm zone, and simply punch it down & re- knead by pulsing the machine.. Couldn't be easier! I served mine up with Brie and spiced peach sauce... ??
