Okay.

So, when I read the other reviews, I thought that I might be able to make it less bland and cut back on the salt. I made a batch of the Taco Seasoning 1 (cut back a little on the chili seasoning and salt) from this site and wisked it together with a tablespoon of brown sugar. I rubbed that into the de-skinned chicken thighs and poured that over the chicken and let it "marinate".
I cooked it like that and didn't add the cheese until the last ten minutes of the cooking, to prevent it from burning.

This was tasty. I paired it with the Mexican Sour Cream Rice from this site.

Five stars for a "quick and easy" dish. I'd say there's a big payoff with this recipe for something that's so simple to throw together! Browning the chicken in a skillet before finishing in the oven provides a lot of flavor and is a step, I believe, that should not be omitted. I seasoned it liberally with salt, pepper, garlic powder and cumin - MUCH more than the "pinch" called for, and browned it in butter. The result after browning looked like blackened chicken. The rest of the preparation was a snap - spoon on a good salsa, top with shredded Cheddar and minutes later the dish is ready to serve. Since the chicken is pretty much cooked before it goes into the oven, care should be taken not to overcook it. Hubs and I really enjoyed this, served with Best Black Beans and Spanish Rice with Bacon, recipes also from this site.

Quick, easy and great!  I didn't bother browning the chicken before baking, just used thawed tenders and sprinkled them with cumin, pepper and minced garlic before adding the salsa and cheese.  I baked for about 35-40 minutes and it came out perfect!  Nice recipe with common ingredients.  I recommend giving this a try.

Simple, quick, and delicious!  I had my doubts with so few ingredients, but it was worth the try.  I needed something easy for a late night supper for me and my husband.  I used two chicken breasts and there's no need to brown the chicken first.  I just sprinkled both sides with garlic powder, salt, cracked black pepper, cumin and a little chili powder.  I used a thick and chunky salsa and poured all 16 oz. into an 8x8 baking dish at 350 for 45 minutes.  The last 5 minutes I grated pepper jack cheese over top.  To make the presentation a little better I chopped some green onion and sliced black olives on top and served with sour cream and a side of spanish rice.  This had to be the easiest meal I've ever made off of this site!

Yum - this was so good.  I cut my chicken in strips and put in bowl and mixed together 2 cloves of garlic, salt, pepper and Pampered Chef's Southwestern Seasoning.  I then seared the chicken in a small bit of vegetable oil.  I put in lightly greased dish and put chunky salsa and shredded Cheddar and baked.  Made Spanish Rice on the side - served with sour cream.  This was so yummy.  Thank you Karen!

This recipe is wonderful - I've made it a few times now and we always enjoy it.  I use a salsa that has beans and corn in it and the same quantities of salsa and cheese as the recipe calls for, but 6 chicken breasts..  it still has plenty of sauce :)  Also very good reheated.

I made this for dinner tonight.  Although the flavor was good and the chicken was moist inside, I didn't care for the texture of the outside of the skinless chicken breasts.  Under the salsa and cheese the outside of the breasts were too dry.  If I make this again, I don't think I'll brown the breasts first or if I do, I'll bread them.  In my opinion I think this would be better if the breasts baked with the salsa in a 400 degree oven and then add the cheese about 10 mins before they're done cooking.  Skip the browning all together.

This is truly quick, easy and very good. I used thick sliced pepper jack cheese instead of the shredded cheddar and it worked out very well. I served it with spanish rice and sliced avacado. I use a similar recipe to make chicken parmesan. Use maranara sauce in place of the salsa and mozzarella cheese for the cheddar and top with parmesan. Also quick, easy and very tasty. It is great with pasta.

An excellent recipe I serve over brown rice cooked with chicken boullion.  If I don't have a lot of time to fuss in the kitchen, I slice each chicken breast in half width-wise, sprinkle with cumin and pepper and place in the baking dish (without frying first) with the salsa and cheese.  It then takes about 35 minutes to bake, which leaves me free to do other things before dinner.

Very good! I steamed the chicken and spices in a steamer first. Then I lined a 9 x 13 pan with refried beans and seasoned them with taco seasoning. I placed the chicken on top of the beans and smothered everything with a can of "spanish style tomato sauce" (found by the mexican food in the grocery store). Then I poured salsa on top of the chicken. Finally I sprinkled taco cheese over the top. Yummy!!

I did use garlic powder instead of minced garlic, and sprinkled the seasonings on each side instead of rubbing them on. I also pounded the chicken a bit flat so it would cook evenly, as suggested by another reviewer. Because I had something else in the oven simultaneously, I baked it at 350 for about 40 minutes. Everyone raved over it. It was very moist and tender.  No one could believe how simple it was. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is great!  I have made it with 6 big chicken breasts without increasing the other ingredients, I have added a layer of sauteed mushrooms, I have "spiced" it up, I have used other cheeses, etc. - almost any modification you can think of!  I prefer to use a chunky salsa with corn and beans.  Thank you!

Very tasty. In order to get juicy, not dry chicken, I heat a little bit of oil in a cast iron skillet until it's smoking. I brown chicken breasts for about 4 minutes on each side ( depending on the thickness), this creates a blackened appearance. I then add salsa and cheese and put entire skillet in oven for 15 minutes, 20 at the most then let it sit for about 10 minutes so the juices run back inside. Very juicy!

I really love the simplicity of this recipe and have made it several times.  This evening, I decided to kick it up a notch.  I had made tacos a few days ago, and had taco seasoning left over (recipe from this site.)  I liberally sprinkled the taco seasoning on the breasts, then pan cooked them for about 15 minutes.  I opened a can of red kidney beans, drained them, and poured them on the bottom of the casserole dish (I used a 9x11 dish).  I placed the chicken breasts on top of the beans, added the salsa and the cheese.  I then spooned about 1/2 can of diced tomatoes between the breasts.  Since I like hot spices, I took a large jalepeno pepper from the garden, sliced it into circles, laid them on the breasts, then added more cheese to cover.  Served with Spanish rice, this was a huge hit.

This was a hit! Pickled Jalepeno peppers on top of the cheese when it goes in the oven really adds to the Mexican (Tex-mex?) taste. Sour cream served with, really completes the dish. Will do again.

I made this last Friday night and it was delicious.  I used the whole jar of salsa, about two cups instead of just one.  My bf was late getting home from work and so the chicken was in the oven for over an hour at about 200 degrees, but it was still moist.  He even ate the leftover chicken the next day, and he usually doesn't eat the leftovers.

This was an excellent starter for dinner. I have to watch the fats and sodium in my diet due to health concerns, so I made a few changes. I cooked mine start to finish in my cast iron skillet and it turned out great!I ended up liberally seasoning the chicken breasts with garlic powder,white pepper,cumin, and a pinch of sea salt.I browned the chicken in a tad of olive oil and removed form the pan. I deglazed the skillet with margarita /tequilla. I sliced a red and white onion, red bell pepper, cilantro and 3 cloves of garlic and cooked them for 5 minutes or so until the onions were somewhat transparent. Returned the chicken to the pan, covered with homemade salsa and a little more cilantro, and baked in the oven for about 30 minutes. About the last 10 minutes, I added 1/2 cup of low fat cheddar and baked the last few minutes. I served it over rice. WAS IT EVER GOOD! I will be making this again!

Made this last week when I wasn't feeling well and just didn't want to cook. I could tell this could be really fast and in fact with cooking and ingredient modifications it was in the oven in 5 minutes and done in fifty, turning out moist and delicious! I read many of the reviews and then modified it to what was on hand. Decided to skip the browning step. Needed to use up a green bell pepper so diced it and then spread the chicken breast (cut into four strips) on top. No salsa in the house (too much salt for my husband anyway) but did have half a jar of marinara sauce which I poured evenly on top. Covered and baked for 45 minutes and then served on top of pasta with a sprinkle of parmesan. Yummy!  I rated this 5 stars because it's a great idea - so easy and versatile. I loved not having to take time to brown the chicken and saute the peppers. Will be making this again with more cut up veggies on the bottom layer.

Great recipe!!!! My husband was begging for more! I made a few changes...like the some others I added cooking time and just put the chicken straight in the oven (raw) I doubled the salsa and cheese I added rinsed black beans and on the adults side I added finely chopped jalapenos. All it was missing was some sour cream. This is a keeper!!

This is very quick and easy. It's great for dinner in a hurry after a long day at work! I Personally make it even a little bit easier (with less clean up). I just take a 9x13 pan and put the Spanish rice mix in the bottom, add the recommended amount of water and salsa. Then I put the chicken breasts on top of the rice, cover them with salsa and cheese and put it in the oven at around 350. It takes about 30-45 minutes to cook. Cheers!

Karen, this was flat out fabulous! Thank you for sharing this recipe! I only had two chicken breasts tonight and was looking for a way to stretch it out. I simply cut them in tenders, then followed your recipe for seasoning and covering. Oh my gosh, was it fantastic! The flavor is incredible! BTW, I just put them in the oven raw with seasonings and covered in salsa. After 25 minutes, I put on the cheese and let it go another 20 minutes. BAM! You have a winner here! Thank you!!!

This was wonderful.  I cubed the chicken before browning it to speed things up a bit.  Served with refried beans and brown rice seasoned with salsa and cumin.  Even the 7 yo, 4 yo and 2 yo gobbled it up.

I have been making this Mexican chicken for years now and it is a family favorite.  The only thing different I do is cook the entire dish in a skillet.  After browning the chicken, I add a 24oz jar of chunky salsa, cover and let simmer for 20 minutes.  I then top each chicken breast with shredded Mexican Style cheese and cover until melted.

I would give this recipe 5 stars--easy and tasty!  I have also made a crockpot version.  You don't even have to thaw your b/s breasts, just put them in the pot, pour a jar of your favorite salsa over them and cover.  Great supper with lots of sauce to put over rice!

This is certainly quick and easy. It could use more flavour, though. The amount of spice and garlic is way too small, leading to a lack of complexity of flavour. However, for a wuick dinner for families with small children, this would be great. Thanks!

Very good, quick and easy - and flavorful.  I used granulated garlic instead of minced, and upped the spice rub considerably.  A pinch would not have done it - I probably had over 1 tbsp. of seasonings altogether.  Otherwise, made just as written.

I followed the recipe except that I used garlic powder instead of a clove and added refried beans when I baked it. Very simple and yummy.

wonderful!  My favorite thing about this recipe (other than how delicious it is), is the fact that , being a widow, I am able to modify the amounts, usng the exact ingredients but in the lesser amounts, and have a wonderful meal for just one.  This, to me is very important.  Thank you so much  .RD013

SOOOOO, sooooo good! I've been hesitant to try this because it's similar to another recipe I like to make (Faye's salsa chicken), but  the two are actually different in many ways. By far, this is the moistest, juiciest chicken I've EVER had!!! Browning it first really makes a HUGE difference. The cumin is also a nice addition but you need to add more than a pinch of it to taste it. NOTE: I was afraid that my garlic would burn to a crisp when browning my chicken, but it didn't (just watch it and adjust the heat if it starts to burn). A pasta and veggie side rounded out our delicious meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Karen! I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to give this a try. :-)

I've seen this recipe for over a year, and finally decided to make it.  This was extremely easy and full of flavor.  Some recipes you get from this site are bland, but definitely NOT this one!  I did boil my chicken breasts in the morning, rubbed the cumin, garlic powder and pepper on them once in the baking dish, covered them with Graden Fresh medium salsa and used a whole bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese over the top.  Put this in the fridge until I got home from work.  I cooked it for 30 minutes uncovered at 350.  Everything was perfect!  Served with Mexican rice...YUM!

YUMMMMMM! This dish turned out surprisingly good. Very easy to prepare. I added twice the suggested amount of spices, including garlic clove and powder. The combination of seasonings were ZESTY and chicken was juicy and full of flavor! Will be making this again.

Just as everyone said - VERY easy and VERY good.  I'm in Switzerland and Cheddar Cheese (any yellow cheese) isn't easy to find, so I used Mozzarella.  Served it over rice and my Fiancee commented that the rice could have used more flavor.  Maybe I'll make Spanish Rice with it next time or use a chicken flavor bouillon cube.  Will be making it again.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!  Not only was this easy and quick but it was DELICIOUS!  I made very small changes, not enough to even mention.  I also decided to take a piece of chicken and cut it up, put sour cream, shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes on a tortilla and instead of taco sauce I used the juice from the pan and this made a DELICIOUS soft-shelled taco!!!  I will definitely be making this one again!

Love! So simple and tasty. I like to pound out my chicken breasts a little first. Not super thin but just enough so they stay flat when cooking. If not they plump up and the salsa just falls off. I sprinkle both sides with seasonings, lay them in the bottom of a pyrex, and cover with salsa. Bake at 375 for 45ish minutes adding cheese in the last 10. The key is that you have to use a good salsa! I've tried this with fresh salsa, a good store bought, mango salsa, and a bean and corn salsa.

Due to lack of time, I choose not to brown my chicken.  I was worried it would look funny...but the cheese covered it and it wasn't noticed.  Really good easy meal.

Very good.  I added a can of drained/rinsed black beans with the cheese and salsa (gotta have beans!).  Served it with brown rice.

I agree with another reviewer that browning the chicken in the skillet before baking adds extra flavor.  If you are in a real hurry - you could skip that step and it will still be good.  I deglazed the skillet and added that to the salsa so as not to lose any delicious morsels.  Very easy and very good!

This dish can become low-fat and low carb with easier clean-up.  Using frozen boneless chicken breasts makes it even easier.   Season the chicken, put it in a large skillet which has been sprayed with cooking spray, and pour the salsa over the top. Cover and cook until completely done.   Serve with tossed salad, Oriental slaw (as South Beach diet recipe), roasted portobella mushrooms, etc.  Delicious and easy. I use this dish for quick weeknight meals.

Simple & delicious!  I would definitely recommend this chicken dish.  You can change the recipe up each time you make it just by using a different type/flavor of salsa.  My husband and two daughters absolutely love this.  I prepare the dish exactly as the recipe states - didn't have to make any changes.  Thanks for a fantatic recipe!

I was too tired to assemble enchiladas, so I did an ingredient search for chicken, salsa and rice and found this. It really hit the spot. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic salt, and I used colby/jack blend in place of Cheddar. I also sprinkled some sliced black olives on top. The chicken was very moist, and the sauce was delicious spooned over rice. You can control the flavor and heat of this dish with your choice of salsa. It's a super easy weeknight dinner. Thank you, Karen!

This amazing dish is my fiancee's favorite food. It has become a weekly dinner because we're both busy, and this is as easy as it gets. He raves the whole time he eats it (he's adorable, I must admit)! I've made it as is, and I've also done my own thing with it-it's always so, so good. (When I make changes, it's small things, like adding a few cups of baby spinach or kale, processed to be very tiny grains, to the salsa/cheese mixture-he never notices the difference, and I always pound the chicken breasts to be pretty thin.)I absolutely LOVE this recipe. Thank you so much, Karen!

This is a quality recipe!  I made this tonight because my mom mentioned that she's been in the mood for Mexican food.
We are gluten & corn intolerant and my folks are at a certain age where I have to be created with limited items.
The reviews were very helpful!
I moderately seasoned the chicken (Which is more than I usually do for m&d).
I browned my chicken in butter.
I made up Guacomole from AllRecipe along with an Uncle Ben's Beans & Rice blend.  Served with sour cream.
It was a homerun.

I made this last night. I added some of the called for ingredients. I also tossed the chicken breast in a packet of taco seasoning mix. I pan seared with EVOO, topped with salsa, covered with foil and put in the oven. During the last 2 minutes, I added the Mexican cheese blend and chopped green onions. I covered again with foil. Served with black beans and spanish rice. It was delicious! My daughter had some for breakfast this morning! Great recipe!

I used a jar of med. hot salsa and found it to be a little overpowering. Next time I'll use a mild salsa and reduce the amount to 3/4 cup. Very easy and quick recipe to make on a busy weeknight.

I absolutely loved this. i used my own slasa, which is heavy on the lime, and grated dry cheddar, so it formed a kind of hard cheesy crust. The result was that the chicken was incredibly moist and flavorful!

Although it had very few ingredients, the flavor was amazing.  My husband and kids couldn't get enough!  This one is a keeper.

This is a quick and easy recipe, also moist and good flavor. I browned the chicken with seasonings and baked 30m @ 375 covered, uncovered and baked 10m @ 350. I used home made salsa and a mexican blend shredded cheese.

This is very, very good - espcially for how simple it is.  I rubbed the chicken with olive oil and sprinkled the seasonings lighltly (more than "a pinch"!) before frying in olive oil and it came out nicely spiced.  The only change I'll make next time is to use garlic salt instead of real garlic. The minced garlic burned before the chicken was cooked.  FYI - this tastes better as it sits.  Next time I will prepare it about 1/2 hr ahead of the side dishes and let it "rest".  I made Mexican Rice from this site and both turned out excellent.  Thank you Karen.

For a better, HOTTER, CHUNKIER SALSA:
To a regular "salsa" can add: 1 clove of garlic minced, 1 tablespoon of olive oil (Tabasco sauce and pepper if desired). In a skillet put the minced garlic with the tbsp of olive oil cook until the garlic has a light brown color, add the salsa and cook on medium heat for 3-5 minutes. Add a little bit of pepper if desired. For a hotter salsa add a few drops of Tabasco sauce.

Very quick and easy, as the title states, but not enough flavor gets into the chicken.  The chicken was actually bland even though the seasonings and salsa were flavorful.

Really yummy and in my opinion, a great deal of the flavor comes from using a good salsa.  I use Frontera salsas which adds a smokiness and deeper flavor.  Seasoned the chix as told: (generously with) cumin, pepper, garlic powder, (omitted salt) and added a bit of chili powder.  Easy, hearty and family crowd pleaser.

I made this for my family last night and my boyfriend and I absolutly loved it. I didnt brown the chicken prior and just put it all in the dish and baked at 300 for about an hour. I had large chicken breasts so I used about a 1/4 cup salsa on top of each and a handfull of tex mex cheese. Definatly will be making again!!! thanks for sharing!!!

I have been making this for years. A small difference is I marinate the chicken in a bit of lime juice for a few minutes first. Dee-lic-ious with guacamole or just avacado slices.

I've made this twice since finding it a little over 2 weeks ago. It's SO GOOD.  As another user suggested, I pounded out my chicen breasts so they cooked more evenly. I sauteed the chicken in garlic powder and I added some chili powder and cumin for kick. I put it in the oven for only about 20 minutes and it came out perfect! I'm on Weight Watchers and this is a VERY LOW POINT meal!  I served over white rice and black beans. YUMMMMMM!!!

This is a delicious, novel, and easy recipe, which is also low in fat! I’m just learning to cook well, but this recipe ensures the chicken will be juicy and flavorful. My salsa was on the boring side, so I added corn, some black beans and chopped green pepper, also used more salsa than the recipe required. I served it with rice, but it was also good with corn tortilla chips. If you like salsa, you’ll love this recipe.

I have been making this recipe for several years with two extra steps -- in fact I thought I had 'invented' it myself. When I make this favorite recipe for my family, I have the chicken thawed either the night before or early that s.m. and poke it thoroughly on both sides with a fork, put in a plastic Ziploc bag, fill to cover with Jose Cuervo Margarita Mix, seal and refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Turn the bag over several times before using the chicken to thoroughly distribute the liquid. I don't add tequila but I guess you could; definitely not necessary. I always do mine on top the stove; esp good in summertime when you don't need extra heat in the house! Before cooking I chop a medium onion and sauté in a tiny bit of oil, drain and add my chicken to the skillet and cook so all the pink is almost gone. Then I add my salsa (as mild or spicy as you like it) cover for a few minutes to warm the salsa. Just before serving, I sprinkle with Mexican cheese or sharp cheddar, cover again just enough to let the cheese melt, and serve. The margarita mix gives it a special tang that you wouldn't otherwise have. It has been a huge hit with everyone who had eaten it and super easy to prepare. Oh, don't be shocked at the color of the chicken when you take it out of the fridge after marinating it.

I made this pretty much like the recipe, except I browned the chicken in a cast iron skillet I'd pre-heated in the oven.  I then placed the skillet on medium heat to brown the chicken.  After baking, I added a little more cheese.  This had great flavor and I'll be making it again.

We had this last night and my husband said it was very tasty and well worth having again. I did it in a cast iron skillet browning it well in butter and then finishing it in the oven for ten minutes. I did like many others and increased the spices but other than that followed the directions. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe Karen.

Made this last night for my husband for our intimate anniversary dinner. OMG! it turned out awesome! i was thoroughly surprised and my husband was completely speechless with how it turned out. We finished two huge pieces of chicken without stopping for even a minute.I dabbed the chicken breast pieces with minced garlic as suggested but generously, definitely way more than how much one clove of garlic would produce. I also dabbed extra pepper along with some cayenne pepper for the extra kick. Basked them on the pan for slightly longer both to give the chicken a nice brown color on the outside, along with making sure its cooked well from inside. I bought Sabra Mango and Peach salsa and used it whole.Topped generously with Mexican blend cheese and baked it as suggested for 15-20mins and allowed the cheese to bubble.I made some spanish rice with some pre-cooked brown rice on the side, and the combination went great. Topped extra sour cream on top of the chicken right before serving and it tasted awesome. Thank you for this amazing easy dish.Definitely making it again!

This recipe is so easy, but so good. Chicken came out moist and made the whole house smell really good. Only my oldest daughter and me ate it, but we loved it.

I am rating this 5 stars for ease of preparation. Don't misunderstand, it is quite tasty as well! I threw in some black beans and served it over rice as suggested....we could not get enough!  This is definitely a keeper! I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and sprinkled the other spices liberally on the chicken and browned the chicken in butter as another reviewer suggested.
Can't beat it for a week night supper!

Grub! I added a little garlic powder, an extra clove or two of real garlic, and a little seasoning salt. A few slices of jalapeno too since we like some extra kick around here. Delish! Thanks!

We enjoyed this chicken tonite.  I spiced it up a bit using the spices listed plus McCormick's Perfect Pinch Savory All-Purpose salt free seasoning.  I used Sabra's Southernwestern style salsa.  Waited to put the cheese on until the last 10 minutes.  I served it with white rice with black beans and a simple salad.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very easy to make and the kids loved it too!  One of the kids exact word for the dish was "SUPERB".  I thought the dish might be too spicy since it called for jars of hot sauce.  I bought the medium and I think the heat of this dish was perfect, not too hot.  I will definetly make this again

Wow! Amazing!

I highly recommend using your favorite salsa. I used Newman's Own Black Bean and Corn Salsa, and I used the whole jar. It was SO GOOD I'm sure to do it again and again.

It was a big hit with my brother and my boyfriend too! Definitely try this one out.

Awesome and Easy!  I used a chicken taco seasoning on the chicken before I fried it  up in the skillet instead of the seasonings listed.  Frying it up and then baking it definitely added to the flavor. Served with Zataran's New Orleans Yellow Rice.  This is a definite keeper!

Nothing amazing.It might have been my salsa, but I thought it needed more flavor. I might try it again with more spices and a blended salsa to intensify the flavors.

I made this tonight, because I felt like something flavorful.  I had a package of lipton Mexican Rice, I put the rice, the water and a bit of the oil from the chicken in the baking dish, placed in the oven for 10 minutes.  Then I just layed the chicken on top added the salsa on top of the chicken.  Sprinkled cheese over everything and cooked it all together.  It was awesome.  Will let you know what my husband thinks, he wasn't hungry yet.

This dish is easy and delicious.  I did brown it first before baking, other wise I think the cheese may have gotten too brown.  It was perfect, I will make this many, many times.  I served it with rice.  I used the drippings in the pan to pour over the rice and it was also great.  Yum Yum  I would submit a  picture of it but it was gone too fast.

I made this recipe exactly as written with one exception. I blended the salsa with 1/3 of a cup of sour cream and then topped with cheese. That is the same way I make my chicken enchiladas for my family who are DEVOUT salsa haters....if they only knew! They ate it up and asked for more. Definently a keeper.

This is one of our favorite meals! I do add a can of drained & rinsed black beans and a can of green chilies. The last time I made it, I was out of cheddar, but had some velveeta with chilies. I sliced that and placed on top.  It added a creaminess that I LOVED!!! I've made this again, and have added frozen corn and lime juice. I definitely recommend the lime juice!

Pleasantly surprised with this!!! The chicken was frozen when I started out making this so I didn't hold out much hope of it being juicy and not dried out. It was actually quite perfect. I did not measure the salsa and cheese, just applied it generously. After serving it, I found I liked it better if I chopped it and added some of the juice from the salsa/cheese mixture. This would make some awesome chicken nachos, I think I will try it next time. Thanks!

Good recipe and good taste, but missing a WOW factor for me. I don't quite know what it is missing, but I did follow the recipe as is and chicken came out moist and tender. Used Safeway/Vons brand Mild Southwest Salsa. Will make again, quick and easy!

Followed the recipe as stated for ingredients, the only change i made was not browning the chicken first.  I put everything in a casserole dish, and baked in the oven for 35 minutes.  Added the cheese on top and cooked for an additional 12 minutes.  Served this over rice (brown and white).  Was amazingly easy and delicious.  Kids raved and asked for it again.  Definitely a keeper!

I have made this recipe twice now and everyone loves it - the only small change I made is to use picante sauce instead of salsa and I just dump the whole jar over the chicken .Absoulutely delicious !

This was really good!  Talk about easy to make and quick too!  I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder and browned it quickly on each side not the 10-15 minutes which was mentioned.  Then when I baked it I increased the temperature to 400 degrees and baked it for 30 minutes.  In another smaller fry pan in olive oil I sauteed minced onion, sliced fresh mushrooms, and slivers of red and green pepper.  After putting the chicken in the casserole dish I topped it with salsa, then the onions, mushrooms and peppers.  Next I sprinkled the cheddar over all.  Talk about a colorful dish!  Tasty, too!  Delicious over buttered noodles.  A dish liked by all and a definite "keeper".

Just okay. Made just like the recipe and sprinkled dried cilantro (no fresh on hand) on top. Put it over rice. Maybe I'll use a hotter salsa if I make it again.

This was one of easiest, tastiest chicken dishes I have ever made.  My thanks to Karen Taylor for posting it. I used Italian style Perdue Perfect Portion chicken breasts and, since they're already seasoned, I skipped all the seasonings (making it even easier). I would only say that with smaller chicken breasts, 10 to 15 minutes of browning time would be WAY too long.  I browned the breasts for about 3 minutes per side.  The chicken turned out incredibly tender and juicy after about 20 minutes in the oven.   Absolutely a keeper according to my family.

Great recipe.  Cooked the chicken a little less in the skillet and a little longer in the oven to keep the chicken moist and tender.  Came out perfect.

My husband and I enjoyed this very much. I was heavy on the cumin, used garlic powder instead of fresh (to save time), and used drained black beans at the bottom of the casserole and placed the chicken on top. Will definitely make this again. So darn easy. I was surprised at how good this was.

Skip the oven part by cubing the chicken, browning and pouring sauce over then simmer until done.  Easy served over rice with side bowls of grated cheese and chopped avacado.  I read that Picante sauce is better for cooking, we tried and yes, it is not as liquid and holds flavor better than salsa.

You know, this wasn't bad...  It wasn't amazing though.   I think that a lot of this depends upon the salsa (obviously).  I used a really good, almost pico de gallo-type salsa and it just didn't work out that well.  It think if I used something that was more of a tomato base, or even a salsa verde -- then we'd be talkin'.  I'll all for quick yumminess though, so I'll try again and perhaps change my review.

It is a simple recipe, and you can definitely tell it is smothered in salsa.  However, it came out VERY juicy, and I did not bother pounding the chicken as some other viewers suggested.  A very healthy recipe as well! Will make again.

I didn't have some of the ingredients so I rubbed with some taco seasoning, garlic salt, salt and pepper.  I also used diced tomatos and corn and peppers (canned) to make my own.  Delicious!

You wouldn't think too much of this recipe if you judged it on ingredients alone, but it turned out not only moist and juicy, but very tasty, too. And, in under 30 minutes. I served with the Spanish Rice II recipe and will be making this dish again. Thank you for sharing!

Loved this recipe and it's so easy to make. I always pound my chicken breasts to make them cook evenly and more moist and tender. I used a salsa from one of our local mexican restaurants that is smooth and has great flavor and quite a kick. Not only is this quick and easy, it's simple to adapt to how many chicken breasts you wish to prepare. I'll definitely make this again.

Super easy and very tasty! I only had hot salsa on hand so I blenderized it with canned diced tomatoes. The sauce still had some kick but the kids could also enjoy it. Try this with some spiced up rice and a salad for a dinner that's muy delicioso!

Such an easy and delicious recipe. It's a keeper in our house! Also, depending on what type of salsa you get (mild, medium, hot), you can really control the "heat" factor of the meal.

You don't have to be a cook to pull off this recipe.  It's so simple that my husband made it for a function at work, and everybody lived afterwards!

I forgot to season the chicken before pouring a jar of salsa over the chicken.  Oops!  So I just put it into the oven at 350F for 45 mins.  Then layered on some jalapeno havarti cheese and pickled jalapenos and put it back in for 10 more mins.  When it came out, I served it with green onions, sour cream and guacamole.  My hubby said it was great, despite no other seasonings.  I'm sure I'll be making it again, maybe with seasonings next time :D

Yesterday I cooked this recipe.  
My wife said "she never tasted such a chicken recipe like this." 
I enjoyed it very much. Thanks.

This an easy and delicious meal. I do use thin cuts of breast, season them and lightly brown them in a skillet and finish them off in the oven. This is a big hit.

4 stars because the huge chicken breast I had came out tender and juicy. I’m going to use this method for cooking chicken breast from now on. I knew this wasn’t going to be seasoned enough for us so I used 1 T chili powder and 1T cumin but left the other seasonings the same. Everyone liked it and I’ll make again.

WHY does everyone rate a recipe a 5 star when they add all the extra's?  Come on...rate from the ORIGINAL RECIPE so the rest of us can judge whether or not we want to try the recipe!!!  Adding enhances the recipe...that's fine, just don't rate the  recipe a 5 if you do!!!

This was delicious. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I did not brown before putting them in the oven. I marinated the breasts with low sodium taco seasoning, extra cumin and olive oil. After reading many of the reviews I took the advice of mixing the salsa with the black beans. I put extra salsa on top of the chicken and put in in the oven for about an hour on 400. The meat was so juicy and yummy.I did not have cheese on hand but I did put a dollop of low fat sour cream on top and it elevated the dish. I served with rice. I cannot wait to make it again and when I do I am going to throw some sauteed onions and bell peppers in.

Didn't enjoy this as much as the "original" Mexican chicken.  Just chicken with cheese and salsa on top. Blah.

I made Spanish rice and put it in the bottom of the pan and put the chicken on top of it and added the other ingredients per the recipe.  Turned out excellent!

I took advice from the reviews and skipped browning the chicken in a skillet.  Instead I lined my baking pan with aluminum foil, placed my thin sliced chicken breast in, rubbed down with spices, poured a generous amount of salsa on top of each piece, and placed in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  After the chicken came out, I added cheese and put back in the oven for 7-8 minutes.  It turned out AWESOME! The Spanish rice we had with it was more complicated than the chicken to make.  Super easy to make.  Will be back on the menu soon.

This really was amazing! I used a salsa verde instead and loved it! Didn't use pinches of anything like the others said. Instead I just made sure each breast was coated with a layer of each ingredient.

Easy dish and went over very well with the family.  Came together very quickly.  I added chili powder and garlic powder to the seasoning.  Rather than transferring to another pan I browned the chicken in a cast iron skillet and then just spread the salsa and cheese over the top before moving to the oven.

This was so easy and tasty on a busy night.  I used Trader Joe's pineapple salsa that I had as a leftover along with a bag of shredded Mexican cheese.  Perfect!

It is very difficult for me to find time to cook on a weekend, but I decided to give this recipe a try since it appears to be a "quick" recipe. The name holds true - quick and easy!  Not only that, but so tasty, I had no leftovers in my house!  I didn't have thighs, so pounded out 4 chicken breast and cut each of them in half. I agree, that a pinch wasn't enough, but mixed the salt, pepper, cumin & freshly minced garlic in a bowl - rubbed generously into chicken before browning. When transferring to the baking pan, I added a little extra chopped chili's in with the salsa, as well as some sauteed onions & yellow bell pepper.  Everything else was as the recipe called for.  This was crazy good!  Served with the Easy Corn Pudding found on this website too.  Thanks for sharing a recipe that was delicious and quick to make!

This was fantastic and easy to make! I didn't have cumin, so to give it the Mexican feel, I added taco seasoning instead. I happened to have some queso in my fridge, so before I put on the salsa and cheese, I put a thin layer of that on. I served it with a small dollop of sour cream and it was fantastic!

My husband enthusiastically told me I should make this one of my standard dishes and that his family (who loves "safe" recipes) would absolutely love it.

This was tasty. I followed the recipe exactly other than adding much more than a pinch of cumin. If I make this again, I would like to try rubbing the chicken with homemade taco seasoning, as several previous reviewers mention doing; I think it would taste even better that way.

Made this for supper last night. Used chicken thighs instead of breasts as that's what we prefer. Used a pint of my homemade salsa which isn't too spicy so I added 1 can of Rotel. Otherwise followed recipe. It was very good!! Next time I will put Minute Rice under the chicken tho.

Quick & Easy Mexican Chicken Haiku: "Flavor was alright. But the texture? Not so good. Could've been better." Maybe if the chicken had been rubbed down w/ a more varied Mexican-themed sprinkle of seasoning (or as suggested by some reviews, taco seasoning), or maybe if the chicken had skipped the oven and continued cooking in a salsa-bath in the skillet, or if maybe the chicken went right to oven w/o being browned first (too many maybes, I don't think I'll make it again either way) ... but ultimately following the recipe resulted in a chicken that tasted good based on my having used a quality salsa and cheese and eating it over a salad, but the texture of the chicken was just too rubbery on the outside, and not moist enough on the inside.

Simply phenomenal! Easy, quick and delicious. I used a relatively zippy salsa that made it quite delicious. I also doubled the amount of cumin and trebled the garlic because I love both. But other than that, the recipe was perfect as-is!

Really good recipe.  I needed something quick and I'm always leary of using my oven with main dishes as it adds cooking time but this recipe allowed me time to make a salad alongside.  Loved Jenny's comment about using a salsa with corn and black beans... I'll have to make sure I have some of that type on hand for next time.  My 4yo isn't into salsa so I just skipped it on his portion and he loved the broiled cheese on chicken.  Thanks for he recipe Karen!

Excellent recipe! My whole family loved it! Even my daughter friend. There was nothing left on their plates.
I did use taco seasoning for the rub Instead of the ingredients listed. I also mixed cream cheese with the salsa. I did not have sour cream or I would not used that instead. 
It looked beautiful and was absolutely delicious.

This recipe is fantastic as written. The end product is rich with flavor and incredibly moist - which is tough to get in a one pot boneless, skinless chicken breast dish. Compliments to the original chef!

quick and easy! Tasty recipe - I swapped out the cumin for chili powder, cajun powder, and used garlic powder in the rubbing instead of fresh. Still delicious!

This is hands down my favorite dinner to date! I add jalapeño slices to the top before I pop it into the oven and top it off with a dollop of fat free sour cream before I set it on the table. Sooooo good :)

I just tried this recipe, substituting mahi mahi for the chicken. Excellent! The only change was to bake the fish in the same pan I fried it in. Lazy me.

I have been using this recipe for about 20 years, and my family loves it!!!  I use greek seasoning and broil my chicken on both sides.  Then added the salsa and then add the cheese and broil again until bubbly.  The salsa and greek seasoning are perfect together.

This was awesome, but I did change a couple of things after reading reviews.  1) I used taco seasoning instead of the spices listed. 2) I put down a bed of black beans under the chicken breasts before baking. 3) I added cheese after baking the chicken for 10 minutes and just continued cooking until the cheese was bubbly.  My kids liked it, so that makes the recipe a real winner!

Thanks for this easy recipe when I'm stumped about what to make with chicken.  I didn't measure the spices and added enough of each spice to coat three very large chicken breasts.  The browning step is essential because it locks in moisture and flavor.  I will make this often.

It was quick and easy....I didn't have any cumin...so I improvised with some chili powder and so roasted garlic seasoning along with real garlic and salt and pepper...rubbed the chicken breasts and cooked over medium high heat.   placed in a foil lined baking sheet and then topped with FRESH salsa...Jack and Jill's Medium and then topped with light Cheddar cheese...baked for 15 mins at 35 - simply delicious!!!

Gave it a 3 since I Can't rate it yet since my husband had to reheat it, but I would wait to put the salsa and cheese on for awhile, then add it with the last five minutes or so since he said it was a little greasy, and see if that helps.  He liked it though.  I didn't try it this time, but will next time

I used chicken tenders; browned them lightly in olive oil, spiced as in recipe, and placed in pan.  Mixed sweet corn salsa, green chili salsa and 1 can pinto beans and poured over chicken.  Topped with Mexican-style shredded cheese and pepper jack. Served over jasmine rice.  My husband LOVED IT, and there's enough for dinner tomorrow!  Will definitely make it again, with black beans next time.  Terrific recipe

Loved this recipe, it is as quick and easy as it says. I gave it four stars because I altered it a little and improved it. I ignored the dry rub ingrediants and used taco seasoning, garlic, and a little bit of black pepper. I also added half a can of black beans.

Made this last night along with Mexican Rice II. I made this recipe as directed except I reduced the black pepper, as recommended by some reviewers and added the minced garlic after browning the chicken so it wouldn't burn in the pan. I used medium chunky salsa and halved the chicken breasts length wise to make them thinner. The chicken was moist and flavorful. Great and easy recipe!

I love this recipe.  I make it with a little red pepper flakes before cooking the chicken but otherwise follow the recipe.  It's always flavorful and juicy, and the smells that fill the house are fantastic.

The base of this meal is perfect. The rub and the quick brown were key. I incorporated other reviews and came up with a 1-dish wonder. There was brown rice cooked in boullion. I added the almost-most cooked rice as layer 1. Then I had a bag of steamed mixed veg...Added on top of that. Then the great seasoned, browned chicken, salsa, cheese, crushed nachos. Baked then served with a dallop of store bought 3-layer dip from the super bowl party. A little sad I have nothing to take to lunch for tomorrow...:(

Very good, and simple to make with ingredients I usually have on hand.  Spread a bit of salsa on bottom of pan before baking to make sure it doesn't stick.  Served this with taco rice and corn.

I was fast and easy. Had a simple but favorable taste. Good with Spanish Rice. You can also add toppings to give it more flavor. like building a burrito. What your taste buds desire add to it after cooking as toppings.

This was so easy and so good!!!!  Seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, galic powder, chili powder (as per others suggestions) and pinch of cumin.  Cooke on stove top for approx 10 minutes, added salsa and mont-jack cheese and baked for about 30mins.  Can't wait to make again!

This was a quick and easy meal which was pretty good.  I didn't measure anything and just sprinkled the ingredients liberally.  I made it a one pot meal by browning the chicken in my cast iron skillet and then putting it in the oven to heat the salsa and melt the cheese. I'll definitely cook again when we need something quick.

This chicken was fabulous!  My daughters (5 and 7) asked for seconds...then asked a few days later if I would make it again.   I used a peach/pineapple salsa and served with Mexican rice (used the remainder of the salsa in the rice dish). Will make again...and again!

This is good and easy. I served with rice and black beans.  Also I used Rotel instead of salsa, was really fresh tasting.

Very very good!  I found it a bit difficult to evenly 'rub' the chicken with such a small amount of garlic, so i added garlic powder (along w/the salt, pepper and cumin) on both sides, and will probably eliminate the fresh garlic next time (though I do love it).  I also tenderized the chicken first with a mallet (always do, makes such a difference), so it was tender enough to cut with a fork.  Served with spanish rice, sweet corn, fresh cilantro and sour cream on side.  Delicious!

A nice easy way to dress up chicken breasts.  Made exactly as written and it was good, but don't over due it on the cumin or it may be too spicy.  I usually don't brown meats when a recipe calls for it, but I did on this one, and I think taste wise it makes a big difference.

This was really good. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used monterey jack, and I used generous amounts of garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Served it over brown rice, delicious!

A quick, tasty, low fat, new way to use chicken breasts.  You will probably have all the ingredients you need right in you kitchen.

I love this recipe. I will defiantly make it again. The family ate all of it in the first sitting. The only difference is that I probably cooked the chicken to long on the stove but it did not seem to affect the overall taste of the chicken.

This is really yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was very simple, yet very good.  I served it over white rice, but spanish rice would be good too.  Even the kids liked it!

We treated these like enchiladas.  We used 7 chicken breasts so I would triple the amt of spices used.  I baked them over a layer of refried beans and served with lettuce, salsa, sour cream, cheese.  We served it with a side of Spanish rice.  My family LOVED these!  Will definitely make again!

Great taste, easy to make. Next time, I think I'll  use chicken tenders to cut down on the time browning the chicken. I stood for what I felt was a long time browning the breasts. Or like one reviewer said about pounding the breasts to cook them evenly. I used rice, and boiled potatoes. With rice, they tasted so good, but not with the potatoes. At any rate, I will be serving this in the future. Thanks Karen Taylor!

This was great, fast and simple. I cut the chicken into strips, seasoned them and browned in a little olive oil. I then layered the chicken, salsa, sliced olives and then cheese Yummmmmm

This recipe was great! I made sure to use good quality salsa, and added way more than a pinch of seasoning that the recipe called for. It cooked a bit longer than the recipe said, but it was quick, easy, and very tasty.

This is terrific and incredibly easy to make. It's my go-to quick meal with stuff I always have around the house! Very easy to keep healthy too, if you just use fat free or low fat cheese. I recommend low fat though; fat free doesn't melt very well!

Absolutely delicious and so easy!!!  I cut the chicken breast in half lengthwise so they sauted very quickly and used a small jar of taco sauce in place of the salsa.  My husband scarfed this up!!!

My husband loved this! I loved how easy it was to make on a day when I wasn't in the mood for a lot of work and mess in the kitchen! I did the same thing some other reviewers did - skipped browning and just put everything in the oven for 35 minutes. Perfect! I also added diced avocado, yum!

This is a good recipe.  I switched it up a bit though and put the chicken in the crock pot.  I seasoned both sides with a little salt/pepper/cumin, layered the chicken with slices of onions and fresh cilantro and then topped with salsa.  The best part is you can make this chicken as spicy as you would like.  After the chicken was I done I shredded it and made chicken tacos- very good!

Yummy!!  I made this a couple of nights ago for dinner with Mexican rice (not off this site) I didn't have a cup of salsa, so I used a can of Rotel and sprinkled the spices instead of rubbing them into the chicken.  It didn't matter, it was very good!  Will keep this on the menu plan!

Awesome!  Next time I'll leave the salt out, the cheddar cheese and salsa has enough salt to season the chicken.  My hubby wants me to make again.

Wow this was the quickest, simplest, and tastiest recipe I ever made.  Delicious.  I served it over a bed of white rice and spooned the salsa "sauce" over the rice.  I didn't have any cumin so I used a combination of tumeric, paprika, cayenne pepper instead.  The bf loved it also.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!!

This is a great meal. What you can also do with this is put in in a wrap. Grill chicken like the recipe calls for then chop up chicken. Then add salsa & chicken to skillet cook for a few mins until salsa is heated. Fold ingrediants into large flour tortillas (makes about 10) top with cheese and bake or grill untill shell is gloden.

I overcooked it- woa woa woa. serves me right trying to make this and mexican rice and best black beans all at the same time. other than that I made no changes and its a good thing that whenever I make a new chicken dish I like to make a seperate pan of shake n bake incase it didnt turn out- go figure they prefered the shake n bake instead. why do I even bother. sigh.

It was an okay recipe. I have to be fair though, I didn't use Cheddar cheese for this, I used mozzarella, so I think that might've biased my review. Nonetheless, I don't think I'd give this recipe another go.

We used thin sliced chicken breasts.  We put all the spices in a zip-lock bag, & added onion powder to increase the amount, since a lot of the spice sticks to the bag.  Add the chicken & shake it up.  Brown on high heat. You only need to bake at 350 covered for 15-20 min ... just enough to melt the cheese.  The thin sliced breasts are practically cooked after browning.  We used a  whole jar of hot salsa.  Juicy & delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I browned the chicken and cut into bite size pieces.  I added some black beans and tossed with the chicken, then topped with salsa, then I topped with mexican cheese for more spice.  I served it with spanish rice, but next time I might just mix the rice in and make a casserole out of it.  I will definitely make again.

Excellent!  The only things I changed were 1) I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, and 2) I dredged the chicken in the garlic powder-salt-pepper-cumin minxture in a separate mixing bowl... and I upped the cumin to 1 T. or more.  Served this over a bed of "Best Spanish Rice" from this site.  A+

This is truly Quick & Easy. I used Mexican Melting cheese but other than that I did change a thing. I served it with brown rice. I asked the family how they liked it but no one answered because they didn't want to stop eating to answer me. That was all I needed. Thanks!

I just made this recipe and instead of using a jar of salsa, I made homemade salsa and did as a previous reviewer suggested, pounded out the chicken and seasoned both sides and placed salsa mixture in the pan first and then layed the flattened chicken breasts on the sauce and then smothered it with more of the homemade salsa.  I cooked up some spanish rice and layed the chicken on top of the rice and garnished with some additional cheese, slices of guacamole and diced up mango and a spoon of sour cream and voila, dinner is served

This is really GOOD! I put 1/2 cup of Salsa Verde in a crock pot and place the chicken over it.  Then I cover with the rest of the salsa and top with Velveeta PepperJack slices.  Cook on low for 8 hours and shred and serve with mexican rice.  Great for a dinner plate or shredded in burritos too. (I like it because it's low carb) Yum!

This recipe was fantastic! I changed a few things I used Garlic Salt and added Chille Powder to spice it up a bit, and instead of rubbing the seasonings in I just sprinmkled them on, other than that everything else was the same. I will definitely be making this again.

Wow! Yummy, quick, easy and light recipe!  I didn't have any cumin so I used Jalapeno and Onion Taco Seasoning with a bit of olive oil as my marinade.  I seared each side of the chicken, thin pieces, for 1 min, then baked for 8 min in salsa and broiled the 2% cheese on top for 3 min.  Tasty and delicious ~ definitely a keeper! Thanks for this healthy recipe ~

I gave it 5 stars because my family ate it up!  The chicken was very moist, and it's kid friendly.  It's a simple recipe, with minimal ingredients, so I wasn't expecting to feel like I was eating an authentic mexican dish..it was great for whats involved!  Thanks for another easy dinner for my big family!

On the first bite, my wife said "this is delicious."  On the second bite, she said "this recipe is a keeper."  It is very good.

My wife and I prefer boneless, skinless chicken thighs.

I replaced the black pepper with salt-free lemon pepper.  

I used my oven proof skillet, so there was no need to dirty a baking dish. After browning the chicken, I removed it from the pan and deglazed the pan with a little chicken broth.  I then returned the chicken to the pan and topped it with the salsa and cheese.

I used Mexican Blend shredded cheese.

My wife was right.  This recipe is a keeper, and I know it will be "in the rotation" from now on.

Amazing!! I made this for dinner and my entire family LOVED it! My husband even said he thought it was great~that's a HUGE compliment!! It's going to be something I make again. This was an easy dinner to make with younger children. I made it with some spanish rice in the microwave. I put the chicken on top of the rice and sour cream on top of the chicken. Our family gives this recipe 2 Thumbs WAY Up!! Thanks for sharing!!

It was fantastic! I used medium salsa, a little bit more then written and I sprinkled with chili the hole thing, and then topped with cheese, and baked until cheese browned. It's definetely a keeper. Thank you:)

Ok well it doesn't get any easier than this. I marinated the chicken in the oil and seasonings all day, and cooked them on the Foreman grill. For 2 chicken breasts I used 1 cup of salsa (with some of my homemade hot sauce mixed in) and about the same of cheese. Excellent recipe, Karen. Thanks!

What a great, easy recipe. I seasoned the chicken with garlic, garlic salt, Mexican blend chili powder and onion powder and used my homemade salsa. Added some sour cream on the side and served it with steamed summer squash and black beans with rice. We'll definitely make this one again. Thanks!

I made this recipe last night. Next time I would make my breasts thinner by using a tenderizer. They were too thick which made the middle unseasoned and dry. I would also use adobe seasoning. Other than that, it's great with rice!

This was an EXCELLENT meal! My family loved it. I served covered the chicken with mango salsa, which kept the chicken tender, as well as making it a little sweet. Thanks Karen!!

This is seriously amazing!  I'm on a budget, so I had to change up some of the ingredients.  Instead of cumin, I used chicken fajita mix.  And I substituted salsa with fresh home-made salsa.  Ohh... and shredded Mexican style cheese.  Yum!

Made this exactly how recommended.   It was a hit.   Easy to make also.   Good flavor.   I made the Mexican sour cream rice to go with, as suggested by another reviewer.  I will def make again.

I think the salsa I used was too sweet. I think next time I will rub the chicken with a dusting of dry taco mix with the garlic and then the cheese. That should add more flavor. But everyone liked it. I made Spanish rice and black beans on the side.
Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  Very much enjoyed by my entire family.  The only change I made, was to add onion powder, to the chicken breast, when seasoning with the cumin, garlic, etc.  I served with a Spanish rice, full of sweet peppers and onions.  Yummy.

It was pretty simple to make.  I used a dutch oven to cook it on the stove (Just two breasts) and waited 10 minutes to add the cheese so it wouldn't overcook in the oven.  Next time I might try a bit more cumin.  Two thumbs up at my house

I normally don't choose recipes because they are "quick and easy," but this one went beyond that with an interesting combination of flavors.  I paired it with brown rice cooked with tomato bullion, a simple alternative to Mexican rice.

Great recipe! I made it exactly according to the recipe with one exception. I put rinsed black beans in the bottom of the casserole dish and laid the chicken breasts on top of the beans before adding the salsa and cheese. It was delicious. I will be making it again soon.

I marinated the chicken in three heaping tablespoons of Sofrita, with that pinch of cumin as suggested in the recipe. Then followed the recipe for the rest of the way. The flavor is amazing, and the super easy to make. I served it over a bed of rice with mango and avocado slices on the side.

I added jalapenos on top of the chicken breast, and used medium spicy publix salsa, then topped with cheese. Was very good with . yellow rice

Easy & Fast for Items you already have!  But my salsa was  HOT even though labeled medium  - I had a partial lg can of frozen chopped tomatoes, so I thawed and combined with about 1/2 heaping cup of the salsa. i deglazed the fry pan with 1/2 cup chicken broth I also had on hand, added salsa, tomatoes. to the already seasoned before sauting split breasts with salt, pepper,  garlic powder & generous cumin. Bakes at 350-375 for 35 mins.  At about the 15 min mark I sprinkled with a mixture of Mexican and Sharp Cheddar cheeses.  The chicken was very tender and juicy - the  sauce was great over brown riice - definitely a great go to when the pantry is a bit bare!

Better: Skip the browning and bake split breasts with Cajun, cumin and salsa (or sliced tomato) in a 400 degree oven; add the cheese about 10 mins before done. Pair with the Mexican Sour Cream Rice Recipe. See also: Taco Seasoning 1.

The chicken might be better if marinated in a taco seasoning or something. It was ok, but not great. Maybe that's what makes it healthy??!! lol

Great weeknight recipe.  As other reviews did, I halved the chicken breasts and put them straight into the oven (did not brown them on the stove) at 375 for 30 minutes.  Came out perfect.  Served with blackens and rice.   Will definitely make this again.  Next time will add a photo - chicken was gone before I got to take on this time!!

Family likes it. Quick and simple, love that! Because it is sautéed first and then baked it doesn't get dry tough and chewy like it often does when just baked. For those that the salsa was too spicy for - sour cream was yummy solution.

I made this and I added 2 tablespoons of salsa to each breast. I couldn’t use a skillet to cook it on so I just baked it for 20 minutes, then I added the salsa and cheese  and baked for another 20 minutes. it turned out great even though I couldn’t skillet it. I also paired it with lemon pepper green beans from the site and some Mexican rice it turned out great this is definitely a new signature dish for me. I’m a beginner this is the first dinner i made for my entire family, because I’m only 13, therefore this is very quick and easy for beginners.

I added some chili powder to the garlic & cumin.  I also poured some chicken stock in the baking dish to keep the chicken most.  I cut back on the salsa, just putting on enough to lightly cover the chicken.  Then as a side, while the chicken was baking, I stir-fried sliced onions, red pepper, jalapeno and at the end added chopped tomatoes.  Will definitely do this again.

This is delicious recipe!  I made a few adjustments after reading several comments.  I added taco sauce to a can of vegetarian refried beans and spread it on the bottom of the baking dish, then added the boneless chicken breasts (uncooked) that were marinated overnight with taco seasoning mixed with brown sugar. Added 2 cups (16 oz) of salsa and shredded cheese then baked for 45 minutes at 400 degrees.  I served the chicken/beans with brown rice and a spinach salad.  What a wonderful, fast and great recipe!  This is will be one of my “go to” recipes!!

I did not deviate from the recipe. I thought that the  chicken tasted good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I also served "Best Black Beans" as a side and pretty much felt the same way about them. My son said that he really liked the dinner.

never thought I'd see this here!  been making this for years, sometimes baked, sometimes, just turned on low and a lid to finish it up!  Super easy and delicious.  Your salsa will determine how spicy it is, so if you have different ones in the fridge, you can make them to taste!

I didn't have any cumin so I used Garam Masala. Which I'm sure changed the taste a lot, but it was really really good. Not mexican at all but oh well, as long as it taste good, who cares! :P
I also added a little bit of garlic powder instead of an actual garlic clove. 

Don't hesitate to cover your chicken with A LOT of salsa! :)

This was easy and delicious. I used an enameled cast iron skillet so I only had 1 dish to wash after. I served it with black beans and rice, but the chicken was the star of the show.

I loved this concept, and it turned out great! however, I made a lot of changes. first, I can understand why many are saying theirs was bland - I ended up using the recommended spices per chicken breast and still barely taste the seasonings (just enough to be pleasant). I can't imagine seasoning 4 breasts with that little. Second, instead of whole breasts, I diced the chicken. Now I'm eating with with tortilla chips like nachos. I also used almost 2 cups of cheese. 

In the future, I'll do the same but with a different salsa.

I didn't use salt and I didn't measure anything. I sprinkled both sides of the chicken breasts lightly with cumin, black pepper, and garlic powder. It turned out very tasty, will make again.

Made this tonight using just the directions and the chicken was moist inside and very flavorful.  I just made sure not to blacken too much and there was just enough crust to seal in juices.  I used slightly more seasoning than suggested, but that was for my own taste preference.  Made some rice to go with it.

I made this recipe slightly differently and it was divine.  Season the chicken breasts.  Put in the pyrex dish, sprinkle with some corn and then put the salsa on top.  Cover tightly with foil and cook at 450 for 30 minutes.  Uncover, sprinkle with cheese and reheat for 5 minutes.  It is wonderfully juicy, very tender and everyone who has had it, wants the recipe.  So simple and definitely no need to brown the breasts.

Super-easy and makes for a delicious meal.  Just add some Mexican rice and some refried beans, and you're set.  I don't know why it occurred to me AFTER I pulled the baking dish out of the oven, but this step was totally unnecessary and makes for more cleanup and a longer prep. All you really need to do is  season and cook the chicken in the skillet, then transfer the chicken directly to the dinner plate. Add your salsa and shredded cheese on top, and zap in the microwave until the cheese is melted.  You achieve the same result.

I had 2 large-ish chicken breasts and, based on the reviews, added more of the spice, but kept the other ingredients at the same levels. I also added one can of "Mexicorn" from Mr. Green Giant, because, you know, I could. Turned out fabulous...it's going in  the rotation. Significant other thought it didn't need as much cheese, but hey, I'm the cook, right? Didn't stop her from eating it, I might add.

I followed the recipe exactly, it was very good, but would use a bit less salsa, as it could overpower the taste of the chicken. Will make again. thankyou

I have made this three times and have loved it. It's so easy to make, has very few ingredients, and turns out juicy and tender very time. I made it for company last night and they said they have never had chicken breasts so juicy since It is very hard to make chicken breasts that are not dry.

I made this as written, as I do all recipes .. you owe that to the original cook, right? You can tweak it later. This one was absolutely awesome with no need to tweak, IMHO. My adult son complained about the black olives (he doesn't like them), but hey! they're easy to pick out, so quitcherbitchin'!

I've made this Browning first rseveral times. I pound the breasts to make them thinner and uniform and I increase the seasoning. My husband LOVES it and I like it because it's so easy! In the future I'm going to try some additional seasons.  Browning first really makes a difference.

Season chicken with taco seasoning first, and no need to fry just put it in the oven raw. Cover dish until cooked then add cheese to melt. Super tender.

I halved the recipe since there are just two of us and used 4 blend Mexican cheese instead of cheddar because that's what I had on hand. My salsa is mild so I added a little (very little) crushed red pepper. Also there was some garlic and seasonings left over in the frying pan, so I added about 1/4 cup water and scraped them up, then added the salsa to warm it up before pouring over the chicken. My husband loved it and so did I. Thank you for sharing this!

This recipe earns it's way into my work/school-night dinners hall of fame.  It's easy, healthy, uses common ingredients, takes less than an hour start-to-finish, and EVERYONE loves it.   Modified:  While browning chicken in the skillet, SPRINKLE/SHAKE on the cumin, pepper, and garlic salt (much more than a pinch, as directed in the recipe).  I also sprinkled chili powder on half of the pieces - both sides.  It gave half of the dish a "kick".  I cooked enough chicken to fill a 9x13 glass baking dish.  Poured an entire 24 oz jar of chunky salsa in and 2 cups of cheddar cheese on top.

This was quick and so tasty! Based on some of the previous reviews I used taco seasoning on the chicken to make it a bit more flavorful. Also, I browned each side of the chicken but didn't cook it all the way through prior to putting it in the over. It turned out moist and perfect!

This was very good. I placed the chicken on a bed of re-fried beans with slices of large tomatoes. Served with rice.  Gave 4/5 stars because browning the chicken in a pan is messy and not my favorite thing to do.

I made this in a nonstick ovenproof lidded frying pan, clean up in a snap.  It was tasty, quick and inexpensive.  I think the best part was the crunchy burnt salsa and cheese in the bottom of the pan.

I used Fajita mix along with the listed spices to make a thicker rub.  I also baked it 15 minutes without salsa & cheese, then added those, baked another 10 and finally broiled until the cheese crusted over.  A hit with the entire family!

my husband made it for dinner and we had rice with it. I liked the chicken but it needed a teaspoon of cumin not what they called for. I used the leftover with taco shells, refried beans, lettuce, sour cream and salsa.

I wanted to make a Mexican baked chicken, so I dipped boneless, skinless chicken breasts in lowfat yogurt, then in Panko crumbs and placed them in the oven.  Then I saw this recipe, so I pulled them out of the oven, added the salsa and put them back in the oven until almost done.  Then I topped them with the cheese, and finished baking.  They were great!,  I didn't use the cumin since we don't like it, but other than a light breading the recipe was pretty much the same.  It was quick and easy, as well as a healthy, great tasting meal.  Definitely a do again!

It was  so easy and very tasty.   I definately will repeat this. Used skinless thighs. Liked seasoning the meat prior to sautéing. 
Added cheese just before serving.  Good as a second meal too.

Loved the taste. But a pinch of each of the spices was not enough to coat both sides of 4 pieces of chicken breasts.  I had to add probably a tbsp of each to make an adequate rub.

Very good. I used the chicken I had,  4 thighs. I browned the garlic and added onions also used small amount of butter for browning. set this aside and browned the chicken.  I added this as topping with salsa and added olives on top of the salsa and cheese. Over Spanish rice it is very good and an easy fix. Husband liked it.

Made it exactly as posted. Very delicious and easy. I did it all in one fry pan that could be as a casserole in the oven as well. Less cooking clean up. I am thinking that I could vary this already good recipe by using different styles of salsa. Yum??

Delicious!  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts and pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.  I used Trader Joe's Salsa Especial (medium).  Also used a little sour cream on the side as it was a bit spicy.  It was very moist and tender and you could cut it with a fork.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was very good! I added a layer of black beans seasoned with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the bottom of the baking dish and then followed the recipe to a T. Next time I'm going to add some American cheese melted with green chili sauce on top instead of the cheese recommended in the recipe. The family loved the recipe and I'll definitely make again!

I made my own salsa and to my delight, it can out fantastic! Thanks all recipes as you are now my go to. Fresh salsa I believe was the real difference as my guest was thrilled by the juicy, flavorful meal and commented on the ingredients of the salsa adding the "zing" to the overall meal

Made according to directions.. But you need more than "a pinch" of spices. I had 3 chicken breasts and used a pinch of each per side of each breast. I topped mine with a bit of mozzarella cheese as that's what I had on hand and some diced jalepenos before baking. Finished with some Cilantro and a squeeze of fresh Lime. The Lime rounded out the flavors nicely. I this is a healthy flavourful chicken option which is 21 day fix approved. (watch salsa and cheese portions). 
It made me happy, served with some spaghetti squash.

After reading reviews on flavour and other tips I decided to try this recipe with a different variation. Instead of using the garlic and other said ingredients I drizzled some oil over my chicken breasts and gave a quick toss to lightly coat then added one full package of taco seasoning mix (I also doubled the recipe) and tossed to mix and coat the chicken. I let it sit for a few hours before following the rest of the steps in the recipe. I fried the coated chicken in 1/4 cup of butter for 4 pieces and it turned out fantastic! I also used a blend of cheeses and more than the recipe called for. Baked it for 20 min and the entire family devoured it and asked for more the next night for dinner. This is a great recipe that uses only a few ingredients. I will be making this much more for my family and for get togethers.

This recipe was ok. I probably won't be making it again. The salsa on top was honestly a bit strange and gave the chicken a weird texture.

I put the chicken on a bed of rice to make it a full meal!

I cooked 1lb brown rice with mixed veggies. Add 6oz cream cheese when almost all water was boiled off. Stir well. I added fresh cut tomatoes at end. Pour into casserole dish and top with Mexican-style chicken, salsa and cheese.

I made this. I didn't really follow the measurements. I mixed salt pepper and cumin in a separate dish to taste. I chopped fresh garlic and put it on the chicken breasts and then sprinkled my seasoning on them and rubbed it in. I browned the chicken in a skillet with a little olive oil and then covered them with salsa and cheese (lots of cheese) and baked until bubbly. I added sour cream and green onions before eating  and feel the sour cream really made the difference. I will definitely be making this again!

This is on our regular rotation. Easy quick and delicious on a weeknight. Definitely follow the review that recommends Bill Echols taco seasoning. Serve with tortillas or over rice

This has to be the easiest thing I have ever made. The only thing I changed, which actually made it easier is that I browned the chicken in an oven proof frying pan so I just finished it off in there instead of transferring it to a baking dish. it could be topped with crushed tortilla chips or strips if you can find them. I served it with Pre-cooked Spanish style brown rice, canned retried beans, and a salad. Really so easy.

Easy & Delicious! Since I Don't Like Breasts, I Used Skin On Thighs & Legs. Added Cook Time In Oven About 20 Min More, Amped Up The Seasoning & Viola! Served With Spanish Rice. Yum!!

Delightful - with the following updates: half a teaspoon each of cumin, chili powder, garlic powder.  Add a few shakes of pepper.   Poured all the salsa on it. Enjoy with chips and refried beans. Wow!!

Awesome!  I made exactly as recipe, except added some fresh chopped cilantro when it came out of the oven.  Spoon juices over chicken to keep it moist.  This tastes like something out of Don Pablo's.  I paired it with Maria's Mexican Rice, which was fabulous!

Truth in advertising - this one is quick and easy! I did mine in my cast iron skillet so that I could just pop it in the oven without having to dirty another dish. Bonus, since the pan was already blazing hot, my dinner was ready in less time than it takes to make a pot of rice.

Really easy recipe. I never used this cite before until today. Its quick easy and tastes really good. I used chicken tenderloins, and instead of the Spanish Rice or noodles. I used white rice with fresh cut cilantro. It tasted really good and blended the flavor well.

My boyfriend made this for us. I know he rubbed the chicken with more than just cumin - I believe he used some Tony's and some chicken seasoning, but that's the only variation to the recipe. We both thought it came out great. We served it with some Spanish style Rice A Roni and some Mexican corn.

Because the chicken breasts we were using were quite large, we browned the seasoned breasts in butter, added salsa and cooked, covered, at 225 for several hours, to ensure tenderness before covering with the cheese.  We were also quite liberal with the spices sprinkled on the breasts before browning.  
Quite yummy

Very tasty! Completely forgot the sour cream and avocados or any toppings, just did the chicken cooked in salsa with cheese on top but still very good! Not sure I'd even try it with the toppings as it didn't need any.

It is easier than instructions show.  Sprinkled chicken with cumin, salt and pepper and fried in my cast iron skillet until browned.  I left mine in the skillet, topped with salsa and cheese and popped in the oven.  SO easy and SO good.  This is a definite keeper.

I made this for the first time, and let me tell you, my girlfriend is NOT a Mexican food person.  I did everything as described except I used 5 breast .  She came home and asked whats for dinner.  I just said it was a chicken dish.  She is a tiny person and I barely got two pieces.  She ate three and said that I could make this recipe anytime I want.    Thank you all recipes.   Real easy to make and fast.  Thanks again

What a wonderful basic recipe.  It's good as it is, I'm sure, but with a few tweaks it can be really special.  I put a can of refried beans on the bottom of the casserole and used shredded  leftover chicken.  I sprinkled the garlic, cumin, S&P over the chicken, then sliced olives and the salsa and grated cheddar.  It took only 15 minutes to heat up and with guacamole and Greek yogurt on the side was absolutely delicious.  Next time I might experiment with putting tortillas, whole or in strips to give it added body.

Even my pickiest eater loves this recipe!

I substitute garlic salt for the minced garlic.  I also use shredded cheddar/jack blend.  It melts nicer and gives it a little better flavor in my opinion.  I usually serve this with a salad and some warm flour tortillas.

Made my own salsa and omitted cilantro ( wife doesn't like it) and was heavy on the cumin to add flavor. Very moist and good. Served with salad and quinoa rice blend.

This was wonderful! Easy to make and a definite keeper. I did get a bit happy with my seasoning because I love spice. I also used a shredded pepper jack instead of the cheddar because I think cheddar is over used in too many recipes. Tasted like something off the menu at a nice Mexican restaurant.

Love Love Love this dish... kids love it... definitely a staple in my kitchen.

I've made this using taco seasoning, but if you season the meat right... you really don't need to use taco seasoning, but it does add a different taste to it.

I use chicken tenderloins; after I brown the chicken in the skillet and transfer it to the  baking pan, and add pico over the meat first, then add cheese, then a layer of salsa, then more cheese... SPICY!!!

Simple, tasty and quick. However as the smell and taste of  garlic makes me sick I omitted it. I never use garlic in any of my recipes and can never understand why so many chefs seem to use so much.

This chicken dish was moist and delicious and so easy!  I didn't have boneless chicken breasts on hand so just used what I did have - bone-in, skinless chicken breasts.  I didn't brown the chicken before baking but did extend the cooking time to allow for not browning.  A keeper for sure!!

This is a great return on investment in terms of time and ingredients. I didn't want to use the oven so made a few changes. I started with boneless/skinless thighs because they are thinner and our preference for flavor. I seasoned the chicken quite liberally (more than a pinch) and cooked it entirely on the stove. When the chicken was cooked I simply placed it on a foil lined rack, topped it with some salsa (a garlic and lime verde) and some shredded colby/jack cheese and placed it in the toaster oven for a quick broil. When the cheese was bubbly, I plated the chicken and then topped it with crumbled tortilla chips and homemade guacamole. It was easy, fast, and tasty - a great choice for a weeknight dinner.

This was so easy and quick. My husband, who is not a big fan of chicken, said he loved it. He is losing his sense of taste, so I knew I would have to add more cumin.  It would be great for most just as it is. This is also very low in fat and calories.  Loved it, and will make it again.

Made two changes. Browned chicken on grill. Transferred to aluminum pan with salsa and back on grill for 20 min. Added Mexican cheese the last 10 min. Very easy and no heat in the house. A keeper.

Surprisingly delicious, an extra star for easy!  I cooked the chicken breasts in a G Foreman grill, placed them in a baking dish, poured T Bell chunky taco sauce over it, sprinkled with shredded cheese and baked for about 15 minutes until it started to bubble around the edges.  Sprinkled some green onions over the finished dish for color.  Served with a dollop of sour cream, brown rice and a salad.  Will make this again for sure!

This is a great, quick recipe. I was looking for something to use up a jar of salsa and a pkg of cheddar cheese. Amazing! Invited my neighbors over to try it with us and they loved it as well. 5 stars for sure.

It is really great.  "Company Food" as my husband said.  It is so easy that he can even fix it next time.  I only made a few minor changes.  I flattened the chicken with a meat mallot and I used olive oil instead of spray cooking oil.  I used more than a pinch of chili powder and garlic powder.  I rubbed it in as another suggested and baked it covered for about 15 minutes .  Then I poured 1/3 cup salsa on each chicken piece and recovered for another 20 minutes.  Then I put the shredded cheese on the top and baked uncovered about 10-15 minutes to melt. This is a winner and so very easy.

I read the other reviews about the chicken being too dry/tough when it was browned before putting it into the oven.  I think that the browning time in the instructions is too long.  I quickly browned the chicken on each side after seasoning it--no more than 2 minutes on each side and it turned out great.
The meat was moist and tender.  I also suggest that you sauté the garlic in olive oil before browning the chicken.  Then remove it from the skillet to keep it from burning.  The garlic flavor is infused in the oil and then transferred to the chicken as it browns.  My family loved this. It is so simple and the flavor suggests a much more complex dish than the recipe ingredient list warrants.  I used Newman's Own All Natural Mild Salsa and it provided a wonderful depth of smokey flavor.  An additional benefit to using this brand--all profits go to charity!

Super easy and quick. Husband and kids loved it! To serve, I sliced each breast crosswise into 4 pieces, added a slice of avocado on top for a better presentation and served with sour cream and rice. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is an easy, quick, delicious recipe to put together. I was at a loss for what to have for dinner. I always have chicken in the freezer, so I came to Alrecipes.com and picked this one since I had everything I needed in the pantry. I used 2 breasts and 2 thighs, chunky salsa and sharp cheddar cheese. As for the "pinch" for the seasonings, I used my regular rule of thumb, sprinkle til it seems right. Served with black beand and spanish rice. Excellent.

As written this is a very quick, good tasting recipe.Perfect for two, four or sixty. Chicken breasts has no flavor, but this topping makes it taste very good.

Absolutely love this recipe and make it quite often. I can't wait til my garden grows in so I can use home made salsa instead of store bought! Sometimes I brown the chicken before hand and sometimes I do it straight from raw, both ways are delicious! My seasoning is a mixture of things, mainly cumin, garlic salt (instead of cloves) and a few other random things. Also, instead of straight cheddar cheese, I specifically buy Fiesta/Mexican shredded cheese mix. This is definitely a great core recipe and offers you the ability to experiment.

Amazing! Moist, tender, and full of flavor! Definitely a keeper for my family. (I used rather large "pinches.") Served with Spanish rice, refried beans, and sweet tea. For dessert, Impossible Coconut Pie II.

I loved how my chicken came out. I followed the recipe for the most part but just added a few ingredients. I seasoned the chicken with adobo, sazon, cumin, a touch of celery salt, a touch of garlic powder, and a touch of cayenne pepper. (Simple salt and pepper never does it for me) I then rubbed minced garlic into it and fried it as directed. Then I put it in an oven pan and rubbed some chipotle sauce on top of it, then the salsa, cheddar cheese and some chopped up green onion/chives and jalapeno. It went into the oven and when it came out I ate it with some sour cream and guacamole with a side of tostones. It was amazing.

This was fast and easy.  Our family likes a bit of a kick so I added a bit more cumin and garlic.  Someone suggested a mexican rice recipe on this site that I made and it went well with the chicken.  Will definitely make again. Yum!

This was not only delicious, but super easy!  After reading some of the reviews, I did season the chicken a little more before cooking it in the skillet with salt, pepper, garlic powder and adobo. I sautéed a little minced garlic in butter and then added the chicken.  I followed the rest of the recipe as shown and the chicken came out perfectly....my family absolutely loved this recipe!

Was quite liberal with minced garlic, cumin, salt and pepper. Had my doubts about this recipe but loved it.  Did sauté the chicken for 20-25 minutes so it was almost cooked then baked for 15 minutes with salsa and cheese.  Delicious.  Will definitely become a regular.

Just made this dish this evening, and we really liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I made a mixture of a teaspoon of each of the spices, then sprinkled that liberally all over the breasts, along with the minced garlic.  A "pinch" would not have been nearly enough!  I seared the breasts, then covered the skillet and cooked on medium temp for fifteen minutes.  I wouldn't recommend skipping this step, it added a nice flavor and texture, and they weren't dry at all.  Then salsa on top, liberal sprinkling of cheese, then in the oven for fifteen minutes.  I see this as a quick and easy meal, with the ability to add things here and there (change up the salsa, add jalapenos, or whatever).  Will be making again :)

I am new to cooking and I found this easy to make and in about 45 minutes (With rice). Innstead of a pinch of salt, pepper, and cumin I applied pretty generously and it came out with a nice flavor.

Made a paste of cumin and olive oil and rubbed the chicken pieces with that and baked it at 400 F. Came out beautifully and very flavourful.  Its a keeper!

My kids ate every bite and then some! I like anything that accomplishes that obstacle. I bought a big pack of tenderloins instead of breasts to make more and to cost less. I cooked just the browned chicken and salsa for about twenty minutes then I added cheese and green onions and cooked another ten min. When seasoning the chicken I used seasoned salt instead of plain salt. Served with taco rice and sour cream. I will definitely make this again!

very tasty and tender.  i used thighs instead of breasts, and browned in olive oil on medium-high for about half the time suggested.  i also used more salsa than recommended, probably almost double, so i could use the sauce from the pan on rice.  might even just cook over rice next time as a casserole. could be a one dish recipe if you use a cast iron skillet.

No muss, no fuss, and delicious!! I did not pan sear the breasts before putting into the over. I simply put them in the baking dish (seasoned) and pre-baked for 15 minutes. Then removed and put the salsa and cheese on them and then back in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until the cheese began to bubble and brown.  It came out perfect!  A few slices of jalapeno and a dollop of sour cream, with black beans and rice as a side dish, and we were good to go and very happy!!  One cooking dish and two dinner plates to clean up ... in and out of the kitchen with a truly gourmet meal!! Me and my husband loved it!!  Try it, you won't be disappointed!!

I gave this 5 stars for the ease of the recipe, but made some changes of my own. I used taco seasoning instead of cumin( I don't like the taste of it) and added chopped green peppers and onion to it as well. I put the salsa in the blender and then poured it over the chicken which I cut into bite size pieces. Served it with rice with Taco seasoning and onion powder and garlic powder in it. It was delish!!!!! We at it with burrito shells as well. This is one I will fix again!!! Yummy!

Easy and fast... What's not to like? I did add some onions, cilantro and fresh lemon juice. Much better than the sum of it's parts for sure. Just be sure to brown your chicken before putting in the oven for maximum flavor. Yum Yum

Easy, edible, but nothing to write home about..the best comment I got from the family was "it's alright" (an opinion I share).  There are probably much better recipes on this site to make a quick & easy meal out of boneless, skinless chicken breasts...suggest you move on to those recipes instead.

This was quick and easy and very tasty. Makes an elegant meal. Only recommendation I would have would be to use a quality salsa if using commercial. Better yet, I'll make my own salsa or pico de gallo next time. Picky brother-in-law liked it so it was good. Will make again.

I used Mrs. Renfro's Hot Jalapeno Green Salsa and 3 blend Mexican cheese.  It was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.  The kids liked it too.  I served it over rice and also served corn chips and tomatillo chipotle salsa.  Great dinner.

My family really liked this chicken. I skipped the garlic and used mozzarella (what I had in the fridge) and didn't measure the spices but used way more than a pinch of cumin. Worked great with a quinoa salad for a fast mid week dinner. My 5 year old was eating leftovers as a bedtime snack. A keeper.

I made this dish "quicker and easier" by omitting the step of browning the chicken in a skillet. I also marinated the chicken in Cajun Seasoning before I decided to make this, so I omitted the cumin. I added the cheese at the end rather than cooking it the entire time. My husband really liked the flavor of this chicken dish and I found it to be extremely easy, so I will definitely make it again.

My husband said it was good, so I will make it again.  Served it over buttered noodles, so will try doing it over rice next time. I browned the chix in skillet w/butter, then put in the oven.  The cheese melted, but did not get brown and bubbly.  I used Jardines (sp?) Ranch Chipotle medium salsa and sharp cheddar with a bit of sour cream upon serving.  Will try some of the other suggestions next time, i.e. black beans, olives, etc... Thanks!!!

This was just okay for me.  The flavor was okay but the texture of the chicken was terrible.  This could have totally been my fault or my particular pieces of chicken.  I was afraid of the garlic burning in the pan and ruining the whole meal so instead of cooking it completely through on the stove, I seared it and let it finish cooking in the oven.  I'm not an experienced cook, so I'm not sure if this is where the problem was.  I'll probably try it again just because of how quick and easy it is to put together and convenient ingredients.

Have been making this for a few years.  I don't precook the chicken breasts.  I slice the top of the chicken breasts (about four times) leaving about a quarter inch still intact.  I fill the slits with the salsa and then add the cheese and bake. The flavor of the salsa really goes through the meat this way.

Easy, delicious, and actually, I thought, quite visually appealing.  The salsa I had on-hand was nothing special (some sore brand that Smart & Final sells in a 64 oz. jug), but the end result was spectacular.  The chicken breasts I used were quite large, so it did take longer than 15 to 20 minutes for them to be done; after about 20 minutes, I simply tented the baking dish with foil so the cheese wouldn't burn.  Next time, I may pound the breasts to reduce the cooking time.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I would defiantly make this again, even if it weren't so quick and easy!

My husband and I loved this chicken.  I sprinkled the chicken with kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, and some chili powder.  I put some salsa in the bottom of my pan and also liberally applied the salsa and cheese on top of the chicken for baking.  We really enjoyed this with Mexican rice.  I would definitely make it again!!!!

I made this with wild duck breasts and it turned out really well! I seasoned well with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cumin. Served over white rice. Next time I'll do a little more salsa to make a semi gravy for the rice. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made it with Newman's corn and bean salsa. Did not brown, but threw it all in and cooked for about 40-45min on 375*. Served over Spanish rice with a little low fat sour cream. Easy and very good. Definate keeper.

Excellent yummy dish - my daughter loved it!  I used taco sauce instead of salsa and it worked great.  Served it with Spanish rice and it was a big hit.  I will definitely be making it again :)

This is my husbands new favorite food!  I didn't really alter the recipe at all (just used jarred minced garlic, not fresh), and served it over egg noodles.

Good-  i used a fajita seasoning packet to marinate the chicken.  Totally omitted the browning on the stove and just baked in the oven until cooked an then topped with a 4 mexican cheese blend. Served with rice and salad. Thanks!

Great recipe thats quick and easy...we make this one on weeknights! I browned the chicken in a skillet before baking in the oven (I think that gave it more flavor). Baked for 25-30 minutes and came out perfect!!!

I had to increase the amount of cumin, garlic, and cumin for the rub.  I did substitute a can of hot Rotel for the salsa.  This turned out good.  Served it with fresh avocado, lettuce, and black beans wrapped in a tortilla for a yummy burrito!  Next time, I will try the review where the instant spanish rice is cooked with the chicken in the oven!  Sounds like a true time saver!

Amazing, quick dinner!  I added some ranch dressing to salsa, and served with tortilla chips & mexi rice.  The result is basically Fiesta Lime Chicken from Applebee's (formerly called Tequila Lime Chicken).  Yum yum!!

This is an excellent, easy and very tasty dish.  It is so easy to customize to your taste with mild to spicy salsa.  The leftovers were even better so the next time I make this I will double the recipe.

Make it quicker, easier and more spicy by cooking chicken with seasonings on a George Foreman grill and topping with a slice of pepperjack cheese, let melt before adding the salsa.

Great recipe - so quick and simple.  I combined the salt, pepper, cumin and garlic together to make a rub, then browned in a skillet with a tiny bit of light oil.  Turns out very moist and will freeze a few portions for later!  Served with rice and a nice spinach salad.

I thought this recipe was easy and pretty doggone good! I had boneless thighs and Mexican fiesta shredded cheese on hand so that is what I used. I didn't have cumin so I used taco seasoning mix and bumped up all the spices. Next time I will use salsa with a little more kick!

This was our 16 year old son's first recipe he cooked (with a bit of supervision from Mom!).  He did a great job.  The directions were easy to follow, and the results were outstanding!  He said it was definitely a keeper!  That is about the highest compliment he can pay to a recipe, and both my husband and I would have to agree!

Superb!  Easy and delicious.  Served with Mexican Rice II from this site.  Made exactly as instructed and it was so good and easy.  Next time I will try baking in the oven to cut down on dishes.  This is a new favorite!

Four stars for ease of preparation.  I tried this last week with jarred salsa, and was not impressed.  Last night I tried it with homemade salsa, and it was much better.  I served it with rice, the refried beans without refrying from this site, and sliced avocado.

This was truly quick and simple.  I used more cheese than called for to get my picky eater to try it and he ate it without complaint!  I served with Lipton Spanish rice and sweet corn.

We cut the recipe in half and instead of rice or noodles layered: 10" tortilla, re-fried beans, drained canned corn, chicken pounded thin, salsa and cheese.  Follow baking directions in recipe.  Serve with Tortilla chips.

You need to add about half a teaspoon of seasoning for the rub (for each of those), not a pinch. Makes flavoring better! But good recipe

This was very good and incredibly easy to make - perfect recipe for a Friday night after work and we don't feel like doing a lot of fussing!  Served it with brown rice spanish rice (made with salsa and 2 chopped tomatoes.)  Will definitely keep this recipe on hand to make again in the future!

This recipe is great!  I didn't have a whole cup of salsa on hand so I used probably 1/3 cup along with a little Cholula hot sauce.  I also used reduced fat cheddar...and less of it.  So very delicious, and my (picky) husband loved it, too!

I have made this since for the past 15 years for my grandkids.  I always use a whole jar of salsa and serve it with spanish or mexican rice and mexican corn.  Always a hit.  Great for potluck dinners using cut up chicken.

I made this recipe and the name says it all...quick and easy!  I used canned salsa (usually I would make my own) and about 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp salt, and used about 1 smallish garlic clove per chicken breast.  Delicious.  Even my picky 4 year old said it was the best chicken ever.

4.5   Not enough spices to rub into the chicken (and I did cut them up in pieces).  Served with brocolli/cauliflower and a rice pilaf made of olives, onions and canned mild chile peppers.

Didn't have salsa so I seasoned chicken with cumin, pepper and taco seasoning. Browned it then added 1/2 cup Italian dressing and 1/2 cup BBQ sauce(from another recipe I make) and simmered until done adding cheese at the end. Pretty good! Thanks for the base recipe :)

A variation on this for an Italian dinner is to use a jar of spaghetti sauce. Oil dish, add half of sauce on bottom, add chicken, sprinkle with parmesan cheese, add rest of sauce, top with mozzarella and bake for about 35 min. Serve on pasta.

This was a quick and easy chicken recipe.  If you are looking for something different give it a try.  Using my non stick oven ready skillet to brown the chicken saved an extra dish at clean up.  To spice it up a bit more I topped the cheese with Old Elpaso Taco Seasoning.  In future I would serve with rice and a tossed salad.

Me and my husband LOVED this!!  I used a smooth, restaurant style salsa and this tasted like something a mexican restaurant would serve. Served with spanish rice, and refried beans with shredded lettuce, tomatoe, guacamole and sour cream. Thanks for posting!

This was REALLY good! I went an extra step and made my own salsa instead of using store-bought salsa. That gave me the extra texture and freshness I like in veggies. :)

A great-tasting dish! Like some others, I didn't brown the chicken first. The only salsa I had on hand was a mild green chili sauce and it worked out very well. I just popped it into the oven for about 35 minutes.   I served it with Spanish Rice with a little of the green chili sauce stirred into that as well. A definite keeper and regular part of the menu! Thanks!

I am a complete CLUTZ in the kitchen and am on a student budget (as in, I don't have many ingredients lying around the flat typically).  I stuck to the recipe, except I used some cajun spices instead of the cumin to kick it up a bit.  SO GOOD!  I couldn't believe how moist it was, or how easy it was to make.  I'll be making this again and again!  Maybe next time I'll add some peppers and onions to it before I bake it.

This is a really good recipe. I skipped the skillet and cooked it in the oven for about 25 minutes, turned it and added the cheese and salsa, then baked for another 15 minutes.  I used On the Border salsa, a favorite in our house.  It turned out so good and was so easy.

Yum!  I only had bone in chicken thighs, so used those and they worked fine.  Family loved it - I served with "best black beans" and "golden sweet cornbread" both from this site.  Will definately make again.

Delicious, easy and made with things most people already have on hand. The only change I made was to use two diced chicken breast rather than whole. This is a keeper for sure!

Very very good.  My family loved this, although next time I may add more of the spices, just because my family loves them all.

I really enjoyed this chicken, the flavor was very good and I actually used the spice mix on chicken to put it burritos another time and they were delicious! 

This was very easy and tasty.

I cook for one and this recipe was easily paired down. I did brown my chicken in a skillet and then toped with salsa, pepper jack cheese, and a little cheddar. My skillets are oven safe so I just popped it in the oven for about 20 mins and it came out perfect. It had such great flavor and was very moist and tender. Along with other reviewers I too pounded out my chicken and sprinkled with salt, pepper, cumin, and garlic powder. Yum, Yum! This is definitely a keeper ;)

Really good! i didn't use the fry pan either, just rubbed the cumin in, and used garlic salt and pepper. i used tenderloins.  Once they were almost done, i put about a tblspn of Garden Fresh Salsa Artichoke and Garlic and then the cheese.  They were wonderful! The b/f asked for seconds!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband liked this a lot and even the kids like it. Definite keeper. We used a smooth salsa, not at all chunky, which I think made it more kid-friendly.

We liked this.  I took some suggestions from another review and cut the chicken into strips and  I used hot salsa.  I served it with Spanish Rice II.  I would make it again.

It gave the chicken a good flavor, and it tasted great alongside the spicy beans and rice in the burrito!

This is a very good meal.  I heated some olive oil, garlic, and chopped onion to the pan and let it cook for about 5 min.  Then I added the chicken to the pan (I cut mine in chunks).  I used swiss cheese because thats what I had. (I also use a good amount of cumin.)I put this chicken over Orzo.  It came out delicious (all though it didn't look the greatest)  I was looking for something quick and easy...and it came out much better than I thought it would.
