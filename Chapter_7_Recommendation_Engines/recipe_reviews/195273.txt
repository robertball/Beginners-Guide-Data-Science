This is an incredibly easy dish to make and tastes good.  It's like Hamburger Helper, but without paying for an overpriced box of noodles and spices.  I'll make again next time I have extra pasta sauce and beef laying around. (Tip: Use whatever pasta sauce you want, not just Ragu!)

Mix between spaghetti and hamburger helper but not quite as good as either one. I do appreciate how easy it was though. I kept having to add water and cooked noodles a lot longer.

I used Lawry's seasoning salt on the buger, I used whole wheat rotini, and Emril's Garlic Pasta sauce. I also only had shredded chedder cheese, so I used that instead. I took "Laura"'s advice and put the browned burger, water, pasta & sauce in a big pot for the second step. my hubby and 3 year old loved it as well. Fast and Easy and Filling, perfect for a work-week evening.

Nice combination with this dish. Reminds me of goulash. This is a quick, easy meal, and makes for good leftovers over the following two days. This was a good "comfort food" dish for the week.

I definitely like the concept of this meal. Ever since I've made it my boyfriend always wants me to cook the pasta in with the sauce for everything! I did have to make some changes though, well i kept everything the same except I added 2 tsp. minced garlic, 2 tbs. dried parsley, 1 half red onion (cooked with the meat), seasoning salt, and also additional salt and pepper. Also topped it with parm cheese, delish! Thanks for posting.

This recipe was really easy to make, and really good! Like home-made hamburger helper! Easy clean-up too.  I used Penne instead of Rotini, but it still turned out great. I think next time I may add some spices though  a tip: use a big pan, it gets tricky to stir once all the pasta, water & sauce is added.

This was good and I loved the fact that it was in a skillet! I did make it slightly different by cooking onions, garlic and peppers with the ground beef and also cooking the pasta seperately. I will def make it again.

This was a very easy dish to make. I added one chopped onion, one Tablespoon oregano, and a teaspoon of minced garlic. After browning the beef and onion, adding the sauce, spices, pasta, and water, I simmered it for 10 minutes then transferred the mixture to a glass baking dish and topped it with the cheese. I baked it in a 350 oven for 20 minutes. Delicious!

I didn't change anything but I thought it was a bit plain, if I make again I'll try to spice it up a bit.

Made this for 6 toddlers & they ate it all!  Kids absolutely loved it & I will definitely make again.  Only changes I made was seasoning.  I added some minced onion, minced garlic, basil, oregano, & black pepper.  Next time I will have to double the recipe so there is enough for the adults. :)

Delicious! My husband loved it. As a previous reviewer recommended, I made some changes. I used a can of tomato sauce and added 1 tsp. garlic salt & oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, minced onions, and a pinch of salt. I also added some milk to the sauce to make it more creamy. Delicious!

A good, quick & easy meal.    Add some dried herbs like oregano or basil unless the sauce you choose has it in already.   I make a meal like this using sour cream (half the amount) instead of tomato sauce that's really good.   Add garlic and sage to this one.

Good stuff! I agree with other reviewers that something was missing though. But the hubs and I liked it a lot! First time I made it I did not use a big enough pan, so I used a pot the second time. And it does take the noodles a little longer to cook. The end result is an easy, delicious meal that the whole family will love!

This was exactly what I was looking for.  I did make a few substitutions to fit our tastes.  We usually have chicken sausage on hand rather than ground beef because we like it better.  I also didn't have any canned spaghetti sauce on hand, so I used my own which I make in the summer and freeze.  I also used a combination of velveeta white cheddar cheese, and this tasted similar but SO much better than the boxed meal.  Thank you so much for posting.  I will never have to buy the fake box food again!

Yummy! My family loved this; even my picky eaters. Thanks! I even had to make it with cheddar cheese since I didn't have mozz. I will definitely try this again with mozz or montery jack next time. Add sour cream to make it creamier!
