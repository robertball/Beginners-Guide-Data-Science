I took this recipe and made a few changes and it was delicious. 
1. I used a mixture of ground pork and beef instead of turkey (.75 lbs beef, .25 lbs pork).
2. Instead of frying the meatballs I baked them. 350 degrees, 30-35 minutes.

I used this as a base recipe. They turned out stupendous! Made them three days in a row. Changes I made: used ground beef, add salt and pepper to taste, cubed mozarella instead of using cheese string and I breaded the meatballs. whisk egg in bowl, salt and pepper to taste. Have one bowl with 1/4 cup flour and another bowl 1 cup seasoned italian breadcrumbs. Then dip meatballs in flour, coat in egg mixture and coat in breadcrumbs. Super delicious with a crispy coating!

Recipe was simple and quite easy. I found it odd that there were no other seasonings besides the bread crumbs so I added salt, pepper and onion powder. I would probably try baking the meatballs next time as I would prefer not to use the oil in the skillet. Recipe turned out moist and tasty meatballs.

Very good!  I made some changes though.  I added 1T chopped onion, 2T grated parmesan cheese, 1t seasoned salt, and 1/4t pepper.  I didn't have egg beaters so I used one beaten egg instead and used cubed monterey jack cheese.  I browned the meatballs first and then baked them in the spaghetti sauce at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes, as some other cooks suggested.  They turned out great.  We ate them on toasted buns instead of spaghetti and everyone liked them.  I am looking forward to making this again.  Thank you for sharing such a good recipe.

These little guys are SO TASTY and versatile!  My family's all time favorite is when I make these with BBQ sauce around the holidays.  Instead of chopping up mozzerella cheese, I just use the fresh mozz. cheese "pearls" you can get at most supermarkets.  I make the meatballs ahead of time, freeze them, and then when there is a family get-together I take them out of the freezer the day before, throw them in a crock pot with some BBQ sauce in the morning, and they are done and GONE by the afternoon!  They are also really good with a nice homemade sweedish meatball sauce.  Nobody can tell they are turkey!

Used ground venison, browned the meatballs and then baked in the oven with a little sauce over them for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Came out perfectly cooked. Definitely needs spices in the meat mixture; they were kind of bland.

I thought these were good, first time ever using ground turkey. I added salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, otherwise did everything the same. I think next time I will bake them instead of frying.

Sorry, thought it was bland.  Needed Italian spices, garlic, onion, crushed fennel seeds, maybe.

Extremely quick and easy to make. I love it! I added some extra Italian spices and minced garlic to my sauce. This is a great recipe to replace cheap unhealthy pasta and fatty ground beef.

Great recipe and easy to make. However I would add some additional seasonings for taste. Also, I would bake the meatballs like others suggested instead of cooking in the skillet. Family loved and will make again!

i have to say this was an easy but yet delicious recipe. I had to add my own ingredients because i knew that the bread crumbs alone wouldnt be enough. but this was great.

Nice meatballs.  A little time consuming, but fun to have the mozzarella inside.  I rarely make meatballs, so I followed the recipe (relatively, used mozzarella ball that I cut--no string cheese) and cooked on the stove top.  Next time I think I'll bake--these ooze out mozzarella, and make for greasier than necessary meatballs on the stove top.  All in all, though, we loved these.  Very good with pasta.

These meatballs were really yummy and really easy. I added some salt, pepper and garlic powder to my ground turkey because I think it would  have been a little bland otherwise and I also spiced up the sauce. Otherwise this recipe is really good and a great, easy twist on spaghetti and meatballs. My fiance LOVES spaghetti and meatballs and these totally passed his test.

Great basic meatball recipe and the cheese makes it a winner! Could use more flavor, though - I added 1 t salt, 1/2 t pepper, 1/4 t onion powder and 1/4 t garlic powder and still thought it could use more seasoning!

Had to make a lot of changes. Taste was very bland for the first few I made. I added garlic, onion and red pepper flakes.  I also used a smaller piece of string cheese as the first few didn't melt and were still cold.  Once changes had been made they were awesome.  As posted this is a base to grow from.

Need to add lots of your own seasonings to give it flavor. I've made it twice so far and it's delicious
