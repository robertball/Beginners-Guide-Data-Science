We've been making this punch for at least 20 years and it ROCKS!  I don't know who kerri is, but this is the original southern comfort recipe.  You have to watch out for the people who don't drink or aren't uses to drinking because this can pack a wallop.  It's decieving because its sweet and smooth going down. The effects aren't felt until you stand up.---Watch grandma by the punch bowl!   lol  PS we always added a full jar of maraschino cherries to the bowl

This made the family dysfunction a lot more tolerable.  Thanks for a great recipe.  No hangover either.

To be honest with you, I have been making this now for a few years. Thanks to this website. Since our family travels quite a bit for the holidays to different parties and such, I make this for Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Years... For a different crowd to each. EVERYONE RAVES about this punch, I have to make recipe cards each year to pass out because after the first year my hand was cramped from writing it down so many times.  Over the years I have tweaked it.. I buy either 7-up Pomegranate or Sierra Mist with Cranberry (for color and taste) and I get pink lemonade (helps with the color as well) (No red food dye is needed this way) Again many thanks to Kerri and her Fantastic recipe!!

I used this last nite for a dinner party and it went down REALLY well! In fact, so well that I had 2 make another bowl when it was finished. My sisters and her friends (that are 11 yrs old)had a taste and they loved it too.....so it must have been good. I think every1 should use this! I'm going to continue!

I used this for a shower. It was a big hit! Everyone wanted the recipe. I only put a half bottle of liquor, and added cherries. I will positively do it again

My name is Kerri as well so I thought it was a given I had to make this punch. It was very yummy and a hit at my new year's eve party. I will make it for every party now. I had to give it one star for kid friendly because it had alcohol in it but if it didn't kids would love it!

This punch was delicious and so easy to make.  I ran out of room in my punch bowl and was only able to use 2 Liters of soda...it was still a huge hit with all of my guests!

This was great! I ended up buying the 12 oz cans of lemonade/oj by accident, so I just froze the combined leftovers so I'll have it onhand next time I make this. Didn't bother with the food coloring, and the cherries I bought sunk to the bottom (used the jarred kind - I guess the recipe intended fresh to be used?) Ended up spearing 2 red and 2 green cherries w/toothpicks and poked one through the center of four orange slices that were floating (the lemon slices flipped over when I tried it - too small.) SO festive looking! Loved the lightness of the carbonated drink - not too sweet. Served its purpose - got us all warm and fuzzy at a "pre-party" party! Thanks!

This was a HUGE hit at my party this weekend.  I didn't bother adding the food coloring, and it still looked pretty with all the garnishes floating in it.  The only problem was that I ran out halfway through the night and everyone was begging for more!

Fantastic! Bubbly, fruity, and you can't taste the alcohol. My kind of drink!  I used 2 liters of soda (the readily available size) and it tasted perfect.   Helpful hint: I froze the lemon and orange slices and found this kept the punch cold without diluting it (as happens with ice).

This punch was FANTASTIC.  A few hints:  make sure you get the 100 proof Southern Comfort.  It's a bit too watered down otherwise.  Also freeze the fruit slices a few hours before, they act as ice cubes to keep the punch cold.  I followed the recipe exactly (with diet soda to cut some calories) and it was all gone for my Super Bowl party!  I was already asked to make it again for the next event!

This is also a great summer punch.   Mix all of the ingredients except the soda and freeze it over a two day period stirring frequently. Serve it in plastic cups with 3/4 cup of slush mixture topped off with the lemon-lime soda.  whoever Kerri is...this is a winner!

Brought this to a New Years Even party and whipped it up there.  It was great!! We doubled the recipe, except for the cans of concentrate - they only come in 12 oz. sizes anyway, so that worked out.  didnt use the maraschino cherries either.  people raved, and it went down smooth!  cant wait to have another excuse to make it.

Fantastic! Subbed 1L of tonic water for 1 of the L of soda. I used pink lemonade and pink soda (Sprite + cranberry?) and no food coloring. Everything else was the same and it was YUM! Definitely chill everything separately - I thought the frozen stuff would be enough for it to be cold, but it wasn't. User error!

I'm not much of a drinker, so a little went a long way for me.  Served this at a holiday party and everyone enjoyed it.  I did mistakenly use gingerale instead of lemon-lime soda, but folloed the recipe otherwise.

AWESOME- even for those who don't like hard liquor. I didn't use lemon juice- just a whole can (12 oz) of lemonade and skipped the red food coloring- didn't need it as the color looked nice without it.  I made a few mixed drinks for a large party and this was most popular.

This recipe was a hit....I halved the recipe and by mistake used 6 ounces of each of the frozen juices and eliminated the lemon juice...it was still awesome!  Instead of red food coloring I added a few maraschino cherries with its juice.  Im thinking for this summer to make this a slushie drink!  Thank you and Happy New Year!

A big hit, but weaker than expected.  Also very sweet, so I added another 1 L of club soda.  Perhaps next time would only do 2 L of lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage and 1 L of club soda.

I was hesitant to fix this because I'm not a Southern Comfort fan but you can't even taste it. I used the Sierra Mist Cranberry in place of Lemon-lime flavored soda and skipped the food coloring which gave it a great Christmasy color. This cocktail tastes great but packs quite a punch!

Yummy! Left out the food coloring and lemon juice.  I made this once before and thought it was too citrusy with the lemon juice. Try freezing the orange and lemon slices to help keep the punch cold. A Keeper!

This is excellent, now a family favorite. I had a lot left over though and froze it. Used it New Year's Eve by taking out of freezer until slush consistency and adding some sprite. Delicious!

I made this last night for a holiday party and it went over very well. We actually ran out, I should have made two batches! Will make again for New Years. I followed other reviews and used pink lemonade and used grenadine cherry juice for the coloring.

Made this punch for my Halloween Party that I had and it was a tremendous hit. I am not a big Southern Comfort fan so I was a little apprehensive when making, but once I tasted I knew it would be the hit of the party and it was. I only had about 6 guests that were drinking it but there was only enough for 1 glass at the end of the evening. I will definitely recommend to friends and I will be making this again real soon. Thanks for the great recipe!

We tried this for the first time last night. WOW! This is our new punch recipe. It is delicious, does not taste like alcohol, and packs a wallop!

Just like everyone has said, this punch is AWESOME! I used Sprite Zero to help save on the sugar content. It was delicious! We had 27 people, not all of which were drinking. We made servings for 40 and we ran out. A huge party hit, just wish I would have taken everyone's advice and made more!!

This was the biggest hit out of everything at my Christmas Eve party. I will make this punch for every gathering I have.  I did add a 20oz sunkist to it as well. I didn't bother with the food coloring and it came out a bright orange color, very cute.

Used store brand cranberry soda for half of the lemon lime as suggested by others.  Served with the Southern Comfort on the side.  It was a bit tart plain but surprising smoother after adding the alcohol.  Would have been great with raspberry sherbet floating on top.

Loved it! I used raspberry lemonade concentrate to give it the pink coloring and also added maraschino cherry juice as other reviewers did.  I froze the cherries in lemonade in a mini-cupcake tin and used them as ice so the punch wouldn't get watered down.  It was a great blend of tart, sweet, and fizzy!

I couldn't crack this punch out fast enough, I didn't use quite as much southern comfort as was called for but the punch was nice and smooth and perfect for summer.  I had made another batch as I had this for a large party and it was easy to do ahead of time and just throw lemon lime soda in at the last minute.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a good recipe.  I searched high and low for a nice recipe for my Christmas Party. This punch was gone with in 1 hour.  I only made one batch and everyone was asking me all night to make some more.  Here it is 3 days after Christmas and everyone is asking me what I put in that punch.  P.S. This punch packs a punch.

This was good! I made it for our Christmas party with a new group of people. I wasn't sure how everyone would mingle or even if people would drink since it started early. I was looking for a "sneaky" punch to make the party fun! 

To my delight, everyone, even those who brought their own beer or wine, drank my punch! And drank, and drank! I made a double batch, and only had a little left, and a lot of jolly guests! 

I used 12 oz cans of the frozen stuff, 2 L of some sort of red 7 up and added cold water in place of the rest just because I didn't buy enough 7 up. It was plenty sweet and citrus-y. I like sweet drinks, but was glad I only used 1 bottle of soda because it might have been too sweet with 6 L of "carbonated beverage." 

Even a minister drank several cups ;) Try it! It will be fun!

So delicious! I make this for parties, and everyone loves it. Just be careful how much you drink, because you don't really taste the alcohol - it's the kind of punch that sneaks up on you!

This is my go-to punch for any large gathering--and it is a favorite of all our friends.  One concern is that it is so tasty that it can certainly pack a punch...so be careful! ;)   Overall, I am thrilled that I found this recipe--we even served it at our wedding reception!

This punch rocked. I added way more cherries than the recipe called for and used a bottle of champagne instead of sprite. Served this at New Years and it was very potent! Not too sweet either–the guys and girls all loved it. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a huge hit for our New Year's party.  I made 1 1/2 times the recipe for 12 adults, and it was gone by the end of the night.  I froze in a mold, orange juice and lemon juice to float in the punch.  Also, I premixed everything except the soda and added that when my guests arrived.

I made this for some friends at a party I threw. The general consensus was "not bad" . . .untill they started drinking it for a while.  Maybe it's just us but for some reason it seemed to get worse the more you drank it.  Overall not a horrible drink but I'm still looking for a good recipe

Like several other reviewers, I have been making this punch for a few years now. I do not typically write reviews, but I felt like I had to share--this is THE BEST alcoholic punch recipe out there, and SO easy. Since the first time I made it, it is always understood that I am in charge of the punch for parties and showers, and I always bring this. The only change I have made is to omit the red food coloring (sometimes I use cranberry Sierra Mist or Cherry 7-Up, sometimes I don't and it is just as good) and I always add a bag of Sonic Ice--very soft round slushy stuff that I think makes this punch even better. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

We had our annual Holiday Open House last night. This is a big event for us - 70+ people. We made 3 batches of this - it was a huge hit with men and women. It is not sweet and it goes down really well/quickly. I can see where this would work well at holiday parties as well as in the summer for BBQ's.  We did not put the cherries in - those would sink to the bottom. We also did not put in food coloring, but used the juice from jars of cherries instead.  Fantastic recipe - super easy to mix up.  Definite keeper & a repeat!!!

big hit!  Had to use the bottled lemonade and orange juice and added a cranberry gingerale instead of one of the lemon-lime carbonated beverage.

I made this punch two years ago for a holiday party and people have been asking for it ever since! Great recipe, easy and definitely a crowd pleaser. I added a jar of maraschino cherries with liquid as opposed to the red food coloring.

Wow, was that yummy... added a handful of fresh cranberries for the color.  Did not have the food coloring but didn't miss it, for the rest followed the recipe as is.   Used 1/4 of the ingredients (without the southern comfort) for the kids' version... SUPER... BUT DANGEROUS ... can't really taste the southern comfort, maybe just what is needed depending on your gathering ;)

This was a nice alternative to the classic oober sugary punches I've had in the past!  Citrusy, fizzy, and a hint of alcohol made it a great hit at my holiday party this year.

SO GOOD. I used caffeine free Sundrop for the lemon-lime soda. Made this at our Christmas party and it was a huge hit... we ran out quickly (30 servings for about 20 people) so in retrospect, I would have made two batches. To quote a party attendee... "Oh, this tastes dangerous." You can't even taste the Southern Comfort! Will definitely make this again!

I made this last evening , and it was a real hit. I just used two liters of lemon-lime soda, because that's all I had. Thanks so much for the recipe- I will make this again, for sure.

I made this for my New Year's party and it was a hit!  It was gone in an hour and the guests who didn't have a taste were disappointed.  My only advice is to stock up on extra ingredients for the second batch.  Thanks Kerri!

I don't know who the heck Kerri is, but this punch is great!  I served it at my daughter's 1st birthday party (for the adults) and it was gone!  All the women loved it.  Make sure to label it as alcoholic though b/c it doesn't really taste like it is, but it will get you if you drink too much!

A little too sugary for us.  The sweetness overpowered the punch and you couldn't taste the alcohol at all.  Plus the concentrate juices kept settling on the bottom, which didn't make this too appetizing to look at.  I had a couple of glasses, but most guests only had one then preferred beer or wine.

I served this at a Thanksgiving buffet. I had the Southern Comfort on the side so everyone of every age could have some punch.  It was very well liked by everyone, and is especially good with the Southern Comfort.  A very nice, refreshing punch!

This punch is fabulous! I made it at my birthday party last year and I plan on doing so again for my birthday in a few weeks. I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the orange slices and added cherries/cherry juice from the jar. This was much better tasting that I expected, and it was surprisingly, secretly pretty strong. I made two batches and they were both gone in less than 2 hours. Yum!

Really good!  My husband and I brought this along with Champagne Punch III, also from this website to a potluck.  We both loved and prefer this one and several people agreed, but Champagne Punch III did run out faster.  I followed other suggestions and used pink lemonade.  With everything mixed together, it comes out a pretty sunset color.

This punch is great!  I was not able to add 3 liters of lemon-lime soda.  I poured approximately 2 1/3 in and my bowl was full.  It was wonderful without the rest.  I did not add the red food coloring, but did everything else according to directions.  This recipe serves 4 adults.  Everyone agreed that you could not tell it had So. Co. in it.

Before I made this recipe I looked at most of the reviews, and a lot of them said that this recipes was excellent. I made it for this years Super bowl party, and not many people like it, and I followed all the directions. I also tried it and I thought it was alright but I wouldn't make it again.

The best punch, hands down.  I have served this at two parties now without a drop left over.  It is a great compliment to the Champagne Peach Punch found on this site as well because you cover both bases - liquor and wine.

Had a great kick to it. Everyone enjoyed at the get together loved this drink. This was gone before the nonalcoholic beverage. We could not find SoCo at the last minute so we used Black Velvet. Will make again for future events.

Although I bought all the ingredients for this punch, the lemonade and orange juice concentrate were accidentally left in my boyfriend's freezer. I used cranberry splash lemon lime sierra mist and added 3/4 container rainbow sherbet as suggested by my sister. I didn't throw in the sliced orange/lemon or the cherries. It was very tasty! You couldn't really detect the alcohol, and everyone liked it a lot. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly, but it still came out delicious the way we altered it. Thanks!

I made this for a holiday Christmas Party and I was surprised how well-received this was. Knowing that most of the guests were beer & wine drinkers, I didn't anticipate them choosing the punch. However, it went very quickly and I got many compliments. The ingredients are easy to find and its easy to make!

Made this over Christmas, I liked it ok, the better half loves it!  I then added 1/4 cup Bacardi cream of coconut and now I love it. With the added coconut milk it has a tropical, creamy taste that I prefer.

This recipe was a hit!!  I made it when I met my new in-laws from Columbia.  Mixing cultures is hard, but we all had a great time.  Great punch for all countries.

I made this for a holiday gathering of 30 family members, it was a hit with the old timers, middle timers and the 20something crowd. It is sure to be a new family tradition.

This punch packs a punch! No pun intended. It is SOOOOOO yummy! My friends and I were so impressed. Be careful, you hardly taste any alcohol. I added sliced oranges, lemons, and cherries. So pretty!

This punch is absolutely wonderful!! We followed the recipe exactly and invited friends over Christmas afternoon. It was such a hit. We even played with different food colors and added some to make the punch  "green" for Christmas. Didn't change the taste, of course, and made for fun while celebrating!!

I made this punch for a neighborhood Christmas party.  I also had a varied selection of many other drinks.  Everyone just drink the punch.  It was very good.  You do not even taste the Southern Comfort.

Good punch recipe.  I modified it a bit though...I doubled the juices but didn't double the Southern Comfort.  Also, I used only 4 liters of Sprite soda instead of 6 (6 liters would not have fit in the punch bowl.  Plus it would have diluted the taste).  Instead of red food coloring, I used a little grenadine syrup for color.  

You couldn't really taste the Southern Comfort too strongly, but it "snuck up" on you.  It was well received by the all-female crowd.

Excellent!  used the 100 proof Southern Comfort, regular 7-Up and cherry 7-Up for color.  The day before my gathering, I took regular OJ from a carton and froze it in little plastic containers with cherries.  Kept it cold and pretty. Glad someone posted that idea. I will definitely make this again when I need a punch recipe.  This would be a hit for a wedding, baby shower,  or retirement party punch.

I made this based on reviews. It was as everyone said - perfect, everyone loved it and I have passed the recipe along. I followed suggestions using pink lemonade and cranberry lemon-lime soda (3L). I froze the sliced lemons and oranges on a cookie sheet, and added frozen cranberries. I served ice on the side so it would not water the punch down. Made enough for 2 batches, and luckily I did not have as many people as I thought or would have run out. Will be sure to have enough for more next time. It goes down nice and smooth, not too sweet like some other punches. Perfect punch for all occassions, this will be my go-to punch from now on.

This punch is excellent!  I prepared many yummy dishes for my Thanksgiving Day meal, but this might have been the most popular.  It received raves from everyone who tried it and I'm already being asked to make it again for Christmas!  Wonderful taste and not too strong!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Kerri MacDonald!  This is a true keeper, for me!

This punch recipe was amazing! I didn't thaw the frozen juices all the way which made keeping it cold easy. Very citrusy and I think perfect on sweetness. It was the crowd favorite and they all wanted the recipe :)! Thank you for the hit!

Was a big hit at the party and was all finished fairly quickly. I used 2L of lemon-lime soda and 500 cc of blood orange soda. Used ~ 4 ounces of freshly-squeezed lemon juice. Otherwise everything else was the same. It had a great appearance with the sliced orange and lemon and I added cherries for the appearance. Did not use food coloring, but the blood orange soda made it less yellow than it would have been.

Way too orange-y.   I only made a half-recipe based on the guest count, dividing the recipe exactly in half.  While I loved the carbonation from the lemon-lime juice, the orange juice flavor was way too overpowering.  If I were to make this again, I would simply add a hint of regular orange juice (rather than the concentrate) with the carbonated cola and alcohol.

Great punch.  A hit with everyone who tries it.  Simple to make non alcoholic as well.  Simply make without the Southern Comfort and it is good for kids.

Omg thank you Kerri! Other reviewers weren’t kidding when they said what a crowd pleaser this is! Used cherry 7up and it came out great. It goes fast so if there’s more than 10 people double it!

We have been hosting an annual Christmas party since 2010. I served Kerri’s punch that first year and every year after because my guests request it. I warn everyone that it does contain alcohol because it doesn’t taste like it.

I accidentally bought a bottle of Southern Comfort that was half the size of what was recommended.  The punch was still excellent!  I used frozen lemon, lime and orange slices to hold the cold and it went over well!

Delicious! I made it for a "Friendsgiving" and my friends all raved about how good it was. 
I made a couple of changes. Based on other reviews I doubled the recipe, though I didn't really need to. I used pink lemonade instead of food coloring, and I added some pineapple juice as well.

Delicious...did not add the southern comfort as the kids were enjoying it to much, but adults were able to add it to their individual drink.  Will do again and again!

This is fantastic! I make it every year for our Xmas party. Easy and delicious! The only change I make is adding pink lemonade instead of regular lemonade. I don't usually add the fruit either, but sometimes I put in maraschino cherries. Thanks for the share - this is great!

Easy & yummy!  I made this a couple of weeks ago for a holiday party.  It was the first time I tried it, and it was a hit!  The punch is very refreshing.  Being short on time, I used bottled (Italian) lemon juice, skipped the fresh fruit slices, and took users'  advice by using frozen pink lemonade without extra food coloring.  I had planned to make a full recipe & split before adding alcohol to one half, but I ended up just setting the Southern Comfort next to the punch bowl!  (It worked --- the bottle was half gone at the end.)  This is my new go-to punch.  (I think the lemon juice is the secret ingredient that sets it apart?)

I made this for a holiday party. I followed other suggestions and used cranberry Sierra Mist to avoid adding the drops of red food coloring. I only had half the amount of lemon juice needed to used lime juice for the remaining portion. I only had oranges so didn't use lemon slices. I froze the orange slices and maraschino cherries ahead of time to help keep the drink cold. I also doubled this recipe and put it in a punch dispenser with a spigot for a party of about 25 people. I served next to an ice bucket in case anyone wanted to add ice, although hardly anyone did. My guests LOVED this punch!!! 
For other beverages, I had followed a Pinterest party planning info-graphic that recommended 9 bottles of wine,  2 cases of beer and 4 bottles of spirits for a party of 20. So I had all these drink alternatives, however the punch was the hit of the party! All the other beverages were barely touched! Keep that in mind when throwing a party. This drink recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper and will be a go-to for me for every party, regardless of time of year.

This is seriously one of my favorite punches. I make it for get-togethers all the time! You can easily substitute any lemon/lime soda, taste great either way.

I have been making this for years and it is always a hit!  Not sure if anyone has said this before, but I add a jar of maraschino cherries and the juice it comes in.  It really makes it taste awesome!

This was very good.  Not too sweet, couldn't taste the alcohol.  I didn't use the cherries or red food color.  Thanks to other's suggestions, I did freeze my lemon and orange slices in the morning.  My bunco friends really enjoyed it too!

All the reviewers were correct! So good! I took someone's advice and left out the food coloring and replaced the lemonade for pink lemonade. I also used a 2liter of 7-up and 1 liter of Diet Cranberry Sierra Mist. Any combo of those would be killer!??

We've made this for Thanksgiving the past two years and it was a huge success. I don't know why I don't make it more often... Made it with all the listed ingredients except for the food coloring. Delicious!

I made this punch for my Christmas party last night (all women)and everyone loved it.  I only used 1/2 the bottle of Southern Comfort as I didn't want too much of the alchohol taste.  Also, everyone had to drive home. I might increase it next time. There wasn't very much left over.

I've been making this punch since the late 1970s and has ALWAYS been a hit. I've made it with the cherries, canned fruit, and the fruit round, and I prefer pink lemonade for color. But, be prepaired to make more than one bowl! I usually end up making at least three bowls...they always ask for more! But take care, because it's sweet, and people don't realize that it really packs a whollop!
