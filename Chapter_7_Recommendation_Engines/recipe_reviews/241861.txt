These were a nice twist to two familiar favorites. I made two changes to the recipe: I added 1/2 bag of mini chocolate chips to the cookie dough (it just felt right) and I added an egg to the brownie mix because when I mixed it as written it was way too dry and wouldn't blend. I used my large ice cream scoop to make large cookies and as such needed to increase the bake time to about 15 minutes. THANKS for the recipe!

Tho the concept was a nice thought, these did not make the cut for me. The cookies spread out pretty flat and then once cooled were more crunchy like. After making 3 pans I decided to spray cupcake liners and put the batter in those. Slightly better but still not great. Taste was decent, definitely better in the cupcake liners. Will keep looking.

I loved the idea of this recipe and the final product was very loved by all who tried them however I had to subtract a star because the brownie mix was way too dry as written. It was just powder with a couple wet spots on it; I wonder if there is a typo in the recipe? We added 2 more tablespoons of oil and 2 more tablespoons of water to get it to a batter consistency. I really recommend these cookies just make sure you add more liquid to the brownie mixture!:)
