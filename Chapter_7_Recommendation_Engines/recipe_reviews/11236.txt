This cookie bar was great. Instead of mixing the coconut with the butter eggs and crackers I sprinkled it on top of the mixture so that it was evenly mixed throughout the bar otherwise it tends to get clumpy.

great mix of flavors...I didn't follow the recipe well..and it came out great! I mixed all the dry ingredients into the liquid (choc. chips too) but I left out the marshmallows which I put on top with left over crumbled graham crackers. Then I baked the whole thing for about 15 min at 350.

I used Oats instead of Graham Crackers. Worked great. Make sure you simmer for at least 2 minutes. Add marshmellows then it should be cool enought to add oats (5 minutes after removing from heat). Tasted Great.

It was okay--just needs a little oomph...like another layer of something firm/crunchy.

This was yummy! It’s so easy to make, and the church crowd loved it! I’ll make these again. I do think that I will double it next time, too.
