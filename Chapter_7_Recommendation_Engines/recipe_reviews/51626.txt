I'm bummed out about this bread because it looked BEAUTIFUL out of the oven! However, it's pretty dry. Maybe it would be great if you add a container of lemon yogurt. It's actually pretty good if you heat it up, but I'll just try another recipe. I couldn't see heating up the stove for 1 T. sugar & 1 T. lemon juice either.....

I thought this was excellent.  I always have to modify everything, and so I put approximately 1/4 cup of lemon juice in instead of just 3 tablespoons.  because I love lemon.  I didn't heat up the glaze; just whisked the sugar into the lemon juice and poured over the top of the bread.  It is somewhat crumbly but delicious!
