We thought this was good but needed just a little more seasoning for our taste - I would add salt and pepper to the meat while cooking, and a handful of cheddar cheese to the potatoes once mashed (or sprinkle some cheese over the top of the potatoes before baking) - yumm!! Great recipe that is easy to adjust to your personal tastes and preferences; we added some peas to our veggie mix. :)

This was pretty good but does need some seasoning added both to the meat.  I will also make a cheesy mashed potato with garlic topping if I make it again to give it a little more flavor.  This serves way more than 4 people.

Excellent easy recipe with a twist. Loved the sauce ingredient. I always change recipes to suit me so this one gets 5 stars even though I added: the meat from one hot Italian sausage, one garlic clove, one half Tbs of onion soup mix and a few pieces of sweet pepper - added them with the carrots. I used new potatoes and left the skins on. We loved this pie! Thanks.

This simple recipe can use just a little boost by seasoning the meat with thyme and rosemary. I also add peas as you would find in a traditional shepherds pie.

It turned out great!  the wife loved it.  I just seasoned the meat with minced garlic, salt and pepper, and I added about 1/4 cup asiago cheese and 2 TBSP of parmesan to the mashed potatoes. Delish! I would suggest boiling the carrots separate from the potatoes.  The extra pan to wash is better than having to separate the carrots from the soft potatoes, in my opinion. =)

My SO loathes onions, so cut the onions.  Added about a cup or two of peas (next time, will add more).

I actually cooked everything the night before (SO works different schedule) and placed in fridge.  Didn't throw in oven until the next evening.  It didn't heat thoroughly (SO did it on her own), but that's more an issue of SO being less-than-culinary-inclined than the recipe.

Only issue with recipe overall, potatoes came out kinda bland.  Meat was great (a little greasy for me, but SO loved it), trying to separate the carrots/potatoes were a pain, and yeah, potato was a little bland.  Next time will add some extra seasoning or something to it.
