I also make this recipe, only I use cottage cheese instead of ricotta. This is a favorite of my two kids, they love to eat spoonfuls of this between two pieces of garlic bread. This is a great cheap meal to make that bends and stretches well to use what you have on hand and also to feed the family more than one day.

We thought this was good. I had to add some garlic salt to the meat for flavor.  The ricotta was hard to spread evenly. I think next time I will mix the egg, parm, and ricotta with the noodles and then spread in the pan. For the reviewer who didn't like the pasta sticking together- Remember the spaghetti is supposed to be stuck together- hence the name,  pie.

this is an old family favorite...I make it with a bit more seasoning, and addition of sausage and a layer veggies.

I followed the recipe as written.  This was good, although the spaghetti was all suck together when I was trying to serve it up on the plates.  I did add a little oil when i cooked the pasta to prevent the stickiness.  The ricotta cheese was not melted enough for me, so I will bake it for a little longer next time.  The problem may have been I made it earlier in the day and put it in the frig for a couple of hours before baking it.  I also though it was alot of extra work for a pasta dinner.  I am not sure if I will make again, but it was enjoyed by the family.

I make this with bulk Italian Sausage, instead of hamburger, for more flavor. I also sautee green pepper and onions while cooking the sausage,  and use four or five eggs. The noodle base is supposed to be firm like a pie. (Someone said the noodles stuck together) I make a large batch, in two glass pie plates, because my husband and I LOVE leftovers.

This was simple to throw together, but the flavor was only okay. I definitely thought it could have used more seasoning to kick it up a notch. It was too bland for my taste. My toddler enjoyed it, though.
