I wasn't able to work anywhere near the listed amount of flour into this dough, so I think my loaves were smaller than they should have been. I used 1/2 lb of mild cheddar instead of American cheese and garlic butter as my shortening. Tastes great! The cornmeal mixture boils rapidly and spits, so be careful!

I just made this bread.  I was curious to see how the molasses would turn out and affect the flavor.  It was great.  It came out with a FANTASTIC crunchy/chewy crust like you usually only find in artisan bread or with a steam machine.  I used shredded cheddar jack cheese instead of processed cheese, and just kneaded it in.  Make sure to let the dough rest after adding the whole wheat flour.  (Whole wheat flour absorbs more water more slowly, so if you don't let it rest, you knead too much white flour in and it turns out dry.)  I also added two teaspoons of minced garlic into the cornmeal mix.  Fantastic.

I did not care for this recipe.  I made this for Christmas eve dinner and was very diappointed.  The molasses in the bread tasted awful.  I would recommend making the bread without the sweet molasses

Bread was excellent and easy to make.  Lots of cheese throughout and the molasses gave it a good flavor.

I think this is going to be great, it's in the oven now, through I made a couple of substitutions =). I added rosemary, black pepper, and a hint of turmeric. I subbed cojack cubes for american, used olive oil for my fat, added whole wheat flour with a little cracked wheat instead of corn meal, and I also used sucanat instead of molasses. My additions were also unmeasured, but other than that I think we have the same bread =), and it's going to be great! =)

This is a wonderful recipe, reminiscent of the Chunk o' Cheese Bread my mother used to make. I cut the amount of cheese back to about half and used sharp cheddar instead of American. I use a Kitchenaid mixer and the dough for this recipe  never forms a tight ball. It remains tacky and sticks to the sides of the bowl. Once removed/srcaped from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface however, it can be worked int a nice ball from which to form the loaves. Ate three slices so far and the loaves have not cooled completely.

Good way to use up extra American cheese. I didn't have molasses, so I used a combo of pure maple syrup and honey. Turned out very good. Looking forward to dipping it in tomato soup.
