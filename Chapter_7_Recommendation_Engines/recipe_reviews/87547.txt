This is a good, easy dish to prepare that everyone likes.  I make it even easier by using my crock pot to heat it.  Adding 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke is a good variation and makes it more interesting, also

Very popular at a large cook-out we host every summer.  I triple the recipe with ease, and we always run out...

Very delicious.  Got rave reviews when I made this for a large group.  I put all ingredients in the crock pot on low for several hours after browning the meat, onion, and bacon on the stove.  YUMMY!!!!!  Wouldn't change a thing.

I make this a lot when my family goes to our ranch for the weekend. Men love this! I have two variations--I use lima beans instead of northern beans and I skip the molasses. One morning we had a few leftovers and mixed the bean dish with scrambled eggs--it was delicious!!!

Easy to prepare.  I used honey and maple syrup since there was no brown sugar in the house.  They came out great!  Don't forget to cover the dish before baking.

This is a great recipe, and my hubby LOVES it. I would leave out the bacon, though, as it didn't really add anything. The only complaint I might have is that the beans are kind of dry.

These were good, but to us they needed a little something added to the flavor. They are good heated the next day or in a sandwich too. thanks.

it was okay. I wasn't sure whether to drain the beans or not.

Super yummy! My husband and I loved them, finished the leftovers off the very next day. I didn't have any molasses, so I subbed an equal amount of honey. I also was missing dried mustard powder, so I decided to try another reviewer's suggestion to add about 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke. My oven was occupied by biscuits and meatloaf, so after the stovetop prep I poured them in my crockpot for about 90 minutes on high, another 90 or so minutes on low while rest of the meal cooked. Just a little before serving, I tasted and the sauce was tasty, but a little sweet for our tastes - this almost definitely would NOT have been the case if I had used mustard powder as listed. But, I stirred in a few shakes of Worcester sauce and it was a perfect compliment to give that little missing salty layer of flavor. This will be my go-to bean recipe, really simple and used almost all ingredients I had on hand. Thanks for sharing!

SO EASY! Browned the ground beef and onions on the stovetop (I did not have bacon), then transferred them to the crockpot. Dumped drained beans into the crockpot, one by one (I also added pinto beans, just because I LOVE them). Then I mixed the 'sauce' ingredients together in a glass measuring cup, stirred and added to the crockpot. It was a tad 'dry' (likely from adding the extra can of beans) SO I added 1/2 cup of hot water . PERFECT!! Let them cook on High for an hour and then turned it down to Low for another hour. I used a regular sized Crockpot and it was FULL to the brim.  Everyone (read: KIDS) loved this dish. Follow the recipe seasonings and you won't be disappointed.

These beans were so good. I made them for my coworkers, and everyone loved them. I did not add the molasses because I used a can maple syrup baked beans.

It's a good recipe if you use a crock pot and slow cook it for several hours. Otherwise if you bake it in the oven, it can dry out.
