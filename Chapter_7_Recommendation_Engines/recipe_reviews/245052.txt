This is a terrific recipe. Even the five year old liked it. My wife said, "home made fish and chips"!

A couple of changes: I cooked it 2 minutes per side, not 5.  Sole cooks very quickly! Also, I used a mixture of butter and oil, not just oil, for the flavor.

DIdnt have saltines so I used Ritz crackers. I added 1/4 cup fresh Parmesan , fresh parsley  and 1 tbsp dried dill & 1 tsp garlic salt. Dredged the sole in  Wonder Baking flour  ( out of regular) and the finely sifted flour stuck to the egg perfectly. All purpose flour always clumps unevenly for me. Dipped back in the  egg and then the crumb  mixture then immediately into the preheated olive oil & butter.  My nonstick skillet was well coated with olive oil & I added  a generous pat of butter for more flavor. Fried till crispy on the bottom and then flipped. I didn't time it but it probably took each side 3 minutes. To get nicely browned. Was delicious and looked great plated.

Thank you for this new Dover recipe for me!  Gave me a great base. I used egg substitute. I added dill, garlic, dried parsley to the flour and flax seed meal mixture. (Just about 2 tbsp of flax seed meal). I used avocado oil to fry the fish after sprinkling salt and pepper.  It was delicious and I'll be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and was really disappointed in the result! Two tablespoons of oil for a pound of sole wasn't enough. Using a cat iron skillet, med-high heat caused the coating to burn immediately

Instead of egg I dredged them in silk creamy cashew milk. I used gluten free bread crumbs instead of salted crackers. I used pure virgin Olive Oil to fry. Served with Rice and Shiitake mushrooms sautéed in Olive Oil with 2 cloves of garlic when almost completely sautéed. It was freaking yum !

I have never seen Dover Sole in my grocery stores so I used Tilapia instead. First let me say that I am not a fan of the double coating but it really worked nicely in this recipe. I probably used more saltines than the recipe called for because the coating  ended up much thicker than I had anticipated.  It stuck perfectly though and also browned up so much nicer than bread crumbs. I can promise you that you will need much more oil for frying than the recipe calls for. My Tilapia required quite a bit more because it is not near as flat as Dover Sole but even 2 tablespoons isn't nearly enough to fry a pound of fish in.  Loved the dill in here even though it accidentally went in with my saltine crackers and my only suggestion is that  you give it a good squeeze of lemon after you take it out of the skillet.

I used both butter and olive oil in the skillet.  Instead of ground crackers, I used plain panko crumbs and added seasonings. Next time I'll try seasoned panko crumbs.  Really loved the crispiness of the outside.

Five stars for anything my kids will eat, and they devoured this! I added a pinch of dried parsley and a pinch of onion powder to the cracker crumbs just to give it a little more flavor than just the saltines.

Good recipe. I followed the  suggestions from others and used panko crumbs. I didn't have enough so I added some regular bread crumbs. For flavor I used some parsley, garlic and onion powder and a little salt. I also fried the fish in a mixture of  butter and oil. Very yummy!

It was delicious.  Tender inside and slightly crispy outside.  Even my finicky non-fish eater liked it.
