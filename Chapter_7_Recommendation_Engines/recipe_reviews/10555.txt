HELPFUL TIPS THAT HELPED ME: If you're like me, you'll probably be thinking "this is way too sweet" while you put all those chocolate chips on top of the crust & YOU'LL BE RIGHT! LOL  I think 1/2 cup of one or a little less than 1/2C of each is perfect!!  If you do chocolate chips only, try using a mixture of semi-sweet and milk chocolate.  It's an amazing blend that I always get comments on!!!  Second, mine turns out perfect using just a 14oz (1 cup) can of fat-free sweetened condensed milk.  Thought that may help someone when trying to decide what can to buy w/o pre-measuring.  I just drizzled all over, and it covered it perfectly!  Lastly, when I don't have a box of graham cracker crumbs, I just use quick oats, and it still turns out good!  I like to individually wrap these in plastic wrap so the kids can just grab and go.  I'd say "grab and share" but they'd prefer eating the whole thing themselves!

These are always the first to go during the holiday period.  I usually increase the graham cracker crust so the bar has a more solid base and the chocolate and butterscotch chips to 1 cup vs 3/4 cup.  Wonderful recipe!

This recipe is NOT the original.  You must mix the butter and crumbs together, then press into the bottom of the pan (which you definitely should grease before doing this!).  

Also, put in the chocolate, then nuts, then coconut, and finally drizzle with the milk.  Otherwise, the bars fall apart because there's no "glue" to hold it together.

My husband loves this one ... and so do I!!  One hint - try putting the can of condensed milk in hot water for 5 minutes before pouring over the coconut, etc - it pours so easily and evenly over the rest of the bar.  This may not be new to others, but I just thought of it today.  Enjoy!

Although I prefer to leave the nuts off, this is the best version of this recipe.  The milk MUST be on top of it all, make for a chewy, more gooey type bar.  I've tried it with the milk over the crust first and it just wasn't nearly as good (disappointed).  Yummy!

I find it amazing that something so easy to prepare can be so delicious!  I don't like butterscotch, so I used peanut butter chips instead.  These cookies are really rich so the recipe goes a long way!  My family's rating- a definite keeper!

The coconut wasn't browning, so I baked the bars for 25 minutes and then stuck them under the broiler at low for 1-2 minutes. Broiling did just the trick- it gave the coconut a great golden color, just don't over-do it in the broiler because it can get too brown really quickly.

Quick and simple! You get great big results for just a little bit of work. We don't care for butterscotch, so I used cappucino chips and added 1/4t of cinnamon to the sw.cond. milk. I think the cinnamon enhances the chocolate/coffee flavor of the chips.Thanks for a great start,Shawn.

Very rich! I found the bottom to be a bit greasy. Next time will increase the amount of graham cracker crumbs by a 1/2 cup or so. Cut these small, they are so sweet they make your teeth ache!

I love this recipe because it is endlessly versatile. I made a variation tonight using an 8x8 pan with just a graham cracker crust (mixed together first then pressed into the pan to combat the crumbliness), Ghirardelli chocolate chips, pecan pieces and coconut with the sweet milk to bind it together. Delicious! For those with issues getting them out of the pan, use 2 strips of parchment paper in a cross pattern with the ends extending just beyond the edge of the pan. Then you can lift the bars out using the paper ends as handles. I cut mine on a cutting board to avoid marring my pan.

I made about 1-1/2 times the recipe & used 2 cans of condensed milk, put it in a 9X13 pan. I refrigerated overnight, cut into a dozen bars, & took to my daughter's office the next day. Her boss said they were d***ed good!

I wanted to make these for my kids, but my oldest is severely nut-allergic.  I solved the problem by crushing pretzels to use in place of the nuts.  The salty-crunchy of the pretzels were a nice substitute- didn't miss the nuts a bit!!!

I really loved this recipe.  It is very rich so I could only serve small pieces.  It lasted almost two weeks in my house and it was as good two weeks old as right out of the oven!

Tip: I started spraying the inside walls (not the bottom) of a glass cake pan with Pam before I spread the graham cracker crumbs on the bottom.  It keeps the sticky candy mixture from sticking to the side when cutting into bars.  These are amazing. :)

Everyone at my party LOVED these!!!! I had to change it a bit. Only used 1/4 cup butter mixed with the crumbs. Used pecans. And used milk chocolate mini chips in place of the butterscotch chips. Cut into one inch squares. YUMMY!

This is very rich but good.  I never rate a recipe unless it is as written.  This is excellent.  I have tweaked and this is always my last baking of the holiday season as I use all of my partial packages of chips and coconut.  This year, I used semi sweet chocolate chips as written and split white chocolate and cherry chips for the remainder.  It was a hit.  Cut small bars as these are rich and a little go's a long way! I used a pizza cutter when they were still slightly warm and then finished the cutting after they were chilled.

Oh my GOD these are good. Although the recipe should call for 1 1/4 C of sweetened condensed milk, not 1 1/3. One can is 1 1/4. I didn't add more by opening another can. Otherwise this is AWESSSOOMEE. I had to give them all away so I wouldn't eat them.

Delicious recipe.  I have made the original recipe from the back of the Eagle Brand can and they were perfect but, the pressing of the crust took time so when I saw this recipe which told me just to spinkle the crumbs over the butter I thought, "Neat easy."  Well, it turns out that you loose too much of the gragrham cracker crust in the pan.  It is too loose. Next time I will mix the butter with the crumbs and firmly press into the pan and bake for 10minutes before layering on other ingredients on.  Otherwise taste great just missed the thick graham cracker crust.

I first made these in my 7th grade Home Ec. class in 1974, and we called them 'Hello Dolly's'.  They are great with pecans instead of walnuts, or peanut butter chips w/ salted peanuts.  My Mom made them a family tradition that same year, and I cannot imagine a Christmas cookie collection without them. So yummy! One trick I have figured out over the years is to melt the butter in a saucepan and stir the graham cracker crumbs in the melted butter and then press it down in the baking pan. It keeps the crust from falling apart.

While I haven't made this recipe, I make a similar bar cookie at holiday time (shortbread bottom, chocolate chips melted in sw. condensed milk, chopped walnuts and shortbread crumbles). To make them Christmas like, I sprinkle red and green sugar on top before baking (1 color on each half of the pan). They look so pretty when arranged on a platter with other cookies. I'll bet that would work well with these bars too!

The first time I made these they fell apart. However, I wanted them to work so I tried again using some of the hints provided by other users. Definitely use more graham cracker crumbs (I used 2 cups but I think 3 cups would be better) and added the same ratio of butter. To firm up the base, I baked it alone for about ten minutes. And instead of putting the sweetened condensed milk on the graham cracker mixture, I drizzled it over the top of the chocolate, nut and coconut mixture. Most importantly, I cooled the baked product and then put it in the fridge for about an hour--that really helps to create a solid block. Good luck!

AWESOME!! Only problem was I followed the directions on the eagle brand can instead of this by accident. That recipe calls for 1 cup of butter. My magic bars came out greasy so they are in the fridge in hopes that they firm up. I imagine the 1/2 cup of butter this recipe calls for is perfect! I used 1 package of graham cracker crumbs and put them in my mini food proccesor with the butter. It was easy to make the crust that way! After my bars came out of the oven, I cut them into 4x4 squares because yes, like many other reviews say, these babies are rich and very sweet! Perfect with a glass of ice cold milk. I cant wait to bring these to my cook out tomorrow and share with friends.

I use a whole bag of semi-sweet chips, no butterscotch..I think the butterscotch are a little too sweet.. I also use oreo cookies for the base..I just get regular oreo cookies and crush them in the food processor and use them instead of the graham crackers.. I use about a 1/2 stick of butter, maybe just a little more..I put lots of toppings on..don't really measure anything..make sure the pan is covered with the nuts and coconut..and a whole can of sweetened condensed milk..they are really good...

I already have this recipe from a magazine from 1997.  It is a nice tasting cookie.  Make sure that you mix and pack the graham crackers at the bottom before adding the filling.

This is one of our favorite cookies. However, we substitute the crust from lemon bars for the graham cracker crust. It's a light, flaky, buttery crust that keeps the cookies from being too sweet. You can find the recipe here: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/lemon-square-bars/detail.aspx or just use two sticks of melted butter, two cups of flour, and a cup of confectioner's sugar. Mix this up, press it into the pan and bake for 20-25 minutes before adding the rest of the magic square ingredients.

These taste amazing, but the crust didn't work so well. Instead of pouring your butter/margarin into the pan and then sprinkling the crumbs onto the melted butter, I suggest mixing the two and pressing it into the pan. I did it by the directions and my crust stays on the plate when you pick up the cookie! Kind of funny but not ideal!

No thanks, I couldn't even get the out of the pan.  The flavors are tasty but the execution is... not so good and I followed the recipe to the T so I don't know if it was me, or the recipe. Not worth a re-do.

these were DELICIOUS. I used 1 cup graham cracker crumbs with 1 cup oats and used milk chocolate and cacao chips instead of semisweet and butterscotch but man they were good! Definitely recommend this

Good but VERY rich.  Make sure you use brand name sweetened condensed milk.  Store name just didn't do the trick.

I love these!!  Very very sweet so a small piece will do.  I usually use 2 c. graham cracker crumbs, omit the coconut and increase the choc. & butterscotch chips to 1 c. each.

my only suggestion would be to pour the condensed milk from the center out to the edges of the pan so you are left with a thin pour at the edges and be careful not to get it on the sides of the pan.  i didn't do this the first time and had to chisel the hardened milk to get the bars out.

I made these for a bake sale and they sold out quickly.  I used a couple of the suggestions previously mentioned.  I added a little more graham cracker and mixed it with the butter until it just held together.  I used 1 14 oz. can of condensed milk and cut the chips back to 1/2 a cup each.  I wanted to cut some of the sweetness.  I will make these again.

If you don't have graham cracker crumbs, but have graham cracker. Just melt the butter in the pan, { you only need 1/4 cup of butter} and lay the graham cracker on the bottom. You can also use dried cranberrys to replace the butterscotch chips.

This recipe is quick and easy and turned out to be so delicious! I wish I could get mine to be as pretty as the picture though! I increased the Graham Cracker crumbs to 2cups to give it a more solid base and used 1 14oz can of the sweetened condensed milk (just under 1 1/3cups). Other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out great! I would suggest waiting an hour or so (until it is completely cooled) before cutting it into the squares. I cut half of it after 25 minutes and it was a little messy. After it was completely cooled They came out nice and neat! I'll definitely be making these more often. My family is in love. Thank you!

Huge success! I used only chocolate chips and no butterscotch as a matter of personal taste, but otherwise, there is no need to change a thing. Huge hit at the office. I don't even normally like coconut that much normally, but everything goes together beautifully in this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

These are excellent, and you can make it with any toppings you like.  I'm not a big fan of butterscotch chips, so I use toffee bits instead.  I also throw on a couple of handfuls of dried cranberries or other berries to balance out the sweetness with a little tang.  
For the crust, I've experimented with using refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough, press it down on the bottom of the pan, bake for 11-13 minutes, add the toppings and bake for another 11-13 minutes until done.

I am going to go ahead and give this a 5 star review even though I disagree with the graham cracker crust instructions in the recipe. First of all, you must mix the butter and the graham cracker together in a bowl, then press into your pan before proceeding with recipe. Beyond that, the key to a great graham cracker crust is to use softened butter (or baking margarine), not melted. Try it with your next crust and I think you will be very happy with the results. It makes for a more stable crust and it is much easier to press into the pan or pie plate.

I have made this type of bar at least a dozen times growing up, they were one of my family's favourites.  It had been a while since I made them so I thought it best to consult a recipe just to make sure I got the measurements right.  I folowed this recipe to a T, and the only thing that differed as far as I could tell is the treatment of the graham cracker crumbs and butter.  I thought I had remembered combining them seperately then patting it into the bottom of the dish.  This recipes method seemed simpler (melt the butter, pour into pan, sprinkle graham crackers on top) so I thought I'd try it. BIG MISTAKE! the crust was so dry and didn't hold together at all! Its just a mess. If anyone is attempting to make these, I strongly suggest combining the crust seperately to make sure there's enough butter and it holds together.

I found this recipe not worth using again. Pouring the condensed milk on top rather than on the crust left the crust crumbly and did not stay together.  Also, the amount of condensed milk called for is 1-1/3 cups (11oz) rather than the full 14oz can - a waste.
Disappointed.

I thought these were excellent. It seemed like the crust may have needed to be pressed down because it didn't hold together like it should have. This was my first time to make these and I'm sure I'll do better each time I make it. AND, I will make these again.

A hit every time!  I have made these numerous times over the years, varying my chocolate chips and nuts.  They are always so yummy!  I typically don't quite use the full 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips, but these changes are minimal and based on preference.  I love using almonds or peanuts in mine - not a big walnut fan!  Anyway you slice it, this square disappears right off the Christmas treat platter - pure MAGIC :)

Excellent, easy, and quick.  I made as written, subbing milk chocolate chips for butterscotch due to personal preference, and they turned out fantastically delicious! :D

Awesome!! This recipe is a keeper. I made them exactly as stated...and they came out great! They are very sweet, so cut them small. Also, these are great for christmas cookie exchange because they taste great days later... just kept them in my tupperware container.

I layer mine differently, and use butter for the base with the graham crackers. I just melt the butter right in the pan as the oven warms (be sure to pull it out before it burns), then layer first the coconut, then the chips and finally the nuts (walnuts or last time, pecans). I drizzle the can of sweetened condensed milk over as evenly as possible, and the nuts brown beautifully. I cook it on the longer side, usually 30 minutes and make sure it browns. It is much crisper and chewier at the same time if you do that. The crust stays together better, too. You could also add just a bit more butter if it crumbles too much, or a bit less graham. It seems to be crumblier if I use precrushed graham instead of crushing my own not quite so powdery. My family adores these! I make variations, too, and dried fruit is an easy option. Can be any kind, even mixed. If you have someone visiting who doesn't eat nuts, you can leave them out.

Really easy and really versatile. I used a combo of semi and dark chips (my husband loves coconut but not so sweet), added some nuts and they turned out like an Almond Joy!

I use about  1/2 C chopped red and green glacee cherries on mine and only the chocolate chips for  Chrismas and make this recipe in a 9X13 pan.  It would be easier to tell people to use 1 can of condensed milk as that is about 1 1/3 cups.

These are the perfect version of the classic. I thought they were just too easy the first time I made them, but my pastor said they are his favorite dessert and they were the best ones he'd ever had. They are simply perfect. I tend to add a few more chips (both butterscotch and chocolate) These are in my permanent recipe book!

For a thicker crust, combine 4 cups of graham cracker crumbs and 2 sticks of butter. Mix well, press into pan. That makes a thick, tasty crust and no crumbs. I always put a lot more chips on top too. Great recipe, and so simple to make!

Helpful hints:  Let the butter melt in the pan while you're preheating the oven; go ahead and make (and press) the graham cracker crust to ensure the crust actually "becomes" a crust; don't pour the condensed milk too close to the edges because it forms a really hard crust.  Otherwise, so stinkin' good and easy to cut into small squares for holiday giving.

I make these to sell at the Farmer's Market here in my home town.  They are a hit.  Line your pan with parchment paper to make the bars easy to remove and clean up is a snap.  I mix 1 cup graham crumbs and 1/2 cup of Oreo crumbs for the base and the whole can of condensed milk. They always turn out great!  LOVE THIS VERSION:)

These were amazing!
I followed others advice and used 2 cups of graham crumbs and it turned out well - though I did find it tricky to get the outer pieces out of the pan.
I used a combination of 1/2 Chocolate Chips, 1/2 of Butterscotch Chips, and 1/2 of Peanut Butter Chips!
Turned out great!

This is a very easy recipe to make.  However, I found it to be very sweet.  I also had the problem of the graham cracker crust being too loose.  If I make it again, I will either mix the butter and graham cracker crumbs together, or press the graham cracker crumbs into the melted butter.  I may also try the suggestions of others to cut the sweetness level.  Note:  My husband liked these just the way they were!

Very tasty & easy. It's a great recipe to take to potlucks & picnics. I took the suggestion of mixing the butter w/ the crumbs before putting in the pan, and I melted caramel and drizzled it over the chips and walnuts instead of using butterscotch chips.

I have made these cookies for about 30 years and this recipe has only a few changes to the original.  I always use butter and I add the condensed milk before the coconut.  Doing it this way allows you to lightly press down on the coconut before putting the pan in the oven.  These are always a hit.

A fantastic classic.  FYI: even if you use fat free sweetened condensed milk...you are still getting a boat load of sugar....which turns to fat as you process it anyway...so just enjoy this once in awhile, but DO NOT give them up!  :o)

A crowd pleaser!! I have been making these for years. Instead of graham cracker crumbs for a base, I use left over/stale chocolate chip cookies or brownies. Chop them up in the food processor and spread as base. I increase the base layer to 2 cups.

I made these and they are VERY sweet.. my advice, cut down butterscotch chips to about 1/2 cup, if that.. and using one can of even low fat condensed milk works just well.  Also use about 1 and 2/3 cup of graham crackers, that makes for a thicker crust that wont be flimsy.  I use chopped pecans and only about 1/2-2/3 cup, if you dont want walnuts.  this is very sweet, beware!

You will  not be able to find a more simple and yummy cookie bar than this! Nearly no work at all, and almost impossible to screw up, great for beginners!

Sooooo good!  I've been making these since I found this recipe here a year ago and they have quickly become a family favorite.  I omit the nuts (due to allergies) and double the recipe and bake it all in a 10x18 pan.  They freeze well too!

These were absolutely amazing! I didn't have nuts on hand so I used pretzels instead and they were even better with the saltiness to them! This will be made again!

Love this recipe!  It always turns out and is always a crowd pleaser!  I just use chocolate chips (no butterscotch) and butter iso margarine.  It can almost be a one-pot recipe if you use weight iso volume (translate recipe to metric and use a scale...so much easier!).

I thought these Magic Bars were very good, although I think the recipe called for a little too much butter in the crust.  When held, the bars were really greasy on the bottom.

Very tasty but, really greasy. I think there needs to be more graham cracker crumbs to soak up all that margarine. Also, these were a little thin. I think I'll make these next time using a 8x8 pan for a more substantial bar. These were soggy and flimsy but, still tasted good :-)

I make these often for my dad. He LOVES chocolate so I frequently substitute the graham cracker crust/bottowm later for an oreo crust/bottom. I have also used peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch to take away some of the sweetness when I use the oreos. I have also tried pecans and/or peanuts instead of walnuts. I like this recipe because you can mix and match ingredients and it always turns out great! It is fast and very easy to make.

Oh my gosh...these truly are the best bars! I didn't have butterscoth chips and so I substituted peanutbutter chips and it still turned out great. What a simple recipe with excellent results! I even added everything, but the sc milk and then drove to a different location. By the time I got there everything had pushed to one side. I just shook it to get everything even again and poured the sc milk over the top. It still turned out perfect.

I just baked these - almost as instructed, with a few more graham crackers as some suggested - and they smell terrific. We'll see how they go over tonight! Update: I must have done something wrong because they didn't stick together. *sigh*

The only change I made was to substitute mint chocolate chips on 1/2 of the pan.

This is a no-fail recipe and the results are always fantastic! Make sure that you let this dish cool for atleast 7 hours to ensure that you can cut your squares with ease. Also, press all ingredients down firmly into the condensed milk and graham crust mixture so that there aren't too many crumbs created when you cut out your squares.

So good!  I did add more chocolate chips, like a cup full, but I dont think that really "changes" the recipe.  This is so tastY!  I loved it!  I saw how some had issues with the crust, I followed instructions and did not.  I wonder if that is because I crushed the crackers until they were a powder instead of crumbled pieces.

The crust totally crumbled apart.  The crumbs and butter really should be combined together and then evenly spread.  I wish I would have done that.  I would also pour the condensed milk over the crust to help bind it and then finish with the rest of the ingredients.  The taste is delicious but there is no crust, it is all sitting on my plate, not stuck together.

Very tasty!  I used Nilla wafers instead of graham crackers, and pecans instead of walnuts.  Just a tip...I had to let mine cool all the way to room temp before they became "bars".  My first taste while they were still warm I had to eat with a spoon!

I love these.  I used only semisweet chips, no butterscotch.  These bars kind of remind me of Mounds candy bars with the coconut and dark chocolate.

Tweaked it just a bit.....2 cups of graham cracker crumbs, 3/4 cup butter (mixed together, then pressed into the pan), 1 1/4 cups of finely chopped pecans, and 2 cups of coconut....just makes for a fuller, slightly thicker base.  Heat the condensed milk for 5 minutes in a pan of hot water, and once you've poured it over the coconut, let it sit for another 5 minutes to seep down through the mix a little bit.  GREAT cookie bars...made these the first time for an old high school flame who offered me dinner if I could make these for her.  Well worth the effort!  ;-)

LOVED THESE! 
I would mix the graham crackers and margarine to form a better crust.
I used slivered almonds since that is what I had on hand.
I skipped the coconut (I don't care for it) and followed another reviewer's suggestion of using just the 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk.
So good and really really easy!

This is very good but extremely sweet. Sickening sweet. I should have listened to the suggestions from the last reviewer. My co-workers that have a bid sweet tooth enjoyed them a lot! I would make again but lessen the ingredients.

This recipe is better than the Eagle Brand recipe!  My grandmother started making these about 40 years ago and the recipe has been passed down (although we call them, Hello Dolly Bars).  They are easy to make, you can add whatever toppings you like to it,  and it's delicious for any get-together, holiday party, or just because. The only thing we do different is, we put the chocolate chips on top because it looks better and it  browns better with the sweetened  condensed milk on top of the chocolate chips instead of the coconut. Great recipe!

Great, easy recipe. Instead of the semi sweet and butterscotch chips I used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips. Turned out perfect! Freeze well too.

I have been making these for years, and my mom made them when I was growing up. She called them Crazy Cookies. They are so versatile; I've used all kinds of chips...butterscotch, mint, peanut butter and Heath. Always a five-star hit for any occasion.

I made these bars years ago and were such a big hit, they are now one of our traditional Christmas goodies. No need to adjust anything in this recipe and they can easily be doubled. Wonderfully decadent!

These were super easy! They were good, but they could have been better - totally my fault. I think that I baked them for just a tad bit too long.

My only differences were, I used up leftover chips, so PB&choc, butterscotch, and some mini-semi. I also only had almonds but would have loved pecans

I increased the graham crumbs like as suggested in some reviews, yet mine were rather crumbly. I'm not sure if it was the increase in crumbs, or perhaps it would have worked better to cut the margarine into the butter and press into the pan. I also used white choc. chips, not butterscotch. I didn't measure the chips or coconut - just sprinkled on and based it on looks. They tasted fantastic! My only issue was that they did not cut nicely into bars - too crumbly.

WOW!  These smelled amazing coming out of the oven.  OMG!  Like some reviewers I used 1/2 C of chips mixing bittersweet with milk chocolate and then 1/2C butterscotch.

Great recipe.  Great combination of flavours.  My favourite is chocolate chips with pecans and dried cranberries.    Two suggestions to make this recipe better: 1.  I mix the graham wafer crumbs in with the margarine and press it into the pan to keep the crust from crumbling when cut into bars.  2.  Put the pecans on top of the sweetened condensed milk otherwise the nuts get too soggy.

This seems like a simple enough recipe and one that is hard to screw up which is why I'm having a hard time understanding why mine was screwed up!  I followed the recipe as stated and when I took my pan out of the oven all the butter had come up from the bottom and was pooling around the edges and top of the cookie bar.  I used paper towels to soak up all the butter (like you would blot a pizza) and then let them cool.  After that debacle the end result was really quite delicious but the bottom was a little greasy/buttery still for some reason (even after all that butter came to the top).  Not exactly sure what went wrong, but even after the trouble I had I still find myself going back for more because they taste so good!

I just made this recipe using, shortbread cookie crumbs,chopped peanuts,choc chips,butterscotch chips,coconut,and condensed milk. The flavor is good,just not my thing! Its too gooey,and soft for me! I prefer crisp,and firm textured bars/cookies.I know my husband will enjoy since he loves gooey/under baked cookies. :) thanks for recipe!

Thank heavens I found this recipe -- I've always made them with the condensed milk over the crust and I *forgot* to put it on this time...got all the layers on and thought I was going to have to toss the whole pan! But I remembered reading a recipe that did it differently so I searched it out, saw that people actually liked it better this way and tried it.  Salvaged a whole pan of treats and found out that we like these better, too!  :)

I make these with peanut butter chips instead of the butterscotch, and no coconut. VERY sweet, and so easy to make, it is a good cooking project for elementary school age kids.  These are always a big hit, and don't last long at all.

5 stars with some tweaks! I browned the coconut before I put them in the baking dish. It made a huge difference! I also used quick oats and added a little brown sugar to the oats/margarine mixture. Also, I used only semi-sweet chips and only about 1 cup of them, that was plenty. Great recipe though!

have been making this for years!  Also try milk choco chips and peanut butter chips for "magic buckeye bars"  or chocolate graham cracker crust and almonds instead of walnuts, and omit the butterscotch chips altogether for "Almon Joy" Bars".  I have experimented with many combinations!~  Have fun!

I just made this for the first time and it is delicious.  I didn't have graham crackers so I followed a previous reviewer's tip and used quick oats.  I also used low fat sweetened condensed milk.  I made a mistake and used 2 sticks of butter instead of 1 stick of margarine but it was still very good.  I will make again many many times.  It is very rich so, using the oats and the low fat sweetened condensed milk made me feel a little better about it and it was still very very yummy and so so easy to throw together.

When a recipe has 145 reviews and STILL has 5 stars, you have to assume it's pretty darn good.  And you'd be right.  This is delicious and so very easy!  I used peanuts and that's the only change I made.  Excellent!

This didn't turn out well - I followed the recipe to a "t" and the bottom layer was far too mushy and didn't really have much flavor.  Next time I'll follow the advice of a few reviewers and mix the marg. and graham cracker crumbs together to make a crust and press it in the bottom.  I think that'll be good, but this bottom layer wasn't good at all and the choc chips/butterscotch chips never melted...I even put them in the broiler for 2 minutes at the end like someone suggested and they never melted and held their shape.

I have been making these forever and they are fantastic! Sometimes I use just all chocolate chips, sometimes white chips and chocolate chips and sometimes the butterscotch chips and chocolate chips. The possibilities are endless. This is a very good and simple recipe! :)

So easy to make!  I think it took less than 10 minutes from stepping in the kitchen to have it in the oven.  I did add a whole 14 oz can of milk, and about 2 cups coconut.  I mixed the melted butter with the graham crackers before pressing in the pan.  I also added some coconut butter to the crust melted along with the butter.  I had no semi sweet so I used dark chocolate chips.  I lined my pan with foil and sprayed that with nonstick too.  Super easy to clean up that way.  I let them cool about 7 hours before I cut them.  I took them to a family function, first to be eaten!  Excellent reveiws by all who ate them.  It has already been placed in my recipe book.  Next time I make them I will use less butter and more of the coconut butter to get that extra flavor.  I would even make these using oatmeal as others stated if I was out of graham crackers, seems like that would work great.

I made these last night to take to work. They were phenomenal! I would change it just a tad, though. I doubled the recipe so it wanted 2 sticks of butter. Next time, I'll only use 1 1/2 sticks.

Very good and easy to make.  The only thing I do differently is, I like to mix the coconut, chips, and nuts together in a large bowl then put them over the graham cracker crumbs.

I'm not a coconut eater, but this got a 5 Star rating from my husband.  The only thing he didn't like was the the crust wasn't crsip/firm enough.

Tip:  1 cellophaned package of crackers equals 1 1/2 C. The last time I made these were for Christmas cookie baskets I was giving away...none of them made it, we ate them all ourselves!  I used butter instead of marg. and didn't measure the milk, just used the whole can.

I loved this!  So simple, too. I had a few no-nuts, no coconut people in the crowd, so I left those two items off one end of the pan.  I tried both, and they were very good.  My company loved them, too.  Thanks!

This was superfantasic.  I did use the extra half cup of graham crumbs and omitted the nuts and used dried cranberries instead.  They didn't stick too well so next time I am going to push them down a bit.  I let it cool 20 min and tried to cut it with a knife but it was too soft.  I used a bench scraper in an up and down motion to divide it and then placed it in the fridge for a couple hours.  Out of the fridge they are a perfect consistancy.

This recipe is super-quick and easy, and who can't use quick and easy during the holidays? But the best thing is it tastes GREAT! I had lots of compliments. It baked up in a little under the time suggested, and cut up nicely for an appealing presentation.

I made these on request of my father, they are his favorite cookie, he says.  These are so bad for you it's not even funny...but from the little smidgens I had while cutting them, boy are they good.  Pure sugar :).  If you like this kind of thing, this a great recipe.  They got rave reviews from my parents.

I agree w Chef Joy. Great basic recipe,but one 14 oz can of condensed milk is more than enough AND I add it before the toppings. I basically wing it with the chocolate & butterscotch chips, but it definitely is no more than a 1/2 c of each. Also, they are better the next day cuz they settle and the graham crust is more solid.

I've been making these for years! I always mix the graham cracker crumbs in a small bowl , then press it into a greased pan. I change it up every now and then just for a different twist. I use chopped almonds. Sometimes I will replace the butterscotch chips with mint chips or peanut butter chips. Its fantastic no matter which way I make it. Its super easy to make and has become a regular on my list of things to bake at Christmas time.

So good and so easy to make! Perfect dessert to make for a fast, last-minute dessert or for any occasion. I had all of the ingredients except graham crackers, so I took the advice of other reviewers and used quick oats. I actually used 2 packets of instant oatmeal! They were maple-brown sugar flavor and added a great element to the cookie bar. I also used peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch chips. Delicious!

I have loved these whenever I go somewhere that they are available.  First time I've made them myself.  I followed the recipe, reading tips (which helped) and they turned out yummy.  I did mix the butter and graham crumbs together before patting them in my glass baking pan.  No problems with getting them browned on top, baking for 28 minutes.

some of those making reviews need to brush up on their math skills,  eagle brand sweetened condensed milk comes in 14 oz. cans,  14 0z. equals 1 and 3/4 cup.  so you have plenty to make the recipe that calls for 1 and 1/3 cup, no need to use less and no need to open a second can

I saw the recipe tonight and decided to make it.  Used quick oats and softened butter and pressed it down to pan, baked it for 10 minutes and just topped it with butterscotch, choc chips, pretzels, chopped pecan nuts and coconut, then drizzled condensed milk on top. Bake for 20 minutes. Let it cool down for 20 minutes and cut it up..no problem!!  And it turned perfect and super yummy!!!! Will definitely make it again and will proudly share them with friends.  Thanks for an easy and yummy recipe!!!

These are such a delicious desert. I make mine with oatmeal and no butterscotch and if you ask me they are supreme! If you do go this route double the amount called for graham cracker in oatmeal and us half the butter.

I did not have a problem making this recipe... It was great and was exactly what I was asking for. Quick, simple  and very rich. I cut them into small pieces because all you need is a little bit, they are so sweet!  Grease the sides of the pan really good because the candy will stick really good. I will make these bars again.

I couldn't be more pleased with how these turned out. They look just like the photo! They are easy to make and taste so yummy! I used an extra 1/2 cup of graham cracker on the bottom because it looked a little sparse after I used what the recipe called for. They got many positive reviews at the office. I can't wait to make them again.

I've been making this recipe since the 1970s.  It was called 7-Layer Cookie Bars at that time.  It is rich and filling, and always a winner when served.

I make this recipe every Christmas as part of my Christmas cookie gift bag, and it is one of the top two favorites of the package. I think I'd have a riot on my hands if I didn't make them! They are quick and easy. NOM NOM!

These are really yummy and the recipe is great. The one thing i will suggest is that you cut these up into small bite size pieces. A little bite here and there of this goes along way

Great recipe!  The only changes I made were using chopped candied walnuts instead of regular ones and sprinkling powdered sugar over the top instead of coconut.

I didn't care for these.  Way too sweet and the graham cracker crust just doesn't do it for me.  Won't make again.  (I followed recipe exactly except I left out the butterscotch chips since I didn't have any.)

Family liked the butterscotch chips best so next recipes will skip the chocolate.  Made this with the smaller can of condensed milk and it was fine.  Delicious bars.

Wow, these bars are super duper sweet but oh so good. I would cut them into smaller squares to serve because they are a bit rich unless you have a nice tall glass of milk to go with them...

These bars are absolutely to die for. I made a batch just before Christmas to try them. They didn't last long so ended up making another batch for Christmas. Everyone loved them. They are very sweet but Christmas only comes once a year so ENJOY.

I was trying to find a recipe my Aunt used to make when I was a kid and thought this was it.  I was disappointed.  They looked better than they tasted.  My hubby liked em though.  The bottom was too crumbly and the overall taste was too sweet for me.

I had this recipe years ago before children but it was called vacuum cleaner cookies.  Now that the kids 12, 13 and 17 I now know why they were called vacuum cleaner cookies.  They literally disappeared.  Yum!

This reipe with the quick oats as a base is awesome!  I added cashews and raisins, dropped the chocolate and voila!  Crunchy, sweet -- a little goes long way.  Will serve this with other cookies at our Christmas Birthday party for Jesus.

Easy, easy, easy! I didn't have enough graham crackers so I added crushed pretzels to my crushed graham crackers to make the crust. Awesome mix of sweet and salty.

This is an iconic recipe in our family  going through to the fourth generation.  I t started out with crushed corn flakes as the base and evolved to graham crumbs.  The addition of the butterscotch morsels brilliant idea! Great praise for so little effort. If I make no other Christmas cookie these still make me a heroine.

Love These!  We used to call them "Seven Layer Bar" because there are 7 ingredients.  You could change the ingredients a little..but don't they are perfect just the way they are!

I've been making this recipe for over 30 years but my mom called them 7 layer bars.  My recipe calls to mix the butter and crumbs first then spread over bottom of pan.  I also use an entire can of the condensed milk and only 1 cup of coconut.

i made this last night and it turned out really good. my pan was slightly bigger then a 9x13 so i had to add a little more of the ingredients. to offset all the sweetness, i used unsweetened coconut flakes. i'm glad i did because my 2nd batch was much more sweeter than the first since i decided to add a little more milk. i'll be making these for my Xmas eve gathering this week.

I made these with old-fashioned rolled oats as the base as I had no graham crackers.  Worked well.  I also reduced the chips to 1/2 cup each.  They were delicious.

Love these!  They're always a huge hit when I make them, and I myself have trouble not eating them all up.      I've always known them as 7 Layer Bars, but whichever name you prefer, they're GOOD!  I use real butter, but in a recipe like this it doesn't matter, and because of allergies and just a personal preference I use pecans, not walnuts.

I've made other versions of this recipe, where you pour the sweetened condensed milk over the graham cracker crust and then put everything else on top.  This is much, much better!  Pouring the milk on top helps keep everything together, no crumbly mess.  I added a sprinkling of coconut on top and it browned beautifully, got rave reviews at the gathering I took it to.

My fifteen year old son loves to make these.  They are super simple and delicious.  A definite favorite in our household! We sometimes change the graham crackers to crushed oreos (makes it even more decadent) depending on what we have on hand.

I absolutely love these bars! I made them a few weeks ago and forgot to review this recipe. I used chopped pecans and close to a whole can (14 oz) of sweetened condensed milk. I brought these into work the next morning and they disappeared by lunchtime! I already bought the ingredients to make these again this weekend. Fabulous bars! Especially great if you love butterscotch and chocolate together at once!

I made two batches of these so I could use up some ingredients I had on hand.  Also followed some other review suggestions and they turned out perfect: increased crumbs to 2 c. and melted margarine to 1 and 1/4 sticks.  First mixed in bowl, then pressed into pan.  Added chips, then cond. milk and mini marshmalllows (no nuts and family doesn't like coconut).  Second batch, I followed measurements above for crust, but used coconut instead of the marshmallows and added the cond. milk on top.  Cooked for 25-30. Both were successful!!  :)

This was a wonderful treat!  I stayed with chocolate for the chips and mixed milk and semi sweet which seems to be a great combination. Very sweet so cut the bars small.

These are the bomb! I think adding some milk chocolate on top is a MUST! It makes it so decadent. I toasted my coconut a bit before adding it because I'm not a fan of chewy coconut. I also omitted the walnuts because of personal choice, and I didn't have any butterscotch chips, but they were still so good.

had trouble getting the crust to stick together since the milk was poured over the top instead of over the crust.  Had to sub cut-up caramels for the butterscotch chips; it was a tasty sub!

So rich.  I only had about 1/4 c. walnuts.  If I had more I think it would take away some of the sweetness.  Will make again:)

One of my favorites! These taste great hot or cool after they have been stored in the fridge! I like a thicker crust so we use a smalled pan and adjust the coconut, chips, and milk.

This was great. Like others, I made some changes according to what I had. I used semisweet chocolate chips, m&ms because I didn't have milk choco. chips (it added a nice fun color too!), and white choco. chips. I used some kind of cream instead of the condensed milk..I can't remember since I made it a few days ago, but the point is that you can make substitutions. The graham cracker layer was definitely a bit too thin so I would probably double that next time. Otherwise a deliciously, fatty recipe!!:) It tasted even better the next day!

These were over the top good.  My daughter said they really are magic because you don't have to mix anything together and measurements don't have to be exact for the reciepe to work.  You can adjust the amount of chocolate chips you use depending on how sweet you like it.  Personally I think it needs one cup of each type of chip.  Can't wait to play around with this reciepe to get it just to my family's liking, but it's great just like it is.

Wow these are fabulous! I used to occasionally buy one but bought ones were never very good. Finally made them yesterday even though coconut and walnuts aren't my favorite. However, everything goes together so well in these bars that I'll put up with coconut and walnuts! I have made them for Christmas and hope they make it over to my sister's. Had a sample yesterday just to see how they turned out and they are absolutely delicious. Thought of using a smaller pan but glad I didn't. The graham cracker crust is a little thin but bars are quite sweet and rich and if the crust and toppings were too thick they'd be too over the top. Perfect as is. Thankyou so much for this recipe!

I have the same recipe from my mother-in-law.  It's my old quick make desert, because it takes no time to put together.  I tend to only use chocolate chips, and I do use a whole bag, and it turns out wonderful.

Yum! WARNING: Addicting! I made this with a quick oat bottom instead of graham crackers. I was able to stretch the dish to two different dinner parties on following nights, so it kept well. Hard to stay out of, though!

This is very easy to make and delicious.  I followed the recipe as written.  If you use the name brand flaked coconut which is sweetened, they are too sweet.  I used the store brand unsweetened flaked coconut and they were perfect.

Admittedly, I love magic cookie bars, and it would be hard to find one I didn't like.  However, these did fit the bill for me.  I do agree with some others about the crust being a little crumby, though mostly firm by mixing the crumbs and butter together before pressing firmly into the pan, and allowing to cool for at least an hour.  My variations from the recipe include using Mi-del whole wheat graham crackers for a healthier, less sweet crust.  I also added about 1/2 cup old fashioned rolled oats to the 1 1/2 c crumbs after reading other reviews where it was felt that the recipe didn't yield enough crumbs to cover the bottom (you should add more margarine/butter to accomodate the additional crumbs).  I also used Heath toffee bits instead of butterscotch chips (yum!), a combination of pecans and walnuts, and did turn the broiler on for 5 minutes after 25 minutes of cooking to brown the coconut.  My 4 year old daughter didn't like them, but her taste is pretty simple at this point.  My husband kept going back for more and finished off a whole "row" in no time.  Watch out, they are addictive!

Took these to a benefit bake sale at work last week -- they were gone before I even got to try one! I heard they were great though...

I did pre-mix the butter and crackers and pressed them into the bottom of the pan so it would cut better, and also added the whole can of Eagle Brand. Also followed another reviewer by doing a few minutes under the broiler after the 25 min. baking time, just to brown up the coconut.

Great things about this recipe is how versatile it is and how EASY!

These are amazingly delicious, even better than my grandma's magic cookie bar recipe. The condensed milk takes them over the top. When I make these, my boyfriend tries to eat them all in one day.

Scrumptious!! WOW! I know these are not something you eat everyday...But when you want a sweet treat, these fit the bill for many cravings! Chocolate, coconut, graham crakers, etc.! I did use PEANUT BUTTER CHIPS instead of butterscotch. Fantastic! I also followed another reviewer's tips to add the butter to the graham crackers, mix well, then press into the pan. Keeps the crust together more! And for a 9 x 13" pan you will need the whole can of sw. condensed milk. They are AWESOME! thanks!

I made some and took them in to work and they were gone in a matter of minutes. I followed the suggestions of a couple other readers. I wanted a little more crust, so I mixed 3 cups of cinnamon graham crackers and 1 cup of melted, unsalted butter and pressed in the pan. I poured half the condensed milk on top of the mixture and then the other ingredients and topped off with the rest of the milk and they were so soft and chewy! I will definitely try this again but without so much coconut and maybe some butterscotch chips..definitely a keeper!

Reminds me of my childhood.  I used peanuts because that's all I had for nuts. The saltiness of the peanuts works well with the sweetness of the other ingredients. Really needs to be completely cooled before cutting.  I had a hard time getting them out of the pan.

I ended up with a soggy crust. Not sure what i did wrong. It was very thin as well. I recommend a smaller baking dish.
Its VERY sweet.. i think its a little to sweet for my taste.

Great recipe and thanks for the tip about adding the milk on top! I improvised a little. Didn't have graham crackers, so I used animal crackers. Also drizzled a lite layer of butterscotch caramel on top of the crust, then added nuts, choc. chips then finally the milk. No more than 25 minutes should do it! They're wonderful and heated up on top of ice cream is even better!

Very easy and good.  Next time I will add another cup of graham crackers or maybe use some pretzels.  It would be easier to cut and eat if the crust were thicker.  I also substituted peanut butter chips for the butterscotch...yumm!

Just the kind of recipe we were looking for...indulgent, mind-numbingly sweet and a great combination of flavors!  Super easy (no flour, eggs, or sugar needed) -  Just pile on ingredients and bake. Thanks for a great cookie, Shawn.

My husband doesn't normally like cookies and he LOVED these!  I made them for his lunches and he came home raving about how wonderful they were.  I didn't have the full amount of graham crackers, so I used crushed pretzels to get the full amount of crumbs.  This worked great.  They are a bit too sweet for me, but I will definitely make these again.

I remember this recipe from my childhood.  I am glad to have found it to make it with my children.  I may have over-baked it slightly (25 min) because the edges were quite hard.  Overall, the bars were enjoyed by all.

These are great, but I tried making them with a substitution suggested by my sister, Sheryl, and they were absolute perfection! My husband called them "Burnt Squares" because of their appearance, but nobody could dispute the amazing taste! Just replace the Graham crumbs with an equal amount of Oreo crumbs mixed with 1/4 cup of white sugar. Delicious!

I have made these countless times and everyone always gobbles them up.  I usually hand out at Christmas as a little something when meeting up with friends.   As soon as they see a little box or bag of something the first reaction is I was hoping you were bringing those!  If they didn't dive in by  the end of lunch, dinner or drinks I wouldn't believe they meant it.  

The recipe is great as is, but I have modified it over the years so if these changes help others great.  If not, you can not go wrong the way it is.

I add a  teaspoon or so of  cinnamon to the graham cracker crumbs. I up that to 1 3/4 -2 cups as well, so a little more butter is needed.    I melt the butter and stir into the crumbs, and then press it evenly and firmly into the buttered glass pan with a flat bottomed glass.

I premix the chips, coconut and walnuts.  I also add 1 cup of peanut butter chips to the mix.

I then press that evenly on top of the graham crackers, and finally top with the condensed milk.  Pouring the milk on last helps hold it all together.  I usually try and cut into fairly small pieces as it is pretty rich.  I let cool rover night or chill in the fridge if i need to cut quickly. Thats it!  Enjoy!

Tasty, but my cracker crumbs ended up as loose and dry at the bottom of the pan. For the pan size, I'd double the amount of margarine, and maybe mix it directly into the crumbs to make a paste.

Because I'm gluten free, I use Glutino's brand chocolate chip cookies (10 to be exact) and crush in food processor instead of graham crackers. I scale back a little on the chocolate chips because there are chips in the cookies.  My preference of nuts are pecans and I add toffee bits.  So yummy!! Thank you for a great recipe I can make, eat, and share. No one knows they are gluten free they're so good.

So simple, so good! Everyone loves these, and they take, like, 5 minutes to throw together and always turn out great. It almost feels like cheating the pay-off I get for the amount of effort expended. Recipe ratios are perfect. No adjustment needed.

I’ve made this three times in one week as it’s Christmas time. Then I wondered if a tipster/commenter had a suggestion for preventing it from crumbling. Someone said this isn’t the original-prob true. She said to layer it differently to hold it together. So I tried her tip aka the original version. Well she’s right on both accounts...HOWEVER it surely doesn’t taste as good as this version. The reason this magic bars 2 recipe is outstanding is because you get the same effect and the coconut isn’t turned into a hard candy substance. It’s also not as pretty as this version. So please do layers the nuts first then chips then coconut then milk.

Cut these into small pieces because they are very sweet—but oh so good. I made them exactly as written and they turned out great, but I have a couple of tips: be careful of over cooking, it makes them hard to cut & get out of the pan. Place the pan in the frig to cool them completely before you cut, otherwise you’ll have a big mess.

Amazing!  I read some of the other comments and made a few adjustments.  I melted the butter and mixed the graham cracker crumbs in a separate bowl .  I pressed the mixture into a 9x13 glass greased pan.  I used one 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk.   I followed all other directions.  I baked for 27 minutes.  They were perfect!

The flavors were fine, but I found it sickeningly sweet. The kids liked it, even my picky toddler, and I recall loving it when I was a kid. My sister used to make this with pretty much the same recipe. But, man, you gotta be serious about sugar to eat this. I ate a piece but felt like I was inviting diabetes. I threw the whole batch out. I couldn't even think of a way to scale back the sugar. The only changes I made was to mix pecans into the walnuts since I didn't have quite enough walnuts, and I used dark chocolate chips.

I too used less chocolate chips. I buy the darkest(most cocoa %) chips I can find. With the intensely dark choc chips less is better....otherwise, I could easily gain weight if I ate these very often, they are very good.

This is like eating a delicious candy bar. Like other reviewers, I used quick oats instead of graham cracker crumbs, and cut the butterscotch chips down to half a cup. My only complaint with this is that I found the bars very crumbly, but that may have been because of the oats.

These are a real crowd pleaser! So good. I'd recommend greasing the pan, not mentioned in the recipe, for fail safe easy removal.

I have loved Magic Cookie Bars since I was a child!  I had all but forgotten then until I ran across this recipe.  After running this recipe by my Mom, and hearing that it sounded just like what she made way back when, I decided to give it a try!  I'm so glad I did, and so are all of my friends.  Just amazingly delicious.  But yes, they are rich...so have two or three pieces!

Very easy to make and tasty (pretty much addictive!). I mixed the graham cracker crumbs and butter together, and pressed it in the bottom.  I think in the future I might try different combos like adding crushed pretzels as a reviewer suggested.  Easy to make at a moments notice.

Really, really sweet.  make sure your cracker crumbs are soaked before you add other ingredients,  add more butter if need be.  My bottom crust didn't turn out so good (fell apart).  I think because I used more crumbs than called for.

This is a truly wonderful recipe and one I make every year for the holidays.  Some tips that have made them really pop over the years:  After pressing the graham crackers and butter into the pan, bake it in the preheated oven for 10 minutes and let it cool before adding the other toppings.  This helps the crust hold together later when you remove it from the pan.  I also press the toppings into the condensed milk very hard or else these become very crumbly.  I've also found that an even mixture of butterscotch and dark chocolate chips is the one that people rave over.  These are very customizable though, so make them with whatever you like!

Let them fully cool before taking them out.  To get perfectly straight bars, I will throw the cooled pan into the freezer for 20 minutes to firm them up and make them easy to cut.

I made these as is save for switching the margarine for butter and walnuts for chopped pecans (only thing I had in the cupboard). They were very sweet, but went over very well with my friends. I think they could use all chocolate chips and no butterscotch chips, but they're worth trying for sure!

The changes I made resulted in an amazing bar.  First, mix the graham cracker crumbs with the butter and tamp down into the bottom of a square 9" baking pan lined with parchment paper (instead of a 9 x 13 inch pan).  Layer in the following order: graham cracker layer, sweetened condensed milk, nuts, 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips (omit the butterscotch!) and finish with the coconut layer.  Bake at 350F for 40 minutes.  Let cool in pan for an hour, then lift out with parchment paper and cut into squares.  This results in a slightly thicker bar, which is chewy and delicious.  Good luck!

Mmmmmmmmmm.....so, so good. These bars are delicious. As an added plus, they are nearly impossible to mess up. I am a terrible baker so I love it when a recipe for a baked treat doesn't 'out' me as someone who is too impatient to closely follow directions.

Nice!  I followed another reviewer's recommendation to use Quick Oats in place of the graham cracker crumbs and it worked beautifully!  My only issue was that the butterscotch chips were a tiny bit overpowering.  I may try this again and use peanut butter chips in place of the butterscotch.  The Significant Other, who is an abnormally vocal non-fan of both butterscotch and coconut was impressed but agreed that next time I should try it with peanut butter chips. Will do! Thanks for a good recipe.

I LOVE these bars, but I have found that if you mix the nuts, chips, and coconut in a separate bowl and spread them, then drizzle the milk on top it makes them more chewy, and they don't fall apart on you!

Every single time I make these party guests go crazy over them! I now make 4 times the amount to make everyone happy. I have also added dried cranberries to the mix (I half the amount of nuts) and it looks pretty. 

These will always be made in my house!!

I like the extra coconut in this recipe.  I do not care for butterscotch chips and substituted dried cranberries and used milk chocolate chips.  Very good.

Tasty but the crust was too crumbly. I did not tweak recipe. Will have to read reviews and try suggestions to get a firmer crust.

These bars were very easy to make and tasted fantastic.  I used a little less condensed milk that stated as the tin I used held less, however, they still turned out well.  I'll definitely make these again.

This is a great recipe-  although I couldn't get it out of the pan!  So stuck-I sprayed and followed the recipe exactly I scrolled the reviews no one else seemed to have this problem- but any tips would be appreciated.

I love these - but I would definitely use some cooking spray or grease the pan in the corners.  They were a bear to get out!  Otherwise - follow the recipe.  I made them for a baby shower, and everyone went crazy over them.

Very good! I didn't have graham crackers so I used quick oats ( as another cook suggested). They came out so good that I practically had to hide them to keep my husband and I from eating the entire pan by ourselves within four days!

Easy & delicious!  I pressed the graham crumbs/margarine mixture into the bottom of my pan though to ensure a nice even crust for every bite!

Tips: Mix crumbs with butter separately. Consider doubling crumb mixture for thicker base. I also felt that 1 cup of coconut flakes was plenty. Bake until flakes are toasty.

I have made this desert twice and it was great. My wife and son loved it. The second time I made desert I made a couple of changes. I used peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch chips, also I used an 8x11 pan it worked great.

We're gluten free and I was able to do this with a gluten free pretzel and butter crust on the bottom.  It's delicious.  Also pairs well with whatever GF chips I have on hand.  Used dried cherries and sliced almonds instead of coconut and walnuts since it's what my family prefers.  Looks very pretty for the holidays.

I followed the recipe and I wish I would have followed the tip about mixing the crumbs and butter. I at least pressed the crumbs down into the butter but when it came time to cut them some left their crust in the pan or it crumbled away. Everything tasted great though.

I am an experienced cook and followed the recipe exactly, however the bars did not hold together and are basically a nice tasting, crumbly ice cream topping. Any suggestions?

I LOVE these...yes, they are super sweet but I have a major sweet tooth so whenever I eat one (or two!) I am in heaven! After reading other reviews, I increased the graham cracker crumbs to 2 cups and slightly increased the amount of butter by just a tbsp or so...then mixed the two and pressed into the bottom of the pan. I poured the sweetened condensed milk over the top of the layers at the end right before baking. I lined my pan with parchment paper and had no trouble with sticking to the pan. This was absolutely perfect. The coconut was perfectly golden brown at the top :) I cooled in the fridge for a while before cutting into small squares. Also, I used a mix of about 1 cup each semisweet chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips. I'll be keeping this recipe forever! Thank you!

These were very good.  Husband loved them.  Very sweet.
After reading reviews first - I also added the butter and crumbs together and pressed the crust into the pan before adding other ingredients.  I also used a full can of milk.  Next time I will use only the milk the recipe calls for - but I will most likely make these again.

These were so yummy! I mixed semi-sweet, milk chocolate and butterscotch chips. They were nice and chewy. I'll definitely be adding this to my list of regulars.

This recipe is a great standby for a quick dessert that can be made in Large quantity! I prefer to use peanut butter chips instead of the butterscotch and occasionally I will throw in white chocolate instead of the butterscotch too for a little variety!

This is one of my husband’s favorite desserts.  I replace the butterscotch chips with milk chocolate chips.  I have also changed out the walnuts with different types of nuts because it's what I had on hand.  Easy and tasty! It’s hard to eat just one.

Per other reviews, I substituted 1 minute oatmeal for the graham crackers.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  The last substitution I should have made was chocolate chips (either white chocolate or semi-sweet milk chocolate) for the butterscotch chips. The butterscotch chips were fake tasting and ruined the flavor.  That is the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.  Otherwise, good consistency, held together well, a bit sweet, but all in all, a good tasty bar.

As someone who is not a baker these were incredibly EASY to make and they were a hit at two different holiday parties that I attended.  I don't care for nuts, so I didn't use them.   Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Very easy and very sweet - a little goes a long way.  I didn't have graham crackers, so I tried using oatmeal for the bottom.  Next time, I will puree the oatmeal, though.  I didn't like the consistency as much with whole oatmeal.

This recipe was good but the bottom "crust" was very soggy and unappealing. The flavor was good though. Good enough to warrant making it again with some modification to the gram cracker and margarine components. I followed the recipe except added an extra 1/2 cup of gram crackers and used pecans instead of walnuts.

Upon making them a second time, I reduced the sweetened condensed milk and it was just not as good. Not as chewy and much drier. Use the whole 
1 1/3 cups regardless of how sweet people say they are! just cut into smaller bars.

Very tasty but they stuck to the pan a bit on the edges.  I would suggest a baking spray since the butter for the crust wasn't enough.

This is one of my all-time favorite bar cookies! The perfect balance of sweet & salty flavors & SO moist. I have tried this recipe with different types of nuts too & no matter what kind I choose, it is still delicious.

Very good, and popular with the family. The only thing is that it was too sweet, so next time I'll use less condensed milk ( i used 14 oz this time according to a suggestion) but it would be best to stick to the recipe.

I followed the advice in other reviews and used just a little bit of extra graham cracker crumbs in the bottom of the pan, and I used pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I had on hand.  I refrigerated it when it was finished and my husband and I both enjoyed it much more cold than we did when it was fresh!  My only advice is to go ahead and add the extra crumbs to the bottom and to take the advice of several reviewers to butter the sides of the pan as well.  It can be pretty tricky to get out!

These are really good, and they come out seeming more impressive than how simple the recipe is.  They are sweet so I cut them into pretty small triangles.

These were so yummy, but I followed the advice of other reviewers: I used one bag of combo peanut butter & milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of non-fat sweetened condensed milk (you can't tell). Be sure to butter the sides of the pan, as I had trouble removing the cookie bars.

Delicious!  Only 4 stars due to the crust.  It was not substantial enough IMO.  Next time I will add more crackers or oats for a thicker crust.  Also, I used only 1 cup of semi-sweet chips and it turned out fine.  Will make again soon.

I think the pan size for this recipe with the measurements it provides should be an 8x8 pan. Using a 9x13 seemed too large. I even added half cup of graham cracker crumbs for the crust and it still didnt spread all the way out without having a lot of holes. I used 3/4 cup each butterscotch, semisweet and dark chocolate chips and it seems awfully thin. I havent tasted them yet but Im sure the flavor will be good. I will make them again in a smaller pan.

I was asked to make a dozen cookies for an event. So easy to whip up when pressed for time. I made them according to the directions. I didn't have any walnuts so I used pecans. Yummy. They were gone in no time. The men told me I could bring these any time I liked, they were sooooo good. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very yummy recipe. I used  1 can of low fat sweetened condensed milk and 1 cup semi-sweet mini chocolate chips b/c this is what I had on hand. It was very easy to make.  I served these to my parents and my kids (4ys and 2yrs) for a weekday lunch and they were so impressed I made something homemade. It was so easy and fast!

This is very easy make, and tastes pretty good. I give it 3.5 stars. I used a whole can of sweetened condensed milk, skipped the coconut, and used milk chocolate chips and semis-sweet chocolate chips instead of butterscotch.

Great recipe!  Bottom did come out a little mushy, but still tasted fine.   Flavor was great, and they were gobbled up in no time!  Might see if I can get away with using only one can of the condensed milk next time.  Seems like a waste to only use a few tablespoons of the 2nd can to get to 1 1/3 c.  Also might be intersting to try using a cookie-type crust?

easy and a huge hit at work. Used milk and semi-sweet chips, butterscotch would be WAY to sweet. Use the full 14oz can of milk too.

These are sinfully rich and delicious!  This is the recipe I always use for Magic Cookie Bars.  I follow the recipe exactly and they turn out great every time.  They are rich so it is helpful to cut into small squares for serving.

Very sweet, but VERY good. A total crowd pleaser. My husband loved these! I used a mix of white chocolate, butterscotch, and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I baked it in an 8x8 inch pan. Didn't have a problem with them sticking. Good. Quick, and easy.

Really really good.  Make sure you keep them refrigerated.  I took these camping in the Keys, and even though they stayed in an air conditioned camper, they developed a bunch of liquid at the bottom of the tupperware.

I found this particular recipe the easiest and the best from serving to taste. The crust worked up the best for cutting in a shorter amount of time. Other recipes took several hours to set and be able to cut. This one set up quick and makes it more user friendly.

Super yummy! I omitted the butter and mixed 1 cup of condensed milk with the graham crackers, next time I will use 2 pkg of crackers to make a thicker crust. I used 1/2 cup of white chocolate and 1/2 cup of heath toffee bits and it was fantastic!! Will def make again..

Easy to make!  I'm not a fan of coconut, but kept it in anyways.  The flavors of the chocolate and butterscotch were perfect and the coconut (I used unsweetened based on another reviewer) helped counteract the sweetness of the cookie.

A wonderful recipe, we used peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch b/c that's what I had on hand.  I would recommend not messing with the crust as I followed suggestions to double the crust and it ended up being a bunch of crumbs in the bottom of the pan.  I put half the milk on the crust and half on the coconut.  Will be following recipe strictly next time in hopes that the bars will stick together better.

These were good, but the butterscotch chips made them a little too sweet for my taste; my mom makes a similar recipe using chocolate chips with pecans, and I guess that's what I'm used to. I took these to a funeral and people really seemed to enjoy them. After baking, I broiled them on low for 1-2 minutes to brown the coconut. I'd make them again but would eliminate the butterscotch chips and sub pecans for the walnuts. Good recipe to experiment with. I also thought the crust was a little thin in spots, so next time I'd double the amount of crumbs and butter to make it a little thicker. Very good recipe overall.

fantastic and easy! i increased the crust ingredients a bit (in proportion) for a thicker crust, and combined the graham cracker crumbs with butter before spreading in the pan. The crust was firm and awesome. Ive made this recipe to take on vacation and it was a hit. I will continue to make it over and over!

Absolutely the best!  I have to say I was a bit worried.  I have made this before but with marshmellows a few years ago and it was a flop.  But this sounded so good I just had to try.  My only changes were I did not have enough graham crumbs so I used half graham and the other half oreo cookie crumbs.  I don't like walnuts and the only nuts I had on hand were dry roasted peanuts.  Yummy!!! I think this cuts down on the sweetness.  Give it a try.  I just have to stop eating them.

Thank you for the easiest dessert ever! I ended up using heath choc. pieces instead of the butterscotch chips and halved the nuts. It takes a long time to properly cool, but the final results remind me of the s'mores girl scout cookies.

EXTREMELY EASY AND FAST.  I love recipes that don't require precise measuring, complicated steps, etc.  This is the dessert equivalant of a "crock-pot" recipe...throw it all in and bake!

I used pecans instead of walnuts and it was even better! I did add more graham crackers (probably and extra 1/2 cup) to make there be more of a crust. Great bar! Thanks!

next time i'll make it with all chocolate chips rather than chocolate and butterscotch chips.  that's just my preference though.  and for everyone's info, one can of sweetened condensed milk is about 1 1/3 cups.

A friend of mine served these at a party and I (and everyone there) loved them! She seemed hesitant to give me the recipe and when I cornered her in the kitchen later she told me that they were embarrassingly easy to make. Great tasting and easy… well this cookie was meant for me!

These came out excellent. I made two batches. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and the second time, I substituted white chocolate chips for the butterscotch chips. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were great and a big hit with my friends and family. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had a really hard time getting the bars out of the pan! I let them cool for a LONG time and even refrigerated them for a while and still...problems. Maybe I'm doing it wrong?
Anyway- delicious!

Excellent and just about the easiest bar recipe you can make!  You'll definitely need more than 1 1/2 cups of graham cracker crumbs for your crust.  I added slightly more than 1/2 cup quick oats and then mixed with the margarine and pressed into the pan.  That way, I could ensure that the entire surface was covered with the crust.  I didn't have walnuts on hand, so used sliced almonds; I also didn't use the recommended amount of coconut - just eyeballed the amount I wanted.  Yumminess, but as other reviewers have said.... very rich.  Because of that, cut them small and you'll wind up with many more servings than 12.

Very very yum! And creative.  I did use chopped peanuts to offset some of the sweet.  And I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger to the graham cracker crust to give it sort of a "gingerbread" flavor.  A Christmas tradition for us!

I added an extra 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs (2 cups total), and added 4 tbsp of sugar to it. Turned out great!

Also put the condensed milk on top of the graham cracker crumbs.

Everyone loved it!  One suggestion is to pour the condensed milk over the graham crackers, then add the toppings.  This reduced the mess and made the crust crunchier.
