I used a gluten free flour mix (Brown Rice Flour Blend from Amy C on AR) cup for cup and buckwheat flour for oat flour. The cookies came out a bit fluffy but very tasty. Thank you for the recipe.

Tasty cookies.   The oat flour adds a different taste to the cookie and the ginger a bit of a bite. I dont know if kids would like these as much as adults as the ginger is rather strong and its not a sweet cookie.... went over great with the adults at church
