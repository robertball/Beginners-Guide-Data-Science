This was very tasty!  But when I was making it I thought I was doing something wrong because it didn't really blend well.  So be warned that it may look strange, but it was delicious with chicken nuggets.  It was more like the consistancy of duck sauce than what you might expect for standard honey mustard sauce.  A keeper for me- easily made while chicken is baking!

This is the honey mustard sauce I have been looking for. Great with chicken fingers. Went over great at the super bowl party!

Overall it tasted fine but I think I was expecting it to be a bit thicker.  I might play with the recipe a bit to see if I can get a thicker version.

This is a great dipping sauce for homemade chicken fingers.  Seems to be much healthier than others that include mayonaise.  I did use one reviewers suggestion and added a bit more cornstarch to get a thicker consistency.  Will use this recipe again.

Very tasty with our chicken nuggets, but I don't believe that the green onions are necessary, everyone asked "What's those green things in it?"

After reading previous reviews I decided to reduce the water to 1/3 cup and use warm water to help dissolve the honey more quickly, and I added an extra 1/2 tsp of cornstarch.  With the modifications I made I only had to simmer this for about 2 minutes before adding the mustard.  I preffered a streamlined version of this.   By omitting the lemon, and green onion and swapping the onion powder for garlic powder it tasted like a bottled dipping sauce.

This was very good! For a thicker sauce simply add an additional 3/4 teaspoon Corn Starch to the COLD water at the beginning.

My husband & made chicken in our fondue pot for Valentine's Day.  I made this sauce to dip the chicken in.  The only change I made was not adding green onions b/c I didn't have them.  The sauce was yummy!!

I made this sauce as a dip for the baked chicken nuggets and boy this was a winner. I used Grey Poupon and eased up a bit on the onion powder. It has a nice smooth tang but sweet cause of the honey and it is now going into my recipes as a keeper!

I thought this was an easy recipe, and a great start. I used a little less water, and I added a little sour cream at the end to make it more creamy. Next time I would half the honey.

Absolutely Delicious.  I used grainy Dijon mustard and it gave it such an interesting texture.  Look no further this is a winner!!  Thanks.

I love this sauce!  We used it with the Buttery Soft Pretzels recipe from this website which, by the way are excellent.  Instead of using 1 tsp of cornstarch, which I didn't have I used 2 tsp of flour instead, and because I didn't have any lemons on hand, I used 1/2 tsp of vinegar.  Also didn't have any Dijon mustard, so used spicy brown mustard.  Even with all these changes, the dipping sauce was excellent!  Thanks very much for posting this recipe!

My grand daughter loves the honey mustard from McDonalds so I wanted to come close to that taste.

She,  and the rest of the grandchildren,  loved this sauce (with chicken fingers) and said I should make it again.

This was yummy. Had a terrific flavor, better than any I;ve had at restaurants. I left out the green onions, but followed everything else exactly. Went great with the Breaded Chicken Fingers from this site.

This has a good flavor, but I was expecting it to be a lot thicker. It is a very thin sauce, almost watery. Next time I'll use half as much water.

very yummy! I did add twice the amount of cornstarch based on other reviews - maybe should only have done 1.5 times as much because it got a little gelatinous (but still delicious). Does not make a full cup, more like between half and 2/3 cup, which fortunately was enough for my family but just barely. Served with Simply Parmesan Chicken (from this site) and was a quick easy and healthy meal.

This was really good.  Although, I think next time I won't add the onions.  I think they should only be added by those who really love green onions.

We thought this was pretty good.  If I make this again, I will not add all the green onion as DH and I found that it was the primary flavour.  As well, I added probably an additional 1tbsp of Dijon mustard because we found the amount used in the recipe didn't give this dip enough of a Dijon-y flavour.

Delicious!  I didn't have onion powder; used finely chopped onion fried in a little oil, then had to liquidize sauce.  I used it on pork sausages (poured over 1 lb quartered, half cooked sausages & baked in very hot oven until bubbling.  My family rated this 5 stars.

I omitted the green onions because I havent seen it in a traditional honey mustard sauce. Made a good dip.

I have a good friend that is on a special diet and has to watch the types of things she eats.  This website has become one of my most used tools in finding things she's allowed to have so she will continue to have variety.  She loves honey mustard dressing but the store-bought varieties have things she isn't allowed.  This worked great for her and it was delicious to boot!

This was great. I did add more corn starch to thicken it up a little as I did not have 15 minutes to cook it. It came out just like the honey mustard sauce on Burger Kings Chicken Whopper sandwich.

This was a pretty good recipe. I only used 1 tblsp of honey (trying to reduce sugar content) and added garlic powder instead of onion because that is what I had on hand. We loved this and will make it again!

This was a good sauce.  I did not have onion power so I used garlic power instead & did not add the onion, turned out great. I may add a little more corn starch next time to make it a bit thicker. Still very good flavor wise.

I made this with parmesan-herb chicken strips. This sauce was quite good, though I wasn't expecting quite as much of a tang in the back of the throat. Someone wanting a sweeter sauce might want to cut the mustard by 1/4. Also, I added a little extra cornstarch, which made it a nicer thickness.

it was really good. i followed others advice and used more cornstarch and omitted the green onion. the only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because i felt like it was missing more of that sweet flavor. will make again!

I was quite disappointed with is recipe. Although I liked using cornstarch and no mayonnaise, I had to use more cornstarch for the consistency I wanted. It also wasn’t quite the taste I was looking for, so I added some prepared yellow mustard and a little of Keen’s powdered mustard for a bit of a kick. If I make it again, I think I’ll cut back on the honey because we found it a bit too sweet. With these changes, I’ll probably make it again and tinker with it a bit more. Thanks for the starter recipe.

This is a good sauce, but I changed it up a bit. I left out the Onion powder and the Green Onions. Instead I added 2 tbsp of Chulula Hot sauce and increased the amount of Lemmon and Honey. turned out really good.

Taste was amazing, but I found it was a little runny, could have been thicker. Also, the mustard clumps so you have to beat it well for a bit.

Easy recipe but too sweet. I added 1/4 cup of Dijon mustard to give it a kick instead of 4 tsp. Used ti on pork cutlets. Good combo.

good start. except i cut the honey in half & doubled the corn starch, then added 2 tbs sour cream, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 2 tbs mayo, 1 tsp horseradish sauce. tastes great, i might add worcestershire sauce later. i'm using this for a shrimp dip, so had to have the horseradish taste.

Love this dipping sauce!  I was looking for something to go with homemade chicken nuggets and had a hard time finding a honey mustard sauce that didn't involve mayonnaise, which I hate.  I gave this a try and it was a huge hit.  I don't care for green onions, so I leave those out, but otherwise I think this recipe is perfect- quick and easy.

This was great. I did double the corn starch to thicken it, as other reviewers stated. Besides chicken, I will try this with hot baked pretzels. Very nice and just a hint of mustard. Thanks for the great recipe, Michele!!!

Excellent.  I halved the recipe for two and it is plenty.  Didn't add the green onions only because I did not have any.  This is definitely a keeper.  This could also be used as a salad dressing with broiled chicken!  I used to order this honey dressing chicken salad often at one of our favorite restaurants, but it is now closed.  Now I can make it myself.  Thanks for sharing!

i served this as a dipping sauce for fondue bourguignonne and it needed to be thickened, so i substituted water for yogurt and sour cream. this way it holds onto the fried meat better. 
it was a big hit with chicken and shrimp and even my dad who cant seem to grasp the sweet+meat concept was impressed.

I skipped the green onion & lemon juice and it was just great.  I added a touch more cornstarch, too, to make it a bit thicker.  If I was using it as a salad dressing, I wouldn't have upped the cornstarch.  Very nice.

Good sauce.  Next time I will add a bit more mustard to make it even tangier.  I substituted 2 tsp of flour for corn starch because I was out of it.
