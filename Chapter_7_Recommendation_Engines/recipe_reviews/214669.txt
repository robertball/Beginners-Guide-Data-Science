Great flavor but next time I am using chicken thighs not chicken breasts. Thighs are much more suited to low and slow cooking. The chicken breasts got really dry. Also give this a stir once in awhile as it stews in the slow cooker. All that sweetness has a tendency to burn if your slow cooker gets hot spots. I will definitely make this again (with thighs!).

Love this Moroccan dish can also be made with lamb! I've never made mine in a slow cooker before only on the stove and this turned out just as good! I did add; 1 tablespoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon coriander and 1 tablespoon of honey. I also added zucchini carrot yellow squash and garlic to the couscous. I only gave it 4 stars because I did add different seasonings.

This was easy to prepare and quite deicious. I will consider adding potatoes or another vegetable next time to give it more substance. Overall we were all quite pleased with it!

Pretty delecious. I would actually omit the the apricots and add some chickpeas. The raisins provide enough sweetness but it does need more substance. I used breasts and it came out fine but I think will sure try the thighs next time.

We all loved this recipe even my 6 and 5 year old boys! I didn't have any raisins on hand and I used boneless thigh pieces (I always seem to dry out chicken breasts in my slow cooker!). I also included the curry powder and cayenne pepper. While it cooked for 5 hours I kept hoping it would taste as good as it smelled and it did not disappoint!

I only had bone-in chicken so cooked it most of the way then pulled the meat off the bone and threw it back into the slow cooker. It didn't dry out as much as I thought it might. The spices are nice but I left out the cayenne.

4 stars for ease and convenience. I suateed my onion first before adding to the crockpot. Bone in chicken works fine too. The bones come right off after cooking. Adding raisins towards the end of the cooking would help as they are quite unappetizing with such a long cooking time. This will be a staple in my chicken recipes.

This was amazing: easy to make and packed with flavor. I replaced the raisins with craisins and added diced zucchini julienned carrots and a spoonful of harissa. Cooked it in a tagine for 1.5 hours at 300 degrees. Delicious!

This did not do it for me. The combination of spices added some pepperiness but no real heat or flavor and just tasted odd with the sweetness of the apricots. Somehow with all those spices it still tasted bland. I added some paprika more cumin and some honey to try to brighten up the taste but it still tasted blah to us. Wouldn't make this one again.

Good but not amazing. The flavors were a little too sweet for my taste. I used whole chicken legs to make this so I left out any chicken broth.

This tasted even better than I expected! I used the High setting and even though it was late at night I had to sample a small portion - it was so good. I used 4 breasts and made sure the sauce/liquid totally covered them. I put 1/2 the onion amount below the breasts and 1/2 above before adding the sauce. Note: the number of servings = number of breasts in the pot (and they go Fast!)

I LOVE this recipe! I have made it many times for family and friends. I don't always have the dried fruit on hand so sometimes I add big bite-size pieces of carrot. Still tastes good! I also make naan on the side. We never have leftovers:)

Great recipe! I did replace the chicken broth and tomato paste with a can of petite diced tomatos and it was great. I also served this over rice...Will be making this again. Thank you for the recipe.

I liked the recipe in general. However I think next time I shall use less cumin because it dominated too much fresh ginger more of the dried fruits and the addition of some kind of nut like cashews for texture. Chicken breasts do well if you cube them small enough and slow cooker them long enough. I hate dark meat and this is what I have learned from experience.

This was great! I doubled the broth and only used 2 breasts of chicken. Also skipped the apricots. To take this recipe to the next level I'd add potatoes or carrots and use chicken thighs. I would also probably add even more broth & tomato paste to create more sauce. Definitely didn't need 2 onions I used 1/2 onion and it was fine.

The taste was a sweeter than I expected and not nearly as spicy as I hoped. It was actually a pretty mild dish. I'm thinking of increasing the amounts of cayenne pepper and curry powder next time. I cooked for 2 and a half hours. I might also try cooking for the longer time suggested in hopes that it may make the meat more flavorful

The sauce has potential but needs some salt. The chicken itself was rather flavorless. I think the recipe would be better if the chicken was sautéed with salt and pepper while the sauce simmers. No crockpot. We shall see how it turns out.

I thought this recipe was super easy and super delicious. I love the eastern flavors. The only change I made was stirring in a 1/4 stick of butter at the end for a richer texture and flavor. I would also add a little extra chicken next time because before we knew it we were left with a pot of sauce and veggies... That's how good it was! I recommend letting it sit in the fridge overnight. As good as it was when we made it it was twice as good the next day for lunch.

Followed the recipe ingredients exactly but cooked it on the stovetop. Warning this packs a heat if you add the cayenne.

I couldn't eat this my husband could. I think it's too many spices/herbs put together which produces an unpleasant taste. I really wanted to like this. I had to add about 1/4 cup of honey when it was done just so my husband could eat it that seemed to cut down on some of the odd pepperiness. Thank god I didn't add the cayenne or curry then the wild dogs outside probably wouldn't of eaten it. Save your time don't make this.

It was great! I do recommend adding more salt to bring out the great flavor of the other spices. I also advise using chicken thighs so it is more moist.
