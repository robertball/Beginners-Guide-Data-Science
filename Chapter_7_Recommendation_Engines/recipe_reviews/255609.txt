We really liked this dish.  It looked like a beautiful feast in the pan, and it did not disappoint!  Satisfying to the eye and to the tongue, it was a warm, filling lunch on a cold day in January!  My only change was to use turkey sweet Italian sausage, as that was all I could find at the grocer.  I also do not have a paella pan, so my 12" skillet was filled to the brim!  Thanks for posting, Cindy!

This was odd. It wasnâ€™t remotely close to a paella and tasted more like a stuffed cabbage. Hubby liked it, and I thought it was just okay. 3 cups of liquid was too much, and it never cooked off completely for us, so it was pretty soupy.

This tasted good and looked nice in the pan. However, once scooped into bowls, it looked awful. The leftovers looked even worse the next day -- they turned an awful shade of grey. Even though we all knew it tasted good, we had a hard time eating the leftovers because they were just so ugly. And my family usually doesn't care about presentation at all. I don't think I'd ever make it again simply because it presents so poorly.

This was fun to make for something different. For extra flavor I added paprika oregano and lemon juice. Quite yummy!
