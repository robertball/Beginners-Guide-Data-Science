As a former Nanaimo resident, I am very picky about keeping it authentic. But when I saw this Cherry Nanaimo bar, I had to try it as I love cherries. It is delicious, and it still retains that traditional Nanaimo Bar taste. I used almonds in the base layer, I also find that goes nicely with the cherry flavor! This is a very sweet dessert, the maraschino cherry juice makes it a little sweeter than a traditional Nanaimo bar. So if you are not a big sweet tooth person, use just milk or cream in replacement of juice and puree the cherries so you still get a pink filling.  This is a very festive and attractive dessert, perfect for a Christmas cookie platter!

Delicious! I used almonds instead of walnuts and a mixture of graham cracker crumbs and chocolate cookie crumbs because that what I had on hand; I also doubled the topping as I like a thicker layer of chocolate on top - Fabulous!  The whole family loved them!

Made this for a family gathering and it was a big hit - I made one error and did not finely chop the nuts for the bottom layer, but it was fine.  I had a hard time getting a nice, even layer of chocolate on top - still trying to figure out how to do that.  Otherwise this is a great recipe!

these are sure to be a hit on Christmas. we have nut allergies in the family so we can't buy the store made version. I skipped the walnuts and I used artificial almond extract. I tried to make a Christmas colour combination by using green cherries and red dye in the middle layer, sadly it turned beige but I'm sure the taste will be just fine. I used coconut oil instead of butter in the top layer and it melts and spreads really well.

We made these in high school back in the 80's and I still use the recipe to this day! Its a family tradition now for my family. Lots of people never heard of this and are surprised at how yummy they are!  A very good recipe! I recommend trying it!

I used non-sweetened fine coconut and omitted the sugar from the  bottom layer. I had chocolate graham crackers on hand so I used them and omitted the cocoa. It is still very sweet and everyone loved them. I didnâ€™t miss the extra sugar!

I'm sorry, but this is not a very good recipe at all..

Looking past the fact that a true Nanaimo bar is made with custard powder, the proportions do not seem correct in the slightest. Here are my gripes:

-the base is way too thick and the amount of graham cracker crumbs it calls for is obscene. I added maybe one cup and that was still too much, to the point where my base was so crumbly it just didn't even come together properly.
-I, like many here who have already commented, used almonds instead of walnuts. Walnuts would be great in the traditional recipe but if you're already using almond extract in the filling why would you use walnuts in the base?
-the cooking time for melting the butter together with the cocoa and sugar is  way too much; as is the lack of direction around not adding the egg to the hot butter/cocoa/sugar mix -- you end up with scrambled eggs if you don't temper it. 
-they're really ought to have been more sugar and more cherry juice added to the middle layer. Also, you need at least another teaspoon of almond extract if doing this.
-you really need to double if not triple the quantities of chocolate top layer because the amounts called for here or not nearly enough.

I am very disappointed with how this recipe turned out and I would not make it again... Serves me right for trying to make a recipe with a twist and not just following the tried-and-true original.

Used almonds in place of walnuts. This has been a Chritmas favorite for over 20 years with my family

I omitted the nuts and coconut from the base and increased the graham cracker crumbs and cocoa. For the middle I had to add quite a bit more icing sugar as it was too soft and I was concerned it wouldn't set up in the fridge. I doubled the chocolate topping as I like a thicker chocolate layer. The bars were actually better than I thought they would be as I am not a maraschino cherry fan, it does taste like a cherry blossom candy.

Tastes like a softer, fresher version of the store bar Cherry Blossom candies. I used coconut oil instead of butter without issue, might add a pinch of salt next time to compensate. A new fav of mine.

So good! Very easy to put together, and very tasty. Mine were a bit thin as well, but it didn't really matter. I will definitely make these again. What a great idea!

When I made these Nanaimo Bars, they turned out thin but not too thin, and very sweet. Sweetness is not a problem for me.....

The filling was very sweet, but everyone loved them.  I doubled the chocolate layer and was glad I did.  Thanks for the tip.
