This recipe is simple and easy to do. My family said the eggplant needed more garlic and maybe some cajun seassoing. So, next time I make this I will add fresh garlic  and roast on the grill.

i modified the seasonings and served it as the main. 

after brushing each piece with olive oil,  i seasoned with onion powder*, paprika, garlic powder, italian seasoning, and salt*. i will likely brush the sides with garlic as well the next time and leave in the oven a tad longer so that the final presentation is crispy. 

*new seasoning

I will make it again with a few changes - make sure the seasoning does not clump in one area of the slice, also I would use less salt.  I followed the advice of keeping it in the oven for a little longer.  I liked the crispiness of the eggplant.
