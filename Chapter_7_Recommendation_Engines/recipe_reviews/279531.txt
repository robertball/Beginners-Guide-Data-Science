This is delicious!  Also, I use turmeric for a mango lassi.  It can be made with yogurt or coconut milk but I love the original  with yogurt. Oh, I also use turmeric (secret ingredient) in my homemade enchilada sauce.  No one has ever complained of indigestion because of this addition.

To the reviewer that states there is wayyyy too many calories in this recipe because of the coconut milk. The recipe calls for coconut milk beverage which has only 40 calories per cup not canned coconut milk. Also the sweetener is optional, just as stated on the recipe.

1 packet stevia sweetener is not needed! Pineapple is already sweet enough. Tumeric is a good source of getting this daily although, coconut water is a way healthier version of this smoothy as coconut milk as way to much calories! Overall this is not that great!
