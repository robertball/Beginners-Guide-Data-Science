There were way too many cracker crumbs, and the onions were undercooked. If I were to make this recipe again I would increase the cooking time and omit the crackers. One good thing is that the sauce was a nice compliment to the flavor of the onions. Thanks anyway.

I tried other creamed onion recipes on this site.  This one is the best.  Others used heavy cream, but did not thicken as much I like.  I used another persons advice and added a dash of hot pepper sauce.  Great recipe!! Thanks

2.10.19  You’re basically making a white sauce (bechamel) to go over the onions.  I’d recommend melting your butter, then add the flour, and whisk and cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes, eliminating the raw flour taste.  Next, add your milk, salt and pepper, and stir until smooth and thickened. I scaled this down to 4 servings, which then called for 25 crackers.  I looked at the size of my casserole dish, knew that would be W-A-A-A-Y too many crackers, so I used 12 and would do that again, maybe even cut back to 10.  And I wouldn’t worry too much about toasting your crackers in butter in a saute pan.  I know next time I’ll just mix the melted butter with the cracker crumbs, and sprinkle on top of the onions.  The butter-cracker crumbs will toast while you’re cooking the onions in the oven, and you’ll save yourself a dirty pan to wash.
