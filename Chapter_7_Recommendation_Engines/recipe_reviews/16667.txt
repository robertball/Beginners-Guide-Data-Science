This is one of the best recipes for the bread machine I have.  I do things slightly differently. I use olive oil instead of butter, fresh oregano from my garden chopped instead of parsley, 2 t. garlic cloves crushed instead of powder, and splenda instead of sugar.  I put almost everything in the warm water first than the flour than the oregano and yeast go on top.  The taste with these changes is excellant.  (I tried it to the letter first and didn't like it.)  If you find the bread doesn't raise very much just use the "scale this recipe" to adjust it.  I find that 16-18 servings uses my 2lb. machine to capacity better than leaving it at 12 (the original setting on the recipe.)  Good luck!  ~jllebow

Overall, I'd say this recipe was very good, though I did take the advice of other reviewers and ended up modifying mine somewhat.  First of all, I omitted garlic powder altogether and instead used three pounded cloves of fresh garlic-- you can most definately taste the garlic, but it is not overpowering.  I also did not have any powdered milk, so I used 1/4th cup of condensed milk-- I think adding actual liquid instead of powdered milk improves this bread because others have complained of it being too dry.  I added 1/2 tsp oregano, 1 tsp rosemary, and used vegetable oil instead of butter.  I always hate the look of bread baked in a bread machine, so I set my machine for a dough cycle and finished the bread in the oven.  When the dough cycle was completed, the bread had not risen very much at all even though the yeast was fresh.  I turned the dough out onto a cookie sheet, covered and let rise for another half hour, then baked at 300 degrees for about 50 mins, brushing the top of the loaf with more oil before baking and again halfway through.  When it was done, the bread was VERY soft and dense, the crust was perfection.  I had friends over, and the entire loaf was eaten by us with just butter.  Everyone loved it!  I will be making another loaf tomorrow :).

I made the dough in the bread machine, then rolled it out onto a pan and made cuts in it and baked it in the oven for garlic bread sticks. I then brushed olive oil and sprinkled garlic seasoning and parmesan cheese (close to end of baking) on it. We ate the whole thing that night. But i find the amount of garlic powder in the recipe doesnt give it enough of a garlic flavor.

The bread that we made that was inspired by this recipe was very, very good, but this is because we didn't follow the recipe.  I highly recommend dropping the milk powder and water as well as the garlic powder and instead using 1/3 cup whole milk and minced garlic.  The flavor is much better and the bread cooks up better!

The bread itself was tough and crumbly.  However, the *idea* of adding garlic and parsley to 'your favourite bread mix' will be a winner, I am sure!

Our family and friends loved this.  Based on other reviews, I added a bit more garlic and it was perfect.  It's definitely a keeper.

I was not too fond of this bread.  It may be my own fault.  I had to make some substitutions.  I used fresh garlic and parsley, because I did not have the dried. I should have left the crust selector on Light.  The crust was tough.  I like crusty crusts, but this was more just hard.  I will try it again when I can remedy my substitutions.

Great basic recipe!  I doubled the garlic, and used italian seasoning blend in place of the parsley (doubled the amount, again).  I also added about 2 TB of parmesean cheese.  Turned out great, and was wonderful served with lasagna!

I tryed and loved it.  I used some suggestions from other reviews, adding 1 tbsp minced garlic and where it says 1 1/2 tsp salt I added 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp garlic salt with parsley.  Also I put a little more parsley than it called for.  Sliced with a little butter put in the oven for a few minutes wonderful.  Love it!!Thanks!!

The sweet smell of garlic filled the air and everyone asked for more. It didn't take long for the loaf to disappear. The trouble was that they had to wait another 3 hours for another one to bake.  Great recipe! (I used 3 tsp of minced garlic and substituted Italian seasoning for the parsley)

I found this bread to lack flavor, texture, and a good crust, everything you want in a good bread. I will not be making this again.

This recipe is AWESOME! I chose to use butter and let in melt in the warm water before I put the water in the machine. Also, instead of garlic powder I used 5 fresh chopped cloves. Use basic setting light crust. Really moist and yummy!

Well I didn't read the reviews on this one before I made it and wish I had. I made this recipe as written. The bread is very good...it is dense but that's what I like about it. The family gobbled up the whole loaf at dinner. The problem is that I didn't realize it only yielded a one pound loaf. Had I known I would've doubled the recipe. The recipe states this yields a 1 1/2 pound loaf so I assumed it would come closer to the top of my two pound pan than it did. Instead it actually came to a little less than halfway.
I will make this again but I'll double the recipe.

This Bread filled my whole kitchen with the wonderful smell of garlic. The bread wasn't dense, unlike some other breads I have made before. Advice to rinse your mouth throughy after eating.

I made this recipe tonight with chicken and spaghetti and my husband flipped over it. It was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to use an additional tsp. of garlic powder and I threw in a few sesame seeds.

I love this site.

This bread was pretty good. It could of used some minced garlic and more spices. In other words there wasn't enough flavor. The tetxture was very nice. It was soft on the inside and crunchy on the out.

I thought this recipe was great!!! My Family loved it!  A little more garlic needed than what was on recipe, but she did warn us about that!!
I would highly suggest this recipe to anyone who has a bread maker!!! ;-)

This will be my staple with Italian meals. As breadsticks it is great, and it works with 1/2 whole wheat flour-1/2 white.  Plenty moist.

I agree -- definitely needs more garlic.  Next time I'll go with real garlic instead of powder.  But my kids devoured it and it was delicious!

This bread is the best!! You can really do so much with this recipes.  Try adding some crushed red peppers, or for your everyday sandwhich bread do everything thing the same in the recipes, just leave out the spices.  This makes the most moist and tastiest loaf you will ever eat.  I have tred so many bread recipes and have been let down, but this one by far is the best.  You can also add 1/4 cup of honey and switch the cup of warm water to milk ( leaving out the spices) and you will get the same as the milk and honey bread you can buy at the store.  But back to the garlic bread, it is so good, you must try!!  Serve warm with butter! :)

I made some changes that took this recipe to the next level.  Rather than add garlic powder, I added 10 cloves of fresh roasted garlic and 1 tbsp of cracked pepper.  WOW!  This will make your sandwiches rock!  I can't wait until lunch...

I followed other reviewer's directions and made this on the dough setting and formed my own loaf to bake for 45 min at 350.  I also added both garlic powder and fresh garlic and some parmesan cheese.

This was a nice bread, even though I overcooked it it turned out nice and soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I didn´t have any powdered milk available so I used 1/4 cup of evaporated milk. Also I doubled the amount of garlic and replaced the salt for Garlic & Herb seasoning. VERY YUMMY!!!!!

I used crushed garlic 1 tbsp instead of powdered garlic and unfortunately it didn't taste very garlic-like.  I think I will add alot more next time...but the bread was good even so.

My family absolutely loved this bread machine recipe! I did make the following substitutions: 1 Tbl. vegetable oil, instead of butter, 3 tsp garlic powder, and 1 1/2 tsp. of "rapid rise" yeast, instead of the regular active yeast. When I use this yeast, I've used an appropriate "basic bread - Rapid" cycle for the machine, and have had great bread as a result.

I actually made these into rolls.  I put the ingredients in the bread machine on the dough setting.  Then cut the dough into individual rolls and baked them for 15 min.  WOW!  I have none left!  I made 12 rolls, and between myself and 3 others, we ate all of them.  REALLY good warm with butter.  I did add more garlic.

Can’t give this a 5 star as I veered from the original recipe.  I used some condensed milk and basil and other spices in the bread.  In addition, I made the dough here as some other suggested and made my own garlic bread.  It smelled wonderful, but despite how much garlic you put in it, it was still lacking flavor.  

BIGGEST HINT IS TO BE SURE TO LET THE BREAD STICKS RISE AFTER YOU ROLL OUT THE DOUGH.  It made enough for two batches of about 8 bread sticks.   The dough ball froze well for later.  Oil the ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, freeze it until it is not pliable, and then put it in a freezer bag.  It defrosted well and baked up just like when it was fresh.

I read the comments and added extra butter for moistness and used two cloves of real garlic instead of the powder. (Tip - put saran wrap over grater before grating garlic cloves for less waste.) It turned out small and fairly crusty, but it could have been due to my lack of experience with my bread machine. The inside of the loaf was light and moist. The flavor was good but not very garlic-y, which makes me think I'd use 3 cloves of garlic next time.

My 9 year old son and I both loved this!  Like another user, I used Olive oil instead of butter.  Mine was not "dense", nor was like "a doorstop"!  It did not sink and there was a perfect amount of garlic.  Fantastic, thank you!

AWESOME!!! I took the advice of another and used 3 tsps fresh minced garlic, 1 tsp of oregano and basil.  This bread had plenty of flavor. It is very similar to the loaves of bread at the Macaroni Grill.  Dipped it in olive oil and balsamic vinegar!  A KEEPER.  Great with pasta dishes.

The inside of this bread is soft and the outside is really crispy, almost like french bread.  The garlic made my kitchen smell really good.  You might need to add more garlic to the recipe to make it more obvious while eating it.  I didn't have dry milk, so I just subtracted a tablespoon of water and added regular milk.  I then added 1 Tablespoon of potato flakes (because I had used them in the Hawaiin bread that was really good).  I don't know if the potato flakes made a difference or not but the bread is really good.

Wonderful recipe!  I reduced the garlic (because I ran out).  I topped a slice with pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese - baked at 350 til melted and it was a delicious lunch the next day!  I will definitely make this recipe again (and again :) Thanks!

I thought this was real good.  It didn't have as much garlic flavor as my family would have liked but we still thought it was good.  Very soft on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside.  Next time I will add more garlic powder and replace the salt with garlic salt.

This turned out perfectly for us. Everyone in the family loved it, even the (somewhat particular) 16-mo-old. The only change I made was substituting a full TABLESPOON of minced garlic for the 2 teaspoons garlic powder as another reviewer recommended. Everything else was spot-on and my husband raved about it, from the crust to the taste to the texture and even how the house smelled when it got done baking. We will definitely be making this one again.

This bread was wonderful! After I started I realized I was out of parsley so I used two tablespoons basil instead.  This bread had an amazing basil garlic flavor...not sure why some people's bread lacked garlic flavor, maybe the brand of garlic powder?? Anyway, followed directions to a T except the the parsley/basil switch and this is a new favorite. It does make a somewhat short loaf, but when it's cut it looks like real sliced loaf bread, not that tall bm bread.  Made eggplant sandwiches on this bread toasted....mmmmm!  A+++ recipe!

My boyfriend loved this bread!!!!!!! I have made bread machine recipes many times and they always come out kind of dry and bland. This one was very soft in the middle and slightly crunchy on the outside, perfect texture!!! I did make some changes to the recipe, I did not have dry milk so I used about 1/8 or a cup of whole milk. And my family loves garlic so I used about 4 teaspoons crushed garlic and a little more parsley then called for. I would reccomend adding the extra garlic if you like garlic otherwise you can barely taste it. Very good bread Will make many times and use diff variations!!!!!!

This bread was pretty good.  The garlic was not too overpowering.  I will probably make it again.

Really good recipe!  My first attempt at baking bread in a machine and it turned out delicious, although, I wouldn't put in as much garlic next time.  Personal preference.

I used 3 T honey in place of the sugar, and 1 T garlic cloves rather than powder. I also used olive oil instead of butter. Yummy!

This Bread was very good. I made it in my Oster bread machine and it was very light and fluffy. Do remember to make sure all of your measurments are exact though.

Made two loaves in one day!  Made first as part of dinner for a new mom.  Sliced up and shared a slice with my children.  Set up second loaf in machine immediately!!!!  Added extra minced garlic on top of garlic powder called for in recipe just because we love garlic.  That's the only change.  Made entirely in machine and crust was perfect!

I went off of another reviewer's advice and subbed out the dry milk for 1/4 cup of half and half (best I could do).  Added rosemary and basil, diced up 4 cloves of garlic AND added a bit of garlic powder (my boyfriend and I love garlic).  It really needed the extra liquid, it came out PERFECTLY.  I used the dough setting on my bread machine and formed the dough into a long italian loaf.  FANTASTIC!

This is an awesome bread.  I made it last night with our spaghetti dinner.  I changed just a few things.  I did 1 cup milk in place of the water AND powdered milk.  I also replaced the powdered garlic with a few gloves of fresh chopped, and I used 2 1/4 tsp yeast.  I set my loaf color for light.  I got a soft, delicious, flavorful, and aromatic loaf.  We topped each slice with a bit of butter and sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  It was a perfect addition to our meal.

This smelled great when it was baking.  However, when I sliced it, it was extremely dense.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I can think of is that the recipe does not state the loaf size.  I chose 1 1/2 lb, since that seems to be the most common size.  Perhaps I should have chosen 2 lb.  One thing I did that I would recommend is that, after slicing the bread, I put the slices on a cookie sheet, sprayed them with butter flavored cooking spray, sprinkled them with shredded parmesan cheese and then broiled them for a few minutes to toast the bread and melt the cheese.

Very good.  I made a few adjustment from the beginning.  I used 1 cup of warm milk instead of the water and the powdered milk.  I used 1 Tbs. of olive oil instead of the butter.  I added 1/2 Tbs. each of died basil and oregano.  I used 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup white flour.  I also used three cloves of Garlic, minced.  

It was most delicious out of the bread maker, hot,  and with butter spread on the top.  The only disappointing thing was waiting for the bread maker to finish baking the bread.

I thought this bread was good. Would have been better if I choose the medium crust setting on the bread maker rather than the light.  I also added italian seasoning. Very addictive.

Measured two teaspoons fresh pressed garlic plus one teaspoon garlic powder.  Had a good garlic taste but not too much.  I was surprised how short the loaf turned out, it was only 5-6 inces high!!!  Was it because of the fresh garlic??  Still it was big enough for us.
Thanks,
Michele, cambridge ontario

This turned out nicely, however I concur with all the reviewers who have said that it needs more garlic.  Next time I would double it (I used 2 tsp. fresh minced).  I would also replace 1/2 of the parsley with 1/2 Italian seasoning.  Since I live at a high elevation (about 4500'), I increased the water to 11 oz. and decreased the yeast to 1 tsp.  For our own personal preferences, I cut the salt down to 1 tsp.  This was good, but it can be improved.

I loved this bread! I only made a few changes. Our bread machine was missing a part so instead I made it by hand and baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. Instead of using garlic powder I listened to many other reviews and used three cloves of garlic. I replaced the butter with olive oil. As I wanted this bread to be nondairy I switched the milk powder for a tablespoon of rice milk. This is certainly a must do bread, moist on the inside, crisp on the outside. Next time I will try it half and half with whole wheat.

I used a bit less parsley and added 1/2 t onion powder, 2 t dried basil and 1/2 t oregano, then needed to add an extra 2 T water because my dough was a bit dry.  Bread turned out great though!  We thought it was pretty garlicky.  Not as garlicky as bread made with garlic butter spread on top, but the garlic flavor was definitely there.  The herbs I added helped too since they added a lot of flavor, but it would have been good just as written as well.  Dried parsley is more for color than flavor, anyway.  Will definitely make this again!

My family loved this bread though I did follow a few suggestions from other reviewers before making it.  I changed the butter to oil, the parsley to oregano and I used crushed garlic instead of powder.  I added 2 cloves of garlic for a 2lb loaf which gave a subtle garlic flavour which I would do again when making the bread for other people however my family adore garlic and I will try doubling it next time!

I did not have active dry yeast. I used 1 1/4 teaspoons of bread machine yeast. Other than that I followed the recipe. It turned out really good. It is not overly garlic-y. I will be making this bread again.

I made sure to sift my flour, and only used a scant 3 cups. Added a tablespoon of baking soda. Also used honey instead of sugar, olive oil instead of butter, and minced garlic (plus a couple spoonfuls of juice!) instead of powdered. Very tasty loaf, perfect with the split pea soup I'm also having tonight!

This is an excellent bread!! I made it to go with a spaghetti dinner for my daughters 1 st b-day.  It got rave reviews!  I will admit, I made several changes.  After reading what others wrote, and looking at a couple of similar recipes I made the following changes:  Added 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesean cheese, oregano instead of parsley, about 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, 3 large cloves of fresh crushed garlic.  I still had the problem that others mentioned, with the bread falling, I think that adding about 1/4 more flour would fix that.  Also, next time I will add two more cloves of garlic, it was good, but not a very strong garlic flavor.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was a so-so recipe.  I tried it as it's written and it didn't rise well, was drier than a bone and didn't taste like garlic at all.  I decided to try it again with a twist:  

1 c. water
1 tbsp. EVOO (extra virgin olive oil)
1/4 c. milk
1 tbsp. sugar
1 1/2 tsp. salt
4 cloves minced fresh garlic
3 c. flour
1 1/2 tsp. active dry yeast
1/2 tsp. oregano
1 tsp. rosemary

To really get the taste of the herbs, I heated the oil slightly and added the herbs to really get it going.  Then I added it in.

Made this bread to serve along with cheese fondue. I baked the bread in the oven. It was very good with just a hint of garlic. It was soft and still good a couple of days later.

This bread has a wonderful aroma to it as it's cooking and is delicious with soups! I used a little more garlic than it called for just because I love garlic!

It was very good. It was only the tiniest bit dense, it rose up just fine, but overall it was very good and I can't wait to make it again! Thankyou Nicole!

The flavour was there, it tasted great but it only rose to halfway up the pan and it was quite dense. I'll try it on the dough cycle, roll it into buns and finish baking it in the oven, hopefully that'll help.  Thanks anyway!

Awesome!  Wow, did my house smell fantastic!  I used olive oil instead of butter, and Wildtree Herbs' Garlic and Herb Blend along with 2 tsp. fresh minced garlic.  Superb!

I don't like to give bad reviews so I am giving this recipe 4 stars as it does have potential.  I made as directed the first time and it wasn't very good.  I have made it a couple of times since and have omitted the Italian Seasoning and garlic powder.  Instead I used 3 heaping teaspoons of fresh minced garlic, 1 teaspoon each of dried oregano and basil.  This version is wonderful, with my extended family loving it.

I was out of plain garlic powder so I substituted the same amount of McCormack's Garlic and Herb Seasoning, and I cut the dried parsley in half.  Man!  It is a bread to die for!!!  It's especially good when used to make hummus sandwiches.

Definitely give it a try.

The only reason I am rating this a four is because this is the basic bread recipe with the added parsley and 2 teaspoons of garlic powder. I actually used this to make dinner rolls, which is basically the same thing, just in dinner-roll format. The crust *is* quite crispy, and the bread on the inside is very soft and moist. Though I do not have a bread machine, I still made this by mixing all ingredients excepting the flour, which I added last. 2 and 1/2 cup of flour is plenty enough flour to use, and I suspect using a little less would still result in a good bread. If you really like garlic, I would suggest omitting one teaspoon of garlic powder and adding one clove of minced garlic. Also, since I did not have dry milk powder, I substituted it with a teaspoon of half and half which worked out fine.

Wonderful bread - great texture.  It works perfectly for making garlic bread on the BBQ.  Cut it thick, butter and more garlic powder, put butter side down on tin foil, fold over and place on top rack in BBQ for about 10 minutes.  Thank you for this great recipe, Nicole!

I've made a lot of bread in my bread machine but this loaf turned out pretty disappointing.  I increased the garlic some others suggested and you could still barely taste it.  Also, my loaf came out hard and small so maybe my yeast was off or I did something wrong, I'm not sure.  Will make again just to see if I can get it right.

This is a great recipe.  I just
tweeked it a little, added honey
instead of the sugar, and Rosemary
instead of the Parsley, and half of
the salt.  This bread goes good with
Chili or Spagetti, or even with
fried eggs. I let it rise and baked
in a regular loaf pan.

This made a pretty decent basic white bread, but for a garlic bread it didn't pass the test. We couldn't taste hardly any garlic in it, even though I added extra garlic.

I made 2 loaves of this for a church function and it was PERFECT!  My friend called me after to rave about how the garlic perfectly balanced the lasagna it was accompanying.    I was nervous because the batter looked a bit wet when it was first kneading, but it came out just fine.

The best french garlic bread recipe I have found.  Used one reviewers modification of olive oil for butter, 1/4 c condensed milk instead of powdered and added my own fresh herbs - parsely, oregano and rosemary.  Used  2 tsp minced garlic instead of powdered and it wasnt very garlicy.  Maybe a little more.  Put bread machine on dough cycle.  Added more flour as it worked the dough. Turned it out on a cookie sheet but it was sticky and I added flour as I patted it into shape.  Let it sit covered for 30 min and then baked at 300 for 50 minutes.  Perfect.

I love this recipe! It is so easy. The only thing I do different is I cook mine in the oven since I don't like the way my bread machine cooks bread. I roll it out like french garlic bread and bake at 350. My whole family loves it.

Perfectly fluffy and flavorful bread!  I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder, and threw in a little rosemary and oregano as I didn't have any parsley on hand.  Will certainly make again!

I had no problems with a flat loaf - s a matter of fact it rose right up to the top of my machine - waiting for it to 'bake' now - smells wonderful. Only thing I added was a "splash" of milk as it was kneading - it appeared a bit sticky without it.

I love this recipe!  I use olive oil instead of butter, and herbs of provence instead of parsley.  I love it plain, or toasted with some butter.  I make 2 or 3 loaves a week.  It always comes out great.

YUM!!!!!  My S.O. and I LOVE this recipe!!!  Usually, he doesn't like bread with "stuff in it" ... but, this was different ... I mixed this in my bread machine, then made rolls ... at first, he was like, "What did you put in those?" when he saw the parsley, but he gave them a chance, and he's eaten almost all of them since last night ... :)  Oh, btw, I used a couple of heaping teaspoons of minced garlic instead of the dried stuff ... it was perfect ... not overwhelming, just right ... :)  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really tasty! I used Tones granulated garlic & added more. I thought at first it was going to be too garlicky for kids but they loved it. I didn't have parsley but have a homemade italian parmesan herb blend that I was given as a gift. I have no idea what is in it but I used about 3 T. This bread did not rise very well but everyone in the family really liked the flavor.

We made this into a dough and made breadsticks and added some butter and parmesan cheese.  I thought it was too garlicky, but my family thought it was GREAT!  NO leftovers!

Excellent!  Even better when sliced, buttered with garlic butter and put under boiler to toast.  Good with Italian food.

The flavor is phenomenol!  I used fresh basil and 1/3 c half and half as suggested by someone to use the milk.  It definitely wasn't enough.  I kept adding until the dough looked moist.  I will try original recipe first next time and then experiment.  It didn't raise well either.  Once again, the flavor was fabulous!

Bread has good texture and taste but is not very garlicky.  I used Basil instead of Parsley like another reviewer had said and I thought that was pretty good.  Overall the recipe turned out very well.

The bread turned out nice and moist, though it lacked that "garlic" flavor.  I think it needs alot more garlic and next time I will add some fresh garlic to see if that helps.

Like some of the other reviewers, I used fresh garlic cloves rather than powdered garlic. The loaf does not rise much and consequently is quite dense, but the flavour is wonderful! This is one that gets made over and over at our house!

A suggestion to people who tried and failed with this recipe - why not follow your bread machine's instructions for a white loaf and add parsley and garlic powder? Then the wet/dry ratio will match your machine's loaf size and should yield better results.  I'm going to try this myself tomorrow.

I found this bread just okay....it definitely needs something.  I added 2 tsp garlic powder, but if I were to make this again, I would also add a clove or two of fresh garlic and maybe some shredded sharp cheddar.

This bread was dense. At first I thought my yeast was no good.  I checked it and yeast was fine.  When I sliced this bread the texture was nice. The taste was only o.k.  Thank you for the recipe but, I will keep looking.

Very good bread.  I found it to be a very soft dough when I took it out of the bread machine.  Easy to work with.  Most of all it tasted good.  I used it for a pizza dough.

We had friends over for dinner today and I tried out this recipe on them. It got rave reviews from the four of us. It was very soft and fluffy inside with the outside having a crusty texture. Next time I will use more garlic.

Very flavorful bread, especially if you like garlic. It collapsed in my bread maker, though--maybe I'll use less yeast next time I make it. I will definitely use this recipe next time I want to make garlic bread. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have made this bread about 5 times. For the most part it turns out very well. I have had it not rise very well twice probably due to my own error. It is a great recipe though.

The second time I made this bread I added more garlic to it. This seem to fullfill 
my families requirement for garlic. Its a truly simple loaf of bread anyone able to read the recipe
and knows their bread machine can make it.

Thanks for a good recipe.

I used the dough cycle and cooked it in the oven for a hour at 350 degrees.  It was good and I would make it again but I have to admit the smell was better than he taste.  My picky son did like it!

I live in colorado, so bread doesn't cook the same for me. I had to add about 1/4 cup of water because the dough was a little too dry. After this correction I baked the bread in the oven instead of the breadmaker at 350 for about 15 min. Bread was I hit. Will make again :)

I made this tonight as an alternate for the stand by garlic bread. The recipe as written must be flawed somewhere because I followed it a T and and I barely rose, the crust was ridiculously hard and there was hardly any garlic flavor to it. I like the idea, not so much the results.

Like most I tweaked recipe to make it my own. I finely diced 3 cloves of garlic and it and olive oil to the water in bread machine. Flour, dried oregano and yeast. Set machine in dough program. I was surprised how sticky it was. No problem though. It fell onto a parchment lined cookie sheet.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I put the machine on light crust.  My entire family liked it.  I would probably use garlic salt in place of the salt the next I make it; but that is the only change I would make.

This was very good bread.  I usually use the dough cycle on my bread machine and finish it off in the oven.  Let the machine cook this time and it came out very goo.  My wife loved it too.  I thought it could have used more garlic though.  Had it a few days later.  Used a garlic spread on it and browned it under the broiler.  Came out great.  Use this bread up fast because it does not stay fresh long (due to the lack of preservatives?)

I used skim milk instead of water and dry milk. I used olive oil instead of butter, 3 minced cloves of garlic instead of powder, and Italian seasoning instead of parsley. Tasted great- was soft and moist with a nice crust. Served this with pasta and a salad. Added a glass of red wine to make it the perfect meal. Will be making this often.

We made this last night but substituted fresh garlic and whole wheat flour. We ended up having to use twice the amount of water given in the recipe to make a good-consistency dough (maybe because of the wheat flour?), but after our adjustments, the bread came out PERFECT. We ate it fresh with butter and it was garlicky and delicious, and we had it day-old today sliced with cheese melted over it in the broiler! Better than the french bread/garlic butter garlic bread that I usually make!

I followed suggestion & added more garlic powder.  I also prefer to bake my bread in the regular oven.  This bread was very good!!  I froze half for another meal, so we wouldn't eat too much bread at once.

Weird crust - very hard and crunchy - like a bread stick.  Flavour on inside good.    Changed the following things:  olive oil instead of butter, no parsely.  Used the dough cycle and the dough looked and felt great coming out of the machine.  Made into buns and baked 35min @ 375.  Not sure I would make this one again.

Not having a bread machine, I made this using my KA.  I made some substitutions, 1 cup of warm milk in place of the water and dry milk and olive oil in place of butter.  It came together beautifully.  I took about an hour for the first rise and by then I didn't get as much of a garlic smell, so I kneaded in 3 large cloves of minced, shaped my loaf, allowed to rise gain and baked at 375 for 35 minutes.  With the added garlic it was just right to please our tastes.

I loved it! The garlic wasn't as strong as I thought it was going to be, however, when toasted with butter melted on top the garlic flavor was phenomenal! My husband and I were discussing how delicious it would be as a hamburger roll or sliced with steak and cheese on top toasted. Yum!

This recipe was great. I did change some things though. I added 1/4 cup extra water with the milk powder to make the bread moist. I used olive oil instead of butter and added 5 cloves chopped garlic (I am a true garlic lover). I also used 3 teaspoons yeast to compensate for the heavy ingredients. I used the medium setting on the bread machine and the bread came out perfect! Moist and very flavorful! I will definatley make this again!

I did not care for this recipe. I make bread in my bread machine all the time, and it is always better than this. Maybe it needs more yeast? The bread was terribly dense and small and tough. Avoid.

This is a good bread recipe - has a good texture and basic flavor.  However, I was hoping for more garlic taste.  I used my bread machine on a 1 1/2 lb loaf and light white crust and it came out perfectly.  I will definately use again, but with more garlic.

Good recipe but needs more garlic. While the bread was cooking it had a nice garlic aroma but you couldn't taste it.  So, I'll have to add much more next time.  I like to "taste" my garlic in my bread.

Very yummy!! Did not look pretty - the middle fell in (machine was a Christmas present, so I'm new to this).  This didn't affect the taste at all, everyone loved it! I added extra garlic powder, as suggested below.  Will make again!!

Not too bad.  I expected it to rise a little more and be a bit larger, lighter loaf than it actually was.  Also, the crust was a little too "solid" for my liking.  Perhaps set on the light setting, it would have been a little better?

This bread had a lovely flavor and was excellent with my veggie spaghetti. I was a little confused when I took it out, as it had risen nicely but after baking it had fallen. It didn't affect the texture or flavor at all...honestly, it was a more manageable loaf, lol. I think next time I'll try the breadsticks like another person said they did. I also thought about making sandwich sized rolls out of this. Will definitely make it again, and with fresh basil!

It didn't rise in the bread machine.  Most people said the garlic taste wasn't strong enough, so I added a half tsp. but it was too strong.  It was also really crumbly and the crust was too flaky.  Will probably not make again.

Bread tastes good but not very 'garlicky'. I recommend 2 tablespoons of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of minced or fresh garlic. A tablespoon of olive oil is also good. This bread didn't rise very well but I think I added too much water because 1 cup didn't seem like enough.

I found that using the basic white bread recipe and adding 2 tbsp of garlic to it taste much better and holds a better garlic flavor to it! My kids seem to like this way a lot better!

I made this garlic bread.  I added a tsp more of fresh chopped garlic.  It was just great. My whole family loved it.  It was easy of course but really delicious!!!! I will be serving this for sure.

I read the reviews on this recipe and decided I do a few things other people did. Instead of butter I went with some good herb infused olive oil, Italian seasoning instead of parsley, 2 tablespoons of Parmesan Cheese, and 3 minced cloves of garlic. Now that's a garlic lover bread.

I made the recipe as written and found it too dry and crumbly. Will make again with oil in lieu of butter and try previous suggestions of fresh minced garlic versus powdered. I have high hopes but wasn't impressed as written.

So many reviewers thought this needed more garlic, but I served it with a very garlic-y spaghetti, so it was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Ive made this twice, both times I added an extra 1.5 teaspoons of garlic powder which gave it a nice but not overwhelming garlic flavor. The first time I followed the rest of the recipe. It was good but very dense! The second time I used 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup all purpose. I was much happier with it, still pretty heavy but the all purpose flour lightened it up just enough for my taste. Great to soak up red sauce or just dip in olive oil.

Mmmm. Turned out great. I confess I added some dried onion flakes, but otherwise stuck right with the recipe. The house smelled wonderful, inviting everyone to the table as they came home this evening. I served it with a plate of spaghetti with homemade pesto and a side salad. Perfect dinner. Thanks!

This wasn't exactly the garlic bread I was looking for, but it was still tasty.  In all fairness, I did make some changes based on other reviews.  First, I used 4 cloves of fresh garlic (finely chopped) rather than garlic powder.  It may be a bit much garlic if you're not a big fan, but my husband's motto is, "There's no such thing as too much garlic."  I also used about 1/4 cup of sweetened condensed milk in place of the milk powder.  Because it was sweetened, I left out the sugar.  I made the dough in the bread machine and let it rise for an hour, then baked for 40 minutes at 300 degrees and another 10 minutes at 350 (to help brown the crust).  I brushed the top with butter halfway through.  The timing turned out to be perfect, and the bread has a good flavor, but I'm a little disappointed with the texture.  I was expecting a crusty loaf, and while the crust was perfect, the texture inside was more spongy.  I also thought it needed a little more salt, although that may also be due to the sweetened condensed milk.  If you're looking for a moist soft bread, I think this is a good recipe.

This bread turned out really well, my boyfriend loved it.  I also made the dough in the bread machine and let it rise about 30 min after I removed it then brushed it with melted butter.  I then baked it for 40 min then I sliced it in half, brushed melted butter on inside of each half, sprinkled them with garlic powder and grated parmasean cheese then baked for 10 more min.

This bread is not bad.  I did add minced garlic plus the garlic powder.  The first time I made this I must've somehow mixed the salt and yeast because it didn't turn out right.  The second time, it turned out well.  However, it didn't rise as well as most of the loaves I make in my machine.  The loaf is a bit flat.  The garlic flavor is good, but I can easily modify other recipes to add garlic.  I liked it, but I've made other breads I liked better.

I made the adjustments that reviewer, "darkersolace" had made.  Instead of adding condensed milk in place of the powdered milk I accidentally put in 2% milk instead.  But you know, it was great.  Also with the added rosemary & oregano.  My boyfriend & I just loved it.  This I will definately make again with the made adjustments.

So I didn't have garlic powder but I did use a little bit of garlic salt, I used regular flour and also for the 1 1/2 tsp. of salt, I used 1 tsp regular salt and 1/2 tsp johnny's seasoning salt.  Also I put about 1/2 tsp of fresh rosemary in there too.  It came out great! Thanks for posting the recipe!

This bread was okay, it smelled good baking but it was lacking flavor when done.  I too added more garlic than recommended but it didn't seem to help.  I will try it the way someone suggested by taking the dough and baking it as sticks in the oven.

I added a lot more garlic and skipped the parsley all together.  I made this for Easter and everyone loved it (including my nephew who swears he hates garlic).  Later I used organio instead and it came out well too.

i must have done something wrong. Very wrong.  This had the weight and texture of a door stop, and i have been making bread for years.  Thank goodness i was making three other breads at the same time.  It was a great source of amusement for the others to tease me about, though.

I used olive oil instead of butter and used fresh minced garlic and fresh basil. I just got my bread machine for Christmas and am not sure what the problem is yet. It sank very badly once it started baking. It looked perfect while it was raising. I guess it is just going to take more practice. I had no idea that making bread was so complicated, kinda takes the fun out of it. Tasted ok though.

Didn't rise well at all.  Very disappointed.  I did use more garlic as was suggested, but I most likely will not make this bread again.

Like most of the reviews recommended, I added more fresh garlic.  Well that didn't help too much.  This is not a very tasty bread.  I think I will stick to the old standby of french bread topped with butter and minced garlic...now that's easy as well as tasty.

It was really good, but not very garlicky and I even added about 4 cloves of garlic to the recipe!  I will increase the garlic powder and the fresh garlic next time.

Overall, this was good, but it could have been  better.  I used 2 tablespoons of garlic, not 2 teaspoons, and it still wasn't very garlic-y.  Also, it was quite dry -- if I try it again, I'll probably at least double the amount of water used.  

I used my bread machine to knead the dough, and then shaped it into rolls which I baked the in oven.  Aside from the drawbacks I've already mentioned, they were quite good!

I felt like the bread was good, but a bit salty.  Definitely feel the need to add more garlic to the recipe tho'!
