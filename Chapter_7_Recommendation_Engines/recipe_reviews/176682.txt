With a slight modification I made chicken guacamole muffins that are AMAZING!  I poached and shredded 3 split chicken breasts instead of pan-frying.  I then scooped the chicken into a lightly greased muffin tin, covering with guac mix + cheese and broiled for 3 min.  I haven't tried yet, but suspect this will also make amazing chicken nachos.   Overall this significantly reduces calories by removing butter + olive oil (340 cal) and increasing the portion yield to 6.  Enjoy!

This was so easy and so delicious! I loved it, my family loved it! I didn't know what to think about putting guacamole on top of chicken, but then couldn't believe the wonderful flavor it added. I will be making this again and again!

This was easy to prepare and turned out great. Hubby thought it was very tasty. I reduced the butter and oil which worked out fine.Otherwise, I made no changes to the recipe.

I try to avoid butter and frying, so I marinated the chicken breasts in olive oil and fresh garlic for a couple of hours and then grilled them on the BBQ. Sansel Red Garlic from Epicure is a great addition to the guacamole instead of just garlic powder. (Most stores have a similar version if you don’t have Epicure.) I left the guacamole chunky. Did everything else as indicated. Turned out picture perfect and delicious.

Pretty good. The quality of the guacamole matters to this dish! I made my own guacamole and substituted the pepper jack cheese to a "Mexican" blend shredded cheese.

This was an excellent recipe.  I made this exactly as the recipe stated and wouldn't change a thing!  My daughter doesn't like pepperjack cheese, so I melted hers with provolone and it was excellent that way too.  We had a little guac. left over and it was great with chips.  Very simple to make and a different way to prepare chicken.  We thoroughly enjoyed this!

This was delicious! I made a few changes: I sprinkled the chicken with taco seasoning and baked it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. I then topped it with the guacamole (I added some jalapeno juice to this mixture) and baked it for 7 more minutes. I loved it!!

This was delicious! I was able to reduce the calories down to 300 a serving by taking the 3 chicken breasts, I had, and cutting them in half and flattening them slightly with a knife. The smaller size helps them cook quicker anyhow, 5 minutes sauté per side. I also used a half slice of cheese on each, since they were a little smaller. For the creole seasoning, I used a recipe on Allrecipes which I made 1 serving of just for this. Clean-up was easy too. I lined a large baking sheet with foil and sprayed with PAM. Took only about 2 minutes to broil. Quick, tasty, and easy. Ty, will make again.
**Note - This does not re-heat well with the avocado on top. It is best fresh. So, I would just make enough for dinner or keep the avocado separate for lunches**

I will make this again but next time I will follow what others suggested and bake it in the oven instead of pan frying.The taste was a welcome change and I loved it with the pepperjack cheese. For the kids I used chedder because it was what I had on hand but next time I will probably use provolone. I made my guacamole simple with just avacados, garlic salt and pepper.

I found this recipe by entering the ingredients in the search function. I can't cook with salt or butter, so I boiled the chicken breasts until done, sliced them in half long-wise, seasoned with some garlic powder and broiled with the guacamole and very thin-sliced pepperjack strips. I served with roasted, fresh beets (recipe also from this site) and it made a really tasty and pretty plate! I will definitely make this again.

This was great!  I did use prepared salsa(with added garlic powder) mixed with the avacado because it was easier.  Definately a winner, thanks for sharing!

I didn't like this much but I'll give it 4 stars in case it was my fault....it was possibly because I left the cheese off (have a cheese hater in the house)?  In any case I love guacamole but wasn't too keen on this.

made this for my lunch so i changed the cooking directions just a little bit. i used leftover chicken from another recipe from this site. i made the guacamole per the recipe but added the creole seasoning to it. i placed the chicken in a container and topped it with the guacamole and topped that with sliced cheese. i microwaved this until heated through and put it on some bread. great lunch!

Unexpected flavor combinations, but turned out really good.  We also had some leftover quac, which was delish with tortilla chips.  The cajun seasoning added flavor, but not much heat.  If we make again, I'd add more spice.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was quick and easy, and the chicken looked fantastic when it was done.  I added a shot of chipotle Tabasco sauce to each chicken breast before spooning the guacamole on.

I  baked the chicken breasts (cut 2 large breasts into 4 thinner pieces) at 350 for 30 minutes.  I topped each piece with guacamole and mexican cheese then broiled it until the cheese melted.  I served it with black beans, corn, and salsa.  Yummy!

This dish was great and relatively easy to make!  I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes.  But  I would suggest to closely watch the chicken to be sure it gets cooked thoroughly.  I used thinner cut chicken breasts which worked well.  Also, monitor  the chicken under the broiler to be sure the cheese does not melt too much. Good dish for avocado lovers!

I thought this sounded VERY strange, but I had chicken and avocados to use up so I made it!!  So glad I did.  So easy and very tasty.  I served it on a bed of Mexican rice that was left over from last night's taco dinner.  Added a garnish of chopped black olives and green onions and finished with a dollop of sour cream. YUM!

instead of making full on guacamole I cut the avacodo into small peices mixed it in a bowl with onion and seasonings, put sliced chicken and avacodo mis on a sub roll topped with pepper jack cheese and broiled until the cheese melted and bread toasted.

This was okay but not something I will ever make again. I really felt it didn't have much flavor and the tastes just didn't mesh. I'm giving it 3 stars because my boyfriend liked it and it was pretty simple. Thanks for the recipe anyways.

My family really liked this dish.  I did use grated cheddar and only olive oil.  I also used Toy Chachere's seasoning, so the dish was very salty.

quick and easy, I used spray oil and covered the chicken after browning on both sides. Kept it moist and reduced the need for more oil/butter.

I made this as the recipe stated except I grilled my chicken on the BBQ. It sounds a bit strange on paper but tasted fantastic, both me and my hubby loved how fresh tasting the guacamole was. Will definitely make this again!

This was just OK for me. My son the guacamole freak loved it. Just lacked something to me— texture and more flavor, maybe.

Very tasty when doubled and paired with Spanish rice. Added cilantro, real garlic with more lime juice which added nice kick.

Easy and delicious!  I left out the butter, but other than that made it the same.  The lime juice gives it a nice kick.  My boyfriend said it was outstanding.

This was delicious!  Just made it tonight, but didn't have any creole seasoning or pepper jack cheese, so used southwest chipotle seasoning and monterey jack cheese...still tasted awesome!  My husband really liked it and told me to make it again sometime soon.  :)  In my recipe box now.

Excellent recipe!!! Very easy to make, just take your time cooking the chicken so you dont burn the skin. A little Chipotle seasoning adds a nice touch...

This as easy and very good. I was making it for someone who likes spicy food so it was easily modified to make spicier by having half the chicken with additional peppers. I will make it again, I have recommended it to friends.

This was really yummy! I didn't have a few of the ingredients on hand, such as the Creole-type seasoning. I just cooked the chicken in olive oil and sprinkled some sea salt on it. I really liked how the guacamole adds a creamy texture to the meal! I also didn't have any cheese and ate it with out, and it was still very tasty. A great quick meal.

This is an amazing dish that is not only delicious, but so easy and quick to make. I serve it with a nutty barley bake...so healthy! I made my own guacamole a few hours earlier. The chicken is so moist!

I loved the recipe, but I made some changes to enhance the heat and flavor. I added Hatch Valley Southwestern 505 Flame Roasted Green Chile to taste. I used Kroger Mexican Style Blend (4 cheeses) Shredded Cheese to top the guacamole and broiled it to perfection. My wife loved it and she's Italian. She is a green chilie and guacamole fan. So that's why we ate the whole three big chicken breast recipe ourselves!

Delicious concept, I didn’t follow the recipe exactly. Basically used the idea, made the chicken and melted the cheese in the air fryer. Cooked the bacon in the oven and left the guacamole to put on last before serving because I didn’t want it hot.

I stuffed the chicken thighs with salsa, baked it at 425 for 10mins.  Topped it with the guacamole and cheese and baked for another 10, then high broil for 2 to 3mins.   
Aaaamazing

This was easy to prepare, a healthy snack or side dish and it tastes great. Make sure your avacado shell is not soft or the product will not hold up.

Substituted my own guac recipe and grilled the chicken on the Weber, but this was really great! First time I made it and was asked if I’d made it before because it was so good. It was requested to be made again!

This is a great quick & easy week night meal. My whole family likes it- even the kid who doesn’t like avocados. I made it even simpler by using pre-made guacamole from the grocery store.

This was soooo good!! This dish is only as good as your guacamole. I prefer my gauc with sour cream and cream cheese. I used the recipe from this site "Easy Never Forgotten Guacamole", but added lime juice, chopped onions, cumin, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, substituted white pepper for black. The salsa in the guacamole came from this site, "The Best Fresh Tomato Salsa", just add minced garlic. Put your salsa in the fridge for 4 hours to let the flavors marry. Then add it to the guacamole. Yum! I will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious and rich!  We grilled the chicken, adding the cheese after turning the breasts.  So the guacamole went on top.

I didn't use butter, I used coconut oil to cook the chicken in, instead of Creole seasoning I used a garlic jalapeno sea salt mix and I had some Pico de Gallo that had to be eaten so I mixed that with the avocado.  Will definitely make again.

The combination is just delicious! I used raw garlic for the guacamole but other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written. I made some coconut milk black bean rice as a side.

I used chicken thighs instead and browned them in the IP on saute mode then pressure cooked them. Finished them in the toaster oven under the broiler. The wife who is on a low carb diet just went nuts over them. This will be added to my favorites.

I love this! This is my second time making them. I changed it up a bit by making my own lime & jalapeno marinade and marinating my chicken breast in it overnight. I also halved chicken breast as it was a lot of meat to guacamole ratio that didn't match up quite well. Fabulous recipe!

This dish was amazing. My chicken breasts were huge so I cut them in half, then sliced each piece in half. They looked good and also looked beautiful when plated.  Cut up the leftovers, rolled in tortilla shells, heated in microwave and served for dinner the next night.

Made a few changes...used provolone cheese, white onion vs. red and didn't use the butter to keep the fat down a little.  Still turned out amazing!  The two avocados make a lot of guac...always good to have extra, but if want to cut fat down more...could use 1-1/2.  I will definitely make this again.

Great  recipe, I used shredded Mexican blend cheese because I had no pepper jack. I drizzled some Sriracha over the cheese to give it a little kick before I put it in the oven. I also put some sour cream on top before serving. Fantastic!

I don't know if the cheese I used made a big difference(I used cheddar) but I did;nt care much for this recipe. Lacked flavor and could hardly taste the avacado even tho' I used more than called for. Doubt I would make it again.

We really liked the cheese and guacamole, but the chicken was kind of bland.  The meat was moist and tender, but I won't follow these directions for cooking chicken in the future. I'll just add cheese and guacamole to more flavorful meat.

Loved this! Didn't have creole seasoning so used Taco seasoning instead. Chopped the chicken into chunks for the kids. Added sour cream to the guacomole, juice from one lemon, extra salt and a few cloves of garlic   and this was perfect.  Whole family ate it for lunch and the leftovers for dinner. Will be making again!

My husband and I thought this was really good.  My kids did not like it though.  Not surprisingly not good leftover (because of the guacamole).

Love this one. The only thing I did differently is marinated the chicken in balsamic vinegarette for extra flavor and I used thin cutlets as opposed to breasts. Very flavorful!
