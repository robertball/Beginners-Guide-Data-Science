Interesting.  I was looking for a recipe that would use some veggies I had on hand.  I used 2 potatoes, but everything else the same.  I'm not sure if it was the extra potato or a particularly juicy zucchini, but this never did get 'crispy'.  After about 15 minutes, it was finally starting to dry around the edges, but definitely never approached the hash brown crispiness I was expecting.  Nevertheless, an interesting taste and I might spin it off in to other vegetables when I'm scouring the pantry.
