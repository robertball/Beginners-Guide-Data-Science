I made this dish last night. I do not know what they mean about the cooking aroma, it smelled delicious. I made it without changing the ingredients, just doubled the recipe.   My husband and I thought the experience was delicious. He said that whenever I make salmon, he'd like it this way. The smell and taste were perfect. I served it with a side dish of 1/2 chayote filled with a mound of mixed vegetables each.   I did marinate the salmon in the sauce for a couple of hours in the icebox. It was delicious.   Thank you to whomever came up with the recipe. Yummo!

Very good. Works better if the salmon finishes baking in the glaze (2-3 minutes)

I didn't want to stop at the store on my way home, so I improvised with what I had on hand and this actually turned out great.

I never measure anything unless I'm baking so I can't say what the quantities were, but I used probably a little more than a cup of chicken broth, around 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, and a couple tablespoons of orange marmalade (no need for the sugar then).  It was a little bland though, and I began perusing my spice cabinet for something to perk it up.  The ingredient that made all the difference:  powdered ginger.  Again, I don't know how much, but I suppose it's all a matter of what tastes good to you, isn't it?  I added the ginger by little bits until the flavour really popped and then figured I would just let it simmer to get to a syrupy consistency, rather than killing it with cornstarch, and that worked out just fine.  I think cornstarch would have deadened the flavour, especially at the quantity recommended.

We really like sauces, and there are only two of us, so this made enough that we could use it on something else later.  It was delicious on the salmon, which we brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with a little sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper, and also on the roasted rosemary potatoes it drifted over to.

With a minor adjustment. Orange juice & balsamic? Not for me.  I searched my fridge & found a jar of fig jam.  2 spoonfuls - perfect.  Hubby (who does not like salmon) wanted some soy.  Otherwise, easy & very tasty.  A great recipe to play with.

I didn't really care for this. I love the flavor of balsamic and thought it would go nicely with salmon, but I think the orange and the brown sugar made it taste a little off. It was still good, but definitely not great.

It was just ok.  The sauce was not exactly right for the fish, but it turned out looking pretty and 1 of the 3 people I served it to really liked it, two of us thought it was just "meh."  If I'm going to pay the extra money for fresh salmon, I'd like the recipe to really sing!

Well, I don't see what is so great about this.  It made WAY too much and barely had any flavor.  I'm thinking the 1 3/4 cups broth needed to be maybe 3/4 cup.  It didn't ruin the fish but what was the point in such a mild flavor?  Won't bother with again.  Waste of $10 worth of salmon that could have been better.

This was a very nice flavor to use with salmon.  I made the sauce ahead of time and used it as a marinade.  I then baked the salmon in the marinade, but it needed an extra ten minutes.  I served it without the sauce, and with broccoli and risotto.  It was very flavorful yet light.

I thought this recipe was just ok.  I wished  the sauce had a stronger taster. It did go really good on a salad. If I were to do it again I might not put so much broth and more balsamic vinegar.

Good but I used dried orange zest so it may have been better with fresh.  My husband really enjoyed it.

This recipe was a good way to waste salmon and money, it has no flavor at all.  Very disappointed.

Very delicious recipe.  I did place some of the glaze on top of the salmon and broiled it for about 2 minutes to create a nice crust.  I will definitely eat this again!

This was pretty good. A couple of things I found. You're going to want to be careful with how much olive oil you use while baking the salmon, because that will make it difficult for the sauce to stay on it. If you use a lot maybe the thing to do would be to quickly pat off the extra oil. Second, I found it a little less flavorful than I was expecting. Maybe bump up the orange a little, and be sure to really let the sauce reduce until it's quite concentrated. Finally, I think it might help if you put the sauce on the salmon and then popped it under the broiler quickly, to form a bit of a crust.
