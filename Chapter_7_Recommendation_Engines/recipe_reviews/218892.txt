I loved this rich and very decadent cheesecake recipe. I followed the directions to a T, except...(and there's always an except), I didn't do the water bath. I ended up just putting it in the oven for 45 minutes with the foil lined pan and then as soon as the timer went off, checked for the right amount of jiggle and left it in the oven with the door ajar for about another 40 minutes before I took it out. It was perfect, no cracks and perfectly done. The sour cream ganache was very rich, but just perfect for this sweet indulgence.

Made this cheesecake following the recipe exactly.  In between bites, guests managed to declare this the BEST they've ever had. Well done, Karen! Thanks for sharing.

I followed the directions, including wrapping the pan in foil and putting it in a roasting pan with an inch of water. The cheesecake turned out perfectly, no cracking, and was creamy. I found the topping sweet, but delicious, I think this cheesecake would be great with or without the topping. I served it with fresh strawberries. Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!

Awesome.  The only thing wrong was it could have used more crust.  This is a keeper.

This had wonderful flavor especially the sour cream frosting. I did not add any additional sugar to the frosting. I also did not frost the entire cake. Used the frosting as a swirl decoration so you could see the swirls in the cake. This is the first water bath cheesecake I have made. I thought the texture was a bit dry. I will try it again though as everyone loved it.

My boyfriend made this recipe for the first time and it was Amazing. It was his first time baking a dessert. Follow the directions and you can't go wrong. The frosting was so good  I would keep it in the refrigerator for at least 5 hours before serving. It is great the next day. ??

The frosting is actually not that sweet. If you tried the frosting by itself you would think it is not sweet enough.  The frosting needs the cheesecake for its sweetness.  The cheesecake and the frosting together are a perfect match.

The foil on the spring form pan is just to keep the water from the bath from seeping into the pan. You will definitely see a difference in the cheesecake texture if you use the bath.  It will be moist and have a creamier texture.  It is worth doing.

This was excellent.  I also didn't bother with the bath just wrapped with foil and it was plenty moist.   I skipped the topping because my husband doesn't like things too sweet and I was baking it for our Anniversary so I really wanted him to like it.  I will try it next time with the frosting for me and the kids!

My cheesecake turned out a bit thin but the flavor and texture was great! The cake was gone in seconds!
