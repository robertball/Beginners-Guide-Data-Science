Great recipe!  Living in Roch. NY, been looking for this recipe for decades as non of the chefs in the restaurants here which serve this dish ever wanted to share this secret recipe!  Here are the small changes I've made, after frying the artichokes in oil for 4 min. I turned them over & fried for another 2 min. added the rest of the ingredients to the same pan, without pouring out the oil and adding more butter (as for not using butter for health reasons)!  Next time I will add fresh chopped garlic at the last min. of frying as that is how it is served here in Roch.  I must say the leftovers are even better the next day!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.....!

I htink it needs chicken stock! Everyone thinks that it is only sherry, I actually got in an argument with someone who then spoke with the chef at a local Italian restaurant here in Rochester who confirmed that there is indeed chicken stock along with the sherry! It's like 2:1 ratio of sherry to stock. Adjust accordingly to your taste! Also, add a tad of garlic powder to the flour. Adds more flavor!

I made it a little more tart by using 2 fresh lemons. I also used white wine instead of sherry. We like it tart and very few chefs make it that way. It was awesome!

Simple and delicious recipe. The only change we made was using white wine instead of sherry. It was a tad lemony, so we'll probably use just half a lemon next time, otherwise it was excellent.

I am from Rochester and love, love Artichokes French. We French everything up here, chicken, Haddock, veal, you name it. :) It’s delicious and I thought why not try to make it at home. Followed recipe except I left my artichokes whole and doubled the about using 2 cans whole artichokes drained. They are served whole in the places I order them here, halve them if you like. You do not need to measure flour and you are just dredging the artichokes to coat them. Same with the egg. I used 2 eggs for 2 cans of artichokes and it was just enough. I sautéed them in a butter olive oil mix rather than vegetable oil. Vegetable oil would probably have been fine, but I love the butter olive oil combo. Bottled lemon juice is fine, but if you have fresh lemons, great. I like mine more lemony than my husband, so add to your desired taste. This varies greatly at restaurants too. You can serve with a lemon wedge so if you like more, add it at the table. I didn’t have Sherry so I subbed sweet vermouth. I will try Sherry next time. I love it in other dishes. You will want to use, as the poster suggested, either a sherry, sweet vermouth, or a Sauterne (sweet white wine). I added salt and pepper at the table. Use must try this!!! Sautéed egg/flour coated artichokes served with a buttery, lemon wine sauce. Seriously, hard to improve on that combo of flavors. 
Play around with the amount of lemon, and type of sherry or wine you use. If you must share this gem, I suggest doubling, as it is that good!

I thought this was perfect. I like things on the lemony side and this was exactly what I was looking for.
