I did not have canned carrots, I used baby carrots that I steamed until slightly tender. This was good but quite sweet. I'd make this again but cut the brown sugar back by half.

It was a great idea and it was easy, but it wasn't very tasty. Overly sweet with the marmalade etc...

I thought they would taste better than this carrot recipe .  carrots turned into mush.  My husband did not like this at all.  Don't think I will try this one again

Easy enough for my 8 year old to make while I was cooking dinner. She loved it and so did her brother and sister. We cut back on marmalade based on other reviews.

Yum! We love glazed carrots. I didn't use canned carrots, instead I sliced and steamed my carrots then continued on with the recipe.
