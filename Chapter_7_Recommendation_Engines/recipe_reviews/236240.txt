We like our food spicy, but I think this would have been better with only half of the chile paste. The heat and flavor of the paste really drowned out the other flavors. Still, pretty good and easy to make - the hardest part was finding the ingredients in the grocery store!

This was just delicious. I loved the gochujang based chicken concoction and didn't need to use salsa. Also you can vary your burrito by adding different ingredients! Lettuce, sprouts, carrot, whatever you like!

I loved these!  I used partially frozen boneless chicken breasts in place of the canned chicken.  When the chicken is partially frozen it's very easy to slice very thin strips.  I cooked the chicken with the sauce for about 10 minutes in a non-stick skillet.  I used Udi's gluten free tortillas, white cheese instead of cheddar and skipped the salsa.  It was just the right amount of spice with the Gochujang.  I will be making these often!

I am usually hesitant to try recipes without many reviews, but this one just sounded too good. I halved the amount of gochujang and it was amazing. Super easy, too! I have already made these three or four times in the past year.
