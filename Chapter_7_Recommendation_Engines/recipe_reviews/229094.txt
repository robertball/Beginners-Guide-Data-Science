There are very few meals that both my girls will eat, they both gave this five stars!!!  I used only peas (and a few too many) because my kids don't like carrots.  I found it to be a little bland but will not change the recipe cuz they love it!  Dinner ready in under an hour and they loved to eat it with their hands!  This is my first review and I had to leave it cuz it was such a hit.  I also make a breakfast muffin like this with eggs, bacon and cheese!  Try that one too!

Awesome and easy. My whole family loved them and it is a twist on chicken pot pie, which I love but my family does not eat so I am holding onto this one. My only suggestion is watch the salt content.

Delicious!  I used 2 cups of leftover smoked turkey and 1 can of vegetables instead of the chicken and frozen vegetables because it was what I had on hand and it was amazing. Both my 2 year old and 15 month old loved it and they can be pretty picky!!! Great recipe!!!

Made these for my sister for dinner when she babysat my daughter. We of course had leftovers for a midnight snack and then lunch the next day. So yummy and easy to eat while chasing around a walking 9 month old!

These were really good. I followed the recipe exactly. They slid right out of the pan, stay in tact, were warm throughout, and everything was cooked completely. Oh, I lied- I did season the chicken breast with salt and pepper before cooking! That is the only change I made though! They taste just like chicken pot pie!

these came out sooo good. i used pillsbury grands homestyle buttermilk. plus a little extra cheese.  i also used canned veggies.  i had to let cool quite a bit to get them out of the pan and i would like to have used a bit more dough for each.

I used some cooked chicken which I had on hand, and I added 1/4 cup chopped scallions and 1/4 cup finely diced sweet pepper for color.  Next time I will add a bit more spice - like dill, sage, or rosemary - for additional flavor.

I followed the recipe as written and thought it was bland. My teens love chicken pot pie but they were ambivalent about this recipe. I probably wonâ€™t make it again although it is a very clever way to make pot pie. One tip: I used an ice-cream type scoop to fill the muffins and it worked very well.

I made this but took a few suggestions mentioned in the reviews. First I heated up the chicken with chopped onions and garlic to add a bit of flavor.  I added some various spice blends and mixed in the cream of chicken along with some milk to make it more creamy and not as thick.  Everything else was done the same and the family loved it!

Definitely needs a higher baking temp and longer bake time.  Was yummy!  I'm gonna check out how they freeze and reheat because this looks like a good candidate for that.  I used my own chicken stew using chicken stock thickened rather than using the canned soup just Cuz it so happened I had made it and had some leftovers.

I made this recipe because of the good reviews in regards to kids liking this dish and the fact that I needed something simple and quick for dinner.  None of my kids liked it and neither did my husband or myself.  I only had frozen peas and it might have been better with mixed veggies, but I don't think it would have improved this recipe much.  It is one of those recipes that as you eat it, your palette tastes each ingredient separately.  I was able to eat a few, only because I was hungry and didn't want to make something else for myself.  My kids on the other hand ate peanut butter sandwiches.  I can see why this would be a hit with very young children.  The novelty of holding it in your hand is kinda neat, and the dish is not spicy.  This is not something that I would suggest making for a party of adults however.  It literally tastes like you combined a few ingredients to make this dish, and any adult would be able to taste that.

Great recipe that the kids can help "build". Only thing I did differently was use fresh carrots and celery that I diced and softened in the same pan I cooked the chicken in. Just a personal preference to use fresh when I can squeeze it in.
