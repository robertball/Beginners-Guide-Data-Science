This is a great way to use green beans straight out of the garden!  I made a few changes- instead of diced tomatoes I used a pint of crushed tomatoes and 5 fresh minced basil leaves.  I added 1/4 cup chicken broth, 1/2 tsp cinnamon (my husband loves cinnamon in anything with a lot of tomatoes), and about a tablespoon of fresh-squeezed orange juice when I added the green beans.  Everyone (picky children included) loved it!  Thanks for a great, versatile recipe!

We thought this was pretty darn good. I used canned crushed tomatoes with roasted garlic and took it up a level by adding cabbage and cannellini beans. If I hadn't already had a meatloaf in the oven, I would have served this over pasta. Thanks BarbiAnn!

Very good! I did throw the green beans in a few minutes (not 45 minutes later) after I added the tomatoes to the garlic/oil. They were delicious. I cooked the whole thing for about 45 minutes. Will make again!!

Yea Aunt Kate! We loved your green beans in tomatoes! I (like other reviewers) used canned green beans. I only used one can because I wasn't sure if my kids would eat it and I didn't want to waste perfectly good green beans. When they saw it in the pan they asked "whats the red stuff?". I told them it was like green beans in spaghetti sauce...they loved it! My 3 year old ate it and ate it and ate it. Thank you for an easy and delicious side dish!

I don't think this one will be a fan with little kida, but as groovigryl said, her kid liked it, so I still don't know. I guess some kids like green beans, but not many...!

I also don't LOVE green beans, but this recipe made me forget that.  I do love tomatoes and these were delish.  I only give it a 3 as hubby thought it was too tomatoey and did not like at all.

This recipe was very good. My roomate said her mother makes this all the time and mine was even better!  I added 1 tbsp of parsley flakes and a bit more basil. All I had was a 28 oz can of tomatoes. I added 1/2 cup water and let it cook down until it was less than half.  Next time I will use a regular 14 oz can, because it did turn out very tomatoey.

Very tasty ... the tomato sauce livens up the green beans, flavor-wise, and produces a really nice texture overall.  My 13-y.o. asked for seconds ... that's the real test!

I really enjoyed these, instead of using canned tomatoes, I used fresh diced roma tomatoes and then tomato paste and water in place of the tomato sauce. I also threw in some cauliflower, very yummy :)

For some reason I was thinking this would be more like a country vegetable, but it reminded me a little of Italian style green beans. It was similar in taste to the Italian style green beans in a can. I didn't have the oregano and basil canned diced tomatoes, so I just added a pinch of both seasonings to regular canned diced tomatoes. However, what surprised me about the recipe is, after the green beans are added, they have to simmer for well over an hour! The recipe does not indicate how long it typically takes for fresh green beans to soften. I was not aware of that. That is also on top of the 30-45 minutes to simmer the sauce first. That is a lot of time for a side dish that serves 4. I think it would have been better to just use frozen defrosted green beans. I don't think that would have affected the taste, but it maybe would have cut the cooking time in half.

This is a great way to prepare green beans!  I altered the ingredients slightly.  Instead of using diced tomatoes with herbs, I used plain canned diced tomatoes and added my own herbs.  I did change the preparation in that I did not cook my sauce first.  I threw everything together on the stove, stirred it occasionally, and it was ready when I was.

Nice change to same-old green beans, very tasty.  My three year old said he didn't like them, but then gobbled them up when we weren't looking.

My family loved this.  MY 10 yr old son hates green beans but loves tomatoes.  He loved this, asked for seconds.  Husband really enjoyed.  This is very good.  The longer you cook on low, the better this dish is.

I can't believe someone said it was too salty, more so since the recipe said salt to taste. Maybe they don’t know what salt to taste means, insert crazy face here. At any rate my only recommendations would be replace is, replace the vegetable with olive oil, and 1 tablespoon of oil with 1 tablespoon of butter to fry the garlic. Other than that it was very good.

These were outstanding. I had diced tomatoes but no tomato sauce, so when the dish inevitably got a bit dry while cooking, I added some red wine. That made it even more amazing. Highly recommended.

This rating is actually from my hubby, he raves about it every time I make it (I'm just not a fan of tomato sauce). I use frozen beans b/c fresh ones are hard to find here and microwave them until just defrosted before adding them in the sauce.

Very good stuff. Zesty, Tasty and Easy
The only thing that I might do differently would be to steam the green beans until they are about half way done as it takes a long time to get the green beans to a softer consistency.  Very good stuff!!!!!

This was fantastic! My first time ever eating green beans "in" something! I'm not much into leftovers and I'm not too creative  with food, but I had a lot of this left over. I turned it into soup the next day! I heated it up an hour or so  before dinner. I added a can of chicken broth and some pre-cut chicken strips, s & p, and my husband (who is a chef) thought it was great. Reminded him of minestrone with out all the veggies. I highly recommend this to all!!!!

This was delicious. I really enjoyed this dish for the 4th. Everyone loved the fresh taste. I agree with another person who said to wait just a few minutes, not 30, before adding the green beans.

This was a great way to eat green beans.  The sauce was delicious and they went great with egg noodles (with butter, cheese and garlic salt on them).

It tasted like I heated up a couple of cans of vegetables.  Oh yeah, I did.  Although it's simple with is sometimes nice, I think recipes should involve a bit more than this one did.

This was fabulous!!!  I took the advice of others and threw in the green beans at the beginning and let them simmer along with the sauce.  I will definitely make these again.  Simple and good!!!

This was really easy and very good!  I only put in about half the amount of beans and served it with rice to make a full vegetarian meal.  I also think the tomato sauce would be great with zucchini instead of green beans.

This was very good...although I accidentally put in too much pepper, the blend of green beans and tomatoes worked well. Very healthy, too!

Great recipe! Had some frozen green beans and stumbled across this. I made some tweaks for time by putting in the green beans earlier in the process (I make sauce a few times a year and just used that).  Great in a pinch and a healthier substitute for pasta, which I refuse to give up entirely.

This was easy to make and tasted fantastic,  we served it with roasted  greek chicken  and was a great pairing for that dish.   I added a teaspoon of sugar which was an ingredient from other green bean and tomato recipes.  This is a new favorite at our house and everyone who had it wanted the recipe.

Great green bean recipe! I added some green onions to it, no tomato sauce cause I didn't have it so I added a squirt of tomato paste. Didn't have  fresh basil or oregano, so added some dried. Added the green beans into the mix and let it all simmer.

What a nice change from regular green beans. The flavors blended very well together and everyone ate every single bite. I will be making this again.

I wanted to try something new with my fresh garden green beans.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and four cloves of garlic instead of two.  I also used fresh tomatoes and fresh basil.  These are so good and even better the next day.  Thanks for sharing your recipe BARBIANN

Very flavorful for so few ingredients. I never would have thought to cook my fresh green beans IN tomato sauce :) I drained a little of the juice out of my can of tomatoes, then (because I saw some of the herbs go down the drain with the juice!) added a dash of Italian seasoning. I just heated up the tomato mixture a bit before throwing the beans in there; they took longer to cook than I had thought so I'm glad I did. Love this recipe topped with a little fresh basil for kicks, thanks so much BARBIANN!

Yep, it tasted like beans in spaghetti sauce. I don't know why I thought it wouldn't but it did and we don't like it that way. Back to green bean casseroles.

Very tasty side dish.  I used 5 fresh garden tomatoes instead of the canned,  some fresh basil and about 1 tsp of oregano.  Turned out wonderful!!  Thank you for posting a great way to use fresh green beans.

Hmm. Maybe try again. Tried without green beans,and was heavily tomato-ish. Used leftovers as part of spaghetti sauce. Was okay that way.

I liked it quite a bit and I had forgotten garlic. My husband found it too tomatoey though. Pretty Good overall.

This recipe was different.  But, I went ahead and tried it because I wanted to do something different with green beans than usual.  It was ok.  The sauce was too thick for me, but I think i will try it again and use a bit more water as someone else suggested.
