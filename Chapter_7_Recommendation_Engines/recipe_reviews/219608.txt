Did add about twice the sugar after starting with the original suggested amount.. after cooking down was still bitter.  Would recommend keeping bigger chunks of pears and apples as ours were too small to really be noticed.  Was quick and easy, will do again but with those modifications.

This recipe doesn't make sense.  How can you simmer when there is almost no liquid?  It is a saucepan full of fruit with a splash of water in the bottom.

I added more sugar, and some water so it could boil. I cut the fruit into bite size pieces as the recipe called for but I would cut smaller.
