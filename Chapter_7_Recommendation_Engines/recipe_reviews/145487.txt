I give this 5 stars but was considering 4 stars because as other reviewers wrote, it needs a lot more broth  to make it a soup. I used three cans of broth instead of one.  I also used three large Italian sausage links, removed from their casings because that's what I had on hand.  I added 1 teaspoon each oregano and basil, and a dash of crushed red pepper at the end, and this was really, really tasty!  Great for a cold winter's night!

Would have been five stars if there was even a meager attempt at making this recipe healthy...

Pros: REALLY easy to make; versatile; difficult to mess up.

Cons: Check out the nutritional values - I think we can all figure out where the fatty culprit is in this recipe. I ditched the Bob Evans sausage roll and used chorizo instead. Chicken and turkey sausage means WAY less fat and fewer calories - and it made the soup nice and spicy as well! Everything else was pretty much by the book, although I needed to add way more than 14.5 oz of beef broth to make it soupy and not stewy.

This will definitely be a staple of mine, although I will be tinkering with the recipe to make it healthier (more fresh veggies instead of canned, beef broth substitutes to cut out some sodium - 77%??? Blech!). As is, though (minus the gross sausage roll), it's an easy soup to have on hand for emergency "oh no! I have nothing to cook with!" evenings.

This soup is very tasty & not hard at all. Very thick - does fine with half the macaroni, or a little more broth.

I had to add so many more things to make this to even taste what I would call flavor.  I think I will try my own Mom's recipe and call it good.  Sorry!

I used Aidells Sundried tomato sausage it added some really good flavor! just 1/4 each sausage... we don't like regular sausage in it but love the recipe. I also used great northern beans and white kidney beans for the different texture and it brought addition flavor.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it deserved 3 as is and 5 when i got done with it. This is what i did. I did not use Bob Evens Italian Sausage i used a generic brand, I substituted the white beans for kidney beans, i added one can of chicken broth, i doubled the amount of pasta,i added a can of tomato sauce, 2 dashes of Italian seasoning, and a pinch of chili pepper flakes. Now i didn't eat this myself, ( I'm a vegetarian ) but everyone i served it to absolutely loved it!

Very yummy with these modifications: You may want to use Ital. flavored ground turkey instead of the sausage to reduce fat. Also, used 3 cans chicken broth instead of the beef broth. Added 2 cloves garlic with the onion & 2 tsp. dried basil & 1/2 tsp. dried oregano with the other ingredients. Upped the pasta to 3/4 c. Hubby said it was his favorite soup I'd made for him!

YUM!  Loved this soup the very first time.  I'm one who always tries the recipe exactly the way it's written the first time and then I make any changes the next time I make it.  This was good right out of the chute!!  I sprinkled grated American Grana Parmesan on top before serving!

This was great! The whole family loved it. I used Beef Consomme instead of regular beef broth and just added extra water. Also added minced garlic, omitted the zuccini and added french cut green beans. Spiced it up with a little crushed red pepper, basil and oregano. Awesome!

Very quick and simple to make. Since we don't eat pork, I substituted Italian turkey sausage. I'm giving this a 4 because I think it was lacking some flavor. When I make this again, I will use basil and oregano to season it up.

It is a great recipe.  I made it with spicy sausage and instead of usting white beans I used black beans.  I also fried the pasta with  tbsp of oil to give it a little bit more of texture.  It was my first minestrone and it turned out great.

delicous! i used spicey italian sausage and it was great! it was like warming your body. the only thing is that it is very chucky so add more broth if you like things soupy. you could even turn it into a chili if u wanted simply by reducing!

This dish was pretty easy to prepare. I was, however, (not being an experienced cook) confused about whether or not I should boil the noodles before I put them in with everything else. I didn't because it doesn't say to, and it came out just fine, it just took a little longer to get soft. But it tasted great at the end and I got to add in anything else in my spice collection that I thought might taste good! It's fun to experiment :)

I love this recipe.  It is quick, easy and delicious.  I use turkey hot Italian sausage to make it lighter. I add some black pepper and Italian seasoning to taste.   Its a crowd pleaser and has great flavor.    It requires more broth upon reheating.

Very flavorful.  I made some changes that were pretty much just easier.  I had about double the white beans leftover from a previous recipe so put that in (made from dried, as I don't use canned beans).  I used vegetable broth rather than beef because I have some good veg broth starter.  Cooked up the sausage a bit earlier so that it could sit on paper towels for awhile and get as much fat wicked out prior.  Also, since I was getting canned tomatoes anyways, I got the italian flavored kind.  Parents and kids alike enjoyed this meal.  I will make again.

I think this is a great recipe.  Try adding a grated carrot for an extra veggie.  I also like to add minced garlic and a bit of basil.  Very tasty and something the whole family will enjoy!

This is a very tasty soup, but I do agree with the many other that you do need more stock.  I like a "chunky" soup, but this was just way too little liquid even with adding in liquid from the tomatos.  I would add 3-4 times the amount of stock.  I didn't have zuchini the first time I made this and used italian cut green beans instead.  I loved it this way.  I also have made it with regular italian sausage and turkey italian sausage and the turkey is just as good, imo.

This was delicious!  I had to add a little extra beef broth, so next time I will be sure to buy an extra can.  I also forgot to buy the zucchini, that would have made it even better.  I am happy that I made this, though!
