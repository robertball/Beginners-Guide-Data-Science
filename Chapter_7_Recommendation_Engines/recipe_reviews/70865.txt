This was OK, but we thought it needed more seasonings.  I just cooked the pork whole in my slow cooker all day until it shredded itself.  I cooked it in chicken broth.  I will try this again with more seasonings such as Fiesta Fajita, add some green chili peppers and fry the shells without the meat in them because the first one I did as written and the pork mixture got oil in it.

I thought this was pretty good.  I used leftover pork  roast, flour tortillas, and added salsa.

This was fabulous. I did use flour tortillas instead of corn because that is what I had on hand (and did not fold in half but fried flat like a quesadilla) and did add about 1 tablespoon of dry taco seasoning. The whole family loved it. I was looking for a great way to use up leftover pork roast as it always seems to get thrown out, and this is now where all of our leftover port roast will go. Very delicious!! Will definitely be making again as everyone is already asking when we can have them next. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I recently ate a pork chalupa at a local restaurant and enjoyed it so much so I was very anxious to try this recipe.  I started with a leftover boneless pork chop that I sliced thin and sauteed with onion.  Added some oregano, garlic, and a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar.  I layered the meat mixture on a corn tortilla, added cheese and made a quesadilla.  EXCELLENT way to give leftover pork a completely new flavor.

My family enjoyed these pork tacos.  It was time consuming to shred the pork, but worth the effort. The only change that I made was to add some taco seasoning to the pork for additional flavor.

I used leftover roast and different ingredients, but this was great. Thanks for a great way to re-create leftovers.

I love this recipe!!!  I have been making it for a couple of years now and I am surprised no one else has rated it.  The thing that makes it so yummy is to me is adding the chedder chesse in with the meat while it is still slightly warm.  It blends so nicely with the meat and you can throw it right into the tortilla.  Be careful that your meat is not too hot; otherwise, you get little balls of cheese in with your pork.

This is a great recipe.  I had guest stop by with their kids. Right after school. Starving kids!   I had just made a big pork chop dinner last night and had 2 left over.  This recipe allowed me to stretch 2 left over pork chops to feed 6 people.  Wow!  I added cilantro, lots of cheese and a bit of taco sauce. I topped them with rajas and sour cream. They loved them. This is a great idea and could be used with any left over meats.

Yuck! These were not good! Garlic and tacos are not a good mix. Also very bland!

I've made the original as written and it was fabulous.  Hence 5 stars.  And today I made a couple of changes that I will note, they might be useful to those that suggested too little flavor in the original.  I added cumin and taco seasoning, carmelized onions, a few diced tomatoes.  Served on a flour tortilla, just for a change.  Side of corn.  I also divided the recipe in 1/3 because I only had 1 lb of pork left and, it worked out. This original recipe is very forgiving and can be modified, yet another reason to give Mindy's Pork Tacos 5 stars.
