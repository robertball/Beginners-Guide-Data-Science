I think 3/4 cup of brown sugar is too much unless you like things really, really sweet.  I added half that amount, and it was still plenty sweet.  Eliminated the liquid smoke, since that's something we don't care for.  I cooked the bacon first, then added the onions to the bacon drippings, so essentially reversed steps 2 and 3 and eliminated a teaspoon of oil.  The recipe doesn't tell you when to add the bacon back in, so I added it along with the green beans at the end. Also, step #2 says to "...cook and stir BACON," think that should be "ONION" (sent a note to AR to see if this can be corrected).   These green beans are good, but I'd suggest that you start out with less sugar and then add more if you think you need it.  We all know that you can add more of an ingredient, but once it's in there, you can't take it out.  dfwenigma, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I replaced the cider vinegar for half garlic and half regular vinegar, didn't have smoke so I put BBQ; no pepper and less sugar also. Put some sweet corn to add color and it came out very tasty! Thank you for sharing!
