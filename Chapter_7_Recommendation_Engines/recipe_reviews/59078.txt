Delicious!  I used frozen mangos (from Trader Joe's), doubled the cilantro and added green onions.  I garnished with cherry tomatos.  It tasted even better the next day.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Quick to prepare and delicious;  and better the next day as others stated.  I made it first with mango, then a couple weeks later with some peaches that needed a use before they turned.  Both were very good, though mango adds a little more complexity with the "tropical" flavor.

Strange, but very good.  I used only white beans and did not have cilantro; would have been even better wtih the cilantro.  Makes a nice side to a spicy mexican meal; I served it with chicken tacos -- yum!

This was really tasty!  I used cannallini beans instead of navy beans.  And, for the onion, I used red onion.  My boyfriend doesn't usually like 'fruity' dishes, but he loved this!  Will definitely make again!

I made this for a group of women.  It was a big hit.  Many went back for second and third helpings.  I added some finely chopped celery and used a whole can of black beans and butter beans.  Made it earlier so the flavors would have time to blend.

This was a delicious, healthy, summery salad.  Just the sort of thing I was looking for.  The only modification I made was adding some salt and pepper.  Tastes better after being in the fridge for a day.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

5 stars for certain.  I added a bit of sea salt and a little extra dressing to mine. It was FABULOUS!

Fantastic! Although I misread the recipe and added plain Balsamic vinegar instead, and I love it. I have made this with peaches when I don't have mangoes on hand, and I have also used green onion. Tastes great with tortilla chips.

Simple and delicious! I used more cilantro because I love it and less than 1/4 cup Lite Balsamic Vinagrette because I'm on a diet!

This is absolutely wonderful - so fresh tasting!  The only thing I added was a tablespoon of Splenda.  The sweet/sour tastes combine beautifully, and everyone always asks for the recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is all right.  I added kiwi since I had some on hand and used red onion since that's all I had... but the bean-fruit combination doesn't work for me.  It's decent diet food, but I won't be making it again.

I doubled this recipe except the onion; made my own dressing with 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup canola oil and 2/3 cup rice vinegar... I added a little cumin to this along with the salt and pepper.  I only had 1 can black beans and 1 can canellini beans but would like to try it with chick-peas and black beans next time..So yummy and fresh tasting! :)

My husband and family really liked this salad.  I am not that crazy about it.  I'll probably make it again though and it could grow on me.  You just never know.

I am unfamiliar with navy beans (I know what they are; they're just not popular in CA).  So, I subbed cannelini.  So glad I did; the cannelini's smooth flavor contrast with the black bean's earthyness was fabulous.  Of course, mango was a sweet & lucious counterpoint.  By the way, I used dried beans in my slow cooker, not canned. So much more creamy and flavorful than canned, which is always a little "off", or salty. I usually have black beans around to sneak in a little protein/fiber here & there.  I had bought the cannelini to mix things up, but hadn't been inspired to cook/use them. Great fortune to come across this recipe.  Thanks allrecipes newsletter!

I didn't have the balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing on hand, so used balsamic vinegar with a bit of water to mellow it .  I also used fresh parsley rather than cilantro. This is a great salad and will be a favorite added to my collection.

serving it for the second time this week! I used the Balsamic Vinaigrette from this site. I doubled the salad and made 1/4 of the salad dressing, a beautiful blend. even better if it has time to sit before serving.

I did not have fresh cilantro; it was tasty none-the-less. I used green onion and I think I would prefer that to raw regular onion.

Great dish -- brought it to family picnic -- it got rave reviews.
