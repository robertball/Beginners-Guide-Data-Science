This recipe is a lighter version of candied walnuts. I think the boiling the nuts helped reduce the bitterness that walnuts sometimes own. This pleased my husband as walnuts are not his favorite nut, although I think that most any nutmeat could be used. A tasty, adult friendly treat. Thanks, Linda!
