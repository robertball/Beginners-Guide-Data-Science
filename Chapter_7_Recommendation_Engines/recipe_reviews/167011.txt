This was good—sweet, but not too sweet. I juiced the ginger with the carrots and apple. The texture is somewhat thick, like a runny milkshake. For me, it’s a bit rich for morning juice, so if I made it again, I’d add water from a young coconut to thin it out.

I just a juicer for xmas and this was the first recipe I tried with and my husband and I loved it!  We were a little wary about how veggies would taste being juiced and this is a great 'starter' recipe for those new to juicing!

Smooth, creamy and delicious!  I'll be making this again, probably adding even more ginger!

So Good - we usually make a drink like this without the coconut milk and it's one of our favorite juicing staples! The coconut milk made it over the top yummy.  Unfortunately today I couldn't find our fresh Ginger (go figure!), so I had to do without and it was still delicious.  Next time, I'll make sure to add it. BTW, I always juice my ginger with my other veggies/fruits too.

Very good. I like the addition of the coconut milk. I forgot to add my ginger. My kids didn't like it but I didn't expect them to.

What a great recipe! Thanks so much. I use my Vitamix (don't have a juicer) so I do get the fiber - which is fine by me. For the reviewer who thought that the "fat" spoiled a healthy drink, please bear in mind that many vitamins are fat soluble so we need some fat for a healthy brain and body. Everything in moderation. Thanks again for the delicious recipe!

I do not have a juicer so I just threw all he ingredients in at once into a blender.  I used vanilla soy milk since I do not have coconut milk, and it turned out wonderful!

Quite good, but we had to add a whole lemon to make it taste better.

I recommend making a double batch. I juiced everything and used tiny golden apples with extra coconut milk and only got about 4oz of juice.Very yummy flavor. I used a whole bulb of ginger. I might do 2 next time.

I have never used coconut milk before but wanted to try this. It was actually pretty good.

I found the flavour was wonderful but it was SOOOOO thick I ended up making it into soup and it was wonderful. Not sure what I did wrong but definitely not a morning drink.

I skipped the coconut milk and it was still good. I could not see adding fat to an otherwise healthy drink.

I haven't tried this, but it sounds great. Has anybody tried this in a Vitamix?
