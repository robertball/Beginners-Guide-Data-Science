Easy and very tasty! The only thing I'd change is add the sauce to the top of the burger and then melt the cheese to prevent soggy buns. Also works with jarred spaghetti sauce for a super quick lunch! Great creation, Emily! Thanks!

Made these for lunch and we liked them. I liked how easy they were to throw together and didn't dirty up a bunch of dishes. I used Asagio Fresco cheese because it needed to be used. Nice submission for an easy lunch or a quick dinner =)

Very good, I put spaghetti sauce instead and made the patties with ground pork in my Big Boss Grill.

This recipe is simple but packs a lot of flavor. I used a little more of the spices than called for because I like stronger flavors, but it's kind of amazing how well these taste. Will definitely be making again!

These were pretty Good! I did put my twist on my kind of pizza burger lol I used provolone layered pepperoni,sliced onion,mushrooms and banana peppers! With my additions it was a 5 star burger as written 4 star!
