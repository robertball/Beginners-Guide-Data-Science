These are great!  Made them for my gluten free birthday girl and the whole family loved them!  Added sliced apples to the butter before melting (apple pancakes are the family favorite) and used almond flour, almond flavoring and maple syrup rather than stevia. It puffed up and the presentation was awesome. This recipe may usurp the apple pancakes as the new family favorite.

I am gluten intolerant, lactose intolerant & paleo. So this recipe is perfect for me! I've made this a few times now, it's quick & easy. Since it's only 2 of us, I make half a recipe in a 9" pie pan. I've also made them "savory" by omitting lemon extract & sweetener and adding dried herbs & grated cheese! I also use Almond flour instead of chestnut. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!
