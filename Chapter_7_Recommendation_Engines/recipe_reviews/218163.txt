I had to make a few adjustments to this recipe so that I would use what I had on hand. I did NOT have Jif Creamy Peanut Butter and Honey, I used a quarter cup regular creamy peanut butter. I also did not have sunflower seeds, I just upped the amount of peanuts by another half cup. When mixing everything together, I did not add the cranberries only because I did not want to chance burning them. I added them after the snack mix had cooled. This was a nice snack mix--the whole family enjoyed it. If I was to make it again, I would double it and use oil in place of butter to prevent the butter from spoiling (this does happen in snack mix, trust me).

Good peanut and cinnamon flavor.  The sunflower seeds were really small, and tended to sink to the bottom.
