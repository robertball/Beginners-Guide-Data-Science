This recipe is delicious and so easy! I didn't use the walnuts but that's all I changed and it was wonderful. The smell had my husband begging for them straight out of the oven.

didn't have the toffee flavor i was looking for. the chocolate topping was a bit overwhelming. it was easy enough to make but ended up tasting more like a cookie bar than a toffee bar.
