Wonderful!  I baked the chicken instead of grilling it.  I used 1 package of chicken breasts (1.75 lbs), and halved the recipe of marinade (and it still made tons!).  Put the chicken in a glass 13x9x2" dish at 350 for 35 minutes.  Perfect!  I would omit the extra basting at the end - I think the marinade was a tad heavy on the salt (which was in the miso paste), so adding more at the end was a little bit much for my taste.  Will definitely make again though.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe surprised me!  It was a HUGE hit!  Took this with us camping.  Boiled the chicken first, then put in a ziploc with the marinade.  People loved it.  I was worried that it would have a heavy soy taste, but it didn't at all.  Now I'm experimenting with different meats.  Made a great marinade for tofu as well.

This gets a A+++. My husband and 9 year old just loved this! Very good taste! I did my chicken in my showtime rotissere grill and just kept coating the chicken with the sauce with a turkey baster while it cooked. Turned out real moist and tender. I had NO left overs! I will be increasing the recipes next time!

This was very delicous served with roasted asparagus and jasmine rice. I have two teenage sons who just loved it! My 5 year old nephew didn't like as much. More of an 'adult' taste than a kid taste.

Very easy and flavorful. I marinated the chicken all day, drained and then cooked it in the broiler. Very delicious dinner.

Great recipe. Experiment with this one: I added several cloves of garlic, a chunk of ginger, whirred it in the food processor and added all the other ingredients. I diced my chicken into 1 -inch chunks as I planned on baking it. I think this would work with pork, also. I plan on trimming the fat off of a couple of boneless chops and tossing everything in the slow cooker.

Delicious!  I have used different types of miso and different brands of beer but it's always a hit.  Also works well for marinating vegetables (in a separate bowl or bag) and then I use the vegetable marinade for basting.  The only change I make is to cut up the chicken and cook it on skewers.

Don't marinate the chicken longer than 4 or 5 hours!!  Although the taste was great, I did over marinate, and it was WAY too salty.  Follow the instructions.... It's a great dish.

Was OK, no revelation here. I prepared the marinade with white miso and the flavor didn't really come through. I suspect that had I made it with a different type of miso it would have been better. Overall the chicken was fine, but after chilling for 11 hours in a sea of yummy marinade the flavor didn't quiet permiate well, and the sugar burned during cooking. While I liked the taste of marinade alone and I think it would work well as a dipping sauce (at least with white miso), I will not be using this recipe again for marinading chicken.

This recipe is excellent. I had been looking for a miso recipe like fine Japanese restaurants, and this fits the bill. The marinade was great on salmon, as well.

VERY VERY good  I baked(no grill), made only 1/2 recipe of the marinade, but used the full 2 ½ lbs of chix (glad I did b/c all wanted leftovers!).  I cut each breast half in 4 pieces b/c they were huge & was concerned about them getting done.  I marinated in a pyrex casserole covered w/foil for 1½ hrs. Even though I made a 1/2 recipe of the marinade I used only 1/2 of that (so abt 1/4 orig recipe).  Drizzled it on top turned them over a couple of times to make sure they were covered and sitting in it. Prehtd to 350, took dish straight from frig to oven and cooked it 15 min, then quickly turned the pieces over (inspecting how much longer they needed to cook) & added some sweet potato chunks & baby carrots around the edges of the pan. Put back in oven & cooked 15 more min. covered.  Took out, turned pieces again in sauce (vegs incl.) left foil off, cooked an addtl 5 min (yes, lg breasts). Then turned oven off leaving them in 'til ready to eat….abt 15 more min.  Wish I’d made rice to soak up the sauce it made…next time.  For anyone worried about the raw chicken/ marinade/ cooking thing: b/c it was a preheated oven & cooked over 30 min, the marinade simmers & reaches a temp hot enough to kill bacteria– in fact it simmers most of the time its cooking so it’s very safe. If the chicken is done all the way through they’re both safe.  Only minus to recipe is waaay too much marinade. Too good to remove a star, just be aware - if you make extra, keep away from raw ckn & use it later

I loved this. I served on top of egg noodles. I added fresh ground ginger, garlic, olive oil, (it helps blacken most meats) and whatever cayenne. Grilled indoors on a Jenn Air. Reserved some of the marinade and cooked it down to thick sauce and poured it over the plate....Guests were blown away. I am going to do the same tonight but am going to use shrimp on skewers served over a think pasta.

mmm, not so much.  i shoulda known it wouldn't come out whe the marinade didn't taste so great.  the taste of white sugar did not go well with the chicken.  maybe better with honey or brown sugra.  overall it was pretty disgusting.

I added small amount of Thai red curry sauce and some saki and put this recipe into overdrive.  This will definitely be added to line up.

Used less sugar and more cayenne, also some Japanese ichimi to match the miso. I threw some shiitake mushrooms and green onions into the marinade as well. AWESOME, and you can drink the rest of the beer you don't use... :D

This recipe definitely delivered! It was a very welcome change in my home since some members of my family cannot have acidic foods. So that means no barbeque sauces with tomatoes or vinegar. I even substituted tahini mixed with some anchovy paste when I ran out of miso. The marinating process definitely helps to tenderize the meat. I've used this recipe with pork, lamb and beef and it was a hit everytime. A recipe to keep close.

I like it.  It was a unique take on BBQ.  I chose this recipe because I have a lot of miso that needs to be used up and this does a good job of that!

Quite DELICIOUS!!!  And SOOO EASY to prepare.   Everyone enjoyed this dish 
very very much.   I found that using my 
favorite soy sauce; an organic wheat-free
tamari sauce with out of this world smooth 
flavor made the marinade too expensive.. so next time I make this I'll use a more reasonably priced soy sauce.

I have been looking for ways to make chicken breasts flavorful and this recipe did this.  I grilled it along with steaks and I was surprised to see people going back for the chicken.

This was a hit!

Excellent! I didn't have beer on hand so I used dry white. Will try beer next time. For those not familiar with miso, give it a try. Miso is soybeans fermented with rice and/or barley. Most common miso is white or red. White miso is more mild and sweet. I use it mostly for salad dressings. Red miso is quite bold in taste and is excellent in marinades, as in this recipe, or soup.

Pretty good, but not as tasty and tender as I thought it would be given the ingredients.

This was great over rice and steamed veggies. If it wasn't quite as salty it would have been much better. I would cut down on the soy sauce.

Pretty good with tofu. The next day, I sauted veggies in unused marinade and added rice and leftover tofu!

This is a good recipe.  The second time I made it, I used sake instead of beer, added minced garlic and ginger, and a splash of mirin.  Came out very tasty and juicy.

very good in a hibachi... 
I would say the second (and even third) bastings are warranted...

These chicken breasts tasted really good, but they weren't particularly special or different.  I probably won't go to the trouble of buying miso paste and beer (not items that I normally keep in my fridge) to make this recipe again.

It was delicious, but too salty for me. I will experiment with things to add to maybe make it less salty (with the miso paste and the soy sauce, it's very salty). Also, I halved the recipe for the marinade and I still had enough to cover the meat and some veggies.

Good recipe. Can be a little salty with the red miso and soy sauce. Next time I will reduce the soy sauce and substitute a little water.

I really liked it and the chicken medallions grilled up beautifully, but if you're not a huge miso fan, it can be a bit overwhelming. My 2 & 5 year olds ate it right up (I kept their non cayenne pepper marinade separate from ours). It made a lot of wasted marinade. I think I could have made 1/3 of it and been just fine.

My family loved this dish.  It was pretty salty, but I think it's either because I used regular soy sauce or that it marinated for 5 hours.  I'll try it again, playing with the marinating time.  A keeper.

This was simple, delicious and turned out great.  I baked it instead of grilled it, as I do not have a grill, and it turned out juicy, flavorful and not at all salty.  Served it over soba noodles topped with aka-shoga (pickled red ginger). I'll definitely make this again.

This is a good recipe, but not spectacular.  I think it's a great starting point.  The chicken is nice and tender, but a little uninspired.  Next time I'll try either using sake instead of beer, OR sticking with the beer, but adding a generous amount of minced or grated fresh ginger.

Had extra marinade, so I sliced some tofu (the firm kind) in it, and grilled it over my George Foreman.  Yum!
