I made this for our Seder, and it was absolutely excellent. I made a few very slight changes, but nothing drastic. Instead of peeling and chopping I grated the unpeeled apples using my food processor, which saved immensely on the prep time, and I left the peels on, since that's where most of the apple's nutrients are (buy organic if you're going to leave the peels on, though).  Also, I added a bit more honey (about 2 TBS total) to help bind everything together. To get three cups of grated apples I needed 5 smallish gala apples. I got several compliments on this, and two separate people told me it was the best haroset they'd ever had. Thanks for the great recipe!

Good recipe for haroset. Once you have the basic ingredients down you can play to your own tastes. I always like a few more nuts in mine. Also, note in the intro to this recipe that the amount of the finished product is 3 cups. 6 apples of the size I used was way to many for the 3-cup total -- even 4 apples were too many. I'd say 3-4 medium fuji or gala would work fine.

This is a basic, very good haroset recipe.  I split the batch in half and used apple/grape juice instead of wine with half and it was perfect for the kids. Thanks!

This was a really good traditional recipe - ours was the best I've had.  Here are the changes we made:  1) used 4-5 small Fuji apples, unpeeled but cored - chopped further by food processor; 2) combined walnuts with chopped almonds and pecans for the 1 c. of nuts shown; 3) used port as the sweet red wine; 4) added some date sugar because we had some on hand - added some depth; 5) made it 48 hrs in advance and refrigerated until the passover dinner -- yum!!

We are non-alcoholic so I substituted apple-grape juice for the wine. Excellent fruit salad. Easy to make for a crowd.

This recipe was well-received at our Passover. I used regular wine (instead of sweet) and just 4 Gala apples, and it turned out great. If you are looking for a cement-like haroset this is not it, but I find this consistency more palatable.

This was a delicious haroset.  I used Gala apples as suggested, and substituted almonds and pecans for the walnuts.  It does seem that the recipe calls for an awful lot of apples.  I added extra nuts and cinnamon.

Good, basic recipe.  I use all honey rather than adding white sugar.  Most of the ingredients you can add to taste.

Thank you, Jill!  The first time I made this, we were celebrating Passover on a camping trip and I did not peel the apples.  It was perfectly delicious with the apple skins.  The second time I made this was for a family Seder.  I peeled the apples, but to save time I used a Cuisinart to chop both the apples (one at a time to avoid applesauce) and walnuts.  My only regret was the appearance of the charoset.  It would have looked much nicer if I had hand chopped the apples.  Nevertheless, the hostess of this Seder asked me to bring this charoset next year because she wants to make it a tradition.  I heard several people comment on the charoset and go back for seconds.

Great Recipe!!!  I do not like Walnuts, so I used pecans.  It worked out very well.  I nuttier flavor.  I also used Gala Apples, because I just read those are a great source of antioxidents.

Excellent recipe, definitely a keeper! I highly recommend peeling the apples and hand- chop them very very finely. It is a bit time-consuming, but totally worth it! Also added chopped and pitted dates- about 1/2 cup. Haroset needs the date flavor in it!

delicious!  my sister-in-law usually makes haroset but she was out-of-town so i had to do it.  i was hoping it would be as good as her's.  i found it was better!  i won't tell her though!  i did add more wine and honey, it did need a pinch or two of salt.  i also added fresh ground nutmeg and used half walnuts and half pecans. it was wonderful and gave it a nice nutty flavor. glad i found this recipe it was perfect. i even used the leftovers to put in my oatmeal it taste rich and wonderful! i did use a food processor to shred the apples

I love Haroset, this is my first time actually making it for myself. Easy to prepare. Came out perfect! As others suggested I only used honey, increased it to 4tsp, instead of sugar.  Will definately make this again!!!

PECANS!!!! I make this recipe every year and my family LOVES it but I use pecans.  It just gives it that little something that makes it stand out.  Those who don't like pecans, well, what can I say, you can't please everyone.  I use Blackberry Wine.

Its a good recipe but way too much for 6 people after a big passover meal! Next time I wouls make 1/3 this amount and use 2 apples instead of 5. I added raisins and dates to this for extra flavor but it made it very sweet.

I am a Gentile married to a Jewish husband so this is my first Haroset.  My mother in law says they always add a little horseradish for a kick.  I dispursed it in the wine before mixing it with the apples.  Delicious!

The right balance of fruit and nuts, wonderfully delicious.  You may want to substitute date syrup for honey if you can find it for a little extra authenticity, but either way this is my go-to charoset.

I have loved Haroset when others make it. This was my first time attempting this dish.  I used Fuji apples, pecans, honey and port. The family liked it - but no one took seconds. When I make this again, I might chop the apples finer (think food processor).

This has always been my go to recipe for charoseth from my childhood Sisterhood cookbook.  I don't measure anything, doing it all to taste.  I use all honey, no sugar, although I'm sure date sugar would taste good.  Manischevitz Concord is the only wine I think I've ever used.  Since my son is allergic to nuts, I've had to omit the nuts for the past 13 years, but I still get raves every time.

I've only been making haroset for a few years, and though each recipe has been good, something in this combination makes this one the best!  I also made a batch experiment-style, as the combination of ingredients in haroset tends to irritate  my mouth and tongue.  Yippee - the end result doesn't create that same affect.  I used pecans and almonds instead of walnuts, the full amount of apples, and did not peel them, but chopped them small but not fine in my food processor (did the nuts first, removed them and then did the apples).  I used all honey, added about 3/4 cup drained crushed pineapple, blended all together, then added both a sweet red wine and a bit of pineapple juice, for moistening.  Will definitely be using this recipe from now on!  Thanks for sharing this, Jill.

Delicious! Thank you for this recipe. Took the recipe up to 8 servings so I could use the whole bag of walnuts (exactly 1 1/3 cups), but only used 6 med/large apples. Added an extra squeeze of honey, an extra sprinkle cinnamon and a few more dashes of wine than called for... (Manischevitz). I will be using this recipe every year for Passover!

I thought this was very good, but it needs at least a 1/2 cup of wine, and it'e better to let it sit overnight.

The recipe is very good, but it makes way more than 3 cups.  I used 3 delicious apples, and got over a quart.  I used the leftover haroset (about 2 cups) to bake muffins.  I used a blueberry muffin recipe, and substituted the haroset for the blueberries and sprinkled some haroset on the top of each muffin - they came out great!

Delicious! I did not peel the apples,  but did chop them in the food processor. I also used slightly less wine than called for because we don't normally use alcohol products.  I will definitely make this again!

No changes.  Apples were very big so I only used 5 and it was more than enough.
Very good.

I used 6 Fuji apples, peeled and hand chopped.  I didn't use the sugar and added more honey.  Probably about 2 TBS total.  Also added another 1/2 cupPerfect chunky charoset texture that my family prefers.

I hand chop the apples.  My sons is allergic to walnuts so I use cashews.  I added the cinnamon and red wine, but never add sugar or honey.  Perfect!   My family loves it.

I love this side dish. It was my first time making haroset so I don't have a comparison aside from trying it at Temple.  I used McIntosh apples which are naturally sweet so I skipped the sugar and opted only for the honey for sweetness.  I added half a lemon worth of zest and juice to keep the apples from browning.  Let's just say I've made it a second time since Passover.  It makes a great addition to my morning oatmeal.

This recipe was quick, easy, and super delicious. I took the advice of a couple other reviews and left the skin of the apples on. It gave the charoset nice color and keeps the nutrients from the peel. (Just be sure to use organic apples if you're keeping the peel!) I used 6 small organic gala apples and a cup of walnuts. It made enough for two medium bowlfuls. The rest of the ingredients I added by taste: cinnamon, honey, manishewitz. I omitted the sugar because the apples and honey are plenty sweet already. I also added about a tablespoon of lemon juice (for flavor and to prevent browning) and a prince of salt. Yum!

Great basic recipe for Charoset.  Like one of the reviewers said, if you're looking for the type of Charoset that is thick like cement, this is not for you.  It is lighter and fresher.  I cut the recipe in half since we're not a big crowd this year and I'm sure I'll have plenty left over after our seder - except for the fact that my daughter eats it like it's a great snack.  MAKE SURE TO MAKE IT AHEAD OF TIME AND SHAKE IT OCCASIONALLY TO MAKE SURE THE WINE IS ABSORBED BY ALL THE APPLES AND WALNUTS.
