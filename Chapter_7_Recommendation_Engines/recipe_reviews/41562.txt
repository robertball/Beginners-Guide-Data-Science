A great recipe when you make these changes: 1. Use more garlic (6-8 cloves) 2. Use lots of fresh lemongrass.  Take a spike of lemongrass, hammer it to release the flavor, add to the oil and remember to strain it out in the end.  3. Fresh ginger works great also, add to the oil and strain out in the end. 4. Use a Thai oil like peanut oil.  You can skip the butter. 5. Spice the soup towards the end using your favorite Thai spices.  I used tumeric, paprika, curry, etc.) 6. When serving, squeeze a few drops of lime juice and zest some lime peel (Keffir lime works amazing if you have access to a specialty produce store, but regular limes will bring out a lot of flavor too). 7. Enjoy!

Excellent, really, really, good! It has a explosive flavor that is unique. But if your going to make it dont mess with the ingredients till you've tried it. PLEASE. Recomend for those who enjoy exotic food.

The soup was a bit too rich and the lemon grass left strings of hard fibers behind after blending.  However, I will cook this again!  I increased the seasonings and added some "Tom Yum" paste since other reviewrs thought it needed a boost.  Next time I will do the same, but use lite coconut milk and use less coconut milk and more broth.  This recipe is worth tinkering with!

this was served at a recent all staff meeting.  (One of the pleasures of working at Allrecipes!) It was delicious and tasted of Fall, but with a Thai twist.

I'd try it again cooking the pumpkin separately in the chicken stock, then adding the sauteed shallot, etc. right before sticking in the blender.  The seasonings lost significant flavor cooking in the soup.

This was really a nice pumpkin soup, but the Thai flavors were very subtle (I was hoping for a little more Thai taste, since I love Thai food).  I added fresh ginger, more garlic, cayenne pepper, more lemongrass and more chilis the second time I made this.  And everyone wanted seconds.

Great soup! Careful with the chilies though, I doubled all the ingredients to cater for more people and I found that two chilie gave it a sufficient kick. Also added a couple of teaspoons of freshly grated ginger... yumeee ;o)

thank you so much for this recipe. it was exactly what i was looking for. i have a lot of baked squash from last fall's harvest that needs to be cleared out of the freezer. in this recipe i used two pounds of hubbard squash pulp, so i didn't have to cook the soup for a long time, since the squash was already soft. also, i don't have access to good quality fresh lemongrass, so i picked up one of those tubes of processed lemongrass. another change i made was with the red chili's. my baby doesn't like me very  much when i eat spicy foods, so i used half a red bell pepper with a very small dash of red chili flakes. it was the perfect amount of heat (think 1/4 star on the thai scale).

excellent recipe & SO easy!  thanks again!

A friend of my mother-in law made this soup while we were visiting.  It was WONDERFUL!!!  I had to get a copy of the recipe.  I am looking forward to sharing this wonderful soup with my friends.

Preparing the pumpkin was a pain but I really wanted to try this recipe.  I found it a bit too bland fo me so I tweaked it a bit.  After it was cooked I added about 2 heaping table spoons of Brown Sugar, The zest of an entire lemon, juice of half a lemon and a good table spoon of curry powder.  I then left it simmer for another 5-10 minutes.  NOW it's tasty.  It has some sweet, some sour, and some depth.

Just made this: it was really nice.  The combination works surprisingly well.  I did add a bit of salt, nam pla (fish sauce) and a tablespoon of lime juice to give it more kick.  If I did it again I'd use 4-5 sticks of fresh lemon grass, cleaned, bashed and cut into 3-5cm long strips.

Followed the recipe to the T but found it exceptionally bland.  Added grated ginger and cooked a while longer, but still no flavor.  Definitely needs more punch, perhaps helped by lime or lemon.

Very good, worthy of serving to guests. I couldn't find unsweetened coconut milk so I used regular. For the lemon grass I used a full stalk, cut into 3 or 4-inch strips, and pounded it in the pan with a meat hammer to expose the pulp. Before pureeing the soup I sifted it to remove the lemon grass pieces. I thought the soup was a little too liquidy so I boiled a lot of it off. I heard sugar pumpkins have less moisture than regular pumpkins so that might fix the problem.

Loved this!  I felt like I just made restaurant quality soup...no, better!  The key was to strain it after blending- it results in a smooth and beautiful soup.  Next time I'll take it down a notch in the chile dept just based on preference, but it is very Thai tasting as-is.  Try it!

This did start out a little too subtle for my boyfriend's taste, but I cheated and added some "Thai seasoning" from a tube I found in the produce section. I also made this into more of a meal by adding chicken, bell peppers, and onions; I cooked these in the seasonings first and gradually introduced the soup ingredients. He was skeptical, but really liked it - I caught him wiping the pan clean with a piece of bread later! =D

Our family loved this soup.  We didn't have lemongrass, though, in our local supermarket so we just squeezed a tablespoon plus a little more of a fresh lemon into the garlic/shallot mix.  Wonderful with some fresh ground pepper, a tiny pinch of salt, and the basil garnish.

Once made, it seemed to be missing something flavor-wise, or perhaps it was just a bit too subtle. So I used other reviewers' suggestions and added ginger and extra garlic. I also added some peanut butter which I thought was a good addition.
I reserved a little of the coconut cream and swirled some of that on top for decoration and sprinkled with crushed peanuts. Tasted good.

I have to say, I didn't love this. I followed the recipe to the letter at first. When I tasted the soup, it had plenty of heat, but was strangely still bland despite that. Adding salt helped a lot, but I still felt it needed a sour component to balance it out. If I had had limes on hand, that might have done the trick. If I make this again, I will be sure to squeeze in some lime juice near or at the end of cooking.

This was so bland, it didn't have any flavor. I served it to a friend and his response was "This doesn't taste like anything!" I followed the recipe, took some suggestions from other reviewers and added extra garlic and a bit of red curry, and still this soup was a disappointment.

I can't honestly rate this as written, but what I made was a definite 5 in my house! As is customary in many reviews, here is my version, changes only: (omitted red pepper and lemon grass) 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 sweet onion subbed for shallots, 1 can chicken broth, 1 can LITE coconut milk, 1 tsp. ginger paste from the tube (in the fresh herbs produce section) and added 10-15 cooked shrimp. Also, allow to salt and pepper to taste. And my #1 secret??? I used 3 1/2 c pureed fresh sweet Hubbard squash, bright orange in color, and it was fresh and amazing! Truly a blend of my favorite Thai soup with a fall pumpkin taste! What an amazing soup!

This has a very nice flavor... not over the top, but a nice thai flavor.  I used one dried chili pepper in place of the fresh and it had a nice warmth to it.  I also used butternut squash in place of pumpkin.  Please note that this makes a fairly thin soup; if you were looking for a bisque consistency you may want to decrease the amount of broth.  Enjoy!

This soup was a hit for the entire family.    I made some slight modifications based on what I had in my house and personal preferences.  I doubled the amount of garlic and lemon grass that the recipe called for and used canned pumpkin instead of fresh (1 can = 2 cups).  I also added about a 1 teaspoon of ground ginger and a 1/2 teaspoon of yellow curry powder.  Instead of red chili peppers I used green serrano peppers. I also added some coconut syrup (about a teaspoon) to sweeten the spiciness of the soup.    This was an amazing recipe to work with!  Next time I think I might add some crushed peanuts as garnish with the basil before serving!

With all of the delicious spices in this soup, I was excited to taste it. I used dried lemongrass instead of fresh - that was a mistake. The bits of lemongrass were tough to chew and didn't blend in well. I used reduced fat coconut milk and I ended up not tasting any coconut flavor at all. Overall the flavor was dull. I can't help but think I did something wrong. Too much canned pumpkin, maybe. I'm not sure but with enough salt, my husband and I ate it anyway.

I agree with Michelly2's review - try this recipe as is before messing with the ingredients.  The recipe is good as is.  After trying it that way, I opted to add twice the amount of lemongrass (paste) and 6 garlic cloves for personal tastes.  Anyone who has had authentic, Asian Thai pumpkin soup will enjoy this recipe.  If you add chicken, brown sugar, etc, then it is no longer Thai pumpkin soup - just pumpkin soup.  Thanks for the recipe, Brigit!!!

Wow, this was so bad.  I followed the recipe and I couldn't eat it.  My wife couldn't either, and she tried.  I had hopes, but this dashed them.

I made this as the recipe calls for it.  Does not do anything for me...Not a fall/harvest pumpkin feel or taste and also not spicy or Thai tasting. All and all, a pretty big disappointment.  Now I have three more nights of blah to look forward to.  Not sure why this got such good ratings.

Great soup. Very authentic and the chillis certainly give it a kick.

I only had canned pumpkin on hand, so I used that, but the soup was not as thick as I would have liked.  Next time I will add less stock.    As others have mentioned it didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for, so I added some ginger and lime juice.  This would make a great base, so next time I will plan on adding vegetables, and perhaps some chicken to the soup to make it more hearty.

This recipe didn't deliver the flavour I was expecting.  I doubled the herbs and spices and added some peanut butter.

This is a good base.  I added about 2 tablespoons of fish sauce and brown sugar, as well as the juice of half a lime to deepen the Thai flavor.  Next time, I am also going to mix in some jasmine rice and bean sprouts so the soup can stand as a meal on its own.

This is really good as-is, and a great springboard for add-ins and adjustments. The Thai flavors are pretty subtle so if you like your Thai strong like I do, you will probably want to crank them up. I added red curry and threw some lime leaves in while my soup was cooking, and doubled the lemon grass. We had this with cold shrimp and chili-garlic sauce as an appetizer. Oh, I also used canned pumpkin because it's not in season now, but I really wanted to make this soup - it works fine. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious.  The basil is absolutely what makes this dish work.  Ended up chopping up the entire stalk of lemongrass and throwing in some ginger and extra garlic as the soup's flavor was a little on the bland side, although that might have been because I used a red bell pepper since I live with people who can't handle a little spice in their food and also because I used store-bought stock (no, it wasn't broth).

I will definitely play with this recipe.

I love anything Thai its true - but this savory pumpkin I would never think of pairing with Thai coconut milk and lemon grass - but it works...and the basil on top just makes it all work together perfectly for a robust flavorful soup!  I had two helpings!

Very delish!  My kids (8 & 6) loved it!  I tweaked it a bit by adding some carrot and celery to the mix.  Also added extra garlic and lemongrass.  love this version of pumpkin soup.  Will definitely make again next year.

Let me start out with saying my boyfriend and i do not like the taste of pumpkin. I made this recipe because i got a free pumpkin at work and didnt want it to go to waste. We both LOVE this soup!! This is absolutely a repeat. The only changes I made was I used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock and doubled up on the seasonings.

Hi i am giving the modifications to this recipe that suggest a little extra lemongrass, ginger, fish sauce and brown sugar a thumbs up.  I further added some cilantro early in the cooking, added some anise seed while sautéing onions since Thai basil has a bit of that flavor, and held off on my sweet basil until the very end before serving.

It was delicious! Though doubled the recipe and I made a bunch of changes. I followed the advice of kittenbrain and added 6 cloves (instead of 1) and added about 2 tablespoons of diced ginger and stir fried that in mostly butter (because I had old butter that I needed to use). I didn't have any lemongrass or chili peppers but I subbed with sriracha sauce to make it spicy. Added a bunch of thai spices and pepper to taste and voila! Awesome creamy soup that I'll definitely make again.

I just made a few modifications. I added an extra chili pepper, doubled the lemon grass and garlic, and added a 2cm cube of ginger. The pumpkin I used was a fresh one from the store. I roasted it for 40 minutes in the oven and peeled off the skin afterwards. I used homemade turkey stock instead because I had some left over from Thanksgiving. This soup turned out so wonderful. It is my new favourite! My boyfriend gave it 5/5.

This has become my go to pumpkin soup recipe, great all round. After experimentation I use whole lemon grass stalks which I crush ensuring the root end isn't damaged so it stays together whilst you cook, I fry this with one and a half teaspoons of garlic and two teaspoons of fresh chilli paste and some pre soaked kaffir lime leaves. I brown my onions separately. I also roast the pumpkin prior to adding everything to the pot for a good simmer, I feel the roasting really brings out the pumpkins flavour. Just before serving I stir through around a quarter cup of chopped fresh coriander and four tablespoons of lime juice.

Made this because we got winter squash and lemongrass in our CSA box, and I had no idea what to do with the lemongrass ... saw this and almost all the ingredients (including the chilies) were in our box.  Kids and husband loved it, very flavorful.  I only used half the chilies (I'm a wimp) and a butternut squash, and it worked out beautifully.  Will make again as we have butternut squash coming in from our garden as well.  :D

I didn't have the lemongrass on hand, and I used onion instead of shallot, because that's what I had. I used pureed pumpkin and the cream of coconut, then shredded cilantro and basil, added a dash of sucanat (brown sugar). EXCELLENT soup. Oh yeah and I didn't have chilis so I used cayenne and red pepper flakes.

Used prepared pumpkin instead of cooking in the chicken broth so to get more of the chicken flavor without thinning the soup, I added 1/2 cup of broth and 1 de-boned chicken thigh an pureed in blender. I subtituted a habanero for red pepper and lemon zest for the lemon grass.

Made this soup just as recipe stated. Not so good. After some doctoring it was better. Added a t. or so of red curry paste, fresh grated ginger, some lime juice and chopped basil. Only pureed half the soup so it had more texture

This soup is perfect the way it is. The only thing you should be aware of is the lemon grass strings. The fibers will be extremely annoying unless you A. Strain them before adding the pumpkin B. Put them in a metal loose tea bag so that they don't mix with the soup, but still seep out the flavor.  I will be making this soup a lot and it works great with nutmeg pumpkins if you have those in your area.

We added fresh ginger instead of lemongrass, and cooked chicken after blending, it was really good!

I doubled the garlic an lemongrass, as suggested, and used a can of each of the liquids.  LOVED IT.  I also used the prechopped lemongrass and chillies in the produce section.  Made it much faster and easier to prepare.

This soup was okay. If I'd stuck with the quantities as written, however, it would have been rather bland. I made it to a 'T', except for doubling the amount of lemongrass and garlic as suggested by other reviewers, and even still both my housemate and I agreed it was a very bland soup. I then proceeded to add another tablespoon of lemongrass; chopped fresh cilantro (maybe about 4 tablespoons); and the juice of 1/2 a lime. These additions definitely helped the flavor.

Aussies love their pumpkin soup... and they love their Thai, this combines the best of both.  My entire family (small boys included) loved this soup!

After tasting it, I decided it needed some sea salt and some extra chopped lemongrass. Good soup.

This is a delicious recipe... well balanced and flavorful.  We only used 1 chili pepper, and it wasn't spicy at all (maybe not spicy enough).

This soup is really good, but like others, a little too bland for my taste.  The first time I made it, it was a hit.  I couldn't find fresh lemon grass so I used powdered and I added a bit of curry and vegetable base (Better than Bouillion).  I made some today since I had some pumpkin that I had pureed in the freezer.  I was missing some, well alot of the ingredients so improvised...3 shallots instead of four, one more clove of garlic, no chicken broth so I made vegetable broth with the vegetable base, no coconut milk so decided to experiment and added 2 snack cups of unsweetened applesauce along with one cup of rice milk, again used curry (love the stuff), oh and about 1/4 of a red pepper since I didn't have chili peppers and a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little kick. Not bad... not bad at all...tastes about the same as the first time I made it.
