I normally buy the packaged seasoning to add to a can of spaghetti sauce.  It never really had that perfect taste. I decided to try this recipe, because, it seems I go to make spaghetti, and I am out of an envelope of mix.  This sauce mix was easy to put together.  My family loved it.  I did have to add ground red pepper, because I could not find sweet red pepper.  This did add a little kick.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  will definitely make again.  Very cost effective.

I really like this recipe and have made 3 batches so far (scaled to 48 servings).  We love pasta, and the canned sauces have so many preservatives and sodium.  This is so easy to make and keep around.  I put in half of the corn starch and double the garlic-to suit our tastes.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Having this easy dry mix on hand is great for those nights when you don't have the time or just "don't feel" like cooking!  It is also perfect for those travel weekends at a cabin or cottage when you want to "pack light". I added crushed red pepper flakes in place of the sweet pepper and about half of the sugar and salt (more can be easily added to taste as the mixture is simmering).  Also, I use small amts of red wine to make thesauce richer and cut the bitterness of the tomato paste. It thickened up nicely and I will definitely use this recipe again! Can't wait to try it for pizza sauce!

I am only rating the sauce mix portion of the recipe as I referred to another recipe for the actual sauce.  This saved me a trip to the store since I never keep those sauce packets on hand (I have never even used a spaghetti sauce mix packet...) and it worked well.  I did use some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.  Thank you for the recipe!

I was searching for a tomato sauce that didn't contain sugar, and couldn't find one at the store. I tried this recipe (minus the sugar) and it's fantastic! It's just so easy to whip up a batch of spaghetti sauce when you have this in your pantry. I just made up a batch of the mix for the second time, and I used onion powder instead of minced onion (not a big fan of onion texture), and I added more garlic, but even as-is this recipe is great.

Just like the store bought mix, a real lifesaver when I noticed too late that I only had tomatoe sauce on hand. Tangy, not sweet, not too spicy.

Good sauce! Pretty easy to make. We doubled the garlic and added some crushed red pepper, (we couldn't find the sweet pepper flakes). I might go a hair lighter on the parsley next time, but it's a good, hearty sauce so we'll definitely make it again!

I didn't find sweet pepper flakes at the grocery store either, but on recipezaar I found that it is just dehydrated bell peppers.  The equivalency amount is 1 Tbsp sweet pepper flakes = 3 Tbsp chopped bell pepper.  So just substitute chopped bell pepper.  My husband liked this very much, and I really liked being able to make spaghetti sauce from ingredients at hand.

I really liked this recipe, it was so easy to throw the mix together, and then anytime you need a quick meat sauce it is just one trip to the market away for ground beef and tomato paste. Thanks for sharing the recipe it is a crowd pleaser that is not too spicy, but far from the bland taste of most jar sauces.

This is so easy and helpful to keep on hand. It is also much more affordable than buying the jars of spaghetti sauce or the packets. I definitely recommend this recipe.

Fantastic base recipe - very easy to modify to your family's tastes.  Like most reviewers, I used 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes instead of sweet pepper flakes (didn't have any), switched out the parsley flakes (eww) for about half the amount of dried basil and left out the sugar and salt (diet restrictions).  Even with my changes, the base was spot on, especially the ratio of cornstarch to liquid.  Key is to use an Italian seasoning blend you like and to watch your salt if you use a blend that is salty.  I made a double batch (with half hamburger and half mushrooms).  I recommend letting it sit for at least a few hours in the refrigerator to allow the flavors to meld.  Better than any jarred sauce out there!

This made the best spaghetti dinner ever. Rich and saucy with a very robust flavor. The best part ~ no puddle of tomato-y liquid pooling under the noodles. I made the recipe as written, but used slightly less water when it came to following the directions for making the sauce. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

Used 1tsp each sugar and salt and no sweet pepper flakes (didn't have any).  Used the Italian Dressing Mix (from this site) for the Italian seasoning.  Everything else the same.  Used it to make the "Cola Pot Roast 1" from this site.  Can't wait to try it in spaghetti.

The base of this recipe was pretty good. I couldn't find sweet pepper flakes but substituted red pepper flakes as most people suggested. It was so spicy. I will make this again but will probably just cut out the red pepper flakes or seriously cut down on them.

I really like the idea that I can make this sauce quick and easy but I know what is in it and it's not loaded with sodium.  I ended up adding an extra can of tomato paste to thicken it up and make it nice and tomato tasting. Next time I might just add a little more cornstarch so I won't have to do that. My husband likes it and that's the highest rating of all!

I ran out of spaghetti seasoning mix and decided to try this one. I didn't have "sweet" pepper flakes, so I used red pepper flakes instead. I would caution if you make this substitution, only use 1 Tbsp. at the most, as it adds a lot of spice! (luckily my husband likes a little spice) However, I really liked the flavor and fully intend to use this again... I may even try to find actual sweet pepper flakes.

First time I ever tried making spaghetti sauce.  Made it exactly as directed and it was flawless!  This was so easy and tasted much better than canned or jarred spaghetti sauce.  I am making it for dinner tomorrow night AGAIN!  Everyone ate seconds of spaghetti.  Grear recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Really convenient and flavorful. I added 1 tsp more salt and Italian seasoning but overall very good. This would make a great Christmas gift packaged in a jar with a basket filled with the seasoning, tomato paste, and uncooked spaghetti. I know I would appreciate a gift like that. Like someone said earlier, it's perfect for those evenings when you're short on time and energy.

Loved this simple recipe for something a little more home made than canned/jarred sauce, plus cheaper. I can customize it with as much or little spice as I want. I made my first batch as written above except all I had were red pepper flakes, not sweet pepper flakes.. FYI: I only used about half of what the recipe calls for in red pepper flakes.. it still made it a little more spicy than I'm used to so if you don't have sweet pepper and have to use red pepper, use only a small amount unless you really want it spicy! I also did not have minced onion so I added about maybe a tsp of onion powder and some Tastefully Simple brand Onion Onion. It didn't amount to 1/4 cup worth combined but I was afraid to make it too overpowering since Onion Onion can get strong if you use too much. It probably amounted to about 1/8cup total int hat region. I still used 1/4 cup of the final product to make the sauce and it turned out just fine! I'll tweak it around to my own liking a little more next time now that I know what the final product is like.

Sorry, but I was not impressed. The beef picked up no flavor from the seasoning whatsoever, and the sauce never thickened. I won't use this recipe again.

Excellent and frugal recipe. My mom used to make spaghetti using the mix, and everyone loved it. I used the mix recipe, but with a twist. I browned grown beef, onion, green pepper, and fresh garlic. Stirred in 1/4-cup of the mix, 2 cans tomato paste & 4 cups water. Let it simmer while I cooked spaghetti. Turned out great -- and cheap too. My kind of recipe.

I simmered this for 20 minutes. It smelled great and tasted better. I only used 1 tsp salt. My only complaint was it was way too thick and I think you could cut back on the cornstarch. I can't find sweet pepper flakes at our store and I'm not familiar with the product, so I used paprika instead and a couple spoons of diced pimento and a good pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Sauce was good, just way too thick. Thanks.

Makes a very tastey sauce.  I couldn't find the sweet pepper flakes, but did find a sweet pepper and garlic spice blend.  When I'm browning the meat I also add fresh garlic, onion and mushrooms.  Later add in some red wine.  I prefer to use tomato sauce so I just decreased the water.

This is a nice and quick, dry spaghetti mix to have on hand.  It works great for sending 'homemade' back to school with college kids.  All they have to do is add meat, water and a can of tomato paste.  It cooks up with a nice consistency.  I served this over spaghetti squash.  I like that the mix can be kept on hand for a year.

This has become a staple on my shelf. I can my own tomatoes and a scoop of this mix added to a quart of home-growns make sauce that is delicious AND quick. I've been asked for the recipe as well asked to alert people to when I was making spaghetti for dinner so they could show up. I have not ever tried to make sauce from paste and water so I can't speak to how it works with that but I imagine it would work fine. Here's a tip of my own, if your sauce is acidic or you are serving people with sensitive stomachs, add 1/2 tsp baking soda to the pot, watch the science experiment foam, then stir it back down and it will be smooth and mellow.

This was so easy to mix up!  I could not find sweet peppers and substituted 2 TBSP of red pepper flakes.  This made for a pretty spicy sauce so I think I will cut back to 1.5 TBSP red pepper flakes next time.  I also omitted the garlic as I almost always have fresh on hand.  Mixed up with tomato paste, water and 2 cloves of fresh garlic and it was great served over tortellini!  I think I'll add in meat or extra vegetables to serve over plain spaghetti but the sauce stands very well on its own without add-ins.

Perfect. Add crushed pepper flakes and it makes a mighty pizza sauce as well.

Very sweet and spicy at the same time. I definitely wouldn't make this again.  We had to throw it away!

I made up some of the mix as written and left it with instructions for my husband to make up. He called me at work to say it was "fantastic." When I made the mix I used my dehydrated bell peppers chopped into small pieces for the sweet pepper flakes. Since then I've adjusted it by cutting the salt in half and adding an extra teaspoon of the dried minced garlic. We prefer to make it with a pint of our home-canned tomatoes and little less than a quarter cup of the mix, or a quart of canned tomatoes and about 1/3 cup of the mix. We also add some pre-cooked hamburger for a meatier sauce.

This is a great starter for spaghetti sauce.  Fix it up with some sauteed mushrooms, bell pepper, or onion.  Will use again...much healthier than the jarred stuff.

I fix two batches of the mix to keep on hand. One made with red pepper flakes (spicy) the other made as directed in this recipe (sweet). Then use 3 parts of the sweet to one part of the spicy to give the sauce some kick. I make double and triple batches of the sauce so I have plenty of sauce to freeze. I have made this numerous times and the family always gobbles it up. Thank you for the recipe, Betty. UPDATE: I first reviewed this in 2009, since then I have always had a jar of this mix (following the recipe exactly) on my pantry shelf. I use it once a week for an easy delicious meal. It has become a staple in my pantry. I also fixed my son  jars of the sauce mix(one following the recipe exactly and one jar of the spicy version) to have on his spice shelf now that he is cooking for himself for the first time.

Had more noodles left over than sauce so tried this in order to stretch it.  It's GREAT!  I didn't have sweet pepper flakes so used about 1 T. of red pepper flakes.  I'm so glad to have founds this.  No more bottled spaghetti sauce for me!

You are gonna love this recipe.  It makes the best sauce, better than what you can purchase and easy to do.  I make pizza sauce with the same mix by adding it to tomato sauce and not quite as much water as for spaghetti sauce.

I have the pickiest children on the planet when it comes to food. They hate most foods that normal children like and spaghetti is usually one of them! I had my daughter help me make the first batch of sauce and the kids LOVED it! I was shocked! I have to admit it was pretty darn good too! I thought it came out a little on the thick side so I thinned it with some white wine and it tasted great... some of my friends say that the kids ate it because of the wine (LOL) but I know it was because it tasted so good. My daughter loved taking responsiblity for making dinner, it was easy for her to put together for all of us!

Great receipe!!! Loved it... Could't find the sweet pepper flakes but found a combination of sweet pepper and garlic by McCormick that worked good.... Used sausage instead of ground beef which made it very flavorful. Made several batches for for future use... No more bought Spaghetti sauce here.

This actually gets 3.5 stars (3 from DH and 4 from me).  It was really easy and quick, but I just didn't like the sauce very much.  I used crushed red pepper as that was all that I had - I think it would be better with the sweet like the recipe calles for.

This is a great recipe with a little tweaking!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef to cut down on the fat content.  I also couldn't find the sweet pepper flakes and used red pepper flakes.  Someone suggested using half the amount of red peppers but for me that was still a little too spicy, especially for spaghetti.  So, next time I will use only 1/4 the amount of pepper called for in the recipe.  I also couldn't find any dried minced garlic so I just added fresh minced garlic as I was making the sauce.

Very simple recipe that proves there is often a much better and simple way to make something ordinary better.  I have never heard of sweet pepper flakes so I used half the amt with crushed red peppers.  I doubled the onions because I always double the onions.  I used a little extra garlic too.  The spaghetti turned out fantastic.  I will tape the recipe to a tupperware containing the spaghetti sauce mix...so I do not lose it!
