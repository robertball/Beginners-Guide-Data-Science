I make this recipe every year for New Year's Day. There is nothing like it! Splendidly delicious.  I actually got this recipe from my dear mother years ago who is now deceased going on 4 years this March 2013 in a local cookbook.  I am from deep Southern Louisiana.

Great dish. The only change I made was adding chopped bacon. We used it as a main course instead of a side and my picky eaters all gobbled it up!

We have family members that are very allergic to mushrooms. I used cream of chicken or cream of onion soup instead. It was gobbled up quickly.

This is a good way to disguise cabbage for people who don't like it. My husband can't stand cabbage but he really like this.  Very cheesy.

I had a bag of shredded coleslaw mix but I didn't want to make coleslaw so I found this recipe.  I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of processed cheese.  I chopped the onion in big pieces because I didn't want to go through the hassle of mincing it.  Also, I had asparagus I wanted to use and I'm glad I did because it gave it a slight crunch.  I steamed the asparagus and mixed it in before I put it in the oven.  I thought it was pretty good but it was still missing something.  Any ideas?

Instead of adding bread crumbs into the cabbage mixture, I add a prepared box of Stove Top stuffing to the top of this before baking it. We call it cabbage casserole. Itâ€™s always a big hit!

Used purple cabbage (what I had on hand),  less Velveeta, added a clove of garlic,  used Italian breadcrumbs( again, what I had),  cream of bacon soup,   skipped the salt due to the cheese 
 and soup .  pepperjack cheese, and a hefty dose of japalenos( we like spicy)

My husband loved this! It was a little too much cheese for me. I'll try cutting it in half next time,  or use cheddar instead of Velvetta.
