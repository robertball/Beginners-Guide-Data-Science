1.22.20 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/273428/blueberry-cornbread-cobbler/ ... I like different.  I do.  I'm second to review.  The first said it's not very sweet & needs more filling.  I upped blues to 5c, sugar to 1/2c  & added 1/2c flour to thicken; no chia seeds; 9x13.   It's still only slightly sweet.  As for the cornbread, the batter was so thick it wasn't going to do anything once in the oven.  I added a little milk to lighten the heaviness.  Nothing particularly good - or bad - about this.  ‘Hoped for magic, but it didn’t happen.  Can’t eat it on Day2.  :(  ... This is very good >   https://www.allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/62424942/cobbled-blueberries/

I think this is a great summer dessert. It's not super sweet, which  lets the fruit shine. However, the ratio of filling to topping seems off. I would probably doubling the filling because I had a thin layer of fruit with a thick layer of cornbread.
