I thought it was way too sweet and too much vinegar.

I made these for the first time about a week ago. To me the flavor seemed to be lacking a bit... maybe the tomatoes over did it or not enough spice... idk.... But it was super easy to prepare and even with a little tweaking didn't take nearly as much time as others!!! My fiance and I didn't eat all of it as I doubled the recipe BUT it gave me a nice base to actually make a nice chilli the next day so I can say it's super versatile and if you tweak it I think it's actually a decent recipe!!

I’d love to make this again! Followed the recipe and seasoned to taste. Savory and sweet and healthier with onions and peppers! Unfortunately I learned my husband doesn’t care for sloppy joe’s so maybe a once in a blue moon thing?

Very tasty!  Loved the red peppers!
So much moisture in the meat.
Not dry and pasty like when u make it from a packet mix.

The best Sloppy Joe's I have ever had.  Incredibly easy to make.  Definitely add the tomato paste and be sure to drain well.  This is a new staple instant pot meal in our house!

I made these as is, except for chili flakes. This was hands down the best sloppy joes I’ve ever had.

Loved it. I would recommend doubling up if you are going to feed 2-5 people. As this is barely enough sloppy joes sandwiches for two grown men if you think about it haha.
