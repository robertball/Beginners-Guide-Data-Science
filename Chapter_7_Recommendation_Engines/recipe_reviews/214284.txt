These were so yummy and easy!  I took these to a party and they were gone right away! They sort of taste like a Reeses peanut butter cup.

Only the most picky of Buckeye ball fans will be disappointed in this easy, tasty recipe.    Even I couldn't find a way to mess this one up.      Next time I think I will double the frosting, coating both the top and bottom, making a buckeye sandwich.

This is one awsome dessert. Taste just like buckeyes. And that is coming from a buckeye herself. You like buckeyes then you will love these. But dont take my word for it, go make some and try them yourself.

Delicious!  Taste just like Buckeye balls with the added crunch of the Nilla wafers.
