This is a traditional southern dish that I grew up on in South Carolina.  We always pan-fried the chops first, then removed them from the oil once they were brown.  We then added the onions until they were carmelized threw the chops back in the pan and added the richness of a can of Cream of Mushroom Soup.  Talk about intense flavor.  Served over a bed of hot rice it is heavenly.  Enjoy!!!

Big hit.  Based on the reviews and concern that it might be bland I did season the chops with seasoning salt and pepper before browning them. I also doubled the gravy, you can never have too much gravy in our house.  It turned out wonderfully and went great with the mashed potatoes and green beans with blue cheese.  Thanks for adding a great meal to our menu!

Smothered chops are a traditional southern comfort food served over a bed of white rice. This recipe is not the best (or tastiest) way of preparing it. Follow this instead: Heat veg oil in deep pot, season your chops (use bone in chops, not boneless) with salt & pepper or even seasoning salt, dredge chops in flour, fry chops just until brown on each side (chops will still be raw in the middle), remove & drain on paper towels, remove all oil from pot except approx 1/4 cup, add onions & sliced bell peppers, brown until tender, add chops back in and add just enough water to cover chops, cook covered on med/low for about 45 minutes. You can stir it a couple times just to make sure everything is cooking evenly. The chops will be tender and a delicious gravy will be ready to add to the rice. Enjoy!!

Awful.  Now to be honest, I'm not the best cook and have yet to make pork chops that were "tender".  I followed the recipe decreasing the flour to 1/4 cup (as suggested) and used Worcestershire, rosemary, season salt & pepper - also as suggested by reviewers.  Cooked boneless chops a little less than 30 minutes.  They were DRY.  The sauce was VERY thin and had a "funky" taste to it and very little flavor.  Now again, I could have made a mistake somewhere, but I double checked to make sure I didn't miss anything.  These were NOT good.  I will not make them again.

Made these a couple weeks ago.  They were fantastic!!!!  Neither I or boyfriend have had smothered pork chops in years.  Along with the green beans, garlic mash potatoes and homemade buttermilk biscuts...brought back a lot of memories.  I will be making these again.

I followed this recipe exactly and we were all very disappointed.  It was bland, with no flavor and I had to add a jar of gravy and seasonings to give it some kind of flavor.  To be blunt, it was nasty.  My 4 year old who eats anything and everything, wouldn't touch it after the first bite and I ended up having to make her a separate meal.  My husband, who loves smothered gravy, asked me never to make it again and we ended up giving it to the dogs.

This was just ok.  The gravy was too thick and not very flavorful.  1/3 cup of flour is just too much, I'm afraid. The pork wasn't very tender either.  At the last minute I added a bunch of black pepper for flavor.  I probably won't make this again.

Thank you for the recipe! I used it as a base by browning the pork chops spiced with Tony's and then sauteing store bought seasoning mix of onions, bell pepper, and parsley. I made my own gravy to add to the skillet and then I let everything cook as directed. I made extra gravy to go with homemade garlic mashed potatoes.

Very good very easy. I'm not sure what browning sauce is so I didn't use it.  I browned the chops in a little butter took them out then added the onion and garlic and cooked them a bit then added the flour and cooked it a little bit until it was brown then I added the chicken broth and water added the chops back in and simmered until cooked through.They came out tender an juicy. Served with mashed potatoes. Yum!

Serious YUM!!! These were sooooo good! We made them the other night, and they will definitely be a favorite we will make again! I read through some of the negative ratings for this, and made a few modifications that made it out of this world! I can understand how some were saying they were bland, you really do have to season the pork chops to give them their kick. I put a rub on the chops before browning them, the rub consisted of ground pepper, accent, thyme, and a little smokehouse maple seasoning. (you probably couldn't go wrong with a little cayenne, if you like a bit of spice?) Also, I don't understand how adding the flour to the pan could be any good either? I made the gravy the old fashioned way. I put the broth, flour, and browning in a jar, sealed the lid, and shook it up before pouring it over the chops. Much easier!! Let me tell you, if these are done right, they are to DIE for!

I've been using this recipe for years and it's always a hit. Very easy, just make sure you start in  more than enough time to ensure table time. Sometimes, I have to let this simmer for 2 hours to tender up my chops. But very delicious and worth the wait.

These are fantastic. I did season the chops with seasoming salt as suggested by other reviews and I cook the onion till nearly carmalized and then add and cook the garlic till the onions are camalized. I do this because my husband doesn't like onions and this way they cook completly down. After the onions and garlic are done I remove them and then cook the chops and then I throw them back in whith the rest of the ingredeants. My hubsand is extremly picky and he loves this dish. So much so that I've made it probably 10 times in the last two months since finding the recipie here.

This was really good.  I added Worcestershire and put extra gravy. I also put garlic powder, pepper and parsley  on the chops while they were being cooked. I also used very little flour.

The pork turned out pretty dry inside-- I may have overcooked slightly, but I was disappointed, especially since I used the same amount of sauce to cook only two pork chops instead of six.  My boyfriend, who has no sense of smell, also didn't find the sauce that exciting and added his own barbecue sauce. Probably because it's so garlic-heavy. I don't think we'll make this one again.

My husband and I used this recipe, but changed a few things in order to add some more flavor. Instead of browning sauce we used about 3/4 tablespoon of cajun roux. We also cut down on the flour, perhaps a little too much since the sauce we just a bit runny. I also threw a couple cans of sliced mushrooms in, and added plenty of cajun seasoning and some cayenne pepper. It ended up being very tasty. We'll definitly make this again!

I tried this as written first, which is why the 4 stars, good, but could be better.  The second time I seared the chops in a very hot pan first, removed them and deglazed the pan with chicken stock.  Then I caramelized the onions in the same pan, scraping up all the brown bits from the meat.  Next I mixed the flour and stock, whisked that into the onion mix in the pan, and nestled the chops into the sauce and simmered for about 30 min.  I used regular stock, not low sodium, so I did not use extra salt, but I did up the garlic.  I also used Vidalia onions to give a nice sweet taste to the chops.  They came out great, and I served them with garlic mashed potatoes.

I took the advice of other reviewers and seasoned the pork chops with season salt and pepper prior to browning. I also added 2 T. thyme while it was simmering and it added a great flavor. Finally a tender pork chop!

I seasoned our meat with black pepper and garlic salt. Otherwise followed the recipe directions. While it was not bad, it was not fabulous either. I found it to be a bit bland. I would use the recipe again as a base, but be sure to add spices to the gravy. Thanks for sharing!

The idea of this recipe is great; however, the simplifications in making the gravy is why so many of the reviewers are disappointed.  To make proper gravy, you must make a roux, otherwise the gravy will taste like flour.  To remedy this problem simply pull out the pork chops (they should be rubbed with spices and dredged in the flour first) after browning them, then add the flour and stir over low heat with the onion and garlic until golden brown.  Then add in the liquid, extra salt, pepper and paprika, and bring to a boil.  Place the pork chops back in, cover, and simmer for about an hour.

I had to comeback and thank the poster/contributor/chef for this recipe.  These smothered pork chop recipe is always a big hit at my house.  I've added this as a family staple it's so delicious.  Tonight for a little extra kick, I carmelized some onions with brown sugar...can you say TASTY?  This recipe is a hit!

This is one of my husband's favorite meals now!  I serve it with mashed potatoes so you can use the gravy.  The only thing I do differently is to brown the porkchops first, before I do anything else.  This recipe is one of the reasons my husband has gained 15 lbs!

Excellent.  I can't imagine why anyone would give this recipe a bad rating.  I've used this recipe exactly as written, and I have modified it a bit as well.  GREAT both ways.  My changes are use good (never cook with what you wouldn't drink) white wine in place of the half cup water.  Instead of the gravy it calls for, I just cheat ;) and add two packages of pork gravy and a cup and a half of chicken broth.  YUM, YUM!!!! It's always great!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this - sort of! I seasoned 5 very thick boneless chops with salt, pepper, and Emeril Lagasse's Essence before browning. For the sauce I used one 12 ounce beer, a can of condensed beef consommé, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, & the flour. Served it with mashed potatoes and collard greens. Wonderful!

I just made this recipe for supper.  My husband and I really enjoyed this with homemade mashed potatoes and fresh carrots.  The only change I made was to season the chops with Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning before browning and I added salt and fresh cracked pepper to the gravy.  Delicious!

I made this for my family last night and everything turned out fine. I took the advice of another reviewer and made a roux after browning the chops. I added all of the liquid ingredients last (after browning). I also got creative and decided to add (1) can of cream of chicken soup. Chops were tender and the sauce was very delicious; I served them with mashed potatoes and sweet corn. I'll be keeping this recipe front and center, my family loved it.

This is a keeper!  Even my picky child ate all of his pork chop.  Extremely tender, cut with a fork.  Maybe those negative comments cooked their pork chops instead of just browning them.  I browned the outside since it would be simmering for another 30-40 minutes.  I will also make with mashed potatoes to enjoy the gravy even more.

I enjoyed my smoothered pork chops.  May I suggest that you season your chops first. After that follow the recipe and you will enjoy tender juicy smoothered porks with a delicious gravy.

This was great. Tender. Did need some salt and pepper. And I did not cook them for as long as it says, I did 24 minutes. I like pork to be 160 degrees. Don't forget salt though!!

My family liked this.  It was pretty easy to throw together.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I did different was season the chops with some seasoning salt and put a little olive oil in the pan to saute them.

Mad this two nights ago.  My family loved it.  I used red wine instead of water just to give it some extra flavor.  Except for the weird pinkish color it was very tasty.  Next time I will use white wine.

Very good as written, exactly what a smothered chop is supposed to be. Great with brown rice.

These pork chops were very easy to make, and tasted good. I used thin pork chops, because that is all I had, and they were tasty but not as tender as I would have liked. Altogether, it made a good, quick meal that looked and tasted like you fussed. I liked the fact that the pork chops make their own gravy while they cook; this saves lots of time! I will probably make these again.

This dish is a good base recipe.  I altered it by sauteing onions and garlic in olive oil for a few minutes added 1c. of fresh mushrooms.  Threw the pork chops (seasoned w/ pepper and salt) in the pan and browned both sides, deglazed pan w/ 1/4c. of sherry, then added, flour, broth and gravy browning stuff.  Also added a few splashes of worcestershire. Cooked on low about an hour or so.

This recipe was not to bad.  The gravy was not as flavorful as I would have liked.  I added a beef bouillon cube after thickening.  The browning sauce-I could only find something called "seasoning sauce"-was dark in color but didn't darken the gravy much at all.  Just ok-probably won't try again.

This is such an easy little recipe and required so few ingredients that it was quick to prepare, the longest was the wait for it to tenderize. I used pork loin boneless chops which didn't get tender after even 50 min of cooking and they were for hubby's lunch so I didn't have time to let them simmer any longer. The gravy was too thick and I had to thin it with some more broth. On the plus side it made more than enough to serve with mashed potatoes or biscuits too. The gravy could have used a little boost for flavor, but I'm not certain what it needed, maybe some mushrooms? Overall, worth another try with a better piece of pork. Thanks for the recipe Jana.

This is a good "base" recipe, but I felt like it needed some help.  I added salt/pepper and a dash of garlic powder before browning.  To the gravy I added a splash of red wine, more garlic powder, celery salt, a tsp of crisco, and an extra 1/2 cup of chicken stock.  It turned out great over rice and with a side of yellow squash.

My gravy was beautiful in appearance but had little flavor.  This could easily be corrected by seasoning the chops with your favorite herbs before browning and doubling up on the onion.

This was good, but not spectacular enough for me to say I'd make again.  It was missing a little something.  Perhaps if I do make it again, I'll add some wine to the sauce.  I used cornstarch as per some suggestions.  I would definitely give this recipe a try.. as you can see many loved it.  Most times it may be a matter of taste.

OMG THIS WAS SOOOOO GOOD!!
I used a little butter to saute the onion and garlic (only 2 cloves not 4 and minced and only half an onion coarsley chopped) and put some salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the chops when I browned them, but other than that i followed the recipe. Everyone chowed it down!! I don't understand where people said theirs was bland??? It was so flavorful, and awesome with mashed potatoes and green beans! My boyfriend must have said "Mmmmm-mm" about 5 times! My picky daughter even loved it, I caught her dipping her pork chop in the gravy!!   What a great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing! This will become a regular at my house!

This is a very good recipe with something added for more flavor. I browned my chops  both sides,first, removed, then did added the onions,(shallot coz I had it) garlic, chicken stock, s & p, and a splash of red wine for flavor and thickened it. Then added back chops, covered and cooked for 20 minutes. They were very moist and delish. And yes, it does make lots of sauce. A family favorite!

This is a good base recipe, but to add more flavor be sure to season the chops well and add about 1/4 cup of diced green bell pepper, a little worstershire sauce, black pepper and a few drops of hot pepper sauce. Serve over hot Uncle Ben's Rice.

Sooo good. I made this exactly as the recipe stated other than using 1/4 cup flour rather than 1/3 cup and I omitted the browning sauce, but added a splash of Worchestire sauce. I cooked my porkchops for 45 minutes because they were pretty thick. I think next time I'll just do 30 minutes though. The gravy was amazing! I served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus spears. Hubby kept saying, "god this is good!".

This is a good recipe, especially as it is plain so you can tweak it anyway you want.  Tonight, I replaced the water with white wine and added dill to the gravy.  It tasted great with mashed potatoes.  I also used worchestershire sauce as suggested in another review, gave it a bit more of a kick.  The chops were tender and moist.  Thanks.

These were good, fairly tender.  However, I added salt and pepper to "pep" it up a bit.  Will fix again.

I just made this recipe. I was skeptical from everyone saying it was bland, chops were tough and the gravy was thin or to thick.  I followed the directions to the letter and it was AWESOME!  Chops fell apart they were so tender and my picky boyfriend even loved it, no problems with gravy either.

We thought these were okay. They were a little bland even with using seasoning salt and pepper. It made a nice gray but it still was bland. The gravy was great over mashed potatoes. Will make again but will need to jazz it up a bit.

Thank you for a pork chop recipe that does NOT include cream of mushroom soup!!! Family really enjoyed these chops and I loved the gravy! I salt and peppered the chops before browning them in vegetable oil (instead of cooking spray), removed them to oven safe dish, then sauteed the onions. I didn't have browning sauce (not really sure I know what it is) so I added flour to the oil and onions and cooked for a minute and then added the broth and water to make the gravy. I poured the gravy over the chops and baked covered about 1 hour in a 300 degree oven. I needed my stove top for other dishes or else I would have cooked them on the stove top. Tasty as it was, I would still like to find browning sauce and use it.

Although I used basically the same ingredients, I prepared these chops in a different way.  1. I sauteed the chopped onion and removed it from the skillet, 2. I coated the chops with flour (some seasoning salt added) and browned them in olive oil, 3. added the onions back to the skillet along with about 1/2 cup of water, a tsp of chicken granules and a tsp of worchestershire sauce, 4. covered and simmered for about 30 minutes.  Served the pork with cajun roasted sweet potatoes.  Very tender and flavorful.

Made a few changes: Dredged the pork chops in flour, seasoned with season salt, dried onion and garlic (making it even quicker to prepare!) Browned chops in hot olive oil in skillet. Dusted with onion soup mix, added enough white wine to nearly cover the chops; simmered covered for about 35 minutes. (Added water to thin gravy) I'll make this one again.

The first time I cooked this, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was good then but a little bland.

Tonight, I switched it up a little.  First, I browned the pork chops (Center Cut Pork Loin was what I had in the freezer.)  The chops were seasoned with Tony Chachere's, black pepper, celery powder, and garlic powder. (I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand.)  After browning the chops, I put them aside and sauted the onion and a green bell pepper. Then I put the chops in and followed the rest of the recipe.  The brown gravy mix I used is the Tony Chachere's brown gravy mix.  The seasoning and the brown gravy powder added just the right amount of spice to the gravy and pork chops.  I served it with French Bread, corn on the cob, and rice.  The family loved it and my husband raved.  Will definitely make it again.

Nothing outta this world in my opinion but my children ate it up with sheer gusto and my 8year old (who ate twice as much as usual) asked for it again. This will have to go down into kid favorites. I would rate it a 3 my husband gave it a 4 and my son a 5, I'm sure my 2 1/2 yr old daughter would have given it a 5 if she understood allrecipes =). I didnt have any browning sauce so I used worcestershire sauce and some brown gravy mix from a packet.

I had no problems like others seemed to have with this recipe. I scaled it down for 2, browned my pork chops with my regular seasonings for about 5 minutes a side then pulled them. Browned some onion and garlic, added flour until it was browned..then added my broth, made a tasty gravy! Put pork chops back in for 10 minutes covered and done!

This was so simple and sooo good. It's different than how my mom made it growing up, but I'm always up for a new twist on an old favorite. The pork was so tender we could cut it with forks. The gravy was delicious served over rice. The perfect recipe for when you need comfort food.

Too Good.  I used garlic roasted chicken broth and added a little extra water.  I also seasoned the pork with seasoned salt and pepper prior to browning.  It was "awesome" according to my family!  Will make again for sure.

Tasted great.  Discovered that if you change the servings to 3 on the website, it changes everything EXCEPT the can of chicken broth.  I think mine was way too runny because I didn't pay attention to the way the site changed the recipe.  Added a little paprika and used soy instead of browning sauce.  For 3 pork chops, I only simmered for 25 minutes.

This will be on rotation at my house regularly! Tasty and simple enough to make on a weeknight.  Our changes: seasoned the onions and garlic with some salt, cooked until tender and then reserved half of it on the side (I didn't think the pork chops would fit with all the onion still in the pan); seasoned the pork chops with rosemary, garlic salt and fresh ground pepper; browned on both sides, moving the onions still in the pan so it wouldn't brown too well; added the rest of the onion with the sauce mixture.  It was delicious!  Served with white steamed rice and green beans.

We really liked this recipe!  I was a little skeptical about the large amount of onions but yum!  It all made sense in the final product. The Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce gave it rich color and taste. I made extra sauce and put all over herb seasoned rice.  Tender & delicious!

These were really good!  I added rosemary as suggested by previous reviewers.  I didn't give it the full 5 stars because they weren't as tender as they might have been if I cooked them longer

No complaints here!  My family LOVED this.  I couldn't wait to finish it the next day.  I did add some parsley so I could enjoy the onion and garlic without the lingering effects on my breath later.

I have not a clue what browning sauce is, so I browned my chops first and then added the onion/garlic to the drippings.  At the end I added salt, pepper, and some rosemary.  This was excellent- gravy was great on mashed pot.

Very, very, very good example of home cooking as it should be done.  Our "picky" son, cleaned his plate (rarely happens, if ever).  The sauce is excellent and could easily be used with many entree and side dishes.

I set out to make this recipe exactly as directed and by the time I was finished it turned out somewhat different.  Such is cooking.  I didn't have any browning sauce so I browned the pork chops really well and set them aside.  As I was cooking the onions and garlic I thought of the package of mushrooms I had in the fridge and figured they would go well.  So I added am 8 oz package of sliced white mushrooms.  Much to my chagrin, I only had just over 1/2 cup of chicken stock. Instead of using water alone, I used 1/2 cup of apple juice and topped it up with water.  Lots of salt and pepper too.

It came out amazing!  I served it with some home fries and peas and corn.

Pretty good but next time I'd use a little less garlic...which is weird cause I LOVE garlic. I found though that it was too overpowering in this particular recipe.  Also I'll try beef broth instead of chicken, but overall a good recipe.  One more thing, watch it carefully or you'll overcook the chops like I did.

Wonderful!  I served them over rice.  The gravy was to die for!  I read the other reviews, and was concerned about the dish being too bland, so I added 1/4 tsp. thyme to the chicken broth mixture.  Perfect!!  I have made these several times, and I always end up with a ton of gravy leftover - makes for wonderful sauce for meatballs!  Just mix up 1 lb. ground beef or turkey, 3/4 cup breadcrumbs, 1 beaten egg, 1 Tbl. worchestershire sauce, 1 Tbl. dried minced onions (or 1/2 of a chopped fresh onion), 1 tsp. minced garlic, 3/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  Simmer in heated up sauce for 20 minutes.  Voila, another dinner!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I wish there were ten stars for this recipe! These pork chops were to die for! I don't know where some of you went wrong but, my gravy had all kinds of flavor and so did the chops! Maybe it's the onions and garlic....I have made these at least ten times and they were great everytime!

I added some Worchestershire sauce, a bit of Tabasco, and a little onion powder and salt to the gravy mixture. It was so good we were scraping our plates. But if you add the Worchestershire, be sure to cut back on the browning sauce or it will be VERY dark.

I sauteed 2 cups sliced mushrooms with onion and garlic, used 1/2 cup white wine in place of water and added some pasley.  Chops were tender, sauce was very thick, but overall taste was kind of bland for me. I will make it again and experiment.

I browned the chops first, then removed them from the pan while I cooked the onions and garlic. Then added the things for the gravy (I probly made 4 x the amount called for) added 1 tbsp Worcestershire too then put the chops and their juices in the gravy, covered it, and cooked real low for about an hour. Oh and I used water instead of chicken broth, the Worcestershire sauce gives it plenty of flavor.

I read that it was bland so when I was browning the chops I also seasoned them with some johnnys and it turned out great and if it's too thick just add some more water... It's simple and the wife and kid loved it

I love this recipe and so does my family.  I always add a little salt and pepper to my chops before frying them and since I never remember to buy browning sauce I use a few shakes of soy sauce instead, comes out great!

This recipe was a great  recipe. I added salt pepper and garlic powder to the chops before frying. I also tripled the gravy recipe to cover chops as they simmered. It need more gravy mixture and then we finally had enough to cover chops . But it was really tasty and I will use it again.

The flavor was good - just needed a little extra salt and pepper for our taste.  Added a little cornstarch towards the end to thicken the sauce to a gravy.  I really like that I didn't have to fry them first. It's a repeat for us. Thanks for sharing!

These were fantastic, and thanks to the gravy, the pork chops were very juicy! I didn't have browning sauce, so I substituted low-sodium soy sauce. Delicious!!! Will be making again and again. Thank you!

A perfect and filling meal for winter months! I added a bit of rosemary to the gravy to give it extra taste. I also added some cooked mushrooms when I served the meal with rice and broccoli.  Such a tasty and easy meal.  Will make this again and again.

Excellent! My pork chops are ususally tough and or dry.  These were delicious.  I didn't have brown sauce so I used worchestire sauce.  I used marsala wine in place of water, only 2 garlic cloves and added rosemary and pepper. Served it with rice, but next time it will be with noodles.

My pork chops came out so tough and dry! I added more of the browning sauce, garlic, salt and pepper an still found the gravy to be bland. Maybe a good starting point for a nice pork recipe but it definitely needs some tweaking!

I only had 3 pork chops thawed, but I did make all of the sauce.  My husband thinks that there can never be enough gravy!!  It was okay, but a little bland. We seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.  The pork was pretty tender.  I would make this again, but would add a little more seasoning for a bit of a kick.

This recipe was wonderful. I wasn't quite sure what browning sauce was and found it in the condiments aisle next to steak seasonings and sauces.  At the end I added alittle cornstarch to thicken up the gravy alittle more. My kids gobbled it up like it was thanksgiving with mashed potatoes and gravy.  My picky husband even loved it. This recipe is keeper for rotation to our weeknight mix.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I read every review prior to making this dish, so I knew to go easy on the salt and garlic and to add my own seasonings to the pork prior to cooking.  This was an easy recipe that looks appealing, however there is way too much garlic.  I only used a half an onion (pureed in the food processor so my husband would eat it) and one clove of garlic and the garlic flavor was still overwhelming.  I also made the "mistake" of using garlic flavored chicken broth (I thought it would give the flavor more depth).  In the end my husband ate two of the chops, along with some white rice.  I ate one chop and gave the rest to our dog (he loved it).  This recipe could work, but I'd omit the garlic all together.

I made this the other night and no one was too pleased. The gravy just seemed really bland and I had to add seasonins to perk it up. On the bright side, the chops were extremely tender and delicious.

This recipe was very good.  I followed some tips of other reviewers by sauteeing the onions and garlic in 1tbsp of butter and replaced the water with white wine.  I also used salt, pepper and a seasoning salt.  The sauce thickened very nicely.  I didn't use the browning sauce, the onions carmelized and browned the sauce.

Served with mashed potatoes, this was good comfort food on a cold winter's day! I used the browning sauce and added a splash of Worcestershire sauce. I seasoned the chops with salt & pepper and added some extra pepper to the gravy. My only problem was that the garlic was in danger of burning before my chops had browned nicely. Next time I would add the garlic at the same time as the pork chops.

as others did i also tweaked this recipe a bit.i seasoned the chops with salt,pepper and season salt before browning.i also used chianti in place of the water and just a touch of steak sauce instead of browning sauce.just a pinch of fresh parsley and a bay leaf for added taste. this recipe turned out just great with a gravy to die for.also a good idea to make buns to sop up all that delicous gravy. thanks jana

We loved this recipe this evening. I used "common sense" and seasoned the pork the way I knew my husband and I would like it. I used some seasoned pepper and lite salt. I didn't have browning sauce so I used some worcestershire sauce. I wouldn't hesitate to make this substitution again. Thanks for sharing. YUM!

This was a really good recipe.  Next time I will cut back on the onions and garlic a bit because the flavor was too strong for my 5 and 6 year old.  For adults the recipe is fine as is.  I also added a fairly good amount of seasoning salt.  I think it gave it just the right flavor.  The sauce turned out wonderfully.  To save time I just threw the garlic and onions in the food processor.  I also sauteed them in about a tablespoon of butter.

I absolutely loved these smothered pork chops and so does my husband.  I rarely cook because of the newborn. But this was quick and easy and sat down most of the time while they were simmering. Great recipe and lots of taste!!!!!

2/3 of my kids loved it.  It was very easy.  It wasn’t incredibly flavorful, but it was still tasty.  I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper.  I put a dash of crushed red pepper flakes in the broth mixture.

Although I didn’t use browning sauce I did seasoned my chops with salt pepper and garlic powder before browning them I also added a little creole seasoning to the gravy for extra flavor!!!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out okay, not great. It needs more liquid in the blend of the onions, which came out a little too thick.

This was excellent!  I'll definitely be making this again.  I browned the pork chops in butter in a cast iron skillet, then removed them as another reviewer suggested before sauteing the onions and garlic.  I then added more butter to the skillet and sauteed the onions and garlic until transparent.  I had mixed the water and flour together in a mason jar, and that  added it to the skillet with the chicken broth.  I then put the chops back into the skillet and sauteed, covered, until done.  The chops were over an inch thick and they were ready within 20 minutes.  They were perfect and DELICIOUS!!

I thought it had a blah taste.  When I realized it at the end of the cooking time, I quickly added fresh thyme and rosemary which only helped a little.

Finally! A pork chop can emerge from my oven not completely dried out and inedible.  I didn't have chicken broth so beef broth worked great.

This is what my family calls "a keeper"! I had some boneless pork chops and was looking for a good recipe. I had to make some substitutions - no onions, because my husband won't eat them, and beef broth instead of chicken (because I was out of chicken broth). Some homemade mashed potatoes and fresh green beans and this meal was fantastic!

Update: I’ve made these exactly as written (correctly using browning sauce) at least a dozen times and they are soooo good! I serve with mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes and the gravy goes great. From 2/2015 -  I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews (but why would you add rosemary and Worcestershire anyway?). I misread the "browning sauce" as bullion sauce and used "better than bullion beef base" instead. Maybe a happy accident because OMG, they turned out awesome! I had super-thick chops so I let them simmer over low heat for an hour and they just fell apart. I served with smashed potatoes and from the first bite, my husband just raved and was very disappointed that we did not have more than one round of leftovers. I will make these again but will double the recipe. I'm too afraid to use browning sauce now since these turned out so well.

I was raised in a Southern family, and the way my mother and grandmother taught me was to fry the pork chops in a skillet first. Remove them from the oil, and remove the oil from the pan. Make some onion gravy in the skillet you used, and then put the chops in the gravy, and "smother" them with the gravy. We always ate ours with rice, and it's so yummy!

We enjoyed this receipe and I'll fix again.  We thought it very tasty but would add a salt and pepper to taste.  The only chops that were tough were the ones that were not completely emersed into the liquid.

This recipe is a good starting point.  I added a ton of extra seasoning based on other's reviews.  I wouldn't cook it quite as long next time.  The pork was overdone and quite dry.

I made this for supper tonight and my family just lapped it up.  I added about 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary as I am a sucker for rosemary with pork, and I didn't use as much flour as the recipe called for (I ran out, and used about 2 heaping tbsps.) The sauce was perfect in consistency for me and everything was delicious.  I was glad that I used a low sodium chicken broth as the flavours concentrated in the pan and would have been too salty for us if I had used regular.  Thanks for this recipe, it will be a staple in our house from now on!

My family loved these pork chops. I took the advice of other reviewers and seasoned the chops first (used Lawry's Season Salt). I also used minced garlic instead of fresh & served with baked potatoes and cabbage. The chops were so tender & juicy. I'll definitely make this recipe again!

This was very, very bland. I cut the onion and garlic down because I knew that my son wouldn't eat it if there were too many pieces. If you pan fryed the pork chops and added a jar of gravy it would taste the same. My son gave it 2 1/2 stars. I won't be making this again.

My husband wanted me to try something new with pork chops and I found this recipe, it was great. My 2 year old couldn't get enough of the gravy. I made mashed potatoes as a side but I would say it would go great with rice also.

Excellant recipe!  I reduced the flour to 1/4 cup, added salt, pepper and a little summer savory.  Was a big hit!

This was a real winner at my house!  Next time I'll add a little more seasoning to the chops and the gravy, it was just a tad bland.

This turned out wonderfully!  I used thinner chops (that I had to debone) and I cut the chops into smaller, just above bite-size pieces.  I seasoned them well and doctored up the gravy with extra  seasonings and a little hot sauce.  I also sauted some chopped celery with the onions and garlic.  So easy to make and customize!  I will be making this again!

This recipe is not bad. I will definitely make again- but I did adjust. Added marsala wine instead of water  and seasoned with salt and pepper. Next time I will also season with parsley. It was still good I think- a little bland for my taste but a solid recipe and quick/easy.

This recipe was very good.  My 20 month old wanted to eat and eat more!  Which she never really eats meat to begin with.  I didn't add the browning sauce (didn't have on hand) and cut the garlic in half (kids).  Still tasted great to my family.

I didn't have any browning sauce, so I used a splash of Coke.  I have no idea if it did anything, but I thought I'd be fun anyway.  The result was fantastic. My onions even caramelized during the process, which made for a fantastic surprise.  Bravo!

This was ok but nothing special.  I used some of the earlier suggestions, such as using white wine instead of water, salt & peppering the chops before browning and throwing in a can on sliced mushrooms.  Still pretty boring.

it was very good after I made a few adjustments. I agree with other reviewers when i say that the recipes as is, is a little bland. I added half a cup of dry red wine in place of the water, seasoned the chops with salt and pepper prior to browning, used worcestershire in place of the browning sauce, added a bay leaf to chops when simmering, and some chopped fresh parsley. Great base recipe!

Followed this to the tee but I am sorry to say it was very tasteless. No salt was listed in the recipe so my husband said to please add it and not to bother with this recipe again. Sorry.

I think this would turn out better if you season the pork chops to your liking before browning them so they will have a lot more flavor.

This recipie Rocks!  It is very easy and quick to prepare and my family just gobbled it up!   The meat is tender and the sauce is delicious.  (it's even more tender the following day).  It's surprising that it's so low in fat consider how delicious this tastes.  I added salt to taste and served it with mashed potoatoes and green beans.  Enjoy!

This was just OK. It wasn't terrible, it wasn't anything I will make again. I didnt have browning sauce, so I just substituted Worcestshire sauce. As mentioned in previous entries, the meat itself was quite bland.

I love this dish, and my family does too.  I make them all the time.  Here is a tip, use corn starch instead of flour, use about 1/2 the amount of corn starch and get the same results.  Thanks for a sure winner.

I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to this recipe per my aunt's suggestion.  After that, it was awesome.  I don't think that the gravy would have been good without the cream of mushroom soup so that is why I am only giving four stars.

All in all, a good meal!!  I normaly hate pork chops, but my family loves them, so I decided to try this recipe.  Since I live in Louisiana, I definitely had to season the pork chops with some cajun seasonings and added a little to the sauce.  The sauce came out great, very creamy, and you couldn't really taste the pork chops (which I liked!!).  Definitely try this if you need a quick dinner that doesn't taste quick.
