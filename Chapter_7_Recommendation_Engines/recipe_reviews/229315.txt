I used home cooked black beans and sweet potatoes that were leftovers.  I didn't have flour tortillas so I used corn and omitted the cilantro. It went over well.  I thought next time I'll increase both the onion and garlic and I might add some finely sliced fresh ginger when I saute them.  This is very filling and the leftovers make a great lunch.  Thanks, APT

I used the basic proportions, cooking up my own sweet potatoes, dried  black beans and whole wheat tortillas.  These have wonderful taste, and are easy to put together!

Delicious! Some recommendations: Use half an onion instead of a full onion. I’ve experimented a little and it’s best with purple onion. Make sure to dice it very finely or it’s kind of gross. Use 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. My boyfriend likes to add cheese.

This recipe tastes good but it smells like funeral flowers to me so I don't think I'll make it again.
