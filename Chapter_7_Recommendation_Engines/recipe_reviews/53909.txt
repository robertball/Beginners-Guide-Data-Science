This was very tasty. After looking at the other reviews I made some adjustments though...I diced up some onion and cooked it with the meat, which I seasoned with garlic salt, steak seasoning, pepper and paprika. I let my son choose between green beans and peas and he choose peas (the kids love corn so I didn't even need to ask on that one). I didn't have hash brown patties so I finished off the bag of frozen hash brown 'chunks' I had and then chopped up some frozen french fries. As I stirred it all up it seemed dry so I added a can of beef broth and let it simmer together for a few minutes. Just before serving I added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Turned out pretty darned tasty and my husband can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I added a can of zesty diced tomatoes with green chilis undrained. Instead of hashbrowns I chopped up potatoes and fried them with some oil in a skillet and then added them to the mix. I also browned the meat with 2 cloves of fresh garlic. Yummy!!

Quick & Easy is right! My family loved it, the whole batch went! I did add some onion powder to the hamburger as it was browing, gave it a little more flavor, it think. Next time I might add some shedded cheese on top. My youngest ate her's with ketchup & asked for seconds. Thank you Bill! This is a keeper!

At first, I thought this recipe sounded very bland, but I tried it with two small changes.  I used frozen hash brown potato shreds instead (all I had) and added onion to the meat when browning.  It was really good and super simple.  I will be making again when I need something quik, easy, and tasty.

EASY and good!  Ketchup on it for a topper.  Husband said too many green beans, but I liked it.  Used Creamed Corn also.  Would like to do the hash browns separate next time and serve it over them.

Ok, I didnt think this was going to turn out as the pp's agreed. I was shocked it tasted so good! My kids actually asked for seconds, something they rarely do!

I did add onions and seasonings in with the ground beef and covered with tons of shredded cheese in the pot when it was done. We love cheese.

Thought I would have lots of leftovers and there is none left!

I thought this was really just okay the first day. But the next day I enjoyed it quite a bit more. My boyfriend had no complaints at all. Definetly good with ketchup. This is a nice easy comfort meal. Thanks.

The kids call this the yucky-looking dinner that they love to eat.  It doesn't look like much, but it does taste good.  It is also great meal when there isn't much left in the pantry.

This was awesome!  I like the "back to basic" taste of this.  I did add onions to the mix.  Very yummy, and a kid pleaser for sure!

This was super easy and my "meat and potatoes" family really liked it.  I added some beef boullion (maybe 1 1/2 to 2 cups) to give a little more flavor.  I think I will top it off with shredded cheese next time.  Very good!

This recipe matched what I had in the freezer last night so I thought I'd give it a go and I was very pleasantly surprised!
I did change it a bit - I cooked the hash browns first, used Quorn mince (vegetarian), added a green pepper and, because quorn is a bit drier than meat, I added some BBQ sauce.

This was good for a quick and easy meal. I used country style hashbrowns instead. All the kids loved it with katchup! I have also made this with cream corn instead and it was really good too, kind of a stove top shepards pie.

I thought this was great, especially considering how easy it was to make. It was a little bland so I had to add more salt and pepper when I ate. But, it was still really good.  I also added onion soup mix to the beef and shreded hash browns.  I will make this again.

I think that the recipe as it stands is a little bland, but with onions added, it helped.  I'll do this again and add a little more flavor in some form or fashion.  It certainly is a very quick and easy recipe, though.  My best advice would be not to take it at its face value - add things you think you'll enjoy, because it will likely blend in quite nicely.

None of the 5 people in my family liked this recipe. I thought it was very bland tasting and not much to it. Sorry, this recipe wasn't for us.
