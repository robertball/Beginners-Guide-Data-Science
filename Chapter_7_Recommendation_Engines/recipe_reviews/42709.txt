These are very good though for years friends and family have complained that pickled eggs are rubbery so I decided with these to let the mixture cool before adding to eggs. This time everyone was very happy as the eggs were much easier for them to eat. The recipe is great if you like mustard. Their was no change in favor from hot to cool either.

I made some of these earlier this week and just pulled out a couple last night.  They were excellent!  However, I think you have to be partial to vinegar and mustard to really appreciate them.. they are a little tart for some people:)

I made these exact to the recipe, it was time i'd made pickled eggs. They looked slightly wierd, sat in a murky brown-yellow liquid. And when i removed the first one to try was amazed by how bright yellow they had turned. They tasted great and the contrast between the yellow surface, pure white albumen and yellow yolk is fantastic. Highly recommended to impress with a buffet or as a present

I made these yesterday and had to try one today.  I've never had pickled eggs before; these taste great and look terrific.  I increased the sugar to 1/4 cup and only used 1 cup vinegar (I used small eggs).

Thought this one was going to be bland, but after pickling for about 4 days they were egg-cellent.  I will up the sugar a bit for my next batch.  I found that 10 large eggs fit into a quart jar, and the brine was enough for two quart jars.

I love the ones I used to be able to buy locally in PA, I have been looking for this recipe and was not disappointed!  I made the recipe as is and after tasting, added more sugar and mustard.  With the right balance of ingredients these taste like egg salad to me.  Thanks!

If you like vinegar and mustard, these are to die for, if you don't, then I'm not sure why you would make this recipe. I love both, so this is it..heaven in a jar.

Did this with 58 eggs.  I cooled the mixture a bit as to keep the eggs from getting rubbery.  I also added a bit of minced garlic to give it a extra little kick.  Turned out exellent.

GORGEOUS COLOR!  My father never liked pickled eggs, but loves these!  They have a nice tart taste, so some may want to add more sugar (my father loves them the way the recipe is).

I let these sit about 2 weeks before sampling - the tangy picked flavor got all the way through to the yolks.  They have a nice balance of vinegar and mustard flavors, with a touch of sweet to mellow it out.  I think I'll try adding some garlic next time.
  
I crowded my eggs in a jar that's a little too small, so my eggs have white spots.  They are still delicious, though!

These are beautiful when taken out of the jar-so bright yellow-I wish I could get our Easter Eggs that color!  The are strong-but if people like mustard and pickled foods, they'll LOVE them.  If not a fan of either, just look at them and enjoy!

After reading the previous reviews, I decided to tweak the recipe before trying it for the first time.  "Too vinegary" being a common complaint, I reduced the vinegar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the sugar to 1/4 cup....also added 3 halved fresh jalapeno peppers to the jars....AWESOME!  They really need to sit for at least a week, before all the flavors start popping...

Gorgeous color and flavor.  For the life of me I don't know why many of the friends I teach with cringle when I bring in a jar of eggs to keep in the refrigerator for lunch.

I love pickled eggs and have many different recipes of them! I rank this among the very best! Great taste, really hits the spot. Friends love them too! As others recommended I cooled the liquid before adding the eggs. Since I'm on a low Sodium diet I didn't use any salt. They were fantastic! I'll be making these a lot in the feature! Thanks for a great recipe!

I love these pickled eggs!  For a variation to it simply try adding 
sliced onion when you put the eggs in the mix.  You get some of the flavor of the onions in the eggs but the pickled onions are good too.  I don't understand the comments on "too vinegary" that's what happens when you put eggs in vinegar!  I guess living and growing up in Pa. Dutch Country this is what is what you expect.  I recommend this recipe.

Not the best out there for mustard eggs - too much vinegar, not enough mustard and the cornstarch is a waste.

I tried these and did not like them, too vinegary, however I gave them to two people at work one LOVED them and the other didn't like them. Guess you have to love a strong vinegar flavor.

Followed the this and found that the recipe would probably benefit from diluting with water 50/50.  Also, the cornstarch made this murky sludge that i had to shake or it settled, i'm going to skip it next time.
