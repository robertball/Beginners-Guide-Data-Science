This was really good. However my whole family hunts so we have a lot of wild meat. (which is the healthiest for you) The way we prepare our venison and elk steaks is the way we would do a beef steak, We spead it with olive oil,using a pastry brush, shake on our seasonings,let set about ten minutes, place them on the preheated grill seasoned side down, brush top side with olive oil and shake on seasonings. Only grill each side for 5 - 8 minutes, You never want to overcook wild game. It comes out delicious this way and very moist, (unless you overcook it) Wild game has not got a lot of fat, it is very lean and very healthy because of that. Some people feel, that because it is wild, it needs to be cooked a long time, not true! Rare to med rare is the best for wild game.

I loved this recipe!  the coating was crispy, the meat succulent and tender, and the gravy was divine.  I am not a fan of chicken fried recipes, but this almost reminded me of a schnitzel, and was heavenly in every mouthful!

I thought this recipe was great!  the breadcrumb/cornmeal mix was yummy and the carmelized onion was tasty and nice for presentation.  I served over white rice and doubled the milk for the gravy since I had plenty of bread crumb mixture left.  husband said it was interesting and different (than other chicken fried venison he'd had) but definitely good.  I would even try frying veggies in this mix.  I did think the egg/milk mixture was a little runny and I would have liked to taste more of the pepper sauce so I'd cut back on the milk there next time.

Oh, Deer!! These were fantastic steaks. Tender and tasty. I don't usually measure unless I'm baking but opted to do so with this recipe as it was my first time cooking venison and I didn't want to screw this up. I made a salt water brine and soaked my venison steaks for 4 hours prior to preparing them.  I had 4 steaks and barely had enough of the breading mixture for all 4, so there wasn't any left for the gravy. Cooked these in my electric skillet at 325 degrees, 4 minutes per side and didn't crowd the skillet (that lowers the oil's temperature and affects your final outcome) I've never caramelized onions in hot oil, so I skipped that part. I caramelize using the low and slow method. I opted to make a simple bechamel sauce since I had no bread crumbs left. This was loved by the whole family and I tell you....I don't want another plain ol' chicken fried steak. I want mine to be made with venison from now on. Thanks so much for this recipe and for showing my husband that deer meat can be delicious when cooked properly.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years.  I don't use cornmeal and instead bread the steaks with flour.  I also make plain white gravy.  Mashed potatoes on the side is excellant.  Everyone in my family loves this dish.

Everything was very tastey and since I field dress and butcher my own deer, you couldn't even tell that it was venison.   For the hot sauce, I used sirachi.  It's the perfect heat without an overwhelming hot sauce taste.

I toasted the remaining crumbs and used the left over egg/milk mixture plus some additional milk to make the gravy.   The flavor was fine but the texture wasn't right.  Too gritty.  I might use a little of the bread crumb mixture along with some flour the next time I make this dish.

I am always looking for new recipes for venison, my kids wouldn't know what beef tastes like. Once done cooking the onions I put them in a separate bowl because my son loves gravy but hates onions. Then, we were able to add however much onions that we wanted to our steaks. This is a keeper in our family.

A new recipe for the menu rotation.  We have LOTS of deer meat (that's the way we say it in the Ozarks) in the freezer.  Never know what to do with ham steaks.  Great!  I just used regular flour for the gravy...didn't have any of the breadcrumb/cornmeal left after dredging.  Good flavor.  Didn't change a thing.

Very good! This was a different way to prepare the vinison cube steak I had and we all loved it. The gravy came out really thick but I just added more milk to the mixture. I will be using this recipe again here soon!

I followed this pretty closely and it is pretty much inedible. Way too much cornmeal and the gravy turned out thick as paste. I have to find something else for dinner now.

Family went nuts for this recipe - I am not the biggest fan of venison but I do like saving money when they get a deer.  This made it much more tolerable for me to eat.  I am sure I will make this again and again.

Pretty good. Almost like fish fry batter. I can't make gravy to save my life so we left it in the pan. Pretty sure it would have been a little plain. I liked it better than the think and greasy crust that most chicken fried steaks have but my husband prefers the crust that feels like you swallowed a brick. Thanks for the recipe.

This is definitely a filling winter weather meal! I used white/wheat flour in place of the cornmeal (using what I had on hand), I also used canola oil in place of the veg oil and used onion powder in place of the sliced onion (boyfriend won't touch onions!). The meal came out great and I would try again!

I have a pound of venison sausage thawing out for dinner tomorrow night. Do you think that I could use this recipe? I love chicken fried anything and I think I could make this work.

Super tender, I did use cholula and added a little extra! The gravy was a little thick but still great flavor and not too salty!

My husband loved our fresh, fresh, fresh venison when I prepared venison steak according to this recipe. However, he added more hot (Louisiana cayenne pepper) sauce to it as he was eating. So, for people like my husband, double the hot sauce addition. For those of us with more tender palates, the amount called for is just fine.

Thank you deer cook, it was delicious! We used masa instead of cornmeal because that was what we had and it was great.  We will be making this until out freezer is empty!

My husband tried this recipe.  The breaded venison was very good and the gravy was tasty. The only negative comment is that the gravy is ugly - ugly - ugly.  It was thick and lump. We will bread the venison again, but not make that gravy.
