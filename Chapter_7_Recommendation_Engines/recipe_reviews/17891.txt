This is excellent cornbread!  I use 1/3 c. white and 1/3 c. brown sugar, and I let the cornmeal soak in the milk for 10-15 minutes before mixing with the other ingredients.  I've also replaced the vegetable oil with melted butter, which works very well.

Well, needles to say, you'd sure be hard pressed to come up with a better cornbread recipe.  It's excellent!  Suberb! I've read all 84 + reviews and have learned the following additional options:  I can bake it in a muffin pan (bake only 15 minutes); I can cut back on my sugar to maybe a round 1/2-cup (or less).  I can add just a smidgen more salt.  I can add a 1/2 t. vanilla.  Add I can also add just a little bit more oil (so it's not quite so crumbly).  The next time I bake this for our gang, I'm going to add all of the above -- I'll be bold and daring!

This works as cornbread muffins, too!  I am not a huge fan of making cornbread as a round or square cake shape… they just are too messy that way.  Instead I like to pour the batter into muffin tins lined with cupcake/muffin papers.  This recipe works great as muffins.  I pour the batter almost to the very top of the paper liners then I bake this at 375 degrees, but I have a convection oven so the heat is usually 25 degrees less than the normal temperature… so you can cook it at the suggested heat of 400 degrees with a normal oven.  It takes 20-23 minutes for a toothpick to come out clean.  The tops are always nicely browned and the muffins are perfectly cooked.  The only other minor change I make is I use a medium grind cornmeal that is a little more course.  It makes the cornbread more like a true “comfort food”.  If you don’t like that extra crunch then use a finer grind.  EVERYONE loves this- it is always on request from my guests and family,  “Can you make your special cornbread?”  It only takes about 5 minutes if you use a stand mixer.  Very easy and very yummy!  People will love that you made this from scratch.  Oh yeah, and for you calorie nuts: I have calculated that if you make 12 muffins out of this batter, it runs about 180 calories per muffin or 2160 for the whole batch.

Made this as-written and it was delicious! Very moist, great texture, and just the right amount of sweetness. You will not be disappointed! *Side note:  I dont understand why people change the recipe and take away stars from their rating based on that. Make the recipe as-is and then decide. Dont give a bad rating based on changes you made or how you THINK it would have turned out.

This is THE best cornbread recipe. Look no further!! I did cut down on the sugar a little. (It's still sweet) Delicious with butter and honey on it. Fantastic accompaniment to soup or stew or beans or even makes a great breakfast!

This is the best cornbread ever!!!  It's so easy to make too.  I did use 1/3 Cup powdered milk and 1 Cup water for the milk to save money.  I also used canola oil instead of the vegetable oil.  I didn't like cornbread very much until I found this recipe.

Awesome cornbread!  I used melted butter instead of oil and lowfat buttermilk vs. milk.  It was light, fluffy and went great with ribs and the left overs were great for breakfast.

After reading some of the previous reviews, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and the baking powder to 2 tsp.  The muffins baked well and tasted good... not extraordinary... but good.

I followed the recipe except I added a generous amount of black pepper and cooked it in an 8" cast iron skillet (which increased the cooking time somewhat).  We thought it was wonderful!  Nice and moist and just sweet enough.  I will say technique does help. It really does make a difference using a cast iron skillet. Grease it generously, but not too much or your bread will crumble.  Preheat your oven and put the cast iron skillet in before you start making the cornbread.  It needs 10-15 minutes to get good and hot.  You want to hear that "sizzle" when you pour the batter in.  That makes a wonderful crust on the outside with a nice moist bread on the inside!  When making the mix, whisk your dry ingredients together to make sure everything is evenly distributed. Then mix your wet ingredients together (just whisk with a fork) in a separate bowl before adding them to the dry ingredients.  Don't beat the mixture to death, just mix and fold gently till everything is wet. Then let it sit for 5 minutes before pouring into the nice hot cast iron skillet...yum!

Great cornbread! I always place 2 T. of butter in glass 8 in. square pan (after greasing the pan), place in oven until butter is sizzling, then pour the batter in and finish baking- it makes a nice crunchy outside to your cornbread!

I live in Australia and have always wanted to try this thing called cornbread. I followed the recipe exactly and really loved what came out of the oven. I don't have anything to compare it to but I will ask some of my American friends if I made it right. I know it tasted fantastic. thanks

Oh my goodness--this is wonderful! Absolutely better than boxed mix (and without that funny little aftertaste you get from boxed cornbread).  This is the only cornbread recipe I will ever need.  If you like sweet cornbread rather than unsweetened cornbread and you're looking for a good recipe, look no more--this is the one! I read some reviews that noted cumbliness, so I added a little extra vegetable oil (very little extra--I just let the measuring cup overflow a tad). Also, I cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon rather than 1 teaspoon.  I don't know if that's the reason, but it turned out super moist without any crumbling apart whatsoever--just those few cornbread crumbs that fall as you slice.  Perfection!!! Thank you!!!!

Made the recommended modifications, and it turned out FANTABULOUS. I soaked the cornmeal for about 8 minutes which is about the time it takes for you to get the other ingredients and heat the oven; used 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp of baking powder. The 2/3 cup of sugar is perfect. If you don't like it sweet use 1/2 cup.  I did it that way as well one time but I like sweetness. As one reviewer stated and I am repeating. This is the BEST one here. Trust me, I did several taste tests with people over and over and over and over. THIS IS THE ONE.  I just had some and it is "MOIST" not crumbly. Boy, I better go and do some walking now!! ENJOY and you don't have to waste anymore ingredients on another cornbread recipe, I already did it for you.

I used a bit less than the called for 2/3 cup sugar, melted butter instead of oil, 3/4 cup buttermilk & 1/4 water (per my husband's Nannie - she said never use all milk), baked in an iron skillet, and MAN is this good stuff.  I'm no expert on cornbread, but this is delicious!

**Update** I've been making this for over a year now and have found new ways to use it. For corn muffins, don't use paper liners. Instead, use cooking spray and be generous. Then pour the batter right in. Your muffins will have a nice crisp browned crust. Yum! I also jazz the muffins by adding leftover pulled pork or (in mini-muffins) bits of hot dogs. The pulled pork muffins are amazing, thanks Chef John! Keep mustard on hand for dipping mini corn dog muffins, Kids gobble them up. Both are major winners! ** Original review - Made this tonight, subbing a combo of GF baking mix and GF bread flour for the AP flour. Everything else per recipe. Whole family loved it. DH loves Marie Callendar cornbread and said this is one I need to make again. BTW - I'm the only one who eats gluten free, the rest of the pack, DH, DS, DDIL and grands are all wheat-eaters. Even the 2 yr-old loved it. A definite winner. Thank you!

WOW! My hubby is a self described corn bread snob from the south and he LOVED this!

I followed others suggestions too:
for the sugar 1/3 C white and 1/3 C brown. I substituted the oil for melted butter and i added 3 tablespoons of honey. i also let the cornmeal soak in the milk for 15 minutes and baked the cornbread in a seasoned cast iron pan. OMG heaven!

This was super easy to make, but I could taste the baking powder. It was overpowering, but curable with a drizzle of honey. I'd like to try this again, but next time around, I'll cut down the baking powder to 2 tsp.

I followed the recipe, except used corn flour rather then all-purpose.  Very good, had a nice amount of "gritty" feeling to it, not too sweet, very easy to make, great color and overall look, and nice mild corn flavor.  Only minor complaint is that it was rather crumbly and fell apart easily.

The only reason I didn't give a full five stars was that the texture was crumbly; otherwise, this recipe makes an excellent, moderately sweet cornbread.  I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of baking it in a 10" cast iron skillet. I let the empty skillet heat up in the oven as it preheated and made sure the oven temp got up to 400 (I have an oven thermometer -- so should you). Then, I melted a little butter in the skillet to coat it, and poured in the batter. This resulted in a very nice, crunchy brown crust and a moist interior -- just the way I like it.  I baked the cornbread for exactly 20 minutes, but wonder if I could have gone for even less time, thanks to the heat-retaining cast iron.  Next time, I will modify this recipe by (1) heating the milk to scalding and soaking the cornmeal in it, and (2) adding an egg to the recipe.  One final note: I used the full amount of baking powder, but used an aluminum-free brand. Perhaps the reason people have reported off-flavors is not because of using too much baking powder, but because they are using baking powder that contains aluminum and gives a bitter flavor to baked goods anyway.

No matter how full people are, this cornbread always disappears from the table!  I never have leftovers of this wonderful bread!

So delicious! Recipe was perfect as it. I just added a bag of thawed, frozen corn kernels to give it a little more texture.

I went ahead and decreased the baking powder to 2 1/2 teaspoons after reading other reviews, and it turned out just great.  I LOVED this cornbread! It is not "cakey" sweet like many mixes.  Really moist and delicious.

Loved this recipe! I substituted apple sauce for the oil and used half white/half brown sugar.  I also added a half cup pureed cauliflower.  My 13 year old daughter said it was really creamy and yummy.  She doesn't usually like corn bread.  My 4 year old son couldn't get enough of it!

Super sweet easy cornbread recipe!  I've been looking for a sweet cornbread recipe for a while and never found one that was as good as my husband's granny's cornbread.  Although it was delicious, it was almost too sweet.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar a bit to adjust to our taste, but otherwise - fabulous!!

I read all the  reviews on this recipes and took them at heart. I lowered the sugar to 1/2 cup, 1/4 cup white & 1/4 cup brown sugar. Then cut it back even further to use Splenda sugars. Cut the baking soda down to 2 tsp. and soaked the corn meal in the milk and used the butter instead of veg. oil. Baked them in a muffin pan and got 12 muffins. Husband and I just loved them. Gave the recipes 5 stars even with the changes.

I have been searching for a sweet cornbread recipe.  In the south most cornbread is not very sweet.  I was very happy to find one I really liked.  Reminds me of the cornbread at Boston Market.  A good and moist meal side dish and filling!  With the round cake pan, sprayed with some cooking spray, it cuts nicely into triangles when cool. I really prefer this one also because it has baking powder making the texture nice and soft.  Thank you submitter!

PERFECT exactly as written.  Super easy and delicious- moist, sweet, great texture.  I have made this many times and passed along the recipe to several others- everyone loves this!  I've used plain skim milk, evaporated milk, and buttermilk (due to what I had on hand); I've made this in cake pans, pie plates, an iron skillet, and as muffins- every version was great!  If you love sweet cornbread, this is the go-to recipe for your file.  Thank you, bluegirl!  :)

I've been using another cornbread recipe on this site for about a year now (Sweet Corn Bread) that is excellent and moist, but it calls for sour cream.  I wanted to find a good corn bread recipe that wouldn't require that ingredient but still be just as good.  This is the recipe!  It was great- very fluffy and moist.  I tried the Homesteader cornbread recipe last week and it was good, but not as good as this!

I thought this would be a great starter recipe for cornbread and I was right.  I only changed the amount of sugar I put in since my husband doesn't like sweets.  I put in 1/3C sugar and coated the bottom of my pan with vegetable oil and it came out great with the right amount of moistness and only slightly crumbly.

I didn't have any cornmeal but I really wanted cornbread with my chili FAST. So I used this recipe as a guideline and threw together what I had. I LOVED it, and so did my family! I will make it the "fake" way again cause it was so good. I used the same recipe as here except with a few substitutions. Instead of 1 c flour and 1 c cornmeal, I used 1 1/3 c flour and 1/3 cup of MALT-O-MEAL!! WOW! It was great, I never would have thought it would turn out so good. I even used maple flavored because that it what I had, wonderful! I added 1/3 cup of white corn, some cardamom, and white pepper. I reduced the vegetable oil by half. I also added a tbsp of honey. I baked it in a buttered muffin pan. It baked for only 25 minutes before it was done to a toothpick test, but my oven is wacky so you might want to keep an eye on it. I highly recommend trying it this way if, like me, you almost always have malt-o-meal and never have any cornmeal around.

My family really like this. This is the closest I've found to Hoggy's BBQ Restaurant. Very moist and cakelike. I changed it a little by using buttermilk and also added 1 cup of canned corn. My 2 year old and 4 year old couldn't get enough. I only used a little under a 1/2 cup of sugar, but I think 2/3 cup would have been fine. Thanks for a great cornbread recipe.

It is so quick and easy to make. I don't want it to be very sweet, so I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and it came out with the wonderful original taste of the cornmeal.

WOW. That's really all I can say. When I was a kid, this type of delicious cornbread was a common staple where I lived in southern Jersey. I was a child, and so I naively thought all cornbread was the same. Sadly, I was mistaken, and when I moved to Georgia when I was 9, I was introduced to Southern Cornbread. It was dry and salty and tasted more like I was chewing on a dirt clod than anything else. At first, I thought maybe it was just a bad batch, but from the way everyone was raving over it, I quickly realized that the Southerners have an extremely different taste than I do. I thought this type of cornbread was lost to me forever, but I am SO GLAD to have been mistaken! THANK YOU. No longer will I have to suffer through politely eating that disgusting clump of dough they dare to call cornbread at church functions. Now I can show them how cornbread is SUPPOSED to taste: good.

I wish I could give this recipe something like 4 1/2 stars, because I really loved it. The sweetness was perfect (tasted the batter and it was SWEET; I was worried, but the finished bread was fantastic). It was nice and moist, and the directions and baking time were spot on. My only issue is that the bread was almost too fluffy, which resulted in it also being pretty crumbly. I'll decrease the baking powder a bit next time and see what happens. At any rate - We ate it slathered with butter and honey, and even though we had to eat it with forks because of the crumble factor, it was divine.

Super cornbread! Finally found a recipe to match the taste of the corn muffins one finds in donut shop chains. I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla which put this recipe over the top.

Everyone loves this cornbread - I used Splenda for my brother who is watching his sugar intake, soy milk for my son who has a dairy allergy and unsweetened applesauce instead of oil for my father-in-law who has to follow a heart-healthy diet. 

Also took others advice - added an extra egg and reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp.

Awesome, sweet and moist. I usually double the recipe because it is always GONE.

Delicious. 24 minutes was perfect for me. The trick to moist cornbread is to top it off with honey in a crosshatch pattern (you can reduce the sugar in the actual recipe if it makes it too sweet, but I like it sweet). This will keep the cornbread moist for another day. YUM! Great with chili, great alone! Thank you.

Just finished making this (this happens to be my first time making cornbread ever, as it's not well-known here- you can't even find it anywhere in restaurants).  Anyhow, I'm on a dairy and egg-free diet and a restricted wheat diet, so I substituted the AP flour for Gluten-free flours from Bob's Red Mill (garbanzo bean, rice, sorghum, potato flours, etc) and 1 tsp of vital wheat gluten (I know it's wheat, but it's only 1 tsp as opposed to an entire cup), unsweetened soy milk and 1/4 cup silken tofu for the egg. I also used a rounded 1/2 cup sugar, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and very slightly more than 1/3 cup oil (I used grapeseed so it would be a lighter oil, since non-wheat flours can have a hard time rising properly).  Took it out of the oven at 25 minutes and the edges were browned nicely and crunchy, but not burnt at all and it had risen very well, looked just like regular light and fluffy wheat flour when I cut into it. I couldn't help myself and took a first piece while it was still steaming hot. Scrumptious! Maybe the only thing I would do next time is add the normal amount of sugar if I wanted it a bit sweeter, but as it is, it has a very mild sweetness and a very pleasant texture. The odd time you can feel a bit of the cornmeal grainy texture, but that's half the fun of eating it, I think. I finished off the entire row I cut into in one sitting. I will definitely make this again, and the recipe is so easy and almost fool-proof it seems.

This is by far the BEST cornbread recipe I have ever tried!  There is a local county fair that gives away fresh stone-ground corn in the fall.  I keep it in the freezer and that is what I use in the cornbreads.  The other recipes I have tried are bland...this one, however, has just the right amount of sugar.  Did not make one change to the recipe.  GREAT just as is!

Delicious! To make this recipe healthier, I used whole wheat flour in place of white and replaced the oil with applesauce.

This one is definately worth the 5 stars! I added 1 cup frozen corn kernals to my batter at the very end. I also made muffins instead of bread. I baked mine at 400 for 20-22 minutes. The batch made 12 big and delicious muffins.

My family enjoys this and I have varied ingredients and it still comes out good. I have made as written as well as have substituted the oil with applesauce and still came out great. I also will do half brown sugar and half white sugar and it still turns out ok. I even made it up as a dry corn bread mix and sent it to my grandma with a dry soup mix and she fixed the bread yesterday and said she loved it so it is liked by my preschoolers as well as my 85yr old grandmother.

This turned out very well.  I added butter instead of oil and added an extra egg to elimate the crumbliness that others had trouble with.  I liked the sweetness...just perfect.  Thanks for the post.

All I can say is Yum!!!  I wouldn't change the recipe at all.  The only thing i did was whip up some orange blossom honey butter with a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon, brushed it on the top of the muffins and spread a bit of it in the muffin itself and it literally melts in your mouth!  Thank you for the great recipe!

I tried out this recipes becuase, I wanted a cornbread not too heavy on the butter. This is a great recipe...I totally recomend it. Its texture is moist and light, my daughter loved it! I must say that you need to add 2 full tablespoon of flour so, it won´t be too runny the doe.

This was pretty darn good. I live at 6,000 feet, so I did my usual alterations (a little less baking powder and a little more liquid). I used applesauce in place of most of the oil, as I often do when baking. Turned out great--moist, but dense, and just the right amount of sweetness!

WOW! This is great cornbread. No more boxes for me either I will definatly be making this from now on. I followed others advise and added 2 eggs and changed the oil to butter and it came out fluffy and not really crumbly but a good cornbread consistancy. Baked in a 9x9 sq. glass dish 35 mins. in my oven was perfect hubby and kids loved it. Thanks.

As recommended I used 1/2 cup of sugar, 2 tsp of baking powder and 2 eggs.  I also soaked the cornmeal for a few minutes like others suggested.  Husband LOVED this cornbread.  Doesn't need honey at all!

Yum! This is a fantastic sweet cornbread. Like other reviewers, I soaked the cornmeal in the milk for about ten minutes before combining all of the ingredients, and added just a touch more oil to the batter. Before baking, I put 1/2 a teaspoon or so of vegetable oil into each of eight mini-loaf tins, and tossed the tins into the oven. Once the oil was hot, I filled the tins about halfway and then baked them for 18 minutes at 400; they turned out perfectly! Nice and sweet, crunchy on the outside and not overly crumbly inside. So easy to make, that these will definitely be making appearances at my dinnertable more often.

sooo good!  i used corn flour instead of all-purpose flour so my gluten-free friend could eat it - all my friends ate it in under a half hour!  i think maybe if you substituted the sugar for molasses, it might be less sweet for those who like it that way, and less crumbly at the same time.  but i'm no expert.  maybe i'll try that next time.  i definitely loved it as is though

The flavor was very good, however, it was much too crumbly, couldn't spread softened butter on it without having to eat it like popcorn.

1 23 15 ...http://allrecipes.com/recipe/17891/golden-sweet-cornbread/ ... With a few changes - decreasing sugar to 1/3c & baking powder to 2t - this is the one L & E (7 yrs) like better (than Homesteader).  They are both good, but this is the sweeter choice.------ I tried the soaking the cornmeal trick.  It seemed like a good idea.  The result was a dry cornbread.  Not extremely dry.  No need to reach for the butter :D, but definately a difference.  It wasn't crumbly, but didn't make clean cuts either.  So, if you feel the need to soak, you should add more oil.  As for me, I'm not soaking, sticking with less sugar & less baking powder.  When it's done, it's just browning around the edges; probably have a rectangular-shaped cracked top; roundtop, not flat.  3/12: Tried half cup whole wheat flour, half cup white & it wasn't too "brown"  :D  Since I used white cornmeal, it helped the color, too - looking more like cornbread instead of unfrosted cake.  :)  Note4Me:  Pale using white cornmeal.  25 mins in 9x13 glass. Rounded top.  A rectangular slight crack.

This is very good cornbread.  I've always used the "box" mixes because I couldn't find a recipe that tasted "as good."  This one does.  As far as the crumbliness goes -- if you cut it when it is very hot, it'll crumble; if you let it cool a bit, it holds its shape just fine.  A simple recipe too.

This is a good basic cornbread recipe. I used 1/3 cup of sugar (half of what the recipe called for) and substituted vanilla coconut milk for the regular milk - yummy! I also baked it in a greased muffin pan and shortened the baking time by approx. 5 min. Yield: 12 muffins

I've used this recipe for a couple years now, and it has never disappointed me. Since I'm cutting back on calories these days, I replace the all-purpose flour with white whole wheat flour, use 1/3 cup of honey in place of sugar, 3 TB of egg white for the egg, almond milk in place of cow's milk, and applesauce for the veggie oil. I've even baked this batter in muffin tins for perfect small portions. Great with chili on a cold fall day.

Fantastic. So simple to make, and very much enjoyed as a surprise addition to breakfast.  Will likely be making again as it was so quick and easy to make and very well recieved by the rest of the family.

I made this recipe last night because I ran out of the boxed Jiffy Mix Cornbread and it came out delicious. It was moist sweet and buttery just how we like it. I doubled the recipe because I have a large family. This recipe was easy and I already had all the ingredients on hand, no need for me to use the Jiffy Mix anymore this recipe is a keeper!

Works also with white cornmeal or even very fine polenta.

This is a great base recipe for you to alter to your tastes. I used 3/4 c. flour, 1 1/4 c. cornmeal, 1/2 c. sugar and 1 tablespoon of baking powder for the first batch. The second batch I added about a cup over leftover creamed corn. That was even better.

This was excellent! It was easy and straightforward to prepare as well. My friend and I both loved it and we finished it by ourselves. I made slight alterations by adding 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and a shredded slice of cheddar cheese. Turned out DELICIOUS. Would definitely make it again!

I just made this recipe substituting the all-purpose flour with our gluten-free flour blend and all I can say is OMFG!  My 4 year old calls the breakfast corn cupcakes (I made them as muffins).  We will CERTAINLY be making these for Thanksgiving!!

For this I only used two teaspoons of baking poweder rather than three and a half, and reduced the sugar by half since I wasn't sure if it would be too sweet with the full amount (which after making it I don't think it would be too sweet). My husband and I both liked this, my 23 month old even ate a few bites (he's not a big cornbread fan, the last time I sprung cornbread on him he took a bite, spit it out, and gave the rest to the dogs!) My husband liked it so much that before I could even sit down he had eaten two huge pieces. Thanks so much for sharing! I'm sure this will be made and requested often

This is exactly like the one off the box of Alber's Corn Meal.........except with double the sugar. Tried this and prefer the original. This is too sweet for us, but if you like very sweet cornbread you would love it. If you don't, halve the sugar and you will be pleased with a classic plain cornbread. Thanks for sharing.

Good, but I think I will continue to use the recipe on the Quaker box of Golden Corn Meal. 1  1/2 c corn meal, 1/2 c flour, 1/4 c sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 4 tsp baking powder, 1 egg, 1 c milk, 1/4 c vegetable oil. Beat only until there are some small lumps remaining. Pour into greased 8" pan. Bake 425 F 20-25 minutes.

This is WONDERFUL sweet cornbread.  Based upon other reviews, I used a tad bit more oil than called for so it wouldn't be so crumbly.  Its still crumbly but moist.  Yum!

Delicious!

I subbed in gluten free flour mix and canola oil and added a teaspoon of xanthan gum, for the best gluten free cornbread I've had to date!

Strongly recommend!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I loved the texture of this cornbread and it wasn't too sweet.  I decreased the oil by half and it was still very moist.  Very easy to make as well.  I will definitely make this again.

Just okay. Not sure where I missed the beat on this one. Everyone rates this so high, but for my family it was not that good. I will try once more and pay more attention to the measurements and see if that makes a difference.

This is the only cornbread I will ever make again! It's perfection! As other suggested, I cut the baking powder to 2 tsp and added a little extra veggie oil for moistness. Added a small can of corn kernels for texture. AND I used low fat soy milk in place of regular milk as I needed it to be non-dairy. Baked beautifully for 25 minutes and my guests were in love! Fantastic!

WOW! This is seriously perfect! I saw some of the other reviews and do plan on trying the suggestions at some point, but if you want a great EASY and SUPER YUMMY corn bread try this!  (if you choose to make muffins, temp is 400 and USE CUPCAKE LINERS!)

Excellent. Cooked up beautifully. I always use a trick my grandmother did with her cornbread. While you are preheating your oven place a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil in it. When hot pour in cornbread mixture. This gives a beautiful crisp crust on the outside. I did use stone ground cornbread that I buy in the Texas Hill Country. Thanks!

I feel a traitor to my southern roots giving a five star rating to sweet cornbread, but this is really good stuff.  I usually do cut down a bit on the sugar, but it's a great recipe.  Doubled, it fits perfectly in a 9 x 13 pan.  It's great with pretty much anything, especially buttered with honey drizzled over it for dessert!

I took the suggestion from other reviewers to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and to soak the cornmeal in the milk for 10 minutes before mixing with the other ingredients and I was happy with the outcome. The taste was right on (not too sweet). But the texture left much to be desired. It was more crumbly than I would've liked, otherwise I would've given it five stars. And it was great with honey butter (three parts butter, one part honey).

super easy and yummy...like everyone else, i'll never ever use cornbread mix again, sorry Jiffy...

i doubled the recipe and used a 9 by 13" pan but it did take about 10 more minutes...i also added 3/4 cup of canned corn (15 oz) and it was very good...my friends didn't use butter at all!

This recipe is excellent. I only had one thing different with mine...I used raw, unfiltered Maine wild flower honey. It's sweeter than regular honey but made it very moist. Mine did not crumble at all (as GSTAR has stated). I think if yours did, it was over cooked just a tad. Thanks!

i've made this several times, and like a few others i find it a bit crumbly. well, last night i went to make it with chili and found that we had no veg oil! so i substituted some applesauce instead and it was even better! much more moist and tasty. i will definitely be using applesauce instead in this recipe from now on.

Followed directions explicitly except that I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup because 2/3 c. of sugar is just so unnecessary. The oven was regulated to 400* precisely. Baked for 20 minutes only. Maybe whole milk or buttermilk would be a better choice than 2%. Very dry and crumpled very easily and created a big mess.

Nice and sweet, but it's fairly plain. Seems like it needs something else to make it extra special. Very easy to make though.

We're not big cornbread fans, and usually use a mix, but I've trying to cook more from scratch, so I decided to try this cornbread recipe.  It was FABULOUS!  We both loved it.  It was so good that we saved the leftovers and had them the next night for dinner.  The texture was great, almost like a cake texture.  I will definitely  be using this as my cornbread recipe.  Thanks, bluegirl!

Made this last night to go with our chili, and it was excellent!  I'd been looking for a copycat Boston Market cornbread recipe that didn't start with a mix and stumbled across this recipe.  It is even better than theirs!  I made muffins, and added slightly more oil per other reviewers.  Will definitely be my go-to cornbread recipe!

UPDATE:  I've made this cornbread quite a few times now and it really is best exactly as written.  I like to make them as muffins.  I found this recipe when I was looking for a Boston Market copycat cornbread recipe, but I didn't want to use all the mixes that recipe calls for.  This is a great, from-scratch substitute!

I've been working on mastering cornbread - both a sweet one and a savory one.  For a sweet, this is absolutely delicious.  The only thing I did differently was cut the sugar just a smidgen short and add in a couple tablespoons of honey.  I also used melted butter instead of vegetable oil.   With those substitutions, this is the best cornbread I have ever made!

This cornbread was PERFECT.  I did change the recipe, however, to make it vegan by substituting soy milk for the milk and 1/4 cup applesauce for the egg.  I also reduced the sugar to a half cup because the recipe calls for a LOT of sugar for cornbread.  Suffice it to say, the entire loaf was gone last night within hours of it coming out of the oven.  Delicious.

This does make some very good cornbread, although I did find it to be slightly too sweet. (That is the only reason it is a 4 star for me)

I loved the texture. This turned out to be very light and fluffy. Almost cake like. I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet and I was worried at first because you could smell the sugar immediately as it was cooking. I was afraid it was going to come out burned but it came out perfectly fine. It does fall apart very easily though and is better suited to making as muffins.

If you like to crumble your cornbread into soups and stews, this does not work as well for that. It is way too soft and it immediately turns soggy. I am use to my cornbread staying somewhat firm and keeping some of its crispy pieces (from the top and edges of the cornbread) when I put it in soups or stews.

Bottom line is this was very good despite its sweetness. I will make this again, as muffins to have as a side, but this will nto be the cornbread I make for soups. I will also cut back on the sugar.

Deeeelicous! Says it makes 12 servings, but I just ate 1/3 of it myself.   I've loved cornbread since I was young, but always made it with Jiffy Mix.  I didn't have any of that in the house, & wanted cornbread this morning (We had cornmeal in cupboard from a recent fish-fry).  I went online & found this recipe; I'll probably never by a pre-made mix again.

There was only about a 1/3 cup white sugar in our cupboard, so I used that & a 1/3 cup brown sugar.  Also, we only have whole wheat flour, so I used that.  I always use refrigerated bacon grease to grease the pan - adds just a hint of bacon flavor.

I usually top my cornbread with butter & honey, or mash it up with heated milk and sugar.  I tried a small bite of this when I took it out of the oven and decided it needed nothing but that dab of butter.

Wonderful cornbread if you love the sweet moist version! Huge hit with my family. I followed the advice other's and split the sugar between brown and white and soaked the cornmeal in milk for a little while before continuing the  mixing process.

This was simply delicious. I do not like the "traditional" cornbread recipes, as I like mine sweet. This recipe was just perfect as is. I don't know why reviewers are saying this recipe is dry...isn't all true southern cornbread considered to be slightly dry"? If you want cornbread to have the texture of "cake" then just make a yellow cake and eat with your dinner! Anyways, this one is a keeper!

Why can't I give this 10 stars!! I doubled it and it made a thick 13x9" pan. I did add a cup of thawed frozen corn but other than that - perfect!! Not too sweet, moist, great with chili.

Excellent! I poured the batter into muffin tins lined with cupcake/muffin papers. This recipe works great as muffins. I pour the batter almost to the very top of the paper liners (makes 12 muffins) then I bake this at 375 degrees. It takes about 20 minutes for a toothpick to come out clean. The tops are always nicely browned and the muffins are perfectly cooked.

This is an excellent, quick cornbread recipe that I use almost once a week. I make them as muffins which are perfect for my kids' after school snacks or to pack in their lunch boxes. The only thing I do different is to use Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking rather than real sugar & add about 1/4 cup of honey. Thank you!

Great.  Soaking the cornmeal in the flour for ten minutes made it less gritty than most.  Next time I'll cut back on the sugar a bit - this recipe has an almost carmelized top.  I'll also up the oil a bit to combat crumbliness.  Full lined muffin cups baked for 18 minutes was perfect.

I followed the recipe as written twice, and both times my cornbread was dry.  Since then I have made two changes: 1/3 brown sugar and 1/3 white, instead of all white sugar, and I bake at 375 degrees for about 35 minutes.  By far the best cornbread I've ever had, it flies off the table!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very moist and delicious.  I used 2% milk in my recipe and everything else was verbatum.  I mixed honey and margerine together to go on top, and it added the perfect touch!

Very good cornbread recipe. I followed it to the letter and it was tasty, albeit a bit dry but worked well with chili. Next time I might add a 1/2 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt to add a bit more moisture, and perhaps some corn. I also loved that this was nice and crisp and brown on the outside. Overall a good recipe.

I'm hard to please when it comes to cornbread.  For me, a good cornbread recipe has to walk a very fine line.  It has to be sweet enough that the cornmeal itself is not overwhelming, but not too sweet that it becomes more of a dessert or breakfast bread than something that could be served alongside supper.  Besides that, I don't like it too grainy, but I also don't want it to be too cakey.  A good cornbread recipe must be middle of the road in those two areas.  This recipe fit the bill perfectly.  It was sweet enough, but not too sweet, had marvelous texture, and was wonderfully moist.  I will use this recipe again.  Thank you.

Very tasty; I baked mine in a muffin tin and it took 18 minutes @ 400.    I added a pinch of cayenne, 1/4tsp of chili powder, and ~3/4c frozen corn.  I also bumped up the salt to a 1.5tsp (total)  Moist, sweet, delicious!  Note: Be sure to grease AND flour the pan otherwise you will find yourself running a knife around the baking vessel.

Excellent base recipe! However, the baking soda content must be a typo! ALL I tasted was soda! On a remake, I cut the soda down to 1.5 tsp, and that worked very well.   Another variation, substitute in: White whole wheat flour blue cornmeal melted butter instead of vegetable oil brown sugar or honey!  To DIE for! Yum!

UPDATED: When I first reviewed this, I thought it had too much of a baking powder taste. I tried making this a 2nd time and really mixed the baking powder and salt very thoroughly into the flour and it turned out great! Also, I subbed the 1/3 c veg oil for 1/3 c melted butter and the flavor was wonderful. I mixed the batter just enough and tried not to overmix like with pancake batter, and it turned out very moist and perfectly sweet. Thanks for an great recipe!

This cornbread recipe rocks!!!  I make it all the time.  I make a few modifications:  I use brown sugar instead of white, and reduce measurement to to 1/2 cup; I sub in wheat free flours for the all purpose, due to wheat issues; I use olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil and sometimes I halve the oil measurement and put in some applesauce; I use vanilla soy milk instead of regular milk.  

It's great with chili, for breakfast,or a nutritious snack.

This is the best cornbread I have ever made! :) It is not to sweet, and it is nice and moist! I did add a tad bit more oil just to be sure it WOULD be moist (obviously that worked) & I also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, which really made a difference I believe...so good - you HAVE to add that! Oh, and it took a total of 25 minutes for the bread to be fully cooked (in a round pan)...if you want to make muffins I suggest 15-20 minutes.

I just made this bread. Came out excellent. My adjustments were (2) eggs instead of one, (a tad bit) more sugar, (2 1/2) baking powder instead of 3 1/2 tsps, and I added (3) tablespoons more oil in addition to the 1/3 cup --- based on recommendations by other reviewers.  Came out DELICIOUS.  I'm using this as "my official" cornbread recipe now.  I'd lost my old one and this one sounded very similar.  

Only, I cook on a gas stove and I had to take it out before the 25 mins... the bottom burned a little. So next time I'll monitor it closely and adj. my baking time.  Otherwise, it came out excellent.

I took advice from other reviewers and added extra oil and baking powder while cutting the sugar nearly in half as well as substituted 1/3 cup dry milk and a cup of water.  Simple, fresh and fabulous.  Thank you all!!

Fantastic!  This is my new favorite cornbread, beating out the Joy recipe for Northern Cornbread.  We're salt-free, so we omitted the salt and used salt-free baking powder; no problems.  Following another reviewer's hint about the cornbread coming out crumbly with that much oil, I used half butter, half oil, and the cornbread turned out very nicely textured with great flavor.  Thanks!

This is the best corn bread I have ever made. Very moist and sweet. I modified the ingredients and used 1/3 cup of light apple sauce instead of oil - also used only 3 tsp of Baking Powder. I mixed it with an electric mixer for about 3-4 minutes to make sure it would be fluffier. If you like recipes that are lower fat, definately try this. It was worth it.

i tried this once and it was too crumbly, but oh so delicious. the second time i stuck w oil instead of butter some reviewers recommended. but the big difference was using 1/4 cup splenda baking mix instead of sugar. wow, no longer crumbly, more healthy, and still as delicious as the original. thanks, lori. d

The cornbread tasted great... but it completely fell apart so I wasn't able to serve it at all.  Instead I used it as part of my turkey stuffing.

This may be too sweet for some but it was just what I was looking for. I used 3/4 cup cornmeal and 1 1/4 cup flour. Make sure you soak the cornmeal in the milk at least 10 minutes! I used 2 1/2 tsp. baking powder and added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla and it tasted EXACTLY like the cornbread from Sylvia's, a soul food restaurant in NYC.   Moist, fluffy and sweet--perfection.

Decent recipes. Would add half brown and half turbinado sugar next time instead of just turbinado (white sugar is bad!) I used about 1/4 cup more milk, but used all buttermilk as it makes for a fluffier more moist bread. I hate the typical dry cornbread! And as I do with every cornbread recipe I add about a cup of fresh corn kernals and when the bread is semi firm on top I drizzle honey. Next time I make this I'll use the half brown sugar and see if this comes out even better

Excellent! my moms recipe is very similar but there are differences, hers has only 3 TBLS of sugar so I was a little concerned it would be to sweet for our taste, so I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and used 3 tsp of baking powder per others suggestions and I thought it was terrific Next time I make it I am going to use a trick from my moms recipe, she melts bacon grease into the pan that you will be cooking the cornbread in and then add 3-4 Tbls of the melted bacon grease into the batter and cook, it adds a great taste  and it is not greasy, gives it a beautiful golden color thanx for a great recipe!!!! the only difference in her recipe is that it calls for 1/2 cup of flour and4 tsp of baking powder, I think Lori's recipe makes a bigger fluffer cornbread so I would think the bacon grease would work just as well, I will try it that way next time and let you know GREAT!!!!!!! GREAT!! try this one folks!!!

Very good - great texture!  Tastes very similar to the "Marie Callendars" brand mix if you are familiar with that.  When I make this again I will add a slight bit more salt - that's the only change I would suggest...

This was good, although it could've been sweeter (we like our cornbread sweet).  The texture was perfect.  Next time, I'll add more sugar.  Other than that, it was perfect.  Thanks.

This is an excellent, moist, slightly sweet cornbread. I baked mine in a round glass dish. I followed the directions exactly. Nothing could be easier than this recipe. You probably have the ingredients in your pantry. By the time the oven is ready, your recipe will be ready to start baking. If you like cornbread, you'll love this one. No trip to the grocery store. No mystery ingredients like chemicals or preservatives. I will NEVER buy another packaged cornbread product.

I rarely rate recipes, I just save and reuse them.  This recipe is wonderful.  The only thing I did different was used my home ground corn meal.  It is a little denser than store bought.  I soaked it in milk for an hour, to soften it.  I also added a 1/3 cup of corn and a few jalapeno slices .  My family likes that, in their cornbread.  Saved and will share with family!

I would have to say it was a real success. What I think made it different was to add more of a corn taste I had warmed up some frozen corn and I then whisked it together with the milk, the egg, and the oil. With doing that is made it fluffier.

I found it to be too dry, too crumbly and lacking in flavor. I also had to cook it an extra 15 or so minutes for the middle to be completely cooked through, but by the time the middle was cooked the top was over cooked and the edges were burnt. I have a very old, inconsistent oven so maybe that was the reason, but I definitely will not try this recipe again until I have a different oven.

I made muffins from this recipe.  I followed the recipe for the batter to the letter.  I used butter on my muffin pan, and the muffins were done with golden brown bottoms in about 15 minutes.  They came right out of the pan, so I'm using butter from now on.  I set my timer for 20 minutes, so it was a good thing I peeked in on them early!  I didn't have muffin liners, but would have been hesitant to use them, since they seem stick to the finished product and leave you with less muffin to enjoy.  I thought they might be too sweet with the 2/3 cup of sugar, but they were fine.

I loved this recipe...but didn't make it exactly the way the recipe said.  I used half and half (but would have used buttermilk if I'd had it...I added lemon juice to half and half for the same effect)...and I added a cup of frozen corn kernels.  I greased cast iron skillet with bacon grease and heated until smoking hot, then added batter and sprinkled with sea salt before putting into oven to bake.  Would be great with mix ins like bell peppers and onions and jalapenos...or basil and tomatoes and parm or asiago or romano cheeses...I am sooooooooooo going to experiment with it.  Love the basic recipe...so easy and wonderful!  By the way, this really reminded me of corn dog batter!  It was missing a bit of butter though I thought.  I remedied this with topping it with melted butter and a little more salt before eating but I think substituting butter for oil in batter might fix that.  It was very good even the way it was!  Great recipe!

Finally - cornbread that doesn't turn out too crumbly and dry.  I usually do not alter recipes on the first go, but I took the advice of the others and reduced the baking powder (i used 2.5 tsp) and I also soaked the cornmeal in the milk while getting the rest of the ingredients out and pre-heating the oven.  I have no idea if those steps did anything, but this cornbread is great so I will stick with it.

Restaurant quality recipe. If you use an earthenware baking dish and this can be cooked on the upper level of a gas grill on those hot summer nights. I have found the high sugar content can burn the bottom in a metal pan. But set this up in indirect heat while grilling country style spare ribs, with a quick cajun rice on the grill side burner and you are 30 minutes from a quick filling meal without heating up the kitchen!

I liked the sweetness, but we could taste the baking powder. I added a few tablespoons of creamed corn, and used buttermilk instead of milk. I also added a variety of shredded cheese, it was a good recipe! .

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. It was good but you could taste the baking powder. The next time I made it, I reduced the baking powder to 2.5 teaspoons and substituted melted butter for the oil. It had a much better taste.

Almost the consistendy of a delicious cake, but way too sweet for cornbread.  Actually, this is the EXACT recipe off the Albers cornmeal box with nearly 3X the sugar and a little more baking powder.  Albers - 1/4 cup sugar, this one - 2/3.

I made it using 1/2c white sugar and the rest of the 1/3c sugar as brown sugar. It made 6 regular-sized muffins and 24 minis, and I'm waiting for the mini muffins to cool down so I can taste this! (The batter was great, so I've got high hopes for these little guys.)
If you're making mini-muffins, 12 minutes is a good amount of time to bake evenly all the way through. I wasn't the most even in my batter distribution (some are noticeably taller than others) but they all baked all the way through in about 12 minutes.
....they've cooled enough, lemme at 'em! And the verdict is...delicious! Making these was a great way to christen my mini-muffin pan. :)
I think next time, though, I'm gonna sprinkle sanding sugar on them. I do tend to prefer my cornbread a little sweeter. I can't wait to make these again!

More like 4-1/2 stars.  I made this as written, using King Arthur's Whole Wheat Flour in a cast iron skillet AND made Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread as written and served them both at a small get-together.  Of the people there, 6 preferred Grandmother's.  May have been the WW flour or maybe just the recipe.  So, I'm knocking a star off this since I also preferred Grandmother's. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent recipe, but I will probably make it once more with regular flour.  Can't really go wrong here...certainly better than boxed and very easy too!  Using cast iron definitely gives the crust a nice crunchy texture and the cake-part was perfect.  Just don't over-beat.

Too crumbly and too floury.  It was pretty in the pan but several of my pieces fell apart as I was buttering them.  The flavor was ok but nothing to get too excited about.  Due to lack of deliciousness and the crumble factor, I will look elsewhere when I am searching for a sweet cornbread recipe.  If this was the only recipe I could find, I would add more cornmeal and get rid of some of the flour.  I like the texture of cornbread.  This was more like cake, smooth.

This one is a definite keeper!  I have searched high and low for a really good, sweet cornbread recipe that still tastes like cornbread and not like cake.  This one fits the bill perfectly!  I've made it at least four times in the past couple of months and it always comes out perfectly.  I use a convection oven so turn the temp down to 375F and keep the cooking time the same.  Perfect!

Made mine "free" of almost everything but taste-- and served as heart-shaped muffins for Valentine's Day dinner :)
Used Gluten free flour, fine polenta, 1/2c agave, coconut oil (liquefied & added last to avoid re-solidifying), & almond milk. Reduced salt to 3/4 tsp. Added 1 cup frozen corn (chopped in Magic Bullet).
Baked at 350- 10 mins, then turned pans and baked for 5-8 mins more, watching closely.
Made 12 moist, yummy muffins

4 out of 5 people in our house loved these. My 6 yr old son complained that they are "too sweet".....but he also loved my chili, which was heavily laden with beans and veggis, which he usually avoids like the plague. SO maybe it was opposite day for him.

Made as written except used a little less sugar and sunflower oil instead of veg. oil.  Turned out nice and moist - now a family favorite, even for my picky kids.
Thanks for the recipe!  I made it with the spanish rice bake from this site (only made it vegetarian using frozen crumblers)  Great meal and pretty cheap too.

FYI : this cornbread gets very dark.  Crispy edges taste like a fresh corn dog from the fair.  I may have to try making mini corn dog bites for my boys with this mix.

Very Tasty!

I exchanged the 1 c milk for 1/2 c soymilk & 1/2 c water.

Also exchanged the 1/3 c oil for 1/3 c softened olive oil margarine (to make up for the lost taste due to no dairy)

Egg white rather than whole egg

Will make again and again

One word "FANTASTIC."  I have tried quite a few corn bread recipes and have not found "THE ONE" until now.  I followed the directions exactly except I made muffins - using an regular sized ice cream scoop I was able to make 10 they were high topped and golden!!

This is the first time I have ever made corn bread from scratch. I stuck to the recipe mostly, just used melted butter for the oil and an egg replacer since my son is allergic to eggs. I made them into muffins and only baked them for 15 minutes. They were moist and so yummy. My husband, who doesn't usually like cornbread, actually had two. Nice to find a good recipe on the first try!

I love this cornbread recipe. I fixed for my man and he ate a second helping. I didn't have yellow cornmeal on hand so I used white cornmeal and it turned out excellent. I have added this recipe to my recipe binder!

Yum Yum!  Everyone in my family loved it!  (Age 3-30!)  ONly reason im not giving 5 stars is cause I felt I needed to tweak a lot... but EXCELLENT base recipe that you can change a little here and there each time.  Keeps things interesting I think!  

Heres how I did it---I followed the advice of others and let the milk soak in the corneal for a bit before adding the egg and then other ingrediants.  I also subsituted butter for oil and half the flour as whole wheat flour.  I decreased the sugar to just under a half cup and decreased baking powder to just under 2...After mixing all ingrediants the mixture seemed too thick so I winged it and added a little more milk and maybe a tblsp of veg oil. Next time I'm gonna try NOT soaking the cormeal and milk and see if this helps with the thickness of the mix.

 I cooked in a butter Pam sprayed pyrex pie dish and it took 30 mins to get golden.  

Great with butter on top or without.

One of the best cornbread recipes. I made it gluten free and diary free. I used Namaste perfect flour. I also used vanilla coconut milk. Instead of veg oil, I used grape seed oil. My daughter ate 3 pieces!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I followed others' advice and cut the sugar back to a scant 1/2 C and melted butter instead of vegetable oil.  On my own I used 1/2 C. whole wheat flour and 1/2 C. all-purpose flour.  It came out great!

I made this last night to accompany a Southwestern style black bean soup for a group of friends that were coming over.  It was the perfect accompaniment.  Everyone loved it and the pan was soon wiped clean.  This has the perfect amount of sweetness in a cornbread.  It had beautiful color and texture and the flavor was spot on.  I don't know how often I'll buy the package mix now that I have this recipe.  Really easy to bring together and done from start to eating in 25 minutes.  You can't ask for better or faster.

I made this with the following changes suggested by other users: decreased sugar to 1/2 cup.  Used 1/3 cup melted butter instead of vegetable oil.  Cornbread came out perfect.  Not too sweet.  Perfect crumbly texture, a nice crispiness on the top and edges.  Hint of sweetness and smooth buttery flavor.  Family loved it!

I made muffins out of this recipe. I recently lost my favorite cornbread recipe, and this is similar but not the same. It will do as the back up because my family really enjoyed it, especially my son who is a cornbread lover! Not the best I have ever had but it is a close second!

So happy to find this recipe. I live in china and really craved some corn bread. This was so easy. 2 things, after reading reviews, I soaked the cornmeal in milk for 10 minutes. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. Just personal taste. Great recipe!

This is a good recipe. I made it as-is the first time, except for decreasing the baking powder to 2 tsp. The second time I made it I substituted butter for the oil, used buttermilk and decreased baking soda 1 1/2 tsp. This is now a 4 star recipe for me and will be my base for my cornbread dressing.

This recipe is delicious. I followed the ingredients exactly, the only change was to follow the suggestion of another reviewer and mix the cornmeal and milk and let them sit together for a few minutes. I baked mine in muffin tins with liners. They turned out so good. Sweet but not too much. My go to recipe from now on.

Delicious!  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar, based on the other reviews and it was just about perfect.  May cut the sugar back a tad bit more.

I added the equivalent of 2 ears of frozen corn to this mix.  Very easy to make, and sweet, but not overly so.  When I added the corn, I increased the baking time to almost 30 minutes.  It was great!!

Love this cornbread!!! It's sweet and moist, just the way we like it up here in the Northeast.  I followed the recipes to the T and it was great with our chili dinner and will be fabulous toasted for breakfast.

followed completely and it was perfect! the only thing is that it took 32 mins to bake in a pyrex pie plate. next time i'm going to use a square pan or muffin tin, just because i think it's easier to cut.

I made this recipe because of all the 5 star ratings and the simplicity of the recipe.  I have to agree that it is 5 star worthy, even 6 star worthy. I made it in a loaf pan and added 1 cup shredded cheese and poco picante seasoning to give it some spicy kick (3 tbsp.).  I will make it again!

Wonderful tasting batter!  I had extra blueberries, and a craving for cornbread.  Was inspired by this allrecipes entry:  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/blueberry-cornmeal-muffins/detail.aspx

I used the batter from this, used melted butter instead of oil, 1/3 brown and 1/3 white sugar, and added blueberries!  YUM!

Here are my grandmother's tips:

Reserve 2 tbs of the flour and 2 tsp of the white sugar.  

Use a silicone pan, and spray lightly with cooking spray, then sprinkle lightly with white sugar to coat.

Blend all ingredients as stated, let stand for 2 mins, while you dredge the berries in the extra flour.  Fold the berries in the batter - CAREFULLY! - right before spooning into the pan!

These browned a little uneven, so I would turn down the oven to 375 and bake a few mins more.

WONDERFUL, and came right out of the pan!  Just a tad dry/crumbly, so maybe more milk? I didn't mind eating it like cobbler with butter on top!

My favorite Cornbread recipe!  I bake mine in a cast iron skillet that I preheat (with the shortening). When you add the Cornbread batter into the hot skillet it sizzles and makes the outside crisp and the inside soft and moist.

Thos one is a keeper. I added some diced Jalapeno for added flavor and I suspect you could add poblanos, kernel corn or any other vegetable to kick it up a notch!

Instead of vegetable oil, I used butter and I baked at 375 for 15 minutes and made 3 dozen mini muffins.  I think I should've taken them out at 13 minutes since some of them browned on the bottom.  I also added a little over 1/2 cup of sugar and it tasted plenty sweet.  It taste pretty good, but will taste better with butter.  Next time, I will try using a little less baking powder since I am tasting a little bit of it.

This recipe makes a very good sweet cornbread base. I made a few tweeks because I wanted to be sure that it came out fluffy and moist. I used two teaspoons of baking powder and one teaspoon of baking soda. I used one cup of vanilla flavored almond milk and 2/3 cup soy sour cream. It came out very nice. It took about 33 minutes to bake. I baked it at 400 for the first 18 minutes and then finished baking it at 390 for 15 more minutes. Tastes very good. It came out very most inside and thankfully not wet like a fruit cake. The crust on the outside came slightly crisp which added joy to the eating experience. Overall I'm thankful for this recipe allowed me to make a cake-like cornbread which is exactly what I was hoping for.

Finally!!! I've found the perfect cornbread recipe after searching for quite a while. Last night served this to 4 adults and 6 kids (ages 6-12) and everyone loved it. Some people added a bit of butter or creamed honey, but it was perfect just as is. A bit, but not too crumbly.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and used equal amounts of brown sugar and white sugar.  Also used equal amounts of butter and canola oil.

My family loves this cornbread!  It is the only one I ever use.  I make it for company a lot in the winter with soup and it is gobbled up in a hurry.  I have made people who don't like cornbread like this cornbread.  I make no changes in the recipe!!

This is a great ''bread'', that tastes more like a cake.  I use less sugar--1/2 a cup, and after I take it out of the oven, I spread butter and honey on the top, which seals the cake and keeps it fresh tasting!
 
I've also added fresh blueberries and raspberries to the batter, which was very tasty :)

I have made different cornbread recipes, all of which I had my questions about later, but after biting into this cornbread, I knew that I've found the one that I will make from now on. The only change I made was to cut the sugar in half. I felt like for my own liking that was way too much sugar for cornbread. It was perfect. I followed the baking times and temperature exactly and it came out perfect. You can't go wrong with this one.

Very good.  I had to bake a little longer but I think that's because I keep my corn meal in the freezer.  I will never buy a boxed corn bread mix again.

This was awesome! I'm ashamed to say that between the two of us it was gone in that many days... I used melted butter, 2 eggs and 2 tsp baking powder like other reviewers said, and skim milk because that's all I had. It turned out well so I have to find out how white whole wheat flour will do next time.

I made this as directed but subbed brown sugar for white sugar to give a little more depth but only used half the amount because it was for a cornbread stuffing recipe and I didn't want it to be too sweet.    I thought this was fairly moist and an easy recipe but the taste didn't stand out too much to me. I've had much more flavorful and tender cornbread.... sadly no recipes for such cornbread yet!  However I think this would be great if it was served with something else to help zazz it up a bit. Butter and honey for sure. But also a great pot of beans or chili would go nicely.

I would definitely cut the sugar. Tasted great but I felt like I was eating cake. I made it with chili and I suppose this just isn't the right type of cornbread to go with chili. Although it did rise beautifully, and had a great texture if you want a cakey cornbread.

Great tasting cornbread! Easy to make. I followed the recipe without changing anything....it was perfect! I made it to go along with black bean chili. My wife and kids finished off the leftovers for breakfast. Not the chili the cornbread......can't send the kids to school full of chili :)

This is the recipe I have been using for years. My family will beg me to make it. Now I do change it a bit, I add honey. Yes that does make it a bit sweeter, but to my family this is a treat. If you add honey start with a small amount at first, but add it to your tastes.  Also we make muffins or mini loaves out of this, and that shortens the cooking time to 15-20 minutes.

After reading review after review that mentioned how "crumbly" this cornbread is, I wondered if I had been wrong in my assumption that all cornbread is a little crumbly.  Isn't that part of its down-home charm?  So, I threw this recipe together as written, though I did have to substitute brown sugar for about a quarter cup of the white sugar (I ran out).  It looked and smelled delicious when I pulled the piping hot pan out of the oven.  And the taste - well, it's nothing short of divine.  Probably the best-tasting cornbread I've ever made.  The texture?  In short, it's CRUMBLY.  Not your basic cornbread crumbly, but difficult to pick up crumbly.  Thus, the four stars.  I still loved this recipe and will try it again with a few changes to help ward off the crumbs.

Love, Love, Love this recipe!  This was exactly the kind of cornbread I was looking for and I was surprised that I already had all the ingredients in the house when the craving hit.  It's super easy to make and the only thing different I did was soak the cornmeal in the milk for a few minutes while I was pulling all the other stuff out of the cabinets.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

First time ever making cornbread muffins from scratch. Excellent!! I did cut sugar to 1/2 cup and added 3-4 Tbs. of honey. Instead of 1/3 cup of veg. oil... I split it up with 1/2 melted butter and the remainder of the 1/3 cup the veg. oil. I also used 2 eggs instead of 1. I won't tell you how many my hubby ate at one setting! He even finished up eating two more as his "dessert".

Made this twice. The first as is... Very good but a bit crumbly which was fine bc i was eating crumbled with greens anyway. The second time i added an egg to help with the crumbly texture... and i used butter instead of oil only bc i do love that butter. I also greased my cast iron skillet with bacon grease before baking.... so the first time, very very good the second time.... Lawd help me (only eat one slice).

Excellent recipe. Like other users of this site, I only used 1/2 Cup of sugar. I also used a 8x8 square pan, and baked for 17 minutes and let cool. Turned out great!  Thanks for sharing.

So delicious! Didn't change a thing, but I did double the recipe. We had our 3 nieces visiting from Florida, they'd never had cornbread before, and they loved it!  They couldn't get enough of it.

I didn't think it was sweet at all. Plus it was very dry and crumbly. Will not make again.

Great recipie! I actually made muffins with this recipe instead of using the 9" round and they came out perfect! I live at 8,500 ft and did not have to adjust this recipe at all! This was a hit with all of the kids as well... Thanks!

This cornbread was good but a little dry.  I am looking for something more moist without all the added fat.  Does anyone have a better recipe?  I did like that it was sweet.  I made 12 muffins instead of a round batch.  Maybe that made them dry.  It was a good recipe.  I will keep  on looking though!

So quick and easy and delicious.  My husband and kids loved it.  I loved that I didn't need to go out a buy buttermilk to make it.  I didn't change anything about the recipe!  We will be having corn bread way more often.  Thanks.

The only Thing I changed about the Recipe is that I used Whole Wheat Flour instead of All Purpose and Canola Oil instead of Vegetable. Great Tasting Cornbread!

This is the BEST cornbread I have ever had! It is so light and airy and sweet. I suggest trying it the way it is, and scaling back on the sugar if it's too much for your taste. Its definitely worth adjusting the amount of sugar for the texture this recipe gives you. I will *never* buy another box of Jiffy mix, and plan on premeasuring and bagging up the dry ingredients so I have a mix on hand for when I need it. Thank you so, so much for posting this recipe!

I made this recipce X's 6 and it still turned out awesome!  I swapped melted butter for the oil.  People were so amazed at how moist it was just on its own.  My new favorite cornbread recipe!

This is an absolutely outstanding recipe. It makes 12 muffins perfectly, and this is a nice easy way to serve them to guests. I agree with a former person that they are great with butter and honey. I am serving them this evening with a soup and salad for a nice comfort meal.

Since his college days, my husband has loved Jiffy corn muffin mix.  I don't buy it because it contains partially hydrogenated oil.  I've been looking for a replacement for years and this is it.  I use organic stone-ground (fine) cornmeal and Eggbeaters and he loves it.  The best part is that it's just as easy as the mix.  Thanks, bluegirl, for a great recipe that will be used from now on in my house.

This is very good cornbread! I like mine to be sweet, and this was perfect. I 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and half a cup of white flour...my family didn't notice the change. I also cut the baking powder to 2 1/2 tsp, 3 1/2 seemed to be a bit much. My family and I liked this one...thanks for sharing!!!

My husband absolutely loves sweet cornbread and the taste of food from an iron skillet.  I decided to make this recipe even though I have never been a huge fan of sweet cornbread.  I am from the south and we don't generally make sweet cornbread or use flour in it.  After tasting this I have decided that I actually love sweet cornbread.  This recipe was fantastic and produced a crisp crust and tender inside.  I did increase my oil to 1/2 cup based upon a review on here.  It made a moist bread.  I will definitely make this again and again!  Thanks bluegirl!

OMG!!  This was some awesome cornbread!!  My friend tasted it and told me that this one was better than my last one.  I laughed because I was always make Jiffy cornbread and modify it to make it sweet and moist.  So, imagine my surprise to learn that my homemade one was better than Jiffy?!!  Definitely a keeper.

Definately the best cornbraed I have made.  I cooked it for 25 minutes.  It was perfectly golden brown.  Not dry like some said.  I did soak my cornmeal in milk for about 15 minutes before mixing in the rest of the ingredients.  I followed the ingredients exactly, except I ran out of flour, so I substituted a small amout with cornmeal (probably about 1/8 cup).  This was good without butter.  Yum!  Update:  I made it exactly as stated but added 1/2 cup corn kernels.  ??

Too heavy for a sweet cornbread.  Very dense.  Has good flavor, but feels like a lump in your stomach when you eat it.

Love, Love, Love this recipe. Found this recipe like over 2 years ago and I still use it. I love it. I changed it a little. Instead of 2/3 cup white sugar, I use 1/4 cup of sugar or 2 tablespoons of honey. I don't use vegetable oil. I use canola or olive oil. This is the best recipe ever! Love it!  Not overly sweet. Just plain delicious!

Wowee!!! This is a GOO-OO-D cornbread recipe!!!!! I just LOVED this! Made a batch to go with simple turkey chili (also on this site). I liked the cornbread more than the main dish :) My bf didn't care for this (but he doesn't care for cornbread anyways... and look what he's missing!!!). I didn't change a thing - and wouldn't. This is perfect as is. Not dry and crumbly and not too sweet. Thanks so much for sharing this delicious and easy recipe. No more Jiffy mix for me :) I can't wait to slather leftovers with warm butter.  This will be a regular at my house!!!

My husband loved it and was glad that I found a sweet cornbread that he liked but I thought it was  touch to sweet.  I might cut it down just a little bit and try again.  I do know I will make again many times since he loved it so much.

Pretty good,  my husband really enjoyed it.  I made it to go along with a Chicken and Barley stew and it was a nice compliment.  The only thing I did differently was I added a can of corn kernals to the mix before baking.  Will definitely make this again

Very tasty, moist and just what I was looking for.  I went online to look for Durgin Park's cornbread (my old favorite), but saw this one on the featured page and tried it.  Very easy and delicious!  Thanks

This is really good.  I used just a little less sugar and added jalapeño pepper because that’s how my family likes it.  Also substituted ¼ cup of butter flavored Crisco for the vegetable oil.  This cornbread has a very nice texture and it taste great.

There is no doubt that this is a great cornbread recipe as it always vanishes from sight!  It's fairly sweet so I'm having trouble understanding why anyone would add more sugar!

This turned out really well for me although I cut the salt in half since a full teaspoon seemed too much to me.  I also cut the amount of baking powder to 2 tsp. which was plenty.  Great result with these changes so I'm rating 4 since I believe as written it would be a bit salty.

EXCELLENT! Especially with chili!  I altered after reading reviews -- used 1/2 WW and 1/2 white flour, cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, salt to 1/2 tsp and baking powder to 2 tsp.  I also baked in 8" square pan.   Added green chilies on one occasion for spicy version!

Very good sweet cornbread recipe. I personally prefer the Grandmother's buttermilk cornbread recipe from this site, but my husband loves this one and ya know it's all about making him happy (ha ha). I will make this when cooking for the both of us and the other when it's just me and the kids.

Excellent recipe.  Would be a great next to slow cooker bbq pork or nice hearty bowl of chili.  Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I found it a little sweet.

Very good cornbread!  A bit light and sweet for me, but the kids loved it.  The only thing I'd mention is cooking time -- after 25 minutes, the cornbread was still liquid -- I'll try 35 next time.  Definitely needs testing, even if the top looks brown.

Finally got a chance to make this last night and it was wonderful!  Only had white corn meal and made them as muffins but they were great!  Next time though, I am going to cut down on the sugar because it was a little too sweet.

Why does my cornbread ALWAYS sink in the middle? This on sank while still in the oven. Hmmm. Anyway, the recipe was good, husband thought it wasn't moist enough. There are just so many different ways to make it it'll be hard to find the one we like best.

Thanks so much for this recipe - it is THE BEST cornbread EVER! I only had an 8" round cake pan, so I baked it an extra 10 minutes and it turned out perfect! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

This is great!  Initially I had hoped that it would be like a Boston Market Cornbread, but it wasn't so I was initially disappointed.  But after having a 2nd (and a 3rd) I actually came to the conclusion that Boston Market's is too sweet and almost like yellow cake and this is actually much better.  Made the recipe as stated with the exception of making them in my muffin pan for 16 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cornbread as a side to beef enchiladas, and it taste so good! It is similar to store bought, but better. A little crumbly, but delicious. I gave it 4 stars because I altered the recipe by using only 2 tsp. of baking powder, I think that worked out perfect! I'm so happy I found a cornbread recipe I love,I'll never buy it at the grocery store again. Next time I'll maybe add creamed corn, and jalepenos for a little kick.

GREAT!  This is the best homemade cornbread I've made or had.  This is sweet, moist and not crumbly.  I used whole milk and 1 extra large egg - this may have helped with the texture.   Baked 20 min convection 375.  If you like cornbread, this is restaurant good!!!  I will never buy a box cornbread mix again!

This cornbread is very easy to make.  I decided to make muffins out of my batter - cooked about 18 minutes.  The only mod I made to the recipe was adding in a can of creamed corn.  My kids love it!!

Made some changes (hence only 4 stars).
Did as others suggested and used 2 eggs instead of 1, used 1/2 Cup splenda, added 3Tbs. olive oil, and reduced baking powder to only 2tsp for less crumble. Used a glass baking dish, was done in 20 mins. Let it rest for a few minutes and thought it was delicious!! Was a great side to my turkey chili tonight!

I am a huge fan of sweet cornbread and this was just the recipe! My family could not stop talking about how good the cornbread was and asked for the recipe multiple times. I doubled the recipe and added an extra egg as others suggested. It turned out beautifully. I have been looking for an excuse to make it again - it was that good!

Excellent recipe.  I, like other reviewers, added another egg and more oil (about 3 tablespoons more).  It did not crumble and was quickly gobbled up at dinner.  Thanks for a No. 1 recipe!

This is by far the BEST cornbread I have ever made. It was moist and very sweet...I tossed out my old recipe and this will be my new one. I kept the recipe the same except for adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a couple extra teaspoons of vegetable oil. It took 23 minutes to bake. I sliced it into 8 big pieces and served with maple syrup and vanilla soymilk. Delicious!

I am really impressed!!  I've had a LOT of cornbread in my life, and this is definitely one I'd consider a winner.  ...good texture, not too sweet and cakey but GREAT flavor, good texture, it rose beautifully, and was MOIST.   I modified things ever so slightly... adding just a tad extra oil, and a tiny bit extra salt (about 1/2 tbsp. vs 1 tsp.).  At 400 degrees F, it took about 30 minutes to be done... and WOW - the bread was really fabulous.

DELICIOUS!!!!  exactly what i was looking for.. i was a bit skeptical at first but i took some reviewers advice and altered it a bit.  i doubled the recipe and instead of 2 eggs i added 3 to make it more firm.. i also added a little bit more oil.  it came out very moist and the sugar was just perfect.  i almost ate the whole cake.

This  was a wonderful recipe.  HOWEVER.  The first time I cook this it had a deep salt yucky after taste, that is because I was an idiot and used Baking Soda instead of powder, I don't know how I made that mistake.  Very nice and mild taste.  Great with butter or Fish or whatever you are eating for that night. I am going to bake this again the right way and tell you my results, lol!

This is awesome cornbread. I LOVE sweet cornbread and this was perfect. My oven runs a little hot, so I only had to bake it 15 minutes. Then I turned the oven off and let it sit for 5 more minutes. I will never buy the cornbread mix in a box again. I can't wait to make this again, next time as cornbread muffins.

I'm convinced that this recipe won me 3rd place at my company's chili-cook off.  I was too lazy to soak my cornmeal, but it came out moist and not the slightest bit crumbly anyway.  Paired great with a chili recipe from this site (Chili I).  I will be making this again!!!

This was amazing, but as per usual, I made a few adjustments. I found that if I used 1/3 cup Splenda, the bread was plenty sweet. I also used egg substitute, whole wheat flour, and lowfat buttermilk instead of eggs, all-purpose, and milk. I also used applesauce in replace of the oil, which added a bit of the sweetness back without making the bread taste like apples. Lastly, I stirred a few forkfuls of drained julienned sun-dried tomatoes (jarred in oil) into the mix and baked for 22 minutes. It came out perfect: moist, sweet, with a bit of a tart bite from the tomatoes. Soooo good!

I am a Vegan and  I made this cornbread, (with milk and egg replacements of course) and it was the most delicious cornbread I ever had.  this is how I altered it...

1/2 cup Unrefined sugar(i used turbinado)
1 tsp salt
3 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 Tbs Ground Golden Flaxseeds mixed with 3 Tbs. Water.

I made this bread this morning.  I is a very enjoyable recipe.  I believe it is a must to soak the cornmeal, I soaked the cornmeal in the milk aloted in the recipe for 10 mins.  I may soak it longer next time. Seeing the crumbly state of the loaf I will be making muffins next time.  There is no doubt about it I will be making this recipe again.  It's a gooder!

Great cornbread first time making it fresh from scratch.  I did like my mom does and reduced the  baking powder and added honey from the bottle squeezed on top.  You do not need to mix the honey in the cornbread it will go thru and its not to sweet.  The last 5 minutes of cooking I put butter on top then put it back in the oven and let it back for the rest of the time.  Its excellent!

I thought the taste was just perfect..I like how there isn't too much oil used, but they still turn out really moist.  I made them into muffins, and had them on 400 in the oven, but then turned it down to 350 for the last 5 mins or so.  I wish I would of lightly sprayed inside of the cupcake papers because the sides of the cornmeal did stick a little.

This was the first time I made cornbread from scratch, and it was great! My husband and I both loved. It will be included in our recipe rotation. Next time I might cut back on the sugar a little to avoid crumbs. Other than that it was perfection!

EXCELLENT and EASY!  This recipe uses ingredients always on hand.  I did make it a bit healthier by using 1/2 whole wheat flour, half white flour and my cornmeal was course grind, which gave it a bit more texture.  Will definately use again!

I have to say that this was a hit here.  I thought I had corn meal in my cupboard, but I was wrong; all I had was self-rising cornmeal mix.  I used about 1 1/4 cup of the mix, about 1/4 cup of flour instead of the dry ingredients listed on the recipe.  I also took other posters suggestion and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Since it was still very crumbly, I'll probably cut the extra flour and maybe add one more egg.  We'll have to see.  But, overall, it was great and I'll definitely be making it again!

I gave it 4 stars because my 3 year old kept asking for more, even the next morning after I made it. Anything that I can make and she will actually eat is a big plus with me.  With that being said, I personally thought it to be overly sweet, I know it is called Golden sweet bread but the next morning I could really taste the sugar in it.  It was much much better warm out of the oven.

I think the next time I will make the corn bread right on the back of the cornmeal canister, it has the exact same ingredients but with much less sugar.

Simple and tasty! Only change was that I used an 8-inch cake pan because my 9 was dirty. Lowered the oven a bit and baked for a bit longer. It was beautiful and slid right out of the pan...too bad I didn't have any company over for dinner!

I made this cornbread in a hurry to go with a pot of stew, and I was worried because there are so many good cornbread recipes.  This is my new favorite.  It's so easy to make and the reward is wonderful, sweet cornbread.  The only change I made was to substitute melted butter for the oil, but that's just because I didn't have oil on hand.  It was wonderful.  No more box mixes for me!

Great recipe! I made this for my bf and he really enjoyed it. I let the cornmeal soak for 10 minutes, and used only 2tps of baking powder, like other reviewers suggested. It turned out perfectly. I didn't have a round pan, so I used square.

We loved this!  I have a family history of elevated chlorestrol so this recipe made with oil was perfect.  I made some subsitutions.  As other raters suggested, I soaked the cornmeal in milk for 15 minutes.  I use a 50/50 mix of white flour and whole wheat.  Also used 50/50 mix of Splenda and brown sugar.   I added 3/4 cup of my mom's home grown sweet corn.  I substituted 1 whole egg with 2 egg whites.  I had enough batter to fill 12 mini muffin cups and put the remaining in a loaf pan...perfect. Because of the addition of the sweet corn I found that I had to bake the loaf pan an extra 10 minutes.   Great recipe and I will make this again and again.

This was great - very moist. Tweaked the recipe just a bit based on others' suggestions - 1 1/4 cups flour, 3/4 cup cornmeal, 1/2 cup sugar. Soaked the cornmeal in milk for 15 minutes. Also, didn't have 9" pan, so used 8", which worked well. Served with Sarge's EZ pulled pork.

I have made this several times now and each time I love it even more - so does everyone else.  It is the best cornbread I've ever had.  One thing I do is melt about 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup butter and pour it into the batter along with everything else and it makes the cornbread even more buttery and moist!!

I've made this recipe twice, once using 1/2 cup maple syrup and once using 1/2 cup raw sugar in place of the white sugar. Used a little less oil and added another egg. The extra egg truly solves the crumbly problem. I made it into 12 muffins. Awesome recipe! Thank you.

This is probably as good as cornbread gets.  It was very easy to make, I followed the instructions to a

This is a great cornbread recipe.  It does come out sweet and delicious.  My kids don't like the bitterness of most cornbreads, so I was looking for something a little sweeter.  They loved this one.  The cornbread is light and a little crumbly...perfect.

Excellent. I was out of jiffy cornbread mix and did not feel like going to the store to get more. I made this cornbread recipe, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tsp baking powder as others suggested and used a wire whisk to mix ingredients. It came out excellent. Thanks Lori!!

My family had chilli for dinner tonight and I made two pans of cornbread, one was this recipe which I had never tried before, and the other was Amusement Park Cornbread, also from this site (which I had made before and everyone liked) well this recipe is so much better!! It is easier (only one bowl), cooks quicker (even though they should take the same ammount of time) and has a wonderful golden color while APC remains kind of pale.  All of my family had a little piece of each and everyone said this was the better tasting cornbread also.  This will be my new standard, thanks so much for this great recipe!!

I tried doubling it in a 9x13 and made a few changes to the ingredients. It worked great - this is what I did: 2 c flour, 2 c cornmeal, 1 c sugar, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 3 tsp baking powder, 3 eggs, 2 c BUTTERMILK, 2/3 c veg oil. (I didn't have to alter the baking time or temp.)

I make this exactly as the directions dictate and we love it.  It makes a moist, sweet cake-like cornbread everyone in my family loves, especially my kids.  If you want something along the lines of the flavor and texture of Boston Market's cornbread, this is the recipe for you.  Yummy!

Awesome recipe!  Very easy to make.  Next time I think I may add canned sweet corn for an extra touch.  When it was done baking, I spread a little white sugar on top and put in in the broiler for about 1 minute.  It browned the top nicely and made it a little crispy.  Yum!

Great Recipe...I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 a cup and it was plenty sweet! I also reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp..but it didn't rise as high as I would have liked..I added 1 tsp of nutmeg for a wonderful spicy flavor!!

Very good, traditional cornbread recipe.  It's very easy to make, too.  I took another reviewer's advice and only used 3 tsp of baking powder.  I also used a 12 muffin pan, instead of a cake pan.  This worked fine, but 19 min was too long for the muffins.  They were a little to brown on the sides and bottom, but not burnt.  I would probably do 15 min for muffins.

This recipe is the best corn bread recipe we have tried.  My husband will even make this 'cause he just loves this corn bread.  It goes fast in our house.  We make it for church dinners and to take as hostess gifts when invited to friends or family to dine.

Just made this tonight. Followed recipe exactly, but cooked in pre-heated cast iron skillet (for 18 minutes). It was MARVELOUS, tender and not too sweet. I’ll definitely be making this again and again!

This cornbread is delicious! It has JUST the right amount of sweetness to it. It was crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy in the middle. I brought this to a big party and everybody loved it. I definitely recommend this. The only thing I did differently was instead of putting it into a cake pan I put it into a cast-iron skillet. This gave it that crispy effect on the outside.

I made this recipe in a cast iron pan a day before Thanksgiving and it was the easiest cornbread recipe to follow. Makes nice and crispy edges and keeps very well. Perfect hot with honey and butter. Not too sweet. Next time I will add chopped jalapenos for extra flavor :)

OMG this is sooooo tasty! I used 1/3 brown sugar along with 1/3 white. Butter and bacon grease in place of oil and stirred in 1/2 C diced green chiles and 1 C sharp (shredded) cheese before baking and it blew us away lol!!!  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

I should have taken more caution when I saw all the variations to the original, supposedly, five-star recipe. My wife usually uses Jiffy and adds a little cream corn and butter, but being Christmas Eve everything was closed and we really wanted some cornbread to go along with our smoked ribs, collard greens, and mac and cheese. So I Googled for the best cornbread recipe and this came at the top of Google's SEO (I really can't figure that one out). When I put the tray in the oven at 400° exactly like it said, the bread was already burning at about 17 minutes. When I tried the cornbread at the dinner table I immediately noticed a bitter and burning sensation in the back of my throat. My wife suggested that it could be the result of too much baking soda. So I looked up some other recipes and three and a half teaspoons of baking soda seems to be a little much - see the numerous reviews of people who would cut that down almost in half to 2 teaspoons. Not sure why everybody wants to add their own or take away to a crappy recipe. Why don't you just find a good recipe and stick to exactly what they say to do. Maybe I will post my wife's recipe sometime here soon. I cannot get the poisonous taste out of my throat.  Merry Christmas.

Gotta say I love Allrecipes! It’s my go to site for most things. 
This bread is almost identical to my grandmas! Minus  all the sugar and buttermilk instead of regular milk.  It’s very easy and delicious. I made this twice  but the second time I cut the sugar to 1/2 instead of 2/3 I may even cut the sugar just a tad bit more an I add a little Exeter milk for a more moist cornbread. 
 My grandma and grandpa didn’t like their bread sweet. You want cornbread not cake. I don’t find it messy at all when I slice mine? muffins or pan you decide either way its the best and easiest.

I allowed the cornmeal to sit in the milk for 10 minutes and I swapped grass fed cow butter for vegetable oil. Next time I'll reduce the sugar a wee bit but this was yummy and definitely a repeat recipe!!

This recipe is a good one except I added more milk to mine because the first time I made it..it turned out too dry..and crumbly...but about a half cup more milk made it perfect!

I never put as much sugar in any recipe as it calls for and the same rule fell here. But even removing some of the sugar this is a great, sweet cornbread.  I'm originally from the South, some will say "nay" to sweet cornbread because typically Southerners like cornbread savory.  (I like mine slightly sweet).  Rub it with butter (real butter) immediately following the bake time.  YUM

Simple recipe and excellent results!  I make this GLUTEN FREE, using Namaste GF flour.  It was fluffy and moist, I'm going to use more MASA corn meal next time to make it more on the CORN bread side.

Made it just as written, used whole milk. Cut the baking temp. to 390 degrees bcause oven runs hot. It was perfect in 20 minutes. Been a baker for over 35 years and my husband said it was the best cornbread he ever had. The crumb was moist and the flavor yummy.  Thank you for a great recipe!

SO EASY! And delicious. 
- I made it with Gluten-Free flour and it turned out fantastic.
- Didn't have a cake pan, so made muffins. The cook time would be more like 14 minutes in a muffin pan.
- I found it an itsy-bitsy-bit too sweet, so I will be cutting down the sugar a bit for the next round.
Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

It was delicioust  but I read a review (annanthony) and I used some of her ideas. I  used butter instead of the oil and I let the corn meal sit in the milk for 15 minutes before adding other ingredients. I think I will try using half brown sugar and half white next time cause the sweetness flavor needed something maybe a different sugar will help. It was very good and will definitely make again this is a keeper...

I made the recipe as is and my family loved it.  I did cut back the sugar slightly when making it a second time since I found it just a tad too sweet with the recommended sugar.  It's definitely a keeper!

This was a very good recipe. It came out moist and sweet, but I thought it was a bit too floury. I think with a bit more cornmeal and less flour this recipe would taste more like cornbread and less like angel food cake. I still enjoyed it though :)

So I totally stumbled onto this recipe by accident. I made a big pot of greens tonight (a lot of work for a weeknight but they were in sale for $1.50 a bunch so I couldn't  pass them up). Well anyway I reached in the pantry for the cornbread mix that starts with a j and ends with a y. Low and behold I didn't have any. I'm like what am I going to do? So I google cornbread recipes and this came up. I had all the ingredients on hand so I put it into my small cast iron skillet and stuck it in. Let me tell you, twenty minutes later (swoon)! No lie I'm going to make this for now on. AR saved the day! My family absolutely loved it and so did I. My seven year old son asked to take a piece in his lunch box tomorrow. This corn bread is the truth!

Can someone please explain to me what in the actual f***? I made this recipe with the suggestions of 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tsp baking powder, and I heated up a cast iron skillet enough to melt some butter for the coating. Also, we only had unsweetened vanilla almond milk on hand, but since it is supposed to substitute the same, I wasn't too worried, and I let the cornmeal soak in it while I got everything else ready.

I can't compare it to the recipe as listed but I can't imagine anything tasting much better. Get how perfect this is. Not only is it simple, takes less than five minutes to prep and only 20 to bake, my second time making it I completed omitted the oil. (I am a literal potato.)

  Devastated, I took the pan out 15 mins in and cut into it. To my surprise the knife came out clean. With the structural integrity intact, I figured it must be too dense or dry or crumbly. Tasted it. STILL PERFECT. Perfect without a 'staple' ingredient? Yep. Saving this recipe. 

I love sweet cornbread and usually top mine with honey, but with this recipe all I need is a little salted butter. New go time snack for tea. Sorry, waistline.

Great recipe. I've used it at least 3 times.  I would give this 5 Stars except for two things. It was a bit dry in texture and wasn't very sweet to me (not how I like anyhow). I took someone else's advice and added more oil (about 1/2 cup instead of 1/3) to combat the dryness. I also added some honey to the batter (not a lot; I made a squiggle so I'm not sure...maybe 1-2 tsp). All the difference! Overall, this is a really good starting space for those new to making cornbread.

Say goodbye to your Jiffy In a Box Cornbread! This recipe is spot on. It crumbles really well so I prefer to use it as a base when making homemade stuffing (or dressing if that's what you prefer to call it) and it always comes out so well. Perfect year round but extra special for the Holidays.

AWESOME. AWESOME AWESOME.

My only changes were to use a 1/3 cup brown and a 1/3 cup white sugar instead of just white. Also, cornbread pro tip: let your cornmeal soak in the milk for ~15 minutes before you mix it in. Also let your finished batter sit for 4-5 minutes before you pour it in the pan. Stir it again and then pour + bake. You'll end up with amazing, fluffy bread. Huge hit in my house. And don't listen to the person who said it crumbles too easily; it's no fault of the recipe.

I tried this recipe one time and it came out basically perfect.  My family loved it and I will absolutely make this again.  Some of the reviews I read said it was a sloppy, crumbly mess...Mine was not.  It was just the right consistency and didn't break up when sliced or taken out of the pan.  Really, really good! Thank you for this recipe.

400° burnt the bread :-( So I recommend 
   - 375° ? (40 miners doubled)
   - Buttermilk (instead of milk)
   - Butter (instead of oil)
   - Raw sugar (instead of white, or brown its has a stronger molasses flavor)
   - Soak the cornmeal in the milk for 10+ min

*And the biggest suggestion, doubble the recipe because it is SOOO GOOD! Thanks @Bluegirl!!!

We use this to make corn muffins and they turn out perfectly, every time. The key is to make sure you don't over cook them. Begin to check for doneness after 10 minutes. These are amazing. :)

This is the only cornbread recipe I go to now. I add a can (15oz(?)) of creamed corn to add just a little texture and moistness. I've found in doing this no cooking time or temp adjustment is necessary.

For years I've used Trader Joe's cornbread mix and found nothing to compare.  Last week however, I was snow bound and had no TJ mix.  I found this recipe and discovered a cornbread recipe that's even better than my old standby!  Some reviewers found it dry, but mine wasn't at all.  I do need to note that in my oven it only took 22 minutes.

My husband and teen boys LOVED this cornbread. After dinner they kept coming back for a piece until they finished it off.  I'm putting this into my monthly rotation (would make it every week but then it's not as special).

Perfect! Family loved it. This is a recipe to always keep on hand. I didn't change a thing, made it as is, in a cast iron skillet.

Thank you. I made this cornbread for Thanksgiving today it was amazing!!! My family and friends loved it!!This is my favorite recipe thus far. I only substituted the cup of milk for 1 cup of Almond milk and 3/4 cup of raw organic sugar in place of the 2/3cup of white sugar.It wasn't too sweet with the added sugar.(I always add a bit more sugar to any cornbread recipe) It came out perfectly and was done in 25 minutes.

You cannot begin to imagine how simple this recipe is or how great it tastes,until you try it.I make this every single week,it's a must have for my husband,and all his friends at work figure that his wife is such a great cook after tasting this cornbread.I use brown sugar instead of white,and I cover the pan with foil while it's baking to make it really moist.I sometimes add some canned corn for the extra crunch,but it's great as is.It's FANTABULOUS!!

I love how this turned out!  I always add less sugar than recommended, so I used 1/2 a cup of Turbinado sugar.  I used Bob's Red Mill Polenta (corn grits) instead of a Quaker type cornmeal.  Lastly, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.   I will definitely make this again as it was quick and easy.

I just used this recipe tonight. As i was getting the ingredients together I realized I didn't have any all purpose flour but I really wanted cornbread tonight so I used the cake flour I have on hand. The cornbread turned out so fluffy and moist.I almost felt like I was cheating on the cornbread and milk adage we all grew up with.Along with the cake flour I doubled the recipe and added 1/3 cup more sugar b/c the batter was a bit bitter. My kids and wife loved it as well and told me I have to make it again

Best cornbread I've made to date. Big hit with guests. I made it with Pamela's gluten free all-purpose flour blend (no one even tasted a difference!), and added smoked gouda and 1 green onion.

I used this receipe and it was good but I made it better because I wanted it to be moist every time. I added a tablespoon of sour cream to the milk and egg mixture and used self-rising cornmeal mix to get more air into the baking. It turns out so light and moist every single time.

Since I found this recipe for cornbread it's the only one I use.  It is the best tasting, moist and easy to make cornbread ever, better than all of the TV country cooks' recipes for cornbread.  I also cut the sugar a bit but it didn't make a difference, it still tasted delicious.  If you love cornbread (and who doesn't?), you should try this recipe.  I eat it with local honey.  Yum...  Also made corn muffins with same recipe, worked well.

This is DELICIOUS cornbread! My hubby is a born & raised southern boy and he loves his sweet cornbread (as I do, too!).  He just told me to never buy the box mix anymore (which was his favorite forever!).  As so many other reviews suggested:  I let the corn meal and milk soak while I prepared everything else.  Note:  my hubby is a diabetic and also must restrict sodium soooo I used 1/2 t. salt, 2 t. low sodium baking powder, a splash more oil and substituted Splenda's "white" sugar blend for baking.  Winner, winner!!!

3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder was way too much and the bread had a strong taste of baking powder and 400 degrees was too high and aster 25 minutes was undone in the middle.

Great recipe! Like other reviewers I used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of all white sugar. I also soaked the cornmeal in the milk for 10 minutes before mixing in other ingredients. 

This recipe also makes exactly 12 muffins if you want to make muffins instead of in a bread/cake pan. Just fill them up to about 1/4 inch from the top of the muffin cup (with paper liners). For me, they were done in 20 minutes at 400 degrees.

I made these a couple weeks ago and loved them so much I'm making them again tonight. I drizzled a little honey over top and it was to die for. I made them in a muffin pan and it came out just great, they're pretty big muffins so I have to cut them in half.

The perfect cornbread except for one thing...  The Corn.  One cup of frozen corn mixed into the batter gives this recipe some true grit.

This was, by far, the best cornbread I have ever had! And cornbread is something I LOVE! I followed a ton of reviews and got a super-moist, tasty cornbread. Advice I followed: Soaked cornmeal in milk, used melted butter instead of veg oil (and I added a little over a T more than called for) and more salt.  I also took someone else's advice and put the pan in the oven with a T of butter until it was hot and bubbly before adding the batter. Nice, buttery crust all around the edges... absolute must try!

Tweak alert! I used 1/3 cup agave instead of sugar. Because of this sub I had to use just a titch less milk. I found the bread a little crumbly but maybe it's supposed to be that way. Cornbread is not typical where I live so I don't really know how it should be. I do know that this was delish and especially good right out of the oven. I had some Portugal peppers in my freezer so I added one chopped to spice it up a bit. I will make this again. Thank you bluegirl

I have made this recipe quite a few times. I love it!
I made some small changes though as I am vegan. I found that if I used unsweetened vanilla soy milk, it added a nice sweet flavor but wasn't overpowering. I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and used just a touch of agave. I also used corn flour instead of cornmeal and an egg-replacer. This makes a moist and not-crumbly-at-all, super awesome cornbread!

This is a great recipe!  But be careful of how you read the baking soda ingredient measure.  It is a total of one and a half teaspoons (three of half teaspoon measures), not 3 1/2 teaspoons!  My second try came out very bitter and that was why.

A terrible recipe.  This cornbread just fall into crumbles when you try to eat it.  The taste is ok, but the consistency makes it inedible with anything other than a spoon.

I just baked these using the suggested 1/3 c white & 1/3 c brown sugar instead of 2/3 c white.  I also soaked the cornmeal at least 15 min in the cup of milk first. I used an equal mix of walnut oil and coconut oil in place of the 1/3 c vegetable oil. I sprayed a muffin tin then used paper cups and the batter made 12 muffins.  Baked 18 min. in 400 degree oven and knife came out clean.  Lightly browned tops.  Delicious!

Simple, easy and delicious.  The perfect, classic cornbread.  I didn't change a thing and it turned out great.  So fast there's no need to ever buy store-made cornbread.  Will definitely make again.

For you Diabetics, or Cbef's, substitute sugar for 1/3 cup of sugar substitute(1/3 of sugar). Also for lactose intolerance and gluten issues, substitute the Milk for Almond Milk, same volume for added flavor, less flaky, and the same fulfilling flavor plus vitamins. Also makes it more of a cornbread cake using almond milk, sweet or unsweetened. Sweetened, you don't need any sugar at all!

I didn't find this recipe as amazing as most.  Fairly typical recipe, and although the flavor was fine, we didnt find it to be anything to brag about.   we had a difficult time eating it as it crumbled easily.  I will continue to seek out another recipe.

I feel there is way too much baking soda inthis recipe.  I thought 3 1/2 teaspoons was a lot, but the first two reviews – all I had read – raved about it, so I followed it. Boy, was that a mistake. Even my three-year-old daughter, who has never met a carbohydrate she doesn't love, said, "I don't like this." Basically, it tasted like delicious cornbread that had been ruined by baking soda.  Definitely reduce the amount; I will try again with 2 teaspoons.

My husband's pretty picky about his cornbread and is pretty devoted to Jiffy. I tried out this recipe, and he loved it! As someone suggested, I swapped out the oil for butter. I also added some honey to it. It was moist and delicious! And sooooooo easy--as a grad student with two jobs and a baby at home, I was happy to find this was ridiculously easy to make.

So easy and quick, and delicious! I had some buttermilk on hand so I used that, and subbed melted butter for the oil. Also used half brown sugar and half white sugar....and cut it back a bit. Perfect with chicken tortilla soup at half time!

I have this recipe memorized and use it every time I make cornbread! My kids love it!

Recipe revamped instead of 2/3 cup of sugar I use 1/3 cup to tame the sweetness. I still tastes good after all these years!

Good flavor, a little bit crumbly.  Don't reduce the sugar, this helps give it moisture.

Just tried it this morning after I had a huge craving for Cornbread. It was easy to make, I was literally on emails and conference calls while whipping this up and it turned out great. I actually used a 9inch glass pan and it worked fine too.

I LOVE THIS CORNBREAD!!!

Even my husband loves it, and he has some anti-cornbread baggage.

It never lasts a day in our household. And living abroad, it makes me feel really American when I make it ;)

YES! I've been trying to make good cornbread for months now, with mixed success. This recipe hit a home run. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and the baking soda to 2 tsp. I sprayed a muffin tin with non-stick spray and the batter filled the 12 cups exactly. After 17 minutes the corn muffins were nicely browned on the bottom, with a crisp exterior and a chewy interior. PERFECT. I resisted making other changes to the recipe, but I want to try other sweeteners (like agave or honey) and maybe adding some corn to the batter. But since it turned out so delicious, maybe I should just leave well enough alone! Thank you for this recipe.

I've been making cornbread for most of my life, but grew tired of my same-o, same-o recipe. This was a delightful find. I've made it several times for potlucks and have gone home with an empty plate! Not long ago I decided to make a pan just for me. I assemble the ingredients right into the bowl and then realized I didn't have any milk. Bummer..., but oh well I used water instead. This recipe is every bit as good with water as it is with milk. I don't think it effected the taste or texture at all. Thank you for a great recipe.

Very good!  I use half butter, half oil instead of all oil.  I also use buttermilk powder and water instead of milk.  4X the recipe fills two jelly roll pans.  I line the pans with parchment paper.  I get lots of compliments on this version of the recipe!

This is a great, quick, delicious and easy recipe! I stopped buying the box store brand and now I make this one. I also use less sugar   and add a little bit more cornmeal to make it a crumble less. I made it for a neighbor that thought it was cake! Thank you for this recipe!!

I will admit I don't care for cornbread.  I do like it when mixed with a white/yellow cake mix. I didn't have a box of cornbread mix to mix with a white cake mix so I used this recipe and used half of a prepared boxed white cake mix.  I replaced the white flour in this recipe with whole wheat pastry flour.  It was delicious!  I also liked that it didn't make a huge amount (since I had add it to the cake mix).

Excellent cornbread! I made it exactly as the recipe states and it turned out very well. I'd probably make it as muffins instead of a cake pan next time, since it is very crumbly, but overall very good.

Perfect recipe. Came out moist and just the right amount of sweetness. No 'eggy' flavor like some other recipes. I replaced 1/3 cup vege oil with 1/2 cup butter.

I will never buy Jiffy again!  This didn't take any longer to prepare than a boxed mix, and the ingredients are pronounceable and safe.  After reading the reviews, I decided to modify the recipe a little.  I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup packed brown sugar.  I also reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp, and I used 1/3 cup melted, salted butter instead of vegetable oil.  I baked it in a greased 9" round cake pan for 20 minutes at the recommended temperature.  The cornbread turned out beautifully!  It was moist, thick, and not too sweet even when dressed with honey.  My husband said, "This is the best cornbread I've ever had!"  I'm sold, too.

Great recipe! Made it to go with my partners chili and it was perfect. I like how it crumbles a little bit, much moister as a result. I replaced 1/2 the sugar content with brown sugar, and added 1/2 can of whole corn kernels and 1/2 a fresh jalapeno as well... thumbs up!

Wow I just adore this corn bread (although I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup). Such a simple easy recipe made from basic pantry ingredients.  Love both the taste and the texture.  Thank you for sharing!

The best Cornbread! Sweet and grainy the way cornbread should be! Perfect with homemade chili. The best part was it was so easy it was ready in under 30 mins. The only modifications I made was, I added 1/3 cup more sugar, I also greased the baking pan with margarine and 1 can sweet corn (drained) and then when the bread comes out spread 2 tbsps of margarine over the loaf.

I made this last night to go with a big pot of beef stew, though I varied it a bit to make it a bit more healthy: I substituted whole wheat flour for the white, halfed the sugar ( it still turned out plenty sweet ) and I melted 1/3 cup of light becel in place of the vegetale oil. The texture was perfect, and the kids gobbled up 2 pieces each! Thanks for the great recipe, I will definitely be using it again!

Wow! just what I wanted. Altho I've made corn bread before, this was just the most yummy. I eat cornbread about once every 5 years and this was well worth the wait. I did add a little more sugar because I love it SWEET and that was perfect and so easy. Too easy to not make!!! Wish I could give 10 stars ;)

Exceptionally well! :) I used butter instead of oil and used 1/2 a cup of sugar instead of 2/3 cup. It was still really sweet though. So next time I will use 1/4 cup of sugar. I'm definitely saving this recipe for future use! And I will never buy a package mix again. :P

I baked these in a muffin pan for 15 minutes and they came out great. You can use this exact recipe for a side dish, or add a glaze for a sweet dessert.

This cornbread was deliciously moist and sweet I did however reduce the sugar by half a cup and added 1/3 cup of honey and sliced all beef hot dogs up into the batter and baked up some corn dog muffins! They were a huge hit with kids and adults alike last night thanks for this recipe.

I just made these (as mini muffins 8 minutes) and they are yummy.  I did think it was odd that some found them too sweet.  I thought they could use a little more sugar.  Then i realized i had left it out altogether.  Still yummy and great texture.  I'll try to get them right next time. Soon, i hope.

This is the BEST recipe for sweet cornbread that I have ever tasted!!  My husband loves it also!!  We are absolutely addicted to it!!  I have also made them into muffins as they are easier to eat that way.  I found with my oven if I made the cake I needed to leave it in for 30 minutes.  If I made it into muffins 20 monies seems to be the apprppopriate amount of time for the muffins to be done.  I would suggest moms who want to put these on their kids lunches to try making the muffins...as they pack much easier.  These muffins really freeze well and defrost really well.  Making them into muffins also makes them easier to put in the freezer.

I made this cornbread excatly as written except i used a glass 8x8 pan.  And i had to cook it about 40-45 mins....

Other then that I think the cornbread was very yummy.  I like my cornbread VERY sweet and I think i could have added more sugar to be honest.
I will def. make this again!

Thank Bluegirl!

I just made these today as muffins (12 muffins 400 degrees for 15min).  They are very good.  I would have given them a 5, but they need something.  I'm not sure what.  I am going to read more reviews to get an idea how to tweak them next time I make them.  Definately a great starter recipe.  Thanks for the recipe.

I decreased the sugar to 1/3 c and it was still plenty sweet. Next time I will add a little extra salt. I used an iron skillet which was oiled and preheated before I added the batter.

Followed another reviewers directions of using 1/3 c. white and 1/3 c. brown sugar, and then letting the cornmeal soak in the milk for 10-15 minutes before mixing with the other ingredients. I've also followed the suggestion of replacing the vegetable oil with melted butter, which works very well. It came out sweet and wonderful when covered in chili.

Very easy to prepare, and the corn bread was delicious. It is definitely a sweet bread though, not as savory. My only change was that I cut the white sugar in half and used half brown sugar.

Found this recipe this morning and made it this morning. Thoughts? It is a very good recipe -- with perfect light sweetness. It also isn't "cakey" or overly "crumbly", like some cornbreads. It held together nicely and had very good texture. Why didn't I give it 5 stars? I'm not sure -- perhaps because it didn't 100% hit the mark for me, even though the recipe is delicious.

Very good but i tweeked it a bit. I used 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/3 c milk, 1/4 c melted butter instead of oil and 1 c sour cream to make it moist. It was super good and VERY MOIST. It just seemed like it called for too much milk and baking powder. The sour cream i got from another recipe and just kinda combined it with this one.

Thank you bluegirl.  I have been looking for a recipe that I like and I've found it.  I've made this twice now - once as it which was AWESOME and the second time subbing milk for low fat buttermilk.  That was really GOOD!  Thanks again.

I have tried several recipes, and both my husband and I feel that this is by far the very best of them all!  Thank you for a great recipe!  I had to use part melted butter and part veg. oil as I didn't have enough when I made them the first time.  So tonight I will try the all oil instead.

Added 2TBS of agave nectar and reduced sugar to 1/2 Cup. Used 1/4 cup butter instead of oil.  Nice and moist.

Great! Flexible, too... I added about three tablespoons of soft butter and cut the oil by a little bit. I was out of oil. My Texan hubby approves of this cornbread - and I was worried, since I'm a born and bred Ohio Valley Yankee :)

It was okay, but the recipe called for too much salt. The bread came out salty, and the kids complained too. Other than that it was great :)

This recipe makes absolutely fantastic cornbread - it is the best I have ever had, and I would certainly use it again. I didn't need to make any changes, although I like the idea of baking the batter in muffin cases and reducing the time in the oven.

This is the BEST cornbread I've ever eaten! I served it with frijoles and spanish rice and my family loved it. I did use powdered milk instead of regular milk and it was still incredible. Thanks for sharing!

I love cornbread, so it was important for me to find a recipe that I could make from scratch that I can make. I followed this recipe EXACTLY, and it came out PERFECT! This is absolutely a recipe that I will make over and over again and call my own.

I made this cornbread for the 1st time tonight (using the recipe just as it is) and it is completely amazing!  I love sweet cornbread and this is a very moist, cakey cornbread.  I love it!  No more boxed corn muffin mix for me!

On it's own, this corn bread is a sweet treat. But paired with chili it comes off as overpoweringly sweet. My boyfriend loved it, but as I ate it with my chili, I could only say "this is god-awful sweet - way too sweet!" It's a good recipe with a great result, just not what I was looking for at all. I will try the Buttery Corn Bread recipe by Nicole Callen next.

Awesome cornbread! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was crumbly.The flavor is great tho.  Not sure what I did wrong because I followed the recipe. Any suggestions?

This recipe is fantastic--I will never buy cornbread mix again!  I swap out butter/margarine for the oil and add a swirl of honey on top before I bake it.  SO. GOOD.  And leftovers never go to waste--I crumble up a few pieces, add milk, and microwave for a quick breakfast/snack.  As my family tries to save money and eat healthier, I'm starting to make more and more things from scratch.  Thanks, bluegirl for helping us along the frugal gourmet path!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. I thought it was good, but not exceptional. It was picture-perfect--nice and golden on the top and the round shape was not a problem. I've read a few of the other reviews and I really can't see how any of those changes would have made it better. I would definitely not have cut out the sugar. Guess I just like mine sweet! I think I would look for another recipe next time, just to see what else is out there.

A wonderful starter for anyone looking for the basic recipe. It`s simple and you can customize it anyway you like! I reduce the sugar and add more honey in mine for a hearty sweetness.

Delicious!!  Only minimal changes I made were I made them in a muffin tin at 400 for 15 mins, and I also added about a Tablespoon of melted butter to the batter before baking.  Will definitely make again!

OMG...this really is the best cornbread ever!  My 3-yr-old even made it, so easy and simple.  No more boxed mix for me.  Great, real flavor, delightfully dense...used butter instead of oil, rest same.  Perfect.  Great with honey.

Excellent recipe!  Like many of the other reviewers, I too, have been looking for a new corn bread recipe and this one is definitely a keeper!  I did not change a single thing, only the baking pan; I baked the corn bread in a 9" x 9" square baking pan for 20 minutes.  Absolutely love this recipe!!!

Good recipe!  I had to use 'corn grits' instead of cornmeal since that is all they had in Japan.  I also substituted some melted butter for part of the vegetable oil (used about half of each).

I made this recipe last night and served it with homemade chili. It was great! I made them in muffin liners to have individual portions. We had some leftovers and ate them today, warmed up a little bit in the microwave with a dab of butter and maple syrup. Delicious! Will make it again for sure!

Cut back on the sugar it's way too sweet.  Use butter instead of oil, add a tsp. of vanilla and voila - a totally delicious result that leaves my grandchildren begging for more.

Very Good!!! I was looking for a sweeter cornbread recipe and this is it.  I would use just regular cornmeal.  I used stone ground coarse and it had a bitter aftertaste. Very light and crumbly. A little honey and you are ready to go.

Excellent cornbread! I make a couple of small changes: First, I use 1/3 cup of Cane Sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, and then I exchange 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1/6 cup of Canola oil for the 1/3 cup vegetable oil, which makes the cornbread more moist. People say it tastes like fresh corn on the cob :)

Though I haven't tried any other cornbread recipes, this one turned out perfect.  We followed the recipe to the T, and I don't know what I'd change, if anything.  It is a hair sweet, but that's the point of this recipe, hence the name!  If you wanted it less sweet you could cut the sugar in half.  Personally I think cornbread tastes better sweet rather than bland and crumbly.  I made this in a 12-cupcake pan and it was the perfect amount of batter.  We will definitely use this recipe from now on.

This cornbread recipe is fantastic! I only tweaked it a little by reducing the sugar to 1/3 cup, added a tad of vanilla and used lowfat buttermilk I had leftover in my freezer...the batter is just enough for 12 muffins I honestly couldn't stand waiting the 15 mins for them to come out of the oven! Sooo, I saved some leftover batter and cooked it like you would pancakes on a hot griddle...cornbread flapjacks with some butter and honey...I just about died an am anxiously waiting for a muffin now! All I have to say is NOM NOMMER-NOM NOMS!!!

This is a very good recipe and easy to make. Usually all the ingredients I have on hand. If you like Marie Calendars corn bread, you will like this.

I scaled recipe for 18 servings and filled 17 muffin liners almost full. The only change I made was to add a small drained can of kernal corn. Baked at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes. Served with a sauce made of half melted butter and half honey. Received many complements from my guests.

This is the best corn bread I've ever had.  Just a hint of sweetness and easy to make.  I forgot the rising agent one time and it was dense and STILL delicious.  Thank you!

I have been searching for a great cornbread recipe for a LONG time! I wanted something straightforward, simple, yet out of this world-- this recipe did it for me! I'm a HUGE fan of Famous Dave's cornbread and let me tell you... this is the closest I could get to it as far as satisfaction in my own home!! LOVE IT!

Excellent recipe! I have made it with white flour, and I've tried it with wheat flour. Wheat flour for some reason makes this recipe a little moister.

I Cut the sugar to 1/2 c. And used a splenda/sugar mixture...and it was still too sweet.I can taste sugar more than corn! I used light butter/oil combo to make 1/3 cup, and 3 tsp baking powder to make it less crumbly, as others suggested. the texture was excellent, so next time I would cut the sugar even more.

Amazing!  I did the butter in skillet preheat, and then baked in skillet too.  Soo good!  We are huge fans of the Marie Calendar cornbread, and this is very comparable and cheaper too!

I wanted to try something different, so I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  This recipe did have a good taste to it, but it seemed more like cake than cornbread.  If you like sweet cornbread, then you'll like this.  I've lived in the south my entire life and this just isn't cornbread to me.  I'll stick with my old recipe.

If you are not a fan of cornbread (like I am), you might actually end up liking cornbread if you try this recipe. Anytime I try cornbread, I never like it. I decided to give this a try and I see why it was rated high with a lot of great reviews. Followed the exact recipe and it turned out perfect! Tasted more like a cake. It was moist and soft (not fluffy to where it's crumbling). Taste great with some honey!!

I absolutely love this bread, the taste is very good, very sweet. I only wish it stayed together more instead of crumbling. But other than that it is a GREAT recipe. The flavor is so good I find that I don't need butter if I don't want it.

PEFECTO!!! I had just enough white sugar for 1/3 cup. Had to use brown sugar for the other third cup. Turned out fantastic!!! People noticed a different sweetness but they loved it.

This is the perfectly sweetened cornbread I was looking for!  I made it along with chili for the Superbowl last night and people loved it.  I doubled it but didn't make any changes to the recipe and it came out great!

Definitely a keeper! This was on the money! I was looking for a cornbread recipe that would not result in a grainy, mealy taste. This cornbread was great. Taste similar to the Trader Joe's box version. I added about a 1/2 cup of frozen corn which my kids prefer.

Absolutely delicious, and so easy to make!!  I made muffins instead of using the cake pan, and only used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the full amount.  We didn't miss a thing.  They were sweet, yummy, and GONE!!  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.

go-to cornbread recipe. I grind my own corn for fresh cornmeal and substitute melted butter for the oil and bake it in an oiled cast iron skillet in the oven.  Yummy--also doubles well in the same skillet.

Amazing cornbread. I substituted white cornmeal for the yellow & used butter instead of oil. Made it in a cast iron skillet coated with melted butter, WONDERFUL!

This recipe produces the best Cornbread I have ever had. I did however reduce sugar to 1/2 cup and substituted the vegetable oil for 1/3 cup of softened butter. Excellent

I have NEVER made cornbread. Always eaten others or store made. I tried about 4 diff. kinds before I tried this one. My family LOVES this recipe!! The only complaint was that it might be just a tad to sweet so I'm cutting my recipe down. Very tasty! This is a keeper in my book!

my family is Jiffy Muffin lovers...until I found this recipe!  This was so close to the taste of jiffy, they didn't realize we changed.  I put in only 1 cup sugar b/c it was just a hair too sweet.  But then it was worth a test b/n the two.  This is by far the best cornbread i've tried.

Made this for thanksgiving.  I doubled the recipe and made 2, froze one and took one to work.  It is exceptional, very moist and the perfect amount of sweetness.  I didn't make any changes to this recipe. So simple too.  I highly recommend.

The bread turned out good but I thought it was too sweet for anymore honey on it. I cut the sugar in half the 2nd time I made it and it was better.

I can say this is the perfect cornbread recipe. It is moist and tasty. I only altered it by adding 1/2 cup sweet corn kernels, and it added a nice texture.

this recipe is perfect.  my husband is very picky about cornbread and he said these are better than a certain name brand that starts with a J.  I make this recipe as muffins and we are addicted to them.  I am going to try adding cooked sausage or bacon and cheese to a batch soon.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!!

Yes, it is a sweet cornbread as the recipe describes.  I've made this a bunch of times and it is quick, easy and on the table in about half an hour including prep time.  Reliable and a family favorite.

This is the perfect cornbread for Northerners and other people who prefer their cornbread sweet. Tender on the inside, with a lovely crust on top. I made the recipe as written, and can't think of a thing I would change.  My husband keeps asking me over and over, "You made this from scratch?"  I sure did, and it's better than any mix!

Delicious! After reading some reviews, I also lessened the sugar to about 1/2 cup, and it was still plenty sweet! Yum yum, this is going to be my go-to cornbread recipe.

This cornbread was the best!  I didn't change a thing and found it to be moist and only as crumbly as cornbread should be!  I will NEVER use a box mix again. The only thing I had to make a trip to the market for was the cornmeal..everything else was already in my pantry.  Great recipe.

I used whole wheat-white flour, an organic egg, buttermilk instead of plain milk and melted butter instead of oil. My family liked it, but I think they like a cakier cornbread. It did come out a little dry, but that could be either that I used whole wheat white or the recipe, as I wasn't the first reviewer to have this outcome. This helped use pantry items I have on hand, as it's right before the huge shopping trip and I'm low on almost everything.

Yum Yum! I did modify by using 1/2 c sugar; 2 Tbsp baking powder; almond milk in place of cow's milk; and applesauce in place of vegetable oil.

Since relocating from my home in Oahu to Texas. One of the things I have been super homesick for is Zippy's chili & their killah cornbread. When this recipe popped up I decided to try it and OMG!!! It tastes just like the kine you get at Zippy's! Now I can make this cornbread at home and reminisce of the good times.

I recommend watching the bread cook after 18 minutes. 20 is not quite long enough but 25 burnt it for us.

This is the absolute best cornbread on the planet! I do not change a thing, other then that I double the recipe every time. I have made it several times for events for my daughters school. Her History teacher and her administrator beg for my cornbread. It is the only one I will ever make now. :)

Oh my!  Was looking for a great base recipe and this was it.  Of course my twist included everything but the kitchen sink.  Basically I go by what I have on hand.  No AP flour so used Self Rising w/o the baking powder or soda.  Need it sweet so substituted 1/3 cup light brown sugar, 1/3 agave nectar, oh and 1/3 of a pack instant vanilla (sugar free) pudding which helps to keep it sweet, moist and together)  She's nuts!!! No No No! It works.  Then an overly full tablespoon of chopped jalapeno peppers, about 1/2 cup cooked and chopped up whole kernel corn, and 1/3 of a cup low fat yogart.  OK that's enough.  Not!  After mixing and filling pan, topped it off with sprinkles of real bacon bits.  The aroma alone will kill ya!  Brought it over to my picky neighbors who inhaled it.  Ahhh need I say more?

I cannot adequately review this recipe because I altered it to make it gluten free. I will thank you for this recipe though because it gave me an awesome base to start with!!

Great recipe! I used SR flour in place of AP flour, salt and baking soda. Turned out delicious. It has a slightly heavy cakey consistency, the way good cornbread is meant to be!! Thanks so much. Will make again and again...

This has become my go-to recipe. I still add my own touches which are NOT figure friendly but make it ohhhhh soooooo good. I cook bacon and crumble it up in the batter, i also use the bacon grease instead of veg oil and I sometimes cut the milk back and add a can of creamed corn. I also cook it in a cast iron skillet that is preheated in the oven so it sizzles as i pour the batter in. It gives it a wonderful crust. We eat it with just butter, apple butter or other toppings after we've had our chili! AWSOME!

when i was preparing my ingredients to make this corrnbread, i realized that i had run out of all-purpose flour and only had organic whole wheat flour. Using the whole wheat flour, I had to add an extra egg and about a 1/4 cup more milk because I was afraid it was going to turn out too dense!   with those modifications, it turned out GREAT!  everyone at work loved it esp. with some Earth Balance butter smeared on top. will definitely use again and again!

I have to eat gluten free, so used a flour substitute.  Don't know if that was the problem or that I am addicted to the Absolute Mexican Cornbread out here! It was just a little plain.

Perfect!  This is so easy and delicious, I never even need to try another cornbread recipe.  Cornbread tends to fall apart easily so I like to make it into mini-muffins, which I bake at the same temp (400) for only 7 minutes.  A dab of butter on the top and it's the perfect bite-size piece!  I've successfully cut the recipe in half and in 2/3 with no trouble.  The recipe as written makes about 3 dozen mini muffins.

This was really good cornbread.  I combined several other reviewers' recommendations and soaked the cornmeal in the milk, used a combination of brown and white sugars and added a splash of vanilla.  I thought it had just the right amount of sweetness.

Great recipe.  If you are looking for the southern/ jiffy mix  type tasting cornbread (not the sweet new england style)  this is it.  It taste like jiffy but 10x better.  I was short on the suger (because i ran out of it)  but like other reviewers stated, less sugar was just fine too

Excellent. I used 1/2 the sugar and it was still sweet enough.    The batter was easy to make, directions easy. I baked it in my grandmother's iron cornbread form (looks like corn forms).  Took it out at 18 minutes and let set untill cooled, about 1 hour.  The cooler it got, the easiet it was to take out. You could make this and let it sit all day. Loved this.  Tastes just like an old-time recipe. Thx

I made this last night - it's as easy as opening a box.  The corn bread is the best I ever had. Very moist; I may actually be able to eat the leftovers for a couple of days.  I filed it in my "favorites" file.

Best cornbread ever...I added 1/2 cup of plain yoghurt because of the comments that it was a tad crumbly.  It turned out moist and rich.  I also cut salt to 1/2 tsp, and added only 2 tsp baking powder, like other reviewers.

This is the best sweet cornbread recipe I've found.  I mix it up a bit by adding a can of whole kernel corn to it- that is how my family likes their cornbread- and it's amazing!!  Love it

yum! Fast, delicious and simple.  Just how I like it.  However next time I might use medium ground cornmeal or skew the ratio of cornmeal to flour...less flour, more cornmeal. And more oil to make it less crumbly.

This was my first try at making Cornbread an d I must say, I just could not wait for it to cool down a little. I tried it literally straight out the oven and all I could think of was my Sister-in-Laws favorite word... "AWESOMENESS"!!! My husband and son loved it as well! Thank you for posting this recipe! You Rock!

Delicious cornbread.  Flavor was just what I was looking for, but I wanted something a little less crumbly.  It went over well with my family, but they thought it fell apart too easy.  Once it cooled, it sliced up nice.  I'll make it again, but I'll add a little extra oil to see if it holds up a little better when it's hot.  We like to eat it right out of the oven, with plenty of butter melting away on it.   It was absolulely perfect for crumbling on top of a bowl of beans.

This is a really great cornbread. I grew up eating savory cornbread but my husband likes sweet so I tried this and we love it! I made a double batch but I left the sugar the same. I added 3 packets of powdered stevia for some extra sweet without the calories. I also added an 8 oz can of cream style corn and I reduced the oil to 2 tablespoons. I thought it was perfect but my hubby thought it could have been a touch sweeter. Next time I'll probably add a bit more sugar.

This cornbread is absolutely delicious.  We used to just make cornbread out of a box and top it with butter and honey, which was pretty good.  This cornbread doesn't even need any condiments on top, because it is so sweet, flavorful and moist.  I made it last week to accompany some squash turkey chili, and my partner said it is the best cornbread he's ever had.  He has extremely discriminating taste, and is an amateur chef himself, but has requested that I make this cornbread at least once a week.  Also, he took a big slice of it to work for lunch the next day and ended up sitting next to someone else who also had brought homemade cornbread.  When she saw that hers was much denser, flatter and drier than his, she said, "well, mine is homemade," (as though that excuses bad food!) and he just said "oh" and sat back to revel in the glory of this fantastic bread :-)

This cornbread was so easy to put together, but the results were first class!  One bowl preparation, the ingredients were spot on and stuff I already had on hand, and I easily adapted them to muffin format.  I added a couple tablespoons of honey because I was looking for a sweeter pairing with my spicy chili, and it was so, so good.  The crumb was moist and delicious, while the outside had a great crunch.  It made 12 perfectly sized muffins, which I baked at 400 for fifteen minutes.  Yum!  This is my new go-to recipe for cornbread.  Try it with the honey, you'll love it!

This was ok, but no more than ok. The flavor was ok. The texture was pretty crumbly, like to the point where there was no hope for cutting out a wedge, slitting it half, filling the middle with butter, putting it back together, and then eating it. And if you can't butter your cornbread, then it's not really cornbread :-) It loses a star for being so crumbly, but it keeps 4 for taste, because the taste really is good.

You've found it....the perfect recipe for sweet cornbread. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was definitely noticeably sweet, but I feel like anything more would be like a muffin. I cut down on baking powder to about 2 1/4 tsp and used a pinch more oil for added moisture. I filled up a muffin pan and baked until golden brown. Perfection! They were gone before the rest of dinner was. This is now my go-to cornbread recipe. I recommend making them in muffin form rather than in a pan for easy serving and convenient storage. These are FABULOUS cut in half with butter spread on a each half.

i really like this. next time i'll cut the salt, and maybe a bit of the sugar. i knew that i should have used the full 2/3 cup of white sugar, but i did 1 white and 1 light brown sugar. so my bread is sweet, but not tooth achingly sweet. i love the outside crunch. i did pour it into a 9inch foil pie pan, no spilling over. i'm sure using soy milk would not have been a problem

Great recipe!  I used a 9-inch glass pie dish and it worked wonderfully.  The cornbread is moist and everyone loved it!

This recipe is great , it tastes wonderful  except that it is crumbly . I used the round cake pan but I think making it as muffins would have  been  better , I'll do that the next time.This recipe reminds me of the Jiffy corn muffin mix.

This is a great recipe!  I made muffins and baked them for 20 minutes.  I loved the flavor & texture.  They are pretty sweet, which I like, but I think you could cut down a little on the sugar, especially if you like to eat yours with honey.  This is definitely the best cornbread I've ever made!

This is a very good and easy recipe.  I substituted almost all the oil for applesauce and found the texture perfect.  However, the applesauce does not replace the sugar, so be sure to add that.  I made muffins which baked perfectly in 15 minutes.  Thank you to the other reviewers for this advice.

I love this recipe!  It's easy to make and turns out moist and sweet every time.  My friends tell me it's the best cornbread they've ever tasted.  It's so easy, too--forget boxed mixes!  I can even bake it in my toaster oven and have it turn out well.  When I return to America, this recipe is coming with me.

It came out perfect! For years I have been using my mom's recipe, but I was always looking for just a bit more sweetness in the corn bread.  This recipe gave it just the sweetness I was looking for and a perfect golden crust! I used an 8x8 square glass baking dish at 400 for about 25min. Ymmm!

Very good!!  My recommendation is cook it in a oven safe, non-stick fry pan. First prepare recipe exactly as described then heat up frying pan (medium) on stove top and let two tablespoons of butter boil away water and begin to brown.  Cover edges of pan with butter and pour batter into hot pan.  Immediately, put pan in oven and bake as indicated, just cut about three minutes off time.  Bread will have a tasty, buttery, "caramelly" crust and is heaven.

This cornbread was excellent.  I baked it in a preheated cast iron skillet.  I used half yellow cornmeal and half blue cornmeal.  My husband said it was the best cornbread he had ever tasted.

I made this last night to go with chili and it was great.  I made muffins and cooked them at 400 for about 15 minutes in a dark, non-stick muffin pan.  The muffins were moist with just the right amount of sweetness.  Next time, I'd probably use just a little less baking powder, since I like it a tiny bit more dense.  I also added a little bit of extra oil based on other reviews.

UPDATE - Add additional egg if you don't like your cornbread really crumbly.  This was really good though I did have to use 1/2 oil and 1/2 melted bacon grease as I didn't have enough oil on hand.  I took the suggestion of others and only used 3 tsp. of baking powder.  My teenage daughter loved it.  I'll say this was sweet and moist enough to be served as dessert.

This was a wonderful tasting, sweet cornbread that my husband said he wouldn't change a thing about! The texture was moist, and yet still the classic "crumbly" cornbread that you would expect. I would bake it for 20 minutes so it's not too dry! Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe is PERFECT! It's not very often that I like a recipe just the way it is.  I usually have to tweak it a little, but this one is great just the way it is! I LOVE sweet cornbread and have been trying to find a recipe like you get at the restaurants. This is it! I will never use a boxed mix again!

PERFECT!  My husband only likes yellow, sweet cornbread as opposed to what i'm accustomed to, white, plain cornbread.  He loved it and so did my neighbor who doesn't like sweet cornbread.  Heck I even loved it.  The only change I made was to cut the baking powder to 3 tsps.

Very tasty and true to it's name.  It is sweeter than plain cornbread but not too sweet.  I will try it with white corn meal and splenda next time.

This is the best cornbread recipe I have every made. I did use muffin papers in a tin and I can't believe how moist this recipe turns out. We made them with ham and bean soup and it was a hit will the entire family. This recipe is also very fast. It's a keeper.

Awesome!!  I love cornbread, but every recipe I've ever tried has come out to dry.  This is moist, wonderful taste, and even cooks well in my hubby's cast iron frying pan.  Will make again and again!!

I tried this recipe before and it turned out great!  I thought I would try to tweak it this time by using suggestions from others.  I used whole grain flour, 1 t. salt, 2 T. baking powder, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup applesauce, 2 T. oil, 1/2 t. vanilla and soaked the cornmeal for 15 min.  WOW!  What a hearty bread!!!  Good taste but not as good as your recipe.  Next time I will stick to the recipe.

My family loves this cornbread, which is truly amazing in my house because my kids are picky eaters. I used White Lily self-rising flour and skipped the salt and baking powder. I also put in some frozen corn kernels packed from our  summer garden. Baked it in an iron skillet lightly coated with canola oil. Turned out great!

Easy to make.  We used harvested corn direct from the field and ground it into cornmeal.  Great with soup.

This was sooo good! I gave it 4 stars because I made some changes. I used bread flour instead of all purpose flour, instead of sugar I used 1/2 cup of honey, and 3 teas. of baking powder. I also put a little extra oil in as previous reviewers suggested. It came out so moist and tasty...everyone loved it!

I've been looking for the perfect cornbread recipe and finally found it!! Do you know how excited I am about this???  I followed the entire recipe except I added almost a full cup of sugar.  I made a dozen muffins and they were DELICIOUS!  Only one muffin survived the night and I got it!  It was still moist and yummy!

This recipe was super quick and very easy to make!  I used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, and it's absolutely delicious!  Sweet, but not overly sweet.  I'll definitely be making this again.

O this is my absolute FAVORITE! I tried other 5 star cornbread recipes from this site but I guess I like the sweet type... This reminded me of the Kenny Rogers Cornbread muffins but soooo much cheaper and waaaaay easy to make.  I also like that this recipe uses less oil than the other ones I've tried.  I tossed in 3 fresh chopped jalapenos and loved it... but next time, I'm upping the ante to 5 jalapenos per batch - I like my food with a 5 alarm fire rating...  My SIL also tried other recipes from this site but when she tried this one, she immediately asked me for it! Says everything!  Update: To increase our family's fibre intake, I used 1/2 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat and threw in a tablespoon of flaxseed meal... Came out smelling divine and was just perfect!

My spouse declares that this is excellent! It only took about 18 minutes to bake for me. I made it with white whole wheat flour, which I often do instead of all purpose flour to make recipes more filling. Also, it's sacrilege in my family to bake cornbread in a round pan so I used an 8x8 square.

Absolutely delicious. I soaked the milk and cornmeal for over an hour in the fridge before I mixed the other ingredients together. I also spread honey over the top of the bread immediately out of the oven. This is definitely a "sweet" cornbread, so if you don't like sweet then don't try this recipe.

Sweet and moist.  Perfect with spicy chili.  I've made it twice with great results.  The first time I followed the recipe as written and the second time I substituted the oil for unsweetened applesauce (as my husband's cholesterol is a little high). We really couldn't note any remarkable difference.  I'll be making this again and again.

I have used this cornbread recipes for years, definitely my favourite. It's so quick and easy to make. The only changes I make are adding a bit of honey for sweetness, and I reduce the baking temperture to 375F for 25 minutes - comes out perfect! Doesn't last long at my house.

Pretty darn good cornbread, however I did deviate from the recipe and used 1/2 c. sugar, 2 t. baking powder, plus a little extra canola oil.

This was pretty good, though not the best cornbread I've ever had.  I tend to think this would probably taste better if made with melted butter instead of oil.

Delish.  I upped the fat content in the mix by adding a few extra tablespoons of melted butter along with the veg oil.  My husband harassed me as to why I bought a cast iron skillet.  I used it tonight to bake the bread and now he's completely convinced I did the right thing!  Hahaha!  Thanks for sharing.

Yum!  My family loves this cornbread.  I use Splenda instead of sugar, and I do applesauce for half of the amount of oil.  It still turns out amazing!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.   It was delicious!  I would not change anything.  I liked that it was on the sweeter side, especially for breakfast

This was really good.  Next time I make it I will have to add less sugar because it is on the sweet side.  Better then boxed mixes.

This recipe is perfect if you decrease the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup, increase the number of eggs to 3 and increase the amount of salt. 
To make it REALLY good, add 1/4 cup crispy, chopped bacon and 1 finely sliced serrano chili.

FANTASTIC!!! I used half brown sugar half white, and used powdered milk so I could use my food storage.  So yummy and easy.  Stays together better than waikiki cornbread from this site.  My very picky 5 year old said it tasted like there was a bit of heaven in it.

SO good!  I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the oil, and that made it even better, in my opinion.  It was pretty gooey in the middle, but I'm not sure if that was because of the apple sauce or because or apartment oven is really bad...probably the oven.  Delicious!

I'm a last minute cook, and anything I can make in 30 minutes that tastes this good gets my highest rating.  It only takes me 5 minutes to prep, then into the iron skillet and into the oven, which leaves me 25 minutes to get everything else ready.  30 minutes and I serve a meal with steaming hot, delicious cornbread!  I love this recipe!

This Sweet Cornbread keeps moist inside and slightly crisp outside. Not too sweet
just sweet enough to give it a delicate flavor. I will use this recipe when I want the perfect cornbread.

Fabulous!! It was a huge hit with my husband, may have been the best he has ever had. I used a bit less sugar and added a bit more oil as per the advice, it worked out perfectly for our tastes. Served it with vegetarian chili...Mmmmmmm

I got 12 regular sized muffins out of this recipe.  Baked only for 15 minutes.  Cut back on the sugar by 1/4 of a cup.  My muffins did not raise and my bottoms were a little browner than I would have liked.  Had extra kids at our table for dinner so I didn't get a muffin!  Guess that means they were good and a 5 star recipe!

My favorite cornbread recipe!  I get asked to make this constantly :)  I'm not exact in my measurements when making this and it always turns out wonderful.  I also spread a thin layer of honey on top about half way through cooking.

Delicious! Brings back wonderful memories from childhood. I didn't have anymore white sugar so I used light brown and the bread came out nice a moist.
We had chili, corn bread and tiramisu...YUMMY! Will definitely be keeping this as my corn bread recipe of reference. Thank you!

Loved this recipe because these ingredients are pretty much staples in most homes.  I made these following changes (after reading other reviews) and came out with GREAT tasting corn bread!
I did add another egg (for a total of 2), added about a tsp of vanilla, and added   2 tbsp of butter (because I was afraid it  would be too crumbly as others had problems with).  The end result was a moist middle and crusted top and a slightly sweet bread.  My preference is that I'd rather have sweet then bland corn bread.  I cooked this in a round glass and needed to cook it a total of 45 minutes.  I had this with chili beans from this site and was a huge hit!  I will use this over and over.

I listened to other reviewers and reduced the sugar and added a little more oil.  I also cut back on maybe 1/8 cup of milk and added a can of drained corn.  I also baked them in a muffin pan.  They were delicious, but still just a touch too crumbly.

Awesome! I took the others advice...less sugar, vanilla, very little more oil.  I also used less a little cornmeal and they weren't as crumbly. This is a keeper.

This is a wonderful recipe for sweet cornbread. It definitely needs more liquid to hold it together. I used egg whites and, instead of just milk, used 1/2 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup full fat milk. Vanilla is a must with this recipe.

This recipe is almost there but not as good as the one I've been using lately. I compared the ingredients of the two and they are very similar. From the taste of it I think there is too much cornmeal, way too much fat, and a tad too much sugar. Mine crumbled too.

Due to kitchen limitations, I had to cut the recipe in half. I opted for 1 single-serve cup of applesauce and 3 tbsp of canola oil instead of the recipe's oil and egg.

With a few drops of vanilla extract added to make it fragrant, the cornbread was beautifully golden after 15 minutes.  The inside was soft and sweet, and the edges were crunchy from the pan.  I'd make this again.

this recipe was really good.  I did do some changes though.  I added two eggs and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used 2teaspoons of baking powder and also used 1/3 cup of butter instead of oil.  My husband really liked it.  We had it last night with chilli.

I love sweet cornbread but this was WAY too sweet for me.  The amount of sugar could easily be cut down to 1/2 cup possibly less. Also, it's extremely crumbly. This was more like eating a cupcake than actual cornbread.

Very good cornbread. The only change was to reduce sugar to a half cup. My son always asks for this recipe.

I tried this recipe exactly as written, and it made a good cornbread, but a touch bland. Next time, I used melted butter instead of oil, and the result was much improved.

I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and used demerara instead of granulated. I think with the full amount it would have been far too sweet. The texture was very crumbly but the flavor was good with butter or maple syrup.

This was really good, but it did not hold together at all. Whcih surprised me, considering I added cheese to it which should bind it even more. However, the flavor was GREAT. I added cheddar cheese and green chilies to it to make mexican corn bread. I cut the baking powder like everyone suggested also. I will try it again, only this time I will maybe use another egg. Good recipe.

The recipe was easy to follow and fool-proof for those nervous making cornbread for the first time.  I really slathered on the butter in the baking dish and added another layer after it came out the oven:)...My husband and Mom loved it as well which always puts a smile on my face!  Great for Thanksgiving and Sunday dinners:)

Wonderful recipe.
I built a potluck main-dish around this cornbread recipe.  Follow the recipe as directed.  Pour 1/2 the batter in the bottom of the baking dish.  Layer ground turkey, corn, grated cheese, olives, mild peppers, and sprinkle a bit (to your liking) of taco seasoning mix.  Top with the remaining batter.  And bake.  (You may want to add a few more minutes to the baking time.) People were wanting to know who made the dish.  Then, when I got back to my desk, there they were, e-mails asking for the recipe.

Really great recipe, but try this variation: Use very finely ground (stoneground) cornmeal or corn "flour" instead of usual cornmeal. Use one stick unsalted butter melted in 12 ounces of light cream, in place of oil and milk called for in recipe.  Decrease baking powder to one tablespoon.  Use two eggs, instead of one.  Mmm Mmm Mmm! Wow!

Good recipe!  I made some changes of my own to sweeten and moisten it even more...my substitutions:
1.  Increased to 3/4 cup of sugar
2.  1 cup of buttermilk (substitute for the milk)
3.  1 cup of cake flour (substitute for the all-purpose flour)
4.  1 cup of cream-style corn

Yummy!

This always turns out sweet and delicious! It is my standard cornbread recipe now. It is awesome when paired with turkey chili! A nice addition to this recipe is whole corn.  I took one ear of sweet corn and cut off the kernels and added it to the finished batter. I also cooked it up in a cast iron skillet. It was divine. All my friends love this cornbread when I make it.

Excellent cornbread! I used exactly what the recipe called for except a 1/8 cup extra oil and it turned out moist and light. I soaked the corn meal in the milk for 10 minutes and then mixed the batter with a hand mixer for 5 minutes to add some air to make it light and fluffy. It was just sweet enough, but not too sweet. I was a hit at the chili dinner. The guys wanted to take it all home, including the recipe.

I tried it with the recommended amount of sugar and the added vanilla and it was really sweet, almost like cake. Very good, but not what we had in mind for dinner. This time I left out the vanilla and reduced the sugar to 1/2C and it was just great. This is my youngest's absolute favorite thing!

Good recipe, but way too sweet.  I'll cut the sugar in half next time.  It crumbled apart a bit too, but I was removing the squares of cornbread right after I took it out of the oven, so it didn't have time to set.

I added 1 cup of frozen blueberries and baked it for about 10 minutes extra in a 9x9 glass pan.  Excellent both times I made it.  I haven't made it without the blueberries, yet.

This is 2nd time making this recipe. The first time around this recipe was a 2 stars(my fault).I used baking soda instead of powder and you really could taste the difference, so if you are planning on subsituting please save yourself some time.SECOND TIME GREAT!!!! I added a little more sugar and everything else was on point.

After all the rave reviews, I was expecting better. It tasted good and everything, but it wasn't amazing. As others suggested, I soaked the cornmeal in the milk for 10 minutes. Mine baked for about 22 minutes.

My boyfriend and I loved this! I soaked the cornmeal as suggested by other readers. I served it with honey butter, very tasty! I also loved how the sugar almost carmelized along the edges of the pan, it had the sweetest crunch. I will be making this again!

I've been using this recipe for quite some time, and every time it comes out perfect! I recently started making this in muffin pans and it's even better! 
This is a great base recipe as well, if you want to add minced onions, bell pepper, corn, etc. it still turns out great and makes it a little more interesting. There is never a piece left over and everyone is always asking for the recipe!

Absolutely loved this recipe.  Did cut the sugar to half a cup only because I knew I would probably eat half the cornbread, thought it would make me feel better knowing I took out some of the sugar, ha!!  I still ate half of it, so moist and delicious. Definitely my new cornbread recipe. Thanks

I made this recipe the first time and while it was very, very good, it was way to sweet for us.  This time I cut the sugar in half and it was perfect, again, for us.  I also added 1/2 cup of frozen niblet corn to the batter and added about an additional 8 minutes to the baking time to accommodate the temp of the frozen corn.  Excellent recipe tho!  It's a keeper.

This was very yummy cornbread, if you like it sweeter and fluffier.  The only problem we had one time was that we got busy and didn't get a chance to eat it all within a couple of days, and it soured on the counter, I guess because of the milk.  If you won't be eating it within a short time, put it in the fridge!

Simply WONDERFUL!  My family LOVES this recipe.  I am allergic to wheat, eggs, and milk, so I substitute a gluten-free flour for the wheat, Ener-G "Egg Replacer" for the egg, and Vance's milk substitute for the milk... and it is fabulous.  I substitute turbidino sugar for the white sugar to give more flavor, and don't cook this bread a second longer than 20 minutes.  I also found that corn-meal varies from brand to brand as to how course it is, so try different ones to see what you like.  I also tried making this with corn flour rather than corn-meal, and the end result is much fluffier and almost cake like.  I liked the smoother texture, I think I'll try half corn flour and half corn meal next time.  Also, not sure how well this freezes if you make it with wheat, but since I substitute gluten-free flour, it's fabulous microwaved after being saved in pieces in the freezer.  Yum yum yum.

D E L I C I O U S!  Sweet and fluffy like a piece of cake.  I soaked the cornmeal in milk to reduce the 'grainy' texture. This is a KEEPER!

I liked the recipe.  If you cool it down just right, then it won't be so crumbly.  I added only a half a cup of sugar so it wasn't as sweet, but it was good just the same.

This was really good. I made (small) muffins out of these. I halved the recipe and it made about 8 muffins - the bread doesn't rise as much as normal muffins/bread, so they were smaller muffins. I cooked them for a shorter period of time and they turned out great. I pour honey over them (and regular cornbread) for a special treat.

Just made this for dinner. Used some melted butter in addition to the oil and a little extra milk. Looks great, very fluffy for cornbread.

Excellent sweet cornbread, exactly what i was looking for.  Really good!
I did however, make the following changes, just because I had the stuff laying around and needed to use them.  I added two medium sized ripe bananas to the mix and once poured in the pan, I topped off the bread with about a cup of toasted coconut.  I baked it at 400 degrees but in a greased 10x15 baking sheet for 20-22 minutes.  It came out more "desserty" than regular cornbread, but it was fantastic nonetheless.

I had to make some changes owing to personal taste and what I have on hand: I used white cornmeal (I don't like yellow), 1/4 cup of sugar (growing up we never put sugar in our cornmeal), and I always substitue powdered milk for regular milk in recipes (it's cheaper!).  I threw in some cheddar cheese and it tasted great!

This was amazing.  The sugar amount was perfect for us and it was SOO light and fluffy.  This is THE recipe for me!!

This recipe is awesome. I too only used 1/2 c. sugar and followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great. It was a little sweet and very light and almost cakey, but in a good way. It was not heavy at all and it was full of flavor.

We tried several other recipes, but they just weren't what we were looking for.  This one was perfect! It turned out sweet and moist.  I like using 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of white sugar.

I typically do not like sweet cornbreads, but I decided to expiriment. This recipe was delightful; and the addition of 1/2 t vanilla gave the bread a nice overtone to it. This is a recipe I'll keep on hand.

Following other's suggestions I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, added a smigen more salt,  1/2 t imitation vanilla extract, and added perhaps 2 Tbls of oil.

The only change I would make to this recipe is to reduce the amount of sugar... maybe to 1/4 cup.  It was too sweet for our liking but it is called Golden "Sweet" Cornbread.  The cornbread came out perfectly though and had a great texture.  Great recipe!

I LOVED this!  It was the perfect cornbread consistancy.  I made several changes suggested by previous reviewers and it turned out to be the best cornbread we have ever had.  Here are my changes

1.  Soak cornbread in milk for 15 minutes
2.  add 1 egg
3.  add 2 tablespoons butter to batter
4.  decrease baking powder to 2 3/4 tsp
5.  add 2 tsp oil to pan and heat it up in oven before adding batter

100% yummy!

the cooking time for this is too short, i needed an extra 15 minutes. This is also really sweet, it made my teeth feel like they were coated in sugar! I won't make this again.

This is the only cornbread I use, and I have used it many times since I found the recipe... what, three years ago? For me, it comes out perfectly: crumbly without falling apart too easily, just moist enough. I usually only use 1/2 cup sugar. Makes great muffins, too!

This was very simple to make, and my picky hubby liked it, I on the other hand liked the flavor, but thought it came out a little dry. I will definetly make it again, but I will try soaking the cornmeal as other reviewers suggested, and see if that helps.

So yummy we couldn't stop eating it the first time I made it!!  I do use half Splenda and half sugar.  My husband eats cornbread every night and this recipe is almost as easy as any boxed.

The only negative about this bread is that it falls apart very easily.  I may increase to 2 eggs and or/a little more vegetable oil.  I also put in 3/4 of c. of sugar instead of 2/3 c. in error but it tasted great and will leave use 3/4 c. next time too.  A+ for flavor.

Great cornbread! Made this into 12 muffins. I only had self-rising flour, so I omitted the baking powder.

Is it possible to make a meal completely out of cornbread?  These were sooooo good.  I baked mine in a scone pan, but a muffin pan could be substituted.  The crust was wonderfully crisp and the inside soft and crumbly.  It was just sweet enough too.  Fabulous!

Loved this cornbread!  Even my husband liked it, and he does not like foods sweet.  Very good to munch on the next day, spread with margarine.

This cornbread was awesome. My family told me to replace my old recipe with this one. I used a 9" square pan instead of round and it made 9 good sized squares. We didn't have any left overs, so next time I will double it.

This is a great recipe. I end up making it in a 8" round pan and only fill it up 2/3 of the way and baking it the same as recipe states. It turns out golden on the top and very moist. One of my favorites!

Yummy!  I took the advice of others and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also added vanilla and cinamon.  In place of the oil I used melted butter.  It's very important to soak the cornmeal with the milk...  do this and your bread will turn out perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It "a little" crumbly but the flavor was great.  We will definitely have this again.  I would say it was one of my favorite cornbread recipes.

What an excellent recipe! Took me 5 minutes to prepare and took my family about the same amount of time to devour! :)

I cut down the amount of sugar, though. I only put in 1/2 a cup and it was plenty sweet, so I'd advise doing that if you don't like very sweet breads.

This is definitely a keeper for my family!

I think the cornbread is too crumbly.  I would have liked it more gooey.  I reduce the sugar a bit and the sweetness is just right.

This recipe was 6 stars! Because I'm Dutch I never heard of cornbread. But now that I tried it it was great, the family loved it too. I made 3 servings with a little bit of cinnamon and that was enough for 4 muffins. Baked them in the oven for 20 minutes, they were gone in 2 minutes. Thank you so much Lori for this recipe, will make this again!

Excellent recipe!  I was looking for a sweet, moist cornbread and this certainly fit the bill.  I followed another cook's advice and soaked the cornmeal in the milk for about 15 min before mixing in the other ingredients.  I can't say enough good things about the recipe!

I made this exactly as written and was a little disappointed. Not that it tasted bad... it just didn't taste like grandma use to make... I'm still looking for a recipe that taste like hers.  I did purchase a cast iron skillet 'cause I know that's what she used. Next time I'll use the cast iron skillet and see if that makes a difference. The corn bread was good but it just wasn't what I expected.

I looked at the reviews and added 1/2 cup sugar as people recommended. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as it is. It came out bitter and dry.

Best cornbread ever. I liike to switch back and forth, using more cornmeal and less flour depending on who I am cooking for, but it always turns out absolutly divine.

This was a really great recipe. I have never been a fan of cornbread, but we had family over for Riblets and mashed potatoes last night, and I thought that cornbread fit the bill. I did everything that the recipe instructed, except I added 1 cup of frozen corn (thawed and drained) to the batter, and it was wonderful!! I will be making this often- I think that I LOVE cornbread now!

Great  cornbread. I recommend
cuting the sugar down to 1/2 cup,unless you like cornbread that tastes like yellow cake.

Very moist cornbread with a great texture. Sweet, but not too sweet. We had this with a big batch of white turkey chili.

This was great corn bread and very easy to make!  Instead of oil, I added the same amount of applesauce and reduced to 1/2 cup of sugar just to make it a little healthier and it came out great!  Will never buy Jiffy again!

Delicious.  I made it for a potluck, and everyone loved it.  The bread is a bit more crumbly than most, but that is the extent of its faults.  I used a 9x9 square glass dish, and it was still declicious.  When I return home (I'm in college) I'm going to challenge my Mom's cornbread with this recipe.  : D  Thanks!

This recipe was fantastic!!!  It was a golden color and came out nice and high in a 9 inch square pan...I used butter instead of oil. I made this again this morning with oil and thought it was a little dry....I will only use butter from now on.....thanks

I modified the recipe quite a bit according to comments previously left. 1/2 tsp salt. 2 tsp baking powder. I substituted half the flour for whole wheat flour. I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup and it was still sweet. We tried it the first time with 1/2 cup sugar it was way too sweet! My fiance and his family loved it...we ate it with chili. Thanks!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I cut the calories by using Splenda for the full amount (added a little more, I like sweet cornbread) of sugar.  I also cut the oil in half and used the other half of applesauce.  I substituted eggbeaters for the egg.  I thought the bread had a nice texture and was good.  I would make again.  Baked it in a square pan.

My wife, who is unfortunately a big fan of boxed cornbread, called this the best cornbread ever.  I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and used applesauce instead of vegetable oil.  Nice recipe.

This recipe is great.  Best tasting cornbread I have ever had.  The only thing I did was use self-rising flour instead of all-purpose and left out the baking powder and salt.

This was excellent!  I didn't have enough milk (probably 1/8 c. short) so I added a heaping tablespoon of plain yogurt, and it was divine!  Moist and delicious... it didn't even need any butter or honey, which are usually a must for me.  My husband said it was the best he'd ever had.

I added some thawed frozen corn and it was even better.
Then, on a whim, I topped my slice with homemade dulce de leche, ooh, heavens!.

I really enjoyed this recipe! Thank you! I wanted muffins, so I adapted it - just lightly grease muffin tins, fill two-thirds full, and bake @ same temp for 15 minutes. Easy! I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone (picky relatives included ;-D) enjoyed it. Score!!!

Amazing! First time I made any kind of bread from scratch.  I cant believe how easy this was!!!  I did decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup, the salt to 1/2 tsp, the baking powder to 2 1/2 tsp, and increased the oil just a tad after reading the other reviews.  One big pointer: I made the first batch exactly as stated (with the above modifications) and it was PERFECT. But the second batch, I was making for thanksgiving party of 30, two lasagna size trays, so I multiplied by 5 (60 servings).  The outside cooked faster than the center, so I had to decrease the heat to 300/325 and cook for a little over an hour.  So, just mind that you need to decrease cooking temp and increase time if you increase the servings to avoid having burned-on-the-outside/raw-in-the-center bread.  The toothpick test works really well.  My co-workers would have liked it sweeter, but for me the decreased sugar was perfect. Thanks for the easy recipe!!!

This recipe went together in a snap, and 25 minutes after starting, we had a pan of fresh cornbread.  It was great!  I think it would have been even better if my cornmeal had been fresher, my box was about 2 years old!  Can't wait to make again (with fresh cornmeal).  Put some honey on it, and served with homemade navy bean soup.  Excellent supper for cool fall day.

This is now my official cornbread recipe!    Here's how I tweaked the recipe (thanks to other reviewers):  used 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1/2 c all-purpose flour, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 t salt, 2 t baking powder, and substituted buttermilk.  Baked for 15 minutes in muffin pan.

My family loves this recipe especially with chili.  Second time I made this, I substituted the white sugar for brown and substituted 1/2 of the white flour for whole wheat.  This will be a staple in our household.

I have tried many cornbread recipes looking for the sweet flavor that I have loved so much in southern cooking.  This cornbread was delicious, a perfect balance between the flavors of the cornmeal and the sugar.  I personally like a denser cornbread so I would suggest using only 2 tbsp of baking powder (cuts down on the salty flavor, which is a good thing to me, but if you like it salty you would want to compensate with more salt).  All in all, a delicious cornbread, a recipe that I will use from now on!

I substituted oatmeal for cornmeal, added an egg io the recipe and used water instead of milk and cut out all that unhealthy white sugar.  It was awful.  The original recipe was great

Very good cornbread, even with my substitutions! I used egg substitute, and 1/4 cup applesauce with only a tablespoon of oil, and it still turned out nice and moist! It does get stiff later, though, so eat it right away.

Absolutely the most incredibly delicious cornbread I've ever made!  I followed suggestions and reduced baking powder to 2 tsp and sugar to 1/2 cup - but I also stir in 1/2 a can of cream style corn before pouring the batter into the baking pan.  Tastes likes it's been slathered in butter, but no butter in it!

This is such an easy delicious recipe!  Great with butter and honey.  Instead of milk I used equal amount  of buttermilk and the recipe turned out great.  Made this for an informal dinner with friends and got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe.  Can't wait to make it again.

This was perfect! I also made it as a loaf, and served it in slices drizzled with boysenberry syrup. Moist with a nice crispy top.

Followed the recipe to T, except I baked it in a 9x5 loaf pan for about 30 minutes. Came out absolutely perfect... for a cake. I'll never bake it as a bread, or a cornbread, but it's gonna be a regular basis at home as a cornmeal cake.

I made corn muffins with this recipe! It was terrific! I used skim milk, the two eggs that others suggested and olive oil. They did not crumble, and were really yummy! I did put less sugar in it (about 1/2 cup) and thought they were plenty sweet with just that! My whole family gives it 7 thumbs up :)

This is the best cornbread ever.  My husband ate half the pan and my picky 12-year-old had 2 pieces.  In fact, as I'm typing this, my son gave me a hug and said "Thanks for dinner, Mom. I loved the cornbread!"  It doesn't get any better than this!  Thanks, Lori.

This has to be the best cornbread I've ever tasted, homemade or store bought.  I actually make muffins out of them and they are sweet and moist.  Most of the recipes that I have tried are either too dry or too bland.  This recipe however is both sweet and moist.  I do reduce the amount of baking powder to two teaspoons as recommneded by some reviewers.  I also add a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract for a slight vanilla taste as well adding some homemade vanilla sugar sprinkled on top of the batter prior to putting the pan into the oven.  A GREAT recipe!

A good basic cornbread recipe that I'll make again with a few revisions.  I used about 1 tablespoon less flour (very lightly spoon flour into measuring cup) as it came out dry the first time, and I used about 2 tablespoons less sugar, for personal taste.

I can not over emphasis how great this recipe is -not only is it delicious, it is so easy to make that I literally get it done in no time.  I chose this recipe as my "starter" recipe as I was new to the world of baking.  Now, a year later and having successfully baked several other recipies, my hubby and kids ask for this one time and time again.  I have altered the recipe a little - by adding less sugar and using 2 eggs instead of one.  An excellent recipe!!

YUMMY! The name is right, this is sweet! With other (bland) cornbread, I've always made honey-butter to enjoy it, but this is perfect just as it is. No need to make honey-butter, and no sticky hands while eating it. It was almost too sweet to accompany a savory chili, but it is still my new default cornbread recipe. Thanks!

I have been searching for a long time for the perfect cornbread recipe, and for me, this is it.  I made it on Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  I reduced the sugar to half a cup and the baking powder to two and a half teaspoons.  It rose perfectly and was delicious.  And it took only two minutes to make!

This cornbread is the best - moist but not greasy, sweet but not too sweet. I sort of compromised between this recipe and the similar recipe on my canister of cornmeal. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and cut the baking powder to 2 teaspoons. Also used a 8x8 pan, easier to cut in pieces. The second time I made it I found out (by accident) that you get a really great rich texture if you undercook it, let it cool a little, and then finish baking it. This also worked really well on my undercooked banana bread - every time I had some I stuck individual pieces in the toaster oven for a few minutes.

This is a great cornbread.  However, it had a slight baking powder after-taste.  I changed the 3 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder to 3 teaspoons and the after-taste is gone.  I eat this cornbread all the time.  Everyone loves it!  Thanks for sharing.  :-D

This cornbread was fabulous!  I made it for my husband last night to go with a pot of chili, and we both absolutely loved it.  It was easy, the proportions and baking instructions were just right, and it came out golden brown and delicious.  I did wait 15 minutes before cutting -- this would be a good addition to the recipe.

This is a great cornbread recipe - very easy and delicious!  It was moist but a little crumbly, but what cornbread isn't?  I like that it could be made in a cake pan since I don't have a cast iron skillet that most cornbread recipes call for.

I doubled this and used a 9.5x13.5 pan, put in 300degree oven for a little over an hour (I was in charge of cornbread for a Superbowl party and made the Absolute Mexican Cornbread also) and it turned out very nice.  Tastes like the cornbread my mom made me.  It was a bit crumbly, but that may have been due to the change in the baking time/temp.  We liked it though, definitely will be making again.

Yum!  This cornbread is extremely good!  There are plenty of cornbread recipes out there, but this one has the perfect blend of corn and sweetness.

SUPER recipe! So glad I tried it. It's now in my permanent recipe file. Do cut the baking powder to 2 tsp. as recommended by other testers. Quick, easy, and clearly the best cornbread recipe I've ever tried. Everyone raved!Mine came out looking thicker and more golden than in the pic.

I decreased the baking powder to 2 tsps after reading previous reviews, but don't forget to decrease the salt also, I added the 4 tsps and found it very salty, so I decreased salt to 2tsps and the recipe was perfect!

This is the easiest cornbread recipe I have used. If you like sweet cornbread this is the one for you! I used the posted advise of 2 tsp. baking powder,which was just right. I prefer muffins,so I baked them at 400 for 20 minutes. I did not have to adjust for high altitude.  A+

This cornbread was very good.  I always use the Jiffy box mixes because they are really sweet.  This was not as sweet as theirs, but real close.  It was very easy and quick to make.  I will make this again and again!

This cornbread was very moist and had just the right amount of sweetness. It also had more cornmeal in it than other recipes I've tried, which I actually liked. However, like the reviewer below, I thought it had an unpleasant bitterness to it because of the large amount of baking powder. If not for that, it would have been perfect.

I liked this cornbread alot, the consistancy was very nice and moist, but I could taste a slight bitterness from the large amount of baking powder.

There are two types of people in this world - those who love cornbread and those who don't. This recipe is for those who love cornbread. It's sweet and has just the right texture - it's delicious. If you live with people who don't love cornbread, you can eat it all!

In a pinch, it's almost as quick as Jiffy and just as good; however, I did use less white sugar (1/2 cup) and I added 2 chopped Jalapeño peppers for TexMex zest...

I've made this twice since finding the recipe.  As easy to make as it is delicious, this bread is wholesome, delicious, and (according to my wife) a wonderful smell to walk into the house after work.

This is one of the best cornbread recipes ever. We both love it and plan to make it often! A drizzle of honey and sea salt finish it perfectly. Omg, seriously, please try this. I could eat the whole thing myself.

I made it but made one change.  I used cornflour instead of cornmeal.  I had to bake it longer though, not sure if that was because of the change I made of if the recipe itself needs tweaking.  But I cooked it 25 minutes, it was not done.  Gave it 5 more minutes, tried to cut it, it was doughy still in the center.  I put it back in for 10 more minutes.   Then it was perfect, and not a bit too dry.  Nice and moist and sweet and very good recipe.  I making a note of my changes in my own recipe book.

This is my favorite corn bread recipe. It is so easy! My son is dairy free so I sub unsweetened plain soy milk and it still comes out great. I soak the corn meal as a previous reviewer suggested as well as doing half white sugar and half brown. Sometimes I throw in a can of creamed corn! It is great with or without.

Delicious and as others have mentioned, very sweet...  Followed the recipe and it is just too crumbly...  Have made a couple times wtih same results....   
Delicious, but literally just falls apart into a pile of crumbs so need a fork or spoon to hoover up all the little bits

Wonderful Corn Bread! I posted my photo of them, as well.
 I doubled the recipe, and put a total of 5 TBSP of Baking Powder, per other reviews- I also added a 1/2 tsp of baking soda, some vanilla and a dollop of sour cream for some extra moisture.  
I think next time I will do less flour, and more corn meal, for me it was a little too cake-like.  I prefer a grittier, more traditional tasting, corn bread.  It was still delicious with Great Northern Bean soup recipe from this site.  5 stars from me.
    I hate reviews that make alterations but mine were based off of other reviews—except for the vanilla, which I add to pretty much everything that isn’t a savory dish

This has been my go to cornbread recipe for over a decade. It may be too sugary for some people. I cut the sugar back to half a cup. Leave the batter to rest in the pan  for 10 minutes prior to baking. It allows the cornmeal to absorb the liquids and lets the gluten rest.

I doubled the recipe .Used 3 eggs, 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 7 tsps of baking powder. It made 1 cake pan and 12 corn muffins. They were very good ,nice  and moist  not crumbly.I also used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil. I use applesauce in all my cake and cookie recipes ,taste great and keeps them moist.Best I have ever tasted !

This is my favorite cornbread recipe! I only do 1/3 cup sugar because we primarily have cornbread with chili and I don't want it overly sweet, but that is a personal preference. I also add finely diced fresh jalapeno to the batter.

I made zero changes and made it exactly how the recipe called.  It was PERFECT and my family loved it. The bake was closer to 35 minutes than 25, but that could be because my oven runs cool.

The whole family loves this recipe the way it is. I have also tried it as 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, which gives it a home richness to it. This is the only cornbread recipe that I use. 
I never understood how people can rate this based off changes they have made. 
Thank you for sharing and being a part of our family recipes we use. :)

It's good. Easy to make. Only deviation is I used honey not sugar. It was plenty sweet enough with a half cup. every thing else made as per instructions. gave it 4 stars only because 3/4 would have hurt my teeth it would have been that s

This recipe is so delicious, my only regret is not finding it sooner! My man dime(guy that I'm dating/10 across the board lol) is obsessed with cornbread and lucky me, I'm obsessed with baking AND cornbread! I made these last night and I'll be having to make some more in the morning because the rest won't last tonight! I followed the recipe as is(ingredients wise) but made a few changes! :

I made them as muffins, I was able to get an even 12! I used 2 TBSP per muffin and baked @ 400°F for 18 mins. I left 6 plain and added blackberries to the other 6. I used 2 blackberries in the middle and one on top. Lastly I lightly dusted all 12 muffins with cinnamon right before I baked them! they came out perfect I was in such shock! next time I want to try it with buttermilk. I loved the blackberry addition so I'll do that again but add some vanilla beans yuuuuuuum!

I'm no cornbread expert. I didn't grow up with it. Famous Dave's muffins are my favorites, to give you an idea of what my tastebuds prefer. That being said, I loved this. I did use butter rather than oil (as I will again), and left out about a T of sugar (but not next time!) It was moist for cornbread, but with some crumbling as it should. I let the cornmeal soak as others said. My 9 inch round pan was ready at 20 minutes. I wish I had lined the pan with parchment paper and cut back a little on the baking powder, but it was still delicious!

The flavor for this was amazing, but it was really dry and crumbly as other reviews state (even the 5 star ones). It's still usable if you like it in your chili or soup, but if you want to eat cornbread that will stay intact, this is not the recipe.

Flavorful! I used melted butter instead of oil, but otherwise followed the recipe. It took longer cooking time for the center to be solid. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I've made this cornbread alongside a hearty vegetable beef stew on many occasions for myself and my family and it is absolutely to die for! However I do add a bit more cornmeal and sugar to make it a little bit more savory and sweet! Thanks Allrecipes for all the great recipes!

I just made this because I didn’t have any jiffy mix on hand. I had all the ingredients already on hand which was great. After making this simple and delicious recipe I won’t be using jiffy again!  Excuse the slice missing, my grandson & I just couldn’t wait to try it out!

Made it for New Years but I also wanted to use my cast iron skillet I got for Christmas from my granny. I didn’t hear the timer go off on the stove because I was sitting here in the living room with the tv on so it cooked a little bit longer than I had planned.

I wanted to make homemade cornbread for New Year's because it is said to bring good luck! This recipe looked good and I tried it this morning. Wow! Exactly what I was hoping for and so easy! The cornmeal I used was P.A.N. brand and it really gave it a "corny" flavor. Thank you bluegirl for sharing such a great recipe!

AMAZING! I cut the recipe in half and it made six muffins that took about 20 minutes to bake. Used Bob's Red Mill cornmeal and Bob's Red Mill vegan egg replacer. I still used the equivalent of one egg along with oat milk and a little extra oil based on the other reviews. I also added a little extra baking powder and a splash of vanilla since I wanted them more cake-like. These were amazing! I didn't even need honey because they were really sweet.

I made it according to the recipe except used half oil and half unsalted butter for the shortening. Also made muffins, and they were great!

This is a good base recipe but for the most moist and sweet cornbread I use the following adaptations:  I put a half a stick of butter in a cast iron skillet and let it preheat in the oven while the oven heats up.  Work quick so your butter doesn’t burn.  I leave about an eighth of a cup of the milk out and add vinegar to the one cup line (or use a cup of buttermilk instead if you have it) I let that sit while I whisk the dry  ingredients together.  I left a half a teaspoon of the baking powder out and added a half teaspoon of baking soda in its place to get a better reaction with the vinegar.  I also blend a can of cream style corn until  smooth and add all the wet ingredients to the dry ones, put the hot skillet out add the mixture and bake as directed.  Perfect!

Standard cornbread, but not very sweet and came out pretty dry and crumbly.

Easy and great taste. I usually don’t like cornbread,  but this one really changed my mind. Not too dry or crumbly.  A little fresh Amish butter and it was wonderful.

I used this recipe to bake cornbread muffins to bring to work Thanksgiving potluck and it was a hit! I cut the baking time to 15 mins and added 2 tbsp of vegetable oil for extra moist and a tsp of vanilla extract.

It was perfect!! My dad loves cornbread, so I decided to try this for Thanksgiving. I did 1.5x the ingredients, because I only had a 9x12 size baking dish. Not even 24 hours later,  every bread crumb is gone!! SO delicious, just the way it is.

This is my family's favorite! I always have to make at least 2 pans! The only thing I do differently is cut the flour and baking soda in half and that made it so that it doesn't crumble as much. Definitely a keeper

I LOVE this recipe. I followed one person's comment and decided to make it exactly like the recipe before making changes . The only thing I changed was the amount of oil since most people agreed it needed a little more because it was too crumbling. I doubled the recipe but instead of 2/3 cup of oil I used just under a full cup. In my opinion it is perfect. I'm glad I doubled it because we finished most of it. But since I doubled it the outside cooked faster than the center so I covered with aluminum foil and continued baking it so it wouldn't get too dark. I'm making my second (double) one now. I don't know if I'll ever go back to jiffy Oh yeah it's also delicious in a cornbread stuffing.

This is my go to cornbread recipe. My sons and husband love it. Before initially making it I surveyed several reviews and ultimately incorporated three simple substitutions for awesome cornbread. I use buttermilk instead of regular milk, melted butter rather than oil, and I substitute brown sugar for white sugar.

Finally, a cornbread recipe we like. Moist, holds together well, and has a great flavor. I greased  with butter, sprinkled a little corn meal on bottom of the pan, 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar. Followed directions, didn’t overmix and sprinkled a little sugar and honey on top. Next time I’ll try with jalapeño but this will be my recipe for cornbread.

This recipe was pretty good. Next time, I will plan to add a little more sugar. I always add honey to my cornbread as well, but It wasn’t as sweet as we are use to. We bake our cornbread in a skillet. Definitely will be trying this for thanksgiving!

This is a great recipe came out moist. The only suggestion I have is to cut down on the sugar I thought it was too sweet especially if you will put honey on it. But I found the perfect recipe , I will be making this again
so next time I may just do 1/3 cup  sugar and maybe add some corn to it. It actually reminds me of Boston market corn bread.

Wonderful cornbread. Never going back to jiffy. Made it in my cast iron skillet.

This was ok. I found it to be a little bland & actually not as sweet as I prefer. I made it exactly as written, no changes. 
It was a very light golden color when done. Minimally crumbly, nice texture otherwise.

I have been making this recipe for several years, and figured I ought to write a review as it is a household staple.  My husband LOVES this, and won't eat anyone else's cornbread.  I make precisely as written except I usually preheat my cast iron skillet and bake it in that.  Last year we went to a friend's for a long weekend, and had cornbread one night.  My husband requested that I make this, as she doesn't do sweet, but she insisted her husband and kids would want hers ... That didn't go well!   Rave reviews always - and making a triple batch with the chili for Halloween tonight.

Last night a attempted to make cornbread. I followed the recipe on the back of the cornmeal box. Needless to say I threw it away and I try not to discard any food. This morning I followed this recipe and even before it went in the oven I felt this version was going to be better. After tasting this recipe, I am in love. What a tasty cornbread. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very good recipe. The only thing I changed was that I soaked the milk and cornmeal while I prepared the rest of the ingredients and that I used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown.  The reason I only gave 4 stars is that I find it somewhat dry. I will make again.

I made this tonight to go with a chili I made and it was absolutely wonderful and a huge hit!  I love to cook but I HATE to bake.  This cornbread was right up my alley as it was so quick and easy.  I think it took me less than 5 minutes to whip up.  I honestly wouldn’t change a thing!  I read some comments about it falling apart easily but we really didn’t have a problem as we were eating it with chili so it would’ve been fine.  But I thought it held together quite well.  Will definitely be making this again!

I found this recipe because he asked for corn bread and I made it for him when he was 10. Now he’s 19 and he still is his favorite recipe. You can’t go wrong with this one. We love it.

Followed the directions as written. This was the BEST corn bread I have ever made. This will be a staple in our house. 
I made them as muffins and cooked slightly less than what it called for.

I took a great suggestion from another, and mixed the cornmeal and milk together before hand.  I think it made the finished product very moist. While it was baking ,I melted honey and butter together then added fresh snipped rosemary to the mixture. Then I poured it over the baked cornbread while it was still warm. A nice sweet-savory taste....

I enjoyed this recipe a lot,  I looked through some other reviews and I soaked my cornmeal in the milk for about 20 minutes and did not have a problem with it being too crumbly. 
-used 1/3c white sugar and 1/3c brown sugar 
-used buttermilk instead (only because my milk had expired a week early apparently )  
- baked in a sprayed 9x13 pan for about 15 minutes and it was a perfect golden brown and tasted great!

My family loved this recipe. I personally am not a huge bread eater and I like my cornbread sweet and buttery. I kept everything the same, except I changed the oil for butter and used a square pan. What I received was a heavenly product. My family of 5 ate the entire pan.

Loved it! Super fluffy! I have to be gluten free, so I subbed AP Gluten Free Flour (rice blend based) for the AP flour. I added half a TSP of xanthan gum as a binder. I didn’t have eggs, so I used 3 TBSP of mayo. Also used buttermilk instead of regular milk (again, that’s what I had on hand...). Wow!!! Just WOW! The rest of my family doesn’t have to be gluten free and none of us has to be egg free, but this was amazing!! Some people will read this and say that I changed the recipe completely. Haha! You have to have a good place to start, Guys, and this was it! A keeper!!

This was a hit with the family.  I made two changes.  I used extra virgin olive oil and I made them into muffins.  These were so easy to put together and the olive oil was not detected by anyone.  Definitely making again.

So easy and very good.  My husband of 34  years loves cornbread and I've only tried to make it from a box.  When I made this yesterday he said it taste just like his moms--huge compliment.  I'm making it again tonight.  I made no adjustments to this recipe.

I used this recipe to make cornbread in my Nuwave oven because my oven is out. The only modifications I made were to cook for 15 minutes vs 20-25 in an ungreased pan (the one that came with my Nuwave). It turned out delicious, just a hair moist on the bottom, but not wet or soggy. You can probably add 2 more minutes to fix this.

followed recipe almost exactly, and then added a small can of sweet creamed corn into the batter.I didn't have "cornmeal" so I used dried polenta, and it was great.  Came out incredibly moist! This will be my go-to easy corn bread recipe.

Everyone loved it! I used 1/3 cup honey and 1/3 cup white sugar and followed the suggestion to soak the cornmeal in the milk. It has a nice crunchy top and sweet, soft inside.

Pretty good I have stuck to jiffy mix for a lot of years because I like sweet corn bread. This was way better. With all corn bread to keep it moist I add cream corn. I cut the milk in half and mix the other half with cream corn. I also like to add  jalapeño peppers  I don’t like it to spicy so I remove the seeds. Very delish corn bread

This was great! Everyone raved how delicious this was. I doubled the recipe and made one round pan and as well as muffins. I only had two paper liners, so sprayed the remaining muffin tins well and put batter in. They developed a great golden crust that we all preferred. I will never use paper liners again.
I’m going to try some of the recommendations that other reviews suggest. Love it!!

Good recipe. Based on other reviews, I made a couple changes. I like sweet corn bread, so I didn't adjust sugar. I had fresh baking powder,  so decreased recipe to 2 tsp. I also increase oil by 2 tbsp. Baked in square Pyrex. So good. Family loved. Would make great corn muffins also. Easy. Will be my new go to recipe.

I’ve used this recipe before and along with 2 others, it’s one of my favorite cornbread recipes.  I made bbq ribs and you just can’t eat ribs without cornbread as one of your sides; plus I wanted to finally test out my Copper Chef muffin tin. Okay, I pretty much followed the recipe as is, except for these changes: I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 2/3, 3/4 tsp salt instead of 1, 2.5 tsp of baking powder instead of 3.5, and 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1/3 (following another reviewer’s suggestion that a little more oil make it less crumbly). And since I was using a muffin tin instead of baking pan, I baked at 375° instead of 400.  I got 11 muffins out of this recipe. They came out just right and was nice and moist and not too crumbly. Yum right out of the oven with some butter.  FYI, I did not spray one of the cups to test out if it was really nonstick and it is. I could not

This recipe is okay. I made it exactly as the instructions stated and baked it for 22 minutes and 40 seconds, and it turned out really crumbly and had a dry texture. Also, my preference, it wasn't as sweet as I like my cornbread to be.

I baked mine 20 mins and it was all cooked through but its a little dry and as i cut it the center wants to break in half. I have made better from scratch that was super moist and crispy edges but thats a family recipe i know from heart. I also added very little corn in my mix that was left over from dinner.. Not even a half a cup, whatever i had left.

Just what we like!  Didn't change anything, and my family devours it hot from the oven with lots of butter.  If you're feeling fancy, you can throw in some leftover sweet corn or a can of green chiles, but it's perfect as is.  Great with chili or other soup.

After reading several reviews,  I decided to make this exactly as written, except I did increase the oil by about 2 teaspoons.  It was perfect. Sweet, but not too sweet. It rose the perfect amount.  It stayed fairly solid and moist. My husband is Not a cornbread fan, and he ate 2 pieces. 
Another thing I like is that it uses regular milk instead of buttermilk.  I didn't have to buy anything special to make it.

I love this recipe. I did change it a little by using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and adding some honey to the batter. I don't really mesure the amount of honey I put in but I'd say about 1/4 cup, when I make this I normally double the recipe since my friends and family LOVE when I make this. Touch of honey makes it lightly sweet and sticky.

This recipe was very easy but too salty on its own. I’d recommend cutting down the salt to probably a half tsp if you are hoping to eat by itself. It was also dry. I didn’t like it solo but I had it with some sausage & peppers I had made the night before, and it was okay mixed in.

Big raves for this one.  I tweaked it to be gluten and dairy free.  Here were my modifications.

* Used GF flour
* Added 1 cup of roasted corn to a 12 serving recipe
* Used a coarser version of cornmeal
* Divided the sugar half white/half brown
* Used almond milk, added 2 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar and let stand for 10 mins.  This is the vegan version of buttermilk.  The milk will separate and look like it's curdling. Just stir it before you put it in.

This corn bread is a keeper.  We all loved it. I might try it sometime with butter, not oil, but it was very moist and delicious. It comes together quickly and bakes in around 20 minutes. I didn't find it bitter like a lot of other corn muffin and bread recipes.

After making corn muffins from a box brand (around since 1930!) and having them look like small white hockey pucks (along with the same texture), I decided to try a real recipe. I did not have enough cornmeal, so used a little polenta (next time I'll use all cornmeal). Baked it in a cast iron pan. Very easy and very tasty. And so much more appetizing. Will be my go-to recipe from now on!

Very easy to make. I took one person's suggestion to let the cornmeal soak in the milk. I also did 1/3 white sugar and 1/3 brown sugar.  Cooked in the suggested time. Very pleased. Will be my go to cornbread recipe.

This cornbread really tastes good.  I didn't make any changes.  I would have liked for it to be a little less dry but it is better than other recipes I have made.  Someone commented on this being messy.  That is not true at all.  It's a bread and there are crumbs.  I would definitely make it again.

Halved the recipe and baked in a smaller 7" tin. (Half of a large beaten egg is 1/8 of a cup) Came out so good, didn't even need butter. Going to try variations such as using half brown sugar. It is crumbly for sure, but let it sit for a bit and it'll firm up a little. I was able to remove the leftover half in one piece for storing.

I liked this cornbread recipe, but it called for 1 cup of cornmeal,  it was gritty and crumbly, I put 1/2 cup of cornmeal in it instead, it was much better

I made this exactly as written and it is one of the best cornbread recipes I've tried!  Rather sweet...which is what I like.  Would recommend this for accompanying a bowl of chili or pinto beans!

OMG this recipe is amazing. I'm a Southern girl that likes Jiffy.... not anymore, this was just as quick as making box cornbread but better sooooooooooooooo much better.  Sweet Jesus. 

I cook and have never made cornbread from scratch... can't wait to have some fresh collard greens with this recipe.

As written, it’s 3 stars IMO. I made it twice and the first time it was crumbly, super sweet, and tasted like baking powder. The second time, I decreased the sugar by half, increased the oil but forgot to decrease the baking powder. It was better the second time, but I still prefer the boxed cornbread mix to this.

Made corn muffins instead of bread. Cut bake time to 15 min. YUM! The only other difference was all i had was white corn meal. They were delicious!

Reduce  sugar to maybe a round 1/2-cup or less using 1/3 c white and 1/3 c brown sugar.  Let the cornmeal soak in the milk for 10-15 minutes before mixing with the other ingredients.  Replace veg oil with melted butter.  Add just a smidgen more salt and a 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Also add just a little bit more oil so it's not quite so crumbly. OR, bake muffins (only 15 mins).                                                                                                           MUFFINS: Pour the batter into muffin pan lined with cupcake papers almost to the very top of the liners.  Bake at 375 degrees (with a convection oven the heat is usually 25 degrees less than the normal temp, otherwise bake at the suggested heat of 400 degrees).  Cook to perfection with nicely browned tops @ 400 degrees for 20-23 mins using a toothpick to test for doneness.  A medium grind cornmeal that is a little more course makes the cornbread more like a true “comfort food”.  If you don’t like that extra crunch then use a finer grind. EVERYONE loves this- it is always on request

Definitely the best cornbread recipe. So easy to make. Tastes like dessert. I added a drained can of corn, because I love the whole kernels. Will make this many more times!

I swapped 1 can off creamed corn for the oil and parr of the milk. It was really good. Slightly crumbly, maybe ill keep the whole amount of milk next time. Flavor was great. It was srill moist.

I tried to make it, but I am a diabetic, so I tried to make it with some substitutions. I used half all purpose flour and half almond flour. I substituted the sugar for splenda blend, and used butter instead of oil. Also, my corn meal is whole grain medium grind.  The flavor was so good and it looked beautiful, but completely fell apart when I tried to cut it. I will try again with the actual recipe or I may try my way again, but add another egg.  This experiment didn't work so well, but I will keep at it.

The wife can't handle the gluten so I used barley flour. It was a bit crumbly but I expected that. The taste was terrific. It makes a nice amount too. I used cast iron to cook it in. Turned out perfectly

This was the BEST  cornbread  I’ve ever made! My husband agrees! Loved the oil rather than butter in recipe and altho I had to use coarse cornmeal the crunch was great! This recipe doesn’t need butter when served. Perfect how it is! Thanks for the sharing!;-)

Great cornbread! It's great for a snack, side dish, and for breakfast. I reduced the sugar and salt by just a few teaspoons each and the cake turned out great anyway.

This cornbread is absolutely delicious.  I made it as directed except used 1/2 tsp less of the baking powder, added about 3 tbsp of butter and a few squirts of sour cream.   If you like sweet cornbread, don't decrease the sugar.  I think it has the perfect sweetness.   It is so easy to make and so worth the little bit of extra time.

This Cornbread was great! Simple, flavorful, sweet, and still had that cornbread texture.  I read the reviews and swapped out the oil for the real butter and also 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  I baked it in a pie pan for about 25 minutes. This goes great with beans (aka beans and cornbread) and would be delish just as a side with butter or dessert with honey.  Thanks for the advice and will definitely make again!

I think this is the best cornbread I've ever had! I made it in a cast-iron skillet and served it with some bean soup in the crock-pot to take to a job site for our crew working in cold wind and weather. The crew never used the butter, honey, or jelly on it - they loved it straight out of the pan. Seriously delicious

when I first made it the batter was too thick. I had to add a half cup of milk to it. maybe its supposed to be thick for a cake type thing? but out of all the years ive made homemade cornbread from scratch it is never that thick. I think its because cornmeal and sugar absorbs most of the liquid...anywho I also added a tablespoon of honey and 1\2 cup sugar to make it more diabetic friendly. other than that I love this basic recipie and my hubby does too. its delicious.

Awesome cornbread!  I always bake this in a cast iron skillet.  Coat skillet with shortening and heat the skillet in the oven until temp is reached.  Pour batter in hot skillet and bake as instructed. You will not be disappointed.

This is hands down the best I've ever had, I did change the recipe based a recommendation from other reveiwers.  Instead of 2/3 suger I split that with normal sugar and light brown sugar and I think it made it hust a little better.

Perfect as is! I double the batch and split into thirds, add some jalapenos and a handful of shredded cheese to one bowl and a handful of shredded cheese to another. Corn bread 3 ways :) I've been making this one for a long time, I love it, thanks for sharing!

This is a great straightforward sweet cornbread recipe. I'm a cast iron user and made this in my Lodge 8SK and it was fantastic. I did do 1 1/4 cup cornmeal as we like the cornmeal flavor and it came out absolutely fantastic. From a very easy prep to cook, you don't need to look further. Beings I used a preheated CI skillet, cook time was about 12 minutes.

This was delicious and easy to make. My only problem was I doubled the salt bc I was using kosher, but I shouldn't have. It was too salty. Still, I will make it again. No more Jiffy boxed cornbread for me!

I left out the flour by accident and these were still really good, I didn’t realize that happened until after we had started eating them. Family loved them as they were. Next time I might just add a little flour and less oil. But definitely my favorite cornbread and will save the recipe. Thank you.

Very good recipe.  I've made it twice now.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 c. the second time and thought it was just as good.  My picky 10-year-old son has made his fifth trip to the kitchen to get another muffin.  I made 12 muffins out of this recipe.

Great recipe. Used a little less than half cup of sugar. Instead of oil, I used melted butter. Also buttered the top when it cam out of the oven. Liked by all!

Loved this receipe. I made it as is and my husband and daughter loved it. This is the way I like my cornbread, I feel the Jiffy cornbread mix is a bit more bitter. This one is perfect. Not too sweet and not to bitter.

I decided to make cornbread without the aid of a box mix. I followed the recipe as is, but baked mine in my well-buttered 12" cast iron pan for 20 minutes. It came out with beautiful golden sides and bottom, it was soft, and just sweet enough to counter the chili we ate it with. I will absolutely be making this over and over again as it is so tasty and easy!

The recipe is fantastic, I’ve been using this recipe for over 8 years and the only thing I modified was the amount of sugar.  Other than that it is a full proof recipe  I will continue to use.

I followed one of the suggestions with using 1/3c brown sugar and 1/3c white sugar with melted butter instead of oil. It was awesome and will save this recipe for future use.

Made this recipe with some tweaks to use for my stuffing. We loved it so much I'm sharing my changes. I added an extra egg since my eggs here are mostly medium size; so two eggs. I halfed the sugar on two batches and used even less sugar for the third batch. That makes a cornbread plenty sweet for stuffing. This recipe is so good, hence the 2K+ comments, that it's my new go-to for cornbread anytime!

I was out of butter but really wanted to have cornbread with my chili tonight. This recipe worked great, after reading reviews I reduced the baking powder to 2 tsps but I think next time I will try the recipe as is because mine were a little dense. This one will be going into my recipe box for the next time I am out of butter! My tip for any cornbread recipe - add lime zest and serve with salsa, you won't regret it!

Outstanding!  I took the advice of other reviews and used melted butter instead of oil.  And, used some brown sugar in place of the white sugar.  Added a touch of honey as we like cornbread sweet!  Fantastic.  Never making the box mix again!

Was looking for a recipe that only used one egg and this one worked really well. Changes - 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 brown sugar, 1.5 tsp baking powder, buttermilk instead of milk, and butter instead of oil.

This cornbread has great flavor.  As others have mentioned it is crumbly.  It goes very quickly from undercooked to dry.  Be sure to watch it carefully.  The second time I made it I lined the bottom of the cake pan with waxed paper then sprayed it with cooking spray.  It came out without breaking by doing that.

I doubled it and used half dark brown sugar and half white. Cooked in my 12 inch cast iron skillet preheated in 400-degree oven. melted half a stick of butter in the pan before pouring batter in and added 1/2 stick melted butter to wet ingredients - let the batter sit 15 minutes to soften cornmeal- - was delish warm with butter and honey. will make again. Made a skillet full (I could have filled it more)  + 10 muffins.

Deliciously light and fluffy! I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup. Also, my batter seemed a bit dry so added slightly more milk (might have added slightly too much flour, so probably due to that), only a few teaspoons worth, so the batter was still very thick and clingy.... the result was wonderful, definitely will make again!

Excellent cornbread recipe!  I also substituted buttermilk for milk (since I had it in the house)  and soaked the cornmeal in it for a few minutes. Using melted butter instead of oil gave it a nice buttery taste, but not too much that you can’t add a little on top when it’s cooled??.  Baking it for 25 minutes was perfect, nice and moist, but fully cooked. It had a lovely golden top and the bottom had a slight crisp on the edges. Enjoy!

This was a hit with our family.  My husband said it was not his mom's cornbread and that was good, lol.  Her's was dry and mealy according to him.  

Btw, 9-inch round pan (63.6 sqin) is almost exactly the size in area of an 8-inch square pan (64 sqin).   So use 8-inch square pan if you don't have the round 9-inch pan handy.
Hubby calculated it for me using the pi x r^2 formula.  ;D

This is absolutely my go-to sweet cornbread recipe. To elevate slightly, I suggest cooking in a cast iron skillet - preheat skillet in the oven while oven preheats, put in a decent amount of butter or bacon fat (couple tablespoons), and poor in your batter. When it’s done, it will turn neatly out of the pan with a to die for crispy crust.

No need to change a thing with this cornbread recipe.  I made it using the exact measurements and ingredients and it came out terrific.  I opted to make muffins using paper liners so I reduced the baking time to 15 minutes at 375 degrees.   The cornbread was perfectly done,  not overly crumbly or dry and it had a very nice taste.  It went great with chili.  For my 4 year old I carved out the centers and put in hotdog pieces.  Mom got an A+

This is my new go-to cornbread recipe.  It is fabulous and easy.  I've made it 4 times now, and it's been perfect every time.  The only thing I noticed is that when I ran out of cornmeal and bought a new bag (different brand), the baking time changed - it needed to bake a few minutes longer.  No big deal, though.  :)

Made this twice, doubled the quantities for  a family serving.First time used brown sugar as half of the sugar quantity, big hit with the family.  Second time, same as above and added a can of creamed corn, once again a big hit.

Added and extra 1/4 cup of sugar and  half a teaspoon of Vanilla extract. I also used baking soda instead of baking powder.

Mixed with a mixer.

Cooked in an T-fal actibread machine for about 40min. The center was not cooking enough so Sides came out a bit overcooked since i had to cook it longer then recipe said.

It was just ok. From reading all the comments I was expecting it to knock my socks off so I wound up being a little disappointed. It’s a recipe that I could see myself making again but there’s another recipe I’d like to try before I do.

I followed another poster’s recommendation and soaked my cornmeal in milk while I got the rest of my ingredients ready. Also I used butter instead of oil. This was our family’s favorite from-scratch cornbread recipe so far! Sweet and delicious.

I made these into muffins baked at 400 for 21 minutes and they tasted amazing!!! So moist and flavorful with a nice texture (added a little extra oil based on other reviews). The outside cans out a little dark/brown (not burnt), so I may cook a little less time or lower baking temperature next time. Overall 10/10 from myself and my family!

I made this recipe as it was written. The flavor was off and like other reviewers stated it was the baking powder.  It just didn't taste good.  The texture was fine and it had nice height but we couldn't get past the taste.

I made this recipe yesterday and doubled it because it was for a party. I split it up in 12 muffins and a round 9.5 inch that I sliced and served. It was delicious! Definitely saving for next time.

I left a review  for an alternate version of the recipe. The directions were great. Also, Instead of using all raw sugar you can use half the amount required and mix it with half coconut palm sugar. It cuts down on glucose but still ads sweetness. But the salt may show up more in flavor because palm sugar is definitly not the same. Just mix the two sugars if you are watching your figure.

This is an excellent recipe. Slightly too sweet for me. I plan on using 1/3-1/2 cup sugar in the future. I can then add my own sweetness with honey if desired after it’s baked.

Best cornbread ever, we used organic vegetable shortening instead of oil. We used all organic ingredients and unsweetened plain almond milk instead of regular milk.

This is by far and hands down, THE best cornbread I've ever had! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly! Great texture, and did not fall apart or crumble as other cornbread's I've had did. Thank you for sharing!

This was also my Mom's recipe. Instead of using oil, melt shortening in a cast iron skillet. Coat the sides of the skillet. Pour the melted shortening into the mix. Bake in the cast iron skillet.

It tastes just as good, and if not better than the Marie Callendars corn bread! I did use half the sugar because that’s all I had in my pantry, but it still turned out fantastic! Pic is before adding any butter ??

Delicious!  The only changes I made were that I used half the sugar, and 1/2 cup wheat flour + 1/2 cup all purpose flour instead of a full cup of all purpose.

Exactly what I was after. Do not like corn bread with actual corn, so this was perfect. Pretty much followed ingredients as is. Used 9 inch square dish instead of round. Left in oven another minute. Still ended up just a bit undercooked in center. Definitely using again. Thanks

No changes at all. Well this time I'm out of egg so using substitute but usually no changes. This is our go to recipe. For when I make beans and cornbread or chili and cornbread. Been making it for a couple years now.

First time I make any recipe, I make it precisely as the recipe states. After that I can make adjustments. This was (possibly) my first time making cornbread and I base this on the recipe as is.

As is, this is simply delicious. I just ate a third of the pan (made mine in a cast iron skillet)

For my own taste preferences, I'd probably add a little less sugar. Believe me, it is DELICIOUS as is, but I want mine a little less sweet. I've seen adjustments others have made and I may experiment with using butter instead of oil, or buttermilk instead of milk, just to see what happens. But as of now, this is my go-to recipe! Thank you, Bluegirl!

This is my go-to pizza crust recipe.  It is great every time!  One thing I have found makes it crispier and easier to remove from the pan is adding a little olive oil and some cornmeal on the bottom.  The olive oil makes it crispier and the cornmeal keeps it from from sticking.  Awesome recipe!

Fantastic cornbread recipe! The perfect balance of sweetness. I substituted wholewheat flour for the all-purpose flour, and it turned out great. I also used a round cast iron skillet and it baked perfectly. Would highly recommend this recipe.

I’ve made this recipe several times, but have had to go gluten free in the past year. I made this bread again for a party and substituted Bob’s Red Mill GF 1:1 flour for the regular flour. I also used melted butter in place of the oil and cultured buttermilk powder instead of milk. The end product was incredible, if not better than the original non GF one! Everyone loved it and I can guarantee that had I not said it was GF, no one would have known!!!!

I made some minor adjustments  based on the reviews. I used 1/2 C sugar and 2 tsp of baking powder. Other that I followed the recipe. I baked them in a muffin pan on 400 for 16 mins and they turned out amazing!

I made this for a 4th of July party, and it was a home run, thanks.  I made a few tweaks you might also consider; I only used about 1/4 cup sugar and instead used about 1/2 cup of TJ’s frozen super sweet organic corn niblets.  I used about 1/2 melted butter and 1/2 veg oil.  And I threw in a generous amount of thinly sliced fresh jalapeños.  I also used small batch hand rolled European style butter, local raw honey, a little lemon zest and made some really awesome whipped honey butter (leave it out a few hours so it’s really soft and spready )

Tastes Good but too crumbly and I added extra oil as suggested to avoid this. It didn't seem to help much.

This was my first attempt at making cornbread from scratch and I found the recipe to be really simple which is good for a first timer. However, it tasted too similar to the Jiffy mix you can buy at the store for my liking.

6.10.18 When we BBQ ribs or chicken, we always have cornbread muffins (Southern tradition, perhaps), and these muffins were spot on.  Classic cornbread texture, tender, and moist, nothing not to like here.

Excellent corn bread!  Th eonly change I made was adding a tablespoon of buttermilk powder.  This is a great recipe that I will use often.

I'm from New Orleans and this is my go-to recipe for cornbread. I've made it several times and it comes out great every time. It's a sweet one so you have to be a fan of sweet cornbread but it definitely beats the boxed version. We have it with red beans & rice. DEE-LISH!

GREAT recipe! I made 2 modifications; I substituted vanilla almond milk for cow’s milk and sunflower oil for vegetable oil. It was a huge hit. I used it to top a chicken pot pie and had enough left over to make a baby cake. :)

I substituted butter for the oil( I didn't  have the right kind of oil on hand)...melted it in the cast iron skillet...and then mixed it in to the ingredients.  It was salted butter, so I cut back on the salt in the recipe.  This is yummy with maple syrup.   I will make this again.

Didn't care for this, personally. Texture and consistency were very nice but it almost had a bitter after-taste. I made it per the recipe but was not terribly impressed.

Four stars because I made several changes. 
I only had about 3/4 cup cornmeal so I added 1/4 cup pre-cooked cornmeal (Masarepa) to get the full cup. 
I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 cup. I whisked together all the dry ingredients first. 
I was out of eggs so I used 1/3 cup of applesauce. 
My husband has a dairy allergy so I used substituted 1 cup of oatmilk and I used 1/3 cup of coconut oil instead of canola oil. The coconut oil was  soft but not melted. 
After whisking in the wet ingredients the batter is kind of thick/dense but still pourable. 
Baked in a glass pyrex greased with cooking spray, 25 minutes at 350. 
It was perfect. Just the right amount of sweet and rich, not dry.

My family loved, loved, loved this!  This will be the only cornbread I make any more. The kids like me to make muffins and keep them on the counter in an airtight container for snacking instead of brownies or cookies. They stay "fresh" for several days. Thanks for sharing this recipe with my family!

I did make a few changes. Used corn flour instead of cornmeal. Used 2 eggs. Added 1 tbsp white vinegar to the milk for 10 minutes. Added 1/2 tsp baking soda. Baked at 350 for 38 minutes in an 8x8 pan. Yummmm. So good and moist. Not crumbly at all.

I change to 50% brown sugar and 50% white sugar. Replace oil with butter. Cooked in my waffle maker (medium heat until no steam is coming out. About 4 minutes and 20 seconds.)

Perfect!!

I made this with 1/2 c honey,1/4c raw organic sugar. I turn this into corndog recipe. I put Nathans fat free or low fat hotdogs in it and bake it. It's so GOOD. If your family loves corndogs, try this, they'll love it.

Holy cow this was good. Easy to make, tasty and sweet, and fun to make. I pour the batter in a muffin pan and cooked it for about 18 minutes. I t made 12 wonderful cornbread muffins.
I would make this again and I would pour half the amount in each muffin pan and bake for a few minutes less.

I love this recipe and have been making it for a long time. I don’t change anything on the recipe itself, it is perfect as-is. The only thing I do differently is I bake it in my cast iron skillet. I put the skillet in the oven while it’s preheating plus an extra 10-15 minutes. Then I pour in my batter and bake as normal. The top is still golden brown but the bottom and sides form this chewy delicious crust than helps hold the bread together after you slice it. This would be a good recipe to use as a base and then add jalapeño or put your own spin on it. We like it so much I don’t want to change a thing!

This is a delicious corn bread and great with chili, BBQ or even with a little butter and honey for breakfast. I use the convection setting, and the bread is moist inside with a nice crust on the outside--because the recipe uses oil. Yummy!

My only substitution is that I use Olive Oil. I really don't use other oils and this tastes delicious.

It is VERY sweet and crumbles easily as others stated. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it was still too sweet. Cake sweet. It does fall apart easily and that's a pain but to be expected at times with cornbread. I was looking for a Jiffy copycat recipe and this is better than some other recipes out there.

I did not make any changes and it came out perfect.  I made mine as muffins and baked them for 18 minutes.  I filled the tins about 3/4 full.  The toothpick came out clean and they were delicious.  

I am sure there are more variations that are just as  good.  Next time I will try the recipe that has cheese and jalapenos.   Don't be afraid of this one folks.  Served hot with real butter and honey? Just made the elk chilli even better.

Nice recipe! I followed these variations I read in the Comments: half brown sugar & half white sugar, a splash of vanilla & I baked them as muffins. Yield: 12 regular-sized muffins. Great addition to the bread basket! Savory enough to accompany your meal, sweet enough to enjoy on their own with butter & homemade strawberry jam :)

What a hit!!! The only changes I made was I used half n half instead of milk because that was all I had on hand and butter instead of oil. Will definitely make again!!!

Really yummy, not cake like which I was expecting but also VERY crumbly. I tripled the recipe and made it in a large 9x13 pan and cooked it for 40 minutes or longer. It fed a group of 20 people. I did what other reviewers suggested and used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar. I read a suggestion for adding 1/2 c of sour cream to keep it moist and hold together better. I will try that one or use buttermilk instead of plain milk.

We love sweet cornbread and this was so easy.  Went to make it and was out of milk but I had a carton of coconut milk so I crossed my fingers and used that.  I used melted butter instead of the oil like another reviewer did.  I thought this would help the coconut milk  and it did.  Turned out delicious!  Yes it is somewhat crumbly but who cares?  Not us because it was so good.  I think it was crumbly because it was so moist.  I will make this again and I will make it the same way with the coconut milk and butter!

This is a delicious recipe. It is very sweet, though. Next time, I'll cut the sugar by 1/2 or 1/4. I added 1 small can of corn kernels and about 2 Tablespoons of finely chopped jalapeno peppers, too. I like the added textures.

Excellent cornbread. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and put in butter greased muffin tins. I baked at 375 for about 13-15 min. This recipe is a keeper.

Good basic recipe. Twist it to whatever you want. I've had some good cornbread with jalapeños. 

I baked in cast iron muffin pan. Before adding the oil to the ingredients, I preheated the oven with the pan in it and with about 1/2 tablespoon of the oil in each cup. Then dumped the rest of the oil in the ingredients. Second batch, added a little oil to the cups with the pan still hot. 

I also added about 2 tablespoons of honey. 

Baked 15 minutes in the muffin pan.

Delicious! I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil, but aside from that substitution followed the recipe exactly. Cooked for 25 minutes. I will be making this again - so easy, fast and yummy!

I came,  I saw, I CONQUERED!  My try at this recipe was a major success, even after an ingredient mix up, which actually kick the recipe up a notch.  for those who would like to add a bit of a savory taste to the cornbread,  substitute vegetable oil with olive oil!  You're welcome!

This is the best corn bread recipe that I have made from Allrecipes! Especially if you add 1tsp maple extract. Today, I used whole wheat pastry flour in place of all purpose flour and they were just as good! 2nd batch in 24 hrs.

The only thing in the recipe I changed was the amount of sugar.  I reduced it to 1/3 cup.  It was sweet enough.  I also used gluten free all purpose flour as my husband has celiac disease.  It didn't turn out crumbly like so many gluten free recipes do.

Great recipe to get me started. 

I used brown sugar instead of white, I used buttermilk instead of milk, and I added some corn from leftover corn on the cob. DELICIOUS! EDIT: after reading reviews saying the recipe was "crumbly" use vegetable oil to keep moistness and don't over cook.

This cornbread recipe was simple and delicious. I made it in Greece and couldn't find cornmeal, so I used polenta instead. It was a huge hit. I followed the tips to cut back on the sugar and to let the cornmeal soak with the milk for 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients. This recipe is definitely going to replace the store-bought mixes!

I added a cup of corn and sprinkled a bit of cayenne and adobo on the top. I cooked it in a 9x13 Pyrex dish at 400ºF for ~23 minutes. It turned out great. I might try what someone else did and let the milk soak in the cornmeal more.

I only made two changes and they were by accident, one I used white "self rising" corn meal mix before realizing what I did, and two after noticing I was using the wrong cornmeal I did what someone commented and used a ratio of one cup of flour to  one tsp of baking powder and it seemed to work out. I just figured if anyone else was as silly as I was in not reading it right the first time, this info could come in a little bit handy. And the resulting loaf made my family very happy anyway, yeah it was crumbly but isn't all cornbread crumbly?

The first time I made this, I made it 3 nights in a row because my husband and boys loved it so much.  Now we're making it again for my husband to take to a work pot-luck.   It's our go-to cornbread.  Moist and delicious.  We live near Denver and it rises nice and high despite the altitude.

Gave it a 5 although I made changes as was suggested by others. 2 tsp baking powder, 2 tbls more of oil, add 2 tsp of vanilla.
Baked these at suggested temp for 10 mins in muffin top pans. Some call them whoopie pans. Filled them up. Nice crust on the bottom, very little crumb and very flavourful. Served with liquid honey. GREAT, even my wife liked them and she is not fond of cornmeal anything.

I’ve made this many times, and it’s perfect, I also like to add corn. This time I made it dairy free using neat egg and almond milk and it is just as delicious! A great vegan option if you’re exploring that change or have vegan guests.

Followed the recipe exactly, but put it in a square pan. It took a little longer to cook through, but it was worth it. I will definitely be making it again!

The texture was perfect. I made mini muffins in a Wilton fall pan. The sugar made the muffins glossy. However, that same sugar made it much too sweet for me. I will keep looking for a recipe that is more savory.

The modifications I made to this recipe (added some nutmeg and coconut) were only for personal taste, otherwise the recipe is great as is.  I doubled the size and made both a pan and muffins.

The recipe as is was very bland and crumbled far too easily. With some adjustments it turned out wonderful: double the butter (one part salted, one part unsalted) and double the sugar (one part white, one part brown). I made muffins using these adjustments and they turned out perfect!

I added an extra egg, converted the milk to buttermilk, substituted brown sugar for white, and melted butter instead of using oil.  it came out very well and took approximately 17 minutes and 34 seconds to bake @ 185 degrees Celcius.  it was not dry and not too sweet. it tastes very good,  with a little butter melting over a hot piece, it becomes great.

Outrageously delicious -- tender, moist, tall, easy to make, and holds together beautifully when serving.  Reminiscent of Jiffy Cornbread, only much, much better. I cut mine back to 1/2 c. sugar, and it was still plenty sweet. I wouldn't want it any sweeter than that. The family LOVED it!

This was really good and I only made one change.  We do not eat lots of sugar in my house so I cut the sugar in half, and used brown instead of white,  and I though it was sweet enough with just the 1/3 cup in it.  I needed cornbread for a stuffed squash recipe and this worked perfectly for it.  Definitely something I will make again either as a side or for some other recipe that calls for boxed(yuck) cornbread mix.

I love this recipe! I soak the cornbread in the milk, along with the egg & the oil. I mix the dry ingredients separately & then mix together. I broke the rules though. I put it in a 9" square pan! ;)

I didn't realize how much of hit this was going to be at my barbeque. I made three pans and it was gone in a flash. They loved it. I didn't change a thing and I doubt I would when I make it again.

Followed the recipe to a T, really good!  Had compliments from everyone, in which, not much of the chili I made to go with it was consumed because everyone was eating this cornbread.  Only thing I will do different is cook it a little longer at lower temp, as internally it could have used a few more mins (but top outside was dark brown). This was probably due to having a smaller oven?

Easy cornbread that you'll never need boxed again! SO loved it and had more for breakfast. 

I followed some changes recommended - using melted butter instead of oil, and less baking powder.  I didn't have enough baking powder left so that worked out. I also used brown sugar (personal preference) instead of white and only a 1/2 cup instead of 2/3.  My SO prefers muffin and so I baked a dozen in silicone muffin cups at 400 degrees for around 20-24 minutes.

This came out great with my modifications. I used 1 cup of heavy cream (as it was all I had) and I used 1/3 cup melted butter instead of oil. And used 1/2 tsp salt and 3 teaspoons of  baking powder and I used 2 eggs.   I baked it in 7 large muffin tins for 15 mins. . It was soft and my family kept going for more.

I have been cornbread for all of my life and this is my new no fail recipe. The only thing I do different ti put more oil in the bottom of the pan and heat before putting m batter and I used about a 1/3 cup of mayo. You can't taste it, but it keeps the cornbread from being too dry. :)

As a rule I don't care for cornbread, never have. But this.....this cornbread was incredibly yummy!! Super easy to throw together. Took just a few minutes to mix the ingredients in my KitchenAid, but I could just have easily used a bowl and spoon. I incorporated all the dry ingredients first, then threw an egg into the cup of milk and gave that a quick stir before mixing with the dry ingredients. As per other reviews I did up the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons to balance the amount of sugar. I buttered the bottom and sides of my cast iron skillet and it baked to perfection. I did let mine go an additional 5 minutes (for a total of 15 minutes) to get a golden brown top. It came out super moist, not too crumbly and just a bit crunchy on the outside. This will definitely be my go-to recipe for cornbread!

Can you give it a zero stars? What a joke. Not enough liquid to "pour" the batter into a pan. It was barely biscuit quality, forcing to add milk and an egg to try to having a pan of corn meal. I've had bad recipes from this website before but it proves that this is a worthless resource that misdirects poor people because they manipulate SEO, rather than allowing knowledgable people to post proper recipes. What a load of !

I love cornbread, so I was curious to see how this recipe turned out. I poured the batter into lightly greased muffin tins, like another reviewer suggested.  They took exactly 20 minutes to bake completely, passing the toothpick test. It's the only recipe I'll ever use!

I like my cornbread grainier, so I tweaked the flour and cornmeal (a little less of the former, a little more of the latter). And I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.

Another way to make this more moist is to add a handful or so of grated cheese. I usually use cheddar but if I have a jack-mix on hand I'll use that.

I don't normally write reviews, however I had to comment that this is the FIRST time I've been able to find a great scratch cornbread recipe!  It turned out really ??good!!! I didn't change anything & it was not crumbling as others have experienced. Can't wait to cook it with my chili!

This corn bread is just the way I like it!  Sweet, golden moist and crumbly. It reminds me of the one they serve at Montanas restaurant.   Another reviewer suggested using 1/3  cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown, as well as replacing the oil with melted butter, and I think these changes made it perfect for my taste. I made them in mini  square loaf pans and they were done in 18 min.
Edit* forgot to mention that I also let the cornmeal soak in the milk for about 10-15 min as well.

I've made many different cornbread recipes, but this is by far the best, especially with honey drizzled over it while still warm! It's a bit crumbly, but that doesn't take away from the taste! My family likes it best!

This recipe is going to become a staple in my house! They were eaten up so fast! I kept all the ingredient levels true to the recipe, but it is a tradition in my family to add some whole corn kernels to corn bread as well. We usually make box mix. Adding half a can to a home made recipe was the best addition ever! As another reviewer had mentioned cooking them in a muffin pan, I went with this method. Lightly sprayed the paper muffin cups. The corn bread cooked evenly and came out of the paper easily. I topped them with honey and butter. SO GOOD!

I prefer this as a muffin, as it is on the sweet side. Cooked each tray of muffins for 11 minutes at 400 degrees. Switch oil or butter made no big difference or 2/3 c. sugar vs 1/3 c. sugar & 1/3 c. brown sugar for more of a dessert muffin (served drizzled with warm preserves or honey over a broken muffin) . I do suggest soaking corn meal in the milk while prepping the rest of the batter and gently folding into mixture. Lumps are Gold!

Served this with chili during Super Bowl.  I will certainly make this corn bread again and maybe just add a little more oil and little less sugar.  A definite keeper.

SOOOO good!  I recently was diagnosed with Celiac's Disease and have been trying to replace old recipes with ones that are gluten free.  I substituted the regular flour with gluten free flour and it was delicious!!!!!!  My husband said it it was the best cornbread I have ever made.  I used the 1 to 1 flour from Bob's Red Mill.  I am printing this and adding it to my new list of recipes.  Thank you!!!!

Great recipe! I used a couple reviewer tweaks, like 1/3C each brown and white sugars, subbing butter for vegetable oil, and soaking the cornmeal in milk while measuring & mixing together other ingredients. I also chose to put my batter in cupcake papers and bake in a muffin tin at 400 degrees for about 15 min. I think I could have baked it shorter or at a lower temp as they came out really delicate/crumbly, but other than that they were a hit! Just the right sweetness: MIL makes sweet cornbread, and while it is a hit with the grandkids, I find it TOO sweet. This recipe's sugar content is JUST RIGHT! Thanks for the post!

used coconut milk and coconut oil to replace the milk and oil. also added a splash of vanilla. It is a bit sweeter than I am used to but it is really nice. also used hot cast iron skillet with 2T melted butter and poured batter into hot skillet and put in oven. nice crispy buttery crust!

I made this last week to go with some chili.  I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup because I felt that it would be too sweet.  It came out perfect.  I made muffins because that is what my family prefers.  Delicious and moist.

This was my first time making cornbread to accompany a meal and it tasted great! I didn't change anything, and made it exactly as it was written. I used my brownie pan to make squares instead of a muffin or round pan that was my only change. I would usually pull out a box of Jiffy, but I didn't have any in the pantry and the weather was to bad to drive to the corner market to grab one . No more boxes for me this is my new go to cornbread! My kids loved it!

This was my first attempt at homemade cornbread and it's very good and easy. no more box mixes for me. I did use coconut oil as I do not use vegetable or canola oils, and it tasted wonderful. I add a little more to help with moisture and we love it and the flavor. Also, we're trying to cut way down on sugar so I added just a couple pinches and we're very happy with it.

I did not have milk and was going to use powdered milk and ended up forgetting to add it. They turned out really good. They had a crunchy outside and tender inside. Will definitely make these again.

Loved this recipe! Because I never have what I need on hand, I've replaced a few things and really enjoyed the result. Substituted the vegetable oil for coconut oil. Lends an extra level of sweetness. Only used 1/2 c milk and a can of creamed corn to make up the difference in liquid. Also, used 1 c polenta/corn meal and 1 c masa (fine gound corn) instead of white flour.  So moist and sweet! Went great with our ham on New Year's.

I thought I would give this a try since I can't have my flour tortillas with chili any more, recently gone Gluten Free.  I substituted Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour and Maseca corn flour for the corn meal otherwise followed directions. My family is not big on corn bread so I don't make it often even though I love it. I think the finer texture of the corn flour is what did the trick for the rest of the family. There was nothing left over to put away.

This was my first time making cornbread and it was a success.  Reading all of the reviews this is what I did for my recipe: 
 I brought the milk to room temperature before adding it to the dry ingredients. I did use a little bit more oil to help with the crumble issue.  I used 2tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I ended up using a mixture of white sugar and brown sugar because I accidentally ran out of white sugar. It did not seem to have any major impact on the taste. I greased the pan and added butter and put it in the oven to heat up prior to adding the batter.

Followed one of the suggestions and lowered sugar to 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white.  Delicious!

Excellent. I use 1 c sugar instead of 2/3rd cup but my family grew up on the blue boxed cornbread so they like it very sweet. Great recipe it's the only one you need.

Very good, I soaked the cornmeal as another person had noted in her review.  I also used half brown sugar and the other half regular sugar.  Very, very good.  I will make again.

I made this in a muffin pan, 8-9 minutes in the oven, makes about 24 I filled them about 1/2 full. Also really good with 1/2 tsp of diced jalapenos in each muffin! Sweet with a little heat!

This was great, under 10 mins to make, so easy, very moist and tasty even on day 2. Did not alter recipe at all.  Did not find it crumbly at all like a previous reviewer said. A make again for sure maybe with some added jalapenos next time.

Best recipe I have found. Most important - moist, not dry. Made 42 corn muffins by tripling batter. Perfect sweetness! Made it exactly as recipe said! Will make again.

My first time making homemade cornbread. Loved it as did everyone else. So simple, so good & really nothing to it. I did let the batter sit before pouring it into the pan. I don't know if that was needed but that's the only thing different I did from the recipe. Would definitely make this again & recommend this recipe.

Yum! I preheated the oven with my cast iron pan in it. Beat egg prior to mixing in liquid ingredients. I used raw cane sugar and a whole grain white flour. Once the batter was made I pulled out pan and dropped in about a tablespoon of butter to coat the pan. Once melted I poured in the batter and in the oven it went.  Ended up going for the full 25 minutes.  Will make again.  Thank you for sharing!

My husband and myself really enjoyed this cornbread. It was sweet, moist, and was wonderful with butter and honey at dinner time. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. Only thing different is I used muffin pan and baked 10 perfect little corn muffins. I used cupcake liners and filled to the brim. Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely use again.

I think this recipe is okay... I followed it to the T felt like it came out very crumbly and a little dry for my taste and I didn't like that I could taste the meal. I think it's a great base recipe, I'm gonna try some variations and I'll let you guys know what I come up with.

Didn't make this as yet but recipe sounds exactly what I want. I don't like the flat cornbread that my mother used to call Johnny Cake.
Nut did want to let you know I love the allrecipes.com site. When I see your name on a recipe, I know it's going to be good. Thanks.

Followed the recipe exactly. I used my 9" cast iron skillet instead of a 9" cake pan, 25 minutes. This is the "one" I've been searching for. I was leary due to the fact it has basic on hand ingredients but I now believe less is more. I can see this with bacon, jalapeno, cheese....So GOOD!

I've been making this recipe for years now. The only change I've made is to double the recipe. My family loves this cornbread.  My grandson and his friends devour a double batch in minutes, When I'm baking it, they find any pretext they can to hang out in the kitchen as they wait for it to come out of the oven.
In ADDITION TO BEING A WIFE, MOTHER, AND GRANDMOTHER, I'm also a Boy Scout leader and have made this cornbread in Dutch Ovens countless times while we are camping. It is a "go to" recipe for our troop. It's become one of the recipes I use when teaching boys to cook over an open fire. If you haven't tried this, I strongly recommend that you do. It's amazing!

I have used the recipe over and over for my DH he always insist on more sugar. Not sure how much I add varies but close to 2/3cup sometimes. I use my cast iron we collect and also for fail proof I use silicone. Lately I've used crushed pecans on my summer plates and is an excellent addtion to this receipt!

I loved this recipe! I'm honestly not that great of a cook but this was super easy to make and absolutely delicious! I even had some of the batter out of the bowl it was so good. I'll definitely be making this again!

Very quick and easy to follow recipe! Instead of oil and sugar though, I used real butter and honey. Then I scooped the batter into mini muffin tins instead of one round cake pan. Now just waiting to come out of the oven!

Really good cornbread & easy to make! I did bake it on a convection so not sure if it makes a difference. Great recipe if you like it a little crumbly. I personally like it a little more moist. Next time I'll add more oil.

Love this recipe for sweet cornbread. Only thing I do different is use melted margarine or butter in place of the oil and brush the top in the last few minutes of bake time with more butter. Can you tell I LIKE / LOVE butter!

Great recipe! I followed directions exactly except baked as muffins. I have some picky eaters and thought that the extra sweetness might get them to like corn bread and it worked! Everyone was happy. Thanks for sharing, I'll definitely make again!

I didn't have enough Cornmeal, so had to sub 1/4 cup polenta (corn grits) to round out the cup indicated.  I also had to sub almond milk for regular milk.  Family said that it was good, crumbly and sweet.

I wanted an every day cornbread that was not heavy oor too crumbly,,, something to make quickly from ingredients that were already in the kitchen.  This is it!  Muffins, 17 to 19 minutes.  Excellent!  Now I used it for Chef John's pulled pork filled corn muffins... FANTASTIC!

After reading the reviews I did less sugar and added honey instead to try to avoid the crumbling, it worked like a charm. So delicious and addicting. Even my picky 6 year old wanted seconds.

Yummy! I made very few changes to this recipe. I used buttermilk instead of milk. That's the only substitution. I cooked it in my trusty cast iron skillet that I put in the oven while it was preheating. When the oven was ready, I rubbed a little oil around the inside of the skillet and poured the batter in.  The cornbread turned out sweet, the way we like it, with a nice crunchy crust from the cast iron skillet. We ate it with a southwestern soup recipe from this site, and the whole skillet of cornbread was eaten! Everyone loved it. This one's a keeper for me. Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe tonight. I left out the sugar, don't like sweet cornbread. Only used 1/4 cup of veg. oil, and about 1-1 1/2 cups buttermilk. And only 3 tsp baking powder. It was really moist and not messy like some are claiming. The best cornbread I've made, went perfect with beans. And later tonight it will go perfect with the left over buttermilk. I will definitely be making it again.

This held together really well and was easy to make. However, even for sweet cornbread, this was too sweet. It was like a white cake with cornmeal in it. I'd reduce the sugar to half a cup. I made it in muffin cups, and they took about 19 minutes. 

Next time I'll try it with less sugar, and I'll soak the cornmeal in the milk as others suggested. Maybe that will help bring out the flavor of the cornmeal.

I found this recipe to be very easy to make; it works well and is predictable.

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the oil to just less than 1/2 cup. The original amount of sugar was just too much sweet for me. I added the oil to stop the crumbling.

I consider this to be the perfect recipe now.

I love how easy this recipe was - no fuss at all! I had read a few comments and added another tbsp of oil and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I baked them in a mini muffin and full sized muffin pan - both turned out really well. I served them with a nob of butter straight from the oven - delicious! Will definitely make them again. Next time will increase the oil to around 1/2 cup to make them a bit more moist. Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe and made 24 muffins. My family (2 adults, 3 children) devoured 11 of the muffins the first night with homemade chili. The rest were all eaten the next night. (the only lasted that long because because I was able to chase the kids off). The only thing I changed about the  recipe is that I put a little less sugar and a few tablespoon extra oil, for added moisture. I cooked the muffins for 12 minutes on 400 degrees.

It was so good! I added a little bit of lemon zest, and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 2 tbsp of honey... let me tell you, my family devoured it! It goes great with a cup of coffee or tea, and if you´re feeling a bit fancy you can add some apple cinnamon butter to it :)

This cornbread is simply delicious!!! If you don't like sweet cornbread, this might not be the recipe for you, but my husband and I both thought it was amazing. First time I made it exactly as is. Tonight I am adding finely chopped jalepenos, which I think will go well with the sweetness.  This will be my 'go to' recipe. Why look for something else when I've already found fantastic!

Pretty healthy corn bread. I isn't too sweet and I like the taste. However, even after letting it cool, a tiny layer of the bottom sticks to the pan and the cake is kind of crumbly.

I have made this twice. I did alter it I used milk alternative the 1st time and left out the oil. I also added an extra egg because mine are super small. The second time I left out the milk replaced with it water and added an extra egg again due to super small size left out the oil again. Its perfect for adding to pot-roast. No issues.

Excellent!  I love the flavor and texture.  I followed the recipe as written and it turned out moist, velvety,  sweet, and golden.  Next time,  I'll probably cut everything in half (unless I have guests),  because this recipe makes a lot.

Wow this is an excellent cornbread.  I took the suggestion of another rater who also gave it five stars, and used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  I  also spared about 2 tablespoons of oil and added 2 TBSP of melted butter to equal the 1/3 cup.  I wanted a more buttery flavor.  I may omit the oil all together and just use melted butter next time but it turned out perfect and not at all crumbly. Just buttery and sweet, and picture perfect.  Thanks for submitting this terrific recipe!

I just made this recipe. It came absolutely delicious! Instead of using a 9" round pan, I used a muffin pan (12 servings) and they came out crisp on the outside, moist in the middle, and absolutely amazing! I can't wait to try them with my chicken chili! I will be making this recipe again, thanks for the help!

Sweet and crumbly. I wanted to use one can of creamed corn so I cut down the milk to 1/3 cup. Followed all the other instructions exactly. Came out perfect! Stayed moist even after setting out for a while. Will definitely make again.

High altitude certified! I live at ~6200ft, and I chose this recipe because it used so much baking powder (for the "puff"). I followed the directions exactly other than decreasing the sugar to 1/2 cup, and increasing the oil to a little less than a 1/2 cup.  I used a 9in spring form pan, and it was done in 20 mins. Came out of the pan, no problem after 10-15 minutes of cooling. The extra oil helped it stick together, and the crumb was excellent. Had a sweet, really simple flavor, and a texture that stood up to some butter, honey, and dipping it in chili. Great recipe for picky eaters or having a cornbread that does not overshadow a main course. LOVE IT.

Made this tonight! I used melted butter instead of oil, and added whole kernel sweet corn. It took a little longer to cook through because of the moisture in the corn,  but it was delicious. Very sweet and dense, my husband loves it!

It just didn't have that much flavor, plus it was extremely crumbly and messy. Each slice just fell apart. I'll keep searching for a better cornbread recipe.

No changes, definitely will be making it again!  Made it to go with my chili and every one liked it...it's with ingredients that most of us have in our pantry. Unlike the one from Paula Deen which had no taste.  Whipped this one in minutes after wasting my time with paula's.

Really easy. I made some change in the recipe because I didn't have some of the ingredients. I used 2 bananas cause i run out of eggs and used brown sugar instead of white sugar, i give the time in the oven 35 min. Tasted good and the texture was soft but firm.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. ??

It turned out a lot better then my first batch of home made cornbread from scratch but this time it was really crumbly. Not sure why or if I didn't mix it correctly. I also added just a sprinkle of cayenne to the top after I pour all the ingredients in the pan for a little kick since I didn't have any jalapenos. Overall though it turned out really good!!

Today was my second time making this. The first time I followed the recipe exactly  and it was delicious. The second time today I increased the sugar some by 1/4 cup cause I like my cornbread sweet. It's perfect now. My family loves it and my picky 8 year old beggs me to make some more. It's super easy too. I will never buy boxed again. This truly is an amazing cornbread!!!

I've made this several times, the first according to the recipe and it came out delicious. I've also substituted gluten-free flour for the all-purpose flour, used 1/3 cup of slightly packed brown sugar instead of the 2/3 cups white sugar, and used coconut oil (all three changes at once). It also came out delicious, and was still pretty sweet!

I made a double recipe for a pass a dish to take with  Chili. I made 24 muffins.  The recipe needs no adjustments for muffins. If you cut the baking powder, the muffins won't mound up nicely as you can see in some of the pictures. They were not overly sweet with the sugar as listed. Very good recipe. I saved it to favorites to make again. Other recipes I have made were dry and not very appealing taste wise.

Couple changes in that I used organic sugar from cane instead of white  sugar and reduced that amount to half cup instead of 2/3cup and added 1/4 cup of honey to mix also. Additionally I reduced oil amount by 2tbs. And replaced with 1/4 stick of unsalted butter which improved flavor balance  nicely. This recipe made 12 regular sized muffins with no waste when filled to just shy of 1/4 inch from top of muffin cups.. Just like Boston market which is my barometer for tasty cornbread. Eat them up yum! ??

Made this just as the directions say except I used a 9" square pan instead of a round and it was kind of weird. Texture was off  - a little more gritty than I'm used to and crumbly at the same time. Flavor was just ok and had a slight sweetness to it but not what I was looking for.

I made the batter exactly as written and it was great! The only thing I did differently is I used a muffin pan instead of a cake pan. So simple to make and excellent results!!

I've just started doing some gluten-free baking, and just grabbed this off the 'net as a starting point for a cornbread recipe.  With only a few changes, I got the most amazing, fluffy, gluten-free cornbread on the first try.  I used rice flour instead of white wheat flour and added 2 tsp xanthan gum.   My personal taste preferences had me leave out the salt and cut the sugar to about 1/3 cup.  I used much less oil, too, maybe 2 or 3 Tbsp of light olive oil.  Didn't have any whole milk, so I mixed evaporated milk with water, 50/50.  In fact, it came out so light and fluffy, reminiscent of angels food cake, I might use less xanthan gum next time to get something a little denser and less springy.  Or I might make it the same way again -- it's good!

This is a great recipe for times when I want a sweet cornbread. I used Splenda to cut calories and it turned out great. If you opt to use Splenda you bread will cook faster, I suggest checking it after 15 minutes.

My husband (who is not an expert in the kitchen, but manages to keep us well fed during the week) made this to go with ham & bean soup. He was very proud of it and rightly so - it came out perfectly!! Just the right level of sweetness! A little crumbly, but I can live with that!! This recipe is a keeper!!

I am not a big fan of cornbread, especially the box kind but this was GREAT! My whole family loved it, I will definitely use this recipe again and again. * Great with honey on top, also I added 1/4 cup of melted butter.

Whole family thought it was great!  Usually use a buttermilk recipe but was out of buttermilk so tried this. Delicious. 
This is light without being too cakey, and did taste like cornbread!  
I did only use 1/2 cup sugar in response to other reviews and it was still plenty sweet
To me.  I didn't even use butter it was so moist. Keep in mind we only use coconut oil for baking so that may make a difference in flavor. But it's the new go to now!!

This was really good and both my little boys enjoyed it. My only complaint was it was a little dry and therefore a little crumbly to eat. I did presoak the cornmeal in milk for about 5 mins too and made with half white and half down sugar. I also replaced the oil with melted butter.

This is a good recipe. My only major tweak is to bake the cornbread in a cast iron skillet that is preheated in the oven with 2 teaspoons of shortening. It makes the exterior crispy and leaves the interior nice and moist.

Excellent, simply excellent.  I followed the recommendations of the first several reviewers- and they were so right.  A little more oil, a touch more salt-- and these are the most moistest (sp) ever.  By the way, I used this recipe as the base of my cornbread stuffing.  Can you say delish??!

First time I've made cornbread.  This recipe was very easy and it turned out perfectly. The only change I made was I used Sunflower oil because I did not have vegetable oil. Mine was sweet moist and Not crumbly. It truly was perfect.

This has been the only corn bread my husband has liked since I first tried it almost 9 years ago! 
If there is any left over from dinner, I have it in the morning with butter and syrup, warmed in the microwave with just a splash of milk--pure comfort food. 
The recipe is perfect made just as directed.  I learned the hard way to be sure to use the 9 inch round cake pan.  For some reason it bakes perfectly in that as opposed to using say an 8 inch square or 10 inch round.
Thanks for great recipe.

I did add a little extra oil and a tsp of vanilla.  It was done at 25 minutes, which I set the timer for, as recommended by the other person.  It may have been a little crumbly but it was the best tasting I've ever had.  This is a keeper.

I have never made cornbread before and I never liked it. However, my husband loves it and requested it for his birthday. I found this recipe and tried it and it was great! I'm now a cornbread lover.

Side note: I used butter instead of oil (I prefer to use butter in any baking recipe that calls for oil or margarine)

This is my family's favorite cornbread. I do have to modify it because I have a child allergic to eggs. I substitute 1/3 cup of applesauce for the egg, and this is the first recipe I've found that holds together well even without the egg. It's also deliciously moist - almost creamy inside, and it stays moist for days (if it lasts that long!)

The recipe was easy to prepare, I made it according to the directions.   It was nice and moist and tasted good with the chili we had for dinner.  I rate it as a 4/5 it just seemed to be missing something.  I would make it again, but try some of the suggestions posted in these reviews.

I made this to go with chilli the other night and it was delicious! It was super moist and just the right amount of sweet. My oldest teenage son ate half the pan while we were in the other room!  It was a hit to the whole family which is saying something since my kids range in ages from 5-16. I am definitely printing for the recipe book with all my favorites.

Excellent recipe! I prepared it as instructed. My sole substitution being brown sugar instead of white. I made muffins with the batter. My husband and I ate them warm - straight from the oven with scrambled eggs for breakfast. "This is good cornbread" he said between mouthfuls. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Very good easy to make recipe. One thing I would change is lowering or taking no out the salt from the recipe as I could taste the salt when I ate it. Overall great recipe, this will be my cornbread recipe from now on.

This is my go to recipe for cornbread, I've made it numerous times. I swap the all purpose flour for whole wheat and add diced jalapeños or Anaheim peppers.

The best cornbread I ever made!  My husband enjoyed  it with chili  beans.  I have been looking for a good cornbread recipe and glad I found this. It is moist and the sweetness is just right.   I reduced the baking powder and only use 2 1/2 teaspoons after reading some reviews.   I will be using this recipe from now on.

This was a really good corn bread.  I did take some reviewers  suggestions and added about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and a tiny bit of honey.  It has a nice little crunch on top and an excellent flavor.  My hubby loves it with his chicken tortilla soup!  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

I used whole wheat flour and cashew milk instead of all purpose and regular milk. It was soft and delicious. I baked it in a hot skillet which gave it crunchy egdes??

I literally didn't make any changes to this and they came out perfect. Definitely a crowd pleaser. I saw in one review someone did 1/3 white sugar and 1/3 brown sugar which I will try next time because I love brown sugar. I made the cupcake version on bake 400 degrees at 20 minutes. It is a lot easier and less messy to consume.

I usually just make cornbread from a box mix but found myself with cornmeal that I wanted to use up so I decided to give this a try.  I don't think I will buy box mixes again.  I followed the tip to use 1/3 c. brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar, and I let the cornmeal soak in the milk for 15 min.  I was able to make ahead and put it in the fridge for a couple hours before I was ready to cook it.  So easy and my family ate it up!

Simple and delicious. Reviews suggested adding a bit more vegetable oil to prevent its being really crumbly, so I did that. Turned out great. Definitely will make again.

Good recipe. I mixed fine and coarse cornmeal for a little more texture. Very good and not too sweet. When it took it out of the oven, I took a quarter stick of butter and slowly rubbed it across the top gently to let it melt in while it was still hot. 
I would make it again for sure. I would say check it at 18 or so minutes to figure how long you might need to finish it. I checked it at 22 and it was starting to burn in my oven. Got it just in time.

All I did different was, I preheated a cast iron skillet in the oven and then I placed the batter on the hot skillet. It turned out great and had a great crust.

I went looking for a cornbread recipe. This hit the spot. I made it in a 9in cake pan and it turned out wonderful. For those that do not use cows milk,  I did sub almond milk for the milk and it still came out great. I will be making this again.

Made it twice as the first time one of our animals climbed on the counter and ate most of it the first time. What was left of the first one which was slightly over baked was better than the second one which was stodgy. It was nice, but not amazing. I used the linseed trick instead of egg (1tbs crushed linseed soaked in 3tbs water for 30 minutes) which does make baked goods flaky, however this one was slightly stodgy but also a little gritty. I think that what I would do in future is set the batter aside for half an hour to allow the cornmeal to soak evoke baking which would do away with the grittiness. Will def try again though.

I used 1/3 c. white and 1/3 c. brown sugar (b/c I ran out of white and even though the white was in the pantry I was too lazy to go refill it)... I baked it at 375 degrees in a convection oven for 17 mins (I like my top a bit crunchy!) in muffin tins sprayed with some non-stick spray. Added a dash of vanilla, a tad more oil to avoid the crumble and voila!  I have baked this several times before without changing a thing and it's  good either way! Next I will experiment with corn kernels, jalapeño peppers, and maybe some cheddar as add-ons!

This is great! We grind our own white wheat & corn and use 1/2 of the sugar called for. We also use melted coconut oil for the vegetable oil. Family favorite! We don't eat much sugar, so 1/3c.  works for us. However, when we make this for others, we use 1/2c. of sugar. Everyone loves it!

Absolutely love this recipe and have been using it for years. I no longer buy Jiffy since I started making it. Read all the reviews and took the advice of others to use melted butter instead of oil. My kids prefer the taste of the butter/margarine and I would have to agree.  Definant keeper!!

I made two batches and put in a 9x13 baking pan. I used buttermilk instead of regular whole milk. I baked beautifully. Usually when I double recipes it doesn't turn out right so I made the two batches to be safe.

Very good balance between cornbread and super sweet cake like cornbread.  Next time I will add just a tad bit more oil to suit my tastes.  A keeper recipe!

Absolutely delicious. I took a suggestion in the comments and soaked the cornmeal in the milk before mixing everything together. My mom said it was the best cornbread she'd ever had in her life. Definitely, definitely making again.

We're used to Jiffy in the box for is ease of prep.  Tried out something new as I had cornmeal in the cupboard.  Simple, easy and delicious!  We put ours in a 9 inch pie pan.  Great recipe!  Next time, I'd like to add cheese and jalapenos.  It's not too sweet either!

I love this recipe. I didn't think it was overly sweet but it's sweet. I'm sure you can cut the sugar down to half a cup and it'll still taste good. And I only used 2½—3 tsp baking powder which helped with it being not crumbly.

I made this cornbread for my Chili Cookoff at work.  Since I had to make a large batch, I multiplied the recipe x 4 for a 17 1/2 by 12 1/2 foil pan. I took reviewers recommendation and used butter instead of the oil.  I also added corn. It came out very moist and was an instant hit!

This recipe made a dozen large, moist, delicious muffins.  I baked a batch to wrap individually for freezing.  Thanks for sharing it!

I had to add more milk after everything was mixed, was too dry. I just poured some in. And I used a non gluten flour instead of regular flour. It was very good! I made muffins, although it didn't make 12 muffins, it made 9. I was happy though with this recipe! I did let the  organic milk soak into the cornmeal for about 15 minutes before adding rest of ingredients. And I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla and cooked in muffin tins.  I kept everything else exactly the same.  These came out perfectly delicious.

I tried the recipe 3 times. Once as written. Once I substituted 1 cup of buttermilk for 1 cup of regular milk. It was great! The last time I made it which was today, I substituted 1 cup of evaporated milk for one cup of regular milk. This is my favorite thus far!

This is a very solid base recipe which gives you wiggle room to create your own favorites. I've used it as table bread and recieved plenty of kudos. I also used it in stuffing which turned out absolutely fabulous! I'd like to thank the chef for sharing!

A lot of people like it because it's really moist.  I make it in an 11 inch baking pan instead of a 9in. It makes a difference, the bread doesn't come out as tall but the response I get is better with larger pan.

It's official, my husband said this was better than his grandma's cornbread (shhh) and the only recipe I could use. I have been experimenting lately to try to make our cornbread low in "points" for WW. I threw that out the window tonight and made this. It was a hit. Thanks!

I LOVE a super sweet cornbread. I did the  1/3 cup white and 1/3 cup  brown sugar, used butter instead of oil,  added the 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, added a spoon of molasses, and added jalapeño slices from a jar. Sooo delish!!! Went over well in my household.

Great recipe and easy to follow. I used salted, sweet cream butter in place of the vegetable oil and soy milk in place of regular milk. I aslo added extra sugar (I like mine sweet). Very moist and sweet. And to make it easier to serve, I used my perfect brownie pan for even little squares.

I made it exactly as written.  I did soak the cornmeal in the milk for 10 minutes or so while I prepared the pan and measured/mixed the dry ingredients.  But I didn't change the measurements of anything.  It was a big hit with my picky family (husband, and kids ages 8 & 10).

I made the recipe exactly the way it says and everyone loved it! My father-in-law loves sweet cornbread and he actually cut a pretty big piece to take home lol... There's a Mexican restaurant here in town that makes it with pieces  of corn so I'm thinking of smashing up some corn and adding it on to the recipe with a dash of vanilla just to play with it. But trust me I'm not a big cornbread lover and I loved this recipe! You must try it!

Reintroduced myself to this recipe after abandoning it for no reason what so ever. It is as always a solid recipe and turns out well every time. Consistency is key. This cornbread is superb. I added a little sugar because I wasn't adding honey to the top like I normally do. Also added a touch more canola oil...because I loathe dry cornbread. Give this a try!

Super yummy!  Super easy!  Super fast!  This is some great cornbread.  The first time I made it, it was a bit too sweet for us.  Cut the sugar in half, not sweet enough.  Used 1/3 cup plus half of a 1/3 cup (I don't math haha)... just right.  I've also made it missing ingredients:  extra light olive oil or shortening instead of the veggie oil, 1/4 cup extra milk when I didn't have an egg, and it came out great.  I didn't have a "crumble problem", don't know why.  I do let mine "rest" a bit before I stick it in the oven.  Best way to cook it:  grease a cast iron frying pan with shortening, put it in the oven, turn the oven on and let it stay until it’s at the cooking temperature.  Pull it out and pour the batter in... it should sizzle a little.  It’ll give you a nice crispy crust and a tender interior.  Best way to eat it... crumble into a glass, pour in the milk, drizzle with a little honey.  Deeeeelish!

It turned out great. I subbed mayo for the oil in the same measurement (thinking how moist my cakes turn out).

I thought some homemade cornbread would go great with my husband's famous fried chicken, so I tried this recipe. I've never made cornbread before but this recipe is so simple and delicious. Whether you're a beginner or a pro you'll LOVE this recipe. If you're skeptical about using sour cream don't be, I'm not personally a s.c. person but I followed the recipe and it turned out extremely moist. With some recipes the bread can come out dry and crumbly but not this one! I have written it down for future use and with Fall approaching in the next few months can't think of anything better than this to go with chili or any cool night with soup.

I had lost my Mother's cornbread recipe and was delighted to find this one that was almost an exact match. Sweet and tasty, although I might try cutting the sugar back a tiny bit. I think this is a good basic recipe to which you could add jalapeño or cut corn or rosemary or anything else that works with cornmeal.

This recipe was perfection! I normally use Jiffy sweet cornbread mix but was out and then I found this recipe. The only thing I did different was use white cornmeal and powdered milk (as I don't keep regular milk as it spoil before it gets all used). I also cooked in a muffin tin sprayed with oil and cooked at 400 degrees for 20 min. Came out wonderful!

I made this recipe, but I didn't had enough flour so I switch the amount with the cornmeal and it came out good. Instead of 3 cups of flour I only put one and 3 of cornmeal. My whole family love it!

My Grandmother loved what she called "Johnny cake" and after she came to live with us then got too sick to make it herself she taught me to make it. I was just a kid but I was happy to do the chore because she shared it with me. 
I haven't really made it sense she passed away.... (Have you ever done math in you head and came up with an answer that couldn't be right so you wrote it out and it turned out it WAS right) She passed away 30 years ago! (1984 Please check my math. I'm still not completely sure it's right) I think she got the recipe from HER grandmother who called it Johnny Cake around the time of the US Civil War
I made this recipe the other day and it came out too crumblely so I tried again adding two eggs instead of one and it came out perfect.
  I miss my grandmother so I'm going to go enjoy my fresh "Johnny Cake" AKA Cornbread.

Delicious corn bread!! I made two cake pans and my family LOVED IT! I will definitely be making this recipe again!! I made no modifications and my only issue is the fact the cornbread stuck to the pan. Still wonderful!

Very good and easy to make! Followed the recipe as it is and they came out very good and fluffy. 
Anyway, next time I'll add a tiny bit more oil as some suggestions said just for extra moisture and a splash of vanilla just to see what happens ;) 
A good recipe for sure, thanks!

Soaking the cornmeal is a good tip. Great recipe easy to make gluten free by substituting gluten free flour for the regular flour. Yum

My favorite cornbread recipe!!! Everyone wants me to make it and everyone wants me to give them the recipe. I add a little bit of honey to the batter and rub a stick of butter over the top wen it comes out the oven.

Love this recipe!  So easy & so yummy!  Today I made it & ran out of milk to I had to use 1/4C evaporated milk & they turned out even better.  Not crumbly at all & so fluffy.  I also sprinkled a mix of white sugar & brown sugar on the top as a topping.  MMMmm mmmm good!

I love this recipe, after making it several times, I have tweaked it to make it my own, by using turbinado sugar in place of white sugar, added an egg and combined sunflower oil with melted butter, made this cornbread simply awesome!

Soo good!! Moist and sweet! Substituted melted butter instead of vegetable oil and added a little more than the suggested 1/3cup. Soaked the cornmeal in milk for 10mins before combining with the rest of the dry ingredients. Mixed in 1tsp vanilla extract.

Very good and I had everything on hand... I will for sure use this as my cornbread recipe.  I might even try adding some canned or frozen corn to it next time.. and maybe some fresh jalapeno.

I made this today and it was really a good recipe, the family liked it very much. Took 25 minutes and it was perfect. Only change was butter for the oil. Thanks bluegirl

As I was learning to cook/bake I always wanted my Mom's cornbread.  I love the simplicity of the recipe and easy to make.  I love it. Superb. My husband & kids love it.  I do cut down on the sugar, but that is my preference.

Had to substitute mayonnaise for egg.  It was delicious (and not crumbly at all!)  Here's a photo of our second batch.

Wow, these are better than most corn muffins! I used buttermilk (vinegar in milk), a mix of butter and oil, and 1/2 cup sugar. They didn't rise as much as I thought they would, but the taste and texture and moistness were excellent.

Excellent Cornbread recipe. Followed it to the letter, and it came out  delicious, moist, and perfectly sweet. If you have never made cornbread, or don't have a favorite recipe, try this one out. Easy enough to remember off the top of your head too.

I think this recipe calls for too much baking powder. The result of using 3-1/2 teaspoons was a bitter bread. I am guessing that 2 teaspoons is more than enough for this recipe.

Awesome recipe...baked this cornbread in my grandmother's cast iron skillet! So delicious, also spread a very small amount of butter & honey to make a glaze after it was done. The edges were crisp, and golden brown!

I should start by telling you that I don't follow baking and or recipes exactly. I read a few and put what I like together and hope it works... I liked how simple this recipe was but I don't keep milk in my fridge, so I in turn used a dollop of plain Greek yogurt and cup of water. I used brown and white sugar, 1 tsp of chia seeds, a hefty sprinkling of frozen organic corn and instead of vegetable oil, melted Earth Balance soy free. I was a little wary but this is by far the best sweet corn bread I have ever had!! Eat with caution because it may disappear in front of your eyes!

Great recipe! I used powedered milk (1/3 cup to 1 cup water) and margarine instead of oil and it turned out awesome. I also put a pan of water in the oven to keep it moist. It is fairly sweet but not over the top.

Very tasty!  Learn from my fail and grease your muffin pan well, lest you end up mining cornbread crumbles out with a spoon.  Maybe it was something I did wrong, but it wouldn't come out of the pan, then it crumbled to bits, albeit tasty bits!

This was a really good recipe but I did find it all a bit to sweet and I had already out in less sugar. I guess it depends on your sweet tooth and what it is being coupled with. I had also run out of vegetable oil so I used olive oil which was fine so don't panic if you find you don't have all the ingredients.

Very yummy.. I just made a few changes... I did 1/3 Cup of White Sugar and 1/3 Cup of Brown Sugar and then to replace the Egg I did Flax Meal ( To replace one egg it's one Table spoon of Flax Meal and Three Table spoons of water) It was very moist and yummy.. I copied and placed it in my recipe book.. Mmmmmmm So yummy..

My family loved it!!! We took the muffin route instead of the round cornbread.  I did the 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar and butter in place of oil.  Too good!! Will definitely make again and again.

My friend has been making his cornbread for years and it is delicious, but this year I decided to compete with him in a cornbread competition.  I used this recipe and I WON!!!  I used an 8X8 round pan so had to bake it a little longer.

This will be my new corn bread recipe. The only thing I did different was I used a 12" x 71/2" pan. The corn bread was great. The leftovers we had the next day were as good if not even better. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

It was a little crumbly but still very moist.
I added some corn kernals as well.

I followed the recipe as it is.  The only thing I changed is reducing amount of sugar to 1/2 cup.  You can still taste the sweetness.  It is so quick and easy!  My 6 year old typically doesn't like cornbread loved it.  I would definitely make it again.  No more store brought!

We are now gluten free.  I substituted Namaste's GF Perfect Flour Blend for the regular wheat flour.  Although the bread didn't rise very much, the flavor was sweet and the bread itself was soft, moist, and springy (which is surprising considering the many GF failures I've had).  Also used melted butter since I was out of canola oil.  YUM.  The kids wanted seconds and thirds.

This recipe is AMAZING! I used it for corn muffins, and they came out just like they would at any bakery. Many people say to cut the sugar, I agree ONLY if you're making savory cornbread to go with say chili. Otherwise, as a sweet treat, keep the sugar, and add maybe 3 tbsp of brown sugar. I substituted the oil with melted no salt margarine  and used evaporated milk. I also threw in maybe 1/4 cup pancake mix and 1/4 cup more corn meal. Like many suggested, I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and a pinch more salt.
Although I made a few alterations of my own, I'm sure following this recipe to the T would make equally as great muffins.
This is a keeper!

I've made this recipe several times and it is a great, easy cornbread recipe.  Not being a 'true' southerner, I like a little sweet to my cornbread and this is just right.  I do add some chopped pickled jalapenos to the batter for a little kick.  Thank you so much!

This recipe was the best! I took some of the advice that some of the others had listed on here. I added 1 cup of sweet corn. Used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, a little cinnamon and a little vanilla flavoring. I also used mini muffin pans and made sure to grease them well. I did let them cook with the oven on for about 10 minutes and then turned the oven off but let them stay in there to finish cooking. They came out perfect! Not a single 1 crumbled. Definitely will make again. Everyone loved them.

I've been baking cornbread for my family for over 35 years.  The recipe I was using was very good, but had too many steps to accomplish a great end result. I wanted to make a change to a simpler recipe and decided to try this one. I wasn't very impressed at all. My original recipe separated three eggs where I mixed the batter with the yolks, then had to whip the whites into a meringue & fold into the batter. This recipe used only one whole egg, but was a bit on the salty side, including the small amount of batter left behind in the bowl.  The finished product came up tasting salty and dry, even with an addition of vanilla that I added after the wet ingredients were incorporated because it lacked flavor.  I'm going back to my standby recipe, which has never disappointed me.  As the old saying goes, "if it isn't broken, don't fix it!"

Just tried this golden sweet cornbread. Indeed it is fluffy and right. Soaked my cornmeal in meal for some minutes while combining the rest of the dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Reduced my sugar and yet was so delish.i love it and will be making it again. My family and guests love it.

Amazing corn bread. My bf said he does't even like corn bread but, he gobbled this right up.  I have some in the oven right now.  I make corn bread muffins. And it is corn bread so of course it crumbles.

Substituted melted margarine for the oil because that's what I had. Came out sweeter than I'm used to so next time maybe I'll use less sugar.

They were really good except maybe a little dry. After reading some of the reviews I used 1/2 cup of honey and made them into cupcakes. First time having a corn bread muffin and it sure won't be the last! Thanks for sharing, was really good!

One of my favorite cornbread recipes.  I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup and add frozen sweet corn.  This makes a delicious cornbread stuffing recipe.  I add it to cubed up french bread, pecans, dried cranberries, apples, celery, chicken broth, caramelized onions, and pork sausage.

Consistently gobbled up whenever I make this (at least once per month).
Thank you Bluegirl for sharing.
I sometimes add a dash of cinnamon, but ALWAYS 1t of vanilla to batter and sometimes raisins.  I have made it with half whole wheat and it was still delicious.
Thank you Bluegirl for a great recipe.

Great recipe. Tastes similar, but of better quality, to the Trader Joe's boxed mix which my family likes. I followed one of the other reviewers suggestions and used half white sugar and half brown sugar and it turned out really good. My entire family enjoyed it and I ended up making a double recipe the second time I made it because it vanished so fast the first time around.

I decided to try out this recipe and it was really easy to make. I made a few substitutions though. Instead of all purpose flour and baking powder, I used self rising flour.  I substituted oil for melted butter and  used half cup sugar instead of the 2/3 cup. I also added vanilla and cinnamon to spice it up. It came out fantastic for a first timer! You won't regret trying out this recipe.

This is a great recipe..I thought it was a little on the bland side so I added one cup of sweet corn kernels to 24 servings. It was very good. The kernels also helped it stay together when eating it. Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe but like to tweek a bit myself, I use fresh ground flour I use whole wheat flour made with hard white wheat, the sweetener is honey powder, but last but not least I make my own fresh ground cornmeal made with white popcorn kernels it makes a wonderful cornmeal wow what a difference fresh ground ingredients makes. My wife for the most part dislikes cornbread but she loves mine. The flour and cornmeal I sift with a very fine mesh sifter. It makes for a very fine powder both the flour and cornmeal which makes the cornbread very light and oh so good!!

I made this cornbread yesterday to have with chicken and white bean chili.  We LOVED it.  I did make some modifications due to our dietary needs.  I have been searching for months for a recipe that would hold up to substituting whole wheat flour for white, since that is all we use, and we have found a winner.  :)
I took a reviewer's advice and soaked the cornmeal in the milk for half an hour before mixing the ingredients.  I used organic sugar and cut the amount to 1/4 cup.  I also used 1/2 cup butter to avoid the dryness some reviewers complained of.  
The result was a moist, slightly sweet and delicious cornbread.  Thanks so much!

I couldn't stop eating the cornbread! I used gluten free flour and less sugar and it tasted wonderful. Mine did not crumble. This is a for sure life time recipe in our household.

I didn't not like this recipe, but it wasn't great either.  It crumbled way too easily and the flavor wasn't mind blowing. We all ate it, but I'll keep searching for a really great recipe.

Really good cornbread! I mix cornmeal with milk before adding to other dry ingredients. Also used butter instead of oil. Nice and sweet!

Love it! The second say it has a sweet, sticky top that's scrumptious!! Warm from the oven it's great, too. The only variation I tried is souring my milk for a few minutes beforehand. But I do this with all my recipes. The buttermilk effect along with the baking powder makes for light and fluffy recipes without fail.

My husband, daughter, and I love this corn bread recipe. It almost tastes buttery, even though it doesn't have butter in it. The texture is nice and it goes really well with chili. I will definitely make this again.

Hooray for this recipe!  I live in Europe, so if we want cornbread, I have to make it from scratch.  I had tried several recipes, but they weren't quite "it" (perhaps because the Romanian cornmeal we use is a bit different from American cornmeal).  But this recipe did the trick and my kids love it.  Thanks!

It thought it was delicious! I used annanthony's tip using 1/3 brown and 1/3 white sugar. I also substituted vegetable oil for olive oil because it is what I had on hand. It came out absolutely perfect! The bread even had a lovely, crispy edge from the olive oil (so I hear!). It was my husbands first time ever trying cornbread and this recipe had made him a new fan :)
Thanks so much for the great recipe!!

I have a few cornbread recipes saved but I always seem to go straight to this one. It's a nice combination between flour and cornmeal - not too much of one or the other. Sometimes I replace the oil with melted butter but it's good either way. I do, however, always add a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla, but that is just a personal preference. Good stuff.

THIS is the recipe I have been looking for all these years! I was out of vegetable oil, so I used 1/3 cup of melted butter instead.  Excellent!!  Sure beats my recipe that calls for bisquick and bakes up to more of a cake-like density.

Nice recipe! I didn't have enough milk, so I mixed some sour cream and water for the "milk". Added a ting more salt & some vanilla as suggested because I know how I like my food. Also added a little more oil as suggested in hopes of curing the crumbliness but it didn't work...probably because sour cream is richer than milk. However, even with the above, cornbread was awesome and fluffy. I think this recipe will be better using all milk versus my concoction, but it worked with just a bit of tang at the end. 4 stars because of crumbles. Enjoy!

I reduced the baking powder by a half teaspoon and used a quarter cup of butter and 1/8 a cup of olive oil instead of 1/3 c. vegetable oil. Also, made muffins instead of "bread." Came out great. My roommates asked what mix I used and acted all amazed when I told them I made them from scratch. They loved them, and I did too, and I'm not usually a fan.

Cornbread heaven!!! This recipe is definitely 5-star in my book! I used buttermilk because I'm just partial to buttermilk in cornbread.  I have tried various recipes in the past, but never found one that I liked as much as this one.  as so many others have stated, it's a must to make this cornbread in a black cast iron skillet! Nothing else would do it justice! The only problem with this recipe is that you might eat all of it before you get to serve it to family or guests!  Can't wait to make it again--and to even try a jalapeño version of it!

I love this recipe. I too use melted butter instead of oil, but thats the only change I make. I love making it with chili. The sweet with the spicy hits the spot.

I found this recipe here, since I didn't have one. I chose this one because it had a lot of really good reviews. I made it and my husband baked it on the grill. I must say, it is really good. I baked it once in the oven to see the difference. It was fine from the oven; but it is so much better on the grill. I follow the recipe, it is quick and easy to make; I don't change anything. I just cook mine on the grill. Try it. It's delicious.

This comes out perfect every time. I do use applesauce instead of oil and use raw sugar instead of white.

Just needed a quick cornbread recipe, because my husband was smoking ribs and I thought it would be better than biscuits.  This was the first one to pop up,and it was easy, fast, and super tasty!  Will be my go-to recipe for cornbread.  I used a square cake pan, and had to cook it about 5 minutes longer.  Good texture and flavor.  Thanks!

This recipe yields a delicious sweet cornbread.  I have been using this recipe for several years and recently I have made a few substitutions to make it a bit healthier-- I swap the white flour with whole wheat flour, cows milk for unsweetened almond milk, unsweetened applesauce for the oil, a "flax seed egg" for the chicken egg, and I reduce the sugar just a bit (my substitutions do make it quite a bit lower in fat and also vegan for anyone that eats that type of diet).  The recipe turns out great when made as the recipe indicates or when made with my substitutions.  Another quick note-- when I use baking powder that has aluminum my foods often get a bitter taste to them, if anyone has this issue I recommend you try using an aluminum free baking powder as that will likely clear up the bitter taste problem.

This recipe is perfect! Be forewarned: it's on the sweet side, so if that's not your thing, you may want to look elsewhere. But I love sweet, moist cornbread and this really hits the spot.

Doubled the recipe and used a 9x11 pan. Baked for 35 minutes at 375. Used Coconut milk instead of milk to make it dairy free.

Super crumbly, but incredible flavor and still soft a few days later.  I was out of normal milk, so I used coconut milk instead and it work well.

I have been using this recipe for two years! I haven't used jiffy mix in two years!. What does that mean this is a great tasting dish. It doesn't have a weird after tast like jiffy and it's cheaper than buying jiffy. However I changed it a little. I use 1 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 cup. Make sure your cornmeal has not expired. I used expired cornmeal once and it had a weird (jiffy) taste to it. I also made them in my cupcake pan most of the time (cooked faster). Delish!!!

First sweet cornbread recipe I've ever made and it came out exactly the way I like it when I buy it elsewhere -- crunchy on the outside, great texture @ about 22 minutes of baking time in my oven in a parchment lined, ungreased cake pan. Next time, I'll make them in muffins for a more convenient snack size but will make no changes to any of the ingredients listed. Thanks for sharing this -- it's a real keeper! :-)

Fantabulous!!!! very easy to make, comes out just perfect. It's a winter blast here in Kansas, I threw together some homemade chili and fell into panic mode when I realized I had no "jiffy" cornbread mix. I looked online to find something simple and waaa~laaa here it is.. funny thing is I was a splash short of vegetable oil so I threw in a spoonful of margarine, it saved the day!! Thank You Thank You Thank you!!

This was a very good recipe!  I took the suggestion of using melted butter instead of vegatable oil and it made all the difference!  I ended up with a much richer tasting cornbread than I had before.  My family also commented that the first batch of cornbread had a slightly acidic taste to it so I cut the baking power amount down to 2 teaspoons and that seemed to work out as well.

2 teasponns of baking powder is plenty. Do use the full amount of sugar. It needs it. Otherwise good and moist. added a cup of corn too.
Could use a little butter even in place of the oil. Nice simple and fast, thank you

I love this cornbread! It has just the perfect amount of sweetness. I usually like to make it, when I make chilli and everyone devours this cornbread. Not sure about the other reviewer complaining about it crumbling, what cornbread doesn't crumble a little?! I make the recipe as is, no changes. Trust me it's delicious!

I made this corn bread tonight to accompany a white chicken chili. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and still found it a bit too sweet. Otherwise this cornbread was very good. Next time I make it, I will add even less sugar.

Very good.  The only thing I added was 1/8 cup of egg beaters in addition to the one egg to try and counter the crumbliness that others complained of.  It was still crumbly when I cut it warm, but once cooled it stayed solid.  I made this with waistline friendly chili and they were both great and even better together.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this on a whim to go with our canned turkey chili dinner (hadn't planned for dinner appropriately). My interest was piqued by the apparent simplicity of the recipe.  I was not mistaken, it was quick, easy, and most importantly DELICIOUS! It was the best part of the meal =P I did as review annanthony suggested and soaked the cornmeal in the milk for 10 mins, and used half brown sugar and half white.

I was disappointed that my cornbread was dry and crumbly.  I used Splenda instead of regular sugar due to the fact my husband is a diabetic and I regularly substitute white and brown sugar with Splenda brand.  I wonder if this made it dry ?

This was my first time trying cornbread and what a way to dive in! I can't imagine looking for other recipes. This was easy and straightforward, scrumptious and light- utterly delicious. I used milled corn that I sifted, and I still got some crunch. I might try it next time without sifting and see how it turns out. I used half a cup of sugar, but it was still a tad too sweet for me; will use just a little less next time. However, the sugar does make it a great snack on its own, so no worries. I mixed powdered milk and water to get the quantity of milk called for, but in no particular ratio; I just made sure it was really creamy. I did add more corn flour and all purpose flour, about two tablespoons each. It was only when I had it baking that I saw some reviewers had advised 2 teaspoons of baking powder, but with the 3 and a half, it turned out fantastic. Loved it and will definitely keep making it.

Although it is a bit crumbly as others have mentioned, it is still delicious! I took the advice of others and baked the cornbread in a muffin pan instead of a round cake pan, so that we could have individual servings without any cutting. Thanks for sharing, bluegirl!

Very good!  I changed a few things,  melted butter in place of oil. Decreased to 1/2 cup sugar. Soaked cornmeal in the milk for about 10 minutes.  Next time I think I will decrease the baking powder to maybe 3 tsp or even 2-1/2 tsp.

I love this receipe and so does everyone who trys it.  The only changes I make are to let the batte stand for 15 minutes and use a  preheated stoneware pan. Then pour the mixture in and bake.  This gives the crust a crunchy texturer.

This has been my go-to cornbread recipe for the last two years. I am gluten-free, so I swap all purpose flour for Bob's Red Mill gluten free all purpose flour mix. I also use 1/2 c. of Stevia instead of the sugar, and haven't noticed a difference in taste. I sometimes add a chopped jalapeno and 1 cup of shredded cheddar, and it goes great with chili. It seems to turn out best when I mix the ingredients, then let the batter sit for about 15 minutes. Turns out great in a muffin tin or my favorite way, in my grandma's old 9" cast iron skillet.

This cornbread was exactly the taste that I was looking for.  Sweet, but not too sweet, slightly crisp exterior, and moist inside.  I used melted butter instead of veg oil per another reviewer.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this as written except I used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown.  I personally thought it was just the right level of sweetness.  Since it's so easy to make, I will definitely be making this again.

This was the best corn bread ever!  I read the reviews and tweaked the sugar and baking powder like others suggested and it was wonderful.   Moist and just sweet enough.  I used 1/2 Cup Sugar instead of the 2/3 and one less tsp of baking powder.  It was quick and easy. I paired it with my homemade chili and got rave reviews from my family and friends for an impromptu get together.  Will definitely make again!  (My boyfriend has never liked corn bread as I usually make the box kind which is ddry and crumbly.  He loved this!).

Easy and yummy, I doubled the recipe but was low on milk so I substituted 1/2 of the milk with 1/2 plain greek style yogurt. Raves from the dinner party! Success. Earlier in the day I mixed the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients in separate bowls and let the bowls sit until just before dinner. 1/2 hour before dinner I mixed them together by hand and I used preheated cast iron skillets instead of the cake pans.  The skillets were doused with a bit of olive oil and tossed into the 400 degree oven until hot, I divided the doubled recipe into the two hot skillets and returned them to the oven.  I was busy having fun so I don't know how long it took to cook but when I remembered them, they both were perfectly puffed and golden brown.  I let them cool just a minute and cut them into big wedges to serve with dinner. Best cornbread I've ever made, I can see many ways to dress up the recipe with savory or sweet ingredients.  YUM*****

This is the best ever cornbread recipe.  I did take the suggestion of others and added a tad bit more oil and my daughters suggestion of adding about a cup of corn kernels. This is definately a keeper!  Thanks!

This is, by far, my favorite recipe for cornbread. I've been making it for a while now, and it is always welcomed at the dinner table. Tastes like a delicious corn muffin for breakfast, too. This is one of those recipes that I have never varied, making it exactly according to the directions. Easy to make and comes out perfectly every time.

I love this cornbread!  I make it exactly as written.  The only drawback is I can't resist eating two large pieces every day until it is gone.  I have made it often since discovering this recipe.  It cooks through without burning in my iron skillet and is so fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness, equally at home with topped with maple syrup or in a bowl of pinto bean soup.

I tried this recipe in a bread loaf pan, baked in an old-school moroccan bread oven (a metal box with an open flame on the bottom). It worked PERFECTLY. Moist, lightly sweet, all-American cornbread! Serving it hot with butter and honey for a group of Moroccan women. Thanks for making me feel at home for just a moment!

Really good recipe.  I substituted 1/2 whole wheat bresd flour instead of all white flour, and it was really tasty.

I just tried this, using a bag of cornmeal left over from the War of 1812, and baking powder long past its best before date.  It was just great, felt like eating the whole pan for lunch.  By the way, I used olive oil, but, greased the pan with butter.  Oh, and skim milk.

Loved this recipe!  I love that it is sweet!  Just like my Grammie's!!!  I made it Gluten Free, though.  I omitted the regular all purpose flour and replaced it with the same amount of gluten free flour (ex. Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Flour).  Thanks for sharing it!

This was wonderful, and so easy!  I love sweet cornbread, but this was just a tad too sweet, even for me.  I think next time I'll reduce the sugar by 2 Tbl.  It was super moist, and held up very nicely.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, thanks for sharing. I followed another suggestion and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. The only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 was, as other users have said, it was a bit on the crumbly side, making it a bit messy to eat. Next time I will try the trick of soaking the corn meal in the milk to see if that resolves the issue. I might also add, I made these in muffin tins and 23 minutes at 400 was spot on.

This is an amazing recipe. It is so simple and the resulting corn bread is to die for. I was trying to replicate corn bread muffins i buy at a coffee shop and this recipe did just that. I made this recipe as muffins so I adjusted the temperature i baked them at to 300 degrees and the length of time i bake them for to 20 minutes. I've made this recipe 3 times so far in the last couple of weeks and will surely keep making it many more times.

Excellent corn bread!! I took the advice of some previous reviews and cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, but I would have liked it just a little bit sweeter. Next time I think I'll keep the recipe as is.

My husband had never eaten cornbread before, so I searched to find a receipe that was close to what my mom use to make when I was a kid and found this one. Needless to say, it is made in my house almost every other day because my husband loves it!

These were great.  Only change I made was to cut down on the sugar (I used only 1/2 cup).  Perfect!  Also, made in muffin pan.  I did not find them crumbly at all like some stated.   I served these with a pot of chili.  Will made these again for sure.

This is a very good, sweet cornbread recipe. I always follow the recipe exactly, but usually have to bake it closer to 25 minutes. The only dislike I have is the texture seems to be a bit crumbly for my liking, but my other half has deemed it to be perfect.

We LOVED this! I had to leave it in the oven with the heat turned off for about 20 mins. and that actually turned out to be a good thing. The top turned golden and the sides pulled away from the pan which gave it a nice, close texture. Not too dense either. Hubby wants to toast it for breakfast. I'm gonna have to cut the sugar slightly next time, (just a smidge too sweet for me), but otherwise, awesome recipe. :o)

They were crumblier than I would have liked but they tasted good. I was hoping for something sweeter but I liked how they turned out. I would make them again but I'm still on the search for sweet, moise, less crumbly cornbread. I made them by following the recipe exactly.

The first time I made this, my husband told me to save the recipe and never lose it. Not too thick and moist, but not too crumbly either, he says -and I agree. I'd been looking for a recipe that I could get right (for some reason, all the other cornbread recipes I tried came out disastrous), and this really makes the grade.

Roommate left me a note saying "OMG best cornbread ever!" I cut down the sugar to less than 1/2 cup and added a few tablespoons of honey.  I also realized too late that I didn't have any vegetable oil, and used melted butter instead. Seemed to turn out great anyway!

My family loves this recipe. I cut the sugar in half, as that is my preference and they turned out great. Making in mini muffin form for my son's class today. Just baked for 10 minutes and perfectly golden.

I've made this cornbread several times. I LOVE IT AS IS. But for fun, if I have canned corn available, I add 1/2 Cup. I like it with the 1/3 white sugar and 1/3 brown sugar as suggested by another. This recipe is incredibly easy to make and remember if I need to make it on the fly.

Just made this tonight for the first time and it was fabulous!!! Actually it's the best cornbread I have ever made. I didn't have cornmeal, but I did have polenta which is just a coarser grind. I finely ground it in my vitamix blender and used it. Yum! I baked my cornbread in a convection oven. It came out wonderfully crisp on the outside and sweet and moist on the inside. This will now be my "go to" cornbread recipe.

This is delicious!  My daughter kept complimenting me as if this was my recipe.  Quick and simple to make.  I will probably use less sugar but I don't think my family would enjoy it as much.

I was out of butter so I tried this recipe and I thought it had a pretty good flavor.  It was a little crumbily but I will make it again and maybe add alittle sour cream.

I was looking for a good sweet cornbread to go with a beef-and-bean chili recipe. I was skeptical of this recipe at first, because some of the reviews described it as "cake-like" and, being a Southern gal, I prefer a firm, "crisp" cornbread. Well, I'm a convert now. This is the only cornbread I'll ever make. It's the perfect combination of firm and delicate, and just melts in your mouth.

Absolutely awesome cornbread!  We are diabetic so instead of using white sugar I used 1/3 cup splenda and 1/3 cup of wheylow.  I also replaced the white flour with Prairie Gold Wheat flour.  Thank you so much for posting this!

Excellent recipe. Very quick, nice crumb. I double it and use a 9x13' pan for potlucks. It's gone in the first few minutes, especially if it's still warm, lol. Cook for about 35-40 minutes depending on your oven. Sometimes I use honey instead of sugar, but not often, makes it too irresistable.

I had lost my recipe for cornbread, and this matches the taste and texture.  I like it a little on the sweet side and this is perfect, didn't change a thing, just made muffins instead of the bread, this time, worked great.

I made this for a going away party and everyone, especially my cousin who ate almost 1/2 of it, LOVED it. 
I read some of the other reviews and used 1/3c brown & 1/3c white sugar in addition to 1/3c powdered milk + 1c water for the 1c milk (I was curious as to what it'd taste like because I wasn't sure if I had powdered milk or creamer haha). 
When I was mixing up the wet ingredients my 4yo & 5yo were eating the sugar so I added (probably, I eyeballed it) about another 1/4c or so of white sugar to replace what they had 'sampled'. 
Since I was making it for a crowd I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13, baked at 400 for 35min, although 30min would have been a little better since the top was a little browner than I would have liked.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it has wonderful flavor and texture, and although my first attempt did not come out perfectly, it was because of what I did to it.  First off, I used agave nectar (¼ c) instead of sugar; also used sifted bread flour instead of regular white flour (both because of dietary restrictions).  In addition I cut the baking powder to 2t per some reviews.  The only problem I had was that it didn't rise as tall as I would have expected, and that may have been because of the bread flour.  Anyway, this recipe is a definite keeper!  I will be making this again, using the full amount of baking powder.

I have made this again, this time substituting ½ cup honey mesquite flour for ¼ cup of the cornmeal and ¼ cup of the flour.  That makes a great recipe even better.  The mesquite adds sweetness to the cornbread so ? cup of sugar was plenty.  If you want mesquite flour you can find it online - it's a bit expensive, but worth it (I cheat - we have 2 honey mesquite trees and I make my own flour).

Very good and easy recipe. I tried a little variation. I used 1/2 c. all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. And also used 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil. I used 1% milk. I think it turned out very well. It was moist.

This makes a good cornbread but honestly I think the sweet cornbread recipe on the side of the corn meal box is much better. This was a little too salty, which seemed strange.  Maybe due to the large amount of baking powder.

I have a similar recipe that I make as muffins and my kids love it. I too use a mix or white sugar and brown sugar, but then I add a teaspoon of vanilla. For just a bit more flavor, I decrease the sugar to a half a cup total and then when the muffins are still hot I brush them with a mix of melted butter, a teaspoon of brown sugar and a half a teaspoon of vanilla. You could also use honey or maple syrup.

Good recipe, but i prefer a little less sugar and the substitution of sour cream for milk.  Also, sometimes add 1 can of chopped green chilis to give it a kick.

I made this recipe using all organic ingredients and it was AMAZING! My family asks me to make it all the time. I'm trying to make it vegan tonight for my little brother who is in town....I'll have to update and let you know how that works.

Just made this recipe as cornbread muffins and it was easily one of the best cornbread muffins I've ever eaten... and I know my cornbread! Also I used Gluten-Free all purpose flour, and it worked just perfectly! As others suggested, I cut the sugar to 1/2C but everything else I kept the same. Baked them at 400 for about 16 minutes. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I like this recipe. It's quick and yummy. I replace vegatable oil with bacon fat but I guess that is just my mom's southern side coming out in me. All in all good.

I love cornbread! I grew up in the south yet no one in my family EVER made cornbread from scratch -- it was always the boxed Jiffy mix (which I love!) So this was my first recipe on my own. I used unbleached white wheat flour as well as olive oil in place of veggie. The only thing I changed was the sugar amount (I used ~1/2 c) but I could've gone with the whole 2/3 c. Overall, it tasted very good. It was more crumbly than I usually like but I chalk that up to the olive oil (?). I'll definitely make this again!

This is the BEST cornbread! I used to add extra oil and sugar to the box mix TRYING to get this flavor and texture, but this is quicker and easier and better.

It took me about five minutes to mix up the batter, and then I poured it into a scorching hot cast iron skillet and baked for about fifteen minutes. It was moist, sweet (more like cake than southern cornbread) and had perfect crust and crumb.

This is SWEET. You'll hate it if you like a more traditional southern cornbread, but for this yankee with a sweet tooth it's THE perfect recipe.

The recipe itself is good but I find it too sweet for my taste so I reduce the amount of sugar by half. Otherwise no complaints. Very quick and easy to make.

This is a very good recipe.  I only used 1/2 c of sugar, which was plenty and I have a sweet tooth.  I made this using a brown rice flour mix to make it gluten free.  I added a 1/2 t of xantham gum.  Came out great.

This is by far the BEST cornbread recipe I have ever made! Simply Amazing! I had to adjust the oven temp and time accordingly (390 temp and 18mins). I served it with my homemade gumbo. The only thing I added was a little over 1/4th tsp of organic  Pure Orange Extract. Thanks for the most excellent recipe!!

Great basic recipe. Fantastic texture. Made with butter in place of oil. 2/3 cup total sweetener, but used 1/6 c honey, and rest was 1/2 sugar, 1/2 splenda. Used buttermilk instead of milk. Cooked in cast iron skillet, heated in the oven ahead, then wiped with butter flavored crisco to grease, poured in batter and cooked at 400F for 16 min. Will use this as my go-to cornbread-perfectly sweet and easily adaptable to a sweeter or less sweet version dependent on how much honey/sugar you use.

This was a Very tasteful cornbread. I made a few changes I added fresh sweet corn that I blended in the blender. Instead of oil I used melted butter. I also cut down on the sugar to a little less than 1/2 cup. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. It was a great recipe from the start.
THANK YOU

I loved this recipe. But one day I didn't have an egg so I used 1/4 cup of Mayo. I will never go back to using an egg in this again. The cornbread turns out so wonderfully moist and delicious using mayo.

This is now my standard cornbread recipe. Absolutely great with chili or any time. I cook it in a 9" round cake pan then slice into triangles. 

When I have fresh honey on hand I usually add a couple tablespoons in leu of a couple tablespoons of the sugar and cut back a tad on the milk. 

Still trying to figure out how to make this recipe just a tad moister. Adding extra egg just makes it dense. Otherwise, we love it.

Flavor was great, but it came out more cake-like and less gritty/cornbread-like. Also cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup as suggested.

I used only 3 tsp. baking powder to make it less fluffy and more dense. Also substituted white flour to 50/50 wheat and white flour. We all love it so much that there rarely is much left for breakfast w/milk! yum!

This is by far the best cornbread I have ever made.  I usually make my great grandmothers skillet cornbread, but one night my husband and I got to craving a sweeter cornbread and I found this recipe.  It is the only one I've made since.  I even tried it as a skillet version last week, still as amazing as ever!!!

This is my favorite cornbread recipe! I've also done it with whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, honey instead of sugar (following the guidelines here: https://www.thekitchn.com/4-rules-for-successfully-swapping-honey-for-sugar-in-any-baked-goods-230156), and olive oil instead of vegetable (for the hubby, who was on a diet). It was still good, but it's definitely better as written. My kids gobble this up!

We used whole wheat flour and it worked really well. A little overly sweet and a little crumbly but we liked it overall.

Delicious:)) This has got to be the best cornbread i have ever tasted! It's that good. I'm not a big fan of cornbread, or i wasn't until i cooked this. It is super good; moist with a just enough sweetness to it. I will never make another kind of cornbread now that i have made this one. I will be cooking this on a regular basis:) Thanks for the recipe...

I replaced the vegetable oil with melted butter, and I think the taste was superior with this substitution. Otherwise this is a great recipe.

Yuck! What a gloppy mess! I made a beautiful coffee cake this morning, so there's no trouble with my oven. **If** I would ever consider trying this recipe again, I would use a 9" square pan.

I absolutely love this recipe. I've never been much of a cornbread eater, but this recipe is irresistible. My father loves it to pieces. I have no complaint, or anything to add. Any thing that I found wrong with the cornbread was my fault, and I'll work on improving in the future. Happy cooking =D

Made this recipe because I need cornbread for my Christmas dinner(cornbread stuffing).  I made it with whole-wheat flour, white cornmeal(that's what I have, I use it to make Kenyan Ugali), used half white sugar and half honey granules to make 2/3 cup,  a bit less oil than 1/3 cup(ran out of it).  It turned out very nice and moist indeed.  I am very pleased, I would make it again.  Next time I'll try incorporating corn, butter, buttermilk...etc.

This is now the only recipe I use for cornbread.  We like it on the sweet side so it's perfect for our family.  We travel around the world and often I have only a coffee cup and teaspoon for measuring and this recipe still comes out beautifully.  Thanks!!

This cornbread was just ok. It was a little on the bland side, maybe fresh corn would improve the situation.

This recipe is wonderful and easy to make! I was missing several ingredients... I didn't have baking powder so i substituted it with 1 & 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 cup sour cream; no egg was added; I added 3/4 can of corn. And this turned out sooooo good! YUM!

Awesome!   So easy and quick.  It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't obnoxiously crumbly.  I added a little shredded cheddar cheese and a 1/2 cup of corn kernels.  Baked it in a preheated cast iron skillet.  Delicious!  I will definitely be using this recipe again whenever I have a cornbread craving.

It was delicious! Right amount of sweet. I replaced the oil with butter to add more flavor. Just made this last night and it saved my behind from the bland chili I made along with it. Would like to find out how to make it more moist and find an alternative to all that white sugar which made me feel guilty.

Simple and wonderful. I bake the batter as muffins too. Taking other reviewers' advice, I cut the sugar to 1/2 c. (enough even for my serious sweet tooth) and up the oil to 1/2 c. I've also used it as a topping for tamale pie (I cut the sugar even further to about 1/4 c.).

BEST CORNBREAD RECIPE EVER!!!  This recipe is FABULOUS!!! I used wheat flour for the white flour and canola oil in place of the veg oil to experiment with making it just that much healthier and it is sooooo light and fluffy!!! I was afraid they would be a little dry form the wheat flour, but they were PERFECT! I made 12 corn muffins and they were HUGE...I could have actually gotten about 18 from this recipe honestly, but I like how big they turned out!! This is my NEW cornbread recipe, with the substitutions!!!

Family loved this. I added a teeny bit more oil to make it more cake-like and less crumbly.  This was my first time not using a mix and it was so easy I feel stupid for using mixes for so long, especially since it was so much yummier!

Wonderful and delicious!! I made this into muffins, the recipe made a dozen muffins. For extra crispness I use ½ cup of finely grained corn flour and ½ cup of coarse grained corn flour. Everybody in my house loved them! I will definitely do them again!

Excellent and simple.  I used buttermilk and melted butter instead of milk and oil.  I baked in a pyrex dish and glazed it with a melted butter/honey/salt mixture.

My family taste tested 3 cornbread recipes from this site.  Both my boys liked this one best.  For me it came in second, just because I think the other one was a bit healthier.  This was a great recipe & super easy to make.

It tasted a little bit sour. I didnt have any regular milk at home so I substituted it with Silk Soymilk. Maybe thats why...=( Hard to master it in owen because outer piece of the bread was welldone and the middle was still gooey. The edges tasted better than the middle part.  Wasent as sweet as I had expected... But it was ok.  You definetely need a good, salty buttery butter to this and it will work out fine!

Thought this was a very sweet & delicious cornbread.  Yes, it is more like cake & YES it is sweet! If you don"t care for a sweeter cornbread, then don't make it...simple as that.  So many people have complained that it is too sweet.  All you have to do is look at the recipe title to figure that out.

This was nice. A little more liquidy (when mixed) than other cornbread recipes.   To make vegan-version, use Silk (soymilk) in place of milk, use closer to 2.5/3 teaspoons of baking powder and omit the egg. I also used soybean oil and it can out divine! My vegan-recipe-hating-fiance had more than his fair share of this!

Very sweet cornbread which me and my husband both liked.  I followed one reviewers suggestion by using half brown sugar and half white sugar, and adding a tsp of vanilla.  It's not getting 5 star because of how crumbly it was.  One reviewer said adding more oil would make it less crumbly, but it didn't work for me.  I did forget to soak the cornbread, so next time I'll be trying that.

Love this recipe. Followed exactly and used over cheese and ground turkey for a "shepherd" pie...it was the best cornbread I've tasted. Can't wait to try as cornbread muffins by itself now! Will not use boxed again. Thank you so much!

I made this for a 4th of July potluck yesterday after reading the reviews. It was tasty but not amazing. In the recipes defense, I took the suggestion to cut the sugar a little bit. I think if I make it next time I will try the recipe the way it is originally written and see if that makes it better. I gave it 5 stars because it was good and easy to make.

Easy and delicious!  I cut the sugar to 1/2 c and substituted some of the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also added ground cardamon for a bit of exotic flavor.  Will make this again!

I mixed half white and half light brown sugar and substituted Himalayan pink salt for regular table salt to give it a little tang.  The flavour was great, but it was a little dry.

This is REALLY good, and super easy. I made one slight modification. I used 1/3 white sugar, and 1/3 splenda. I didn't have veggie oil, so I used canola.

Delicious...I substituted Splenda for the sugar and added a couple of tablespoons of honey.  This is definitely my favorite cornbread recipe I have tried to date.

I made this without any changes to the recipe and it turned out wonderful! I did bake it in a muffin pan for 12-15 minutes. This is the only time I've been able to make cornbread... I've tried a few other times and it was horrible but this recipe I've made 3 times already and it's perfect for us :)

This was a great and easy cornbread recipe.  To make it a little healthier, I used whole wheat flour and cut sugar down to 1/3 a cup.

REALLY GOOD!  I couldn't find my standard cornbread recipe (which is a Marie Callendar's copy) so I searched the site for something else that looked good.  I made them into muffins and they were light, moist, sweet & delicious.  I will definitely make them again, thanks!

Super easy recipe as I love cornbread taste better than regular cake. Sometimes I will make the cornbread (cut-down sugar) as "cupcake" and dress it up with chocolate raisins, coconut meringue, raspberry sauce, etc... etc...

Love this recipe - it's easy to knock off in a hurry when I need bread for dinner!  And, everyone likes it, too.    My substitutions include butter-flavored crisco instead of vegetable oil & soy milk instead of cow's milk (we have a milk allergy in the house).  I also use some brown sugar in place of the white sugar most of the time.  Every once in a while, I'll add some frozen sweet corn to the batter before cooking, as well.

This was very good.  I like the taste but wanted it to be a bit more dense and moist and a little less crumbly.  Really good though.

Excellent!  LOVE this recipe.  For spiciness, throw some jarred jalapenos on top.  I do a non-dairy version with rice milk.  Comes out great every time.  Thanks this recipe is a keeper!

I made this recipe for cornbread to go with the pot of chili I had made, but instead of cooking it in a regular pan round or square I made it in a star shaped silicone pan so each point could be a cut slice...I don't know if it was the silicone or what but I set my oven to cook for 25 min like the recipe calls for 20-25 min...and it was not long enough. It looked done and the toothpick came out clean, but when I flipped it onto a plate to cut and serve just under the crust ontop was still sticky and the botton was still doughy and was still really light in the center the edges looked great and crunchy...so I put the cornbread in for another 10 minutes and it was completely baked through...so if you have a convection oven and use a silicone pan, set your time for at least 35 minutes and definately do the toothpick check...but in the end the taste test was great my family enjoyed it very much...I made the recipe as is did not add a thing but I did soak the cornmeal for a bit...thank you

delicious and SO fast and easy to make! I subbed rice milk for regular milk and corn flour for wheat and it turned out absolutely fabulous. I plan to make this in large batches in the future. Thanks for a great recipe!

Superb!  My family LOVED this!  It is a bit crumbly though.  Easily the moistest cornbread I've ever had!

I only used 1/3 cup sugar and it was still pretty sweet.  It turned out pretty crumbly, albeit delicious, so next time I'll probably use less flour too.

I've made this as listed and with only 1/2 c sugar, per other reviews.  Both ways are great; I didn't find it too sweet with the 2/3 c of sugar; it's really just a matter of personal preference.  Either way you go, this cornbread tastes wonderful and looks so perfect when you take it out of the oven.  I served it at a dinner party and my friends were so impressed that I made it from scratch...little did they know that it's so easy to make!

I like a really sweet cornbread so this recipe was just what I was looking for.I made it exactly as written and my husband and I both loved it.I've made it several times already and it's delicious with my chili and different soups.This last time I made it I cooked it in my cast iron skillet which I preheated in the oven first.It gave it a nice crispy crust which was perfect.I love the fact that this cornbread is so simple to make and it uses oil insead of butter. No more Jiffy box mix for me!

Great cornbread!  Even my 2 year old and very picky 7 year old ate it.  That's called success in my book.

There weren't enough good words to describe this cornbread when I made it.  I used 1/3 cup powdered milk and 1 cup water as someone else suggested instead of the milk.  I also made a double batch so we would have leftovers.  It is as good the second day cold as it was the first day warm.  Yum!

Made this for my family and the kids said it was "the best ever"  =  We do not buy the mix in boxes anymore!   :) It is a sweet cornbread; I loved it and I didn't use butter at all on these.

By far the best sweet cornbread I have ever tasted! I made no changes to the recipe at all and have made it several times very successfully. I will maybe cut the sugar down next time just a tad to save calories, but its fantastic as it is!

The best sweet cornbread recipe I've come across in a long time.  I added just a little less sugar and increased my oil slightly as one reviewer did and they are delicious!!!!!  Made corn muffins.  Quick, easy.  Will never buy another box of corn muffin mix.

Wow! Made as recipe reads but I did let the oil overflow when pouring in.  Great flavor - nice & sweet. The only thing that could make it better would be a bit more moisture but we loved it! Made as 4 mini loaves and cooked for 21 mins (could've probably pulled out a bit earlier)

I grew up with mom making cornbread in a jiffy out of a little blue box. i never realized how bad it tasted until i grew up and didn't drown it in butter and honey. I was delighted to find this recipe to be easy and scrumdiddlyumptious. My wife and my 5yo went crazy for it.

Just the sweetness and texture that I expect from cornbread.  Couldn't resist sneaking a piece before I served it with Vikki's Red Bean Sausage from AR.  I think I'll have a piece of the cornbread for dessert, too!

A slightly sweet, light and textured bread.  Easy recipe is a fast favorite. I substituted 1/2c coarse corn meal and 1/2c corn flour for 1c of corn meal.

This is a great foil to a spicy soup or chili. I substituted about 1/3 of the sugar for honey (homegrown!) for a different sweetness. I think next time I'll cut the total amount of sugar as well, because this was *almost* (very almost) too sweet. I also lowered the baking powder to 2 tsp, since I like a denser cornbread.

I am not always a fan of corn bread, but I made this when I made a batch of chili.  It was wonderful!

This is the best sweet cornbread I've ever eaten.  I've tried every boxed mix there is and never liked any of them.  This is simple to make and I'll never buy a mix again.

This is a great recipe.  Moist, light, fluffy, with a good crust, and definitely sweet.  This is now my favorite corn bread recipe.

I prefer sweeter cornbreads so I thought it was very yummy...will try adding cranberries to it the next time.  Also, this is a very simple & quick recipe which is a bonus!

I am making cornbread for Thanksgiving and I have never made it from scratch before.  Decided to do a taste test with Krustaez, Jiffy, Buttery Corn Bread (from all recipes) and this recipe.  I made them all in to muffins and the Krusteaz and Jiffy don't compare to this recipe.  I liked the other recipe too, but I would give this one 6 stars!!  Nice heavy muffin, the way I like them, and oh so good.  Also a big plus is that it is soooooo easy to make!  No more box mixes for me...only this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!

I love, love, LOVE this cornbread! It's so easy to make and goes great with chili. I especially love it because it's made of ingredients I always have on hand (I keep yellow cornmeal in stock just for this). Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!

This is a great standard cornbread recipe. I'm pretty sure it is the same as used to be on the Quaker box for many years which I have tried to find periodically. Recent recipes have had too much flour to cornmeal ratio.

This is delicious and sweet; just what I was looking for.  I've had problems in the past with crumbly cornbread, so I added about 50% more oil.  I made muffins instead of a whole pan and they turned out perfect.

Love it, love it, love it! If you like Jiffy, you'll love this recipe. My husband said he didn't eat anything but Jiffy. Well, we ran out. So, I pulled up this recipe; cooked it and fed it to him. Guess what? He didn't know until I told him. Guess what else? Now he asks me for the recipe so that he can make cornbread. This is a really great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I made muffins and they were delicious!  Cut a little on the sugar the first time, but used the whole amount the second plus some honey and they were just the way we like.  A little crumbly, will continue to work on the oil for that, but overall great recipe.

I have only ever made the corn bread recipe from the box and this one is MUCH better. Tastes like the sweet corn bread you'd get at a restaurant and you can whip it up in no time! I made mine into muffins and caught my beau sneaking one before bedtime they were so good :)

I am from the States, but now live in Canada where it is hard to get some good cornbread. My family and I have tried numerous recipes but all turned out flat. This was excellent!!! My youngest daughter has not stopped eating it. It was a hit in our family. Thank you for the great recipe!!!

Better than when I make corn bread with Crisco.  I don't like it too sweet, so I only put 1/4 cup of sugar.

This recipe is fantastic! I subbed whole wheat flour and you would never know it except for the color. Thank you!

Excellent recipe!  The original recipe is sweet and moist and very tasty.  I make a few alterations, however.  I substitute whole wheat flour for the white, which makes the bread a little more filling and adds fiber.  I also use dark brown sugar instead of white.  I find this enhances the flavor while keeping the sweetness of the bread.  I use safflower oil specifically, because I like it's lack of flavor and that extra kick of vitamin E.  This might sound strange for those not accustomed to whole wheat, but once you're used to the flavor it's hard to go back to regular white flour!

This recipe was good.  I did add a little vanilla.  My husband said he thought it was Jiffy muffins.  We like Jiffy muffins and these do taste a lot like them, but I was hoping for better.  I felt insulted that he thought they were Jiffy.

I have made this cornbread several times now and just noticed that I had not reviewed it previously. This is a delicious, sweet, light cornbread. I like it sweet so I use a rounded 2/3 cup of sugar, a smidge more salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla. I don't use vegetable oil at all, always canola and I use an extra tablespoon for added moisture. I bake it in a dark non-stick 9" x 9" square pan so I lower the temperature to 375 and add 3 - 5 minutes. The result is terrific.

I'm not a cook by any means but this was excellent - I surprised my husband. My first homemade cornbread was perfect.  I might try it with less sugar next time - just for the sake of having less sugar, this was good the way the recipe says though too.

Amazing! seriously a favourite in my house now. I did tweak slightly, but not much. I took the sugar down to 130g (too sweet otherwise), the salt to 4g and the baking powder down to 10/11g. I also used 80g of melted butter instead of oil - makes the cornbread very moist and fluffy. Also just before putting into the oven i sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar on top. It bakes just below the the surface but remains crunchy so when you bite into it, it adds a nice texture... Deffo more of a dessert in our house but fantastic all the same!

This is the best cornbread I've had in a long time. I had been using the recipe on the Quaker Corn Meal can, and the cornbread was too dry for me. So my husband ate them. My buttermilk had spoiled, so I decided on this recipe because it didn't require buttermilk.   I made it per the recipe except for a couple of modifications. I had only 1/4 cup of corn meal left in the can after I measured the 1 cup. So I poured it in. I also add 1/4 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of sugar as suggested by other reviewers, and used 1 tsp of baking powder, and omitted the baking soda.  This recipe is a keeper. The extra corn meal add a little texture which I like. The corn bread is also moist, sweet, and light.

UPDATE: I made these again, and added a cup of cheese to it. It tasted a lot better with the cheese.
08/04/09:These were good. I can't say they were great. My friends said that they were good, but my sister only liked it after a day I made them. It was a nice and easy recipe though! Thanks!

This cornbread's stellar as it stands. I've made it twice following the recipe, and I've yet to get a complaint. In fact, people go back for seconds. I was concerned about it being too sweet, but it actually works out for me. I did alter the recipe though, which might have cut off some of the sweetness. So, in my version, I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil (don't have any in my house) and buttermilk for my milk (personal choice). It wasn't too sweet at all.  Also, the crumbliness is a slight problem, but there's a really easy solution to that: let it cool. Give the cornbread like a 15 minute cool out of the oven in the pan, and it won't crumble on you. You'll get nice wedges like in the photo.

Waaaaaaaaay too sweet, and I like sweet cornbread! I also had to reduce the baking powder to 2tsp because 3 1/2 gave it a bitter taste. Otherwise, pretty good once those two things are reduced.

Yummy for your tummy. This recipe sings to our souls. I'm using it for my parents and aunt to try this Sunday. My babys already gave it the GREAT seal of APPROVAL.

VERY good cornbread - not too sweet and not to bland.  I baked in a cupcake pan without paper cups.  They turned out great and we enjoyed having leftovers.

This was the best corn bread recipe I have found! I made individual mini loafs instead of 1 large pan. My kids and hubby loved it! I did too! I followed the recipe exactly.

I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup like some reviews suggested, and wished I hadn't. Oh well, now I know it won't be too sweet for me prepared as written. Still quite tasty even as I made it this time--nice and light!

Simple, basic sweet cornbread.  Fast and so easy!  I made a half portion of the recipe for me and my hubby and it turned out great!  I served it with chili on one night, and with strawberry jam for brunch the morning after.  Yum!

This is the best cornbread recipe I have found in a long time. Just plain old cornbread: moist, slightly sweet, texture is good.  This goes great with fresh vegtables.

A huge hit!  I made this recipe for a large chili dinner party last weekend. I actually tripled the ingredients & baked it in a large shallow (greased) aluminum pan I had purchased at a party-goods store.   I omitted half the sugar and used corn meal we bought on vacation from a true grist mill.  It was SO delicious!  I am not very good at baking and it came out perfect!!!!  Everyone raved about it.

The best!! Doesn't look like it's done coming out of the oven, so don't be deceived and let it cook to long. Wonderful taste and texture. Crumbly,but not too much. It did not stay on the plate long! Yummy.

Wow!!!! is a understatement. I usually use Jiffy Mix because my kids like the sweetness, it's quick and my cornbread usually is dry.I didnt wanna run out to the store so I decided to see if there was a recipe for Sweet Cornbread and I lucked up on this one. I had all of the ingredients except baking powder so I left it out completely and used my self rising flour hoping for the best. I thought that it would turn out bad like all of my other attempts to make "homemade cornbread" but even with my substitution the Bread was great. Thanks so very much for sharing.

This is a great sweet cornbread to serve with a soups or stews or just by itself. It needs to cool before cutting or it will fall apart when you slice it in half. spread with real butter and this cornbread is out of this world

Yummy! My 2 y.o. who doesn't eat anything & my 6 y.o. who is so picky was scarfing this down!! Did use just 2 tsp of baking powder, as suggested, and baked it in my grandmother's handed down cast iron skillet. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!!

Wow. I"m usually very very picky with sweet cornbread recipes, but this one took the cake -- literally and figuratively :)  I had my apprehensions making this recipe because when I tasted the batter, it was too sour (probably from the baking powder).  When it baked, the sourness dissipated to reveal a very sweet and very moist cornbread.  I baked it in an 8x8 pyrex and came out fabulous.  I'd make this again.  Great for Thanksgiving and with a roasted chicken dinner. Thank you for sharing.

This was pretty good but was not well received by the rest of the family. I think mostly because they just do not like the grainy texture. It was very sweet and more like a cake than any cornbread I have ever had.

This was very good and my family really enjoyed it. I lowered the sugar to just 1/3 cup. I substituted whole wheat bread flour for the all purpose flour. With these changes I know I'll make it again!

This is my new Cornbread recipe. I love sweet. If you are more of salty person then you may want to cut back on the sugar. I also took some advice and only put in 2 tsp of Baking powder. Thanks for sharing!

I made only one change to this recipe and that was to only add 1 T baking powder (3 t).  My cornbread came out light, fluffy, sweet and moist.  I baked in a 9 in clay Pampered Chef baker (pretty close to using a cast iron skillet) which I greased liberally with shortening and placed in the oven while it was preheating.  I convection baked it at 400 degrees and it was beautifully golden.  (I'm not sure how long it baked.)  I wish I had taken a picture of it; it was that beautiful!  I saw one commenter said it wasn't cornbread, it was a cornmeal cake and I kind of agree with that, but I don't think that makes it bad at all--just different.  I have always preferred unsweetened cornbread but I really did enjoy this variation and I thank you for the recipe.  You can bet we'll be making this one time and again.

Update 10/25/10:  This continues to be THE ONLY cornbread I will make.  My husband is now VERY  disappointed when I make something from a package :o)  Perfect just as it is!  Easily doubled with no problems too--bake in a 9x13 pan.  Works great in cornbread stuffing too!

This is THE best cornbread.  It is the only one I will make.  Occasionally, I have to make one from a package, but if I have a few minutes, I don't mind making this one.  I sometimes have to double the recipe for a 9x13 pan........and it never lasts in our house!

Absolutely heavenly!!  My husband ate 1/2 the pan.  : )  The only change I made was to reduce the baking powder to 3 teaspoons, otherwise I followed the recipe.  I also baked this in a 9x9 glass pan, and it came out moist, and a beautiful golden brown color after 22 minutes.  No one in my family wanted to put butter on it - they all said it was too good by itself.  Even so, next time I think I will take the advice of other reviewers and make some honey butter to go with this delicious cornbread.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

HUGE hit in my house. This is how cornbread should be. I did take the reviewers advice and added more oil to make it more moist I also added 1 tbs of honey. 

I get rave reviews when I make this for potlucks, goes great with chili.

Very good recipe.  I have made this cornbread for years.  Only 1/3 cup of sugar though, and I like to use 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour.  Gives it a nutty crunchy kind of flavor.  Great Recipe.

Great cornbread! I've made this 3 times now and it is officially my go-to cornbread recipe. You can make it sweeter or less sweet. If you really want to make it sing, cut the white sugar a little and add about a TB of honey (no more) to the wet ingredients, then blend it all together. The flavor is subtle and yet somehow amazing.

Sweet, moist and absolutely the best cornbread I've ever made. This is way better than the jiffy mix, and pretty easy to put together. You'll want to make sure there's some on the house all winter long. It's perfectly paired with coffee.

This recipe has been a hit in my own home as well as at my friends' houses. I do suggest cutting the salt in 1/2. I've also found that it's easier to bake/serve the cornbread if it's baked in muffin tins. I don't even bother with the paper cups. I just use cooking spray and they come out great!

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  I took others advice & added a tbsp of white vinegar.  I was also cooking for my parents & they don't care as much for the sweet cornbread so I only added about 1/4 cup of sugar.  They loved it!  It turned out perfectly.  This recipe is a keeper!

I live in Southern North Carolina, and I must say, growing up in the south- Cornbread is a major staple of the foods here. This cornbread was the BEST I have ever had. I love sweet cornbread, and this recipe was spectacular. I will definitely use this again.

This was a HIT!! my house! Had a family gathering with chilli and salad and everyone raved about this bread. They all loved the cakey texture and the fact that it had just the right "sweetness" to it. I baked it in cast iron skillets (doubled the recipe)and I had to adjust for cooking time a little bit, but it came out GREAT!! This is a keeper for sure!!

I actually followed this recipe exactly which is rare for me. I doubled it and expected  that it would be like a cornbread cupcake because of the "too sweet" reviews but it was just fine. It is supposed to be sweet!! So It shouldn't too sweet if you're used to sweet cornbread waAllahu alim.

Only 4 stars because I don't consider myself to be a Cornbread Connaisseur.  However, this recipe was well received by local church members when I prepared it for them in a Dutch oven.  One other mention:  this would be wonderful as a pastry topping for a mexican/tamale pie.

I made 12 large muffins out of this recipe.  The only thing I altered from the recipe was adding about a cup of corn and that was the perfect amount.  The muffins were tasty, but a tad bit dry.

This was fabulous.  I subbed in soy milk and made some adjustments as per earlier recommendations: slightly more salt and oil, slightly less baking powder.  25 mins was the perfect baking time.

This is wonderful corn bread and sooo easy to make!!!  I used olive oil b/c I didn't have veg oil and I used 1% milk.  Very tasty and sweet. It took a little longer to cook than the recipe called for, but all turned out well.

I wish I had read reviews previously and decreased the amount of sugar.  It was too sweet for my taste, but my husband loved it.  Instead of oil, I used applesauce and baked them as little mini-muffins in the toaster oven.  My husband was eating them by the handful.

I made this 2 weeks ago and used a few of the changes some of the reviewers suggested and it was just awesome. I grew up in Texas and haven't had good corn bread since moving away until I made this recipe.  I will be making this many more times. I used a little less baking powder than the original recipe and I still found it to be too fluffy, so I plan on using even less the next time and also using more cooking oil.

I always have missed the cornbread my grandma used to make; couldn't find a recipe that was even close; somehow always found thime somewhat lacking...  Until now, that is!  This is a beautiful recipe for those who like sweet cornbread.  Did double the recipe and add half a teaspoon vanilla extract; but otherwise; kept it exactly how it was.  Was great as a kids helping recipe; too; as you can just stir it all in one bowl; don't have alot of steps; and the kids can stir it as much as they want and it doesn't affect the results at all.  Served it with some sweetened cream beat until quite stiff (not to butter; but just before it starts to change texture a bit); a good dallop on top when just out of the oven...  Divine!

My favorite cornbread yet.  Even my mom took the recipe to replace our old family recipe.  I did add a little extra oil to keep it from being crumbly.

I've made this several times and the only thing I would change is the amount of baking powder - I could taste it in one batch. Other than that very good - I've added cheddar cheese, cream cheese, corn, and jalapenos. Yummy!

This is the best cornbread that I have ever made! I halved the recipe, and keeping in mind that I halved it, I made the following changes: reduced sugar to 1/4 cup, still used 1 whole egg, used whole wheat flour, and increased oil to 1/4 cup. Very moist and perfect! Great with chili, but awesome on its own, too!

Very good recipe.  Light, fluffy and moist.  I followed CORBALEYSK's advise and used nonfat dry milk powder + 1 cup of water since I have 3 kids who devour my refrigerated milk and this turned out tasting great and didn't crumble.

This cornbread is awesome.  I didn't have vegetable oil and I read that someone used applesauce instead.  I researched it on the internet and decided to try it.  It turned out great.  I also cut down on the sugar as others suggested.  I only used 1/3c.  I followed the rest of the resipe exactly.  My cornbread was to crumbly at all.  My whole family LOVED it.

Really Good!  Sweet and not dry.  I melt butter and oil in a cast iron skillet and then pour the batter into the hot skillet and bake it.  The butter gives the crust a good flavor and the oil prevents the bread from sticking to the pan when turning it out.

Overall, this was a really good recipes.  I made muffins and they were just a little dry but I may have overcooked them so I'll definitely try it again.  Just the right amount of sweetness for us.  I used 2 eggs and buttermilk.

This was EXCELLENT! However, I changed it so much, I can't say I even made the original recipe, :P I only did 3/4 c cornmeal, due to reviewer sugg. I also reduced sugar to 1/3 and all I had was olive oil, so I fearfully used that instead, and then I added 1/4 cup applesauce. I also added a can of creamed corn. It ROCKED! I mean ROCKED! Did I mention it was good? :)

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be delicious as is.  I baked it in a Pampered Chef Deep Dish Baker and it came out perfect.  Let the bread sit a few minutes before cutting.  It will be firmer and less crumbly than if cut right out of the oven.

This cornbread was very tasty and easy to make. I ate a piece and my husband ate the rest in one day! As soon as he finished the last piece he asked when I was going to make it again. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 1/4 tsp salt, I forgot to add the vanilla as others suggested but it was perfect since we ate it with vegetarian chili.

This DID have a sweet flavor, but the consistency was pretty dry...maybe because it has more corn meal than the recipe I usually use.  Anyway, I think I'll go back to my old one.

Great flavor...tasted even better the next day. Crumbled so much though...I don't know what I did wrong. I also cut back on most the sugar...next time I'll add some.

I made this with about half the sugar and added some oil and it still tasted super sweet to me.  It was good and moist, but I think I like my cornbread with less sugar.

I do mine as cornbread muffins and they are fabulous.. reminds me of home :)  I have subbed applesauce for the oil (and reduced the sugar a tad) in the past and it still works out great.

I thought this recipe was great. I love sweet corn bread and it's hard to find a great recipe for it. I halfed the recipe and made it into muffins. I also used whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar (and used splenda), and used egg whites and they turned out great, and VERY healthy!

Very good! If you don't care for chunks of corn in your bread, this is a great recipe! The only change I made was using white corn meal instead of yellow because that was all I had on hand. I don't htink there is any difference in taste and it still looked "golden" when it came out of the oven. Perfect texture, perfect moisture, delicious! Dip it in a little honey and you have a perfect little snack!

This is a pretty good cornbread recipe. I had to increase my baking time a little. In my opinion it could use a tablespoon or so more sugar. Overall it goes nicely w/ a bowl of chili.

I've always wanted to try corn bread - this was my first attempt - we don't eat it much in Australia. Super easy to make, I preheated a cast iron fry pan in the oven and cooked it for 20 mins - turned out perfectly, brown all over. Used 2 eggs and 2 tsp baking powder with a little more oil - worked well and very tasty, will add a corn next time. Thanks

This is an awesome recipe for cornbread.  My tweaking - I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup Splends, used 2 eggs and used 6 Tbsps of meltted butter instead of vegetable oil.  After baking for about 23 minutes, I let it cool for about 8 minutes before cutting and it was perfect - each piece held together very well. I served this cornbread with homemade bean soup for lunch today.  A perfect combination!! No more store-bought cornbread mixes for me. This will be my standard cornbread recipe from now on!

We liked this...I did sub whole wheat flour and a bit of splenda and honey for the sugar.  I also reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp as others have reccomended. I think the original recipe would be even better as written although ours was still delish!

Good basic recipe - sweetness is perfect for those (like me) who like a middling sweet.

Definitely soak the cornmeal in milk 10 minutes prior, or use a finely ground meal.  

Added an extra egg to a doubled recipe, and the crumbling remained under control.

If you do one thing - decrease the baking powder!  I only added 3 tbsp instead of 3.5, and it still turned out too sour. I'll drop to 1 or 2 tsbp. only next time.

This was great cornbread.  I reduced the sugar and added a touch of Honey. I also reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp. Next time I will add a bit more oil like suggested by other so its not so crumble. I also used Medium grind cornmeal on accident so next time I will use fine ground or soak the medium ground to make it softer.

Awesome awesome recipe!  I had a group of 8 Tiger Cub Scouts make this recipe last night, each in their own 9x9 aluminum pan.  The boys mixed all the ingredients right in the pan, and they all came out great with minimal mess.  I am not a big cornbread fan, but I really liked this recipe!  My southerner husband has pretty much eaten all of the one my son made at scouts!  Thanks for the recipe!

Indeed the BEST!  I went ahead and added one can of cream corn. My goodness, it was delicious, my husband loved it! And that is a lot to say because he is a picky eater. I am so glad it turned out great! Loved it with coffee. Give it a try. Cosy

The was the best cornbread I've ever had. I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and soaked the cornmeal in the milk for 10 minutes first. I also can't eat gluten, so I substituted the Gluten Free Pantry French Bread Mix for the all purpose flour. Simply Delicious!

This had an ok flavor, but the texture is terrible! I added an extra egg as suggested by other reviews, still it was very crumbly. Couldn't even spread soft butter on it, it fell apart in my hand.

This is really moist! Wow. I used half & half instead of milk, and put it in a 9 x 13 baking dish, half with chunks of jalapeno poked into the batter, the other half with chucks of peach. Both were fantastic.

Almost what I'm looking for. A little dry and crumbly but great taste. I think next time I will try maybe another egg yolk to make it a little more moist and it should also help it stay together. Other then that it is a really fantastick corn bread.

Great cornbread!  It didn't crumble on me at all, like some of the other reviews mentioned.  I did use about 3/4 c. milk and 1/4 c. heavy cream for the liquid, and also I used a good ol' double-yolk egg (love that Farmers Market).  It reminded me of the cornbread muffins at Famous Dave's BBQ.

I used (3/4 cup sugar instead of 2/3 cup) (1/4 cup oil instead of 1/3 cup) 
and (3 tsp baking powder instead of 3 1/2 tsp.) It had either to much salt or to much baking powder, not sure which but there was something off. One hint: put your oil in your skillet and roll around to coat then pour into the batter and mix.

This is the best-tasting sweet cornbread recipe I have ever tried. I also ended up decreasing the baking powder to 2 tsp, and I occasionally substitute half and half or heavy cream for the milk if I have some left over. This will go in the family recipe book and stay there forever.

We just had this today with some chili. The flavor is really really nice. It was very very crumbly though. Maybe that was because I didn't have any yellow cornmeal so I used 2 cups of cornmeal flour instead. It wont go to waste though! Anyone have any suggestions on how to make cornbread more firm?

This is the best cornbread ever! The only way it could be better is if I knew how to keep it moist for the next day or a bit less crumbly. It would make putting butter on it much easier.

This was a very good cornbread. I added some frozen corn, jalepeno peppers and a little grated cheese! The middle was a little underdone but still pretty good. Went great with chili!

I make this all the time -- it's a family favourite! I do cut the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup, though -- personal preference. Thanks for the recipe.

Super yummy.  Kids love it so does the hubby.  I like that it is not too crumbly, others I have tried fall apart to easy while the kids try to eat it.

I thought this was good cornbread. I followed the recipe exactly, being that this was my first homemade cornbread from scratch. 4 stars for while it was good, it wasn't great. Kind of had a flour like after taste, but I still thought it was good. I will try a few other recipes, but this will be my fallback.

WOW! The best I have ever had; I added a touch of vanilla just to bring out the sweetness a bit more. Wonderful with butter, or add honey too like my kids did. A keeper!!

Yum!  This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's a little crumbly, but what cornbread isn't?  Pretty easy, too...my seven-year-old did most of the work.

This recipe would definitely appeal to someone with a sweet tooth . . . it’s more like corn cake than cornbread! Next time I think I’ll substitute some of the sugar for honey.

I was worried because I had to cook it much longer than directed and the edges looked burnt, but it was perfect! Sooo yummy...sweet, moist, with the edges just crispy enough.

I doubled this recipe to make 2 pans but did NOT double the sugar, and it still tasted great.  I figured why add the extra sugar if you don't need it?

I moved overseas from the states about a year ago and one of the things I missed was "Jiffy" corn bread. This taste amazingly simular but even better!!! Thank you so much you have a fill a huge need in my cravings from home. The only changes I made was to add less sugar, otherwise perfect as stated.

The best cornbread I've made!  The taste is just what I wanted, though I wanted it to be a bit denser.  This was really really crumbly, but still fairly moist.  I only gave it 4 stars b/c you can't give 4 1/2!

This recipe is wonderful, I made it with whole wheat flour and it turned out just as well as when I made it with white flour.  It's become mandatory on chili night.

Yummy!  Nice and sweet.  Good texture although I would like to see it a little less crumbly.  Perhaps I'll take the suggestion of adding a bit more oil.  Cook it at 375 as well.  Came out perfect.  Good looking, smelled and tasted great!

I have always liked this recipe, but tonight I baked it in an enamel-clad cast iron (Le Creuset) skillet...WOW!  It came out moist and tender as always, but the difference along the edges was astonishing -- very light and faintly crisp.  Addictive!  If you have such a pan, try it.

Best corn muffins ever!  I made muffins and it made 12 nice sized muffins.  I baked them at 375 for 13-15 minutes and they were just perfect!  Also, we are dairy free so I did change it a bit.  I used 1 cup of vanilla soy milk in place of milk.  I also cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup since the vanilla soy milk is sweet.  My husband LOVED these and would have eaten the whole pan if I hadn't cut him off :)

This was an easy recipe to make.  I thought it was a bit too sweet but my husband, who has a sweet tooth, didn't.  Next time, I think I would reduce the sugar just a little bit.  I live in the UK and didn't think I'd be able to find cornmeal but was finally able to.  For those that use gas ovens in the UK, I cooked mine on a gas mark 6 for about 20 mins.  I used a small loaf tin and a smallish round casserole type dish.

the recipe was great!  i used the amount of sugar is called for, 2/3 c., and i didn't think it was too sweet at all!  however, i wanted to make cupcakes instead of using a square or circle pan.  for one thing, $400 was too hot.  and 20-25 minutes was WAY too long.  of course my oven might run hotter than it should.  i burned a batch before i found that 375 or 350 for 11-12 mins was just right.

Delicious and sweet.  Not too crumby, had no problems cutting it up and serving.  Would go great with some honey butter.

I recommend adding a splash of vanilla extract into the batter for an unexpected but subtle vanilla taste.

This is the perfect cornbread recipe.  I've been searching for a mildly sweet cornbread that was tender too.  If that's what you're looking for this recipe is for you.

We loved this cornbread! It was a little eggy but we like it that way. I decresaed the sugar a bit, per reviews & I increased the oil a tad, to try to combat the crumbliness that some reviews complained of. I baked these in muffin tins @ 375 degrees for about 18 minutes & they were oh so yummy. Thanks Lori White!

Pretty good cornbread.  Mine kept crumbling apart when I cut it. I followed the others advice and used only a 1/2 cup of sugar.  I'll definitely try it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really like this cornbread a lot. Like others, I only used 1/2 C of sugar and followed the rest according to the recipe. It came out moist, soft, crumbly (but not overtly crumbly), with the right sweetness. YuMM!

Excellent Cornbread Recipe :)

I made it with Chili for a potluck, and I must have had half a dozen people ask me for the recipe for the cornbread :)

Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Too much baking powder, but it was still very good. I added an extra egg and used buttermilk and it was a lovely texture. I'll be making this again but will use only a couple teaspoons of baking powder and I think it will be 5 stars!

MMMWA!!! Please kiss the chef. I loved it! I made the recommended modifications, and it turned out beautifully.  I soaked the cornmeal for 10 minutes, used 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp of baking powder, and I let the oil run over the 1/3 cup a bit. The 2/3 cup of sugar is perfect. I have tried four, count them four, recipes off this site and none of them even compare.  My search is officially over.  I have found a recipe to call my own.  Thank you so very much for sharing.

I am not a cook and needed a simple recipe to contribute to a thanksgiving potluck so I was very nervous about making something from scratch, but I found this recipe very easy to make, light and perfectly crunchy on the edge, perfect colour. Like the other reviews, I would cut back on the baking powder and sugar but otherwise a great and easy dish to prepare. I will most definitely make this over and over again until I'm a pro. Thanks Lori.

This is a very good recipe. I used a more coarse corn meal and it gave it a nice texture. I thought it was a little dry, but my mom (who makes corn bread from many recipes) loved it and asked for the recipe for herself. Thanks Lori!

I'm coming back to rate this recipe again after years of using it and give it an additional star. It is a staple in our kitchen. Last Thanksgiving I used a banana in lieu of an egg because of an allergy. Many thought it was the best cornbread yet and very moist! Kids love it. I use Goya fine cornmeal. Love it!

The bread was very good, but a sweeter than I am used to.  But still, a very good dinner bread.

Excellent cornbread!  a little too sweet for my taste, might cut out just a few tablespoons of sugar next time but fantastic overall.

Taste just like my grandmas cornbread. Its delicious. I really like how its not very, "grainy" if that is even a word, like most corn bread. Too reduce the fat and calorie in take I use, "I can't believe its not butter" spray with every bite and even get a glass of milk and milk the corn bread along with it.

The picture makes the cornbread look nice and soft. Mine wasn't. Oh well, it tasted pretty good. My mom liked it. It'd be a good idea to take the butter out of your refrigerate when you start baking the cornbread. Then, spread the butter on the cornbread while it's hot out of the oven so it will melt. I would make just enough for one meal. If you leave it for the next day, it gets hard. I'll probably make this again.

Super recipe.  I love the fact that for once a recipe actually came out the way it looks in the picture.  The only change I made was to add an extra egg as others had suggested.

I am giving this a 3 b/c i did make a few changes.  And with the changes my fiance stated he had never tried "from scratch" cornbread, but that this was the best cornbread he has ever tried.  Its very similar in taste (sweetness-wise) to the little boxes of Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix.  Perfect sweetness for a savory supper.  My changes, i dont have exact measurements for, b/c i did a little of this, little of that..etc.etc...but i cut back on oil, added corn and cheese.

Very good! and not too crumbly. I did make a few revisions based on reviews: 2 eggs; a scant 3 t. baking powder; a bit less sugar; and I soaked the corn meal in milk for 15 minutes. I will continue experimenting but this is an excellent base recipe. It's a keeper!

This was good, but I decreased the sugar to 1/4 C, used butter instead of oil, and used 2 eggs. I think the extra egg eliminated the crumbliness some users complained about. I made them into cornsticks, and they were good. 4 stars, but with changes.

I followed the recipe exact although I did have the cornmeal sit in milk for approximately 15 minutes and I added slightly less sugar...and made two batches.  The first batch I made wasn't as sweet as I expected bc the second batch which I had made (which was smaller muffins...I made them as cupcakes/muffins) was a lot sweeter.  Overall, this recipe was good despite the fact that it was quite crumbly as other reviewers have said.  My boyfriend had said it tasted good but tasted a bit flour-y.   I think I'm going to add less flour and more cornmeal next time I bake this...

This reciped is outstanding.  1/2 cup and drizzled maple syrup over the top about half way through the baking.  Absolutely yummy.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and added a bit more oil.  Thanksgiving must have.

Wow, if you like sweet cornbread (like Boston Market's) this is the recipe. Very simple and easy. I served it hot with butter. Next time I'll substitute sugar w Splenda and try adding a can of creamed corn to it.

this cornbread is so good!  it was fast to make and tastes great.  the only changes i made were to use only 1/3 cup sugar and 1/2 whole wheat flour with 1/2 all purpose flour.

I will never buy another cornbread mix again!!  This was very good and I didn't need to make any changes.  My family likes their cornbread sweet and even though I usually buy sweetened mixes I usually have to sweeten it a little more.  But this was perfect.

DELICIOUS!  We substituted maple syrup for the sugar (you don't need as much and it gives it a really nice flavor).  Like others mentioned, it was crumbly.  Has anyone found a way to remedy that?  Truly a keeper - thanks, Lori!

Excellent recipe.  I substituted SPLENDA for the sugar (1/2 cup) and it turned out great.  Easy to make, quick and YUMMY!  Next time I think I might add green chiles or pimientos for a little variety with our taco stew!

This is good, but after trying other cornbread recipes on this site, I think it's not the best.  It's very sweet - even with less sugar than called for.  It reminds me of cake more than bread.  The "Absolute Mexican Cornbread" tastes much more like regular cornbread to me.

This was so delicious!  I took others advice and reduced the sugar to 1/2 C (2/3 would have been fine) and I added a small can of creamed corn soup.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!!

Good cornbread!  Raises up nice and fluffy.  I used just a little over 1/2C sugar and it was still a little on the sweet side, but not bad.  It was a little crumbly, but still good.  This is an easy and fast recipe.

Good cornbread recipe. I gave it four stars only because it was a little too sweet for us. Next time I make it I'll cut back on the sugar and I think it will be perfect.

This was the first time I made cornbread from scratch and it was very yummy!  Served it with chili and it was just the right balance between spicy and sweet.  My 4-year-old wanted a second piece as her dessert!  I used only 1/2 cup sugar and it was the perfect sweetness...next time I'll try substituting applesauce for the vegetable oil to make it a little healthier.

first time i made this i accidently mixed up cornmeal with cream of wheat (i live in a foriegn country it all looked the same at the time)...IT was Fab !!! Highly reccomend with cream of wheat, less grainy yum! This time I made it with half cream of wheat and half corn meal and i still prefer the Whoops batch!

I use a scant 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 cup, and bake it in an 8" square pan. With those modifications, this is my new favorite cornbread recipe. I have made it several times this school year and my roommates absolutely love it!

Wonderful!  I used buttermilk but otherwise made it exactly as stated, in a cast iron skillet in the oven.  It was moist, sweet, flavorful and not crumbly.  Will add it to my recipe book for sure.

I LOVED IT. My only issue was that it fell apart. That doesn't really matter to me, because I chunk it up and eat in a bowl like cereal. YUM.

This is by far THE BEST cornbread recipe I have ever made. It does taste exactly like Jiffy mix, which I always used before I found this recipe. I like this recipe better than the Jiffy mix because you have more mix then you do with the store bought making the end product larger. Thanks for a great recipe Lori.

I love how this turned out, the top crust was a beautiful golden color. My only problem was that it was sort of crumbly, but I realized that I had mistakenly put 1/2 cup of oil in instead of 2/3. So yeah, watch your measurements, kids. Not that this recipe needs much tweaking anyway.

I have made this cornbread three times since finding it at Allrecipes and we LOVED it!  If it's too sweet for you, just use a little less sugar.  Just exactly what I was looking for and I love that it's not out of a box!

Incredibly good!! I don't even usually like cornbread that much, but this was awesome!  Sweet, moist and tender on the inside, lightly crispy on the edges. Will definitely keep and make over and over!
NOTE: Didn't taste nearly as good the next day as leftovers. Definitely make this the day you want to serve it to get that awesome, moist & sweet taste!

EXCELLENT!!  I added a bit more cornmeal and reduced the sugar.  The flavor was terrific and I had to force myslef to stop eating it or I would have eaten the whole thing.  I also used a large castiron skillet.

Really good.  I had used a recipe that came on the cornmeal box, but it had a lot of butter in it, so I this is a bit healthier. Tastes great with southwestern soups, etc.

Yummy!!  This turned out perfect!  I separated some of the 'batter' and added some rehydrated jalepeno flakes and that little loaf turned out great too (although that wasn't for me...I don't do HOT).  This was really good, highly recommend.

This is delicious.  I used white cornmeal and a little coarse ground grits to add some textural interest (still equalled 1 cup).  It is delicious - better than we get in one of the restaurants we go to (they serve a sweet cornbread as appetizer).  I'll never use the box mixes again.

Very good. I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup and added a can of cream corn. Served it with chili topped with jalapeno peppers and shredded cheese. Yummy.

This is perhaps the easiest recipe I have ever used.  Literally, the prep time took about 5 minutes and then it cooked just as described.  It was delicious!  SO EASY and everyone loved it.

Loved it!  Served with spicy chili and it was the perfect combination.  Hot and spicy chili, sweet and savory cornbread.  BF couldn't stop raving. Will never make boxed cornbread again!

YUMMY!! Best cornbread I have ever made. I added 1/2 c sugar and 2 1/2 tsp. baking powder and it turned out wonderful. Good texture and not too sweet. Went great with my taco soup.

This cornbread was delicious and was extremely easy to make - takes 5 minutes max. to mix the ingredients and then it's in the oven for 20 minutes.  Based on what other reviewers submitted, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and I used just over 2 tbsp of baking powder.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

If you like a sweet cornbread (my kids do) the texture and flavor of this is very good.  Goes great with chili or just warm with butter.

This cornbread is delicious and put the Jiffy brand mix to shame.  It has a very fluffy texture which I like, almost cake-like in appearance.  The sweetness of the sugar was extremely yummy and was one of the many reasons I loved it so much.  This was so easy to make, not much harder than using a pre-made mix; it was so much better so why bother.  Thanks for submitting such a great recipe.

This recipe has made me absolutely famous!!! :o)  I have made it over and over again and people are still raving.  I use a little half-and-half and substitute the oil for butter.  I also melt a little butter in the cast iron skillet and cook it just like grandma used to do.

YUMMM!

Excellent, simple recipe!  I was out of regular milk and substituted buttermilk, with no other alterations, and it worked beautifully.  Also, I used stone ground cornmeal which gave it a nice texture.  My kids love cornbread, and I'll definitely make this again.

Perfect five stars. Easy to get out of a glass pie pan (wide edges), I just turned it upside down on a plate. So delicious, came out golden brown, and so simple to make. No-fuss recipe, cheap and delicious, everyone at my dinner party raved and it was the first to go!

Top notch Sweet Cornbread!  Took the suggestion of prior reviewers and used 1/2C sugar and 2 tsp
baking powder.  Rave reviews from family.  Moist and did not crumble.  Best when warm and served with butter and honey.  Sweeter than traditional cornbread yet still good as a dinner bread. Thanks Lori for sharing.

Definately good cornbread.  Myabe next time I'll omit some of the milk and add some creamed corn. It was even more delicious the next morning for breakfast!  My 14 month old loved it!

This is a classic cornbread recipe. I was so glad I found it because I had a great recipe for cornbread that I lost - but this one replaced it.

The only things I changed are: I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup. Also, I used sucanat (evaporated cane juice) instead of white sugar which is so bad for one's health. I also used whole wheat flour and soy milk instead of regular milk.

With or without the substitutions, it's a fabulous cornbread recipe! I won't use anything else.

I think I've found my cornbread recipe from now on!  The only change I made was reducing the baking powder to 3 teaspoons.  It was great with turkey chili.  My family loved it!

My family and I absolutely love this recipe!  Even my husband thinks it's great, and he usually doesn't like cornbread because it's often dry.  This has become a hands down family favorite -- moist, sweet and really delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

This cornbread rocks!!! I'll never make cornbread from a mix again, this kind is really just as easy to make and so delicious! I only added 1/2 cup sugar and it was still very sweet. Also for those of us watching what we eat, this recipe is relatively low in fat and calories compared to other cornbreads (the mix included).

Very good cornbread.  Nice sweet, corn flavor.  It was a little bit dry, though.  But I'll make it again.

This bread has such a wonderful flavor! I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfectly. I believe I baked it for a total of 35 minutes, until it was a little darker golden brown. It has a very subtle sweet flavor, and excellent texture, it sort of crumbles and falls apart when you try to pick it up, but I suppose that is to be expected of cornbread! :)

This was great cornbread.  And just as the name implied SWEET cornbread.  I've tried many cornbread recipes and none of them had the sweetness that I was looking for.  The outside was crispy and the inside was moist and flavorful.

I made this into 24 mini-muffins, and they turned out perfectly. But if you were planning to add anything to these, definitely make more than 24. These are plenty sweet, but the sweet isn't overpowering, and they are not greasy like some other recipes I've tried.

This recipe was great!  I've been searching for a sweeter cornbread that isn't dry and I think I've found it.  My boyfriend suggested a little less sugar next time, so I may try it with 1/2 cup whe I make it again.

This is the best cornbread I have ever made!  I took the suggestions of others and used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was just right.  I also used only 2 tsp. of baking powder.  Can't imagine it being more perfect!

Let me start by saying, I followed the recommendation to only use 2 1/2 tsp baking powder.  I also added some corn, and made muffins instead of the 9" pan.  Something still is off....there was an odd after taste...not sure..maybe the baking powder still, or the flour (tasted kind of chalky if that makes sense).  I still rated this 4*s b/c I think that with some tweaking it could be great....it has a nice corn texture and is more moist than some corn breads

Nice and moist. I made muffins baking them for 15 minutes. I also added an extra egg and a 1/2 tsp vanilla. Could be a little more 'corny' tasting.

This is indeed very good cornbread. I think it's lower in fat than other cornbreads listed here. I used this as my starter recipe. I added canned corn and some cooked onion. It became a delicious savoury cornbread. I baked them for about 20 minutes in muffin tins. They tasted and looked perfect. I liked how the bottom was golden brown. Like others did, I used half a cup of sugar and 2 tsp of baking powder. It was quite sweet still for my taste. Wonderful recipe. Perfect for beginners.

After reading the other reviews, I too used only 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 1/2 tsp. baking powder.  Actually, I didn't have baking powder, and no all-purpose flour.  So I used 1 cup self-rising flour, 1/2 tsp. salt, and in place of the baking powder, 1/4 tsp. baking soda, 1/2 tsp. cream of tartar, and 1/4 tsp. cornstarch.  I also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  It worked out great.  I made it twice, for a party in class and for my study group.  But I wish I had had a chance to try a little more than a piece (1 1/2 of the recipe) before making it again--I would still cut back on the sugar, maybe to 1/3 cup.  Then it would be nice to have with honey--just the way I like it.  But with these adjustments, I FINALLY found a great cornbread recipe!!  Thanks Lori.

Used melted butter and added just over 1/3 cup for a buttery taste. Could just eat it by itself! Yummy! Texture was great. Didn't crumble apart!But for some reason I could actually taste the salt. Would probably cut it down to 3/4 tsp next time. Also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.

This would have been perfect if it did not have so much baking powder in it- I would definitely cut this ingredient down to about half of what was listed.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Simple and delicious!! I used only 2 teaspoons of baking powder as others suggested and added half a teaspoon of vanilla for extra flavor.  So good w/ butter and honey!!

This is the most delicious sweet cornbread I have ever tasted. I wasn't a huge fan of cornbread until I tried this recipe.  It makes a wonderful companion to chili. Thanks for this keeper!

This was my first time making cornbread and it came out great!  I also doubled the recipe to use a 9X13 pan.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla for more flavoring.  I baked it at 390F for 24 minutes and it came out fine.

Delicious, moist and just the right sweetness.  I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder and it was perfect.
