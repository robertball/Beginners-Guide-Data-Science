I used corn instead of peas and carrots and real mashed potatoes instead of the instant.   My husband and I LOVED this!

I tried this recipe last night.  I did have to make some changes as we cannot use Campbell's soup because of the gluten in the creams of mushroom.  So what I did was use a gluten free mixture, 4 tablespoons of ketchup, garlic salt and onion powder.  I used Italian green beans, canned corn and baby carrots cut up.  For the mash I used potato flakes herb and butter flavored.  While making it the family had some not so nice things to say, however afterward's they all said they loved it.  We will be doing this again.

Maybe it was me, and my taste buds, but I did not care for this. I've made another Sheperd's Pie recipe from Utah, and it's so much better!!

This was REALLY easy to make.  I have a big family so I changed it a little to meet our needs, and i will still have some to take to work for lunch!
1 lb ground turkey instead of beef (added montreal steak seasoning when browning)  
Whole bag of mixed veggies instead of 1 cup
2 cans of cream of mushroom 
2 tlbs of ketchup
a couple splashes of worcestershire sauce

I baked it in a casserole dish instead of a pie pan due to the extra volume.

Other than that, I stuck to the directions.  My family raved about it and my husband said to put it in the "keeper" folder.

Thank you so much for this healthy weeknight meal option!

This is a great base recipe. I tweak everything. I browned my ground beef with onion then stirred in some worcestershire, dijon, sundried tomato dressing in place of the catsup and combined the other ingredients. I made real mashed potatoes boiled with garlic. I used green beans because my family prefers them. I used a pie crust on the bottom and put sharp cheddar cheese on top of the potatoes. Even my 2 year old said "yummy". My finiky 12 year old and everyone else loved it. My husband said "it's better than the Cheesecake Factory's."

Really yummy easy weeknight meal.  Though the ketchup sounded weird but added it anyway and it was fine.  Used mixed veggies with peas, carrots, and green beans.  Also made homemade garlic mashed potatoes (just boiled the garlic with the potatoes and drain and beat when soft).  This was yummy and fast.

This was great, I am just starting to get into cooking and it turned out great. It was just a little too moist, but still delicious. I made some changes: mashed potatoes from scratch, added about 1/4 cup of corn and 1 garlic clove. The mashed potatoes turned out great, not too dry, not too moist, not sure what caused the dish to be a little too moist. I also did not add milk since I didn't use instant mashed potato.

BIG HIT!!  I've made it twice in the last week.  Once for a potluck (gone in about a minute!) then once for my family.  Everyone loved it.  GREAT comfort food!  Used homemade mashed taters on top.

Great recipe, but needs a little salt in my opinion.  I added salt and garlic for that extra "umph".  Also, I found that the mashed potatoes were a little dry so I had to increase the milk.

I made some changes but I'm sure the original would still be awesome.  I chopped up some pork I had and used that instead of the ground beef, added more veggies, and used cream of chicken soup because it's all I had.  It was so yummy!

It doesn't get any easier than this recipe.  I use two tricks that put this dish in the oven in less than 10 minutes.  1. I always make this the day after I make mashed potatoes.  I make a double recipe of mashed potatoes so I can just heat them up in the microwave (so they'll spread easier) and put them on the dish. 2.  I buy beef in bulk and freeze 1 pound bags individually.  I always fry up some meat with onions and then freeze it because it thaws very quickly.  That way on nights when I'm pressed for time, I can still get a great meal on the table.  Very yummy and easy.  It's a great recipe to turn to in a pinch.

This was good, however, I would not make the mashed potatoes like this recipe calls for.  One I didn't feel there was enough potatoes and they just were not that good.  Make your instant potatoes as normal and I'd go with two cups cooked.

This was very yummy and everybody wanted seconds.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, but will change a couple of things next time.  Will add more veggies, since there was a lot of meat, and will at least double the potato topping.  It was a bit skimpy.  We really did enjoy this meal and will be making it again!

Haven't had Shepherd's Pie in years! We really enjoyed this. Was simple to put together. Not liking cooked carrots I subbed them with corn. I did have to add more milk, about 1/4 cup, to the potatoes to make them more spreadable.

Wow! This turned out awesome! I did some changes that other reviews recommended and it was delicious! The additions I made were an extra tablespoon of ketchup, 3 tablespoons of sour cream, 1/2 tsp of garlic salt, 1/2 tsp worchestershire sauce and I put american cheese slices on the meat mIxture before the potatoes. Also, I used frozen mixed veggies. My husband claims to be a shepards pie expert and he devoured this!  Yummy!

This was good! I changed a few things though. I threw in some chopped garlic with the beef and onions, and seasoned it with salt, pepper, cumin, chile powder, and minced onion. I used 1can corn, 1can peas, 1 can carrots, which I chopped up. And I didn't have cream of mushroom so I substituted cream of celery. Topped with shredded cheddar cheese. Definitely will make again.

I make this every once in a while & my husband also loves it. I also made some changes & use mixed vegetables, added some minced garlic to the hamburger & onion and use the Bob Evans mashed potatoes on the top which is easier & taste better than instant. Enjoy!

This was good. I added Gravy master to the browned meat, which gave it a fuller flavor.

Delicious and simpler than the other shepherd's pie recipes. 
I wanted MORE. 
We used 9 inch round baking pan instead of pie pan. Our potatoes on top were a little thick to try to spread, but no one seemed to care. Also added a little extra ketchup. Yummy.

UPDATE: Using extra ketchup in the meat and using Betty Crocker "Loaded mash potatoes" adds a lot of good flavor to this! But I found with the Betty Crocker instant potatoes, you'll need extra milk.

This is an excellent base recipe. When browning the meat, season it with salt, pepper, and garlic; add 2-3 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce and an extra cup of peas and carrots. Also, make homemade mashed potatoes and sprinkle on a little cheese before you put it in the oven. It is delicious and got rave reviews.

4.5 stars. Good.  Needs a more flavor, but I just kept getting another helping.  I would try adding more ketchup and maybe some minced garlic.

This is decent, but it isn't great.  It is one of the first times I've had Shepherd Pie, so maybe this pie is supposed to be very mild, but it was just not tasty, and it didn't make my mouth water like some of the recipes on here do.  It is quick, and it is easy to put together, but it is just rather lackluster for me.  I imagine it needs some other spice or flavoring, but I can't say what it might be.  I will likely not make it again unless I'm in a tired and just want to throw something together.

Not bad, but very bland. My husband tells me this is what shepherds pie tastes like. Will add some onion and garlic to the meat mixture next time.

I used about 3/4 can of Heinz (sorry, Campbells!) Savory beef gravy instead of mushroom soup. Did not add peas or carrots. Used Green Beans instead, and real mashed potatoes. Layered green beans, hamburger/gravy mix, mashed potatoes, topped with cheese.  My husband loved it! (Of course he mixes EVERYTHING up when he eats it, so this is kind of "pre-mixed"!) Not for company, but good comfort food and good forl eftovers.

I added fresh sautéed mushrooms  and  onions. I left out peas and carrots because I keep a low carb diet. Instead of potatoes I used mashed cauliflower (butter only). I also added more ketchup. It was delicious!!! My husband loved it too.

I followed recipe exactly. The vegetables were crunchy. They should have been partially cooked before baking. Over all Taste was bland to our family.

This was amazing. I've been making Shepards Pie for years, and I can't believe what I was missing out on!! It was creamy and absolutely delicious. The boys loved it, and it made a lot! I used corn instead of peas and carrots, which our family prefers. Yummy! Will make again!

This was very good! My son and I really enjoyed it. The only thing I did differently was to add steak sauce instead of ketchup and low sodium soup to make it healthier. I also used leftover veggies and mashed potatoes from Sunday dinner so it went together really fast, great for a busy weeknight supper!

I took advise from another reviewer and added 1 1/2 t of Gravy Master.  I also made the following changes:  I added 1/8 t of garlic powder, I exchanged the frozen peas and carrots for a 8.5 oz can of Del Monte Peas & Carrots, I made mashed potatoes from scratch, and I topped with paprika and shredded parmesan.  The recipe came out great!  FYI:  I made the pie a day ahead and put it in the frig for my family to bake the next day.  It did wonderfully.

With a few more seasonings on the meat, this dish can be 5 stars. I also mashed my own potatoes and put some cheese on top before baking it. Yummy!

I added garlic, a Sazon seasoning pack, salt & cumin to the meat mixture. I also used Onion & Chive flavored mashed potatoes. Mine needed additional oven time but it turned out awesome! Flavorful and the perfect comfort food. I may add corn next time but glad I tried it!

Excellent comfort food recipe - easy and quick. I didn't have any frozen veggies, so just used a jar of homecanned green beans and half a can of corn. Also used real mashed potatoes instead of instant, and ground turkey. Will make again - was a hit on a cold, snowy night.

We all enjoyed this.  No one guessed that the secret little oomph was the ketchup.  It gave it a nice tang.  Yummy, simple, hearty (though I did add cheese too).

My family loved this. Instead of just carrots and peas, I just added mixed frozen vegetables with corn, peas, green beans, and carrots. Then after 15 minutes of baking, I topped it with cheddar cheese until melted. Fast and yummy!

Great starting point for a recipe. I love Shepherds pie and with this recipe you can tinker with it. I switch up add chili powder, cumin or use a store bought taco seasoning to give it a different flavor. Switch up and add green chiles or rotel tomatoes, can use Cream of Celery soup. Just a great recipe you can mess around with.

We thought this one was okay... It lacked oomph and richness. The kids slathered on the sauces, and it all went, but next time I will go with the brown onion soup rather than the mushroom soup.

Over all not a bad recipe. It was a little bland for me. I though it could have used garlic. I ended up making my own mash potatoes instead of using insta or flakes. It's very filling. Made for two people and had well over half left over. Over all not expensive either. Combined the shopping trip with another recipe and spend less then $30. Makes me miss my time in London.

I added worcheshire sauce, steak seasoning, garlic salt, pepper and kosher salt and still, this was rather bland.  I used homemade mashed potatoes and also added a little shredded cheddar cheese to the top.  If I make this again, I'll add sauteed celery, and try to add seasoning to the mashed potatoes for flavor.  However, it was fast and my 10 year old loved it.  Good comfort food, just needs more flavor.

I added corn to the peas and carrots, as well as some garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce. Turned out wonderfully, though the potatoes only browned on the edges for me.

Great recipe. Only thing I change is I use real mashed potatoes rather than instant. I find they spread a bit easier. I also add some shredded cheddar cheese to the top before putting in the oven.

This was super easy and very tasty! I added a little extra salt, worcestershire and herbes de provence to flavor the meat, and then melted shredded cheddar cheese on top at the end. I will definitely make this again!

Nice easy and tasty recipe.  The changes I made (don't we always make changes?) were minor.  Since I was doubling the recipe to feed a crowd, I doubled the meat and used a can of Cream of Mushroom soup and a cup of brown gravy.  Everything else was doubled as is.  Luckily I had a big bowl of leftover freshly mashed potatoes.  They were nice and chunky so you knew they were fresh.  Thanks for a great recipe - I'm adding it to my recipe box now!

I made a few changes, and LOVED this recipe! Instead of just peas and carrots, I used a full pound of mixed vegetables, and I also added a can of cream of celery soup. This ended up making a bit more filling than could fit in one pie dish, so I made a second mini-pie for leftovers. You could also try saving the extra filling and using it in puff pastry shells.

I personally love this.  I do tweak though.  I don't use carrots, cause the family doesn't like them.  For veggies I use peas, corn, and green beans instead.  I have to double everything but it turns out great every time.

This was pretty good. I did change the recipe though. I used ground turkey instead of beef. And instead of instant potatoes I used the real ones. Instant potatoes don't like me and I can never get them to cook right. Also used only peas and sprinkled with cheddar cheese between the meat and potato layers.

SCRUMPTIOUS!  As suggested by another reviewer I added Lipton onion soup mix.  I also added Poultry seasoning as I often use with these sorts of dishes.  Oh, and I added cream to both my mashed potatoes & meat (I know, I'm terrible).  But it was tasty and not as heavy as the shepherd's pies I've made in the past (even with the cream).

Absolutely Love it! The family unanimously enjoyed. 
 I boiled 8 large golden yellow potatoes (in substitute for instant potato flakes, milk & butter mixture.) I seasoned (2lbs) ground beef with 3-4tbsp paprika, 1/2 tsp salt, black pepper & a little Mccormicks brand seasoning. 
In the peas/creamed mixture, I added an extra tbsp ketchup and added creamed sweet corn to the mixture of peas & carrots. (it adds subtle flavor w/o a sweet taste, just right). In a large casserole dish( a little bigger than 9x13) I layered beef, creamed mixture then mashed creamy potatoes and sprinkled w/ cheese. Baked at 400 for 15 minutes. Loved it! Let me add I the creamed ingredients blend seamlessly into this recipe! New Favorite!

This is really great! I used fresh carrots and homemade mashes potatoes. I used the instant the first time and found them to be way too dry. I also added several dashes of worchestershire sauce. My husband looooves this.

Pretty good. I made the instant potatoes and thought those were terrible so threw them out and made real potatoes to put on top. Much better. Needs a little more flavor so I will check other people's ideas before making it again.

Fabulous.  The cream of mushroom soup adds great flavor and a creaminess.  I added some thyme and fresh ground pepper to it.  I did not bake it in a pie crust.  I just doubled the recipe and then put it in a casserole dish to bake.  Absolutely delicious.  The family was scraping the pan.

First try at Shepherd's Pie and my husband LOVED it!  Said it was the best thing he'd ate in a long time (and he always tells me he likes my cooking).  I used ground turkey and browned it with the onion, 3 or 4 teaspoons of minced garlic and a teaspoon of seasoning salt.  I threw in a cup of corn, and added a scant layer of shredded cheese between the meat and potato layers, then added about a cup of sour cream to the potatoes. YUMMY!  I'm definately adding this to our favorites.

Super easy and a definite classic comfort food during the winter time! I used peas and corn and added a little crumbled bacon to the meat mixture. Not the lowest calorie/fat meal, but once in a while this is necessary!

1. Use two onions instead of one, add 5 cloves of garlic when sautéing. Season meat with 1 1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper while sautéing. Don’t pour off all fat after browning meat. Retain some and add about three tablespoons of flour to mixture. Keep sautéing until flour is absorbed.2. Use 1 beef bouillon cube when adding mushroom soup, veggies and catsup. After meat pie filling is made, let it rest while prepping pie pan.3. Make enough mashed potatoes to fill bottom layer and top layer of pie. Add extra milk and butter to mashed potatoes for a creamier texture and don’t forget to add salt and pepper!

This was so simple to make and really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, and the only thing that I will change for next time will be to double the pepper, and definitely add some salt. Other than that, it's wonderful. This will be going into my regular rotation.

This is so easy.  I did make homemade mashed potatoes using butter and cream to top it with, I think that is best.   I also used the newer bigger can of cream of mushroom, I think it is 15 oz.   I forgot the ketchup- add that next time.   I did add Worcestershire sauce.  We love the stuff.   I also used a bag of frozen mixed veggies because it is what I had.   I used diet lean burger too.   I added a little cream so it wasn't too dry.   My husband had a friend drop by so I ended up serving it to a guest, not what I planned to do, but he did really enjoy it.

Good, basic recipe. I thought it was slightly bland, so I added salt to my plate. Will keep, and make again.

Very yummy! I used green beans, corn and diced tomatoes for our vegetables instead of carrots and peas and the combination was delicious. I made fresh mashed potatoes and mixed in a bit of garlic. My husband's only suggestion or critique was that the meat needed more seasoning.

I've never reviewed a recipe before, as I tend to modify a bit, changing the original recipe. Made this exactly as stated and we loved it. I did forget to add the onion while browning the beef, but normally don't do it that way anyway. It's not complicated or challenging, but is an easy week night throw together. Make double, as I did. You will want it again in a day or two. May try adding a bit of Worcestershire next time. There will definitely be a next time.

Loved it! I doubled the recipe in order to feed 4 adults. I also made a few changes: 1) I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken. 2) I added salt, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder to the mixture. 3) I used fresh baby carrots instead of frozen, chopped, and then boiled the carrots and peas for a few minutes just to soften them up. 4) I used the herb and butter flavor of mashed potatoes, and then I sprinkled on some shredded sharp cheddar cheese before baking. (Next time I might use a little more potatoes- it didn't QUITE cover the two pies. But still... Amazing! Thanks for this easy recipe!

I liked it, but I found it to be a little too moist, as well. I added fresh garlic to the hamburger, too. I also made more mashed potatoes than the recipe called for. Overall, good and easy.

I added peas and corn as my vegetables. I also topped with a little cheese and sour cream. Sprinkled a little garlic salt on the meat mixture before adding the potatoes. Even my five year old picky eater thought it was yummy!

I expected this to be bland but it was pretty good.  I added a dash of Worcestershire and some garlic to give it some zip and it was pretty good.

This is a great base recipe!! I always use more spices (garlic, Worcestershire, cinnamon, pepper, salt, paprika) and a splash or two of beef stock. I use cream of chicken since my hubs is allergic to mushrooms. I use a can of corn and some frozen peas, pre made homestyle mashed potatoes from the store and a little shredded cheddar on top. Easy peasy! My 5 year old says it's his favorite meal I make!  Thanks for posting this, it's a staple in our home!! :)

I made this tonight for my family! Every actually ate it!! 
Of course, I cringed when it called for instant mashed potatoes, so I made real ones. I put some original Mrs. Dash in the ground beef as I cooked it, and I sprinkled cheese on top! I served it was Brown gravy, but my hubby used Katchup. 

Very easy to make, I could probably make this again without the recipe in front of me! Love it!

Fantastic, easy and fast; we will certainly be repeating this recipe! I made fresh mashed potatoes (with the peel on) with minced garlic, butter, almond milk, and added cooked carrots to use up some stuff in the fridge. I also pan fried spinach with the onions and next time will add in sliced mushrooms. I used vegetarian "ground beef" to make it vegetarian. Lastly, I topped with cheddar cheese since cheese is just so yummy. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we did!

First time making Shepherd's Pie and it was a hit! I did alter it a bit: added different veggies and hot sauce and cheese inbetween the layer of meat and potatoes and also on top of potatoes.

Good recipe.  I did add spices:  oregano, chili powder, 3 cloves of garlic.  Added basil to real mashed potatoes.  Forgot to check the recipe and put in 1 cup of ketchup instead of 1 tblsp!  Glad I did.  Tasted great and the meat mixture didn't dry out. Easy make and very flexible recipe.  Will use it again with my mistakes.

This is a very easy recipe and quick to make. I only made a few minor changes I added more milk to the potatoes, a little extra ketchup and instead of making it in a pie pan I made them in individual servings in ramekins!

This was my first time making Shepherds pie. I followed the directions except we used ground turkey. I used frozen peas and corn and a can of carrots which I chopped up. Added everything to the casserole dish, and topped with shredded cheddar.  Made the taters as directed on the box and topped the mixture. It came out incredible! Will be making this again for sure!

Hunting season just ended around here, so I made this out of elk burger.  Yum!  The only tweaks made was the addition of some rosemary and sage to the meat, and also made real mashed potatoes as opposed to using flakes.

This recipe is so, so easy to make.  The beef filling is very, very good.  One major problem, and the reason I am only giving it 4 stars.  I followed the instructions to the T, and the potatoes turned out inexplicably stiff, impossible to spread, and they only covered around 1/4 of the pie.  I had to make an additional batch of mashed potatoes.  For this second -- much larger --batch, I just winged it, did not follow the part of the recipe for the potatoes.  I made the consistency thick enough as to be hearty, but thin enough to spread.  The resulting casserole was a great success.  My boyfriend and his father loved it.  My boyfriend said the beef filling was "delicious.  Perfecto."  And his father, who is an extremely light eater, who NEVER finishes his dinner, actually had two servings!  I was very happy about that.  Oh!  None of us like carrots and peas much, so I used a cup of frozen corn instead.  With these modifications, I consider this my go-to recipe for Shepherd's Pie.

P.S.  My boyfriend's favorite meal, that his dear mother used to make before she passed away over a decade ago, was Shepherd's Pie.  He said that this Shepherd's Pie is very close to what his mom used to make.  :  )

Great recipe! I didn't have cream of mushroom soup on hand but I found that french onion soup (thickened with flour into a gravy) works magnificent!!! Kids really enjoyed this dish. Instead of making homemade or instant potatoes, we used a family favorite.. Bob Evans original mashed potatoes! :)

This was quick and easy to make and really good. I used frozen mixed veggies (peas, carrots, corn & green beans), added some garlic and italian seasoning to the meat as it cooked, and melted some cheese on top at the end. It could have used more salt. It was the perfect amount for four people.

Perfect recipe, although I did add a small can of corn and piped my mashed potatoes by filling up a ziplock bag, snipping off the corner, and squeezing little dallops around a 9-inch pie dish. Easy, simple ingredients, and quick baking time in the oven! Perfect portion for 2+, I had leftovers to take to work which still tasted good even after reheating. Definitely will make this again.

omg this was delicious. i mean i have never had shepherds pie before and this made both my mom and i wonder why we never had it. its easy to make but i suggest with the instant potatoes you follow the directions on the box. i tried making it how this said and the potatoes werent done right and i had to add in a bunch more milk. then again the instant mashed potatoes i had were different than normal. i was supposed to add in a bunch of water too. also to get a nice golden top for the mashed potatoes and after the 15 minute its still not brown put it on broil for about 2-3 minutes. you want to keep an i on it but it gets brown fast and tastes delicious. those are the only problems i had with this :D

This was such a tasty dish and so easy to make too!  The only changes I made were using ground turkey and not putting so much condensed soup, just enough to make it moist.  I also omitted the ketchup because I wasn't sure how well it would go with turkey meat.  But this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks!!

Amazing recipe!! My husband said it was the best shepherd's pie he's ever had!! I didn't have any instant potatoes so I just made the real thing and topped them with cheddar cheese. Soooo yummy and simple:)

I split the recipe in half; making one half with beef, and one half vegitarian for myself. Both were excellent. I accidentally added too much pepper to his, but he said it was great and took the leftovers to work today. Success.

This  was very easy. We did add some corn, use real mashed potatoes, and used ground turkey. It was good, but not great. I did like the onion.

I liked it but it needed more flavor in some way. I should have used tips from other reviews. I substituted corn for the peas. I did add garlic and paprika to the recipe but it was still a little bland. I also added cheddar cheese to the top for extra flavor. My boyfriend loved it and ate a huge plate of it and went back for seconds so maybe it wasn't so bad :)

This was soooo good. I changed it a bit to fit what I had but it still worked out so well. I used a can of green beans, a can of corn, and chopped up some fresh baby carrots. I also added about a teaspoon or so of thyme and I made real mashed potatoes instead of instant. Everyone loved it and we will be making it again.

Loved the recipe!  few changes.  I added bacon and saved about tbsp of the bacon grease and sauted the onions,garlic and carrots in this until tender then added chopped mushrooms  and adobe seasoning until done. set aside then browned the meat.  added tbsp worchestershire sauce then the rest of the ingredients plus peas and corn.  for the potato topping I made mashed potatos then add 1 egg handful (or 2) cheese plus handful of parm. cheese mix with spoon top meat mixture add cheddar cheese and progresso bread crumbs bake until brown  will definately make this again

Yum! I forgot the ketchup and it worked out just fine. I also used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, added 1 cup of cheddar cheese, and used Birdseye Steamfresh mixed veggies. The choice of veggies made a HUGE difference! They were so flavorful and didn't get overpowered by the meat, cheese, etc.

This was a good recipe. It didn't turn out exactly like the recipe called because SOMEONE can't read (me) and put a whole can of green beans and corn into the dish instead of half. Needless to say everyone got an extra helping of their veggies that night. :-)

My kids and husband love this dish.  I found that we like it made with cream of chicken soup the best.  I also top it with shredded cheddar cheese and the kids love when the cheese gets a little crispy.

We loved this, and my teenage son came back for seconds.  Ok, so what else is new?  But he really liked it a lot.  What I did differently:  I added a cup of mushrooms to the beef and onion in the first step.  I used a tablespoon of red wine vinegar instead of ketchup, added a dash of sea salt.  I used a cup of frozen mixed vegetables and I completely forgot to add the milk.   I had no instant mashed potatoes on hand, so I cooked in the same pan until bubbly and served it over really thick slices of whole wheat toast.  It was a hit and I look forward to the leftovers for  tomorrow's lunch!

Made this last night for supper and my husband, son and I loved it! I just ate the leftovers for lunch and it was just as good. Some changes I made include: added salt & garlic powder, used some leftover shredded beef roast (for part of it and ground beef for the rest-divided), used fresh carrots and leftover peas, used cream of celery soup. It was just one of those meals that came together with use of whatever I had...and it worked!

We LOVE this recipe. It is always a guaranteed hit. I've used tons of different vegetables in it too. Sometimes I double the mashed potatoes and put it in a slightly bigger baking dish. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this for my family and we all really liked it. I followed it pretty closely to the recipe except for adding a few more veggies (corn and french cut green beans). It was yummy and I REALLY liked the addition of the ketchup. I don't remember exactly how much I used, but I think I at least doubled the ketchup. I also added garlic powder and some seasoned salt. Very good... I will make this again.

Just made this for dinner this evening and it was a BIG hit!!   Didn't have cream of mushroom soup so used only one I had which was cream of celery soup.....very tasty!!  I think any cream soup would do fine.  Kids and adults both gobbled it up!  Very easy to make and very quick!!

This was very good and very easy to make. Hubby loved it! I did add about 1/4 c. sour cream to the meat mixture and left out the ketchup, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. This will become a regular in our house!

This is the first time I have made shepherd's pie. After alot of adding of my own touches it did not much resemble the recipe, but this is a good recipe to start with.

My whole family (even my picky 4 year old) really enjoyed this recipe, I did think though that the poatoes were a bit stiff, and might add a tiny bit more milk next time.  This was my frist trial with Shepherd's pie, and can't wait to try out some of the others as well.  I will certainly use this recipe again :).

Great recipe, but I changed some things. I mixed the cream of mushroom soup with corn instead of mixed veggies, and I didn't mix potatoes with it. Instead I made real potatoes and spread over all. Last few minutes of baking time I sprinkled with shredded cheese.

Added cheese to the beef, because kids love cheese, and I've made this with just about any frozen veggies I have on hand and it turns out great! Corn and green beans are good too!

I made this using leftover meatloaf (coarse chopped) and mashed potatoes. All I added were the veggies and condensed soup. Came out very good.

I loved it.  I used a package of Idahoan potatoes & they worked fine.  Did need to use more than the one cup of milk the recipe called for - closer to 2 cups in order to spread the potatoes over th meat.

My hubby and I went crazy over this!! I made a few slight adjustments. When browning the ground beef, I also used shallots, chopped celery and chopped parsnips to add some flavor. In addition to the peas and carrots, I also added some Lima beans to the mix and instead of ketchup I used 2 tablespoons of sofrito and just a splash of beef broth. I also used ready- made mashed potatoes to save a few minutes of prep time. Amazing flavor!

We only added shredded cheese, otherwise we stuck to the directions. The instant potatoes were Buttery Homestyle Idahoan Mashed potatoes. So easy and quick, everyone was satisfied and we’ll make this again.

easy throw together meal.  Easy to customize too.  For example I add greek seasoning to my meat and use whatever frozen veggies I have on hand.  Sometimes instant potatoes sometimes homemade.  I also never measure with this recipe and it always turns out

This was so easy and tasty! I used a GF cream of mushroom soup (Pacific Foods) and added some diced mushrooms on top. I look forward to making it again, experimenting with stewed tomatoes and other seasonings.

I tried this recipe based on the ratings and I know I’m not in the majority, but I thought it was bland. While there was nothing wrong with it, my family and I didn’t like it. I think we’re used to a heartier recipe.

I use just corn for veggies and add some hot sauce in the meat mixture.  Then, some mozzarella cheese and garlic pepper in the mashed potatoes, 
Delicious! Huge hit in my family,  make this all the time.

It was delicious!  I do use use corn for my veggie (just a personal preference ) and I sprinkle on shredded cheese for the last five minutes that I bake it.  My husband and I both love it. It’s a recipe that I definitely have in my rotation.  It’s oh so yummy!

I made this exactly like recipe, the only change I made was to make 4 individual pies instead of one big one. My husband and I had one each when I made them and the other two we reheated later in the week. I just added a tab of butter on top of the potatoes before reheating. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Delicious!

This recipe was alright, although it wasn't my favorite. It's possible I messed up the potatoes because they were a major problem simply because they didn't spread very well over the top of the meat mixture. I also definitely think the meat and veggies mixture could have used a few more spices or something to give it a little bit more flavor.

The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because I varied it so as not to use canned soup.  I used a cast iron skillet: brown 3 T butter with 1/2 chopped yellow onion.  Add 4 T. basil pesto.  Brown @ 1 min.  Add 1/3 c. flour and brown for @5 min.  Add 1 c milk, & stir continuously until it is incorporated.  Repeat with 2 more cups of milk, one cup at a time.  THEN add the veggies and meat (I used chicken in this case), cook a bit, and top with the mashed potatoes.  Transfer the skillet of yumminess to the preheated 400 degree oven and bake 20 minutes.  Delicious!

I made this recipe and really liked it. It was very quick and easy, a fast meal for busy families. After the first time I made this I started playing with the recipe. I found a version I love that takes even less time. I used 8 oz instant garlic mashed potatoes instead of 2 cups potatoes. Instead of package directions I made them with 2 cups of milk. I substituted peas and carrots with a bag of frozen green beans mixed in after everything else was mixed. After putting it in 2 qt casserole dish I sprinkled a cup of cheddar cheese on top and then spread the garlic mashed potatoes on top of that.

So easy and so delicious!  For an easier preparation, I used Sour Cream and Chive instant mashed potatoes.  It was a delicious combo!

I used a lb of fresh ground Highland Beef. For the vegetables I used onions from the garden, carrots, green beans and corn that I canned last summer, instead of the peas (which my spouse hates). I added shredded cheddar cheese and bread crumbs to the top of the mashed potatoes. I cooked in the oven for 30 minutes at 375F. We both loved this! So good! I can’t wait until we have fresh ground lamb to make this again.

I followed the basic recipe but I did add garlic salt, Lowery seasoning salt and Worcester sauce to the beef. I used a cup of carrots/peas/corn.  I used Bob Evens microwave potatoes which worked perfect. This makes an excellent meal!

Very delicious. I'm not a fan of instant potatoes, so used gold potatoes adding parsley, basil & oregano to boiling water and mashed as normal when done.

Left out the veggies and added cheese between meat and potato layer as well as putting cheese on top.

Doubled the batch, makes incredible leftovers.

I really looked forward to this meal. I read the reviews and agreed the recipe should have some flavor added. I used crushed garlic when browning the meat (turkey), salt and pepper. Made my own mashed potatoes seasoning with salt and pepper. Still very bland. I will use this as a basic recipe. Next time I will try condensed onion soup to attempt a savory flavor. I really wanted to live this recipe.

Pretty darn good for a quick meal. I cooked a little longer on the stove to make sure those veggies got cooked. I also added extra potatoes and milk because it was a little thick and short. I baked a little extra and threw on some cheese at the end. Tasted great and ready in no time!

So easy and so tasty!  I'm a big Costco shopper, so for those that can relate to Costco products here's what I did (basically the same recipe).  I used the 1.25 lb package of organic ground beef and sauteed with chopped onion.  Then I threw in several cups of the frozen mixed vegetables and cooked for a bit.  Then added the cream of mushroom soup and a little salt and pepper.  Meanwhile, mix a package of the refrigerated mashed potatoes with a cup (or two?) of grated cheddar and nuke it until warm.  Once the veggies are cooked, pour the meat/veggie mixture into a 13x9 pan and top with the cheesy mashed potatoes.  Cook in the oven as directed.  Easy and delicious comfort food!

Adjusted per other reviewers and my own preferences (no processed food like canned soup and instant potatoes and no sugar, which is in ketchup.)

Instead of soup: Beef Bouillon, celery, garlic, corn starch.
2 cups carrots, corn and peas.
3 Tbs Worcestershire sauce.
3 Tbs sour cream.
Salt & pepper.
No ketchup.
Real mashed potatoes (with milk and butter) instead of instant.
Sprinkle top of mashed potatoes w/ salt, pepper, paprika.
Cheddar and Muenster cheese on top.

A great dish everyone needs in their back pocket. Make the recipe as is or modify to your taste. I used corn and carrots and added Worcester sauce. And I know shepherds pie isn't typically in a pie shell but I've been into making my own lately and thought Pot Pie has crust why not Sheperds? Delicious! I like recipes like this because of the flexibility; change out ingredients, fresh or frozen and the timing. You can let it simmer on the stove for a bit before baking ( as I was making a pie crust)! Very tasty, pleases everyone and is fun to cook!

I made this instead with frozen corn and prepared sour cream and chive mashed potatoes  from the store. My kids love this recipe and it's super easy to make.  It also reheats well so it's a great leftover meal as well.

This was my first time making shepherd's pie. I chose this recipe because it included cream of mushroom soup and I thought that sounded tasty and I was right! I used the kind with roasted garlic and it made for a great flavor. I included frozen corn with the frozen peas and carrots because I love corn, and also sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top. It was super easy to make and the perfect meal for the recent fall weather change. It is so delicious I'm on my way over to my neighbor's with some now!

This was pretty good though we used real mashed potatoes instead of the instant kind.  Personally I like a layer of creamed corn between the meat and potatoes; may add that next time.

I modified it a bit, adding garlic to the ground beef and onion, as well as frozen corn. I also made mashed potatoes from scratch. It was divine and will be a staple in my house from now on.

This is a really nice change from the shepherds pie I usually make. It was much easier to put together. I had leftover mashed potatoes to use up so I mixed them with cream cheese and sour cream and put them on top of the meat and peas mixture. Threw some shredded cheese on top to make it look a bit fancier. I think you could use many different kinds of vegetables. Delicious and will be used in our rotation.

The recipe is simple and quite tasty, but in a sort of generic way. I'd probably add something more tomato-y if I were to use this recipe as a base again.

One change: I used cream of potato, because the store near me (in Japan) doesn't have cream of mushroom!

This recipe has become one of our favorites!  I tweak it just a little, I saute' onion and garlic with the hamburger, reduce the peas and carrots to 1/2 cup, add 1/2 cup of corn and instead of using the potato buds I use one envelope of Idahoan instant potatoes and I make it according to the envelope instructions.  I find that it spreads better that using potato buds and milk.

I didn't use ketchup, and instead of frozen veggies I sautéed mushrooms and added those to the beef and onion mixture. I also sprinkled a little bit of mild cheddar cheese on top of the mashed potatoes before baking. Delicious! I'l definitely make it again.

I used garlic mashed potatoes that I already made from this site. In the middle I put frozen veggies. It turned out amazing and it was super easy to throw together. I'm def going to make again. It was a fan fav with the husband too.

Very very easy to prepare.  I added some seasoning ie garlic powder, basil, and a few red pepper flakes.  Delicious.  My husband loved it and was thrilled when there was enough leftover to have a second night...so was I.

I wanted to make a shepherds pie from the ingrediants that I had lying around, so I used this recipe as a base.

instead of mushroom soup I used onion soup, I added cornstarch to thicken it and reduced it by half. Then I used the soup to boil some baby carrots to put in. I also added some garlic to the soup while cooking.

in the meat I added more garlic, basil, rosemary, and a pile of pepper. when it was done cooking I added the ketchup, cooked it a bit more and then added corn, green beans and the soup. I let it cook down until it was the appropriate thickness.

in the potatoes, I added parmesan cheese, some bacon bits and some pesto.

after putting everything together, I topped it with breadcrumbs and cheese then broiled.

it turned out perfect! ??

Oh my gosh!! This was so good. I did change up the recipe a little. Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey. Also, I used organic mixed veggies. In place of potato flakes, I made garlic mashed potatoes. Lastly, I used a different brand of cream of mushroom. Only because it's the only thing my store had. Quality, fresh ingredients make this dish amazing. I'll be making this dish again and again.

I made this on a day I had to make myself cook dinner because I was so tired of cooking. Pretty easy, tastes very good. If I make it again, I will increase the mashed potato topping; the potatoes barely covered the meat mixture, and I love mashed potatoes! I might tweak it a bit next time like others have to spice it up a little, but it was good comfort food as written, too.  Very good for a cold night dinner.

It was great! I did a few things differently. I used real potatoes & fresh carrots. I boiled 3 cloves of garlic in with the potatoes and mashed with butter, milk and approximately one cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I also added salt and doubled the pepper. It was yummy.

The basic blueprint of this recipe is good, but I found as I was preparing this, it was going to need a bit punching-up as it were.

I used two packages of instant potatoes. I prepared the carrots and peas in a separate pan in butter, salt and pepper.  I added garlic salt, celery salt and onion powder to the meat as I browned it and I doubled the amount of ketchup. I also added additional butter to the potatoes and instead of cream of mushroom soup I used cream of potato.

Because it is such a hearty meal, I kept it simple by serving it with a side dish of cranberry sauce and sliced bread.

I'm not a great judge of my own cooking as I feel like I'm not that good at it, but my husband seemed to really enjoy it and I have to say I did go back for seconds and it was great for leftovers the next night!  

Very tasty and great for a cold winter's night cuddle-up dinner and it was simple to make even for non-cooks like me!

This recipe will go into my "Cook it again" file for sure!

This recipe is really easy to make and is ok, but the flavor lacks... something. I've made it twice. The second time I added garlic powder and Worcester to the meat and also added cheddar to the mashed potatoes. This helped, but it was still slightly bland.

Pretty good! The frozen mixed veggies I had on hand included green beans...so it needed to cook a bit longer because the beans were a tad on the "crunchy" side. Topped it with cheese. Overall, very yummy!

This has become a regular in our home and I've shared the recipe!  Simple enough for a quick comfort meal.  I've made it several times whenever I've had leftover mashed potatoes handy.  I do now add my own seasonings, but the base is perfect as it is.

I only had cream of celery soup so I used that with good results.  I was skeptical of the catsup but I did use it and it definitely adds flavor.  
I warmed leftover mashed potatoes in the microwave before adding them on top and drizzled them with melted butter.  
Very easy very tasty

I followed MissNadia's advice, but used two containers of Trader Joe's Cream of Portobello Mushroom condensed soup and added two cloves of minced garlic to the mashed potatoes.  Very good!

Made this last night... it was great. Made a few alterations like doubling the recipe and mixed veggies instead of peas and carrots along with shredded cheddar cheese on top of the potatoes.
Will make it again and try other variations.

I used ground turkey instead of beef and made the mashed potatoes from scratch, but otherwise, I stuck to the recipe.  It was good, but bland.  If I make this again, I'll definitely try to spice it up a little.

This definitely works for a quick easy recipe. We enjoyed it very much...except it's more on the mushy side than my normal recipe.
I have made it twice. The 4 star is for the first time...as written. I just found it slightly bland. So the next time I added Worcestershire and a spice blend. I also make my own mashed potatoes and top with cheddar cheese.  Either way it is definitely worth making.

This is my favorite shepherd's pie recipe! Tried several and this is the one. Typically pre make this the day before or morning of and pop in the oven when I get home. 
Use fresh carrots and make my own mashed potatoes to go on top- who can use the fake stuff?? For seasonings add Worcestershire, camp mix and rosemary. The rosemary is my favorite add.

My husband said this was the best he ever had. I did add a 1/2 cup of each corn and peas, and some portabell mushrooms. Used yucon gold for the potatoes. Did cook for about 30 min. for the pie crust to done. Could have stayed in a few minutes longer. He's passing this to his mom to make .

I have made this shepherds pie several times. I double the recipe but only use a half an onion, only because I dont like onions. I also use canned peas and corn. I place shredded cheese on top of the mashed potatoes and then biscuits on top of that. The leftovers seem to last forever because this is so filling.

Thus turned out great! I tweaked it a bit by doubling the ketchup, adding some dried basil & a little flour to the ground beef before adding the soup. I used packaged instant potatoes (the just add water & mix kind). But I added cream cheese, sour cream & shredded cheese into the potatoes & mixed well before spreading on top & baking. Served it with a little brown gravy. Perfect!! And easy!

Just made this for dinner, and it came out great! Some changes I made:  I added Dijon mustard instead of ketchup, I also added minced garlic and garlic salt to the ground beef to add some flavor. I did have to make two batches of instant potatoes, I didn't seem to have enough to spread on top. Would make again.

I used real potatoes.  I added Worschestire sauce, garlic powder and thyme to the meat mixture along with the salt and pepper and a little garlic powder to the mashed potatoes for extra flavor.    I used a frozen veg mix with peas, carrots, corn, green beans and i let it cook in the meat mixture about 10 minutes before putting everything in the oven for 15.  Broiled for 5 minutes at end.  It makes a really savory sauce.  The family loves this dish.

It's a great start, and I appreciate it! My husband and oldest son couldn't stop reaching for more servings.

I think it needs more seasoning. Maybe garlic powder? 

I used frozen corn and canned beans instead of the veggie mix, and leftover real mashed potatoes instead of the flakes.

Great basic Shepards pie recipe! Had to alter it a bit though, made it with mixed veggie's and real mashed potatoes it was very good. I've had real shepard's pie with lamb, i'm not a fan of lamb, but I love the simplicity  of this meal and i'ts good wholesome comfort food!

Changed a few things... Used cream of chicken soup instead of mushrooms, and used corn instead of carrots. Also added garlic, a teaspoon of thyme and a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. Then, I put mozzarella cheese on top.  It did not brown, so I put it under the broiler for 5 mins...

Super easy and super tasty. I used corn instead of peas and carrots and I doubled the instant potatoes because I wanted a thicker layer of potatoes. I also added a little shredded cheddar cheese between the meat and potato layer and sprinkled a little on top of the potatoes. It was delicious and a family favorite even with my 1 and 4 year olds!

I have made this twice.  Kids & husband like it pretty well.  I usually use the whole bag of peas & carrots and a can of green beans. I don't use the potato flakes either.  Real potatoes are always better.  It is good for left over ones, or I plan ahead and just make extra when I make them the time before.   Easy, good option for ground beef.

Excellent and very easy. Hearty meal. Inexpensive also. May use pre-made mash potatoes next time. Definitely will be on my regular meal schedule. I substituted corn, carrots, small green beans and peas for carrots and peas. Very colorful. May want a little more juice in the meat portion.

I browned ground turkey with garlic, salt, pepper and a red onion - we always season our meat this way and we generally use ground turkey as it's healthier but tastes about the same as ground beef. I used peas, corn, and carrots and my family couldn't get enough! My 5 year old asked me to make this for dinner again tonight! Next time I'll be doubling the recipe so there's leftovers for the kids and my husband. Thanks for sharing!

I have made a version before with real potatoes, I made this one out of convenience. If you use instant potatoes, follow the recipe on the box of potatoes. This was good for something quick and easy, but I prefer the real potatoes.

This was so easy and delicious! I used instant mashed potatoes and just cooked them according to the package, so I didn't use the milk or butter. Added a little cheddar on top!

This was extremely yummy! I used green beans instead of the peas since I didn't have any--I was very happy with the turnout. Instead of the instant potatoes, I made them by scratch. Which is just a preference thing but it was delicious! I also used ground venison instead of ground beef. All in all, I was happy with everything. My husband even liked it!

My family loves this recipe! I make it about once every 2 weeks. Easy to make and fast for those nights when you do not have a lot of time. I always use prepared mashed potatoes, not instant. For the last couple of minutes, I turn the oven to broil to get the brown crisp edges just right on the potatoes. Great dinner, great leftovers.

The result was okay. It was a quick and easy meal, but not as flavorful as I expected; I agree that some addition of salt would have improved this, along with a few other herbs and spices. I'll continue to look for a better shepherd's pie recipe.

Followed other suggestions and added salt, garlic powder and worcestershire during browning.  Sprinkled with Montreal Steak seasoning before putting on potatoes.  Also made regular mashed potatoes for the topping.  Even my little kids liked it - and they are NOT very adventurous!

This is always a hit at dinner time around our house, especially as it gets colder outside. We'll usually vary the vegetables a little bit--adding in corn, or even squash--but the end result is always filling. For those of you concerned about using instant mashed potatoes instead of legitimate mashed potatoes, don't be--once everything bakes and browns in the oven, it's difficult to tell the difference at all.

This is quite comforting and good - the hubby LOVED it. I wish it were a little beefier, but didn't want to add anything else processed to the dish. Had a ton of mashed potatoes left over and used that but followed the rest of the recipe as is, adding baby bella mushrooms. Definitely a good version of this classic.

Followed all directions except I used 2 lbs of ground chuck 80/20 and didn't have hardly any fat at all to drain.  Also I used a Lipton onion soup packet in place of the chopped whole onion and it gave the entire dish a much richer flavor.  Instead of peas and carrots I used an 8 oz bag of garlic sauced baby peas and mushrooms and added in a can of drained carrots.  I also doubled the amount of instant mashed potato flakes and used instant potato buds which made it a little stiffer mashed potato topping.The only thing I would have done differently is to have added garlic powder and or chopped garlic to the potato flakes for an extra kick of flavor!  :-)

Awesome pantry dinner and ready in a jiffy.  I got caught without ground beef or an onion, so I used a 12 oz. can of roast beef and some dried onion.  Followed the rest of the recipe and put  it all together right in the 10" pie plate, with a little grated cheddar on top.

I was concerned the can of soup without any other liquid wouldn't make enough gravy, but it came out bubbling hot throughout the pie and just the right consistency.

This was so fast I barely had enough time to reboot the dishwasher before the pie was out of the oven and ready to eat.

My hubs concurs with the others:  "It's a keeper!"

This was a good tasting recipe, however the mushroom soup, in my mind, changes it from shepherd's pie to a hot dish. I doubled the mashed potatoes as a single helping didn't cover the beef in my pie plate.

I made this and used broccoli, peas, and corn. Next time I'll follow the potato flake directions  because I thought the 1 cup of milk to the 1 & 1/3 cup potatoes ratio made the potatoes to lumpy. After I worked out that obstacle, I added cheese.  Ended up delish.

This recipe is simple comfort food. I love it.
The best part for me is that I can get almost all the ingredients from a local farmers' market in January (and I live in New Hampshire!).
I used real local potatoes. Other fresh local ingredients include: grass fed beef, onions, garlic, and carrots. I snuck a few Brussels sprouts in there too ;)

I really liked this recipe, even though I did think the ketchup was a tad weird.  It all worked though!  I mix it up some times when I make this by using corn, peas, carrots or green beans.  My son and husband love it.

I made some changes: Real mashed instead of spuds. I used corn and peas, and didn't add the ketchup (I honestly forgot). It was yummy, my 16 month old son LOVED it, and very picky husband! 

I also seasoned the ground beef as it was cooking with garlic powder, Italian herbs, and pepper. Same with the mashed potatoes.

This was fantastic!!!! I made this when I was sick with a cold and wanting some comfort food- it was so easy I was back on the couch in about 20 minutes! I used Simply Potatoes (the garlic kind) instead of the instant and also added a handful or two of shredded cheddar. My boyfriend says this is his new favorite- will definitely make again and again!!!

I used cream of celery soup because my hubby does not like mushrooms, added some garlic per another user's suggestion and half a can of cream style corn (I meant to use regular corn, but bought the wrong kind). I also made my own mashed potatoes. It's in the oven right now and I can't wait to dig in after tasting the meat mixture before baking :-)

We served this for a church event, and got rave reviews.  Folks came back for 2nd and 3rd helpings.    
However, crowd-sizing the recipe using the tool provided resulted in almost twice as much food as was needed.  I believe the original recipe would serve 6 - 8 people, not the 4 as suggested.

Well, I just made this dish for my family for the first time. It was a hit, even my 6 yr. old enjoyed it and he's a hard one to please. I did make a few changes to the recipe. I added shredded cheddar cheese and increased the ketchup to a 1/4 cup.

Followed the recipe except we used real potatoes. My gf and I found it a little bland but all in all eatable. Not sure we'd make it again though, were probably going to try a different recipe next time.

I doubled the recipe to serve 8 and added finely chopped zucchini and celery to the vegetable mixture.  Everyone liked it, including the kids!

I made this for my family the last TWO nights because they loved it so much. The only thing I did differently was make my instant mashed potatoes beforehand, with A LOT more milk. It also sat in the oven longer, probably because the potatoes were creamier. Wonderful, easy recipe!

I made this according to the recipe but used homemade mashed potatoes and added a little Worcestershire sauce.  I enjoyed it very much.  Next time I will omit the ketchup and perhaps use french onion soup instead.  Very quick and tasty, though.

This was great! My picky husband loved it. I had leftover mashed potatoes so this was the inspiration. I didn't have any meat so instead used veggie burgers mashed up. I didn't have creamed soup so instead used 1 can of evaporated milk mixed with a cube of chicken bouillon and a tablespoon of corn starch. I added frozen corn with the peas and carrots too and forgot to add the butter. It still turned out great!

Great!  I added some cheese and left over bacon bits to the top which dressed it up a bit and was delicious!

Great Recipe considering that I don't cook too often but I added in my own twists: no ketchup added Used own seasoning instead of black pepper to make it tastier  I made a quick flour crust (flour, veg oil , milk) to place at the bottom of the pan, instead of frozen vegetables I added a can of vegetables, and I made the mashed potatoes from scratch w/milk, butter and a dash of garlic to add to the top.   I topped the mashed potatoes with cheese.   Really enjoyed this dish.

I thought Shepherd's Pie would be too complicated for this meat & potato cook.  But I was wrong.  I used leftover carrots and corn, added garlic and a little rosemary that i had in the freezer and threw some cheese on the top.  My other half had 2 helpings and is thinking he should have some more.    And he's the skinny one.  Oh well.
