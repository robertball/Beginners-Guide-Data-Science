These are so easy to make, and I really loved the addition of fresh thyme in this version! These turn out so dainty and elegant. I baked mine on a silicone baking mat, and then removed to a paper towel lined baking rack after about 3 minutes to finish the cooling. I recommend the paper towel, as they can be somewhat greasy. Just helps to remove some of the excess grease. I'll be using these to top our caesar salad tonight for dinner! Thanks for the recipe!

I've been working on variations of this all afternoon since my husband loves crispy Parmesan crackers and I think I've perfected it! Add at least 1 Tbs. flour for a cup of cheese (this soaks up the liquid from the melted cheese and the crackers won't be crispy without it).  Spread out as thin as you can and bake at 400 for two minutes, then switch to broil until they are as golden as you like (I did 1-1/2 minutes). Watch like a hawk cause they'll burn fast! Use a new sheet of parchment paper for each batch, otherwise you'll smoke up your kitchen! And don't use cooking spray, there's no need for it .:)

Simple and delicious. You can easily add a slightly different flavor by changing the thyme to cracked pepper, parsley or whatever you love.

They were very tasty but they never got to crunchy status, just on the edges. And I cooked them longer than the recipe for crispness. I'll keep trying. It's worth it.

Simple and easy to make. I also added garlic powder and some red pepper flakes. A tiny bit hotter than I expected, but very good. Will make again for sure.
