Mauigirl is right this recipe does not turn out well with the adjustments AR has done. Here is the original recipe I submitted: 
Ingredients 1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of onion soup 1/2 pkg Lipton onion soup mix 1pkg roast beef gravy mix (4.5 ounces will give you the best results) 1 1/2 pounds ground beef 1/2 cup dry panko bread crumbs 1 egg  1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/2 cup water 2 tablespoons ketchup 1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder
Directions
1. In a large bowl, mix together 1/3 cup cream of onion with ground beef, 1/4th pkg lipton soup mix, panko bread crumbs, egg, salt and black pepper. Shape into 6 oval patties.
2. In an electric skillet set temp to 225, brown both sides of patties. Pour off excess fat.
3. In a small saucepan prepare brown gravy mix according to package directions. In a small bowl combine ketchup, water, Worcestershire sauce remaining lipton mix, cream of onion soup and mustard powder. Add mixture to finished brown gravy and mix well. Pour over meat in skillet. Cover, and simmer for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.

My family LOVED this recipe. I didn't add the cream of onion soup, ketchup or dry mustard powder. Being from the Louisiana, I added onions, green peppers and celery plus a small amount of Cajun seasoning to the recipe and served over rice versus mashed potatoes. It was fantastic! The best Salisbury steak I have served in a long time. I have been searching for a recipe that would be a good foundation for my meal, and this one certainly fit the bill. Thank you for a dish that is destined to become a family favorite.

This was so delicious. I didn't have an electric skillet so i browned the patties in a skillet and them put them in my crock pot. I cooked on high for about three hours, until meat reached the temperature it needed to be. I also didn't use all of the can of cream of onion soup...i halved it wherever it was called for.
