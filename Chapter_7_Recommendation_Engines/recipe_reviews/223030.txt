I thought this was super fast and easy and packed with flavor! My daughter thought in the second step adding a little more honey might make it even better. Probably be really good served with rice and fresh pineapple.

Very tasty!  My husband isn't as much of a fan of the lemony seasonings, so I was looking for something different.  He loves Asian food anyway, so it was a hit!  I did pound my chicken breasts so that they were an even thickness for even cooking on the grill.  I also quickly pricked some holes in the breasts before pouring the first mixture on them hoping it would seep more flavor in during the short time it sat.  I honestly don't know if that helped, but I followed the recipe exactly, and we loved it!!

Loved this chicken recipe. I thought the marinade was going to be too strong but it wasn't at all. Very tasty!  Will definitely be a regular at our house!

I didn't expect much from this recipe but it was really tasty. I did double the marinade for 3lbs of chicken and tripled the baste. I marinaded the chicken for about 3 hrs too. Will make again!

I just made this and the whole family, including my picky eater, LOVED IT! This recipe is staying in my favorites. I had to substitute corn syrup for the honey, but it didn't make any difference as far as I could tell.

Have made it twice. The second time I didn’t put in as much red pepper as a toddler was eating with us. Both times it was very tasty.

Nice quick and easy marinade for grilled chicken. I served it with a bagged Asian salad from the grocery store. Very tasty!

Extremely easy and turned out well.  I had to substitute lemon juice for lime and bet it would be even better as written.  Nothing earth-shattering but high deliciousness for ease of effort, time, and ingredients.  Served it over Costco's "Asian Cashew" salad mix.

Wary that just two people had rated this recipe, I threw caution to the wind and gave it a whirl because it was one of the few recipes for which I had all the ingredients, and I was too lazy to go to the store to purchase celery.  This recipe is OK in a pinch.  It is nothing special.  I ended up slicing it up and putting it in a wrap with lettuce, peppers, and ranch dressing.  That made it much better!
