Thanks for the clever idea, Krystle!  Instead of candies, I used frosting for decoration (thick mixture patted into shapes of cheese, tomatoes, and pickles).  And no frosting on the cake layers, since they look like a burger without.

Though I modified the recipe, the idea gets five stars.  The kids and adults loved it!

This cake was a HIT with six year olds.  The only problem that I ran into was when I was cutting into the cake with the candy tomatoes, lettuce and cheese (fruit roll-ups and Starbursts).  You might want to either use a thick frosting or remove the insides before cutting.  Another thing I discovered...when I baked the brownie I wanted it to be a bit smaller then the bun, so I cut the edge off first.  This really made it look like ground beef.  I will make this again, it was easier then I thought.

What an adorable idea!  I made this cake for a school function where the children got to select cakes as prizes.  Not only did I receive many compliments as I carried the cake down the hallway, but it was also one of the first ones chosen!  I can't vouch for how it tastes since I didn't eat it, but it was very easy to make.  I simplified the recipe by omitting the "bacon," wrapping whole vanilla wafers (instead of halves) in fruit leather, using yellow fruit leather for the "cheese," instead of fruit-flavored candy, and using yellow and red decorator icing for the "mustard" and "ketchup."  I also cut the green fruit leather in strips to look like shredded lettuce.  By the way, my local grocery store sells boxes of fruit leather in primary colors, but they have "tongue tattoos" on them.  I felt that the tattoos weren't that noticeable and were pretty easy to hide under the bun.

This was a fun cake to make! A little stressful in the beginning because I didn't have any brown food coloring for the bun, so I used a little chocolate frosting in the vanilla frosting. I also used some green dye in the coconut flakes for lettuce and only did the ketchup and mustard. For the seeds on top of the bun, I used slivered almonds. Brought on great excitement in my son's classroom.

Made this for son's 9th bday party...per reviews, used the peanut butter frosting and it was yummy. Used a golden vanilla cake for the "bun" and made a brownie in a pie pan for the "patty." Since reviews said the colored candies made it too hard to cut, I only used green candy slices, rolled out and put around the edge for lettuce, and red candy slices, rolled out and used a small cup to make round slices for "tomatoes." Used a bread knife to slice. All the kids LOVED this recipe! Great presentation.

AWESOME! I made it for my sons 12th birthday and everyone thought it was a real cheeseburger! I made the brownie in a round cake pan the same as the bun bottom, and I did not have any caramels or fruit roll ups. I used starbursts (microwaved for 10 seconds and flattened with buttered fingers) for the tomato and cheese, and icing as the lettuce. very good and very rich

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  I cut some corners and didn't put ketchup or mustard on it, just lettuce, tomatoes and cheese with fruit rollups.  No idea how it tastes, but the kids think I'm a genius!

I had so much fun making this cake!  I didn't really go by the instructions though...just took it as more of an idea to base mine on as I wanted to make it super easy and not so sugary (low fat burger?).  I used one box of golden cake split into 2 round pans for the bun.  One box of choc cake put into a square pan and then cut into a circle for the patty.  As others suggested, this makes it look more like meat, with the rough edge.  i should have put it in a rectangular pan though b/c I think the burger turned out too thick.  I thought the bun looked better without icing plus I didn't want a super sweet cake.  I used kiwi fruit (lettuce), strawberries (tomatoes) and mango slices (cheese).  Important to blot the fruit dry so they won't slide out and I should have cut them thinner too so they wouldn't slip as much.  I used a container of vanilla icing (mayo) on each side in between the burger and bun on each side to hold everything together.  I put a little icing on each Rice Krispy to make the sesame seeds as I saw someone else do on here.  My boyfriend says the sesame seeds are the thing that makes it look so great.  I brought it over to my friend's BBQ and it was a SMASH HIT.  This cake makes people happy.  My next plan is to make sliders!  ;0)

Very good idea!  I made a few changes: No frosting on the "bun", instead I used cream cheese frosting to look like mayonnaise. No "tomatoes". Instead of using candy for lettuce, I used shredded coconut.  I mixed coconut, green food coloring and just a few drops of water to dye it. It looks wonderful!

I followed the recipe for the cake "buns" and brownie "burger". I used a fondant recipe for the lettuce, tomato, cheese, Tic Tacs for the "seeds" and I mixed store bought frosting to make the colors for the bun and burger. My son LOVED this cake for his birthday and he is 14! It is VERY rich, so make the pieces small!

Used peanut butter icing for the roll. The perfect color. Made for husband's bday, a huge hamburger fan. Loved the idea of brownie for burger.

This was a great recipe.  I made this for my son's birthday that happens to be on April fool's day!  I did make a couple of changes.  I couldn't find green fruit leather so I used coconut dyed with a touch of green food coloring and I thought the "buns" looked more natural unfrosted!  I hope my son likes this!

This was a fun cake to make/present.   I used a 9 inch round pan for both the bottom cake and the brownie. I found that I needed to cut the edges off the brownie so that it fit nicely on the bun.

Super easy!!!! I work in a restaurant that specializes in Gourmet Burgers and it was a huge hit. When I make this again, I will ice the layers separately to make it easier.  The only difficulty I had was getting the coloring right! It was fun to make!

As with lots of cakes like this, this one doesn't taste particularly good.  A brownie sandwiched between two layers of yellow cake is a little odd.  However, it was very easy to put together, and my 10 year old step-daughter thought it was a great birthday cake.  Everyone raved about how much it really looked like a cheeseburger.  Personally, I don't think the icing is needed for the "bun" because it looks enough like a bun without it.  And my icing turned a weird orange color.  Overall, it's 5 stars for looks and 3 stars for taste, which averages out to a 4.

This cake was super easy to make! I did have some trouble getting the starbursts candy to melt & come off in one piece of the wax paper (so we did without the cheese) also, we used crushed up white chocolate chips for the sesame seeds :) Made this for my big brothers 33rd birthday, everyone loved it!

The cake was a lot of fun to make and delicious as well.  We used the homemade peanut butter icing; colored white icing for the ketchup and mustard; a melted rolled out yellow starburst for the cheese; a warmed up fruit roll-up for the lettuce, and the tomato was a Nilla wafer wrapped in a fruit roll-up; the sesame seeds were Rice Krispies.

I have not made this cake yet but a simply genius idea. Altho I think making homemade yellow cake mix would really improve the flavor.

This cake takes the cake!  It was fun to make with the kids and looked great.  The birthday party guests were amazed (7 year olds).  5 star for presentation.
