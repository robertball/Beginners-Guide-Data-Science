I made the recipe as written. It was very good. Next time I will either omit the white sugar or cut down on the hoisin. It was too sweet for me. I served it with the Peanut Sauce II from this site. I reheated the leftovers and served it over an iceberg wedge - I liked that even better. The crunch and moisture of the iceberg really plays nicely with the heat of the chicken. I will make it again.

This was really good..made a few changes I couldn't find hoisin sauce so I substitued it was honey turned out great.  I served with Thai-style peanut sauce with honey which is a recipe on the site and that finished it well....

I made this tonight for a group of teens and it was a huge hit!  I made only minor adjustments to the recipe.  I used a little more garlic and a lot more basil.  I didn't have ginger root on hand so used a scant 1/2 tsp of ground ginger plus a pinch of cayenne.  I used a 10-oz. bag of finely shredded coleslaw cabbage and added two shredded carrots.  For wrapping, I offered both lettuce leaves and flour tortillas.  We used the Taste of Thai peanut sauce mix (made with coconut milk).  This was absolutely delicious and fun to eat.

This was pretty good. I used the recipe for Asian Coleslaw on this site instead of the packaged mix, and the recipe for hot peanut sauce instead of the store bought kind. I also added some green onions and parsley to the sauce and I used whole wheat wraps instead of wrapping in lettuce, but put lettuce inside the wraps.

This was tasty, but it was the absolute messiest meal I've ever served.  There was an enormous amount of liquid in this dish.  The recipe says to simmer 10 minutes until the liquid is absorbed.  Absorbed by what?  There is no rice or pasta or anything else to absorb this liquid.  The cabbage just wilted away to nothing and I'm sure contributed to the soupiness.  We scooped out the chicken and wilted cabbage with a slotted spoon to place some on a lettuce leaf, but it was impossible to eat this way.  The juice ran down my chin and my arm and got all over everything. We used up 4 paper towels cleaning up our faces, arms and plates.  I finally just cut up the rest of the lettuce and put the chicken on top to make a salad.  It was still a runny mess.  This was very tasty, but I'm not sure I'd make it again without some major changes.  Thanks for letting me try.

My husband and I loved this.  Followed all except the hoisin sauce, which I cannot eat.  I added a little more sugar to make up the difference. We used romaine lettuce and the peanut sauce II recipe from this site.  Will definitely go back to this for an easy, delicious and healthy dinner.  Thanks gztg44!!

These were absolutely delicious!  I added more ginger and followed others with some green onions.  My biggest challenge was getting the lettuce leaves off without breaking them.  Might tr different lettuce leaves in the future.  Omit the sugar too.

I made these to take to work so instead of lettuce leaves, I used whle wheat tortillas . They froze well and reheated just fine.  I made my own lower cal version of peanut sauce and it was yummy with this recipe.

Really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I added is some sliced green onions... I bought a rotisserie chicken at Costco, they are usually pretty big so I have leftovers which is great, we love leftovers. Im sure it  will be excellent after the flavors marry further. I will definitely make this again!!

Delicious...omitted the sugar (you do not need it).  Already had thawed chicken breast out so I just cooked and shredded it, but I will try with rotisserie next time.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  Thanks!

This was great exactly as written.  No need to change a thing!  We all loved it. UPDATE : We tried adding crispy wonton strips just a little on the top of the meat then roll it - and OH MAN - PERFECT!!!!!

These were very tastey!  I don't think you even need the peanut sauce, as they were so well seasoned with the hoisen and soy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great chicken mixture. The green leaf lettuce was ok, but I prefer Boston lettuce or Bibb lettuce, which is a little sweeter. Romaine lettuce could also substitute in a pinch.

This was delicious.  I suggest leaving the coleslaw mix  separate and just adding to the wrap cold.  This way they are less drippy/sticky so you don't get your hands as messy eating them.

This recipe was fabulous! I used prepared coleslaw instead of the coleslaw mix and sugar and half of the vinegar, and it still turned out delicious. Will make again!

We loved this recipe. The chicken mixture didn't turn out very saucy, I may have used too much or not enough of something. I also omitted the fresh ginger, because I didn't have any and don't prefer the taste. Great recipe!

These were great. I had 2-legs/thighs left from a rotisserie chicken so reduced the serving size to two.  Easy and delicious. Only modification was I left out the sugar as I don't like things too sweet. I used Boston lettuce for the wraps.  Will probably make again.

This was great! I ran out of soy sauce so I only added about 1/8 cup. No hoisin sauce either and used ground ginger. I only had about half a small rotisserie chicken left for the recipe. Because of the limited amount of sauce I had, my chicken didnt have any liquid left over, but was very flavorful. Cant wait to try again with all the ingredients. My thought is that hoisin plus the sugar would be too sweet though.

Great - husband gave 10 stars!  Will make again!  I did add more of the "seasoning" ingredients and added red pepper flakes to spice it up (personal preference).  Very good and easy to make!!!  Thanks for sharing!

Tasty and super easy. I will make these again.  Next time I plan to add water chestnuts and the crunchy white things that they serve on asian lettuce wraps at the restaurants.

These tasted good.  Having them in the lettuce was quite messy though.  If I make again I will try something else.

Very Tasty! Reminds me of a Terriaki dish.  I used Morning Star vegetarian chicken strips with spinach and placed in tortilla wraps.  This tasted just as good without the peanut sauce, but it is a good addition.  I will definitely make this again and try it over rice!

These lettuce wraps are so good! I altered a bit as follows: I made the sauce separately (and made 1.5 x the amount of sauce) before adding it to chicken/slaw mix, used poached chicken breasts which really soaked up the sauce, added a can of water chestnuts, some crushed red pepper flakes for heat, and served chicken mixture over jasmine rice to make it a bit more hearty. Also, I just added the peanut sauce to the chicken mixture instead of having it as a side. Bibb lettuce works best in my opinion. Thank you!

This was way too sweet. I will probably make again without the sugar. I used leftover chicken thighs, broccoli slaw and tortilla wraps.

The flavors did not combine well and was too soupy.

I've already made this twice.  It was awesome and will become a regular "week night" meal for my family.   It is just as good as PF Changs!   Per  other reviews, I used honey instead of hoisin.

Up the hoisin, lose the sugar, and maybe some scallions or water chestnuts next time. Be sure the deep fry some rice angel hair sized noodles for crunch! I fried mine in coconut oil and they puff up in seconds as you crumble then into the oil set on medium.

Didn't like this at all.  Way too much hoisin sauce for my taste.  Suggest adding the slaw mix at the end to avoid it turning to mush.

I made it exactly as listed and it was awesome. You do have to pick your lettuce carfully to get the best wraps.

This recipe is a 4.5 and a keeper.  I used soy-ginger flavored, diced chicken thighs.  I added water chestnuts and red pepper flakes.  I halved the sugar and served over white rice.  Very tasty.  Next time I'll add the coleslaw at the last minute to keep the crunch.

So good! Some other reviewers said the hoisin was a little sweet so I reduced it to 1/4 c and it was perfect.  I thought the chicken mixture was the perfect consistency and not too runny.  Oh and I had rice vinegar on hand so I used that instead of white vinegar.

I did make some changes as to how it was served.  I used inspiration from a wrap I've had at a local restaurant.  I added Jasmine rice and crispy Asain noodles and served it in a spinach tortilla shell instead of lettuce.  If the meat mixture is too runny the rice will help soak it up.

My husband and son really liked but I thought it was a little too sweet. I might cut down a little on the hoisin sauce and sugar.

Very good recipe to start with. I had leftover chicken breast and pork loin so I minced both for the recipe. I used juice of one lime instead of vinegar and minced a small sweet onion to add to the mix. I added the slaw mix at the last minute so the cabbage would stay crunchy. Excellent!

Just made these tonight and my husband and I loved them!  Yes, they can be messy but totally worth it.  We decided that garnishing with chopped peanuts and a little green onion would make them even better.

I have made these for countless parties and everyone always devours every last bit. I brown a package of ground chicken and lightly season it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then make the rest of the recipe as directed. Many times I’ve made it the day before, stored it in the fridge in a round casserole dish with a lid, then heated it in the microwave right before party time. This actually gives the flavors more time to mingle. I always serve with butter lettuce as the leaves are the perfect size.
