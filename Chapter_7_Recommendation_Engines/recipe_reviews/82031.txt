I thought this was very good. Although the texture is obviously different, to me it tasted very much like cornbread. I used honey instead of the sugar to sweeten. Nice breakfast on a cold morning. Thanks!

I don't know if it's fair for me to give this any star rating at all because my dislike of this may not actually be the recipe's fault. But they require you to give it some stars now, so I guess I will rate it in the middle. I just thought it was way too sweet. Some people might like that though, and otherwise, the texture was good. You may want to lay off the additional sugar if you're concerned about it being too sweet and just get your sweetness from the jam alone.

I love this as a warm breakfast. I leave out the sourcream as I didn't have any the first time I made it, so now I just don't bother. I have used blueberry jam and Cherry as well. I think any jam would go great with this. PS-my 18 month old love it, too (and I skip the jam for him).

I was really hoping to love this, as we're always looking for new things to add to our breakfast choices, but it just wasn't quite what we were looking for.  Maybe I've just grown up with WAY too sugar in my oatmeal (this seriously could be the case) but I would have liked this cereal to be much sweeter than it was, even with extra sugar added and the jam on top!  We might try it one more time with quite a lot more sugar... which is terrible to say! - but I'm not sure.  If you don't like things that are super sweet, this might be right up your alley though.

Thought I'd give this a try and did. Texture was nice. Flavor was OK. Toppings improved the overall taste. Standing in one spot for over 30 minutes stiring and stiring for an OK result somehow detracts from the overall rating.

My husband really liked this.  I'm not a big fan of breakfast porridges, but even I thought this was pretty good.  I served it with raspberry jam and sweetened sour cream.  Without those, I wasn't a huge fan but with the toppings, yum!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great. I used Splenda instead of sugar (3 packets) and used 2 cups of each of water and milk instead of 3. Just dandy.

Other than cutting the recipe in half, I made this as directed.  I thought this was yummy and a nice alternative to my normal oatmeal.  I did leave out the sweetened cream topping, though, as I thought it was sweet enough with the jam.  Thanks.

Yum. Like porridge without the weird texture. Liked it. Next time will try the sweetened sour cream.

I was just making this for myself so I reduced it to a third of the portions, and it was delicious!  Rather than the sour cream and jam I topped it with some real maple syrup.  Absolutely delicious!  Thank you!
