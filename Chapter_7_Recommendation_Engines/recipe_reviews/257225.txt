Unfortunately, no one in my house liked this. I thought it was very tasty up until the créme fraiche was added. It overpowered the flavor of everything.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

I added a finely chopped onion, sautéed at the beginning before the other veggies went in, also used the whole package (8 ounces) of cream fraiche, and used four cans of fire roasted tomatoes, 2 tbsp italian seasonings, 1 tablespoon oregano and 1/2 tablespoon of thyme.  I put in 1.5 cups of vegetable broth, and simmered for almost four hours....
