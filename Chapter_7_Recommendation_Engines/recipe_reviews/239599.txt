Fantastic recipe. I made some substitutions to make this real-food friendly: I used 100& whole wheat flour fresh squeezed orange juice 2 whole eggs subbed organic sunflower oil for the almond milk and left out the brown sugar. I added the zest of 1 orange. Very good. Plenty sweet without the extra sugar. I will continue to make this recipe and experiment with different juices nuts and spices!
