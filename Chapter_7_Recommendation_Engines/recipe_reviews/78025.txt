This is great with a few changes...one small onion is plenty and use maybe do with extra carrots- a 1 1/2 lb instead- and try it w/ real cream!  Used about 2 tsp fresh ginger, grated, rather than the crystalized. Very tasty- and just what I was looking for!!

This was a great soup - up to the point that I added the last two ingredients at which point it stopped being ginger carrot soup and became cream of orange juice soup. Not that I have a problem with oj - except maybe as a soup.  It's still a good recipe as written but I really couldn't taste the carrot. Next time I'll skip the juice -maybe play with doubling the chicken broth and then decide if I want to add the fat-free half&half after pureeing.

I loved this recipe. I used 2 lbs of carrots and a little more stock so I would have some left over to freeze. I omitted the cinnamon, OJ and half & half as not to lose the carrot taste.

This is a tasty soup! I did make a few changes, however: 1 onion instead of 2, used a liberal amount of "pumpkin spice" instead of just cinnamon (pumpkin spice = cinnamon, nutmeg, and something else?), added one tsp. of salt, fresh ginger instead of candied, two dashes of cayenne pepper for spice, the juice of one fresh navel orange instead of OJ, and lastly, I used 1/4 cup real whipping cream and a little bit of skim milk.

I will definitely make this again! Be sure to blend it well; the end result is better than at some of the top restaurants I've eaten in!

This was okay.  I like the flavor the juice gives the soup, but it definitely overpowered the carrots and ginger.  I agree with a previous review about this being 'orange juice soup'.  I might make this again, but not without changes to bring this back to 'ginger carrot soup'.

Two onions is too many for this recipe. Mine came out very oniony, overpowering the carrot taste. I suggest adding just one onion. Also, while the cinnamon adds a nice touch of flavor, the brown-tinted spice discolors the soup. Mine went from a deep hearty orange to an unappetizing ochre after the addition.

Wish I'd read the reviews first. My instincts said that the oj would overpower it and it did. How can so many rate this 4 stars, then change the recipe so much?

Yummy!  Served it cold with garlic chives sprinkled on top.  I did cut the OJ to 1/4 cup which I think helped to emphasize the other flavors.

I make a similar carrot soup to this but only 1 onion and cut orange juice (fresh) back to half a cup.  Also add some grated orange rind before serving. This way the orange does not overpower the other flavors.

I don't know what I could have done to make this recipe less then a 1 star. With the ingredients that we all like, but something went terribly wrong, It couldn't have been any worse. A waste of good food.

I liked this recipe, but I did change a lot about it. Instead of cutting up my vegetables, I pureed them in my blender (I wanted a creamy soup without chunks). I didnt use actual chicken broth. Instead I used 1 1/2 cup of half and half. I replaced the chicken broth with chicken broth flavoring, using one teaspoon. The orange juice idea scared me, so I only added about 1/4 cup of orange juice. I also ended up adding more cinnamon. But this is a great recipe to follow if you know what you are doing and you love adding extras!

Good start but I also chose to elminate the OJ and right before serving I added fresh ground pepper.

I'm a huge fan of butternut squash type soups, and I found this to be a yummy, comfort-food recipe.   Per other reviews, I only added 1 Tbsp of OJ, and that added plenty of orange flavor.  I also reduced the half and half to 1/2 cup, and only used one yellow onion. I used regular 1/2 and 1/2, and fresh grated ginger.  It was creamy and delicious! Make sure to puree in the blender well, so you get a creamy texture.  I will most likely make this again.

I liked this soup well enough, but my family was not particularly impressed. I didn't use OJ but rather peeled and quartered 2 seedless oranges and cooked them along with the carrots (removing their remnants before pureeing the soup). I also used 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and heavy cream rather than Half and Half. I used chicken boullion cubes to make my broth (3 cubes to 2 cups of water) and fresh ginger, grated. I did use 2 onions, but think, perhaps, 1 or 1-1/2 even would have been better. Overall, a "successful" recipe but not the best this site (or my personal recipe box) has to offer.

I served this for a group of friends and it was a great hit. Even their little one year old loved it. It was a little too gingery for my taste though.

This was ok, not the best ever, but still quite good served its purpose. Mine came out more like spicy clumpy orange juice than carrot soup. I think maybe less juice more milk/broth and it may turn out better.(I subsituted low fat milk for the cream.)

I only used 1/2 of 1 onion. When it was done, it was completely overpowered by the orange juice taste, so I cooked another carrot in some broth, pureed it,  and added it in to get the carrot flavor back again! 
Very tasty after tweaking!

Yummy recipe. I topped with a dollop of sour cream sprinkled with ground nutmeg. This is a great soup for those cold nights.
