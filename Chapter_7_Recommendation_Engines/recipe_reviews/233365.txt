I made this dish according to the recipe except for leaving out the walnuts and raisins and I loved it! The combination of seasonings and flavors was delicious, the goat cheese was just the right topping and I found it very filling. I used two small bell peppers so had some of the filling left over. I put it over hummus and it was great that way as well. I will definitely make this dish again.

I wanted to add a comment to my earlier review... I first made this a few years ago when my vegetarian daughter and soon-to-be step-daughter were visiting us. As they are both vegetarian I try to find some new recipes to try when they are around. This was so good that I decided to use it for a dish at our wedding to offer something substantial for our vegetarian/vegan guests. I gave the recipe to our caterer and he made it, leaving the goat cheese aside as a topping (a courtesy for the vegan crowd). It turned out pretty good except that he used GREEN peppers instead of red or orange! (Probably less expensive) Noooo... it’s just not the same! You MUST use red or orange peppers. If I had tried this with green the first time I would not have been as impressed. The taste is just not right. This recipe is perfect as is. Don’t change it.

Used shelled pistachios, chopped up... with some fine ground walnuts (1 tsp), black beans instead of chick peas. Used a few blueberries, in place of raisin. Cooked the quinoa, in vegetable broth instead of water (as always).  Slice of provolone cheese on top of the pepper half. (last 10 minutes of oven time). Tasted very good.

The recipe said 2 peppers but the shopping list said 3. Three was perfect and the flavours were fantastic. I will make this again when company is coming for dinner.

Absolutely delicious!  I also used cranberries instead of raisins and it turned out wonderful!  It's flavourful and really easy to make.  This is going to be a regular meal for us.

This is a very good recipe.  The proportions are correct and it has a good flavor.  I liked it because it is a little different from what you usually see with green peppers.

Surprisingly good!  Nice change of pace from our usual side dishes.  I liked the blend of cinnamon and goat cheese in this.

I was looking for a unique side to take to a BBQ.  I made the recipe up to the point of stuffing the peppers.  I then diced the red peppers and added them to the mix.  I refrigerated the salad overnight.   I had hummus and goat cheese in separate containers so guests could assemble as they liked: hummus, salad on top with goat cheese to  top it off.   It paired very well with the grilled salmon.  Ultimate compliment-  salad was gone within the first hour.   There were 12 adults at the BBQ.

Even with added cheese and spices this recipe turned out bland and was not a favourite. I will not make this again.

I don't know why it only calls for 2 peppers because i needed 4! it turned out pretty good though. the mix of spices and flavors is quite weird though, especially in the quinoua mix before you bake it. but once baked it tastes good.

Made this almost to the recipe.  Didn't have goat cheese so I used feta, and I omitted the raisins. (We really only like them is sweet items or breads...not dishes like this.)  First, there was way too much filling for the peppers. I ended up cutting a third pepper, and there was still a bit of filling left. My daughter, who loves feta, didn't like it with this. I thought the taste was fine, as feta and goat cheese  have a slightly similar taste in the first place. But cheese choice aside, overall, this really did nothing for me. Although I love quinoa, and stuffed peppers, I will only finish these leftovers...the recipe will not be made again.
