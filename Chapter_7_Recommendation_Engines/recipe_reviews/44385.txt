Very tasty and quite easy to make. Rich and fruity.

One slight clarification the recipe could use is that you're blending the BROWN sugar with the flour for the crust and the WHITE sugar with the fruit. 

I found them to be quite hard to cut into nice, regular pieces. I baked for the recommended times, but, next time I'll allow them to cook longer to hopefully make them less sticky, less prone to crumbling along the cut edges and easier to cut.

I also may try dusting them lightly with powdered sugar as I'm serving to give them a more finished look.

Didn't care for these.  Way too sweet and never set up - so they were a gooey mess.  I ended up throwing away the whole pan.

the crust never firmed, even after 20 mins, & the apricots were still moving across the crust after 25 mins.  one of the other reviewers said they threw the whole pan out -- this was too much work to do that, but have not tried to cut them yet!  every winter i bake 1200 to 2200 cookies, at least for the last 7-8 years, so baking is not a problem. i prefer recipes to be better set up, though. am not sure will ever make this recipe again, no matter how it tastes...
