I just finished eating this wonderful yummy soup, and it was so easy to make.  I did make a few adjustments:  I used 4 cups cubed russet potatoes, 1 1lb. bag frozen broccoli flowets, 1 c. chopped onion as I thought 2 cups would be over powering,  in place of the bouillion cubes and 5 cups of water I used 2 14oz. cans chicken broth and 1 cup water  also added 3 crushed garlic cloves, and only used 8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese.  I cooked the broccoli in with the potatoes as other reviewers suggested and then pureed 1/2 the soup and it turned out nice and creamy.  This  will be a regular in our house during the winter months. Thanks Ruth for sharing this 5 ***** recipe.

Awesome! Of note, you can add raw broccoli to the soup a few minutes prior to pureeing in a blender. This way, you don't have to cook the broccoli separately. I also added white pepper, red pepper flakes, savory, and garlic powder. Next time, I'll definitely saute garlic with the onion, as I think that would make this awesome soup even better!

This was excellent! I sauteed the onion, added a clove of garlic, fresh ground pepper and a handful of baby carrots, then just cooked them all with the potatoes and broccoli in the broth. I pureed the entire thing (use a blender--a food processor splatters!) and tasted it. It was so delicious that I decided the cheese was optional. It also did not require any additional salt. I'm serving it tonight with homemade garlic croutons and just a sprinkle of sharp cheddar. Thank you for this wonderful, adaptable recipe. It's now in my recipe box and on my list of ideas for food to bring to sick friends. I'll bet you could easily turn this into a delicious vegan meal by using vegetable broth and omitting the cheese.

good recipe.  i do not think it is necessary to use the same amount of cheese as broccoli... this can be a very healthy soup.  I used olive oil instead of butter, added way less cheese, and I didn't see the importance of cooking the broc seperately.. it can be added a little after the potatoes and boils fine...  This was great.  Thanks!

Wow, this is really good, and easy for a soup. I made it twice recently, because it went over so well. Both times I had to use frozen broccoli. The first time I followed the recipe as written. Yum! The second time I added garlic with the onion, I added fresh carrots with the broccoli, and I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream just to see how it would taste. Both ways are really good, so if you are creative, create away; either way you're going to have a great soup.

This is one of my favorite soups.  It was so simple to make and it turned out great. I substituted vegetatarian bouilon cubes for the chicken and I cut out one step.  I put the broccoli in w/ the potatoes to simmer rather than have a separate step in cooking up the broccoli.  Seemed to work out great.

Thanks Ruth!

We just LOVED this soup!!! We added a can of evaporated milk for a little extra creaminess, and put the entire batch of soup into the blender.

I have been looking for a great recipe for Broccoli Cheese soup, and this is definitely it!
It is not time consuming and it tastes wonderful. I have added some fresh garlic to the recipe to add even more flavor.

This is an excellent base for a potato, broccoli, and cheese soup. I've made minor changes just to make it even simpler to prepare with ingredients that I have on hand.

I replaced the water and bouillon cubes with chicken stock. Since the recipe didn't specify, I used red potatoes (and I didn't peel them). I also didn't pre-cook the broccoli, I just chopped it into small pieces that could cook in the stock.

Since I like to have texture in my soup, I didn't blend or process the soup. Instead, I waited until the potatoes and broccoli were cooked all the way through and used a potato masher to just lightly press down on the potatoes and broccoli until the soup was the texture I wanted. I added the cheese at the end and let the soup continue for another 15 minutes or so, just to let it get well incorporated.

I've taken this soup to a potluck at work and people just raved about it and everyone asked for the recipe. It was one that I was pleased to share because it's so easy and so impressive at the same time!

WOW! I've never made broccoli soup before and this came out better than I had ever hoped for...even my 3-year-old loved it. 1st sauteed 1/3 sweet yellow onion, then added 2 cloves of minced garlic. Then added 7-8 large cubed Idaho potatoes, 3 C fresh broccoli and cooked them together with 4 C water and 3 t chicken buillion + 1 C milk. Per others' suggestion, I used potato masher and it worked so well. Added 1/4 t white pepper, kosher salt and 1 C mild cheddar cheese. I added 1T corn starch to thicken the soup to my liking.Oh, I had to walk to the computer to write this review so I would stop eating :)

Loved this one! I cooked the broccoli seperately as called for in the recipe, but put the broccoli in a blender with about half a cup of sour cream and a bit of the broth from the cooking pot.  "Mashed" the potatoes in the pot then added broccoli/sour cream mixture to the broth with the potatoes. Added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and used 1/2 a cup of "red hot" cheese and 2.5 cups of cheddar.  Great recipe, thanks Caroline!

Awesome soup!  I used 1.5 cups of cheese and cooked the broccoli (3 crowns) with the potatoes to save a step.  Pureed in pot with immersion blender.   Super easy!  Served with a sprinkle of cheese on top.  Would also be good in a bread bowl.

Great recipe, I also added about 5 cloves of garlic with the onions.  My kids loved it.  If your kids don't like broccoli, you could blend the whole soup and they won't know it's in there.

Well, I was short on things to cook for dinner tonight and made this b/c I had all of the ingredients. Sometimes necessity produces the best and most unexpected things.
First, I read all the reviews and made the following changes, which I recommend.

I sauteed garlic w/ the onion. I also used about a cup and a half of Velveta. I boiled the potatoes for 10 or so min, then threw in 3/4 of a bag of frozen broccoli and cooked together. When cooked, I pureed exactly half of the soup, returning it to the pot for a good combination of smooth and some 'bites' of potato and broccoli, which makes for an interesting soup.

Not necessary, but I happened to have a can of broccoli cheese soup, so I added that, as well as 1/2 or so of sour cream at the end. 

I seasoned with white pepper and a few dashes of cayenne.


Served with Bisquick drop biscuits. Just yummy, if not low fat.

This will be a family pleaser and a great soup to take to new mommies or someone just out of the hospital.

Delish! Nice to serve with Texas toast! We made the stock from scratch since we had chicken miss cuts and added 1 cube of the bullion in the pre made stock. Some other garlic and other spices to taste! other than that no modifications, my husband loved it!

I loved it! I used 5 cups of chicken broth instead of the bouillon cubes and water. I also add a lot more broccoli-- like twice as much and sometimes I throw in some kale (steamed first). Turned out great! I'll definitely make this next year when my broccoli comes in!

My husband found your recipe and printed it off. I made it following the directions & it was scrumptious! He devoured 3 good sized bowls & I was close behind him!! I have made this 3 times since the first batch & each time, it is oh so yummy. I just read some of the reviews from past cooks and think next time I will add some fresh garlic to the onions & cook the broccoli in with the potatoes-maybe adding it in at after the spuds have boiled for about 5 minutes. Less pots to wash! It is a very easy recipe & I don't mind preparing it after working all day! Thanks!!

It's a very good recipe but only 4 stars since I tweaked it so much:  1 c. onion, not 2; 1 1/2 c. cheese, not 3; I added the broccoli the same time as the potatoes --didn't pre-cook it; 1 garlic chopped, sautéd with the onion; added a little milk and flour to thicken slightly.

Flavor was good, but consistency was blah.  A little too watery for me. I added some milk and that helped a little.

I made this soup as a starter for Christmas Dinner.  It was really easy to make and refrigerate the day before (adding the cheese on the day)and it went down really well.  My 2 year old son loved it and it was just like the carton version which we buy from the shops.

In all honesty, I don't like rating less than a 5 star, but in this case, I can't.  While the recipe is simple enough, the taste was way too bland.  I did what others suggested and cooked 3 large cloves of garlic with the onions, but to no avail.  I also added garlic powder at the end, which did help it a little, but there is no real flavor to this dish.  It's edible, but it still sits in my fridge.  I'm glad others have liked it, but I would not make this again.  I am sorry I couldn't give this a better review, as some simple recipes are AMAZING.

This turned out great! Like many others, I made changes: used bacon grease instead of butter (and likely more than in the recipe - I didn't measure), I had probably only a cup or so of cheese and used probably half the stock. But I love it and so did my dad!

Great soup!!!  Made this almost as written but I started off saute-ing the onions in the grease of four strips of bacon that I fried crispy to crumble on top before serving.  Removed some potatoes before using my immersion blender to creme the soup.  Added them back with a bag of frozen broccoli that I cooked in the microwave (didn't want the green soup).  Added less cheese than called for and then a good splash of half & half.  It seemed to need some creaminess.  the end result was fantastic.  Great soup for a snowy day.

Such a great soup. To make it vegetarian I added as one reviewer mentioned vegetable bullion instead of chicken, and also 1 1/2 Cups milk...so rich and creamy for those chilly fall days!

it turned out pretty good. i made adjustments. first off i was out of onions and only had one can of broth. so i added three cups of water to the broth instead of using the bouillon. also i wanted bacon in my soup so i fryed up for pieces and used the grease instead of the butter. i also added about a tablespoon of butter for the flavor. and instead of using one kind of cheese i used about a cup of sharp cheddar, about a cup of colby jack, and about two cups of parmesan. i then added a cup of heavy whipping cream to the cheeses as the potatos cooked. i steamed my broccoli and added it to the cheese mixture.in the end i mixed the broccoli mixture and the potato mixture and topped it off with my crispy bacon.

I did not enjoy this soup as much as I had hoped to.  After an hour and a half in the kitchen, I was left with a strangely textured soup and a very big mess.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to transfer hot soup to a blender and back again without making a big mess or burning themselves?  I also didn't use a big enough pot to begin with (even though I used less potatoes and onions than it called for), so halfway through I had to transfer everything to another dish.  When I added the cheese, the soup smelled great, but it wouldn't melt!  Despite tampering with the temperature and frequent stirring, the end result was a broccoli and potato soup with a nice broth and big clumps of cheddar cheese.  While the soup did taste good (especially with a little garlic bread!), it was not any better than any other recipe for broccoli and cheese soup, and the texture was rather upleasant.  I do like the idea of adding potatoes, but I think a cheese soup needs to have more of a milk/cream base in order to come out to the right consistency.

This is a delicious soup.  I only make half for the 2 of us.  I have made it as is and sometimes I trade some of the potato for more broccoli.  It comes out greenish, a neat idea for St. Patty's Day.  I recommend removing the soup from heat, and gradually whisking in the cheese so it doesn't curdle. I used sharp cheddar.  Also it is nice to use a stick blender directly in the soup pot.  Like others, I also cooked the broccoli in with the potatoes toward the end.  I cooked till real tender. Thank you Ruth from Susie.

This was a good soup.  I used veggie broth instead of chicken, onion powder instead of chopped (so i omitted the butter all together), added a 1/2 a teaspoon of garlic powder, a shake of dried dill, and around a teaspoon of hot sauce.  Pretty good if you ask me!

This soup is one of my favorites, although I made some modifications: I used olive oil instead of margarine, I didn't cook the broccoli separately (I also used broccoli florets rather than bunches and used a bit more than the recipe called for), and used about 2/3 the amount of cheese recommended. Over all, delicious, but it needs something more--garlic or nutmeg, perhaps (I'll try that next time).

This was good the first day, but awesome the next day!   I added garlic to onions and cooked broc with potatoes as well.  As I didn't have a blender handy, I smashed it up well and added a can of cream o celery soup.  My only problem came in the fact that I doubled the recipe and that was a bit too much cheese to melt well.  Next time I make this, (and I will make this again!) I'll buy the fancy shredded and add some sharp cheddar. I may add a bit more broc as well.  Thanks for sharing Ruth!

I made this recipe the other night and it turned out surprisingly delicious. It was easy to make and, other than the cheese, much lower fat than my regular broccoli cheese soup. I thought that the amount of onion would be excessive but it actually turned out quite good.  I took one star off because of the presentation, although that is likely a function of my picky eaters than anything else. The recipe calls for adding the broccoli prior to pureeing half the soup contents; however, doing so ends up turning the soup a greenish color. I didn't mind that at all but the picky kids at home did. When I make it again (and I will) I'll do the pureeing prior to adding the broccoli.  Overall this was a good, inexpensive and filling meal for a cold fall evening. The kids think that it would be good with some crumbled bacon -- this recipe lends itself to experimentation and I look forward to doing so.

Great Soup!  I made this on a cold, grey Saturday morning, and the family Raved! Delicious hot comfort food!  I doubled the recipe.  We had it for brunch and had bowls of it through out the day.  Everyone complimented and thanked me numerous times.  The only changes I made to the recipe were:  I cooked the broccoli with the cubed potatoes, I used a potato masher to semi-mash up the soup instead of pureeing half of it, and I added a little Tapiocca flour and water (it's like corn starch) to thicken the soup a little at the end of cooking.  I will make this again ( the family insists). I may just use chicken broth next time, rather than water and chicken boullion.

This was really good. I had some leftover broccoli that I had to use. (It was parboiled and frozen, then thawed.) I didn't ave any onion so when I salted it, I used onion salt. I also used that better than boullion soup base, which worked great because it already has seasoning. Also, I didn't really measure and my soup was too thin, so I added 1 T of instant potatoes.
All in all very good!

This was awesome!!!  I generally stayed with the recipe except I use Campbells Chicken broth rather than water and boullion.  I cooked the raw broccoli in with the other stuff for the last five minutes cooking time.  Definitely use process cheese (I used low fat cheese slices).  One last thing, if you blend the brocolli with the potatoe and onion mixture - you will be a pea green color which some people may find it unappetizing.  If you don't want this color soup, simply blend the potatoe mixture without the broccoli and keep the broccoli piece whole in the soup.  One last thing...I added celery and I topped the soup with ground pepper when serving.  This was one of the best soups I have ever tasted.

Delicious!!!  Here's my vegetarian alternative:

Mona's Adjustments:

3 knorr extra large veggie bullion cubes
double the broccoli:  add 3 cups to the last 5 minutes of potato cook time, chop the rest and add at the end with the cheese.
when blending in the blender, add 2 cups whole milk
reheat to melt cheese and cook chopped brocolli.

This was delish! I made a few changes, near the end I added a can of evaporated milk. I added my fresh brocolli into the soup pot near the end, and it cooked that way.  And I only had two potatoes, so I used some hashbrown cubes as well, and it turned out great!  Will be making this again.

I made this recipe tonight to use up some broccoli and potatoes that were on their way out. I didn't have an onion or butter so I used an onion soup packet. Like other reviewers I added the broccoli to the potatoes after about 10 of the 15 minutes of cooking time. I used an immersion blender to break up enough chunks to get the soup to the creaminess I wanted but still leaving some chunks behind. I only had about a cup of cheese, so that's all I used, and I had a little sour cream that was about to expire (~1/4 cup), so I threw that in too when I added the cheese. 

Great, flexible recipe. The mister added Tabasco to his bowl. I tried it too and it's a delicious way to give it a little kick!

I sauteed a bag of frozen brussels sprouts and pureed it along with the broccoli and potatoes. It still tasted like amazing broccoli soup! And extra veges, hidden and my kids loved it! I topped each bowl with a little cream and shredded cheddar.

I gave it 5 stars - turned out great but onion flavor was too much. I made it with 1 cup red onion, 2 tbls. margarine, 3-4 cloves garlic, 2 lbs. red potatoes (better texture), 3-4 cups water, 5 tsp. Better than Bouillon reduced sodium Chicken Base, 4 cups broccoli (I figure the more the better), 2 cups fresh asparagus, and velveeta cheese added to your own preference, and fresh ground black pepper only, I add salt if needed when soup is done. After sauteing onion I added water, broccoli, asparagus, garlic, bouillon, and potatoes all in same pot and boiled it , draining some liquid out later before I began to puree half of it.(keep liquid in case soup needs extra flavor, it can be cooked down /reduced then added back to soup) Velveeta is added,black pepper to taste, plus small amt. of heavy cream was added for richness, and topped w/homemade croutons. It is too good, I was on my second bowl before my hubby finished his first and in 14 yrs. that's never happened! Yeah, it's good

I used 3 C chicken stock in place of 3 C water since I didn't have bouillon, used frozen broccoli, and added some diced ham. Not exactly the potato soup I was looking for, but not bad!

Tastes so rich and amazing even without the cheese! (And i'm a cheese addict) Per some other suggestions, i used a little less onion and added garlic, substituting bacon grease because I didn't have butter, then I added frozen broccoli to the nearly cooked potatoes and then just blended the whole thing with a stick blender. It tasted so great i almost didn't want to add the cheese, but it was grated so i through it in. I was prepared to add some half & half as I was skeptical about the creaminess of the soup since there's no cream in the recipe, but i didn't need it at all! Add a little fresh cracked pepper on top when serving and it's perfect. Wow, wish I'd bought my stick blender years ago, who knew I was missing out on amazing soups like this one?!!

My whole family liked this, including three kids who generally dislike soup. I used velveeta cheese, and substituted vegetarian broth for the chicken. I cooked the broccoli with the potatoes. Delicious!

MMMM, I just made a pot of this soup, and it is delicious! I'd give it 5 full stars, but as it is, it's a touch on the bland side. I added a few cloves of garlic while sauteing the onion, and that has helped. As a bit of a guilty pleasure, I've crumbled a strip of bacon on top of each bowl. Delicious! I'll definitely make this again, and will likely puree the whole soup rather than half - it's a consistency preference.

Thank you Ruth for an amazing recipe!

Easy and good. I didn't puree the soup because I like it chunky. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was great.

I used chicken stock (only 4 cups) instead of the boullion/water combo, and added the broccoli to the pot with 5 minutes left to simmer to just save dishes.  Everything worked out well.  I also pureed the entire pot since my potato cubes and broccoli were rather large.  Ends up very thick and delicious, and I used only about half the cheese!

Great recipe. Pretty basic, but the kids loved it! Put in some crushed red peppers after the kids ate. That did the trick. I also put the broccoli in with the potatoes at about 9 minutes before the potatoes were done. Simple & yummy.

I was severly dissappointed with this recipe. Made it EXACTLY as written with the addition of 3 cloves of garlic. 
This was MAJORLY BLAND lacking just about ANY flavor. I didn't think it was possible to go wrong with such delicious ingredients, however, without some seriuos flavor changes (spices and such) I will NOT be making this again.

My family loves this soup! I add a clove of garlic and have even used frozen broccoli. I also sometimes use the California blend veggies and it still tastes great! My kids love it and it's so easy. I have also left out the cheese and put in the freezer for a later date! Mmmmm...yummy!

Absolutely delish! Loved the texture/flavor, far better than any canned broccoli soup. I like to keep my vegetable broth, so I only added 4 cups water to pot and after boiling my broccoli I threw in the broth and all. To serve , I added a tablespoon of sour cream in the center of each bowl with a sprinkle of green onion or chives. Yum!

This was very good. I pureed the whole batch. I also used a little less cheese and next time I might not use any - the flavour was great without it! Will make again, thanks.

I love this recipe! To make it even faster to make I thickened the soup by putting some instant mashed potatoes in it instead of pureeing half of the soup. It worked great!

Followed BBFITZ's advice and only used 1 cup chopped onion, 1 lb. frozen broccoli (cooked in microwave) and chicken stock in place of water/bouillon.  Hubby had FOUR bowls full.  I think it's a keeper...

This soup is great and very easy to make!  I was looking for a "cream" soup without milk or cream and this one was perfect!!  I did make a couple changes, I added a couple cloves of garlic with the onions, used olive oil instead of the margarine, vegetable stock instead of the chicken bouillon (I'm vegetarian) and cooked the broccoli in the soup after the potatoes were tender.  Everyone in my family loved it, I've made it twice in three weeks!!  Thank you for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  To save time, I steam the broccoli in a bamboo steamer over the potatoes as they are boiling just to eliminate a step.  I also puree 80-90% of the soup. (just personal preference)  At my last dinner party, I served this soup on the side in a little tea cup with a pinch of finely grated cheddar on top.  Looked fancy and was super easy.  This soup also freezes very well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe. Pureeing half the soup really makes it a nice, thick soup. We substituted 1 cup of diced velveeta cheese for the 3 cups shredded cheddar. Still wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm not sure what went wrong here but this soup is not good. I followed the instructions except used some frozen instead of fresh broccoli and it's really bland and blah. Will definitely not be making this again.

Oh my goodness, this is soooo good! I love the broccoli cheddar soup from Panera. It's so nice to have something even better to enjoy at home. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Ruth. It will be made a lot in my house.

This was great soup, I did change a little though, I added the potatoes and the broccoli at the same time and let them simmer, while that was cooking I made up some white sauce to add with the cheese later. After pureeing I added the white sauce, and 2 cups a cheddar cheese and one cup of mozzarella, as well as 1/4 cup of half and half. The soup was a hit and I served it in a bread bowl. My hubby says it is one that will stay! Thank you for the great recipe!

I halfed the recipe, and I think I used too much cheese (I wasn't being very exact on measurements).  Also, I did not have chicken bouillon, so I used what I had on hand which was vegetable broth.  To that I added a piece of bacon to give a little more flavor.  I also sauted some garlic with the onion as was recommended.  All-in-all very good.

Very good. I followed some advice by other reviewers and reduced the onion to 1 cup, and sauteed a couple cloves of crushed garlic with the onion. I used vegetable buillion instead of chicken and replaced 2 cups of water with milk. I added the broccoli to cook with the potato for the last 8 minutes along with 1 cup chopped carrots. I served it with cheddar flavored goldfish on top. Next time I am going to reduce the cheese by 1 cup, 2 cups is enough.

I'm always looking for a good, thick soup that isn't super unhealthy. The last time I made broccoli cheese soup I thickened it with cornstarch instead of reducing a cream base, which just gave it a gelatinous texture, so I was happy to find this soup that's naturally thick and a dinner in itself. I substituted half the water for non-fat milk and used 1 1/2 cups low-fat monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar, and put in more broccoli than potatoes. I also cooked the broccoli with the potatoes on medium for about 25 minutes and then blended. It was perfect for leftovers for the week!

Great soup.  I used canned chicken broth instead of water and bouillon cubes.  I threw frozen broccoli in after the potatoes had cooked for a few minutes.  I also only used about a cup of cheese and sprinkled it on the top to make an orange swirl on the bright green soup. Pretty and delicious.

This soup was great, BUT I used "cheddar cheese" & things didn't do so well. Next time use Velvetta!! It was AWESOME!

This soup is wonderful! It's simple, easy and tasty. I add a can of cream soup to it to thicken it up a bit, and I also throw frozen broccoli in with the poataoes the last few minutes. I'm making it for dinner tonight!

I love this recipe because it uses only fresh ingredients, not cans of soup or mixes, because it is easy to make, and best of all, it tastes great, especially when you use fresh veggies from your garden.  A couple of suggestions:  I used fresh dug red potatoes and didn't peel them.  They made pretty little red specks in the soup.  I also used a stick blender instead of a blender.  I just blended it until it had a few little chunks in it, but not pureed totally.  I also like that this recipe uses no milk for those who have some kind of milk allergy. It's a wonderful fresh from the garden recipe that the whole family will enjoy!!!

This soup tastes like something you would get at a really nice restaurant.  (I did tweak it a little though.) First, after the potatoes and broccoli were cooked and soft I used a potato masher instead of dragging out my food processor.  Second I through in some cooked garlic I had leftover from making garlic chicken, about half a can of cream of chicken soup, and about 1/2 cup of whipping cream.  The whipping cream is what gives it a really appealing color.  I only added about a cup of cheese.

When I made this soup, I added carrots and I cooked the carrots, broccoli, and onion together in the butter until tender.  Then I added the water and boullion and cooked until tender.  Then, to save time and lots of dirty pans, I gently mashed the potatoes right in the pot with a potato masher.  This saved alot of time and still thickened the soup.  I like having chunks of potato, broccoli, and carrot in my soup and this way I achieved that instead of puree.

I like this recipe.  To dress it up a little I like to cook bacon.  Then I cook the onions in a bit of the bacon grease.  I also cook the broccoli in with the potatoes.  Then I sprinkle some bacon bits on the top of the soap when I serve it.  Very very good!!

this was a fairly easy  concoction after i simplified for my ease.. i used frozen broccoli florets and cooked them  in the 5 cups of boiling water. instead of the food processor, i just got out my hand mixer and set it to whip and blended it in the pot.. to make things even easier i used velveeta ( to taste ) instead of shredded cheese. and i omitted the salt due to the  cheese food.. even better the next day

This is such a great recipe. Made a nice sized pot for my family and they loved it! I used 8 cups of water along with 6 cubes of bullion. I also added the broccoli with the potatoes instead of doing it separately.  I added 2 tablespoons of flour and 2 cups of milk. Great soup!

Soup tasted great, but my goof up was that my cheddar cheese clumped up into a big mess! Not the recipe's fault at all. I think maybe my heat was a little too high. We ate what we could. I'll try it again when I get over my anguish at loosing an expensive chunk on cheddar.

The appearance of this soup is a huge put-off. And the texture isn't much better! I ended up adding corn starch to thicken it, and i served it over white rice, and chicken, because there was no way we could eat it as soup. The taste was fine after seasoning.

This is a wonderful recipe. I added two finely grated carrots for extra nutrition and used chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes and water. An immersion blender works very well with this recipe. I added more small chopped broccoli after blending other ingredients.  When we reheated the leftovers we added chopped ham.

I made some changes, based on other reviews and my own thoughts.. talk about awesome soup! Cooked about 2 cloves garlic with the onion and butter. Cooked the broccoli with the potatoes, when that was done - Used 4c water, 1c milk. Whisked about 1 tbs cornstarch into 1/4c milk, then added into pot. Not much salt, but extra course ground pepper. Added some cooked carrots and about 16oz of chopped (chunky ham), and the normal cheese. Never puree'd 1/2 the soup like suggested. BEST potato soup I have ever made!

I had my wisdom teeth removed and needed some soft foods to eat. This has been a life saver! I pretty much pureed it completely. Also only used 2 bouillon cubes instead of 4, also used vegetable cubes since i didn't have chicken on hand. I LOVE LOVE LOVE cheese, but would also reduce the amount of cheddar used to about 2 cups or less. Awesome recipe and will make this again (also for those without scales, i used about 6-7 medium potatoes)

Awesome recipe.  Great starter recipe if you have to start from the beginning and have never cooked something like this before.
I had leftover boiled potatoes, steamed broccoli and a box of low sodium chicken broth, so I used that my second time around.  I added all of that to sauteed garlic and onion, simmered it until it was very tender and used my immersion blender to smooth it all out. PERFECT.  I added a cheese mix [shredded cheddar/monteray jack] b/c that is what I had on hand and chopped up some frozen broccoli in my mini chopper, tossed it in for a bit of darker color and texture.  Pepper to taste.
Thank you Ruth so much for an amazing recipe.  I love yours and adapting leftovers to it works well too!

Flavor was OK. I cooked the broccoli with the potatoes per the comments to simplify.  I then used an immersion/stick blender to puree and the end result was a grainy mess rather than smooth.   I will not make this again, but this is partially due to my tweaking not working out.

I really liked this, but my husband didn't.  I think the cheese I used may have been extra sharp cheddar...mild might be more to his liking.  I have returned and dropped my rating, because it still didn't hit the mark for us.  Looking for a new broccoli recipe with more broccoli flavor.

I sauteed the onion with butter along with a little celery and minced garlic. I peeled, chopped, boiled and then pureed the broccoli stalks separately, then added to the pot. (I also pureed half the pot's contents before adding that.) I added the cut tops of the broccoli after everything else was all cooked. Went a little light on the cheese, also added some chopped baby carrots, fresh parsley, salt, both black and white pepper and some dill weed. Oh, and used veggie bullion cubes instead of chicken , just because it was all I had on hand. Came out awesome!

I made the recipe as is except I added a few spices that help with homeopathic remedies to helicobacter pylori since my boyfriend has this and it is transmissible. I added cumin seed, tumeric, oregano and thyme. It was amazingly good with the spices added. I sauteed the broccoli separate as per the direction and let it finish tenderizing in the pot. I also pureed most of the soup instead of half of it. I was delicious. I only gave it 4 stars because I added spices that I think added to the recipe.

This is great! I only used 1/4 of an onion because that's what I had, plus we aren't huge fans of onion. I took the advice of other reviewers and threw the broccoli in with the potatoes after 8 or 9 minutes. My favorite part of this is that my 2 year old daughter is still eating it as I type this.

Made this last night for the family.  Everyone loved it - including all three children.  I made some of the adjustments suggested by others.  I added garlic and carrots.  I used chicken stock instead of bullion as I had some that needed to be used up.  And for additional seasoning I added dried mustard and dried dill.  Felt like this recipe provides a good base to which you can add your own preferences.

This is simple to make and tastes very good.  It has  less visual appeal than some other broccoli soups.  I skipped the butter and just simmered the potatoes and broccoli in the chicken broth.

I made this soup for my boyfriend when he was home sick from work.  He loves broccoli.  I hate broccoli.  But, we both loved this soup!  Used only about two cups of broccoli and two cups of cheese and it was perfect.

Delicious!  I bit too salty for my taste, so I added a cup of milk to dilute it a bit. I also didn't want it quite so chunky, so I pureed about 3/4.  Added 4 cloves chopped garlic at the end of sauteing the onions.  With modifications: 5 stars.

Followed recipe exactly except guessing weight of potatoes (no scale). This is delicious and easy to make. I will try changing a few things as recommended by others just to try my hand at creativity but feel the recipe is great as it stands......Made this again substituting aparagus for the broccoli and cutting down the cheese, it came out wonderful!

This Soup is AWESOME! I used vegetable broth instead since I am a vegetarian, and added the broccoli with the potatoes and it worked out amazing! This sure did perk up our rainy day, and my 1yr. old LOVED it and he is super picky! Thank you

Loved this! It was so easy to make. I used baby yellow potatoes, so I didn't have to peal or cut them and it was great. I also added the broccoli in at the same time as the potatoes as opposed to cooking them before hand. Lots of leftovers, will be making this again!

This was tasty and easy. Instead of taking half of the soup and blending it I used my immersion blender and just kept going until it had a good consistency.

I used can of chicken broth instead of bouilion cubes.  Also, added velveeta cheese with the cheddar cheese.   Putting half of the mixture into the blender and adding the velveeta cheese makes it very creamy without  adding milk.

This soup was very tasty even though I added 1 cup of milk to the 5 cups of chicken broth, 1 teaspoon of garlic (from the advice of the reviewers), used russet and yukon potatoes and only had mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar! Loved it!

Love this recipe! I used red onion and cut it down to 1 c. plus I used about 4 c. unpeeled diced red potatoes. When I added the cheese at the end, I added a can of cream of potato soup and about 1/2 c. milk to make it a little thicker and creamier. It turned out absolutely fabulous... the best I've ever made.

This was a tasty soup recipe. The only signifivant additions i mad were to use 1 cup milk, half a package of bacon, and used red potatoes unskinned. There is quite a bit of work like chopping onion and potatoes, steaming broccoli, etc. But there is quite a bit of soup so its good for my wife and me for days. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this with the amount of potatoes called for and felt it tasted much more like potato than broccoli. Next time I make it I will just use fewer spuds. I also pureed the entire batch so my kids wouldn't recognize the broccoli!  

I think the people who complain about the color are using frozen broccoli. If you use fresh, it should be a nice green color.

It was just ok for me, tasted a bit like liquid mashed potatoes with cheese.  Next time, I will try to use a recipe that calls for more broccoli.

I absolutely LOVE this soup!  I used quite a few of the amendments made by other reviewers such as sauteing the garlic with the onions and halfing the broccoli to allow for chunks.  Another thing I added to make it a little creamier was a about 1/3 cup of sour cream and added some other veggies such as mushrooms and celery.  Definitely a recipe I'll be using again!

this was realyy good I double the broccoli, it seems to be missing creaminess though I'll try addind a bit of light half to the puree maybe this will help but other than this was great! a keeper.

This soup is awesome on a cold rainy day. I didn't have bullion cubes so I just used 2 C chicken stock in place of 2 C of the water. I just used some shredded pizza cheese that tastes good too. I also added 2 chopped garlic gloves and half a can of cream of chicken soup for a bit more flava. Hmmmmhmmm good soup! A+ A broccoli lovers delight!

We loved this soup!  The only change I made was adding a can of cream of chicken soup at the end to make it thicker.  It was very filling.  We used croutons instead of crackers or bread and it was a nice addition in the soup.  I will make it again!

Tasty on a cool evening.  I only pureed the potatoes and left the broccoli chopped.  Very thick, stick to your ribs soup and great with hot fresh baked french bread.  I will add garlic next time.  Thanks Ruth!

This really hit the spot!  It has been cold and rainy here for the past two days.  So I was in a "soup mood" and I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I am glad that I did!  This is really good.  I did add a can of evaporated milk to give it a little more creamy taste.  I did not have a food processor so I just mashed mine like one reviewer did with a potato masher.  Works great!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup, but my broccoli-loving daughters did not.  I added 4 cloves of garlic to the onions for extra flavor.  This was especially good the next day.

My fussy 4 & 6 year old eaters gobble this up.  It's a great comfort food and we all fight over the leftovers.  I think I'll try some of the tips to speed the process up a bit.  I might even use frozen chopped onions since I hate to chop those puppies.  Thanks Ruth!

I used uncured turkey bacon instead of traditional bacon. It was a huge hit with everybody. Will definitely be making this again over the cold weather months.

Just decided one day to make this for my bf and I. We absolutely loooooved it. We followed the recipe easily and it was amazing. This will now be part of a meal we eat during the colder months. Paired with a grilled cheese, some crackers and a little green onion on top. i will say next time i wont purify as much of the potatoes to allow a little more chunck. Thanks so much for sharing this!

Great easy recipe. No extra salt needed, and cheese optional in my opinion. Love how blending 1/2 the soup gives it a creamy texture without adding milk or cream (and the extra calories!).

Made it vegetarian and didn't have stock so I just spiced it up well with smoked paprika, rosemary, thyme, cayenne, and more. Good stuff! Had Monterey Jack and colby cheese to throw into it.

It was very flavorful and perfect for cold and rainy weather. I used one less bouillon or else I wasn’t going to be able to put any salt or pepper that comes in the recipe. As it is it was on the saltier side. I also used chicken and one potato. My kids perfered it chunkier so  I guess that is up to everyone’s taste.

Very good recipe for those who want to opt out of Milk as the base.  I used a potato masher, instead of the food processor, to get a thicker, slightly chunky soup.  Also, I added 1 Tablespoon garlic salt to the pot, after everything was cooked and mashed.  This recipe was a hit for this family!

Reason for only 3 stars was that i feel like i added a lot more than what the recipe called for.  I feel like it may have been a bit bland if I didn't.  

I ended up adding celery and shredded carrots to the recipe.  I also just cooked all the stuff together since I had defrosted some broccoli and it was already soft.  I used an immersion blender to blend part of it. Also added some sour cream to make it a bit creamier.  It was definitely a hot in our home and my twins loved it, they're 1 year 8 months and asked for more.

This soup just didn't stand out to me.  Flavor was alright, but the consistency was off and it just wasn't very appetizing to look at.

I did like others and cooked the broccoli with the potatoes saving that extra cleanup. And used my potato masher instead of the blender. But other than that I followed the recipe. It was a huge hit and I have been repeatedly been asked for the recipe.

Have made a couple of times and was enjoyed by all.
Short on cheddar so added some colby & munster. 
I got lazy and just used the stick blender to partially puree in the pan.  
Yummy!

Amazing! I did make a few changes. Used chicken broth instead of water, added 4 cloves of smashed garlic, only used 1 onion and added green onions as well, I also added some ground turmeric. I only had frozen broccoli and also added a can of sliced carrots. Before adding the cheese I mashed it once i added the cheese I let it simmer for 15 minuets. Everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We added 5 cloves of garlic, used 2 cans of chicken broth in place of 4 cups of water, and used cooked frozen broccoli in place of fresh broccoli. We used about 9 ounces of shredded medium cheddar cheese. Next time, I will add some spicy peppers when I saute the onion and garlic.

I love this soup. I sautéed chopped celery with the onion and added a few tbsps of butter at the end. Not as healthy with butter but tastes wonderful.

I made this, but mostly eyeballed the ingredients than measure them as the recipe directs. I also added a bit over a cup of milk which made it super creamy and delicious!

Not bad as a starter recipe.  I used half a head cauliflower to substitute for some potato.  I sautéed garlic and 1 cube of chicken bouillon in butter with a dash of pepper added the potatoes to cook for a few minutes then added the water.  After cooking the potatoes halfway I added the cauliflower and broccoli and brought to a boil.  Lowered burner to simmer for 25 mins until potatoes soften. I put all the potatoes and cauliflower in a blender and puréed. I separated the leftover broth and broccoli.  I added the puréed potatoes and cauliflower in with broccoli and slowly added the broth to the soup consistency I wanted.  It came out really good!! Next time I will use less bouillon to reduce sodium or chicken broth.

This soup was amazing! I did it a little differently though so I guess hard to say for sure this soup recipe was perfect. I melted the margarine/butter and then added 3 stalks of chopped celery,  the onion, the broccoli, and potatoes and cooked for about 3 minutes. Then I added about 2 tbsp of flour to coat.  Then I added the water and bouillon cubes and I added 2 tsp turmeric and cooked for another 2 minutes and I scooped out the broccoli florets. After about 15 minutes I used a hand blender to blend the soup to a smooth texture and  added 1 cup of milk. I let the soup return to a boil and added the cheese and stirred until the cheese was melted. I then added chopped green onion and the broccoli florets on top of the soup. Yum!

This didn't work for me. When I put in that much water, I got worried. It should be milk based so the cheese blends better. The cheese that I stirred in clung to all the broccoli so I had yellowish chunks of broccoli that were chewy. Take the cooked vegetables out and place them into a pot of milk?

I do not review recipes! Felt compelled to for this soup. I started making this soup for my 2 daughters when they were in elementary school. Now in their 20's, they are making it for themselves. No changes needed.! This soup is easy to make and delicious. I prefer to shred my cheese over buying the pre shredded. It melts in better. I do tend to add a little extra broccoli in but that is the only change. I also bought an immersion blender after a bad episode where my blender leaked. So much easier!!!

This was just the starter recipe I was looking for. I did heed the advice of other reviewers and added garlic. I also allowed the broccoli to cook along with the potatoes. I wanted a creamier soup so I changed up the cheese. I did use 1 cup of sharp cheddar, but also 1/2 cup of parmesan & a block of cream cheese.

Yummy, I didn't have quite 2 1/2 #s of potatoes but I had almost 3 1/2 cups of broccoli so it evened out. I sautéed 3 cloves of garlic with the 2 cups of onion. I used 32oz of chicken broth and 1 cup of water. Otherwise I followed the recipe. We threw in some croutons when serving.

I made this once and didnt like it. So the next time i greatly changed the recipe. I precooked the potatoes and broccoli left in bite size chunksthen instead of water with bouillon, i used half chicken stock half milk. 1lbs cotswold cheese. Butter and flour to make a rue. And a pinch of salt and pepper. Was amazing!

I followed the recipe with the addition of about 2 tsps. minced garlic after the onion.  I used red potatoes, trimmed only lightly.  I used canned broth along with another spoonful of bouillon.  An immersion blender accomplished the texture I like, then the grated cheese was added.  It was a hit with all here and I expect to make this again.  Great comfort food and makes a lot.

After tasting as is, I wanted a more creamy soup. Added milk and it tasted better. 4 stars as is. 5 stars with milk.

It is very easy, and completely edible - hence the two stars - but it is missing some creaminess and greater depth of flavor. Boring, boring, boring.

Tasted really good.  Wish their was at least an average measurement for salt and pepper.  I ended up putting too much salt, thinking that it wouldn't even be enough.

I thought it was really bland and wasn't crazy about the texture. I expected something creamier, even though there's no milk or cream in it.  However, the potato-veggie-liquid ratio was spot on, so I'm going to try it again sometime and experiment with different seasonings. And bacon.

Easy and tasty, my favorite combination. The recipe is a good place to start. I used just half an onion and added a clove of garlic, as mentioned in other reviews. Three 4-in russets was plenty. Don't know how many pounds that is. Had 6 cups of chicken broth, so used that. Added the broccoli to the soup to cook for about 5 minutes, turning the heat back up. Used 2 cups of cheese, which was enough for us. My wife likes chunky soup, so I didn't puree it at all. Good blend of flavors and texture.

I started making this recipe a couple years ago and it's a family favorite.  I cook the broccoli in the same pot as the potatoes and use an immersion blender to blend the soup to our level of preferred smoothness.  I also use less cheese than the recipe, because we love it even without the extra calories.  Generally, I don't even measure the cheese - just add and taste until it's "enough" for us.  I've also frozen and reheated the leftovers at another time and it was good then too.

I made it to use leftovers from Thanksgiving.  Delicious!  I sauteed chopped bacon in some olive oil along with the onions and a diced carrot.  When the onions and carrots were soft I added several cloves of garlic chopped and sauteed two more minutes. Then I added 2 cups chicken broth, chopped fresh broccoli and simmered until the broccoli was soft.  Then I added leftover mashed  potatoes and cheese.  I will make it often even if I don't have leftovers.

I added 12 ounces of bacon, chopped and fried, then cooked the onion in the bacon grease, omitting the margarine. Next time I will set the bacon aside to add to each dish because the cooking down of the potatoes made the bacon soft, which hubby didn't really care for. 

I just used a bag of frozen broccoli which I thawed out in place of a fresh bunch of broccoli. I added a teaspoon of minced garlic too, because I like it in my soups. Next time, I am not going to puree half of it because I like my soup chunkier so I think maybe a third or even a quarter of it instead. It gives it a nice chowder like consistency though. 

Hubby loved it and went back for seconds, so I know I'll be asked to make it again!

Really liked it. Made it with frozen chopped broccoli but it was still very good. I kept every thing the same and I added a dollop of sour cream before serving. Yummy! Will make it again as the family really liked it plus it was super easy and pretty quick.

Great recipe I also put the broccoli together with the potatoes and I followed the other reviewers tip about putting chicken broth but I think next time I'll add a little more Broccoli but other than that this is a great recipe. I put a bit of cheese and some green onions on top for garnish

I made a couple of changes: I used real butter, unsalted and I used an immersion blender instead of a blender or food processor. I also added a little (1/2 C.) heavy whipping cream. It was delicious, BUT, if you add 1 Knorr Cilantro Mini Cube per 2 1/2 cups of soup, it is OVER THE TOP(5 stars). Obviously, you have to like cilantro, and if you do, you will LOVE this.

Best broccoli soup ever!  My whole family likes it.  I'm not an onion fan - but it works in this recipe.  I usually make it without the cheese - super healthy for you this way and tastes really good.

I love this soup.  I make it in the slow cooker.  I throw everything in at once and cook for 7.5 hours on high. I use a little extra potato, add garlic, half cauliflower with the broccoli and less onion. And no cheese.  We eat it with grilled cheese sandwiches instead.  Yum!

I just made this wonderful soup for 6 hungry adults for lunch.also.  Added sliced carrots and chopped garlic as well.
And used two boxes of chicken broth rather than cubes and water.  Served with tossed salad and crackers. 
Really Delicious! Will make again.

I love this soup. It is a very easy, very versatile soup. It's good with or without cheese. you can add all sorts of different veggies (carrot, celery, cauliflower, garlic, peas, kale, etc)  if you want. Cook the broccoli with the potatoes, that's the way to go. I have made this soup many times and changed it up each time. So easy to play with. Thanks, Ruth!

This is a great recipe! I made a few changes, but this recipe guided my changes! I used 2 cups low sodium chicken broth, 3 cups water and 3 chicken bullion cubes. I sautéed minced garlic with the onions. I got the idea from other reviews to just cook the broccoli with the potatoes. Great recipe!

Wonderful as is.  Family LOVED it.  No substitution of ingredients was necessary.  To save time, I cooked broccoli with the potato (adding it last 8 minutes of boiling time) and puree'd all of it.  Perfect.

Great recipe. Few changes I made. I didn't have onion so I used about 1/2 cup of dry onion flakes. Added 3 crushed Garlic cloves. Added 2 cans Swanson chicken broth and 1 cup half and half instead of bouillon and water. Perfect!!

I  used 6 c of water with 6 veggie cubes(prefer that flavor over chicken), 5 c of cubed potatoes, 2 c onions, 3 c broccoli, garlic and also garlic powder. Followed everything except I put the broccoli to cook with the last  5 mins of the potatoes. Also put the chopped garlic in the last 2 mins of the onions. In the end, added a 1/2 c evaporated milk for some extra creaminess, garlic powder to taste, and used a potato masher to break up everything but still keep some texture. Then added some sliced carrots I had boiling in veggie broth on the side. It was absolutely yummy! Will be making again soon :)

This recipe didn't really hit the spot. It was watery, not creamy, and not very cheesy and the potato sort of overwhelmed all other flavors.

Big Hit!!! My fiancé is vegetarian, so I used veggie Bouillon instead of chicken. Next time I may add a little Swiss.

This is one of the best soup recipes that I have made! I added 3 chopped garlic cloves along with the onions, I also added 2 finely chopped carrots for color. Then I pureed half the soup mixture with out the broccoli, then threw in the raw broccoli and cooked until tender then added the cheese. Delicious!

The main reason why I chose this recipe was that I had a few heads of broccoli that were looking a little ragged. I had bought them the week before because they were on sale and I will not ever throw out food if I can help it. This is a great recipe! I made minor adjustments, but only because of laziness. I may have put in a few extra potatoes (I couldn't leave just 4 little ones in the bag!) so it was pretty thick. Used others' suggestions to cook the broccoli in the soup (also adds more flavor). I did not find the need to peel the potatoes or the broccoli, mainly because I'm lazy and I like potato skins. Put the whole thing in the food processor to get a better consistency. This thickens it up as well to those who complained theirs was watery, because mine wasn't AT ALL. Thinned it out with some heavy cream and served it with the cheese on the side. My kids loved it and this re-heated well, thinking of making a bigger batch next time to freeze for bag lunches - without cream, of course.

I made it the first time as written and it was bland and not my texture at all. The second time around I used more potatoes and cut them into bigger cubes, I used more broccoli (around 4-5 cups) and I blended slightly more than half of the soup. I dashed some paprika in as well.

Delicious!  The only changes I made were to add garlic with the onions and milk when the soup was done as others suggested.  I waited to add the cheese at the table and was glad for it.  It gets very stringy when you add a nice handful.  I was concerned about how green it looked when I puréed part of the batch, but the cheese returned the color to a more kid-friendly hue.  Speaking of kids, they both said the flavor was great!

I did make a few adjustments.  I doubled the recipe, and instead of using 10 cups of water, I did 5 cups of water (with the bullion cube) and 3 cups of milk and 1 cup of heavy cream.  I also sauteed some onion and garlic to put in with it.  My family and I loved it, thank you.

This was a deliciously easy and awesome recipe for broccoli potato and cheddar soup. I did add a can of evaporated milk as another reviewer suggested. It helped with the creaminess quite a bit. I didn't need a to add any salt at all due to the salt in the bullion . So taste before you season. Great recipe!!!

I added a pound of bacon to this and it was AMAZING! I liked this a little more on the chunky side, so I only blended about a quarter of the soup as apposed to half.  This was a very filling dish, perfect for a cold rainy or snowy day :)

This recipe rocked my world! I made it for my bf, though, and since he's a vegetarian, I substituted the bouillon cubes for one can of cream of mushroom soup + 2 cans of water to dilute it (so that my soup could come to a boil w/o burning). I also halved the amount of cheddar cheese as I didn't want to overpower the subtle flavors of the broccoli and potato. I'd recommend this to anyone; it makes a wonderful meal!

Had some potatoes that were getting old so I made this wonderful soup. It was easier to make than brownies! I made 3 servings and it turned out perfect. I did exactly what the directions said to do. There's really no need to add a bunch of other stuff to this soup its wonderful as is!

This was good.  I used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon.  It needed about 1 teaspoon of salt, a pinch of cayenne, and some garlic powder.  To make it creamy I added a can of evaporated milk.

Very good. I took other reviewers suggestion to put broccoli in at the end of the potato cooking time. I made some other little tweaks, like adding garlic, only pureed about 1 C, added less cheese, but it is still very tasty. Definitely a recipe that can be easily tweaked for your preference. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is fantastic soup.  I was initially concerned because it made such a big pot of soup for two people, but between the two of us, we consumed 5 bowls of it for dinner last night.  We just couldn't stop eating it.  It's that good. I followed the recipe to the T and it doesn't need any changes, in my opinion.

I loved this recipe!!! I kept the broccoli and cheese seperate so my family could add as much as they preferred. My sister-in-law added bacon bits, I added tomatoes and sour cream. My girlfriend added sour cream with red chili pepper seasoning. The texture of the soup was perfect, used chicken stock and skipped the margarine. I will be making this more often. Thank you for the add

This recipe is very good, as written.  I'm 60 years old and have been cooking/making soups for years.  Certainly many are more complex and have more ingredients but the joy of making this soup is not only the great taste but also the simplicity.  I used an immersion blender to "puree" half the ingredients, as directed.  This makes it a creamy yet chunky perfection.  Served it with a good ol' grilled ham and cheese sandwich.

We made this soup for dinner and it was a hit with everyone! We only used  1 1/2 c. onions, used veggie bouillon, and cooked the broccoli with the potatoes. It turned out lovely and thick. My nine year old (an INCREDIBLY picky eater) requested seconds, which never happens! Might use sharp cheese next time and cut down on the overall amount of cheese, as some have suggested. I am sure it would be delicious that way as well!

Mmmm sooo good...we really enjoyed this soup! The only changes were I added about 1 cup of milk and reduced the cheese slightly. I also added a little bit of curry powder and served the hot steamy soup with a topping of cheddar cheese and some croutons...this will definitely be a favorite in our home...thanks for sharing:)

Flavor was good, but the texture was something to be desired.  (Thanks to the starchy potatoes!)  I cooked the broccoli with potatoes and added celery.  I also added a little milk and cornstarch to thicken it up.  It looked kind of like vomit too, so good thing the flavor was there!

Really good, my suggestion is don't cook the potatoes too long, they will get mushy and the soup will turn into baby food.

I want to give a 4.5... I loved this recipe. No fuss, no flour, lots of easy instructions. Add add add the cheese at the last 10 minutes of cooking. They will burn otherwise. I had two cups of broth from a can, a cup and a half of water, and the rest was milk. It's so delicious.

I didn't exactly follow the quantities.. I just took the ingredients and added until it tasted good. I was super impressed. I served it with some fresh crusty bread.

Yum! We are vegetarian so I sub veggie broth for the chicken and it works great. Definitely just cook the broccoli with the potatoes for a few minutes to avoid an extra step and extra pan/steamer. I also like to add a bay leaf and about 2 tsp poultry seasoning to give it a bit more depth of flavor, be sure to remove the bay leaf before pureeing.

Thank you - this was so easy, and very good.  I added more broccoli than the recipe called for, and I added it straight to the pot with the potatoes.

Awesome!  I now make this soup about once a week.  I use frozen broccoli and cook it in the boiling water.  I use 2 bouillon cubes instead of 4 and add a tablespoon of Cajun powder for a little kick.  My husband calls it "crack soup" since it's that addicting.

Excellent soup! I've made it twice in the past two weeks and both times have been awesome. I use olive oil in place of butter (healthier) and vegetable stock in place of chicken (vegetarian boyfriend). I also use more seasonings, adding fresh minced garlic to the onion about 2 minutes before adding the potatoes, water, and bullion. I use a little cayenne, chili powder, and oregano as well. We like spice! Less cheese and because we don't have a blender or a food processor, I just used the ladel to kind of mash the vegetables in the pot. As other reviewers have noted, it's not necessary to cook the broccoli separately, just add in towards the end, fresh tastes the best! I did put a dollop of sour cream in my bowl upon serving, makes it a little bit creamier but completely not necessary if you're looking to keep the calories down!! Delicious, this will be part of our recipe rotation going forward!!!

This recipe was perfect for my boyfriend and I! We both love cream of broccoli soup, however he is recently lactose and tolerant and his system can't handle heavy cream.  This was a delicious creamy substitute.  I recommend it served with a no-rise cheesy potato bread as well!

This soup is delicious!!  I used some of the other suggestions and reduced the amount of onion, added a little minced garlic and just cooked the broccoli in the soup the last few minutes with the potatoes. My 2 and 4 yr old even ate this!! Definitley a keeper!

Definitely use garlic!  To puree it I used an immersion blender directly in the pot to save on cleanup.  Also, I didn't care much for the grainy texture at first, but after adding a half pkg of cream cheese to the soup and working it in, I was very pleased.

I originally tried this soup with leftover broccoli and now ill only use non-frozen. The pound measurements got a little confusing- so id say equal parts chopped broccoli, cubed potatos and shredded cheese, and 2/3 minced onion. Also threw the whole thing in blender on lowest setting to maintain a soup consistency rather than large chunks with a broth.

Mmmm, I really liked this.  The only thing I changed was I used homemade chicken stock instead of the water/chicken bouillon.  I think homemade stock makes a big difference in soup.  I also didn't really measure the cheese, but used a lot.  I loved it with all of the cheese, but agree with other reviewers that you don't really need it.  It tasted great before I added the cheese.  So I may make it with less next time.  Yum, so much better than any restaurant soup.

i used veggie stock instead of chicken, and i stopped at the point before adding the cheese and just stirred grated cheddar into my bowl to taste and let it melt. very delicious, but i think next time i will reduce the amount of water/stock used as i ended up pureeing 3/4 of the soup rather than 1/2 to get it to what i considered a thick enough texture. all in all, however, a good recipe!

Good and simple but, I don't think anyone would be begging for a copy of this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was just okay and so then I added some ham and it was better.

My family loves this recipe--it has become a regular at our home!  I have made it so many times.  I only use 1 cup of onions, put in 4 heaping cups of potatoes, add 3 cloves of garlic, add the broccoli to boil with the potatoes, and I never need to add as much cheese as it suggests.  My husband likes it best when I add ham or bacon...but it tastes good without it too.

Wow, this is a really good soup! It's simple, takes only a little time to prepare and tastes great! I added garlic, used less onion and used sharp cheddar cheese. My only complaint was that it was too watery. I would suggest that some flour be added to thicken it up.

We really enjoyed this.  I used Yukon gold potatoes which seem to stay more firm.

I made this soup with a can 32 oz box of veggie broth and a cup of water.  I used the "boat motor" to puree it after I added the broccoli but before I added the cheese.  I also used smoked gouda.  The texture was a little off---kinda grainy.  I wish I tasted it before I pureed it to see if I would have liked that.  I also thought it needed a little salt and pepper.

My husband and daughter both told me "this soup rocks!" and I agree. Great recipe. I did add the broccoli to the potatoes to skip a step, halved the onion, and I mashed with a potato masher instead of using a processor. That made it very quick and easy. Thanks!

Great comfort food. I would recommend using the less sodium chicken stock - it was a bit too salty.

I thought this recipe was wonderful, I also added the broccoli to the boiling potatos the last 3-4 minutes and cooked the broccoli in the soup instead of steaming it, but all in all was a great tasting hearty soup

This recipe would probably have been good but I obviously did something wrong. Part of the problem was that I used mashed potatoes that I had leftover instead of whole potatoes. This turned out more like thick baby food than soup. Next time I will follow the instructions more carefully!

Excellent recipe!  I made this a few weeks ago for a dinner party (the theme was comfort food) and it was tasty and filling.  This recipe makes A LOT of soup.  I doubled it, to make sure I had at least 6 hearty portions and we ended up with enough for at least 20.  I certainly won't complain since I froze it up and will eat it throughout the next few weeks.  Definitely not a "light" recipe, but great for cold winter days.

I thought it was deliscous, and so did my family! My boyfriend is not a big fan of soup or broccoli and he had 2 servings. I followed the recipe, but I myself didnt care aboutthe chunks of potatoes, next time, I will purree all the potatoes and usse a little less potatoes. I will probably increase the amount of broccoli.

I had HIGH hopes for this recipe and was thrilled everything was in the house for it.  BUT, it was gritty, grainy, and salty.  I was thoroughly disappointed!!  I read each review and wrote down all the necessary changes, but the texture and taste were just not adequate.  Bummer!!

I think this recipe was delicious and hearty! The prep time can be a chore, especially if you're sick like me, lol. But the cook time was surprisingly quick. I seasoned the sauteed onions with garlic powder. I didn't have any bouillon cubes, so I just used a handy can of cream of chicken soup, also per the advice of a poster, I just boiled the broccoli with the potatoes. Soup does thicken after refrigeration (potatoes absorb water), so just add milk until desired consistency per serving. Will make again and again (and again!)

This is so easy and yummy. I just used boxed chicken broth, simmered the potatoes for 10 minutes and added the broccoli and simmered another 10 minutes. Blending is easy with a hand immersion blender. I then added some leftover roasted chicken. I sent a thermos full with my husband and his friend on a fishing trip. The next day, his friend's wife was calling me for the recipe!

This soup was very good, but I did make some additions to it. I added minced garlic when I sauteed the onions and when I pureed half the soup I added some cooked carrots. Also, I did not use 3 cups of cheese, probably 1 1/2 cups and it came out wonderfully. I love thick soups on cold days with a slice of Italian bread.

This turned out great.  I changed a few things: used butter instead of margarine, 6 cups of better then bouillon instead of water and cubes, 5 cups of broccoli, steamed, and added 1/4 cup of fresh basil.  I pureed everything.  I chose a very strong cheddar cheese after reading the other posts.  I also followed other posters' recommendations and added 2 T minced garlic with the onion and a can of cream of chicken soup with the cheese.  I served this soup with French bread and sour cream.  Definitely a keeper but not as easy as original recipe.  Thanks -

This was awesome, I really enjoyed it and the only thing I did different was used velveeta instead of cheddar and I used 1/2 cup less. I also added alot of pepper and a small amount of crushed red pepper. This was really good. Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe. Total comfort food, but if you cut back on the cheese, it's not as unhealthy as cream-based soups. I vary it a little each time, sometimes adding corn or carrots or both, and I use way less cheese than called for. Overall one of my favorites. The only complaint I have is that the broccoli stinks something fierce when you cook it, but oh well.

I don't really know what to think about this soup.  First of all, it was not really a soup.  More like a thick mush.  That is not to say that it didn't taste good, but it certainly didn't look appealing.  Secondly, it just didn't have a lot of flavor.  I love broccoli, potatos, and cheese, but this soup just seemed to be lacking any zip that would make it truly delicious. That said, I did use Colby Jack instead of cheddar, since that was what I had in the house.  I'm sure that if I used a sharper cheese, such as the cheddar, it would have been a bit more tasty.  Definitely a good recipe to give a try, but don't expect soup magic! :) Thanks.

Oh yum!!! Total comfort food. I only used 2 pounds potatoes and one bag of frozen broccoli.  I sauteed one clove of garlic, minced, with the onion and didn't bother cooking the broccoli separately - it cooked fast enough once I threw it in with the potatoes and let it simmer for a bit.  As per the suggestions of other reviewers, I used a one pound block of velveeta - I have never purchased velveeta before and was shocked that it was not in the cheese section...a little disturbing, but good!!!  Not that I am going to turn my back on real cheese, but the velveeta was not bad.  Oh, and I pureed all of the soup, not just half - pretty much so that the broccoli hating fiance would not turn his nose up at it before trying it.  Success!!

Wonderful soup!  I added some sage, marjoram, and tumeric (for more of an orange flavor), and also about one cup of the cheese I made a skim mozzerella.  The soup was smooth (I pureed it entirely).  It was very easy, and certainly worth making again.

It was just me, so I halved it.  I used some frozen chopped onion ("seasoning blend") and half a bag of frozen broccoli, which I cooked separately.  I added the broccoli and the cooking liquid, too.  This soup is so quick and easy and comforting and delicious.  Thanks!

This was the best soup that I have ever made.  My husband loved and begs me to make it every week! Very easy to make and taste like it was homemade

I liked the texture of the soup, but thought it needed something.  I added cooked bacon to the next day leftovers and it was great.  Next time I will definately include the bacon.

This soup is fantastic!!! I also fried up bacon and sauteed the onions in the drippings. I also added carrots. I will make this again and again!!!
