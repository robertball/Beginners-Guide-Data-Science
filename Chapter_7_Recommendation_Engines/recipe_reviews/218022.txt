Living in the PNW, it was almost NOT possible for me to make this recipe with canned blackberries. Oregon is known for their Blackberries for "crying-out-loud!" I wanted to rate it fairly, so I did use canned. (can't believe I did that) Anyway, I really liked that the cobble had a bottom. That's something I will do from now on when baking ANY cobbler. Here's what I didn't like about this recipe. Shortening in the crust. Next time I make, I will use butter. The flavor was good, but I would have prefered to use fresh blackberries. It was really just "good," not great.

This was really good!  I subbed blueberries for the blackberries and also used unsalted butter for the shortening.  It was delicious with fresh whipped cream....  Thank you!
