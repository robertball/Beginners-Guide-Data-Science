Really great, something different for dinner! I just left out the peas (don't like them) and I seasoned my chicken before I cooked it.  It was very filling and tasted great.  I also used turkey bacon which is a little healthier, but it still tasted great.  I did have to add a bit more oil because i didn't have much bacon grease.  Overall a great meal, WILL be making again!

My (somewhat) picky husband thought this was great.  I thought it was good too.  I added some cheese (I had just a little left in the package and thought I would use it up) to the casserole part before adding the eggs and I also mixed the bacon into the potatoes instead of sprinkling it on top.  Also, I used shredded frozen hashbrowns instead of potatoes.  It was a great recipe to "clean out the fridge"!  Thanks!

Did not turn out awesome for me, was just okay. The chicken felt a bit out of place, and I suggest substituting ham. The potatoes also turned out a bit dry. Dish was bland overall - definitely needed a liberal dash of hot sauce.

This is one great meal! We are bacon addicts in our house, so we cooked up the entire pack of bacon, not just 4 strips. I didn't have an onion, so I used onion powder. I also left out the vegetable oil, cooking a whole pack of bacon gave us enough grease to cook with. We didn't use peas, corn, or parsely because this is more of a breakfast dish and we didn't feel like vegging it up! We have made this twice, once with chicken and once without, and honestly we didn't even notice the chicken when it was in it. This is a dish that you can add whatever you want and it will be delish! I highly recommend giving it a try!

Made according to the recipe minus the parsley. It was pretty good but just a little bland like something was missing and a little dry. Maybe I over-cooked it. Next time I'm going leave the eggs a little runny like sunny-side up. Also, I ate it when hot sauce and it was good.

My husband and I made this for supper last night. It was really good! We added it to our recipe book. We wanted to try something different.

Very good, adaptable recipe.  I used already cooked chicken that I added at the end.  I sauteed carrots and fresh corn(because I had it)  with the onion and garlic and skipped the frozen veggies. There are 7 of us, so I cooked the eggs separately in the oven, shirred.  The whole group asked that I make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My fiance, my daughter and I all enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I left out was the parsely.
