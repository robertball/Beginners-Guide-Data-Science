Good recipe but to much honey for me. My mother enjoyed them and I had fun making them! REVISION: After the first batch came out of the oven, I added cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pecans to the mix. They came out OK, but when I tried them the next morning, they were much better.

These cookies turned out super yummy for me! I had to make some substitutions due to dietary restrictions. I did Agave syrup instead if honey and a flax seed/ water mixture instead if eggs. I also lowered the temp to 350

Very good recipe.  They are not going to take the place of a traditional nut butter cookie, but they are a delicious paleo substitute.  I use 1/2 cup honey (based on the review that said the amount called for is too much) and that was enough.  I also substituted dark chocolate chips for the raisins.

We added Cranberries instead of raisins and one cup of coconut. It was amazing.                  -Nancy

I opted for apricots instead of raisins because it's what I had on hand.  Very healthy and yummy treat.

I used peanut butter instead of almond butter and chocolate chips instead of raisins. The flavour was good but the cookies is slightly dry. Also 14 min was way too long my cookies burned on the bottom, my second batch I did 9 min and that was much better.

It was ok but I really liked them stale with coffee for breakfast.  Next time I will add nuts.
