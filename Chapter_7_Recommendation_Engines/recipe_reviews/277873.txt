Very tasty!  I will say that it is important to pay attention to the cook's notes, as BBQ seasonings can differ greatly.  I used McCormick BBQ seasoning and the mix was really lacking any sweetness.  I ended up melting brown sugar, a little salt, and butter together, tossing it with the not-sweet-enough snack mix, and throwing it back in the oven at 250 for 45 minutes (tossing every 15 minutes).  Totally corrected for the seasoning issue!
