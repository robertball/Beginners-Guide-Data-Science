Turned out great I did add some extra spices.  I used jiffy cornbread mix and it gave the dressing a sweet taste but not overly sweet.

I've made this so many times at the holidays here in Texas.  It's so much like my grandmas recipe- she would be proud of me!  My coworkers say its the best they have ever eaten, which is a compliment for someone my age!

This is a good basic recipe. I add sauted bell pepper, celery, onion, mushrooms to crumbled corn bread.  I also add raw eggs before baking to bind together.  I add a small jar of pimentos for color.  I add (1) cooked chicken that I have shredded.  I also add half a bag of Pepperidge Farms stuffing mix and 4 pieces of toast that is broke up into pieces.  I stir several times while it cooks.  This is a meal in itself.

This recipe was incredible! This was my first Thanksgivings dinner and I'm no chef. My entire meal came from allrecipes.com and everything was perfect. This dressing was so good it was the first thing to go. This will be on my Christmas menu and many other menus throughout the year.

As the original cooks of the family hang up their aprons, I've been forced to learn and this recipe was perfect! With some tips from my mom, I did some slight changes:  I used both yellow and mexican style cornbread mix (by Martha White), gives it great flavor and a little spice. I saute my celery, onions and green bell peppers. I use raw eggs to bind and no hard cooked eggs.  On occassion I add shredded turkey.  I'm hungry for it again.

I had been looking for a traditional, southern dressing recipe and this was perfect. I added 1/2 cup more broth (we like our dressing very moist), and extra spices (1 t. thyme and 1 t. savory). It was excellent!

Nice cornmeal texture but bland taste.  Very plain like cornbread.  Might have been better with a sweeter cornbread mix and more flavorful additives.

I made this last week to test for Thanksgiving and really loved it.  I sauteed the onions, celery in butter.  Also cooked a chicken breast and shredded it to put in the dressing, and since I was not cooking a turkey for broth, used canned broth.  I added some crusty bread pieces to the cornbread.  Used the hard cooked eggs, but also added an uncooked egg to the dressing.  It was really good and will be on my menu for Thanksgiving coming up soon!

I made my two cornbread loaves using Jiffy mix.  For each loaf I added an extra egg, half a stick of melted butter, and 1/4 cup of sugar.  Requires a slightly longer cooking time, but it is well worth it. Followed this dressing recipe pretty closely (except the boiled egg) and it was divine!

I found this too dry for my taste and not enough flavor.  If most of the broth was from boiled chicken parts, it would be excellent. Dressing needs chicken fat to really shine, and the standard broth does not impart enough.

Texas cornbread dressing at it's finest. Although I never got my grandmother's recipe (she never wrote her recipes down), it takes just like hers. I've been making this for the last two Thanksgivings - just now getting around to rating the recipe. I get all kinds of compliments on it.

I picked this recipe as it was closest to what my mom made. Mine turned out a little dry only because I didn't add all the chicken broth/stock it called for. It said add till moist not wet, so I was afraid to add more. It was good and the gravey helped!

Tastes very similar to my grandma's dressing.  I never got the recipe from her so I was thankful to find this one.  I made it for my hubby and son and both ate it all and wanted more.  My other grandmother used to put some chopped jalapeno peppers in her dressing to spice it up a little.  I might try this next time with half the dressing and leave the other half the same.   Thanks for submitting!

My first time making cornbread dressing was a big success!! We did a ham for Christmas so I didn't have any turkey broth. I just used more chicken broth. I also don't use the boxed cornbread. I made Great-Grandma Steinbeck's Cornbread (Johnny Cake) from AR. Just one batch of cornbread was plenty. This was so good. I won't be waiting til next Christmas to make it again, that's for sure! Thanks for the recipe.

so quick and easy and definitely Texas-style, but I think using homemade cornbread like my mom does instead of a package would've made a huge difference in giving it more flavor and "tooth".  Now I know why she starts cooking Thanksgiving dinner the Sunday before! :) No fault of this particular recipe, but I would've done that if I had more time to prepare. From now on, I'll use this as my go-to mixture and make the cornbread from scratch.

I am a big fan of stuffing. I use Jiffy's cornbread mix & it comes out great. I bake the cornbread as ?the box suggested. Sauteed onions, celery, red bell pepper & garlic cloves in a pan of olive oil. Once translucent i pour in a can of chicken stock, as well as meat drippings if I'm baking any kind of meat, Dash of sage & stir till it comes to a boil. Pour all of that into ?the pan of cornbread & stir & form then bake for 30 minutes. Once done, Deelish!!!

This is a basic recipe that my mom and grandmother used but they added poultry seasoning as well which gave it a little more flavor, about 1 Tbsp. or to taste. You can also add a tad sugar to sweeten it if you like.

This is my standard go to recipe for Thanksgiving dressing. The name is perfect because it tastes exactly like my Mama's and Granny's and great-granny's recipe that I've been eating my whole life.  Anybody who grew up in Texas and ate cornbread dressing for Thanksgiving, look no further, this is recipe we all grew up with. Tastes like my childhood.

This was a great great cornbread dressing.  I made it for thanksgiving.  I did however did not all of the chicken broth the recipe called for only because I was scared it would be to mushy.  But it still turned out great.  I will be keeping this and making it again for Christmas.

This is the first time I have ever made cornbread dressing and it came out perfect. A couple of things I changes was that I used turkey ground, garlic sausages and 2 cans of cream of chicken. Everyone who tried it just loved it. Thanx alot.

This is exactly what I was looking for I have misplaced my great aunt's recipe and this is as close as I could get only thing is it needs way more seasoning. I added 2 tablespoons of sage and 1 tablespoon of poultry seasoning. It looks a little green but that is exactly how it is supose to be. I also use Jiffy cornbread mix and add 1 tablespoon of sugar to each package just to sweeten it up a bit. My family LOVES this so much that I usually have to make 2 or 3 batches :)

I saute'd celery, onions and green peppers in butter, boiled my own broth using chicken thighs and chicken broth.  I baked with it covered for 30 min and uncovered for 15.  It turned really well.  I'll use this recipe again

Hubby handled this one, and did a fantastic job!  Was a bit weary  about the eggs but they were a nice addition.  He made a few changes to the spices as we were out of sage.  He added Thyme & Oregano instead.  Turned out delish, will make again next Thanksgiving for sure!

I have made this every year for the last 10 years or so. It is just like my Grandma's.  I add extra sage and sometimes I use 1/2 c melted butter as another reviewer suggested.  Thank you for helping me recreate my Grandma's treasured cornbread dressing!

I'm so glad you put a recipe for a small crowd! I'll be cooking for only 4 people this Thanksgiving, and this helped a lot with the measurements! Making several changes to make it more like my family's favorite :
1. We don't put chicken in ours. I'm going to add in enough packaged dressing mix and fresh mushrooms to roughly equal the quantity of chicken used.
2. Substituting a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of chicken for the turkey stock, with extra broth on hand in case it's too dry.
3. I always cook the veggies in butter first. 
4. Not traditional, but out of necessity, I'm cooking it in a crockpot on low for about 4 hours. 

All of these changes are simply based on preferences, though. Being in Texas, we all have our favorite dressing recipe that Grandma made, and this is really close to mine, without feeding 20 people!

I make this every thanksgiving but wanted it earlier this time! I make mine with homemade cornbread and crumble it up with all of the ingredients, then mix in the broth. I usually use the turkey broth from the turkey because I’m in charge of that, too. It’s always delicious and just the way my momma made it. Hope y’all enjoy!

Very good basic southern recipe. We listened to some reviews about using sweet corn bread mix instead, and while it is good (yet very sweet) I recommend sticking to this original recipe. I've never had very sweet dressing, but we just cooked this to have with brisket (which is very salty) so I think they will complement each other nicely, but next time I'll use the regular corn bread mix for sure.

It was good but you should definitely sauté the celery onions and garlic in butter beforehand to add extra flavor! Then it would be 5 stars!

I sautéed the celery and onions in butter before adding to mixture. I also added 7 slices of crumbled white bread to 3 -6 ounce pkgs  of MW buttermilk cornbread (cooked and crumbled)...32 oz of chicken broth was enough to make it very moist.  It was very good!!

I have to admit this one was good only thing i add was some poultry seasoning to it and some of my extra touches to it. Even with the bell pepper it was good,

This recipe is a good base, but I need to find a way to add more flavor.  It's a little bland.  I added some poultry seasoning, and next time I'll include fresh sage.  I used Jiffy cornbread mix, and it was way way too sweet.

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving.  It turned out great.  I didn't use sage or eggs.  I used complete seasoning instead because it's what my mom always used.  I also only used turkey broth.  I also put it together on Wednesday and let is set overnight.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe for Christmas and it turned out great!! I did make some small changes.  I used gluten free cornbread instead of regular cornbread. I didn't use garlic and I used more sage then listed. One teaspoon was not enough for my taste, I could barely taste it.  I didn't use as much celery either and it came out great.  This recipe is so close to my mom's recipe so I was happy I found it. Mine also didn't take that long to cook in the oven, that could be because I used gluten free bread but I only cooked it for 40 minutes.

So thankful for this recipe, it is the closest to my mom's I have found online (she still hasn't shared hers with me.) Only tweaks I made were omitting the sage; I had none on hand & I used homemade cornbread instead of store brand (homemade is always better in my book.) We all loved it!
