Very good and easy. I made it for two, I'm glad I have extra sauce so I'm going to make it again tomorrow. I didn't have any almonds, not sure if I would have used them if I did. Adding that texture seems a bit odd to me.

I was disappointed in this dish. The raspberry sauce was good. The peaches turned brown in the fridge and were not as flavourful as I had hoped. I will not be making this again without some changes to enhance the peach colour and flavour.
