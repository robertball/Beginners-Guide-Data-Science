Great recipe!  I added carrots, onion, bell peppers and broccoli to this to round out the meal.  Using a cast iron skillet, the only thing I would change is to add the cornstarch to the sauce instead of coating the chicken with it, as it stuck to the bottom of the pan while browning.  This one is a keeper!

6.15.19  Wasn’t quite sure about the ginger puree.  What I used was the ginger paste in a tube that you can find in the produce department at the supermarket, and it worked great.  Particularly loved the sauce, and I could see with a little addition of cornstarch, it would make a great sauce for stir fried veggies, as well.  Super quick and easy to make, as well as tasty, and I’m sure it would be equally good using pork.  Winner recipe!
