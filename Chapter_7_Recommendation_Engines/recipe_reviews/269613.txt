Well, bought the taco cheese blend and forgot to use it. It would have been even better with the cheese but I'll admit that I didn't even notice it was missing. This is a great recipe for people on the go with kids. I don't even have kids and this was still a fun recipe that made me feel like a kid while eating it.
