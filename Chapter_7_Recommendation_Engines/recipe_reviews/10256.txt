The basic recipe is about as good as it gets. Nothing fancy about it. Tastes great.

Very good and easy to whip up. I made these for a school bake sale and they turned out fantastic. They were a cake-like brownie. Tasty.

These are perfect! I have been looking for a good recipe since I lost my favorite one in a move. I keep the "basic cookie mix made" and they only take 5 minutes to mix and 25 minutes to bake. 30 minutes and you are done and they are the perfect texture and so chocolaty.

This recipe was super all the way around. It was so quick and easy and baked up perfectly. I added a little more cocoa and some rainbow chips and it was awesome. Thanks! I also love having the basic cookie mix ready to go when I need to make something in a rush. It should last even longer in my freezer!

Excellent. My crew was stoked to find brownies on the menu at the end of supper tonight. Because I was out, I swapped the pecans for almonds. Quite tasty indeed!
