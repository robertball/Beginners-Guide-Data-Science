This was a tasty and moist meatloaf that the whole family loved. I too used stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs. One note on that: If you use stuffing mix, decrease the amount of salt you put in the recipe. The stuffing mix is already loaded with salt and will make the meatloaf too salty tasting.

This really is the best meatloaf! It's  not bland like most meatloaf recipes. I used a very lean meat ground meat, it was so moist! Good-bye dry meat loaf!  I raised the servings to 8, added two full eggs rather than the 1 1/3, used the Bold & Spicy A-1 sauce to give it extra zing..Mmmm,  breadcrumbs I had in the freezer that I had made from whole- wheat bread, toasted, broken up, and put it a Cusinart blender that has super sharp blades. Left out the green peppers as I did not have any, didn't miss them, though I am sure you could add what you like and it would remain awesome providing the liquid level of this recipe is kept in balance with items added.

My family LOVED this recipe and I will make it again. I used canned italian bread crumbs and A-1. Have made it twice and it's been great both times. For those who had problems with crumbling, a little extra egg will do the trick. This meatloaf freezes well too. I sliced mine before freezing it to make for easier reheating and serving. BTW, this goes great with Allie's Delicious Macaroni and Cheese (also from this site) as they both cook at the same temp. and have complimentary flavors. Thanks for a great recipe!

I hate meatloaf, but I really liked this way. Followed the recipe except I didn't put green peppers in it, since I don't like them...turned out great!!

Finally.  A meatloaf that tastes like a meatloaf is supposed to.  I have tried a bunch of recipes, and none were quite right (none were even close to my mom's).  This was the one.  I did read reviews and noted that if you use all A1, it's kind of strong, so I did the A1 in the meatloaf and brushed the top with a bbq sauce I had instead.  Perfect.  Was very happy.  Went to 2-1/2 pounds of meat/2 eggs and it needed to cook longer - did one hour as called for, then upped the temp to 375 for another 15-20 minutes.  Didn't dry it at all.

This recipe is absolutely awesome.  Now I made a few changes but this is THE BEST recipe I've found for meatloaf and TRUST ME I've tried a more than I can count. Here are the changes/additions I made.  I added 1/2 tsp. of dried sage, 1/2 tsp. of dried parsley, added more egg, used cream instead of milk and used crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. Also, instead of brushing the top with the rest of the A-1 steak sauce I combined about 1/3 cup of ketchup with about 3 Tbsp. of brown sugar and waited until it baked for an hour.  Then I turned the oven to broil, brushed the top of the meatloaf with my ketchup mixture and broiled (watching carefully to not burn) until carmelized.  Repeat process until desired crust is achieved....SOO GOOD!  Never had a meatloaf so simple yet so flavorful in my life.  My girlfriend doesn't really like ground beef and certainly didn't like meatloaf...but after making this...her thoughts have changed.  Thanks for sharing the love

I have never liked meatloaf but my dad wanted meatloaf for supper , so I figured I would try this one because it actually sounded good, with the onions and green peppers. It came out fantastic, I actually added bacon to the top of the loaf before baking, and it gave it a wonderful flavor ! Very yummy, has changed my view of meatloaf!

This is the meatloaf I was raised on. Only thing Mom did differently was omit the salt. This is a solid meatloaf that won't fall apart when you go to cut it and it makes great meatloaf sandwiches. When I make this now, I add garlic powder and sometimes a teaspoon or so of italian seasoning. This is also good to make an open faced meatloaf sandwich with mashed potatoes and a good brown gravy. Total comfort food.

Five stars alone just for the addition of the steak sauce (I used A-1) which was a unique and quite tasty addition, but unfortunately it was not enough to carry the meatloaf. This needs a lot of help, but definitely has potential - but with all the tweaking I feel is necessary it wouldn't be the same recipe. This needs a whole lot more than just steak sauce! For the bread crumbs I used crushed, herb-seasoned stuffing mix.  I also added fresh parsley, sage, thyme and a healthy dose of Chicago Steak Seasoning. Once mixed it was drier than I would have preferred, so I gave it a couple shots of ketchup which was just fine since I felt it could use a little tomato flavor to balance the A-1 anyway. Rather than baking this in a loaf pan I just shaped and baked it on a foil-lined cookie sheet and it was perfectly done in an hour (160 degrees). Once sliced and eaten hubs and I both agree that while it was flavorful (why wouldn't it be with all the stuff I added to it?) it could have used less bread crumbs and maybe even another egg for a meatier flavor and firmer texture. On its own, however, this recipe is merely a basic, starting point to a potentially great finish.

Very good--great texture.
I used Townhouse reduced sodium butter crackers in place of the bread crumbs.

You can do so many variations of meatloaf! I mixed 1lb grn sirloin and 1 lb ground turkey (makes for tender meatloaf) Instead of steak sauce I added 1 Tblsp of Montreal Steak Seasoning. Used 2 eggs - beaten w/buttermilk & worchester for 2 lbs of meat. I use my own seasoned bread crumbs. Instead of green I subbed finely minced red bell pepper. Subbed 2 tblsp of dried minced onion instead of raw. Also incorporated minced garlic, additional fresh ground pepper and tblsp dried parsley. Squirted a bit of ketchup (approx 1/4C?) into meat mix. I form the meatloaf, wrap in saran wrap and leave in fridge overnight. When ready to cook: I place meatloaf (unwrapped of course) on bread heels & bake on pyrex pan (not in loaf pan) so entire outside browns. The bread eats the grease and you can easily slide if off underside before serving. I also glaze mine with a mixture of BBQ sauce & ketchup. You can be quite creative with ingredients; but plz avoid overworking meat mix or it will be tough. For 2 lb size, this needed 2 hours baking at 375. 350 didn't work for me (it was pretty rare using 350 temp and dinner was late) Going with 375 from now on, 2 hours for 2 lbs; otherwise 1 hour @ 1 lb size. Don't forget to let it rest at least 5 minutes, 10 is better.

My husband who despised meatloaf loved this recipe and has requested that I make it again!  The first time I made it we did not have any green pepper so I substituted chopped mushrooms for the green pepper and it was great.  I had to cut back on the mils as it was a little soggy and had to bake it about 30 minutes extra to get it firmed up.

TIP: Put bread on the bottom of the loaf pan to soak up the grease! ---- Reading other reviews I also sauteed onions/green peppers first then add to mix.  I used 3 TBS of A1 thick & hearty in the mix, then brushed top with BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle). Next time I will use less milk, came out a little soggy compared to other meat loafs I've made through this site. Serve with Ketchup, YUM!

I also have been using the recipe for about 40 years. There is one change that I make however...I add 1/2 cup of onion soup mix and only use 1/2 diced onion. For us, it adds a 'little kick'!

I have made this meatloaf for the last many, many years, but got my recipe from a local newspaper.  I do mix ketsup, yellow mustard and brown sugar together and put on top of the loaf for the last 15 min.  Excellent recipe!!

This really IS the best! I found this recipe a few weeks ago when I had NO idea what to make for dinner. My normally picky husband has never liked any other meatloaf I made ( I tried dozens of recipes) but he absolutely LOVED this one. He liked it so well he had it for lunch the next day and told me I could make this recipe any time I wanted.

This is my go to recipe for meatloaf. I don't really care for meatloaf but with this recipe I even will eat some. My husband loves it. I use Heinz 57 sauce which gives it a great flavor. I also put all of the sauce in the meatloaf and just add a bit on top for flavor. I think putting the full 1/3 cup in the loaf gives it more flavor. This is a regular dinner meal in our house.

I use a similar recipe..but my family doesn't like biting into a veggie so I put the ingredients in a blender before adding to the ground beef.  It will have all the wonderful flavors of the veggies and be very smooth, without any chunks of onion or peppers. Even better for sandwiches the next day!

Nothing really special about this recipe.  Bland and basic.  I wouldn't pass this along as I can't imagine anyone wouldn't know the basic ingredients in ANY meatloaf.  Dissapointed.

I made this for my brothers birthday last week.  I am not a meatloaf fan but WOW!  I absolutely loved this one!  I used stuffing mix instead of the bread crumbs and I did not add the green peppers since my brother does not like them.  My whole family loved it!  I really like the steak sauce instead of ketchup or tomato soup.  Thanks for this great recipe.  I cant wait to make it again.

Single Chick review: I don't know how to cook so I need easy recipes that don't require fancy ingredients and that will feed me for more than just one meal. After seeing that this I could do and after reading other reviewers ideas here is what I did: I used  Progresso Italian bread crumbs as recommended by another reviewer, I also lowered the salt just a tad assuming these flavored bread crumbs would add salt. I don't even like Green Bell Peppers but I added them anyway only as an ode to my Mother, she would not have left them out. I couldn't even really taste them as a stand out ingredient but I am sure they added to the overall flavor. I used A1 Steak Sauce and it was perfect! I also had some bacon laying around in the fridge so I put three strips on top which was a great call considering it was either use it or it would be going bad soon in my fridge. I served this (to my self) with Stoffers frozen Mac & Cheese and some frozen green beans on the side. I poured myself a glass of $8 a bottle wine it is was heaven! After pre slicing it I will be freezing half for future dinners and use the other half for this week dinner and/or cold sandwiches. This is a home run for people that are not chefs, cook only for them selves and have the need for future meals.
Bon appétit single ladies!

I am always very leary of recipes that start off with "The Best... in most cases, they are not! I have made dozens of meatloaf recipes over the years, and the best by far is the "Two Fat Ladies" "Hedgehog" by far and away the most tasty and gourmet meatloaf I have EVER made!

Getting back to this meatloaf recall eating this same recipe in the US Army. It's not the Best , or even close to the best, it is. however very edible...I think you get my point.

This is almost my exact recipe.  Instead of bread crumbs I use dry oatmeal.  My whole family loves this and will not eat anyone else's meatloaf!  It has been tried and true for over 30 years!

I have never been a fan of meat loaf, but my husband is, so I decided to try this one.  I didn't have Heinz 57, so I sub'ed Jack Daniel's Smokey Steak Sauce. OMG! It was awesome!! My hubby and I both agree, it was the best meatloaf either of us had ever tasted. I shaped and froze half of the mixture before cooking, as there are only the two of us, I'll cook up that one next week. It's even great cold in a sandwich!

A huge hit!  Served this with "badda bing badda banged potatoes" from this sight and my husband said "That was awesome, like showing off good"  I mostly followed the recipe.  I sauted the onions and bell pepper just a little before adding them.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and bold and spicy A1 for the steak sauce and whole milk.  This is going in the favorites recipe book at home.

My husband, 15 year old & I made this for the first time tonight & love it! I didn't use green pepper because we didn't have one & it was fine. I also substituted dry Italian bread crumbs for the fresh & ketchup for the steak sauce. Lastly, we used a mix of ground beef, veal & pork instead of just beef like my parents always did. Super delicious & moist! Thank you Denelle! :)

Leave out the steak sauce and use ketsup with dark brown sugar until it taste sweet for a sauce and top with 3 strips of bacon. Promise this is juicy and full of flavor. To me, the steak sauce gives an artificial flavor.

I made this meatloaf last night with a few modifications, I used 4 cloves of garlic, sliced, 2 eggs to help hold its shape better, and whole wheat canned bread crumbs (which I will never use ever again since they overpowered the flavor of everything else). I also used sliced mushrooms in favor of the bells since we dislike bell peppers. My fiance also prefers his meatloaf to have a tomato flavor, so I put 3 tbsp heinz 57, and 3 tbsp tomato ketchup, then for the topping, I took 1/4 of a jar of marinara I had left over and mixed it with 4 tbsp tomato ketchup and watered it down a little (only brushed enough to coat on the top and saved the rest to brush on each individual piece). 
I had to increase the time in the oven by about 30 minutes and it was WONDERFUL~!!~ (except for the whole wheat breadcrumbs!!!!)
Served with homemade Garlic Chive Red Skinned Mashed Potatoes, and Steamed Broccoli (YUMMY!!)

My fiance is an incredibly picky eater, and even pickier on his meatloaf and he loved it! (and that's sayin something!)
Thanks so much!

I didnt really like this meatloaf but my boyfriend and mother did. I am not sure if they were just being nice. It was almost soggy and mushy. I also didnt like the overpowering taste of the steak sauce. I was moist, but maybee too moist.

I have always made mine this way also. I sometimes do a variation to this and add spahgetti sauce instead of the steak sauce! This gives you a way to mix it up a little for a change!!

This was a great meatloaf; I am saving this as my go-to meatloaf recipe.  I think I will saute the onions and green pepper next time so the onion isn't so strong.  Loved it though! Thanks.

Everyone loves this meatloaf.  It has become my specialty that family looks forward to when they come over.  I definitely recommend using the veal, beef, and pork combo and Smith & Wollensky steak sauce is a must!!!!  I made it once with another brand and it wasn't the same.  I also omit the peppers because I don't like them.

This was a really good meaty meatloaf.  It had a great consistency and held together well.  I used stuffing mix instead of the bread crumbs and omitted the onion and green peppers (my kids don't like them if they can see them).  I also added some garlic powder and some pepper jack cheese and mixed ketchup and a little brown sugar with the steak sauce for the topping.  We will be making this one again.

the best and easiest meatloaf i've ever made. I thought with so few ingredients it won't have much flavor but it was so good there wasn't any left over. I'm already planning on making it again next week. It's a keeper.

This was a huge hit! I used 1 lb of lean ground beef, a cup of dried stuffing mix, 1 onion, 1 green pepper, 1 egg, 5 T of A1, a pinch of salt and pepper. I cooked it in muffin tins topped with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Delicious!

I ate 4 slices, that says a LOT since I have never been a meatloaf fan.  I doubled the recipe and made 2 loaves (one to freeze).  Followed the directions closely, with a few small exceptions.  BF isn't crazy about steak sauce, so I put the 3T of steak sauce IN the mix, but topped them with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce (Vidalia, because I love that on beef).  I also added a pinch of garlic powder and reduced the milk just a little.  I chopped the onions and peppers fairly small, and they were still a tad firm.  Fine with me, the flavor was outstanding!  I spooned off some of the grease after about 60 mins, and let them bake for a total of 90 mins (for 2).  Just right on the moisture and they held together fine.  BF said it was the best meatloaf he's ever had.  A keeper for us!  Thanks so much.

I make meatloaf pretty often cause it's inexpensive and I've tried a lot of recipes... none with steak sauce which I LOVED about this meatloaf.  I used A1 thick & hardy.  I also used artisan crusty garic bread that I made into bread crumbs and added a couple cloves of garlic.  Didn't have onions or bell pepper because I don't have any (need to go shopping!) & cooked it for about 50 minutes... soooo good, thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I minced the peppers and onions and added a teaspoon of minced garlic. I put 1/4 cup ketchup in the mixture along with the steak sauce. Per the recommendations of others, I put two pieces of bread at the bottom of the loaf pan and the meatloaf was perfectly moist without being greasy. Great "crust" on the outside. This is the only meatloaf recipe I will ever use.

WONDERFUL!! Best meatloaf EVER! And it's so simple! I added an extra onion and a full cup of diced green bell pepper. It was nice and juicy! In addition, I used 1 cup packaged dry stuffing (instead of the soft bread crumbs)--this was recommended in one of the reviews. I also used more steak sauce on the top of the meatloaf--about 1/3 cup on the top of the meatloaf alone.

This really is a wonderful meatloaf recipe. I have searched far and wide and have made many a meatloaf and this is where the search ends! Which makes my husband very happy because he's had to choke down a lot of bad meatloafs! I followed the recipe and only changed the topping. I made a mixture of ketchup, mustard powder, brown sugar and steaksauce. The steaksauce is what makes this meatloaf great and I just used what I had on hand which was a store brand steaksauce. I also completly forgot to put in the green peppers but we didn't miss them and won't add them next time I make this. I served mine with wild rice and green beans and eveyone went back for seconds. I love this meatloaf!

This recipe tasted great and was easy. I did use Italian bread crumbs instead of regular ones. Also, I do like onions, but I thought this recipe call for too many. Maybe cut it down to 3/4 to 1/2 a cup next time.

Delicious!! I doubled the recipe to 12 servings and changed a couple of things, but all in all it was a big hit with my family and guests! I happen to have a bunch of cut up yellow, red, and green peppers (about 1 & 1/2 cups worth) and threw them in mix. I also actually added the entire 1/3 cup of steak sauce straight to the mix. (I was supposed to use 2/3 cup because I doubled the recipe but was afraid it would be too much) I also only used 1 teaspoon of salt. I then took a little extra steak sauce (About 1/4 cup) and mixed it with about a 1/4 cup of honey smoked barbecue sauce and brushed it on the top before baking... It came out moist and delicious! Thanks Denelle for a wonderful recipe!

I have been looking for a good meatloaf recipe for awhile, this is really good.  My error that I only added 3TBSP of steaksauce, but it still turned out good. The texture is moist, but not too wet. I added ketchup and more green pepper on top and my husband and I really liked it.

I traded in the sauce for ketchup and took out the peppers and I got a very plain, very yummy meatloaf that was perfect to pair with... anything!

Very good! I will say that next time I will cook my onion and pepper first then mix it in. I didn't like some crunchy onions in there.

This smelled like heaven the minute it went in the oven.  Didn't turn out quite perfectly but I take the blame.  When I make this again (and I will!) I will chop the onion and pepper smaller.  It didn't quite hold together but I think getting the veggie pieces smaller will help.  I used A1 Cajun sauce and it was fabulous.  Because the sauce is already spicy, I might omit the additional pepper next time. 

This truly is one of the best smelling dinners I have ever made.  The meat I used was a meat loaf blend of ground beef, ground pork and ground veal.  O.M.G.  Definitely will make this again and went back for a second serving even though it fell apart.  YUM.

I thought this was very good.  I used A1 sauce and thought the flavor was very pronounced, but I like that flavor.  The house smelled amazing!  I used two pounds of meatloaf mix, 2 eggs, 1.5 cups bread crumbs, and chopped onion too.  Same recipe, just more of everything basically.  I cooked it in a slightly larger than loaf pan for about 1hour 20 mins.  Moist and flavorful!

I dislike ketchup, so I recently started using Heinz 57 sauce and I'm certain this meatloaf is better than any ketchup version! After brushing the top with steak sauce, sprinkle rosemary on top. You won't be sorry (I don't even recipe--I can't speak for the ketchup versions, though).

GREAT recipe! I just used ketchup instead of BBQ sauce and my meatloaf came out perfect.  My husband loved it and a friend who joined us for dinner complimented with "this is really good meatloaf" (he's not very creative).  Thanks for sharing!

Made this as stated and felt like it was okay but needed tweaking. I add some fresh garlic, montreal steak seasoning, seasoned bread crumbs and in addition to the Heinz I also add a little smoky BBQ sauce. I saute the onion and green pepper before adding to the meat mixture as well. I place two slices of bread on bottom of pan to soak up some of the grease. Turns out moist and flavorful. Thanks.

I used half ground beef and half ground turkey. Also used my food processor to cut up some onions, celery and carrots to add into the meatloaf. The stove top stuffing was a nice touch.  Definately worcestershire, ketchup and brown sugar on top made a nice touch to the whole dish.

Oh my goodness!  The best meatloaf ever!  I love meatloaf and have been making a different recipe for years.  We love it, but I was craving something different and tried this recipe.  It is DELISH!  My son does not like the onions in recipe but my husband and I think it is savory and flavorful and great!

It was excellent!  I used A1 steak sauce in the meat mix and brushed the top with ketchup.  I also sauteed the peppers and onions before adding them into the mix.  Everyone loved it!  It was served with roasted chunked potatoes, carrots, and peas (I surrounded the meatloaf with the potatoes from the start and added the carrots and peas about 20-30 minutes before the end).

We're not big meatloaf eaters but this is great! We used Heinz 57, liberally, and this is very tasty. Served with some green beans a great salad and some garlic bread this is one of our favorite meals.

WOW, we love this recipe!  I find it tastes best using butter crackers in place of the breadcrumbs; it gives it a richer flavor.  Also, being cheese lovers, we added small cheese chunks the second time we made it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Here are a few changes I think everyone should make. 1) Saute the garlic, onion, and green peppers to soften them before adding to mix - this will bring out more flavor and the veggies won't be hard when you bite into the loaf.  2) Use a lot of seasoning to add more flavor and ketchup in the mix is still a must.  3) I use Ritz Crackers instead of breadcrumbs and then omit the salt.  4) Add bacon either precooked and broken up, or laid over the top to bake onto the loaf... either tastes great. 5)Add a small amount a Worcestershire sauce and a splash of Tabasco to give it a bit of a kick.  Really can't go wrong with these suggestions.

The only thing I did different was put ketchup and brown sugar on the top for the glaze and added minced garlic to the meat. Also seasoned the meat to my taste.  It was REALLY good.

This was a great meatloaf. I was out of steak sauce so I used kethcup and I also used stove top instead of bread crumbs like some other reviewers. I also used a mix of ketchup, brown sugar and a dash of mustard on the top. My husband is a hard to please meatloaf connoisseur and he couldn't get enough!

My husband and I LOVED this meatloaf.  He is a big fan of Heinz 57 sauce though!  The only deviation I made was to use 1/2 lb. of sweet Italian sausage and 1 lb. of ground beef because I selected a ground beef that was 90% lean and I was afraid it would be too dry otherwise.  It was excellent!  What did not get eaten that night was taken in his lunch every day thereafter until it was gone!

My husband and I have enjoyed this recipe all autumn. The A-1 sauce was too smokey, we prefer ketchup and use turkey burger. 
Another reviewer suggested the TWO FAT LADIES Hedgehog meatloaf recipe. I couldn't resist looking it up. While it was too high in cholesterol for us, we will probably adapt the spices. Nutmeg is a splendid secret incredient.

I have the same receipe, but use 1-2T Steak sauce , no milk, ketchup as needed to make meat moist. I then put it in the pan & top with some ketchup. Bake 350 for 1 hr.
It is a good recipe either way.

It has been a long time since I had had meatloaf and the memories I have had of meatloaf were not the best.  However, last night my wife made this and it was delicious.  Everything works perfectly in this recipe and it came out nice and moist.  We will definitely be having this again.

Disappointing.  Didn't realize that something could be intense and bland at the same time.  The steak sauce sounded like a great idea in a meatloaf (I used A1)  but was less flavorful than I was expecting and left a strange aftertaste.  It wasn't AWFUL, but
I will not make this again.

I have been making this recipe for years and it's the only one my husband and kids will eat.  I don't put the sauce on top of meatloat, I just mix it all in.

I tried this with Moose meat. Very superb recipe. Quick and easy to prepare. Next time I will saute the onions a little first though. By accident I put all of the 57 sauce into the mix, so I chose not to put any more on top.

Here's how to use 2 full lbs of meat and get 2 loaves for 6 servings (one loaf for freezing):

I used 2 lbs ground, pasture-raised beef, 85% lean. Added 2 chopped organic (pastured) chicken livers for extra nutrients.

Used italian bread crumbs, 1 whole red bell pepper, 1 onion, and 2 eggs. For the remaining ingredients I eyeballed the addition of a little extra to make up for the extra 1/2 lb of meat. For the seasoning I followed the measurements but used half steak sauce and half worcestershire sauce.  Best I've ever made!

I cooked this on my drum smoker with hickory at 350° in a perforated wok so the grease would drain off. Put a foil pan under the wok to catch the grease. Used red bell pepper instead of green. I'd rate it Most Tasty!!! A good layer of ketchup on top really takes the smoke flavor. Smoked meatloaf is something you need to try.

I left out the pepper and made my own steak sauce, otherwise followed the recipe. This was the best meatloaf I've ever made! I put sliced bread in the bottom of the pan, that helped the grease, and the meatloaf was very moist. This is a great recipe, thank you!

I loved this meatloaf! It was the most moist and possibly the best meatloaf I've ever had! I doubled the amount of steak sauce and used 2 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of bread crumbs, I skipped the green bell pepper because I didn't have one, and used 1/2 a large onion (which was more than plenty). I would have never dreamed of using steak sauce but I absolutely loved it! I have had bad luck with meatloaf until this recipe!

I thought this was the best meatloaf recipe I have ever tasted! I'm not a huge fan of onions but my husband is so I cut the onion portion by almost half and it still tasted great. I also changed the steak sauce topping. I mixed 1/2 Cup of Ketchup, 1 Tbsp of Mustard, and 3 to 4 Tbsp of steak sauce - it was great!:)

Made this last night for my family and they loved it they even had seconds. I left out the green bell pepper because of my daughter but will try it next time. I think what made it great was the A1 sauce I put in. YUM Will make again and again.

A good, moist meatloaf, but too much onion. I only used 3/4 of an onion, and next time will reduce to 1/3 or 1/2 of a onion.

This recipe is awesome! My husband loves this and will happily do the grocery shopping if he picks up the ingredients from the store for me :) He won't eat any other type of meatloaf now. I add a small bag of 5 minute cook rice to bulk it up so we have leftovers.

It simply is a great and easy recipe.  I've experimented with this recipe several times and in the end, I have decided to customize it to my own taste by not adding the milk because it made it too moist, substituting Heinz 57 sauce with barbecue sauce (1/3 cup barbecue sauce and some ketchup to reach 1/2 cup).  Also, I just mixed the sauce with the ground beef at once instead of following the directions of 3 TBS at first and putting the rest on top later.  To me, I think it is more flavorful if you just mix it up all together plus it's one less step to try to remember.

Great recipe! I added a little paprika, oregano & parsely to the whole mixture and it turned out great! Only thing was mine came out abit "wet" like it didn't set properly but I think that has to do with the frozen meat I used. But still, thanks!

Freakin awesome.  I kinda used the recipe as a base but had to sub a lot of stuff out since I didn't have it all on hand.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, cayenne pepper instead of black pepper, steakhouse flavored barbecue sauce instead of steak sauce, and some salsa instead of the chopped veggies, and it was GREAT!

I made this for company and everyone liked it. I wanted it to brown nicely on the sides, so instead of putting it in a loaf pan I placed the meatloaf on a rack in a roasting pan. The steak sauce produced a beautiful crust on the outside and added a good flavor to the meat. It took over 90 minutes to cook, as opposed to the hour suggested in the recipe. I did use extra lean ground beef, and didn't use a loaf pan, as I stated earlier. This may account for the extra cooking time. Thanks for a good recipe.

This meatloaf was delicious!  Instead of steak sauce I used hot sauce and used tomato paste mixed with brown sugar and a little garlic for the sauce.  I made it with mashed potatoes and spinach with corn muffins. Delish!  Also I omitted the peppers, and used onion powder instead of an onion as my daughter won't eat vegetables that are "hidden".  Definitely a must try!

I have never made meatloaf before and my Mother turned me off on it because hers was always dry and bland.  I made this this evening for my family and am glad I took the chance, it was really moist and importantly good.  I used a package of onion mix as well as chopped onions.  I also added worchestire sauce.  I covered it in foil for 45 minutes and uncovered for anothe 45 minutes.  For the brushing on top, I added ketchup, brown sugar, sweet baby rays bbq sauce and ground mustard.  Then added the rest 15 minutes before it was done.  Delicious!  Bonus:  both my children loved it, one being 3 and the other 16 month old.  That is the golden seal of approval in my book!

Tried this the other night and my husband LOVED it. He bought some more ground beef today and asked me if i could please make it again. He is a picky eater. I am gluten sensitive so i use almond milk and gluten free bread and it works well.

Did not have any A-1 so I used John Boy and Billy's sweet and mild grilling sauce and it was spectacular. In fact it was so good I cut a section off of it and took it to my German mother and sister...They loved it. And let me tell you, they are very tough critics.

On a last note the meatloaf sandwiches were out of this world!!...:) Really great recipe!!

Can't believe how good this is!  I'm stuffed and still want to go get more.  I used A1 and Italian herbed bread crumbs because that is what I had but didn't change anything else.  Very moist but held together well.  This will be made again and again!

Oh so good!! I didn't have onions at the time so I substituted with onion powder and I also didn't use the green pepper because my kids wouldn't eat it. The best meatloaf I have ever had :)

Amazing - using steak sauce is a great change to the traditional meatloaf.  I also use ground turkey in all my meatloaves and its fantastic.

This was the tastiest meat loaf I have made in the 44 years I have been cooking. There is  something about that steak sauce ( I used longhorn steak sauce, made in Louisville Ky). 
My husband raved about it. I sauteed mushroom and added them on top at the end

Good and different as I never use green pepper or steak sauce in my meatloaf. A nice change and the family inhaled it....put this together in the morning in its baking pan, covered with foil and in the fridge it went until time to bake. Served with Ultra Creamy Mashed Potatoes and Garlicky Green Beans with Mushrooms both from this site. Nice comfort meal!! Thanks!

A new and delicious take on meatloaf! I used 2 lbs of meat tho, and 2 eggs instead of 1. For the bread crumbs I just crushed up some croutons. Next time I will use a little less salt. Nonetheless, this is an awesome meatloaf that I plan on making for years to come!

Couldn't find steak sauce in the local shop, so used BBQ sauce instead. Baked for 50 mins in an aluminium foil-lined loaf tin. Turned out soft & flavourful. Will definitely make it again. Thanks for a great recipe - easy & quite healthy :-)

Awesome recipe! Was very moist, not a dry meatloaf at all! I did half the recipe as I was only cooking for 2. In an effort to cut out a few calories I used egg white instead of whole eggs and whole wheat bread crumbs I made. This cut the calories down to aprox 200 per serving (according to myfitnesspal.com) as I estimated half the recipe to yield 4 1-in thick servings. Husband declared the recipe a keeper!

My family loved this meatloaf, I used 2 pounds of ground beef and 2 eggs and it passed the ultimate test my daughter loved it. I also used Progresso Italian style bread crumbs and Hunts meatloaf sauce for the topping. It seemed the steak sauce added an additional  great taste to the meatloaf.

I baked this for one hour 15 minutes and it came out a little underdone - which I didn't mind, since it was super moist that way!  Heating up leftovers finished cooking whatever may not have been fully cooked.  Very good easy meatloaf, will make again!

This was moist and delicious, even though I didn't have any green pepper so I left it out. It did not bind as much as I would have liked though, and tended to crumble when sliced. I added ketchup stripes across the top before baking for a little extra flavor.

I Love this. I am not a meatloaf person AT ALL! But i made a meatloaf that was a mix of this recipe and the "Cheesburger Meatloaf" recipe. I used everything from this recipe but added the cheese in the center and rolled it like in the other recipe! Very delicious and will definitely be made again! I definitely recommend doing this!

Really good.  I even forgot to add the milk, and it turned out fine.  Like others, I sauteed the onions and green pepper before adding them to the meat mixture, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you!

As a kid meatloaf just didn't really appeal to me but this recipe has renewed my meatloaf faith! Soooo good! I have made it with dry fine ground bread crumbs and the stuffing mix. I found it held together better with the stuffing mix. I use HP steak sauce in the meat mixture but brush the top with a generous amount of Bulls Eye Hickory flavored BBQ sauce. *Drool*

This was awsome and versatile. I used herb stuffing mix, dash of garlic powder, some sliced mushrooms, and topped with A-1. I have also topped this with a mixture (equal parts) of Heinz 57 & ketchup and kids as well as adults enjoyed it. Want some zing?...add some green chilies.

Isn't if funny how five people around a table tasting the very same thing can either love it hate it?  Can our taste buds all be that different?  My son and I hated it...my daughter thought it was good...my husband mentioned that it was bland...and my other daughter said all she could taste was steak sauce...go figure.  Will I make this again?  Not a chance.

I made this recipe as stated.  The texture was good, very moist. However it tased exactly like steak sauce. I think I'll stick with a meatloaf recipe that has a variety of flavors to combine for something a little more exciting.

EXCELLENT!!! I had a taste for meatloaf but all the meatloaf recipe's I know  include tomato past or ketchup.  Unfortunately my husband don't like tomato's or anything that comes from them.  So the only way he would agree to eat Meatloaf is if I found a way to make it without Tomato products.  Thank God for All Recipes and this recipe.  My Husband loved it.  He ate at least 3-4 servings.  I made it with home made garlic mashed potatoes.  Delicious!!!

This recipe is great.  My boyfriend hates meatloaf, but says this one is okay...which in his language means great.  :)  I use a little extra Heinz, and of course gravy at the end.  I also put half the meatloaf in, put cheese on half for my boyfriend, then the rest of the meat, then cheese on the same half.  He now LOVES this recipe since the minor change.  I have loved it from the start though.  It really doesn't need to have anything added.  I was a little cautious about putting green peppers in, but man did they give the meatloaf an excellent flavor.  A new favorite for me.  Thanks so much!

My whole family enjoyed this recipe, even those that do not normally like meatloaf. I swapped the milk for water, and it was still amazing. I also cut out the salt!

Just made this last night, and it was fantastic!  Tastes just like Mom's, which is what I was hoping for.  I followed other reviewers' advice for more meat (2 lbs., worctershire sauce, an additional egg and seasoned bread crumbs).  AMAZING.  The green peppers and onions were still crunchy which added great flavour and texture.  I did splurge a bit...instead of regular ground chuck, I used ground sirloin.  It had less than 5% fat, so it didn't turn out all greasy.  Will be making this for a long time to come!

This recipe its wonderful, and its delicious. The variation i did, and it was wonderful, i added to the mixture, some cheese, you can buy somre crumbles of whatever cheese you love. In my house everyone loves american cheese, singles of kraft. This variation takes a  hole new level of flavor. Trust me, and when you get your meatloaf out of the oven, the cheese is melting, inside and its DELICIOUS!

Did not like this at all.  I followed the recipe using A1 as the steak sauce and substituted canned mushrooms for the green bell pepper.  The steak sauce was overpowering and the consistency of the meat loaf was mealy.  Definitely will not make this again.

This is a good recipe.  Instead of bread crumbs I use stove top stuffing and add water to get it mushy.  Also, sometimes I add a tube of breakfast sausage and an extra egg. I don't use a loaf pan either, just shape it into a football and plop it on a foil lined 13x9 pan...easy clean up.

I thought this meatloaf was great, and so did my husband! I did take a few suggestions from the other reviewers. Here is what I did. I only had 1 pound of ground beef so I used that with 1 cup of bread crumbs, 1 envelope of lipton onion soup mix, 1 egg, 1/4 tsp of black pepper, 3 Tbsp of Worcestershire Sauce, 1/4 cup of ketchup. I sautéed 1/2 cup of diced onion and 1/2 cup of diced green pepper, and added that to the mix. Topped the meatloaf with barbecue sauce and put it in a preheated oven (375) for 55 min. I didn’t use any milk as suggested in this recipe. I also used a regular baking dish, instead of a loaf pan, placing the meatloaf on two slices of bread. (To absorb the grease) It came out perfect. Will make again for sure. Loved it!

This recipe finally ended my search for the best meatloaf I've tasted. Instead of an onion I used Lipton Beefy Onion Soup mix. I used Italian flavored panko bread crumbs. I'll try plain panko bread crumbs next time. I'm not sure I liked the Italian flavor they added as much as I'd like the plain. This is an excellent meatloaf!

After reading nearly all the reviews, I decided to make this meatloaf as directed.  (It is very disturbing to read reviews about a recipe that was changed so very much it no longer resembles the original recipe in any way except the name.) It was very, very good as is.  Excellent texture and not too dense.  This is a true rating.

I have made it twice and we loved it.  It's tasty and moist.  My only problem is that it didn't slice very well.  It just crumbles.  To be fair, I did add more veggies, like chopped carrots and celery as well.  Perhaps that's what did it.  I let it rest too before I attempted to slice it.  I will work with this recipe until I get it to where I can slice the leftovers for sandwiches.

This was fantastic. I didn't change a thing. For my soft bread crumbs, I used whole wheat bread. My 97 year old father said it definitely was the best meatloaf he has ever had. My husband agreed! This is a keeper!

This was great. This was my first time making a meatloaf and I am very happy with how it turned out. I did not add the onion or the green pepper because I don't like those. I did however, add onion powder and garlic powder. I also added an extra egg to make sure it didn't fall apart. It was delicious and my picky eater husband loved it as well. It goes great with some potatoes cubed with butter in the dish with the meatloaf. I highly recommend it.

Absolutely the best ever. I've been searching and experimenting for years, and this recipe just brought all that to an end. The only thing I did differently was the topping. I glazed with ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar.

I puree the onions in the food processor with the milk, then add to the meat mixture. This "sneaks" in the onions for picky eaters.

Denelle, we loved it too. Those that thought it was too bland are missing the beauty of it. Bland means you have a fabulous basic recipe to which you can add your favorite seasonings. As is, it made my guy really happy. Next time, we'll probably kick it up a notch. Thanks! :o)

I'm in search of the perfect meatloaf recipe and this wasn't it for us.  My husband liked it, but I didn't care for the flavor that the green pepper added to the meatloaf.  I reduced the amount of green pepper by half and added a little garlic powder, but otherwise followed the recipe.  If I make this again, I'll definitely leave out the green pepper.  However, the meatloaf did hold together well and my husband is looking forward to meatloaf sandwiches!

The meatloaf was good and very easy. My only complaint is that it was VERY salty. 1 1/4 teaspoon of salt is way too much. Plus the steak sauce has salt in it. I would make this again but I would sprinkle a little salt or at most put 1/4 a teaspoon.

I loved this meatloaf! Some how this meatloaf is really separated from the other meatloaf recipes. Guessing it's the steak sauce rather than a tomato type topping. The texture was perfect. The flavor was great. I used A-1 for my steak sauce. It was too salty really for me and i'm a salt lover. Next time I will cut back on the salt and also cut back the amount of A-1 for the topping, was just a bit too much for my taste. A-1 is somewhat overpowering itself really. But this is a real keeper and is great for left overs also. Is one of those even better the second day recipes.

Best meatloaf I've ever had.  Used 85/15 ground beef, Heinz 57 (I think that is the key to the outstanding flavor), 18 saltine crackers rather than bread crumbs and then reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Minced the small onion and bell pepper.  Note that you will need to bake it for at least 1-1/4 hours to make sure the onion and bell pepper are completely soft. If it appears to be browning too much during that time, cover with foil.  This morning I can still smell the wonderful aroma from baking the meatloaf last night, and it is making me hungry.

Whoever thought up the idea to put steak sauce in meatloaf was a GENIUS! I have made this recipe twice so far, trying out a few things different to get it just how I want it--but I love the steak sauce flavor in the meat, and so does my roommate. This time, I cooked the veggies in a pan with butter for like 10 mins to soften them up before adding them to the meat. The resulting meatloaf is DEFINITELY the moistest and most flavorful I have ever had. And I loved the very sweet taste the onions had in this one. I am going to be playing with this recipe over and over. The basic recipe is awesome, tho. I just like EVEN MORE steak sauce ;) 
Thanks SO MUCH for sharing this recipe!

This was a very good meatloaf.  It came out moist, with excellent texture.  It sliced perfectly.  It had nice chewiness.  The steak sauce flavor was somewhat predominant, with the onion and bell pepper also coming through.  I used PF herb flavored stuffing mix in place of the soft bread crumbs, which worked well.  I also used L&P thick Worcestershire sauce as the steak sauce ingredient.  It added quite a bit of spicy sweetness, which many may find appealing.  For those who prefer less spciness, a brown sugar/ketchup mixture would work fine as well.  I would make this meatloaf again.

I love this! It was my first time to make meatloaf and it was easy and it turned out yummy!

I was tempted to adjust the seasoning (sauce, etc) but I figured I should try it as it is and I'm glad I did. I used 70% ground chicken and 30% ground beef because it was all I had. It was really great.

Oh and I didn't have steak sauce so I just used the Hunt's barbecue sauce that I had. Still turned out great. Next time I'll be more adventurous and use more of the barbecue sauce. Just coz I can. :)

Very easy and tasty.  A nice twist on traditional meatloaf.  I also used seasoned stuffing mix, as a few here suggested.  So much better than breadcrumbs!

This is indeed a moist meatloaf.  Cut it down for one pound of beef, as that is what I had, but used the whole egg and whole onion with no bell pepper.  Next time, will use something other than A-1 (what DH loves on his steak so we have in house), as the flavor was overpowering.  Thanks for sharing!  Update: did use a mix of Heinz 57 and A-1 - much better.  Also, used oatmeal in place of the bread crumbs and 2 eggs in place of one.  Awesome

Thanks for posting this recipe; its a keeper!  My husband loved it!  I used red pepper instead of green and Italian style bread crumbs, but I think it would be a winner either way.  I also used two eggs.

Disappeared fast at our house with several request to make it again within a week. I made a second loaf without the bell peppers  at the request of a daughter and don't recommend that change at all.

Tried this for dinner last night.  My hubby and my mother both loved it.  It truly is delicious.  However, in my mind, meatloaf HAS to have ketchup or tomato paste on the top.  This is definitely a do-again at our house, but next time I will be adding ketchup or tomato paste on top.

I like this recipe because it's more like the classic meatloaf, and it's simple.

very good; I followed a few others' advice and did 2 pounds hamburger and two eggs, to "stretch" the servings to 6 generous portions. One hour at 350, then 20 more minutes at 375.

This recipe really sounded good and I was hoping for the best but it didn't turn out quite as expected. I left out the onions (by accident) and the peppers (on purpose). It had a good flavor but fell apart and seemed a bit too bready. (I used homemade bread crumbs from stale bread that I dried in my dehydrator.) I'm thinking a little less bread crumbs and maybe an extra egg might have done the trick. I do like my meatloaf more solid and sliceable. 

On a positive note, It made great cold meatloaf sandwiches for lunch the next day. :)

This was just OK. I don't know if it's just me, but it seemed like a lot of onion! I only put 3/4 of an onion and it was still too much.

followed recipe exactly except for adding a few extra spices... chili powder, onion powder & fresh garlic... this was the best meatloaf i have ever made! It was so moist and juicy & my son who is not a big fan of meatloaf agreed & asked me to make it again soon! Thanks for a great recipe and I'll be sharing it among family and friends.

This recipe is simple, however, it completely lacks the traditional meatloaf flavor. No ketchup based sauce on top, no tomato in the meat, etc. Not bad, but it you are looking for a great recipe for traditional meatloaf, this is not it.

My family really enjoyed this meatloaf.  I didn't add the peppers as requested because my husband doesn't care for them, and I added a ketchup, brown sugar glaze.  Very tasty and deserves the five stars.

This is a very basic recipe.  I added 1 1/2 cups of cheddar cheese and Bourbon steak slather instead of A1.  I also omitted the bell pepper.  I added fresh garlic also.  Served with mashed potatoes and gravy.  Delish!

Delicious, moist meatloaf without the overpowering mustard that I find in some versions. Used a mix of 3/4 beef, and some leftover ground pork and turkey to make up the 1.5 lbs of meat. Used soft bread crumbs leftover from Thanksgiving stuffing--Martin's Potato Bread Soft Cubes. Should have made a double recipe, my husband and I polished off nearly 2/3 last night. Will add worchestershire next time for a little kick.

Great recipe! My fiance loves meatloaf, but I was hesitant to cook it (always seemed like so much work). I made this recipe and omitted the peppers (accidentally) and used worchester sauce instead of the A1 and it turned out fabulous! He raved about it to my family and asked me to make more next week :) *super happy future wife*

a little too much steak sauce taste for me, so I would decrease that next time.  But otherwise it was great.  Also, I used red bell peppers instead of green, and I really liked the look and taste of those.

I used venison to make this version tonight as the guys were bored with the same old same old.  I did not have a green pepper so I used a red bell, i also started to run out of steak sauce and added worcestershire sauce ( maybe 1T).  The guys really liked it, thought it was a nice change.  They do want garlic added next time.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I've never been a big fan of meatloaf and have never made it until today. This recipe is fabulous! The meat was moist and full or flavor. I used Progresso bread crumbs (garlic & herb) and for the steak sauce I used "Chaka's" MMM Sauce. I also only used half of a small yellow onion and a little less than what it calls for the green pepper. I added some shredded carrot as well. I glazed some extra sauce all over the top of the loaf and it came out nice a crispy, but not crunchy, while the inside was soft and moist. This recipe was perfect and will be sharing it with friends and family! Thank you!

Well, I recalculated for 8 servings, so I used 2# ground beef.  I used worchestershire sauce because that is what I had at the time.  It's a good recipe, but I would definitely cut way back on the salt!  And as much as I love green peppers, I would probably leave them out the next time I make this & I'll try it with a different steak sauce.  I will certainly try this recipe again with a couple of changes made.

This was by far the best, traditional meatloaf we've had.  I used 2 lbs of 80% lean ground beef, two eggs, 3/4 cup milk and 2 cups of fresh french bread crumbs. I suggest a small to medium yellow onion; chopped fine, also the green pepper.  I added a 1/2 tsp of ground marjoram and 1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper; it was perfectly cooked and so flavorful, moist and delicate.  The base recipe is so simple and easily expanded or added to.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you Denelle

This meatloaf recipe is terrific; really the best I have come by.  My husband and 4-year old daughter (picky eater) both exclaimed how good it was and asked that I please make it again, which I most certainly will.

The name says it all... This truly IS the Best Meatloaf I have eaten. My husband has raved about it for 3 days and cant wait for me to make it again. He doesnt even really care for meatloaf!! The kids enjoyed it also. I too used the breadcrumbs and it came out perfect. Flavorful and moist...Sorry Mom, this one even tops yours (Shhhh...Dont tell)

I used this recipe to make my first ever meatloaf. It was a total success.  I didn't have steak sauce exactly, so I used some barbecue sauce with some Worcestershire sauce.  My pan was a dual layer pan with small holes in the top pan to drain some of the fat from the meat. Awesome. I wonder what ground up tortilla chips would be in the mix instead of breadcrumbs???

Wonderful meatloaf! I used Heinz 57 sauce, 2 T dried minced onion, and frozen chopped green pepper. I wasn't paying attention and used all the sauce in the meatloaf, so I added extra on top the last 10 min of baking. My husband even liked this, green peppers and all, and is soooo glad I didn't use A1 sauce to make this. (which I almost did since it is my favorite) I will use this recipe a lot we enjoyed it so much. The next time I am going to add 1 T of brown sugar too. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

It was easy and really yummy!  Instead of chopping onions and bell peppers, I put them in the blender, with a bit of the milk.  And "Steak sauce" was a bit misleading though, it should say ketchup.  It went great over turkey gravy.

Tasty and juicy, but I would recommend sauteing the peppers and onions before adding them to the meatloaf - they were a bit too crunchy for my taste.

This was moist, but too sweet.  I think I'll use something other than Heinz 57 next time, maybe A1.  I'm also going to add some mushrooms.  This was just average...definitely not "the best."

So easy to make and tastes good.  I didn't give it five stars because I like my meatloaf with a little more tomato sauce.  I forgot the milk but it still turned out moist.

This was my first meatloaf attempt, and it was good. I modified the recipe by adding 1 egg and used 2 1/4 lb. beef, omitting the salt but adding Adobo (seasoned salt/garlic powder blend), subbed soft bread crumbs for italian bread crumb mix, mixed steak sauce and ketchup together, added parsley, chopped garlic, oregano and 1 tsp. worchestshire sauce. I put two pieces of bread on the bottom to soak up some of the grease, which worked nicely. Next time I will use ground sirloin as some others had suggested, and use more ketchup in the meat. I will also work more seasonings into the meat before adding anything else. It was good but the meat needed a little more flavor.

My husband hates ketschup on his meatloaf, and as a result I usually shy away from making it. THIS WAS PERFECT!! Followed recipe, but added fresh parsley, sauteed onions and green bell pepper, added a little more steak sauce on top (personal preference) looked great and tasted even better.

This recipe will be a staple in my house from now on. It was super easy - but I mixed ketchup with the remaining steak sauce for the top. It was great! The hubby liked it enough for seconds.

This was good.  My family ate the whole thing!  The 13 year old and 10 year old who are soooo picky gobbled it up.  I did not put the green peppers in and replaced the fresh onion with deydrated onions from the spice aisle.  They give the flavor of onion and the kids never see them so no picking them out.  Give this recipe a try!

This is a good old fashion meatloaf recipe that makes for some good comfort food.  I didn't have steak sauce on hand so I use a little soy sauce instead and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.... My wife thought it was very good also..

I run a kitchen with clients who have mild intellectual disabilities and we are always cooking for more than 40 people. I've never made meatloaf before but to my surprise it was amazing- and all my students loved it! I quickly became queen of the kitchen.

this was the best meatloaf i've ever made, and every time i make it, there are NEVER any leftovers.  the only thing i changed was that i put all the steak sauce into the meatloaf and topped it with ketchup (childhood thing, i guess).  FABULOUS.

This meatloaf is fantastic!  This was my first try at making a meatloaf and it was absolutely perfect!  Moist and flavorful, like a meatloaf should be.  I used saltine cracker crumbs instead of bread.

Excellent flavor and very moist. I did omit the green peppers because some do not care for them. Also, I increased the ingredients because I was using 3lbs. of meat.

My husband and I love this recipe.  We like the texture.  It is moist and stays together.  I have made numerous changes, depending upon what leftovers I have.  The things that I don't change are the amount of oatmeal, the liquid and the one egg.  Sometimes I will grate in a carrot.  Sometimes it is leftover cooked veggies like spinach, corn, tomatoes, eggplant, whatever.  And we boost up the spices.  But for the most part, it is the same basic, best meatloaf recipe.

This was a very good meatloaf.  I have been on the hunt for a good one for a very long time and I think this may be it.  It seemed a little salty so may cut that down.  I used crackers instead of bread so that's probably why.  Husband loved it!  Will definitely do again.

this was ok...my hubby liked my other recipe (guy approved meat loaf is the name) better.  i think this tasted bland...all you could taste was A-1 steak sauce.  oh well, thats just our opinion.  but if you don't care for this...you really should try our favorite (listed above).  thanks for the try!

This is a wonderful, simple basic meatloaf!!  I've been married 32 years and have never been able to make a good meatloaf.  My husband loved this!  I did use the crushed crackers, as one person suggested, and I added garlic. (Nothing should be without garlic). Definitely a keeper.  THANKS!!!

I had to make an account, just to thank whoever posted this amazing recipe! I never had meatloaf growing up, but I loved the show 'Roseanne'. I always remember her using corn flakes cereal for her meatloaf, so when I was at the store and saw Kellog's now offers Corn Flakes crumbs, I sought the perfect recipe. Thus brought me here, so needless to say I had to use these crumbs, to make ol' Rosey proud. 
THIS WAS SO FREAKING DELICIOUS!! I love to read all the comments, so I could pick up cool ideas. Which I did, I sautéed the sweet* onion and bell pepper, whilst adding the 1/2 tsp of chopped parsley. Also didn't realize you could use Heinz 57, OR A1 - I got both, lol. So I used the Heinz 57 while mixing the loaf, and used the A1 as the delicious topper; perfecto!! Definitely will be making again and again.

Absolutely delicicious! I followed the recipe as is (used A-1 Steak sauce and plain bread crumbs). I was tempted to add more salt after it was well mixed and more steak sauce on top before putting it in the oven but I didn't. Boy am I glad I didn't it was perfect in taste! DO NOT ADD more salt!  I will definitely be making this meatloaf more often!

It is actually the best homemade meatloaf I have made so far. The only thing I changed was that I added more seasonings to my preference. It's definitely a hit!

This was my first try at a meatloaf and it was absolutely delicious. I did however add a bit of my own flair. I sautéed the onions and peppers in a garlic and herb butter before adding it into the mixture. The result was glorious. My husband and discerning 2 year old loved it. I'll definitely use this as my go-to base recipe for meatloaf.

This was really good i substituted a little of the heinz 57 with ketchup. Also, I added a packet of lipton onion mix but I do that with every meatloaf and even hamburgers because I like the onion taste. Anyway, came out fantastic. I've tried other recipes from this site and this is my favorite so far. Made for 3 men (dad, husband and brother) and there's hardly any left. Goes well with garlic mashed potatoes . Thanks!

I made this twice, first time didn't change a thing. Second time, I used a table spoon of Worcestershire sauce, 2 eggs, canister breadcrumbs and half the milk. I mixed the breadcrumbs with the wet stuff and let it sit 12 min. dumped the wet bread crumbs over the meat, mixed and put it in the pan. after an hour i just turned the heat off and let it cool in the oven. YUMMMMMMMM!!!

I have made this several times just the way it's listed and it's delicious. I had never made meatloaf in my life and this turned out amazing. I got the best compliments on it and how juicy and tasty it was by using steak sauce. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. It's now a once a week dinner in our house!!!!

This was great!  I am one of the most picky eaters that you'll ever meet.  I added A1 Thick N' Hearty to this recipe for the steak sauce and loved it.  It was so moist and I liked the addition of the peppers and onions.  I think that I might try making this recipe into hamburgers to see how that goes.

This was the best meatloaf I've ever made, and the man thought it rated amongst my best meals. I made it as written except used red peppers instead of green, served with an onion gravy, mashed red potatoes and corn.

We loved it, I left out the bell pepper, and used chili sauce instead of the steak sauce. My topping is 1/4 cup tomato sauce 1/4 cup heinz catsup, a tbls of worchestershire sauce and 2-3 drops of tabasco.  I separate this into two small loaves, brush them with the sauce,  and when they are almost done, I pour the rest of the sauce on and bake for another 15 min. My husband loves this sauce. he is not interested in trying the steak sauce on top.

Loved it, even better the next day as a sandwich. I will make this again for sure!! I also left out the green pepper and since my family likes the heat, I added a dash of Cayenne pepper.

Truly wonderful.  A good base recipe. As earlier reviews suggested I used garlic and herb flavored croutons for added flavor and I added 1 celery rib, 2 garlic cloves and the leaves from a bunch of parsley.  I chopped up the croutons and the veggies very fine in a food processor and then soaked the croutons in milk.  Just for my taste I used 1 lb of ground turkey and 1 lb of ground beef and increased the proportions of the other ingredients to compensate.  I have never before used steak sauce but it was a wonderful idea!

I used low-sodium stove top instead of bread crumbs and replaced steak sauce  with a sriracha teriyaki sauce and added garlic... awesome! Best meatloaf I've ever made!

This is titled "The Best Meatloaf" and it truly is.  I made it with the butter crackers "toll house" and made a ketchup 12 cup and brown sugar 4 tablespoons unpacked for the top.  the rest was done as recipe call for . The Family tells me it was excellent for dinner , but was also an excellent leftover dish " meatloaf sandwiches and chips , the next day......

This was the BEST meatloaf I have ever had. I didn't have Heinz 57 so I made my own with this easy recipe: 1/4 c ketchup (Heinz), 2 tsp yellow mustard (French’s), 4 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 2 tsp vinegar (cider or Heinz malt vinegar), 1/4 tsp Tabasco sauce, 1/4 tsp salt. Mix together.
I had leftover dried bread crumbs and used that instead of fresh bread crumbs. I dumped all the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid Mixer and mixed it all at once. So easy and so good.

My husband hates meatloaf, but he likes this one.  So do my kids.  It comes out very moist and flavorful.  The couple of things I change is the amount of steak sauce.  I use 3 tbs, and since I don't like crunchy onions in my meatloaf I just brown some onion before putting into the mixture. Brush some BBQ sauce on top before baking and it comes out really good! Very good recipe.  The best I  have tried so far.

I have been searching for years for a good meatloaf recipe, and my search has come to an end!  This meatloaf is very easy to make and tastes great.  I omitted the green pepper (because I didn't have any) and I added some garlic powder.

Great meatloaf; I saute the onions and green pepper first and use a little more steak sauce than the recipe calls for.

Meatloaf was a bit sweeter than I liked but hubby loved it. Topped off with brown gravy. This meatloaf was very moist with a good flavor. Next time I will cut back on the steak sauce.

I was leery when I saw the steak sauce as an ingredient as my husband doesn't like sauces or catsup, but I thought it might be disguised enough in this recipe.  I'm SO glad I tried this.  I ended up using 2 lbs. ground beef and kept the sauce amount approximately the same mixed with a TINY amount of catsup (1 Tbsp.).  Gave a light flavor that was unidentifiable (good thing at my house) and was  exceptionally tasty. I did not brush any sauce on top so it would not be prevalent.  He loved it.  I had to use a combination of Ritz crackers and bread crumbs because of what I had on hand and I cooked it in an 8x8 glass dish.  For these reasons it required a longer cooking time. I will definitely make this again.

My husband is the absolute pickiest person I've ever known, so for him to like meatloaf is quite the miracle! He didn't like the kind he had growing up, so he wasn't too happy when I told him we were having meatloaf for dinner. He was shocked when he tried and it actually liked it! Since then, he's requested it often, always tells others that my meatloaf is his favorite (kudos to the creator of this recipe!), and even eats the leftovers!! (That's huge in this household!) This is an awesome recipe!! The steak sauce, instead of the usual ketchup, is what really won my husband over. Try it! I'm quite certain you will love it as much as we do! **I've always used only a lb of hamburger meat and just adjusted the other ingredients. So, if that's all you have, don't worry! It'll still be great!

I was excited to try a new meatloaf recipe. I love meatloaf in some restaurants, and I was hoping this would be a great recipe because of the high rating. It was easy to prepare, but none of my family thought it was anything special. We all missed a more tomato based flavor. Growing up in the Midwest most meatloaf recipes have some tomato paste. I will continue my search for a great meatloaf recipe!

This was fantastic!!! I sauteed the green pepper, onion, and added 2 cloves of minced garlic in olive olive or butter, until tender, then added the beef. Also, instead of putting the rest of the steak sauce on the top I mixed BBQ sauce, mustard and brown sugar together and poured it over the top!

This meatloaf definitely lives up to it's name, because it really is "The Best Meat Loaf". I've tried other recipes and have always had to tweak them and add or leave out some of the ingredients, but with this one, I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I added was garlic. It's just my personal preference, plus growing up in the south, eating Cajun/Creole/Italian food, I just believe that everything is better with some gahlic y'all :) I used the Heinz 57 sauce because I love its unique zesty taste, and also added a little extra sauce on the side for myself. I didn't have a loaf pan, so I just shaped it into a loaf and used a glass 13" x 9" pan, and it came out great. So, if you want a different, great tasting meatloaf, this one is it!

Easy to make and my family just raved over it!  I added a little extra Heinz 57 and I halved the amount of the soft bread crumbs, substituting dried ones for the remaining half.  Great recipe!

A very simple recipe.  I used Panko bread crumbs and added dried herbs that complement red meat such as rosemary, garlic, chives and sea salt.  I used A1 steak sauce in the mix, but topped off the meatloaf with a tangy barbeque sauce.  Try this recipe with Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe, from allrecipes.com.  I roasted the garlic in the oven while the meatloaf was cooking.

Great recipe. Super easy and I have nailed it several times. The one problem is it takes an hour to cook. However the meatloaf is light and fluffy and incredibly savory.

Probably the best meatloaf and the most moist of all.  My husband loves meatloaf and after trying many with many ingredients this one had the least ingredients and tasted the best.  Finally!

GREAT recipe. The only thing I do different is top with ketchup and bake because the steak sauce would overwhelm my sensitive palate if it was in top too. A staple in my recipe box. I make it once a month.

I made this last night. My family usually hates meatloaf. They loved this--no leftovers. I used crackers instead of breadcrumbs, but along with adding the salt, I thought it was a little too salty. Next time I may try following the recipe as written! The steak sauce gave it just the right kick!

Pretty good! I like the texture a lot. It held together well and I did not find the raw onions & green peppers overwhelming, as some reviewers have. I think I will experiment a bit with toppings, I used the Heinz 57 and it seemed a little bland. I'm sure that is just a matter of taste, I am more accustomed to the ketchup/brown sugar style toppings with meatloaf. Thanks for sharing your recipe Denelle!

This meatloaf was easy to prepare, the taste was very nice. I am not a big meatloaf fan, but the rest of the family loves it, so I decided to try this recipe. You won't be disappointed!

But! Added garlic powder, chopped bacon, some cayenne pepper for the mix and added bbq sauce to the glaze on top ... just need to remember I need to add minced onion for it to stay put!

Very good recipe in terms of moistness and density. I however added onion soup mix to mixture for more flavor and chopped some jalapeno peppers to give an extra kick to the recipe. The peppers in meatloaf also complimented the sweet baby rays honey chipotle sauce I used as topping. Will definitely make again.

My family does not generally like meatloaf, but when the mother-in-law said, "Let's have meatloaf for dinner!!!" I had to find a decent recipe because, well, hers was always dry and not very good... This recipe was AWESOME and my husband actually said, "Let's have it again." :)

My opinion is ....Too much salt...needs more than a dash of pepper.  This was alright, but still looking for the ultimate meatloaf.

Made this the other night, turned out great!  I did not add the bell pepper (personal preference), & used half & half instead of milk.  I also placed it on a rack & shaped it, this way it would not sit in the grease, & I covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes & uncovered for the remaining 30 minutes.

Very quick and easy to make.  I had to cook it a little longer than recipe called for but that could just be an oven problem. Served with potatoes and thought it was great leftover.

This was very simple recipe and it tasted delicious.  I used a red pepper instead of green that worked out perfectly.  I had never made meatloaf before, my son loved it and wants to have it again.  Always a success in my book.

Excellent! very close to my great grandma's meatloaf recipe. Her recipe had a glaze though, roughly 3/4 cup ketchup mixed with 2 tablespoons of brown sugar ( made it so many times I no longer measure...) The mixture is poured on top in the last 15 minutes of cooking. Tastes just as good on this recipe!

This is one of my new faves. My hubby, toddler, and I all love it. The only change I've made is not adding the green peppers, only because I didn't have them on hand. It's still great and I'll keep making it!

The Best Meatloaf Haiku: "Great, basic meatloaf. (I forgot steak sauce on top.) But we loved it still!" The only change that I made, due to what I had available, was using crushed Ritz crackers instead of soft bread crumbs; not sure if that's what resulted in my meatloaf not slicing really pretty, but appearances aside, the taste was spot-on. I completely spaced on brushing additional steak sauce on the top, but we were still really happy w/ how it turned out.

This was excellent.  I've always been able to make meatloaf but this one had the taste and texture I've been looking for.  While I certainly don't mind, unless its a really small onion, a whole one for this amount of ground beef may be a bit much if you have eaters who have an aversion to onion in their food.  I even took my time to meticulously dice it into the smallest pieces and the kids still made comment.

My husband loved it!  I cut out the green pepper since we both don't like it.  I also substituted onion power for the onion since he doesn't like chunks of onion, but I wanted to keep the onion flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

The first time I made it the onion and pepper were still crunchy. The 2nd time I made it I sauteed the onion and pepper first and then added it to the meat. I liked it much better the 2nd time. I used A-1 Bold and Spicy steak sauce since that is what I had. Great base recipe that you can change up with different flavors of steak sauce.

DELICIOUS!  But I made a wonderful mistake, it calls to put 3 Tablespoons of steak sauce in the meat loaf and the rest on top, I put all 1/3 cups of A1 sauce in the whole meat loaf and it was soooo tastey!!  I did put a hot and spicy bbq sauce on top as well (as per previous comments suggested).  I made it with both turkey and beef and both were great.  great for left overs.

I have always had a tough time making a moist and flavorful meatloaf...but this one takes the cake!!!  Absolutely woderful!  I doubled the recipe, making one for my husband and me, and the other for my father in law.  We are watching our sodium intake so instead of salt I substituted 2 tsp of Nosalt.  And instead of steak sauce, I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ.  My husband ate some of it fresh out of the oven while I took his dad's to him.  When I got back home, he said it is the best meatloaf he has eaten in a long time...and this man loves his meatloaf.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I am new to this site but it is now my favorite site online.  Thank you Allrecipes!!!

I agree, this is the best meatloaf! Even better the next day, thinly sliced on white bread as a cold meatloaf sandwich! Yummy!

I tried this recipe the other day and the family just loved it!!  It was moist and not bland like most meatloaf recipes out there.  I did omit the green bell pepper and in it's place I used 2 cloves of garlic grated.  I WILL be making this again and again and again!! Thanks so much!!

I tried meatloaf for the first time at a local restaurant and liked it so I wanted to make it myself.  This meatloaf was even better! It was so juicy and delicious!  I used very lean ground beef and followed the directions and ingredients exactly.  At first I thought that one whole onion was going to be too much but it was the best part!  One thing I did a bit differently was the end.  It says to brush the remaining Heinz 57 sauce on top of the meatloaf but instead I brushed it all around the entire meatloaf so it came out with a crispy outside and tender inside.  My husband loved it!  To go with it, my husband made the Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Four Cheese Macaroni from this site as well.

Super recipe, thanks!  I added a few spices to it and then I baked it in two individual casserole dishes hoping it wouldn't take as long to cook, but it still needed the full hour to reach 160 degrees.

I didn't have any steak sauce, so I used barbecue sauce. I didn't read the directions before I made it and added 2/3 cup to the mixture (I doubled the recipe). I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I got my grater and shredded some garlic bread.It's a very moist meatloaf, and my family loved it. My 4 year old, who does not eat red meat, had an entire slice of it. Yummy. We had mashed potatoes, peas, corn, and dinner rolls (Angie's Perfect Dinner Rolls from this website). Perfect meal for a Sunday. Thanks for the great recipe.

Added 2 cups crushed rits crackers. 4 tblsp of A1 bold and spicy,added red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick,and baked for an hour and 15 min.At the end put a mixture of ketchup and brown sugar on top,turned the oven to broil and let the sauce carmelize.ohhh my gosh this meat loaf was soooo good and very moist! Hubby LOVED it,he even brought a slice for his friend to work to try!!.haha.Thanks!!! :)

Instead of beef, I used 3 ground meat combination of veal, pork and beef- mostly available in some supermarket like Morton Williams ( previously Turco's). I added some worcestershire sauce with the A-1 steak sauce. Need to cut back on salt otherwise my picky , "eweee what's that " boys loved it! Very good indeed! Make some baby red potatoes seasoned with a little rosemary, salt & pepper and coat with olive oil , stick it in the oven with meatloaf plus some roasted sliced zuchini- a complete balance meal. I also put apple sauce on the side. What a combination!!!!

This was REALLY good. I used panko bread crumbs (japanese). I did not have steak sauce or eggs, so I used worchestire sauce and some liquid smoke..I also used smokehouse black pepper instead... VERY good!

I loved this recipe! It's just a good ol' basic meatloaf.  I've tried the one with french onions, onion soup mix, ranch mix, and a few others, but this is so far my favorite!  I even made a mistake and added all of the steak sauce to the meatloaf (a Heintz 57 no-name brand).  It came out great!  I left out the green pepper only b/c I didn't have one. And I adjusted the recipe for 2 lbs. of hamburger and cooked 1.5 hours (probably should have cooked for a little less time, but it's hard to tell w/meatloaf).   I made a separate glaze for the topping.  I didn't want any  more of the steak sauce flavor since I added it all to the meat so I made the glaze from 'Melt-in-Your-Mouth Meat Loaf'.  Delicious!!

I totally expected to love this recipe, so imagine my surprise when I totally didn't.  This meatloaf had a sharp taste from the steak sauce, and was a little on the salty side.  The texture was good, but that's more of a technique issue than ingredient-driven.  It was fine if smothered in ketchup, but that practice is usually reserved for food that is substandard, at best. It gets a high rating, which shows me that meatloaf is still a much misunderstood food item.  My own recipe is quite wonderful, actually -- moist and tender, full of the flavor of the meat, with smoky/sweet undertones.  Perhaps I'll share it . . . someday!

I found this to be extremely bland.  I modified the recipe for 1 pound of beef and although it was extremely moist it had no flavour.  I typically add a lot of ketchup and worcestershire sauce along with garlic and onion making a very flavourful meatloaf.  There was no where near enough steak sauce in this to give it flavour.  Because I modified it for 1 pound, the recipe only called for 3 tbsps of steak sauce.  I should have kept it at 1/3 cup and added garlic. That said it was extremely moist which is why I gave it 3 stars.  I will make this again using a lot more steak sauce and some garlic.

I made this meatloaf without the green peppers but everything else the same. I thought it was very good and had wonderful flavor. The family was split, some liked this better and some of them liked my meatloaf better. Like I said I thought it was very good, thank you.

This meatloaf was delicious!  I don't really like ketchup, so the steak sauce (we used A1) was a tasty alternative.  We didn't have onions or peppers on hand, and used pre-seasoned stuffing breadcrumbs without softening them.  Very juicy, tasty, and not a crumb was left!

Even though I forgot to add the egg to the mix. This meatloaf turned out great. I added fresh pressed garlic. Also the BBQ sauce I used was "Bullseye - Guinnes" infused sauce.   My wife has requested this to be done again. So that is the true testament of the reciepe itself.

My husband loved this one.  I followed it pretty precisely with the exception of using crushed saltines in place of the bread crumbs, and used ground sirloin (hey, it was on sale) and baked it in a meatloaf pan with a drain feature built in to keep the grease down.  Very good!

I love this meatloaf and my family did too.  I have used the same recipe for years but didn't have the ingredients on hand so I got on this site to find one with the ingredients that I did have and found this one.  I don't think I'll be going back to my old recipe since this one was such a big hit.  I added what I had in the veggie drawer...mushrooms, shredded carrotts, green pepper and onion.  I used 3 lbs. of meat, I used store brand steak sauce in the meatloaf and on top I mixed steak sauce with ketchup.  I also added thyme for a bit more flavor.  This has great flavor and is super moist and just yummy.

This was okay to me but my DH who doesn't like meatloaf loved this one. He even had it for breakfast the next day. Kids were half & half on it also. Would make again if DH requests it, but didn't like it enough personally to add it to my collection.

I enjoyed this...plain bread crumbs are pretty bland though, next time I'll take another reviewer's advice and used crushed ritz crackers. But with the addition of ketchup, it was quite tasty. I made it along with mashed potatos and peas.

This was a big hit - I used A1 steak sauce.  I personally think I would like a little less sauce in it, but my husband gobbled it up so maybe I'll leave it how it is. Thanks!

Very moist meatloaf but held together well. I added A1 steaksauce to the meatloaf and topped with a mixture of ketchup and brown sugar as past other reviewers suggested. Leftovers were better.

This meatloaf was excellent.  Not dry at all.  I made a few changes as some of the others did.  We do not care for green peppers, so I used a can of Rotel Tomatoes instead.  Also added 2 cloves of garlic, mushrooms, and extra steak sauce on top.  I will certainly make this again!

This is the second time that I have attempted to cook meatloaf and it turned out great! I didn't want to put crushed bread crumbs into the mixture so I toasted a slice of bread and chopped it up into pieces.  I also ran out of steak sauce while making the recipe so I used barbecue sauce for the remainder of what the recipe asked for.  I will definitely be cooking meatloaf again!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I omitted the green peppers (I don't like them) and the onions (my fiancee doesn't like them). The steak sauce added a nice zip, but most of it cooked out which I was a little disappointed about, but all in all, I thought it was very tasty.

I did not care much for this meatloaf. I followed the recipe exactly, but wasn't pleased with how it tasted. I have an old family recipe that I usually use and wanted to try a different version. I will definitely be going back to my old standby. I'm not saying it was awful, just not what I was hoping for.

Pretty good recipe.....I made it with a mix of ground pork and venison, and it turned out very good.  Gave some to my dad, he really liked it alot.  I put alot more sauce on top because I like my meatloaf with lots of sauce.  Overall, pretty darn good.  :)

This was a really good meatloaf.  I sauted my onions and a red bell pepper before adding them. I also added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  When there was 20 minutes left to cook, I put a few tablespoons of Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce on the top.  This added  a really nice taste, without overpowering the taste of the meatloaf.  My husband and very picky teenager liked this as much as I did!

Really good, moist yet firm enough to make great sandwiches!  I didn't know what soft bread crumbs were, so I chopped up tasty bread.  I also let it rest before slicing.  One of the best meatloafs we have enjoyed!

I liked this meat loaf. I did make a small change, I used the 3 tablespoons of the steak sauce in the mixture but i used ketchup for the top. It was so yummy that the kids were fighting over the last slice.

Great recipe! Though my husband was not at first thrilled at the prospect of having a meatloaf dinner, he came around right quick! We'll be making this dish again for sure! I prepared the recipe as is with one substitution - instead of steak sauce, I used a Hickory BBQ sauce instead. Super yummy!

I can cook just about anything perfectly but I have always sucked at making meatloaf. I tried this recipe as a last attempt & let me tell you, it turned out perfect & everyone in my family loved it!!! It is so good that we actually have "meatloaf night" every Wednesday now. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!

My entire family (including my very picky 7 year old) loved this meal! I've made it about 4 times and followed suggestions made by others about using the onion soup mix, and it was great... Oh, I also omitted the green peppers. Other than that, definitely a hit! :-)

Yum, yum.  This was so good that I skipped the potatoe and vegie and had another piece of meatloaf.  The only change I made was using Townhouse crackers.  I had to drain the meatloaf twice during cooking and then again at  the end, so next time I'm going to bake it Alton Brown's way by forming it in a greased pan and then turning  it upside down and placing it in a baking pan.

Great recipe! I used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 ground beef or just all turkey, depending on what I had on hand. Regardless, it turned out moist and very yummy. Family loved it! I used barbecue sauce, like Sweet Baby Ray's in it and on top because we didn't have the other, but it turned out great. Didn't use green bell pepper, but have done a boiled egg in the middle as a surprise. It was fun. I tried it with 1/2 stuffing and 1/2 bread cubed, but reduced the salt. I used onion soup mix, and omitted the salt. I've used vanilla soy milk once, and I couldn't really taste it because of the other salt. I've played with it a lot, and it hasn't failed. Try making a few and freezing it!

Sorry, I'm not jumping up and down about this like everyone else.  It was very moist.  However, my kids didn't like it (they usually like my meatloaf) and my husband and I thought it lacked flavor.  I'll probably follow the recipe again but use a spicy BBQ sauce instead (Sweet Baby Ray's).

This was just what I was looking for - a good basic meatloaf recipe!  The only steak sauce that I had was A1 and I felt that would be too strong.  So, I used Worcestershire sauce in the recipe and brushed a little A1 on top.  I also omitted the green pepper.  Very good thanks!

It was ok.  Nothing special.  The A1 wasn't overpowering like I saw in some reviews.  Took forever to cook and fell apart very easy.

My husband is a chef and even he was impress that my meatloaf turned out better then his.  I added 1lb of ground pork- to keep it moist,an extra egg, use worshershire instead of heinz, crushed few cloves of garlic, and substitute with orange bell pepper instead of green.

This recipe is great! I am not a big meatloaf fan because every time I've had it, it tastes like the hamburger that's in it. There's never any flavor. But this recipe is great. I will try different things like adding some spices but it's great just the way it is. Thanks for another great recipe!

My sister and I really liked this meatloaf.  The only thing I did differently was to add tomato sauce over the top of the meatloaf five minutes prior to taking it out of the oven.  It was definitely "yummy for the tummy."

This is a great recipe.  The prep was very simple and it smelled so good in the oven.  I left out the green peppers on account of my picky 2 year old's suspicion of anything green and it still came out lovely.  The whole family enjoyed it.  It's very filling and we only ate about half the loaf, so I froze the rest for later.  That makes it an affordable choice as well, since the ingredients are relatively inexpensive and it makes a lot of food.  I'll definitely make it again.

Great recipe.  I didn't have any sliced bread so I used 3/4 c purchased breadcrumbs and it turned out fine.  Moist but not crumbly.  Be sure to use a good quality steak sauce because the taste comes through!

I'm a vegetarian and even I was impressed (by the aroma) of this meatloaf. I used a kilo of mince, barbeque sauce, red capsicum and some garlic as well and it was a complete hit! So moist, yet stayed together beautifullly. I used silicon cookware and it seemed to generate a lot of juice - I drained it mostly off at about 7/8 cooked mark and made gravy with it. I'd definitely recommend this recipe to anyone looking for something nice, easy  and uncomplicated. It would be simple to add any number of different seasonings to change the style of the meatloaf.

This meatloaf is really good.  I omitted the green peppers because my kids don't like "chunks" and instead of the steak sauce I added 3 tbs of worchestershire sauce!  Yummy!

OMG! This was a terrific meatloaf. I used A1 sauce as the steak sauce and my tastebuds came alive. The leftover meatloaf made great sandwickes. Thanks so much for this recipe. I work at a country club and would love the chef to make this as a special for lunch

I made this a while ago, it was the first thing I made after I got married and wanted to surprise my husband with dinner, and figured what could be more perfect than meatloaf?  Sadly, it turns out that he doesn't like meatloaf (the things you learn, right?), but I thought that it was quite tasty, and both my parents and parents-in-law, ate up all of the leftovers and they all thought it was great!  Anyway, the point is that it is easy enough for a VERY novice cook to make, everyone who LIKED meatloaf quite enjoyed it, and it is good the next day as leftovers ESPECIALLY in meatloaf sandwiches.

First let me say that I absolutely hate meatloaf but I loved this one.  Unfortunately, my husband hated it because he said it has too many onions and green peppers sticking out in it.  I gave the leftovers to my mom and stepdad, and they absolutely loved it.  My mom wanted the recipe, as did my step sister, who also tried it.  I wish my husband would let me make this again.  In my opinion, it is 5 stars, but I had to give it 4 because he didn't like it due to the onions.  By the way, I made this with Heinz 57 and found it perfectly spiced.

Very Moist and great consistency.  I would use less onion and pepper if I made this again in the future. Ultimately, hubby liked mine better, so we will stick to that for the time.

Not that I thought this was the best meatloaf I've ever had, but it was very good. The steak sauce gave it a nice flavor. I didn't use any of the salt, and added my own seasonings which I felt it needed. Thank you!

The meatloaf was moist and delicious.  The cooking time was definitely spot on too.  An hour was perfect.  Also, I didn't have enough bbq sauce to spread much over top, and it was still delicious.

This was my first time making meatloaf.  My husband really enjoyed it.  And has requested for it in the future again.  I didn't have steak sauce, so used worchester sauce instead.  I would recommend spicing it up a little with some garlic.

Very good meatloaf recipe.  No leftovers!  I wasn't paying attention and left out the milk but it still turned out great.  I used Heinz 57 and don't think it overpowered the meat at all.  Will make again!

I don't make meatloaf often, but after finding this recipe - I plan to make it a lot!  I loved it.  It was moist and flavourful, and best of all, it doesn't have ketchup in it (which I hate:)  Although, if you don't like steak sauce, this recipe might not be for you.

I was looking for a meatloaf recipe that didn't use ketchup b/c I was out and found this recipe. So I made this last night and it was very tasty. I didn't have as much steak sauce as I thought so I didn't have any for the topping. I used frozen chopped green peppers and onions. I also added a little worchestershire sauce and used roasted garlic bread crumbs. This was a cheap, easy meatloaf I would definately make again.

Great recipe so simple, even I made it!
Moist and full of flavor! 
High blood pressure runs in my family, so I used less salt.

A good meatloaf recipe. My boyfriend is big on meatloaf and he liked it better than other recipes I've tried. I substituted the bread crumbs for crushed crackers and also put about 1/2 cup of shredded cheese in the center of the loaf.

Delicious!!! I think my husband was not too thrilled with having meatloaf for supper, but when he tasted this new recipe he was thrilled. It was a delicious meatloaf. This is my recipe from now on! Oh...and I did use the crushed butter crackers as a reviewer suggested. And I'm one of those people who have to have the catsup/brown sugar topping on my meatloaf so I used that instead of the steak sauce.

Though I am sure the original recipe is delicious, I found substitutions I made because some ingredients were missing made the most amazing meatloaf.  I had 3# of burger to make before it's best by date so I doubled the recipe. I was out of onion but had shallots so substituted 2 large shallots instead of 2 onions. I was out of milk but had sour cream so I subbed that for the milk & un-toasted sourdough  bread for the soft breadcrumbs.  Finally I didn't have steak sauce but did have a can of HUNTS seasoned sauce for meatloaf in it's place. everything else was followed and This is the  best meatloaf I have ever had! Thank for sharing!!

I have made many meatloaf recipes over the years, as have several family members in my family.  However this is by far the best meatloaf we have ever had, hands down!  I made this exactly as the recipe states and I would not change a thing!  Thanks for supplying our future favorite meatloaf!

Great recipe.  I  made it with 1 lb each of hamburger and Italian sausage, Italian bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs, exchange milk for prepared spaghetti sauce, and added beef bouillon paste to the egg.  Tasted like a meatball in a loaf.  The kids loved it.

This is a slam-dunk winner for meatloaf.... and like one of the others that lived it did, I cut it into generous slices and froze it - it handled that very well...... lovely, moist and tasty.   Many thanks for sharing your family favourite recipe!!...

I have made this recipe and my hubby and I love it!! I only add the 3 tablespoons on steak sauce and I dont use anymore like the recipe says too. I have tried brushing the top of the meatloaf with a little bit extra steak sauce, but just very lightly brushed. It really is a great recipe and super delicious. It's super easy to make. The prep time doesn't take long either.

Made this for my roommate and myself. It was amazing! I added mushrooms and substituted the salt and pepper for tony chachere’s seasoning, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes. I also used manwich sauce instead of steak sauce. Delicious.

My granddaughter found it a little too spicy so next time I will use a little less steak sauce and I won’t brush any on top. I also didn’t have any green pepper but it was still delicious. In the past, I have used ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom of the pan and found it to be too sweet. This recipe will be my new ‘go to’ meatloaf.

I found this recipe to be a top choice in our home. A favorite Go-To. 
Sorry to cherry pick your recipe but I did make a few alterations. 
First my kids don't care for crunchy vegs so i sauteed them on low heat w butter and olive oil(salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, garlic and onion powders) to  soften them before adding to the mix.
Second, I leave out all other seasoning and add one pack of McCormick Meatloaf Seasoning.
Third and finally, I make this in the morning and put it, covered, in the fridge. I take it out 1 hour before placing in the oven. Putting it in the fridge seem to allow all the flavors to mead.
The added A-1 steak sauce on top is a crowd pleaser and a must!   Don't overcook!  Thank you

I'm a single dad who has never made meat loaf before. My son was craving it so I looked up and made it. The receipe was AWESOME. I love it and my son loved it even more! It was the best meatloaf I have ever had. Easy to make and tasted great. I added some ginger and Worcestershire Sauce to the mix that the receipe didn't call for, also a bit more milk and barbecue sauce.

My husband liked it, but I didn't. I  made this exactly like the directions with no substitutions. the consistency was great. It was very moist. The flavor was very bland. I ended up having to put some onion soup seasoning in ketchup to dip it in while I ate it. If I made it again. I would add a packet of onion soup, and about a 1/4 cup of ketchup to the mixture before cooking. I think it would be perfect then.

Next time will leave out the 57 sauce (hubby isn't a fan and I didn't think he would notice lol).  it's a winner for sure!

My  husband doesn't usually care much for meatloaf but he loved this one and requested it again another time. Today, when I answered "Meatloaf" when he wanted to know what dinner was, he smiled and wanted to know when it would be ready.

Today, it was even a little bit better when I added 1 TBSP of Italian seasoning and 1 TBSP of minced garlic. I will keep making this recipe with whatever variations of ingredients I feel like adding. Experiment with it and make it your own.

We really enjoy this recipe. (Even with alterations.)

This was a great meatloaf!  The flavor of the Heinz 57 sauce made it so much more flavorful than just putting catsup/ketchup on top.  And, it held together perfectly for slicing!  We had two meals out of it and it was just as good the next day.  Also, I believe the bread soaked in milk makes a better filler than crackers any day!  (I pulsed the bread in my food processor to make it more like large bread crumbs so it would spread more evenly throughout the meat mixture). Try it, you'll like it!

I changed the servings to 8 and made 2 one pound loaves. I’ve been having issues with getting meatloafs cooked through. This helped greatly. The one change I made is only in wording. I used chopped onions and peppers. I should have diced them. Besides that; great recipe and I’ll do it again with the diced veggies (which I thought was odd but wanted to rate the true recipe).

I made this tonight and it's delicious!  the only adjustment I'd make is to sauteed the onions and pepper first. otherwise you end up biting into a big chunk of raw onion and pepper and it's a little unappetizing. but otherwise it's really good and was done pretty fast.

Good basic meatloaf recipe, I didn't use green pepper. I used Heinz 57 steak sauce and really couldn't taste it-might have to try A-1. I also used 3/4 cup quick cook oats as filler instead of bread.

This was a delicious meatloaf! I was low on A1, so I also used Heinz 57. Also added diced jalapeños and mushrooms since we are all big fans of heat in this house. I doubled it and made 2 loaves, so total cook time was about 1 hour and 20 minutes.

I've made this recipe 3 times in the past month. My only edit was that I cook the onions and peppers before adding them into the mix.  If I don't have a bell pepper in the house, I substitute sweet peppers as I always have them. It turns out moist and delicious every time.  The cook time is perfect for those of us at sea level. Leftovers are always just as yummy. My husband threw out his old recipe since he can't beat this one for taste and texture.  It's a keeper.

There are a few things I would change about this meatloaf. I love onion but one full onion is too much. Bell peppers give it a funky flavor. I changed to celery for a surprise crunch.

The Meatloaf was tasty and juicy. I added approx 1/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a packet of sazon. I will use half an onion opposed to a whole onion next time. I just don’t like a strong onion taste.

Substituted an orange pepper for the green one. Chopped the onions and pepper finely rather than big chunks so they wouldn’t be so obvious. I also used BBQ sauce versus steak sauce. It was delicious.

I hate meatloaf!!  BUT....I make it for my family who all love it.  This particular recipe was a hit with everyone...even me,  because I found it to be so simple to prepare.  Those who ate it thought it was really good.  Served it with some mashed potatoes....a classic!  I’m keeping this one in the rotation.

Meatloaf was tasty and moist, although I didn't have the bell peppers.  My wife missed having diced tomatoes in the mix, and I felt I could have used more steak sauce (Heinz 57) to give a little more kick.

This meatloaf recipe was just ok.  I'd use less breadcrumbs next time and up the addition of herbs and spices.

This recipe has great flavor. But my girlfriend and I thought there was way to much onion and green pepper. I would reduce them both by half. Otherwise it's a great recipe.

I love this recipe. The only thing I changed was to replace the breadcrumbs with oatmeal I blended. It is so moist and flavorful, I love it and everyone I’ve ever made it for has fallen in love with it.

We loved this. Sadly I did not have a bell pepper on hand, used minced red. My partner said it was the best I've made in our 27 yrs together. I thought so also. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious so read thru the comments before I made it and picked which additions I was going to try so I made a loaf that used 2.34 lbs of ground beef . I used stove top stuffing , and sautéd my bell pepper , onion, I added celery and mushrooms and minced garlic . I added thyme and I used A-1 steak sauce and  Worchester sauce to replace salt. Baked in the oven for hour and half at 375 . Came out soooo good one tip I used that I will prob not do again was the bread slices at the bottom. That was gross .. but other than that my kids cleaned their plates !!! Def a redo

Delicious recipe.  I don't have a memory of meatloaf from my childhood, since it is not a traditional dish in my country, Brazil. But anyway it is so flavorful that it did remind me of food made by my grandma.
I used two eggs, since lots of reviews here mentioned that change in the recipe, and it was really good. I added much more black pepper than the amount shown in the video . 
I used three slices of whole wheat bread with grans. I used yellow bell pepper instead of green. I also put some very finely minced parsley.
And I topped it with a very special dressing before taking it to the oven.  I brushed the surface of the meatloaf with pomegranate molasses (I have a bottle of "Gold Gardens", imported from Damascus - Siria, I believe). Turned out really delicious.

Made two of these last night, one for daughter-in-law . They were delicious...tender and juicy.  I did use meatloaf mixture of ground beef, pork, and turkey.  Also A1 Steak sauce.  Used red and yellow peppers as my husband doesn’t like green.  Will absolutely make many times again!! 5 star recipe!

I put my own twist on this since I didn’t start out with the same amount of beef the recipe called for, then I just improvised. I’m so glad I did!

First time making meatloaf, and it turned out great thanks to this recipe.   I made a few changes:   I used Panko bread crumbs.  Didn’t have A1 sauce so I used a homemade concoction:  bit of mustard, wee bit o ketchup, Carolina Gold BBQ sauce, fresh garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and some Schiracha.  Taste was incredible.   Also used 1 lb chopped sirloin and 1/2 pound fresh sausage for the meat.  So tender and house smelled incredible.

This really is the best meatloaf. Be careful not to add extra peppers, as I did to sneak them in to hide from my daughter. It will make it too soft. Any colour peppers works though and ground fibre works in place of breadcrumbs works too. Any way you make it, it is awesome, thanks for sharing.

Excellent, moist recipe. I didn’t have steak sauce so I made a quick sauce with ketchup, mustard, brown sugar and Worcestershire. My son ate 1/2 of the meatloaf and he’s a chicken and turkey kid.

I used Ciabatta Rolls, split, lightly toasted and cut wit scissors into cubes. I never make anything the same way or follow a recipes except as a guide. My mom was a one-off cook that said God gave you a tongue to taste and a nose to smell with..... onion, bell, diced tomatoes, eggs, a smidgen Of bbq sauce cuz no steak sauce in pantry with some Worcestershire. Various spices ... I never had a woman that could out-cook me. I love to cook and I can drop any woman in the kitchen without a recipe.

We tried a lot of different recipes, many were a disappointment, THIS one was GREAT! It was a unanimous vote of 5 stars. Flavors were balanced, texture was pleasing, plus it stayed together and was easy to slice.  I did use dried bread crumbs, crushed, but don't think that made any difference.

I've made this twice so far and both times I haven't had leftovers for more than a day. My husband never liked meatloaf until this recipe and I love it as well. The only things I really changed were the steak sauce and topping. I use A1 instead of heinz 57 and for the topping I use a quarter cup a1, almost a quarter cup of ketchup, and a decent squirter of ray''s bbq sauce mixed together. Also I use 1 cup of diced onion instead of one whole large. Love this recipe though and swear by it!

Excellent!  For the steak sauce I used Heinz 57.  I also added catsup because I feel it makes so many things better.  Also, I used bought breadcrumbs, but I cut it in half along with the milk.  I've made this dish several times and everyone loves it.

I’m sorry, I did not like the steak sauce in the meatloaf. If it was left out it and ketchup was added, it would have been good.

Great taste and texture! I also used a modified version of another recipe on here for meatloaf sauce, just 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 steak sauce (Lea and Perrins Bold)). Everything was delicious! I made two versions of this meatloaf and put them on the smoker, one as written, the other I subbed cheddar cheese for breadcrumbs for a keto version. Both amazing!!!

I added some ketchup along with the steak sauce for the glaze. Also, I used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs. It still made a great meatloaf.

Great recipe. Simple and very good even with 96% lean ground beef. We used A1 steak sauce and turned out delicious. We plan to make again. Goes great with mashed potatoes and something green like asparagus or broccilini and melt in you’re mouth butter rolls.

I loved this meatloaf!  The only changes I made were to use just two tablespoons of Heinz 57 and add 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. I also added an extra egg. The flavor and texture  were great!

It was just okay. Not very seasoned which is not what I’m accustomed to. Way too much onion. I’ll be cutting the onion and bell pepper back to 1/4 cup each next time. Also, I’ll use a seasoned stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs.

I made this recipe and based on multiple reviews, I made some changes.  I used the herb stuffing mix in place of the bread crumbs.  I used two eggs instead of one.  I used 3 tbsp. brown sugar mixed with 1/4 cup ketchup as a glaze on the top.  I mixed the ingredients and the meat mixture seemed very wet.  I added just a slight bit more stuffing mixture but it was still wet.  I added half the amount of salt because one reviewer cautioned it when using a stuffing mix.  However, after tasting the meatloaf, I found it needed more salt.  I cooked it free form sitting atop a few slices of bread to soak up the grease.  I used 1 and 1/2 lb of lean ground beef.  I cooked it to 160 degrees in about an hour.  I let it rest for 10 min.  It cut nice and firm and did not fall apart.  It was not dry but nice and moist.  I found it to be somewhat bland.  I think  it needed more oomph for me.  I will have to tweak the spice blend in it.  There was just some small pink to the meat toward the center so I may cook it slightly longer than one hour the next time.  The husband liked it.

My boyfriend likes a simpler meatloaf and this was perfect. I used 3-1/2 pounds of ground beef, doubled the rest of the ingredients, and we got 2 nice loaves. I will make this recipe again.

This is a great recipe. It is tried and true. I found it to be very close to the recipe my family used for years,  I simply could not duplicate from memory. This recipe allows for personalization without ruining its outcome. I omitted the green peppers and sautéed half of the onions before adding them. This definately added a sweet savory flavor. In a separate but equally successful use of this recipe, I added a quarter cup sweet pepers from a jar cut into pieces  to the mix, and cut the steak sauce in half. This added a whole different twist the boys loved. All in all this is just a great meatloaf recipe to have on hand.

Excellent! Due to a dairy and egg allergy, I omitted the milk and egg and instead added 1/4 cup ketchup and 3 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and baked at 375 for one hour. My picky son ate it all up!

I sautéed the onions with some celery before adding to the mixture and did not use the steak sauce on top. I also cut the amount of salt. The finished product was not salty and did not fall apart. I will make this again.

This really is the best meatloaf. I hate meatloaf. But my husband kept requesting it, so I said, FINE! But I'm going to look for a better recipe, then I found this one, and I couldn't stop eating it. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

DELICIOUS!! So i did not add peppers,  and added a ton of fresh minced garlic, and a sweet white onion minced.  (Usually i use red onion in my burgers).  I also used half n half not milk.
For the steak sauce, I used Peter Luger Steakhouse Old Fashioned Sauce, YUMM. I also bake it at 375 and chek it at 45 minutes with a meat thermometer - 1 hour is just a bit long.  I will keep on making this recipe. thanks!

This was the first meatloaf I've ever made.  I followed the recipe almost to a tee, only changing the 2 slices of bread to Italian seasoned bread crumbs (I used less salt because there was salt in the bread crumbs).  I used A1 as the steak sauce.  My husband even ate leftovers of this and that is something he never does.  It was delicious and moist and didn't crumble as others mentioned.

Great meatloaf!  I substituted  Stubbs Spicey BBQ Sauce instead of the A1 and used grated stale french bread for the bread crumbs.  A family favorite!

Made the recipe according to the directions. Absolutely the worst ever meatloaf I have ever tasted. Why ruin good meat with steak sauce. Steak sauce aught to be banned altogether, ruins the taste of meat. Have never liked steak sauce to begin with, but thought I'd try it in this recipe since all of the reviews were trending on the good side. Will not make it again - disgusting.

My husband loves it!  The flavors especially of the steak  sauce; combined with the moistness of milk-soaked bread makes for an absolutely delicious recipe! This is definitely a keeper.

This is pretty much the best meatloaf recipe I have found (and I've made many!). I followed some reviewers suggestions and added 1 more egg (although I used 2 pounds of a meatloaf blend of pork/beef) and I also added a little ketchup and herbs to the breadcrumbs/milk mixture. The steak sauce is the secret!

Truly a great recipe. I followed the recipe and only made a few minor changes. I added an extra egg, and sautéed the onions and green peppers before adding. Family loved it. Will definitely make again!

Absolutely awesome! I used 2lbs of ground angus and increased each ingredient accordingly. I also added 1 jalapeño with veins and seeds for a little heat: very good and easy. I do meat loaf balls instead of an actual loaf. They cook better and you get more of the "outer shell". My 2lb mix yielded 12 large balls. Saving for another time.

I love this recipe! I’ve never had meatloaf that’s tasted so good. I made this in “cupcake” form so it would cook faster (cut the time in half). My husband loved it so much he said he never wants any other kind of meatloaf again. I used A1 steak sauce, and omitted the peppers because I didn’t have any. I also added a little more egg like some of the other comments mentioned just so it would hold together a little better. Absolutely delicious! Thank you for sharing!

A good recipe. Will make again. I used Stove Top -low sodium chicken instead of bread crumbs and for the sauce topping I used ketchup + A1 + brown sugar (tasted as I go to get the flavor I like).  Put the sauce in after 55 mins in the oven under broil for about 3 mins.

Definitely had to add the second egg for moistness. I guess my onions must be huge, because I only used a half of it and it was almost too much. I love the fact that green pepper is used in this recipe as I always just added it in to my old recipe. Thank you for a great (and easy) meatloaf recipe!!!

I used crushed cheese-it's instead of bread crumbs and A-1 for the steak sauce. I also reduced the salt a bit and added some garlic. It turned out absolutely amazing. This is a great simple recipe to follow or make slight slight changes to.

This was delicious old-school meatloaf.  For the sauce I used A-1 Bold and Spicy, which gave it a little heat.  This one's a keeper.

I added 1/2 lb of pork to this, used 2 eggs and brushed the top with bbq sauce instead of steak sauce. Since I'm a fan of white pepper, I used that instead of black. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs to add a little extra flavor. Then increased the baking time to 2 hours. I always drape foil in the bottom of the pan and long enough to grab and pull the meatloaf out and also put a couple bread heels in the bottom to absorb the fat. I was  hoping for leftovers, but there wasn't a single bite left! Making it again this weekend.

This was very good. Even better the next day.  I did not add as much bread crumbs because I feel they dry it out.  I also added ketchup and mustard, but followed the rest to a T and I loved it!

Made this for a family diner.  Made it exactly as it says and it was fantastic.  Best meatloaf my family had ever eaten.  I used Hinz 57 for the sauce,  which I was hesitant to, I thought it would not give it that traditional meatloaf taste.  I also used the canned progresso garlic and herb breadcrumbs. Super easy and a great homemade meal. I highly recommend it!

The only changes were that I sauteed the onion before I mixed it in and  I didn't have a green pepper so I used an orange bell pepper. 

After it was baked, I topped it with leftover mashed potatoes and cheese and  baked it a few more minutes .  (If I could have used the broiler, I would have preferred to do that.)

Everyone seemed to like the flavor from the steak sauce.  It was different from the usual ketchup/tomato paste flavor most meatloaf recipes usually have.

Made this EXACTLY as written. I have to say it was the absolute worse I've ever had. I'm just glad I made this on a night that my husband was working. This would have been an embarrassment to bring to the table!

After trying many different recipes for meatloaf this was the best by far.  I didn't have Heinz 57 so I used Worcestshire sauce and it came out delicious!

This turned out very moist and very flavorful! Thanks for sharing!!  We used 2 pounds of ground chuck - 1/2 pound more than called for.  We also used yellow sweet peppers instead of green. Just divine!!  Again, thanks for sharing!

Followed all the steps but instead of 1.5 lbs of ground beef I added 1/2 lbs of sweet Italian sausage and 1 lbs of lean ground beef. I also substituted the soft bread crumbs for  1/2 cup of progressive's Italian style bread crumbs  and added an extra egg. AND OMG...so good and gives it a little extra flavor.

I thought it was just okay, but everyone else really liked it. I feel like it needed a little more flavor. I did like the Heinz 57 instead of ketchup though. I might try A1 next time and will definitely add something to give it a little more flavor. Great base recipe though!

I used Italian breadcrumbs and ketchup for the steak sauce, plus ketchup spread on top. I sadly left out the green pepper because of picky people in the family (I love green peppers myself). It was delicious and moist, and probably even better with the bell pepper! My dad said it was "the best he's had in a long time." I had made other meatloaf recipes from this site, so far this is everyone's favorite.

Great recipe! It was my first time making meatloaf and my husband and kids loved it. I used barbecue sauce instead of steak sauce and i added some minced garlic. The only thing i did notice was if you're going to use ground beef with a lot of fat you may have to drain before the whole cooking time is done because i used the 20% and it let out a lot of grease and shrunk the meat. Definitely going to add this to our dinner nights

This was such a delicious meatloaf' I used Panko instead of soft bread crumbs because it's what I had on hand. it was nice to have a good meatloaf with subtle flavors shining through. It sliced without falling apart too. I'll definitely make this one again.

This was good. I used A1, and ground up some old plain croutons I had.  Since crumbs were plain, I added a bit of Mitchell St seasoning (a blend for steak from The Spice House).  I used red pepper since that was what I had. It held together well and sliced nicely, but I can't give it rave reviews-it was just good. I could make it again, but have another recipe I prefer.

I use a mix of 1 lb. 90/10 ground beef & 1/2 lb. ground pork. I use barbeque sauce, (Sweet Baby Ray's), in place of steak sauce, and use Lipton Beefy Onion Soup mix instead of fresh onion, and top the loaf with sliced cheddar or swiss cheese...

This is the best, I add a topping of ketchup and brown sugar, equal parts and after drawing the pan the last time with about 15 minutes left, I add the topping and then broil on hi to my likening. Nobody fussed about the greatest meatloaf ever. I follow all other ingredients exactly. It's perfect.

I liked this recipe but did make a couple of changes - some were based on other reviews.  I used ground turkey because we don't eat red meat.  I didn't have steak sauce so I substituted barbecue sauce.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used a mix of crushed Ritz crackers and stuffing mix.  Also added some Worcestershire sauce as some suggested.  It came out great.  Oh, I also added minced garlic because everything is better with garlic!

Turned out DELICIOUS!!  I bought the ground beef from New York Butcher Shop. I added 2 minced garlic cloves along with 1/2 diced green pepper and 1/2 diced onion. I used a meat thermometer to get the internal temperature to 155 degrees (about 1 hour) and then let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes. My family devoured it.

I made this meatloaf for my elderly parents. I used 1lb lean ground beef, 1/2 lb ground pork and changed out the bread crumbs for panko. I didn't put the remaining steak sauce on top, I made packaged beef gravy and added sautéed mushrooms to the gravy. It turned out very moist and my picky parents loved it!

I really liked the flavor of this recipe. I did cube 4 slices of bread and added some bread crumbs. One egg held it together nicely. I used ground sea salt and regular black pepper. I added maybe a quarter cup of ketchup and 3 tablespoonfuls of brown sugar to the mixture. I had some Heinz Hot and Spicy ketchup so I used that as a topper, and It was awesome. This is truly a keeper recipe. I will call this A-1 steaksauce meatloaf. I have made many varieties, but this one is one my husband wants a slice to take to work for lunch every day, so that is a HUGE compliment that it is good.

Really yummy! I made the mistake of not adding enough eggs. I upped the meat to 2 pounds to fill by loaf pan but 3 eggs would have held it together better than the 2 I used. I liked the addition of steak sauce in the meatloaf itself but next time I make this I will stick to a ketchup-based glaze for the top. Overall the recipe is delicious and I'm looking forward to using the leftovers for meatloaf sandwiches!

loved this recipe. I used just regular heinz ketchup instead of bbq sauce internally but put bbq sauce over the top and used crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs from necessity, but turned out fantastic.

I thought it was a little bland. I added just a bit of chopped/diced jalapeno for zest, but overall not enough flavor. I think if you sauteed the veggies first, then mixed in, maybe it would be better. Also might try using a high-fat ground beef.

I left out the seasonings and onion peppers. Picky eaters in my home. Replaced with McCormick meatloaf seasoning and used 2lb of hamburger. I had to cook for an extra ten miniutes. Very tasty!

I like spicy so I added red pepper, garlic and oregano. Mom always sprinkled a little brown sugar and catsup for a little "crust" on top. I added that also. 5 star dish.

Delicious & so easy! I gave this 5 stars based on the posted recipe, although I did make a few changes. I tried using stuffing mix in place of the bread crumbs per some reviewers.. I WILL NOT do that again. Put 3 Tbsp steak sauce in the meat mixture and used ketchup & BBQ sauce for the top w 3 strips bacon.. I WILL do that again! And I cooked the veggies to soften them before adding to meat mixture. Also good idea! Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was a very nice change from my original. I used to use a catsup  base instead of steak sauce or milk. I thoroughly enjoyed this meatloaf ,wish I would've had leftovers for the next day. The only alterations I made were using half a cup of onion half a cup of green pepper. My breadcrumbs were made from two slices of bread toasted and the rest of the measurement from Ritz crackers. I ran my mouth so much that my mom asked for the recipe.Oh I forgot I used the quarter cup of steak sauce in the meatloaf and put more additional on top when cooking nice recipe totally.

I doubled this recipe and my family of 6 ate it all! I made some modifications: 1) Use Pepperidge Farms herb seasoned stuffing instead of bread crumbs. Buy the crumbs, not cubes - You can put them in a ziplock and pound them into crumbs if you need to. 2) Add 1/4 cup salsa to add flavor - can use tomato sauce if you don't have salsa. 3) Add 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. 4) Do not cook with steak sauce on top. Last 5 minutes of cooking time, add tomato sauce or some spare Pasta sauce on top and place back in oven 5 minutes.

Excellent recipe. I used ground turkey and added from my freeze dried food - mixed bell peppers and mushrooms. Also added Worcestershire sauce and some ketchup in the mix. I then topped with a sauce of ketchup, dijon mustard and brown sugar.

Very good, easy recipe and my favorite for meatloaf so far.  My two boys and husband loved it too.  Chopping the veggies in a food processor helped to hide the veggies.  I didn't need extra egg even though I changed the servings from 6 to 8.  I used canned Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.

Ok, wonderful basic recipe.  I used Stove Top Savory Herb stuffing dry, about half a package for a pound of lean hamburger, 1/3 chopped onion and green bell pepper.  One egg, about a 1/3 cup of Heinz 57 sauce and mixed it all by hand in a bowl, trick: I ALWAYS use surgical blue non powder gloves when doing recipes with hand mixing and when I do dishes by hand, saves your nails and cleaning time!  Anyway, it is baking right now in my convection oven at 350 for about an hour.  On the top, before I baked it, I squirted some 57 and ketchup, of course Heinz, like a fancy desert and put it in the oven.  I used a single sheet of pre-cut sheets of foil on the bottom for easy clean up!  The house smells WONDERFUL right now and I know it will be delish!

I made this tonight and this recipe is a winner! My new go-to meatloaf recipe. I stuck to the recipe, but would probably cut back on the salt next time.  Others wise, it's perfect! Nice and moist and flavorful!

Great easy recipe.  Instead of chopped green pepper, I through in about a 1/2 cup of salsa. Kids loved the "new meatloaf"!

Will make again

I forgot to put the steak sauce in the meat but I still feel it came out delicious.

I used A1 steak sauce and 1/3 of a cup of A1 combined with the green pepper was just overpowering. It was far too strong/intense and overly salty...  The meatloaf was wonderfully moist and would have been far better without steak sauce and perhaps topped with ketchup rather than more steak sauce.  Great recipe but I would advise cooks to cut out the steak sauce and reduce the amount of green peppers...  *Heinz  57 (as recommended) might not be as terribly overwhelming...  I did use panko bread crumbs which worked out nicely.  I plan to use this recipe again but next time without the steak sauce or green peppers  - and I am sure it will be more to my liking!

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it! Even my daughter, who is a really picky eater liked it! It was really moist and had a nice flavor. This is my new go to recipe for meatloaf.

So easy and so good. Before I put it in the oven I thought it was going to be to moist and fall apart but after cooking it as perfection.

I made this for a 72 year old friend. He was so pleased and said it tasted just like his mother's recipe. I  count that as a win!!! (I didn't have steak sauce so I used Worcester sauce)

The only meatloaf I make for my family I must confess that I didn't want to make meatloaf because of the horrible recipes I was subjected to as a child. My faith has been restored.. I love the zestiness of the A1 steak sauce that I use. I also replaced breadcrumbs with Panko and it gives it a healthier twist and a little bit of a different texture. The meatloaf is very moist without being soggy. And I love the concept of brushing A1 steak sauce on the top and sprinkling some Panko on top of that it browns beautifully. 10 stars!

I doubled the recipe.  It was so perfect.  The only thing that I will change is the sauce.  I would prefer it not to be that sweet but I used natural ketchup (which tends to be sweeter).  Maybe I'll cut down on the brown sugar just a little.

I made this 8/25/16.  Didn't have breadcrumbs so I substituted with 1 box chicken flavored stove top stuffing.  Also didn't have bell pepper.  I chopped a half red onion and sautéed with minced garlic.  Followed recipe otherwise.  Delicious, moist and tasty.  This will be my new meatloaf "go to" recipe.  Yum!

I put the onion and green pepper in a blender first since I don't like big chunks of either in my meatloaf. I also used Italian bread crumbs, and only the yolk of the egg. Turned out very tasty, just be careful not to add all the steak sauce into the meatloaf like I have done twice now (small portion goes in meatloaf, rest on top!)

This has become our go-to meatloaf recipe.  The Heinz 57 steak sauce is pretty expensive, but there is a copycat recipe right here on the site for mixing an inexpensive, identical tasting version of the sauce. 

We do sometimes use ground oatmeal for the bread crumbs.   The Vitamix is great for grinding the oatmeal.  That is actually healthier, but we also use the bread crumbs, if we have them.  The two variations don't have any flavor difference.  

I don't get people who change recipes and then say they don't like it.  I made this exactly to the recipe and have never been disappointed.  Love this meatloaf.

I am not fond of meatloaf but this is definitely a keeper recipe. I only deviated from the recipe on 2 things, otherwise, I followed all the instructions and used the same ingredients. I changed the soft bread crumbs to dry bread crumbs and put brown sugar on top of the meatloaf before pouring the sauce on top.
It came out moist and really tasty. I definitely will make this again.

This was a delicious meatloaf.  My son and I truly enjoyed it.  I added ketchup to the loaf once it was on my table to be served.  YUMMMMMM ...  Will I make it again?  Absolutely. I followed the directions exactly as written and will do the same in the future.  Thank you for this excellent recipe (and I don't even like to cook :)

works great with ground turkey or chicken instead of beef also. Used old fashioned oats soaked in the milk for a minute instead of bread crumbs.  Also sautéed onions in a bit of olive oil before adding.  Thumbs up.!!

I enjoyed this recipe! I didn't have any A1 or Steak Sauce so I used my favorite BBQ sauce (with both ketchup and mustard). I LOVE mustard on my meatloaf. 
I also omitted the green peppers because I don't have any. (don't really care for them much anyway)
I only had 1 lb of ground beef so I only added about half the milk because it was looking too wet. 
My only complaint is that even after spraying my bread pan, the meatloaf is totally stuck to the bottom. Next time I'll use the tinfoil throw away ones. Lol

Thanks for this recipe. I will be making this again but will probably add some of my own touches for more flavor.

Flavor was good but the mixture seemed too wet. Omitted the green pepper for personal taste.

A delicious meatloaf! I added a few extra seasonings; 1/2 tsp each of dried parsley, dried chives and dried sage. I used 2 lbs of lean ground sirloin and added 2 eggs instead of one. I used A-1 Bold and Spicy which gave it a nice zing to the flavor. It did take a little longer to cook since I increased the amount of ground beef. Just before it was done I brushed a mixture of 2Tbs each of barbecue sauce, ketchup and brown sugar on the top and increased the oven temperature to broil for about 5 minutes to give the top a nice carmelized glaze.

Very good.  I used ketchup instead of milk.  For the bread crumbs I used seasoned stuffing bread.  for the sauce I used 1/2 Heinz 57 and 1/2 seasoned ketchup.

This is a great recipe!!  I've made four times now.  The only small change I make each time is, I use only one pound of ground beef,  then  add 1/2 pound of ground sage sausage.  My family likes the spicer taste the sausage gives the meatloaf.  Lastly, I found if you take take the loaf out of the oven and allow it to rest for 10 mins or so,  it slices out perfectly in firm slices.

I only gave 4 stars because I'm not a huge fan of meatloaf. My husband loves it though. I made it hoping I had found one that would be acceptable to eat, and this one was actually really good. There's no ketchup, which was apparently the reason I never really liked meatloaf... I'm not a fan of ketchup (get over it lol). You can taste the A1 in this, but it's subtle. My husband doesn't like onions, but I used beefy onion soup mix in place of the actual onions, which was helpful. I also happened to be out of milk right then, so that became beef broth instead. I also didn't use Bell pepper because I didn't have any, but I never have any because we're not huge fans. I will definitely make this again though, with the same changes!

This is very decent it lacks the ketchup and brown sugar used by most cooks this must have something to do with America's obcession with ketchup from the days of the first fast food restaurants, according to my research that's pretty much where it started,  I am Jewish although I was born a U.S. citisen, some flavors seem strange to me and I a gourmet chef though handicapped now. I believe you've hit a a pretty decent recipe, by the way if you would like the recipe for one of my family's favorites called taco meatloaf you can contact this website and they will ask me if I wish to respond, taco meatloaf is great for camping and various other activities where you don't wish ti bring along to many dishes you can use it straight in tortillas with a little cheese, great for people who don't want to carry five dishes for tacos or whatever I have other camper style recipes, because of my need to reconnect to our dwindling wildlife areas and other natural landscapes. Thank you.

My husband and son love this recipe.  I always make 2 and they can have leftovers the next night.  I do make one small change.  I love Pepperidge Farms Herb stuffing and I use it in place of bread crumbs.

Made it like the recipe called for except I substituted Bar-BQ sauce for steak sauce. Great meal for us all. The next day We made Meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers. A slice of fresh Swiss cheese & your choice of condiment will make you savor it again  and again.

This is an excellent meatloaf recipe! I changed a few things up though, I used crushed ritz crackers for bread crumbs because that's all I had on hand and actually didn't realize until I came back to make it again that I also used A1 steak sauce the 1st time! The flavor was perfect! However, I used more hamburger than the recipe called for and it took much longer to cook, I think next time I will cook it on 375 for a shorter amount of time. My family loved it!!

omg, omg,omg!  Did I say omg?  This meatloaf was amazing. I didn't have steak sauce so I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, 2 tsp of liquid smoke,  2 tsp of Applewood rub, left out the peppers and used only 1/4 cup milk. I also used seasoned stuffing cubes instead of bread crumbs.  Made a glaze of ketchup, yellow mustard and brown sugar for the top.  Used to hate blah meatloaf but I will make this over and over again!  It's a winner.

Very moist ... Very good!!! Would def make again. I think husband would like this one. He usually hates meatloaf because of the brown sugar ketchup mix on top. Next time I think I would like to try pureeing in the onion and green peppers instead of having chunks throughout.

Delicious!!! I made it last night for dinner. My toddler loved and so her little friend that was here for dinner. Big hit!! And today my husband took some left over to work and here is what he said: "Your meatloaf is a big hit in the office,  you'll have to make some to bring in lol. Everyone was trying to figure out where the smell was coming from.  People were coming from down the hall"

OMG this is awesome,  I did add red, yellow and orange peppers and a Jalapeño for kick instead of a green pepper plus a couple cloves garlic.  Definitely will be making this again!

Best Meatloaf recipe ever. I've been making Meat Loaf for 45 years, and it was always so bland!  I used this recipe and was told by my son and husband that it was the best meatloaf I've ever made! It was so moist and tasty! Thanks so much -this is now my new recipe for meatloaf!

Very good !  I didn't have green pepper but had a yellow pepper which was very nice in this dish...actually a little easier on the tummy.  I also made it with half ground turkey and half ground Angus beef.

Turned out great for me. The one thing I do differently with my meatloaf is coat it with cream of mushroom and roasted garlic rather than doing a ketchup glaze because my family prefers the savory crust.

Great recipe. I changed a few things because I had originally bought ingredients for something different. I sautéed the onions and two cloves of garlic first and added paprika while cooking the onions and garlic down. I also used one pound beef, one pound pork and one pound of pork sausage. So I doubled the recipe. I also didn't have Heinz 57 so instead used ketchup mixed with Worcestershire and good quality tomato paste in a tube. I ended up with two very moist and tasty loaves of meatloaf. I will definitely make this again.

I made this last night and it was very good. I changed a few things. I sautéed the onions and seasoned them until tender and I did not add the egg. I also let the breadcrumbs soak into the milk and then added it to the mixture. The meatloaf came out very tender and flavorful. I made this meatloaf with a side of roasted potatoes.

I tried branching away from our normal meatloaf recipe... and this really was a good recipe, however it didn't quite meet my high expectations. With that said, I would keep it around and try it again with some adjustments. It just was a little bland to me...

If you like a plain and very simple meatloaf... this is it. However, i feel as though the title and ratings of this recipe are misleading. It is no where near the best meatloaf I've ever had. It's not bad... just not great either. Very basic.

This is a spot on recipe. Very tasty and moist. I have l've loved meatloaf since I was a boy and this is the best I've ever had. If you're having company over, be prepared to see the smiles on their faces after the first bite.

I wish I give this meatloaf more than 5 stars!!
I'm a great cook but my meatloaf always sucked, seriously! I tried every recipe I could find without success. I finally quit making it about 15 years ago. I bumped into this recipe and gave it a try. It truly is the best meatloaf! I use 1lb ground beef and the lb mild or hot Italian sausage. Yum Yum Yum! I mold it into single serving loafs. Perfect for a leftover and lunches at work or school 
I highly recommend!

Good!  I accidentally put all the steak sauce in the mix, so I added bbq sauce and more steak sauce on top.  My hamburger was 1.3 lbs, as well and the bread crumbs were seasoned. It was very moist and delicious.

This is a good basic recipe.  I found it rather bland even though I used A1.  I followed it exactly, leaving out the green pepper.  Too much onion unless you're just an onion lover, so I recommend a small onion minced.  I agree with many of the other reviews, adding ketchup or spicer sauce, even "dressing" as some suggested would jazz this basic meatloaf up a notch.

I only had 1 lb of lean ground beef. I diced onion and red bell pepper since i didn't have green. Also used garlic &herb flavored bread crumbs. Used Heinz 57. It was very moist and flavorful.  Should have been more generous with the Heinz sauce on top.  Will make again!

I love this recipe. I put the entire calling for BBQ sauce into the mixture and then use however much BBQ sauce I need to coat it. I also usually switch it up with the peppers. Sometimes I use red bells, or red/orange/yellow as a combo. Regardless, I've never had any complaints. It comes out amazing every time.

Meh, I have made this twice and the first time it was bland and there was way too much moisture so that it just fell apart. Also, the peppers and onions were not cooked enough. 

The second time I reduced the amount of milk to 1/3 cup and added some spicy brown mustard along with the steak sauce. I sauteed the vegetables in little white wine and butter. Also, the second time around I used some wheat bread with body to it, not just some fluffy white bread and I felt that it made a better texture. The second go around was much more flavorful and had a better coherency.

I made two easy alterations and this was possibly the best meatloaf recipe I've ever had. First, I combined the 1/3 cup of steak sauce (A1) with 2/3 cup of ketchup (Heinz) so that I had plenty of extra for basting the top of the loaf before baking. Second, I added a tablespoon of chopped basil to the mix and it took it to another level. Basil is the key, folks. Enjoy!

This was and is my favorite meat loaf. I have made meatloaf and it was always a disaster. But this recipe was awesome. My husband loved it. The only change I made was using bbq sauce instead of steak sauce. I was so proud of myself and was so happy to have my husband tell me great job!!!

I didn't have any BBQ sauce so I used a soy teriyaki sauce and it turned out amazing! I also used mixed frozen bell peppers (red, yellow, orange) rather than green peppers. I think I may have used some half & half (cream) instead of milk because I didn't have any. But I can't remember, it was a few weeks ago. My husband loved it so much and asked me to make it exactly the same way again. The two of us polished off the entire loaf. It was really juicy and moist. I might consider adding less liquid next time because it was actually so juice it just crumbled instead of staying in the "sliced" shape. I'm making it again tonight and I'm going to try mixing in chopped baby Bella mushrooms as well.

Very good.  For a twist, my son likes it with cheddar cheese added to the mix before cooking.  Comes out great each way.

My husband and I loved this recipe! It came out super moist. I used the instructed amount of Italian bread crumbs. It seemed a little wet to me so I added a 1/4-1/2 cup of oatmeal. I didn't use the full amount of ketchup just enough to coat the top. It came out with its same shape but was beginning to fall apart. Definitely didn't cook it the full hour. Maybe since I used my convection oven, it took less time. Served with Mac & Cheese and it was a perfect home cooked comfort meal!

Very delicious - never have tried meatloaf without ketchup in the recipe, but this was great! I would like to point out that if you use A1 steak sauce it adds quite a bit of salt. I only used 1 teaspoon of salt and it still was a bit salty.

I have a foreign exchange student from Belgium, and he loves this meatloaf.  I make it every couple of weeks and freeze it in single-serving portions so he can help himself... and he does!  He had some for breakfast yesterday morning!

I follow the recipe except I only had Corn Flake crumbs on hand instead of bread crumbs the first time I made it, so that's what I use.

Fantastic! I have really picky eaters (who most of the time opt for a bowl of cereal instead of my cooking) and they devoured this, they actually begged me to make it tonight instead of sloppy joes (one of their faves). Thanks! :)

Yes, indeed this is the best homemade meatloaf. This will be my second time cooking this. I use Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, and fresh garlic.....

This meatloaf was outstanding! Very tasty, I added 2 eggs and used stovetop vs bread crumbs. I did not add salt. I also used a can of tomato sauce, 1 cup of brown sugar and 1tsp of Worcestershire sauce for the topping. Very filling!

I substituted ketchup for the steak sauce since I'm not a big fan of steak sauce. This turned out to be the best meatloaf I've ever had. Moist, flavorful, and absolutely perfect.

This was a very good recipe. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. I used plain bread crumbs, and A1 sauce. Instead of A1 sauce on top I used BBQ sauce. I did not add bell peppers. I made it exactly the same otherwise. Thank you for sharing.

Best meatloaf ever. Very moist and came out whole when cut into. A better quality steak sauce is the only thing to change to improve anything.

This has a great classic meatloaf flavor. Many meatloaf recipes I've tried before just tasted like seasoned ground beef. This one is excellent!  My husband and four kids all enjoyed it as did I. I would probably reduce the salt slightly and I did not use green peppers, used minced dried onion instead of fresh since that's what I had. I'll make again for sure!

So I am very happy I found this recipe! I added BBQ sauce and used red bell pepper instead of green. My mom and I were grubbing like there was no tomorrow. I'll be sticking with this :)

I didn't like it at all. My kids loves meatloaf but they didn't like it either. This was my first time using A1 sauce so I'm not sure if that was the reason or not.

I was taught this recipe by my father.  It is almost exactly as he taught me minus the salt.  I was always taught enough salt in other things like condiments we don't need to add more.

This really is the best meatloaf! Very easy and delicious. I cut the ingredients in 1/2 because it is just me. I used ground turkey and bbq sauce instead of steak sauce and it came out delicious.

I really liked this. It's very moist. The only thing I was unsure about was the bell pepper. I love bell pepper but I'm not sure I want it in my meat loaf. I will make it again without the bell pepper .

Loved it!  Made it just like the recipe with one exception.  I put all the steak sauce in the meatloaf and covered the top with catsup.  Served it up w/buttered baby carrots, mashed potatoes & brown gravy.  Oh, yum-mm!

I made this for dinner tonight. It was actually my first meatloaf and I have to say I loved it! I only made one tiny change and that was instead of putting the remaining steak sauce on the top, I put ketchup on it. Thanks again for making my first meatloaf great!

This meatloaf is amazing. I am in college and I have gotten so sick of eating junk food so I grab a bell pepper and an onion when I go to the store, and everything else is stuff I have usually. Takes an hour and feeds me for 3-4 days! And actually tastes awesome!

I didn't use the Pepper.  Used 4 slices of shredded white bread instead of bread crumbs, and used Stubb's BBQ sauce, instead of A-1.  I also peeled and sliced up a Russet potato in 1/4" cubes, and cooked them in butter until cook thru, with the onion, before mixing all ingredients.  Wow.  Delicious.  Topped with shredded Mozzarella while it cooled.  Kids loved it.  I know we need to rate the recipe, but I would never have found this without what was posted.  Thank you.

I have made this several times (sometimes twice a week by request) and it's a huge hit! I use a dry onion soup mix instead of peppers and onions, leave out the salt and voila! A dish enjoyed by all! Thanks so much!

We had to modify the recipe due to what we had on hand, but we LOVED IT!  We made a double batch that used not only ground beef, but Italian Sausage and Elk meat.  

We didn't have any steak sauce on hand, so we used some BBQ sauce mixed with Tamari Soy Sauce for the meatloaf mixture.  We used Almond Milk instead of real Milk, and Roasted Red Peppers instead of Green Peppers.

For the sauce, we opted for my family tradition of mixing 1/2 cup Picante sauce, with 1/2 cup of Ketchup, but honestly, it was yummy without the sauce!

I used this as my base recipe. As others recommended, I used leftover stuffing crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  I don't like cooked peppers so I used celery and used a red onion rather than a plain white one. I ran out of steak sauce so I mixed some ketchup with Worcestershire and liquid smoke ( tastes just like steak sauce) and finally I mixed in a packet of Lipton onion soup mix.  After adding these things, I believe it is the BEST meatloaf I've ever tasted. My amendments gave it the perfect flavor.  Served with garlic/red mashed potatoes and green bean casserole.

This was my first ever Meat Loaf, no i'm not a new cook, but I have never cared for Meatloaf until now. I tweaked a bit by adding 1 can of Cream of Mushroom Soup and reduced my Milk.I also used Woretheshire Sauce. It came out really moist and delecious. I will definitely use this recipe from now on. Thanks, great recipe!

This will be my go-to recipe for meatloaf.  I will likely adapt it to include chicken sausages or for various other ingredients, but it is very juicy and moist.  I also don't use a loaf pan, but form a loaf shape on a cookie sheet and raise the temperature to 375 (time stays the same because I increase the amount of meat slightly).

I've made this twice now and it is wonderful. I hated my mom's meatloaf and really hadn't had meatloaf since, but decided after buying a cool meatloaf pan that has a lift-out insert, that maybe I should try it. I'm pretty sure I used more pepper n onions than directed, but it was moist n flavorful. Thank you for giving me a new dish to serve!

Very moist, tasty meatloaf...the steak sauce was a nice addition. My sister made this this evening and it was really good. She used a little less steak sauce than the recipe called for, but I think it would have been fine with the entire called-for amount. She topped one loaf with steak sauce and one with brown sugar and ketchup. Both toppings tasted great. I rarely get in the mood for meatloaf, but when I do I'll be making this recipe.

No offense to the original poster but I think this is the most boring meatloaf recipe ever.  It is typical bland tasteless meatloaf that one would expect in a school cafeteria. It was just a plain block of meat. Martha Stewart's meatloaf recipe is still the best. I only tried this one because I was looking for something less time consuming. It was faster to make but very disappointing to eat.

Husband is allergic to tomatos, tried this recipie, he loves it. I throw in about 4 TBLSPNS of brown sugar. Kids love it too. Father in law hates meatloaf but always asks me to make mine for him. I like onion and bell pepper but leave them out because of my son. He is autistic and would just pick them out anyway.

Awesome taste, very moist!  I cooked it in the Microwave about 15 minutes because I was on a time crunch.  It is best when cooked in the oven.  I also added some tomato paste on top because my husband likes to spoon the juices over his piece on his plate!

The first time I made this I used A-1 because that is what I had  on hand. The next time I used the  Heinz 57 and it was very good not a piece left. I am making it again tonight as requested but will have to increase the amount.

My kids raved over this meatloaf and I even have to admit...it was a lot better than my grandmother's recipe!  I was leery about adding milk...but whatever it does, it works!  This is a delicious dinner.

Oh this is very easy and very delicious. It's the first time I've ever used milk in a meatloaf recipe and even my husband really loved the tenderness and flavor. I did get some pretty nice cudo's and I thank each of you for that! I actually used Ritz crackers  because of a lack of anything else on hand and used half A-1 and half Heinz 57 steak sauce. I also made a delicately cut mix of fresh - carrots, green beans, zuchini, and yellow squash cooked until just a little bit crispy. Went real well with it.

Made as is and it was really good.  I used a knock off A-1 sauce and it tasted great.  A whole onion chopped is a bit much; half would be fine.  Served it with pasta-roni for an easy, nice meal that the whole family liked.

This is the first meatloaf I've ever made and it was the BEST meatloaf I've EVER had!! It was the first thing my kids ate on their plate and they hate meatloaf! My husband even loved it and he cooks for a living! I will never make another meatloaf any other way. The title says it all: The Best Meatloaf.

Simple, easy and delish, but I made some changes.  Instead of milk, I used beer and I substituted half of the breadcrumbs with wheatgerm.  The steak sauce I used was the brand used by "The Keg" steak restaurant.. mmmmm.

This meatloaf is so good!  I followed the directions, except I only had 4 tbsp of steak sauce so that's all I used.

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe for someone who always hated meatloaf! My husband and I love it. I follow it pretty closely, I usually add in more bread crumbs (and I'll use seasoned ones for a little extra flavor) as I mix the meat and sauce to get it firmed up. Thank you for sharing this!

My husband and I absolutely loved it but I would of liked it better with only half of an onion.  I also added about 1/8-1/4 cup of brown sugar on top to give it a little more sweetness.  But over all amazing :)

Used italian bread crups and omited added salt.  Steak sauce was over powering.  I think puting BBQ sauce on top would be better.

Came out a little dry, I think it was because I used breadcrumbs and less milk (I only had evaporated on hand) and omitted onions and peppers. Had nice flavor though. Would try it again but would follow the recipe more closely.

I thought it was bland the first time I made it a few years ago, but I "accidently" made it again last night. I had not realized it was the same recipe till it was in the oven. My bad, but it's still flavorless. It is a good base recipe, but needs to be kicked up a couple of notches. Maybe a salsa glaze, or combine with some jalepenos.

I added garlic, and used ground chuck AND sausage making 2 lbs total.  This turned out to very tasty and exceeded even my expectations.  What a wonderful recipe.  Even my kids loved it.  (They are the pickiest eaters on the planet!)

Recipe was good I left out the bell peppers (some in the house hate peppers) It did take longer to cook than the recipe said but will use stuffing instead of bread crumbs.

This recipe was pretty good. I left out the bell pepper as hubby hates peppers. It had a great flavor that I attribute to my own steak sauce (a mixture of bbq sauce, soy, worchestershire, and hot sauce). I'm rating it only four because it took longer to cook than the recipe states. It took an hour and a half, so dinner was later than usual. Will make this again.

Very yummy.  My husband love it too. I like the steak sauce, used A1.  I have made different meatloaf recipes, but really like this one.  It was moist, and had a zing.  I didn't use the green peppers, but everything else.

My non picky kids devored it...  Made it pretty much as directed.  Used Bulls-Eye Bold original for a solid BBQ taste.  I have made this numerous times and will continue to do so.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, but I don't think it was the best.  I followed the recipe as stated, except I added a little garlic.  Really, it just tastes like steak sauce.  The meat is not seasoned except with salt and pepper.  I love steak sauce, but I could have gotten the same flavor (with a lot less work) out of a hamburger with steak sauce on it.  I don't have my own meatloaf recipe -- usually, I just throw typical ingredients together and use a package of meatloaf seasoning.  I've been looking for the perfect recipe.  This wasn't it.  The meat itself is bland, and the only flavor is from the steak sauce.  Make sure you use a steak sauce that you love, as that is the only flavor.  I'll keep looking for the perfect recipe.

This recipe was excellent! My family loved it. I didn't have bread crumbs so I used unsalted crackers, and I also didn't have steak sauce so I used bbq sauce. I put bacon on the top with the bbq sauce and it was amazing. I finally found a meatloaf recipe that I love and will use from now on!

I don't think the breadcrumbs work with this dish, it was like eating a good meatloaf with random bites of just breadcrumbs.

Very good. I added celery to the mixture, and it was great. My husband isn't a meatloaf fan, but he said that this was the best meatloaf he has tasted yet.

fantastic.  I used an "old fashioned" steak sauce brand.  I did make it a bit larger by adding an egg, extra breadcrumbs (italian), and 2 lbs of ground meat instead of 1 1/2. For meat I used about 1 1/2 lbs of beef and 1/2lb ground veal.  Came out amazing!  For awesome meatloaf - get the set of loaf pans that has holes in the bottom of the first pan, and another pan underneath to catch the drippings.  Comes out amazing every time.

This is a great meatloaf. Very flavorful.  I used dry bread crumbs since that's what I had, chose A1 Steak Sauce and left out the green pepper.  Very moist and not bland at all.

Meatloaf has always been my nemesis, either too wet, too dry, or just lacked flavor.  This worked out very well.  It was comparable to the meatloaf mom always made.  I added some carrot to the mix, as well as a bouillon cube to the mix for a little flavor boost.  Will defiantly be my meatloaf recipe of choice

I thought the meatloaf could have used a little more flavor.  I might try adding mushrooms, more green pepper, and maybe onion soup mix.  I also thought the idea of adding bacon to the top sounded great.  I will add this to the top of my meatloaf recipies.

I wanted to try something different.  Hubby liked it OK, but was not thrilled. I just did not care for this at all.  I make mine with italian bread crumbs, sauted bell pepper and onion, italian stewed tomatoes and little tomato sauce.  I also put a little tomato sauce mixed with some brown sugar on the top.  (yummy)  I will not be making with again.  I will just stick with my recipe.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is always fun to try something.

I never made meatloaf in my life, this was great! I didn't change anything too much, I threw in some red peppers for more flavor and color! My fiancee loved it and asked me to make it again next week.

This meatloaf was excellent.  My whole family loved it.  I followed it exactly as the directions stated.  The only thing is, it was not very sturdy as a meatloaf.  It seem to break quite easily, but never the less ... delicious.

I followed the amounts given in this recipe, although added a few more spices and used bbq sauce instead of steak sauce.  My husband loved the flavor, but I was dissapointed with the texture - it stuck to the pan despite being a greased, non-stick pan, and fell apart - was quite crumbly.  So, I'll be looking for something moister that sticks together better, for my husband to make sandwiches with.

My husband loved this recipe.  He grew up hating meatloaf, but not me, so I tried this.  I used a stoneware loaf pan and I had to bake it for an extra half hour.  I also used premade breadcrumbs.

I thought this recipe was good but the rest of my family loved it.  So I wanted to give it 4 stars.  I might have liked it better if I had substituted the stuffing mix for the bread crumbs (suggested by other reviewers).

I have never made a meatloaf before, so was not sure how I'd like it.  This was absolutely wonderful!  We've been eating it for 3 days now, and it only gets better. A couple of notes:  It took longer to cook than noted here to reach the internal temp of 160 degrees, and I didn't add the bell pepper.   It was delicious, moist, quick and made for great leftovers.

My husband loved this recipe... said it was the best thing that I have made yet! As a newlywed, I am testing out different recipes and ideas for the two of us. The only thing that I would change is to add slightly less onions and chop the onion and green pepper very, very tiny.

I should have made less, and removed the water that collected in the dish halfway through cooking.  Flavor was ok.

I agree with another reviewer that the steak sauce is a litte too strong- recipe is ok but I would not consider it the best.

Thank you so much this recipe is great.  There was half a loaf left over and my husband ate the whole thing by himself the next day.

I was a bit nervous about just picking a steak sauce to use in this...but I used what I would typically use to make hamburgers.  (It's called Dale's- a bit more local here in NC I think.)  The meatloaf turned out great, lots of flavor and very moist.  I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious.  I  used Trader Joe's Organic Steak sauce and instead of onion and green pepper, I used Tastefully Simple Onion Onion.  It's a keeper and I will make it again for sure!!!

This was delicious.  Very moist and rich.  We used a homemade BBQ sauce instead of steak sauce simply because we had it on hand.  Will definitely make again!

The flavor wasn't as rich as I'd hoped, but overall it was delightfully tasty and provided a nice vacation from our usual meatloaf. I think next time, I'll try marinating the meat in the steak sauce for an hour or two before mixing in the rest of the ingredients.

Very good. My six year old son cleaned his plate and my husband had seconds. There was a lot of grease in the bottom of the pan, so I think I'll have to store the left overs in a different container.

I substituted steak sauce for barbecue sauce.  Also, I only put in about 3/4 tsp. of salt and it was still to much for my liking.  Otherwise, great recipe to use as a base.

This is our new favorite meatloaf recipe - the only change that I make is to use less steak sauce on the top of the meatloaf ... I put a very thin layer on, which still keeps it moist and not as strong.  Thank you!
