This is a great recipe that's easy to make. I would suggest using frozen hashbrown-potatoes, a bit easier to cook and tastes like a breakfast meal. Definately going to make this again.

I had regular diced potatoes without peppers/onions so I had to chop those up separately & add them. My family scarfed it up. Minimal effort resulting in a tasty dinner deserves 5 stars. I'm certain mine was done in just under 30 minutes start to finish.

This was a quick and simple meal that tasted great! I didn't make any changes to it.
