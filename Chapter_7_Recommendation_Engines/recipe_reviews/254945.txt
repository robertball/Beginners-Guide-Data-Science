My Mother and I absolutely LOVED this simple soup... My Mother really likes soup, so I thought that I'd try this for her. I had fun making this soup, and tasted AMAZING afterwards. The one thing I noted though, was that after scraping the corn cobs down, it got VERY messy... But I still loved it! Definitely a recommended recipe!

I did not read other reviews which is unusual for me... But this recipe was close to home to what i grew up with... This is a recipe that tastes like corn on the cob...  My family loved as did I... I used 4 ears of corn to get the requisite 3 cups packed...

The timings for cooking need to be followed...

I liked it! Tasted creamy without the cream. I used a vitamix blender to blend 1/2 the corn and water. Used fresh white sweet corn and 1/2 the salt, what a treat!

Definitely not one of Chef John's best recipes. No texture. No flavour. Like pablum. There are way better corn soup recipes on this website. Don't waste your time on this one. But having said that, I do love Chef John's other recipes so he should be forgiven for this turkey

This soup delivers on fresh corn flavor, but my family found the texture a bit off. Even after blending the corn mixture for 2 minutes, it seemed to be very smooth, but as we later realized, there were very small pieces of corn throughout the soup, which gave this an odd mouthfeel. Next time, after we pur√©e the first corn mixture, we will strain it to give this soup better texture. Other than that, great soup!
