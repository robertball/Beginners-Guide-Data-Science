This sauce was amazing. I only used half a teaspoon of sriracha but it was so good. Would probably add loosely crushed peanuts next time for texture. 
I didn't have brown rice so I mixed in rice vermicelli instead. 

With the sauce as a base, many different veggies would work - green peppers, zuchinni, those baby corn things, water chestnuts. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious sauce! Tip: microwave sauce for 20-30 seconds before whisking to melt peanut butter for easier mixing. Added a bunch of extra veggies since we had to use them before they went bad (bell peppers, broccoli, onion) and cooked jasmine rice to go with it... sauce was (again!) delicious.

This was delicious. I’ll definitely be making it again. My only comment would be to cook the tofu in a separate pan there was just not enough room and I ended up overcooking the vegetables.

This is AMAZING!!!! My first comment on this site because I’m so happy with how this turned out. I don’t like carrots or tofu so  I just added broccoli and omitted those two. Wow this will be one of my go tos!! Thank you!!

So Amazing!! This dish was full of great flavors, pretty easy to make, and worked well over the brown rice. I'd highly recommend that anyone who likes a good peanut sauce give this a try.

Wife and I liked it. I’m a “Lively” food eater meaning I like vibrant tastes to jump out at me. This was very mellow hence the 4 stars. We did add more soy sauce on the leftovers and which livened it up. Will make it again.

This is a lovely recipe. I wanted the sauce to be thicker and more flavorful, so I doubled the peanut butter, lime, and ginger. Next time I will add diced potatoes, simmered green onions, and smashed peanut chunks. Very nice dish!!  Oh and I couldn’t wait to eat it, so the photo has a nice big chunk missing.

After making this I'm still not a fan of tofu. the mixture is well put together and tasty, I just can't get behind the tofu. I will end up making this recipe again perhaps I will use tempeh instead.

I’ve made the recipe twice. Both times it turned out great but I noticed some differences each time. The first time I used full fat coconut milk. The second, I used reduced fat or lite as directed. For some reason, I can’t get the sauce ingredients to blend well when I used reduced fat coconut milk so I’ll be sticking with full fat. Other than that, I wouldn’t change a thing about the recipe. It’s really good.

Not a vegan so I substituted flank steak  (cubed) for the tofu and I also added some habanero and serrano peppers to pump up the heat.  Delicious.

I’m giving it five stars, but I admit I made a mistake making it, so I definitely didn’t follow the recipe. The problem was that after tasting it, I wanted it significantly spicier, so I added a lot more sriracha, which left a strange aftertaste; to fix that I ended up adding half again of everything else except the coconut milk, and some extra red pepper for spice. It turned out pretty good then. I also baked my tofu and added it at the last minute, and for the stir fry I used the veggies I had on hand.

Tasty.  It was good with Quora chickenless strips.  But, I did forget the spinach, which would have soaked up more sauce.

This is an excellent sauce recipe!   It's now part of our regular rotation .  Only change I make it using full fat coconut milk, and we make it a little spicier.  The stir fry vegetable mix was not, however, our favorite, and we generally switch that up.

My daughter is vegetarian bordering on vegan, but the rest of my family is not so I am always looking for recipes that will satisfy everyone...and with an athlete husband and two other teenage boys it is not easy.
I made this exactly as written and it got rave reviews from everyone. Some weren't thrilled by the tofu's texture but I used a medium firm so next time I will try extra firm. 
Also I think next time i can make the  base and then add tofu to some for my daughter and stir fried chicken for the boys.
The sauce was a little runnier than some other recipes i have tried but I quite liked it. Really nice flavor and we aren't usually fans of peanut butter based dishes.
Note: I put the tofu between two dinner plates as suggested by another to drain it. You will need paper towels to soak up the excess!

Excellent.  Added more veggies, more tofu, less spice.     I also used soy milk in lieu of coconut milk.  because I am not good with spices, the dish was very mild -- and I like it that way.  I will make again and I will experiment more with the curry.

This was delicious! I used date sugar instead of brown sugar to make it a little healthier. I also used 4 carrots instead of 2, and substituted kale for spinach because we didn't have any spinach. Lastly, I used sesame oil instead of olive oil to give it more of an Asian flavor. It was so good! I will say, the pepper (we used cayenne) was a bit strong for the kids. I would probably leave that out next time and only add it to my own.

This was incredibly good.  My ten year old wasn’t sure when she saw what I made for lunch but after tasted it, she said, “it was a lot better than I thought it would be”.  That’s a pretty good review from a kid. ;). I, personally, loved it.

Great recipe! Thank you! I browned the tofu cubes first to avoid breaking them in the sturdier vegetables.  I also added bok choy and onions because I like them.

Added chopped cilantro and served over zucchini noodles or zoodles instead of to rice.  Pretty tasty

Used Sunflower Butter instead of Peanut Butter as my stepson has a peanut allergy, and it turned out great! Everyone loved it!

Delicious! Was a big hit. Use more srirracha sauce if you want it spicy. I drained the tofu in the fridge using paper towel and pressed between 2 plates. That method worked well.
