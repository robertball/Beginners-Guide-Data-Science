Original review -12/11/2009 Thanks for sharing, Susmita, we were very impressed. This dish reminds me of the delicious potato dish or curry I`ve tried in my local Indian restaurant. But this was even better. I didn`t have fennel seeds and asafoetida, so I omitted them. Very delicious. ***UPDATE*** 26/04/2011 I just want to add that this dish is a staple in my house, I make it almost every two weeks. I think this is the best way to prepare potatoes so far.

Delicious and authentic! I like my shak super-spicy so I also added some diced green chilies I had on hand.  Thanks!

I adore this dish!  My kids are split - one likes it and the other won't touch it.  More for me then!  I've made it with and without the asofiteda powder, depending on whether I've made a recent trip to my Indian grocer.  I've also added nigella seeds, and I like them very much with the mustard seeds and potato.  It may not be an authentic addition, but I like the onion-like flavor they add. Thank you for posting this.

This turned out really good. It is quite spicy to me. I don't think I will be giving it to my kids. But, mine and my hubby's nasal passages should be well opened after dinner tonight! :) Will make again.

I was missing the Indian restaurant near where I used to work in Northern Virginia and went looking for recipes to recreate the Batata Nu Shaak they served. I happened upon this one and, noting it originated with a Gujarati mama, I decided to give it a whirl. Wow! I made this for dinner tonight and boy, am I glad I did. Curry is one of my favorite smells and just sauteing the herbs and spices for this made me hungry! The recipe was very straight forward--I didn't have a few of the spices, I'd run out--and the dish still came out excellently. The potatoes are perfectly cooked, the gravy is warm, spicy and earthy, and, served over fragrant rice, it is to die for. My kids ate every  last bite (even the picky one) and even the dog wanted some. (I didn't give him any as I hadn't checked the spice list fully). What's the best part? It took just a few minutes to prep and while it cooked, the rice steamed in our rice cooker. Everything was done at the exact same time, to perfection. I will definitely be making this again for many, many years to come--especially on rainy or cold evenings when a quick, warm, filling meal is in order.

Hi! I really like this recipe. The things I experienced while making/preparing everything, is that it takes quite some time. It took me I think like an hour and a half to do it all. What takes a bit, is grating the fresh ginger, and cutting the veggies. I cooked the fennel, cumin and mustard seeds, crushed red pepper in organic ghee this time instead of oil. And my hubby liked it better and could taste the difference!  I usually cook the seeds in olive oil. I also want to note that when I put the ginger, onions and tumeric in, it not only burns my eyes a little, but really burns my throat and makes me cough, gag. I basically cant breathe its so spicy/hot that I have to turn on my exhaust fan, open my windows. I even tried to boot my dogs out the door for fear it would hurt their throats too. I believe it's the ginger that is doing this. Just warning others, to ventilate before u start this part, lol. ??????.  When I didn't add anything extra than what was asked for in the recipe, I thought it needed more flavor or substance. So I added tomato sauce  (speghetti ) and peas. So that way it's not as dry like. Once I do this, it tastes so much better and delicious!! I am going to maybe add chick peas next time or some other Indian veggie. U know, experiment!!! Or maybe add some paneer!  Of course we eat this with white rice and sometimes put some in a small flour tortilla.
