Not bad for a quick and easy breakfast! I cut way back on the servings because I only needed two of these. Instead of opening up a whole can of beans I just used some breakfast sausage instead and left some homemade salsa on the side for dipping.

Very good and EASY.  I substituted Northern White. Also I used flour tortillas because I didn't have corn ones. I think the corn tortillas would not be pliable enough. They always break when I roll them. Use flour tortillas if you have the same problem. 
I put the salsa on the side and also a dab of sour cream and topped it off with fresh cilantro. It was good.  I can't want to use the do-ahead feature of this recipe.

These were great - thanks for the recipe, Frank!!  Made some with salsa and some without and they were all great.  Also, I used a splash of hot sauce with my eggs and used black beans flavored with cumin and chili spices.  Yum!

Pretty good! I used black beans that were already spiced with chili and cumin. Yum! I left out the salsa because I don't like the wateriness merging with the eggs and I think it makes the tortilla soggy. We liked it, though!

I had to scale the servings down dramatically since this was meant to feed only one.  I really enjoy beans in my breakfast burritos...I don't know if it's just me or if it's a southern thing.  I didn't think the salsa added a whole lot of flavor so would opt for leaving that out next time around.  Maybe some bacon or sausage would be a good addition as well.  Thanks for sharing.

I made these both ways, but I personally like putting the salsa, cheese, and beans in the scrambled egg mixture with a small amount of diluted sour cream. I heat everything up in the same pan and they turn out great! Too be extra healthy, I sometimes use only egg whites and low fat cheese on a whole wheat tortilla.  Perfect match with a full bodied coffee!

very good.  I cooked garlic, onions and hashbrowns with butter salt and pepper and scrambled my eggs into that for the burrito to add flavor and texture.

I like this recipe, although my husband likes meat with every meal.  So instead of beans, I cook about 3-4 slices of roll sausage sprinkled with a little taco seasoning; drain on paper towels and crumble.  Then return to skillet and pour 3 eggs mixed a little milk on top. Cook until eggs are light and fluffy. Then spread in 3 small or 2 large tortillas with salsa or taco sauce and cheese.  Got to admit, it's sooo good.

I made these for my grownup breakfast because I didn't want fruit and peanut butter dip. 

I omitted the beans (I didn't have any)
and I used super-death hot salsa and chipotle cheddar. Really filling. 

Num.

Very good and very quick!  Added the cumin and chili powder to the beans as someone else suggested and used a very hot salsa with a kick.  Also didn't have shredded chedder cheese so melted kraft singles on top.

These were ok.  They were easy to make, but I did not like the flavor.  I also used 8-inch tortillas instead of 10-inch, and even the 8-inch weren't too stuffed--so I don't think this would make enough for 8 10-inch burritos.

Tasteless and like someone else mentioned, lacks texture.  All the ingredients I love but won't make this again.

Very good -- and super easy.  I didn't use a whole jar of salsa -- only about 4 tablespoons.  It was delicious and made a quick and easy dinner on a night I had nothing planned.

These were awsome, but I made  some changes. I browned some spicy sausage then followed the recipe the rest of the way. Love it with my homemade chili- (salsa) will make again and again.

Very good but messy. I used pinto beans instead because I prefer them to black beans. I did add some onion powder and a sprinkle of salt to the eggs. I only used about 1/4 c of salsa not the whole jar called for. I guess I make mine small as I got two breakfast tacos per egg instead of only 1. My tortillas were taquito sized.

This was fairly easy to make and decent stuff, but it just wasn't that exciting.  I've made it twice now, so it's not like I dislike it, but I made it twice cause I had left over black beans and it's easy.  Just needed something, and the suggestion for adding bacon or sausage is a good one.  Bacon would give these the good kick they need, although it would just make them more fattening.

This was a great recipe! I made it for my boyfriend and his roommates and they ate all of it an asked for more. I experimented with the salsa, trying new flavors like 'corn and bean,' 'pineapple,' and 'peach mango.' It's all gone and they loved it. :o)
THANKS!!

5 stars with some changes. I used 8" tortillas & dry beans as that's what I had on hand. I HATE beans, but found these to be delicious once I added some ground black pepper and chili powder!

Super easy and simple to modify to your tastes.  These cook up fast and are very tasty.  Many times I forgot I made them, then I see a bag of burritos in the freezer and get excited :0)

Great combination, very filling and very adaptable. Can't believe I had never thought of this myself! I substituted a can of refried beans, spiced up with chili powder and onion powder, and I put the salsa directly in the scrambled egg. Good for any meal of the day :)

I usually add bacon; two strips per burrito.  After they are rolled I place them in a George Foreman grill for three or four minutes to crisp up the burrito; delicious.

I substituted bacon for the oil. I combined everything, cooking the bacon first, then eggs, and then combined everything else to speed up the rolling process. I made a huge batch. Mornings will be good around here for a while!

We thought these were good.  I doubled up the recipe because I wanted to freeze some.  I added breakfast sausage because we thought it would taste good.  I wouldn't do this again.  My tortillas were flour because I thought that's what it called for.  I would use them again as they  hold up better than corn.  The tortillas were too small - I got the ones for tacos, which resulted in tiny burritos.  Next time I will use the larger ones.  To cut corners I mixed the cheese and salsa.  I wouldn't do that again because the cheese didn't melt well.  In all, follow the recipe as written and you'll end up with a good, quick breakfast.
