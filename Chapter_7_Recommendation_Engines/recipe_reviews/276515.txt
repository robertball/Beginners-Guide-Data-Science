I liked these - I'm always looking for more natural sweetened treats to avoid white sugar and these definitely fit in that category. When I tasted the batter, the maple syrup and banana flavors were very strong, so I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and about 10 drops of Sweetleaf Sweet Drops Vanilla stevia sweetener drops & skipped the cacao nibs (which I didn't have on hand), otherwise made as directed. You could easily substitute other milks for the coconut milk if you don’t keep that on hand and do not need them to be vegan. The maple syrup and banana flavor was much more prominent right after I made them last night – it mellowed by this morning to be more subtle and actually tasted better. One other note is that you can move the syrup to be mixed in with the liquid ingredients - it's place in the recipe is probably from an original sugar ingredient being mixed with other dry ingredients. Since it was swapped for a liquid sweetener, I would just mix it in with the other "wet" ingredients instead. Thanks for contributing a healthier and gluten free version of a classic dessert!
