This is a great recipe for someone who is short on time or just doesn't want to spend hours in the kitchen!  I have made this recipe with both zesty italian mix and regular italian mix, they are both great!  It took about 45 minutes in my gas oven for the size chicken breasts I used.  I believe the butter could be cut down quite a bit for someone who would like to watch their fat intake, but I'm a butter lover so I'm all in!!

Super easy to put together and so full of flavor. My husband and my 4-year-old twins devoured it. I only changed a few things: I didn't use canned green beans, I used frozen whole green beans; I used a homemade Italian dressing seasoning that I found on Allrecipes; I didn't use butter, just sprayed the pan with butter-flavored non-stick spray and lightly sprayed the top of everything once I added the seasoning.  The chicken was tender, and the green beans & potatoes were cooked perfectly. It came out so yummy!

I cooked mine at 325 so that I could cook it longer and I'd have time to take a kid soccer practice and come back an hour and a half later.  Forgot the Italian until just before serving but it was great!  Wish I had made more.  Super quick and easy.  My family usually doesn't like potatoes but they said these had lots of flavor and loved them.  Thanks!

I wasn't impressed.  The vegetables that were down in the butter were well-cooked, but the ones on top weren't.  The chicken was fine, but the vegetables needed something different.  I ended up putting salt and pepper on my potatoes at the table.  I don't think I'll try this again.

I will definitely make this again.  However, I substituted sweet potatoes for the red potatoes (I did not have red potatoes) and I added another pack of Italian dressing mix.  Even by adding the additional packet of dressing, the flavor was not overpowering.  The sweet potatoes also turned out perfect!  I peeled and cut them into cubes.  This was a delicious meal with a very short prep time.  This recipe has earned a place in my favorites.

Super easy--Chicken came out juicy, and it was nice to have the whole dinner done in one pan. We thought the flavors could be improved though--it was rather bland. Mainly it is the method of cooking that is really effective--you can change the seasonings and the types of vegetables to suit your taste. Next time I will salt and pepper the raw chicken before baking-- the chicken really needs the seasoning. I'll also use a more flavorful butter mixture--I plan on making a garlic herb butter with lemon. We used one pound of fresh green beans (cut and trimmed) this time, and they were nicely cooked--this cooking method produces a soft green bean, which I'm fine with. Next time we'll try adding fresh mushrooms or carrots. I also cut the potatoes up into bite-sized pieces and nuked them in a glass bowl covered by a plate for a few minutes before adding them to the 13x9 inch pan (to give the potatoes a head start in cooking). It worked. The potatoes were perfectly done when the chicken and green beans were ready. I baked for exactly 1 hour .

Very easy and delicious! I prefer to use baby red potatoes and surprisingly, the canned green beans are perfect.  Oven ready in 45 - 50 minutes.

The change I made was to use legs and thighs, as I don't like the breast meat. And, I used fresh green beans, no canned veggies here! It was very tasty. Since I was making a smaller amount, just for the 2 of us, I didn't use the whole packet of salad dressing mix. Probably will next time, it need just a little more flavor. And, I always use salt, pepper, and granulated garlic on all meat that I cook. My husband loved it!

I am usually one to follow the recipe exactly as listed before reviewing, but the amount of butter in this original recipe is just obscene. I used less than half and it came out great. This recipe could easily be elaborated on or changed to suit preferences

Wonderful recipe. Very easy, simple and inexpensive to make. I’ve made it several times. I always cut the butter in half, add a little chicken broth, a little minced garlic plus salt and pepper for added flavor. I also microwave the cut potatoes for about 4 minutes to give them a head start. Turns out great every time. It’s one of our favorites.

Mine and my wife's favorite meal.
Excellent recipe as written.  Thanks for sharing.

BUT: as there are just the two of us there were leftovers.  Fixed that by scaling back to 8x8 baking dish but retained the entire pkg dressing mix and stick of butter.  WOW what a flavor kick.
Fills two stomachs and no leftovers.  Have made with cut green beans, fresh beans, frozen broccoli (smothered with a packet of Velveeta cheese from dollar general after cooking), added little cabbage, added little celery - ALL GOOD

Easy, easy! I love it and it has become a regular in my recipe repertoire. I use russet potatoes, peeled and cut up. I micro those a bit to ensure they got done.

Wayyyy too much butter in this recipe. I will probably substitute with olive oil next time so it's a little healthier.

Quick and easy--a lot of butter more than necessary but tasty. I just used whatever veggies I had on hand to use up. Tonight it was heirloom cherry tomatoes, asparagus, zuccini and taters. Would prob work fine with olive oil or a mix.

I've made this several times! I used thawed Italian green beans. I doubled the butter, melted it & added the seasoning to the melted butter. Then I poured it over everything & slightly tossed each item separately. I covered & baked it for 90 minutes.

I used extra spices and still found the dish to be bland. After cooking for an hour and 10 mins, neither the potatoes nor the green beans were done. And the butter gave the whole thing a sortof globular, entirely unappealing, consistency.

I've been too nervous about finding new recipes. I knew my family was getting bored of the meals I've been making so I found this recipe. It's a great recipe but the only reason I put 4 stars is because the amount of butter. That was way too much butter. Next time I make it I will use half or less than half to pour on the food. It was good besides the butter.

Very easy and quick tasted great i used asparagus also. And added some different spices and seasoning. I believe fresh green beans would also be better!

I've seen these one pan chicken things on the internet a lot lately and I decided to make this one tonight. It doesn't take  long to prep for which is important to me as I'm almost 6 months pregnant and already spent all day on my feet. I made some changes though, like instead of chicken breasts I used chicken thighs, which I seasoned with garlic powder, black pepper, and lemon pepper, rather than zesty italian. My fiance and I are HUGE fans of seasonings and flavor so that added quite a lot I think, also I've read that thighs are more flavorful than breasts so I think that's a good alternate to the breasts for those who say it was too bland.  For the potatoes I covered them in melted butter then garlic powder and black pepper (we use a lot of both in our meals). At about 30-35 minutes I stirred up the green beans and potatoes so they cooked evenly.  The butter kept everything so beautifully moist and flavorful, I always have a hard time with baked chicken, mine is always too dry, but this is my new go to recipe.

I love this recipe!  Very simple and can be made in advance (I put mine together about 4 hrs prior to dinner).  I did add salt, pepper and a little garlic because I did not have the Zesty seasoning and did not use the entire packet of dressing (just seemed like a lot of seasoning).  This will be a go to recipe for me!

I made a few changes, instead of using dressing, I used lemon juice, some garlic, added some carrots and slices of onion here and there and it was wonderful. Terrifically easy, doesn't take up a lot of time, I love this recipe!

The chicken tasted like boiled chicken and the vegetables were watery and bland. I do htink it might cook better uncovered.

Used frozen grn beans, yellow potatoes skinned and cubed, Italian dressing (not the mix; used about a 1/4 cup. 3 big, boneless, skinless breasts. My 9x13 didn't fit everything, so I went next size up. The pan takes up the size of 2 burners length and width

So quick and easy to put together, and full of flavor. I had to cook it longer, about an hour and a half, but the chicken breasts were pretty thick. I followed the recipe exactly, but can see how it could be very versatile.
