This is beyond awesome. I didn't have clam juice as Cindy recommended to cook the potatoes in, but I did have chicken broth. I had about four large celery ribs that needed to be used, so I just chopped it up along with the carrots and threw them in the bacon fat with the potatoes. (I had to add just a little more previously reserved bacon fat to the pan, only because there was more veg. I know I'm not the only one who saves bacon fat in the fridge!) I followed the recipe exact. I'm the only one who loves clam chowder in this house, which is fine with me. I'm NOT SHARING. I ate two bowls with homemade ranch oyster crackers. I feel better already! NOTE: Next time, I'll be sure to cook the potatoes with the clam juice. Good tip.

Yummm, I love this!  Instead of cooking the potatoes in the water I use 2 bottles of clam juice.  Makes it more clammy.  I had submitted this about 7 years ago and I've changed it a bit since then.  Still using the Knoor Brand Leek Soup mix.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  Here's why:  First, it's SUPER easy to put together.  Second, it's MUCH less expensive than buying the *gasp!* canned stuff.  And third, EVEN I LIKED IT!!  I should mention that I really don't like clam chowder at all, but of course the only stuff I've ever tasted was the canned stuff *gasp again!*  My kids love clam chowder and fight each other for it if there's not enough to share, so I made this for them.  As recommended, I used two bottles of clam juice instead of water to boil the potatoes and carrots in.  I had promised the recipe's author on the Recipe Exchange that I would at least TASTE the soup and boy am I glad I did!!  The kids almost had to fight ME for this.  We'll definitely be having this soup again many, many times.  Thanks for making me a clam chowder lover, Cindy!!

I will elaborate, but I think Hubs' remark as he ate his first spoonful says it all.  "This is really good," he said.  "Much better than most of the stuff I get at restaurants.  Make it again."  How's THAT for a compliment?  I stuck pretty closely to the recipe, but I did substitute celery for the carrots (icky-I don't like them), and added some finely chopped onion.  I also covered the potatoes with bottled clam juice (one 8-0z bottle for a half recipe)  rather than water, which I think contributed significantly to its full flavor.  I did find then, that I didn't need quite the full amount of half-and-half to achieve the right level of thickness.  I didn't add salt to the soup, thinking there might just be enough in the leek soup mix, which proved to be the case.  This is rich, full-flavored and satisfying in every way. We cleaned up every drop.

This chowder definitely lives up to it's name! It is not too milky, or too clammy, it's just right! Very hearty and easy soup to make. I used chicken broth in place of water to cover my potatoes, may try using extra clam juice next time. I also added in an onion with the potato and carrot, just because I had one and I felt like it should be in there . I did only use one package of the leek soup mix merely because I am a dork and only grabbed one at the store. I think one did the soup just fine though : )  Served it up in some sourdough breadbowls (wish I could have made those too!) and it was to die for! My man couldn't stop saying how good it was, best we've ever had. Thanks for the awesome recipe Cindy!

This is a savoury chowder. I followed the directions exactly as written by Cindy. (I did buy minced clams by mistake but I actually like the smaller pieces).Even if you do not like clam chowder I think you would like this one, it does not taste clamy at all. I made it in the morning, planning on reheating it for dinner in a double boiler but it was so flavoursome I ended up eating a bowl for breakfast. Served with oyster crackers one night and Cheddar Bay Biscuits the next night. Will with out a doubt be making this all winter long. Awesome recipe Cindy, thank you

Very easy and very tasty! I followed the recipe as written, using fat free half and half.  I did add about a teaspoon of thyme because I think it adds a richness to the clam flavor.  I served this with homemade Caraway Rye from this site and a green salad.  Turned a gloomy wet day right around.  Thanks Cindy, this is a keeper.

Holy guacamole, my craving has been quenched! This chowder was just Terrific! I did add chopped onion. That was only thing I changed. Very flavorful, the ff half and half was just the ticket, save some calories but did not sacrifice the flavor. My kind of chowder! I served it with sour dough bread. Thanks for this delish dish Cindy!!

This was great!  We had this today with Cheddar Bay Biscuits for a simple Christmas Eve dinner.  I personally would not take the suggestion of others to use additional clam juice for the potatoes--the soup tasted plenty clammy as it was.  Thanks for sharing--another favorite in our house.

This is OMG good !!! Followed the recipe, using clam juice instead of water for the potatoes. Only change made is my method of cooking. I don't have a stove, so I made it in my electric pressure cooker, set to brown. Thanks so much for sharing this one, Cindy !!!!  My new clam chowder recipe, for sure !!! :)

Where was the clam taste????  The soup was decent for a cream of potato soup but I have another great recipe for that!  Very disappointing.  I followed the exact recipe and thought I must have done something wrong but I didn't...

Just made this chowder - AWESOME! Made it exactly as directed. Might add another can of clams next time. Used Fat Free Half & Half (creamy and no loss of taste). Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Outrageously delicious soup!  I didn't make the bread bowls.  The soup stands alone. (We probably couldn't have refilled the bread enough times anyway!)  GREAT recipe, Cindy.

After reading all of the great reviews, I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  It is way too heavy on the potatoes and too light on clams for our taste.  I only used 2 1/2 potatoes, and it was still too much.  However, I think the base for the chowder is very good.  Next time, I'll use a bit less potatoes and at least one more can of clams.  Using fat free half and half did not detract from the flavor and richness of the soup, so don't be afraid to try that!  With some tweaking, I'm sure I'll try this chowder again.

Great chowder and so easy.  I did follow Cindy's recommendation and used 2 bottles of clam juice to cook the potatoes and carrots.  Loved this recipe....thanks Cindy!

One more thing, I used only 3 potatoes and diced them into fairly small cubes and I will probably use another can or two of clams.

Just Awesome Cindy!!   Loved this recipe...made a few changes...I used turkey bacon, and fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  I also added chopped celery and vidalia onion.... used all clam juice and no water to cover all the veggies and potatoes. A touch of dried thyme added a lot of flavor too. A great and hearty soup....ohhhh I also used 6 cans of clams!!!   Love chunky soups....so I bulked this up with extra veggies and way more clams. Will make again. Thanks!!

Good stuff. I might try to tweak it a little bit. It tasted a bit too salty to me. Beside that it was delicious.

This was awesome!!! My husband being from Florida said it was the best he's ever eaten and he is a picky eater. I could not find the leek pkg's so I used a large box of potato soup with leek and only 1/2 of the half and half. I am making it again tonight.

My boyfriend and I absolutely love this.  The first time, it was too salty when I made it.  So this time I added a little extra clam juice and left out the additional salt all together.  The salt from the bacon and Leek soup mix was more than enough.  I added about a tablespoon of pepper though and it was perfect.  Served with Italian bread for dipping.  My boyfriend asked me to put in extra bacon next time, and I will be adding celery as welll to make it thicker.

Didn't taste very clammy, even with the addition of clam juice. The five potatoes called for were way too many. This turned out more like a potato/bacon chowder. It was still good- just didn't taste like clam chowder. Omitted the carrots. Took 90 minutes to prepare and cook.

Awesome is the right description!! I couldn't find the dry Leek soup in our town but used dry Vegetable soup instead. I will keep looking for the Leek soup for next time---and there WILL be a next time!  Thanks Cindy

I'm going to rate this before my family even tries it.  Why?  Because I don't CARE what they think!  LoL  It's just perfect, exactly as the recipe is written.  I am so impressed with it that, if my husband and boys don't care for it, I will still be making it for myself.  I was concerned over the amount of clams (too much?), the amount of soup mix (way too much?), and the amount of potatoes (not enough?) but I stuck to the recipe and I'm so glad I did.  Sheer perfection.  Oh, and the Knorr Leek Soup mix came from Meijer!

Really good!  The bread bowl was fun.  My boyfriend made this and we both enjoyed it but did agree that it needed afew more clams, or potatos if you prefer to thicken it up a bit.  Great for a rainy day with a good beer!

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! You nailed this. There is no problem with flavor or thickness when you follow the directions exactly. PLEASSSSE PEOPLE, do not rate this or any other recipe according to calories, wanting it less fattening or what "YOU" deem healthy. I do not know about you but recipes are about "TASTE" not calories!!!! We all have our preferences to taste and you can adjust accordingly.This is her recipe! Leave it alone! Keep on keepin on with your recipes Cindy!!

Absolutely delicious and so tasty! Very easy to make! The hardest part about this recipe was finding the leek soup as it is no longer sold near me. I finally found it 4 hours away when I was bringing my dtr to college, I looked in Wegmans super market  and found some, so I bought 4 packets and made the soup twice. I also used clam juice to cook the potatoes in, just all in all a tasty soup that we all loved.  I knew I wouldn't be disappointed once I found the leek soup mix. Thanks so much for sharing, Cindy! Will be making more of this!

Wow Cindy, this recipe was awesome. I really enjoyed it and the only change I made was to use evaporated milk instead of half-n-half. And I used cut up razor clams. Very good should be able to give this one more stars! Good job and thanks.

This clam chowder has become a hit with the entire family.My ("picky eater") 8 year old grandson tried eating some but only after I bribed him. Now he wants to come over for dinner whenever I make this clam chowder.

This soup is delightful!  Liked everything about it.  The veggies and bacon are a wonderful part of the soup. It is the perfect creaminess.  I read a lot of the reviews, including Cindy's, and did the following:  Added 2 stalks of celery, 1 extra can of clams, and used 2 bottles of clam juice to cook the potatoes, celery, and carrots in.   Thanks for sharing, Cindy!

So amazing! For myself I would leave out some bacon, but everyone else love love loved it. This was the first course for my Thanksgiving feast, and the only thing I changed was the soup mix. I couldn't find leek, I used a pack of Vegetable Side Mix and a pack of onion soup mix. So easy and delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

Not "clammy" enough for me although everyone else loved it.  I made it exactly as written except omitted the carrots--in my mind carrots do not belong in clam chowder.  Does not need any additional salt.  And for some reason it was overly sweet; don't know why.  I think I'll add a 3rd can of clams next time and some celery.  UPDATE:  I've made this twice since the original review.  I doubled the clams and sauteed some celery with the potatoes.  First time--still too sweet.  Third time is the charm I guess.  I used regular half & half instead of the non-fat and voila--the sweetness was gone.  Wonderful chowder.

After reading all of the stellar reviews I knew I just had to try this soup, however, after checking out the recipe I was a little taken aback that it included a pre-packaged boxed leek soup mix. If your blood pressure is extremely low or if you're one to pay no mind to sodium, then this recipe is for you. However, I have a problem feeding my family over 1400 mgs. of sodium per serving so my solution was to make a healthy leek soup and then proceed with the recipe. Having eaten lots of New England clam chowder, I found this to be a bit thin so I mashed up a couple more potatoes and added them in. With these changes my gang loved it Cyndi and I thank you for a great starting point!

OMG!!!!!! Mmmm Mmmmm good has NOTHING on this! I followed the rec. but added 1 more can of clams and used celery and onion instead of the carrot. I can't get my husband off of me now. Thanks alot! Really though this is wonderful! About an hour of work total and well worth it. Make sure you use the leek soup mix and not the veg. you won't get these great results if you don't. What other goodies you got up your sleve cindy?!! Thanks!!!!

This was tasty, and certainly easy, but I've made better.  This one just didn't have the taste I associate with clam chowder.  That being said, I think this would make an excellent Ham and Potato soup...sub ham for clams, chicken broth for clam juice, etc.  Thank you very much for the recipe, it was fun trying it out.

This is easily one of the best soups I have ever had! 1 of the top 5. It has so much flavor and is so simple to make that my 13yr old did it by herself. The only change I made was I only had 6 slices of bacon and not 1/2 pound. The combination of leeks, bacon and onions was incredible! This soup is a keeper! Thanks Cindy!!

I had to use vegetable soup mix bc I couldn't find leek soup mix. I had to thicken with cornstarch at the end and I mashed some of the potatoes to help thicken. My secret ingredient is Cajun seasoning and a dash or two of cayenne. Also a splash of red wine vinegar is yummy too.

This is a very hearty chowder, really warms the soul! And Cindy, you're right...the whole family adored it! I would recommend that you don't add any salt...the bacon and the soup mix make it plenty salty, wait until serving to taste test then add salt if needed. I put in one package of soup mix, blended it and added part of the other, I guess about a half, until it tasted right to me. Thank you Cindy for posting this delicious and easy clam chowder!

Excited by all the great reviews, I couldn't wait to try this.  Although it was good, with every mouthful I tasted a "chemical" taste.  Knowing it had to be the dry leek soup mix, I checked its ingredients.  It contains chemicals like sulfites, monosodium glutamate, disodium guanylate and disodium inosinate. Many people have adverse reactions to sulfites and MSG.  As someone who tries to eat a healthy, natural diet and avoid chemicals as much as possible, I will make my clam chowder from scratch and not use this recipe anymore.  Just couldn't get past the underlying chemical taste this had.

Very good, and relatively easy to make.  My wife found the leek taste a little overwhelming.  We resolved that problem by deleting the water in step 2, and using 2 (8 oz.) bottles of clam juice instead.  The taste is then wonderfully balanced.

Red potatoes work best.  Leaving the peel on not only adds to the nutritional value of the chowder, but also adds visual appeal.

The hardest part of this recipe might be simply finding the leek soup mix (knorr brand) - there's really no substitute.

To make this a vegetarian dish, omit the bacon.  Melt 3 TBSP of butter, heat until fragrant, then add the potatoes and carrots .

One of our favorites.  Perfect consistency, easy & delicious.  My husband asks for this every week.  My 16 year old son claims "this is like REAL chowder" (not thick/floury canned stuff).  Thanks so much for sharing!  Would give 10 stars if I could.

I won a cookoff with this recipe and have had hundreds of people ask for the recipe.  I added a couple of things to really spice it up.  Cream cheese and diced jalapenos made this a huge hit.

So yummy! cooked potatoes in clam juice, added celery, used knors leek, and a little less bacon just because I do not love it.

Hi Cindy! I tweeked this for personal preference only. Used 3 regular sized potatoes and 4 rashers of bacon, 1/2 tsp thyme, one envelope of leek soup and 20 oz. 1/2 and 1/2. It's just my husband and me to feed so I scaled your recipe down to fit our needs. Have leftovers for lunch. Excellent! Thank you!

This was really good, if a bit salty for my taste.  The second time I made it, I halved the leek soup mix and added a couple tbsp flour for thickening, and it came out fabulous.  I used turkey bacon in this recipe once, it did NOT work out well, and I won't be doing that again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Cindy, this was wonderful.  I am from a fishing town near Boston, so I just couldn't put the carrotts in....but this was a great, great clam chowder.  (Are you originally from N.E.??  lol)  It is highly unusual for someone to come this close to N.E. clam chowder!!!  Excellent.

Cindy - this truly was Awesome as the title implies.  My family really enjoyed it and all had second helpings.  I was a little uncertain about how many potatoes (mine were rather small, new potatoes).  It was wonderful made exactly as the recipe directs.  Thanks for this one!

Made this to take to the beach for a weekend.  LOVED by all!  Oh...my...God...it is delicious!  I particularly like the velvety-ness of the soup base.  It doesn't 'break' or curdle like some recipes. Ohhhh....I need to make some more....!

Made exactly as written.  Hard to find leek soup, but worth the search. Don't try to substitute.  Soup mix MADE the flavor.  I am not a big fan of clam chowder, but this one changed my mind.  It was beyond AWESOME.  Hubby loved it too.  Next time will double for more leftovers.

My family loved this chowder!  I served it in bread bowls made from the San Francisco Sourdough Bread recipe on this site.  The soup was easy to put together, and oh-so-good!  I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks, Cindy!  It was awesome!

My son's "Culinary Careers" class was assigned to create a restaurant complete with floor plan, decor, theme, menu, etc.  They had to present their restaurant to the class (and some faculty!) including one sample dish from the menu.  This was the sample dish we provided.  I figured that since it was seafood, I might have plenty of leftovers at the end of the day...WRONG!  The slow cooker it put it in to keep warm was practically licked clean!!  I got several requests for the recipe, including from the kids in my son's group that created the restaurant and the culinary careers teacher.  It was super awesome!!

This was very good!  My husband L-O-V-E-D it! I think the proportions were a little off for me - too many potatoes and bacon and not enough clams.  Next time I will only use 4 medium red potatoes, use less bacon and cut it smaller, and add another can of clams.  Knorr Leek Soup Mix is hard to find, but worth it!  The flavor of the broth was sensational!

I tried this chowder the other night and just had to tell you Cindy this is the best chowder I have ever tried.I really don't like clam chowder but this has really changed that...I had to go out the night I made it so I wasn't home when my husband tried it,when I phoned him later he told me it was the best chowder he ever ate,I only used one pkg. of the leek soup mix and the next time I probably won't use as much bacon,but other than that excellent in taste and texture great

Ok, amazingly delicious and simple.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  My husband said it  was possibly the best he ever had and my (8 year old) son had 4th helpings and wants what little remains for breakfast tomorrow.  Thanks Cindy for sharing.

Yummy!  This was my first time making clam chowder and it turned out awesome!  Unfortunately I couldn't find the Leek Soup Mix.  So I added garlic, onions, celery and a bit of cayenne to kick it up a notch and add some extra flavor.  It seemed a bit thin so I added some potato flakes and that thickend it up nicely.  I also used fresh razor clams and bought a bottle of clam juice rather than canned clams.  I will use this recipe agin and try it with the Leek Soup mix next time since I have since found a store that carries it.

It was an easy recipe to make ..a different clam chowder taste but good all the same. I didn't change anything except longer cook time for the carrots to soften. I don't change any recipe on my first try but may add dry onions or fresh scallions next time rather than the soup mixes..two of them were rather overpowering the soft taste of the clams.

It really is awesome clam chowder. I must say though I had a hard time finding the leek mix. I almost used the vegetable soup mix that so many suggested but I just didn't think vegetable soup mix went with clam chowder so at the suggestion of CCL I did a search on the Knorr site and came up with the only grocery store in the area I had not gone to so I get in the car and trek on to the store only to almost be disappointed because all I could see was vegetable mix. I pushed some of the packets over and low and behold there were the only two packets of leek mix in the back so I scoffed them right up and went home and made my soup. I'm so glad cuz I don't think it would have been as good with the veg mix. I used three cans of clams and cooked the potatoes with two bottles of clam juice as well as the juice from the clams as Cindy suggested. I think next time a may use a forth can of chopped clams just because we like it chunkier. SO freakin simple and so freakin good. Awesome job Cindy.

Good soup but didn't taste like clam chowder.  I omitted carrots because I've never had clam chowder with them.  the leek soup just took over on flavor.  Maybe using clam juice to cover the potatoes instead of water will give it more clam flavor.  I tried it but it just isn't for us.

I hesitate to rate this soup because I couldn't find the Leek soup and substituted Knorr's Spring Vegetable medley and don't really know how that altered the taste from the original recipe, but the result was very yummy.  The vegetable medley had leeks in it, but also mushrooms and bell peppers.  As a chowder goes, this one was not overly clammy and so was perfect for the crowd I was feeding because some of them don't really like clams and this was more of a potato soup than a chowder with the soup mix that I used.  I think the recipe would have been equally good if I had put chicken or ham in it.  Super easy, the bacon was a nice touch, and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks Cindy.

This was AWESOME!!!!!! I did use the clam juice as Cindy recommended and used whole baby clams because thats what I had on hand. I served this in bread bowls and it was just fantastic! Even DH ate a bowl and ENJOYED it and he is the "I don't like Clam Chowder" person in my house. I cannot wait to make this again. Thanks for sharing a truly awesome clam chowder recipe with us Cindy!!

I don't eat seafood, but I made this for my husband and he gave it 5 stars for taste.  I give it 5 stars for being so quick and easy.  Thanks Cindy for an awesome recipe!

My family loved this recipe. It tasted more like potato soup than clam chowder maybe it was the bacon. I will definetly make again.

Followed it almost exactly, it was good, and it made a bunch! I cook my bacon on a cookie sheet in the oven so I did that again and just put the potatoes and carrots in clam juice to cook.  I think the only thing that I would try differently next time is not add water to cover the potatoes, but use a bottle of clam juice. I think maybe more clams next time too. Will for sure be using this recipe again.

Wonderful reminder of the chowder my grandma made.  I had trouble finding Leek soup but DH went out of town and made a special trip just to try this.  I will try it with the Vegetable soup next as I think that will work as a sub to the Leek.  Thanks Cindy!

This was very good.  I added salt and pepper while potatoes and carrots were cooking, but this was a little bit too salty.  I would eliminate that step next time.  I am lactose intolerant, so used lactose free milk instead of the half and half.  It was still wonderful.

This was an awesome and easy recipe! Even my boyfriend really liked it, and he actually doesn't really care for clam chowder. The bacon and potatoes add more flavor and heartiness. Thanks Cindy - I live in Pensacola too! The only thing I may try next time is using fresh steamed clams.

It finally got cold on the east coast and this was the perfect soup to make. I took other reviewers advice and cooked the potatoes&carrots in clam juice not only from the cans of clams but also 1 bottle of clam juice. I t was fantastic. I have already shared this recipe with friends and can't recommend it enough.

This was AWESOME.  I am throwing away my old recipe (sorry Grandma) and using this, going forward. It was so quick and easy...loved that I didnt have to make a roux, yet it still thickened really nicely.  Like other people, I added celery, onion and thyme.  I also had some frozen shrimp in my freezer, so I tossed those in as well.  The only thing I would not add is additional salt.  The soup mix was salty enough.  The salt I added (maybe 1 1/2 tsp) pushed it to borderline "too salty"...but still totally edible! Thanks for posting such a keeper, Cindy!

AMAZING clam chowder! Served it to our friends one night and one of them said "Only because of family reasons I cannot say this is the best clam chowder ever" I knew he meant this is the BEST ever! (but I can't say it) :) I highly recommend this soup.

More clams & use all juice...  Add some red or white wine vinegar.  Probably 2 to 4 tablespoons per pot.  Trust me I was skeptical but after reading another recipe from this site I tried the chowder with out the vinegar and it was good.  I added the vinegar and I fell in love.  Now I even add vinegar to Campbells or Pregresso clam chowder.  Try it and you will be hooked.  I have had alot of NE clam chowders in my life...

Delicious!  I used Fat Free 1/2 & 1/2 and was perfect.  Added some celery, onion and fresh garlic for more depth of flavor.  Used white wine in place of water.  Found Knorr Leek soup base at Meijers.  Next time I will thicken with a little flour, we tend to like our soups thicker.  Used Snow's and Bumble Bee clams.  Bumble Bee is much better worth seeking out.  Thank you Cindy

I followed this recipe for the most parts to make my first batch of clam chowder.  I am fairly new to the kitchen and wouldn't even go so far as to call myself any sort of cook BUT my chowder was A-mazing!  This recipe is delicious and easy and it also gives room to let each individual personalize to his/her own liking.

Yum! I tried to combine this recipe with the Newport Clam Chowder recipe, since both were rated so high. I used 4 strips of hickory bacon, 1 onion, 3 ribs of celery, 1 package of leek soup mix (instead of two), and whole milk in place of half and half. I also took the advice to use clam juice in place of water, and since I had some seafood stock on hand, I used only one jar of clam juice with corn starch to thicken instead of flour. Total potatoes used: about 3/4 lb, white and black pepper and salt to taste. So good! The taste definitely improved after letting it set for a few hours. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious!  I was so excited to find leek soup mix just to try this recipe.  The only thing I did different was add a rib of celery and I used frozen hash browns because I didn't have potatoes.  I will make this again, soon!

This was just ok for me. Not great not bad. The leeks from the leek soup stayed tough and was like biting into straw. Maybe I didn't have enough water leftover before adding it? The texture was off for me too. It was kind of grainy. I will look for another clam chowder recipe.

I made this but cut the recipe in half.  I am glad I did because this did not taste like clam chowder. Even tho I cut it in half, I used both cans of clams and juice, but it was more like onion and potatoe soup, noit at all like clam chowder.

I live in a part of the world (Yap, FSM) where I am unable to buy half and half, or even fresh milk. Nor can I buy leek soup mix. The only milk we can buy is UHT (Ultra High Temperature) milk in Tetra Paks. But the recipe sounded so good, I thought I would give it a go... I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. I used celery, onions, fresh garlic, and chicken bouillon cubes to make up for the lack of leek soup mix. I used a bit of flour in the bacon fat to create a roux and aid with the thickening. I was fearful of the strong flavor of the UHT milk, so I used less milk and more water, and added some Italian seasoning, bay leaf and a little freshly ground salt and pepper. The result was a delicious, thick, and creamy clam chowder, as good as any I have tasted in New England. I can only imagine how delicious this would be with real cream!

This is based on hubby's review, as I'm not a clam chowder fan. He really liked it but couldn't taste the clams at all. I just read the reviews & I see many people used clam juice. I'll try that next time-& add more clams! Thanks Cindy!!

This was a wonderful, recipe, and its so easy and versatile you can tweak it with anything you want, I used the clam juice instead of the water for the potatoes but you can easily change out clams for shrimp, crawfish, any type of seafood you want. It got rave reviews when I served it to my family, and even to my in-laws who turn their nose up at almost anything different.

Cindy, I finally made your chowder and it was worth the wait!  I took your advice and used the bottled clam juice and also stayed with  the half & half.  The only changes I made was leaving out the carrot (for hubby) & adding an onion & extra clams.  I used red pototoes (skin on) for color.  I also want to take some space here to thank fellow AR Exchange friend Tizzylizz for mailing the Leek soup to me, so I could make this recipe (thank you so very much)! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Cindy.  I am looking forward to trying more!

My husband loves NewEngland Clam Chowder and I'm always buying it in the cans. Thought I'd make this and WOW! He fell in love with this. He was in his glory when he asked if that was bacon and found out it was. Looks like I'm making Cindy's Awesome Clam Chowder in the near future and beyond. Thanks for sharing Cindy!

The first words out of my Husbands mouth was "this chowder is awesome!" So I do believe it has it's rightful name. It is absolutely delicious, and was very easy to make. I will be making this recipe often. Thank You Cindy for the Awesome Clam Chowder Recipe!

Delicious Chowder!! I was happy with the easy to follow directions and only made a couple of minor adjustments… I did add celery and a 3rd can of clams with juice, otherwise stayed true to the recipe. Now that I know how simple and delicious this is, I will be making it again and again.  Hubby loved it!

Had a disappointing experience at a very good local restaurant with their fish chowder, so decided to try one on my own. So glad I did - this is FANTASTIC!!! As many other reciewers, I cut the half-and-half with 1% milk, and it was still wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe - it will be present at out next dinner party.

I followed Cindy's added recommendation of using 2 bottles clam broth in place of water to cook the potatoes. I also added a bit of thyme as I love the flavor of thyme in my chowder. I live on the Jersey Shore and this by far is one of the BEST clam chowders I have ever had and SO quick and simple to prepare. No more running out to the pricey seafood restaurants to get my fix. My husband is a big coffee drinker so we always have plenty of half and half in house (we use fat free) and I keep all the other ingredients on hand so I can whip this delicious chowder up whenever the whim hits. Thank you Cindy this is a great recipe!

This is my first try at clam chowder and if you use the clam juice instead of water, this stuff is Delicious with a capital D!  Hard to believe something this simple could taste this good!! Note to self: Drain away about a third of the bacon grease after removing bacon, salt potatoes very lightly, no carrots, and use low fat half and half.

Being an elder and lazy, I used prefried and crumbled bacon (SAMs Club) 16 oz sliced carrots from frozen food section and on low card, no potatoes. Added 1 cup diced celery at last few minutes for a mild crunch. This is so good and obviously versatile that next time will sub clams with shrimp...now shrimp bisque or lobster..now lobster bisque.

It was a pretty good soup, my family liked it. It didn't have enough clam taste to me and I added extra can of chopped clams.

Just as the title says this is AWESOME CLAM CHOWDER! I took the advice of Cindy and others and cooked the potatoes (which I peeled due to personal preference) in clam juice instead of water. The only other changes I made were to add in 3 stalks of diced celery with the potaotes and carrots, just because I wanted to, lol, and upped the clams to 3 cans. This soup smelled great while cooking and really tastes amazing! All of the flavors blended perfectly! This is going into the winter soup rotation, for sure~YUM! Thanks for posting/sharing this, Cindy! :)

Absolutly delish! I am giving 4 stars because I thought there could have been more of a clam flavor. I think swapping the water for clam juice would be best. Other than that we loved this recipe. I got mini bread bowls from the bakery and served the soup in them. DH and I both ate a bread bowl and an extra serving!

This is truly AWSOME!! I am not a great cook but this turned out wonderful!!! I am thinking maybe some crab and shrimp next time for a seafood chowder or maybe skip the clams and add chicken wild rice and slivered almonds. It is getting cold here in the midwest perfect weather for soup this is going to be a great recipe to expand on!!!!! Thank you so much for sharing!!!!! 5++ stars

So easy to make and delicious as well.  I left out the carrots, added a chopped shallot and about 4 medium stalks of chopped celery. Used all clam juice to cook the veggies. Family enjoyed. Served with clam cakes.

Wow!  Tasted clam chowder at various restaurants in Boston and this one rates right up there with the best. The only change I made was to use Land of Lakes fat free half and half - just for health reasons. Some of our local grocery stores do not have the potato leak soup and after I tried this soup I knew I needed it -so I went back and bought six of them so I'd have it on hand. Will make again and again! Next time I'm going to add a can of minced clams to get a little more clam flavor - but good as it is!  Also, definitely use red potatoes.

6 stars!  Did the recipe exact.  If you like clam chowder at all, this recipe is easy and more than delicious.  Next time maybe a little less bacon (2 or 3 strips less), and if you REALLY like a lot of clam, add 1 more can of clams.  Thank you for this keeper of a meal.  Searved with sourdough strips.

This has got to be the best clam chowder I ever tasted! Better than most restaurants on Cape Cod - I have paid $20 per quart for clam chowder base from one of those restaurants (to bring home to NY) - never again. I have already made it 3 times since I first tried it a few weeks ago. I am getting ready to make it again - my family can't wait!!

Delicious!  I made this for my husband who loves New England Clam Chowder (I prefer Manhattan Clam Chowder) .  I took Cindy's recommendation and substituted clam juice for the water.  Even I really liked it!  I wasn't sure how many potatoes to use because believe it or not, potatoes are different sizes in different parts of the country plus I didn't know if it mattered what kind of potatoes were used.  I used a combination of red skin and russet potatoes.  Will definitely be making this again.

Thought this was a bit plain tasting. I also used more clam juice instead of water and even added fresh clams and didnt think it tasted much like clam!

Most excellent. Grew up in New Hampshire where clam "chowdah" was everywhere. Nice twist to yours. Read the reviews and altered a little here and there but an excellent soup overall.

Delicious, especially considering how easy. Used Yukon Gold potatoes, and cut back to 3 cups of dairy (1 cup half and half, 2 cups whole milk, not sure I saved many calories...) Used one pack of leek soup mix, that seemed to be enough, and did not need the salt that was called for when you add the potatoes and carrots.

I'll admit that I am not a huge clam chowder fan at all but everyone brags on this and I was anxious to try it. Problem is I had to wait to find the Leek Soup Mix. A wonderful person on the exchange finally gifted me some and so I was finally able to try it. This was perfect for us. It wasn't overly thick (I hate that) and it had the perfect blend of seasonings. I subbed the water for the clam juice as the submitter suggested and we loved it. I do think that if you are the kind that likes biting down into clam with every bite that you might want to add another can of clams but it was perfect for us!  This generous person gifted me with enough Leek Mix that I can make this quite a few more times and I very much look forward to it. Oh, the only thing I changed is that I used already cut up matchstick carrots to save time and then I topped it with extra bacon. Yum! Thanks Cindy for the great recipe and thank you Deb for giving me the opportunity to try it.

Oh boy, this was yummy! I had large bakers and as you know, I asked on RE for help so I ended up using 3 of them instead of 5 regular potatoes. If I had used the fourth, it still would have been fine. I also followed your advice to use the clam juice instead of water. It really was awesome! Thanks, Cindy!

super super good chowder! I followed the directions as is, and although it is super tasty, I think I would like it to be a little bit more "clam-centric" ... perhaps a bottle of clam juice instead of water as other have suggested. Very good eats though!!

I left out the carrots and added an onion and some celery. I used fat free half and half and it was still rich and creamy. I did as other reviewers suggested and used clam juice instead of water. My boyfriend said "It is seriously the best chowder I've ever had. AMAZING!" :)

WOW!!!!! I have HUGE Clam Chowder lovers in my family, and decided I've give this recipe a shot for Valentine's Day. I followed the recipe exactly and I got oooh's and aaah's all throughout dinnertime!! I served it in a Sourdough Bread Bowl and it was phenomenal. Wish I would've remembered to take a picture to add it here. Came out phenomenal. Thank you Cindy for a fantastic recipe that needs no occasion!

Very simple,quick,hearty,and rich clam chowder.It calls for a 1/2 pound of bacon with drippings which I did...next time Im going to a 1/4 pound without the drippings and an extra can of clams. Delicious! Thank you Cindy!

Comfort food at it's finest!  So yummy & creamy & easy & fast!  The only thing I would do next time is to add more clam juice or another can (as was suggested, but, I didn't read until after I made it), but, it was still very good with a subtle clam flavor.

This was awesome.  It was incredibly easy and came out perfect.  I substituted onions for carrots and served it up in sourdough bread bowls. Yum. This will be my go to chowder recipe from now on.

I'm rating this even though I couldn't follow the recipe exactly.  I sent it to a friend who followed it exactly, and they gave it rave reviews as well.   I couldn't find leek soup mix so used one package of Knorr dry veggie soup mix instead.  I also added some diced celery and used fat free half-and-half.  GREAT comfort food for a winter weekend...can't wait to try it again with fresh sourdough bread!

This Clam Chowder was the BEST I'VE EVER HAD. My boyfriend agrees. I put two leek soup packages in it which in total was 144 g instead of 100 g.. (by an accident lol it still tasted good). And I didn't have 946 mL of half half so I used 500 ml half/half and the rest with just milk. I loved the chunky texture and I had to hide it from my BF so he wouldn't eat the leftovers. I served it with garlic bread and it was to DIE FOR! 5 STARS!!!

For some reason, the grocers that I visited did not have leek soup mix. I had to fudge things around but I agree with another reviewer in that there is hardly clam taste in this chowder. It is more like a potato soup with clams.

I made this 2 days in a row! 1st time I followed the recipe to the exact. It was good! But it did not thicken up for me. I think I added way to much water.
But the second day I added a bottle of clam juice and a 3rd can of chopped clams and 1 Tbs. of flour almost at the end of cooking time to thicken. And it came out way better than the 1st time I made it. It was delicious! My husband and daughter had seconds and my husband ate it again for breakfast. He said it was the best Clam Chowder he ever had. This recipe will be part of fave recipe collection and I will be making this for the months and years to come. Thank you so much xo

Absolutely wonderful!  It was easy and it didn't take much time.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the potatoes and carrots in all clam juice instead of adding water.  The only thing I would do differently is add one more can of clams.  Nevertheless I give it five stars,  The leek soup is a must!  I couldn't find it anywhere except Meijer supermarket.

This soup was a huge hit. I also took Cindy's suggestion and made paninis with sourdough, hamd and swiss cheese. Really turned out to be a great dinner. I had to vary the recipe though not by choice. My grocery store didn't cary the leek soup mix so I used fresh leeks, diced and them with the potatoes.

Yum!!!  Perfect for a rainy Dec. night.  My family loved this and it was very easy to make.  The only thing that I would do different next time is find a way to cut the salt.  It was a little to salty and I did not add any.  The is plenty in the bacon and the dry soup mix though.  Also, I thought that it needed more potatoes but that is just because I like my chowder full of chunks of potatoes.  If you really like clams you will definitely want to add more.  Thanks.  We'll do this again and I am looking forward to the leftovers.

We just finished eating our first batch of this and it was truly awesome. I did not have the extra clam juice and the potatoes softened a bit too much, so it tasted more like potato soup than clam chowder. Next time I'll ad more clam and omit the bacon. I used FF half-and-half, like many of the other reviewers.

This was a really easy and simple recipe to follow.  I don't cook too often and my boyfriend wanted clam chowder soup for supper so I used this recipe.  The only thing I changed was instead of using the dry leek soup mix (which I was not able to find after checking two stores), I used baked burgundy french onion soup mix by Cugino's.  I thought the flavor was fantastic.  It added a nice taste of onion.  This is a great recipe! :)

Tripled this recipe as I like to freeze soups and such when I make them. Followed the recipe to a T, except I omitted one pack of soup mix. (Used 5 instead of 6) The consistency of this chowder couldn't be more perfect. Very creamy! I chopped up the 15 potatoes by hand, but have made other recipes with frozen plain hashbrowns, and I might try that next time. Saves time when you need it in a hurry. Did not add any extra salt to this recipe. This one is definitely a keeper!!

I would give this ten stars if I could.  This was absolutely amazing.  I served this at a dinner party the other night and everyone raved and wanted the recipe.  The only changes I made were:  I used only four pieces of bacon, did not use salt or pepper, and used 4 cans of chopped clams.  I had only light cream so I used that, but it is very similar to half and half.  I used the juice from the canned clams to cook the potatoes in, adding a little water to just cover the potatoes.  The soup turned out nice and thick and the flavor, well, I can't find the words right now.  Thanks for this wonderful chowder recipe.

Great chowder!  I only used 5 strips of bacon, mostly fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and instead of water, I used two bottles of clam juice.  Better than most restaurant chowder.

Excellent! The only change I made was to use a pint of half-and-half and a pint of lowfat milk. It still came out thick and creamy, but cut calories. I also used a bit less bacon, since the package was 12 ounces, and i just cut it in half.  I do wish someone would give a weight to the potatoes!

Absolutely delicious!  I cooked the potatoes/carrots in clam juice to make it a bit more clammy.  Next time I will double the clams.  A keeper in my house!

Outstanding.  My family adored this chowder.  We served it in hollowed out sourdough bowls, toasted in a 400 degree oven before pouring the soup in. If you live in Texas, Central Market has the Knorr Leek Soup mix.  Some variants that work really well: 1/2 onion sauteed in the bacon fat, 1/2 cup celery added with the carrots.  A really great soup.

5 stars and then some. The operative word in this recipe is AWESOME!!!! Added a little onion and celery but other than that followed the recipe exactly. My husband and I each had 2 bowls and I served it with crusty Tuscan bread. Totally tubular. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks Cindy for an awesome recipe.

Excellent! Cindy, this chowder had my family chowing down. I added one small onion to the bacon while cooking and also some Old Bay Seasoning for a kick and we were wiping the bowl with some biscuits. :) Thanks for posting.

I've been wanting to try this for ages, but couldn't find leek soup. I've had all of the other ingredients ready to go. I finally found dry potato leek soup and figured that was good enough. It was. Delicious! I added 2 stalks of finely chopped celery, and used 1/2 qt of half-and-half with 1/2 qt of skim milk sicne my tummy can't take all the cream. Thanks for a wonderful soup, I will make it again!

This is AMAZING!! I added a couple stalks of celery and a can of salmon since I only had 1 can of clams. I added a little cayenne too. I only had onion soup mix on hand but I'm anxious to try it with leek mix.

I made this without bacon because we don't eat meat and I made this with one package of leek soup.  I like this adaption because we don't like a lot of salt in our food.  I did cook the potatoes and carrots in clam juice (2 jars with water enough to cover).  I added fake bacon bits on top for a garnish.

This was fantastic! My husband raved about how delicious it tasted.  I must tell the changes I made along with suggestions from others.  I used turkey bacon, added 2 ribs of celery and 1/4 cup of onions with the potatoes and carotts.  I added 1 tsp. of thyme along with the 2 bottles of clam juice and the juice from the canned clams.  Then after adding the leek mixes and the half-n-half I added approx. 4 tsp. of diced pimientos and a handful of chopped fresh parsley.  Thanks for a restaurant quality dish!!

AMAZING!!!! We live in the Pacific Northwest where every restaurant claims to have the 'best' clam chowder. My whole family agrees this was better than our favorite restaurant chowder. Followed the recipe to a T. So easy, so quick and so good! Thanks Cindy!

WOW!  This was absolutely delicious.   Adding the "extra" clam juice would be (in my opinion) too overwhelming, but I took others' advice and used chicken broth instead of water.  Be sure to stir your chowder continuously after adding the half/half until it is hot.  If you are THINKING about making this, DO IT!!!  Just wonderful, Cindy!!

Cindy's Awesome Clam Chowder is exactly that... AWESOME!! My husband and son-in-law are tough critics and both placed this chowder at the top of their lists. Prep was fast and easy, using simple ingredients. I changed nothing in the recipe. This clam chowder has definitely become THIS family's favorite and I will be making it again and again!

Fantastic! Followed the recipe as written and added about 3 Tablespoons of Red Wine Vinegar and some Hot Sauce to give the soup a bit of a kick. The foundation is absolutely perfect! Cindy, your Clam Chowder is Awesome! Thanks for sharing.

I subbed the carrots out and replaced them with some white onion and a couple celery stalks. Turned out amazing (and I tripled the recipe). I also only used half the suggested leek soup mix. Don't forget the hot-sauce garnish!

I made this recipe for a quick Christmas Eve dinner (we have our large meal on Christmas Day).  This was soooo good!  I am pretty sure that I have just started a new Christmas Eve tradition in our house.  I used 1 bottle of clam juice and water to boil the potatoes.  Next time I will probably use 2 bottles of clam juice and another can of clams just to up the clam taste.  I cannot give this recipe enough stars.

This was REALLY good considering I'm not a chowder or potato fan (my husband is)! I took the advice of cooking the potatoes is clam juice vs. water. I also added a shake of cayenne because we love spicy. This was so flavorful and filling. What a beautiful dish for a cold rainy day in March!

I made this last night and we all loved it. I used half clam juice & 1/2 chicken broth, since I had some to use up in my refrigerator. I also used just 3 slices of thick bacon and 2% milk to cut some fat, and a few shakes of Old Bay to season. I think I had to cook it a bit longer to get the creamier soup texture that I like in a chowder, but the wait was worth it. This had great flavor. Thankfully there is still some leftover, because I can't wait to have it for lunch today!

Love this soup ! My family adores it!
Here's my small changes.
1. I used 2 bottles of clam juice instead of water
2. Package of creamy potato soup mix, instead of leek
3. 3 cans of minced clams instead of 2
4. First time I made, I didn't have carrots, so I used celery, and that's just what I use now.
Thanks for my base for this as I think the added soup mix makes for the best chowder ever!

Soup tasted good, but tasted more like a potato soup than a clam chowder. I even added a bottle of clam juice to replace the cooking water for potatoes. Would cut back on amount of potatoes for this.

This soup was good, but being from the northeast i would not call it clam chowder.  The leek soup packets dominate the clam flavor even having used clam juice to cook the veggies.  My family liked this soup its just not the clam chowder recipe we would expect in our region.  I will try a roux based chowder next time

Easy recipe tasted really good, it was well liked. However, I'm going to leave off the potato skins the next time as, it was something I found that I preferred after making the recipe. And I'm more of a person that likes a more intense clam/seafood flavor, so I'll be using seafood stock or more clam juice in place of the water addition in step 2. However, will be on rotation for the family as they liked it very much.

I have been looking for a good recipe for clam chowder and this is it!
It was very easy.  I used russet potatoes and it turned out fine. I did not add any additional clam juice to cover the potatoes. I used water that I had let sit in the clam can until I needed it hoping it would pick up some of the flavor. I found that the longer it simmered to thicken the better the taste.  I will try the extra clam juice but my family and I thought it was really good as is.

Yum! This isn't something I would normally think I would like. But, it was delicious! I sauteed half an onion and some garlic with the potatoes/carrots since I had them ready to use. Leek Soup is getting hard to find so I just used 1 packet of Knorr Vegetable Mix since I had that on hand also. I upped the clam to 3 cans. I didn't feel like I needed the full amount of half-n-half (maybe because I used more clam juice/water). Thanks for sharing this easy to make, delicious, and filling recipe on this cold and windy day!

This was delicious! It was definitely more than 8 servings but it tasted like restaurant quality! If you don't want the flour-like taste, cook your flour mixture well and don't be in a hurry. I knew to do this already because I make flour-based roux for gumbo all the time.

Very very good and couldn't have been easier to make.  I added thyme and a splash or two of white wine and not nearly as many potatoes as the recipe called for (I used two huge baking potatoes).  I also used turkey bacon.  I'm sure it altered the end result somewhat but I try to trim calories and fat where I can.

Awesome recipe, one bottle of clam juice a little water and the juice from 2 cans was plenty to cover veggies.  I added a bit of onion and celery, no other spices are needed.  Too bad the Knorr soup mix has changed over the years, I had an older package and a new package and the old one actually had chunks of leeks.  Also used fat free half and half and finished with a teaspoon of butter.

This was so yummy!!  I had never made clam chowder before this, so I was a little nervous that it would be too clammy or too fishy, but it wasn't - it was delicious!!  The only change I made was I used onion soup mix instead of leek soup mix - I looked everywhere for leek soup mix and I just couldn't find any, so I had no choice.  Otherwise, I stayed true to the recipe and I will make this again, for sure.  Even my kiddos and picky husband said we should have this again - they loved it.  Next time I may try blending it with a hand blender before I add the clams and bacon in so I can "hide" the carrots and potatoes from my kids. It might make it a little thicker too, which would be good.  But this was awesome - thank you!

Oh My! This recipe ROCKS!!!!! Even my chowder-hating husband liked this (and that's saying a LOT!!!). Other than there being too many potatoes for my liking, this was SPOT on. The size of your potatoes really does matter. I used five good-sized potatoes and my soup was VERY chunky! I think using five SMALLISH or three large potatoes is what I'll do next time. As recipe submitter Cindy suggested, I subbed two bottles of clam juice (in addition to the juice from my canned clams) for the water called for and chopped clams instead of minced ones. I also added a large stalk of chopped celery to my soup. Sourdough bread bowls and seasoned oyster crackers made this a truly memorable meal. All I can say is WOW! This is absolutely fantastic and a must repeat at my house! Thanks for sharing your family recipe, Cindy! :-)

I have made this recipe so many times exactly as it was posted and it is absolutely amazing!  My friends that have eaten it at my house have nicknamed it "crack soup", they say after one bite you are addicted!!!  I usually serve it in a bread bowl and there are never any leftovers.  Thanks Cindy!!!

Thought I'd make this soup today, because it's snowing here in MPLS. Yes, it's May 3rd, and yes, it's snowing, grrrr! Anyway, the soup is pretty tasty. I could not find the leek soup mix at my closest grocery store, so I had to sub Knorr Vegetable Soup mix, and I only used 1 packet. I also added 2 stalks of celery in addition to the carrots. I added just enough water to cover the potatoes, but it was a little on the thin side when the soup was done, so next time I will add less. I just simmered it for longer to thicken it up. I decided to make the recipe using the clam juice and water it called for, instead of spending money on extra clam juice and chicken stock, and was glad I did. We thought there was plenty of clam flavor just from the clams and juice they were packed in and plenty of flavor, period!

This was better than most clam chowders I've ordered in restaurants!  I didn't have everything on hand, so I tweaked things a bit.  We had a vegetarian guest over so I ommitted the bacon (I know EVERYTHING is better with bacon, but I thought it tasted pretty darn good without it), and to give it a bit more flavour, I sauteed celery and leeks in olive oil first and then added the potatoes.  I also ommitted the carrots (my husband won't eat cooked carrots in any form).  I only used one leek soup package instead of two, but everything else I followed and it tasted great!

This is the best chowder ever. I do add two bottles clam juice along with two additional cans of clams. A small amout of thyme gives it the taste we get from chowder in Monterey, Ca. it is good made straight from the recipe. Been making it for several years now.

Made this when I got home from work. was simple, easy and soo good the only thing I did was I had forgot to add the leek soup so when I had tasted it I thought it was too bland added butter and then remembered the soup added that and my boyfriend gorged himself on it. It was delish. Absolutely fabulous. It didn't thicken up but I am okay with that I know it was because I added too much water but I loved it as is. Will be making this again. Also I did cook it with clam juice but didn't have enough to cook the potatos in it fully and added water with chicken bullion.

I made this clam chowder.   I took someone else's advice and used bottled clam juice instead of water.  I also used cream instead of milk, along with Yukon Gold Potatoes.

Amazing.  With these ingredients, I think it'd be hard to have it taste bad.  I had undersized cans of clams, so mine wasn't very clam-my, but the bacon taste filled the void.  I used chicken broth to cook the potatoes, which might have made mine a little saltier.  I used celery instead of carrots.  I'd like to try it with whole milk - I don't think it would lose anything, considering how flavorful it is.

This is a great recipe and really easy!  I used pre-cooked bacon and used canola oil and 3tbls of butter to saute the carrots, potatoes, celery and onion (I added two stalks of celery and 1 small minced onion).  My whole family loved it and it made a good sized batch.    Also, I used low fat half and half and nobody could tell the difference!

Excellent and easy!  Next time I'll make the day before so the flavors can meld together better since it tasted even better the second day.  I might add another can of clams as well.  Didn't use the bacon as we don't eat it here, but didn't take away from the great flavor.  Definitely a fall favorite now.

Whole family loved it the first time.  Second time i used bottle of clam juice instead of water for the potatoes, and I used fat free half-and-half which cuts out at least half the fat for a little less guilt.

The Knorr Leek Soup mix is hard to find - I googled and found it at a nearby store I seldom frequent. It is an essential component! Another reviewer suggested adding 1 tsp thyme - if you do so, use 1/2 tsp because it contributes a strong flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Made this and it's awesome, quick and easy. Although I like more of a clam taste, so I am going to make it with double the clams next time, just to try. But overall, this is a fantastic soup.

Delicious!  I used a bottle of clam juice and about an equal part water to cover the potatoes.  Added a rib of finely diced celery.  Also threw in an extra can of clams.  This soup is excellent!

Thanks Cindy just put this together and it's simply amazing..I kind of goofed and only added 500ml if fresh light cream and one package of the leak soup mix..But it is the best clam chowder that I have ever made or tasted..Can't wait for the hubby to get home, he's going to love it with a nice fresh loaf of Portuguese bread...Once again thanks and keep up the good cooking. Maria  ;)

Wow Cindy, I see why you named this Cindy's Awesome Clam Chowder.  It is truly worth 5 stars.  Delish!  I also added celery to the recipe.  Even my daughter who says she does not like clam chowder loved it!  Thanks for sharing this AWESOME recipe with everyone.

This was totally awesome!!!!  My husband and son loved it and ate two big bowls each.  I did not change a thing.  Luckily I have enough left over for lunch today for myself.  Hurry up 12:00!!  Can't thank you enough Cindy.  I'm not sure I would have shared this recipe because it's so good.  Best clam chowder I ever had!

excellent, but tasted more like a potato chowder than a clam chowder, next time I will try adding a third can of chopped clams and/or cut back the leek mix to a bag and a half.

Best clam chowder I ever tasted. I added some onions to it, but that's all I did. Really easy to make. Next time, I will use a 5% cream or maybe less just to make it healthier. But thanks, love it!!!!

This is sooo yummy!!! After making this, I'm never buying clam chowder from the store again. Even my husband (who hates clam chowder) savored every last drop in his bowl. My two-year-old even liked it! I highly recommend this recipe. It's perfect!

This is the BEST clam chowder!  It is so easy to make.  The first time I made as the recipe stated and it was super.  The second time I followed some of the reviews and added extra clam juice and it was fantastic!!!  So much better than the chain restaurant's clam chower!  Thanks Cindy this really is AWESOME clam chowder!!

We like clams so I added 2 extra cans.  Also adding clam juice rather than just water is important if looking for good flavor.  Will also add that we have been going to Maine for 45+ years and this ranks right up there with those great Maine Clam Chowders!

I made this on Christmas Eve, and increased  the serving size to 20.  Everyone loved it!  I used clam juice (Cindy’s recommendation) to boil the red potatoes and carrots.  I increased the clams and bacon.  It was creamy, and delicious!  I had diced the potatoes and carrots, cooked the bacon, removed it , then sautéed the potatoes and carrots for 5 min.  Put them into the refrigerator and went to Xmas Eve mass.  Returned and boiled the potatoes and carrots and finished the recipe!  Will do it again next year.

Delicious, creamy, clam-y. I added the clam juice from canned whole clams & a bit of broth, so the liquid covered the potatoes and carrots to simmer. Only addition: some finely chopped leeks which I slow sautéed in a bit of the bacon grease, then added to the simmering chowder.

I've made this three times in December. One time I had to eliminate the clams for  Christmas Eve.  My family won't eat them. It was still delicious. I put ham in it. This will be my go to for company! ??

Easy and delicious.  I like to use clam juice instead of water to cook the veggies, and double the amount of clams, but it is excellent as written. Thanks Cindy

Used 1 lb. of bacon, removed half the grease. Used 6 potatoes. Used 3 cans of clams and only water from 2. Salt and pepper at each stage as you go. The potatoes absorb it wonderfully.

Hearty and wonderful. This is not something you get out of the can. I made this for me. I will be eating this all week.

I now understand why people say "even if you don't like clam chowder you'll love this recipe". It's because it doesn't taste like clam chowder at all. It's more of a potato soup with clams. The taste was ok,  as a potato soup, that's why I gave it two stars rather than one.  I even used 3 cans of clams/juice and only a 1/2 cup of water to cover the potatoes and it wasn't clam chowdery enough. Not even close. My boyfriend and I both agreed it was ok but not what we expect for a clam chowder. If you like clam chowder this recipe is not for you.

I came across this recipe a few years back and it has been my go to recipe now for anything clam chowder. I double the amount of clams I put in the recipe but other than that it is pretty much the same. I wouldn't change a thing. Hands down the best ever! Thank you for sharing.

I could not find Knorr leek soup  so I used their Spring Vegetable mix (possibly the same thing-different name}. Anyway, this soup was delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Used Peppered Bacon, sautéed carrot and potato in butter, not bacon fat.  Cooked veggies in 2 bottles of Clam Juice.  Drained clams, gave a milk bath, drained again and then soaked in Half & Half, bacon and Old Bay Seasoning.I’d use more clams and add celery if i made it again...it’s pretty rich so i’d likely use less half and half, maybe chicken broth, possibly not sauté in butter.  Maybe try adding fresh parsley.

Delicious by following the recipe, but think next time I'll double the clams, use 3/4 lb or full pound of bacon and one or twp more carrots.  I used all clam juice to cook the potatoes & carrots and will continue to do so.  This is a keeper for New England Clam Chowder!! Thank you!

My family said this is the best clam chowder they have ever had!  I only had 2 cans of clams so I added a can of fancy crab meat.  I also forgot to put the vinegar in.  I’m not sure why it was needed.  I can’t wait to make it again!

Grocery stores used to carry the leek soup and I have looked in every one of them in my area.  I finally found it in a World Market store but I haven't made the soup yet.  Hopes this helps those who have been looking for it. Since I had to put in a star to submit this is the reason for only one star.

Excellent Recipe. It does not need anything extra but I just add celery, carrots and onions to bacon grease for a few minutes before I add potatoes.  Then I boil the potatoes in the clam juice before I add everything else..  My family loves this.  Thank you.

I took the advice of a few other people and added more clam juice. I also used golden onion soup, because none of the stores around here had leek soup mix. It tasted just fine, though.

I liked it but found it a little too basic. So I had fun with it by addind a few additional spices. I added some Cheyenne pepper, sage, celery, chopped up spinach, garlic and onions.
I also added shrimp and crab to the mix. I really liked it and will make it again.

It was pretty good, but next time I think I'd rater add my own onion, and skip on one of the leek soup packages, because I found it too salty.

Delicious but too salty. next time will only use one leek packet as the sodium content is really high with two. Added celery with the carrots and blended some of the potatoes with submersion blender for thicker soup

This is the best clam chowder ever! I used 12 oz of bacon, and many more potatoes since that's kind of the base. Thanks, Cindy! That leek soup is bomb in it.

This the best clam chowder I've ever made.  I never reviewed it before, but this is at least my 4th time making it.  The best way to add the dry leek soup is adding the hot mixture to the soup mix in a separate bowl and whisking it til smooth, then add it back to the soup - no lumps!  I make this at least twice a year since I found it - my daughter's family want me to make it every time I'm there!  Thanks Cindy! Update I've added only 4 potatoes if they were large and 6 if small, also use 3 cans of baby clams.

This sounded so good I decided to make New England style clam chowder for the first time.  I was lucky to finally find the leek soup and also bought a fresh leek to chop up.  I added one celery stalk chopped and a handful of onion flakes.  Decided red potatoes would be a good choice for this and cooked in chicken broth rather than water for more flavor.  Got to admit I ran out of half and half after 2 cups so I added another can of chicken broth.  It thickened up beautifully and I looked forward to having it for dinner last night.  It was wonderful  !  I'm looking forward to leftovers again and again !  I'll make it exactly the same way.....

Agree with most reviews listed, the recipe needs protein fat for flavor.  I also think a quart of half-and-half is too rich.  I plan to adjust my next attempt at this recipe with bacon or sausage fat and to cut the amount of cream by half, adding either low fat milk or water.  I also added clam juice in place of some of the water.

This soup is delicious but it does not have enough clam flavor .  Some of the reviews added clam juice instead of water so that might be the solution. In the future I think I will try a different recipe.

The leek soup mix was nowhere in this town.  I checked 4 stores.  I had to sub veg soup mix by Knorr.  So I don't know how this is supposed to taste.  Used baby clams and added celery, onion and less bacon.  It was good but I'm thinking the leek soup would have been better.  I am rating it on how I made it, sorry.

This clam chowder is absolutely wonderful.  Full of flavor, thick and creamy.  I used the 2 bottles of clam juice in addition to the juice from the canned clams.  The bacon is a must.  Gives it the most wonderful flavor.  When you add the soup mixes and the half and half it thickens as it simmers and you wind up with a thick, creamy chowder.  It's great.  Thank you!

It was delicious, easy to make, and relatively cheap. However, I did find the soup to be too watery so I had to add flour to thicken it (flour in separate bowl with some of the soup, mix well, reincorporate with pot).

This is so good my friends said best they have ever eaten!
I cooked it in the crock pot for the day after I browned the bacon and added celery as most have. I used the clam juice as suggested and let it slow cook. It was wonderful.

This was a fast and delish soup! I hate when people change the recipes but sometimes you have no choice. My changes were; peeled the potatoes (I don't like to eat skin!) added chopped celery, used only 1 1/2 envelopes of leek soup (that's how much I had left from another recipe!) and used 1 cup of cream (out of 1/2 and 1/2).

This is so good!  My husband and I feel this is a great recipe!  Very tasty and I can't imagine not loving this.  I put the dry soup in part of the 1/2&1/2 and mixed it well until it was blended and added it to the mixture without a worry of having lumps.  Also used chicken broth instead of water. So yummy! Than, you!

Really rich and delicious.  Added more bacon and ran out of minced clams so I used some small bay scallops I had in the freezer.  Gave them a quick fry in the bacon grease and added them at the end.  Good substitution.

I've tried a few different clam chowder recipes, but this is BY FAR the best I've ever had! I did add 1/2 of a diced red onion and some inner leafy ribs of celery because they needed to be used up. My husband had picked up a 51 oz. (commercial size) can of clams in clam juice, so I drained and rinsed the clams, reserving the juice. The juice was enough to cover the potatoes and veggies, and I didn't need to add any water. I went to two stores (Publix and Walmart) and could not find the Knorr Leek Soup mix - but some of my foodie friends found a post on Ask the Community where Cindy said the Knorr Vegetable Mix could be used in it's place, so that's what I did. I only used one packet though, as I was a worried about the soup being too salty if I used 2 packets, being that I used all clam juice instead of water, as the clam juice can be salty. This was a good call, and I will make it exactly like this again (which is why I'm documenting all of this in my review, so I can remember what the heck I did - at my husband's request). Thank you, Cindy, for this delicious recipe. It will be my "go to" clam chowder from now on!

I added another tin of whole baby clams and used only 4 potatoes, and probably more bacon just because - everyone absolutely loved this recipe, and it's way easier to make than the one I've always made before.  Definitely a keeper!  Printed another copy Oct 6/16 - couldn't find the other one.  Make a double batch of this every year for my daughter.

This is a great base recipe for clam chowder, in my opinion the flavor was Not clammy enough so I use all clam juice and very little water and to make the soup creamer I use a pint of half and half and a pint of heavy whipping cream and its awesome. Thanks so much for this recipie

This recipe was ok, but not awesome.  I used other reviews suggestions and added two bottles of clam juice instead of water for more clam taste, which was a great suggestion, but the leek soup mix still overpowered the recipe and made it taste like a artificially flavored prepared food, not even close to a homemade taste for all the extra work, instead of just opening a can.  In addition there was not enough clams in this soup.  Next time I would add fresh onion, four cans of clams and celery, and omit the leek soup.

My only changes to this recipe were 4 cans of clams, 2 bottles (8oz. Each) of clam juice, no water, about a tsp&1/2 of ground thyme and extra black pepper( because I love it). It was really good! Also used light cream because that's what I had. Cooking directions were spot on, thank you, I will definitely make this again! Better than a lot of New England restaurant's that we have been in! Oops, also put in diced celery and green onion( had to use them up) as well as the carrot. Great meal with crusty bread to dunk!

I used the vegetable dried soup mix because that is all my local grocer had, and it still came out pretty good.  The taste was great, but there was a lot of 'clutter' with all he dried veggies.  I added some onion with the potatoes and sauteed for 10 minutes in the bacon grease to make up for not using leek soup.  I didn't add any salt and served with some sourdough bread.  The recipe made enough soup for two lunches for a family of four.  

I was really happy with it.

Excellent just as written.  If you want a big clam taste, I would recommend the addition of clam base.

I used diced onion,flour and dryed powdered celery instead of the leek soup mix (works just the same!)?? also I used 1 thing of clam juice and a little bit of water(it still tasted the same but if you want it more clammy just put more clam juice) the final soup had more things in it than the original had but it was still great!! This was my first time ever making clam chowder and normally if it was my first time doing something it would come out bad! But the clam chowder didn't it was great! I will recommend this video to my friends and make them try it out!?? totally deserves 10 stars if it could!!

Excellent!! We just got back from San Fran and I have to say this was better than the chowder we had there.. Serve with warm San Francisco style sourdough and it makes a nice fall/winter meal. Also, I added onion and celery for some more texture.

Wow is all I can say! My store did not have Leek dry soup so I used Knorr Spring Vegetable recipe mix instead. Went exactly per instructions, plus the two (0.9 oz each) packages soup mix. slow simmered to a  thicker consistency. My wife said it was a richer tasting chowder. And it surely tasted upscale. Keep this and toss out the rest. I have found THE ONE! Thank You! 
P.S. Yukon gold potatoes definitely used.

Deserves the "awesome" name in its title. Substituted a parsnip for the potatoes, added an extra can of clams, used chicken broth instead of water, and only 1 pkg of leek soup. Great flavor and I lived in Boston for a number of years. Thanks Cindy

found this on here and figured since my name is Cindy it must be for me :) so I made garlic rosemary bread bowls and this awesome chowder.  They went perfectly together.  This is an awesome recipe but not for anyone on a diet of low fat.

This is my go to clam chowder in a pinch.  It is quick and easy to make and even if you don't personaly tweek it, it is great.  I have made this recipe so many times I can't count.  However I made it last night for dinner and used another can of clams with sauted celery and a bit of shallots (I had them on hand) and was wonderful.  I will be adding those in from now on.  Thanks Cindy, really great recipe.

Good! I used one less potato because mine were large and I didn't want that much soup and made substitutions because of my BF's diet restrictions- fat free half and half and turkey bacon.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  A little disappointed that it wasn't very clammy, even with boiling the potatoes in clam juice.  I may add extra clams next time. But it was tasty nonetheless and not too terribly difficult to make.

This was really good. I strongly suggest you add hardly any salt because the soup mix added plenty. Wait until the soup is finished cooking to add if any.

Probably a 4.5*. I would give it a 5* as I don't like clams yet this is the best clam chowder I've ever tasted - probably because I LOVE bacon. My girlfriend gave it a 4* only because (A) too much bacon, (B) I bought baby clams - too small for her,(my bad).

I made this last night for a rainy Sunday evening meal -- it was fantastic.  Very easy to put together - made it exactly like the recipe.  This,along with a salad, willl become a staple at my house throughout the winter!  Can't wait to make it for the rest of my family and some friends!

This is perfect! My grandson loves clam chowder and I used to shy away from making it. With this recipe - no worries! He now has his friends asking for this when they come to dinner.

Loved the consistancy of this soup.  I do not eat meat at all only fish and seafood, so instead of bacon drippings I used two Tbsp olive oil added the veggies and sprinkled on a ham flavor seasoning.  It was tasty with out all the bacon drippings.

I love this one but add more clams to mine and just homo milk, more potatoes mashed for thickening.  Garnish with chopped green onion and chopped tomato.

We really liked this - even my 6 year old! I used Turkey Bacon but otherwise followed the recipe as written - can't wait to eat again today!
