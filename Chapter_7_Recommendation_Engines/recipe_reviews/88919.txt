I toasted thin baquette slices sprinkled with olive oil and served the spread on the side...this was one of the favorite apps on the Christmas Eve Gathering table...didn't change a thing and won't change a thing the next time I make it...since it is an appetizer spread the serving size is a little funky because you only use a bit on each crostini...definately serves more than 4 as an appetizer...Thanks for a very lovely, upscale recipe...

The only thing we changed was that we only used pork liver because that is what we had.  This needed a lot more onions.  Maybe we have just lost our pallet for liver.

Delicious! Never had pâté before, even though we raise our own meat birds. I am a total convert thanks to this recipe. Thank you!
