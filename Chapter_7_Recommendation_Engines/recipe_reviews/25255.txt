Great recipe for special occassions, especially because it can be prepared the day before and just popped in the oven before serving.  Low fat cream cheese and sour cream can be substituted without changing flavor or creaminess!

I was not about to peel 5 lbs of potatoes so I left the skin on them and boiled a little longer so the skins were tender. Still came out great.  I also sprinkled about a cup of shredded cheese on top.  I added some crumbled bacon on top.  The only reason why I did that is I was making bacon cheeseburgers so I fried up the entire batch of bacon.  My entire family loved this and it went great with the grilled food and watching football!  Will make again.

Yummy.  I love red potatoes.  They taste a lot like the ones you get at Applebees.  I left the skins on mine since I was using baby reds.  I will make again for sure.

We loved this.  It's simple and the blend of flavors was perfect.  I must admit it's appearance looked somewhat boring, so if you're going to serve it for company, I'd suggest perhaps sprinkling some sliced green onions or chives on top with a pinch of paprika after taking it out of the oven.  My 15 year old told me "this is killer mom!"

This is the best potato recipe!  It is to die for!  I made it for my big family Sunday dinner and EVERYONE had seconds.  Can't say it's very low-fat, but worth every calorie.  It reheats wonderfully, too!

These weren't bad, they just weren't stellar.  It was alot of effort for something ho-hum that is so high in calories and fat.  I will not waste my time on them again.

I had high hopes for this potato dish because have been making a similar one for years.   Unfortunately it came out much too soupy.   When I was putting it together I added the butter gradually which is lucky otherwise it would have been even soupier.  Ended up using about half the amount and also had to cut back on sour cream by a 1/4 of a cup.    Guests seem to like it but I felt is was just too thin a mixture.  Perhaps it is supposed to be like this and again, depends on your tastes.

I used lowfat cream cheese and FF sour cream. I boiled a couple cloves of garlic in with the potatoes and mashed it all together and eliminated the garlic salt. I think it was a little too much extra stuff, I might cut it down just a bit next time. Maybe add some chopped green onions. Solid recipe, excellent with my custom version of Reunion Meatballs.

Absolutely great for a potluck. Mine came out a bit dry but I think it's because 30 minutes is too long to bake them. Next time I'll stick to 15 and I'll add milk to keep them creamy. Yum yum yum!

This is exactly how I make my mashed potatoes for all our holiday meals, except I don't add garlic. You can make them ahead, then heat them in the crock pot when you are ready to use them. These mashed potatoes are rich, creamy and decadent. I whip them with my electric mixer so they're smooth. Kaye

These were ok for us. I love mashed potatoes, sour cream and cream cheese, but there seemed to be something missing. I think next time I will add a head of roasted garlic and maybe some chopped onion. As it is, these are kind of bland.

5 lbs of red potatoes, too many!  I think it might taste better with maybe 3 lbs of russet or white potatoes.  All those red ones took away much flavor from the decadent ingredients!  Nice try, Sunshine!  Will make again with modifications.

I doubled this recipe the evening before, to be baked the next day for an after-church supper. The potatoes' texture held up nicely for holding to bake. It was the first dish to empty. Many people asked for the recipe - the sign of a good one.  Details: I peeled only half of the potatoes. All were boiled together until tender. Then, both types were mixed together by ricing with a slightly larger grid than I would use for mashed potatoes. This treatment gave them a chunky texture, with an attractive red sprinkling of peels.   Because of the large volume cook, I creamed all the dairy ingredients and seasonings together with a mixer before folding the mixture into the hot potatoes to distribute the flavors evenly.  Because of the volume, the doubled dish had to be baked in a Calphelon roasting pan -- just the right size for 10 pounds of potatoes with 3 pounds of trimmings!

My grandma brought company potatoes to thanks giving one year. I was hooked. I've tried tons of recipes trying to find the right one and this is by far the best. I always add some onions in the potatoes and cheese and cornflakes on top. It's fabulous. Worth every calorie

I agree with some of the others, these potatoes were not bad but definately lacked the "something" it takes for a true five star recipe.  Not much overall flavor.  They really were just really high calorie mashed potatoes.  I really think that adding onions and garlic would really allow this dish to achieve its potential.

These are excellent and I make them every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Its a great make ahead recipe for the holidays, just pop them in the oven the next day.  I sprinkled shredded cheese on top to give it some gooey, cheesy flavor.  Not very low fat or healthy, but YUMMY nonetheless!

I read the recipe correctly and agree with all - 250 must be a typo. However-I found there was not enough milk to keep the casserole a casserole- it came out of the oven looking like potatoes and cheese. I added butter and more milk and put it back in the oven at 350. It's not finished yet-but I'm thinking 30 min.?
