Nice alternative.  I wouldn’t call it “risotto” but I’d call it very fine. None of the guilt either, which makes this choice even better.

Very good. I substituted regular butter instead of ghee, and half and half for the heavy whipping cream and it turned out great. All my guests loved it. Next time I will cook the bacon separately to get it a little browner and crisper, but otherwise, it was great.

I thought it was very easy to make.  No more prep work than usual.  I used half and half and Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream to save on calories but I added some cooked diced chicken for more protein.  I will make it again and am looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch.
