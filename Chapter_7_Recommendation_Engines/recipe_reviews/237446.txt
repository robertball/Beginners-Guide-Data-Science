I bought plantains for the first time and tried them in a savory dish as well as this one. I discovered that I am not a fan of the plantain but that is not due to any fault of this recipe. These fried up nice and golden brown and the vanilla was a nice touch. Mine were so ripe that I was afraid they would not hold their shape and turn to mush if cut into strips so I just quartered them. 5-7 minutes gets these pretty brown but that just adds to the flavor and sweetness. No need for the optional sprinkling of sugar in my opinion.

Very good!  My friend gave me a half box of plantains.  I needed a different ways to fix them!  Love this recipe but I also added shredded coconut on top while cooking.  Yummy!

First of all, plantains have to be overly ripe. Black and tender. They are NOT bananas. When in El Salvador, I had the best plantains ever. This is a good recipe with out sugar.
