Oh Yeah...if you want to impress...this is the app to bring when invited to a party.  I used the biggest jalepenos and it made the job easier..but I also used large shrimp.  I used maple flavoured bacon.  I needed toothpicks to secure them.  They were very tasty and everybody loved them....they didn't last verry long so make lots!!!Thank you for this recipe!!

These were pretty good only I changed it up a little bit.  I don't like olives...AT ALL..so I stirred some pesto into my whipped cream cheese.  I don't think the shrimp really added much extra.  I bacon wrapped a few shrimp and baked them on a cookie sheet with the jalepenos--VERY GOOD!

They're fantastic! People come over requesting it. I don't use olives, but add a touch of water and salt to other cream cheese mix. It takes me about 45 minutes of baking until the bacon is crispy.
