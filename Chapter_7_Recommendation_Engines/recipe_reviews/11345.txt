I have been making this recipe for years...Tips chill the dough about an hour - it's easier to handle.  Add 1/2 C flour.  Let them bake 8-12 minutes, checking at 8,10&12 minutes - the bottoms should be golden brown. Pull the cookie sheets out and let the cookies rest on the sheets for a few minutes.  Do not keep in the oven because you think these are not done - cause they are!  They will harden up as they sit on the sheets and cool down. YUMMO!!!  I also have tried with sugar free cool-whip - less calores and it's still just so gooood.

You can use ANY packaged cake mix, and you can even use dry brownie mix.  You can also get creative with what kind of sugar mix you use to roll the dough into.  My friend made a mix of sugar and splenda and ground it up to mimic the texture of powdered sugar and the cookies were fabulous!  For as easy as this is to make, the cookies taste better than I've had in a long time, AND they always remain moist!

My grandma would make these all the time when I was little.  She would use also use white cake mix with 3 egg whites and then add food coloring to the batter.  (ie., red and green for Christmas)  She would also make ahead and freeze.  (freeze no longer than 2 months. let thaw in fridge for 24 hours)  I'm so glad to see this recipe out here!  Brings back wonderful memories of baking with grandma so long ago!

These are sooooo good!  I chilled the dough, and then scooped it with one spoon and scraped it into the powdered sugar with a second spoon.  They WERE good ~ gone now!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but 8 minutes was not long enough...  I actually had to double the time, so if anyone tries this, you might want to do a small test batch...  Other than tha, these cookies taste great, and are easy to make :o)

Easy to make and has a great texture. I too had to play around with the baking time a bit. I wound up baking the cookies for 14 minutes and they turned out great. I made this with chocolate cake mix as I was out of lemon. Can't wait to try it with lemon!

definitely a cake like cookie, but HEY, whe n you're using a cake mix I guess that's a natural. I found it too difficult to take the sticky thick dough and roll it in confectioners sugar so I dusted the cookie with 10X after baking. You don't get the crackle look but the taste is still there. You could call these cookies muffin tops and for those of you who are Seinfeld fans, this is a good basis for a black and white cookie...just mix up two batches of icing one choco and one vanilla and brush half the cookie with each...Look to the Cookie!

I made these last night from an old recipe that I had but had never tried....it used only ONE egg and 1 cup of cool whip....be sure to put in fridge before trying to roll out into balls....worked like a charm and did not have "cake like" texture due to the one egg....two gives it cake like texture....wonderful!!!!!!

I made with orange cake mix, but we loved this light, soft cookie!  It was perfect to make with my 2-year-old.  Thanks for a wonderfully simple recipe!  Will make tons more.

Love these cookies, they are so easy and make so many! I made the dough in advance, froze it and then let them thaw for a day before actually baking, then I got a cookie scoop (like a melon baller or small ice cream scoop) and used that to drop them in the powdered sugar! Worked wonderfully!

A good cookie.  Turned out well, and everyone wanted to know about them.  Easy to mix up, but I DEFINITELY recommend the wise tip of first rolling the sticky ball in granulated sugar before dealing with the rather messy 10X sugar...that really helped, but be ready to wipe your hands after each cookie.  Mine needed to bake a full 15 minutes, in a convection oven, to be done.  The 15 minute time was about perfect, though I make my cookies a bit larger than recommended.  Also, to store, the best is an airtight container in the frig to keep them at their tastiest.

I added a little flour to stiffen up the dough a bit and a little sour cream to retain some of the acidity of the lemon as I didn't have any lemons on hand for juice or zesting.  These were a huge hit and everyone that had them absolutely loved them.  They were like little muffin tops/cake instead of cookies and so pretty with the powdered sugar on them.  According to a previous review, a brownie mix can be substituted...I would caution against this as I tried it and ended up with flat "okay" cookies.  I believe this is because brownie mix has different proportions in their ingredients than a cake mix.  I believe for them to come out as well as the cake mixes, you would have to add perhaps an additional egg and extra flour.  The cool whip in this recipe is basically substituting the oil and water called for in a recipe and a brownie mix calls for a different amount of each than a cake mix.  But anyway...lemon cake mix turns out great, light and delightful...I want to call them Lemon Puff Cookies or Puffy Lemon Cookies...I don't want to give away the easy ingredients secret!!!  lol  I always cool my cookies straight from the oven to my freezer and take them out as soon as they are cool enough to handle.  The powdered sugar part is the most labor intensive step in the process and I used parchment paper which is a beautiful thing instead of just spraying a nonstick pan!

So delicious and SO easy! I was worried about the batter/dough not being thick enough, but I mixed it a little longer and it thickened up more. You can't shape these at all until you put them in the powdered sugar...You literally have to just drop a glob into the powdered sugar and then it will roll into a nice ball. I love these. Will definitely make these again.

Oh my goodness! I made these cookies last night before supper & we practically ate them all before supper. They were the best cookies I have ever tasted in my life. My daughter is GF. (celiac disease) so I used one of her cake mixes (GF/Dairy Free) wow! these cookies melt in your mouth. I can't wait to try other flavors. I used a yellow cake mix. This will be a recipe I used forever. Thanks to My Allrecipes. I got more than 18 cookies. Recommend highly. not allot of work. I took the suggestion from one member who said to chill dough an hour. Worked like a charm. Thanks

Made these for a cookie exchange at work and these cookies were the hit of the exchange.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I did change a bit. I added 1 tsp lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 1/2 cup flour.  I also let them chill for about an hour; which made it easier to handle

Easy to make when you need cookies quickly. the 8 minute baking time worked perfectly for me. They taste just like the cake. My teenagers demolished the first tray right out of the oven. I will definitely make these again.

yummo! I was wary of these when I saw them at a party, but am sooo glad I tried one. Now that I have made them I have a tip to make the process of powdering them a cinch. Drop about a 3rd of the dough in the powdered sugar and coat so you can pick up and handle the dough. Hold in one hand, gently pinch a piece off, drop in the sugar to finish powdering and drop on the cookie sheet. Occasionally re-drop the large piece of dough to be sure it stays nicely powdered and will not stick to your hand. Happy baking!

I have made this cookie for years. Its one of my Christmas cookie tin favorites. Tasty and easy. They improve with age if they last that long. I use a wooden spoon handle to make a dent in the top of the hot cookies. I add a dab of Lemon Curd. Then I sift powdered sugar over the warm cookies.

I make these cookies sans the egg with no problems. Just mix and whip.  As for the sticky complaints I would sugest a two fold solution first invest in a stainless steel cookie disher don't skimp sturdy is best. Secondly pour the powdered sugar in a 9x13 and dish directly into that. We like vanilla mix , vanilla whip with coco in the sugar or Chocolate mix, chocolate whip

These are fabulous cookies! I too had to leave them in longer than 8 minutes, 11 is about right.  I found if you put the batter in a Ziploc bag, chill it in the freezer a few minutes, then cut the tip off like a pastry bag, the batter is easier to handle. I just dipense it out of the bag into the powered sugar and it works great! The only problem I am having is they won't stay puffy, they flatten out. I have a freind that makes them and they stay puffy for her. hmmm...

Delish!  I made these cookies with chocolate cake mix and used Cool Whip Free.  Next time I'll try using cherry chip or vanilla, and add a little bit of vanilla extract to give it more flavor.  I brought them to work and everyone loved how light and fluffy they are!  A nice change for the hot, summer months!  Thank you for the recipe!  :)

This is a very good recipe.  The cookies stayed soft and did not flatten out.  I really enjoyed them.  I'm going to try them with chocolate cake also.

So easy and so tasty!  I used the new Orange Creamsicle cake mix and my family devoured them in one sitting.  Going to try some red velvet cake mix next time.

Yes... friends and family enjoy them. I add one cup of golden raisins to the recipe.  When the raisins cook no one knows what they are.  They get a little crunchy... more like a piece of nut rather than a raisin.

Awesome! Followed the recipe except used only 1 egg. I stuck them in the freezer for 10 minutes before I rolled them.  I used funfetti cake mix, and they were heavenly...

So light, airy, and delicious! Could eat them all by myself (but I won't). Cooking at altitude, so I added an extra two minutes and they are perfect!

Sorry, did not care for these at all! Obviously these have a "cake-like" consistency, but for some reason I just wasn't expecting that they'd be SOO-O-O cake-y!!  And no matter how long I cooked them or where I adjusted my oven racks, the bottoms got too brown by the time the tops were barely done.  Might've been something I did wrong, but I wouldn't waste time (or ingredient$) trying these again!

Love this recipe. We made these when my oldest was young, and now with my 2 little ones. Its so easy for them to make. And they can pick their favorite flavors by changing the cake mix.

This was easy, and quite tasty.  I did add one step:  First I dropped the dough in granulated sugar to coat, then I moved it to powered sugar for a second coat.  Seems to have helped the powered sugar stay nice and white after baking.  (Stole that tip from a chocolate crackle cookie I make).  I also used a small scoop to drop the dough into the sugar.  Much easier than a spoon and helps it stay more round.  They do spread a bit, so don't put them too close on the pan, or they'll stick together.  I also tried a batch by just rolling in granulated sugar, then smooshing flat with a glass dipped in granulated sugar.  You get a flat cookie this way, and although not as pretty, I think they tasted better this way.

I made one with chocolate cake mix and another with white cake mix with red food coloring.  They had good flavor and consistency.  One batch I didn't bake enough so they were really goooey, but still quite yummy.  Sort of has a marshmallow like feel and consistency, very good and different.

As others have said, this recipe is great. Trick is to use a small ice cream scoop with the lever. No mess. Just drop into a small bowl of confectioner's sugar, roll it around and voila! Easy as can be. And yes, if you have a gas oven, 11-12 minutes is necessary.

I also needed to double the time.

I absolutely love this recipe because you can use any cake mix that you want which I like. But make sure the cool whip is thawed out before you start to make the cookies ??????

These were so delicious!  I love lemon flavored anything and these were perfect!  They stay moist, which I really liked.  EXTREMELY fast and easy to make.  Dough (even when refrigerated) does get sticky...I would recommend using flour as others have.  I will the next time I make them.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I am a lemon lover and the lemon taste is sort of there. I guess I didn't expect them to be like cake. They are spongey and I don't think my house hold will eat them.

Very easy and good cookies! But a couple warnings...
1. Great tip from another reviewer to add 1/2 cup of flour! Without it they are very thin and have no structure.
2. Bake for 10 minutes for lightweight cookie sheets
3. Original recipe makes at least 3 dozen, not 1 1/2 dozen!

I will definitely make these again and try other flavored cake mixes as suggested!

These were easy to make, I added an extra egg and some flour.  I used the two spoons to dip them into the powdered sugar.  They taste good!  Great easy recipe for some quick homeade cookies.

I made these cookies with lite whipped topping and another time made it with nonfat whipped topping.  Both times, came out AWESOME!  WARNING:  They ARE addictive!  Also, I took someone else's advice and chilled the dough a little before rolling them in the powdered sugar.

I make these every Christmas and have done so for years!  You can also change the flavor by using different flavors of cake mix: chocolate, strawberry, cherry, orange (especially good!), pineapple, etc.  The dough is a little difficult to handle at times (I only scoop a little more than a teaspoon at a time) but dipping them in the confectioner's sugar and rolling them helps with the stickiness.  I am always asked for the recipe and have made them so often that I have memorized it!

I was anticipating enjoying these cookies, I'm a big fan of cool whip.  I was very disappointed.  I thought the cookies were very bland and tastelss.  I did use light cool whip (but I use light everything and it never bothers me).  I would not make these again, sorry!

These are very light and soft cookies.  However, 8 minutes is definately not enough time for these cookies.  At 8 minutes they are still cake batter.  I had to cook them for 16 minutes.  Overall though, they had a good taste.

Delicious and light cookies.  The dough was very thick and sticky and not that easy to work with, but the end results are well worth it!

These are really delicious cookies. The only problem I had was the stickiness of the dough. It was so messy & almost unbearable to work with. If the cookies didn't taste so good I probably would not make again. However, I did just read a couple of reviews that say to chill the dough for at least an hour to help with the stickiness. So, next time I will definitely do that. So far I made strawberry cake mix & Devils food cake. SO VERY YUMMY!!!

I added a teaspoon or so of lemon zest, that helped make them a bit more flavorful. Also, if you use one egg and one yolk and add a teaspoon or so of oil they wil not be as cake-y, otherwise they turn out a bit like cupcake tops. Other than that, a definite winner, especially for the bake sale when you need something easy...

Baked for 12 minutes.  Cookies were light, soft and chewy.  I wouldn't necessarily bring them to an event, but they are a good cookie to make with a few ingredients on hand.

This is one of my favorite cookies, I love the texture!  I made the following changes; only used 2 cups of cool whip and 1 egg.  Baked at 350 for 10-11 minutes and turned out perfectly!

Well done Linda K!  :-)

In a pinch these cookies should be your "go to" recipe.  I'm baking the third batch as I write this having used lemon cake mix.  They really are a good cookie BUT COOKING TIME for my oven isn't accurate.  13 minutes not 8 minutes in my oven with the rack in the center position.  

TIP:  As a side note I use a 1 1/2" scoop so the cookies come out the same size.  Drop the scoop of cookie dough into the powdered sugar and pick it up and roll it just like you would a peanut butter cookie but adding a good helping of powdered sugar as you roll into a ball.  The cookies also spread so lining them up 3" apart isn't too much room to give them.  Using parchment paper alleviates the need to grease your pan and I would imagine non-stick foil on a baking sheet would work too.

OPTIONAL:  I've got an 18 oz package of brownie mix in my cupboard.  Think I'll use it but instead add only 1 egg, 4oz Cool Whip, 4 oz softened cream cheese.  I just may add a cup of chocolate chips to the batter as well.   Sounds yummy!  :-)

I was in a pinch for a quick recipe.  I can't tell you how many compliments I got for these.  I was embarrassed to reveal how incredibly simple it was to make these.  The only tricky part was that the dough was very sticky, even after freezing for many hours.  I didn't even bother rolling it in powdered sugar.  I just sprinkled some on top.  Such a simple recipe that works!

heaven. super easy. chilling the batter a bit before rolling in powdered sugar makes it a little easier - less sticky, but if you use 2 spoons to get the portion on the sugar and toss the sugar on top before you touch it, it won't stick to your fingers as much. Cooked for about 9 1/2 minutes. We used the Lite version of Cool Whip by mistake but they are amazing anyway. Can't wait to try this with other flavors.

wow my cookies were good but I only had recipe that called for 4 ounce of cool wipe and one egg. I will be trying this way. As long as it doesn't change the taste it will be a winner for me. They way I do it is way to hard to mix.

I stumbled across this recipe when looking for lemon cupcakes.  Sure glad I did.  These cookies are very good.  My husband even enjoyed them and he is not much of a lemon fan.  Will definately make these again.

I was a little leary about these at first with the whole idea of baking something with cool whip in it, but since trying them....love them.  Have made them several times and have even brought them into work (where I was asked by several people for the recipe).

Good cookie, but 8 minutes at 350 isn't nearly enough. After experimenting, 15 minutes give them a slight crunch on the edges and the middle is done. At 8 minutes, although the flavor was good, they were really doughy in the middle and all around. I'll make again @ 15 minutes.

These cookies are so good!!! Not to mention how easy they are to make. I put my dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes before baking. I baked them for 11 minutes. I made lemon & strawberry. Both were good, however, my favorite were the lemon ones. So yummy:) I used 2 spoons to handle the dough with so i wouldnt get sticky. It worked perfectly...I will def. be making these again!

WOW, these are great.  Did the lemon cake mix, and the only thing I added was the zest and juice of 1/2 lemon. Truly moist and tasty. Made 36 and baked 12 min.

I have made these several times with Cherry Chip cake mix and people love them.  The dough is very sticky, I use a pampered chef tablespoon scoop with a squeeze handle and drop the dough ball into the sugar, then use two forks to roll and put on the cookie sheet.  I bake for 11 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous.  I made these for our Christmas cookie exchange and I had people I didn't even know coming up to me asking for the recipe.  I made it a second time with strawberry cake mix and it was good, but not quite as good as the lemon.  Next time I will try chocolate!  Can't believe such good, soft, yummy cookies come from 4 simple ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!

I searched this recipe in Google, and this was the first one to come up! We had everything to make these cookies in our pantry/refrigerator, so I went and got everything. It was going OK, until I found out that the dough is NOT thick, it is rather sticky and gooey. You may need to add [a lot] of Confectioner's sugar to help this not stick, or just chill it. These cookies look so yummy, but I wish this person would've said something about having to chill it!   And you can also use any kind of cake mix.... for me, I used Betty Crocker's Triple Chocolate Fudge. Mmm!

Rather disappointed by this recipe.  When everything was mixed together, it wasn't very thick.  The taste was ok, but definitetly not something I will do again.

A LABOR of love...the dough for this recipe is absolutely INSANE! Super sticky! I even added a 1/2c. of flour (as someone else reommended) AND chilled it for an hour, but it was still hard to work with. Thank God for the Pampered Chef Medium Scoop! The only redeeming quality for this cookie is its taste...but they aren't even close to to die for, so I will not be making them again. I also made the mistake of using Red Velvet cake mix - needless to say, my kitchen looked like a murder scene! LOL :) Oh well - give it a whirl if you like a challenge!

These were so easy, you can't mess it up! I had to bake them for exactly 11 minutes but other than that I followed the recipe, and they look just like the picture and taste even better!

Refrigerate the dough! It makes or break this recipe.  And high altitude people, don't forget to add more flour! Great recipe nonetheless, but put the dough in the fridge for an hour or so and then the cookies won't be as flat.

Oh, these are fun! Crazy recipe, but we loved them at our house. I used strawberry cake mix (kind with jello) and Fat Free whipped topping. Also, I cooked them on parchment paper instead of greasing the pan. I got 32 cookies out of the batch, but could easily have gotten 36. I did the calculations, and with fat free whipped topping at 32 cookies they had 94 calories each. If you make 36 cookies they will only have 85 calories. And these cookies are good!! The batter is goopy and hard to work with, but I took advice of other reviewers and just used 2 spoons, never touching the dough. Mine cooked for 10 minutes and are wonderful. Thanks for this really fun recipe!

These are so easy to make and so delicious.  Just a note of caution like others may have said- do NOT overbake, 8-9 minutes is perfect.  And do NOT overgrease your pan or they will turn out like flat pancakes.  Enjoy!

I must have done something very, very wrong because they were still gooey in the middle after 10 min. so I put them in longer.  Then they were dark brown (almost burnt) but still gooey (uncooked) in the middle. Must be something I did or maybe I need a new oven!

These are so tasty! I think that I will try them again--with different cake mixes (as recommended in some other reviews).

I was really skeptical when I saw the consistency of the dough. It looks really difficult to work with, but, after reading another review, I found that using 2 spoons was very helpful.

I also had to increase the baking time to 10-12 min. And the amount of powdered sugar needed is much more than 1/3 cup. I actually didn't measure mine. I just kept refilling my bowl as it ran out, but I'd guess it to be 1-2 cups.

This yielded almost exactly 3 dozen cookies (plus 2).

I love these cookies!! My uncle used to make them when I was younger and he called them Lemon Crack Cookies because they crack when you bake them. It took me awhile to find the recipe online but I'm glad I did! Make sure you space them far apart on the cookie sheets because they tend to spread quite a bit. Also, the recipe made more than 3 dozen - I had about 4 dozen after using a large cookie scoop AND eating some of the dough! Overall, they are tasty cookies with a delicate texture, and are easy to make with few ingredients.

These were a nice quick cookie that I could make with what I had on hand.  They were pretty good too.  They have a light lemon flavor and a light and soft texture.  I can't wait to try with different cake mixes.

I've been looking for this recipe for some time - got it about 12 years ago from an elderly friend who has since forgotten the recipe.  These are the BEST cookies - you can use different types of cake mix, too, for flavor variations.  Yum!!

These were OK...I used chocolate cake mix and the dough was very sticky and difficult to work with.  Plus, I needed to bake the cookies at least 12 minutes, not 8 as stated in the recipe.  Although the cookies tasted good, I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

These should be called "cool whip CAKEies" they were like little cupcakes, not cookies and turned hard by the next day.  I added 1tsp of almond extract since I only had white cake mix.

There are better recipes out there.

I'm sorry but I didn't like this at all. I'm wondering if I did something wrong although it would be hard since it's so simple. Mine were dry and tasted like cupcake tops they might have been better with frosting. They were light like the top of a cupcake also. I should have just made cupcakes.

I’ve made these a few times but don’t use any egg. They come out great every time and are a favorite at my office. Like others have said, I need to bake them longer than 8 min - more like 15 for chewy cookies and 18 for crispy/chewy. I’ve tried other flavors of cake mix but didn’t like it as much. The lemon has such a great taste. Enjoy!

I added the zest of a lemon and a teaspoon of lemon extract.  I also added coconut and did not roll them in powdered sugar because I wanted to do a lemon glaze.  ( I do love lemon),  

 WARNING: CHILL THE DOUGH or drive yourself bonkers.

And check your cake mix and make certain it is the correct weight, I used one that was only 15, 25 ounces and I had to improvise, but improvise I did and I still have a tasted lovely cookie.

Took 11 minutes in my oven. Not sure if I made cookies bigger than others.  They came out puffier for sure. The batter was super sticky. Delicious though!

I LOVE lemon and I really wanted this recipe to be a winner. My first batch, following the recipe exactly was a nightmare. The dough never firmed up and therefore was impossible to work with. I then followed MastahX's suggestions and that was slightly better-it got the dough onto the cookie sheet. Not easily, but it got there. As I said, I LOVE lemon but found the flavor in this recipe too weak so I added lemon extract. The cookies baked up pretty once I followed MastahX's directions, but I won't make these again. Seriously unimpressed, even with all the alterations.

I used a spice cake mix and added raisins to the batter. After refrigerating the dough for approximately 45 minutes, I dropped the dough, (without rolling them in sugar), on a silicone lined baking sheet and baked in a convection oven at 330 degrees for 10 minutes. They came out perfectly.

One of the easiest and quickest recipes I’ve made. Never fails to satisfy. If short on eggs you can get by using one egg. I use a cookie scoop and drop into the powdered sugar so less mess. I use a 1 tablespoon scoop so cook for about 12-14 min. I find that lemon mix spreads out more than chocolate or other mixes. But any cake mix or brownie mix will work. If making for a special event you’ll have to guard them from your cookie monsters cause they will he GONE!

I'm giving this a 3 because making these per the recipe results in an okay cake cookie.  I'd give it a 5 with my adaptations.  Per previous reviews, I chilled the dough before scooping.  I used a cookie scoop to get them into the conf. sugar and on the pan, which worked fine, but the result was HUGE cookies. I used white cake mix and dyed a batch red and a batch green for Christmas per another reviewer, and looking at them, they looked exactly like whoopie pies, so I pulled an audible. :-) I made a lightly-anised whipped frosting and stuffed two of the giant cookies with that, then rolled them in holiday-colored sprinkles.  The result--AMAZING!  My friends and fam' loved them. If I were to make these again, it would definitely be for whoopie pie purposes.  I'd likely use some extract to a give the cake more flavor.  The cool whip does make the cookies creamy, and they are the kind that taste better after sitting for a day.  To sum it up, these are PERFECT for whoopie pies, but I wouldn't make them again as stand alone cookies.  So have fun whoopie'ing, if you feel so inclined!! :-D

Pretty good. I would have preferred if they were a bit goopier like a  lemon bar. They're decently fluffy. Maybe 1 egg instead of 2?

These are awful.  They stick to cookie sheet even with light greasing and even when left on sheet for a long time before removing  .  Did not appear to set even when baked for 10 minutes.   Taste seemed excessively sweet for a cookie.   I will not make them again and will probably throw these out!!

I make this as a bar cookie.  Add 1 tsp lemon  zest and 1-1/2 of lemon juice. Spray a 9 x 13 pan with Baking Joy. Dump batter into pan cover top with confectioner's sugar and press evenly into pan. Bake 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool and cut!

I make these every year for Christmas using red velvet cake mix, they're gorgeous and so yummy! I only use 1 egg, otherwise they're a little too cake like. Keep them small for a better "crinkle" look and the baking time will be around 8-10 minutes. They are meant to be soft so pull them even if the tops don't look done as long as the bottoms are done. These have become our traditional cookie for Santa every year and I love to bring them to holiday parties because they look like they were a lot more work than they actually are!

I made a  larger  TBSP size.  they were perfect at 13 min.  I'm not a fan of the 'muffin-like' texture. And, they were very sweet. The dough is extremely sticky.  But,  I just used a small cookie scoop and dropped into the powdered sugar. And, then just rolled it around, one at a time.  I made lemon and they looked pretty: loved the crackled look. If, you like very sweet pancake-like texture cookies, you may like these. But, I won't make again. I will stick to tons of other cookie recipes that are much more special.

I have been making these for years.  I like using other flavored cake mixes to.  I like the chocolate and lemon.  My sister likes to  use the strawberry cake mix.  I like them because I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I just pick them up while they are on sale.  I have made these with one egg, mainly because I was at my sister's and she wanted to make some.  Forgot all about the other egg.  Definitely a good one!!!!

I read the reviews and watched the timing on my cookies- I left mine in a little longer than the recommended time.  I'm assuming because mine were a little bigger than the original recipe called for but I also know my oven pretty well so it worked out well.  Using a lemon cake mix, the cookies were absolutely amazing!  I took them to a potluck at work the next day and they were gone very quickly!  Will be making this recipe again - be aware - it is messy but worth it!

I made lemon cookie. Used Deluxe Lemon Supreme Cake Mix. The mixes are no longer 18.25 ounces.  To compensate I added 6 tablespoons of flour to the ingredients.

I only used one egg, it's an old recipe and I know people who used the single egg and the cookies are delicious.

Added the dough like MastahX suggested to the fridge for an hour, and then rolled in the sugar,

I baked for 10- 12 minutes and let sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes to "firm" up.

Good very easy cookie.

Really easy to make.  I liked the texture. Not bad all all for it being a packaged cake mix.  I made mine with yellow cake mix.  I will most defentelly make them again, but from scratch and add some nuts. :)

Messy to handle, probably should have chilled as suggested by others. They were good the 1st day, after that they became too chewy.

Best eaten same day. Not as good the next day. Maybe if I put them in a Tupperware it would hold in the moisture & chewiness.

I love this recipe and totally forgot about it until I saw it on here. I made these in miniature form last weekend for a baby shower dessert buffet and they were a huge hit. I used strawberry cake mix (friend's having a girl) and felt a little silly that so many people wanted the recipe and I'm like, well, you only need 4 ingredients so I'll give it to you right now. Chilling the dough makes it A LOT easier to work with if you're looking for pretty cookies. I also had success using a mini cookie scoop that has a release button (pressed it a couple times and then just shaped a little with my fingers). Because my little one's "helped" make these, I used egg beaters so I wouldn't worry about little fingers going for a taste of the raw dough. Still turned out great with the egg beaters (wasn't sure if that extra fat would have made a difference). Totally delish! Thanks!

We liked these cookies. They are moist, sweet and have a nice lemon flavor, but not tart. I found it easier to let them chill for 30 min before trying to roll in the sugar. I used two spoons, one to scoop the batter and one to scrape it off that spoon into the sugar. Once you place them in the sugar, just roll around for a second and they wont stick to your fingers. It took approx. 11 min in my oven and they were perfect. I am looking forward to trying other flavors for different Holidays. Thanks for sharing!

I can't imagine what I did to create such a flop out of this recipe when others had success.  They were flat and unbaked after 8 minutes baking.  I finally scraped the remaining dough into a cake pan and made bars.  My grandson did enjoy those.  Although, we threw the "cookies" away.

These were absolutely delicious!  I used red velvet cake mix to make these more festive for the holidays, and everyone raved about them.  I put mine in the oven for about 9 minutes, and the recipe actually made about 50 cookies.

Tried this recipe today with the exception of adjusting the oven temperature to 325 because I have a convection over.  I also used parchment paper to prevent sticking.  The cookie really needs to bake until golden brown to give it a crunchy texture and prevent sticking.  They also have a "cakey" texture when not cooked long enough.  Nice flavor.  Simple ingredients.  Not sure if I will bake them again, but still a nice cookie.

Hmm, not sure where to go with these. First off they were a pain in the behind to make. I thought my mixer was going to blow up, lol. Just that reason makes me not want to bother with them again. As far as the taste..it was ok. Like another reviewer said, its like eating cake in a cookie. That is if you cook em long enough. If cooked for a shorter time, they turn out very soft/sticky. I liked them better that way but they were difficult to handle.

Wow!  Very sweet.  And lemony, though.  Very easy, too.  The batter is very sticky, so it was a bit difficult to coat in confectioner's sugar but I prevailed.  They turn out pretty and very gooey in the center, but I'm sure they'll harden.  thanks for the recipe.

I received rave reviews from BF on these cookies. They were very easy and quick to make. To alleviate the problem of overly-sticky dough mentioned by some reviewers, I threw the dough in the freezer for 15 minutes prior to scooping and rolling in the sugar mixture. Had no trouble at all by doing this. I used yellow cake mix and added crushed gingerbread cookies to my batter. Great!

We loved these cookies. Just like others have said, we also had to adjust the baking time. We did have trouble with controlling the very thick dough, so next time with try to refrigerate it before handling. Also, we were looking for more of a "lemon cooler" type of cookie - so adding lemon zest is a great idea.

Super easy!  The only complaint I have is that the dough was extremely STICKY.  I probably should have stuck the dough in the fridge for a half hour or so.  I didn't have lemon cake mix, so I used chocolate fudge cake mix, and I had a bag of Kraft caramel chips in the cupboard and threw them in as well.  They tasted just like chocolate/caramel Pop Tart Sticks (I'm not sure if they even make them anymore).  Next batch will be the same plus marshmallows and pecans for rocky road cookies!

I'd love to give these 5 stars, but every batch came out flatter than pancakes.  I even chilled the dough.   Don't know what went wrong, but they were never like the picture or like the gourmet bake shop I wanted to copy.  If anyone has any help, I'd love to know why they wouldn't rise.  I used regular Cool Whip (whole tub), two eggs and a Duncan Hines chocolate mix.

Tasted good, but plain.  I was hoping that it would be more exciting than it was, but lemon cake is always delicious! =D  My best friend is a Raider's fan so I split the confectionary sugar into two bowls and poured black food coloring into one bowl so I could have black and white cookies for him.  =D

Amazing!!! So good & easy! Dough is sticky, but if you drop it into the sugar and sprinkle w/ sugar before you touch it. Roll around in sugar and then it won't stick to you. As long as there is sugar on the dough you shouldn't have any problems.

These have a great taste! The only change i made was i added Lemon extract. I only gave it a 3 because i had trouble getting the right timing down. The first time they over baked and the second batch under baked. This is the kind of cookie you need to keep a constant eye on. But they truly are delicious!

This cookie was not what I was hoping it would be. Had good flavor, but I wanted more consistency to it..would not make these again

I had never made cookies using cake mix before I alsways made them from scratch, but I wanted to try something different.  After making these cookies, they are very good.  I will definitely try using different mixes.  Thanks for the recipe.

Simply and Tastey! What more could a mom ask for?!! Yummy! If you don't like lemon, than use another cake flavor. Everyone that I shared these with thought they were yummy! If you want to make "your own" cookie vs. cut and bake- these are for you. Or, if you are cooking w/ a kiddie this is easy!

If you're really looking for lemon flavor, add some extract. The lemon in these is very subtle as written. It helps A TON to have a cookie scoop or small ice cream scoop when making these. I prefer them cooked until JUST golden brown so that they have some texture on the bottom and aren't just completely soft.

Very simple recipe and great for making with kids. I decided to try it with the Lite version of Cool Whip, this produced a very lemony but sticky batter. I did them as a drop cookie and sprinkled with the powdered sugar.

these were very light and perfect for summer. Although I did increase the baking time to 11 minutes in the oven because they were too goey with just 8 minutes

I made these with my 8 yr old son and he had such a good time. We made the mistake of trying to use our hands to form the balls. the dough is a bit sticky. We also used chocolate cake mix and will be making strawberry ones this evening. They were amazing and only lasted one day in my house. Everyone wants more. Super yummy and so easy to make.

Like a number of those who reviewed I grew up with this recipe. My mom and I would make it for Camp Fire events. I find this recipe is so simple that I did my first speech in school on how to make these and then I supplied the class with cookies. I have made every variation of these my house hold favorite is cherry chip or chocolate.  To those who try this and are not a fan, try it a different way.

This fantastic and easy recipe can be made in any season and with any flavor of boxed cake mix.

I double batch the ingredients, and used my mixmaster to blend it well; but, even doctored with spices, fruits, chips, or nuts, it worked, without changing this cookies wonderful soft texture at all. 

It is our entire families favorite!

And a requested holiday gift now....

I made these last night and was surprised at how simple they were.  I left them out over night and they are still chewy soft the next day.  Super lemon flavor.  Great recipe, I wouldn't change a thing.

Tried this recipe with the lemon cake mix. The baking time was tricky--8 minutes was not enough. Some turned out raw, others overdone.  They were also a little sweet for my taste. Probably won't try this one again.

OMG THIS IS CAKE. I used chocolate cool whip and chocolate cake mix to come come up with chocolate-crinkle cake. The difficult dough was not worth the outcome. I didn't find anything wrong with the taste, but my brother did NOT like them. :[ Now I got to go look for a recipe everyone will enjoy..Don't know what I'll do with these..THANKS THO!! I had a lot of whipped topping that I needed to get rid of.

I used this recipe at Christmas, as I always make lots of goodie bags with many different cookies. I loved it because it was quick and simple with few ingredients. I was able to make many batches of it in a short amount of time. It was also nice to add something a little different in with my traditional Christmas cookies. I'm also a sucker for anything lemony, yumm.

What an easy recipe! My boyfriend LOVES these cookies. I prepare it with the "Lite Cool Whip", and it turns out just fine!
