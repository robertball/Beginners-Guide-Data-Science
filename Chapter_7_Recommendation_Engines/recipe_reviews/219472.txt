Why are there only 5 stars? This recipe deserves 10! So much better than the canned soup version. Everyone declared it a hit, and hubby said it was the star of the meal. Made this exactly per the video instructions, and will do it again next year. I assembled it the day before, brought it up to room temp. while the turkey baked, then added the topping and popped it into the oven while the bird was resting. Gluten free Panko crumbs worked perfectly. Do use good quality Parmigiana-Reggiano cheese, it matters in this recipe.  Kudos to Chef John for updating a very tired classic. Thank you!

Made this for Thanksgiving.  Loved Chef John's video tutorial.  "2 Large yellow onions" was hard to judge for me.  Here in TX we grow 'em BIG.  I ended up using 2 pans to caramelize the plethora of onions.  Still, I used them all in the dish, when one of those biggies would have sufficed.  I used 1% milk and slightly less flour (my hand guesstimate was off).  It didn't thicken quite as much as I thought it would.  This could be due to my flour mismanagement or the 1% milk.  It worked fine in the dish, it just didn't give that soupy-creamy texture that is found when making the recipe using soup from a can.  Also, didn't have sherry vinegar so just used sherry on the onions.  Mmmm.  The Panko and Parm-Reggi was delightfully tasty.  The Gruyere added a nice bite and depth.  However, that cheese is really pricey.  I may make it with a less expensive brand next time.  The flavor of this dish was as wonderful as I thought it would be.  What with all the chopping of my BIG onions and the green beans, the caramelizing and sauce cooking, and cheese shredding, this recipe is a bit time consuming and labor intensive.  But the end result is elegant, tasty and gave me pride that I didn't do the soup version of this classic casserole.  Thanks Chef John!

If you are wanting a more decadent green bean casserole other than the regular boring soup kind, this is it!  This is one of my favorites now!  I pretty much went exactly by the recipe except I flavored the white sauce with a little onion and garlic powders and used canned green beans instead of fresh.  I was making a big turkey dinner with this, so I prepared it all the day before.  I assembled it all together except the topping and refrigerated it.  Once I was ready to cook I pulled it out of the refrigerator and topped it with the topping and put in the oven.  It was great!  It turned out nice and creamy and full of flavor!  With the caramelized onions in this, you won't miss those crunchy ones that are normally on top.  But Im sure you could still add those and it would give it another depth of flavor if you love them like I do.  The gruyere cheese is expensive and honestly if you go with a cheaper swiss or even a gouda cheese, it would taste just as good.  So don't get scared away with an expensive cheese because it will still be great with something cheaper!  Thanks Chef John for this delicious casserole!  I will be definitely making again!

I was looking for a way to make the traditional 'green bean casserole' without having to resort to using the stuff from a can as I have to cook gluten-free. This version is way better and my taste buds were pleased! Yes--the cheese is pricey (I paid $4.99 for 4 oz) but it marries all the ingredients together perfectly -- savory and sweet. I didn't have access to fresh green beans and used 2 lbs of frozen -- I cooked them 2 minutes less than the package specified to avoid them getting mushy. I also don't keep milk in the house and substituted half-half. Of course, more calories and fat but the sauce was rich and creamy; I used rice flour to make the roux -- 4 tbsp. For the top, I used Kinnikinnick gluten free panko bread crumbs. This recipe is definitely a keeper in my household!

This recipe was the hit of the big dinner party which included a delicious rack of pork and cheesy, fantastic scalloped potatoes. It's rather a lot of work, but I followed the recipe EXCEPT for adding 1/2 lb of cooked, chopped bacon (divided) to both layers of the onions. I used the fresh haricot verts (fresh green beans) from Trader Joe's. Oh boy, this is a guaranteed hit - go for it!!

This recipe is not worth the time or effort. It has some decent flavors, but nothing that really makes it worth it. It looks good, smells good and tastes mediocre. We love green bean casserole and were hoping this would be better then other versions. It's not and with all the amazing ingredients it's almost baffling. Like they wash each other out somehow. Just remember this review when your kicking yourself after laboring for nothing =)

It came out exactly how it looked on the video and the taste was AMAZING!!
I was never a fan for green bean casserole but, with this recipe I am a convert
I needed a recipe.  I got stuck with making this as a side dish for a dinner party.
My hubby won't eat veggies to save his life, he had second's and third's, if there were any left he would have requested left over's too. It was a huge hit, this recipe is a keeper no need to look any further.

The wife and I were surprised by the savory flavor. I believe it has a lot to do with the caramelized yellow onions. Am going to try it next time with sweet onion (like Vidalia) and see what happens. Yes, it is a little labor intensive, but really worth the effort!

Nobody except my husband liked this at the Thanksgiving table. I thought it was pretty good, just not worth the effort that I put into it. Hate to say it, but I'll probably go back to the canned soup version.

I cut the recipe in half as my plants have only given my 1 lb of green beans so far.  But otherwise I went by the book and this was delicious!  Those caramelized onions are a revelation!

I made this for Thanksgiving because I didn't want to used french fried onions. It took longer than I expected it to, but it was delicious! My whole family loved it, even the people who don't normally like green beans. I used cheddar cheese instead of Gruyere cheese because that is what we had on hand. I also didn't add any cayenne pepper or thyme(because we didn't have any on hand). The video really helped me to know how long to cook the onions, since I've never done it before.
Overall I love it.

Everyone loved this recipe. I agree with Kathy...the cheese is very pricey...but so worth it. Everything is fresh, nothing from a can. I just wish I took a picture to show how beautiful it turned out.

Loved the taste of this! A little time consuming to make, but it was well worth it - it has now become my holiday side dish, wouldn't want to make it frequently, so I put it on the special menu.

I've made this successfully twice during the holiday season a few years ago and made it for Thanksgiving 2019. Came out perfectly and I watched adults going back for seconds... not the kids tho.  Had a tough time finding sherry vinegar, but finally succeeded on the 4th grocery I visited. Keep forgetting to take pics. ??

Made this for Easter dinner and everybody liked it! Used most of the ingredients that I had. Never made green bean casserole before but thought I would try it and was very happy with it. Thanks! I'll make it again someday....

A big hit. I used quartered onions which tasted fine, but was more difficult to caramelize evenly and spread evenly? The texture of the larger onion pieces was a good balance to the beans, though some bites had more onion than others (which was more interesting to me). I was liberal with cayenne, which we all liked: it showed up as the last layer of taste in my mouth. 4 minutes of blanching the beans resulted in the beans being slightly crunchy, which we liked.

EXCELLENT! Thanks Chef John for a very delicious recipe. I made this  as a side dish to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we couldn't get enough of it. I used Swiss cheese as that is what I had on hand. It is well worth the effort and I strongly recommend it to  anyone who appreciates a good meal at home.

Made for Christmas dinner party and was a hit! I added porcini mushrooms to bring out the mushroom flavor.  Had to compete against the original Campbell's recipe with mushroom soup and healthy stir fried beams.  This version came out as no 1.

This is an attractive and  wonderful side dish; as Chef John says, "Delicious!"  The portion was too large for just the two of us, but the recipe halves nicely. I didn't have sherry vinegar so used apple vinegar and made my own bread crumbs, but otherwise followed the recipe. Green beans are one of my wife's least favorite veggies but she really likes these. I'll definitely make this again and again.

I wanted to try a new and improved green bean casserole for Thanksgiving. No one in my family liked this recipe and I was sorry I spent the extra money on the ingredients. I ended up throwing it in the garbage.

This dish was delicious!!! I was quite pleasantly surprised!! We don't drink regular milk in our home, so I used half&half and it tasted slightly rich, it was VERY tasty good!  My man is vegetarian and it can be a challenge making new dishes for him.  He is a very critical and picky eater; needless to say, he enjoyed the dish!  This dish is a keeper....!

I made this.
  I have also made the "traditional Green bean Cassarole". 
 Through the years, GB cassarole has been a "custom" in our Thanksgiving, AND Christmas menu.

I have NEVER liked the taste of theis traditional family "MUSH/nasty flavor. EVER".  We all work hard to cook , and prepare food, at family gatherings, and work hard for money to pay for for food, to prepare.
 Thanks Chef John:-)). This "TWIST" has made "greenbean Cassarole"  not only edible, but actually yummy :)

I made this for Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it. I did make some changes; making it gluten free by substituting a G-F thickener for the all-purpose flour in the white sauce, and I used G-F Panko for the topping. I used two 1 lb. bags of frozen French sliced green beans and put them in boiling water for about 30 seconds to take the chill off the beans. Also, instead of Gruyere used Gouda cheese.  No one missed the traditional Green Bean Casserole.

My family loved it, I didn’t make the bechamel sauce rather I used cream of mushroom soup. Since I went this route, not only did I caramelize the onions, but I also sweated a pack of cremini mushrooms to tie it together. The last touch was topping the grueyer, fresh French bread crumbs, parmesan, with Frenches Fried Onions.

This is really good.  Made according to recipe except for the fresh green beans and sherry vinegar. The fresh green beans available did not look that great so I  substituted with 2 cans of low sodium cut  green beans and did not have sherry  vinegar nor could I find it in the grocery  store so I substituted with some wine vinegar and Harvey's Bristol Cream Sherry.  Will definitely make again.

I randomly found this recipe about 5 years ago and made it, no changes to the recipe, for a big family Christmas Eve dinner. Everyone loved it and continues to request I make it for every holiday. They all say it's the best green bean casserole they've ever had.

Everyone raves about this casserole.  I started using this recipe about 3 years ago; now this is my go to recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  My adult children specifically ask for "Mom's Green Bean Casserole" Thank you, Chef John!  Gruyere Cheese and  freshly grated Parmesan make this dish special.  I use one part heavy cream and one part milk for a thicker sauce. A few more calories, but worth it.  Sauteing sliced mushrooms for the sauce, makes it even better. I cook the green beans just a little longer than specified- Not crisp- But not over cooked. YUM!

This casserole was truly delicious! Well worth the time it takes to prepare. I added finely chopped mushrooms to mine(my husband hates them)and halved the recipe and we still have lots left over for tomorrow.I used lactose free milk because that was all I had on hand. Hubby loved it.

Made it for my family today for Thanksgiving (Canadian) and everyone loved it, including my husband who informed me before that he didn't like green bean casseroles, and why was I trying something new when company is coming?   He loved it!!  Followed the recipe exactly (wow, that gruyere is expensive, but worth it)  Love Chef John - Thank you.

There were a lot of little steps to this recipe, but overall, it was fairly easy to cook and assemble. I did substitute Butter Cheese when I made it because I have a few picky people in my family, but let me tell you, my family and I were completely blown away with how awesome this casserole was! It was beautiful to present at the Easter table, it smelled wonderful, and it tasted amazing! This is a must-try! It did make a ton of casserole, so I will probably half the recipe next time I have a small group, although the reheated casserole was just as amazing!!

This was soooo good. The only change I'm planning to make is to double the amount of ingredients to make the sauce.  The beans were a little dry because of a lack of sauce, but they were still delicious.

I made modifications and I will make this again.  I followed the recipe, but added French Fried onions I crushed  about one cup.   A quarter cup of crushed onions on the bottom along with the caramelized onions.  And to the topping I used 1/3 cup Panko and 3/4 cup crushed Panko and sauté in pan (no butter needed) just to toast lightly.    I left out  the Parmesan.  But use the gruyere.  Love, love, loved the gruyere cheese.

It was a lot more work and the taste was comparable to the traditional dish. It took me at least half an hour to carmelize the onions. It looked nice and I usually prefer homemade to cans but the taste was not that outstanding. The only difference was that I added a little more gruyere because it came in an 8 oz pkg.

Do not skip the Sherry Vinegar. I did because I couldn't find it at the store. What a disaster. A very time consuming and expensive dish wasted basically because it was so bland. I think it had to have been the missing Sherry Vinegar. So don't be a Katie, follow the recipe to the T!!

This was good but time consuming.  I cut this in half so put all the onions on the bottom, then mixed the green beans and sauce together, and poured over the onions.  I also mixed some fried onions in with the panko topping.

Its a bit bland. I added fresh thyme and garlic as well as chicken bullion but still didn't quite get the flavor of classic green bean casserole I was expecting.

Great. Crispy onions amazing. Didn't have enough green beans so cut down on some of the other ingredients and it still came out great. Will definitely make it again. Thank you Chef John for this veggie dish.

This was amazing. Made it just as it said but I do like mushrooms in my green bean casserole so I added some sautéed mushrooms.  What a difference from using the old mushroom soup and fried canned onions recipe!

I really liked the recipe, but overall, you need to use a properly sized pan to get all the ingredients condensed together for the cheese to melt through.  I used a 9 x 13 pan. A 3 qt. dish is better suited.  

Also, I found this recipe a little too rich for some people, but I loved it.  So, your experience will depend on your tastes as well.

Also, the recipe is very process intensive.  You're almost cooking three recipes and combining them in the end.  It's definitely not a standard quick weekday item.

Rich, cheesy with the Panco topping a nice counterpoint. We used Walla Walla sweet onions that I had caramelized and froze in June. We will definitely make this again.

Was looking for a recipe without the mushrooms, since some in the family won't eat them,  this filled the bill very nicely.  It's a lot to do all at once when busy @ the holidays with other food etc. so I did w/this what I do with other time consumers.  I split the tasks according to how much time I have .  One day carmelized the onions and put in refrig. another day shredded the cheese, you get the idea.  By the time you actually put it together many of the steps are done so it goes pretty quickly.  Will certainly make again.

I used two boxes of gluten free cream of chicken soup and some dried mushrooms that I reconstituted. Used the mushroom water and cream for the liquid. I had smoked guoda cheese so that is what I used in place of the gruyere but I did go buy some parmigiano reggiano.
I couldn’t find the sherry vinegar so used a little sherry and a little white balsamic vinegar. It only calls for a tablespoon so it probably wouldn’t have made a large difference if I’d left it out.
Everybody raved about this dish and I will for sure make it again.

My first attempt at a green bean casserole and it turned out wonderfully.  In the past I've shied away from the common green bean in cream of mushroom soup, so when I saw this particular recipe I knew I wanted to try it. 

Since we only had a small number of Thanksgiving guests (6) I made a 1/2 recipe, and based on some of the comments used a thicker white sauce and bumped the seasoning up a bit.  I also added a few fresh mushrooms since... well it just seemed like the thing to do. 

I  was very worried about cooking something for guests without trying it first, but I need not have worried. Everyone loved it and the dish was scrapped clean.  A wonderful addition to the traditional Thanksgiving side dishes (without the soup).

Made this for Thanksgiving, it makes a LOT. It was delicious!  It's kinda time consuming to make, so I did it the day before except for the breadcrumbs and cheese topping. I'll be making this again for a Holiday dinner with friends.

I had to adjust this to make it gluten-free for myself but the rest of my family (they all eat gluten) absolutely loved this as much as I did!  Other substitutions were for allergens  and convenience.
I only used one onion, next time I'll use two as listed.  I substituted white wine vinegar for the sherry vinegar.
I substituted 2 tablespoons of buckwheat flour plus 1 tsp arrowroot for the flour. I used only a pinch of cayenne, but next time I'll try a little more.  The thyme was not ground but I really liked the texture it added.  I went easy on the milk, but will use the full amount next time.  I skipped the breadcrumbs altogether (no regrets there).  For cheese, I used a combination of goat cheese from Holland and freshly grated pecorino romano cheese.
After making the sauce on the stovetop, I had to finish it in the microwave as the oven was otherwise occupied.   Then just before it went on the table, I added Gluten-free French-Fried Onions (ingredients: buckwheat flour, palm oil, onions and salt).   Next time, I hope to finish it in the oven.
My family loved it and I look forward to making it again.  After making a fairly standard GB Casserole for decades, this is probably going to be our new tradition.

Made no changes (unusual for me!) yummy!  A little bit of work, but worth it.   The gruyere really made it .  Well worth the price!.  Also, did not have sherry vinegar, so used red wine vinegar.  Did not have thyme, , used Italian seasoning.   It may have changed the taste, but was great!

I tried out this recipe for a large family gathering and didn't want to use canned soup recipes - wanted something different but not a big production.   Followed recipe except i didn't have nutmeg and cayenne pepper.   For me, it was a little flat in flavor but well received.   it could've been even better with nutmeg and cayenne pepper.  Will try again.

Not very good; I followed the recipe and ended up with a very dry, relatively tasteless casserole. If I ever had to make it again, I'd double the recipe for the white sauce, and maybe include cream of mushroom soup to add moisture and flavor. This took a good amount of work but was not a hit on Thanksgiving Day.

I halved the recipe, and followed it to a T...I usually love Chef John’s recipes, but this one...not so much...it was bland. My guests like it, but they did not rave about it...next time, if there is a next time, I would reduce the amount of green beans, (and perhaps cook them a bit longer), triple the amount of onions, and cook it for less time in the oven. I forgot to say, I did not use the cayenne, as I don’t like hot food...perhaps that is why it was bland?

This has to be the very best green bean casserole ever! We had 14 people for dinner on Thanksgiving.  Every single person raved about it.  One of the guests told me that he does not like green beans but took some to be polite.  He then went back for seconds.  He declared it  his favorite side dish, and we did have some great ones.  I would not change a thing except to maybe put more onions in the next time I make it.

I made this today to switch it up from my usual green bean casserole.  It took me about 1 1/2 hours to make rather than the 15 minutes it typically takes to open various cans and mix together befor baking. This recipe was savory and delicious and the cheese was amazing.  The taste was great but allow yourself plenty of time to make it.

I used the exact recipe except that I changed the servings. I had to make more béchamel sauce and it needed plenty of salt. I probably cooked the green beans longer than the recipe says but I didn’t want them crunchy. It was really very good but I believe I would save it for a special occasion.

Not a good flavor blend for our taste ... too bland.  Also, the beans weren't tender enough for this type of casserole (I cooked them five+ minutes), and it was a little dry too.  Definitely wasn't worth the cost of the gruyere cheese. Don't think I'll make again.

Absolutely the best green bean casserole I have ever made! The star of Christmas dinner!  I will never go back to the canned version of this casserole, and I don't think my husband would let me!  Delicious in every way!

I liked it, but if I use this recipe again, I will omit the cheese and the cayan/red pepper, as I felt they took away from the integrity of a true green bean casserole. Instead, I plan to add a little red wine and a dash of Worcestershire to my sauce. And maybe some mushrooms, I missed them! Oh and those crispy onions instead of breadcrumbs! Way more fun. :-)

Very, very good.

We made this for Thanksgiving and really enjoyed it.  Definitely a little fancier than traditional recipes made with canned soup, etc.  Will be making again, especially for holidays.

Delicious recipe. It does require a certain organization before starting to cook. I made sure I had all my ingredients measured and ready to go before I started. I didn't have Sherry Vinegar so I substituted Sherry. I, also, used well rinsed canned green beans. It did take a bit of time. I was glad I prepared this the day before Thanksgiving. It would have overwhelmed me to make this dish while trying to get everything else done. I was nervous about making the sauce but it went perfectly. It did take a few minutes longer than the recipe indicated...but well worth the effort. I will definitely make this again. Next year I will make and take to our large family gathering. Puts the old durkee casserole to shame!

We went to 3 different towns but couldn't find Gruyere. Used Colby-Jack instead and it still came out great. My step-daughter who is a good cook loved it as well as the rest of us.

Love this recipe. I Don't use the vinegar though and I am going to try to add Italian bread crumbs along with the other next time. I do use the cayenne and add a pinch of curry.

Good, solid recipe, nice depth of flavor but it was missing "something" so next time will tinker with the seasonings.  Maybe add some Worcestershire?  It is a rich dish with the white sauce and cheese;  richer than the canned mushroom soup version.

OK I'm a convert. I'll never go back to the canned soup recipe. I made a small trial prior to Thanksgiving. 
What a difference the carmalized onions, cream sauce & fresh cheeses made! So rich & flavorful. Only revisions: I used canned french style beans which my family prefers & canned fried onions instead of Panko topping, which eliminated 2 steps of the recipe, still delicious. Thanks for the Keeper.

This was hands-down the best green bean casserole I've ever had. I made a few small changes. Had to use gluten free ingredients, but those worked fine. I doubled the spices in the bechamel sauce. I diced and pan-fried some ham and then sprinkled it on top before putting on the bread crumbs and remaining cheese (between the ham, gruyere, bechamel, and onions it felt very Belgian). Took this to a Thanksgiving potluck and it was completely eaten. I was sad I didn't get seconds.

We LOVED this and have had it for several Thanksgiving dinners. My kids insist on those canned fried onions, so I give in for the holiday, but I prefer the caramelized onions.

I love this recipe for the holidays. No changes,  perfect as it is. Definitely an effort to make but has become a Christmas-dish-staple. So much better than the old canned bean slop! You will impress guests with this one!

Made This for thanksgiving for a change instead of my usual boring green bean casserole. My guests and I thought it was amazing.  The combination of the caramelized onions and the zip of the gruyere and parm cheese was heaven. Then the topping gave it the perfect crunchiness. This will be my go to green bean casserole from this time forward.
