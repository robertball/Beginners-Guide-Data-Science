Step 3 does not mention about adding the evaporated milk so don't forget to add it.  I made this for a Christmas Eve party and everyone enjoyed it.

A very good Mac & Cheese. I may cut back the eggs to one or two next time and add a little more milk to keep it less firm and more saucy.

This was delicious.  I made it w/o the evaporated milk b/c I forgot it b/c it wasn't listed in the directions, only in the list of ingredients, but it was still wonderful.  I had nothing left at the end of the meal.

I used 4 tbs butter and some flour and made a roux, then added the evap milk to make a white sauce.  Then I melted the processed cheese in this, added the eggs and sour cream that I had wisked together, then added the cheese and cooked mac.  I also added chopped ham bits, the rest of the seasoning and threw it in the oven.  I think it turned out awesome!!  It turns out the season salt is KEY to the great taste, it takes the edge off the sour cream flavor.  I also just used random cheese that needed to be used in addition that it called for.

I gave this 4 stars because it does need to be tweeked slightly. I only use 2 eggs and omit the velveeta cheese on top. It's so cheesey as it is! This is our fav mac n cheese in my house now and I add things to it sometimes. The best is 1/2 lb of turkey bacon, cubed and microwaved then added to the mix before baking. I also like to add broccoli florets too.

Easy to make. I doubled the recipe and it was a Huge hit it for my party. For easy clean up I used a disposable aluminum tray and was perfect to toss out EMPTY tray. I didn't use as much cheese and also added diced up grilled Spam into it. So good!!!

I wouldnt say it was the best mac n cheese but it was ok. Mine was a little dry for me i was hoping it was gonna be more creamy ill play around with the recipe maybe add more milk and less eggs. Also it was a little bland for me needs wayyyy more seasoning!! I did crumble bacon on the top that was the best part!

I know it is never done but my mother always put diced onion in mac and cheese and I do too.  Gives it such a sweet, cheesy taste.  Everyone always comments about the onions and how good it is.  Give it a try.

You can really tweak the ingredients and still come out with great results. I didn't have 16 oz. of sour cream, but I did have 8 oz. of greek yogurt. I hate only using 1 cup of evaporated milk, especially when it comes in a 12 oz. can, so I used the whole can. I used whatever cheese I had on hand, which wasn't enough but used Velveta processed cheese to get up to the 4-cup cheese requirement. I only used 1 tsp. of white pepper and 1 tsp. of garlic salt (instead of seasoning salt--whatever that is) for seasoning. I still drizzled the butter on top before baking, but next time around I think I'll add it to the milk/cheese mixture just to save a step. The texture was still firm and allowed perfect service slicing. But somehow the creaminess of the cheese still came through. The crusted macaroni around the edges really added a pleasant texture! Will definitely make this again!

This is a good Mac n Cheese but I still prefer a different recipe. I was thinking this would be less expensive (and it was).

I mixed a cup of panko bread crumbs with about 2 tablespoons of melter butter and sprinkled them on the top before I put it in the oven. Yummy! Oh, and I used 2 eggs instead of 4.

This is a very cheesy macaroni and cheese. Very good but it was more like like cheese sauce with a
Macaroni added as an afterthought. I made no modifications.

This recipe turned out awesome!! I tested it to make sure it was what I was going for—it passed the test, so I’m remaking it next week. I may leave out the velveeta cheese on the top next time around and substitute regular shredded cheese.

I changed this recipe a bit (why it got 4 stars). First, I halved it, and used 1lb cooked and drained ground beef to make a cheeseburger mac. I also used shredded provolone on top instead of processed cheese-much better!!

This was the best mac n cheese I've ever had! Will definitely make it again. The only con I that I can think of is that there might be a little to much of a pepper taste to it for some people.

There's a lot of room for adding that personal touch to this excellent recipe. User —klassylady2006 suggested diced onion and I couldn't agree more. Someone else suggested less egg, more dairy -another suggestion I've taken as well. This is a solid basic recipe to play with.

I've made this recipe twice and both times my man and I really enjoyed it. Plus it's easy. The first time I added some real bacon pieces (I think I used a whole package). The bacon was a good addition. The second time, I cut the recipe in half (the whole was too much for just the two of us) and used a 6cup baking dish which worked well. Also, I used cut-up pepper jack cheese instead of the shredded cheddar/jack cheese blend which made the recipe even better! For anyone who likes a little kick, I definitely recommend using pepper jack!!

I thought it was a good recipe but VERY peppery. I would suggest doing 1 teaspoon of pepper (or less), not two. If your not a salt person either, cut the salt in half too. Otherwise, it was good!
