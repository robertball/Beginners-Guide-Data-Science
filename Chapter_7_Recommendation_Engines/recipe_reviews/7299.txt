After reading the reviews, I decided to buy a pineaple box cake mix. I followed the directions to make the cake (3 eggs and 1 can crushed pineapple with juice)but decided to make a pineapple upside down cake.
I put 1/2 stick melted butter and 3/4 cup brown sugar in the 9x13 pan then placed 2-8 oz cans of drained pineapple tidbits (didn't have rings) and lots of marashino cherries. Then poured the batter on top. It baked at 350 close to 50 minutes or so...I kept baking til the center raised as high as the sides...it came out as moist as can be for all the baking...and has that extra pineapple taste, too.

If you like pineapple upside down cake you'll like this.  It tastes the same to me.  I took it for a potluck and there was no leftovers.  My husband and daughter didn't even get to try it.  I made it again a couple days later for them and it lasted only a day.  This will be one of my new favorites.  If I ever want a pineapple upside down cake and don't have a lot of time this is what I'll make for sure.

I read other reviews and so I added a carton of fruitcake fruits and about 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  It was moist, delicious and so different and easy.  Will be making this again.

I got GREAT ratings from my friends after we ate this cake.  I made some changes and I just wanted to let you know if ou wanted to try it. 
use: 2 cups crushed pineapples w/ juice; 1 cup mashed bananas; 1/2 cup sugar; and only 2 eggs; then top w/ choc. frosting!  It is great you gotta try it!

Tastes good, not too sweet. But you might want to add a little more milk or water. Not too much though.

I thought this cake was good.  I used a regular cake mix and added a can of mandrian oranges.  I also used a bundt cake pan, and had to cook for at least 45 min.  The cake was very moist and tasty.

This recipe was amazing! I made it with the following changes: generously buttered the 9x13 pan and sprinkled 1/4 cup brown sugar over the bottom. Topped brown sugar with sliced pineapple and scattered blueberries over the slices. Topped with the cake mix/pineapple mixture to which I added some ground flax seed meal for texture and moisture. Baked around 40 minutes and the resulting cake needed no frosting at all. The sliced fruit and berries added all the color and flavor one could hope for. This would be great with any fruit on the bottom, fabulous flavor and texture.

With my modifications it's 5 stars.  Used pineapple cake with the crushed pineapple and eggs.  Did butter and brown sugar with more pineapple on the bottom.  Mine was done in 40 minutes and was very very moist and very pineappl-y.  YUM!

I changed this recipe but for the better!!! I used white cake, 3 eggs, and raspberries!! I added 1/2 cup raspberries to the batter. I made a frosting out of 4 oz cream cheese, 4 oz crushed pineapple, (dryed with a paper towel, no juice)1/2 cup butter, 2 cups of powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract, but it wasn't very stiff. I decorated the cake with raspberries. I think I will use this recipe over and over again with diffrent fruits!! Blueberries, peaches, strawberries....the possibilities are endless!!

This was goof for a snack cake however the texture and flavor were not what I had expected.  I followed the recipe exactly - however I added a powdered sugar glaze on top (powdered sugar, water and pineapple exract.)

This was a great recipe. I added a can of mandarin orange segments, drained and a little orange zest. I topped it with the coconut cream cheese frosting (here on allrecpies)with some orange zest added to that.

I followed the recipe exactly since it was the first time having made it & for a cake that uses all of 3 whole ingredients, it was great. No adjustments needed. Why add 10 more ingredients when the point of the recipe is that it only uses 3 items from the pantry? When I make it again, I'll bake it in two 8" round pans instead of the 9" pans. Would have liked the layers to be thicker. Frosted with the Cream Cheese Frosting II that was great. Didn't frost the sides. Kinda rustic but really good. Not too much sweet to take a way from the cake.

A great basic recipe!  I can think of so many ways to modify this recipe... this time I stirred some frozen mixed berries into the batter first (and added some baking time). I also added a little vanilla and a little coconut extract.  Delicious!  Next time I'll put some brown sugar and extra pineapple in the bottom first, and add a hint of orange extract.

This recipe was extra simple and delicious. I even left it in the oven too long and it was still moist and tasty. I made it in a bundt pan and topped it with a little powdered sugar glaze and it was very pretty. Try this one.

I followed the recipe as is except I used Duncan Hines' Pineapple cake mix and as written I give it a 5! Also a 5 for easiness. Will make it again. Thank you! Oh, and one other thing, I topped the cake with a glaze - using left over pineapple juice and powder sugar. Mixed the two together and poured over the cake while hot - awesome possum! =D

I followed the recipe and then sprinkled powdered sugar on top once cooled. Simple and liked by most. However, nobody went back for seconds so I probably won't make it again.

This cake is really tasty and very, very moist.  So much so that I had to make it twice.  Because the first time, I made two layers (for a birthday cake) and they crumbled apart out of the pans!!!  :D  The second time, I used the 13x9 inch pan suggested to a much better result.  Will definitely make again.  I gave the recipe 4 stars due to the pan constraint.  The cake itself is worthy of 5 stars.

Not surprisingly this cake has a custardy taste.  I topped with crushed pecans and baked.  The easy part is exactly right.  Good cake, just not what I expected.

Everyone in our house loves pineapple upside down cake, but I don't always have time to make one. This super easy recipe was a great alternative.

I was looking for a easy pineapple cake and this was it. I did not have 20 ounce can, I add it small can of tropical fruit mix. I will definetly make it again. Next time all the batter may make it into pan.

Like someone else did, I give this 4 stars because it's not extra special, but still a very easy, tasty recipe.
I couldn't find a "reduced fat" boxed cake mix, but I did make the cake without the oil that the cake-box recipe uses, so hopefully I achieved the same results, more or less. This was super easy to make, and very moist. I appreciated that it wasn't too sweet. Since I'm single, this whole cake lasted me about 5 days, but it was worth it.

Our whole family loved this! I am only giving it 4 stars because it wasn't anything extra special, but still a very good recipe. I had an orange cake mix, so I used that and the added flavor was terrific. I also added a small can of mandarine oranges and a tablespoon of milk. I used an egg substitute of whites only to keep the cholesterol down for my husband. We topped the warm cake with whipped cream! Yum!
