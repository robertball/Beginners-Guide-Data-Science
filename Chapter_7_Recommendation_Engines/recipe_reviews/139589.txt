This is a great recipe.  It's very sweet.  Tastes exactly like the original.  This is definitely a keeper.

I had gotten some as a gift and ran and and was able to find this recipe to make some more...good stuff. If your not a splenda fan just use any sweetener you like. I used just plan sugar and it was great. Deffantly a keeper.

this recipe was easy to follow, at best okay for me. My kids loved it. I didn't find it sweet at all. However it was flavorful, add more for a more intense drink experience then author recommends. I remember my dad making something like this but having red hot candy in it. Other wise, I'll make this again.

I make a batch of this every fall. Warms me up in the evening during the long winter months.
