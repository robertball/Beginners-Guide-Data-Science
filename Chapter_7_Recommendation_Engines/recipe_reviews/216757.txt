I really enjoyed this recipe and have now made this twice with only a few minor changes. I used only a small amount of butter and a bit of olive oil to saute the garlic and added some scallions. I also used both both scallops and large uncooked shrimp cooked with a bit of white wine and fresh squeezed lemon juice. Instead of cream I added a wedge of laughing cow lite cheese to thicken the sauce along with the freshly grated parmesean cheese. In a separate pan I cooked asparagus and a small amount of angel hair pasta cooked together with more basil and parsley and lemon juice. Once that was cooked I cut up the asparagus and added that along with the pasta to the scallops and shrimp. The second time I made this I used risotto and added the asparagus to the risotto. Both were delicious. I will definitley be making this often. Thank you Jim!

this was excellent!  I skipped the pasta and served them over some steamed spinach and they were delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow. I was so disappointed in this recipe. I followed it exactly and thought it came out bland and tasteless (even after doubling the garlic). I also have a ton leftover.

I never understand how people write about how great a recipe is - but only after they have made so many changes to it that it no longer represents the original recipe. I made this and LOVED it.  I am serving it to my whole family today with a huge salad and bread.

This was a great recipe. We tried it out but added a slight twist. We released the flavours of the garlic with a little unroasted sesame oil and set it all aside. We then brushed the scallops with a little unroasted sesame oil (due to its high smoking point) and set it onto the pan at high heat for some great colour. Once the scallops were done, we took them out and set them on the pasta. We then deglazed the pan with the lemon juice, and the butter and put in the rest of the ingredients. When everything mixed well together, we poured it all on top of the scallops and pasta and garnished with a little more fresh parsley and basil and sprinkled grana padano over it. Delish and thanks for the original recipe. We hope we didn't offend anyone by giving it a slight twist.

This was very good and easy to make quickly.  I used 2 tsp butter with 1/4 cup clam juice and added mushroom pieces with the parsley and basil.  Next time will add some crab and peas as well.  Great  one pot recipe!  Thank you!

Love this dish! A regular feature for dinner at our place. Easy, fresh ingredients, tasty. Like all good simple meals, it only tastes as good as your worst ingredient. Use very good pasta, fresh sea scallops, fresh herbs and excellent parmesan (i dont use cream, and i use macadamia oil rather than butter for a healthier option). Beautiful - thank you Jim

This was super easy and really good.  The only thing I did different was add cream cheese instead of heavy cream, which was the only creamy thing I had in the house.  I used penne pasta. Everyone loved this and it will be made again!

I made this last night and was delighted with the light, fresh favors. Note "light"--this is not a recipe for those of you looking for an Alfredo or other rich, thick sauce, nor one where the sauce makes the pasta swim. Here, the sauce subtly coats the pasta and scallops. I was surprised to see some reviewers say they had to double or even triple the sauce; to me, that would result in overpowering the scallops' natural sweetness. if you like a little more lemon flavor, I could certainly see adding more juice,, but ever so slight.

I made this tonight for myself and it was incredibly easy and delicious.  I did use all fresh ingredients (which I think makes it so tasty)  but substituted half the butter for a little olive oil!

So simple and easy but full of great flavor. I didn't have the fresh herbs on hand so had to used dried but the taste was still super. I used small scallops (previously frozen, not fresh) but they cooked just fine according to recipe instructions for larger scallops. I will make this again and can't wait it for lunch tomorrow.

Very good.  I used half and half and added about 3/4 cup because I had it leftover from another recipe.  I put fresh shredded parm directly in my simmering sauce. I threw in two handfuls of fresh spinach because I'm always trying to increase our veggie intake! Since the sauce seemed a little thin, I thickened it with a tablespoon of corn starch. Great recipe, I can't wait to have the leftovers.

Very tasty. First time 'by the book,' the next time tweaked by the addition of shrimp, sherry & more garlic. In both cases, I used 'previously frozen' scallops. In the second, I poured off the broth and reduced it in a separate pan by about 75% to concentrate the flavor & thicken the liquid. Then I added the sherry, cream & lemon, quickly blending it before returning to the main pan & finishing the dish. The thicker sauce, as tweaked, makes it close to a '5' - certainly 95%. I will greatly increase the fresh herbs next time (especially the basil); their flavors are overwhelmed. The basil is an outstanding addition.

Wonderfully easy, but need to triple the sauce ...both butter and cream... and garlic to make enough sauce for the pasta with sufficient flavor.  Basic method is great...just need to increase ingredients and flavor.  A quick fix for a simple wonderful result.

This was so easy and yummy.  I put the pasta right in the pan with the sauce and it evenly distrusted that way.  We will be making this again!

Pretty basic recipe, but tasty nonetheless. 2 pounds of scallops is a stupid huge amount. After finishing a bowl there were so many scallops in my bowl I had no interest in finishing. I'll remake it with 1 pound and I'm sure itll be much more balanced

I wasn’t in a pasta mood, so I served this over rice. 
Don’t worry if you are out of fresh basil and parsley as it works well with a teaspoon of each from your spice rack. 
A new family favorite!

Really enjoyed this very fresh tasting dish! It’s a great way to use fresh herbs and I was very generous with the amount of basil and parsley I used from my garden, though I added both when the scallops were about 1/2 way cooked.   I also used extra lemon juice to make sure I had plenty of sauce.  I did use heavy cream but not the full amount called for.  I just eye balled it until I was happy with the consistency.   Watch the scallops closely while cooking and you can see them go from a pinkish color to more of a white when they are cooked through.  Next time I will probably cut back on the amount of butter to lower the fat in the dish.

Absolutely delicious!   I made it for my husband and he totally enjoyed it.   I did add some shrimps...I sautéed the shrimp first till they were just done, took them out of the pan and then added the scallops, sautéed them also till done and then proceeded with the recipe. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat.   I did add the cream and we really enjoyed this recipe and will make again.    I made garlic bread to serve with it.    You will not be disappointed!  Enjoy!

Perfect. Did not need any changes. I did cut it in half because it's only my husband and I and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good, but not great. I followed the recipe exactly. I added the optional heavy cream and it made the sauce too thin and not flavorful enough. I think next time (because it was definitely good enough for a re-do!) I'll simply add less heavy cream and then perhaps remove the scallops and let it thicken a bit too. I'll definitely double the garlic and up the lemon a tad too.

I loved this and even ate the leftovers cold. I added some white wine to make the sauce a little more wet. I also added chives per the top reviewers advice. Excellent!

This recipe is so easy and tasty!  I added peas so that I didn't need a side vegetable so serve.  I also added some capers for flavor.  I didn't add the cream-I wanted a lighter dinner.  It was delicious!

I was looking for a recipe for shrimp and scallops yesterday and found this recipe.  I changed a few things, not because I wanted to change the recipe, but because of the ingredients I had on hand.  I had bay scallops (they are very small) , no fresh herbs, and no heavy cream.   I used dry herbs, a little white wine, vegetable stock, and while it was cooking it had a great flavor but was very thin.  I had no heavy cream so I added 1/3 fat philly cream cheese to finish.  Over the angel hair it was very good;  even my picky son commented on how good it was.  Thanks for the recipe.

Rated 4 star as written.  I doubled the sauce not pasta or scallops (approx 2.5lb), added peas, red pepper flakes, approx. 4Tbl. of  Sherry, lots of black pepper, kosher salt and used dried basil since that is all I had . My family loved this recipe, but next time I would lighten up on the lemon (and I LOVE lemon) and use a better cream as I only had "fat free" half and half on hand (which is a big NO NO) when it comes to cream sauces with acid.  Let's just say that it was not pretty due to the separation/curdling (MY FAULT) of the sauce, but it tasted AMAZING.   Thank you so much for this recipe, it led me to great ideas.  I wish I had fresh spinach on hand as it would be really really good incorporated in this dish. The sky is the limit.

I added shrimp and scallions. 

I wasn't too impressed with flavor.  It was rather bland. 
I ended up adding chili flakes to bring some flavors to the surface.

I used fresh clams instead of the scallops. It would be good with any fish.

I did make a few changes. I added shredded cheese right into the sauce, oregano. I did not add shrimp, simple becuase of my preference.  But otherwise I followed the recipe and it tasted amazing ??. This was my first time trying scallops and I am 15 so I am fairly picky. But it tasted amazing. Would definetly recommend it and make it again!

I will definitely  make this again. I did everything listed, including the cayenne and cream.  The only change I made was doubling the minced garlic.   Sorry, we love our garlic!!   Other than that... The recipe was virgin.   It was tasty, light and a heavenly summer meal.  Our apps were chef johns crab cake. Pasta was served with seasoned quick seared baby asparagus.   Rave reviews all around.  Some wanted more sauce.  Others did not.  So make more sauce and put it on side!!!   I used fresh Parmesan cheese that I grated.   Wow!    Adjust as needed for your family.    I knew I needed more garlic.   PLEASE MAKE THIS RECIPE WITH YOUR TASTES IN MIND.  ADJUST ACCORDINLY.   I also zested some of the lemon.  Bright , light, tasty.    Thank you.   Sea 
food night...Huge success !

I made this recipe according to the directions, but, using half scallops and half shrimp.  It was good and had a very light flavor profile.   For our pallet we prefer just a little more flavor though, so, after tasting the original sauce  I added some white wine, a touch of Dijon, and a few shakes of red pepper flakes.   That upped the flavor enough for our taste.  Very easy to prepare and the cooking time in the recipe for the seafood was perfect.

This was simple and excellent (even with skim mil in place of the cream and an increase to 2 tbsp grated parmesan.
