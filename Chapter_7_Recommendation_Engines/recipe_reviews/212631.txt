This is a wonderful dessert to take for a potluck. I took this to work and they loved it. Now I have to take it to work all the time. Yum, yum. Try it with roasted carmeled walnuts on top. Enjoy

This is pretty amazing! I tthought tomato sounded weird, but then I started thinking--it's not really any more weird than carrot, pumpkin or zucchini. I only had white cake mix, so I added a teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, with 1/2 teaspoon of cloves. I have a 5-quart crock pot, so my cook time was 1 hour 40 minutes. I didn't use the "keep warm" function, but I served it about an hour after it finished baking and it was still nice and hot. The sauce is delicious drizzled over the ice cream. Will absolutely be making this again!

This was so super simple but a bit too "spicy" meaning it had a bit too cinny-a-minny for me :) The family LOVED it and last night I had some left overs in the fridge... REALLY good cold-mellowed out some of the overpowering "spices" in the cake.
Thought the tomato soup was a typo HAHA this was super easy and I will make it again for the holidays!

Decent when fresh and warm, if a little too sweet for our tastes.  Once it's cooled however, it looses much of it's flavor.  Overall there are many better recipes to make when you want dessert.

This cake was soooo good and easy. I cooked it a little too long so I didn't get the syrup at the bottom, but it was still excellent and I could only imagine would probably be even better with a cream cheese icing. That's what I'll try next time!
