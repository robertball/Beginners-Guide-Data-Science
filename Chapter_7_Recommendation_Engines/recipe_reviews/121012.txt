This is a very delicate tasting loaf.  It has just a hint of lemon. To the batter I added the juice of half a lemon and all the rind as directed.  It's just right for this loaf.  For the glaze, I didn't use sugar, instead I used Icing sugar and lemon juice and it was perfect.  A very nice light tasting loaf.  THX.

This produced great results! My entire family enjoyed it :)
One tip about the glaze at the end: using sugar and lemon juice is fine, you don't need icing sugar. If you heat the mixture a little in a saucepan and stir until the sugar completely dissolves, then you can pour the sticky syrupy goodness perfectly well.

The loaf is really wonderful.  I agree to watch the baking time.  I did the topping just as suggested and found it to be too "crystal like" and too sweet.  The other lemon loaf recipies that I have used have icing sugar and lemon juice in the topping and that is what I will do in the future.  I also used butter instead of shortening, as "Butter makes it better".  The loaf is very tasty.  One more thing, I think that I would add a bit of lemon extract on the next go. Enjoy.

This is wonderful! I didn't add the pecans (didn't have any nuts on hand). I did add the juice of one lemon to the batter. Watch your baking time (40 minutes and mine was almost over done). Otherwise, incredibly flavorful, spongy, wonderful. After cooling for a bit and inverting on a plate, dusted with some powdered sugar. Will absolutely add this to my favorites and make again.

I love lemon so instead of using 1/2 cup of milk I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice instead. I loved it!!! but one caution, if you make the switch, reduce the cooking time or it will be burned arount the edges. Other than that, i loved it!

What a great loaf.  I made a few changes - not because the recipe needed it - but because we like a tart lemon flavour.  I used only 1 1/2 tsp of lemon peel but added 1 tbsp fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I also added 1/2 cup dried cranberries to make us feel like we are eating healthy. Baked for 55 min and it was almost too long. I should have reduced the milk by 1 tbsp to compensate for the tbsp of lemon juice because my cranberries sunk a bit. But we are still enjoying the loaf. Thanks for the recipe.  I will make this again.

No need to look any further for your Lemon Loaf!!  It's right here!  :D  Fantastically easy recipe, tasty, tasty, tasty!  I also changed the shortening to butter, and added about 2 Tablespoons lemon juice to the batter, in addition to the lemon zest.  I was compelled to take a second piece, the first was sooooo good!  I've tried others, this is THE one, hands down!  :D

My lemon loaf turned out well. I also substituted the sugar for icing sugar to coat it with lemon juice.

I thought it was great.  I followed reviews and  added 1/4 cup of lemon juice to the batter. It was a little fluffier than i normally like, but it was tasty.

I loved this recipe and it got two thumbs up from the people in my office but next time I would only use about 3/4 of the glaze and maybe just brush it on when the loaf was on a wire rack.  The glaze soaked into the loaf too much at the bottom when it was in the pan and the flavour was INTENSE in spots.

Add 1/2 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of flour too and I omited the nuts, just left it plain. For topping, lemon juice and icing sugar until runny. Yum!

This was good but only after i made changes. The first time i tried it didn't rise very much so i was disappointed with that. also the "glaze" wasn't very good. i knew using regular sugar wouldn't be the best but if you're going to review a recipe you have to follow it the first time. also the baking time is wrong. mine was finished in thirty five minutes.

the second time i added an extra egg and an extra half teaspoon of baking powder and it rose better and tasted better. i also used confectioners sugar instead of regular sugar and it was better.

i also made it with splenda/stevia and it turned out very good. however with the sugar substitute i added an extra egg, a quarter cup of evaporated soy milk and one teaspoon of baking soda.

Cook time is a little long, at least for me Mine almost burned (came out a little dark), but the recipe was fun and easy to do (although It could be written a teeny bit better, I had to make sure I was meshing directions together But I'm kinda dumb) Haven't tasted it yet but it smells wonderful! I used a different Icing recipe but I hope to try the one on here soon. TY!

I found the topping to be extremely sour. I had to cut off the whole top of the loaf as well as the sides where the glaze dripped onto. Other than that, the loaf was moist and delicious.

Quick, easy and delicious!  I added a little lemon juice to the mix just to give it a bit more flavor and drizzled the top with a powder sugar and lemon juice icing.  Big raves from the kids!!

Pretty good loaf. I expected something lighter, but the loaf is dense like a coffee cake and didn't rise as much as I'd have liked. I didn't use the glaze, and as a result the loaf wasn't as lemony as I would have liked--I should have added the juice to the loaf batter. I also substituted the sugar with Splenda (3/4 cup) and pecans with dried blueberries.

I altered the recipe as follows. Instead of just a 1/2 c milk, I also addded 1 full cup fresh lemon juice, 1 extra cup of flour and 1 tsp clear vanilla (as well as a teensy bit more baking powder) I omitted the nuts. Then I marbled it with Raspberry Pie filling (from a can), and baked for ten mins extra. (I am high altitude so this may not be necessary). It is FANTASTIC when done this way. I will definetly make this again!!!

This was a great recipe.  I doubled it and made it in a bundt pan.  It took less than an hour.  Next time I would unmold it and then pour the glaze over...maybe even punch a few deep holes first. Just the right amount of lemon for us.

I decreased the sugar in this loaf a little, and increased the margarine to 1/2 cup. I added in vanilla and coconut extracts, blueberries, and replaced the milk with cream, b/c I had some on hand that I had to use up! This resulted in a very rich, delicious cake.

Really good recipe.  I made them into mini muffins, baked for 20-25 mins.  They are a little too sweet so go easy on the sugar in the mix.  Added some cranberries and flax seed for more texture too.

Excellent recipe! Have made it twice now and it is exactly what I was looking for. Just watch the time, I only baked for 40 minutes and it was almost overdone.
