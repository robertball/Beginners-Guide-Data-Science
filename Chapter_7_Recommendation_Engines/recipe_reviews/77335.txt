Wonderful!!!!  Texture almost like a cross between a gooey brownie and cheesecake.  These are the most amazing pumpkin bars and I am always asked for the recipe.

I was looking for something a little different for my son's birthday. He does not like tradional cake. I tired it the night before, following the recipe and thought the crust was to thick and it lacked the flavor I was expeting. Others loved it though. So when I doubled the recipe I replaced the cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice and thined out the crust. It made 3- 9 x 13 pans. This was perfect served with cool whip.

These are a hit at our house! The almonds and almond extract makes them so yummy. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

Not bad - but bottom was a little dry.  Second time I wanted to try them, I had no yellwo cake mix, so used 3 cups of dry baking mix (like Bisquick) with the egg and oil for the bottom.  Not a bad substitution there either.  The top is delicious and sets up nicely.

These were bland, and the bottom cake crust cooked too quickly, making it dry and hard.

This was very easy to make. The only thing about this that I did not like was the almonds and how the crust burned. I think this would taste better with either Sliced almonds, or none at all. Also the crust burned really bad at the bottom. 

Other than that the flavor was actually really good. Not to sweet and not to plain.

This recipe was JUST what I was looking for:  more luscious than cake, easier than a pie, but just as moist and with that "crust" to go with it!  After reading reviews that it was "bland", I made it exactly according to recipe and added 1 t. pumpkin pie spice.  DELICIOUS! Also, I baked it at 350 in a convection oven for about 20 min., and it seemed almost set and browning, so I dropped it down to 325 and baked for 10-12 more minutes: Perfect!!!  Thank you!

I just made these today, and they smelled so good cooking we couldn't wait to taste them. They were still warm when we ate them, and they were wonderful. I put some whipped cream on top. The only changes I made was to leave out the nuts and I added 1/4 tea spoon of ground nutmeg with the cinnamon, and they were the best pumpkin bars we have had, even my 5 year old who usually won't touch them asked for more. I think I will make them with pumpkin pie filling next time for more spices though since I don't keep them on hand.

I was disappointed by this recipe, especially since it got pretty good reviews.  It was only so-so.  It might be good with more spices than listed, even though I doubled the cinnamon. I took it to church and was only asked by one person for the recipe. My family requested that I not make it again.  I'll keep trying the other pumpkin bar recipes before I consider making this one again.

These were excellent!  I made this instead of a traditional Pumpkin Pie for Thanksgiving dessert.  They were a HUGE hit, and SO easy to make.

Not as good as I expected but still okay. Make sure you have some Cool Whip for this!
