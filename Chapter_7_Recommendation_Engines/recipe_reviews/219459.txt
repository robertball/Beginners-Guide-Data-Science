Lovely pie and easy to put together! Make sure to taste your mangoes before adjustig the sugar. I used champagne mangoes (all I had) and omitted the lemon just because I felt it didn't need any. I made this into a single serving (1 cup mangoes) for my daughter using a remekin and made French Pastry Pie Crust (AR). I think this would be a perfect summer pie, cooled, and have it with an ice cream.

The poster was not kidding when seh said it tastes like apple pie. It really does. FOr my daughter who likes mangoes that was not a good thing....she wanted it to tasted like mango. For my husband who does not like mangoes it was a good thing. I think what happened is the cinnamon overpowers the mango flavor. If I make it again I would cut back on the cinnamon.

We used four large mangoes and served it with a lemon-vanilla whipped cream. Loved the rich mango flavor. This is a big time keeper in this family and is definitely going with us to the next whatever wherever. Can't wait to experiment with it too. Mango & Blueberry ? Mango & Pineapple ? Mango & Raspberry ? Mango & Peach ? Endless possibilities.

We did enjoy this pie.  It was a nice change but somehow felt like an old classic.  I did not have lemon juice and it still came out with a very nice consistency.  Not too runny or too thick.  We likened this more to a peach pie than an apple.  Also, other reviewers are correct, this is not an overly sweet pie even with the mangoes being so sweet.  If you prefer a sweeter pie you may want to add more sugar.

This pie turned out great! Most of my mangos were ripe, if not a little unripe, making a nice tart pie. All of the sugars balanced out the sourness, making for a pie that resembled peach. Delicious and convenient if you have a bunch of extra mangos. This was the first pie I ever made and was glad with the results!

Made just as stated & both hubby & I loved it. It is like apple pie except not tart. This pie wasn't soggy like apple can make a crust either. Will make again. The only thing I may do & it is minor is sprinkle sugar & cinnamon over the top crust after putting some melted butter on it.

I didn't make any changes. I did use the cup trick(halve the mango. Slide a glass along the inside of the skin to get one whole side of mango. It slips into the glass with no mess). it's a delicious recipe.

I made this tonight and it was delicious. I didn’t use lemon juice since I didn’t have any. I also took another reviewers suggestion of squeezing the pulp from the cut leftover mango. I added the mango juices to the mix, I think that helped bring more of the mango flavor out. Since I like cinnamon I did add a little extra as well.

Wonderful pie! Thank you for the recipe. My touch as follows: I added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and extra 1/2 cup of sugar, and extra butter pieces.  I I used two  9 oz Graham crackers pie shells. I poured filling in one and crumbled the extra pie crust in tiny pieces over the pie to cover entirely. I baked at 400 for 1 hour and 15 min covered with foil paper. I took off the foil leaving the pie edged covered the last 15 mins.  I let cool at room temperature for one hour and refrigerated over night to set the consistency.  It turned out perfect. I served warm with vanilla ice cream. My picky husband loved it! And he does not like any type of cobbler.  This pie was a huge hit!! I will definitely make again!

Excellent pie! I used less sugar since mangos are already so sweet. Also have to add a little more corn starch for riper/juicier mangos. I added pineapple tidbits to one pie. I prefer it cold for some reason.

This is a little bland but still enjoyable and a good way to use up mangoes.  Don't use the stringy mangoes though.  Tastes a little like peach pie.  I served it with the vanilla cinnamon whipped cream which was a decadent addition.

I used frozen mangoes. All the heating time just went towards bringing them to a eatable temperature. 
Next time, I am going to steam the mangoes before putting them in the pie, because I usually only have frozen.

Good pie! Used pre-formed Tenderflake pie crusts and it worked well.  Liked how the pie only had 1/2 cup of sugar.  Used defrosted mangoes—ensure they’re fully defrosted so pie doesn’t take forever to bake.  Flavour and texture was better the next day—was more like a thick peach pie. Delicious with French vanilla ice cream and coffee.

As others have said, it is indeed similar to peach pie. The colour and flavour are brighter, though.

I didn't have cornstarch so I used 6 tablespoons of arrowroot powder. Worked perfectly. 

It was runny while hot, but set up beautifully as it cooled.

Definitely want to make this recipe again.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. It did taste way too close to apple pie. I had a hunch it was the cinnamon that was responsible for this phenomenon. So the second time, I used just a small shake of cinnamon, maybe equal to a couple of pinches, and that did the trick! The glorious taste of those sunny mangoes was able to shine through, and the whisper of cinnamon, while it can't be identified, enhances and underscores the natural sweetness and nuanced flavor mangoes bring to your table. If you make that one, simple change, and you adore mangoes like we do, you will love this. Promise.

I had bought pre-cut mangoes in the store(on sale).  Some slices were sweet but most were like cardboard.  I used up the mangoes using this recipe but added about a cup of fresh pineapple to make a total of 4 cups of fresh fruit.  I used a deep dish so I could have used more fruit.  The pie is very good.  Not too sweet.  Mangos stayed intact.  It was nicely browned at 45minutes at 400 degrees.

Even though I used two bags of frozen mangoes, the recipe was the hit of the meal.  The thick mango chunks created a wonderful texture that complimented the sweet, rich "sauce" created by the other ingredients.

Very popular in my family, I was short mangoes one day and supplemented with peaches, delicious.  I have also topped with raspberries instead of a crust.

Absolutely awesome ran out of crusts for the top (4 store bought). Be careful about the amount of sugar start a little less and adjust to taste.  Used a crumble recipe that I tweaked (https://www.crazyforcrust.com/how-to-make-crumble-topping-for-fruit-pies/)  12  tbsp/170g butter, 2/3 cup/132 g of  brown sugar, 1 and 1/2 cups 180g of flour and 1/2 tbsp/4g of cinnamon (doubled it for the four pies). melt in your mouth good. my oven is spot on temperature wise so while I started the pies at 400f after 15 min I dropped the temperature to 350f. some pie requires ice cream this one the ice cream detracts from the desert.

This came out great. I used a mix of fresh and frozen mangoes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I covered the pie edges with aluminum foil and it took 60 minutes of baking before the pie was done. I will definitely make this again.

WOW! This was a huge hit at a recent holiday family gathering. I am usually asked to make the pie and wanted to switch it up this year and make something unique. This was it!!! I always make pie with homemade butter pie crust which I think is why my pies turn out so well. I will certainly make this pie recipe again!

My husband loved the pie. I used frozen mangos, but since I only had about 2 cups I added 1.5 cups of frozen mixed berries, leaving all other measurements for sugar, corn starch, lemon, and cinnamon the same. The result was a cross between a tart cherry pie and sweet apple pie--for him a perfect balance. The mango pieces were described as tasting like a peach. I cannot try the pie since it is gluten, but I look forward to making this pie again with a gluten-free crust and only mangoes.
