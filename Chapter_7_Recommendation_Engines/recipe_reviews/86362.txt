What a perfect way to enjoy fresh, in-season peaches! I had some Arkansas peaches, cut them down the seam & pulled them away from the seed, brushed with oil & followed the directions exactly. Hubby did the grilling & grilled for less time than specified, but they were juicy, succulent & with the cream cheese filling a little bit like a peach cheesecake. I didn't have the honey & nut, so used whipped cream cheese & mixed in some honey & chopped nuts. Drizzled honey over the finished product. Brilliantly simple recipe--loved it!

I LOVE grilled peaches!!! This was such a simple dessert that I can't believe that I haven't tried it until now. I didn't do the coating of oil.  I cut the peaches in half and sprinkled them with a bit of sugar. I grilled them for 5-6 minutes and they were done. I didn't bother putting them back on the grill with the filling inside.  Just serve with filling and drizzle with honey.

These are SOOO good!!  We skipped the oil, and just used plain cream cheese.  Drizzled with honey when they came off the grill.  The warm peaches with the warm gooey cream cheese was a wonderful combo.  We only made 3 (so 6 halves) and were wished we had made more! My 5-year old daughter ate one half and was stealing bites of mine. These are heaven!

I have also done peaches with vanilla yogurt mixed with honey and cinnamon.  I sprinkle the peaches with brown sugar and grill.  Spoon the yogurt mixture over the peaches and enjoy!  I have to agree with the second review you have to taste your peaches to see if they even taste good before you grill them!  Bad peaches not grilled still taste bad grilled!

Very tasty and easy summer dessert! Be sure to use ripe peaches to get the sweetest flavor. I mixed 1 T. honey with 4 oz. cream cheese and added 2-3 T. chopped pecans. That was plenty of filling for 6 peach halves. Will definitely make again!

Definetely make sure your peaches are ripe. Very tasty! Next time I will add some brown surgar and cinnamon before grilling to give a little carmelized effect.

Yum! I made my own honeyed cream cheese and sprinkled toasted walnuts on the finished peaches. I did end up finishing these in the oven for about 10 minutes as I was afraid to burn my peaches before they were done on the grill (unless your peaches are very ripe you will need to cook them a little longer than stated). Thanks for the recipe!

Because I was planning on making these while camping, I mixed some brown sugar, honey and crushed cashews into the honey-nut cream cheese ahead of time.  They turned out really well on the campfire grate, but I think they'll be even better when we make them at home on the grill.

YUM! I made these last night, I didn't think, and forgot to brush the pit mark side of the peaches with oil, so had a little trouble tearing from the grill, but that was my own mistake. Before I put the peaches on the grill, I sprinkled the whole thing lightly was cinnamon sugar, and used only regular cream cheese, it was still amazing and only took about 10 minutes to make. Will definitely make again!

Yum, yum, yummy!
These are great. Used nice ripe Nectarines, and Cheesecake flavored cream cheese spread plus honey. Oh my!
Talk about good! They were much more difficult to pit then I could've anticipated but turned out smashing:)

I just didn't like this. I didn't feel that the honey/nut cream cheese paired at all with the peach flavor. I probably should have let my peaches ripen a bit more before using them, I had a tough time removing the pit.

This recipe is awesome. The best grilled peach recipe I have ever tried. I recently tried it with marscapone cheese and that was excellent too. Also tried macadamias and pistachios o different occasions with great result. Thanks for sharing!

Grilled stone fruit is one of our favorite things.  I use a sauce made of a good balsamic vinegar mixed with a little brown sugar and grill as directed.  Then I mix cream cheese with brown sugar and nutmeg for the topping.  The balsamic gives them a wonderful flavor and the nutmeg mixed with the cream cheese topping gives it that 'something special' that it needs.

While I really liked the method and flavor combination, my sister did not like the cream cheese with the grilled peaches.  She said it would have been better with vanilla ice cream.  Oh well...

So yummy and simple.  If my peaches aren't totally ripe, I cook them on the top rack in foil before placing them directly on the heat.

This looked good and all I had was halved, canned peaches. I rinsed them, threw them on a Foreman grill and they actually turned out really good. A nice surprise for my husband for dessert. He said they tasted like mini-peach cobblers. Thanks!

OMG!! I just so happen to stumble upon this recipe today and all I can say is YUMMY!!! My husband is a health nut. He doesn't care for cream cheese or honey and he is now on his second serving!!! My son had one without the filling just honey and nuts and he enjoyed it. I put them on the George Foreman Grill and then put them in the oven on 350 for about 5 minutes I added monte honey before putting them in the oven. After I took them out I put the cream cheese on them. I added honey, nuts, brown sugar, and a little cinnamon to the cream cheese and mixed it together. They are a big hit!!!

Riper peaches would work better for grilling.  Ours were firm enough that it was difficult to remove the pit, so 8 minutes on the grill wasn't enough to warm through.  We liked the honey and cream cheese topping, but added more honey to our plate.  Served as a side to Hawaiian Chicken Kabobs.

It is easy, delicious, and a perfect way to enjoy fresh peaches.   I used plain whipped cream cheese, added honey, and roasted walnuts.

This was a great idea, but not a very clear recipe. I needed to grill the peaches for more than double the time called for and it was too vague on ingredient amounts. We decided to try it again using mascarpone cheese, 2 T powdered sugar and 2 T brown sugar. Much creamier then cream cheese.

This is easy and delicious!  I made a few changes to make it healthier.  I subbed light cream cheese (only needed 1/3 cup) and mixed it with equal parts fat free yogurt.  I put one tablespoon of honey in the cream cheese/yogurt mixture to sweeten it up.  I omitted the oil, just used cooking spray to keep the peaches from sticking to the grill pan.  Before serving I very lightly drizzled honey over the peach.  YUM!  Would also be good with a tiny bit of brown sugar on the top too.  Edited to add: I forgot to mention that I topped with cinnamon, it added a lot!

These were amazing! I took them on a picnic. I baked them for about 5 to 7 min at 350 degrees Farenheit. Then I drizzled honey and put the cream cheese spread on it, then popped it back in the oven for a few minutes. We ate them about 45 min after they cooked and they were still delicious. =D. Thanks for the easy recipe!

No offense to your recipe, Olivia, but this was not to my liking!! I think I should have waited a day or so on the peaches I used - they could have been a little riper.  I didn't care for the cream cheese addition, either. I didn't think the flavors paired very well. No more grilling fruit for me!

Peaches were heavenly!  Had to whip my own filling because I could not find the ready-made cream cheese with honey and nuts.  I want to make these every time we grill now, so good!

I've never had grilled peaches before but thought I'd try it cause I'm trying to find healthier options for dessert. I loved them. I did a variation though, as I had no cream cheese. I cut a nectarine in half and removed the pit. Sprayed both side lightly with olive oil, then grilled each side for 3 minutes. Removed nectarine and drizzled honey and a little cinnamon over them. Loved this dessert! (BTW, my nectarines were already ripe and juicy, so likely this helped.) After grilling them, they were quite soft but, oh SO good.

This was delish! I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese softened, with a sprinkle of cinnamon mixed in.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable (it's what I had) Perfect! Make sure you spray the grill with cooking spray 1st do there is not a disaster!!

Very delicious recipe. I just changed it a bit by adding cinnamon to my oil before brushing peach halves. My husband doesnt eat cream cheese but really enjoyed this dessert!

Yummy! A unique dessert, and so easy! Don't worry about exactly how much time to grill it for- when you see nice black grill marks, its done. Great with vanilla ice cream on the side.

I really wasn't sure what I would think of this dessert, but I made it for a barbeque party this weekend and it was a real hit.  I was amazed how lovely this combination tasted together.  I used fresh juicy peaches and as someone else suggested, I put some chopped walnuts in a bowl for others to sprinkle over their peaches.  (Not everyone is a nut fan, so I didn't put them on all the peaches.)  As my husband and I were putting them on the grill, I said I'd prepared way too many, but they would keep in the fridge for later.  Well, they were ALL gobbled up in no time flat!  Such a nice alternative to sugary desserts that leave you feeling bloated and tired.

We used to make this in Homemaking class, except we baked them, used sour cream instead of cream cheese, and then we topped them with a sprinkle of brown sugar until it melted.  To this day (wow; 40 years ago!) it's my quickie dessert, using canned peach halves that I always keep on hand.  In honor of YOU, Mrs. Wilson, and all you taught me!

This didn't taste as good as I hoped it would. Maybe because I have a charcoal grill...It tasted much better without the peach skin. I think with a little modification this could be a great recipe.

Made them excactly per recipe and 9 out 9 thought they were terriable! Not one person ate them--What a flop!! The bbq flavor, from my gas grill, over powered the peaches-the honeynut cream cheese did not pair well with the peaches. I'll sticking to baking a cobbler from now on.

This was an interesting way to eat peaches.  I think we would have enjoyed them more, simply topped with the honey and/or maybe even some brown sugar, instead of adding the cream cheese topping.

I used ripe peaches which were very juicy.  I sprinkled some brown sugar and honey on the peaches and put a dollop of cream cheese, used regular cream cheese the consistency of which didn't complement the peaches that I had.  I put cool whip which was frozen on one or two of them after they were off the grill which tasted better to me.  Maybe the cream cheese would have been better if it was whipped with the honey prior to putting it on the peaches.

Good idea but definitely not something that will please everybody. I'm not sure about using the cream again, if I made this recipe again I would definitely opt for something like Coolwhip of whipped cream. Good flavors thogh, with the honey and the nuts.

This was pretty good.  I used freestone peaches which made for pretty halves.  When done, we drizzled with more honey, chopped pecans and a sprinkling of cinnamon.  My boys thought these were awesome.  My husband and I were not too sure about the cream cheese mix in the middle.  I would probably put just a dab in the center next time and would probably try to find a sweeter peach than what we used but overall this was a great dessert.  We will make this again.

I lightened this one by using a combo of reduced fat cream cheese and non-fat vanilla yogurt which I drained for several hours (use a strainer lined with cheese cloth or paper towel). Added chopped toasted pecans and honey. I used some plums and some peaches. It got rave reviews. I had some trouble separating the peach halves - recipe should probably specify using non-cling peaches. I ended up with one usable half from each peach, and one that turned to mush when I tried to twist it free.I ended up using the squished part to make some awesome peach mojitos though, so no worries :-)

AWESOME!!! I did 2 peaches, skipped the oil but sprinkled w/cinnamon sugar and pumpkin pie spice and refrigerated about an hour before grilling. Had about 1/4 tub of lo-fat cream cheese... poured honey into tub, micro 30 sec, poured chopped pecans in and it all mixed easily with a fork, then refrigerated an hour. It came out FANTASTIC! On hot summer days I try to make as many full meals as I can without turning on the stove or oven and this was the perfect ender. Will make again FOR SURE!

Just getting around to rating, but we had these on a camping trip several months ago and they were very tasty. Be sure to use good ripe peaches because the honey doesn't add much sweetness. I tend to agree with another poster who said added cinnamon sugar would be the finishing touch. But my hubby loved as is, since he is a diabetic.

These make a really nice light dessert.  I used a softened cream cheese block, and mixed in some citrus honey, &  chopped walnuts.  Topped the finished product with a tap or two of ground cinnamon and drizzled with more honey.  Thanks for sharing a unique, delicious recipe, Olivia17!

I just served these at a luncheon bbbq and it was a hit with everyone.  The peaches are delectably tasty with just the right amount of honey sweetness and creamy filling.  Had to make our own cream cheese filling using 8 oz. pkg of cream cheese, 2 tbspn honey, and 1 tbspn sliced almonds.

These were very yummy. I did make a few changes, I couldn't find the cream cheese with honey and nuts so I used regular cream cheese and mixed in cinnamon and sugar. I think that next time I will add a little salt to the cream cheese. Very easy but impressive.

These are awesome! Feels more healthy than some desserts even if it isn't really. It's fun to grill dessert after a nice grilled main dish.

I think all of the ingredients were fine, but I did not really care for this recipe. I think this is because I don't love the taste of grilled peaches. They lose a lot of the sweetness. The cream cheese also had an odd taste.

This was very good, I think I would prefer the cream cheese cold though-I don't know. Maybe after grilling the peaches and drizzling them with honey-take them off of the grill then add the cream cheese? But it was very good, the cream cheese just melted a little too much so it didn't stay in the peaches very well.

This is a simple, elegant dessert!  Perfect for family or a small gathering.  May need to try making the cream cheese next time as I couldn't find a soft version, but it still melted well and tasted great.  DH thought it wasn't sweet enough but that is easily remedied by adding more honey.  Seriously I cannot believe how easy this was to prepare and it makes for a nice presenation.

I found this recipe before peaches were in season, and could not waait to make it.  We have made it several times and LOVE them.  They are so good.  Thank you so much for the recipe we will keep making them.

Excellent!!! Delicious!!! Bravo! :o)  My whole family loved these and we've had them numerous times now.  I flavor my own cream cheese with honey and nuts, or brown sugar and cinnamon (though the honey and nuts totally win out).  I also can't bbq (grill) because, well honestly, we have a propane tank and it bothers me so I used an indoor plug in grill with racks on it (for the "grilled" affect) but it was just the same. So perfect!!!

Very delish.  We tried some with brown sugar/cream cheese and some with honey/cream cheese and the honey were better!  Also I recomend using whipped cream cheese.

This is a very light, simple and delicious dessert. I used real maple syrup because I don't like honey. I also forgot to add some nuts but will for sure add next time. Thanks Olivia!

Maybe its better if you actually use the flavored cream cheese instead of making your own version like I did. It needed a little more sweetness, so I sprinkled it at the end with cinnamon sugar. Tasted fantastic with a couple scoops of vanilla bean ice cream!

Grilling the peaches makes the skin soft and it just peals off. I didn't have any cream cheese on hand, so I topped my grilled peaches with a sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon and then topped with frozen Cool Whip. Very good. A nice finish to a cool autumn night!

I followed this exactly except I had to cook in the oven but I broiled the peaches after cooking for 30 mins in the oven.  The cream cheese and honey was yummy on top. Even cold these were delicious. Will definitely make again.

Such a quick and easy dessert. Will definitely be adding this to the rotation. I sprinkled on some cinnamon and brown sugar before grilling, used honey pecan cream cheese and topped with walnuts and drizzled honey. This is a very light dessert that is the perfect amount of sweetness.

Glad we found this recipe - we have a local farm with great fresh peaches and needed something new to do with them.  We modified the recipe a little, though.  Instead of the cream cheese, we made a whipped cream with equal parts of whipping cream and mascarpone cheese and some sugar and vanilla to taste.  Was an excellent dessert - just make sure your peaches are ripe first.

The grilled peaches alone were perfect! We were not so crazy about the flavors in the filling mixing with the peaches, our pallets were a little confused.

Easy to make and delishous!!!  I added chopped pecans after removing them from the grill.
