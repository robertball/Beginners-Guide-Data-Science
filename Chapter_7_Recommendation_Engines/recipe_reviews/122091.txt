At first, I was a bit disappointed with these cookies. We tried them the day I made them and while the frosting was really good, the cookies were a bit tasteless. However, the next day these cookies were excellent. I made the cookies as stated, except that I replaced the butter-flavored shortening with butter. I only got 30 cookies out of the dough which meant I only needed 15 marshmallows instead of 18. As for the frosting, I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa since it wasn't chocolately enough for me in the first place. The extra tablespoon helped make it more chocolately and not so overpoweringly sugary. I had more than enough frosting for my cookies, even putting it on the cookies rather generously, though not quite so much extra that it felt like a waste.
Otherwise, these cookies are better if eaten the day after they're made - at that point they seem to have had time for the flavors to meld together and make a nicely sweet, chocolately cookie with some gooey marshmallow in it. Definitely recommend these, just not for same day consumption.

Recipe Group Selection:  11, February 2012  Thought this was a wonderful selection this week.  I made for Girls Night Out this month and for Valentine's Day.  I made exactly as written and they came out great.  I do think they tasted better the second day.  I was afraid the frosting wouldn't set up, but I was wrong.  It held together very well.  I got 23 cookies from this batch.

These cookies are to die for! Only thing I would suggest is rolling them into balls and flattening them a bit with the palm of your hand, rather than dropping from a tablespoon. When the cookies comes out of the oven after you've added the marshmallow, use your palm again, to press down on the marshmallow to make the overall cookies a little less "tall."  DELISH! OHH--and I cheated and used canned icing and topped with crushed pecans.

I made these for *Recipe Group.*  Since today is Valentines Day I tweaked the recipe using pink marshmallows and Himalayan pink sea salt crystals.  I rolled the cookie dough between parchment paper to about 1/4 inch thick.  I cut the dough with a 1 3/4" round cookie cutter.  I baked the cookies for 5 mins at 350F and then placed 1 pink  star shaped marshmallow (leftover from Christmas marshmallows) on each cookie and baked for an additional 2 mins.  After the cookie/marshmallow cooled I piped some frosting on in a grid pattern.  Then I drizzled some melted semisweet chocolate on in the same grid pattern.  Before the chocolate and frosting set I sprinkled each cookie with Himalayan pink sea salt crystals.  These treats taste good.  The cookies do melt-in-your-mouth.  The smaller marshmallows are add marshmallow flavor without being overpoweringly marshmallowy (as a bigger marshmallow would be).   The piped sweet chocolate and frosting pair nicely with the sea salt flavor.  The tweaks I made were according to our tastes since marshmallow treats ate not our favorite. The salt adds texture and flavor.  My DS said these were great.  I think they are good.   Thank you Joanna for a sweet recipe.

Not a difficult recipe. Made much more than stated. I did take the advice of reviewer and slightly flatten the cookie before cooking. I didn't think the marshmallow was gooey enough for me. Cookie itself was tasty.
**2nd photo/review= Poured chocolate over marshmallow and loved it so much more. Tasted like the store bought marshmallow cookies. 
AND both ways are better the second day.

Recipe group selection of 2/11/12.  I am not a fan of marshmallows, but I thought the kids would like these.   I had mini marshmallows left from another project, so I used 2 on each cookie.  That was my only change.  The little ones were unanimous in their praise, the some of the adults  thought they were a bit too sweet.  I think I would like to play around using dark cocoa powder and perhaps some coffee in them.  Thanks, Joanna, these made a good Valentines treat.

Made these delightful cookies for *Recipe Group*. The name says it all. The chocolate cookie does melt away in your mouth. The cookie, the marshmallow and the frosting taste so yummy good together. Did not change the recipe ingredients but I did use a different technique to bake them up and assemble. Not unlike Fudge Puddles I baked the cookies by dropping the dough by Tbs into mini muffin pans. Baked up perfectly just at the 8 minute mark. After taking them out of the oven I immediately made wells in the cookies with the flip side of my pestle, floured, and let them cool for five minutes. Carefully removed the cookies from the muffin pans to wire racks to cool completely. The only ingredient I substituted was Marshmallow Fluff for the marshmallows. I piped a dab of Fluff into the cookie wells. Piped the chocolate frosting onto the Fluff and then garnished with Graham Cracker Crumbs. I did have to add a squirt more milk to the frosting than the recipe called for. I will be making these again. So good..... YUM!

We had some Jumbo marshmallows left over from a s'mores adventure earlier, so I was looking for something to do with them and came across this recipe via another website. That site indicated that the cookies were crunchy.  Maybe my oven temp is a little off or something, because at the 10-minute mark, these came out wonderfully soft.

Like another reviewer, I didn't get the full 36 cookies, but I'd made them big on purpose to deal with the Jumbo marshmallows. Maybe this contributed to the softness as well.  Even with a generous icing covering, we did have some icing left over as well. Also like another reviewer, I just used butter instead of butter flavored shortening.

I was REALLY pleased with how well these cookies came out.  They are absolutely delicious and it takes a great amount of self-control to have just one in the evening even given how large I made them.
