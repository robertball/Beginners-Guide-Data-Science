Honestly one of the best cookies I've ever made (and I've made a lot!). Would be excellent with dried cranberries or maybe even chocolate chips.

A nice fresh cake cookie, but after baking 1st batch I added some nuts. May try part shortening & part marg next time. This recipe makes a lot more than 3 doz. Will try putting cranberries in for fall. We did use an orange glaze to frost from the Cranberry Orange Cookie recipe.

These were very good! And easy to make, it takes just a few minutes to mix everything. The whole orange is an awesome idea, gives the cookies an interesting, more original taste. I halved everything except the orange, used olive oil instead of shortening and cinnamon + cloves because I ran out of vanilla. Next time I will try with vanilla as well. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe because it sounded so different.  But unfortunately we didn't love it.  Too cakey.  Not orangey enough. And didn't seem to set up well enough without over baking.  Sorry!  Thanks for sharing!

I like this recipe. I've made this a couple times and the yield is somewhere between 10-12 dozen cookies, dropping at teaspoon sizes on the baking sheet.  I added sprinkles or colored sugar on top of the drops before baking. They are refreshingly different!  Thank you!

I made a small batch of these because I was convinced they would be too zesty.  I was right.   I made a second batch using 2 pureed oranges without the peel or pith and added 1 tablespoon of zest and 1/3 cup less milk.  MUCH BETTER.   
I also arrange dried cranberries on half of the batch before baking. They were a welcome addition

We loved it.  Added 1 egg, 12 oz white chocolate chips, substituted almond milk for milk and butter for shortening. I adjusted the recipe for 5000 ft altitude by decreasing 1 1/2 tbs sugar, adding 2 tbs almond milk and 2 tbs flour.  Cookies came out marvelous.

This is definitely a tea cookie. Very cake like but delicious. I changed the recipe by substituting the shortening with coconut oil and changing the milk to coconut milk. When the recipe directs you to let sit for 15 min before baking, make sure you do so. The only other thing I added was a simple glaze made with powdered sugar, vanilla and a few drops of water.

There is not much of an orange flavor as the cranberry in this overpowers the orange flavor and I increased  the orange juice and zest and you still cannot taste the orange due to the cranberry flavor being so strong.  If  you like cranberries you will like this recipe.  If you're looking for an orange flavor cookie this is not the recipe for you.

I pilled my oranges and used 3 small oranges instead of 1.
The result was a cakey textured cookie, vary light, delicious summer cookie.
