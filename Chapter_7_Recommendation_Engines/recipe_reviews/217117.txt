use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese. Adds a very lucious flavor and tastes absolutely amazing adding some marinated artichoke hearts and eating with chips or crackers!

This was simple and yet so good! I used this to dip hot wings in instead of your typical ranch and it worked very nicely with wings. This would be good on many different things. Definitely a keeper!
