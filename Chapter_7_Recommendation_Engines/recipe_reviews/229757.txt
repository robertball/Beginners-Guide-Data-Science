My family mostly uses the kool-aid drink mixes when it comes to a slushie in the summer, but now i can make them something a little more special. Thanks for the recipe!

1/3 of a cup of lemonade is way to much for the amount of slushie you make (1-2 servings). the drink was WAY too strong and i did about 1/4 cup and it was still insanely strong.
