This is a great combination of flavors, sweet+fruity+spicy meat is the bees knees, if you ask me;   (you could never go wrong using a crock pot or slow cooker of sorts!!!,  that is what I am a fan of.) 4 to 6 hrs on very low in a slow cooker; the meat will just fall apart into shreds with a pair of large forks(cook for longer after you have pulled it apart; but make sure to strain the meat with a special spoon, to avoid an excessively soggy sandwich!  also, fresh red onion and coleslaw is the kicker! to add that special crunch factor, the best of both worlds, a nice balanced texture, this is truley an epic meal!  add jalepeno juice as well, if you have any sense of adventure] then do not hesitate! (pickled jalepenos are what I prefer, strong counter flavors with that vinagar!!!!

Great flavor combinations.  I, too, used apricot preserves in place of the pineapple preserves.  My only disappointment with this was that the spiciness of the rub was diluted by all the liquid that accumulated in the pan. The meat was very tender though.  I think rice would be the best complimentary side dish for this.  Would make again.  Maybe marinate in the rub to help keep the chili powder spice?

I made the dish with some peach chutney I'd put up in the Summer.  I still used the pineapple and oranges.  I've made the dish with all color of bell peppers, they all work.  We love the recipe but I cut the sugar in half at least.

I used apricot preserves and pineapple chunks and skipped the oranges because that's what I had.

Absolutely delicious. I usually follow the recipe the 1st time I make it, then make changes according to my taste. This was so good, it doesn't warrant any changes. I took it to church for a covered dish dinner. Received raves from everyone who ate it. Was told it was the best dish there.

Was going to two of my  close freinds,  who m had recently married and were having their first housewarming\Luau party. I Googled Hawaiian recipes, and this is the only, first, and last one I even clicked on.  I made it, followed the recipe to the letter, and to my pleasant surprise, it was the ABSOLUTE HIT OF THE PARTY!!  Since I have continued to make it for family or church events ,  and of course, Holidays!!!

I made this with a couple of small differences and it was really good. Substituted Orange Marmalade for the Pineapple preserves and since we like things on the hotter side, I used 2 tbsp of hot New Mexico red chile powder and let the meat stand in the fridge for @2 hrs after putting the spice/ brown sugar rub on it. Will definitely put this in my list of favorites!

Outstanding flavor. Hit of the Super Bowl party. I made and applied the dried rub about 3 hours early and I think it definitely kept the spiciness that some of the other reviewers mentioned faded when applying the liquid. I also used apricot preserves.

Alot of good flavors but I left it in for 60 minutes and that was too long, little to dry. I say 45 minutes is plenty of time.

Yum! I made it in the crock pot on low and served it with brown rice and steamed veggies. Easy and so delicious. Next time, we are going to add some hot peppers for some kick!

This is a good mix of fruits and veg is to go with the tenderloin. I did as directed, but found a little bland. So I added jalape√±os, tablespoon garlic powder instead of teaspoon and a dash of soy sauce. All in all, pretty good. I will do this again

Not crazy about this.  The spice rub was good and I would use that again.  But we did not care for the peppers and fruit on top.

I used Kasin's suggestion of making this in the slow cooker. It was so easy and the meat was super tender. I couldn't find pineapple jam, so I used mango-habanero. I also subbed leek for onion. It was 4 stars on its own, but with a little Tajin seasoning on top, it was 5 stars.

10/19/15 ~ A nice, different use for a pork tenderloin. The flavors in this dish work really well together. I used green and orange peppers as that is what I had on hand. Served this over sticky rice and steamed fresh carrots to finish the meal.

This was SO GOOD! I couldn't find any pineapple preserves so followed another reviewers suggestion and used apricot preserves instead.  I can't see how it could have been any better. Served with rice pilaf, this was an incredible dinner Saturday night. With it being such a low fat meal, this is going to be repeated often at my house. Thanks for posting this.
