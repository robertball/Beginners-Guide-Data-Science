Something happened to my "original" recipe once I submitted it to be published. Did "the kitchen" tester change it?   First, I roll the chicken rolls in breadcrumbs, NOT sprinkle them atop.  Secondly, I bake mine at 350 NOT 375. You can even try baking it at 325 for one hour.  This looks like my recipe and it has my name on it, but it is not the same.

Very easy to make! I wouldn't cook it again for 45 minutes though, I think my chicken was on the dry side :(

We liked this recipe! I read a review that said it was a little dry, so after it had baked 25 minutes I drizzled 2 TB melted butter over the chicken. It came out perfect.

This was delicious! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and followed the advice of other reviewers and put the oven at 325 degrees. Chicken was done in half an hour.

OK we LOVE Chef John!
Recipe was good but of course, needed more seasoning. I did add more cheese to the spinach but otherwise.
YUM!

This turned out great. Family has already requested it again. I will add something spicy (cayenne) next time. It needs a little flavor boost for my taste

I thought it was great! I also breaded the chicken before and didn't sprinkle the crumbs on top as directed..didn't make much sense to me to do it that way. I think next time I might quickly brown them before baking.
