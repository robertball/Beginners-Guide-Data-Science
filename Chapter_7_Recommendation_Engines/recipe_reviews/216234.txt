I make this stuff all the time..did not know there was a recipe for it..Anyhow...I cook mine in the electric skillet and let it simmer for a long time to get tender and I also use Rotel instead of Picante sauce. I also do boneless pork chops this way.  Season it with garlic powder, salt and pepper.

I made this and LOVED it...even my 7 year old like it!  I let the steaks simmer for a while and they were super tender. Will definately make again.

Made this the other night and was a big hit with the family. After reading the recipe I thought it might be a little bland, so I fryed the beef with some Taco seasoning. I also sauteed bell peppers with the onions. 
Will be making this again!

I made this last night. It came out very tender and full of flavor. I chose mild Pace Picante Salsa because I have 2 young kids who are not quite into spicy food yet. It is very quick and easy to make.

awesome recipe:) I have been making a skillet dinner similar to this for years. I vary the meat, steak, chicken or pork chops all work well and vary the picante sauce, salsa, rotel or even canned seasoned tomatoes work well. We like to use a black bean and corn salsa with chicken and a peach pineapple for chicken or pork chops

We loved the recipe mainly as is.  My only contibution was adding a can of chopped green chilies with the onions.  It was perfect. I will make this often.  Going to use venison next time.

I didn't like this recipe; the steak needed seasoning and needed longer then 2 minutes to cook..I will not make this again.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!!!!! You should definitely season your steak before you put it in the skillet and I also added minced garlic when I put in the onions...Delicious!!!!

You can also was skinless chicken breast. I pound them out a little, mix Pace picante, 1-2 tbsp brown sugar and a little spicy mustard and pour over chicken and bake at 350 until done. I have also used splenda and my hubby can't tell the difference.

Very easy to make, but steak cooked in a skillet always has a bad taste to it. And picante couldn't hide it.

Easy to make. The flavor is good. Added a few spices to the steask before cooking them. Used New York Strip instead of sirlon cause that is what I had.

added spices to the steak before putting on the stove- the salsa and onion made traditional steak that much more awesome
