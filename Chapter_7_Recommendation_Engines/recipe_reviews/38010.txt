This was very good, and little bit sweet but that's exactly the kind of pad thai I was looking for. I made a few changes on the advice of others: I doubled the sauce ingredients, but I did not double the amount of vinegar. I substituted fresh lime and lime juice for the lemon, added about 2 tsp of garlic chili sauce to give it a little needed kick, and about 1 tsp soy sauce to take the edge off the sweetness. I decreased the peanuts by 1/2 cup to cut calories(just used a sprinkling on top for garnish) and added 1 cup of julienned carrots to the garnish at the end. With these changes, it tasted just like the Pad Thai I get at my favorite Thai restaurant.

WOW!  After many, many years of loving this for carry-out, we have finally found an easy and delicious alternative!  Changes:  double/triple the sauce recipe as the previous reviewers suggested, added 1 tsp red pepper flakes (we like it HOT), and 2 tsp garlic chili sauce.  We added a handful of shredded carott, fresh basil, fresh bean sprouts, about 1/3 lb spicy sausage (this is the way my fave restaurant makes it) and used Trader Joes Rock Shrimp.  I've also used chicken.  Perfect.  If you love spicey Pad Thai restaurant style, you will be very happy with this.  Good enough to entertain with.  Thanks Laura, and thanks previous reviewers!

I liked this recipe but it lacked the tanginess usually associated with Pad Thai.  Next time I will use half the noodles, double the sauce, and half the bean sprouts and peanuts.  The egg part is a little tricky and is probably best done by pushing all ingredients to the sides of the wok, cooking the egg in the center until almost cooked, scrambling the egg, and then mixing with the rest of the ingredients.  I served this with mango salad and it was quite nice.

I've been looking for a better Pad Thai sauce than the one I've always use.  I don't like the paprika in it.  This one wasn't too bad.

First, don't substitute the fish sauce and all.  That's what makes the sauce taste good.  That's the base of most, if not all, Thai cooking.  So if you don't use that, don't even try this recipe.

Second, I scrambled the eggs then added the noodles then the sauce.  If your noodles are too soggy it's either because you didn't use the right size noodles (I don't recommend the small size since they're too thin.  Medium or large is best.  If you can't find the variety at your regular grocery store, go to an Asian store, they'll have it.)  Also, don't soak your noodles in hot water or for too long.  That makes the noodles too soft which once cooked will be too soggy.  Your noodles are ready to be cooked once they're bendable but still have a slight crunch in them.

Overall, it wasn't too bad.  I'd use it again.

I had been looking for a basic Pad Thai recipe for awhile, and when I came across this one I knew it would work. Try changing the following though: added: green onions, carrot, chili sauce and a splash of hot sauce, oyster sauce rice wine vinegar, cabbage (just abit) and the lime. I dumped : ketchup, fish sauce white wine vinegar and the lemon. Oh, by the way... double the sauce!

Excellent! I did make some changes as recommended by other reviewers. I tripled the sauce, and scrambled the eggs before adding the sauce. I also substituted chicken instead of shrimp. I just cooked the chicken in a separate pan, chopped it and added it after cooking my eggs and before adding my sauce. I also added cayenne pepper to give it more of a kick and for color. Cayenne or red pepper flakes are a must in this recipe, otherwise it will be bland.

Skip the ketchup. Flavor is too bold with it, and this should have a delicate flavor. Don't use dry roasted nuts- raw unsalted peanuts are better. Having grown up in Thailand I may be a bit too picky, but I really found this an unsatisfactory take on one of my favorite dishes.

As recommended by other reviews, I doubled the sauce.  However, it still was not enough!  My noodle turned out soggy too...I definatly recommend using the package directions (2-3 mins) instead of the direction here (30 mins).  Next time I will cook the eggs first and set aside becuase they soaked up all the sauce, and I will quadruple the sauce and cut the noodles in half.

I doubled the sauce and added some fresh crushed lime and this turned out to be delicious!  Better than I expected, since the reviews were so mixed.  It was easy to make and it tastes very much like pad thai I have ordered before in a restaurant.  I'll definitely be making this again soon.

I liked this recipe but like others added crushed red pepper flakes to "kick it up a notch."  I would also recommend following the directions on the package when preparing the noodles.  The instructions given in this recipe tend to leave the noodles  a bit rubbery.  Also, add more shrimp!!!

I had high hopes for this recipe because I absolutely love Pad Thai. This in no way turned out like the Pad Thai I order in restaurants.

This was my first try at a thai dish and everyone loved it! I've made it more than once and the only thing I changed was doubling the sauce. This is a keeper in my recipe box.

I wish I would have read the reviews before I made this.  This was very disappointing.  I will say that maybe it did not turn out because I have never attempted to cook Thai food before.  That being said, the dish was all paste.  Everything stuck to eachother.  It was a big ball of pastey noodles.  It was also very bland.  I am used to a little kick in the pad thai that I get from restaurants.  My 8 year old loved it.  She will eat the left overs because the rest of us certainly will not.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. We get Pad Thai at a local restaurant and this was nothing like it! I followed the recipe, and even made the extra additions tthat the other reviewers had suggested. I'll continue to look for a recipe that tastes like what we enjoy at our favorite Thai restaurant -- this just seemed bland, even with the extra spices. Sorry.

I actually really liked it-if I was able to give it 3 1/2 stars, I would. I was craving pad thai that I had to make it. Instead of vinegar, I used rice wine vinegar. And I ate it with the hot chili sauce on the side. I also used chicken instead of shrimp since that's what I had. I actually like Thai Kitchen pad thai sauce better than this one but this one really satisfied my Pad Thai craving!

Delicious!! I didn't have any bean sprouts, so added sliced onion. I also added some chicken and some tofu. I topped it with a sprinkle of sesame oil. Fabulous. My husband and I really enjoyed it, but only 2 out of the 4 kids liked it. I will definately make it again. I like that the flavour is not overpowering, but a wonderful blend of many flavours. Great recipe.

Place noodles in a bowl with cold water for at least 3 hours.  Dump water and re-fill with warm water for 30 minutes before adding to the recipe.  

Double the ketchup, fish sauce, lemon juice, and white wine vinegar.  Only use half of the peanuts, and noodles.  Bean sprouts are optional, as are the sliced lemon, and cilantro.

Using the rest of the recipe as written with these changes makes for a good meal with a good portion size for 1 person.

Absolutely delicious! I tripled the sauce, but used red wine vinegar (2 tbs) and broccoli instead of bean sprouts. Added red peppers for spice (2 tbs). Will definitely make again!

I attempted to make Pad Thai over 20 yrs. ago and it was a disaster!!!  Noodles all stuck together and other ingredients just wrapped around them.  THIS recipe, however, a total success!  Thank you for making it available.  I did also triple the sauce, used lime juice instead, and added a bit of "heat".  EXCELLENT!  Will be making this recipe a lot.

Unlike other reviewers, I am going to recommend that you half the noodles, then you'll have enough sauce and then the recipe will make 4 servings.  As it is now, it makes 8-9 servings. I also doubled the amount of shrimp - I understand the need for restaurants to safe on shrimp, but why do it at home?

I  liked this recipe a lot, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it wasn't the very best I've had.  But it is easy, versatile and forgiving:  I had to use canned bean sprouts, and only had balsamic vinegar on hand -- still, it turned out well.  Like other reviewers, I followed the noodle package directions.  Next time, I will add pepper flakes for a bit of spice, and might prepare a peanut sauce to drizzle on top.  This went very well with fresh-cooked green beans on the side, prepared with butter and dry-roast peanuts.

Wow,  I love Thai food and did not expect this to taste that good but it did.  Follow all suggestions (dble. sauce- not vinegar, add heat) and you will be surprised too.  I only used one egg and found sufficient.  Thanks!

I didn't think this really tasted like thai food at all.  And if you do want to make it, i would double the amount of sauce in the recipe.

This was really good, I would probably double the amount of sauce though and add more shrimp.

This is a good start to a recipe.  I started with the ingredients listed here, mixed the sauce first and realized two things.  #1 as others said, this was definitely not enough sauce. #2 there was no flavor or spice, as I associate with pad thai.  I was deceived by several people giving this recipe 4 or 5 stars and then listing how DRASTICALLY they changed the actual flavor by adding so many alterations.

Very tasty! I also tripled the sauce but got impatient with measuring and went heavy on the ketchup (not a good idea) The more bean sprouts the better!  I used oyster sauce instead of fish sauce because thats what I had onhand and it was very good that way.

Flavor is pretty good, but not bold enough. Followed others advise about tripling sauce. I was hoping it would duplicate a fantastic Thai restaurant's recipe, unfortunatly this wasn't it. I'll have to keep looking.

We have eaten authentic Pad Thai often in the past, which this does not have the full flavor.  It is not spicy at all.  Missing a couple of ingredients.

I LOVED this recipe! I didn't realize how easy it would be to make! Will make again. Instead of the requested amount of ingredients I used 5x the sauce ingredients, but left the vinegar at 1x. I also added 2 tbs peanut butter to the mixture, and 1/2 cup green onions. I also squeezed the juice of 1 lime over the mixture at the end.

Very good. Need to know the exact authentic noodle, as I bought some prepackaged wet noodle that wasn’t quite right, also, if you make this with pre cooked shrimp just add them at the very end briefly to warm, otherwise you will make them wayyy to though. ALSO, if adding tofu, add a half of package but marinade it first for a couple of hours, then sear before adding. If you want to just cook it right away, double the sauce for the whole dish as the tofu will dry everything out pretty fast.

Others said double the sauce ingredients.  I quadrupled the sauce ingredients and added 2 tablespoons oyster sauce as well.  As directed, it is really boring but with a lot more sauce it is nice.

I also used spring onions as garnish not cilantro since I hate cilantro and spring onions are more typical anyhow.

I’m Thai and I don’t like pad thai as it’s usually very sweet in restaurants. However, my daughter who doesn’t eat spicy, loved this dish. It is not overly sweet like some state. I did omit beansprouts but kept everything else the same. I will definitely keep this recipe esp that we can our own spice on the side.

So happy I made this recipe! Didn't have the wine, fish sauce or white vinegar and used apple cider wine instead.  Used mung bean rice noodles cooked according to package instructions turned out great.  So I didn't have enough peanuts on hand and used three table spoons of crunchy peanut butter, coconut milk and brown sugar.  First served it was on the dry side so I made more sauce using six tables spoons of crunchy peanut butter, coconut milk, brown sugar, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar and coconut oil....OMG! It was too die for and it simply vanished before the end of the night!

Very dry and bland. I had to add spices, fresh lemon juice, more shrimp and even more egg. I love pad thai and shrimp, so I'm very sorry to say I was disappointed with this recipe.

I loved this recipe, read the other reviews and added 1/4 cup of diced scallions, 4 eggs fried and diced, 1/4 tsp of Sriracha Hot Chili sauce, 1/4 tsp of soy sauce. I doubled the sauce and substituted olive oil for the veg. oil. Used a thin rice noodle and cooked according to pkg instructions. Everyone in my family loved the Shrimp Pad Thai and the kids asked for seconds. I will be cooking this again as I didn't get enough leftovers for lunch!

This is the basic recipe used by the sidewalk noodle cart vendors in Bangkok. I use sesame oil, fresh rice noodles and chopped kale and serve with ground peanuts and homemade pickled chopped chili peppers.

I just tried this recipe out for dinner tonight but substituted the fish sauce (no grocery stores open on Easter Sunday in Canada) for Toyomansi, a filipino soy sauce with a hint of lemon. I had some snowpeas that I added as well. Turned out nice and I'll definitely try it again!!

The flavor is OK- not quite what I'm used to from Thai restaurants.  I doubled the sauce as suggested and I think it could use even more!  The main problem I had was with the egg- when I added the beaten egg straight to the mixture it just caused it to thicken and become paste-like.  Since the noodles hadn't been added, the mixture was too liquidy to push to the side and fry the egg in the center like you do with other stir fry dishes.  If I try this again I think I will start to fry the egg in a separate pan and then add it.  If I have better luck next time maybe I will change my rating.  Good luck.

It was tasty but needed some adjusting. The noodles should be pre cooked before adding it to the sauce, because the amount of sauce is to little to cook the noodles. Also I would scramble the egg before pouring into the mixture. The sauce should be double the amount. Wasn't to happy with this recipe. I ahd to keep adding things to make it work

Fantastic recipe.  I forgot to buy peanuts and used natural peanut butter instead, and it worked beautifully.  I will say that it needs some more liquid - perhaps water or broth.  I found the noodles a bit dry in spite of following the soaking/cooking directions exactly.

This is so easy to make if you have all the ingredients on-hand. I came across this recipe by accident trying to use the leftover ingredients from the Vieatnamese Beef Pho recipe. With the noodles already cooked, I had these set aside from the pho, it only took about 15 minutes to prepare the entire dish.

I am only giving this 2 stars because my boyfriend thought this was decent.  I thought the flavor was far to vinegary.  In addition, I had to add chili sauce as the recipe did not call for any spicy seasonings.  I was very disappointed in this recipe.
