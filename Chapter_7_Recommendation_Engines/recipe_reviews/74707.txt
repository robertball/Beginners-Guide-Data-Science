I can't but help adjusting recipes but that's just how I am.  This dip is delicious!  I added about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and some cilantro.  I used a combination of ketchup and siracha for the heat.  Thanks for the recipe!

Holy mackerel this stuff is delicious!  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonaise and Louisiana Hot Sauce instead of tomato based sauce.

Wow, I made it exactly the same as the recipe but added 1/2 tbs of lemon juice. It was awesome. It was a nice new dip.

I found this dip to be excellent I will definitely make again. I think I will also add salad shrimp and call it seafood dip!

I added the juice of one fresh lemon, some cilantro (about 3 tbsp) and used Louisiana Hot sauce in place of the tomato-based hotsauce.  I also added about 1 tbsp catsup & 4 stalks of celery diced.  This made a great sandwich -- paired with soft wheat bread and shredded lettuce.

I was a little reluctant to try this recipe, but it is absolutely delicious!  I ate about 1/4 of it in the first tasting!  Thanks so much for posting this!

I used all of the ingredients and added a teaspoon of dill weed and fresh lime juice from 1 whole lime.  The dill and lime lightens up the fishy-ness of the mackerel.  I would definitely make this again.

Loved it. I left the hot since out and poured Cholula Chipoltle Hot Sauce directly on the cracker after it had the mackerel dip on it. I also added a dash of lemon juice to recipe. Yum!!

Great simple to make recipe. We served this on toasted flat bread and garnished with fresh garden-grown dill. If you want to cut the chill time, place the nearly finished product in the freezer for 15, stir and then for another 15 before in the freezer. Stir and it's ready to serve.

We have decided to add more oily fish to our diets....hence the reason this recipe appealed to me. It is also very similar to a fish spread we order a lot in Florida. I only had a small can of Mackerel so I had to adjust amounts down quite a bit and I added about 1 tsp. of  fresh lemon juice and 1/2 tsp. of chopped capers  and 1 tsp  diced red onion and decided to leave the Sriracha sauce out and add on top of the spread as I was serving.....excellent flavour!! This will be my favourite way to serve Mackerel....Thank you.

Simple and straightforward as well as nutritious. Made one modification: red onion for added "sparkle".

Very good, will make again, but will cut the Mayo by 1/4 cup because we like a thicker dip.

Loved how simple, yet tasty this recipe was. I used a chipotle mayo because I didn't have any hot sauce and a small amount of tomato paste to add a little more flavor, but otherwise followed the recipe. Big hit all around with my 3 kids and my husband! :)
