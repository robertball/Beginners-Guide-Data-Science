Tried this for the first time when we deep fried our turkey. It came out absolutely delicious and was a big hit with the in-laws. We followed the recipe to the letter and the turkey was juicy a and flavorful.

Maybe my injector is on the small side but there is literally no way to mince garlic small enough to get it to pass through the needle.  So unless you want to spend ages straining out the garlic before you inject it into the bird, maybe substitute the clove for garlic powder?

This was my first time (in many years!) fixing a "nude bird" and this was the perfect accompaniment to insure it would turn out juicy and flavorful. I was also on my own completely, as my grandmother had recently passed away, so quite nervous, but the turkey and most importantly the drippings, were wonderful--a perfect turkey and a large quantity of well seasoned, tasty drippings for the start of perfect gravy!

Note: I put the marinade back into the fridge for 30 min as directed and it solidified so you may want to be aware. I just melted it down for use with the injector. 

Thanks!  Wonderful!!

first time I've ever made an injection marinade, and this is a winner.  I added a little chilli and this was fantastic.

This was a god recipe, but again I prefer grapefruit juice injected, serving unusual about it kind of adds a depth, and yes you want to pair your marinade with your rub for a great tasting bird, I have personally made a Cajun marinade and Cajun rub, loosely based on Emiril's ideas and it also was great.

Great injectable marinade and rub! Much better than the store bought one. Everybody loved it and it made for the best turkey yet!

Just perfect!!

We decided that we would cook our own turkey instead of getting a smoked one from our local BBQ place. I havenâ€™t cooked one in years so I was looking for ideas. This was perfect for the injector and also to bake with the rub. I cooked mine in turkey bag so it came out super moist and tender. The family loved it!!  

I will definitely use this again!!
