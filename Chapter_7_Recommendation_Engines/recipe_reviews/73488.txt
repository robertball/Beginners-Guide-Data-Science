I made this with Splenda instead of sugar and added 1/2 cup each: chopped sweet red pepper and chopped green onion.  We had it with Calhoun's pork BBQ for a 4th of July picnic.  Wow!  It was so good and crunchy!  Perfect with the BBQ.  A 5-star hit for sure!

Would give this 6 *'s if I could.  Very fresh.  Lots of chopping, but worth it.  I'm not very good at measuring "cups" of vegetables--for this recipe I used 1 head of cabbage, 1 small bunch of celery, and 1/2 an onion.  We're not big fans of raw onion, so reserved a little bit of bacon grease to cook the onion prior to combining with other ingredients (after draining well).  This recipe is a great way to deliciously add cabbage to your diet!!

I liked the bacon flavor and the vinagrette was tasty, but the appearance wasn't very appealing.
It's basically cole slaw with bacon and kidney beans.  The bacon was an asset but I didn't care for the kidney beans in it.

VERY Good.  I was looking for something to help use up my left over shredded cabbage, and man this was well worth it.  They were out of parsley at the store (I know, like you would expect the store to be out of parsley) so I used cilantro instead, which also gave it a nice flavor!  Thanks so much, I will munch on this salad for the next few days!

This is a beautiful, easy refreshing salad.
It was easy to execute.
I used red and white kideney beans for visual interest.
Its delicious!

Like a kidney bean coleslaw! This recipe is quick and delicious. I did however change a few of the quantities. I used 3 strips of thick cut bacon instead of the 10 strips this recipe called for and reduced the celery to 1/3 cup. Thanks for sharing!

We really liked this, but I thought you could taste the bacon a little too much. I will definitely try it again, but with 5 slices instead of 10.

This was a great salad. Everyone enjoyed it. I did saute the onion in a little olive oil (my bacon was pre-cooked and just heated up and crisped in the microwave) because I can't have raw onion anymore, but it was delicious. A nice change from the common three bean salad. Didn't have celery on hand today so I substituted with grated carrots. I used about 2 table. mayonnaise instead of 1/2 cup. 1/2 cup would have been way too much mayo for our tastes. As it was, I might cut down to 1 table. next time.

I don't usually like food like this. Cold salads are really not my thing. Everyone at my house (myself included) loved this bean salad. Super tasty!

Great recipe with the taste combinations.  We had an overabundance of garden cabbage this year and were growing weary of it.  It was a great fresh, cold cabbage recipe.

This salad was great and very filling, it was all I needed for dinner and it kept me full for several hours!  I ate it right away and it still tasted amazing!

Used dried parsley instead and it still had a nice flavour.

Really good!  I omitted the onion because I dislike them, but otherwise made as written.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll add more cabbage.  Probably about 2.5 - 3 cups.  The ratio of cabbage to bean to bacon was a bit off in my opinion.  Thanks for sharing, we enjoyed it!

Mmmm! Wonderful! I only had half the bacon called for, but it was still great.  Next time I think I might add more cabbage; there's plenty of dressing for it.

This is very similar to what my Mom made when I was a kid with the exception of the shredded cabbage.  We always had ours with some chopped cheddar, so I did add that to the salad.  This is somewhat between a standard bean salad and cole slaw.    This was a step back in the past, and a tasty one, too.

This is really, really good...Like a new twist on cole slaw. Great dish for the upcoming summer. I will definitely be making this again.
