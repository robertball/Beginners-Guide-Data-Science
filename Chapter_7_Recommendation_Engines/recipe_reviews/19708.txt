Really great dip - I would suggestt cutting the amount of salt in half though.

This is a very flavorful and easy to make dip, the mayo and sour cream are not overpowering.

PLEASE, first off, DRAIN THE BEANS WELL.  I mean, well as in paper towel them off.  Insane sounding, but the first batch that I just made is as watery as all get out.  I have cooked with beans before and don't know why I didn't do this.

I also used a ton more cilantro, omitted the picante, and added lemon juice.  As I am attempting to replicate a bean dip from the best local Mexican restaurants in Pgh, I put the mixture into a blender...it's gross looking but tastes good.  I will also bake it to get it warm (preference) and serve with blue corn chips.

I hope that this works!

This recipe is wonderful.  I had a huge amount of black beans and did not know what to do with them.  Found this recipe and my husband loved it.  Great for super bowl Sunday.  Substitued chili powder with paprika, subtitued green chilis with jalopenos.  Worked out just fine.

First, as to the other reviews that say it is way too salty, the salt and olive oil are to make the chips not to put in the dip.  I thought it had a really good flavor, I may add more beans or less picante because it was a little too watery. Or add shredded cheese to thicken it up.  My husband wants to try to add chicken...? But it had a great flavor and it was super easy.  For me these are all items I almost always have on hand too!

This recipe is pretty good.  I added lime juice and onions to add some extra fresh flavors.  I also only used about 1/4 c. salad dressing instead of 1/2 c.

My husband enjoys bean dip waaaaay too much.  I left out the Miracle Whip and used FF sour cream, and he couldn't tell the difference!  Flavorful and healthy too!

Not too shabby.  I used smart balance brand mayo instead of a miracle whip, just used a pinch of salt, had no cilantro, but it is pretty good.  I did add just a splash of lemon juice as someone else mentioned and I think it adds to the flavor.  GO for it.  It is a nice alternative to a really fatty dip.  Oh, I even ommitted the olive oil.  So it is worth a shot, I think.

OK, but DO NOT ADD ANY OF THE SALT !! Idea is good but have to make one more time to see if I can tone it down.

What is up with all the salt in this recipe?  I made it and could not eat it. Way to salty for me.  Saved it by adding more beans and unseasoned ground round and eating it on a tortilla with tomatoes, lettuce and sour cream. Omit the salt. Chile powder and garlic powder have salt in them.

Its not very good. It's very watery, and the taste isn't that great. However, I did use mayonnaise in place of dressing, and used 7 oz of green chiles, and omitted picante. I just made the dip, not the chips. It was very thick, so I stuck it through the blender. It's appearance is not good, though I don't usually judge on that (I am because its for a party) and its flavor isn't great.

great dip.  I used a little less dressing (reduced fat mayo) and left out the hot sauce, picante and green chile. I also added a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of onion i'd sauted with garlic and a tsp. of cumin. I sprinkled a little cheese on top and put it under the broiler for a few minutes before serving. Will be making this again!

This is a 5 star recipe, it is just written incorrectly.
I smashed the beans with a potato masher and added mayo, sour cream, chiles, cilantro, chili powder, garlic powder and a drop of pepper sauce (mine is extra spicy).  DO NOT add the olive oil and salt!  Mixed it all well and put it in the refrigerator.  I didn't make my own tortillas, just used some bagged tortilla chips.  VERY VERY good.  I didn't add the picante sauce either and it had a perfect texture!  But I am not a picante fan.  This dip is not very salty at all, if you don't add the salt, but is perfect with salted tortilla chips.  So if you go with low salt tortilla chips, you might want to add 1/2 tsp of salt or so.   Thanks dramstad!  Very yummy recipe

Yummy! Based on other reviews, I added about 3/4 C finely diced onion, 3-4 T of lime juice, and I doubled the cilantro (since I had a bunch.) Also, I didn't have chile peppers, so I added a lot more than a dash of hot pepper sauce. I was too lazy to make my own chips, but maybe next time!

We loved the flavors in this dip! The only thing we deviated from on the recipe was the salt, we only used 1/2 of what it called for. Very easy to make too, always a plus at this house. Great dip!

I used two cans of black beans instead of one, and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  I didn't like how runny it was with using just one can.  Turned out great!

Ok...just gotta say it, this recipe is very poorly written but a bit of common sense should save the day. First, for those who say it's too runny, omit the olive oil: it's for making the chips. Also, drain off the beans, reserving the liquid & add reserved liquid as needed to get the consistency you want. Second,for those who think the recipe is too salty, if you read the recipe you might notice that salt is not one of the ingredients that goes into the dip. It also is for making the chips. Third, what is the picante sauce used for? It is not mentioned in the directions at all....just listed with the ingredients.

I added some cumin do this recipe and used jalapeno instead of green chillies (what I had available). It turned out really well.
