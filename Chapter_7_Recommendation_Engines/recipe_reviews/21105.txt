Really good taste - but the directions are odd and I didn't follow them.  I make ice cream quite a lot, so what I did (based on recipes I've made in the past) was to combine the creams in a saucepan and heat them until they simmer.  Meanwhile, I combined the eggs and the sugar, mixed well, added a few scoopfuls of the simmering liquid to the egg mixture to temper the eggs, and then poured the warmed egg mixture into the saucepan and cooked the mixture until it coated the back of a wooden spoon.  I took it off the heat and added the vanilla and browned pecans.  I cooled this ice cream base in the refrigerator a few hours and then mixed it in my ice cream maker.  It was delicious!

This was ultimately an excellent ice cream. Not only did my girlfriend and I love it, but her cat Meko licked the bowl clean. Two paws up! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I made a lot of changes that other reviewers suggested... 1) I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup, 2) I used 4 egg yolks instead of two whole eggs, and 3) I only used heavy cream and a splash of milk. I say if you're gonna eat ice cream then do it right!

Contrary to other reviews, this recipe is neither rich nor creamy. It's really ice milk. The brown sugar flavor is good, but I'd use a cooked egg custard base from a reliable vanilla recipe. Just substitute brown sugar for white and add the toasted pecans. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and recommend using fewer pecans too.

OMG!!  This is the abosolute best butter pecan ice cream I've ever tasted!  I'm even eating it before it's had a chance to freeze solid! LOL  I took a few tips from other reviewers (a) cut the sugar in half (b) used 1 cup cream & 1 cup half & half (c) added more pecans and (d) added a teaspoon of butter extract along with the vanilla!  My husband even complimented me (which hardly ever happens ;-)  You won't be sorry if you give this ice cream recipe a try!  YUMMO!!!

Simply delicious! I thank you for sharing this recipe, it was a hit! However, the first batch was a little too sweet, so the second batch I made used 3/4 cup of brown sugar, and it was perfect, not as rich.

This recipe made me fall in love with butter pecan ice cream. I have not found a commercial version that is as good as this one!! I made this last year for my annual Fourth of July party and everyone RAVED about it.

Great recipe. My husband loved it!  Only change I made was to decrease the half 'n half to 1/2 cup and increase cream to 1 1/2 cups. Will make again!!!

This recipe was excellent.  However, I agree with the other reviews that it was too sweet.  I only used 3/4 of the amount of sugar and next time I would even decrease that.  I will definitely make it again though.

FANTASTIC!!!  I didn't toast the pecans because I don't find it necessary. I didn't have creams so I only used whole milk. It tasted AMAZING!!!!

This ice cream was amazing! Like other reviewers, I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup...it was perfectly sweet that way. I didn't have any half and half in the house either...I combined a cup of whole milk and a cup of heavy cream. I took 1/2 a cup of this and used it in place of the cream that is used later in the recipe. I also added a few extra pecans, because they are so yummy! To make them more like the kind in the store, I stirred some extra salt into the melted butter. Yum! Other than that, I pretty much made it exactly as written, except that I cooled the cream mixture down before pouring it into the ice cream maker, and didn't stir in the pecans until the end, because they get stuck in the churn. All in all, this is an excellent, creamy ice cream that has a wonderful, crunchy, sweet, buttery and nutty flavor...I will be making this again!!!

Great base. Read bunches of these reviews, adopted several of the recommendations, and after seeing differences in other recipes came up with a pretty tasty version too. Definitely the 3/4 cup brown sugar, all cream (it is called ice CREAM still, and it really makes a difference), 2 tbsp butter (butter pecan), 2 eggs plus two yolks, and the icing on the cake that ties it all together, brings up the butter flavor nutties the nuts, and smooths out the sweet, 1/8 tsp sea salt tossed with the pecans/butter

I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. I thought that the cooking process with the eggs should be changed, there were scrambled eggs in it! I strained it though because I know this would happen. Very good ice cream though. Instead of pecans, I chopped up a toffee bar.

Very good ice cream!  Followed the directions of PamA (see her review from March 02, 2009) since she seemed to be a seasoned ice cream maker and this was my first try :)  It turned out really really yummy!!  Will definitely make again...in a larger quantity :)

AWESOME!  I followed the directions exactly using light brown sugar; but, I made a couple of changes with the ingredients.  I replaced the pecans with almonds and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I didn't have half and half so I used 1 1/4 cups of heavy cream and 1/4 cup of 2% milk.  (I also wanted to be sure it was creamy.)  This ice cream can go right to the head of the class.  It is AWESOME!  Thank you SUSAN LONG for sharing.

This ice cream was delicious! While I was making it, it did become quite lumpy, but it ended up tasting wonderful! I doubled the amounts so I could make 2 quarts. I also added brown sugar to the sauteed pecans and I decreased the amount of brown sugar to 3/4 cup per serving. This recipe, though, is wonderful!

My husband thought this was great, but I thought it was missing something.  I salted the pecans in the skillet with the butter, because I love salty in sweet, but maybe not enough butter flavor.  Maybe the pecans needed to be toasted a little more?  I will keep trying, because we love Butter Pecan.

This was wonderful! I made the butter pecan Ice Cream for our Church Ice Cream social, and every one wanted more my family is always asking for it! And I am going to make it again to day for another Ice Cream Social by request. It reminds me of the Ice Cream I use to eat with my grandpa when he was alive!

This is an excellent recipe.   I noticed the comment about using only egg yolks but if you follow the usual method of putting some of the hot mixture into the egg and stir together, it can be added to the hot mixture with no problem.   I have found that pouring the mixture through a sieve makes it creamy.  I used 3/4 cup brown sugar after reading the other comments and it was great.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Love this ice cream! Would have given 5 stars but I also had to modify this a bit. I used 3/4 c sugar, and will most likely use 1/2 c next time. Also, I didn't use these directions. Insted, I took a more traditional rout and heated the creams, tempered the egg and sugar mixture, and then combined the 2.

This is a wonderful flavored ice cream.  Very rich.  The toasting of the pecans are
a great addition.  You could replace them with butter brickle pieces also.

This ice cream was so good.  We made this while my mom was visiting because she loves just about anything with pecans.  This was creamy and delicious. I did make one minor change and omitted the butter with the pecans.  I just lightly toasted the pecans in the oven.  This seemed to work just fine, as everyone loved the ice cream.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time following the directions entirely, and the second with a few slight moderations. As is, the recipe isn't creamy or rich enough for my liking, and the directions as written may result in an unpleasant texture for one who isn't aware of the importance of tempering eggs. Make sure to temper your eggs first (as directed by PamA), and stir constantly, rather than occassionally, until the mixture is smooth and slightly thickened. I think the amount of pecans used in this recipe is spot on, as well as the amount of brown sugar, but the ice cream is just as good if slightly reduced (all depends on how much of a sweet tooth you have). The only ingredient changes I do suggest making- unless you prefer the taste of lowfat ice cream- is substituting heavy cream for the half-and-half, and substituting 1/2 C. milk (or half-and-half) for the 1/2 C. heavy cream.

Awesome!  The only change I made was to use liquid egg equivalent to 2 eggs, mixed everything together without cooking and put it into my ice cream maker.
Husband said it's the best he's ever tasted!

I was very excited to try this recipe, as I love butter pecan, but there are a few things that this recipe doesn't tell you that you definitely need to know.  First of all, use egg yolk only.  If you mix the whole egg into the recipe, and heat it, the egg white will curdle after scalding leaving you with a chunky mixture that doesn't look appetizing.  Also, you need to cool the recipe before adding it to the ice cream maker for at least 1-2 hours.  Adding a hot mixture to an ice cream maker is not a good idea.  I am going to let my mixture cool overnight and see how it turns out.

This was really good, a little on the sweet side but very creamy and refreshing.I thought it was very easy to make.I will probably decrease the brown sugar a bit next time. It is still yummy!

This recipe was just TOO GOOD FOR WORDS. The result is deliciously creamy and sweet (but not overly so). I substituted 1/3 of the brown sugar with real maple syrup for extra flavor. Definitely will do this one again. Thx for this great recipe !!

My kids loved this ice cream. The only changes I made was to add 2 teaspoons (for a double recipe) of butter flavoring with the vanilla and a bit of sugar & a pinch of salt to the pecans when I cooked them in the butter (I cooked them until the sugar caramelized).

Very good texture and flavor. The ideal quantity for a small ice cream freezer. As others have stated, this recipe is too sweet. Make adjustments to your taste.

This ice cream is fabulous!  I was somewhat concerned because the eggs became somewhat 'cooked' and lumpy when heating the mixture, but it turned out wonderfully creamy and rich.  We have tried a few other recipes in our ice cream maker and this one is by far the best!

My family loved this ice cream.  I have a small Krup's indoor ice cream maker and this recipe was perfect.  I substituted the half and half for more heavy whipping cream--and the results were magnificent.

My daughter made us this ice cream with her ice cream maker.  She used xylitol instead of sugar and only used heavy cream. It was the most delicious ice cream!!! We specifically have been working on an ice cream recipe with no sugar for the anti-fungal diet.  The cream is allowed but the sugar is not.  Xylitol and stevia are it.  So we were so pleased.

This is not the way to make an excellent custard, and the p ecans should not go in at the beginning; wait until the final minute.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe, with the exception of using less sugar after reading the reviews.  It is perfect and I did not find it necessary to temper the eggs or let the mixture cool before adding to my ice cream maker.  Great and easy recipe for delicious ice cream.

I don't know what went wrong...but I tried this twice, and both times wound up with scrambled eggs (the second time I tried tempering the eggs first)...I have made several ice cream recipes from allrecipes.com - this is the first one that made something that didn't even resemble ice cream.

Way too sweet.  My husband had one serving and told me to dump the rest.  I would make again with half the amount of sugar because it had a good consistency and flavor.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe, and reduced the brown sugar to 1.5 c, not 2. I also used 2 c. heavy cream and 2 c. 1/2 n 1/2, that's just what we had.

This recipe is divine!  So smooth and creamy.  Toasting the pecans really enhances the flavour.  I served it with a chunk of Melt in Your Mouth Toffee on top.  I will be making this regularly!

Everybody loved this ice cream. I didn't have any pecans so I used slivered almonds. I also added a little sugar while toasting them in the butter, turned, out wonderful. It also keeps a good texture after being stored in the freezer

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday, she happens to love butter pecan ice cream and she couldn't get over the fact that I made this for her.  She said it was the best she ever had. This was so good that my nephews were begging me for more, and they only eat hot dogs and chicken nuggets.

Only change made based on other reviews was to use only yolks. I used 8 yolks total as I doubled the recipe. Mistakenly cooked pecans too long so  had a slightly burnt taste to them. The custard base is really creamy and rich. I will make this again but will watch the timing on the pecans.

Rich, creamy, delicious. I followed PamA's advice and was not disappointed with the results. It was all gone shortly after I started serving it.

I have made this twice now and it is so very good.  I use the Kitchenaid ice cream bowl to churn the ice cream and it works out great.  You do have to let the ice cream custard chill first since you do cook it, I let it chill over night and then churn it in the morning, throw it in the freezer and then it is perfect for after dinner dessert.  It freezes nicely to the perfect consistency.

It had decent flavor but the next time I make it I will be cutting back on the sugar. Also I had problems with getting the ice cream to harden. It's been In my freezer for 24 hours after using the ice cream machine. And it's only at a soft serve consistency.

It took two times (but we finally got it right0...We had issues with the eggs hardening and ruining the first batch....We then followed the advice from PamA (tempering the eggs was the key step that the original recipe left out).  It turned out great, we didn't alter the recipe and we won the contest we entered.

Made this for the 4th of July.  I doubled this for my countertop half gallon freezer and it fit perfectly.  I used all half and half and added 1 teaspoon butter flavoring. Absolutely delicious.

This is the best ice cream recipe I have ever tied! I altered it a little by using non fat half and half and I blended in a half a cup of splenda in with a half of a cup of light brown sugar. I have a Cuisinart ice cream maker and it usually holds 4 cups of liquid and this recipe only calls for 2 cups, so I used 2 cups of non fat half and half and 1 cup of the heavy cream along with the 2 eggs and it came out filled almost to the top. Maybe it was adding the eggs that made the difference but even with the non fat and half splenda you couldn't tell one bit. Using an ice cream maker I didn't use add the sauteed pecans  until the last 5 mins, But I did take half of the butter from the recipe for the nuts and simmered it with the milk eggs and sugar. Added the nuts at the end and, just so impressed with the recipe. Sometimes using all heavy cream and half and half without the eggs, it seems to taste good but not as creamy as this tasted.

I thought this ice cream was wonderful.  Because we don’t like our desserts too sweet, next time I would cut back the brown sugar just a tad.  However, having said that, it was still very good.  I combined the beaten eggs and light cream very well before adding it to the saucepan.  I found the best results were cooking the mixture at a low temperature, and stirring constantly.  When the mixture is thickened, I poured it into a mixing bowl, adding the pecans, heavy cream and vanilla extract.    Because the mixture is thick, the pecans will remain suspended in the mixture so you don’t have to add them at the very end of the ice cream maker cycle as you usually do.   The bowl then went into the refrigerator.  I only poured it into my ice cream maker when the mixture was cold.  The ice cream was creamy and delicious.

This is a good recipe. I am frequently concerned about messing up ice cream but really, the recipes are realitivley easy to resurect. When some egg got cooked in my mixture I just strained the egg out (there wasn't much cooked strans). I put some more pecans. I think an overflowing half cup is good. Let the mixture cool, avoid cooking the egg and when cooled put the mixture in the machine. It tastes rich, creamy, very good.

An EXCELLENT ice cream recipe.  I made everything up the night before in a double batch.  My one change, based on other reviews, was to decrease the brown sugar to 1.5 cups.  I also used 1 cup of chopped pecans, since I had two 1/2 cup packets.  I was concerned at first, because the mixture seemed clumpy when I put it in the fridge to sit overnight.  And it took about 45 minutes to set up in the ice cream machine.  However, the final product was well worth it... and a huge hit for people who enjoy homemade ice cream.    Thank you!!

This recipe was delicious! It took a while for it to simmer and finally I just turned the heat up to a little above medium and it began to work. I had never tried a butter pecan ice cream before and this one was great! Even better the next day when it had firmed up a bit.

I used 1/2 cup pecans, 1 tbsp butter, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1.5 cups half-and-half, 1 cups skim, and 1 tsp vanilla.  The brown sugar gave it a great color and good flavor...it actually did taste somewhat like butter pecan!  I would recomment NOT using skim milk like I did, unless you like your ice cream icy.  But the sugar can def. be reduced.

The flavor of this ice cream is excellent!  I took the advise of some other users and cut the brown sugar down to 3/4.  I was unsure how long to cook the pecans so they came out a little soft.  Next time I'll cook them longer and it'll be perfect.  A hit with everyone who tried it!

Creamy and delicious. I used the full amount of sugar. I did use all heavy cream, and I used four egg yolks instead of the whole eggs. It was a definite make again recipe. It doesn't taste like store brand butter pecan, and the color is different because of the brown sugar. What a treat. Made it for 4th of July and everyone loved it!

My family pronounced this ice cream recipe very good. I would definitely make it again but would increase the amounts. This recipe didn't make enough for us. I failed to brown the butter which is probably the reason my results didn't have that traditional butternut flavor, but it was still very good. Thanks for the recipe.

My first time making homemade ice cream so I picked this recipe because it's my favorite flavor - This was good, but I made some changes based on the reviews - I used 1/2 the brown sugar, and one egg plus one egg yolk.  And since I like pecans I doubled the nuts.  I actually found the ice cream is not sweet enough with 1/2 cup of sugar, so next time I will use 3/4 cup.   I did add 1 tbsp of brown sugar to the nuts as they were toasting and I think that saved the batch for me by adding a little extra sweetness!

This was OK I think you would be better off to use your time with another recipe and just buy some butter pecan icecream as it is likely better than this.

I liked the taste of this, and thought it was great when it first came out of the ice cream maker, but after freezing it overnight it didn't really have ice cream consistency.  The flavor was good, though.  This was my first time making ice cream, so I will keep trying.

Wow this was good! I cut the sugar in half as others suggested, but my sugar-buzz-loving husband stated he would have liked it a little sweeter. Oh well.

I have searched high and low for good butter pecan ice cream for years. Most just taste like vanilla ice cream with pecans thrown in it.

But this recipe is the bomb! I have only modified it slightly to make it what I want, like adding more pecans and making sure the residual butter goes in with them. 

Also, I wonder if it was too sweet for some because they packed the brown sugar. It doesn't say packed like you see it in cookie recipes. Measure it loosely and it's great.

I can't recommend this recipe enough. I absolutely love it!

I cut back a bit on the brown sugar, and I incorporated the eggs a little differently, but otherwise stuck close to the recipe.  My husband is the one who requested butter pecan ice cream, and he LOVES it.  I also shared some with friends and they raved about it.  At least one is headed out to buy an ice cream freezer!

I loved results but tweaked (simplified) the recipe a bit because I was a guest for dinner and was running out of time! This shaved the prep time to 1 hour 20 minutes from the just over 2 hours it says.  I also used 1:1 heavy/18% table creams because that's what I had in the fridge. I mixed the creams together with the brown sugar in a pot and heated to a simmer. I added enough of the heated cream to the eggs to warm (temper) them before putting all back into the pot and continued heating over low until custard coated spoon.  Added the nuts and vanilla at this point and poured it all into a bowl and cooled in the freezer. Carried on like normal with my ice cream maker when it was tepid and it turned out amazing with wonderful flavour!

This ice cream is delicious! Hands down, a really great recipe. Will definitely be making this again. I did alter the way i made it though. I mixed cream, half n half, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla together and then poured into a pot and whisked continuously over medium heat. After it started to simmer a little i turned the heat all the way down and whisked the two eggs in a bowl and tempered it with the cream mixture. Then I added the tempered egg mixture to the pot slowly and whisked until the mixture coated the back of my spoon and added the pecans. I then poured the mixture into a bowl and place it in the refrigerator for a couple hours then poured it into the icecream maker.

Made it exactly as directed, it never solidified and remained a runny mess after 60 minutes in the  Kitchenaid machine. Poured it down the toilet. Loved it. All I can figure is that it should have gone in the fridge until fully cooled then into the machine. Won't waste money on this again.

No changes. I worried after reading the reviews that it would be too sweet, but I'd already put it in the freezer to churn...
Came out very good.
I am not very experienced with custards, and I was cooking directly on the stovetop (rather than a double boiler), and I overcooked it and it separated/curdled.
Amazingly, I didn't panic; instead, I took it off the heat and pulled out my immersion blender, and seconds later I had a smooth and creamy custard without a lump or a sign of separation. 
I was amazed at my luck, and just a little bit proud of myself. I read later and found it is a known trick, but if you didn't know it before, you do now, and it works wonders!
I thought the ice cream was excellent. It was good right from the churn, and even better after ripening in the freezer overnight.

I would definitely make this again! It had a very rich and creamy flavor. I followed the recipe and the directions pretty exactly. The only thing I did differently is doubled the recipe. Doubling the recipe fed six people with some leftovers.  I'll also mention that I had never made ice cream before and I found this recipe to be quite simple to follow. Although, I do recommend having another person assist you while making it. To sum it up, this was really delicious ice cream and I definitely recommend!

Absolutely delectable. But I kept it simple. 

I mixed the eggs and brown sugar in one bowl. 

Mixed the creams in the saucepan and brought it up to the correct heat. 

Then I spooned a couple large spoonfuls of the hot cream into the eggs and whisked it around till it was well mixed. 

Then I poured all the eggs (with the little bit of cream) into the hot cream and kept stirring until the egg/cream mixture coated the back of the spoon. That didn't take long.

I don't know why people edit a recipe and then give the recipe 5 stars. It may have tasted fine, I don't know, I quit before I actually got to the ice cream part. I didn't like that the actual recipe (the one listed that I followed) made egg chunks, yum right? I kept going  until the last boiling at that point it was too watery...boil until you can wipe a line through a spoon? I would have evaporated it all trying to get there.

I added a pinch of salt. It is great. Also, I put the bowl of custard in the freezer until it was cool. It would not do to put hot custard in a cold ice cream maker.

You need to temper the eggs before putting the entire mixture back on heat. Otherwise you'll get scrambled eggs in your ice cream, as many report. To do this, add a small bit of the hot liquid to the eggs and stir furiously. Let rest, repeat until all hot liquid is expended. Then put back on heat, but start with low and work your way up slowly.

Super yummy and creamy! I reduced the sugar to about 1/2 cup because it was a little too sweet for me the 1st time. Also added the pecans near the end so they wouldn't get stuck.

Awful recipe directions produces poor texture and bad results. Should have read others comments first before trying because most folks modify the described recipe to produce something they like. I look for a recipe that stands on its own merits and directions; this recipe does not.

First time the half and half curdled. Half and half, and milk the second time and it curdled. I recommend not only switching the half and half and heavy cream ratios, and using heavy cream first as the heated base, and tempering your eggs properly in a bowl, and then adding back to cream mixture, and then proceed.

So far so good. After returning custard to stove I had heat too high and curdled the milk?  Dumped that batch. 2nd batch is creamy and smooth. Into ice cream maker tomorrow.

Insanely good. It was so rich and creamy. Very sweet I might add. The only thing I regret is not doubling the recipe. Will make again and again and again! Next time I think I'll add some butter flavoring but this recipe gets an A++. My family loved it!

I changed the instructions b/c they didn't make sense. You can't boil custard b/c it won't turn out. I'm going to scald the initial mixture, then cook it to 180 degrees on a candy thermometer.

Also, switch the half & half and heavy cream, and, because I'm making 4 qts., I'm dividing the sugar to half brown and half white.

I will make again!! Plan to decrease sugar by half cup as it was quite sweet.  Also thought a bit eggy so plan want to try smaller size eggs ( we have farm fresh jumbo ones)Over all a promising much appreciated recipe.

Very good recipe.  Took some advice from other reviewers and used 3/4 c brown sugar, 1 c half and half, 1 c heavy cream and added a tsp of butter extract.  Best butter pecan ice cream I have ever tasted!!

It curdled on the stove and would not even go thru a sieve. Does anyone know what happened? Help! I really want to make this recipe.

Very good!  It was super creamy.  Next time I'll probably cut some of the cream but overall it was soooo delicious!  I also made it with twice the pecans! That's the business right there!

This ice cream was so good! I made 4 different types of homemade ice cream and this went fast and first.  I would NOT change anything about this recipe.

not very good, sorry! I will stick to toasting my pecans in the oven and glazing them then adding to my vanilla icecream during processing.

I really liked this recipe. I made it for an ice cream contest, and I got first place in the contest. I also made the Six 3's ice cream and got second place they are both very good ice creams. I would make them both again.

Absolutely loved it! I made it for a large BBQ for family that was in from out of state, and it was for sure a HIT!
The only adjustment I made was reduced the sugar...Thank you

This is always one of the favorites at the church ice cream socials.  It is very sweet so I think the sugar could be reduced a bit; but the people I have served it to love it the way it is.

I thought this was going to be a mess, as it looked sloppy before going into freezer.  It turned out to be very good, and I will definitely make it again.  I think I might use less sugar next time.

I made this as my sister was making Creme Caramel out of a box and she was asking me what I thought Creme Caramel was made out of so she could make it homemade it turns out this recipe would turn out perfectly as a custard I liked it better as a warm custard than cold ice cream. Too sweet and not the usual taste of butter pecan.

This is a great recipe. We enjoyed for our Father's Day dessert! Dad's favorite, and now all of ours!
