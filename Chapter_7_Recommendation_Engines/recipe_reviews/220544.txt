The bread we always serve this with is pumpernickel rye (dark kind of rye). Lately I've been using rye/pita chips since there's so many varieties in the store now

Unless you absolutely love mayo, skip this one. I just needed something in a hurry.  That's what I get I guess.  I made it edible by adding tons of dill weed, about 2 cloves of garlic and a lot of salt and pepper. I was able to take it to the party, but like I said folks, unless you LOVE MAYO, do yourself a favor and skip this one.

Simple and delicious. I put it in a sourdough loaf. An impressive presentation.
