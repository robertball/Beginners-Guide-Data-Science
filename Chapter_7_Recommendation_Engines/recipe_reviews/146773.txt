This is a really great dessert that's so simple and tastes great. It's surprisingly elegant and not to mention low fat! We served this over fat free vanilla ice cream and it made for a "guilt free" treat.

I am rating this recipe BUT didn't make it! My friend did. Again, a BUT...I will be though!   This is delicious.  I had these strawberries with mascarpone cream and in my opinion it was heaven!  If you eat low carb this recipe is pretty good!  
Here's a Vanilla Mascarpone Cream recipe (it's easy and yummy)
1/2 c. whipping cream
1/2 c mascarpone cheese 
1/2 tsp vanilla extract (or you can use Almond extract too)
3 Tbl splenda (you may need to play with it to your liking) 

Use an electric mixer and whip marscapone with the whip cream & sugar until thick like firmly whipped cream.  Add the vanilla.  Use immediately or can be stored in fridge for up to 2 days.  (Remove from fridge & bring to room temp just before serving)

I forgot to add the black pepper, but these were very good. I chose this Splenda version vs. the more popular but otherwise identical sugar version simply to save calories. I'm glad I did because we're accustomed to the flavor of Splenda but if you are NOT used to it I wouldn't advise using this version, as Splenda + balsamic vinegar is probably not a flavor combo that everyone will dig. We liked it just fine and look forward to actually adding the black pepper next time. Thanks for the recipe!

One of my most favorite desserts. I really like this over NF vanilla frozen yogurt but it's good on it's own as well. And I'll tell you, one of my kids turned up their noses at it but once he tried it and gave it a second, he said "Mom, can I have another bite?"

I served this recipe on a warm vanilla poundcake slice with honey Greek yogurt, and it was just okay. It was nothing spectacular. It was good the next day on a salad, but for a dessert there are better ways to end a meal.

I liked this but if I make it again, I'll use less vinegar and more sweetener.

I added an apple that was lonely and also tasted great. I used as a salad and worked very well with a oven baked chicken.
