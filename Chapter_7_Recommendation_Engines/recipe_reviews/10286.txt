A melt in your mouth lemony treat! Ofcourse- used butter.   LOVED these! Used generous tsp lemon zest + an extra little splash of lemon juice. Great texture.   15 minutes in the oven. A real keeper-Yum!

Great recipe. I used butter instead of margarine. I also put in 4 tsps (packed) of lemon zest and no orange zest. I rolled my dough into balls and rolled them in the egg white right away. I didn't bother chilling them, mainly due to the fact that I wanted to eat them as soon as I could. I baked for about 15 minutes so that the cookies were soft and moist in the middle. 

My cookies also looked way cuter than the ones in the picture, but that was probably because I rolled them into balls.

Pretty good.  Danty but the guys still liked them.  They were easy to make.  I only baked them for 15 minutes and they were perfect.

These were really good. Delicate cookies, sort of like a light version of shortbread. I used butter over margarine though, and used all lemon zest as I was looking for as much lemon flavor as possible, though I think these would be lovely with the orange zest as well.

I thought it was a lot of work for 12 cookies, but I didn't want to double the recipe until I tried them.  I (we) really liked them and will probably make again, doubling the recipe next time.

Lovely, I used butter as I do in most baking but the baking time was too long, I just rescued them in time.

Loved these light cookies with a citrusy twang. I used butter and not margarine and reduced the baking time to about 15 minutes. The next time I make these, I'd like to try using a couple of teaspoons of orange marmalade instead of orange zest. Thanx for sharing this recipe C. Wayne, this recipe's a keeper!

Really like the smell of the dough before baking and the taste afterwards too. Nice citrus light taste and a soft texture to the bite. Made these for recipe group for 6/14/13 and it is a cookie I will go to for special occasions like teas at church or someone I know loves lemon anything. I did turn the temp. down on the oven as previously stated in a review it did help get the middle done before too much browning. Still browned up but some cookies just do.

Made these for Recipe Group...These were good! I really liked that they were so simple to make and that the recipe didn't make a TON. I used butter instead of margarine, and that really contributed to the flavor of these, along w/ the lemon, of course. I totally missed adding the vanilla b/c while it's in the ingredients list, it's not listed in the recipe, so I guess I should've been paying more attention, lol. I would probably make these again, for a quick treat! Thanks for sharing. :)

I baked these as written, but at 15 minutes the bottoms were done, and the middle wasn't quite done.  If I were to make these again, I'd turn the oven down to 325 and see if that would help the situation.  These have a nice flavor and are good with a cup of coffee--not too sweet and light.  I did use butter.  Thanks for a nice change of pace!

Awesome, light cookies with lots of flavor. Used 2 tsp of mixed peel (from Bulk Barn) and the chunks of peel improved the texture considerably.

These cookies turned out great! Instead of 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, I used about 1/2 cup of crushed pecans. I also topped the cookies with a little bit of lemon glaze. They tasted amazing!

A friend gave me a Meyer lemon, so I made these cookies for her as a way to share my windfall.  I substituted toasted pecan pieces for the walnuts, threw in about a half cup of white chocolate chips and flattened them a bit before baking.  Other than that, I followed the recipe (easy!) and sent them off to my friend.  She said they were absolutely delicious and requested the recipe.  Be advised, they are VERY lemony! I'm still savoring the remaining few.  Yum!

These are so tart and yummy. I added a teaspoon of table salt, increased the vanilla to one tablespoon, lowered the temp to 325, and baked for 18 minutes. After cooling we added a simple lemon/powdered sugar glaze and they are perfection! Thank you for such a great recipe!

I used toasted almonds instead of walnuts and also lowered the temp to 325 as suggested by others.  It's a tasty cookie but may be even better with a glaze drizzled on top.

Great base recipe. I doubled it, using 1/2 butter 1/2 coconut oil-was extra generous w/lemon juice & used lemon zest only-and extra!
Have to watch the cookies closely after 19 min. so they don't burn, but light & delicate with a wonderful lemon flavor!

I used butter not marg.  Also did not have any oranges so used just 4tsp. of lemon jest.  I cut down on the sugar a tad.  I think these cookies are missing a bit of salt. Very light tasting.  A nice addition to a plate of cookies.

The cookies I made with this recipe didn't turn out like the picture.  They spread too much, becoming quite flat, and many ran into each other despite the two inch spacing.  The edges crumbled when I removed them from the cooling rack.  They did taste delicious, though, and I'm disappointed that they didn't turn out for me.

LOVE these cookies! We skipped the refrigeration and eggwhite steps - simply rolled the fresh dough in chopped almonds. The nuts stuck to the dough just great. Cooked 10 minutes - perfection!

These cookies came out very lemony, a bit over powering on their own.  I'm hoping they'll mellow .

I made these exactly as written and I give these cookies a 4.5.  My husband really liked the lemony flavor.  It was nice to have a different cookie with a fresh taste...no heavy chocolate or peanut butter flavor, etc.  The recipe yielded just under 2 dozen cookies for us.
