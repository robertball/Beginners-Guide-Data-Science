Over the top delish! This is a must try. I followed the recipe exactly. It took a bit of time but was well worth it. I will be making this again soon! Thanks Shannon!

Very good recipe. The only change I made was I used dried parsley instead of fresh parsley. I served this over angel hair pasta but I didn't have as much sauce as I wanted. If you plan on using this as a pasta sauce I suggest doubling the sauce and using the same amount of artichokes. Excellent flavor!

This was DELICIOUS! I will definitely make it again! I followed the recipe exactly for the most part. Except I accidentally only bought an 8oz can of artichokes, used dried parsley instead of fresh and I didn't have any apple juice and didn't feel like buying a big jug of it just for a few teaspoons since we don't drink it so I used applesauce instead. Worked great!

This was ok, it wasn't a wow recipe for me... BUT, I did double the ingredients for more sauce and that's where I think I messed up.  My husband liked this, but I thought it was TOO tart from the lemon.  SO, my best advice is if doubling the sauce to have with pasta, I would NOT double the lemon juice!  I followed another reviewers advice and didn't double the artichoke but wished i had, because I love artichokes that much!  I think with some tweaking, this would be really good.  I used half and half for the lower fat content, and ended up having to thicken the sauce with the ol' corn starch/water thickener.  I also added more parm, apple juice and even a little sugar to alleviate the tartness.  They helped some. Just not my cup-a-tea I guess!

YUM!  I used one package of chicken breasts from Costco (just the two of us), so two breasts with all the sauce.  I love having too much sauce so I can sop it up either with pasta (capellini in this case) or with bread.  For the oil I used lemon olive oil, and because I didn't have fresh parsley I used cilantro.  I only had a can of artichoke bottoms, so I did add some marinated artichoke hearts, but only a few for variety because the bottoms are so solid!  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Excellent dinner!  This will be repeated for sure!  Thanks, shannonferger!  Yum!

Was a hit at my dinner party and quite easy. Served with roasted potatoes and grilled vegetables. Would cut back on the liquids next time.

Very good recipe. I served it with rice pilaf and my hubby loved it! I had to thicken my sauce a little with an extra tablespoon of the heavy whipping cream and I added green peas for color. I will definitely make this dish again.

As similarly stated in other reviews, each step took a little longer than listed - likely because I doubled the sauce ingredients (except for the oil). Nevertheless the flavor of this dish is sublime and worth every second spent. I prefer a thicker sauce and plan to dredge the chicken in flour, salt and pepper next time I make it. A definite new favorite at my house! Truly delicious.

This was one of the best things I've ever made! My daughter even loved it (4yrs old). Left out the cream/milk completely and substituted Marsala wine for white wine, and apple cider for apple juice (bc of what I happened to have in the house), and added in capers.  Very flavorful and can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was pretty good although I did make some changes. I eliminated the apple juice and added about 2/3c cream cheese at the end to thicken up the sauce a bit and make it a little richer. Also, I didn't have canned artichokes so I used two 6oz jars of marinated,grilled and drained artichokes instead which I think added to the flavor. I would suggest to add the parsley and Parmesan with the whipping cream after you've reduced your sauce as it does tend to clump. This is a great recipe for add in/s such as sauted mushrooms, peas,olives or capers if desired. I would definetly make this again

I made this for our Mother's Day dinner. It was very tasty, but next time I'll add something to the sauce to thicken it up some. My mom loved the tanginess of the sauce. I'll make this again.

This was pretty easy and oh so tasty! I was worried it would be too tart, but nope, it turned out great! It was a perfect compliment to the chicken. I did sub whole milk for the cream and made my own apple juice by juicing some apples.  I'll be making this again!

I made this using what I had - I only had light cream which made the sauce too thin, plus it curdled. If you are going to make this, I highly recommend using only whipping/heavy cream. It makes a nice, thick sauce which doesn't break. The flavour was good, will probably make again using the proper ingredients.
