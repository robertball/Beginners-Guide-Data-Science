I thought this was very good.  but to the others out there criticizing recipes on this site, cant criticize accurately if you change the original recipe.  makes no sense to say its bad or wasnt very good, if you dont first try it the way its supposed to be, because it might have been your changes that made it worse.

The sauce gets 10 stars! Double it! It is amazing, just like the local take out place, even better because I know the quality of the ingredients. I have made this recipe as is, BUT I always reduce  the ginger, that has to be a typo.  I've also added 2 T orange marmalade and cut the vinegar a bit, 1 t sesame oil, 1/2 a teaspoon of Siracha Hot Chili Sauce.  Doing so makes the sauce over the top!!   I've also just made the sauce alone to add to other stir fry's as substituting the beef for chicken breasts, even tofu nuggets. I have learned that to prevent to much  cornstarch from falling into the oil, let the cornstarch covered meat slices rest 10 minutes, then place meat in a pasta colander and shake over the sink, then fry the meat, QUICKLY.. comes out perfect every time.  Then serve topped with a sprinkle of green onion and sesame seeds.  In fact, I often just serve this with  garlic green beans an Jasmine rice, rather than the broccoli. When making your Jasmine rice, saute 1/4 cup of rice in 1 Tablespoon hot oil until golden brown, then add the remaining rice and water to boil, gives a great nutty flavor to boring white rice. Also, "Fried Rice with Cilantro" from this site is also great with this.

Sauce is what makes it great.  Like others, we altered it by: using 1/3 cup orange juice instead of concentrate *and* stirfrying batches with only 1 Tbs of peanut oil each time.  Cuts down on calories and left the meat tender and glossy.  Pretty authentic tasting.

I'd have to say that this was the closest you could get to 'authentic' Chinese restaurant food. I followed the suggestion of others and reduced the sugar by half, doubled the sauce and left the beef strips sit with the corn starch on them for 10 min. The only thing missing was 'crispy' beef - I let the oil get hot, I tried to not overcook the strips and sliced them as thin as possible.They just were not really crispy. Could it be the oil I used - canola? Nevertheless, the flavour and tenderness were perfect. On sticky white rice - I was in heaven. Prep time took aprox 90 min. Highly recommended.
March 10' tried it again - same result, almost all of the starch came off the meat into the hot oil - doesn't stick.

I made this dish for my mom's birthday and it was a hit. I made a few changes that were simple and easy.
In my wok I cooked a medley of frozen veggies, fresh onion, garlic, ginger, and bean spouts. When that was done I added olive oil to the hot wok and cooked the meat. I bought the already sliced "stir fry" beef which proved to be a time saver. After the beef was done I put all the soy sauce mixture in the pan and cooked it until it started to thicken, then I added the beef back in.

My family loved it and there were arguments over who got to keep the leftovers. Thanks so much for this!

Turned out fantastic. I did as others suggested and doubled the sauce while cutting the sugar in half. I also omitted the orange peel as it really didn't need it. Next time I will reduce the vinegar by 25% and use mixed OJ to replace the 25% vinegar omission. Really very good. I will make again.

This is a very good recipe.  The first time I felt the beef was very bland, but once it was added to the orange sauce it was perfect.  The second time I fried the beef with flour instead of corn starch and I thought the beef was even better.  I will definitely make this again.

I added only 1 TBS of ginger, and this was delicous!  My husband enjoyed it too.  As other's have noted, cutting back on the ginger keeps it from overpowering the meat.  I can't wait to make this again!

This recipe got mixed reviews in my household as well. My fiance loved it, but I only thought it was pretty good.

I didn't like the cornstarch-coated fried beef at ALL, so instead I mixed 1 tablespoon of corn starch with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce (for 1lb of meat), tossed the beef in that, and then seared the meat in some olive oil on medium-high to high heat. I seasoned it with just a little pepper and a dash of salt. (not too much, since I used soy sauce on it). This really locked in the juices.

I also added an onion, chopped, a green pepper, chopped, some chives, coarsely chopped, and a dash of red pepper flakes.

Remember to double the sauce if you're making 1.5lbs of meat. If you're only making 1lb, it's fine as is.

Not a bad recipe at all, and definitely one I'll make again (have made it three times so far), but it isn't the best I've found.

This was quite good.  Very quick and easy to prepare.  It helps to partially freeze the beef before cutting it into strips.
The only change I made to the recipe was that I went ahead and added an entire bag of the pre-cut broccoli instead of just 8 florets as garnish.  
We'll make it again.

Absolutely fabulous. Better than take-out or upscale restaurants. After cutting meat I put it on papertowels and placed in frig as suggested by another, then used 1/2 flour and 1/2 cornstarch. They fried up nicely.  I DEFINITELY recommend using the orange zest - it adds to the recipe. I will make this when ever and where ever possible. I've already shared the recipe with friends.

As written this is a solid four stars.  Adding a tablespoon of chili garlic sauce & 2 T marmalade took this over the top.  Double the sauce...you will want more.  Thanks so much...this makes a great meal.

I just made this recipe and my fiance and I were thoroughly impressed.  Definitely a dish I will make again.  I did make a couple changes after reading through each review.  I think these changes made this dish that much more delicious.  After slicing the beef (and I did use top sirloing, so glad I did as it was very flavorful and tender), I coated in the cornstarch and refrigerated for 30 minutes.  I used peanut oil in my wok as it can be heated to a higher temperature without burning and also gives the beef a nice flavor without tasting too oily.  For the sauce, I also doubled up on it as I wanted enough to coat the beef and add some to the steamed white rice.  The only thing I did not double was the sugar.  I used 1/3 cup and doubled up on each of the other ingredients.  One last addition was about a tablespoon of ginger chile sauce for a touch of heat.  With these adjustments, this turned out to be one of the best recipes I've made on this site.  I served over steamed white rice and steamed broccoli.  Will most definitely make this dish again.

Got the greatest compliment from my husband tonight. He said that this recipe is better than our favorite Chinese restaurant's Orange Beef! Wow! I used 1 lb. of sirloin steak and made the full amount of sauce, adding 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes. Nicely done, BEC! Thank you!

this was SOOOOO yummy but the sauce as is is way too sweet, so I ended up doubling everything in the sauce except the sugar.  I only had about a pound of beef and I only had white vinegar, I did add some sriachi to the sauce for a little kick

This was good.  I used pre-cubed beef from the grocery to save time.  Doubled the sauce to compensate for lots of veggies we were adding.  Used 1/3 cup fresh OJ and a few TB of marmalade instead of the concentrate and zest.  I needed to add cornstarch to the sauce at the end because it would not thicken, and that worked, but in the meantime caused the beef to overcook.  Other than that a very tasty dish.  Oh, had a very hard time making the beef "crispy."

Great recipe!  I make this at least once a month.  Kids LOVE it and so do I.  I use a pack of stir fry strip beef and slice the strips into 2 to 4 thinner strips.  I've never had trouble with it not being crispy.  I poured my OJ concentrate into an ice cube tray so I don't waste a can each time I make it!  Now I just need to defrost a cube or two.  Only thing I add are some red chili flake to heat it up a bit. I usually sub ground ginger and dried orange peel because it's what I have on hand.

this is amazing! it's my hubby's favorite homemade chinese food. omit the salt as it is completely unnecessary. I use 1/4 tsp ground ginger since fresh isn't readily available. I hae found the easiest way to bread the meat is to put it in a ziploc container with cornstarch, seal, shake vigorously, then shake into a mesh strainer over the trash can and shake off any excess. quick and easy! yum yum!

I made this recipe as written, other than doubling the sauce, adding red pepper flakes to taste and chopped onion and using marmalade rather than so much sugar.  It was very authentic-tasting -- perfect balance or sweetness, orange and garlic/ginger.  For those who found the cornstarch gummy, I would suggest that you really shake off all the excess and brown extremely well.  I used a wok, but with only about an inch of peanut oil in the bottom and browned the meat in small batches and drained well.  I made this for a Chinese New Year's banquet with seven courses and cooked the meat several hours in advance, along with prepping the seasonings and chopping the onion. I left the meat out on the counter, not refrigerated, to keep the crispiness. I had some cornstarch in the bottom of the wok when I finished browning the meat, so I completely wiped out that oil and cornstarch.  When I was ready to finish preparing the dish, I added peanut oil back into the wok, stir-fried the onion and aromatics, then tossed the beef back in -- even prior to adding the sauce.  The meat stayed nice and crispy, just as it should be!

WOW - excellent crispy beef - my family thinks it's even better than the restaurant's.  First time I made with fresh beef & it was delicious. Tonight I made it with l/o prime rib & it was equally delicious.  Instead of orange concentrate I used the juice from 1 orange and the zest from the orange - it was a festival of flavour in our mouths. My husband asked when I'm making it again!

AWESOME!  I impressed myself!  lol  This was so good that I didn't take it's picture until after first servings.  The fragrance of the orange zest and ginger was incredible.  The beef was crispy and tender. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I made some changes, I didn't place the beef in the fridge, I just put it in the cornstarch, fried it up, put it on paper towel, then I drained most of the oil, returned the cooked meat to the pan and poured the sauce in without messing with the frying of the orange peel etc. I added sliced onion, more garlic and chopped fresh broccoli. IT was AMAZING!

I thought this was great.  I did take the advice of other cooks, and doubled the sauce.  I also added more veggies - carrots, bell peppers, and water chestnuts.  Oh, and for a little kick, trying throwing in some red chili peppers.  Delish!

This was terrific! I used flank steak that I bought to make something else, so it took a while to cut it all up, but well worth the time. It looked authentic, and my half chinese roommate liked it too!

I started making this one night for dinner thinking it wasn't going to take me very long to make. The prep time was longer then I thought. I cut the beef up into small strips, that took awhile, then to dry and refrigerate and dip each peice into cornstarch, seemed to take forever. Maybe if you put the beef peices into a bowl and tosted them around to cover them with cornstarch, would have been a great way to save time.
I tweeked the recipe a little, I doubled the sauce like others suggested, I added red pepper flakes for a little heat, and I also added chopped onion to the ginger and orange zest, then cooked them in the sauce till tender. It turned out amazing! The only thing I would probably change. I would add a little more red pepper flakes maybe 2 tsp instead of one,...if you like some heat, and I wouldn't add as much grated ginger to it. All I could teast was the ginger,...but was still out of this world.
Definetly making this again!

I liked this a lot. I used fresh squeezes orange juice in place of the concentrate. My hubs wasn't crazy about it, saying he didn't like the texture of the beef. But really, what does he know? :)

Great flavor, excellent taste combo with orange zest.  Did add some red chili flakes to add some heat; also as others suggested I will double the sauce next time.  Thanks for a great post BEC!!

Pretty good but not amazing. I followed the recipe exactly for the sauce. I didn't let the beef dry in the fridge, just coated it in cornstarch and fried it in two batches in one tbsp of oil per batch.

This definitely isn't good for you, but it tastes awesome!  The broccoli and brown rice I served this with, made me feel a little less guilty for making my family beef covered in sugar for dinner.  I doubled the sauce by the way.

The beef had the exact texture that I had been wanting, but the orange overpowered everything else.  It was just too sweet to enjoy!  I will make this again and do as some other reviewers suggested, making it with less orange juice.

This is a very good recipe, but to be better and more authentic, it's missing a few ingredients.  To add flavor simmer fresh orange peel or dried orange/tangerine peel available at Asian markets.  Also, to spice it up like the restaurant, throw a few toasted Chinese peppercorns and a few dried whole red peppers....YUM!  Then you will have the real thing.

I loved the orange flavor of this dish - the only critique is that it turned out a bit too sweet for me. Next time I plan on cutting the sweetness of the sauce with a bit of beef or chicken broth (depending on the meat I use) and re-thickening the sauce with a small amount of cornstarch. Also, I would add bit of dried red pepper for some heat. To get the crispy texture, the beef has to be cooked longer than I'm used to - the coating should look golden to dark brown on both sides. I'll plan on making this again, it's a keeper!

This recipe is awesome! It is quite a bit of work and I had problems keeping the oil the right temperature but it sure does taste good. I added a bit of red pepper flakes along with the ginger, garlic and zest as per another user, but that is just because I enjoy the hot flavor. Also, I drained some thinly sliced tofu on paper towels with the beef and fried it and it was great. The sauce is too good for words. I was thinking I may add some waterchestnuts next time I cook this...

Really good- my husband made several approving comments while eating it. I substituted orange marmalade for the OJ because that's what I had and it was still fantastic. I left out the zest since the marmalade has zest in it.

I give this five stars! My husband and I really liked it.  I did everything according to the recipe, except adding some chopped green onions and a few dashes of Chinese hot sauce at the very end.  I did not have enough fresh ginger, so I put in about 1 tbsp and added about 1/2 tsp or so of powdered.  I think 3 tbsp of ginger might make it too strong.  I also found I did not need quite as much oil as called for. 1/3 cup or so was plenty for me.    It had great flavor and we both loved the crispy texture of the beef.  I will definitely make this again!

I am a huge fan of following new recipes to the letter the first time I make them.  However, this time I couldn't resist adding a tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes to the soy mixture.  I also added strips of orange bell pepper for color and seared them in sesame oil before adding the zest, ginger and garlic.  It came out BEAUTIFUL and it tasted great.  I love heat in my food but my fiancée does not.  She was a bit hesitant in letting me put in the pepper flakes, but she loved it.  The sugar balances out the heat for just the right amount of zing.  Thanks again for this excellent recipe!

Excellent flavorful meal but time consuming slicing the beef thinly and drying it.  I recommend partially freezing or partially thawing your beef because it makes it easier to slice very thin.  I also did not have time to fully dry the beef but I did lay them out on paper towels in a single layer to get some moisture out while I was preparing everything else.  I did not have any orange juice concentrate so I used regular orange juice and some extra orange zest.  It still turned out very good.  All in all I really loved this but will make it on those days when I really really want something different because it does take some time to make plus frying beef probably is not that good for you! LOL

I thought the recipe was pretty good. I don't know if I have an aversion to strong citrus flavors, but I thought the orange flavor was a tad overpowering. I think perhaps to use orange juice instead of the concentrate may help tremendously. The only change I made was to add approx 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes for a hint of heat. Otherwise recipe as written is pretty good but could be great with a few changes.

My kids liked this a lot.  I liked it not only for the taste, but the ease of preparation.  I substituted orange juice (just doubled what was indicated) because I did not have concentrate.  Next time I will not deep fry the beef but will stir fry to decrease the oil.

I thought the flavor was excellent but the beef was not crispy.  I used the original amount of sugar, 1/3 c freshly squeezed OJ and 1 tbsp of orange extract.  I also only used 1/4 c peanut oil.  My VERY PICKY family loved it.
Next time I will cut my beef very small to crisp it up a little.  I was hoping for the crispness of PF Changs mongolian beef. Overall it was very easy and VERY yummy.

This was a pretty fair start at making the Crispy Orange Beef.  I used the cornstarch for the beef, I tried a couple of strips with flour as others stated, but you don't end up with the same crispness.  Let the beef sit in the cornstarch for 5-10 before you place it in the skillet.  Like other I couldn't find 'rice wine vinegar' there is rice vinegar, I used about half the about called for, replaced the other half with beef broth.  Next time will cut the rice vinegar down further.  I also double the sauce since we like these types of items a little more saucy.  I used Minute Rice instead of the long cooking rice, for speed, works fine.  I also used frozen broccoli spears, steamed them in the mircrowave until hot & still somewhat firm.  Will try this recipe again with some moderate changes.

The recipe called for Rice Wine Vinegar...well, I have rice wine and I have rice vinegar, but I didn't have rice wine vinegar.  I used the Rice Vinegar on a whim.  This was a good dish, I'm torn though because of all the effort that was placed to make this for something you can get at a take-out restaurant and the clean up thereafter - BUT I like knowing what's in my food (i.e. no MSG or bad beef...) so because of all that - this is a keeper.  Very complex flavor - I didn't think it was too sweet (maybe because I used the rice vinegar instead of the rice wine??)  Also, I didn't have enough ginger and it was very gingery - I think the recipe calls for too much I can see where that can be overpowering but overall it was great.

Excellent. I sprinkled the beef with meat tenderizer before drying and omitted the salt.  I also used just enough oil to brown one side at a time.  My husband and I both loved it - we will be adding it to our regular meal list!

This was delicious! Thanks for the recipe. Better than the restaurant's! My boyfriend really liked it too. I made the sauce ahead of time to see if I liked it before I made the dish, and I thought it tasted great. I was burned once before when I tried to make an orange dish.  I was also afraid to use orange zest, maybe I'll try a little bit next time. I also used very little ground ginger (I don't care for ginger much) and only a little bit of garlic. After I steamed the broccoli, I also mixed it in the pan so that it would have the orange sauce flavor.

A little too much orange for our family; however, I grated rather than zested the orange.  Also, I added about 1/2 tsp. red pepper flake to the sauce (gave it just the right kick).  Served with brown basmati rice (1 hour cook time but worth it).  I also added some grated ginger to the rice (tastes great and a wonderful aromatic compliment to the dish).

I tried this recipe with beef and then again w/ chicken. We all agree that the chicken version was tastier but the beef was pretty good too. I found that there is just barley enough sauce for 1.5 lbs of meat but it works and it is on the borderline of being too sweet but overall - this is a very good recipe. Other than trying chicken, I didn't change a thing either time. Thanks BEC.

This is a pretty tasty recipe.  It seemed a little complicated but I think I tried to do too much at one time.  Next time I should have all my prep work done before hand.  The sauce is really good, I used the juice of one fresh orange instead of the concentrate, it gave it a very fresh flavor.  We could have used more sauce though.  Also, I'm not sure I liked the taste of the cornstarch on the beef but maybe there was too much on it or something.  

Will try this one again, maybe we'll add some chile paste next time for a little heat and will try with less sugar.

The sauce is the secret ingredient - a bit on the sweet side, but tempered by the broccoli.  The family agreed: "Yes, make it again sometime."  I really didn't follow the recipe very closely, but was pleased that it came out well so that I didn't waste 1-1/2 lbs. of beef. I didn't coat the beef in corn starch and fry it, I simply sliced it thin and browned it using olive oil spray.  I also added sauteed, coarsely chopped onion (which I browned prior to browning the beef).  I also used 4 cups of broccoli florets instead of the small amount listed.  I decreased the ginger to only 2 TBSP because 3 seemed like an awful lot.  A word of caution:  If you use dried orange zest, only add about 1 tsp. instead of 2.  The next time I make this, I will probably add a few thin, diagonally sliced carrots for additional color.  So, maybe I didn't make this exact recipe, but the secret is in the sauce, anyway!  :-)

This dish was fairly easy and tasted great! It's definitely a good idea to double the sauce mixture.

This is simply so good I  can barely believe it. When I was looking for something new and delicious to make with sirloin that I had the ingredients for and found this I hit the jackpot! Yes, make double the sauce. Yes, Gina (Jan. 9, 2006) is brilliant with her little but significant additions - a drop of sesame oil, a dash of Siracha Hot Chili Sauce, and a tiny bit of marmalade, then topping the final dish with a sprinkle of green onion and sesame seeds just MAKES it. Thank you so much allrecipes.com and Gina!! No time to take a photo, just had to dig right in. It was so good.

This recipe was fantastic!  I surprised myself with how good it actually turned out.  We love asian style cooking and I've always wanted to make orange beef or orange chicken.  This recipe was sitting in my recipe box for a long while so I decided to go for it! I made exactly as stated except I served it with sesame noodles instead of rice. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing! My hubby gave me a high five and agreed to buying a wok so I can experiment more.  A new wok AND a great recipe....what more could I ask for?

This turned out very well!  The flavors are excellent. It's crispy, sweet, and tangy.  I'm dinging a star because you really need to double the amount of sauce for the amount of meat.  If I had not doubled the sauce, it would not have covered the beef.  I followed the recipe exactly with only two exceptions - I used half brown sugar and half white which I think imparts a richer flavor than the white only would do.  I also eliminated the salt as I thought the soy sauce would be salty enough and only used 2T of the ginger.  The next time I make this I will add some red pepper flakes as we like a bit of a kick.  This took me longer than indicated, but as I worked I figured out more efficient ways of working this and next time will do a couple of things differently.  First, I will slice the meat in the morning and throw it in a baggie, then set it to 'dry' while mixing up the sauce and prepping the rice.  Cornstarch and beef can be tossed in a baggie and then the excess can be shaken off in a fine mesh sieve which helps reduce the amount of cornstarch accumulating in the oil.  Those two choices make this something that can easily be accomplished for a weeknight dinner. Overall, this is a really nice recipe!

Solid recipe, I enjoyed it. I think maybe next time I might sub in brown sugar and use a bit less vinegar, I wanted something a bit more caramel-y, I think the combo of so much rice vinegar and white sugar gave it almost a burnt sugar taste. Still delicious, I'd just prefer a slightly mellower flavor.

Awesome!!  My husband said 'it looks just like Chinese" when I served it lol...I made a few changes.  I doubled the sauce, used half the sugar, didn't have OJ concentrate, so I used regular (about 2/3 cup), I didn't double the vinegar, just used enough for a single serving of sauce, didn't have fresh ginger, so I used 2 teaspoons of ground ginger, and I completely forgot about the salt, and I don't feel it needed any.  I will definitely make again.  The sauce is excellent.  I would like to try it with the OJ concentrate next time.

This was very good. I added extra orange ingredients to suit my tastes.  I will put it on my remake list.  Next time I will let it get a bit more crispy though.

I didn't care for this, but both boys did, hence the 3-star rating. The beef did not stay crispy, especially once it was added back to the sauce- It became a cornstarch-y goo. The sauce alright, maybe a touch too sweet but we had to alter it based on the ingredients we had on hand; diluted white vinegar, orange liqueur, dried ginger in a decreased amount, less garlic and less zest (used dried) in place the proper ingredients. The meat-cornstarch-goo really didn't do it for me but the boys will eat the leftovers. Served it with green/wax beans and baby carrots and rice.

I am giving this 3 stars because my husband and BIL did not have anything good to say about it except that it was very crispy....I personally thought it was great and I did not have any rice wine vinegar so I diluted some white wine vinegar which is a good substitute. Thank u for a good recipe!

This dish is delicious.  It was a bit too sweet and I'll reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup next time.  I also added a tablespoon of Sriracha sauce to spice it up.

This was really nice, I changed up the sauce a bit but the foundation of the recipe is good.  My husband loved it and that is why I am giving it 5 stars.  Since I have just moved (again) I had limited ingriedients so I cheated and used VJ's orange ginger stir fry sauce.  I love that stuff, served with rice and broccoli.

omg. delicious! however you make the sauce, make sure you double it. first time I made this I doubled the sauce, and there's no way the sauce from the original recipe would be enough... here's how I did my sauce: 2/3c. white sugar. 2/3 c. rice wine vinegar. 2 tbsps orange marmalade (I prefer that to the oj concentrate, it has orange slices/chunks in it) 2 overflowing tbsps of soy sauce, 1 tsp hot pepper sauce (I use Sriracha paste, but franks red hot or anything like that would work), which helps to cut the sweetness a bit... then ONE tbsp grated fresh ginger, I think 3 would be too much.. and then stuck to the 2 tsps of orange zest, and did 3 tbsps minced garlic. for the veggies I used a mix of red pepper, snow peas, water chesnuts, some bean sprouts, and fresh broccoli. The sauce on this is a winner, I made it a week later, same exact recipe, with grilled chicken. it was jsut as tasty... would also go good with sliced pork roast/tenderloin, and I would also like to try this sauce sometime with ribs or deep-fried wings! yummm!

This is soooo yummy!  It tastes just like restaurant crispy orange beef!  We made the recipe exactly as printed, except we cooked the broccoli in the wok with some garlic and added some soy sauce to it in the end.  The beef turned out crispy, sweet, and stickily delicious.  It's a lot of work, but definitely worth the effort (and the clean-up).  Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this recipe with us!!

followed recipe as noted, but did add orange marmalade in addition to juice concentrate, and used less ginger as others noted as it did sound like a lot, came out perfect. Also refridgerated beef for 30 minutes AFTER coating with corn starch, came out perfectly crispy. Cooked in deep fryer though.

Really good.  I'm surprised I was able to make something so restaurant-style.  I didn't have orange juice so I used orange marmalade. Following the other reviewers, I doubled everything in the sauce except the sugar.  We had too much sauce, so maybe 1.5 times the sauce is the perfect amount.  It isn't exactly healthy, but for an occasional treat it was very tasty.

This was good the first time, but excellent the next.  The difference is that I reduced the amount of sugar to a 1/4 cup & the dish was not nearly as sweet.  Will definitely make again.

Very good! I had to use lime juice in place of the rice wine vinegar. Doubled the sauce and it was lip smackin' good. My husband's friend said he liked it so much and wanted the recipe even though he doesn't cook. Maybe he was inspired ;)

really loved this! I used a tri-tip sirloin and added snow peas in to cook with the sauce. I thought the flavor was very good though i could have done with less cornstarch. The meat was tender and cooked quickly. a defiant repeat.

This is excellent. My family loves it the way it is, no changes. We almost always serve it with rice and steamed or stir-fried broccoli. It is worth the time and the calories, if you are counting them

All I could taste was the orange and the sauce was way too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't like it at all. I ended up going out to dinner instead!

This was really good!  It turned out nice and crispy, the only thing I changed was I skipped the orange zest because I dont like overpowering citrus flavors and thought it was just right.  Next time I might cut back the sugar just a touch as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Earlier today I cooked a plate of fried rice that was way too mushy, so to make it up, I decided to cook a dish that my son would like, and to my relief, this fit the bill. He enjoyed it. I made it with OJ, and that was the only change I did. Thank you for sharing.

Very tasty!  It gets 5 stars for taste, but 3 stars for preparation.  It is messy and time consuming. I used 1/3 c. of orange juice since I didn't have any concentrate.  I was out of fresh ginger and broccoli so I substituted powdered ginger and carrots and bell peppers. Also, instead of frying it in cups of oil, I sauteed it in small batches in a couple of tablespoons of oil.  As a result, it wasn't particularly crispy, but still very good. Oh, and I used peanut oil which I think was perfect for this, gave it an authentic Asian flavor. I served this over brown rice.

I thought this was quite tasty. As other reviewers mentioned, it does take a bit of time to prepare, but overall quite manageable. I did not use orange juice concentrate, instead I just used regular orange juice. This was a tad bit on the sweet side, but I added some red pepper flakes to the sauce and that seemed to counter balanced the sweetness. Overall a good recipe and I would defintely recommend using regular oj.

Awesome recipe!! The only thing I would say is it definately does not need the 1/3 cup of sugar... my mother and I both found it overly sweet. I will be cutting the amount in half for next time

This was REALLY good. I will make this again ..... but with a FEW minor changes .... specifically: It needs more sauce for the rice(double it) because the cornstarch sucks it into almost nothing. Second, I think I will add a tbsp of red pepper flakes just because I've had spicy orange beef in a few Szechuan restaurants and liked it ... but ... this recipe, as written, works beautifully. Cheers!!!

This was really good. My soy sauce was really salty, so next time I will omit the added salt. I froze the beef partially and it was very easy to slice. GIGI's idea about the collander to shake off excess corn starch was perfect. For those who's beef was not crispy, the secret is small batches and hot oil. I also doubled the sauce since I stir fried lots of vegetables to go with this, and tossed them with the beef and the sauce. Next time I will remember to also double the garlic and ginger if I'm doubling sauce.To cut down on prep, I used Trader Joe's frozen microwavable jasmine rice that is always great. I think that made it so much easier in the long run.

Fabulous sauce.  I need to figure out a way to make it crisp, without too crisp.  I used real orange pulp and squeezed juice (1/3 cup) instead of concentrate or zest.

First of all, always always double the sauce! That having been said, if you read my reviews you'll see that I'm stingy with the stars.  If I ever give something five stars, it has rocked my taste buds.  This one get five and a half stars.  The ginger, garlic and orange come together beautifully.  You've just got to try this one.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I had to modify this recipe quite a bit but it worked well!!!  I used very inexpensive lean steak - the frying keeps it tender anyway. I don't have frozen orange juice from concentrate nor white wine but it still came out so authentic.  instead of OJ concentrate I used the juice of a bitter orange, just a squeeze.  Instead of rice wine vinegar I used a dry white wine and some fruit vinegar.  I like my food more spicy so I also added chili powder to the soy sauce mix.  I too let the beef sit after I coated the pieces with cornstarch and I also cooked it very well in small batches almost until you could hear the oil stop sizzling. That was the key for me for getting them super crispy.   It tasted like it came from a high end Asian restaurant, I loved this recipe!!!

as others have said, this very near mimics the flavors you'd find at your local take-out.  i used half the sugar, a 1/3 cup of oj (instead of concentrate), 1 1/4 tsp ground ginger (instead of fresh), and skipped the zest.  also, to keep it healthier, i lightly pan fried the meat and only added a 1/4 tsp of salt to the sauce.  fantastic!

The grated zest was a little cloying, so I recommend using less than a teaspoon.  I would also double or triple the soy sauce to equalize the sweet/salty balance.  I stir fried the beef in sesame and veg oil ina wok to cut down on the fat.

This tasted great. In my experience, cooking Chinese food usually results in a dish that was a lot of trouble to make and wasn't as good as what you could have gotten from a restaurant. This dish is a notable exception. It was delicious and had lots of flavor. The only changes I made were to use orange juice instead of concentrate and to omit using the zest. The orange flavor came through but wasn't overpowering. I also cooked the broccoli in the sauce, and there was plenty of sauce for the broccoli and the beef without doubling the amount. This one's a keeper!

Maybe I did something wrong but it was WAY TOO SWEET even after reducing the sugar. Beef was not crispy even after waiting all that extra time (30 min in fridge and 10 min in cornstarch)

Fabulous!  My husband said it was as good as the Chinese restaurant he would eat at every day.  The only changes made were to double the sauce and reduce the sugar, as suggested by other reviewers.  This one will definitely be in our rotation.

I doubled the sauce and doubled the orange zest too. Wow!  The flavor was intense.  My husband thought the flavor was a little too much.  I liked it, although it would have been better with less intense orange flavor. Next time I won't double the orange zest.  Still better than any take out!  Also, only added half of the ginger per other reviews and that was the right thing to do.  Otherwise, it would have been overpowering too.
The key to crispy, not overcooked beef strips is to make sure your oil is very hot.  Also, I took the advice of other reviewers and waited ten minutes after coating them with cornstarch before frying them. Their done after a few minutes.  Don't walk away from them!

I made this last night and am eating the leftovers right now. I added about 3 tsp of chili paste for heat and it's just about perfect. I did triple the sauce - the only other thing I'll change next time is to add a little less vinegar. Somehow, I added too much and it's a tad more sour than it should be.

This recipe works great with the added tips by others. Definetly let the meat rest after the corn starch. We used tri tip steak and it was great! Add 1/2 tsp red peppers to the sauce to spice it up a bit.

This was really great and a different recipe.  I think I used too much orange concentrate or got too much orange zest in the sauce because it made my lips pucker, but it was still great served over fried rice.  I will definately make again.

This was awesome!  I used 1/3 ginger called for in the recipe per everyone's suggestion.  There were no leftovers!  My kids, ages 7 and 10, were just ok with the recipe.  My husband and I were the 5 star raters.

Very good recipe! Used fresh orange juice instead of frozen concentrate and a little extra soya sauce in place of the salt. I would cut back on the ginger next time as it was a little overpowering. Apart from that it's a very tasty and easy to prepare meal.

Way too much ginger in this recipe. I would cut it down to maybe about 1/2teaspoon compared to the 3 Tablespoons it requires.  It was to potent I couldn't eat it.

me personally i would have given this two stars but due to my very picky hubby liking it i gave it three. i'm gonna try this again but next time with chicken...i thought the sauce was good but extremely sweet...my kids thought it was supposed to go on ice cream because it resembled caramel sauce.(which of course they are three and four) i just wasnt crazy about the sirloin with it...maybe its just me who knows

I used regular OJ and plain vinegar.  It came out a little less orangey than what Im used to so I just added 2 tablespoons of orange marmalade at the end.  It was ok.

I also cut up an onion and put it in with the garlic/orange zest since I didnt have any broccoli.

This was a half and half rating in our house tonight. Hubby and youngest teenage daughter thought it was so so, however, older daughter thought it was great. I don't eat beef but I took a taste and I thought it was really good. I do feel that if I hadn't added onions, green bell pepper and a few red pepper flakes it wouldn't have been nearly as good. I thought the sauce was awesome but some of the complaints I heard were from the beef being a bit too crispy. I thought that was the whole point but I guess they would have liked it a bit more tender. I've reviewed about 700 recipes so far and this is the first one that I've felt was very time consuming, so make sure you start this early. I still say thanks BEC for a really good dish.

Delicious! Not too difficult to make, and smells good, too. Husband said it was better than take-out, and I had to agree. I used powdered ginger instead of fresh, other than that followed recipe exactly. I had only a pound of meat, and I'm glad I didn't use 1.5 pounds, because there would not have been enough sauce for all that meat. Will definitely make again.

OHMIGOSH, THIS WAS SO YUMMY!  My husband's favorite dish at Chinese restaurants is always Orange Beef and he said he liked this one the best!!!  I loved the fresh ginger and garlic (used a little more) and next time will make more sauce.  The only problem:  we must be pigs, because we ate up the entire recipe between us, not even close to the 6 servings suggested.  At our house, we deem a recipe excellent if it's "servable" (to company) and this one definitely made our list.  Thanks, BEC!

This was delicious BEC.  I make a similar version of this called "Spicy Crispy Beef" also found on allrecipes...but is a bit different.  I added chopped red bell pepper to this and stir-fried cauliflower rather than broccoli.  My son loves this and calls it "spicy duck"....but at least he eats it!  Thanks for sharing this.

It smelled great.  The crispy beef turned out perfect.  We agreed that there was too much ginger.  Need to cut it down by a lot.  Maybe less sugar.  It was really sweet.  Also it could be spicier.  It wasn't spicy at all.

Decent, but a little too salty.  If I make it again, I will probably use more zest, no salt (the soy sauce is enough), and replace some of the sugar with honey.

This was very good, though labor intensive. A great dish for guests.  I did not have rice vinegar, but used red wine vinegar. Also I used regular orange juice and it all turned out great!! Just like at the chinese restaurants, but in a lot of way better!  I will definitely do this again, but leave some time for prep!

The cornstarch didn't stick to the beef so well when I fried it so it wasn't so crispy. I also thought the sauce had too much ginger--we were all tearing when we smelled it! I don't think I will make this dish again.

WoW!  This was great!  I don't have a Wok, so I just used a large skillet, and it turned out amazing.  I had some beef left over, and used it the next day in a swiss cheese sandwich.  Simply amazing.  This is definitely a keeper.  I also used 1/3 cup OJ, and didn't use as much beef as the recipe called for (as it was for 2 of us), and I would probably double the sauce if I were to use the full amount of meat.

Took alot of time, but it was worth it. I drained all of the oil and used 1 tablespoon of fresh oil when doing the sauce, there was quite a bit of the cornstarch in the bottom of my pan that I did not want to have in my sauce and it turned out wonderful. I used ginger powder instead of fresh, seemed to be fine. 

I have made this twice now, the second time was with chicken, I loved it, it was almost better then with beef.

Wow! I made this tonight and man is it tasty! It smelled wonderful, too. As I was making it I thought it was taking too much time and attention to make very often (although it wasn't difficult) but when I tasted it I think I changed my mind. The fam dug it. I will probably make it for company or next time I bring a dish to church. As for the orange zest, I don't have a zester so I just grated the outside of the orange then chopped it up a little with the spatula while it was cooking with the sauce in the pan. It was fine. The leftovers were just as crispy the next day. Maybe sprinkle with sesame seeds next time for decoration?

Prepared this recipe last night and we enjoyed it.  It was not too sweet and definitely tasty. I do think the coating benefits from the addition of egg white with the cornstarch for crispness of the final product, which is how I usually prepare it.     Chinese Orange Beef is a Szechwan dish which we prefer to be more spicy hot.  That is not meant to deter someone else from trying this dish. Not everyone likes 'hot' dishes.

Very good.  I doubled sauce as many suggested.  I added a touch of sriracha, red pepper, and sesame oil.  Rather than deep frying beef I pan fried in a much smaller amount of oil and merely deglazed the pan with a little orange juice when I was done cooking the meat before starting the sauce.

I really like this dish with beef but love it with boneless  chicken thighs. I would recommend making a lil more sauce then what the recipe calls for. I served it over Goya yellow rice with some spring rolls and we really had a good meal!

This was super easy to make and we loved it! It was better than the local chinese take out places for sure! I always follow the recipes as listed, otherwise if I make a ton of changes well then that's not the recipe!  So, as is, 5 stars!  I made it my own 6 stars by adding some green onion, and I added thinly decided orange pieces the last 5 minutes of cooking my jasmine rice - I always add something to my rice that goes with whatever it's going with. I will make this again, and no doubt again..and again..Thank you!

I did everything by the directions and had a bad experience. The beef was not crispy. Not sure what went wrong. The sauce tasted of vinegar and orange. The vinegar was too strong for me. It was irritating while cooking. Again, not sure how to fix or why it went wrong. I will not be making this again.

This is the most amazing dish I have made using this site.  I created an account just to give this recipe a great review.  I was kind of skeptical when making the sauce with as much ginger as it called for but it came out beautifully!

I've never reviewed a recipe on this site even after probably 10 years and hundreds of recipes tried, mainly because I didn't feel like I had anything to add that hadn't already been said.  So first of all, thanks for the great recipe.  I have some non-steak eaters in the house so I wanted to make a chicken version in addition to the steak.  I cooked the steak and chicken separately and then threw everything (including the cooked broccoli) together after the sauce had boiled down. For the sauce, I followed other's advice and doubled everything.  I substituted agave for white sugar as written but it was probably still a little sweet for how I would prepare for the next time.  I completely omitted salt and I added 2 tbs of sriracha for some heat.  Overall a great recipe and it will be a regular in my house. I wish I had taken a photo because it looked great but it was gone too fast!!

This came out amazing! My husband said it tastes like it was from "a really good chinese restuarant." He was completely amazed.  I actually was too - I couldn't believe it was something I made! It really made this new wife of 2 months look great! ( I followed the recipe as it was - no alterations )

Prep time was way longer than 20 minutes, and the beef is not at all crispy. The sauce is good, but you need to at least double it. The sauce also needs something to give it a kick - red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper or something.  It's good; there is just no spice to it.  All in all, it was okay, but not worth all the hassle.

A really good recipe. Used fresh orange juice over frozen but that was the only modification. This is a crowd pleasing recipe. Made it for a group and they raved.

Loved this! Did make a few changes. Used only half of the vinegar, used honey instead of  sugar and added sriracha sauce. I also seasoned the meat after frying with salt , pepper flakes and garlic powder.

This recipe was excellent!  A key is to make certain to cook the beef until it is truly crispy and dark in color; do not remove from heat when just cooked through.  I had to use powdered ginger and regular orange juice (this is what I had on hand), and it was still delicious. It was a huge hit in our house and will find a spot in our regular meal rotation.

This was REALLY good.  I used about  1 1/2 T. of fresh grated ginger. The amount listed, as others have noted, must be a typo.  Everything else I followed exactly.  It was exceptional.  Everyone loved it.  I cooked the beef in peanut oil as another review suggested.  It was fairly crispy outside and tender inside.  The sauce was perfect. I think this would make a great appetizer, too, served with toothpicks.

We loved it.  I wanted to use venison instead of beef, so I made two batches of the sauce, one to marinate the venison in and one to use as the recipe calls for.  I did everything else exactly as the recipe called for.

Flavor was there, the sauce was wonderful (definitely double it though). My beef didn't end up very crispy though, but I think that's just user error and next time I"ll be frying the beef for longer. I added in a bunch of other veggies and it definitely satisfied my craving for asian food. Even my extremely picky eater husband loved it! Will definitely make again.

I thought the flavor of this recipe was very good.  I like the tip of drying the beef in the fridge. I also tenderized the beef prior to slicing. However, I did not want to fry my beef, so I used my wok and stir-fried.  The result did not come out crispy, but it was tasty and I would make again.

I altered this recipe a little for my taste. I used half of the ginger and hot sauce. Added a little more honey, brown sugar and a pinch of white sugar. I took others advice and lightly floured the chicken before frying. I also put red, orange, yellow and green peppers in it. And fried up some shrimp in the sauce to add after it was all cooked. Turned out awesome.  I will definitely make this again. It's a bit spicy but not overly and soo tasty. Great recipe!!!

Pretty darn good, as written. I doubled the sauce, as suggested by another rating and so glad I did!! If anything, I'd add some heat behind it next time. It was delicious and will definitely make another appearance in my home.

Yummo. Next time as soon as the beef is ready to go on the plate I will squeeze the orange that I used for the zest over the dish. It didn't quite have the deep orange flavour that I was expecting. This was an enjoyable meal. I served with roasted broccoli recipe from this site and brown rice. Thanks BEC

I had to tweak this recipe a lot for it to be great. But, rating it as is; 2 stars. It was DEFINITELY way too sweet. Was not spicy at all which it said it would be. Beef was not crunchy either. Made it again using orange juice & orange marmalade, cut the sugar in half, used 1 tsp of ginger, doubled everything else, as well as added a tablespoon of asian garlic chili paste. Was much better the second time around! Would be a 4 star recipe with my adjustments

I LOVED this recipe! It was so delicious and very authentic tasting. I read many of the reviews though before making it and decided to do as a few of them suggested and use the orange marmalade and actual orange juice in lieu of the frozen OJ concentrate (1/3 c. OJ and 2 Tbsp orange marmalade). I also added a 1/2 tsp. of Siracha chili sauce as another person suggested and this was simply amazing! I had no problem with crispiness for the meat, as I followed the other comments of letting the meat set for at least 10 mins. with the corn starch on it and made sure the grease was hot enough. I will definitely be making this again! =)

My recommendation for those of you that are not getting crispy beef to make sure that you are using a very lean cut of beef (no marbling), to make certain you are cutting the slices as thin as possible, to cook only about a fourth of the portion at one time at a high temp in about 1/4 cup of oil.  You can add more oil if needed.

I thought this tasted pretty good. It was reminiscent of a dish from an upscale Asian restaurant. I had 1/2 lb stir fry beef, so I just made 1/2 recipe. The only change I made was reducing the ginger, just because I find it to be too strong, and I only used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and it was plenty to crisp the beef. I can't imagine needing 1-2 cups. I steamed the broccoli in the microwave and just made some brown rice, in my rice cooker, to go on the side. I would suggest using pre-cut stir fry beef, it saved a lot of time. ty

Too tangy. Vinegar flavor is too strong, and sauce could use some corn starch for thickening. The second time, I tried making a modified version of the sauce from "Addictive Sesame Chicken" recipe on here for this... 1/2 cup OJ, 1 cup beef broth, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup cornstarch, 1 cup white sugar, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tsp orange zest, 1 tbs minced garlic, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, cayenne pepper to taste. Gives it a much sweeter taste.

Absolutely delicious! I double the recipe (but use only the 1/3 c of sugar) and it is amazing. After having made this a few times as written, I have made some minor changes. 

First, I omit adding salt, as it is so flavor-packed, salt's not necessary. I steam the broccoli separately, as the recipe calls for, but then I toss it into the beef just before serving so that it can soak up some of the sauce. It gives the broccoli great flavor and makes it more of a one dish meal.

BTW, the beef isn't crispy, but I can tell that if I leave it in the wok longer, it probably will crisp up a little more. But my daughter won't eat crispy foods, so I don't do it. I don't think it needs it either, as the flavor is more important than any crunch. As other reviewers have mentioned, I think that the sauce would go well with chicken, pork, or tofu, too.

Wow! This was fabulous! I doubled the sauce as many suggested...put half the sugar and it turned out amazingly! I put quite a bit more orange zest and grated fresh ginger. The only thing I found was the vinegar was a little too strong, next time I will put less. Also if anyone does not have the orange juice concentrate, I used fresh orange juice and it thickened up nicely. Will definitely make this one again!

This turned out really great, not a single rice grain left. Also doubled the sauce and it was perfect, so will definitely make it again.

This is a delicious recipe, as many reviewers have documented.   It's the third wok recipe I've ever tried making (not a highly skilled wok cook, but can now get by without screwing up or burning anything.)

I came across this one by searching the web for anythingclose to this, because I was wanting to make something like it with some extra steak I'd bought on sale, but had never seen nor sampled such a dish.   Fortunately I had the wok and almost all the ingredients save the corn starch and juice concentrate already.

It may take you close to an hour and a half to make this the first time around, but the effort is worth it.  Subsequent efforts should be easier.  I suggest cutting it in half the first go to test.

My sauce came out slightly too thick and darkened, but that was my fault not the recipe's.  I had left slightly too much oil in the pan, thus while cooking down the sauce I had to reduce it longer to make up for this, but still wasn't burnt, and still tasty.

My only real improvement to this dish is to add 2 tbsp ground fresh chili paste (Chinese wet condiment) to the sauce when you start cooking it.  Adds just enough kick.  Also reduce the ginger at least half and don't fret over the fresh stuff, when your spice rack will do.  

Finally, the OJ concentrate can be replaced with liquid OJ, as long as you increase the quantity at least 75% (recommend pulp free).  I also add a touch more soy sauce/vinegar and bit less sugar.

Enjoy!

This dish is full of flavor.  I only had 2 TBL spoons of fresh ginger.  I think the 3rd would have been to strong for us.

My family felt the orange was a bit too predominate a flavor.  I will use 1/2 of the concentrate and 1/2 of the zest next time.  We loved the texture of the beef!

I made this tonight and it was delicious. However I did omit the orange zest. But I will add it next time. The flavor was great and I did make a double batch of the sauce as other reviewers suggested.. oh and I did not fry it in all that oil i just added enough to cook the meat. turned out great too.

This is one of my favourite dishes!  It's soooo yummy.  I take the leftovers to the office for lunch, and everyone around me asks "what smells so good?!" and I get many requests for the recipe.  It's perfect as is, wouldn't change a thing.

4.5 Stars: I used flank steak and doubled the sauce. I was afraid of burning the meat, but the crispiest pieces were the best.  I will crisp them all next time. The sauce was really good with the blanched broccoli, too.  This seems time-consuming, but my husband said it's one of the best Asain dishes I have made.

I thought this was excellent.  I usually don't cook too many things in oil because of fat content, but the reviews tempted me to try it, and I'm glad I did, we loved it.  The beef was awesome, I loved the orang-y asian glaze, it was awesome.  I had some left-over spaghetti noodles, so I cooked some broccoli into the beef and sauce, and tossed it with the noodles.  It was great!!

Fantastic! Used 4-year old venison loin and it was spectacular. Next time I'll reduce the sugar a bit. Didn't have broccoli, so added some home-grown frozen peas.

This was super easy to do, and tasted almost exactly like restaurant quality crispy beef. I found the sweetness of the orange flavour just a touch overwhelming and would suggest that the added orange juice concentrate could be cut in half and the orange zest be doubled. That would preserve a more subtle orange flavour and aroma. Also, while I appreciate that this is supposed to be a mild dish, it benefits greatly from a teaspoon of crushed hot peppers, added at the same time as the zest, ginger, and garlic.

As a vegetarian, I use tofu instead of beef, but the real star in this recipe is the SAUCE. It's absolutely amazing. It is rather on the sweet side, but I enjoy that once in a while. However, I would suggest making a double batch of the sauce because it doesn't go all that far in your meal!

This is the best Asian type dish I have made at home yet.  Normally I am left wishing mine had tasted more like a restaurant I would normally get that particular dish at.  Not this one, my entire family loved this dish!  I made a couple minor changes just due to diet restrictions (spelt flour-1/2 cup instead of corn starch, honey instead of sugar, and balsamic due to soy sauce) so it may have been even better had I not made the revisions.  Thank you for sharing, will be making again and again!

I thought the recipe called for too much oil.  My beef was not crisp enough and seemed like it had a mushy cornstarch texture.  The sauce was good, but I did only did 2 tbsp of ginger bc 3 tbsp is too much for me.  I will try cooking again but work on getting the texture of the beef perfected

Make this all the time. DELISH! I substitute either chicken or tofu in place of the beef.

This came out well, but I personally felt the sauce had too much of a vinegar taste. My roommates disagreed, but the next time I made it I tweaked the measurements a bit and it tasted much better. We also stirred in some cornstarch to thicken the sauce a little because it takes a very long time otherwise. I will definitely make it again, just be aware that you may need to adjust the sauce to your own taste.

Except for adding some crushed chiles for a bit of heat, I made this exactly as shown and it was excellent! The trick to making the beef crispy is to slice very thinly against the grain and cook it until it is truly browned. This is a great recipe & definitely a keeper in our house!  Thanks for sharing!!

Like others I halved the sugar and doubled the sauce.  This was wonderful - really captured the flavor of takeout.  It was moderately labor intensive but well worth the effort!

The first time I had Orange Beef was at a long gone Korean restaurant in the late 70's. I've ordered it over the years, but it never compares to what I had there. This recipe is my hero. The crispiness here is the secret ingredient in reviving my favorite Orange Beef memories.  I used a little less sugar. Instead of garlic I added about 1/8 tsp. of chili paste with garlic, which is always in my refrigerator. This helped mimic the Korean slant with a tiny bit of heat. Use this carefully. A lttle goes a long way.  I, too added about 1/4 cup of oj instead of concentrate, and I used white wine vinegar, because that's what I had. I used dried orange peel bits from a spice jar, for the same reason,  no more than 1 tsp. I thought 3 tbsp of ginger would make me change the name of the recipe to Ginger Beef, so I only used one. I used leftover rare London Broil sliced thinly, and cooked it again as the recipe says. Loved it. This way orange flavor was subtle, as were the influences of the ginger and chili paste with garlic. Nothing overpowered-nice balance.  Might have liked a little more sauce, as I ended up with only what stuck to the beef pieces. Maybe deglaze the wok after finished cooking and pour it around the edges of the serving bowl to keep the beef crispy and still have a little sauce for the rice.

I thought it was awesome, and I followed it exactly. But the rest of my family sort of pushed it around their plates. It maybe be best for people who don't mind sweet mains.

The sauce was excellent! Made as written except for substituting 1/3 c orange juice for the orange juice concentrate. I think I will try this with chicken next time. Might cut the sugar to 1/4 c next time (was just a bit too sweet for our taste). Overall - fantastic!

Absolutely delicious! I made this almost exactly (the only change: slightly less vinegar, but only slightly). I never need go to the Chinese restaurant for Orange Beef again! Cooking tip: Use a thermometer to precisely measure the oil's temperature; allow the oil to come back up to deep frying temperature between batches.

First; I do not think it tastes like the popular food chains similar dish.  Second; I think the sauce tasted better before adding the ginger.  If I were to make this again I would not add the ginger.

Delicious! I followed the advice of the top reviewers and got great results by letting the cornstarch sit on the beef for at least 10 minutes and then frying  in 4 or 5 small batches in 1 T oil at a time. The beef was nicely browned and crispy, and I used only a small fraction of the oil that the recipe calls for, but I did need more cornstarch to get the meat coated. I would recommend cutting back on the sugar by about half. I doubled the amount of sauce, but next time I might make even more sauce. I also used more broccoli. Beautiful looking and great tasting.

This was really good!!  I used a slab of beef I already had in the freezer, and cut into strips while the piece was still partially frozen.  I think it helped me keep the beef slices thin.  I also didn't have orange concentrate, so I juiced 3 big oranges, but kept the zest the same.  I look forward to making this again.  Thanks!

Awesome flavor! Double the sauce, you'll want lots.  Use thin cuts of beef and they are more likely to come out crispy.  You won't regret making this.

I made this twice today it was so good. The first time I followed the recipe only cutting down on the ginger. It was very good but the sauce thickened up too much to me because I wanted it to drip into the rice so the second time I made it I used orange juice (already made) instead of the frozen  concentrate and it was just perfect. I will be making this again and again.

I'm not a huge fan of beef in Asian cooking so I used chicken breasts, thinly sliced.  This was the only change I made and I thought it was very authentic tasting, more so than any other recipes I've tried.  Delicious!

a little bit too sweet. I think I would have enjoyed it more with a little kick to it and a little less of the sweet orange flavor but the meat was very good and everyone cleared their plates so I can't complain too much! I would have giving it 3 starts but based on the rest of the family I gave it 4.

My husband loved me tonight :)  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  I had to make some changes because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used clementines for the zest and juice.  Had to use cider vinegar and ground ginger (3 ts).  Still great!  I added a bit of hot sauce and sesame oil.

I love this recipe!!  I've learned to prepare everything and have the sauce mixed ahead of time, because once you start stir frying things happen really fast.  I serve this over jasmine rice and with a side of steamed broccoli.  Delicious!!

Oh my!  This is simply divine!  I doubled the sauce becasue I wasn't quite sure how much meat I had. The whole family raved and raved while we ate it. Don't change a thing! I am going to do the exact same recipe this weekend but use chicken instead. I think it will be just as yummy!

Spectacular!  I've tried several Orange Beef type recipes,and they've always been too "orangy" to enjoy.  This is perfect!  Next time, I'm going to double the ingredients for the sauce so that my rice tastes like it too!  Followed the recipe almost exact, only substituting orange juice for the concentrate, because I didn't have any.  Give it a try!

This is really fantastic. We tripled the recipe so we could have leftovers. I wouldnt change a darn thing about this one except I used fresh squeezed oj instead of the concentrate. Perfect balance of flavors and truly restaurant quality.

This is so good! I have made it like the recipe and it is great but I like it a little better with the follow adjustments for our family. I let the meat sit in the cornstarch for about 10 minutes, shake off excess and then fry (used peanut oil). I also cut the sugar down by half and doubled the sauce. SOOO good. Thank you!

We made this for dinner last night and it was excellent.  It's a little more labor-intensive that what we usually cook, but well worth the effort.  We'd give 10 stars of we could!  Don't change a thing!

Great recipe. Didn't change anything other than substituting red wine vinegar for rice wine, which I didn't have and wasn't sure where to get. I like it the way it is, but I'm sure doubling the sauce would be tasty. Adding red pepper for the sweet/spicy combo would also be delicious.

This was sooo delish!  Added water chestnuts and broccoli at the end, and served over white rice with orange slices as a garnish.  A hit with the whole family!  I would also not hesitate to serve it to company.

This was so incredibly good. The first thing my husband said was "wow baby" It was a little time consuming for my busy life so I will do this again asa treat for him or for when I have company. My husband said he liked it better than PF Changs mongolian beef which is his favorite. Loved it and directions are easy to follow.

this was soooo good... i made it as is except i used minced jar ginger instead of fresh shredded and only used 1tbsp of that as opposed to the 3 of the shredded and fried it in about half a cup of oil in my frying pan...  came out perfect.  i couldnt stop eating it but i had to save room for cake.  definitely a keeper.

Fabulous!  I tried not to change too much :) Used ground ginger and garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  Didn't add the beef to the sauce, another reviewer mentioned it made the beef soggy. Made more sauce to pour over the beef and rice.  This is a keeper, will worth the effort.  Thanks for a delightful recipe.

I made this exactly as written and thought it was excellent. The whole family loved the flavor and I thought it was the perfect amount of sauce.  The beef was as crispy as I would expect for just being coated in cornstarch. It was better then I have had at Chinese restaurants.

YUMMY! This was great. My husband usually doesn't like asian type foods, but he really liked this one. It is a winner! The smell when it is cooking is enough to make you anxious for it to finish. I would make again!

Very nice recipe. Doubled the sauce, but didn't use quite double the vinegar.  Didn't have rice vinegar- used apple cider vinegar.  Shook out the excess cornstarch before frying.  At the end I mixed a bit of cornstarch with OJ to thicken up the sauce since mine didn't- possibly since I sort of doubled it.  Also added a few red pepper flakes.  I ate way too much!

A great recipe I gave it four stars because without the orange sauce the beef was very bland since it was not marinated (like one would do when making orange chicken). Next time I will try to marinate and then dry it out to see if there is a difference.

We had this for dinner last night, and later I heard my son tell his girlfriend "it was awesome"!  I rated it a 4, as I did make a couple small changes- my body and fried food do not get along, so I did this as a stir fry, after coating the beef strips with the corn starch and letting them sit for about 10 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer.  Also added 1/2 t. red pepper flakes and 1/2 t. Sriracha sauce to the sauce to give it a little "kick" as my family likes things spicy. (I may have added a tad more ginger than called for, just because that's how much I got from the segment of ginger root I chopped, but I love ginger and I wasn't about to throw it away!) Thanks for another great recipe - it will be part of the rotation.

Pretty good.. kicked it up w/ some red pepper (1/2t) flake and some chili paste (2t).  Very nice... need to dice the orange zest finer next time.. as zest is to stringy.

The sauce for this recipe is so yummy.  I doubled it although it wasn't necessary.  I'm glad I did because it was so good on rice.  I did however, only use 1 Tbsp of grated ginger.  I only used 1/4 oil to fry in which was plenty.  For some reason when you dry the beef in the fridge, it makes it crispier - YUM!  I'm going to try this with chicken next.

Delicious!!  The second time I made this I increased the sauce by half so there would be enough to cover the rice.  I also made this using chicken instead of beef and it was just as delicious!!

Superb. My husband said it was better than any 'chinese' food he had ever had! My only variations were that I used a venison rump roas b/c that is all I had and I pan-fried it instead deep-frying it. Came out so wonderful! I also made the sauce go a little further by mixing a couple tablespoons of cornstarch with about 3/4 cup of orange juice and adding it to the 'vinegar and soy sauce' mixture while you are boiling it. Put this recipe on your rotation!

This was delicious! Frying the beef was a little messy, but it turned out crispy and was sweet and sticky when covered in the sauce.  I did find the orange flavour quite strong. Next time I will cut back a bit on the orange and add a little chili oil to give it a sweet/spicy kick. But overall, a definite keeper!

We loved this recipe.  The only change I made to the recipe was to steam broccoli, cauliflower, & carrots instead of just the broccoli.  Delicious orange (but not overpowering) flavor.  One note -- any leftovers won't be crispy but they still taste good.

This is so good, my whole family loved it.  I made double the sauce as some other reviewer said and it was a very good suggestion.

I LOVED this recipe!  I would like to have more of an orangy flavor though.  Like the ornage chicken at Panda...any ideas? ;0)  I just found out I am gluten intolerant and I am CRAVING Panda Express!!

I used olive oil and toasted sesame oil. I also used 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds.   If you have a dehydrator in your oven you only need about 15 minutes at 160 degrees.

I was kind of disappointed with this one - I expected WAY more out of it after reading the reviews!  The sauce wasn't all that flavorful - the beef was tough (it had to cook for longer than I normally would cook it for it to get crispy).  It wasn't bad at all it - it was good. Just not what I was expecting - if I make this again, I'll be tweaking it quite a bit.

I made this "as is" but found it to be too sweet. The overall flavor was pretty good..I would just like it  to be a little spicy. My kids loved it and want me to make it again! Next time I will add some red pepper flakes to give some sizzle.

I just made this dish tonight and I had to add my review! I did almost 95% of the recipe to a 't' except I didn't add rice wine vinegar (personal taste) and the orange zest and I did what most of the other reviewers did and I doubled the sauce,I wasn't going to but I did at the last minute and I'm glad I did! I also used frozen veggies and everything was so good! I used japenese bean sprouts instead of rice and I don't recommend that again!

I like the effect of the orange zest and the OJ conc. on the flavor.  I didn't have either so I went with lemon juice and lemon zest.  It was surprisingly subtle in the end.  Otherwise, I followed this recipe to the 'T'.  I didn't think the beef needed to be deep fried in oil, so I just seasoned my wok and cooked the beef, drained it, and set aside.  I had to constantly stir and add a little bit of water, of course to keep the beef from sticking. I made up for the cornstarch later by adding a few tsp to as little water would dilute it and tossing it in after the meat has soaked in the cooking sauce for a little bit (maybe 4 or 5 minutes).  It still thickens and coats nicely.  One thing I would also do differently is to steam the vegetables first if they're frozen to cut down on water added from vegetables (it really messes up the syrupy nature of the finished product).

I don't plan on making it again so that's why I rate it 3 stars.  It was too sweet and was too orange tasting.  Alot of work for an "okay" tasting dinner.

This recipe was delicious!  I substituted splenda for sugar and OJ for the concentrate.  Instead of just broccoli, I steamed a variety of vegetables, mixed them w/the beef/sauce mixture and served it over brown basmati rice.  I doubled the amount of sauce as well. My husband and his friend told me to save this one!

i have tried turkey and veal and they are both great with this dish and work well with the corn starch technique. the first time i made this dish i only had dried ginger. its much better with fresh but dried will do if you dont have fresh on hand. i also didnt have oj concentrate and just used a bit extra fresh oj from the orange i zested. this is a very easy dish but takes a bit of time.

The entire family enjoyed this from 2yrs old and up.  The frying was a little painful (to my kitchen and my arm), but the sauce was great.  I did double the sauce and cut the sugar in half.  After simmering the sauce (right before adding the meat back in) I noticed it could be a little thicker so I kept adding cornstarch until I got the right consistency.  I served orange slices for desert.  The entire meal was excellent!

I, too, reduced the sugar by half. I used 3TB fresh squeezed orange juice instead of concentrate, everything else I followed to the 'T'. I even used the zest. Everyone on my house LOVED this recipe- including my 8 and 6 year olds! We found this recipe perfect- not too sweet or too orangey as others have stated. The strips cooked up perfectly crispy as well. I didn't deep fry them as much as I just fried them. Using the flour/egg/flour combo as some others have stated is not authentic so I didn't do that. I dried the beef (w/o using paper towels) for 5 hours in the fridge. I put them in a ziploc bag with the cornstarch to insure even coverage. With about 1/4c very hot oil, I fried (not wokked) them about 30 seconds each side. I also think part of the trick is to get the meat sliced almost paper thin. I sliced mine from partially frozen sirloin. We loved this stuff and I'll be utilizing it for orange chicken, and when we don't have our kids with us, I'll be spicing it up to make it hot. Thanks for this great recipe!

Even after a few days in the fridge this recipe still tasted incredible. I substituted the orange concentrate for 1/3 cup of pulp oj which I had on hand. When breading the meat I dipped the strips in egg first, it used 2 eggs to coat them all. They turned out wonderfully crunchy. Also, must warn they cook very quickly when in the pan. I did skip the orange zest and thought it tasted fine without it. Also, I added sesame seed as recommended by another person. When I tossed the meat into the sauce I forgot to turn off the heat and it really made the meat soak up all the sauce which I really liked. Once it did that I decided to make a second batch of sauce and it was perfect. A lot of effort but well worth it.

Sooo good!  This is better than takeout, I think, because you can control the quality of the ingredients.  I followed the direction almost exactly (I just used ginger powder instead of fresh since it's all I had and I used splenda instead of the extra sugar).  I only quickly stir fried the meat to avoid some of the extra fat, and it was still great.  Next time I think I'll add a little hot chili sauce for a little extra zing, but it's definitely a keeper!

This was very good!  I liked the texture of the beef.  What I actually did was slice up a roast and froze half the meet for next time.  I did find the whole process time consuming, and I want to figure out some shortcuts (hopefully having the meet precut will help).  The reason for the 4 stars is that it is WAY too sweet.  Less sugar next time.

Great flavor! Something that would go well as a marinade too.  Next time I'll tenderize the meat first so it tears a little easier.

This was good, but not great.  It was a little on the sour side.  Mine got so thick there was hardly enough sauce for the beef, let alone the rice.  I did add plenty of red pepper to give it some kick.
Probably will not make again.  Thanks anyway though.

This was a very good recipe. I did half the sugar, and used the juice from the orange I was zesting (about 1/3 cup) instead of the forzen stuff.  

My exact words were, "Holy cow! I made stir-fry that actually tastes like stir-fry!"  Usually, my stir-frys taste like americanized mix of meats, veggies, and asian spices/condiments.  This one really worked.

great flavors, very sweet...but of course, that's the dish. I agree with lessening the sugar, but then it's a battle because you don't get that thick syrup that you need. DEFINITELY CUT UP SOME HOT PEPPERS to add to the vinegar/sugar/soy mixture...gives it a nice spice, but not overwhelming. I sliced up fresh Thai Jalapenos, worked great.

I think this recipe has potential, but it needs a LOT of tinkering. The sugar has  to come way down--I found it tooth-achingly sweet. And some hot pepper flakes or other heat source is badly needed to enhance the flavor. I agree that the amount of sauce needs to be doubled, especially if you want some to put on the rice. I used fresh ginger, and didn't think it wasn't excessive at all, but maybe that was because the sugar overwhelmed all the other flavors. As for those who compared this to an authentic Chinese restaurant dish--you need to find better Chinese restaurants!

Wonderful dish! I followed the recipe with just a few changes. First, the beef was left to dry in the refrigerator for 24 hours just because I wound up not being able to cook it on the same night. Second, I cut the amount of vegetable oil down to 1/2 cup. This seemed to work fine for us. I think using 2 cups would be too greasy. The beef wasn't crispy throughout, but was crispy in areas. The sauce is fabulous! Usually DH likes to have a lot of sauce, but since the sauce covers the beef, extra isn't really needed. I also substituted the broccoli for yellow and orange peppers strips and the whole dish was a winner. Thanks for the keeper recipe!

definately leave out the sugar. the orange concentrate makes it sweet enough. I added red peppers and used chicken instead. my husband loved it and ate all the left overs. great w/ sticky rice. i would use more rice vinegar or less cornstarch on the meat so that the sauce is not so thick.

This recipe is very yummy! The only things I did differently the 2nd time I made it were 1.Double the sauce so that we can dip crab rangoon in it 2.Add some sugar snap peas. Great recipe, thanks!

I think it may be my (and my husbands) tastebuds that are off.  I just wanted to warn people that this is VERY sweet!!  It wasn't to our liking at all.  Also, I had a hard time getting the corn starch to stick to the meat.  I had a pile of crud in the bottom of my wok when I finished.  If we liked our meat sweet, this may have been ok, but just not our taste at all!

It's great. I add more of the orange juice concentrate, and a tad more vinegar. I make this with noodles and toss them in the sauce. YUMS.

Excellent.  It tastes just like it came from a restaurant.  If you don't like to have bits of fresh ginger in the dish use ground ginger it is flavorful but less spicy

Tried this with chicken instead of beef and it was great.  I think when I make it again I will cut the sugar as it was a little sweet.  Also it definitely needs some red pepper for the proper spice taste as some have mentioned.

This is the best orange sauce beef so far.. Kids loved it too. I cut down on the ginger as others recomended (must use fresh), added more garlic and 3x the sauce. Frying the beef took quite a bit of time. I need to slice it thinner next time. As my family said "this is a make again" Thanks for sharing.

Oh it was great!!
Made minor changes to the methods, I just coated teh beef strips in cornstarch then quickly stir fried them in sesame  oil. Added shrimp and blanched thinly sliced carrots and yellow pepper strips ( I use lots of veggies for my meals) with the brocolli.It was enjoyed by all, will make it for company.

This was pretty good. My husbabnd really enjoyed it. I did not deep fry the beef, just pan fried it in less oil.Quite a bit of the cornstarch came off during cooking and fell to the bottom of the pan, but it still tasted pretty yummy anyway. I used fresh o.j. instead if frozen, but i think next time i will used the frozen for a more concentrated orange flavour.

Fabulous!  And really easy to make.  Next time, I will cut back a little on the garlic, just a person preference.  Also, I cut the salt amount in 1/2.  I didn't have any fresh broccoli and was going to add a little frozen but it looked horrible and I left it out.  Definitely use fresh.  Also, I wouldn't bother with the long grain rice, just use the minute rice.  I find the long grain is kind of hit or miss and again it was a miss (coming out all gummy) so I hurried  up and made up some minute rice.  Next time I may add a few peanuts or cashews - I think that is how our local Chinese restaurant makes this dish.  Also, I found the orange juice/soy sauce mixture only needed 2 or 3 mins. in the pan and it was very thick.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this dish!  Thanks, BEC

Even though I overcooked the beef, I'm still giving this dish four stars because the flavour of it was excellent.  I also really like the idea that this recipe is for the entire meal.  We will make again for sure...maybe with chicken next time.  DH enjoyed this dish very much as well, but thinks that the meat doesn't *have* to be deep fried and would be just as good sautéed.

My husband and I thought this was absolutely fantastic!

I guess I might agree with the 'too much ginger' comments, since I only had about half as much as I was supposed to and thought it was perfect.  I can see where more than that might be overkill.  

This is defintely a keeper, and has already been shared by me!  Thanks!

The only thing I changed was to use quite a bit more broccoli to make a one-bowl meal. Served over sticky rice. Super yummy! Prepping the meat is a bit time-consuming (& messy, for me.)

This was awesomely delicious.  I had the butcher slice the sirloin very thin for me. My whole family really enjoyed it.  The only down side is frying the meat. I don't have a wok so used a large skillet. Definitely use fresh orange zest and ginger.

This really was just ok.  My beef never got crispy and the cornstarch all came off in the oil, so I had to discard all of it and start new.  I used regular oj and that part was fine, although I would use some red pepper to spice it up if I were to make it again (I didn't because I was serving to my kids and I didn't want it to be spicy.) but I won't be making this again.  Too much work for not enough taste.

The beef was fabulous.  I used my deep fryer and it turned out great.  The orange sauce was toooo strong a flavor for me, and I love orange.  So, I'll have to find a way to tone it down.

Definitely a tasty dish but soooo much work. i just feel too guilty using so much oil too. I would make it again for myself because I love orange flavor but my family didn't rave and for the amount of cleanup afterward I probably will look for another recipe.

I LOVED this recipe! My family did too! I didn't have OJ Concentrate, but I used fresh OJ and it tasted Just as good! I also added a few red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch. I also added Steamed Broccoli heads!
Very Tasty! Tastes (and Smells) like its from a Chinese Food Restaurant!
I'll definitely make again!

WAY GOOD.  I did not "deep fry" my meat, but only lightly sauteed it, which turned out fine.  The sauce was really good.  It is a bit time consuming, but worth it.

Excellent!  A hit with everyone in the family.  To make slicing easier, freeze the beef until firm but not solid, then cut into strips.

This recipe is actually a good one for a husband and wife team to cook together. It had great flavor and is definately a "Keeper". We did double the sauce and that made it the perfect amount to drizzle over rice. We also added a 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the sauce and made it a little zingier. Great recipe! Can't wait to try it with chicken and shrimp!

Fantasic! We moved to a very small midwestern town and had given up on getting our favorite asian dishes. When we got the craving, we decided to try out some homemade stuff. Stumbling across this recipe, it was an easy choice to try it. This was easy and fun and tasted better than any delivery we ever had in SF or Chicago!

This was an excellent recipe reminding me of a Crispy Shredded Orange Beef dish at my favourite Chinese restaurant.  I did add a dash of Hot Red Pepper Flakes to spice it up a bit.

Made this last night and my family loved it!  I reduced the ginger to 2 TBSP as well.  I also reduced the amount of oil used to fry the beef, to 1 Cup instead of 2 Cups. I will use a thinner cut of beef next time I make this dish, as I know the thinner the slice, the more tender the beef is.  This is definitely a KEEPER!  Thanks for sharing!

The first time I made it just as the recipe as is.  Very good.  When I made it a second time, I added more OJ and some hot pepper flakes.   It was even better.  This is a keeper.

Followed the recipe, except eye-balled the amount of ginger (maybe 1 T) and garlic (maybe 3/4 T).   Also, doubled the sauce.
Do not overcook the meat .... it only takes 2-3 minutes.  AMAZING FLAVORS .....

Definitely double the sauce, it took longer than the directions said it would take with all the chopping and mincing but it was excellent and I'll make it again for sure.

We enjoyed this meal and will eat it again.  The first few bites are kind of plain and tasteless but the more you eat, the more flavorful it becomes.  Once you're done eating, you've gotten full flavor and wish you'd started out that way... that's why I gave it 4 stars.  Not sure how to get the flavor from the start but despite, it's good.

I was a little hesitant about frying the beef and because of that I didn't leave it in long enough, I wish the recipe had been more clear. It tasted great but lacked the crispiness. I made more sauce to toss my broccoli and snap peas in and that made the meal a little more well balanced.

Turned out delicious. Husband loves it. The butcher smartly suggested I use carne asada meat, which made prep a lot easier, so I’d recommend that so it’s already thinly sliced for ya. I’m one proud little lady and super stoked that I know what’s in it, so no worries over msg. Delicious!!

One of my adult kids requested orange beef when she came to visit. Found this recipe and made it. I did not use orange juice concentrate, but the juice from the orange I zested. This is now a new family favorite. I tripled the batch when we had guest over and they ate every bit of it along with the 2 sides I had prepared.

I used orange marmalade and orange juice in lieu of concentrate.  Used 1 tbsp ginger for a double recipe of sauce.  Turned out fantastic.  Also added red pepper flakes as recommended by others.

I doubled the sauce and it could have used a little more.  For my family it wasn't sweet enough, but a bit to sour from the rice vinegar. I also used pre -cut strips from the market and they overcooked a little. Next time I will cut bigger pieces so they get crispy before drying out. Overall we did enjoy it and if I switch up a few things I believe I can improve the recipe  for our tastes.

Most of the coating ended up in the frying oil instead of on the meat.  My husband and daughter thought it was far too tangy.  I enjoyed the flavor, but would have liked it more if it had retained the cornstarch coating.

Delicious!
I grated a 1 in cube of frozen ginger and 4 frozen peeled tangerines that I had previously  frozen, but followed the rest of the ingredients of the recipe to the letter.

My family basically devoured it .

Thanks!

We love this, but it does take a while to cut the beef and then fry it in small batches.  (Probably 60-75 minutes, instead of 30 minutes).  

It is really good, but I always add some Mae Ploy Chili Sauce to my sauce for a bit of spice.

I never use cornstarch, I used orange juice instead of orange peel, and I added a dab of hoisin sauce. Used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Really tasty.

Loved this recipe! I had to get creative and make a couple tweaks though. Didn't have orange juice of any kind and couldn't make it to the store so I used some lychee juice I had hanging around and made a concentrate to replace the orange concentrate. Also added some red pepper strips, onions and a few green finger pepper strips as well. 
I used some tri tip steaks I had out which are relatively dry to begin with, so I got away with skipping the drying process outlined in step 1.
This turned out absolutely amazing, so I can only imagine what it'd be like with the OJ - I'll have to take a crack at it again after I get some.
Using the lychee juice produces an outcome similar to a local Chinese takeout's version of sesame beef.
Served with quick fried noodles (not for any particular reason other than they were in the fridge and had to be used). Next time when I have the OJ it'll be with rice.

Good but I was looking more for a greater sense of the orange taste. Think I'll double the portions for the orange zest etc next time.

The taste to this was absolutely amazing. It didn't really crisp up the way I would have liked for it to, but that was probably my own errors (I'm still learning things in the kitchen).....the taste was their though and my family really enjoyed this recipe.

This was a good dish, yes, but to someone not comfortable using large amounts of oil to fry anything, it can get nerve wrecking; especially if you aren't familiar with the proper disposal of that oil.  
I also had to restart the orange zest, fresh ginger, and garlic part over again as I didn't know the proper amount one tablespoon of oil was after getting done with frying the beef.
I accidentally burnt the mixture and had to start over because of that.
It was also unexpectedly sticky, maybe I didn't make that part of it right, but in the end, this was a one time only dish for me.

OMG this was delicious! It really does come out crispy if you let it dry in the fridge a bit. I can't believe I forgot to add the rice wine vinegar though!!! Even without it the recipe gets 5 stars from me. It had a great flavor and the orange zest really pops in this dish. I'll be making again and again.

Used fresh squeezed orange juice, 1Tbs  of orange beef sauce and 1-2 Tbs orange marmalade instead of concentrate.  Otherwise made recipe as is.  Instead of drying beef out I coated it with flour before frying.  Delicious!!

Tried this recipe and it was delicious!  Reading the other reviews I did double the sauce  and added chili peppers  because we like spicy food.  Served it with orange rice Yummy! 
 Will definitely make again.

Doubled the sauce ingredients and added a bag of frozen Asian vegetables instead of broccoli when meat was added to the sauce mixture. Had to add bit extra cornstarch to sauce to thicken. This dish was very good.

Didn't care for this. To much vinegar to to little orange flavour. I tried the sauce before using it, thank God, so I was able to fix it. I have another Orange Chicken recipe I've used for years, its similar to this, but the ratios of ingredients is much better. I'll just stick with that.

Great recipe, tastes almost as good as my favourite fusion Asian restaurant. I didn't change anything except used orange juice instead of frozen concentrate because it was I had at hand. Served with sticky rice and mango and cucumber salad. Delish. Thank you for sharing.

I cut the beef strips, while the meat was just semi-defrosted--easier to cut thin that way.  I substituted 1/4 cup orange juice (without reducing) for the concentrate I didn't have...After 1/2 hr refrigerating beef slices, spread out in single layer on paper towels in the refrigerator, I coated with corn starch--found I needed more than 1/4 cup cornstarch to coat 1 1/2 lbs of meat, but added more as necessary.  Meat came out crispy, but tender inside and the sauce was divine!  Loved this recipe.  Will make it again and again!

Very citrusy and delicious! I added flour to the cornstarch, let the meat sit for 10 minutes after the strips were coated, next time I will cut thinner strips, and do half cornstarch half flour. The sauce was doubled recipe and I had to use a teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. I like my rice pizzazzed up so I add diced bell pepper and onion , butter.m& salt to the rice pan and sautéed the veggies before adding rice and water. Definitely will be doing this one again!

Super yummy!  My family loved it and I would definitely make again.  I doubled the recipe and cooked the meat in coconut oil, which was still good.  Maybe left too much oil behind when I added the soya sauce, so slight modification on my end to skim more oil out.

This was really good.  Teenage son had two helpings.  I'm glad I doubled the sauce, it was needed.  The only thing I did differently was to steam my broccoli in the microwave and add it in after the meat to coat it with the sauce.   This will be a part of my Asian food rotation!  The technique of drying the beef before the cornstarch was a good method.  The Chinese restaurant I worked in during HS used to do this before frying.   Thanks for sharing.

It was okay. There was a bit too much orange in there, so if I made it again, I'd probably cut down how much of the concentrated orange juice we used.

I made it as written. My wife is a semi- vegetarian but loved this. She is also not a leftovers eater, but had this for lunch the next day.

Good taste with a nice, thick sauce.  Change ginger from Tablespoons to Teaspoons, a bit less sugar, and perhaps add a little "heat".

SOOOO YUMMY!!! I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I double the sauce as many raters recommended..i"m so glad I did), the sauce was amazing!! I found that allowing the beef to dry in the fridge as directed and then coating with  the cornstarch and putting back into the fridge for another 20 min or so really help with getting that crispy/crunchy texture that I was hoping for. I did allow the beef to come to room temp before frying. This will definitely be a go to recipe for company, a bit of work be WELL worth every minute. BETTER than any I've EVER had at a restaurant..My husband the food critic even commented "make sure you keep this recipe"!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

This was delicious! I prepared it ahead of time so when ready all I had to do was cook meat and then mix it all together. Had to be careful with hot oil splatter. Could taste the orange, beef was crispyish, very yummy.

Followed directions and it was a bit too sweet and salty for my taste. I got the hang of how long to keep the beef in the oil by the 3rd batch. Don't be afraid to go crispy! I made by last batch of beef extra crispy - since it was incorporated with the rest of the beef in the sauce - so everyone got some extra crispy beef.

The beef was great!  BUT, this I way too much ginger and perhaps too much orange zest.  Couldn't finish it.  Will try again but with half the amount of ginger.

This was absolutely delicious!  I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ginger powder.  It worked.  And I didn't have a wok, either.  I just used my high-sided frying pan, and that seemed to work okay.  The beef does stay crispy, and that adds to the dish a lot.  Loved it.  Will be making this again.

It was very good but slightly difficult for me to fry the beef chunks to make crunchy.   Pieces stuck to bottom of pan and I had to finish in another.   But again, it was very good!  I added a small pinch of red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.  My husband loved it.  We enjoy trying new recipes.  Will try again.  Thank you.  Teresa

I made the sauce exactly as written except for substituting cider vinegar for the rice vinegar and I thought it was delicious.  It was a bit time consuming, however, to grate the fresh ginger and orange zest, but the flavor was excellent.  

I also used the sauce on boneless chicken thighs and it was very good.  I browned the chicken on the stove and finished it in the oven.  After browning the chicken, I poured the sauce in the frying pan with 1 TBS of the drippings and thickened it a bit.  When the chicken was finished, I tossed it back in the frying pan with the sauce to coat the chicken and used some of the left over sauce on the rice.  I thought it was better than the top sirloin.  

Note:  You may strain the sauce to make a nice smooth consistency without the bits of ginger, garlic, orange zest.

Its a good start, but needs some work.  I'm completely trashed the 1/3 cup sugar, completely unnecessary.  Used fresh orange juice instead of concentrated.   Also, where is the heat?   Traditional orange beef has heat, so I added asian hot chili paste.  The recipe, as it stands is a 3 star, but could be better with some tweaks.  I just needed a starting point.

I did make one major change.  I didn't use any water.  I didn't have concentrated OJ in the house so I put two thirds cup of fresh-squeezed OJ in, instead.  I also added a shake of crushed red pepper and about a teaspoon of sesame oil.

Made as-stated and everyone (table of 7) really enjoyed it. We'll double the sauce the next time to have a little extra to pour over the rice.  Definitely adding to our list to make again.

Soooo good!!!  I made a few substitutions to adapt this recipe for a primal / paleo diet.  I substituted 2T raw honey for the 1/3 cup white sugar; 1/3 cup orange juice for the 2T frozen OJ concentrate; 1T coconut aminos for 1T soy sauce; 1/4 cup arrowroot powder for 1/4 cup cornstarch; and 1 cup ghee for 2 cups oil.  I used one bag of frozen broccoli, cooked per the package instructions instead of steamed fresh.  Other than the substitutions, I followed the recipe instructions.  Result was delicious!  Very flavorful!  Better than takeout from our local Chinese restaurant!  Quite high in carbs, especially if served with rice, but worth every single one!  (1/4 recipe has 27g total carbs if made with my substitutions, not including the rice and broccoli.) Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This came great! I added orange marmalade, chili paste and green onions. I would double the sauce ingredients if you like alot of sauce and would omit salt not double the sugar. I used peanut oil to fry in and sesame in sauce. Also used half cornstarch and 1/2 flour to coat beef.  We highly enjoyed this dish!

AMAZING recipe. I cut the ginger by about 1/2 (because I was getting frustrated at grating the ginger), and even with that it seemed a little ginger-y. Other than that, I doubled the sauce which was a good idea because it reduced down quite a bit during the boil, but as far as ingredient ratio go, I followed this exactly as is and I am 100% going to make this again. Delicious!

The family loved it.  I would recommend maybe increasing the amount of sauce 'cause it's so delicious soaking in to the rice.

This is very flavorful! Not quite enough sauce to go around evenly, so I made a second batch with less garlic, ginger, and zest (as to not be over powering). I'll be making this again. The only problem is this dish is really acidic, and gives me a bit of heartburn, which is not usually something that effects me.

Made this for a weekend dinner for the family.  Used some local honey instead of sugar and added some red pepper flakes for extra spice (my family likes the heat!).  Came out really well and everyone really like it.  Meat was tender and crispy and the sauce was really delicious.  Not too orangey,  just a really great sauce.

Not a bad recipe. Knock off the zest and add a bit more of the OJ concentrate. The cornstarch for some weird reason just...washed off the meat as soon as I stuck it into the oil to fry so it didn't obtain the crispy like I hoped. Will see if I did something wrong next time I make it.

DELISH!! The only changes I made were, doubled the sauce but left sugar single and added 1 tbsp of chili paste. 

I'm not sure I wil make it again tho, because OMG ! My kitchen is a mess! 
Thank you very a yummy dinner.

I tried orange beef at a higher quality chinese restaurant for the first time a week ago, and I loved it so much that I said "I need to make this!!!".    This recipe did not disappoint!!  Changes were made as follows:  used apple cider vinegar rather than rice vinegar, squeezed the juice of a clementine orange after zesting it rather than using concentrate, and used a mix of white and brown sugars.   At first, it seemed like it was going to be too sour/tart (presumably bc I used a different vinegar?  Not sure...I've never tasted rice vinegar before so not sure how it compares to apple cider vinegar), so that's when I added the spoonful of brown sugar.

Once everything thickened up in the pan, and I added the beef, it was SOOOOO GOOD!

I also made sure (as per other reviewers' advice) that the beef was sliced thin and patted dry before tossing in the corn starch.  It came out crispy, and not mushy at all.

Followed this to a T. I typically don't attempt "complicated" Asian favorites at home...I am SO glad to have found this recipe. Not complicated, followed each step as per recipe, forgot the broccoli...but still got raves!! Everyone even picky kidlets ate this happily. It's now a permanent menu fixture.

Love this!! I keep making it, and there are never leftovers because everyone loves it. Since the first time I made this the only adjustment I have made to the recipe is to use the juice from the orange I zest instead of concentrate, I just let it boil longer. I find with the fresh orange it makes for a fresher taste.

Wonderful dish we will definately make this again. We used some other comments advice and doubled the sauce. Next time I will reduce the sugar by half it was a little to sweet. I added a teaspoon of hot sesame oil to the sauce as well.

The flavor of the sauce was exceptional.  The only reason I rated it down is that I would have included in the recipe something to make it spicy as well as more sauce to cover the broccoli.  Other than that it was great!

I have made this twice.  I do not think the sauce needs to be doubled.  I think it is slightly on the salty side.  It really increases the scale the next day.  One time  I made this with Chicken and once with beef.  Both times the meat was very very dry.  I am completely over fried it.  But it takes forever to turn brown.  I wish this recipe would suggest frying times.  It takes forever to turn brown and I dry out the meat.

This turned out great, what a taste. I had a big crowd so I doubled up on the quantities. Other than changing 1/3 of the soya sauce amount to Worcestershire sauce the receipt was right on. I served it over egg noodles instead of rice and added some steamed vegies........it was a big hit. Thanks.

I am not a great cook, hardly a fair cook in my opinion, but I love the Orange Beef served at a local Chinese Restaurant, and I had to try this recipe. The processing of the beef is great and gave a nice crispy texture.  I do not know if the volume of beef is too much or the other ingredients is too little but this recipe did not make near enough sauce in my opinion. The ginger also overpowered everything, to the point that you could hardly taste the orange. If use this recipe again, I will use have the amount of beef and probably  half the ginger,  and double the Concentrated Orange juice.

Added onions in the last pan drippings with the orange zest and ginger..cooked till the onions were semi clear. Also added orange marmalade to the liquid contents..about 2Tbs( total for doubled recipe). Doubled the recipe but not the sugar and used 2/3 cups orange juice( total for doubled recipe) instead of concentrated orange juice. I had the butcher cup my top round in to 1/4 inch strips. Very good!

Sauce was delicious. Definitely double the recipe. I used 1 T of orange extract instead of the orange concentrate and skipped the orange zest and it was still amazing.

This was excellent! I added some extra soy sauce but that's the only change I made. I served mine over cauliflower rice and regular white rice for my family. A nice Asian salad rounded out the meal. We will for sure be making this again!

Used 1/3 Cup orange juice and added red chili flakes. Very much like Chinese buffet. Double sauce next time.

Made exactly as directed although cut the recipe in 1/2 as we were only 2 people...Absolutely delicious and much crispier than Chinese beef With broccoli you usually get with take out Chinese  food in New Haven. Used jasmine rice, but plain rice would be perfectly ok too.

This was excellent as written!  Only change I made was doubling the sauce and letting the beef rest for 10 minutes in the cornstarch. Next time I'll cut the sugar in half too.   Beef was crispy and delicious.  Oh and my husband and I added chili pepper sauce to ours. I like it hot!

I made the recipe with Trader Joes beefless strips because I am vegetarian. I don't think it adds up to 1.5 lbs so I had plenty of sauce. I would reduce the sugar by maybe 25% next time. I also used oj from an actual orange instead of the frozen oj and put in about a 1/2 tbs more of garlic and i didn't have a lot of ginger so maybe I only put in 1.5 tbs of ginger.

Very delicious, and pretty forgiving, ingredients-wise. My husband didn't think the beef needed the cornstarch. I'm wont to agree with him. Next time we'll just brown it in the pan, sans cornstarch. The sauce was great, but I wasn't able to use every ingredient exactly. We didn't have any rice vinegar so I just used white vinegar, which I didn't realize would be much stronger. So it gave the dish a stronger flavor. Not necessarily a bad thing, but next time I'd like to try it with rice vinegar (after I get to the store). I also had to use powdered ginger, so I cut the amount down to about 1 tsp or so. I didn't bother sautéing anything other than the meat; I just dumped all the sauce ingredients in, together. After letting it boil for a while, I added a little cornstarch/water slurry to help speed up the thickening (my kids and I were hungry). If it were just me, I might add some red pepper flake, too, like they sometimes do in the Chinese restaurants. I'd like to try the sauce over chicken. My husband was very impressed with how it turned out, which is really saying something, because he's my toughest critic when it comes to food.

Too much ginger or citrus.  The oil also needs to stay very hot throughout or the breading looks soggy.  Maybe I should try it again, but it seemed like a lot of work for not a lot of flavor payoff.

Made this the other nite and really liked it. The only thing we thought was a bit overpowering, was the orange zest. As another viewer stated, we did add red pepper flakes and only had oj, not frozen concentrate.  We like it spicy! It's a keeper :-)

The sauce is delicious.  Tastes like a restaurant meal.  I just added about 1/3 of the ginger called for.  That was enough ginger for my taste.

My family loved this recipe. I just used less oil. I also think that it takes more than 35 minutes to make it from start to finish. But all things considered, it is worth it!  Nice balance of flavors. A keeper!

This was FABULOUS! I followed other suggestions and doubled the sauce and used fresh orange juice ( Simply Orange). I bought a steak and sliced it into 1/4-1/8" strips. Definitely fry in small batches as it gives you more control over the cooking. It takes longer but it sure was worth it. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will definitely be making again.

This sauce was amazing.  Really and truly AMAZING.  Even my husband who hates this type of food was going back for seconds and thirds.  True story!  I think next time I will try this with chicken (personal opinion that it will taste better with chicken or shrimp than beef.)  But I won't change anything except the protein.  It was too good to even consider messing with.  And I am one of those people who "adjusts" the recipe all the time.

This recipe was so good, I followed the recipe but I didn't add garlic, or the vinegar bc I didn't have none and it still came out awesome, I also didn't have concentrated OJ so I used 1/3 of cup of regular orange juice +2 tbs. For the meat I used Milanesa which is thin sliced meat. I used flour and egg mixture so flour would stick to the meat. It was so good.

This recipe ROCKS! My wife was very skeptical about beef and orange in the same dish but this meal made her a believer.  We loved the crispiness of the fried cornstarch on the lean sirloin beef...a heavier breading would be not as crisp.  The sauce is amazing  and is delightfully sweet and sticky without being over done.  Definitely reminds me of orange beef I had 20+ years ago that I just cannot seem to replicate.  Until now!

I was surprised at how quickly the beef cooked, each batch was done in about a minute. The longer you fry it, the crispier it gets.  The sauce was so yummy, I will definitely double it next time.  I added a 1/2 tsp of sesame oil to the sauce, and it added a nice smoky/nutty flavor as well.

Made this for the whole family, including 2 boys ages 6 and 5. They loved it! I made the sauce pretty much as stated with maybe a little more of the OJ concentrate because I knew they would love it. I didn't worry too much about frying it perfectly so I used less oil and just tossed the beef with flour before sauteeing it. Topped it all off with toasted sesame seeds and a whole bunch of broccoli....perfect!

Very good.  The texture was a bit off for me a little pasty I guess is a good word.  Not sure how to describe it.  Maybe I used too much cornstarch or didn't cook the beef long enough.  Will make again though because it was good and will experiment with above mentioned items and see if comes out more to my liking.  Still a great recipe!

Thank you BEC! I made your Crispy Orange Beef just as you instructed, and it was excellent! It took me 2 hours and the cooktop and floor were covered in grease, but it was worth it! I will make it for company, but I will do steps 1 and 2 the night before, clean up, and do steps 3 and 4 just before serving. Maybe I will save some of the oil from the beef frying in step 3, to use the next day to sautee the ginger, garlic and orange...that way I won't lose any of the flavor. It will be fast and clean. I plan to make a second batch of slightly thinner sauce the night before, too, to go over the rice and I will double the amount per person because it is hard to stop eating it! My husband and I ate 4 servings between us. I ate some of the left over crispy orange beef cold, straight from the fridge this morning, and it was still crispy! and even stickier. and soooo gooooooood. I will share this recipe with people I love. It is better than any Chinese food I have ever had at a restaurant, and so simple.

This was a very tastey dish. I did substitute the frozen juice concentrate with 1 fresh squeezed orange. Also added mushrooms and shave carrot in the dish. Will definatley make this again.

This is phenomenal.  I was able to get my beef crispy.  I do not think you can use stew meat if you want to achieve this.  I had a round steak that I sliced thin and did as the recipe instructed.  The beef was wonderfully crispy. I did not have frozen orange juice I just used regular orange juice.  I did double the sauce recipe so I could put some on the broccoli.  This was a hit and will become a regular meal at my house.  No more wasting money on take out for this!

Really delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, but thought the ginger overwhelmed the orange flavor. I'm wondering if it was supposed to be three teaspoons of ginger instead of three tablespoons.... Nevertheless it was really good and the best result I've ever had for making Chinese food at home.

This recipe is very very good! It's great to eat ginger beef without it being 90% breading. I have made it twice now and both times I skipped the orange zest and this last time I used white vinegar (diluted slightly) instead of rice vinegar. My family loved it and now my mother wants the recipe

Very good although to make it healthier, I only used a few tablespoons of oil in place of the 2 cups...ouch!  It wasn't as "crispy" but was still fabulous!

Delicious despite using flour instead of cornstarch because I had none to use. The recipe is a bit time consuming with having to thin slice the beef, lay out to dry out, and then deep fry; but worth the trouble!

This was delicious! I finally found a meal the whole house will eat.  I took the other readers tips and shook off the extra cornstarch but still found that it all ended up in the pan. So mine wasn't crispy but the flavor was fantastic

I love this recipe! I do tweak it just a little but the gist of the recipe stays the same. I half the sugar and vinegar (I just used regular vinegar) I also just used dried garlic and ginger and just eyeball the amount..probably 1/4t each. I also use 1/3 cup regular orange juice. A lot of reviews double the sauce but unless you like it super saucy its just fine the way it is for me. Of course I'm using 1/3 c. OJ instead of the frozen concentrate so that probably makes more. I serve with rice and broccoli. Yum!!

Made this tonight for dinner. All the family liked it other than it needed more sauce. Next time, I will double the sauce and add a bit more garlic. I also used 1/3 cup orange juice as I read in other reviews. Will definetly rotate in my menus.

Has the potential to be an awesome dish but WAY too sweet. I made the dish exactly how it is written. Made the dish and then served it all over rice. The rice at the bottom was inedible b/c the extra sauce fell down there and ti was crazy sweet. So use less sugar next time.

I'm sure this was user error, but my beef never got crispy. Just greasy and soggy, even though the oil was hot, and I'd shaken off the excess cornstarch. I let it continue cooking until browned. Even though I didn't achieve "crispy" I thought this was very good, and very close to what we would have at our local Asian restaurant. I would have been happy to make it again, but my family did not love the flavor. Tangy citrus may not appeal to everyone. Still, I thought the sauce and recipe were great. I paired with jasmine rice and the steamed broccoli.

Awesome!!  Followed the suggestions of some of the reviews, made double the sauce, and used fresh green beans instead of the broccoli (as I did not have any on hand).  Served with Jasmine Rice.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing, BEC.

Very good recipe!  I thought flavors blended well together in just the right amounts and the prep time was actually pretty close for me!  I usually take much longer than indicated.  Next time I will cut meat down to 1 lb and add a little more broccoli to balance out the ratio of meat to rice to broccoli.

This was excellent. I made it exactly as directed except I used half of the fresh ginger and added some ground ginger - b/c I was too lazy to grate more :)  I may cut back on the sugar a bit next time and I will add some spice for the adults, but keep the kids exactly the same.  Great recipe!

I made this exactly as written and it was excellent.  My husband loved it as well.  The sauce and the beef were both great, although I think I would add a tad more ginger and a little bit of sesame oil as well.  

 I did change the accompanying vegetables as I'm the only one that likes broccoli.  I stir-fried some carrots, onions, and sugar snap peas in the remaining oil just before I added the garlic, ginger, and orange zest to the pan.    

Amazingly good!

This sounded so fantastic based on the reviews, but I'm afraid my family thought it was too sweet, too orange and too vinegary.  I liked the preparation though and the sauce had a nice color and consistancy.  I added chicken broth and cornstarch and that toned it down a bit, but it was still too strong.

I agree with the review that stated the sauce was just as good if not better than take out. My husband loves anything I can serve with rice so this one was a winner for sure!

It tasted great. This being my first time making it, I followed the directions exactly. It got mixed reviews in my household. Many said it had too much of an over powering orange flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly and this was just spectacular!  Much better than the orange beef we get from the Chinese take-out.  My fiancee said this is a keeper, a compliment that doesn't get tossed out lightly.  Thank you for the recipe.

This really was good and quite easy -- a lot of steps -- but none of them difficult.  It could also be easily spiced up with red pepper flakes, if you wanted.  I'll make it again!

Terrific recipe, my wife and I both loved it and will be making it again and again. The only thing I did differently was to coat the brocolli in the orange sauce as well, but that's just personal taste.

The beef turned out crispy and delicious. I put the  meat in the freezer for about an hour then sliced it into very thin strips. And I just tossed it with the cornstarch, then tossed it into hot oil. Then made the sauce.  We all thought the sauce was really too sweet  thus the 4 stars. Also wish I had added some heat to it. Also followed other reviewers and used only one tablespoon ginger. Am now going to try Sandra Lee's recipe from the food network and see it I like it better.

Made this for dinner tonight, and it was great. I monkeyed around w the ingredients a tad... didn't have sirloin, but I had some very thinly sliced ribeye that worked. Also subbed 1/3 cup OJ for the concentrate, and added the juice of the orange I zested at the last minute. Probably could've done without the extra acid. This recipe is a keeper, no doubt. Will make this again, and often.

The sauce in this recipe is absolutely amazing! Like others, I doubled the sauce, so I would have plenty of yummy goodness to go with my rice. I imagine this sauce would also be amazing with lettuce wraps or spring rolls. I did reduce the ginger by a third. SOOOO GOOOD!!

The proportions for the flavors of this are perfection! I was worried that the amount of ginger and garlic called for would overpower the orange, but it turned out pleasingly well-balanced. Follow the recipe exactly and you will not be disappointed.

I thought the beef was very good except I think I may have added to much orange zest as I found it very strong.  The recipe was very easy and the beef crisped up very nicely.  I doubled the sauce as suggested and cut down the ginger root and sugar.  I will definately try again but watch the orange zest more carefully!

I wanted to love this, but it was too sweet for me.  Way too much ginger, so I will tweak that for next time.  Also I don't think I got the oil hot enough to fry the meat, so it just sort of cooked and the corn starch congealed.  Will make again with some changes, but overall a good attempt.

Great recipe-  I followed it almost to a tee except

1) I don't like orange juice concentrate so I replaced it with about 1/4 of fresh squeezed orange juice, from the oranges I used to make the zest. I only needed about two small sunkist oranges to do the job.

2) I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I substituted it with a couple pinches of powdered ginger sprinkled into the soy sauce mix. it worked well, and was a good alternative, especially based on the other reviews here that state that the prescribed amount of ginger overpowers the meat.

3) I like things spicy, and my local restaurant makes their orange chicken/beef with red pepper, so I added approximately 1/2 or 1 tsp of red pepper flakes to the mix, and it was reeeeeally good.

so, I didn't follow it exactly, but it was close enough that I think this recipe, at the very least, is a great base.  I LOVED the way the corn starch crisped the beef.

I made this for dinner tonight but changed a few things. I used chicken breasts instead of beef, cubed it, mixed a pinch of salt n pepper in the cornstarch and tossed the chicken in it 3 hrs before cooking so it would stick. For the veggies I chopped some white onions, green peppers n steamed broccoli in a tbsp of olive after I cooked the chicken in 4 tbsp of vegetable oil. Once I have the cooked chicken n veggies on a separate plate, I prepared my orange sauce : tsp salt, 1/4 cup sugar, a tbsp and a half of kikkoman soy sauce, 1/3 cup of rice wine vinegar. With the same pan I used, I cooked the sauce until it boiled, added the cooked chicken and then the veggies. Goes great with brown rice!

This was really good. I read the reviews, and used orange juice instead of the concentrate. It went together quickly. I fried the meat in a small amount of oil, a few pieces at a time.

Fantastic glaze and cooking method.  I prepared with variety of veggies (broccoli, green pepper, carrots) and the family loved it. Even my one year old son couldn't get enough of the "sweet steak"!  Next time, I will add some red pepper flakes for the hubby and me.  Thank you- this is now a staple recipe in our home.

I loved the meat and the consistency of the sauce. But the sauce was overpowering... I would almost wince when I ate it. The flavors are all good, just too much. Promising enough that I plan to keep trying making some adjustments (less salt for one, maybe less sauce overall). I am excited to get this one just right.

Delicious!  I used half the sugar and doubled the sauce per other recommendations- I will NOT double the sauce again.  The meat should be just coated with the sauce, not swimming in it- doubling the sauce makes WAY too much.   The sauce seemed a little heavy on the vinegar side, so next time I will definitely use less- like half the amount.  I also did not add the orange zest, but maybe if I had it would have helped with the heavy vinegar taste. The beef was very easy to make, though a little time-consuming.  It turned out very crispy but not chewy. Really, my only complaint was too much vinegar, otherwise this recipe is fantastic AS IS!  The entire family liked it, including my toddler and very picky 10 year old :)  This will be a firm addition to our dinner rotation!

This is really tasty. Been making this for years and just realised I hadn't rated it! I serve it over a bed of rice with broccoli or string beans. mmmmm perfect :)

Great Recipe, thanks for sharing. I made this recipe twice, the second time I doubled the sauce. My husband and I both agreed that less sauce was better. Will make this recipe again.

Delicious! The sauce was amazing, and the beef came out crisp and hot. All of my orange juice was mixed up already, so I added 8 TBSP of unconcentrated orange juice. The beef could have used more breading in our opinion, but I will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe comes out amazing! I used a little less ginger and  little less orange zest (out of necessity, not choice!) and it was still fantastic. The drying/cornstarch trick really helps crisp up the beef- and the sauce SMELLS really vinegar-y while you're cooking it, but it comes out beautifully. Love love love it.

left out ginger since DH told me yesterday he doesn't like. too much orange zest. next time do a bit less. otherwise really good. tastes very much like in restaurants. takes quite a few minutes to make meat crispy. So start more in advance.

This was great!  My husband said it was the best orange beef he had ever had. I doubled the sauce and added home grown red pepper flakes. I also followed other suggestions about leaving the corn starch on the meat for awhile. It fried up perfectly.

This recipe was hard to eat. It was a nice texture with the beef, but the sauce was just awful. I am surprised since I normally like a 4+ star recipe here.

this is a very good dish with a few cahnges, I used squeezed fresh juice from blood oranges about 1/3 cup. Only used a 1/4 cup of sugar. Used a table spoon of zest. Added 1/4 cup of dry sherry. Turn out very good.

I chose not to deep fry the beef but to stir fry it and it really came out great! The sauce was amazing. Before making it next time I need a plan for the leftover sauce.

Wonderful! But it is easy to make this healthier. Basically I made it as is except I only used 1 pound of beef. Then, I only used 2 tablespoons of peanut oil in a very hot wok. My husband loved it and we will make it again.

This recipe is one of my family's favorite!  I have made it more times that I care to count.  In the beginning, I deep fried the meat as directed in the recipe.  Now, however, I either broil or BBQ the meat, slice it up, and add to the sauce and broccoli.  I have used beef, elk, and venison in this recipe and the game meat is my favorite.  To prepare the meat, I marinate it at least 10 hours in about 1 tbsp OJ concentrate, 2 tsp soy sauce, 2 tsp rice vinegar, 1 tsp grated ginger, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and about 1/2 tsp black pepper.  I then broil the meat or BBQ it, depending on the weather, to medium doneness.  I then slice the meat and add it to the sauce.  The sauce is the real winner here.  I have found that I need to triple the sauce so that there is enough for four people to serve over the rice.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!

Way too much orange flavor for my family.  If I made again I would cut ginger, orange zest, and orange juice concentrate in half.  Also, double the sauce.  The broccoli is needed simply because this dish is so sweet.

Loved it! Kids and hubby ate it (5 year old was a bit skeptical of the ginger and oj flavor with the sweetness but eventually gave in). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the huge oily mess it made on my stovetop and counters. Probably not the healthiest meal even though I cooked it in olive oil.

This recipe is the kind you want to do when you have some time.  I doubled the sauce and cut down on the ginger like everyone suggested...but it was way too sweet for our taste.  I'm sorry, but I probably won't make it again.

it was so delicious. The only problems I have with it was the fact that it's so greasy(but it's Chinese food) and it took a while to make.  But it's as good if not better than P.F. Changs' orange beef.  We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

I thought this was really yummy! I followed the recipe exactly as stated. The only issue I had with it had more to do with the fact that I can't cook beef very well because I always over cook it and it becomes chewy. We may try this again with chicken and see how that tastes. I really liked it.

A LOT of work, and time consuming.  I have never liked frying meat so that did not help. (my mood)  Good flavor.  I will try the recipe again and use fresh orange juice instead of the concentrate.  I just did not care for the intense tang from the concentrate.  Strangely enough, I had a piece of the beef after it cooled, and it was toned down quite a bit and really tasty.  I will try again, thanks!

holy ginger batman!  The recipe itself is fantastic if you ignore how much ginger it calls for.  My husband and I ended up rinsing the meat off and eating it plain because the amount of ginger was so terrible.  But in the end I suppose I can only blame myself, I thought it would be too much but trusted the recipe´s guidelines.  Will make again, but with alot alot less ginger.

This was awesome! I did use rice vinegar (not rice wine) because that's all I could find. And instead of using two cups of oil, I just put in enough to cover the bottom of the wok and I fried in batches. The sauce was great- I loved it! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was great, and would work with chicken too.  I didn't use brocolli, and put in celery to cook after the meat.  One suggestion, be sure to cut off all of the fat before you cook the meat.  I was too lazy, and when I bit into the fatty part it was really chewy.

As someone who has limited experience with Asian food (the occasional curry here and there), I was going into unknown territory with this one. In the end, however, I couldn't be happier. The taste and textures were both great. It was a really fun recipe to work with. I think it took a while to make but I'm pretty slow as far as most cooks go. The only changes I made were using the juice and zest from one large orange as opposed to the concentrate, and using flour instead of cornstarch. I imagine the recipe works fine either way.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I really like this recipe.  I've made it a few times now though and I always end up putting baking soda into the sauce so that it's not so acidic, am I missing something?  Anyway, with the baking soda the sauce is delicious.  I also add sesame seeds for extra texture.

This gets 5 stars for taste, but the prepping was so messy and I had so many pots for dinner that my cleanup was a bit too much for my liking.  I thought this would be easy and quick, but it took a little longer than I would have liked.

This was SO good!  I did as others suggested and did about 1/3 cup OJ instead of the concentrate.  I think it was the perfect orange flavor and sweetness!  If you not a huge fan of orange peel grate it finely and you won't even notice it.  Great recipe!

This was okay, but I don't think I could handle the overwhelming flavor of orange. Kind of reminded me of pine sol, or some other cleaning product. Definitely not my cup of tea.

I made the recipe as is an its great.  I think it is a little too sweet but it has a great orange flavor.  Minus the sweetness it was exactly what I was looking for.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly but next time will use orange juice instead of the concentrate as everyone said it was too much orange.  I will make this again when we have people over.

This was a great alternative to take-out chinese food!  I also used OJ instead of concentrate (1/3 cup) and added minced ginger and red pepper flakes to the sauce.  I followed other reviews and let the beef (used a london broil sliced very thin) sit in the cornstarch for a few minutes.  Served with rice and a broccoli/red pepper/onion stir fry.  Thanks!

Great Recipe, I was cooking for 10 people I made 16 servings. I doubled the sauce recipe and added 1 cup extra Orange Juice for flavor and 1 Tbsp garlic powder, next time I will triple the sauce.  I did not like the consistency of the sauce so I strained it to remove some of the chunks of garlic and ginger then added about half of it back in. To make the beef more crisp I cooked it longer in a large deep fryer after cooking it a skillet.  Everyone loved it and requested it again next week.

Wonderful recipe; fantastic dish! I followed the recipe almost to the letter but used Italian White wine vinegar b/c I didn't have rice wine vinegar. I used an 11 oz filet mignon & sized other ingredients proportionately & this was perfect size for 2 big servings.   When it came to doing the beef, I followed other tips of letting coated strips rest for 10-15 minutes. Then I fried in batches & used only 1-2 tablespoons oil total. The beef was not crispy like bacon, but it was seared on both sides & well done. Really high quality flavor; better than any takeout I've ever had.  My husband told me afterwards, he saw the orange & thought I was 'wasting' a good filet but now said he'd like that once a week for our red meat night.

I use sherry instead of the vinegar.  I also often use chicken breast instead of meat.  I throw in the broccoli during the last few minutes so it gets all the yummy flavor of the sauce.  The frozen, steam- in- the- microwave broccoli works fine.  Just cook it for half as long as the dirctions say, then throw it in the pan and stir fry.

Unfortunately, no one in my family cared for this recipe.  I made it according to the directions and did not alter it in anyway.  Found it to be extremely labor intensive (thinly slicing the meat, dredging it in the coating etc.)Was disappointed because it sounded so good.

The entire family loves this most excellent recipe; very authentic Chinese flavor. I have made this dish several times now, and always exactly as detailed in this recipe. Personally, I wouldn't change a thing as it is perfect just the way it is.

Only change I would do is reduce the ginger as it was too strong for me but the family loved it.Will leave the beef in the cornstarch longer.Thanks.
Have made this since many times and love it. Use Bison every time and have even made it with chicken. Always double the receipe

Absolutely delicious! My husband just ate 3 plates full of this recipe. I did as others suggested and let the cornstarch-coated beef sit for about 10 minutes before frying it. I used wok oil, just a little at a time, and fried in small batches. I cut the ginger in half and maybe could have done with no orange peel; served with sushi rice and a bag of micro-steam broccoli. I'll be making this again!

This recipe is awesome! We followed it exactly and sprinkled with red pepper flakes and toasted sesame seeds. Perfect. Will definitely make this again.

I cooked this just the way it was written, minus the orange zest.  My family really liked the way the beef came out, but the sauce just didn't taste right.  The guys thought it was too sweet, & I thought it was too vinegary.  Next time, I would cut the vinegar in half, and maybe add some broth to lighten up the flavor and also to make more sauce.

The flavors were great, but the beef didn't stay crispy once I added it to the sauce.  It quickly "gooped up" (cornstarch-y) and thickened the sauce, which I'sure was part of the idea.  Anyway, the flavors were terrific -- although boyfriend requested less ginger next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Never made anything "oriental" before. I made a few modifications, I didn't have any orange juice concentrate, so I took a little over a cup of orange juice and reduced it down to 2 tbsp, used half as much rind, no salt (plenty in the soy sauce) half the sugar, 1/4 tsp powdered ginger instead of fresh, and rice vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar. The Vinegar smell was pretty overpowering and I was scared it wouldn't be any good, but it was awesome!

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and son loved it! We liked the texture of the meat. I will make this again and again and again. The only thing I would change is cut down on the sugar by at least 1/4 of a cup less. It was a little too sweet but oh so good! Thanks for the addition to our family favorites!

As my husband will say "this stuff rocked!"  We greatly enjoyed this recipe, the kids even ate it and they can be a bit picky with stir frys.  I doubled the sauce, which was nice for the rice to soak up a bit.  We are going to try it again but with pork and then chicken.  Maybe add a few veggies to the sauce and meat.  Very, very good.  Thanks!

I doubled this recipe for my family of four -  following the recipe exact.  I wanted leftovers for lunch the next day....well, I had to beg for them to leave leftovers.  They ate 3/4's of it and were still licking the plate.  Great recipe - tonight I'm going to try the sauce as a glaze for green beans as a side to chicken.  It's a great sauce! As a warning to messy cooks, my kitchen was a disaster from the frying (which I rarely do).  I had grease splatters EVERYWHERE - maybe I fried it on a temp too high , plus I wasn't using a wok, just a frying pan.

This took quite a while to make, but it was so worth it!  I made these changes: (1) Doubled the sauce but not the salt; (2) Dipped the beef in flour, then egg, then flour again; and (3) Used 1/3 c. freshly squeezed OJ instead of concentrate.  Half my family thought it was too sweet, and half thought it was just right, so next time I will halve the sugar and see how it turns out.  I even used a cheap cut of meat and it still turned out amazingly yummy.  Super recipe!

This is really, really good and so crispy - the best part.  Make sure you try this one.  For some you may want a little less sugar, just depends on your taste.  I'm sure it will be fine with less.  I did double the sauce part as it is needed.

Gosh this is so delicious as it, but even better with a splash of wine in the sauce, as well as a pinch of cayenne or chili paste. I omit the salt as there is enough sodium in the soy sauce. At the last minute we add red pepper matchsticks and sliced green onions. Good with chicken too!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I fried the beef in a small amount of peanut oil as suggested by another reviewer over medium high, but would do it over a little higher heat next time to get it a bit crispier.  Also, I didn’t have any fresh ginger so I chopped up some drained pickled ginger. I often use this because the fresh ginger we get is often very dry and fibrous.  I put the cornstarch in a fairly large Tupperware saver and shook the beef in it, letting the dust settle before opening it.  My daughter doesn’t like orange, so I may try it with lemon or limeaid next time, or with pork tenderloin or chicken breasts.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this was great.  It tasted just like what you would get at a restaurant.  I did make some substitutions.  I didn't have orange juice concentrate, just orange juice, so I used that.  I also didn't have fresh ginger, but used ground ginger.  And for the orange zest I used a little bit of lemon extract since my food substitution book said that this was an ok sub for lemon zest (which I also didn't have any of).  The only thing I didn't like about the recipe is it didn't make much of a sauce.  If I make it again, I will make more sauce.  Very good with rice.

This recipe turned out amazing!My husband and family loved it. The only change I made was that I didn't have concentrated OJ, so I used regular, which also increased the sauce. I thought it was going to be too thin but once I added the meat  it thickened up nicely.

I found that I needed to double the cornstarch in order to get an even coat on the meat.  in addition.  make sure you have a thermometer so you can keep the oil around 350 degrees otherwise, very good.

What a great recipe! This was delicious. The beef was crispy and the orange sauce was to die for. I used garlic/ginger flavored wok oil rather than adding fresh garlic and ginger. I didn't have any orange juice concentrate, so I used a fresh squeezed orange and a little more zest than it called for. It turned out fabulous. A definite hit!

The sauce is so good! Usually these orange sauces leave a lot to be desired, but this was spot on. It did take a long time to fry all the meat though. Though definitely not a quick fix.

A challenging dish to make, but worth it overall. I added about 1 1/2 of the sauce ingredients to make sure that I had enough of the sauce. I'll make this dish again when I have more time & patience but my wife loved it

On the one hand I think I could give this 4 stars, but I didn't make a good beef choice - which was my fault.  When I have made this kind of dish before, I have had more success using a nicer cut of beef and slicing it very very thin.  This time, to save time, I chose stir fry beef and sliced it a bit thinner.  But it was too tough.  It was not quite as nice as a Mongolian Beef recipe that is similar.  Not bad, but not good enough to crave and want again.

Yum- DH has already requested to have again later this week!  I don't think the sauce was too sweet.  It was a nice balance of sweet and the tang of the rice vinegar.  I definately cut back on the ginger.  We just are not big fans of lots of ginger.  But other than that we made exactly as is.

This recipe is okay, but much too sweet. Next time I will cut down the sugar by at least half and dilute the orange juice.

Wow.  It is so good.  I didn't use fresh ginger but I think next time I will.  Also, I didn't use 2 cups of oil for frying.  I think that's too much.  You just need enough to cover the beef when frying.

Yummy! I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce while using less sugar. I also added some scallions and toasted sesame seeds at the end. A huge hit!

Maybe I did something wrong, it was my first attempt at chinese food, but we didn't care to much for this.  It also took a very long time to prepare.

Very delicious recipe!  We did not have enough ginger and it came out with too strong of a citrus flavor.  Next time I would cut down the orange peel.  Also, pretty labor intensive meal.  But still, very good!

I did as other reviews suggested and let the beef sit for 10 mins after dipping it in starch and then I shook it in a colendar to get the excess starch off. To make the beef extra crispy I dipped it in panko crumbs then fried it. I doubled the sauce but left the sugar and oj the same. It was very good and I will be making this again.

Excellent.In addition to incorporating other reviewers suggestions I did following. I only used 3-4 tblsps of oil to fry 300g of beef (significantly less that the prorated amount of arnd 1/2 cup). Used double the amount of fresh orange juice instead of orange juice concerntrate.

For my taste, the sauce was too sweet.  I could not taste the beef or rice through the sauce.  I liked the beef before added to the sauce and will use as a base for a lighter, less sweet sauce in future.

This was a very big hit in my home. I left out the orange zest and add a little more orange concentrate instead. It was very delicious and will be made again.

Loved the flavor! I had a couple of foo-pahs though.  My beef needed to be more tender.  I don't normally fry, so I'm not sure if I'm not used to doing so with meat coated in corn starch or if I don't like it.  Well definitely try again and mix corn starch with a little flour. Careful to not reduce the sauce too much.  Thanks for posting BEC.

This was really good, but I think I will play around with the ingredients next time through. Less sugar and will add some Sambal for a bit of heat. Overall, a very good meal, we both enjoyed it alot, thanks!

This was a huge hit at our house!  From reading other reviews I did go with doubling the sauce and it was perfect!  The only other things that I did was add an extra tablespoon of orange juice and reduced the salt in half.

My husband commented that the presentation and favor of this recipe was very professional but it just didn't suit him.  For somebody who has eaten and enjoyed Crispy Orange Beef in the past, I think this recipe will be a hit.  For us, I think this recipe will be retired. The fruitiness of the OJ with the beef just didn't do it for me.

This is about as good as it gets.  The only way I could suggest improving the dish would be to use beef tenderloin, but that may be gilding the lily.   I did not have any orange juice concentrate, but I had fresh high-pulp orange juice - I simmered 3/4 cup of the juice down to 1/3 cup and it was perfect in the dish.  In fact, since the fresh juice concentrate had no added sugar, the dish was perfect with the amount of sugar called for in the recipe.    We will definitely make this often and save about $25 in restaurant costs!

Great recipe! I only used OJ in lieu of the concentrate and mixed a bit of flour in with the cornstarch. It has a nice authentic flavor and I'll make it again and probably try others suggestions of flour only instead of cornstarch.

Made this with chicken instead of beef but followed the rest as noted.  I liked it better than the family did.  If I were to make it again, not sure if I would add the orange zest, or probably a little less.

I made this recipe for my husband tonight. He's not particularly fond of asian food. I doubled the sauce ingredients as others suggested. Also, used less sugar. It took longer than 5 minutes for the sauce to thicken tough and end and chase and left of and if end stuff and tough choice and, but it was well worth the wait. I loved it, and even my husband said it was delicious. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very disappointing. I was really looking forward to trying this recipe because of the great reviews. The flavor was so strong that we couldn't even eat it. I added a bunch of water to dilute the sauce enough so that it was edible. It also took over two hours to complete the meal, I would have expected a much better meal with the time it took to make it.

My husband was iffy about this meal when he came home from work and saw me cooking it.  He was pleasantly surprised when we sat down to eat!  This was great and I had to improvise a little bit.  I only had fresh orange to squeeze the juice out of and I forgot to peel some rind before throwing it in the trash.  I also only had about half of the rice wine vinegar b/c I ran out.  It was still phenomenal!  I love the undertone of the orange and the beef was so tender!  It didn't exactly get crispy but that was my fault I think.  I didn't dry it out as specified in the recipe and I know that would have made a difference.  I will definitely make this again and will follow the more recipe more exact so I'm sure it will be even better the next time around!

This was great. My family loved it, my husband is wanting me to make it for some company that is coming over. I did have to make some changes due to what I had on hand. I only used about a pound of meat, regular orange juice, and only 2tsp of ginger. Even with the changes it was GREAT. Next time I will add some more veggies.

Absolutely fantastic!  My Brazilian boyfriend and Dutch best friend were almost fighting over who got to have the last helping, which would've been their 3rd!

That is the best at home ethnic food I have ever prepared. I am not a big beef eater... but I will be trying this with chicken very soon. The sauce was so good, I could have drank it!

This recipe is fantastic. I used sirloin steak for the beef. I didn't have OJ concentrate, so I just reduced about 1/3 cup of fresh orange juice. I also didn't have Ginger, so I just left it out but it would have been even better with some. And I substituted cut asparagus for the broccoli. It is as good as the crispy beef from a restaurant, nice and pungent without being so salty. Highly recommended.

My family really enjoyed, but wow is it a mess to make! Be sure  to cut beef in thin slices so it is easier to get crispy when frying.

Good recipe and great presentation!  I did make several changes to the procedure, though. I bought the top sirloin already thinly sliced and stacked it and cut it into strips.  Then I layered all the strips out onto wax paper and put another piece on top.  Then I pounded all the pieces with a mallet. After reading other reviews that said the meat is not crispy, I asked the butcher, who said to dip the meat in seasoned flour, then egg, and then back in the flour again.  Now let it dry about 10 min before frying. A little time consuming, but it turns out flavorful and crispy, just like a good restaurant!  I'd rate it a 5 star with these changes. And I'll definitely make it again!!

We did not particularly care for this recipe.  It was edible, but not enjoyable.  I reduced the sugar by just a little because my husband doesn't like his meat too sweet, and I doubled the sauce because we like things saucy.  The orange flavor was WAY too strong.  It was about all I could taste besides the garlic.  Also, the sauce did not really thicken much for me.  It was still very watery after more than 20 minutes.  Don't think I will be trying this one again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did not use all the ginger like some of the others.  My hubby is not one for left overs but he ate this again 3 days later.

I will definately make again.

This recipe was great!  I agree with a  lot of the other reviews - the sauce is restaurant quality.  I followed the advice of others by cutting the amount of sugar in half and doubling the sauce.  I thawed out frozen broccoli and cooked it in the sauce before adding in the beef.  I will definitely make this again!!

Delicious! I cooked the top sirloin in grapeseed oil (using only 1/4 of the oil specified) and doubled the sauce, both of which I will do again. This recipe is a bit more labor-intensive than I usually prefer, but it was well worth the extra prep time.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly - the only change I would make next time is double the sauce as some of the other reviewers suggested.
I brought leftovers to work for lunch the next day; everyone commented on how good my lunch smelled, and I got several requests for the recipe.
This one is a keeper for sure!

Followed the recipe as directed, only adding fresh ginger instead of powdered.  Great flavor and I would definitely make again.  Also, instead of wasting the orange after using the zest, I added the segmented orange into the beef.  Good stuff!

This is a very, very good recipe. But, my goodness - I certainly would not add the additional salt into the mixture with the soy sauce - WOW! So, I left out the salt and the orange zest. Used orange juice instead of concentrate and it was very good. Remember: You MUST fry this in very small batches to get the "crispness" of the meat, and a little cornstarch at the bottom of wok will help thicken the sauce. I have made this twice and everyone loved it and served with homemade egg rolls. Thanks!

This was REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!  BUT My beef was not crispy - I would just stir fry them in little oil next time to save fat/calories.  I added mixed veggies after adding the sauce to the pan - carrots, mushrooms, onions, peppers and celery.  Also doubled the sauce.  It was SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!  Thanks!!

This recipe is good, but in my opinion, not good enough to justify the amount of time involved to make it. I followed other reviewers’ suggestions and cut the sugar back and added some red chili paste for a little heat - the flavor was pretty good but I wished I’d cut back the vinegar as well. Always good to try something new but my husband and I were not overly impressed and I would not spend that much time again for just an okay dish.

This was WONDERFUL!  My picky 6 and 3 year old kids even ate it up.  The only thing was that it wasn't very crispy.  Still, it browned well and tasted great!

Not sure if I used the wrong brand of orange juice concentrate because it had too much orange flavor.  Other than that, it was really tasty.

For my personal taste i think it had a tad too much ginger, so i think i will lower it next time.....thats if i do make it again.  Although it was good, it just wasnt what i was thinking.

Who needs take out when this dish can be created right from the convenience of your own kitchen without too much effort!?!?  The only thing I'd recommend is to use low-sodium soy sauce!

We love this one!  I make it as written and it's great.  We love the sauce and I generally double that part of the recipe.  Yummy!

The sauce and beef prep is really good.  You can easily add different veggies to change this up and add variety. My picky husband gave it a thumbs up.I cooked it like a saute and only used about a tablespoon of oil.  2 cups is a deep fry.

Very good.  My only suggestion would be to add some spice.  Try it with  Vietnamese chili garlic sauce, but go easy...it's really hot!

This is the first time I've ever made a meal like this and any faults with it were probably due to my inexperience. With that being said everyone that ate it tonight said it was good. Personally after having this I think I'd just rather have a beef teriyaki type dish instead but that is just my own personal taste. This was good and I will consider making it again some time but it won't be a regular for us.

Very nice recipe! Beef cooked up nice and crispy, and the sauce was very tasty. My boyfriend kept going on and on and on about how good it was. I didn't really measure any if the ingredients for the sauce, just added as much as I though would be good. I added a little too much orange zest for my liking, but that was my fault. I served this with Sesame Broccoli, from this site. Great combo :)

I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the sugar, and I'm gald I did, because it would definately have been too sweet.  If I make this again, I'll also eliminate the orange zest. The orange juice gives this all the orange flavour it needs.

Loved this!  If you don't fry meat often make sure you use a splatter guard to avoid a messy clean up.

The sauce is wonderful....but very sweet.  I will definately make again, but will reduce the sugar (if not omit).  I did double the sauce and coat the meat with cornstarch (and let sit about 10 minutes) like another reviewer suggested.  Hubby said it was good, but thought I should use this with chicken (not beef).  His comment is that orange goes better with chicken....and I think I agree.   Thanks for the post.  Will use again (probably with chicken next time).

The flavor was good despite the fact that I got a little generous with the orange peel.  The coating was kind of difficult to get to stay on the beef.  The dish was good however I probably won't make again.

I modified this recipe a bit, I didnt have any oranges around the house, but I had lemons, so I swapped out the orange for lemon. It was pretty good, but my boyfriend and I found it on the sweet side, so next time I wont use as much sugar. I also fried the beef in a wok instead of a deep fryer.

Pretty good - the beef turned out dry but I think that was my fault.  It looked amazing.  Also, the sauce was VERY sweet.  It didn't leave any sauce for the rice or brocolli, so that was a little bland.

This wasn't as hard to make as it first appeared.  The sauce was incredible, but for some reason the flavor didn't stick to the beef as much as I would have liked.  The beef turned out too chewy and a bit bland.  I think that next time I will incorporate the broccoli into the beef and sauce mixture, and maybe add some "accent" to the beef before starching it.

I used round steak and it turned out super!  My husband enjoyed it and nothing is better when you have all the ingredients to prepare. (used frozen broccoli) Very simple but out of the norm taste. Thank you for sharing your recipe!
It's a keeper!

Ugh. This recipe is a pain! The flavor is just ok. I rarely say take out is better but in this case take out rules. The end result is mediocre at best and when you add up the time and effort it takes to make it you'll wish you had called your favorite Chinese place for delivery.

This was so yummy. Everyone loved it. I tripled the sauce because of the number of people I was entertaining - except for the ginger, I used the original amount listed because I was afraid of the ginger overpowering everything. The sauce had a great flavor. Thanks!

Fantastic recipe!  The frying meat made a mess of my stove top, but this recipe is a keeper in my household.  We love the ginger's zing, and the fresh orange taste.  I think I will use this recipe when company comes.  Very nice meal!  Thanks a lot, Bec...

I am by no means a fan of meat and fruit together, but I quite enjoyed this. I used orange juice because that's what I had, and 1 teaspoon of orange zest; it was still pretty zippy! The beef turned out really well - crispy yet tender. I'm sure I will make this again but I will omit the orange, and try to go for a sweeter/spicier sauce, like the Sweet and Spicy Beef dish you can get at the Cheesecake Factory. Thanks!

The first thing I have to say about this recipe is WAY TOO MUCH GINGER. I even put in a bit less than called for, as per other reviewers, and it was still much too strong. I suppose that if you change that the recipe would be good, but I've been burned on this one and probably won't try it again.

This recipe was so good, my boyfriend and I loved it. However it take a while to prepare but it was worth it. I did double the sauce and used orange juice instead of the concentrate. Will definitely make this again!

Wow!!  This was absolutely fabulous and tasted as good if not better than restaurant ginger beef!!  I have been craving chinese food my whole pregnacy and had to find a recipe to make at home and this is it!! I made a double recipe for 3 of us and it was all gone!!  It was a bit labor intesive but I think it will go quicker the next time because I know what to do now!!  Thanks!

Wonderful! We don't need to go to our favorite chinese place anymore.  We loved the fact that the meat is not clouded in a thick batter.  The flavors are complex and authentic tasting.

Made this for the family last night.  4 different kids with different tastes and they all loved it! I used fresh orange juice rather than the concentrate and it came out just fine!  I would taste the "syrup" before you add the beef to be sure it has the  balance of orange (sweet & tangy)and Soy Sauce (to each his or her own).  This receipe is complete and lovely!
