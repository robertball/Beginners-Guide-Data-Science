I've been testing several granola recipes lately.  This one is my favorite!  I do make some changes, and like the recipe description says, it's very versatile!  I use 1/2 cup flax seed (the miracle grain, as I call it) and omit the wheat germ and sunflower seeds.  I use 1/2 cup sliced almonds and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  I also add 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  I love the nutmeg and cinnamon - it smells so good baking!  For cost reasons, I only use raisins and dried cranberries for the fruit.  I end up baking mine for almost 40 minutes until it is toasted and crunchy.  It clumps up very nicely.  Hint: stir the oil and honey together first before adding to oat mixture.

Very good granola. I quadrupled the recipe but only made 2 1/2x the syrup (oil and honey). I combined all the dry ingredients (except for the dry fruit and placed it in the oven for about 20 minutes to toast them up. I combined the oil and honey in a saucepan with the cinnamon and a pinch of salt and brought it to a boil. This thinned out the honey and made it easier to pour over all the dry ingredients. I added the dried fruit 1/2 way thru the baking so they would not burn. I needed to bake the granola for much much longer than suggested. But it was very good.

I have been following & making this reciped for 3 months now. My only modification is to half the recipe (since I'm the only one who eats it) and omit the sunflower seeds (not a fan). Otherwise, I have memorized this recipe and eat it mixed w/what ever at least 5 days a week!

Excellent recipe!  I took the advice of another reviewer and boiled the honey first to make it spread further.  Thanks for a great recipe Chris!

This was good.  We took the advice from another reviewer to mix the honey and oil together first! I then waited to add the oatmeal until last after mixing the other ingred. with honey/oil mix. Instead of wheat germ, I used an extra 1/4 cup flax seed and didn't add sunflower seeds.  For fruit, we used raisins and craisins.  We baked about 25-30 min. until we started to smell it, then I took it out because I didn't want it to burn.  Ours didn't break into pieces.  *update*  We made this again and liked it much better the second time for some reason.  I let it cool and sit overnight and I think the key may be to let it cool COMPLETELY (I realized I didn't do that the first time) because then it did actually break a little more into pieces.  We love this for cereal in the morning!

Needed a recipe for granola for the lodge that I cook for. This one is so easy and so tasty without being oversweet and having too many ingredients and too much sugar. I used cramberries, raisons, oats and sliced almonds and almond extract. And just added ground flax seed for the other stuff cause thats what I had on hand. Every one loves it and it is so much fresher than the store bought stuff that we pay so much for. I recipe made 3 1/2 quarts for maaybe the price of one stale bag.

Granola didn't break apart in chunks as expected so I baked it a little longer with same result.  Looks more like cereal.  Followed recipe exactly except used safflower oil in place of canola oil.  Maybe that was the problem.  Tastes delicious so will use it as cereal.  Rated as a three but partly my fault because of oil replacement.  Thanks, Chris!

Like others, I have tweaked the recipe a bit.  I used 1/2 cup of flax seed, omitted the sunflower seeds, and omitted the fruit. Tastes great when added to my greek yogurt for breakfast! Great recipe!

Ok I am reviewing this BEFORE the granola is completely cool.  So far it looks great and I am sure DH will LOVE it.  I did change things (I hate it when people review and change thing on the first time but here I am!)  I did not have much honey and really wanted to make this so I used a little molasses and the rest dark corn syrup (Ok not as health but it worked).  I also just threw in any dried fruit or nuts that I had on hand.  I really don't think there will be any left from this batch when my husband gets home from work because I figure the teens will get a hold of it first.    THanks for the recipe.

Ooh! this was good. I didn't have the flax seed and wheat germ (will buy next time) but I added dried mango, pineapple, apricots, raisins, and chopped almonds. I toasted the almonds and oats for 15 minutes then added the dried fruits and cooked for another 15 minutes. Also, it is imperative to let the granola cool COMPLETELY before handling. Otherwise it will be too crumbly like cereal. If you leave it to cool, it will harden and then you can break it up to suit your own needs. Overall,great taste and highly addictive!!

This is the best granola recipe! The only thing I did different from the recipe was mix the oil and honey together before mixing it with the dry ingredients! I will definitely be making this again.

This granola was very good! I did replace the canola oil with coconut oil, added cocoa powder to half, and for the fruit used raisins, craisins, and chopped dried apricots. I preferred the chocolate granola!

Very, very good. Not oily at all. Great combination of crunch, fruit, and sweetness. Had to sub two other dried fruits for the papaya and the pineapple, so I used diced prunes and chopped dates.

My two year old is the very picky, but she loves this recipe. It does come out more as a cereal than because the honey is hard to stir into the dry ingredients and uniformly coat everything.

I make this granola every 2 weeks and eat it almost every day with greek yogurt and berries.  Even my picky husband loves it.  Definitely heat the oil and honey for a few minutes to loosen it up, you don't need to boil it, just warm it so mixes better. Change up your nuts or fruits to get more variety. This one is a keeper.

Great recipe.  As I celiac, I had to use gluten-free oats and substituted Chia seed for the wheat germ.  I also added pumpkin seeds and didn't use raisins.

Super stuff! Like other reviewers, I used half almonds, half walnuts. I also mixed the oil and honey together (and added a splash of vanilla) before adding to the dry ingredients; this made for smoother, more even mixing. It needed more baking - at least half an hour.
I didn't have pineapple and papaya so I replaced them with dried apricots and more craisins. It was very wise to add the fruit in after the baking - this way, nothing burned. I also added the flax in at that time since heat ruins it nutritionally. This is a amazing stirred into plain yogurt, with milk, or eaten plain.
