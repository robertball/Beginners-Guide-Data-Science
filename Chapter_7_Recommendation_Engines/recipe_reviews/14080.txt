Overall, it was delicious.  However, I found the instructions unclear and very difficult to follow,as quite a few steps were missing.  Definitely read the recipe and modify it before attempting to thoroughly enjoy the whole experience.

Took a while with me standing over everything watching it cook, but in the end the time was well spent.  It's more of a roasted seasoned vegetable dish with rice than it is a "stew", but great nonetheless.

The end result was well worth the hour and a half cooking time.  The directions were a little bit hard to follow, but after making it once you get the idea :)  I made this when my friends came over with their 3 year old daughter.  I didn't heat the stew up to hot, so she could still use her fingers to eat with.  She enjoyed this and we had fun naming the different kinds of vegetable.

I was conflicted with how many stars to give this recipe.  The end result was delicious, with complex flavour. But as other reviewers noted, there is a lot left out in the instructions.  I would recommend this recipe to experienced cooks who already know how to toast the seeds, roast the garlic and peppers, and have a clear sense of the flavour and texture they are aiming for. The only change I made was adding acorn squash, which looked great today at the grocery store. And...I never figured out what the 2/3 cup cooked rice was for. Great inspiration, gaps in the instructions. Thanks!

I tried this recipe and it was TERRIBLE.  The veggies are overcooked and the look and taste are not palatable at all.  Sorry don't waste your time!
