I made this recipe but instead of 4 cups of walnuts, I used 2 cups of raisins and 2 cups of chopped pecans.  For the raisins I boiled them in a cup of water for 1 minute then let them stand in the water until I was ready to use them.  This extra step makes for plump juicy raisins.  I then followed the instructions as shown to make the "braid".  This technic created the most beautiful Babka I've ever made.  This recipe is a keeper.  I will try next time using seedless raspberry jam and bittersweet chocolate.  Just an idea for new bakers, if you don't have an oven that proofs bread, turn your oven on to its lowest temp (125 degrees) and once its reached it  turn the oven off and leave the door open a crack to cool down.  When your ready to proof the dough you will have the perfect warm draft free place to do it.  Make sure you close the oven door while the dough is raising.  Good luck hope it works as well for you as it has for me.

I saw this recipe in my Allrecipes magazine and knew I wanted to make it.  It was a very easy dough to prepare.  The filling was quickly made.  It reminds me of making cinnamon rolls, in that you roll out the dough (although thinner than cinnamon rolls) spread with filling and roll up.  Then the dough log is cut in half, lengthwise, and braided before putting into a loaf pan.  Yes, it is kind of messy, but really does make a very tasty and beautiful loaf--it will impress your friends!  I will be making this again as you can use many different fillings.  One suggested in Allrecipes magazine is using peanut butter and jelly, and that is one my hubby would love.  I followed the recipe as written, but since I was "road-testing" it, I did only make half a recipe--it made one full sized loaf and a small loaf.  Next time I will make the full recipe.   Thank you Nicholio for sharing this recipe!

Made this today and it turned out great. Twisting them was a bit of a challenge as the filling was a little wet and seemed to overload the dough. Cooking erased my worries, though. I made the cinnamon raisin ones and drisled icing on them.
