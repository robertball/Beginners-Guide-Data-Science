I made this according to directions except for adding 1 1/4 cups of broth.   I used a dry sherry for the wine because it is what was handy.  The directions are very good, but perhaps a note should be added about toasting the pecans: Chop pecans, toast in a dry skillet over med high heat, being careful not to burn. It does not take very long! This was a perfect side, served with an elk roast.   Very delicious.
