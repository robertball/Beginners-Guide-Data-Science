Delicious muffins! They have a nice crispness to them from the crumb topping, but the muffins themselves are soft, moist and fluffy, with a good amount of apple flavor. Since I used really sweet Gala apples, I lessened the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and honey to 1/3 cup--and I would do that again next time. In the future, I'd probably use brown sugar in place of white, too. Oh, and just for personal preference, I would probably shred the apples next time, in order to get more apple flavor per bite. I got 19 muffins out of this recipe, and they were perfectly baked in 23 minutes. Make sure to fill the muffin cups up pretty full too, as they don't rise a lot. And use more than a teaspoon of crumb topping per muffin (like 2 teaspoons per instead) or you'll end up with a lot leftover. Thanks for the recipe!
