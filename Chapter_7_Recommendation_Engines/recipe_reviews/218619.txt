Yummy and oh so easy. The only thing I would add to the instructions is to cook the stems first, then add the leaves a few minutes later. That way, the stems aren't over-cooking while you are waiting for the stems to get cooked.

This is a perfectly written recipe.  Easy execution and just a few, basic ingredients lend an elegant simplicity I appreciate. I used grapeseed oil rather than vegetable oil, basically because I had it on hand to use.  I also did not cook the garlic in the oil (never do).  I added it to the bok choy about half way through the cooking time. I'm happy to be the first to review this delicious and dependable side dish which I served with Asian Grilled Chicken and Classic Fried Rice, recipes also from this site.

I made this with one head of regular (not baby) bok choy and two cloves crushed garlic.  It really wasn't enough so I added a bunch of spinich.  It was SO simple and delicious, with and without the spinich.  Will definitely make again.

This was a strech for me as I have never ventured into bok choy before.  I used a nonstick pan and about a tablespoon of olive oil. Followed the suggestions cooking the white pieces with the garlic which I grated over the top, first.  I also grated in a bit of fresh ginger.  When they were softened I added the greens and let them steam uncovered until wilted. Stiring occasionally. I sprinkled some sea salt on when served. The results were great. Light, crunchy, quite tasty and my husband agreed.  We will do this again.  Thanks so much!

Made this for dinner and everyone enjoyed it.  It is important to cook the white part of the bok choy first as the leaf part cooks quickly.

This is simply delicious! I added four cloves of garlic since we love anything with garlic. I also powedered in some ginger powder since I didn't have any fresh root. I've seen people in China put tiny slivers of spicy red pepper in their bok choy to heat it up a bit. I would think you could even add red pepper flakes to it too and it would be fabulous! Thank you for an excellent base for bok choy. It was delicious.

5 stars for ease and simplicity of making it. I used regular bok choy instead of baby bok choy as the price difference is horrendous!

Great simple recipe. I drizzled about 1/3 of a soy sauce packet over the bok choy in the last mintue of cooking instead of adding salt.

Perfect! I needed something quick and tasty but not competing with the main dish tonight. The prep, and sauté time took mere minutes to cook up the baby bok choy and it was done. I seasoned with a little Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. Simple and delicious! It still had the nice green color and was tender crisp. I served this with, “Japanese Ginger Pork,” and “Oriental Green Bean Salad,” also from this site.

My wife and I enjoyed this very much. Simple and easy. Next time I might skip the salt and add some chicken stock. I liked one of the comments to cook the stems first and then add the top part so it cooked evenly.

I never knew how to make bok choy until I made it this way.  My husband and I now make it a regular vegetable!  It cannot get simpler than this - and super tasty!

So easy and so delicious! I only used one clove of garlic - love garlic but one clove was plenty. I took the advice of some of the reviewers and added the stems first and stir fried for about three minutes, added the leaves, cooked for another three minutes and then drizzled some soy sauce on it the last 30 seconds. I inhale this once it's finished!

What an excellent recipe to try out a new vegetable.  I picked up baby bok choy at the farmer's market, then went looking for a recipe.  Delicious, with nothing to overwhelm the flavor, simple/ quick & healthy!!! I used olive oil & added a little fresh ground pepper.  Thanks for sharing.

Nope, didn't like this one. I had high hopes, but I guess we just aren't bok choy people. Thanks for submitting it though. I always like to try new things even if we don't care for them a lot.

I love bok choy, and thisis, inmy opinion, one of the best ways to make it. The only Things I did differently was to not chop the bok choy before cooking and to serve it with a wedge of lemon. So delicious! Thanks.

We liked this a lot.  I did as others suggested and cooked the stalks a bit longer than the leafy greens.  Bok choy is a new favorite with us and this recipe is a delicious, and easy, way to enjoy it.  Thanks, Frantic Cook.  I served this with grilled pork chops and rice.

Fantastic and very simple recipe for a very healthy veggie! Never knew in the past how to prepare so simply, it's the perfect side dish to my Asian dishes. I usually do a dash of garlic powder instead of cloves and sub low-sodium soy sauce instead of salt for more taste. Great over rice!

Simple to cook, very tasty.  As other reviewers advised, I cooked the stalks a bit before adding in the leaves.  I also doubled the garlic, just because I really love the flavor of sauteed garlic. When I added the leaves, I also added several chopped green onions, because I had them on hand and needed to use them.  Thanks for this recipe - I enjoyed and will regularly cook this again.

I made this last night, and it was very easy to make! The only reason I took away one star, is because it was very bland!! I ended up adding garlic powder, Morton's Season Salt, and Liquid Aminos- which is healthy alternative to soy sauce. Now THAT, gave it flavor and made the dish very tasty! I love simple ideas like this, but remember,  it will be extremely boring if you only add the crushed fresh garlic.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe - he thought the greens tasted like broccoli.  I liked it, but not as much as I like salads made with raw bok choi.  I did add some mushrooms and I think it would be good with onions as well.

Used this recipe to make some bok choy for another recipe. Turned out great! I used regular sized bok choy, followed another reviewer's advice to cook the stems first.

This was great! I could see myself playing around with the ingredients here occasionally but even unchanged, this was a delicious side dish to our Asian tenderloin.  Keeping this recipe handy as I'll be repeating this one a LOT! Thanks for posting.

Great recipe! Super simple and tasty. Substituted vegetable oil with coconut oil, and had soya sauce on the side for dipping. Mmm!

It was an excellent recipe.  Could eat as is, no fuss.  My husband added a few drops of balsamic glaze and that turned out good too.  We added a bit of hot sauce or hot pepper flakes and that was good too.  Fried in sesame oil for Asian flair with fried rice.

Thanks for the clear instructions. Just made bok choy for the first time and it was delicious!

I like to follow recipes like this by taste so I put loads of added olive oil as it fried with fresh garlic. I also mixed in my favorite steak seasoning (I like it on everything fried haha sodium free) which added really good flavor with a little bit of salt. I also used a lid so it was steaming at the same time, I find it cooks better like that sometimes.

Definitely going to be making this again!

This was pretty good; I found myself with some bok choy in the fridge with no ideas, so I thought I would give this a try. I added tofu and some frozen corn and a tiny bit of miso paste for flavor. I also added a bit of salt, pepper, and hot pepper flakes for a little bit of bite. I enjoyed it!

This was the first time I have ever cooked Bok Choy and the recipe was so easy to follow. The only changes I made was that I used 3 tsp of prepared minced Garlic and instead of adding salt, I added a little of the Szechuan sauce. It was amazing. Next time I will try the oyster sauce.

We used full-size bok choy, as the store had no baby bok choy available.  This was a side veggie at Thanksgiving, and it was a big hit.  I cooked it in a wok and allowed it to steam covered most of the cooking time.  Simple and delicious.

I wasn't a huge fan of these, I even added caramelised onions for a little more flavour, and it didn't help a whole lot. I would consider making this again, it was okay for the leftover bok choy I had. I wouldn't buy bok choy specifically to make this though.

This was a first time cooking Bok Choy so I think I'm lending more of the dislike to my own errors and not the recipe.  Going to try some other stuff and see how it goes.

This was tasty! I made this recipe using some normal-sized bok choy leftover from making stir fry. I enjoyed adding a tablespoon of soy sauce, though next time I would probably use less.

I forgot how good Bok Choy is and this is a great stand alone side dish,  however, the second time I made it I used regular Bok Choy and added saute' shrimp and a little stir fry sauce to make it the main dish.

Though I'm sure I've had Bok Choy in Asian food many times, I never had it alone till recently at a dinner party.  The cook made it basically the same way as this recipe, except for adding some sliced fresh ginger.  

I followed the method in this recipe, using a large head of Bok Choy, and added:
A few Tbsp thinly sliced crystallized ginger
3 big  garlic  cloves, thinly sliced
1/4 medium onion thinly sliced
A few shakes reduced sodium soy sauce
i sautéed the above together, then tossed in:
a few handfuls of fresh spinach leaves, sliced into strips. 
and as it was looking a bit dry, I added:
About 1/4 c broth from a Chinese restaurant
 Delicious!  The photo was taken after it sat on the stove for awhile, so it doesn't look as fresh and green as it had been

I did not make any changes because I wanted to see how it tasted as given. It  was super easy and super good. I would highly recommend making it.  I used the large bok choy and chopped it up.

I love bok choy, and this was easy and delicious! First time chopping them up, and I liked it better (have always cooked whole, as they come). I cooked the white parts first for a few minutes, then added the leafy green parts until they wilted, another 2-3 min. I also added the garlic during the cooking time. Did not saute in oil as mentioned. I was tempted to add soy sauce or sesame oil but didn't. Excellent as-is, and I know I'll make again. Thank you!

I've tried this with both baby bok choy and bok choy. The kids love it with the baby bok choy but won't eat it with the bok choy. Baby bok choy it is!

This is super easy to make and tasty!  My kids even ate it!  I used full bok choy, rather than baby, due to availability.

I bought some bok choy on a whim and then I didn't know what to do with it. I went to Allrecipes and found this quick and easy way to make it. We both liked it, but it will never be my favorite vegetable. That is just my personal preference. This was a great way to fix it.

Very good bok choy. We used garlic powder instead of normal garlic. Still a good bok choy. Could use a bit more flavor though, added dipping sauces and it was perfect.

Great easy recipe!
The leafy tops cooked faster than the stems. Next time I will cook the stems and add in the leafy tops just before the stems are done cooking. Thank you for sharing this recipe, we now have another easy side dish to enjoy with the main course.

It's okay. I've had better elsewhere. I used minced garlic instead because it's what I had on hand

Easy recipe. I should have added extra garlic. I started the stalks about 3 minutes before the leaves. Which worked out well. Tasty dish! I've made a similar recipe with the addition of soy sauce. Also very tasty.

Simple and delicious! I added grilled chicken and a few cherry tomatoes for the last minute of cooking, but it would be fine as is. Thanks for helping me find good use for a bunch of bok choy I wasn't sure what to do with.

Using vegetable oil lowers the Asian taste.
The next day I made it with peanut oil.

Great, simple way to make it. Adding a bit of ginger adds a bit more to the flavor. Also, if you are busy making the main to stand there stirring for 6-7 minutes, you can just lower the heat, cover it, and let the steam do the job. So simple and easy! And yummy!

I've used this recipe many times and love the results. I actually prefer regular bok choy with it's slightly more robust flavours. Like others I stir fry the white stems  with garlic, adding the chopped green leaves near the end of the process.  A popular quick fix at my house.

This was an easy recipe for sure.  I put the stems in the pan first and cooked them for a while before adding the leaves.   Unfortunately, the taste was too bitter for my liking.  I may try this recipe again with the baby bok choy since say it has a sweeter flavor.

Great side dish, I took the advice of others and cook the chop up white part and then added the green leafy part. I used four heads of baby bok choy for three servings.

It was pretty good. I took the advice to cook the stems first and added sea salt.
