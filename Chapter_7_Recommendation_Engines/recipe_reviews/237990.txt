Great reviews for these very moist cupcakes.  I didn't have chocolate cake mix so used yellow which was just as good.  I used 4 eggs for the cake mix part.  I frosted the cupcakes with Nutella, a hazelnut chocolate spread.  They came out great!!

Wonderful! I suggest lowering the baking time to roughly  22 minutes; I found that they were fluffier, had more cheesecake flavor, and were less likely to stick to the  cupcake paper than my first batch. I didn't have chocolate cake mix so I used yellow and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

These cupcakes are absolutely amazing!! I made them for my daughter's birthday. We colored the frosting and used some sixlets for the top. Thanks for sharing!

These cupcakes were delicious! I substituted the store bought icing for homemade icing, and it turned out scrumptious. I will definitely  make these again!
