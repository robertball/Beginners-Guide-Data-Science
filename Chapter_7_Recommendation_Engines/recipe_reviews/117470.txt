This was "ok". The kids liked it, and it looked really tasty and crispy, but it just had no taste beyond that of deep fried saltines. I guess were just used  to a lighter coating like panko crumbs.(which I was out of)
The tartar sauce was ok, just kinda sweet and "mayonaisy". I kicked it up with some dill relish, paprika, and finely chopped egg. 
I will try this coating again as  suggested for chicken fried steak though.

This is one of the best fish coatings weâ€™ve yet to try. The coating turned
out light and crispy.  The only 
additions were a little onion and 
garlic powder to the crushed saltines.  Delicious!

This recipe made a light and crispy coating for the fish. We all loved it. I added the spices that we like to the crushed saltines. So much better than bread crumbs. We will be using this again and again!

I don't understand why there are reviewers writing in complaining about there not being much taste.  The recipe is clearly a basic fried fish recipe.  If you don't like simple, fried fish, add your own spices.  I actually put the spices on my own fish after it was already on my plate, because my boyfriend doesn't like spicey food as much as I do.  He loved it plain.  I covered mine in cajun seasoning and loved it that way.  Also, if you're complaining about there not being taste, consider using this on a thick piece of fish so there is more fresh fish flavor inside the coating.  I used thick alaskan cod filets, so I had the best of both worlds:  crunchy salty crust and succulent fish on the inside.

You'll have equal results using egg substitute and I've found my mini food processor is the perfect tool for pulverizing the saltines.  Made it for dinner tonight using fresh rock cod (we live in Northern California) in fact.

You can't beat it for ease and the light crispy coating  comes out perfect every time.

This is an excellent recipe for you to customize to your own taste. We use Waverly wafers, corn starch, flour, seasoning salt, garlic powder. Dry fish, then dip in beaten egg. Toss in breading mixture, refrigerate for 5-10 minutes to set breading and fry. We are all grown ups and can read the recipe and see there is really not any seasonings - so simply add what your family likes. The tartar sauce is a classic, we add some lemon juice. Good basic recipes that good cooks can customize without blinking an eye. Love it all, thanks for sharing!

I usually do a beer batter for fish but decided to try something different. After reading some reviews, I added some garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper..it was delicious!!! I used tilapia fillets..they were crispy and moist!! Will be making this again!!

This was easy and tasty. Next time I will use a food processor to make the crackers a little finer than I can get them with a rolling pin and bag. I will also mix in a few spices with the cracker crumbs, I think. This was an excellent go-to recipe, the changes will only add a little sparkle. I ended up using a sleeve and a few extra crackers for my two pounds of perch.

I hate to do this as I'm really not an avid fish eater but my New Zealand friend is!  I found these just so-so - not much taste and I think they needed way more seasoning.  I had hoped they would be good the next day but they were a soggy disappointment.
I tried again with a combo of flour and Panko and they were better but still needed more seasoning.

Good stuff! I used whole wheat crackers because it's all I had.  Also be sure not to over cook the fish.  My first batch was great, but I ran inside and overcooked the second batch.  A couple of minutes makes a big deal when deep frying something that is normally quick cooking.

This is a good recipe for someone who hates fish. The coating was heavy and tasteless. I seasoned the fish before coating but it still was very bland, as was the "faux" tarter sauce. I added the rest of the ingredients for a basic tarter sauce and it improved things a bit. Just not a good recipe unless you want to have lots of left-overs. I would not make this again, although with some seasonings added it might be a good coating for country fried steak...Sorry, Mom.
Update: Found a great substitute for the saltines in this simple recipe, and comes out even crunchier and less greasy. It's a 50/50 combo of crushed cornflakes and rice flakes (Sp-K), even  leftovers hold the crunch. Just add more salt/seasonings, etc... to get up to saltine level. And another great sub for one of the cereals are potato chips, I did the rice flakes with kettle chips and the crunch was insane!

I just made this for dinner tonite. My husband raved about it, and he is picky. I followed some other reviewers suggestions, added some flour, cornstarch, and spices to the crushed saltines. I did put the coated fish in the frig for 10 minutes to set up firmly, and that was a huge positive. I have found that when you want to crush saltines, put them in a freezer bag and get all the air out, then use your rolling pin to get them crushed very well. That way there is no food processor to clean up. Thank you for this very simple and quick recipe!

This is a good recipe, but you have to put some seasoning in the cracker crumbs.  I use salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.  Do this, and it won't be bland at all!

It was a decent coating.  I thought it was a touch bland so next time i will add more salt and pepper and maybe some other things.  Also it seems to suck up the oil in the pan like a vacuum cleaner.

Hands down, the BEST fried fish I ever had. I used a walleye I caught today and it was delicious. I used a little Blackoned seasoning on the fish before the egg wash and used whole wheat saltines (because that's what I had on hand)but man was it good. the tarter was great too.  Thanks for the recipe.

This really is mom's...well really dad's...fried fish. This is the way we ate all the river fish when growing up.  Very simple basic recipe that can be modified to your heart's content. My GF liked it and we'll probably use it again and again. We used whole wheat saltines and it was great. Next time we'll add paprika or lemon to the mix...maybe some garlic or onion.

I usually buy the packaged breading for frying fish, but I didn't want to go to town today. I am so glad that I didn't because this was awesome! So fast, easy and delicious. It made just the right amount of great crisp coating that wasn't too thick or thin. I added a little lemon pepper seasoning to the crushed saltines. That was the only revision I made.

Loved this - and I'm not a fish eater!  I used egg beaters with a few spalshes of hot pepper sauce, crushed reduced fat Ritz crackers with seasoning and atlantic cod.  The fish was crunchy on the outside and flaky on the inside.

This is a good start. It turned out light and flaky and looked wonderful. However, I suggest some salt, pepper, garlic salt, parsley, perhaps lawry's... or whatever seasoning you prefer. I don't understand how this could get so many stars while lacking flavor!

I love this recipe because it is so simple and good. The only changes I made were adding some old bay or cajun seasoning to the crushed saltines. I also chop capers (instead of using pickle relish) for the tartar sauce, that's just my preference. Thank you for the recipe!

Mine came out great!! Make sure to use relatively fresh crakers, though, I think stale ones would ruin the recipe. The 'crust' was perfect and tasty. And the tarter sauce was good for me and my husband. Thank you!

We did sprinkle each fillet with a creole seasoning and added finely chopped onion and garlic to wheat "buttery cracker" crumbs (easy to do when crushing the crackers in a food processor).  Even so, the fish was quite bland, especially without tarter sauce (we made our own sauce).  While this is a simple and fast recipe, I would add more seasonings to the crumbs to give a little more flavor.

Did not make the tartar sauce, but enjoyed the fish. I used orange roughy and added some seasoning (garlic salt, paprika and pepper) to the saltines. Fish was crispy and light. Non-fish-loving hubby even said it was good!

I love this recipe!  It is so simple and tasty!  I use butter crackers instead of saltines, and add some salt and pepper to the crushed crackers.  My kids like it when I make fish now!

I liked it. My mom had the same breading for pork chops. I will definitely stick with this one.
