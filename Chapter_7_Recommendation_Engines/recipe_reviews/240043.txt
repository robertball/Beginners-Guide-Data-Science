My husband loved it: five servings worth! My squash was on the small side but I had an acorn squash so I used that too; the subtle double flavor was great. My feta was plain, so I just threw in a few dried Med-style herbs.

I used regular feta and added some fresh basil, oregano and thyme from my garden along with a couple of large green olives, and I used a baking casserole lined with parchment. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It took the fall 40 minutes to cook, and it came out great. A wonderful combination of flavors!

My family really like this. I only had regular feta cheese so I added what I had on hand to make it "Greek"- black olives and fresh basil. The chicken was tender and was tasty. The presentation wasn't particularly beautiful but for a weeknight dinner it was fine and as it was quick easy prep I would make this again. Thanks for sharing!

So yummy!  I have a lot of squash in my garden and wanted something other than squash soup. This was perfect. I used plain reduced fat feta, added plenty of All Purpose Greek Seasoning (love that stuff!).  A little extra olive oil. Thatâ€™s it. My husband had 2 helpings.

I used yellow onion chicken squash regular basil garlic fresh ground black pepper and salt olive oil and it turned out great. I did not add the feta cheese. My husband was quite impressed with the few ingredients and as flavorful as it turned out. Will definitely make again. Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Since I'm not a great cook but had the ingredients I went for it. Boy was it worth it! Even my husband who hates everything I make ate it. The butternut squash gives it just a touch of sweetness and I even added tri-color peppers as well as cabbage.
