Made this for Superbowl party, and I could have eaten the whole thing myself! I loved it...I did make a few slight changes; increased the amount of Franks to 1/2 cup (wanted them saucier), sprinkled a little garlic & onion powder over the cauliflower after laying on the baking sheet, added 1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs for a little crunch to the parm cheese and then sprinkled that over the florets before putting them into the oven. I will definitely make again!

Good, and a great vegetarian and lower fat version of buffalo wings. I made a couple of mistakes, though. First, I didn’t have Franks, so I used a mix of mostly Tabasco and a little Cholula. Tobasco must be A LOT hotter, because the cauliflower florets were hot hot hot. I ate them with carrots, celery, and ranch dip; as dinner, the recipe is more like two or three servings.  I cooked them at 400 but will try 375 next time — they browned a lot, and I cooked them for 10-15 mins less time than suggested.  I’ll try them next time with Franks and cut the florets larger. I didn’t think the cheese was necessary, especially if you serve them with ranch or blue cheese dip.

Good taste. 4 stars because I think, as another reviewer suggested, a higher temp would have made it a little crispier. I used vegan mayo, about a 1/4 cup, and added maybe half a packet of dry ranch dressing. I will definitely make again

It wasn't browning like I wanted it to, so I increased the temp to 425F and that helped a bit, then I stuck them under the broiler for 2 minutes and that helped a bit, too. It made the texture a bit more interesting because at 375F it was all the same soft texture. Next time I'll cook it on higher heat the whole time and hope for improved texture and flavor depth.

this came out SOOO good! i used a combo of Crystal hot sauce and Frank's.. cut the olive oil in half.. left out the parm all together and didn't miss it at all. i also added 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder to the sauce. cooked this in batches in our air fryer at 400 degrees for 15 minutes each. i'm so glad i stumbled upon this recipe. thank you so much! ~~UPDATE: i tried making this in the oven and the results weren't the same. we still like this recipe but will only do it in the air fryer from now on.  but ty again for posting

Brush with melted butter at turning point and sprinkle parmesan.  Bake at 375 covered for 35 min, then TURN and broil for 7-10 min to get the perfect texture of cooked and crunchy!!

This came out amazing! I listened to the other reviewers and cooked at 425 the whole time. I used two cauliflowers for a large appetizer and doubled the recipe. I used panko breadcrumbs with the Parmesan cheese for that extra crisp, the last 15 minutes.  Everyone loved it!

I ran out of batter so just roasted the rest of the cauliflower along side. Also, used a fork to dip the florets into the batter and crumbs, much neater. When cutting the cauliflower be sure to get the stem along with the florets so that the chunks don’t fall apart. If you just get flowers then they break apart in the batter or crumbs and you end up with tiny Buffalo nibbles, not worth the effort. I did not toss them in the BBQ sauce because I was worried that the batter/ crumb mixture would fall off. It’s sturdier than I thought, I think it would be fine. I’ll do it next time. I just brushed the sauce over them. Still yum! I ran out of steam after the cauliflower so for a dip I used Veganaise and dill and garlic. Thick but good. Ranch would be perfect, but I didn’t have any.

Fast, simple, and delicious! This was perfect as written. I did use shredded parm instead of grated because I didn't realize I was out. This is a great side to serve with chicken. Thanks for sharing Huserdaddy!
