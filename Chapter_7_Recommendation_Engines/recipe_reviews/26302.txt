Very delicious but the recipe makes A TON of food. I cut the recipe in half and it still made enough to serve at least 6. I also used store bought roasted red peppers instead of roasting it myself and that worked fine. The only change I made was to add a bit of garlic and parsley to the cheese sauce because I love the flavors! I will make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I couldn't find arugula, but substituted spinach and it worked well.  Seemed to make a lot more than 8 servings though - I ended up freezing about half and baking it later.

This was very good.
The only mistake I made was assuming that the amount of asparagus called for was too much. I was wrong, I wished afterwards it had more, and I should have just followed directions! I also added some toasted pine nuts...because it seemed like the right thing to do. And it was- yum. Serve this with a warm, crusty piece of bread and a glass of wine...you will be sure to impress.

This was a very delicious dish. We made it for Valentines Day and thoroughly enjoyed it. Like one of the other reviewers we could not find the arugula and used spinach instead. We also added some garlic, fresh parsley, and red onion to the sauce. We used bow-tie pasta instead of the rigatoni as we liked the look a little better. It made way more than the recipe said it would, the "4" servings were more like 6 or 8. We will make this for a special occasion again.

Very tasty.  I cut this recipe down to 3 servings and it still made enough for four generous portions.  The flavors were good and I followed the recipe accept I used spinach instead of arugula and added two cooked, cubed chicken tenders.
