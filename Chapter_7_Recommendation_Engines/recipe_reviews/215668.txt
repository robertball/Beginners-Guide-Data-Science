Very healthy and simple recipe. Unfortunately lava beans r hard to find, I use othr types. I would add a squeeze of lemon juice at the end to compliment the flavors.

I love Italy, too, lovesitaly! Please try this recipe for a light, healthy summer meal. I highly recommend it. Progresso has canned fava beans. Ask your grocer to order you a few cans if you have trouble finding them. They make this recipe. Now, I do have a couple of personal changes to mention. I used 12 oz. of dried WW penne pasta. I think using a whole pound, the broccolini and favas would get lost. I also added 2 heaping tbsps of fresh chopped basil with the beans and sundried tomatoes and sprinkled 1 tbsp on top, after mixing everything together, before sprinkling the cheese on top. If you can find smoked sundried tomatoes, try them! They give a nice depth of flavor. Lastly, I combined 3 cheeses - asiago, pecorino romano and parm - again, for more complex flavor. Thanks again, lovesitaly!

I did not have fava beans, so I used lima beans and I added few chopped sicilian olives. Delizioso!

Made this with a 340g package of whole wheet penne because that is the size it comes in here in Canada.  And I used broccoli instead as I could not find broccolini.  At first it tasted kind of bland, so I added a bit of salt and more red pepper flakes.  I found that this dish grew on me to the more I ate it.

I had 1 bunch of baby broccoli to use, so decided to try this recipe.  Both my husband and I loved it!  If I hadn't been starving, I would have taken a picture of it.  It is very colorful with the bright green of the broccoli and red of the sun-dried tomatoes.  Since I only had 1 bunch of baby broccoli, I cut back on the pasta (about 10 ounces), and did not use whole wheat pasta, as I didn't have any on hand.  I used the full amount of all other ingredients.  I served it with chicken on the side, but next time would add cooked chicken to this dish.  Quick, easy, and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is an amazingly delicious meal! The flavors are fabulous together. On top of that, it is simple and quick to prepare. The hardest part was trying to find fava beans; in that I failed, but I had a can of fava & garbanzo beans mixed, which worked just fine. I know I'll be making this again!

Delicious and healthy; I loved all the flavors in this and the fava beans are a nice addition that helps keep you full. Basil would be a great garnish when in season. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't like this at all! I used 2 good pricey packages of organic baby broccoli, that I normally just steam and they have great flavor on their own. The broccoli was slightly undercooked, the beans were on the mushy side, the hot pepper flakes made it way too hot, and the sun dried tomatoes just tasted too strong for my taste. It's odd, as I like all of these flavors. They just didn't seem to come together for some reason. Although, not the submitters fault, the calorie count seems really off also. I figured it as 250 cal a serving before adding pasta to taste.
