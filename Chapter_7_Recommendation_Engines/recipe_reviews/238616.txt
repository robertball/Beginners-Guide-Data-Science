Overall a really good recipe. We weren't able to get the eggplant into a rollable state - 1/4" is too thick of a cut and 20 minutes is too short of a bake. I'd recommend cutting the eggplant really thin and then baking it. We ended up shredding up our eggplant and turning this into an improv lasagna.

This recipe has been a favorite at our house.  Eggplant & fresh herbs from the garden make this meal special.
