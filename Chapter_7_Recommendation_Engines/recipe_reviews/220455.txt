I added vinegar to soy milk to make the buttermilk, and used spelt flout instead of ap flour.  This is definitely worth making!  My family really enjoyed this!

This turned out really well, even though I let it rest in a warm place for 4 hours instead of room temperature for 12 hours. I substituted honey for molasses out of necessity. 
My only complaint is that there was about 1/2 cup too much flour.

On the plus side this is a recipe with almost no fat and whole grains.  But it really would taste better with a little butter or even vegetable oil and maybe some raisins, currants or other dried fruit.

I can no longer  eat anything made with  yeast. This is the first recipe I have seen for soda bread that is not white bread. It tastes a lot like the black bread  that I still make for my husband. The next time I will cut the  flour back 1/2 cup as  someone else suggested as it is quite dense. This is my new go to soda bread.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  The bread didn't rise, was very very dense, and had no flavor at all.  Nothing like the soda bread I had when I was in Ireland a couple of years ago.  All the soda bread I had there was light brown in color, had excellent flavor.  Very disappointed.
