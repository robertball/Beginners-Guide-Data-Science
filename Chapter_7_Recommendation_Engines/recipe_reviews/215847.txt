I am Italian and my grandparents showed me how to make REAL Eggplant Parmesan.  I do have to say... this recipe is pretty darn close to how we make our recipe.  The only thing I recommend doing different is making your own sauce.  We also cut the eggplant as thin as possible... the thinner you get the eggplant, the crispier and more flavorful it will be!  This is definetly the best Eggplant recipe on this site.

Nice recipe, followed except used home made sauce on hand in freezer. Here's a great tip to dry the eggplant before cooking: Cut in thin slices. Put down several layers of paper towels. Salt the towel, lay slices on top, then salt the top of the slices and cover with a few more layers to paper towels. Let sit 2-3 hours. Rinse, dip in flour and shake off excess, dip in egg/water mixture, then bread crumbs. Just want to share this technique - it was just given to me and had nice results.

I've done similar recipe - this is fast, easy & delicious for all the eggplant lovers. Only note is I bake the eggplant for 8 minutes on each side and bake for 40 minutes total. Nothing worse than uncooked eggplant. Delicious - try this one!

I have made this recipe several times and this is what I have learned. I need 4 eggs by the time I am done and I do what others did, I bake it 10 minutes on each side. I love this recipe and think it is even better to make a day ahead. It is very important to slice the egg plant very thin. Great dish!

J-Louise   I make this very easy for myself!  Trader Joe's sells breaded eggplant in the freezer section.  It is excellent and takes all the work out of having to prepare the eggplant.

Perfect, traditional eggplant parm dish. This is what you get when you order Eggplant Parmigiani in restaurants (albeit, using jarred sauce).  You can always substitute homemade sauce, if you're a purist.    
The only change I made was to put some olive oil on the baking sheet then preheated the oiled sheet before baking the eggplant.  It gives it that yummy fried flavor without all of the calories.

Good basic recipe. Only changes I made was to use homemade gravy (sauce) as my italian Mom did:) Also, we slice eggplant thin, place on brown paper bags or paper towels and sprinkle salt on them for about two hours or more to get rid of excess water.  We dip the eggplant in flour first, then an egg/milk mixture, then breadcrumbs.

One Hundred Stars! Delicious. I used frozen eggplant slices from Trader Joe's. What a time saver. I made the night before serving and heated up for 40 minutes. Super easy. I highly recommend this dish

When I first made this I was underwhelmed.  It was bland and I was really disappointed since breading each thinly sliced piece of eggplant was a lot of work!  We only ate about a third of it, and I hate to waste so even though it was a bust, I popped the left overs in the freezer.  Fast forward a month or two and I defrosted a bit -- and holy moly!  You'd have thought it was an entirely different eggplant parm!  Reheated it in the oven and all of a sudden it was flavorful and delicious!  I guess it's one of those recipes that has to sit.  Next time the whole batch is going straight into the freezer!

I actually made this with zucchini instead of eggplant but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. This was very easy to throw together and I loved that it was baked. My only complaint was the amount of mozzarella cheese. Next time I would use half the amount called for. It was overpowering and cheese is fairly expensive so I was a little disappointed with that but other than that a great recipe. I sliced my zukes very thin but they were a tad on the crunchy side still so if you are thinking of trying this with the zukes then add a little more time to the initial baking time. I made this with garlic bread and a spicy vinegar/ cuke/ black olive/feta salad

good recipe, I followed it but skipped the step of frying each egg plant prior to layering it in a pyrex. I also used mexican fresh cheese instead of mozzarella and a bit of parmesan sprinkled over the sauce on top and just baked it . Came out great as well.

This recipe was easy and SO delicious! I followed other users' advice and thinly sliced the eggplant, placed them on paper towels to dry out and salted them. I split the recipe to serve 4 and cooked in a 2-qt. baking dish. I'll be making this again and again!

Amazing! I have never baked eggplant before but thin slices baked on both sides for 8 minutes then 30 in the sauce was perfect! I cut one eggplant in half and sliced with my food processor. From the pictures it looks like people cut it like a plank but the smaller slices were crispier and easier to eat! I also minced some garlic and zucchini to mix in the sauce and topped with cheese and bacon bits! Delicious!!

Wow!  This recipe was so easy to make and it was super yummy!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and soaked the eggplant in salt water for 30 mins. before breading.  My sister, who hates eggplant, loved this, too!  Will definitely make again.

This was a hit with everyone, every age, in our family.  I didn't use nearly 4 cups of crumbs (probably 1 -2) and not quite as much cheese, and I forgot the basil but it was still delicious.

This recipe is great! I made it a few weeks ago, and my husband (a big meat eater) even liked it! I followed the recipe exactly, besides adding some extra seasonings to the sauce.  We like Eggplant Parmesan to be a little spicy.  I also followed some of the tips in the comments, like slicing the eggplant very thin, and drying it before baking. Delicious!  I'm making this again tonight!

This turned out delicious and very low calorie for the amount you get.  For the bottom layer you don't even have to bread it if you don't want the extra calories.  Even better the second day!!

Since the eggplant got a little (too) soft for my liking while baking, next time I might fry the breaded eggplant in a bit of olive oil prior to baking it. 

Also, the recipe calls for a lot of cheese -- if you are trying to watch calories, it could easily do with 10-12 oz. of mozzarella instead of 16 oz. 

It was very tasty and pretty simple especially because it calls for all ingredients found in typical kitchens.

I needed 3 eggs for this recipe and made a 9x13 casserole with only one eggplant.  I also needed to cook the eggplant in the oven for 9 minutes and the casserole for 40 min.  I used Panko bread crumbs and added Italian seasoning.  I also used my own marinara.  Yummy!

Who knew making such a dish could be so easy. And appreciated. Eggplant has a wonderful flavor. I too used my own sauce.

This is great basic recipe.  I use homemade sauce instead, reserve some for later as it tends to dry out a little.  I layered in some ziti between eggplant layers and it came out fantastic!

This was just okay.  My family didn't care for it much.  It had way too much onion.

I carelessly misread the steps to this recipe and ended up breading the eggplant slices, then layering them and baking completely skipping the baking the eggplant on its own first.  Nevertheless, the dish was delicious and the whole family enjoyed it.  I'll follow the steps exactly next time.

This was sooo good and easy. I did spray the baking sheet before I baked the eggplant and used fresh parmesan, and used Prego spaghetti sauce with mushrooms, baking time/temp was right on was a great recipe!

Great recipe - I used regular whole wheat bread crumbs to make it a little healthier (and added Italian seasoning), and it turned out great.  I'll definitely make this again.  Also, I agree with the other review - 8 min per side and 40 minutes would probably be better.  My eggplant turned out a little hard, but it was still delicious.

This was just okay. Bland for the most part. I was disappointed after reading all of the better reviews. We love eggplant and are always looking for new ways to prepare it.  We love variety, but this will not be made again.

This is an excellent recipe! The only thing I did differently was use Classico's caramelized onion and garlic marinara sauce, as well as using kraft mozzarella with a touch of philly. My husband and I LOVED it!

kinda cheated putting this together as we were not eating dinner at the same time; and honestly just a lazy way to do it.  but, turns out the same.  fried up the eggplant; topped with parm, homemade meat sauce and mozzarella.  Done and done.  couldn't be easier.  :-)

The eggplant was so tough my girlfriend couldn't eat it. You gotta fry the eggplant before you bake it. Maybe this recipe is okay if you're trying to cut calories by not frying it first, but the taste ain't there.

Excellent!! I put a layer of ricotta cheese in the middle for added flavor and moisture! Delicious!
