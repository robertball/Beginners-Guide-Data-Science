They sell Elephant Ears in MI too and those are actually funnel cakes, nothing like (Indian) Fry Bread or Sopapillas.  However there is a recipe for Elephant Ears which contains yeast but is somewhat similar to Fry Bread and Sopapillas.

Traditional Fry Bread Recipe
Indian Fry Bread
ga-do di-gv-tsa-la-nv-hi a-yv-wi-ya
3 cups flour 
1 tablespoon baking powder 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1 cup warm water 
Combine dry ingredients in a bowl. 
Add warm water in small amounts and knead dough until soft but not sticky. Adjust flour or water as needed. Cover bowl and let stand about 15 minutes.  Pull off large egg-sized balls of dough and roll out into fairly thin rounds. Fry rounds in hot oil until bubbles appear on the dough, turn over and fry on the other side until golden.  Serve hot. Try brushing on honey, or making into an Indian Taco. 
Buttermilk Fry Bread
Substitute buttermilk for water. Follow the same recipe. 

Sopapilla's
MEXICAN SOPAPILLAS   
2 c. flour
3 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tbsp. shortening
Oil for deep frying

Sift dry ingredients together in bowl. Cut in shortening until crumbly. Add 1/2 cup warm water gradually, stirring with fork. Dough will be crumbly. Turn onto lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth. Divide in half. Let stand for 10 minutes. Cut into 3" squares. Fry, several at a time, in deep fat at 400 degrees for 30 seconds on each side. Yield: 40 sopapillas.

These may be okay as "Frybread," but if you are expecting to get the wonderful, puffy "sopapillas" served as dessert in New Mexico, you will be sorely disappointed.

This is good fry bread, but sopapillas are VERY different in both Arizona and New Mexico (they are basically like a hallow pillow of dough, fry bread is flat).

This treat is known by different names in different areas. Here in Arizona it is known as fry bread, in New Mexico it is known as sopapillas and in Washington it is known as elephant ears.



I think it should be noted that.. elephant ears and sopapillas and Fry bread are nowhere near the same thing. They all come from very different cultures.

I remember eating this wonderful bread for the first time in AZ and just loved it. This recipe was extremely close to the crispy bread I had back then.  Very easy to make and very yummy!!

The kids really like this...but I thought it was too flat - I like my frybread to poof up.  I also found it kind of hard to shape to any large size.  But it's a good basic recipe and my kids loved helping to make it and they ate it up.

In New Mexico there is a difference between Fried Bread (also called Indian Fried Bread) and Sopapillas. Your directions are for fried bread, also it remains flat after frying. Great topped with meat sauce, cheese, chili, etc.... Sopapillas are rolled out into a thin round shape which is than cut into smaller pieces (about 3"x4"), they are fried until they swell into a flaky bubble and are a light golden color, cut them open add butter or honey (heaven!!) great stuffed also. I don't know about Elephant Ears but on the Island of Trinadad they are just called Bake, they are rolled out thick like fried bread but cut up like sopapillas, fried till they swell and are golden, remove from oil and sprinkle with a little salt, serve them the same way as fried bread or sopapillas or use them as you would dinner rolls although honey and butter are always an option.

Love this recipe! However, I added 1 tablespoon of sugar for a little extra something. A great, tasty, and easy recipe.

My family just loves these....I have made them twice now...and they always go fast. One suggestion to everyone though, these are only good warm...so you can fry up what you need and put the rest of the dough in teh fridge for the next day to fry up.....that way they are always made fresh, but the dough is made once..... :) These are make awesome frybread for a great tex-mex dinner!!!

It's a long time before you figure the exact consistency, but once you do it's worth it and very simple.  I like to add raisins or grated cheddar cheese for a different flavour.

These are so easy to make and are great with a large group under the full moon over a fire vs. the stove top.

Wonderful!  Not *quite* as good as Arizona state fair fry bread, but good. My in-law family called them "scones"! They all refused to put taco ingredients on top- and had dinner of scones with honey!  I enjoyed them, and will make again.

I have been wanting to make a fry bread recipe for.ev.er. My mom used to make fry bread as a breakfast treat every once in a blue moon (we lived in Alaska for a year when I was a baby, and she learned the recipe there). This recipe isn't quite how (I think) I remember the fry bread my mom made - but it is light, airy, crispy, chewy and perfect. My 16 year old ate about half the finished recipe on his own I think! We served with butter, jam, and honey.

Mmmm, yummy. Crusty, chewy clouds of goodness. Perfect for tacos or sprinkle some cinnamon and sugar on them for a real treat. Thanks for sharing!
