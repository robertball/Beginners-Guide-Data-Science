Really good... my husband found this recipe (after telling him I don't like plain rice) and cooked it up. We used regular white rice, cooked it with water, bullion, and the liquid from a can of diced tomatoes. Added the tomatoes when the rice was done, heated through, and added a little cream cheese, shredded cheddar cheese, and the parmesan.

Very good side dish.  I made this according to the six-serving suggestion, but cut out the extra 1/2 package of cream cheese (used only 1 package).  Recipe did not need the extra cheese -- it was wonderful.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  Great alternative to just plain old rice

I think that this recipe has some great potential.  I used jasmine rice and a can of chopped tomatoes.  I will up the chicken broth another 3/4 cup as we enjoy a moister rice. I also decreased the cream cheese by half, and it will be great w/ my modifications.  It was a nice change from the same 'ole same 'ole.

Loved it.  I didn't have any broth at home so I used the water required to make the rice (which was regular brown rice so it took longer) and threw in some Garlic Basil seasoning I have from Home-Made Gourmet.  Perfect side dish!!

This is the perfect way to use up left over cream cheese.  I only use 3-4 oz. and it's plenty creamy, though.

I'm not sure if I liked this or not. It was really hard for some reason. I followed the directions exactly but I added frozen peas instead of the tomatoes. I think my problem was I left it on the stove with the oven on and it kept cooking it and made it hard as a rock, I added some milk to it to thin it out and it was really good, I couldn't stop eating it! Thanks a bunch.

Simple to make and overall it was pretty good, but it could have been made with about 1/2 the cream cheese.

This was definitely different for me but I enjoyed it lots. I made this using some leftover brown rice and I left out the tomatoes, added frozen peas like the footnote said and also sauteed some red bell peppers with the onions. Put a bit of chicken bouillon cube in there since the rice wasn't already flavoured, used less cream cheese (just sorta eyeballed it while stirring it in) and served with Parmesan Chicken from this site. I have to say I enjoyed it lots and will make again. Thanks!

This was great! I used brown rice, a can of garlic and onion diced tomatoes, and sprinkled parm on top after plating. I will make this again many more times. Thanks!

The flavor was pretty good, but I must have done something wrong because the rice was VERY thick and sticky.  I did use low-fat cream cheese so maybe that was the problem.  Probably won't make again just because of the texture.

the rice was fine as a side dish to a very spicy meal, as there was not a lot of flavor in itself.

This was amazing! and very simple to prepare.  added one pound of shrimp (pre-cooked) and I used half regular cream cheese and half non-fat to cut down a bit. I also used a can of tomatoes that were seasoned with basil, etc in place of fresh tomatoes. This will become one of my regular recipies.

Pretty good. I think I'll halve the cream cheese next time though.

I love this recipe - I've made it several times now.  Even my picky husband loves it (as long as I leave out the tomatoes).  I have found that it gets stiff very quickly, and needs to be served right away.

This was okay. The blend of cheese add a different flavor to the rice. I used regular rice because I didn't have instant on hand and added the ingredients mid-way through the cooking of the rice. Worked out well. Perhaps this would be better with some mexican or taco seasoning and eaten as spanish rice.

Four stars for the idea.  I used basmati rice in place of minute rice and pretty much followed the same method; just added corn, chopped kale, one tomato, shredded estra sharp cheddar, parmesean cheese, and a big ol dolop of sour cream in place of the cream cheese.  Came out great and my picky son loved it.

Delicious! Great side item. Even for non-rice lovers!
Made some changes: 
Would only use 1/2 to 3/4 of the cream cheese suggested. I love cream cheese, but it was VERY cream cheesy. 
Doubled the parsley amount because 1 tbsp wasnt quite enough. 
Didnt have chicken stock, so used hot water and boullion (sp?)
Thanks!!

This was a very tasty side dish for chicken. The creaminess was just right and the tomatoes added a good fresh flavour to the dish.
