Cute and creative! This was a really great snack for kids and instead of the raisins, I opted for a combination of mini marshmallows and mini chocolate chips. Definitely have a tall glass of milk close by....

My grandson loved this for breakfast! I used all natural peanut butter, strawberry jelly (from a squeeze bottle), dried cranberries instead of raisins & I added a few mini-chocolate chips & some colored sprinkles. Very neat idea...it's fun & tasty! (you know I had to steal a bite ;o) ) Thanks JAE24!

My kids loved these. I don't make them peanut butter banana sandwiches to offen. But This was totally filling. They were huge in the hot dog bun and my kids could barely finish them. But they said it ROCKS!!!! I made this to a T but using a seedless raspberry sugar-free w/splenda jelly. Topped with golden raisins. Fun quick and easy. I put the peanut butter and jelly in plasitc ziploc baggies and snipped the corners off to pipe easily along the sides of the banana....was totally fun. Thanks for the sweet recipe.

I made this for my little guy today, and he seemed to get a kick out of it! I thought it was really cute and creative, but for some reason I couln't get past the hot dog bun, lol. I don't know why, it's bread, but I just couldn't do it. My son on the other hand really enjoyed it, but it was a bit too much for him food wise (he tried though). I did omit the raisins only because I didn't have any and used his favorite grape jelly instead of raspberry. All in all this is a great idea, and it made my little guy smile, Thanks! :)

Just served this to my 2 and 7 yr olds. It was a hit. I liked it, too. I served it with crunchy peanut butter, which gave it a nice touch.

I used a piece of low-carb bread, Better 'N Peanut Butter and Smuckers sugar-free blackberry jam. Not necessarily the healthiest, but a really fun meal.

I served this for something different for my kids, fast easy and healthy. I have a family of picky children and finding something that the majority likes is a big deal. I served it with veggie chips on the side. I will serve this again sometime.

I was surprised at how good this was! I didn't add the raisins and I used white bread buns. I would make this again!

I kinda did the recipe by memory and ended up making it differently-- I spread the peanut butter first and then added a thin layer of jelly (cause I don't like jelly that much). For the banana I sliced it up and layered it because it was too big to bite otherwise. The sandwich itself was very sweet and I will only eat it on rare occasions (I'm not a big sweet fan). I did enjoy this more than a standard PB&J though! I would recommend at least trying it.
